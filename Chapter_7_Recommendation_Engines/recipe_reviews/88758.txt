We had these for dinner with pork chops, YUMMY!  I added a whole extra onion, next time I may even add another one because they were soooo good! And I thought it was easier to just mix everything together in a bowl and then pour it onto a baking sheet.  Great recipe!  Will definitely make again!

Oh my goodness, these are good!  I have made these twice in the last 2 weeks and my whole family loves them. I bought a very large wholesale club bag of "fingerling" potatoes and wasn't quite sure what to do with them.  This recipe is perfect. I quarter the potatoes lengthwise, put everything in a large bowl, toss it all together (except the cheese)and bake it in a greased 13 X 9 pan.  Be sure to use the "kosher salt" as called for - it is very coarsely ground and has about 1/2 the sodium per tablespoon as regular salt. Or, if you do not have kosher salt on hand and are using regular salt, cut the salt to 1/2 a tablespoon.  The cheddar cheese sprinkled on top at the end, makes these really delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!

I give this 5 stars because we've made this 2 times within the last 3 nights.  Went over very well with the boyfriend.  The chili powder is a great touch!  I broiled them for a bit at the end to get a good top crunch going on.  Thanks for sharing this.

These turned out very well, I used taco seasoning as some suggested and nuked the potatos for 8 minutes before roasting...I'll definitely make these again.

These were very tasty and easy to make.  I make something like this on the stove-top but this was much easier!  (No standing at the stove!) I loved the onions, I would cut them in bigger chunks next time.  I threw in about 6 whole cloves of garlic, crushed under the side of my knife (in addition to the garlic powder).  Those were delicious too!  I only used 4 pretty small Yukon golds, so I only used 2 TBS of oil and this was too much- would only add 1 TBS next time.  I reduced the salt quite a bit- just sprinkled some on.  The cheese (I used sharp cheddar) is a nice touch, but it would be good without it too.  I was making roast beef at the same time, so I baked these at 350 for over an hour.  I think I will keep this method and try different spice/herb combos.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and easy!  I added chunks of boneless chicken and quartered onions to make it a one meal dish. Served with salad.  Guests loved.

I had preboiled red potatoes on hand from another project. I spread them out on the sheet tray and pushed them down with my palms to give them the "burst" look. Lovely crisp and flavor...EASY!

Made this for a Mothers Day brunch side dish. Everyone liked it, except for hubby who dislikes onion. I only used 1/2 the onion too. I used a spoonful of jarred minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and Tony Chacheres seasoned salt instead of kosher salt. I thought it was just a little greasy from the oil but it soaked up a lot once I pulled it from the oven. I really liked the flavor of this dish. I will probably make this again.

This was good.  A simple, yummy sidedish.  You can use any kind of potato really.

We had these along with Richard's Breakfast Scramble (a fave of mine from this site) for brunch today. I didn't have kosher salt so I subbed about 1 1/2 tsp table salt. Next time I'll probablt pop the potatoes back in the oven for about 5 minutes to melt the cheese because it didn't melt all that great on it's own. Thanks for the great recipe Yapodaca.

Mmmmmmm! Yummy! I was a little pressed for time & also had something in the oven that was cooking at a 100 degree difference lower, so I semi pre-cooked my potatoes in the microwave. (If you cut them 1st, you don't have to deal with cutting hot potatoes!) I premix all the spices together in a ramekin. I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of Sweet Paprika for added flavor & color. It seemed like a lot of rub/spice to me, so I didn't use about 1 Tablespoon of it the 1st time around, but when I tasted it, I deduced that it would've been fine to add it. My boyfriend actually wanted it to be spicier, so the next time around, I added 1/8 tsp Smoked Paprika, 1/8 tsp Cayenne Pepper & also added a diced up Louisiana Hot Link Sausage. It made a perfect breakfast dish in it's own right all by itself. I served it with some chilled papaya slices to cool the tongue & diffuse some of the heat from the Hot Links & Cayenne. I have to also say that  I love this site! I especially love being able to change the number of servings & have the ingredients re-calculated for me for the needed servings. Saves me a lot of work & time! Very Cool!  :og

I give these 5 stars because they are great! I make them slightly different; I use three tbsp. of onion soup mix and olive oil. I put the potatoes in a plastic resealable bag and toss them in the olive oil and onion soup mix. I have used other spice/herb combinations but the onion soup mix is by far our families favorite! Great recipe!

Great recipe, Yolanda! Thanks! I only have a couple of "tweeks" to add. #1)I use chunky-cut Vidalia onions (& twice the amount called for: Less burning & better flavor/texture because they have more water in them, IMO). #2) I toss ALL ingredients, but the cheese, in a large zip-top freezer bag, shake, pour into a 9"x 12" bake dish. (I keep the bag for any leftovers.) I also sprinkle some course-ground black pepper over all before baking; cheese goes on as per recipe. Any shredded cheese works...try jalapeno/Jack. A fun recipe to work with. Nice job & good reviews, too!

Tried these with 7 yukon gold potatoes. the texture was great. Roasted them on a cookie sheet and didn't use cheese.  Added about 1/4 t cayenne and 1/2 t paprika.I followed others advice and used only 1 T of salt. Hawaiian sea salt to specify and I found that much too salty. My  husband didn't mind the saltiness but I found relief only by using ketchup. Loved the chili powder taste. Will definitely make again only using a 1/2 T salt.Very easy to prepare....not sure why some of the posted photos have colorless potatoes, mine were a rich brown/red shade. looked great too!

Very easy & tasty way to fix potatoes! I lined the pan with foil and used a touch of olive oil spray to prevent sticking. I used only 1/2 Tbsp. of kosher salt, otherwise followed exactly and we thought they were great....loved the spicyness! First time I made these I topped with the cheese, next time I skipped cheese just to save some fat/calories. Delicious either way!

I have made these potatoes for years. I use fresh garlic and 2 to 3 cloves. I also add parsley. These are great to make when you are out camping, they wake everyone up with the great smell. Another way I like to fix them is with polish sausage cut up (either regular or hot) and then scramble eggs. Everyone Love these.

These are really really good. I made as written, but used a bit less garlic powder and used some fresh garlic. I used Kosher sea salt, and they were a bit saltier than I would like (I like salt too!) I would just use either more potatoes (who does not like leftovers??), or a bit less oil and salt. I did use 1 extra potato than called for. My family GOBBLED them up! Great with the cheese, and without. They liked the cheese on these better than without.  I might add more onion too. My kids do not eat skin on potatoes, or care for oniions, and they did not think twice about eating these with the skin, and I do not think they even noticed the onion. YUMMMMMMMY will be making again with the changes. Thank you for a great recioe. I bet these would be good with just about any seasoning you want to add. We loved the Chili powder kick!

Awesome!  The only thing I did differently was doubled the chili powder as my hubby likes it HOT! I didn't get a chance to add the cheese as he was ready to eat. It still came out so tasty!  This is definitely a keeper and will be added to the bi-weekly menu schedule.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Easy Spicy Roasted Potatoes Haiku: "OMG Salty. We could barely finish these, without broccoli." I had some naked, steamed broccoli on the side of these potatoes which thank goodness, included in a forkful, cut down some of the crazy saltiness of the potatoes. I followed the recipe, halving the seasoning for 4 medium red potatoes, and followed the directions to a T. With several other roasted potato recipes on AR, I can't imagine making this one again.

OMG....I followed the recipe almost to the tee; added jsut abit more chili powder as we like things spicy.  I took EMMA37's advice and added boneless skinless chicken (about 1lb) cut in chunks to the mix for a "One Pot Wonder" as my husband calls them and it was amazing; served with a vegie on the side!Thank you Yolanda!!!

Delicious!  I added a little apple cider vinegar to the olive oil, and used Tony Chachere's in place of chili powder.  I also scattered some red pepper flakes on there for good measure.  This recipe was just the thing to go with our meal.  It could have even been our whole meal!

Good potatoes, definitely easy to put together. I would recommend cutting back on the oil and salt; I found them to be a bit too salty.  Also, it would be better to add the onions halfway through the cooking process, b/c (as others have mentioned) my onions got burned before the potatoes were done.  Really enjoyed the flavors, just needs a few adjustments.  thanks for the recipe :)

Made these for lunch today.  They looked so delicious after cooking.  I followed recipe exact except for cutting down the garlic powder a smidgeon  My husband and I both loved them.  Put cheese on half and left it off the other half.  We both agreed we could take the cheese or leave it.  It is a very tasty attractive dish and a keeper for my family.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent with the Italian Breaded Porkchops from this site!  I cut the salt in half and used a teaspoon of garlic powder with two crushed cloves.  Mixed the spices together first, then shook everything together in a big Ziplock bag because that's easier than mixing in the pan.  I broiled it for a few minutes at the end to crisp everything up...yum!

I made this twice this week (it's that good!).  The first time, I followed the directions perfectly (with the cheese) except that I used regular baking potatoes.  It was fabulous!  The second time, I cut the oil to 2 tablespoons and increased the chili powder to 1 tablespoon.  It was even better this way.  I couldn't have asked for a better breakfast potatoes recipe!  Thanks!

These were really good!  I used sea salt in place of kosher and 1T was a tad much.  If making a similar sub, start w/about 1/2T and adjust per taste from there.  I also misread the chili powder amount in my overtired state and used 1T.  I was worried I'd ruined dinner, but it actually wasn't too spicy (though, I'll probably revert to 2tsp next time).  THANKS for the recipe!

I really liked these!  I added a little less salt and garlic powder - maybe 3/4 tablespoon - and they came out perfect.  I didn't add cheese, but it honestly doesn't need it.  Yum!

Great! Left the skins on. Skipped the onion and cheese. Used one tsp of salt and extra chili pdr. What put this over the top was instead of the garlic pdr I used whole cloves of garlic. They roasted up to deliciousness! They gave the potates a great flavor and the garlic melts in your mouth.

The only thing was I used yellow potatoes instead of red, and I'll choose to use a little less oil next time.  Otherwise, delicious!

I loved these! They were a little too salty though (and I love salt) so I will probably cut back or even omit the salt the next time I made this. I made this with fingerling potatoes and cut the pieces about 1" diameter. I will also add another onion the next time I make this...it was probably the best part!

So easy, so fast. and I didn't fine it too spicy. Thought it was just right. I only had yukon gold potatoes and it was fine. I put the oil in gallon size baggie, then potatoes, onions and all the spices. Zipped it up and proceeded to mix all the ingrediients. Everything was blended wonderfully and just poured out into greased 9/13 glass pan. I did forget to add the cheese but the dish was excellent as it. Thanks...

Really great, easy way to spice up your potatoes!  WAY too much salt suggested, I would use only about 2tsp.  I added fresh garlic and 3T butter rather than olive oil. Family LOVED it!

awesome potatoes. I substituted a package of onion soup mix for the onions. It turned out with crunchy bits of onions. Even my daughter who does not like onions loved it.

This was so good and even better re-heated the next day.  I put all the ingredients (except the cheese) in a big Ziploc bag and tossed them up together then poured into my pan.  I also only sprinkled a small amount of cheese on top when done instead of a whole cup.  I will definitely make this again and again!

I make these potatoes with almost everything!  They are awesome!  Only thing is that I do not add the onion from the beggining, but maybe when there is only 10 minutes left otherwise they get too dried up.

These are pretty good, except for one problem - they are WAY TOO SALTY! I would definitely only use about a teaspoon of salt, and I would also decrease the oil to only a couple of tablespoons because they were very greasy. Otherwise, it's a good recipe and with less salt I would probably give it 4 STARS.

Now these potatoes were great. I used different spices and added a bit more olive oil and they came out perfect. Just make sure you keep them covered so the steam will keep the potatoes moist and they won't get hard. Once air gets to them, they are hard to chew. They were a welcomed change from mashed or baked potatoes. Superb!

Yum! I followed the advice of one reviewer and used taco seasoning. They tasted a little like JoJos - but better. 40 minutes was just right. My kids and I went wild for this - husband doesn't like potatoes so he doesn't count! This goes in the rotation.

The first bite was excellent.  After that it tasted too salty (and yes, I did use kosher salt).  I will probably cut the salt down to a teaspoon or two in the future.  But I will use this recipe again!  It is far better than the store-bought powder mix.
I completely forgot about adding cheddar, but the spuds do not need it.  I eyeballed the olive oil.  If using all five potatoes (I use red), double the seasoning.  I just dump oil and spices in a gallon bag, mix them up, then dump in the potatoes and onion to coat them.
Many times later: I just tried dumping all ingredients in a glass casserole dish and stirring.  It does not work nearly as well as putting everything in a bag.  The potatoes are not evenly spicy, and there is too much oil, so they never crisped.  Still decent, but stick with the bag in the future.
12.24.13 - Made it with 4 red potatoes (cut TINY), almost Tbs garlic powder, no onions, almost Tbs chili, tsp salt, enough olive oil for a sludge (for garbage plates).  Perfect (for plates).
02.02.14 - Doubled the 12.24.13 version for Garbage Plates for a party.

These were good and very easy to make, but I almost think that the olive oil could have been cut down.  They seemed a little on the greasy side.  I also didn't think that they were very spicy.  Next time I think that I will make with the optional shredded cheese and some jalapeno slices.

The potatoes tasted lovely .. I used regular salt becoz i didnt have Kosher salt. Used few garlic cloves as i didnt have garlic powder. Also added red chilli Flakes & oregano seasoning for the extra flavour.Will cut down the oil to 2 tbs.

Excellent! Have made these several times at the request of my hubby.  I have yet to use the cheese on top.  We think they are perfect without it, so why add more calories? I always use Yukons because that's what I always have on hand.  I put all of the seasonings in the oil, mix it, then put potatoes, onions and seasoned oil in a large covered bowl and shake them around to completely coat. Dump them on a foil lined cookie sheet, put them in the oven and 30 minutes later, YUM! Thanks Yolanda!

These were very good.  I didn't have kosher salt, so I just added a pinch of regular salt.  I'm not a big salt person.  I was cooking for picky people so I cut back on the onion and spices.  It was still good, though next time I will use the full amount for more flavor.  It's good with or without the cheese.

Tasty and easy!  I used several cloves of fresh garlic instead of the powder and also used a mixture of chipotle chili powder with regular for more of a kick!  I didn't use anywhere close to the 1/4 cup of oil, maybe 1-2 TBSP at most.  I cooked them at 400 as I had pork in at the same time and left the cheese off, which was optional anyway, these were perfect without!

These are excellent!  I added a bit of tex mex spice, some oregano and used a little less salt and oil.  Cook them for an extra 10 minutes if you prefer them crispier.  Delicious!

I LOVE this Recipe!! It is so good and my family loves it! We eat every bit of it. Some think it a little salty so you might want to leave abit of salt out because the cheese has salt in it too. This is a real keeper and super easy!

Great! I actually boiled these for 10 min. then drained them and mixed them with the seasonings. That way I only had to bake them for 10 min. with a couple minutes of being broiled at the end. I left my onions pretty chunky and served these with 'Actually Delicious Turkey Burgers'.  We could eat this meal again tonight!

Everyone loved these potatoes however I made 10servings and the cook time was closer to 55minutes.  Next time I think I may steam the potatoes in the microwave for 6-7 minutes before putting in to the oven and that should put the oven time to no more than 20 minutes or so.  Everyone loved them!

These were so yummy, I can not believe how good these actually were! So good that I forgot the cheese I was eating them right out of the pan.  The only things I did differently were I did not add salt, I used 2 garlic cloves smashed and then some jared minced gatlic and I cooked them in my cast iron skillet, so yummy!!!
Thank you

This recipe is so good, so simple and yet I never thought of it. I can't imagine someone not liking it. I didn't change much at all but like another reviewer said it's easier to put together in a bowl and I used taco seasoning because those people have really done their homework and have gotten that spice down pat. It's great!

This was OK, but not amazing. It seemed like there was way too much salt, even after I reduced it to half a tablespoon. I left off the cheese to reduce the calories too. I think the "Roasted Cajun Potatoes" from this site are 100 times better if you're looking for a roasted potato recipe.

I didn't find these potatoes to be anything special. I added my onions for the last 20 minutes of baking time so they would have a little crunch.

These were a big hit!  I used parmesan cheese instead of cheddar and added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  They came out a little salty; I would halve the salt next time...and maybe add some bacon bits!

Definitely love the flavor on these potatoes!  I sliced the onions instead of chopping them just because I like them better that way.

What a delicious and simple recipe! I fixed these as written with ingredients, but I did peel them and baked them covered with foil, only because my son is weird about 'crispy' food. Baked 45 minutes in my oven, but my oven is a slow one. Did not try the cheese but I imagine that is great too. A great keeper. Perfect blend of flavors for us. Will make often!

Very easy to do, potatoes were creamy on the inside.  The chili powder was really the genius here, giving a great hidden bump in flavor without really taking it to a spicy level.  My kids all loved it, and we'll make again since we've always got some extra potatoes around.

super yummy! I added paprika and Cayenne. I meant to decrease the salt and oil but forgot. I followed other's suggestions and put everything ina a bag and shook it up. The potatoes weren't very crispy but the flavor was amazing.

Simple to prepare and very flavorful.  Next time I will adjust the cooking time a little bit because the potatoes did get a little softer than I would have preferred.

Great recipe!  I did end up baking this dish at a lower temperature for longer (baked at the same time as the Marinated Baked Pork Chops) but still came out tasty.  A little too salty, but that can be reduced.  Will definitely be making again!

This was excellent! Had rave reviews from everyone and the mother-in-law asked for the recipe. I even forgot to put on the cheese and it still tasted wonderful. Plan on making again and adding cheese next time. :-)

Loved this recipe!  My husband usually doesn't like potatoes, but he liked these.  I used eastern white potatoes (because that's what I had on hand), but otherwise I used the ingredients exactly as listed.  Instead of baking them, I mixed the ingredients in a large, covered skillet and cooked them on the stove top, on medium heat, stirring every 10 minutes, for 30 minutes, then turned the heat up and left them uncovered for 5 or 10 minutes to evaporate the moisture.  They came out great, and it's easier than having to open the oven every 10 minutes to stir.

This was great the first time I made it.  With last night being my second time and  simply because I love bell peppers, I decided to add 1-inch squares of bell pepper both red & green.  It was a WOW all the way.

My family loved these potatoes! I used a 3 lb. bag of red potatoes but didn't change the original seasoning amounts. We thought they were seasoned just right. I followed Chef John's baking directions in his video for roasted red potatoes and they turned out perfectly delicious! Three pounds served 5 of us with some left over.

This recipe would have been really good if it hadn't been so salty!!!!  I used half of the kosher salt that the recipe called for (1/2 tablespoon) and it was still WAY too salty.  Next time instead of using 1/2 of a tablespoon of kosher salt, I will only use a tiny sprinkle of it.  We couldn't even eat these they were just so salty.  What a disappointment.

Just made these tonight and they were a hit!  I was a little nervous about the chili powder being too "chilish" since ketchup and salt are a stretch for my hubby.  Easy and you'd have the ingredients on hand.

These were fabulous hashbrowns!!! I substitued bacon grease for the olive oil and added a little apple cider vinegar.  As others suggested, I added some paprika and cayenne.  DELICIOUS!

Leave off the cheese........it screws up the potatoes. Try using other seasionings. I use Taco or Fajita seasonings, sometimes I use Ranch Dressing powder other times I just use Kosher salt and Fresh ground black pepper.

I orginially submitted this recipe and never expected such positive feedback!  Just so everyone knows, coming from New Mexico, the chile powder I refer to is red CHILE powder (more of a New Mexico staple); however if chili powder works, WONDERFUL!  If you have never been exposed to New Mexico Chile powder (aka chile molido), I suggest you do so!  It is an art to make it work for main and side dishes, but well worth it if you do!

Ahhh, should have read the reviews first.   Twice the amounts of salt and oil necessary, but the kid loved it!  That's all that counts.  The sour cream sounds like the pefect touch!

I made these for dinner last night to go with BBQ beans and tri-tip. Very easy, the chili powder is a great touch. I didn't add the cheese because I forgot. They were great without it.

Reduced the oil to 3 tbsp - perfect. Added 5 smashed garlic cloves for more flavour. Yummy!

It's so easy to do! i didn't use as much chili powder and i cut very small pieces off of a stick of butter to add a bit of extra flavor and i sprinkled some chive over the top before i put it in the oven.

This is my favorite recipe for potatoes. It reminds me of the potatoes I had as a kid growing up in a Mexican household with all the same great flavors.

My husband and I love this recipe! The first time we tried it I used the salt and we found it too salty. When I made it tonight I left all the salt out and we really liked it! I encourage everyone to try making it without salt--if you don't like it you can add salt to the portion on your plate, but I think its worth trying!

Loved this recipe.  We even decided to kick it up a notch and added some bacon bits and sour cream when we served them.  This recipe produced nice crispy outside and tender inside potatoes.

Hmm, I altered the recipe a bit by adding just a little bit of evaporated milk for a cheesy taste, but in doing that, it took forever for the potatoes to bake.  Overall was an alright dish, haha my potatoes came out looking like curry because of the chilli powder, but taste-wise it was to be honest, a little bland. Will add more stuff next time (:

Potatoes come out great!  Second time I used taco seasoning and it was good, too.  Also cooks nicely at 400F - the onions come out better.  I did not add the cheese at the end.

I had to bake these at a lower oven temperature and so they took considerably longer...didn't crisp up as well at the lower temperature, but next time I'll make them the right way.  Line the baking pan with foil for super easy clean-up.

I made this dish for dinner last night and my hubby and I thought this dish was very tasty.  I used a little less garlic powder than stated, added pepper and seasoning salt instead of kosher.  I cut the potatoes in small bit size pieces, placed in a zip lock bag and added the other ingredients to coat.  Placed in a 9x13 inch baking dish, covered for 20 mins. in the oven and then removed the foil during the last twenty mins.  I used pepper jack cheese for this dish.  One I will make again.

Easy and tasty.  I did not have red potatoes so I just used Idaho with the skin.  I also forgot the salt!  The flavor was still strong and plentiful.  I may add some paprika next time.

I love when recipes do not need to be adjusted. This is one of those that you can just go as is. Nice thing about it also...you can personalize it depending on your taste in spices.

Made this recipe as it says and also with added spices and it's always great.  I love the potatoes chopped up so they're really bite-size.  Cuts down on the cooking time a bit too.

I've made these twice in the last two weeks and they were a hit both times.  With money a little tight these days this is an inexpensive dish that you can stretch and it is a crowd pleaser. Enjoy!

I followed one reviewer's suggestion to put the spices in a bowl and mix w/potatoes then pour into 9x13" baking dish. Well, the first potatoes I put in got the most spice and it was too much. I suggest sprinkling some of the spices on the bottom of the pan, layer the potatoes in a single layer and sprinkle the rest over the top.  Drizzle the oil over all. Half way thru baking stir to coat. We,(husband and me) loved this recipe and will definetly will make again only next time I will cut down on some of the salt and chili pwd as I don't tolerate spices well.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe but eliminated the cheese. Served these with roast beef for Sunday dinner and everyone loved it!

These were excellent. I ran out of chili powder so I supplimented with a little taco seasoning and it turned out just fine. I tried it with and without the cheese and both ways were just as good. I did like others and mixed the oil and seasoning in a bowl first and then tossed the potatoes. I broiled on high for the last 8 minutes to crisp them. Thanks again.

Very good.  Very easy. I don't like powdered garlic, so I took a few garlic cloves, smashed them with the side of a knife, and just roasted them along with the potatoes.

Everyone from babies to grown ups liked this.  I'm making them again tonight.

This recipe is easy as as can be, and great for a thrifty side dish.  I didn't add the cheese, abut I did add some chorizo for a one dish decadent lunch.  My husband and his friend freaked out for this - I'll definitely be asked to make this again soon.

I altered the recipe to be diet friendly by omitting cheese, and I used fresh garlic instead of powder to toss the potatoes.

The cayenne pepper makes this one a keeper.

I tweaked this a little for my taste.  I used small red potatoes that I quartered and placed in a large ziploc bag with olive oil, minced garlic, dried rosemary, salt and pepper.  I let it sit on the counter for about 30 minutes and then spread on a foil lined baking sheet.  Cooked for about 40 minutes at 450, stirring a couple of times to get all sides browned. They turned out great.

This is a great recipe.  I will make this again, but next time I will only use half the salt.  It was way to salty.

Absolutely delicious!  The potatoes didn't crisp as much as I'd like but overall a great dish!  I made them a second time and with 20 minutes left on the timer, I scrambled up eggs and poured them on top, mixing every five minutes.  Added cheese at the end and you've got a great meal!

These potatoes were exactly what we were looking for! Tasty, flavorful...I think I will play around with the chili powder next time (add more?). We opted not use the cheese this time, so we can try that next time, too.

YUMMO. I added way more chili powder than was called for and used regular salt instead of kosher but it was super good.  My husband is a big potato fan so he loved it. I served it for brunch and it was the first dish that got cleaned out.

Very good....I followed advise from "foodaholic", first I boiled my potatoes until just tender, let them cool, and pressed them down with the palm of my hand for a really cool look, (check out her review and picture). I just loved the way foodaholic's picture looked! I then sprinkled each one with the spices and evoo. Cooked until crispy, I added my cheese and let that melt.....tasted yummy, might try a little cayenne next time for more heat. I also use a "patriot mix" of potatoes, which were baby reds, whites, and blues(purple), also used reduced fat shredded cheddar. Thanks for a great way to eat roasted potatoes!

These potatoes were fantastic!  I really did not expect them to be as good as they were.  The only change I made was I used garlic salt instead of garlic and salt seperately, and I didn't have any chili powder so I used some crushed red pepper.  It turned out great.  Even my kids loved them, and they are VERY picky!  Will definitely make these again...often!

This was okay. Not bad and not great. I think it would have been easier to cook on the stove top. Maybe it was me but the potatoes stuck to my cooking dish and was very hard to clean. Thanks anyway.

Excellent.  I used red potatoes and quartered them.  Not only were these good but the next day I used the little bit of leftovers mixed with a little sour cream, mayo, and bacon bits and made a great little potato salad that got rave reviews from my friends again.

Amazingly delicious yet simple recipe, I thing this one can be played around with as a side to any dish! I added chopped garlic instead of onions and it was awsome! I think you can add Mexican flavorings to make it also a mexican side.

I par-boiled the potatoes prior to baking them, this helped reduce the time it took cooking. I also only used about 1/2 the cheese and added some zucchini, onion and whold cloves of garlic to potoates while roasting. Very Delicious !!

These were absolutely delicious but my husband complained because the garlic odor was so strong you could smell it half a block away (literally!). Will make again, perhaps a bit less garlic next time.

Tasty and easy!  I made it as-is (with the cheese) and it’s a little too salty for my taste, and next time I will also reduce the oil.  Soooo good, though!

I liked this simple recipe. I used a pepper and onion seasoning blend to add some flavor.

This was delicious!!!  Definitely a favorite of mine, and one I'd like to try again and again!  I don't add salt since the chili powder and cheese already have salt.

Made just as the recipe is written.  Very flavorful but a bit too salty.  I will make again but cut the salt in half.

Gotta say I love this recipe.  My husband raved how he could "really tell he was eating a potato".  He loved how the spices didn't overpower the red potato taste.  I cut the onion in large chunks, because my husband loves onions.  The only alteration came after I mixed the tater and onion chunks with the olive oil and seasoning (following the recipe as written).  When I tasted the seasoning on 3 different potato chunks, it was SO salty.  Now, I am a certified salt-nut.  I could have MAYBE eaten as written, but, my husband could not.  I was forced to add more chili powder, more olive oil and more red potatoes to make it palatable for a normal person...aka, not me.  After those additions, the taters were saved.  So, next time I'll just start with 1 TSPN of the kosher salt.  After everything is mixed, I'll test 3 potato chunks again and see if more kosher salt is needed.  Crisis averted and new fabulous roasted potato recipe now in my rotation.

These were really good.  I didn’t make them with the cheese.  I did cut the salt in half but used the called for chili and garlic. The potatoes were a gorgeous red and quite tasty.  Thanks for the nice change!

Some of the best dang potatoes ive ever made. The only thing was that it was that it was not very spicy. I'm not sure if i simply did something wrong since I made these as close to the recipe as possible, but if you're looking for something spicy I would bump up the amount of chili powder or something.

I absolutely love this recipe! I've made it several times now and the potatoes always come out delicious--they don't need the cheese. After making it a few times, I find that my personal preference is to use a bit less olive oil and salt. However, I still think this is a great recipe and I'll continue to make my potatoes this way!

I've made this recipe 4 times already and love it! I use 1/2 tsp onion powder instead of the chopped onion.  I also mix the spices and salt together, then toss the potatoes with that and the olive oil, then pour it all into a foil covered pan.  Delicious!

I may have diced the potatoes smaller than they intended, and so it ended up softer than I would have liked, but the flavor was amazing.  Next time I will make slightly larger pieces and it will be perfect.

We have found our new favorite potato recipe!  WOW!  I was expecting these to be okay, but they were outstanding!  Followed the recipe fairly close, but I did not have red potatoes so I had to use what I had on hand which was russet potatoes.  Peeled and diced them and carried on from there.  I did not add the cheese at the end though, and honestly these had so much flavor we did not miss it or need it.  Very nice change from mashed, and oh so easy to prepare.  Will be making these again and again!  Thank you!

Tasty, and so easy that even I can make it!

I added sliced raclette cheese on top for the last ten minutes. If you're going to do that, halve the amount of salt.

These were very yummy. Thought I would give it a try. I make them in tin foil skins left on potatoes chunky then cut my onion to rings instead of chopped topped with garlic my favorite seasoning like Cajun no salt, couple pats of butter. Wrap it up and put it on the bbq. Or oven. Make sure to use non stick foil. My family craves them!

The recipe is a keeper as is. Because of family preferences, I adjusted the quantity of the onion and garlic powder to our tastes, but still benefited from the flavours which were awesome. I decreased the garlic powder to one teaspoon and used just one half of a large onion.  Otherwise, I changed nothing.  The chile powder added a smoky flavor that made the recipe extra delicious. I do not recommend that you vary the spices.  We thoroughly enjoyed and I will make again.

I've been making something similar to this for years. This is a super easy and delishous side dish. You can ad any veggies and herbs you like, zucchini, mushrooms, peppers, carrots etc. If you add veggies that take less time to cook, add them 1/2 way through the cooking process.

I can't even begin to describe how delicious these smell while baking, and they taste even better than they smell. I microwaved the diced potatoes for 4 min before tossing with the other ingredients. This shortened the cooking time quite a bit. I added 1/2 of a seeded jalapeño and greased my stoneware baking dish generously with shortening first. I used the convection bake setting and they came out perfectly crispy outside and smooth and creamy inside. Keep in mind that the cooking time will vary depending on the size you cut the potatoes. I seriously could eat these every day! I did not add the cheese - but I'm thinking next time I will - along with some crispy crumbled bacon. Mmmm-mmmm!

Promising recipe... will try again... but found this way too salty!!! Also forgot the onions... will use half the salt and remember onions... using convection roast helps to crisp the outsides and nice tender insides.

Halved this recipe for my husband and myself.  Whew!  Smelly when cooking as there was too much garlic powder and chili powder!  The taste of the potatoes wasn't quite as bad as the smell, but close. Will not make again.

Excellent and easy side dish.  As an alternative to cheese on top, try dipping in sour cream or sour cream mixed with parmesan.  It's a tasty balance of spice and coolness.

I have made this so many times, it’s a tasty reliable favorite! I endorse all the ingredients as is (I do leave out the cheese; just doesn’t need it). Don’t skip the onions though (I’ve tried)- they add needed moisture so the potatoes don’t burn before they cook through (and they taste delicious). I chop the onions into thick wedges for this dish; the onions tend to cook too fast and burn if they are thin-sliced. I stir every 10 minutes and cook for about 40 - perfection ????

Very easy and delicious! I loved the crunchy outsides. Versatile too - it's a good side dish for breakfast or dinner. I mixed everything up in ziploc bag and shook it to combine which made for easy clean up. I cut down on the salt based on other reviews, and also used dried minced onion instead of fresh since that's what I had on had. I skipped the cheese but it didn't need it!

I tried these last night and they were really yummy, albeit a bit salty for my liking. I think I'll try it next time with a little less oil and a tad less kosher salt too.  I didn't have red potatoes, so I used yellow fleshed russets instead. Flavour was great. Hubby loved them as they were and even my horribly picky 7 year old ate two pieces because, "They are kinda good."

I varied this a little. I boiled the red potatoes whole, then quartered them when they were done. Did not bake them at all. Then I mixed them in with the onions, butter, garlic powder, and chili powder and it was delicious! This got a little dry for me so I just added a little more butter. Hubby ate the first batch within a day so I made a second batch the next day. This one's a keeper!

If I could, I would give this six stars and so would the rest of my family. The only problem I had was that I ran out before everyone was served. This is so simple to make, I will have to triple the amount of ingredients next time.

Perfect...however, next time I shall omit the salt completely as it was just way too salty for our taste.  I should have known better because I never, or almost never, add salt to anything I'm preparing.  Other than that issue the dish was fabulous and I shall surely use it again and again.

I should've used onion powder because the onions absolutely burnt to a crisp. I used 1/2 the salt, and I would still use less if I made them again. I used all the oil, but I'd use less if I made these again. Great flavor tho.

A+. Cayenne pepper gives it a kick. Really could use this on any vegetable- esp root vegetable. Used it for brussel sprouts, carrots, onions and fingerling potatoes. Thanks

Oh my goodness, these are delicious!  I only made a serving or two since I had some leftover canned potatoes I wasn't sure what to do with.  I'd prefer regular potatoes with the skin as directed in the recipes, but I didn't have any.  Even so, these are awesome.  I love the flavor and the crispiness--you can get more by broiling for a short time at the end (make sure to watch it, though--broiling too long will burn the potatoes).  I was going to wait to eat these so bf could try, but once I tasted I couldn't stop eating them.  I'll definitely make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great roasted potatoes!  I opted to use a creole seasoning, rather than the chili powder, and I cut way back on the oil – used just enough to coat the potatoes.   I also omitted the onion because I knew they would burn up into charred cinders at that high a temp.   Using a cast iron skillet, these potatoes came out crispy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside.   We’ll make these again!

Just awesome!!!!  These were almost gone while we were waiting for the burgers to finish.  The seasonings are perfect.  I didn't use the onion because we are not big onion fans.  Absolutely love these and will use this recipe many, many times.

I made this recipe today. I didn't have kosher salt handy so I used normal salt and it gave me the same results and also reduced the amount of salt because I don't like to cook with too much salt. I roasted the potatoes and when it was time to add the cheese I also added sliced fresh mushrooms and the cheese on top and put it back in the oven for about 4-5 minutes so the mushrooms wouldn't overcook. Great recipe!

Not a flaw in this recipe! Turning every ten minutes is absolutely necessary. I added some jalapenos for my jalapeno obsessed boyfriend. I also sprinkled some grated (from the can) parmesan cheese near the end and it helped add to the crunchy texture. next time I will add some red and green peppers.

Was very good. But found it a bit to salty for our taste as we do not use much salt. So I would suggest cutting salt in half. Other than that great recipe

I was always afraid of roasting vegetables because they'd end up burnt on the outside and hard on the inside.  But this recipe makes the best potatoes, I have made it at least 3 times a week since I found it!  I don't add onions or the other seasonings, but instead use a spiced McCormick sea salt.  I've made it with red potatoes and russet, with and without skins, and they both work.  The first time I made it, though, I did use onions and I also chopped up a zucchini.  They almost melted into the potatoes, I couldn't believe how good it was.  Great recipe!

These were very very tasty potatoes, I didn't add cheese to avoid extra calories. Also, I had half a white onion and half a red onion on hand so I used those and it was very yummy as a result. Oh yeah and I added one clove of crushed garlic...YUM!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I serve it as a side dish to any grilled or baked dish my family of five may be having for dinner.  They can't get enough. I do double (and sometimes triple) the recipe and dabble with the seasonings depending on what we're serving, but there are NEVER any leftovers!! A DEFINITE keeper.

These are fantastic! I did reduce the salt to 2 tsp. because they were a little too salty with a full tablespoon.  No need to look further for a roasted potato recipe.

Just made these potatoes for an early football dinner tonight...they were so yummy!  I only used 1 tsp. chili powder to make them kid-friendly and I would definitely cut down on the amount of salt next time!! I also used a red onion....wonderful combination!!

We just had this for dinner using Yukon Gold potatoes.  The onions burned a bit but it was still delicious.  Mine were done after about 30 minutes (perhaps I cut mine smaller).  The chili powder adds some flavor but doesn't really make it spicy.  My two young kids could eat it.

Wow! my family loves these. I used 1 Tbsp minced fresh garlic instead of the powder. After they come out of the oven, I top them with some steamed broccoli flowerets and sprinkle the cheese on top of all, and let it sit for 5 minutes. A good way to get the kids to eat vegetables!

Delicious and VERY easy to put together! I didn't add nearly as much oil as the recipe says, and it was more than enough (I only used a couple of tbsps). I threw in some sliced mushrooms as well.

These were great!  I left out the cheese, and added just a little dried parsley.  Will definitely make again and again.

Wonderful recipes.  I threw everything in a bowl to mix instead of drizzling.  I was a little worried about the amount of chili powder so I cut back a little.  Not necessary, but I would cut back a little on the salt.  This is a side dish I will use over and over.

I made these tonight and we did not care for them. For one thing I was leary about the amount of salt, so I decreased the garlic salt and kosher, and they were still way to salty. It turned out mushy and never did get crisp.

WOW! There is a TON of flavor in these, and they were so easy to make! I skipped out on the cheese and used paprika instead of chili powder, and still they were fantastic. My only complaints would be that they didn't really need all the seasoning--I'll try cutting down the garlic powder and the salt next time--and that they took well over an hour to cook completely, but the end result was moist and delicious. Great recipe with just a few tweaks!

Delish!!! I used the taco seasoning since I didnt have the chili... VERY good! I actually preferred the onions more than the potatoes, they cooked to perfection and taste marvelous! I am definitely keeping this recipe and making it for guests next time and not just myself. yummy!

How can such a little thing like chili powder made such a difference? Love it! Now I'll have to start putting garlic powder and chili powder on my baked potatoes too...

Great recipe...made slight changes, but good starter.  Didn't add chili powder because my kids were eating them.  Added paprika and italian seasoning instead.

This recipe was only good. I made it at a BBQ where everything was spicy and grilled and it didn't really compare. So I made a second batch, added a pinch of turmeric, used fresh garlic and sprinkled it with cayenne as well as the chili powder. When I pulled it out of the oven, I topped it with fresh cilantro and the entire 9X13 was gone in under 5 minutes. The original sat sadly, weeping.

WONDERFUL. I just tossed everything together in a bowl (except the cheese) and put it on a cookie sheet.  Crispy, Brown and Delicious - I also used Pepper Jack Cheese instead of Cheddar.

Super easy, super good.  This is one of those very adaptable recipes.  I used russet potatoes, it's all I had.  I also used 1 tsp. of chili seasoning and 1 tsp. of cumin.  Delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!  Edit: Since making this recipe dozens of times, I almost prefer these without cheese (weird for me, I love cheese!).  Anyhow, so great either way.

So good!  I used four russet potatoes (completely peeled) and mixed everything in a bowl before putting it into the baking dish.  I ended up turning down the temperature part way through to make sure the potatoes wouldn't burn.  I'll make these again!

Cover with foil for a portion of the cook time, or the onions will be too crispy.

Yum.  I used chipolte chili powder and these had a nice kick.  I didn't add the cheese - just extra calories and they didn't need it in my book - plenty of taste as is.

This was a big hit in my house. Nice n spicy n crunchy. I lowered the chili amount a bit so my lil 11 year old wasnt overwhelmed, we adults would have drooled over the full flavor but it was still exceptional. Thank you!

I made these potatoes as and accompanyment to  meatloaf and boy was this great.  It wasnt to spicy for the little ones in our familt, our 2 and 5 year olds and they even had seconds.  And I my husband and I loved it, simple and easy to make and a great new side dish for us.

So easy and delicious. I did what another suggested and tossed in bowl first before moving to the baking pan. I used a minimal amount of shredded cheese and it was just enough to give it what it needed. Even though baked it really had that home fry taste. Bravo!

These were simple and tasty potatoes, but I shied away from using all of the cayenne because it seemed like a lot. They were a little bland so I will use the full amount next time.

The ONLY change I made to these was reduce the chili powder to 3/4 teaspoon because of my 6 yr old.  BUT, had I remembetred that she is NOT a potato eater, I'd have kept it the original amount.  These were EXCELLENT.  I LOVED them and I will make them in the future, for SURE!!!!

These are easy and delicious!  I used much less salt than the recipe called for.  They were done about 10 minutes faster, probably because my oven cooks kind of hot.  I will definitely make these again!

I love this recipe and so does everyone who tries it.  I made these for a potluck I was going to and the whole pan was eaten with people still wanting more.  I have made them several times since then and everytime I do people ask me for the recipe.  These are super easy to make and a great dish for home or to take to an event.  I love this recipe!!

Very good and easy.  I doubled the seasoningto make it more flavorful.  I think I might add some fresh Dill to it next time.

This recipe turned out great! I will do this again. My husband loved them too. Because I can't follow an exact recipe, I added some ground rosemary and thyme and a bit of chopped garlic. I did not use cheddar cheese, but used Parmesan instead. It really is the hint of spiciness that does the trick. Thanks for the recipe!

Versatile and tasty recipe!  But I followed the recipe precisely, and the onions charred (perhaps because I used the toaster oven?).  I will definitely make this recipe again, but possibly add the onions halfway through cooking or chop the onions into larger chuncks.

We really liked the "zing" that the chili powder offered, however, the amount of salt suggested would have been way over the top for us. A light sprinkling is plenty. Thanks!

Wow, easy to make and very delicious. I served them with Oven Scrambled Eggs recipe that I got from this site. I did use canned potatoes (only had them on hand) they were cubed and came out perfect. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

These were some of the best potatoes I have ever had, and I love my potatoes. They had a little too much kick to them so maybe a little less chilli powder next time but other wise these were great.

This was ok. I think it will be better in the morning with some eggs. Had pretty good flavor, just seemed like it needed something more.
