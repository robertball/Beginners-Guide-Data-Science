Really good, and different! It's like a kicked up V-8 variation. Definitely add a bit of salt as suggested. I used half the amount of jalapeño, but could have used more.  My hubby already asked me to make 'that green drink' again! If you're the adventurous type, try this! If you're picky, scroll on by! LOL I suspect those that didn't like this used a blender, not a centrifugal juicer.
