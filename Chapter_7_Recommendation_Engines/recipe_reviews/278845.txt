If you can't get the fennel, 1tsp five spice is a great sub. We are not vegetarian by far but this makes a great side dish to sausages, or pork chops. We normally eat our food with rice, but texture wise we prefer this dish with sausages and mashed or au gratin potatoes.

WOW!  This cauliflower turned out amazing!  I really just wanted to see how cooking a whole head of cauliflower would turn out in the oven,  and this was perfect.  I did not have fennel (nor am I a huge fan of it), so I just left it out and added a touch more paprika and garlic.  The end result was a little salty (will use less next time) but it reminded me of BBQ ribs!  Even my cauliflower-hating husband liked this..... not that he got to eat much of it.  It was so good I ended up eating the whole head in one sitting with a side of rice.  Yep- it was THAT good.

Made it, but it took over an hour to cook the cauliflower. It was delicious, but I only gave 3 stars because the time is wrong.

This dish has a unique blend of spices, a great taste, and a nice presentation!  I made it exactly as written for my husband, not a cauliflower fan, and he raved about it!  I will make this again.... and again.  Many thanks!

This was very good and yes I’ll make it again! The lack  of 5 star is due to too heavy on the salt, easily adjusted!! It needed 60 minutes for soft scrumptious bites!! Thanks for sharing !!;-)

We ended up almost doubling the ingredients to cover the head of cauliflower. We cooked it 15 minutes longer so maybe 400 degrees instead. Absolutely wonderful, this will be added to our favorites for sure.

Kind of a disaster… The time was wrong so the cauliflower was way too hard and the spices don’t work at all. Deleted!

I've made it twice now.  My only change was not grinding the fennel seeds (can't find my pestle) but I loved it.  Really delicious and easy way to prepare cauliflower. Plus it looks beautiful when it is done.  I will be adding this to my regular line up.

The first time I made this I followed the instructions. It was good but I did not like how all of the seasonings stayed on the outside of the head of cauliflower. Next time I made it I cut up the head into florets, then put the florets and seasonings into a gallon baggie and shook it up. Perfect! Seasonings distributed more evenly. I also made more sauce and then started experimenting with other flavors. We now alternate between this recipe and an Asian inspired seasoning mix. We have this once a week as the entire meal!

I’ve made something nearly identical to this for several years. The only difference is curry powder instead of fennel seeds.  We call them cauliflower “steaks”.  I will try them with the fennel; sure to be a success. Either is a side to a protein, or as the main course, vegetarian or otherwise!

Found two problems with the recipe. First, after an hour the central core of the cauliflower was nowhere near done. To speed things up I broke off large florets, put them on a cookie sheet and it still needed another 15 minutes to finish.  Second, the baking made the spice rub a bit harsh. I compensated for that by making a salad out out the florets with a light oil (I used safflower) and lime. With those changes the recipe worked well.

I would make this again. Only made 1/2 of a head as it was for two people, and we still had leftovers. I would use a tad bit less paprika, and a bit more olive oil and lemon juice in the rub. Had to turn up temp to 400 to get to tenderness, otherwise too much time needed.

Amazing!!!  Will make this again and again, and will share with friends.  Only adjustment made was to use hot smoked paprika as we like things very spicy.  In my opinion, as good as the rub is, it is the lemon juice that takes it to an even higher level.  Served it with meatloaf instead of potatoes -- and husband had seconds.  Yumm...

Next time I will put it in water for a few minutes to pre-cook a bit, as it was rather tough after cooking for the stated time.  I liked the spices very much in combination.

In theory this should’ve been really tasty. However the seasoning seemed a little bland.  The cauliflower turned out a bit mushy. I will make again and adjust the recipe accordingly.

There is NO way you can cook a whole head of cauliflower in 45 minutes at 375 degrees. After following the instructions, it wasn't cooked so I had to return it to the oven for another 30 minutes.

I don't know why cooks and chefs believe dishes can be cooked in such ridiculous short amount of time.

I'm not crazy about fennel and didn't have any anyways.  Made it according to directions. Definitely not going to make  it again.
