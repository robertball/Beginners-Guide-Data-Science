To avoid over drying I cut the cooking for the chicken to about fifteen minutes. What really made this dish however was that I substituted chicken broth for the water. The rice absorbed the broth and it had a wonderful flavor. I didn't have any pine nuts so I roasted up some pecans. It was an excellant dish which we'll have again.

A nice blend of flavors, but it can be a bit dry.  I like this recipe more if I add a handful of raisens.

I give this recipe 5 stars... everyone loves it.. I have been making this recipe for years..  The only changes I would make are to cube the chciken breasts after poaching...  add two  chicken bouillion packets.. and I usually bake it in the oven in a small roasting pan at 350.. for about 30 min.... or until liquid is absorbed...also.. I have found, that peanuts, believe it or not, make a great subsitution in a pinch for the pine nuts...  If it seems dry, also add a few tbsp butter.. and or vegetable oil... Enjoy!

This casserole reminded me of Lebanese Kibbee (a kind of meatloaf) in flavors.  I also thought it was dry so I accompanied the recipe with yogurt sauce 2 lg cucumbers, seeded and diced 4 cloves garlic, crushed, 4 cups yogurt Plain, and 2 T dried mint. Combine and serve as a side.

My husband and I found this recipe very easy to prepare and very delicious.  The cinnamon in the recipe gave the meal a very unusual combinations of flavors.

I was looking for something to do with chicken breast that would be different and I love allspice, so I tried this.  My kids and husband did not like it very much.  They said it didn't taste bad it just didn't taste good.  Maybe marinating the chicken ahead of time would make it better; it was a little boring.  I have never combined chicken and ground beef before, it is a good way to use up small amounts of both.  Maybe adding some red peppers could zip it up a little.  Thank you for sharing the recipe, it's different.

This is a very simple dish but it has a good taste. I did not add the chicken because I prefer this dish with just beef. I have tried it both ways in the past. The only other change I made was to brown the meat and then drain off the fat. I waited to add the butter until after the meat was drained. I did this because I don't normally use fat to brown ground beef and because others mentioned this dish can be dry. My dish turned out moist but needed a little more spice for my taste. I added an additional half tsp. allspice and a 1/4 tsp. more of cinnamon. That did the trick. Thanks for sharing this beloved dish.

I liked this recipe alot.  I took it to a potluck and doubled the recipe- there was nothing to take home.

I tweaked a few things in the recipe.  I added boullion cubes to  the water and I cubed the chicken.

I boil a whole chicken for an hour, with salt and pepper.  Debone the chicken.  Meanwhile cook your rice using the broth of the boiled chicken.  Add pine nuts and almond slivers to the rice.  Serve the rice on a platter with the chicken slivers on top.  Fabulous...
