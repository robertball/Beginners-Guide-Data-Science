Made this for a Christmas party and received many compliments. Left the sugar out.

I made a double batch for a baby shower, and everyone loved it! I wanted to take a picture, but it disappeared way too quickly! I thought it was very good and very easy. The pink was a darker shade than I thought it would be, but it was still fine. Will make again -- thanks.

Made this for our Christmas Eve dinner.  It was a big hit.  I frozen some of the punch and added it to the bowl to keep it chilled. (Jello mold or an ice tray would work.)

Very simple to make, a beautiful color, and good tasting with the sugar or without. Works for mocktails or a party punch. Not my favorite though.

Diet ginger ale and no sugar needed. Will make again.
