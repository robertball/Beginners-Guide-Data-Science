This is almost the exact recipe that I use for nachos. Helpful hint...mix the beans with the seasoned beef. Beans alone are sometimes difficult to spread.

I like to make this using ground turkey or ground chicken and I like to use either tomato juice or tomato sauce instead of water when I combine the taco seasoning with the browned ground meat. I use homemade taco seasoning, homemade refried beans, homemade salsa in this recipe--that really takes it to a whole other level. My boys absolutely love this. It's great for those weekends when nothing in the cupboard sounds good for lunch/dinner and you just want something fun. GREAT "dad's cooking!" meal.

Great recipe.  The only change I made was add the beans to the meat mixture.  Careful with the broiling time, mine took only 3 minutes.  For toppings I used (after it came out of the oven): green chili's, black olives, green onion, sour cream and salsa.  I will never make nachos in the microwave again, oven only.  Absolutely Delicious.

YUM! I layered everything except the salsa and sour cream and threw it under the broiler until browned and bubbly (didn't measure anything, just did it all to taste). I also added some diced tomatoes and used chopped jalapenos instead of sliced (for more even distribution). This was a perfect quick, fun dinner for tonight...hubby raved! I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very easy and tasty.  Used the suggestion to cook the beans with the meat and taco seasoning.  Here in Texas we commonly use canned charro beans (in jalapeno liquid) or borracho beans (in a beer and water liquid)rather than refried beans.  Drained the liquid off the beans before adding it to the meat. Did not measure the amount of shredded cheddar cheese, just covered the meat and the chips.  No left-overs, darn.

I tried this recipe but will go back to my old standard.  I make up my super chili with beans in huge batches and one of the things I use it for is topping for nachos. I don't use taco seasoning as it is too salty. Then I add all the toppings mentioned in this recipe. Microwave works fine also.

I love loaded nachos. You can add shredded chicken to which you heat through with BBQ sauce to taste.
Delicious!

This is the recipe I use every time I make nachos!  So quick and easy.  However, I use ground turkey instead of ground beef and added avocado on top.  I used to painstakenly spread the beans on EVERY chip but when I read some of the reviews last night someone had suggested mixing the beans in with the meat.  Genius! I'll continue to do that from now on. Great recipe!

Used "Homeemade Taco Seasoning Mix" from this site and loved it.  Did mix the refried beans with the ground beef before putting on chips, and added one chopped jalepeno to the meat while cooking. Hit the spot.

I just tried it. The dish was easy to make and really delicious.  I did add some chopped union garnish with the lettuce and tomatoes as my wife loves onion. We both loved it. 
Thanks!

Followed this recipe with the exception of Taco Seasoning. I used Burrito Seasonig instead and it was a HUGE hit. Otherwise the rest of the recipe was awesome. Made it for Superbowl, again in February and My son has been begging me to make it again....so tonight is NACHO NIGHT...
thanks for the recipe....awesome, yummy, can't wait to eat........

This was delicious! I have been looking for a good base recipe for nachos and this was perfect. I did mix my refried beans into the hamburger mixture as recommended and also added some black beans to that mixture.  I added white onions to the hamburger because I didn't have any green onions.  I used mild Ro*Tel diced tomatoes  with green chilies in place of salsa.  I layered the chips, hamburger mixture, tomatoes and olives, and cheese. Yummy!

Made these tonight and they were another hit for us, loved them! I usually don't like refried beans, but I took suggestions from other reviews and mixed them in with the ground meat (I used turkey meat). My family loved them.

This recipe is perfect as is, but I often leave off the beans and salsa and I add lettuce, tomato and sour cream. I mix it up from time to time. This is a great way to use leftover taco meat that somehow always ends up thrown out. My husband looks forward to nachos the day after we have tacos!

Had it for a super bowl party.  Everyone loved it!  Easy to make.  I also mixed the beef with the retried beans and that worked well    Will make again!

Made this exactly how it told me to except I added a few of my own toppings. Strongly suggest almost burning the meat to make it crispy.

I was surprised today that I had not previously reviewed this . I have made it for many years. Very good. One thing I have learned through the years is that it makes a ton, and my husband and I are both small eaters. So, I used 1/2 pound ground beef (and usually still have some left over), use a taco seasoning from this site (need to watch hubby’s sodium), and use black beans instead of refined (he hates refried beans). I line two small baking sheets  (the size from a toaster oven) with foil and then layered as directed (I do mix the black beans with the taco meat). Then proceed as directed. Very little waste. Great nachos!

I made it as advertised. I used a 1/2 bag of stale chips but the meat , beans, cheese and salsa made them fresh. A hearty "snack" for my wife and I and leftovers for work.

This recipe needs to have layers and more cheese.  Too many of the chips were plain.  Next time I'll layer the chips with the ingredients.

I liked the nachos, but  they came out very salty.  I used a bag of Tostitos in this recipe. The next time I make these, I will find some low-salt tortilla chips.

Tastes great but how do you serve these nachos?  We had to eat right from the cookie sheet out of the oven.  Also, everything was stuck together and it was tough eating.  We ate them though but would like a suggestion as to how to get them on a plate for individual use or maybe even make individual servings as there are only 2 of us in my household.  Thanks for sharing,  Great recipe!

Very good! Didn’t broil, but cooked at 450 for 5 minutes. Of course added more cheese and salsa before cooking. Will make again.

Love this recipe! It is easy to make & always a hitter! I cook the meat & add the taco seasoning with water. Cook that through & then add the refried beans to the meat. I then follow the directions as given. AMAZING!!!

excellent nachos! I didn't use the black olives or refried beans. used fresh jalapenos and probably double the cheese. Would be great with chicken too!

This one was a hit at our house. the kids loved digging in. We did mix the refried beans with the meat and it was a lot easier to spread. One of the kids suggested that I use more cheese some on the bottom layer and some more sprinkled on top. Also more veggies in the form of lettuce and tomatoes was requested. We might try those ideas next time.

I like to use the ‘scoop’ shape tortilla chips so they hold toppings. Also, helps to mix some salsa with the beans so they’re an easy consistency to spread on all the chips before putting on the other toppings. They’re great however you do it, though!

This was the perfect "Let's watch a movie while eating dinner" meal.  It was fun and delicious.  i followed the directions except I warmed up the refried beans before putting it on the chips.  It was easier to distribute the beans this way.

okay the nachos are great---i screwed up, i read a couple reviews that said 'no worries, the microwave is fine, no problem'---wrong!!  the recipe says bake in the oven for a reason!  do that!  unless you want a soggy bottom.  the nuker is fine for nachos that are simply cheeses levelled several times.  add anything more, like salsa, refried beans, or hamburger & it has to take its sweet time in the oven.  trust me.  & thank you for the recipe, it's great & next time i will simply pop in the oven & wait...way better deal than soggy nachos.  ;-)

I am not a fan of olives but this tasted great. I love nachos and this is a way to make them better with only a few added ingredients. Even my younger sister loved these and she isn't a fan of beans.

This was amazing!! I pretty much used everything according to the recipe. I used Tostitos restaurant cantina chips. They were a little thin. I know better for next time. This is great for football parties or so.

This was a great, easy to follow recipe for someone who has never made nachos before.

Really good recipe.  The only ingredients I used on the chips was the taco seasoned meat, cheese, and salsa. Very yummy!

This is how mine turned out. Lol I'm the only one that eats olives. Didn't use sour cream, green onion and beans. Used corn oil instead of water as well. Very easy recipe!

Very good.  As others have suggested, I mixed the refried beans in with the ground beef mixture.  I used canned sliced jalapenos on the top.  Will be making this again.
