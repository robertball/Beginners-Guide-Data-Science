First off I have tried this recipe twice. Once exactly as the recipe states and the second time with a little *doctoring*. Following the recipe as described the pancakes came out bland and didn't seem to have any flavor other than a tangy twist.  No cocoa flavor despite the addition of cocoa!  My suggestions: 1) Add one more tablespoon of cocoa powder and sugar to the listed recipe.  Don't skimp because it really takes the flavor up a notch which to my palate was perfect!! 2) Cook the pancakes on a lower heat setting then regularly.  I found these pancakes like to burn a little faster than others.  They do better at a lower heat. 3) Butter and spray oil for the pan/griddle is essential.  A little melted butter followed up by a spray of oil and you will have a hint of buttery flavor and a slight browning to the red batter. 4) Let your batter remain a little on the lumpy side. It does seem to produce better pancakes.  Let the bubbles form completely and the edges dry out a tad before flipping.  The cream cheese drizzle works a little better with a touch of milk and a few seconds in the microwave.  Enjoy!!

I doubled this recipe. I used whole wheat flour instead of AP flour--that was the only change I made. We loved this pancake recipe! Out of a doubled recipe, only two pancakes remain. This was a nice special weekend breakfast that I could make that was both easy and a nice twist on your usual pancake breakfast, which we all loved as we're HUGE pancake lovers. I'll make this recipe again, for sure.

Instead of powdered sugar and vanilla, I used 2 T buckwheat honey, and used a little extra soy milk for the glaze.  For the pancakes, I used whole wheat flour, honey instead of sugar, omitted the salt, and soy milk instead of buttermilk.  I could not find food coloring on hand, so used a beet smoothie instead of the milk and food coloring.  I know I put in a lot of substitutes here, but these are excellent pancakes!  I made them so my family could eat them!  I will be making these again!

I don't like red food coloring and had always wanted to try using beet juice in a red velvet recipe, so I tried it with this. Wasn't sure what to expect, but the color was amazing! (See photo.) I cut down on the milk so I could add the juice. I did add a bit of thickened cream though, to thicken it up a bit. I also added some extra sugar, which turned out to be a good idea. I would probably make this again, but add more cocoa to make it more chocolatey. I'll attach a photo to show the amazing red color!

I didnt make the pancakes, but I used the cream cheese glaze on the Hershey's Cocoa Black Magic Cake I made.  I had to add about 5-6 tbsp of milk to get it to the consistency I needed, but it was DELICIOUS & everyone commented on how tasty it was.

Made for son's birthday. He loved them best plain! Used white whole wheat flour, and added mini chocolate chips before cooking. They do brown fairly quickly, so keep temp a bit lower than you usually do. Suggest if you want to cook in butter instead you also add some oil to avoid burn. If your pancakes taste stale, you had an ingredient that is old, probably flour, oil or cocoa. The recipe itself wouldn't cause a stale taste. And spoon flour into your measuring cup. You can change the taste and texture a lot by changing the density of flour in a cup by scooping. We thought the drizzle was ok. Had some cream cheese frosting leftover from rolls that was better, but my son preferred plain with fresh raspberries. Son has already asked for them again.

I made this recipe for my wife for Valentines Day.  I did make the changes suggested of adding another  tablespoon of cocoa and another tablespoon of sugar.   We both thought they were very good.

I really enjoyed this!  The recipe had normal ingredients and was much easier than all of the other red velvet pancakes I've seen!  I thought they were especially delicious!  I thought the batter was a little thin but I made a buttermilk substitute and had to use fat free milk so that may have been why.  Great job!!

First time trying these was today (6/15/13).  With the  first 3 to go in the skillet, I used BUTTER to coat the pan and apparently had the burner too high, so they burned a bit.  LOL  

With the second round of pancakes (the next 3), I used a bit of oil in the skillet INSTEAD of the butter and turned the heat down to just a hair below Medium High.  They came out much better! I put the cream cheese glaze in a squeeze bottle, which made it easier to put in between the layers, in non-messy fashion.  My kid loved them!  Will make again.  :-)

This is the first time I have ever heard of Red Velvet Pancakes. It's Valentine's day and Red Velvet is my husband's favorite kind of cake, so what the heck? I couldn't find red food coloring so I made it without the food coloring. I didn't have buttermilk so I just used 2% milk with 1tbs. of apple cider vinegar. The pancakes were a little thin, but very good. I will be making these again, hopefully with buttermilk and red food coloring.

I made these for V-day.  I didn't add the red food coloring. The cream cheese frosting had to go in the microwave to be melted.  The cocoa taste was yummy.  It was good but I don't know if it would be worth the effort to make again.

I doubled the recipe as well and kept the amount of salt the same.  Anytime I make homemade pancakes, it is usually about 3 cups of flour with 1 tsp salt, so I would halve the salt but double the chocolate and sugar.  The increased chocolate made it smell so good when cooking!  The glaze is extra good warmed up!

Yum! I didn't have cream cheese to make the frosting, but I did have leftover whip cream which was amazing. I like that these have the sweet edge of red velvet, but aren't as sweet as a cupcake since it's a breakfast food.

These were great. They were kind of thick so the first few weren't cooked all the way. I will definitely make these again. I did not have buttermilk so I substituted yogurt but that's not the reason I took a star off. They were a bit to doughy and I don't think the substitution would have changed that.

I didnt like these pancakes. However, If you decided to make it make sure you add more cocoa and sugar than the recipe requires. Because it had no flavour, all I tasted was butter.

These pancakes were bland.  Without the glaze I would have thrown them away. The texture of the pancake is good but the chocolate flavor is lacking and so is the sugar.

Regarding the cream cheese glaze portion of this recipe - I prepared it exactly as the recipe states, and it was WAY too sweet.  The cream cheese:sugar ratio seems to be way off.  If I make these again, I will try a quarter of the sugar stated, and add sugar to taste.

I used this recipe for just the cream cheese glaze. This may already have been brought up, but my standard size cream cheese package comes in 8oz and not 4; so I just used the whole block of cream cheese, and it turned out PERFECT! I only used 2 Tablespoons of milk to thin it and it was awesome on my cherry bars! :D

These looked amazing, but I did not care for this recipe. Will not be using this again.
