I didn't thread this on skewers, but instead chopped the meat into bite size pieces before marinating, and then used it as part of a stir fry.  This was my first time trying lemon grass, and I loved the taste it gave the marinade.  However, it is not very edible on it's own--very very woody.  Think of lemon grass like bay leaf, some that adds seasoning, but is never eaten!

I made this as the Recipe Exchange Group Recipe for the week of June 21st. Having never eaten satay before, neither I nor my husband know what it "should" be like. With that said, we thought this was a very tasty dinner. Next time I'd omit the onion and replace it with onion powder since I couldn't taste the onion & you don't wind up eating it anyway, why waste an onion when onion powder would work better? In the future I would used dried lemongrass. I can hear the purists squealing now but honestly...I couldn't taste it. Most of us don't live in a place where fresh or frozen lemongrass is available; mine was in those little plastic boxes in the produce section and I think it was inferior. I'm also not sure I'd use turmeric again. It stained my fingernails a weird pumpkin color :) (It'll wash off!) Lastly I did not pound my chicken, I just cut it into strips and let my husband sort out the cooking times (ha!). Overall we enjoyed this recipe thoroughly, thanks for posting!

I made this tonight with pad thai noodles and the baked egg rolls recipe from this website. I left out the tumeric and cumin just because we dont like those flavors. I added a little fish sauce & lime to the marinade. I only marinated the meat for 1 hour.  I grilled chicken and skirt beef on my indoor grill and basted the satay skewers with a peanut satay sauce I made. I lived in Singapore for a year and this was close to what I was looking for!!! Its a keeper!!!

Fabulous flavor, but a bit too salty for my taste. Next time I would not marinate overnight, as I did this time.

My husband LOVES this recipe! (I do too) I use sesame oil instead of peanut (allergies) and when I can't find fresh lemongrass I use powdered.  I serve them just as chicken breasts, and they're great!  Instead of using some of the marinade as dipping sauce, I make my own, and often grill the remaining marinated onions on my george foreman when the chicken is finished.  EXCELLENT RECIPE.

This recipe is quite authentic, similar in taste to the satay found in singapore. I used kikkoman soy sauce and skipped the salt but it still turned out a little too salty for our liking. Next time I'll try a soy sauce with less sodium. Lemongrass (frozen is okay) and tumeric powder are essential ingredients for the marinade so please do not omit them if possible. It gives the meat that unique flavor and color

I've been cooking for 45 yrs. This was one of the worst I have ever attempted. There is a previous review that refers to it as "dry." This person is correct. But more important is balance. 

The spice medley is correct, but so out of proportion I wondered if there were typos. The TS of Tumeric s/b maybe 1/2 ts and the same for the Cumin. Way, way, too earthy. This recipe could attract camels from afar!

Horrible, bitter, unbalanced. If there were a way to select no stars I would.

Wow that is delish.  Made just as written  but of course it started to rain as soon as I went outside to grill so I put it a grill pan inside.   Cooked perfectly.  Make this for dinner today it was great
