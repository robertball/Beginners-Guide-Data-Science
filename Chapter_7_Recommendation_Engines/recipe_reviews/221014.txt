When I saw this recipe my first thought was this is either going to be totally awesome or completely terrible. Verdict: totally awesome!  I love that its quick, easy, and healthy! All things that I'm looking for in my recipes lately, and it helps that it's also totally delicious.  When I ran out of shredded carrots I tried it with (unsauced) broccoli slaw and it was just as good.  It feels weird giving 5 stars to a sandwich, but it really is that good.

I made this as a thick sandwich, using mayonnaise instead of cream cheese.  I also tried this as an open faced sandwich, which I prefer more!  Great idea for a breakfast sandwich!
