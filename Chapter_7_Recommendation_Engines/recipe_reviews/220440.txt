this was much to dry for our tastes.

Pretty good, but know that this recipe generates a lot of liquid, even if you were to drain the veggies (which I didn't because most of that would have been the tomato juices). I also didn't use lemon juice, I used just the lemon zest and a sprinkling of Hy's lemon pepper seasoning to cut down the liquid even more. I also added some garlic powder. Thanks for the recipe!
