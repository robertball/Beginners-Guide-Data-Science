This is a fantastic recipe..I love the slight hint of jalapeno. I made one minor change to the recipe, added some cilantro and it added a little bit more flavor and color to the soup! Thanks for the recipe.

Mr. LTH really enjoyed this soup.  I, too, enjoyed the flavor, but the texture was a bit off.  There were strings and strings of asparagus that were less than appetizing.  At the last minute, I realized I had light cream, not heavy, so I used that instead.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  This is definately worth giving a try (the jalaps provide a nice kick!).  THANKS for the recipe, Scott M!

Made this before but somehow the recipe changed.  No jalapeno or hot stuff added, just sautéed garlic with the onions and used an immersion blender.

Really enjoyed this recipe and so easy to prepare.

Made the following changes:
EVOO instead of butter.
Added 2 cloves Garlic.
Habanero instead of Jalapeno.. Ole'!
Lowfat milk and cornstarch instead of heavy cream.
Added asparagus tip in the end instead of pureeing them.

Delicious!

LOVED IT! Tweaked it just a bit though, adding 1 large jalapeño, sautéed with onion; added a little more potato so I could cut down on the cream, which I also cut by using half NF milk and half cream; skipped tobasco; added veggie seasoning to enhance flavor. Also, used a stick blender and creamed it all up right in the pot. Served with Asiago ciabatta croutons - YUM!

I fixed this soup for a family at church, doubled the recipe and didn't use the jalapino pepper because I wasn't sure if they really liked spicy food. I wish I had tripled it and the next time I will add the pepper but even without it, it was wonderful and I cannot wait to make it again.

Delicious! I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I added two cloves of garlic with the onion and skipped the dairy.  Served with fresh sourdough bread.  Soooo good.

Great soup! Even my picky eaters loved it.  I added a couple extra steps because I just can't bring myself to follow any recipe to the letter. First of all, strain the asparagus after blended.  I use a French sieve, or chinois, to extract all the pulp. Then, I boiled the diced potatoes separately and added them after blending. Also added a cup of diced cooked chicken breast and made a meal of it.  I doubled the portions so I would have a few servings left for lunch this week.

Loved it! We added cooked asparagus for another layer of texture. Although it tastes wonderful, you can eat a bigger bowl with a little something to chew in there. We added a Sriracha for heat, as the jalapeno did not have any, but it indeed added a nice flavor. We added the cilantro as suggested in another comment and loved it.

I've already rated this recipe a 5***** but wanted to edit & couldn't figure ot how to do that ! I did not add the cream at all & the soup was delicious without it. So I may need to change the name !

The soup was very tasty.  One recommendation is to use an immersion blender instead of a traditional blender.  It reduces the preparation and clean-up time.

Loved it!  I added two cloves of chopped  garlic to the onion saute and used just half a jalapeno to start. It was spicy enough for me.

Good but it could use a little tweaking to enhance the flavor. I added garlic and put out Parmesan and lemon wedges to use if people wanted and that helped, but it still needed something.  Next time I’ll try adding another half pound or so of asparagus and see if that’s what it needs.  Mine was not at all stringy, and I just used an immersion blender to mix it.

I made according to directions except for the jalapenos. Had left over cooked asparagus and broccoli so figured they should work. It turn out delicious. The flavor was wanderful. My 91 year old dad had 3 helpings. I will definitely make it again. Probably try the peppers next time.

I loved this soup more than my usual cream of asparagus soup. The jalapeno added extra flavor to it. I sautéed the Jalapeno with the onion in butter before adding the broth and the other veggies. I cooked for 20 minutes then blended with immersion stick blender and used half and half for cream. The soup did have some strings in it, which could happened with any asparagus soup, not just this one. If this happened to you just stain the whole thing before serving.

This is awesome!  Don't be afraid to spice it up a bit more.  I added garlic, extra jalepeno (1 with the onion and 1 as directed) plus lots of hot sauce.  Very tasty and easy recipe.

Delicious and easy! Thanks to tips from others that made it, I added garlic with the onion and used 2% milk instead of cream.  It was still creamy and delicious!

This may be the best soup I have ever made! I added 2 handfuls of chopped fresh spinach and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. I only blended 1/2 of the soup, to have some pieces of goodness to chew! I also used almond milk instead of the cream to cut some fat and calories. Springtime means asparagus, and this is a delicious way to use it!!!!!!!!

This was very very good.  Did not add hot sauce on first trial test, added it to second and must admit was even better with it added. Will definitely add to my "make again" list.

Quick and very easy.  I ended up buying pencil thin asparagus in BJ's and blended the soup while it was in the pot with an immersion blender.  It was not stringy.  I used two  jalapeño peppers and it was NOT spicy at all.  Since I do like spicy I did add hot pepper sauce to mine!  I would make it again.

It was great. The jalapeno I used was pretty low on the scoville scale, so it wasn't spicy, but was still very very tasty.

I made ahead of time, so didn't add cream until just prior to serving. Wife's bowl was cleaned with bread :)
