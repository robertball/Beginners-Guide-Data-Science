This recipe was good, but it was a little dry.  I think it needed a little bit more sauce.

pretty good...there's potential.  I used a can of diced tomatoes (minus some of the juice)instead of just tomato juice and put the green pepper into the pasta instead of just on top and used a 4 cheese mix I had on hand instead of the mozzarella.  Overall it was good, but i think next time I'll used a little less pasta, try it with mozzarella, use less onion (and i love onion), and add mushrooms into the mix as well.

There wasn't enough sauce- I'd have to double or even triple the recipe amounts.  We've been eating leftovers with canned sauce heaped on it.  Also, the thyme in the recipe gave it a strange taste.

Personally I love this recipe. Occasionally I will put some spicy italian sausage in there just to change it up, but its great even without it. Only thing I changed was adding oregano and basil. Its great otherwise!

This was OK but nothing particularly exciting about it.  I only used 2/3 the pasta and thought it was still too much, so I certainly wouldn't want to use all of it.  I may try this again with less pasta and see how that comes out.
