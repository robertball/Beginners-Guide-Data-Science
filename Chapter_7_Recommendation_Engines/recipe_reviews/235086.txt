This is soooo good! I've made it twice now and my husband and I both love it! And, it gets better with each day it's in the fridge! I was skeptical of the grapes at first, but the combination was perfection! The only changes I made was, I used cracked pepper and a little fresh lemon juice because I didn't have lemon pepper, and I used a little less olive oil to cut down on fat and calories. Thanks for sharing this delicious and healthy recipe!

Not bad.  Add carrots, too.  Ok to replace edamame with garbanzo beans.  OK to replace cashews with sunflower seeds.

My husband and I had this salad for dinner with some homemade veggie chili. Please take note though, if you've never eaten edamame, you must cook them first. They are poisonous  if eaten raw. Even frozen edamame needs cooking.

Refreshing and delicious! I actually don't think it even needs the cherry tomatoes; the other flavors are more than enough. I ate it both by itself and on top of some arugula I had lying around.

It is yummy!  I added kalamata olives for a little salty kick!  I add avocado only when served so it's not too mushy!  And as someone else said... the other ingredient ideas are endless!  Once I added strawberries... less grapes.  Still delish!

We really enjoyed this salad. I didn’t add the feta or use the olive oil and vinegar. The lemon pepper, basil and salt were perfect to season it. I added feta to the portion I had later. It’s good with it or with out. My mother in law loved it!

This salad was incredible. i didn't have lemon-pepper and I don't think it needed it at all. The basil, feta, and oil/vinegar combination was fantastic and the added crunch of the cashews was a tasty addition. Will definitely make again soon-- as in tonight.

Really enjoyed this recipe! I was surprised at how well all the flavors came together, sweet and tangy. Nice crunch, light and fresh. I will definitely make it again and will try mango.

liked this salad it would of been a 5 star, but grapes with bell pepper, not for me, but put every other ingredient in, it was just a grape thing, not my favorite fruit.

I made it for a company dinner and omitted the avocado because I don't like them (gasp!).  It got rave reviews,  Next time, I will add more cashews to give it a bit more crunch!  The dressing suggested wasn't really necessary and I set some aside without it so the kids would eat it too, which they did.

I made this exactly according to directions and it tasted great! I took it to a dinner party and I could hear people at the other end of the table saying, who made the salad! It is amazing!

Great cold, crunchy salad for summer time. Great flavor and easy to make! Everyone loved it. I couldn't find edemame beans at my store so I added celery instead and used yellow snack tomatoes too.

Loved this salad. Made the recipe to spec except couldn't find good feta so grabbed blue cheese with cranberries and it was a good fit. Love the nutrition info on this one too! Flavorful and healthy!
