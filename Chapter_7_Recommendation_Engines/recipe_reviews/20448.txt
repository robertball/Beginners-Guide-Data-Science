This is a great recipe for watergate salad! I tried it once with regular pistachio pudding and the next time with sugar free.  DEFINITELY use REGULAR pudding. The after taste of the sugar free is TERRIBLE! I didn't feel that the coconut added much taste & I will probably eliminate it next time.

I've tried several versions of this recipe, but this one is the best. My husband and daughter are not big fans of maraschino cherries so I substituted a small can of mandarin oranges, (minus the juice) sliced in half. It's so light and tasty - we couldn't help going back for seconds!!

This is an awesome recipe. I had coconut and nuts on the side, so each individual could put what they wanted. It tastes excellent without. Add a few more cherries for Christmas coloring. Everyone loved it!!! I even modified the recipe to feed 25. I love this site.

Overall I thought that it turned out nice. I left out the marshmallows which for my family was a plus. I think next time I will add a little more pudding mix.

My husband is not a big fan of Pistachio pudding so when I made this I didn't tell him what was in it till he raved about how great it was!! He also mixed it with alittle ice cream (he said it went good together).I think I got a couple of scoops-he couldn't stop eating this!!! He loved it, thanks for the recipe!

Outstanding as always, however, I left out the nuts for my family's taste, and I used a whole 8 ounce container of cool whip for extra creaminess and a 20 ounce can of pineapple.  It was great!

I add 1/2 c. to 1 cup chopped walnuts to this dish. This is wonderful for potluck occasions. It's important to chill 1 hour for the marshmellows to become soft.

This recipe is wonderful especially since I am allergic to nuts.  It was even better with toasted coconut (coconut placed in a 350 degree oven for 5-7 minutes)!

First, I hate watergate salad and my wife loves it.  I hated this one too, but it tastes like those I've had elsewhere, so I assume the problem is mine.  She loved it, and we'll make it again.

Just like my grandmother used to make! I make this often now that I found this recipe. I make it w/o the cherries though and sometimes add a small amount of finely shredded apple pieces, like my grandmother did.

I love this salad!  My mom always made this for family get-togethers and I make it for potlucks.  I always tell this joke about the name:  Why is it called "Watergate" salad?  Because it is a cover-up!

Light and so easy to throw together.  My kids love this one.  The recipe has been around for a long time but no one seems to bring it to gatherings anymore.  It's always the first item to be eaten at a picnic.

This is a simple, delicious recipe.  I make it with sugar free pudding,lite coolwhip, and unsweetened coconut.  It cuts down on the calories of the recipe, and still tastes great!

I have made this several times in the past. Grest recipe for something fast that feeds alot of people. I leave out the coconut and the cherries and never add nuts though, just due to invidual tastes!!

Pretty good, nothing out of this world, sorry to say.  I prefer the traditional 5 cup salad.  The pistashio pudding adds a unique flavor but a slight weird aftertaste.  I used extra creamy cool ship and added a can of drained mandarin oranges.  It actually tasted better than next day.

This stuff is soooo good!  It's the perfect light and refreshing dessert that everyone loves! I usually add some chopped pecans to it as well.  Easter is almost here, so it will definitely be on the dessert table.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe. :)

I used cans of fruit cocktail drained in addition to the pineapples, coconut, and cherries, it came out AWESOME!!!  In the middle of the cookout I had to run out and get the ingredients to make another large bowl!!

Just like I remember from church potluck.  I don't use much whipped topping and I could only find it in 8 oz size so that's all I used and it worked out perfectly.  I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  Delicious!

This was ok, I made it to add to Thanksgiving dinner and most everyone thought it was too sweet and not enough fruit.  It didn't hold up for left overs at all either, but that wasn't unexpected considering the marshmallows.

Really tasty and sweet, but refreshing. I brought this to a potluck and someone said it was a holiday dish to them - but I think it's great for anytime.

We liked it! Didn't drain the pineapple, and added a sprinkle of pecans on top. Wonderful!

Made this for a family function today. It was a hit! I only have about 1/2 of a serving left. I made 2 changes to this recipe: I did not drain the pineapple and I only used an 8 oz container of whipped topping. My mom even asked for the recipe :)

This is the best. I used pineapple chunks because that's what I had, and I used the juice because that's how other watergate salad recipes are written. The coconut and cherries are great in this. I also added chopped walnuts. I think next time I will quarter rather than halve the cherries to cut down on those super sweet bites.

I have made this every year for approximately 6 years at Christmas get togethers and it's always the first thing gone because people remember it from the year before.  My husband also requests this regularly.  I haven't met anyone who doesn't like this!!

I previously had 2 different written recipes of Watergate salad, but wanted to find the real one - this is it!  I followed this, only added in a can of drained mandarin orages for more fruit.  However, it was more white than green, and couldn't taste the pistachio, so I think I will add a second box of pudding next time. Had lots of compliments at my church group.

I took this to a party and it was well received.  I did not include the coconut, but provided it in a separate bowl for those who wanted to add it.

My grandmother used to serve this when I was a child and this recipe tastes very close to what I remember.  Very easy, light, fluffy treat.  My husband had never had it before and was hesitant to try "the green stuff" but was brave enough to taste it and gave it a "not bad".  I will probably use more pineapples and cherries, as suggested by some members, the next time I make it.

I made this recipe a few years ago for my grandmother because she was unable to cook any longer and always wanted to have it during the holidays. I couldn't find the recipe this year, but was delighted that I found it here. THANKS!

As the recipe was written, it was just average.  After making it and letting it sit for a few hours, I decided to add more fruit (bananas, clementines, and extra cherries), and more whipped topping to keep it creamy.  The extra fruit really added a lot of flavor and texture to it.  I have had versions of this with only the pinapple & coconut, but they seemed better than this recipe- I'm not sure why.

I love this recipe.  The only changes  I made was I whipped 1.5 cups of heavy whipping cream instead of the dessert topping.... I just tastes better and is better for you.  I also used colored marshmallows to give it some color.  Delicious!!

This is my favorite version of Watergate salad. This is my go-to recipe for parties, and it's always devoured!
