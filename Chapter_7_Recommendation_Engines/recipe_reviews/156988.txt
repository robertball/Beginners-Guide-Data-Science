This soup is GREAT! It is so flavorful ~ perfectly seasoned. It didn't even need the cream ~ I tried it both with & without the cream. The second time I made this soup, I used a yogurt garnish - in a squirt bottle. The yogurt was a fine alternative addition & floated as nicely as the cream. The cream & parsley are mostly for beautiful presentation. I found that the parsley sprig actually detracted from the soup's lovely smoothness, & tasted like its chlorophyll. I think a better green garnish is some thinly sliced green onions - the raw onion's enzymes actually help better digest cooked potato! I highly recommend this soup.

Made this as stated in the recipe, except that I used fresh ginger (1 tbspoon), dill (1 teaspoon) and paprika (1/2 teaspoon) as the spices... delicious, comforting fall/winter soup!

Love the soup!  I was looking for a good potatoe, carrot soup recipe and I found it.  I did not add all the herbs, since I didnt have them on hand.  I also did not add the heavy cream, and this soup didnt need it.  I added salt and pepper for seasoning and it was perfect!

This was excellent!  Good use for leftover 5 lb bag of organic carrots.  I too left out the cream to decrease fat and used sweet potato.  Appropriate for simple lunch or supper or served in my fine china soup tureens.

Delicious soup! Very simple and easy to make, I omitted the cream because I wanted to cut on fat.

Good recipe and really easy to make.  I had to add a lot of white pepper to get it to a flavor we were happy with (about 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon).  I also added some paprika for richer color and more thyme, about 1/4 of a teaspoon. You may want to take the bay leaf out before blending (I forgot).  Good flavor even without the cream.  Thanks for sharing!

Being a Catholic housewife it's not easy finding a simple meatless dish for Friday. All of my boys love this soup, even my picky eater. The cream isn't necessary at the end, but adds a nice touch. It goes great with grilled cheese or tuna sandwiches; a great inexpensive and healthy alternative to opening a can of concentrated tomato soup.

Delicious and creamy. I think I will substitute some of the cream with milk, though, as the saturated fat content must have been great. 2 cups of cream!

I changed the recipe a little. My changes were based on taste and consistency preferences. I used a cup less liquid and used sour cream instead of cream. We really enjoyed it.

I thought this soup was wonderful.  Full of flavor.  I roasted the onion, carrots and potatoes in the oven before I added them to the stock.  I didn't put cream but added  3 wedges of Laughing Cow cheese and blended it.

I followed the recipe very closely but it just wasn't good. I had to add a lot of spices to make it taste like anything. I was quite disappointed with it.

Outstanding flavor.  Only difference from the original receipe was that I used homemade chicken broth.  This probably added an extra layer of taste.

I used fresh cilantro to garnish instead of parsley because it's what I had on hand.  Tasted wonderful, especially with a good hearty bread for dipping.

This is really good and as others have said. It is not necessary to add the cream. I made home made garlic-thyme croutons and we thoroughly enjoyed this soup!
