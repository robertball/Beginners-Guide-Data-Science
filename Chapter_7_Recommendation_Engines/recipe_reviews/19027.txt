Very disappointed.  I wish I had read the reviews first as the custard did not set for us either and was used for a school project.

Not worth the effort â€“ Custard did not ever set.  Favor was great (added a touch of vanilla bean), and ease of preparation was great, but overall was very disappointed in this recipe.

I was really disappointed, the custard never set up over night.  Ended up dumping it out
after 18 hours of chill time.  Ended up making another recipe that is baked and that worked
out quite nicely.

We refrigerated it for over 24 hours but it never set. I had to throw the whole thing away.

I had NO problem whatsoever w/ making the custard, it set up beautifully and tasted wonderful.  The only change I made, I omitted the raspberries, and added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, instead of the brown sugar I used turbinado sugar.

It tastes wonderful, but the broiler melted the chilled, molded creme into a liquid.  Must use kitchen torch to avoid liquifying creme.  I didn't broil the second one, and just served cold with brown sugar and raspberries.  It was tasty too!

This was my first try at making Creme Brulee and it turned out terrible! It didn't set at all and I chilled it for 24 hours. Most recipes call for it to be baked in the oven...but this turned out terrible!

There is no way in the world that this recipe would serve 8. I have a set of professional-grade creme brulee ramekins, and I was barely able to fill 4 of them. Also, the custard did not set up until I added a 5th egg yolk. Tastes fine now, but 4 of the 8 people I invited for dinner will not be having dessert. Good think I made shortbread!

I didn't try the broiling, and I had some trouble with the texture (probably because I lacked an electric mixer and couldn't mix the egg yolks and sugar well enough), but it came out pretty well, and was definitely easy.  I only made a two-person serving, and added about a 1/4-tsp of vanilla extract.

This NEVER set! I've got in in the oven right now to see if I can recover. Another recipe says to bake it at 300 for 25-30 minutes... hope it works!

I wish I read the reviews prior to making. As like most, this turned out pretty awful. The custard didn't set as expected - I was trying to save time by not baking, but it's worth the extra effort to do so.

This was not my favorite recipe I have made but it was ok.  The flavor was good but the consistency was a little off.  I had no problem having it set up but I cooked longer to make sure it was thicker before putting it in the fridge overnight.

I used to make almost this exact same recipe. After a cardiac problem this was one of those recipes I no longer made. My wife asked me to make some today and its been so long I couldn't remember how much cream so here I am. 

For those who had trouble getting it to set it is probable that you didn't get it hot enough. This is one of those things you need to get a feel for. Try it again if it fails to set! You may even have some luck reheating the failed custard. When it's right you will really notice when it thickens. Keep stirring it lest you end up with sweet scrambled eggs. Once you notice it really hanging on your whisk strain it through a screen colander. 

I like it with 1/4 cup sugar and some vanilla bean or pure vanilla extract. I put it in ramakins (gotta be spelled wrong) like you would use with the traditional water bath baking method.

Lastly, creme brulee uses white, not brown sugar. I use a small butane torch to caramelize the sugar on top, after chilling the custard of course.  Again this is by feel and sight. Start with the flame several inches from the sugar. Keep it moving back and forth while bringing it closer until the sugar starts to meltand eventually turn to that awesome brown caramel color you are picturing in your mind as you read this. You are going to wreck a couple most likely but luckily you can scoop off the burned sugar, chill the custard again and try again. You can of course do it under the broiler but you have less control over it.
