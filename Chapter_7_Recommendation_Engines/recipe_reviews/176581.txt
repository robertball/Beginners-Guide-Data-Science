I LOVE this recipe. I make wedding cakes from my home and this is one of my go to recipes. It's a great base recipe that I use adding flavorings and extracts. The most popular one so far is the original recipe, but with vanilla bean along with the almond, and then raspberry preserves whipped with buttercream filling. I also throw in lemon zest and juice (omitting the almond) and orange zest and juice with a honey simple syrup brushed on the baked and cooled cake. This is my favorite cake recipe, great texture, crumb, very moist, but holds up when handling it to make larger wedding cakes. And holds Marshmallow Fondant (found on this site) beautifully. Thank you so so so much for sharing with us!!
 *** Just an update.*** I know several people wonder if this can adapted to a choc cake. I have done this several times now. Here's what I do: I use Duncan Hines Dark Choc Fudge. Instead of 1c flour i use 2/3c flour and 1/3 cocoa powder. I use Ghirardelli. It comes out wonderful. Hope this helps !

This is a GREAT cake that originates from  Rebecca Sutterby and as short is called the WASC. I recommend it to all. You can easily change  out the white cake mix and almond flavoring and flavor it to your liking (Lemon cake mix w/ vanilla flavoring.. etc.). I also use flavored coffee creamer (liquid version) opposed to water and sometimes yogurt instead of sour cream (in coordinating flavor). I also add 1/2 a packet of pudding mix to make it super moist(instant, dry). Also it does NOT matter if the cake mix already 'has pudding' in it. That is simply a marketing technique. I prefer BC white cake mix, but yellow I prefer DH. Make sure you sift both. The resulting cake will be pretty dense (and SUPER MOIST) in comparison to a typical box cake(it's supposed to be a hybrid scratch cake)and sturdy enough to hold fondant. If you are carving the cake, omit the pudding packet.

This is an absolute keeper. The best white moist cake I have ever tasted. I used a whipped icing and filled layers with pineapple. .I am thinking the next one should have strawberry layers, then trying a lemon  cake mix with pineapple the next time. I made this in 3 round cake layers and it took about 38 minutes to bake. So good, don't look any further. This is better than the most expensive cakes I have had at weddings. The secret to a light cake is to mix as directed but add the whipped egg whites to the batter the last minute not with the other ingredients, otherwise, you will have a denser cake, not a light one. Absolutely worthwhile. Been baking over 38 years and this is the best white cake.

This cake is perfection!  I have made a lot of cakes and this one really hits the spot.  You must try this to believe how good it is.  I made this for my husband's 30th birthday party and everyone loved it.  This is way better than some of the cakes I've ordered from bakeries.  Definitely try this and follow exactly, I wouldn't add anything.  I frosted with a simple vanilla almond buttercream icing, 3 c. confectionary sugar, 1/3 c. butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp. almond extract and 1-2 Tbsp. milk.  Make sure to read the recipe correctly to use the right size pan.  I read too fast and used a 7x11 inch pan and it came out perfectly but very high and took forever to bake at 325. I think a 9x13 would be fine also.  thank you CUPYCAKESMURF!

The baking time listed is not accurate.  Pretty much any size cake (even a little 6" round) will take a minimum of 45 minutes.  Most pan sizes will take roughly 1 hour.  Watch for a tiny hairline crack around the edge where the cake has just begun to release from the pan.  In some recipes, that would be "over-done", but the sour cream in this recipe makes the cake shrink slightly more than normal.  The exact moment of center done-ness usually coordinates with the appearance of that hairline crack.  

Also, with the new, smaller 15oz Betty Crocker boxes (not cool, Betty!), you'll need to reduce the water to 1 cup + 2 Tblsp

This is an excellent recipe. It's moist and flavourful.  I doubled the recipe to make one 6"x3" and one 10"x3" layer for two tiered wedding cake.  I filled the bottom with lemon curd and the top with raspberry jam and they both tasted awesome.  It holds up well to fondant too.  Everyone loved it.

I did make some changes - I love almond, but I was making this as cupcakes for a group of 1, 2, and 4 year olds, so I left out the almond extract and doubled the vanilla.  I didn't have enough sour cream and used about 2.5 oz of softened cream cheese to make up the difference and get to 1 cup.  Also,  I added about 1 cup of melted semisweet chocolate to 3 cups of the batter, and spooned some of each batter into the liners to make "half and halfs."  I got 24 generously filled cupcakes and one 8" round cake.  I remember hoping that they were worth all the effort. Wow - they are AMAZING.  I am definitely a frosting fan, but I could fully enjoy this cake with nothing on it at all. It's perfectly sweet, very moist, somehow dense and light at the same time - and the flavor is wonderful. This recipe is definitely in my "go-to" collection now. Absolutely yummy.

I did not like the crumb of this cake, at all, it is way too fine,  almost like a dense angel food cake, but very flmsy and falling apart. I have been baking for over 50 years, so I know I little. This sounded so good!  I did as one reviewer said and added 1/2 package of instant pudding, that may have been a mistake.  I will try it again sometime with no pudding, it may have been a mistake on my part since many cake mixes already have some sort of pudding in them to make them moist. Perhaps the brand of cake mix makes a difference.

Although this recipe has a cake mix base, it's kind of a "from scatch" reicpe.  I've always loved the tenderness of cake mix cakes but I'm also a fan of baking from scratch.  I think this recipe takes the good qualities from the cake mix and combines them with the good flavor of a scratch cake. And this recipe is not nearly as quick to put together as a regular mix cake.  It takes a while to gather all the ingredients - especially separating the 8 eggs (I made double recipe) - but it's worth it.  It really is a spectacular cake.I've been looking for an excellent white cake recipe forever and I think this is it.  It's very white - make sure you use CLEAR vanilla extract and only the egg WHITES. The texture is very tender but not so light and fluffy that you can't easily work with the layers.  It's rather sturdy.  It's just moist enough.  It's certainly not dry at all but it's not so moist that it's sticky at all.  Some reviewers claimed that it was crumbly - mine was so far from that. Not crumbly at all.  To ensure even baking, I used my baking strips on each of my cake pans AND I baked them on a double layer of baking sheets.  I doubled the recipe and it made four 9 inch pans - pretty thick layers.  I did not want such a strong almond flavor so I used more vanilla and less almond.  The 2nd time I used cake flour instead of AP. I prefer the cake flour, it made it incredibly tender.  It's excellent. Be sure to use a cake mix with NO added pudding. Like Duncan Hines White.

I used this recipe for a friend's wedding cake and it was fantastic!  Firm enough to hold up under three tiers worth of cake weight, but still delicious and fluffy to eat.  I put raspberry puree in the middle and frosted it with my favorite cream cheese frosting.

I made this cake exactly as the recipe and it was great!  It was the perfect texture and the flavor was really good.  I also made cupckaes (30 regular sized cupcakes - baked for 20 minutes) with 2 tsp almond extract and no vanilla, piped an almond buttercream frosting on them and they were fantastic an got rave reviews.  They were firm enough to stand up under the weight of the icing.  This will be my new "white cake" recipe.

Wow, after reading a ton of the reviews on this, I expected a great cake.  To me it just tasted like a regular cake mix with added almond flavoring.  Other than that, it didn't seem to change the texture at all.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I make and decorate cakes all the time and on the lookout for new recipes, but not this one.

I very nearly talked myself out of this cake and I'm so glad I didn't.  I planned on making a 3-layer checkerboard cake and wanted something that would hold up to fondant decorations.  This will now be my go-to recipe for vanilla birthday cakes.  While I followed the ingredients exactly & followed other reviewer recommendation to use Betty Crocker as the cake mix (I don't normally use box mixes), I noted that the cake mix has been reduced from 18.25 ounces to 16.25.  Since I was doubling the recipe, I bought an extra box & measured out 4 extra ounces to make up the difference.  I baked this in buttered and floured 9" pans and while my oven is pretty accurate, it took around 35" to bake.  It's worth checking as you near the cook time since oven temperatures vary.  I used room temperature eggs, etc, and baking strips gave me a perfect moist, dense cake with an excellent crumb.  Also, I did reduce the almond flavor by half and increased the vanilla by half.  The 20 or so people at the birthday party couldn't say enough about the cake.  It was WONDERFUL!  Thank you for an excellent recipe. (Since I made this a checkerboard cake, I'm posting a picture.  Check it out!)

Made this yesterday, followed the recipe to a "T"..put it in a 9x13, 325 for 25 minutes, and when I checked it with a toothpick it wasn't done, continued for a few more minutes, check it, it was done and as soon as I placed it on the cooling rack IT FELL!!  BooHoo!!  This huge hole in the middle!  What did I do wrong??  I've had trouble in the past with cakes falling. I've heard that if you over mix them they can fall...so..it tasted out of this world, tho!!  Delicious!!  I think maybe next time I will I will do it in layers.  Perhaps the altitude has something to do with it....any suggestions???  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This cake was delicious and received a lot of compliments!  We followed the recipe using a Pillsbury mix and added a package of instant vanilla pudding.  We only had a 9"x13" pan and it took ~35 minutes to bake.  We loved Heidi's frosting:  3 c. confectionary sugar, 1/3 c. butter, 1 t. vanilla, 1/2 t. almond extract and 2 T. milk.  Just delicious & we'll definitely make this again!  Thanks cupycakesmurf!

I made a 4 tier wedding cake with this recipe using Duncan Hines 16.5 oz white cake mix (4 boxes).  I froze the layers 3 days prior; heavily wrapped in plastic wrap, then foil.  They were stacked, dowelled, and frosted right out of the freezer a few hours before the wedding (and decorated with my pre-made frozen buttercream flowers).  I transported the ready cake one hour to it's destination; where it was cut shortly after. Guests from across the floor were giving me two 'thumbs up', they were going up for seconds and some thirds.  Many asked for the recipe and told me it was "the best cake" they had "ever tasted".  This is the first wedding cake I've made and will never use another recipe. It's a major ego-booster :)

Wow, I was impressed with this cake.  The texture is on the dense side, but that made it stand up really well to being filled and frosted.  The taste is fantastic.  I LOVE almond flavoring.  It kind of tastes like a dense angel food cake.  I've made it twice, once adding the egg whites only at the end and the other with all the other ingredients.  Doesn't make a difference.  I made 2 8 inch layers and filled the cake with an almond custard recipe from this site.  The custard used exactly 4 egg yolks, which complements this recipe perfectly.  I absolutely loved this cake!

This is the BEST CAKE I have ever made.  And I love to make cake.  I only made a couple changes based on others comments.  I doubled the extracts, I also added half a package of vanilla pudding.  I baked in 2 9" round pans.  I layered the cake with a raspberry filling in between the two layers.  I mixed raspberry jam with a 1/4th a package of raspberry jello (this helps it set much nicer) and added one small container of fresh raspberries, slightly mashed.  Then I made a classic easy vanilla buttercream recipe with added almond extract.  It was divine!!!! Everyone loved it and it was gone instantly!  Well matched with the raspberry too. I can't wait to try it again as cupcakes.  This will be my go-to recipe for all birthdays etc.

I honestly have yet to use this with white cake.  However, I have used lemon! Since keeping the cake light in color isn't an issue, I use 2 whole eggs, add 1 or 2 TBS of lemon extract and I think its a cardinal sin to add water to a cake, thus I use milk.  Its FANTASTIC and will continue to use this when making ANY cake mix!!! **Update** I made this with German Chocolate cake . .  added one 4oz bar of german chocolate melted with 1/2 cup water and 2 heaping TBS of dark chocolate cocoa, also left out the almond and added vanilla.  Cake was GREAT and VERY moist! Next I'm going to try pink champagne cake and instead of water use champagne, whipped egg whites and fold into cake!!  I have a good feeling about this!

I made this cake as written and it was very good. It had a very nice texture-it was moist and somewhat dense while still being light and fluffy. Still working on the ratio of vanilla/almond extract, because as written the almond flavor is a little strong to me. However, the true appeal of this recipe is its flexibility. I used a chocolate cake mix, added instant coffee to the water, and used 2/3c flour and 1/3c cocoa (all vanilla, no almond). This produced the best chocolate cupcakes I have ever had. Perfect texture, excellent flavor. Better than all of the completely from scratch chocolate cakes I have made. Definitely a keeper.

This cake came out wonderfully!  Using a boxed cake mix is the ONLY way to go.  It is so much easier.  Don't believe the snobs that say it taste like a boxed cake mix!  How, exactly, does a boxed cake mix taste, especially with the addition of other ingredients?  I am sure it turned out better than one made from scratch.  My experience with the snob's scratch cakes is that they are dense and dry.  No one has the nerve to tell them so.   I recommend this recipe.  I followed it exactly.  Thanks for sharing it!

I made this with 2 whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites (since that's all I had in the fridge -- lol) and it still came out beautifully.   I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II (I modified that recipe, too, because I only had 1 package of cream cheese on hand.  That frosting turned out wonderfully, too, even with that change.)

Great recipe!  I put seedless raspberry jam into the butter cream filling between layers & finished frosting it in the regular butter cream.  My husband isn't a huge fan of cake but LOVED this one! I made it in 2 nine inch round pans....and yes, it is just like a wedding cake yummmmmmmm!!

I just finished making these and they are delish. I combined this recipe with another by the same name. The only things I did different were to use milk instead of water, and 3 whole eggs rather than 4 whites and the oil. I also added a packet of vanilla pudding mix. I think these will be the cupcakes I make for an upcoming wedding. Wonderful with just the right texture.

I searched for the perfect cake recipe for a long time and this it!  My tips....first, use Pillsbury cake mix.  I've found that the texture is off with other brands.  Second, make sure you line the bottom of your pan with parchment paper.  Also, my personal preference is light colored, heavy aluminum pans.  Also, if you want to try something a little different...I've made with cake 1 and 1/3 cups of crushed oreo cookies & crushed sprinkles on top of the icing.  Just omit the almond extract.  It's AMAZING.  And my favorite buttercream icing recipe with this cake has 3/4 c butter (1 and a half sticks), 1/4 cup crisco, 1 tablespoon of meringue powder (in the cake section at Walmart or Hobby Lobby), 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 4 tablespoons of half & half,  (optional - 1/4 teaspoon almond extract)...mix together then add 4 cups of powdered sugar.  Done right, this cake is the best!

This IS a special white cake! As the only reviews with less than 5 stars were those from people who changed the recipe, I opted to stick with the original, and I'm glad I did! I love the big size of the 11x13, makes for a beautiful large double layer cake. I made it with the "Vanilla Almond Buttercream" suggestion from another reviewer (3 cups powdered sugar, 1/3 cup butter, 1 tsp. almond, & 1-2 tbsp. milk). The icing was fantastic, but do NOT refrigerate it unless you want it to get pretty stiff. I also made may cake with a strawberry filling. Will definitely make again!

Wedding cake is my absolute favorite!  I've been disappointed in the last couple of wedding cakes I've had in recent years.  It seems every bakery these days shortcuts with plain old box cake mix and fancy icing.  I had been looking for what I consider a traditional dense wedding cake recipe.  This one meets and exceeds my very high standards!  This is the wedding cake I remember from 30 years ago!  So fantastic.  You need look no further for the perfect cake.  This is it, folks!

OMG-I made this for my parents 50th wedding anniversary party and it was a huge success.   A lot of guest were asking for the recipe and couldn't believe that I made it from scratch.  My mom is a professional chef and baker and loved this.  My father had been ill with a serious health problem and had several slices.  The only change I made was to bake them in two round cake pans.  This is one recipe I will be making again.

Excellent! I have been thinking about this cake since I made it! It would be great as a wedding cake or just as a birthday cake for anyone. It also didn't dome up in the middle, so it was perfect for tiers.

I love this recipe it makes such a moist cake that is dense enough for fondant or shaping, freezes well without losing flavour or moisture, makes awesome cupcakes as well, 30 from 1 batch. 
I omit the salt, omit the almond extract and double the vanilla and use whole eggs for the egg whites. 
For a chocolate version I substitute half the sugar with cocoa, for lemon I substitute 1/4 the water for lemon juice, for orange(creamsicle) substitute 1/2 the water for orange juice concentrate, for cappuccino I add 1 tbsp instant coffee and substitute the water with coffee, frosted with Rick's Special Buttercream and dust with cocoa and cinnamon.
Everyone raves about this recipe!
The baking time is off in the recipe, usually my cakes take about 35 minutes, cupcakes around 22 minutes.

ok _ I almost didn't make this - those that loved it...LOVED IT!  And those that didn't cursed it and insulted it...well you get my drift.  Made this for bookclub - THE DAMES LOVED IT MORE THAN MY SOUPS!  Definitely will make again!  Beat the egg whites separately and fold in - it's divine that way!  Made with buttercream icing from this web site.  Whipped raspberry preserves with the icing for between layers.

Although the boxed mix flavor was still noticeable (to me), I can't hold that against it, because all in all this was probably the best white cake I've ever tasted. Made with 7/8 cup sugar, lite sour cream, and 8 TBSP boxed egg white, this recipe makes 29 cupcakes at 132 calories each. Thank you for sharing!

This cake is really good and it was easy enough for me the amateur baker. It did take a little longer to bake than stated but I did use round pans. I also used clear Vanilla to ensure I didn't get any funky coloring. Thnx for such a great recipe. I also like the small amount of oil. Not greasy n very fluffy n moist.

I love this cake!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe and it turn out so moist and tasty.  Great comments from friends/family who LOVE cake, best one they ever had.  I used the coconut cream cheese frosting, tasted great together!  Thanks for sharing, I will definately be using this again.

I have made this as is, and I have made it in different varieties - both have gotten so many compliments. Recently, I made it (as chocolate cake, following Tami Baity's suggestions of 1/3c cocoa powder with 2/3c regular flour, and Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge instead of white cake mix) in alternating layers with a strawberry cake, also from this site. The chocolate layers were filled with chocolate fudge buttercream, also from this site. I got a ton of compliments on both the strawberry and the chocolate, but I think this recipe has the edge on both taste and structure for wedding cake. This is my go-to recipe for pretty much any event!

I've made this a few times, and it has definitely become my FAVORITE cake.  Notice that it's supposed to be baked in an 11x13 inch pan, not a normal sized cake pan.  I make mine in a normal size pan (9x13), and then make 6 cupcakes with the extra batter.

Thank you so much for a delicious cake! I'm not above taking any shortcuts, especially when something comes out tasting this good. I needed to bake 100 cupcakes for a surprise birthday party. My daughter-in-law wanted only chocolate & vanilla so I decided that they would be the best chocolate & vanilla cupcakes I could bake. I made an excellent choice with your recipe. The chocolate will be the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe, also from allrecipes. Because we are making a golf course out of cupcakes, I didn't want them to be too full so I only filled the liners 1/2 full and they were perfect. It made 38 cupcakes! They smelled so good that I sampled one right out of the oven without frosting and I knew I had a keeper. I will never bake any other white cake again. All of you wonderful people here at allrecipes make me look so good!

This cake was super easy (you basically dump everything in and mix it) and very moist and delicious. It tastes just like wedding cake. I used half the amount of almond extract and it had a nice subtle almond flavor. I used the "Claudia's Yummy Frosting for Cakes and Cupcakes" (also super easy) and it was so delicious. Would make again for sure. I made it as a layer cake and it worked great.

I'm still scratching my head on this one.  Everything was done properly and the cake turned out, but it tasted just like a box cake, so in my opinion, why bother going through more work and ingredients to get the same type of result?  Couple tips for people who want to make this recipe:    1) I used two round pans (9") and it required 35 minutes in the oven.    2)  Watch out on your cake mix boxes as the brands are now shrinking their cake mix sizes!!   3)  I didn't really notice the almond taste, so if you want it, I would up the amount.  Bottom line is that this was okay, but I would have been just as happy if I stopped at the box mix.

this recipe works really well for tiered cakes -- i have even substituted devils food cake mix for the white and made a grooms cake -- it came out wonderful -- great texture either way (white or devils food)  also, i don't even use the oil in the recipe and it turns out just fine

Absolutely delicious!! Everyone RAVED that it was better than some professional wedding cakes. They went NUTs over it!!! Here are a few things that I changed per other reviewers.... I did one full white box and a little bit less than 1/2 c. of another box to get the full 18.5 oz, 3 full eggs, 2 tsp of almond, milk and then followed everything else on the ing list. Then  I did a raspberry puree for in between the cakes. Raspberry jam, 1/2 box of raspberry gelatin, and then 1 sm box of mashed raspberries. Made homemade buttercream with almond.....DELICIOUS!!!  It is so moist, but perfectly dense to hold up to the frostings. YUM!   Will absolutely make again!

I had a feeling this cake would be great because it was recommended to me by a very talented baker. I had the task of baking a cake for a 2 year old's birthday party. The cake was sturdy enough to remove from the pans and decorate without any issues but it was also extremely moist and went over in a huge way with the people at the party. One person said she liked it better than the cake she always orders from her favorite bakery. I filled it with a mocha filling and topped it with cream cheese frosting. Will definitely be making this one again.

This was a really great cake. I need to do a wedding cake for a friend on short notice and used this recipe. It turned out amazing. They wanted one of the layers to be strawberry so I omitted 3 tablespoons of sour cream and added 3 tablespoons for fresh strawberry puree and 2 teaspoons of strawberry extract instead of the vanilla and almond. It was the best strawberry cake I have ever tasted. I will use this recipe for more cakes in the future.

Whenever I look at a recipe review I always look at the low scores first.  One of the biggest complaints was that this recipe tasted like a "boxed cake".  It did a little but that's understandable considering the base is a boxed cake.  With that said, it is a really, really good cake.  I made it for my in-laws 50th wedding anniversary with a raspberry filling and marshmallow fondant (found here as well).  The cake was a total hit.  Moist, dense and really good.  The only thing that I found was a bit lacking was that it could have had a little bit more almond taste.  Maybe next time I`ll add another 1/2 tsp more of almond extract.  But I'll make it again for sure.  Thanks for posting.

Fantastic cake. Very moist. A bit more dense than straight box cake mix, but not quite dense enough for carving cakes. I've used it for carving, but only cause I hadn't found a better option yet at that time. The cake's great for stacked wedding cakes though, and cupcakes too. It's a very good white cake base that you can alter with extracts and flavors to your own taste (I like using vanilla, almond and butter flavoring, a little less than 1tsp each). You can even use different flavors of cake mix, like lemon or spice, pretty much every flavor but chocolate (I suggest using a completely different recipe for chocolate cakes). Bake times will vary depending on the size of your pan, so just keep an eye on when it starts to set up and test with a cake tester or tooth pick.

This cake deserves a 5 star +!  White wedding cake is my all-time favorite cake and this cake taste just like it.  I baked it in two pans and froze one of them.  I removed it from the freezer about a month after I froze it and it still tasted wonderful.  I'm sure this is the only white cake I will ever make again.  Thanks Cupycakesmurf for sharing this fantastic recipe.

I have a new "favorite" wedding cake recipe!!  This cake is SO moist and SO flavorful.  I just baked a large wedding cake using this recipe and EVERYONE at the wedding was raving about how good & how moist the cake was, including the hostesses at the location.  I used crusting buttercream icing.  For the largest layers, I reduced the oven temp & increased the cooking time.  For a 16" layer, it took a little over 90 minutes to cook through at 300 degrees.  For a full 16" x 2" layer, it took 2 1/2 recipes.  Also, since I was doing so many recipes, I didn't want to separate that many eggs, so I bought the liquid egg whites and used 3/4 cup for each recipe, which worked really good.  As another review stated, if you want a truly white cake, use clear vanilla; otherwise will turn out to be somewhat of a "yellow" cake.  GREAT recipe...highly recommend if you want to serve a cake people will remember!!

This is an excellent recipe. I made it with a raspberry buttercream icing. As others pointed out, the boxes of cake mix are only 16.5 ounces. I added just under a 1/4 cup of cake flour to make up for the difference. I also baked it in two 9 inch round pans. It took 35 minutes in the oven. The cake came out perfect. It is very dense, almost like the consistency of angel food cake, but it is very moist and delicious. This is will definitely become a regular for occasions.

This recipe was fabulous. The cake came out moist, great texture, tasted delicious and it was easy! I made this cake for my husbands birthday and it was a hit for the whole family. I followed the recipe as is and used two 9 inch pans.  Will definitely make this again.

I have used this recipe several times with huge success. I have made two wedding cakes using the original white version. I did omit the almond extract, to make it a vanilla cake. I made another wedding cake with the lemon version. Very good!! A keeper!

I made this cake for a birthday party. I also made a chocolate cake for the same party. This one was the favorite out of the two for everyone. I didn't add almond because I didn't have any so I doubled the vanilla. Delicious! It's more like a pound cake with out all the fuss of making an actual pound cake. I added a layer of raspberry filling to make it extra special - and it was! It also held up well under fondant. Very good cake. I will use this one again.

Used this for my first wedding cake and it was a huge hit.  I made five tiers, some white and some chocolate and used a cream cheese frosting.  In the white cakes I used imitation almond because of nut allergies in the family, so I added a tad extra.  In the chocolate cakes I replaced the almond with rum extract.  All the baking was done Wednesday for a Friday wedding and the cakes stayed perfect.  I overheard tons of guests going on about how awesome the cake was, so it is definitely a recipe I would use again.

Great recipe, I have used it 4 times now for cakes and cupcakes. There are so many ways you can modify this recipe. The cake is firm but moist, will easily hold fondant, and can be hollowed out for adding a filling inside a cupcake.  I've done lemonade, raspberry, pink lemonade frosting and fondant. I am just a home baker for friends and family, so you can do it too! I got 36 normal size cupcakes out of this recipe. Thank for this good all purpose recipe. Enjoy!

Moist yet sturdy enough if you're carving your cake.  I did find that the almond extract needed to be doubled for its flavor to come through at all.  Also, if you don't care about keeping the tint of the cake white, you can cut back to 3 eggs leaving the yolks in.

I made this cake last night in hopes that it would be what I was looking for and WOW, it was!  This cake is a heavier cake that you can handle and move and it not tear or crack. The almond flavoring is an absolute must! Dont skip the almond! This cake taste better than any store bought cake I've ever had! Im using this for a baby shower cake and will decorate it tonight after letting it sit overnight in the fridge. I always make a cupcake on the side to taste the cake before I use it and it is one of the best flavored cakes I've ever eaten. I stuck with the recipe as is, just made it into a large round 12-14" pan. No one will ever know this is from a boxed mix!  I can see using this cake and adding strawberry filling into the layers for a "wow" cake for a special event. I cant wait to play with different fillings & designs using this recipe.  THANK YOU THANK YOU for a fabulous recipe!

Used this for the first time for my daughter's first birthday cake with a buttercream icing! It was delicious and a big hit with family and friends. Used it again for her second birthday and my husband requested it for his birthday. This is one of my new favorite recipes!

This cake ROCKED! Gotta say, I was kinda weirded out about adding flour and sugar to a cake mix, but it totally worked! I made it into a Rainbow Cake using lots of food coloring and decorated at like a Butterfly. Super easy and great flavor. I will for sure make this again!

This cake turned out absolutely wonderful and was the RAVE at a recent family celebration. It has already been requested for our 4th of July gathering decorated like the flag!  I did increase the almond flavoring by about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 tsp. I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan and it took about 40 mins to get done. I could not find an 11 x 13 pan that the recipe calls for anywhere. I have an 11 x 15, but couldn't decide if this would make the cake too thin. Can anyone tell me where to get the right pan? Please advise.  I iced the cake with another reader's vanilla almond buttercream. The icing was fab, but again I increased the almond flavoring to 1 tsp. We Southerners do love our almond!

I followed the directions exactly. The cake had a distinct boxed flavor but I could not taste the almond flavor.  It was too dense.  If your looking for an almond cake, the almond bundt cake is a better choice.

This is the perfect white cake! I made an 8 inch double layered cake, and it could not have been easier to assemble or decorate. It was dense yet moist as others have stated. It tasted homemade with a great vanilla flavour, I did not add the almond as I didn't have any, but doubled the vanilla and it was perfect, thanks for the perfect doctored up box cake mix recipe.

This is a fail-proof recipe that I've used countless times. It's always great- taste, texture, moisture. I usually add a little more vanilla and less almond. I love that it's more dense than a box cake and doesnt have that generic box cake taste.

this was very moist, but any cake with added sour cream usually is. i didn't add pudding, and it wasn't needed. the almond is nice, but this did taste like cake mix. held up well under fondant. i might use this again but with filling and other extracts and zest, etc, to liven up the flavor. i'd rather make my own from scratch ...

Moist but not dense, assertively almondy-- I really like this cake.  I made it as two nine inch layers and baked it quite a bit longer than 25 minutes (at a guess, at least 35).  I substituted nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream and it seemed to work just fine.

This cake TASTED LIKE A STORE CAKE!!! IT DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL. Since my family is use to home made cake they did not like it like they liked the other cakes I make. I mean the kids ate it and said it was good, however, they said it taste like the ones I have purchased at the supermarket. Personally I don't understand using a Box Cake with a home made recipe....

I made this for a 3 tiered wedding cake with a raspberry filling and almond buttercream.  It was fantastic and got rave reviews.  This is my new go to white cake.  I will be trying it with a chocolate cake mix this week as I need a dense cake that will  hold up to fondant.  I will sub out the almond with espresso.  I also learned a trick to get completely even layers right out of the oven that don't need to be trimmed before stacking.  Only spray the very middle of your cake pans, cover with a parchment circle and spray just the middle of that.  No spray or grease on the sides of the pan at all.  Works like a charm every single time for even layers that don't need to be trimmed. This has saved me lots of time in pan prepping and decorating.  Happy baking!

Made this in heart shaped mold today.  To compensate for manufacturers' downsizing to 16.5 oz, add 1/3 cup sifted flour and scant 1/2 tap baking powder.  I also used half almond and half vanilla extract.  Delicious!

The first time I made this cake, about a year ago, it was fantastic. It was moist, with a fine dense crumb. The last 3 times I've made it, it just do sent come out right. This most recent try I used Duncan Hines white cake mix. I do see on the box it is now 16.25 instead of 18.25. Mb that makes a big difference. This time the texture was completely off. It was not dense, it was semi dry and tasted more like an angel food cake. It also had holes in it throughout. Nothing at all like the first try. So I can see how this cake is getting so many differing reviews. So I will try next attempt with Betty crocker or Pillsbury and adjust liquid to the smaller amt in box mix. BTW, the first time I followed recipe to a tee. I'm also going to see if I can find the site I originally found this recipe and make sure I'm not forgetting anything. Very frustrating, because the 1st time was awesome, and I just can't seem to get same results. I will update this after I have experimented using different brands of cake mixes. Hope I can fix it.

I recently made his cake for my daughter's graduation party, and everyone loved it!  Since I needed to make a sheet cake, I did alter the recipe just a little so it would raise appropriately.  I added a teaspoon of baking soda into the sour cream, and let it expand a bit, then just gently folded in the baking soda-sour cream mixture last, after all other ingredients were mixed.  I also added one extra teaspoon of vanilla and eliminated the almond extract.  This cake was super moist and delicious! I frosted it with a simple whipped butter cream frosting smoothed flat so that I could decorate it.

I used this recipe for my birthday cake. I used Chobani plain 0% instead of sour cream (no one in my family likes sour cream in a cake), all almond extract, and added a packet of instant vanilla pudding. I made a 4 layer (2 8 inch rounds) and filled and topped it will a simple almond buttercream. Everyone loved it! This is a keeper!

Made the cake with a raspberry mouse filling and it was a hit. My husband requested an almond cake for his birthday because it reminds him of our delicious wedding cake.  This was a VERY close replica.  I was worried because after I assembled all of the ingredients, I noted on the cake mix box that it was only 16.25 ounces, not the 18.25 needed in the recipe.  Still turned out great!

Just made this cake and followed the instructions exactly. It filled two 9" cake pans to the very top, fully cooked. I haven't tasted it yet but I know it's going to be perfect. I live in a high altitude area and it baked perfectly.

I had high hopes for this recipe because all the positive reviews but I'm disappointed. It taste JUST like store cake mix with almond extract added...actually way sweeter then cake mix. Does not taste home made at all and is so sweet, I don't know if I should put frosting on them!

My mom loves almond flavouring so I made this cake for her 85th birthday and she loved it.  I baked it in 2 - 9" cake pans and it was very tall!  I made frosting with 1 cup butter, 4 cups icing sugar, almond extract and enough milk (1/2 cup?) to give a rich, thick consistency.

I made this recipe as written  the first time and was very pleased.  I  baked 12 dozen cupcakes and had many compliments.  The next time I used it, I added whole eggs and was still very pleased with the results.  Now, I adjust the flavorings depending on the type of frosting I am using.  I highly recommend this recipe.  FYI...I get 36 cupcakes from one recipe.

Excellent cake. I made cupcakes with it and there was enough batter to make two dozen. I cooked the cupcakes at 325 for 20 minutes and they still came out really moist. I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time and I will definitely make it again.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes, and they turned out great. The recipe made 27 medium-sized cupcakes. The cake had a nice flavor and texture and was very moist. I topped the cupcakes with almond buttercream icing - so good. I sprinkled some with coconut, some with sprinkles, and some with chopped almonds. I'll definitely use this recipe again. We had white almond flavor for our own wedding cake, so this recipe brings back nice memories!

100 cupcakes using this recipe and how good were these? I've had this one saved for quite sometime and hadn't had an occasion to really use it until now. LOVED IT.  One recipe made exactly as is written makes 36 regular sized cupcakes. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Topped with a chocolate buttercream and they were as pretty to look at as they were good to eat. Excellent recipe.

The taste was nice but tasted like box mix with a little added flavor. It was just a very soft cake that was hard to put frosting on or decorate. When trying a the cake would crumble in parts and even fall. My cake was completely cooled while I had the problem. I would not make this cake again. I would just use a box mix and add the almond and vanilla extract.

Gotta say, I was really scared to make this cake. I love cooking and baking, but don't do very many cakes, as I am not much of a cake eater....however, it sounded sooooo good....and I was not wrong! I made it first back in March 2010 and I ended up making it (for the first time) for a large group of people at my mom's catering business. The company was having a special dinner there, and I knew no one, so it was a big risk..but.. It was a huge hit! A woman who does not like cake came up to my mom and told her that it was so good, she had to get more! The company even wrote up a little blurb about it on their website!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it. Have made it many times since then, and hubby cannot keep his hands off. Kids also love it as birthday cake. I will always make this recipe when needing a cake again!

I have made this 10 times now.  I make it exactly as is - the only thing I change is that I sometimes sift the dry ingredients (depending on the cake mix).  This recipe never fails, and goes well with myriad flavors of frosting/icing.  This is my go-to white cake.  Delicious.
Edit: have now made a 'snickerdoodle' version, and just today I made the original with blackberry preserves between the two layers, with a light cream cheese frosting.  The doctors thought it was completely from scratch, a huge hit.  This recipe is fail-proof.

Made as is and it really is great! I don't think I would use any lowfast ingredients. You need the fat for this cake for taste and structure. Update: I made this again and frosted with the Baker's white chocolate cream cheese frosting recipe. Cream one 8 oz cream cheese with 1/4 cup butter or margarine add 1 tsp. vanilla and melted and slightly cooled 6 oz. of white chocolate and beat in 2 cups powdered sugar. Delish!

Made this yesterday for my daughter's birthday! It was delicious! So moist and flavorful, definitely a keeper that will be made often! Used a half package of pudding in it as another reader suggested and filled it with Almond Custard Filling found on this website. Topped it with Wedding Cake Icing also found on this site. One of the best cakes I've eaten!

Perfect first time out! The only thing I did was add a 1/4 cup flour since the cake mix was only 16.75 oz but the texture was divine! Also whipped the egg whites with a fork and added them at the very end just before baking.  Baked in two 9 inch rounds for about 35 minutes. Frosted with a to die for butter cream and raspberry filling. So many ways to change this up. Going to try an amaretto extract in place of the almond next time.  Definitely keeping this one!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE

Excellent cake and so simple to make.  I followed the instructions exactly and added 2 Tbsp flour to compensate for the shrinking cake mix size.  Baked in 3 eight inch layers for 20 minutes. Perfect.  Will make again with other flavors of cake mix.  Thanks CUPYCAKESMURF :)

I made this cake for a baby shower and everyone loved it.  It was very easy to make.  I doubled the recipe and added a small box of instant vanilla pudding as another reviewer suggested. It was very moist and the flavor was delicious thanks to the almond extract. I baked it in a 12x18 cake pan (1/2 sheet). It fit perfectly. I highly recommend it!

I made this cake as a 'test cake' because I have been trying to find a better cake to use for my wedding cakes.  I am very pleased with this recipe.  Day 1, the cake was flavorful, dense, moist and easy to handle.  Day 2, the cake is even better.  I was amazed with the lack of crumbs in the plate when we ate it.  Can't wait to use it next week.  I feel it's going to hold fondant well and transport without problems.

I love love love this recipe! The cake holds up well to decorating and tastes very light! My only problem is that 18.25 oz boxes of cake mix can no longer be found! I try to adjust the recipe a bit, but I get varying results depending on brand.

GREAT recipe. I used it exactly as is except used doubled the almond extract. I also used a "moist" cake box mix. I used pilsbury cream cheese icing thinly iced. The cake was completely gone at the end of the birthday party - 6 adults and one picky 9 year old who loved it! It did take about 45 minutes, not the recommended 25 as listed on the recipe. Oh...I also used a 9x13...UPDATE: just made this for a second time and did the same as above but added sliced almonds to the top of the icing and it was fantastic!

I make lots of cakes and wanted to like this recipe but didn't. I think a plain white cake mix would have been better. The cake tasted like flour and the texture was "gummy" for lack of a better word. It took longer to bake than mentioned....maybe due to the lower oven temp. of 325 degrees instead of 350. If making this cake for a special occasion, please test this cake out and make sure you like it before your special day.

The oven temp and bake time did not work for me.
After 25 minutes the cake was still very wet.
I upped the temp to 350* and baked another 20 minutes.

It was great, delicious, moist, and dense as described.
Just like the white cakes I love at weddings
I will make again
Thank you for sharing it.

let's just say.... WOW! I SO appreciate this recipe on so many levels! It is versatile, easy to change around to suit the needs of different palettes and it cuts BEAUTIFULLY! I made this for a childs birthday cake, approximately for 40 people, vanilla flavor all the way, it was excellent, and did NOT add the vanilla pudding mix like some mentioned, even though I had thought I should initially... and it was one of my best cakes ever. I finished it all off with a coconut buttercream frosting and had so many compliments on the texture and flavor, not too wet, not too heavy, not too crumbly... it was just very rewarding to finally find a cake i can make without worry as to how it will come out. OH and it is a BEAUTIFUL WHITE cake when it is finished baking. I make cakes from my home as a modest extra income and this one will probably be the one to bring in the "clients"! Thanks a lot.

I did not care for this recipe. It's dense and gummy, with a raw flour taste. I have a degree in baking and pastry, and do a lot of cakes, so it's not that I don't know what I'm doing.

I recently made this for a wedding cake and it turned out fabulous! I've never had so many compliments on a cake.  I followed the recipe but omitted the almond flavouring and doubled the vanilla.  The cake was level and cut well.  It was still moist days later. It froze well too.  Wonderful recipe!  I have another one in the oven right now for my mother's birthday tomorrow.

WOW GOOD. I think I have finally found my go to cake recipe. The 2nd time I made it I only had a yellow cake mix and I switched out the last 1/3 cup of water for amaretto liqueur for a more almond-y grown up cake. Both cakes came out perfect!

I gave this recipe to a friend (she loves to bake) to make my neice's and my son's birthday cakes.  We knew we wanted a recipe with sour creme and lost our personal recipe.  This recipe is Ohhhhhhhhh so good!  So dense yet so moist; so much better than regular out of the box cake!  My friend also just loves the recipe too! Very easy and veryyyyy decilious!  Every cake or cupcake she makes now uses this recipe; and the Easy Bavarian Creme recipe from this site is the biggest hit with it!  She has been taking the filled cupcakes as samples to church and within a month she has had 6 request to make cakes for people. :)  Everyone is VERY impressed!  Totally recommend this recipe.....give it a try!!

I am only giving this recipe 4 stars as i have made this 2 different ways now. The first time i made it as cupcakes for my daughters birthday snack at school and it turned out good. The 2nd time i made a few changes. I used confetti cake mix and added half a pkg of vanilla pudding mix (instant) and also added 1 cup of white chocolate chips.  I was making a double layer cake so i placed in 2 round cake pans and baked until light golden brown on top (about 30 min).  The results were AMAZING!!!  I used a cream cheese frosting and it went great with the cake (although i could have eaten it without the frosting). I made the double layer cake for my daughters birthday party and she loved it, in fact everybody loved it.  The few changes really made it a cake to remember.

I was just browsing through my recipe box and happened to notice I haven't reviewed this recipe. How is that possible? I have made this so many times now and it is AMAZING. I do prefer using all vanilla extract, no almond (though that's good too), but that's the only change I make. I've tried several other white cake recipes and this is by far the best. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever bother to try another totally-from-scratch white cake, because this is perfection.

I used this recipe to make my first wedding cake last week.  It was great!  Everyone loved the cake.  I got so many compliments on it.  The only change I made in the recipe was to double the almond and vanilla extract.  I could not believe how moist and flavorful the cake was.  I actually made the cake on a Thursday and frosted it that same day.  The wedding was on the following Saturday and the cake was still moist.  I highly recommend this recipe.   I chose this recipe because of all the good reviews it got and I was not disappointed.  I will definitely make the recipe again.

DELICIOUS and easy. Thanks for sharing! I took another reviewers suggestion and whipped the egg whites before adding. I am wondering though if less flour might be OK?

Awesome flavor!  I doubled the recipe to make a 10" square and 8" square layered cake.  Used fat-free sour cream and half Splenda for the sugar.  This held up wonderfully when cutting into layers.  I baked the cakes together and removed the 8" at 55 minutes and continued baking the 10" for a total 70 minutes.  The 8" was perfect, the 10" was slightly over baked.  Since this was a practice run for a wedding cake, I tried three different fillings from this site: Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting  (super, but so overwhelming that the almond flavor didn't come through), Special Buttercream Frosting (using Almond extract), and one made of raspberries.  All tasty, but enjoyed raspberry best and I am always a chocolate/caramel girl before fruit flavors any day!  The crowd had pretty even reviews and all were enjoyed.  We covered the cakes with the Marshmallow Fondant  recipe on this site and once we got the hang of it, it went well!

This is a fabulous cake!  Super moist and dense, however I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a little too sweet.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will only use 1/2 cup sugar.  This is definitely a must try recipe.  a 9x13 pan yields a tall  cake, but it did take longer to bake than the recipe indicates.

Great cake, not too sweet. Dense, and moist. Only note to offer is that it remains very light through baking, so over did the first batch a bit, because the top never really browned. But once I realized this, it was a great cake!

I'm going to be making a wedding cake in a few weeks, so I've been experimenting with different recipes.  This one is great!  I made cupcakes to pair with different filling ideas and my family attacked them before I could even get them frosted.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.

I've made this cake four times now, following the directions to the letter. It turned out perfectly the first time, the other three times it was pretty dry. The flavor was fabulous all four times, and it's awesome with an almond frosting. I like to use the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting on the site (use Almond Extract instead of Vanilla) for this recipe. Buttercream seems a little too heavy.

This cake does NOT respond well to movement while baking.  It will fall/crater if you move it too much before it is cooked through!  It also takes a LOT longer than 25 minutes to cook in every pan I used.  In the oval pan set I used, which are all 2” deep, the 6” took about 40 minutes to cook.  The large one, which is 16”, took about 1 hour 40 minutes to cook.  This is a very dense, moist cake and tastes great, though!  I also made it with chocolate cake mix.  I did not add the almond extract on either kind, as I’m not big on almond and my hubby is allergic.  On the white cake, I added 1/8 tsp of cheesecake candy flavoring instead of the almond extract.  On the chocolate cake, I just used 1 tsp of butter flavor in place of the almond extract.  I think that caramel or irish crème flavoring would also work well.

Pound cake texture. Taste was good. Needed much longer baking time. Very difficult to release from pan. Will try greased parchment paper on bottom if I do it again.

This is a deliciously moist and visually appealing white cake. I have made this more times than I can count and just realized I have not reviewed! I would rate this a 10 if I could! Don't tell, and no one would ever know this started as a box mix :)

My family loved this cake!  I made it like it was originally posted with the exception of adding one box of vanilla pudding.  We used it for birthday cupcakes.  I divided the batter up into six bowls, added food coloring to each bowl, then put a teaspoon full of each color into paper cupcake liners.  (I used the idea from another recipe on this site called Rainbow Clown Cake.) I then topped them off with blue icing.  My son's classroom loved them!

One word describes this cake - AMAZING!!! I made this for my husband's birthday, put seedless raspberry jelly between the layers and whipped cream cheese icing (also on this site) on it. It was moist and delicious. A friend broke her diet for it and said it was completely worth it and I've never seen my husband eat so much cake in one sitting! I knew my father-in-law would love it, but wasn't visiting until the next week so I froze the cake and it thawed beautifully.

THis is an EXCELLENT cake! I was hesitant to use a box mix but I have to say this is outstanding. It's  become one of my standards. The only thing i ever change is elimination of the almond to make it a white cake.

This is a definite hit!  The texture is so moist and doesn't taste like a box mix at all.  It's an easy way to spruce up your cake.  Great flavor.  Thanks - I'll be making this lots!

I was incredibly skeptical of this cake as it uses box mix as well as other stuff, however, it turned out ubelieviably It was easy to make and incredibly delicious. Made for my boyfriend's birthday and he (and his family) couldn't stop shoveling it down!) I made it as a layer cake, baked 2 9" rounds for about 30 minutes. The cakes were light, fluffy and incredibly moist. Thanks for the great recipe!

Husband loves the batter! Always a good sign! I've seen the "WASC" recipes for years but never made it. Delicious! Everyone loved it and said it tasted like wedding cake. Makes 36 cupcakes! I've since made this with a yellow cake mix, and another white mix. I will stick with the white mix.

This is a totally awesome cake!  I could not bring myself to add an additional cup of sugar so I added only a 1/2 cup.  This cake I thought actually tasted better the next day.  You can easily impress anyone with this cake.

Impressive cake-a winner!!
And I thought I had to wait until I went to a wedding to get a cake this good!- not anymore!  Great texture, and taste.  The cake stayed level and looked beautiful!  No big bumps like a box cake. I used Pillsbury white and White Lily AP flour. I was worried that the smaller box size than called for in recipe would turn out badly, but no problem at all.  I frosted with an all butter buttercream white icing. I'm using this recipe for bridal shower  soon.  So happy to have found this recipe for special occasions!

This is the most moist and flavorful wedding cake recipe. 
I found by following a reviewers suggestion of beating the egg whites before adding to batter made for a better texture. 
Other than that, I followed exactly. I've made this cake several times for many occasions and it always gets compliments.
I made my son's wedding cake and cupcakes with strawberry filling and buttercream icing - absolutely wonderful! Thanks for this recipe - it's a keeper!

Made this with Duncan Hines white cake, used cake flour instead of all-purpose, and added 1/4 cup additional cake flour to make up for the difference between the boxed mix and actual recipe. I also skipped the almond extract and doubled the vanilla, and used 3 while eggs instead of whites. 

As for technique, I mixed all the wet ingredients together, sifted the dry ingredients in a separate container and alternated additions in 3 batches and mixed with a hand mixer. 

I divided the batter equally by weight into two 8 inch cake rounds that are 3" high (standard height pans are too shallow).  Baked them for 45 min total-- perfect timing.

Crumb is nice. Dense,  but not gummy. Lighter than a pound cake. Did NOT taste like boxed mix. 

All in all, very happy with this recipe and will definitely use it again!!

I really liked this.  I will make again.  I wanted cupcakes.  I made about 30 total. Baked 12 at a time 25 min and perfect.  They are dense and perfect for a kids bday party. I made sure to not over fill my cupcakes.  Thanks!

I have had so many raves about this cake.  I have made it a coconut cake and used coconut milk instead of all water.  It takes 50 minutes to bake in layers and 25 for cupcakes.  So moist and good.

Excellent.  Whip the egg whites first then fold in last for a lighter and fluffier cake.  Dont skimp on the almond extract!

This cake is AMAZING! I've been searching and searching for a white/vanilla/non-chocolate cake recipe to make a rainbow cake for my kids' birthday party.  After three recipes, I didn't need to search any further!

I made three batches of this recipe, so I could have 6 layers for my cake.  Here are the changes I made: Because the white cake mix is now 16.25oz., I added 2 oz. of flour to the recipe.  Also, as it didn't matter that the layers weren't pure white, I did 3 eggs instead of 4 egg whites. And lastly, someone dipped in to my sour cream (and I didn't have enough), so I added about an extra tablespoon of non-fat vanilla yogurt to make up the difference.  I wanted vanilla flavor only, so doubled the vanilla and omitted the almond. The cakes baked for 35 minutes (two-9" layers at a time) in a light-colored cake pan.

The taste is absolutely perfect for what I wanted.  Everyone was gobbling up the tops that I cut off (to flatten my layers).  I had to freeze the layers as the party is a week away, but this will make it easier to frost anyhow.  So excited!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I am testing recipes for Tiffany gift mini cakes. She wants white cake. How can I make this cake white? Butter and whole eggs make this a yellow cake. I would like to use this recipe based on reviews.

I was very anxious to try this recipe after going to a wedding cake tasting for my daughter’s upcoming wedding. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the extract amounts. I wanted to make sure the almond really came out so I reduced the vanilla to ½ teaspoon and increased the almond to 1½ teaspoons. I also baked this in a 9 x 13 pan and was able to make 6 cupcakes as well. The cake took about 47 minutes to bake and the cupcakes 17. (I watched this like a hawk so I could get the right results). I used the Almond butter cream frosting recipe from another review.  The cake turned out great, everyone loved it. I cannot wait to bake it again.

I made this cake and took it to work and it was a huge hit! everyone said it was just like a wedding cake..everyone wants the recipe and I will definitely be making again....it did take longer than the 25 minutes to bake...with the extra ingredients, there was a lot more batter and I could have made a 9 by 13 and maybe a 8 in round...highly recommend...

I have been making this recipe for over a year now. It is my go to for white cupcakes. I LOVE how flavorful it is and the texture has always been incredibly moist. My kids who do not like almond flavor still love this cake. I will continue baking it for years to come.

Awesome recipe-seriously the best cake I've ever made! Thank you also to the reviewer who mentioned that the cake mixes are smaller (15 oz) than this recipe called for-I reduced water to 1 cup and I never would have noticed on the package OR if I had, wouldn't have known what to do about it. Thanks!

Love this cake! I added 2 tsp of almond flavoring instead of vanilla to cake. I also used milk 1 1/3 instead of water and a stick of butter. Mine was sooooooooooo. good! For the icing I used 1 box conf. sugar, stick of butter, 1 tsp almond flavoring, 1 tsp vanilla flavoring and 4 T of whipping cream.

I was nervous about making a wedding cake and how it would turn out but it was outstanding!  I like almond so I added a little more.  It was moist even after making it a couple days ahead.  This will be a regular thanks for sharing.

After a disaster day of baking using a different recipe, I decided to take a chance on this one.  Using whole eggs instead of whites and 2 teaspoons of vanilla (in place of vanilla and almond) this cake turned out perfectly!  Using whole eggs instead of whites meant tt was sturdy enough to stack 2 feet high. (I probably used 3 eggs in place of 4 whites.)  The cake was moist, didn't crumb too much, and super flavorful.  Everyone is surprised when I tell them that a box mix is one of the ingredients.  The other additions give this cake a gourmet flavor, while the box mix ensures the texture people expect.

I followed the recipe exactly except used cake flour and 2 whole eggs as some other reviewers suggested.  I did sift.  Good texture & I thought the taste was really good, but I wasn't certain if it was worth the extra work.  The acid test was my family of 6, usually lukewarm about cupcakes.  I made over 30 cupcakes and in 3 days, they were all gone! All loved them!  I recommend and will definitely make this again!!  Thanks for the recipe!

All I can say is OMG!!! This is the best cake ever if you are looking for a white cake that doesn't taste like a chemical cake!!! I frosted with white chocolate mousse frosting...I have had four LARGE pieces today!!! My family loved it!!! Did not change a thing and we could easily taste the almond...Also made raspberry sorbet to serve on the side...PERFECT....

I've used this cake recipe so many times. It is the best. I've done it with chocolate cake mix and chocolate chips, and lemon cake mix. It always comes out wonderfully moist and delicious. My next test is using it with strawberry cake mix.

I made this cake for my son and daughter-in-laws wedding. It was rich and moist.  I couldn't have had a better recipe.  I used a white chocolate mousse for the frosting. Everyone loved it.  Thank you

This is a great recipe!  I use this cake for birthday cakes and it is one of my most requested cakes.  It quickly became a favorite and is so versatile, it goes well with everything.  It's easy, and delicious!  I've made it with greek yogurt instead of sour cream before and it came out great then too.  This cake is my go to cake for all occasions.

This was an excellent cake.  I made it for a coworker's birthday, who was on a diet.  This was already a pretty low calorie cake, but I made it lower yet by using 1/2 c light sour cream and 1/2 cup light applesauce and only 1 tbls oil.  For the topping I used light cool whip mixed with some powdered sugar.  It turned out great, and everyone said it was really good and couldn't believe it was a "light" cake.

I used this recipe for the bottom tier of a wedding cake. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! I was concerned that the sour cream would make it too moist and not supportive enough for the large cake, but it was perfect and plenty dense. I filled it with layers of pastry cream (recipe found on this site) and strawberry. Definitely the best cake I have made thus far!

Using this cake for a wedding. Baked up beautifully, nice flat layers, denser and easy to ice but still moist and delicious. Found out it actually tastes better when it sits a day or two, in my opinion. I made marble cake and straw filling. Made the choc just the same as the white and swirled together. Two white and one chocolate made enough batter for a 12" sq, a 10" sq and a 6" square perfectly. Did this times 2 for 2 layers. The cake splits well too, will be splitting to make 4 layers with straw in between.

Made these into 24 cupcakes. Seriously - SOOOO GOOOOD! One reviewer said the crumb was too dense for her taste. That put me over the edge to try this recipe. I love a good, dense crumb. I'm not a huge fan of storebought cakes and cakemixes. The crumb of this cake is more like angel food cake than a typical cake. Mmmmmm. The taste is unbeatable! I absolutely love the almond flavoring. Such a delicious taste. I topped this with whipping cream mixed with cream cheese and sugar. Really... these were so delicious. Could work for the nicest of nice situations - including a wedding. Lovely pearly white look. The picture (shown) really doesn't do them justice.

Perfect Everytime...I have also used flavoring variations with much success.  Love this paired with a good swiss buttercreme frosting.  Not overwhelmingly sweet but rich and flavorful.

I made my first wedding cake using this recipe. I was a little hesitant using the almond extract (it's not my favorite flavoring). However, I wanted to make the recipe exactly as stated... DELICIOUS!!! Many of the guest complimented stating, "this is the best wedding cake I've ever had". Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my sisters wedding, best tasting cake I've made to date, I cant wait to make the chocolate version with chocolate cake mix and baking cocoa, Every single piece of a four layer tier was gone, even people who weren't cake fans came up to tell me how much they enjoyed the flavor & texture of this cake, thanks!

This recipe was the perfect starting point for my wedding cake! After learning the insane amounts bakeries wanted, my husband and I decided to make our own cake. We changed the extracts and where they were put, but otherwise followed this recipe exactly. My husband is from Montana and is a huckleberry fanatic, and I love white chocolate, so we flavored the cake white chocolate and the frosting huckleberry. We were wise enough to try different flavoring combinations beforehand and learned that putting them both in the cake was overpowering. Thank you so much for posting this recipe! You indirectly saved my wedding cake!

This cake gets rave reviews so I guess I had my expectations too high. I was expecting more flavor. BUT tomorrow morning Im making cannoli cream to try as a filling. I might have to change my rating after that because I think the two flavors will go really good together.

I made this cake for my sons birthday, it was delicious !!! No one could tell I used a boxed cake mix, It is super moist with light almond and vanilla flavors. I will be making this for many birthdays to come. I completely recommend this for everyone who is looking for a easy to make, great tasting cake !

Delicious!  Way better than just the box mix alone.  Topped with a homemade lemon butter cream icing and it got rave reviews.  It makes more than a 9x13 (recipe calls for a 11x13 pan, which I don't have).  Had to make a separate smaller cake, which is fine because it went in the freezer to be enjoyed at a later date!  Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe for a stacked cake. I made a tiered cake for my in-laws 50th anniversary using this recipe. It turned out beautifully. I filled with raspberry cake filling and iced with butter cream frosting. Very yummy.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I had super high expectations because I was hoping to find a recipe that tasted just like my oh-so delicious wedding cake, and this wasn't it, but nonetheless, it was still good.  It was moist, the texture was light, but it still had that boxed cake taste, rather than the flavor that the professionals can do.  Even though my oven was exactly at 325, I also had to cook it for an additional 15min because it remained soupy in the middle.  Luckily, the edges didn't burn at all during that extra time, and it came out looking very nice.  Once it cooled, I used a vanilla glaze over the top and covered it with sliced almonds.  Overall, it was very good.

This cake is fantastic!!  Following a reviewer's suggestion, I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream; everything else I left the same.  Love the touch of almond flavoring.  I made these cupcakes for a coworker's birthday, and everybody loved them!  I've already forwarded the recipe to 5 people who requested it.  This is my new go-to recipe for white cake!!

I made this cake for my son's birthday yesterday and it was AWESOME.  My son, who turned 44 yesterday, said it was the best white cake he's ever eaten.  I didn't have any almond flavoring, so I used only the vanilla flavoring, I used fat free sour cream, and whipped the egg whites and folded those into the batter last.  I can see using this recipe for any manner of fillings and frostings.  Thank you!

My only issue was that I did 2 8 inch cakes (to layer) and I couldn't get them to bake all the way through! I ended up cooking an extra 10 minutes! It was slightly (like 2 min) over cooked but the flavor was AMAZING!

I have made this several times now (mainly for birthdays) and it is ALWAYS a huge hit.  I personally think the baking time of 25 minutes is way too short, even when divided into 9" rounds, I always have to add at least 10 minutes, sometimes 15.  Also, the recipe doesn't call for it, but I whisk the egg whites a bit, otherwise it can come out too dense.  One last recommendation, a "light" frosting is best, the cake is so flavorful and rich, a straight buttercream frosting can be too sweet, using a heavy cream instead of milk or even adding some whipped topping to the frosting can help "cut" the sweetness.  All that being said, this is a GREAT recipe and good as is.

This cake is great! However, the first time I tried it (following the recipe to the 'T') I found it was a bit too moist. So I made a couple of changes: I lowered the sour cream by 1/3 cup and whipped the egg whites and folded it in.  It turned out great, a bit lighter in texture but still able to hold up the fondant and be stacked.

Made cupcakes with this recipe for my son's birthday. I divided the batter into four different bowls and mixed w/ food coloring. Then I put a spoonful of each in each cup and the batter won't mix. When the cupcakes are baked they have a neat color pattern. Everyone was so impressed by these and could not believe that I made them. Not to menation the fact that they tasted amazing. Next time though, I will make my own frosting. I really don't like the taste of store bought frosting.

I prepared this yesterday for my daughters birthday, it was everything as promised, dense, moist and wonderful flavor. I followed the directions with the following change :1 cup plus 2 tablespoons cake flour for the regular flour. I've posted a photo as well of the cut cake so you can see how dense and even this was. I did two 9 inch rounds, and had to bake it much longer (40 minutes)  I made the "Best White Icing Ever" using 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening. It was delicious as well.

Delicious cake! The flavor and texture of this cake is wonderful, we loved it! I did double this recipe because I needed 3 9in. layers, and by doubling this it makes 4 layers, which was fine, we snacked on the leftovers. I kept the oven temperature at 325 and these were done at roughly 35 minutes (I don't recall exactly, I just kept checking). I will use this recipe again for sure, the almond flavor is great. Thanks for sharing! :)

I have to say that this is by far one of my top five cake recipes.  I have my own customer cake business, and when I present a cake and I have used this recipe I get very good reviews.  One time I accidently used eggs instead of egg whites and it still turned out very well.

Fantastic.  I've made this recipe about 4 -5 times now and its wonderful. I do double the almond because I like the strong flavor.  I use it in 2 x 8 in pans and can trim the tops.

I thought this recipe was a great way to improve a mix.  It did make a more moist cake.  However, it did still taste like a mix.  I was hoping the additions would change the flavor more.  I will experiment with flavors other than vanilla.  Maybe lemon would be better.

This was super easy and very delicious.  This recipe I was able to make 2 8x8 cakes....one to have for my family and one to share.  Or you could double them up to make a 2 layer cake.  I also used the Butter Cream Frosting II on the cake.  It was like a big cup cake and everyone loved it.  You have to like sweet.

Excellent! I made cupcakes and baked for 22 minutes. Great way to jazz up a box mix. Really nice flavor and texture. Will certainly use again and again. Thanks! :)

Made this for my parents anniversary party & was still getting rave reviews weeks later! A few of the guests wandered back in while we were cleaning up for take home boxes! Very, very moist cake! Layered it with the Almond Custard Filling also found on this site.

This recipe is excellent!! I've tried this cake using lemon extract instead of almond; and have tried it using coconut extract instead of almond.  I also added the pudding mix as someone else suggested.  Delicious!!!  Will be making this from now on.

One of the moistest cake I've ever had and the flavor is very  good. I iced it with the almond buttercream frosting from this site and topped it with fresh blueberries and it was even more delicous. I will definitely make this again!

If time is what I was trying to save by using the cake mix for a base, then this wasnt the cake recipe for me! It took me SEVENTY minutes (not a typo) to sift the cake mix. My arms were sore the next day. I need ideas/help with that! Aside from that, here are the other comments about this recipe -  I could taste the 'white box cake mix' flavor. I had hoped that all the other ingredients would have eliminated the 'box cake' flavor.  The texture was stunning (my sifting efforts were rewarded)  I used butter instead of oil.  A comment had said a 9x13 would work fine. Plan on doubling the cook time. I gave it 5 extra minutes. I gave it 10 more. I gave it 10 more. I gave it 7 more. Fifty seven minutes to cook it in a 9x13 airbake pan.  Almond Buttercream Frosting on top. It was too much to have almond flavored frosting on almond-flavored cake. The frosting needed the almond flavor either eliminated or reduced.  Everyone LOVED LOVED LOVED this cake. It was the best cake I've ever made (and my first sort of 'real' one)..but, I will be on the hunt for a recipe for a 'from scratch' wedding cake. The only good reason I can see for using the cake mix is to save time. It did not do that and tasted like box cake. The heaviness of the cake mix made the sifting 'next to' impossible.  I will make this cake again IF I can find a better sifting solution. I couldnt believe how many little hard weird granules are in box cake. That's why I kept at the sifting, in case you were wondering :)

This cake is absolutely delicious.  I had to bake it about 45 minutes before it was done (9x13 pan).  Used almond buttercream frosting (3 c conf. sugar, 1/2 c butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1-2 T milk), topped with fresh raspberries... fantastic!

Fantastic recipe!!!  I made this exactly as written and it was perfect.  Very moist and dense with great flavor.  It tasted like a bakery cake and was really easy.  It is great for tiered cakes it held up well  as a bottom layer of a 2 tiered cake.  I used white chocolate frosting and filled with raspberry jam, it was wonderful!

Good.  Very dense crumb. I made it in two silicone round cake pans & baked them for 35 minutes. I cut each round in half horizontally and filled with Pastry Cream from this site & a strawberry filling & dusted the top with powdered sugar.  Very good.

Mmmm! I love it! I ate some of this cake before it was iced/frosted and it was so good! I am one of those people who have to eat their cake with icing but this one was good enough without it. It was really moist and tasted wonderful. I can't say anything bad! I will use this recipe many, many more times.

Delicious! And I love that the base is a boxed cake mix...makes it that much easier :). I frosted it with just a store-bought chocolate frosting & it was great! Can't wait to try it with other frostings/fillings/fondant :).

This cake was fantastic. I made it for my daughters birthday and it was better than any store bought cake I've ever had.  I added a half package of pudding and it turned out great, not to much crumb as suggested by other reviewers. I will definitely make this cake again.

It's been a long time since I've had wedding cake, but this recipe tastes pretty close to how I remember it tasting! I added 1/4 cup of cake flour to make up for the difference in cake sizes now, as recommended by another reviewer (I used a Pilsbury cake mix that was 15.25 ounces). I made this into cupcakes. I filled the cupcake liners 2/3 full, which resulted in nicely domed cupcakes with no over-spill onto the cupcake tins. It made 24 full size cupcakes, 12 mini cupcakes and 5 oval easter egg shaped cakes. I was really happy with the results, and am looking forward of trying this "method" with other flavors of cake mix. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very nice, basic wedding cake recipe. The almond definitely comes through and the sour cream adds a nice tartness. This recipe creates very sturdy, but moist layers that hold up well in layer cakes. I stored my layers in the fridge overnight wrapped in plastic wrap and the crumb was still moist and easy to decorate. I loved how simple and easy this recipe was. I used a 6" round mould for my cakes and they came out perfectly.... BUT, they took about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe states. I baked each 1.5 inch layer at 325 degrees for about 38 minutes each.

I've tried so many cakes from scratch and they all seem to turn out dry and crumbly... So I love using recipes like this that have a box cake just as a base. I had no problems using a 15 oz box cake mix either.. I used Duncan Hines and it was great! The cake was incredibly moist and light (I beat my egg whites for a long time to make them really fluffy), and the almond was not overpowering at all. I took the cake to a family party and everyone LOVED it. The cake was gone in a matter of minutes. I will definitely be saving this recipe!

This recipe is delicious!  I have made it several times.  I will say that I have made it twice with a Pillsbury brand cake mix and it didn't work either time - it came out very dense and sticky no matter how long I baked it - possibly because it is 15.25oz and I didn't add any additional.  I have also made it with Betty Crocker cake mix - their box is 16.25 oz and works beautifully.  I prefer it with about half as much almond as the recipe calls for.    This recipe is a staple - but only with the right cake mix!!

Great cake, but I have a question. The picture is a layer cake with a darker "layer" of something between the 2 cake layers. What is it?? The directions are just for a 9 x 13 cake, no filling.

I made a 9" layer cake using Duncan Hines cake mixes (15.25 ounce boxes, they don't make 18oz anymore).  I made both white and chocolate cakes, layered them with buttercream mixed with raspberry pie filling, and covered in buttercream.  Everyone commented that it was the best cake they had ever eaten.

This is, without a doubt, one of the best cakes I have ever eaten.  It is dense, moist and maintains its flavors and texture well for a day or two.  Possibly more, but who knows, because it just never lasts that long.  

If you don't need a perfectly white cake, add the yolks of a couple eggs, rather than just the whites, for a depth of flavor a bit more profound.  I can hardly wait to try this with other flavors, but today I'm making 4 of these for a wedding, and my house smells fabulous.   ******UPDATE*******  I'm back from a wedding where  I served this cake, to rave reviews.  I live in Guatemala and many people thought this was some secret American recipe.  Cupycakesmurf, thank you for a great cake recipe.  I have it memorized now and will make it often.  You have become an international star!!!

I made it exactly as written, but in a 9x13 pan, and checked it at 20, 23, 26, and 29 minutes in my gas oven. Looks like 30 minutes is the sweet spot! I let it sit 5 minutes in the pan to set before placing it on the rack to cool. There's only two of us and we've eaten the whole thing in 24 hours. It *is* the moistest, thickest, most delicious boxed cake recipe we've had, and stays that way even after being out on the counter all night. A+, now my go to recipe.

AMAZING!  FANTASTIC!  SUPERB!  THE BEST!!!
I've made this cake twice in 1 month and have gotten nothing but raves.  The first time I made it exactly as the recipe.  The second time, I changed it up a bit and substituted the cake mix for a Yellow Cake Mix and the extract w/ Lemon Extract.
I love this cake so much it's going to be my go-to cake going forward. It's firm, but not dry.  
I can't wait for the next one.  I'm going to try to work w/ different extracts as it seems to be come out as delicious as the original.

FIVE ISSUES: 1: there isn't a single 18.25 oz. package of cake mix on the grocery shelves. I used 16.25 oz. 2: I questioned the egg whites put in not beaten but followed the recipe and did not beat them.  3. I don't own a 11 x 13" cake pan. Didn't know they existed - used my 9 x 13" cake pan. 4:  My oven seems to bake other things quite accurately but I had to increase the baking time on this 5 minutes 3 consecutive times. I was afraid to leave it in any longer and the toothpick trick proved that it was done. 5. The cake did not 'crown'. it actually is lower in the middle than on the sides. No more time - have to leave for Easter. This cake will be served with 7-minute frosting and coconut topping. Wish me luck!

The day I made this cake (I made cupcakes) I thought it didn't taste up to the standards of the reviews. Well, the next day it was awesome!! I made cupcakes for my son's birthday party and the night before the party I was disappointed because it tasted like a box cake, but the day of the party all the kids loved them. It took my adult friend to try one and she raved so much all the adults wanted to try one. Now my family and friends are asking me to make cupcakes for their parties.  This recipe takes better the next day. One of the reviewers offered a buttercream recipe (sorry can't remember who it was) and this made the cupcake! So it could be the buttercream icing that made this cake so good.  ( I gave this recipe a low rating but came back to change it).    ;) ** Also I added more almond than the recipe called for -according to what I like***

My aunt and I made cupcake versions of this recipe and they were SO good. Very moist and flavorful- reminded me almost of angel food cake.

We ended up finding that filling the cupcake tins about 3/4 full and putting them in the oven for 16 minutes makes the perfect cupcake with this recipe.

I can tell I'll be coming back to this recipe often in the future!!

p.s. peppermint frosting pairs very well with this cake

Okay, the photo shows a light tan layer, and the recipe doesn't mention this. I want to make the cake like the photo shows. How do make that layer??

So to make this better I started with a very good cake mix.  Then I used melted real butter instead of vegetable oil, I also added one tablespoon of butter for each yolk that was not added on top of the amount I used in the place of the oil.  Cakes need fat and removing the yolk makes for a nice white cake but also removes allot of the texture and flavor. I used milk instead of water.  Also spend a little on the extract making sure to use real extract and not something artificial will make a huge difference.  Also real sour cream complete with all the calories is best.  This is one recipe trying to cut calories from will not produce great results.

First time baking with sour cream and it is the most delicious cake I've ever made! I also doubled the amount of vanilla and almond for a real punch in flavor. It was delicious--though next time, maybe I'll just add 50% more almond only.

Excellent cake.  I made two -- the first I made exactly according to the recipe.  The second was a chocolate cake that I made following Tami Baity's advice, substituting 1/3 cup of cocoa for 1/3 cup of the flour.  Both were delicious, moist and sturdy.  I made the white cake in three layers and filled it with a pineapple filling.  The chocolate cake was a two-layer cake filled with raspberry filling.  I got rave reviews for both.  Neither cake tasted like a "box" cake.  This will be the only recipe I use for layer cakes from now on.  Thank you!  **For those complaining of a crumbly cake, I cooled my layers, then wrapped them in plastic wrap and put the layers in freezer ziplock bags and froze them ahead of time.  When I was ready to finish the cakes several days later, I pulled them out of the freezer, filled them and iced them while they were still frozen.  No crumbs, no tearing apart of the cake.  It requires a little planning ahead, but it was SO easy.

I made a double recipe of this and baked cupcakes rather than an 11x15 cake. I baked at 325 for 20 min and they were perfect! I used a buttercream frosting recipe from All Recipes which was the BEST consistency for piping onto the top of the cupcakes. I can't access the recipes to find the name of the icing, but basically it was butter, Crisco, 8 c of confectioners sugar, etc. I used 1 tsp EACH of orange and lemon flavoring.  Received many compliments on these!!

Made it exactly - except I used round cake pans. The density was perfect to use as my sister's gender reveal cake. Everyone at the shower raved about the flavor - will definitely make this again. It's so moist, delicious, and easy!

I've made this three times. The first time I measured extra cake mix to accommodate the smaller boxes now for sale; the second/third time I did not but reduced water to 1c + 2T. Both were delicious. I prefer the almond as suggested but omitted it and doubled the vanilla for a 6yo's birthday party. Both were delish and earned raves. Makes two 9" layers or 12 cupcakes + one 8". The cake is dense, so layered it's not that tall. Paired with Rick's Special Buttercream from this site. Divine!

I made this for a baby shower, everyone loved it! The parents-to-be said it was better than their wedding cake made by a professional! I made the cake just as the recipe said - it was perfect, not to sweet not to heavy. DELISH! A new favorite in my book!!

Love this recipe!!!!!!  This has become my go to recipe for any cakes I make that require fondant or heavy decorating.  delicious, sturdy, moist, and easy!  I've made the white cake version and made a chocolate cake version by replacing the 1 cup flour with 2/3 cup flour and 1/3 cup cocoa powder, replacing the egg whites with 3 whole eggs, omitting the almond extract, and adding a little less than two tablespoons of instant coffee to the water before adding it to the mix.

This cake was wonderful!  Moist and excellent taste and texture.  I am a non-baker and had no issues with it.  I made it into 2 9" round layers.  They came out completely flat - not always the case for my layer cakes.  They weren't delicate and were good to frost.  I used a cream cheese frosting and it was a great compliment.  

My one suggestion would be to line at least the bottom of the pans with wax or parchment paper.  I had a hard time getting them out and ended up freezing one layer to get it out.  The other left a small chunk in the pan - but the cake is so easy to deal with, I used frosting to put it back together. I don't have a picture of a slice but you can see from the frosted bit how well it went together and non-lopsided it was.

My cakes are normally made from scratch....saw this one when my daughter wanted a white cake for her birthday.  It's easy, even my great-grands loved it and it's now the new family favorite.  Change the flavor by changing the extract.

This cake got great reviews at my workplace.  I did add a teaspoon of coconut extract because, in my opinion, that's what "wedding cake" flavor should taste like.  Keep in mind, cooking time was not 25 mins, more like 45 mins.  I will be making this cake again, but maybe with less sugar since I like sweets that are not overly sweet.

This was a great base recipe. I wanted to get rid of my Christmas candy canes, so substituted a dozen broken candy canes for the sugar and used 2 whole eggs instead of egg whites. When the cake came out of the oven, I put 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips on, and when they melted, spread them around for frosting. I used a 9 X 13 pan instead of the size called for here and it turned out well.

We love this recipe in our house.  It's the go to cake recipe for everyones birthdays.   My girls love when we add gel colours to the batter to make rainbow layers.  It's dense, moist and so delicious.  It has always held up amazingly well with fondant and any filling.  It also freezes really well.  I usually make it a week in advance and freeze until I'm ready to use.  Happy baking everyone!

Love this recipe. I only changed it by adding a few drops extra of both extracts. It tastes amazing with the Buttercream Icing recipe submitted by Sharon Gerstman. Make sure to use all butter no shortening for the icing. I also added a 1/2 tsp of almond extract.

Made this last week for hubby's stepdad birthday.  Made exactly as written using Pillsbury moist supreme white cake mix which now only comes in 15.25 ounces so added another 3 ounces to equal 18.25.  Husband said it's his new favorite and that means it beat out a yellow cake with chocolate frosting.  Also made sure ingredients were at room temperature.  Used classic vanilla buttercream icing found at All Recipes.  Making again today for a family party and  hubby's been asking for more.  I did need to bake it about 5-10 minutes longer than suggested using 9 inch aluminum cake pans on middle rack but oven temp was as suggested (used oven thermometer to check).  Happy baking!

I tried it, but didn't have almond extract, so that may have affected the outcome.  I don't find it to have much flavor at all.

My testers loved it! I think it's a bit too sweet and may cut back on the sugar next time it's made just for us. I have used all vanilla for those who don't care for almond flavor and I have also toned down the almond by using less. Turns out great every time. Recently separated batter in two parts and added 1/3 cup of cocoa powder to make half chocolate-half vanilla...YUM. Thank you for posting recipe.

The best cake I've ever had!  I couldn't find an 18.25 oz boxed mix so after doing some research I found that I could use a 15.25 oz box plus 1/2 cup from a second box.  I has to buy two boxes and discard the rest of the unused portion of the 2nd box but it was worth it.  This cake deserves 5+ stars!  I just wish I could find a nice light and fluffy frosting recipe to go with it.

I have made this twice now with different results.  The taste both times has been incredible, but the 2nd time I read more reviews and followed those who indicated to use milk instead of water.  I will go back to water.  It does nothing for the taste, but the texture I found the first time to be far better, more dense, than the 2nd.  It did not cut cleanly.  It did better with a sharper knife but I still felt on some slices I was cutting into the cake. In addition, large air pockets also resulted and that look was not my vision unfortunately.  Good thing it tasted good! :-)

Wow, what an amazing recipe! I used it to make Wedding White Cupcakes and the best thing about it is that the cupcakes DIDN'T SHRINK DOWN while cooling like every other white cake recipe I've tried! Amazingly the taste and texture are perfect too! Thanks so much for this, I am grateful!

This is the BEST white cake recipe. I use boiling water when it calls for water and take it out like RIGHT when a toothpick comes out clean and its the biggest hit every time I serve it. I frost it with home made buttercream frosting with a smidge of almond in it. THE BOMB.

Had to try this base with chocolate cake mix, and I used devils food DH brand, and I used 3/4 C. Flour and 1/4 cup of cocoa .  It baked beautifully..awesome flavor!!

Originally made this recipe as-is for cupcakes (found the recipe on another site)...were gummy because of overfilling cupcake liners and under-cooking. Tried this again as a layer cake with these changes and found the cake simply delicious.
Here are my changes:
Pillsbury's white cake containing pudding (18.25 oz);
(2) 8-inch layers at 325 degrees for approximately 47  minutes;
3 whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites;
I used 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 ½ teaspoons almond extract, and 1 teaspoon of buttery sweet dough emulsion (found at King Arthur flour website);
Used milk instead of water;
Filled inner layer with Smuckers Strawberry Sundae Topping (small amount), then with frosting (copycat of Publix buttercream);
Frosted outside of cake with Publix buttercream...very rich icing.

yes I tried it..I doubled it and added stick of soft butter and 2 tsp vanilla instead of almond flavoring. I also added two whole eggs and beat in three egg whites at the last.It was delicious! For Christmas I Frosted with homemade buttercream icing and decorated it with white chocolate candies and little meringue kisses on top. Oh, I baked it in a tube pan and made a few tiny cupcakes out of excess batter.

This is a great recipe that's foolproof and comes together very quickly.  I used only 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla as I wanted more of the almond flavour to come through.  Use real almond and vanilla if you can.  The cake/cupcakes don't brown very much in the oven, so be careful not to overbake if you're looking for brown tops!

Excellent cake for stacking or carving. Holds up well if using fondant. I've done this as written, and also with chocolate cake mix and both were great! Feel free to change this up with other cake mix flavors and other extracts (as long as you are using basic mixes, and not, say, angel food or something).

Easy, delicious, dense, and will not crumble for you fellow cake decorators out there. I have used this several times and clients request the almond cake with raspberry cream cheese filling all the time now! I give 4 stars for ease, taste, and the recipe is always consistent. I still prefer overall taste from homemade cake, but this is a reliable alternative and a crowd pleaser! The sour cream and almond is subtle enough and keeps the cake moist and gives it that made from scratch texture.

Made this cake for my god-daughter's birthday and everyone loved it. I made a couple changes; reduced the sugar to 3/4cup, made it 1 1/3 water and milk and increased the almond extract to 2 tsp. It turned out wonderful and I would definitely use this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

The cake was OK.  I layered it in a birthday cake for a guy who loves almond but I found it a little too strong a flavoring.  Actually made it hard to taste a chocolate cake layer.  If I make it again I will cut the vanilla by at least half.

I used this recipe for the first time to make it for my nieces wedding cake. It is absolutely incredible! Everyone commented on how moist and deliciious it was!
Since I was making a large wedding cake, I did bake some of the tiers earlier in the week and then wrapped in plastic wrap and placed in the freezer for 3 - 5 days. After,I pulled out and frosted almost immediately (crumb coat). They held up great and made the best cake! Thanks for sharing!

I took the reviewer's suggestion of Duncan Hines Chocolate Cake, 2/3 C. flour, 1/3 C. cocoa, and instead of water I used coffee.  I used vanilla for the flavoring.  I topped it with DH Caramel frosting and added a little sea salt on top.  Chocolate cupcakes with salted caramel frosting.  They were very good and everyone loved them.

This is pretty tasty! I've started making all my baking recipes from scratch but had a box of white cake still in my cupboard, so I thought I'd find a recipe to make it go a little farther. I didn't have enough sourcream so I just used 4oz of creamcheese like someone else had mentioned and also put in a package vanilla pudding (dry mix) and I didn't use almond flavoring, I substituted more vanilla. It is a very moist cake.

I am making my daughter's wedding cake (first one ever) and used this recipe for the first practice cake.
The cake was delicious!  She loved it.  I didn't have the almond extract but I will get it and use it for the next time.  It stayed moist for several days.  I didn't have a white cake mix either, so used a "Funfetti" mix...may actually use it for the final cake!

YUM! So moist. What a great cake base to do anything with. I didn't have almond extract so used extra vanilla. Family raved over it!

This is the most wonderful cake! It is so moist. I made this for my daughter's 2nd birthday cake, and will make it for many more birthday cakes in the future! With a recipe like this, I may expand myself to make cakes even outside of birthdays. Yum, yum!

I used this recipe to make cupcakes (dyed them pink) and then topped this with cotton candy flavored frosting.  The cake was moist with a nice light crumb and it had a delicate enough flavor to let the frosting flavor stand out without the dessert being too sweet.  These cupcakes were gone within half a day of making them because all of my friends wanted one!

I don't really go for boxed recipes, but I had some French Vanilla boxed cake mix and wanted to try this. Also, I have yet to come across a homemade (no box) recipe that I like. This makes 28 cupcakes (filled batter almost to the top). Bake for 25-30 minutes. These tasted very good! extremely fluffy, a little sweet and the almond definitely comes through. I will continue trying other recipes for white and yellow cake, but so far this is good.

I have been making this cake for 2 years now and everyone LOVES IT!! I get complimented on it every time I make it. Makes a very tastey, bakery style white cake. I always have to give my recipe away. People can't believe I made the cake and it wasn't from an expensive bakery!

This cake was pretty ordinary in my opinion.  I made 24 cupcakes and followed the directions almost exactly, just adding half a pack of vanilla pudding mix. It was definitely moist and dense, but the flavor was very ordinary.  I feel it would've been much better if it was made from scratch, though using packaged cake mix saves time.

I would like to double layer this cake with white chocolate mousse and raspberry filling. I have in my pantry a box of BC "Super Moist cake mix". Should I get a BC REGULAT white cake mix instead to be sure I can layer it easily?

I stumbled upon this recipe and i made it because i wanted something different and i love almond. A friend of mine tasted it and recommend me to do a wedding cake for her, my first time ever making and designing one. I've baked cakes in the past for my home and a few others but this recipe was a hit and has become the most asked for as i begin to embark on my new found hobby of making wedding cakes.

This cake is pretty good!  Only problem was I put in a 9 X 13 pan.  Made it a little too thick, Otherwise great!  Next time I'll have to use a larger pan or 2 smaller.

This is by far the best recipe I have found for a 'Special Occasion' cake!  Or any cake.  Perfect texture, taste.  I cannot say enough good about this recipe.  I do not change a thing - I make it exactly as written.  I tried changing an item or two, and it was just not the same.  In my opinion, the Almond extract is what gives it the awesome flavor.  But I do like almond flavoring.  I say again - the ABSOLUTE best I have ever tried!  It gets a huge WOW from me & my family!

I was looking to make a Strawberry Jello Poke cake, when another AR member recommended this recipe to me on the Buzz.  This was exactly what I was looking for, and was a total hit at my Dh's Birthday dinner.  The only change I made was to omit the almond flavoring, and double the Vanilla.  (wasn't sure how the almond and strawberry would taste together).  Topped this with the Easy Whipped Cream recipe from this site.  Will certainly use this recipe again, thanks for sharing!!

BRAVO!! I took another readers advice and added half a box of instant vanilla pudding, the cake was moist, dense and not too sweet. I covered this cake with marshmallow fondant and it was perfect held up beautiful. I wish I could tell how long it stayed moist for but my family ate every bit of it in one hour...perfect recipe

Probably the best cake I've ever made. Moist and perfect as written. Topped it with the Special Buttercream Frosting from this site.

This cake was a HUGE hit with my family i made it for a get together and used BC white cake and followed directions exactly. only thing i omitted almond extract bc i didnt have it so i doubled vanilla and the result was fantastic. dense and moist almost everyone had second pieces. i used cool whipped topping from this site which is a lighter frosting so i thought itd be good for such a dense cake. and it was !! i will be making this regularly for birthdays and holidays
**also bakign time varies i made this in two 9 inch pans and it took about 45-50 mins, and i didnt have a hand mixer so i mixed the dry and ten i mixed the wet and stirrred the wet into the dry with a whisk.

I chose this recipe recently for my wedding cake. It worked beautifully even for a very large, tall layer, and guests are still telling me how good it was. It's a very simple and foolproof recipe, but it rises evenly even in difficult ovens. It's moist and wonderfully flavorful, but still dense enough to handle being carved, layered, and decorated.

Great moist cake!  First time ever my cake came out perfect!  Only changes I made were: sifted all dry ingredients together, lightly beat all wet ingredients before adding to dry, and baked in two 8 inch round cake pans and it took 49 mins to bake.  Will be making this cake again for my son's 1st birthday!  Frosted with homemade buttercream icing too.  Delish!

Delicious!  The crumb was very delicate.  I tried to make a mini replica of our while almond wedding cake for our anniversary, and this was tastier than the original...and A LOT less expensive :)    I sliced the layers horizontally and basted them with amaretto, and then spread raspberry preserves in the middle.  Awesome and pretty.

Baked this for my granddaughter's first birthday.  She loved it but no one else finished the pieces on their plates. Consistency was more like a pound cake and I found it a bit dry. Batter was wonderful and smelled like heaven while baking.

Best tasting white cake ever, and that's coming from a choco-holic! Moist, flavorful, baked evenly (even as a large sheet cake), came out crumb-free, cuts great. This will be my go-to basic cake recipe, especially since you can change out the extract to modify the flavor so easily. Thanks, SMURF!

This cake was so incredible that I had to post a review.  I made a two layer birthday cake for my grandfather and everybody in attendance LOVED it.  Everybody.  Even my grandfather who usually doesn't comment on his cakes.      I didn't change anything in the recipe.  I used clear vanilla.  For the frosting, I used the boxed Wilton's Whipped Frosting which I added the two extracts to as well.  After frosting, I covered the cake in slivered almonds.

Very close to my wedding cake.  I wanted to duplicate my wedding cake that was sooo yummy for my new hubby.  This came very close.  The next time I bake this I will add a little more oil ,about 1/4 cup, a little more almond, 1/2 tsp and I will use 3/4 cups of sugar instead of the full cup.  I used an almond butter cream frosting.

Great cake!  Baked it ahead of time and froze it.  The texture was dense and moist...needless to say, a big hit.

Nice texture & flavor.  Used the lemon curd & raspberry filling from this site as well, so decided to only use the vanilla and omit the almond. YUM!

My new favorite cake recipe.  I usually make everything (cookies, pies, puddings) from scratch.  But when you need a quick dessert, especially for kids that won't know the difference, a cake mix is a great way to go.  This one tastes wonderful.  I think that the addition of the almond extract adds just that little something that makes it not taste as "mix" like.

25 minutes to bake this at 325 degrees in an 11x13-inch cake pan?, that is wrong, i baked mine for 50 minutes and it was ruined as it still wasn't done but i had to get it out of the oven.  the taste was good but it was a mess so i finished tearing it up and threw it in with some raspberries and whip cream.

Wonderful!  I used cake flour instead of all-purpose, but I'm sure it would have been equally good as written.  I made 3 9-inch rounds and baked at 325 for 25 minutes - they were perfect.  I filled my cake with the almond custard filling from this site and it was like something you'd buy at a fancy bakery.  Ohh la lal!

I was excited to try this cake after seeing the positive ratings & reviews, but the final product was such a disappointment.  The taste is still a lot like a box cake, only ...more artificial?  I used pure vanilla & almond extracts - no imitations.  The additional sugar is what really ruined it for me.  Even plain, the cake is far too sweet (and I LOVE sweets!).  I won't be trying to re-work this recipe.  I will give it 2 stars for the consistency, though.

Really great - with changes - I added 1/2 lg. box of Van. pudding; Also, used 5 egg whites (room temp), which I beat with 1/2 c. of the sugar until soft peaks formed - not dry- & set aside - made sure to sift all the dry goods and blended everything except egg whites - which I just put the mixer on low and added at the last.  It gave the cake a lot of air - I also made one cake with lemon curd filling, and one with strawberry filling - both with buttercream icing.

This cake was absolutely fabulous! Probably one of the best I've ever had. I doubled the almond extract since I'm a big fan. I frosted it with chocolate mousse (personal recipe of mine) and topped it with strawberries. It was to die for!

This was the best cake that I have ever made!!  I used this recipe to make my daughters 9th birthday cake yesterday.  I also used the Wedding cake icing recipe from this site and everything blended together perfectly.  I love bakery sweet cakes and that is exaclty what you get from this recipe.  Since I don't bake I did not tweek the recipe, I just followed it exactly as it is.

Wow, this was fantastic!  I used this recipe to make cupcakes and topped with wedding cake icing (found on this website).  This cake recipe tops any bakery cake I've ever tasted.  I didn't change a thing and glad I didn't.  It's perfect as written.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I had such high hopes for this since it has such rave reviews, but I just didn't like the taste. I don't know what it was, it tasted really artificial to me for some reason? I don't think it was the food coloring I used because it just tasted very cake mix-y (not that I don't like cake mix) I just don't know how to explain it...anyway, I used this to make cupcakes for my son's class for his birthday. I frosted them with chocolate frosting and all the kids seemed to like them anyway :)

I made this for my 8 yr olds birthday yesterday. I made 3 batches, one went into a 11x15 pan the other 2 layers were 9x13. I took 2cups of batter and put it into my 11x15 pan since this pan was 2" bigger than the recipe called for. The cake was a huge hit at the party everyone took pictures of it. My only problem was that It was difficult cutting into it,  it was moist but crumbly and  fell to pieces on everyone's plate, but it was so good that we all just ate it with our fingers.  The taste was amazing, however,   since I am a sight person and everything has to be perfect in appearance, I have to give only 4 stars for the presentation on the plate. Sorry.

I followed the recipe exactly.The cake tasted like a store mix and I couldn't frost it because it was too crumbly.  I feel bad giving a low score for this cake after seeing all the 5 star ratings, but I won't be using this cake for any reason.

This was wonderful!! I also made it with a package of vanilla pudding and used a vanilla cake mix instead of white, it was super moist. I made this for my hubbys birthday and he loved it.

Turned out beautifully!  Used soy sour cream and a large tube pan.  Got worried whe it took longer than 25 minutes to cook but it came out just fine!  Frosted with cream cheese II frosting from this site - also soy based.  Was perfect for my mom's 81st birthday!

This cake was very good.  I baked it in 3 round pans for 23 minutes.  I did not use the almond extract but doubled the vanilla extract.  I frosted it with butter cream frosting

Not 100% sure about this cake. Definately a nice combination of a (too) light cake box mix and a dense from scratch cake.   The flavor is GREAT but I think there is a little too much sour cream.  I used this for cupcakes and at 325 it took 28 minutes for them to bake and they were still a little too damp in the center.   I would also increase the salt to 1 tsp, it was a bit flat tasting.

Absolutely the best white cake I have ever had. I made it for my mom's birthday and everyone loved it. I did not let on that a boxed mix was involved, haha. I did make one small change out of necessity. I was out of vegetable oil, so I melted margarine and cooled it a bit before adding. I normally use fat free sour cream in recipes, but was worried that it might  not work well with this recipe. Therefore, I used the regular sour cream. Has anyone used the fat free? I baked it in a 9x13 metal pan and it did take more than an hour to bake in my oven.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was dry and crumbled.  The taste was delicious but I was not happy with the texture.  I'm concerned there was too much added flour in the recipe.  The sifting of the cake mix was brutal and took forever.  There has to be a better alternative.

FABULOUS CAKE! The taste is incredible! The only thing was that it took about twice as long to cook as the recipe stated.  But great cake.

I really liked this cake and it was easy to make but my family wasn't as keen on it.  I guess almond flavoring is an acquired taste.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Awesome cake.  I adore wedding cake & this is a recipe I can comfortably make for any occasion with a buttercreme frosting.  I baked two 9 inch rounds & a 7 inch square.  When I make it again, I'll use all the batter to make two 9" cakes to layer since it didn't rise as much as I thought it might.  Regardless, it was still a wonderful taste, great crumb & density.  Thanks for sharing this one.

I made this cake for my son's 11th Birthday. I used a #1 cake pan and made 2 cakes. I forgot to sift the flour on the 1st cake and it didn't turn out as good(it was crumbly) as the second that I did sift. I also made a Buttercream frosting that was awesome. I will definitely use this recipe again. My only question is "Does it work with a chocolate cake too?" Someone said in her review that you could use this on any kind of cake mix. I was just not sure if that means chocolate too. Thanks to anyone who can help.

Outstanding cake!  I made a 3-tier cake for a wedding using this wonderful recipe.  Everyone RAVED about the moist, yummy, delicious cake.  The white cake layers had a homemade raspberry filling; the chocolate layer had a chocolate mousse filling.  Absolutely a keeper recipe!  Made 8 cups of batter.  I used Betty Crocker cake mix for both the chocolate (German Chocolate, to be specific) and white layers.

Wow!!!  This turned out great and I followed the recipe exactly.  The batter smells so good and while it was baking it was great too...  I had a different purpose for this cake... I had an order for a strawberry shortcake, but they didn't want a biscuit kind of cake... I used this, but put it in 3 - 9 inch round pans, was the perfect amount of cake for each layer...  still nice and firm... great!

Disappointing.  I followed the recipe exactly except for leaving out the almond flavoring (just personal preference) and it just wasn't tasty.  It was dry and the texture wasn't the best.  I would not use again.

This cake taste amazing...! I love the texture. I however did make a few adjustments I added half milk and water instead of just water., I also added a half cup of vegetable oil instead of the 2 Tablespoons and last I added more almond extract then required I did 2 teaspoons maybe even a lil more.. ! :-) I loved it and so did everyone at the party.

Very moist cake and pretty as the white is stark. Unlike me to say this, but —as written—I’d say this is too sweet. Would suggest cutting sugar by 1/3 or even 1/2. Also note that most cake mixes are smaller than indicated so will have to adjust

This is such a moist easy cake to make.  I followed the directions exactly.  I put this cake in two 9" X 2" pans and 
baked it at 325 degrees for 40minutes and it turned out perfect. 
Very easy to frost.  The flavor is so good.  Best cake I have ever made.

This cake was made as a test for a birthday cake I have to do for a friend. The texture and taste was to die for. I
substituted buttermilk for sour cream and I used a half cup of sugar. I also used a black cherry filling between the layers. Thanks for sharing

Great recipe!
I tried it this time with adding 1 cup of yogurt (with 1 tsp baking soda) instead of sour cream and brown sugar instead of white sugar..
i loved it even more!
updating my review, i tried it this time with oat flour instead of wheat flour, and pineapple juice instead of water. it turned out great and even more moist and delicious!

I've always wanted to get better at making and decorating cakes.  This is one of the best tasting white cakes I've made.  The only variance with this recipe is that I added a package of vanilla instant pudding to the dry ingredients.  The cake is dense and moist and doesn't crumble like my normal boxed cakes have done.  I found a wedding cake frosting recipe and  will no doubt make it again.  I know it looks like a first grader made it, but I'm hoping to improve on my piping skills.

Delicious! I made this cake for my niece’s wedding last weekend. It was a 9- layer, 3-tier cake with raspberry filling. It was very hot and humid inside the reception venue so I used Italian Meringue Buttercream with almond flavor. Other than the piping literally melting off, it was absolutely delicious and everyone raved about it. I am thrilled with this cake!

This cake was perfect! Incredibly moist and a bit more dense than a traditional cake (as I believe a wedding cake should be.) The addition of the sour cream makes all the difference, and an there is an ever so subtle almond flavor from the extract. The cake paired beautifully with a homemade cream cheese butter cream frosting and a thin layer of raspberry jam between each tier. *As noted by other reviewers, make sure to pay attention to the ounces in the white cake mix you purchase, as you may need to adjust the other ingredients a bit (ex: add less water).

This is one of the best cakes I have ever had! The cake was moist and the texture felt like I got it at a professional bakery. I served it on 4th of July and turned it into a flag cake and everyone loved it. Instead of adding almond extract I used 2 tsp of lemon extract. It was amazing!!!

I followed the directions without any changes and the cake was excellent frosted with a buttercream icing. I put it in the refrigerator and served it cold which I think added to the taste. I will definitely make it again.

Prominent taste of almonds without being overbearing.  A great break from the white and yellow cakes.  Very moist and easy to make.  Just would like to know what type of icing to use.  I used a cream cheese  icing and it was pretty good.  Kids have already asked for me to make it again.

What a fantastic find in this recipe! I followed the recipe as written while adapting the recipe to the smaller cake mix size as another reviewer suggested and baked in 2 8" rounds for 40 minutes. The white cake with raspberry filling and a buttercream crumb coat I created  was a smashing hit with everyone in the family.

This was so easy to put together and had a wonderful light almond flavor.  The cake did have a very light crumb and was very fluffy.  I personally prefer a cake that is a little more dense, but, my guests liked it very much.

This is a great base white cake recipe. I made this cake with very minimum changes by replacing the almond extract with equal amounts of coconut extract. I also made a whipped buttercream frosting (with added coconut extract but not too much). I then layered the cake and sprinkled shredded coconut (dried) between the 2 layers. I also coated the cake once stacked and frosted with more shredded coconut (dried). Everyone loved it.

This is an excellent recipe! I made it exactly as written and it turned out beautifully. I love the denser texture and although I'm not a fan of almond extract, I have to say that this was delicious! Just the right amount of flavor. This made a LOT of cake. I ended up making cupcakes and an additional 8" round cake that I froze for later use. Try it with homemade chocolate frosting. YUM! This one is a keeper for sure.

Made this for my daughter's winter wedding last year in coconut.  The cake was one of the best I have tasted although I did not use the full amount of almond flavoring.  Cake held up beautifully.  Also used the recipe for the chocolate grooms cake and used raspberry filling along with the chocolate frosting.  They  just celebrated their anniversary and they said the frozen topper was still moist after defrosting.  I have had fun trying this cake with other flavors and all have turned out well using the regular size box mix.  I do not use the almond flavoring as I do not like it.  Have not tried it in a sheet cake yet as I think the stacked cakes (makes 3-9in) make an awesome finished product.

No....I did not make this cake.  I was interested in the layer cake with the thick layer of ?almond filling in the accompanying picture.  This recipe is for an odd size small sheet cake with no additional instructions for making the cake with the filling shown.

I didn't make any changes and will make it again with one alteration.  Add more almond.  It was to mild for me.  However, it was the most level cake I have ever baked.  Each layer the exact same height and totally flat.  I liked the texture a lot.  The only reason why I gave it a four star cause I was expecting a little bit more in flavor.  I did like it.  It's worth making cause it was so easy.

I've made this recipe multiple times in multiple ways. It's so versatile! I always use Greek yogurt for the sour cream and apple sauce for the vegetable oil. It doesn't matter which cake mix I use, it always turns out. I've used pineapple juice as well as champagne for the water and different extracts to vary flavor. This is a great keeper as is or with twists! :) Thanks so much!

Good basic almond flavored white cake that adapts well with other flavored varieties.  Note the recipe is for the old 18.5 oz cake mix box and most are now 15.5 oz. and it really requires the extra amount of cake mix to work out well.  Just open another box and add 3 oz and save the balance of it for another cake.  And  trust me...do not use "light"  style sour cream in this recipe.....  that was a true disaster!  Next time I used full sour cream and it turned out great.  I have found that light sour cream deteriorates for some reason in most recipes that I have used it in . Save it for topping a baked potatoe!  Really... if you are making a cake who is concerned about calories?

Amazing recipe!!! Followed the instruction to the letter except I ommited the almond extract since I'm not a fan. I used the recipe to make a wedding cake and it was delicious. I did use one of the reviewers suggestions to make a chocolate layer as well. I put pastry cream in between the layers. Just amazing!!! Huge hit!

This cake is fantastic! I couldn’t find an 18.25 oz box of cake mix, so I used a 15.25 and it still turned out perfect. The only change I made was I added an extra 1/2 tsp of almond extract because I wanted a more pronounced flavor. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand! It’s got great texture and is sturdy enough to decorate into a tiered cake.

I made this cake just this pass Tuesday for a groom-to-be shower at work. I used the recipe for part of a Neapolitan cake so I used this only for the vanilla and strawberry flavors and made 2x9 inch. It's a fantastic recipe. I had a few other white/vanilla I could have chosen from, but I knew I could count on recipes from this site. Unfortunately, because I was alone in the kitchen at midnight, I had no time to take pics. But let me tell you, it was a show stopper at work! I decorated  the outside with the same flavors, piping it in rosettes. This is a keeper. My gratitude to the person who submitted it.

I made the cake recipe with no changes. Used Swiss buttercream icing. My grandson who rarely eats sweets, got into the cake I sent over for his family. He texted "Awesome cake! He brought it up again when I saw him 6 weeks later. A real hit!

This cake has become my fiancé’s favorite! Wedding cake is the only reason he goes to weddings. I decided to use mascarpone instead of sour cream by sheer chance. I thought I had SC at home already and didn’t but happen to have mascarpone instead. After some baking research I decided to just go with it and it was the best decision for sure!!

I make this for every special occasion cake.  I always get ooohs and aaahs on the taste and moistness.  
The only problem I have is that I usually make it in layer cakes and the recipe calls for one large rectangular cake pan.  Obviously, I always have to play with the cooking time.

Excellent recipe. It was moist and delicious. The only thing I did different was I used almond flour in place of the all purpose and did not use almond extract

As a person that only likes the nut, the almond flavor is not at all overwhelming. This cake taste like a old regular white cake, but then surprise you get that hint of almond, which is quite tasty.  Vanilla buttercream pairs very well with this cake. Next up with strawberry filling.

Delicious recipe. Just be careful that you use the full 18.25 oz size box! My first cake fell in the middle, but I made sure to use the appropriate amount of cake mix and used cake strips the next time and the cake turned out BEAUTIFULLY!! Lovely color and didn't stick to the pan AT ALL!

I made this recipe exactly as written except for baking it in a 9x13 instead of an 11x13 pan.  It took longer to bake since it was thicker.  But wow, it turned out perfectly.  The flavor, texture, and moistness was perfect.

It tastes like a basic cake mix. I mean no disrespect, but if I'm going to add that many more ingredients to a cake mix, I'll just  make the cake from scratch next time.

This cake is delicious. I did not trust it initially because it calls for cake mix, but I was pressed for time and decided to make it anyway... for my own wedding! It turned out great, everyone loved it and I’ve been asked to bake it again for other events.

I made this cake for my mother's birthday and it tasted great. My only complaint is that it took 50 minutes to bake, not 25 minutes as suggested. And the cake sunk in the middle. Maybe I did something wrong. I will definitely give it another try.

This does make a sturdy white cake.  I just used vanilla flavoring .  This recipe doesn't enhance the taste much (maybe the almond flavoring would have helped).  If I make it again, I'd cut back to 1/2 C of added sugar - family thought it was too sweet.

I take my desserts VERY seriously.  This recipe deserves your serious consideration; it's awesome!  I used a 15.25 oz cake mix and it turned out great!!!  With the smaller size cake mix than recommended, just to make sure it was still moist and dense I added 1 oz of custard powder (assuming 1 oz instant coconut pudding would work, too) and an additional 2 T oil.  I substituted 1 c plain greek yogurt.  As I prefer less sweet European-like desserts, I omitted the extra sugar and didn't miss it one bit.  I split the 2 layers into 4 and brushed the top of each layer with coconut milk (almond milk, regular milk with a bit of extract flavoring or cream would also work perfectly) with a super moist result.  I made it 2 days ahead of time, frosted and stored in the frig.  Absolutely fantastic!!!

This cake turned out kind of soggy for me. I accounted for the smaller cake mix size by adding 3 ounces from a second box of mix. It was difficult to remove from the pan and didn't hold its shape well. Next time I will try greasing and flouring the pan instead of just using Pam. The taste was good. I wouldn't use this for a large stacked cake.

Turned out SO perfect. It got rave reviews from everyone who tasted it  Making it again right now. I think it would be too much with pudding added like one of the reviews said to try. This is a great recipe as it is and I would not change a thing..

I’ve tried so many recipes for white cake and this is my favorite.  I usually use a blueberry cream cheese frosting with it but it’s great with other flavors, too.  I really love the flavor and texture of this cake.  The recipe is perfect as is, but I reduce the amount of sugar just because I prefer a little less sweetness.  The batter makes 3 9” rounds.  The recipe doesn’t specify to use room temperature sour cream and egg whites but you should.  Every time I use cold ingredients the centers of the cakes dip in the center but they still taste fine.  I love this recipe, it’s the only one I use for white cake and as a base for other flavors!!

I’ve never reviewed a recipe before. That’s how good this was. I don’t like desserts. And even I could manage a few bites of this cake. Super dense and moist, it was almost more like a banana bread texture. I followed the recipe, but then did as she suggested and used it as a base for flavor. I added one over ripe banana and fresh vanilla beans. Really incredible recipe. I used it for an English trifle....to die for. My husband has announced it’s his new favorite cake after 25 years of only liking a few cakes.

This was  a big hit with my family. The cake was very moist  and tasted like a scratch cake.  I was disappointed the recipe did not include  ingredients or directions for the center.  I ended up  whipping cream with some coffee , sugar and adding in toffee bits.  I used a buttercream frosting and put the bits on top of the cake  as well.

I was very unsure of how this recipe would turn out with the boxed cake ingredient but my fears were gone when I  took the first bite.  And the cake disappeared in minutes. I prepared recipe AS IS.  I sliced each cake horizontally and had a total of four layers that I covered with homemade raspberry purée.  It was phenomenal!!

This cake is to die for! I did beat the egg whites till they were fluffy, and folded them into the batter at the end. It made the cake more moist, and less dense. Other than that, I followed the instructions to a T. :)) Great for a wedding cake, or just for a decedent dessert.

This cake is absolutely delicious! I usually only eat cake to get to the frosting, but this cake is so tasty you don’t even need frosting. That’s like a miracle in my world, I eat frosting with a spoon and a glass of milk. The almond flavor is strong and makes this cake taste amazing. I used the recipe to create a teddy bear face cake for my son’s first birthday. Will be using this recipe all the time!

I have been using this recipe for several years now and always get rave reviews.  I have adapted it to every flavor you can imagine.  If I don't need a "white" cake, I use any flavor of cake mix and substitute 3 whole eggs for the egg whites. 
 You can substitute coffee, carmelized liquid sugar or fruit juice for the water, pumpkin for the sour cream...the combinations are endless and I've never had a flop!  The problem I now have is that Duncan Hines cake mixes have recently reduced their volume - very frustrating!  The larger mix always made a perfect amount for a 3-layer 9" cake.  Now I have to experiment to figure out what to add to get the volume I need, but I'll get there eventually!  Here is something I've learned about this recipe.  The cake holds up great to frosting and stacking, but it can be very crumbly when cutting and serving.  I now bake, cool, wrap and freeze the layers at least overnight and then I frost, fill and stack them right out of the freezer.  They are much easier to cut and serve if they've been frozen and it doesn't affect the taste at all.

Still tastes like chemicals.  Not even close to what we consider real cake.

Yum!  This was so good and has kept well the last few days in the fridge.  I used a glass 9x13 and baked for 40 minutes.  I can definitely see how people would use this recipe to make special occasion cakes.

This was easy to make and very delicious.  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.  My Sister was wondering if other flavorings could be used besides Almond?  Has anyone tried anything else?

So I added pudding mix (like another review suggested) , and instead of water I substituted milk. It was way too dense, and even a little sticky. The flavor was great, but that was it. A waste. Maybe if I followed these directions perfectly it would've been better, but I'm not going to try.

This cake recipe is almost exactly the same as the Almond Wedding cake in the Cake Doctor book.  The one in the book is doubled and requires a tad bit less water.  (I followed hers more closely and used the lesser amount of water.)  Believing you get out what you put in, I used full fat sour cream, Land of Lakes butter, and a Duncan Hines cake mix.  I was very nervous when I realized I failed to notice the discrepancy between the ounces in the recipe and the ounces on my box.  It turned out white, light in texture, not gummy at all.  I personally like the tiny bit of crunch (probably from the sugar) on the very exterior of the cake.  Sadly my daughter will probably cut the dome off when she decorates the cake.  (I bake them, she decorates them.)  Since the client requested almond flavor, I would probably double the almond next time.  All in all, I liked this cake and can't understand what all the fuss is about the mix.

Edited to add:  I contacted Ann Byrne, author of the Cake Doctor books, and asked her about the smaller cake mixes, if my success was a fluke, why some complained about gummy results etc.  She said that for some of her recipes it might not matter.  She has been testing some of her recipes with the smaller mixes.  For those where it did seem to matter more flour might need to be added (up to 6 T) and/or less water might be necessary.  Since her recipe used 1/3 less water, that could be why mine turned out.

My recommendation:  Don't wait until the day you need

I just made these last weekend for my sisters birthday and we loved them, however, when we tried them the day I baked them I was disappointed that you couldn't taste the almond. The next day they were perfect! My note was to definitely make these a day or two ahead.

Anyone that does not rate this 5 stars is making a mistake when making this.  You can overcook this and it still taste great!  Use a name brand cake mix for the base cake.  Also, note that current cake mixes and NOT the size of this recipe.  I make often so I just weigh it and add in the correct amount the recipe calls for.  I make wedding cakes so I do double it.  People go nuts over this.  You do not need to do a thing to this recipe it is perfect the way it is.  If you don't like almond of course you can just replace with more vanilla!

First, I am an experienced from scratch baker but went against my gut and tried this recipe because of the reviews on this site. The cake texture was nice, moist enough but in the end even after adding all the additions there was that  cake taste that to me, was unmistakable "cake mix" taste.  In the end, I knew I should never doubt my "gut".  I do not make a white cake very often and will continue to look for one that is true to my southern traditions!

Made this recipe for a wedding cake. It does NOT taste like a box mix, but was so much easier than making it completely from scratch. Everyone said it was delicious and every last piece was either eaten at the wedding or taken home by guests.

This cake is awesome! I make wedding cakes from my home and this is my most requested recipe, including the wedding cakes I've made for my kids! I make this cake as written. I add about 1/3 plain flour because I live at high altitude. Comes out nice and moist, sturdy, holds up to lots of tiers! I usually use a raspberry or strawberry filling.

OMG!!! This cake was absolutely wonderful! I made a flag cake for Veteran's Day and I didn't have a good white cake recipe. I read all the reviews and all said the same thing. It was moist, not crumbly. It cut well and it was eaten up in no time. This is going into the recipe file as wonderful!! Thanks so much

I just made my own 2 tiered wedding cake last week and this was wonderful, dense, moist and flavorful and held up great with my buttercream and many buttercream flowers. I thought the crumb was very good. per other suggestions,  I did add a bit more vanilla and almond and I made sure to sift the mix and flour. Very easy, cooked well and only needed a few minutes more.

This is the best white cake I’ve ever eaten, and my husband agreed!  It is super moist and doesn’t even need icing. I will be using this for every special occasion from now on. And I’m keeping it my secret. Lol!

I was leery of this recipe but the great reviews convinced me--had to make my nephew's wedding cake last week so decided to give this a try--it's fabulous!! The odd combination of ingredients seemed strange but the outcome is wonderful--it has an almost pound-cake like texture, is rather dense but moist. I will use this from now on when doing a wedding cake or even just when I want a good white cake. It's great...and I didn't change a thing.

This cake was a perfectly moist white cake that tasted like wedding cake.  I did everything the same as the recipe except I added a half box of vanilla pudding like some reviewers suggested.  I took it to a funeral dinner and it was devoured and a lot of people asked about the cake recipe.

I couldn't believe how wonderful this was! (And I'm not a big cake fan, tho hubby is). I did make a couple minor changes, subbing 0% low-fat yogurt for the sour cream and doubling the vanilla to omit the almond. This made 21 generous cupcakes (baked for 25 min), and while I did frost them, they didn't need it. Thank you for this recipe!

Made this for my daughter's wedding and it was a huge hit. I made it with bourbon vanilla bean buttercream frosting. It was moist, a bit more dense which is xactly what we wanted. This is not a light, fluffy cake.  It's rich and perfect for a special occasion. Will make agin for my son's wedding.

I'm not a white-cake person but I have made this cake several times for others' birthdays and it always gets rave reviews! I double the recipe, make a 3-layer cake and make cupcakes with the leftover batter. I usually use a cream cheese frosting but last month I added mashed strawberries to the icing and the recipient liked it better than with plain cream cheese frosting.

Very nice cake...I made it as per directions.. baked for 35 mins in two seperate pans. One was slightly underdone so 45 mins prob would have been better but was afraid to burn them. All in all everyone seemed to love the cakes!

This is an edit: Just made this for my son's first bday. Three tiers. Followed the recipe exact (used real vanilla extract and added an extra teaspoon) and imagine this, it was PERFECT. Super moist, perfect density and crumb, and the flavor was rich and sweet. Frosting seriously is not needed but it's cake, so I used the Special Buttercream Frosting recipe on this site and it paired so well because the frosting isn't sickly sweet. Do not make any changes to this recipe, or the frosting recipe. THANK YOU!

Great texture and density but was very little almond flavor although I put in the required amont. Will just add more next time. A lovely cake otherwise.

This recipe is amazing as is. I'm sure you could adjust it to your preference in terms of flavoring but it is a-ok without. I made this with a almond whipped frosting/icing (made over stovetop) and it was a "ten." People couldn't stop talking about it at work after I brought it in! Also, makes a generous amount. You will not have flat cakes!

This is an amazing recipe. It has definitely became one of my go to cake recipes. My family loves the cake too. They always request it for there birthdays. I find I need to bake the cake a little longer than the recipe calls for. All and all, I LOVE this recipe!

Thank you so much, this recipe is the best! I made a three tier wedding cake for my mom and everyone loved it. I've been looking for a semi-homemade recipe, and this is it! After reading the reviews, I also decided to try to make the chocolate and lemon versions... both came out perfectly! Trying strawberry next!

OK,  my b.f. and his kids really pretty darn fussy, my kids are not, I personally don't care for sweets much.....we all agree on this cake.  I use a butter cream frosting that's not overly sweet. Try this cake...it's amazing

This is an excellent recipe. The only thing I change is that I use a lot more almond extract to amp up the flavor.  This has gotten rave reviews for 2 wedding showers so far.  IF you're doing a double recipe on for a 15" cake pan that takes 2 mixes, remember to lower the temp and bake longer in order to not dry out the edges.  I've also tried another posters chocolate version and it was great too.

I just made this today because I just had a wild hair to make some cupcakes....I halved the recipe because, well, if I MAKE twelve cupcakes,chances are good that I'll EAT twelve cupcakes...They came out beautifully!  I used a large (6) pan.  Other than halving the recipe, my only other change was that I used light sour cream.  I frosted them with a chocolate buttercream recipe that I found on this site.  Suffice it to say, my wild hair has been calmed!  I loved how easy it was to halve this recipe!  I'm sure that wild hair will show itself again...this time I'll be ready!

I made this cake today.  I was anxious to try it!  I never had added so much to a cake mix, but it worked.  I thought next time I make it, I will cut the sugar down a tad.  Overall the cake was very good, very moist.  I put a layer of raspberry preserves between the layers, (I made two 9" rounds).  I made the butter cream frosting as suggested.  That was good as well.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly. The recipe made 36 regular cupcakes. I was expecting a dense cake but to my surprise, they were light and fluffy. The batter was as well. Especially after sitting while the 1st batch of 12 baked. (25mins) I'm not sure what happened. They were good but not what I wanted. :(

Made this the other day for a test Wedding cake for a friend. It did take 45 min. to bake. I used the " almost professional butter cream" to frost, and almond flavoring. It was the BEST white cake I've ever made. Never baked a cake that didn't dome in the center. Did a 9X13 and cut it in half to make a 2 tier. Perfect. A truly delightful cake. From now on, I'll never do just a plain 'ole white.

I followed the recipe exactly. Cake had a good (not great) flavor. A little drier than I expected but maybe I over cooked it. I would make a again though.

I cut sugar in half and probably could have cut it even more, and used 3 egg whites.  The cake had a good consistency--not too fluffy or too heavy, probably due to the sour cream (used fat free).  Frosted it with a pumpkin frosting I found on this site.

This cake was a bit too heavy and dense- I used a chocolate mousse filling and the top layer was so heavy it squished out. I did kind of like the texture play between the cake and mousse and the flavor of the cake was excellent. I'll probably try again and use cake flour.

Simply heavenly! Easy to make and just as good, if not better, than the bakery. I've made it at least three times now and every time it gets rave reviews from family and friends. Followed the recipe as directed.

This is the only cake I've ever made for an office birthday celebration that's been completely devoured, down to the last crumb; and not enough seconds for all who asked.  It's by far the best cake I've ever eaten.

Add 1 cup of sour cream and 1 package of Hershey's white chocolate instant pudding mix before mixing. I've used this recipe with all different cake mix flavors, as cupcakes, sheet cake, and layer cake. It always comes out rich, dense, and moist! Delicious! Try this for a yummy whipped topping frosting: cream 1 8 oz. package of softened cream cheese with 1 cup milk. Add 1 package of instant Hershey's white chocolate pudding mix. Stir or lightly beat in one large container of Cool Whip topping, (or the equivalent in sweetened whipped cream). It will hold its shape when piped through a pastry bag, tastes delicious, and has a much lower carb count than a sugar based frosting. Really good!

My cake turned out heavy .  For one thing I couldn't find the size of cake mix it called for, so I just used a little bit of another box.  Maybe that did it.  The frosting was delicious, will use that again.

This was exactly what I was after. I used this cake mix to make cupcakes, which I filled with raspberry pie filling, and then frosted with a vanilla-almond buttercream icing. YUM! 

This seems to be a pretty forgiving recipe. My boxed white cake mix was a 16-oz mix (instead of the 18.25 that the recipe called for), and I was short on sour cream. I used probably a little over half the amount called for (it was all I had). I did not adjust any of the other ingredients, even though I was short on those two items, and the cake still turned out wonderfully! I will definitely make it again... and hopefully next time I'll have the right amount of everything!

Very Good BUT it matters what cake mix you choose. I made this with a Betty Crocker mix and loved it. The next week I made it again with Pillsbury and it was not good at all.

I used organic whole milk plain yogurt in place of the sour cream, as I had it on hand.  This was amazingly wonderful, dense, rich and firm.  I will be making a wedding cake with this recipe next week, with coconut extract in place of almond, I'm sure it's going to turn out beautifully!

This was SO good!  I think it's the best cake I've had.  A wedding cake was being made and we needed to make the recipe 4 times for 2- 10" pans, 2- 8" pans, & 2- 6 pans.  We didn't want the almond flavoring so doubled up on the vanilla.  We used the powdered white vanilla (found in the grocery store) which adds excellent flavor to the cake.   If using the powdered white vanilla, it is best to add it to the dry ingredients.    We did have a bit extra cake mix which we baked and shared.  Can't wait to try it with other flavors of cake mix.  It is important to let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before turning out onto a rack to cool and then peel off the parchment paper (if you used it).  Thank you for a great recipe!

YUM. This recipe is perfect and super easy. I am actually using it for my friend's wedding cake but I did a test cake a couple months ago and then ended up using this recipe a second time for some cupcakes just because it's SO GOOD. I am a huge white cake fan and this one is delicious... It's dense but moist and tastes kind of like a sugar cookie.

The people I made it for loved it.   I found that it wasn't messy when cutting it and the almond flavors had people eating 2 and 3 pieces.  I, however, found it to be more like a pound cake and a little to heavy to transport a 6 layer cake.  Thanks for the recipe fun!!

I made just as written. But I did put in a 9x13 pan so the cooking time is longer.  Easy and great tasting. Frosted with cream cheese frosting and added several tblsp of strawberry jam without seeds to the icing.  excellent!!  thank you

This cake is very moist and delicious, and my whole family loves it.  I followed the directions exactly.  I did have to cook it a good bit longer than their instructions called for, but it could just be my oven.  I'll definitely be making this cake again.  I made a homemade buttercream frosting for it, and it was divine!

No changes to the recipe.  We baked 4 other 'from scratch' white cake recipes as trials for my parents' anniversary cake.  Finally, I decided to use this one. I was concerned that the cake mix was going to 'cheapen' the end product but I was very wrong.  This recipe was perfect for torting and filling (we used raspberry jam and Swiss merengue buttercream) and it held up beautifully without tearing or crumbling. The flavor was very good as well. The sour cream probably behaves like buttermilk in 'scratch' recipes.  One batch made enough to fill a 12 inch layer and  4 inch.  Or  10 and 6.

Such a great cake!  I made this cake exactly as written and baked it in two 9" round pans.  All together it took the cake ~35 minutes to bake.  As my icing, I used the chocolate mousse icing from "Chocolate Mousse Cake IV" from this site.  Such a great combo!  Will make again.

This  cake was the best cake I have ever made! I made it for my husbands birthday and he couldn't get enough of it! Personally I couldn't either. The cake was so moist and had the best flavor. It tasted so much like wedding cake. I actually could have eaten this cake without frosting. The only thing I changed is the type of oil I used. I have been substituting all my oils with coconut oil for baking.No change in the amount just use coconut oil. It makes it healthier!

I got so many compliments about this cake. I ended up making a four layer cake with chocolate buttercream frosting. Took this to my grandparents for a Memorial Day cookout. Everybody loved. I didn't change any othe ingredients. And it turned out moist and perfect.

The picture on this recipe shows a darker layer of something in the middle. Does anyone know what that is and how it's made?

Unfortunately this cake came out rather dry and very crumbly (not a texture I like). The flavor was just okay and I found that I could taste the sour cream.  I won't be making it again.

I have used this recipe a lot and love it!! I always get compliments when using this! Recently I have begun to use it for cipcakes and I have trouble with my cipcakes shriveling up when I remove them from the oven. Any ideas? And... Only the vanilla. If I make this recipe using a chocolate cake mix it's perfectly rounded tops every time!! I've tried adjusting my batter amount, cooking time and temp... Help!!! Is it the non stick pans? It's like they pull away from the edges... But again... Not with the chocolate! I'm hoping someone smarter than me can help!!

As with all baking recipes, I reduced the amount of water and replaced it with alcohol.  In this case, I used amaretto.  I loved the flavor it added.  The cake however was quite dense.  It was just ok.

I FINALLY made this for my moms birthday and Easter yesterday. I had been wanting to try it for awhile. It is so good! I mean really, really good. It is one of those cakes where you just want one more piece(: I did use heavy-cream instead of water. There is just something about water in a cake and I wanted to use my cream up. I used a 9 x 13 and did have to bake it for 45-50 min.  Very moist wonderful tasting cake. I used about 3 tsp. of almond flavoring too because of other reviews. It was perfect. It was just about gone by the end of the day!

I made a large sheet birthday cake - I doubled it and made it with french vanilla cake mix and did not add the almond extract (only because I did not have it on hand.) Everyone loved it and came back for seconds.  Thank you for sharing!

I've been baking since I was old enough to reach the kitchen counters and i have to say, this recipe is impressive!  I've made it several times, layering it with fruit spread or making a coconut cake out of it.  I get rave reviews every time, and people are shocked when they find out it starts with a cake mix.  GREAT RECIPE!

This cake is my go to for cakes and cupcakes and EVERYONE loves it! It's not too sweet and it has a wonderful texture. I make it with Rick's Buttercream frosting using all butter no shortening and I can't tell you how many compliments I get. They are really that good!!!!! 
*IF you dont have sour cream you can substitute greek vanilla yogurt ( I use Dannon light and fit Greek).  I also use two tsp. of vanilla and about 1/4tsp of almond extract.  Delish!

This is a keeper.  Super easy, super moist and great for doing layers.  I use this recipe now for pretty well all my cakes and just use a chocolate cake mix when doing a chocolate cake and white for white.

This recipe is my new face. I love the flavor, texture and how it bakes. It didn't rise higher in the middle. It was even and pleasantly dense. I made 2 - 8 inch rounds and had to add cooking time. Frosted it with a salted caramel icing, topped with sliced almonds and drizzled caramel

Made this for a baby shower. It came out great just a little more like sponge/pound cake than expected. I'll be making this again on Friday for my nephew's birthday and I'll use cake flour instead of all purpose. Made raspberry filling and a simple buttercream icing and it tasted great!

I made this cake for a Christmas party, frosting it with white chocolate buttercream and a raspberry filling; it received rave reviews.   At the suggestion of a reviewer, I added the egg whites separately, beating them till stiff and then folding them into the rest of the batter.  This made enough batter for 3 (8") round pans.  While this revision worked great, I plan to make this cake again as written to see how it compares and update my review.

This is my new go-to white cake recipe. It was delicious-my husband and I ate several with no icing at all and we didn't need it! They don't make cake mixes in that size anymore, but the box I used was I think 16oz and it worked out fine. The batter made 32 cupcakes and was super moist. It was fluffy, but dense enough to make a nice, sturdy cupcake. I made them for an event, so I left a few out, unsealed, to see how they held up, and they were just as delicious two days later after being left out. My husband took them to work and everyone loved them!

This was great; I need to find a cake mix that is 18.5.  All I had was a 16.5, but it still turned out great.  I will be using the recipe for all birthdays and special occasions in my house.  It did not last long in my house.

This recipe was very bland in taste. I would increase the almond if  I make this cake again. However it was very lite and moist. Our family kept it uncovered for over 24hrs and still remained moist. I wouldnt reccomend using it as a layered wedding cake because its to soft and lite.

Made exactly except that I used all vanilla extract since I didn't have almond. Perfect! Firm yet moist and velvety texture.

I used this cake mix for a topsy turvy mad hatter style cake which requires a fair amount of cutting/shaping.  The cake while very moist just fell apart.  It does have a good flavor and baked flatter than other cake recipes i've tried.  I would use this recipe again for a regular tiered cake.

Ah-mazing! Made it for my husband's birthday and it was a huge hit. I took some reviewers suggestions. Put the eggs in last. I bought store bought icing and whipped in strawberry preserves. I can't say enough great things. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe.  I doubled this recipe for a wedding cake because I had a last minute order. I usually bake everytihng from scratch. Here are a few changes I made:
Instead of 2 cups of water, I added 2 cups of buttermilk
Added 1 tsp of baking soda (because the buttermilk and sour cream are very acidic)
I used pasteurized egg whites
Also, I double sifted all of the dry ingredients before adding the wet
The cake turned out moist and delicious and not overly sweet.  It held up to being torted and filled with apricot preserves, frosted meringue buttercream and decorated with buttercream flowers.

I used this recipe for a cupcake bouquet. Box mixes tended to fall apart. It was perfect. Firm enough to keep its shape once mounted on the toothpick. I even filled them. I did double the almond extract and because the cupcakes were slightly bigger than normal, I baked them for about 25 minutes. This is a keeper!

I baked this cake this afternoon but like one other person had mentioned I used an 9x13 inch pan & also made 6 cupcakes. I wanted to use a disposable pan since I'm taking the cake somewhere & don't have the larger pan except in my good pans. I did bake both at 350 instead of 325 and the cake took about 35-40 minutes whereas the cupcakes were 30-35 minutes. I used a chocolate frosting recipe and decorated with sliced almonds. My husband & I both thought the cupcakes were really good. He wasn't sure he would like it as well with a white frosting. He even suggested they would be good with whip cream in the middle.

Must try this. Best cake I have ever made. Like many others I did not want an almond cake so I doubled the vanilla and omitted the almond extract. I also used two whole eggs instead of the egg whites nod it worked perfectly. I made a 12" x 3"  layer cake and it was very sturdy and easy to work with. It also keeps well with people raving about the cake days later.

have to try this, i am looking for cake recipes that are dense, i want a cake that one can just pick up and eat with their fingers without coming apart, as well looking for recipes that i can add flavors to, can you do that with this cake?

Made this as a practice for a wedding cake I have coming up soon, the bride wants white cake. Super easy, I had no problems with the cake mix being less than 18.25 ounces (used Duncan hines about 16 oz). Baked beautifully and holds up great. Definitely cut the almond extract in about half, even though I do like it and the cake was perfect. Still got a great almond flavor without being overpowering. Great texture, this is my new go to white cake! P.s. My pic is the single layer with chocolate frosting! ;)

Amazing!!!! This is the best cake I've ever tasted, let alone made.  I use this recipe for all my family and friends birthday cakes. It is the PERFECT carving cake because of it's dense texture. It holds heavy icing well too! I LOVE it!!

This made a really delicious cake, but I thought it was more crumbly and fluffy than dense.  It also lacked the distinct almond flavor. I'll definitely make it again but will add a lot more almond extract.

Wonderful cake!  The recipe for the almond butter creme frosting too is the bomb.  I just needed to increase the butter from 1/3 cup to a full cup of butter added a little pinch of salt too. Thanks Heidi for the butter almond frosting tip! Happy  baking to all!!

I baked 2 different recipe using cake box mix to compare.  My daughter liked this one best so we decided to use this recipe for her upcoming bday party.  We thought it was better the next day.  I'm not a fan of almond extract so I used vanilla instead.

I've made this cake twice & have had sooooooooo many compliments on it.  I used Pillsbury Moist Supreme Classic White cake mix as the base.  In the butter cream frosting, I add 1/4 tsp Fiori di sicilia (from King Arthur Flour Co) and the combination with the almond & vanilla extracts in the cake is outstanding.  This recipe is a winner!

I haven't tried this particular recipe with sour cream but we love almond flavored cake.I always made mine with a boxed plain white cake mix made according to the directions then added vanilla and almond extract and frosted it with chocolate butter cream frosting. It would never last in the house.

What a life saver!  Great crumb/density, stayed moist, fabulous flavor and better yet... EASY!!!  YUM!!!!  Definitely keeping this one as a standby!

Made some slight changes: 
1) used 1/2 tsp almond extract--which was perfect for me
2) added 1/3 cp sprinkles and made it a funfetti cake!
3) baked in 2 9" rounds for ~35", rotating 1x about 15" into the baking time
4) frosted with a vanilla Swiss Meringue Buttercream

PERFECT!  You wont' be sorry if you give this one a try!

Can you possibly add sprinkles to this cake to make it a "funfetti" cake for a children's birthday cake?

Tasty slightly dense cake. Not as light and moist as a box cake, making it great to layer and cut and mold for custom design cakes.

Wonderful cake recipe!  Loved the texture- dense but very moist and tender.  Came out of the pans like a dream and held up well to stacking for a triple layer cake.  I'll never use any other recipe for white cake!

I used this recipe, followed exactly, for my sisters 3 tier wedding cake and about 140 cupcakes. It was delicious both ways and i got raves from everyone about how amazing the cake was. I was even told I had found my new calling as a wedding cake baker. Wonderful and easy recipe  :)

The only thing I did different was use 3 whole eggs in place of the egg whites, and made into cupcakes (makes about 28 - I baked at 350 for about 21 minutes).  Frosted with the Smooth Buttercream Frosting recipe from this website(added scant 1/2 tsp. almond flavoring to the frosting).  These are delicious!

Great recipe.  I made as cupcakes and it was perfect.  I have made as whoopie pies, and it wasn't so great--the ultimate 'cake' was too moist for whoopie pies.  They stuck to the plate I served them on.  I tried cooking the next batch longer, and same result.   I will stick with these as cupcakes or cake

Yum!  I served this at my hubby's b'day party and it was a huge hit.  I ran out of regular flour so I used whole wheat pastry flour to replace the cup of flour it asks for.  It still worked out well and tasted great.  Thanks!

This is the first try for us altering a white cake mix! I have to say we were amazed at how wonderful and tasty the cake turned out! I have 5 different birthday cakes to make this weekend... and it's also going to be my go to recipe from here on in! Flavorful and moist....the one I made today, my sister in law and family loved it!! Except for eliminating the almond flavoring and opting to use all vanilla, we followed recipe to the T... I'm going to experiment tomorrow, using milk instead of water, going to sift the cake mix and flour. I baked it in a 9x13 pan, made the perfect sized cake!It does take a little while to bake it at 325, at least 40 to 45 minutes for me. Decorated it with my regular decorator frosting recipe. 
Thank you thank you Thank you for this recipe! LOVE IT! And it does NOT taste like a boxed cake mix.. NO WAY!

I made this as is but split into 5 layers and adjusted baking for time and temp. It is a fantastic cake. I have nothing to add. I see no need for any changes or additions and I dont think I could improve it. I did use cake flour, specifically.

I made this exactly as written, except I made cupcakes instead of a cake.  It is amazing!  Dense, moist and flavorful.  This will be my go-to white cake recipe from now on.

Following the recipe exactly, I made LOTS of cupcakes. We had the lobby of our local movie theatre decorated like a wedding reception and served these cupcakes for the premiere of "Breaking Dawn Part 1." I'm not a big fan of white cake, but this one is wonderful! Great taste and texture.

Perfect! And tastes even better on day two. Be sure you notice the ounce size for the cake mix. Most are 2 oz. less than this.

This is a wonderful cake... I've changed the box mix to chocolate and it was just as good as the white... It may be the only cake recipe I will ever make now. It's the best I've ever had!

This was by far the best cake ever!  The flavor and texture was absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make this again.  My family loved it. I didn't change a thing.  Kudos to owner of this recipe.

OMGoodness!  This is so good.  I love wedding cake and was in the mood for some.  I didn't have any sour cream so I used a combination of 4oz cream cheese and vanilla yogurt as a substitute.  I just whipped them together until I had about the same consistency as sour cream. Will definitely make this "revised" version again.

I forgot to rate this. So awesome. I was skeptical with the addition of so much flour and sugar. I made this for my friends  anniversary and it was wonderful. I added Limoncelo to a quality raspberry jam (I sieved to rid of seeds) so as to cut the sweetness.  so wonderful

This wedding cake recipe is exactly what I was looking for - tastes exactly how a wedding cake "should" taste, says me. I had no almond extract in the pantry at the time I made mine, but I doubled up the vanilla extract instead, and the result was quite yummy. Will definitely be making this one again!

White Wedding Cake was my son's favorite cake so for his birthday this year, I decided to try a new recipe.  This cake was wonderful!  Very dense and moist so it didn't crumble all over the place.  We loved it!

Excellent texture and taste! I made this recipe into cupcakes for sending to school for my son's birthday. I omitted the almond extract and doubled the vanilla. So much better flavour than a cake mix alone. I won't make just plain old white cake mix cake anymore...

I made this for my daughter's baptism and everyone loved it. My husband's family is full of amature cake bakers/decorators and they said it was one of the best cakes they've ever tasted. This will become my standard cake recipe from now on.  Make sure you let the cake cool completely. I tried to take it out of the pan before it was completely cool and a little bit stuck to the pan.

This was a delicious moist cake with flavor that's not too overpowering. I think the almond extract gives the cake a richer flavor and not so much like a boxed cake mix. I used canned frosting and 2 whole eggs. Simple to make and would be wonderful to experiment with different flavors of frosting.

I made this cake as an anniversary cake for my husband and I.  I kind of agree with other reviewers that I'd rather have been able to say that I made this from scratch instead of starting with the white cake mix.  I had to measure sugar and flour anyway... it doesn't seem like it saves you that much time. The cake baked up well, although I had to leave it in the over longer than the recipe called for.  My only complaint is that it seemed overly crumbly.  I probably won't make this recipe again and will look for a white cake from scratch and perhaps add almond extract.

This was moist and dense, perfect for decorating with fondant, or layers with buttercream.  Everyone liked it too!  I will say that it still tasted like box cake to me, but since that is what most people expect out of cake, it wasn't a huge problem.  But, if you're going for "scratch" taste, you should keep looking.

I tried this recipe yesterday exactly as written.  Only substituting coconut extract for the almond.  YUM!  I can't stop eating it.  It is dense and moist, even after I forgot to take it out of the oven for 10 extra minutes.  It took a lot longer to bake then the suggested 25 minutes, but that may be my oven.

This is even better than a 5 star recipe!  Amazing!  I will never make just a boring white cake from a box again!  I make sure I sift the dry ingredients first and I also use clear vanilla extract.

Yummy!  My whole family LOVED this cake.  The frosting recipe (Buttercream) was a little too sweet for the cake though, next time I'll try something else. There will be a next time!  Probably Easter!

Wow so good!  Made this today for my sister's birthday and so perfect.  So moist and flavorful.  I could just eat the cake without the frosting or anything.  This is going to become one of my go-to recipes.
**Update 10/16/10 - Made this cake again and I filled it with a combination of raspberry preserves mixed with raspberry jello.  Frosted it with the Special Buttercream Frosting from this site.

Possibly the best cake I've ever eaten.  Texture, taste, ease in preparing and appearance are all excellent!  I've been known to go to weddings of people I didn't even know just to eat a piece of cake at the reception, so I know cake!  I baked it exactly as stated in the recipe and frosted it with a buttercream frosting, adding 2 tablespoons all purpose flour and 2 teaspoons corn syrup.

Oh my gosh!  I can't believe how good this cake is.  I just met with a baker to pick out my wedding cake last week and their white cake wasn't nearly as good as this!  I'm trying to find a way to serve this one at my wedding...  This is so moist and the almond buttercream frosting makes it even better.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this cake for a friend's birthday as his request for his 50th birthday cake was a good wedding cake.  This cake was fabulous!  He is also particular about the frosting so I used the Waldorf Astoria Frosting and it was perfect!  He loved it and it was a big hit with all of the guests!

This has become my 'go-to' cake recipe.  I have made it white (AMAZING!), chocolate, red velvet (with german chocolate mix and a 1 oz bottle of red food coloring).  All are wonderful!  I personally like using DH mix and definately do not think pudding mix is needed.

I made this with a chocolate cake mix and instead of the almond extract, just used all vanilla.  This was one of the best cakes I ever made and it was a huge hit with my family.  I would try this with any kind of cake mix because it was dense like a like cake to be and it was super moist.  I baked it in a fluted pan and it took about 37 mins.  To the rater who complained about spending 70 mins sifting the mix...it doesn't say in the instructions to sift it, although I did it myself.  It took me all of 5 mins to sift it using a metal strainer and a plastic scraper.  Glad I did because there are little balls of whatever in there.  Highly recommended.  I'll use the recipe every time now!

I agree with one of the other reviewers who said they had to double the baking time. I ended up baking it almost an hour. I baked it for my husband (who is from Germany who will adores anything almond-flavored) and he just loved it. Tastes like a professionally-made cake with very little work.

This was my very first wedding cake for my daughter's wedding. The recipe was just perfect and so easy. I made a raspberry butter cream filling to go with it. It made me very proud.

I love this cake. I have made it 3 times so far - each time for fondant birthday cakes. It holds up well to the heavy fondant and tastes like heaven. My in-laws are wedding photographers and they think this is better than the majority of cakes they have had and they have had a lot of them.

This cake is the best!  Everyone who has tried it, loves it.  My husband loves it and he is not a big sweet eater.  I have friends request it when I do a cake for them.  I encourage everyone to try it because it is definately a keeper.

This was wonderful!! I did not add the pudding like some suggested. I did double it though and put it into a 16 1/2 x 12 1/2 pan. It was gone! Everyone had at least 2 pieces throughout the day.
