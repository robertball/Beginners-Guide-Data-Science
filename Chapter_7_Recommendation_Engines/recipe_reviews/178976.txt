I gave this recipe 3 stars for flavor.  It was extremely easy - good for a busy weeknight, but the meat turned out a little tough and the flavor was not as robust as I was expecting.  I will try it again, but increase the soy sauce and garlic powder.  I also will try simmering the meat in the beef broth before adding the corn starch slurry.

We’re headed home from Naples tomorrow and, as always, this was the ideal quick and easy dish to make when I wanted something to clean OUT the leftovers, not create them. And it seems we always have stray peppers and onions to make use of. We used a NY strip steak rather than the sirloin, not because it was necessary but because Hubs insisted upon it.  I stuck it in the freezer for about 20-30 minutes so it was easier to slice thinly.  I like tomato in my pepper steak, and it just so happened we had one to make use of as well.   I used fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder, but outside of that I pretty much followed the cooking instructions closely.  I did, however, quickly stir fry the beef, removed it and set it aside, then stir fried the peppers and onions.  I returned all to the pan, along with tomato wedges, before adding the cornstarch/broth mixture.  Only because we had some broccoli to use did I  serve it with this dish, but it turned out to be a good pairing (in fact, I stirred my dinner altogether on my plate :)  Once again, we enjoyed a terrific dinner making use of odds and ends before we headed out on a flight again and needed to clean out the fridge.

I liked this recipe. I always wondered how to get more sauce with my meat. I actually didn't follow as such not because I did not like the way above it is just because I started my cooking my meat than figure I wanted something different than just steak. What I did was I broiled my seasoned and broiled my steak. I actually simmer the sauce above than added my peppers,onions and meat (that I sliced after I broiled it, I like broiling my meat because even tough meat comes out not so tough)and let it thickened. The peppers really came out in the broth mix. I like this recipe because it is simple and yummy.

The recipe was really good.  I just added about ten chopped up baby carrots, and used thin cut breakfast steaks instead of the top sirloin.  Overall we all enjoyed it and we will make it again.

I like this recipe. It's really good. I added more water into the cornstarch mixture though so that it's not too high in sodium. But will definitely do this again.

This is pretty good and very easy to prepare.  I added a dash of gravy master browning sauce just to give it a nicer color.  I used low sodium broth and soy sauce and it was still pretty flavorful.  I’ll be making this again.

We like this recipe.    I also simmer the meat until tender then add the other ingredients.  I had trouble with themeat being too tough for my taste. This is the  recipe most like our favorite from Chinese take out.  Very good.

I always do my own spin on Chinese and this was no exception.  I substituted fresh garlic  and flat iron steak (cut across the grain).  Flat iron steak makes an excellent gravy and reduces the amount of broth needed.  I added celery for texture and paprika (couldn't find anything else that would work) for "earthy hints".  I have to go easy on soy, so salt and pepper picked up the slack.  The black pepper and plenty of simmer time gave this a really authentic taste.  This is good stuff - good luck!

This was good, with a few alterations. I didn't have peppers so I used carrots,mushroom and broccoli. I was out of soy, so I used teriyaki(and a few splashes extra).Lastly I pounded the meat with a tenderizer and seasoned the steak with pepper and paprika before sauteing in the pan with olive oil.

I absolutely love pepper steak but lost my faithful recipe somewhere in the move.  I have tried others before this, but this one beat them for flavor by far and came closest to my original recipe!  I used leftover bbq'd steaks, cut very thin and into bite size pieces. I used 2 c. water with two packs beef bouillon powder instead of the swansons brand and I added freshly minced garlic cloves.  After reading other reviews I tasted the broth and kept adding soy sauce until it had the flavor i was seeking.  All in all, i used about 4 tbsp low sodium soy sauce.  I used 2  fresh green peppers and 1 red pepper and 1 large onion, all thinly sliced and bite size pieces.  Until i find my Grandmother's original recipe, this will definitely be the recipe I use!  Thank you for sharing!

I have been making this for years, with just a couple of variations from the posted recipe. I brown my steak, then add the peppers & onions with a cup of water or broth, cover the skillet and simmer for 30 -60 minutes (depending on how crisp you want your veggies.) This infuses the pepper & onion flavor into the steak. Then, I add an additional cup of liquid (more if you like lots of sauce) with the cornstarch, 1 teaspoon minced or crushed garlic, and 3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce. 

I serve this with a blend of wild rice and white for a great texture.

I turned this into a crockpot meal. I added baby carrots. I did not have any beef broth, so I used water and added 1 package of onion soup mix. Adding 1/4 tsp. of ginger pdr. adds good flavor. It turned out great.

Made this tonight and has become an instant family favourite. A couple of changes I made was 2 Tbsp Soy Sauce (China Lily) and didn't have cornstarch so, used 2 Tbsp flour. End result I don't think was affected. I cooked my peppers in Olive Oil as well as fresh mushrooms and then once gravy/steak was ready to serve, put it all into the same pot. My daughter (4-yo) went back for seconds and she never goes back for seconds.  Highly recommend this a try for anyone.  Bon Apetite !!

tasted really good; I would recomend really tenderizing the meat if you can't get really good cuts.  Easy to accomplish with or without a wok

This was a very good recipe.  I did make several changes.  I did not use cornstarch because I prefer to brown the steak in a little flour and olive oil.  Therefore, the cornstarch is not needed.  I also did not use soy sauce because I season the meat (prior to browning) with garlic powder, onion powder, and seasoned salt.  I used fresh onions, garlic, and red, green, and yellow peppers.  Last, I did not use white rice.  I used brown rice with sauteed, diced multi-colored peppers, onions, and garlic.  Fabulous.  My family REALLY enjoyed this!  Thank you.

I Did Add More Low Sodium Soy Sauce, But This Recipe Is Sure A Keeper. I Put Three Different Types Of Peppers (RED,YELLOW,GREEN). It Looks Great, It Smells Great, It Is Easy. Thank You From Florida!! And I Prepared Jasmine Rice. This Is So Good.

PERFECT!!!  I doubled the soy sauce and let the meat simmer in a 1/2 cup of beef broth to tenderize a little before adding the veg and corn starch mixture.  Also, you will need to add some salt to your rice, but not much.  This is a KEEPER!!!

Thanks for sharing. Here is my version of the recipe. I actually used flank beef steak cut into pieces and I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper before browning, to give it a little more flavor. Next time I’ll make it; I will reduce the amount of cornstarch and add the pepper later in the cooking.

OMG this was awesome.  I changed it up a bit but this is a good base recipe.  I have a big family so I got 2lbs of chuck steak and cut it up. Added more garlic and soy sauce than the recipe called for.  I also added a bag of frozen chinese vegatables.  Very good and will make it many many more times.

I made this as part of an All Star project for July using Bird's Eye Recipe Ready veggies.  I changed up the sauce a bit and added a bit of Sriachi chili sauce because they flavor is so lovely and added a bit of mirin and hoisin sauce to the soy sauce.  I didn't use rice, but Udon noodles.  It was pretty good and I'd do this for dinner again

I just made this for dinner tonight. It came together really quickly and we all thought it was quite tasty!  I did find it a little salty but I'm still not sure why since I used lower sodium soy sauce and I only used the 1TB called for, unlike many other reviewers who added even more. The only changes I made was to (1) use real garlic (finely minced) in place of the powder and (2) sprinkle a dash of ground ginger in with the cornstarch mixture.  I felt the sauce came out somewhat thick for my liking so next time I'd probably use a little less cornstarch. Overall, a great and easy recipe that I will definitely be adding to our dinner rotation.

We loved this.  My butcher suggested that I use cube steak for this (because it was on sale) and it turned out wonderful.  I would definitely use cube steak again.  This was sooo easy to make too!

This was really quick and easy, and it tasted great. My whole family can't wait for me to make it again. The only thing I changed was using real garlic instead of garlic powder.

Very easy,very good.  I also chose to simmer a semi-tough piece of meat in the broth for a little bit to tenderize it some I also found it a bit lacking so I added some teriyaki sauce to it. All in all very well received. Thanx.

Couldn't have been easier! One two three... And it was my first attempt. I seasoned the meat while cooking and then again when I added the veggies with salt and pepper. Put garlic powder in the mix with a table spoon of minced garlic. Was awesome. Even my kids raved about it:)

I did as others instructed and cooked the steak with 2 tbls of minced garlic and sprinkled black pepper on the steak added the peppers when the steak was nearly done so that they wouldnt burn.  I also doubled the soy sauce and garlic powder.  I am not a chinese food person but this was yummy!

I made this the other day for company.  I modified it to be gluten free and put the steaks in the oven for 1 hour to tenderize and absorb flavor.   My guests were crazy about it, so I'll make it again soon.

This was very good! My changes are as follows: I added some extra veggies (baby corn) and I sprinkled some Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy on top of my dish.  Much healthier than Chinese take out.

I always like to use what I have on hand, so I substituted whole wheat flour for the cornstarch and as others suggested, I used 2 tbs of soy sauce instead of one. I also used 3 minced cloves garlic, a vidalia onion and fresh bell peppers and sauteed all in mild olive oil. I didn't have white rice, so I used preboiled brown rice. My hubby loved it!

Actually I made this because it was easy,had 4 1/2 stars,and we had a bunch of left over steak from grilling the night before. Honestly I didn't have much confidence in this recipe but was so suprised!!! This is INCREDABLE!!!!!!!!!! We all loooooved it and will make it again soon! I made extra sauce and made strong beef broth out of Better Than Bullion. Added extra garlic and soy. My husband is the master of the grill and I am the master of seasoning so together we create steak house quality steak and some say even better but the propane ran out while he was grilling and we had to finish the cooking in the oven. The steak was tough and like leayther. It was the worst steak I had ever put in my mouth. A total desaster and we had company!!!  But I used this in the pepper steak and it was marvelous!!!! Some how it became more tender and the seasoning of the steak was the perfect  touch!!!! This recipe is restraunt quality and one we will pass down through our family! Thanks for adding it. It kept us from throwing away over a pound of steak!!!!

The first time I made this I didn't have any soy sauce and oddly enough, no steaks.  But I was desperate for something different for dinner that night and used lean ground beef instead.  My family loved it so much that I made it again last night using bottom round.  I let it simmer longer than stated, as a matter of fact, I didn't start the rice cooking until after it was simmering, so maybe 30 minutes total.  Definitely a keeper that will get used often.

I made this recipe for the first time today.  It was really GOOD! After reading other reviews & people complaining of tough meat, I bought meat that was already cut for stir fry.  Not only did it guarantee an easier prep but the meat was very tender.  I doubled the recipe, except still used 1 can of broth.  I also added a can of diced tomato for color and nutrition.  I also used flour bc I didn't have cornstarch and the sauce still thickened.  My family loved it, including my 3 year old minus the bell peppers and onions.  It literally took me 15 minutes.  It was great!

this is very good,I did do a few minor changes, first,I bought a beef bottom sliced steaks pounded them out to about half an inch or 3/4 inch.I slightly seasoned with fresh garlic,salt and pepper then I put the meat in cornstarch and rolled them around,cooked the meat.while the meat is cooking,I didnt have beef stock so I used beef boullion  cubes with hot water added fresh minced garlic,lots of blk pepper a dash of salt(make sure the boullion mixture is not too salty,u can dilute if it is with more hot water or delete the salt)and red pepper flakes,shoyu (soy sauce) and maggi (yellow bottle,look in the mexican aisle or next to the steak sauces or worcestershire).Now back to the meat,once the meat is slightly still red in the middle I added sliced mnushrooms,sliced onions and sliced red and green bell peppers cook till meat is done to your liking then add the boullion mixture simmer,stirring often cover and simmer till thicken (meat is so tender if u have enough liquid and simnmer to soften).served over white rice and a salad its very good.I had leftovers for brunch with an over medium egg on top,this was so delicious.

This was super easy.  I've made with the cornstarch and beef broth, but I like it better using a mix of canned consomme and beef gravy instead.  I also add extra garlic, water chestnuts, ginger, and pepper.

Was great!  My picky husband loved it.  I did have to add more broth and it still didn't seem "saucy" enough, so I will do about 3 cups of broth next time.  There will be a next time ;)

I really enjoyed this recipe. I actually made it using deer meat & added white pepper to give it a little kick. The whole family loved it! I will definately make it again.

If I was rating this on taste alone I would have given it three stars as it is not amazingly flavorful.  However, it's a great base (and VERY easy) and there's a lot of room to play around.  The only things I did differently for the first attempt was to add crushed garlic and I used flour instead of cornstarch simply because that's what I had on hand.  Will definitely make this again with some changes...when I figure out what those changes will be.

This was my first attempt at a Pepper Steak (my hubby's top 3 favs) and it name doesn't lie.  Although very easy to make it was still tasty.  The only change I made was I started with a beef bouillon as that is what I had on hand and added minced garlic to the skillet while stir-frying the beef as family preference for garlic.  Thanks to this recipe the hubs will be enjoying one of his favorites more often.

way too much cornstarch,it's too thick..I prefer a little thinner...added fresh garlic also (4 cloves ) and I used tenderloin only because I had the tail to use up..also added extra soy sauce and some powdered ginger...I will make again using 2 tbsp of cornstarch

This is a great base.  It doesn't have a lot of flavor just in the recipe, which is kinda cool because it lets you play with the spices a bit.

I made this and my family just loved it.  I had to make an second batch. My steak was so tender, after I browned it, I put it in the oven while the rice was cooking.  I will cook this more often.

I have made this several times using venison cubes and peppers out of our garden (green bell peppers and sweet Italian fryers) and it has become a family favorite!  I usually serve it with Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild rice, the flavors just go very well.  Mushrooms are a good addition, as are water chestnuts, and pierogies make a good alternative to rice.

My mil always makes this...but she isnt here and Im CRAVING it!!  So this is the closest I could find, except I added about a tbls of Worcester sauce and about 2 or 3 more tbls of Soy sauce, and I let the meat mixture simmer for about 2 hours before adding the peppers, onions and mushrooms, then I simmered it for about another hour...maybe less, just to let the veggies get a little tender.  Oh and I did put a big chunk on pepper and onion in the gravy to flavor it while it simmered!!  DELISH!!

I made this with ground beef and my husband raved about it (and he doesn't even like vegetables!)
