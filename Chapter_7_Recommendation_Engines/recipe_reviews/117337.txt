I saw this recipe in quick cooking and it is awesome! However in the magazine it said 1-2 tbsp chili powder; 1-2 tsp cumin I always put 2 tbsp chili powder and 2 tsp cumin and it is awesome! I noticed that someone else added V-8 juice to thin it out, well at first it is thick and not much juice but when you bring it to a boil and the longer that you let it simmer the more juice is produced. I have made this recipe for about 2-3 years now and it is everyone in my families favorite. If you want it spicier add more  jalape√±o pepper w/seeds. I also add to my own bowl a few shots of Texas Pete. MMMM I also always use extra lean ground beef for a healthier option.

I actually made this a while back and never rated it...I just came back to find it to make it again.  I usually don't try recipes that haven't been rated a lot but it seemed easy so I thought I would try it.  After I cooked the meat, onion and green peppers, I threw everything in the crockpot and cooked it on low all day.  It turned out wonderful...I topped with shredded cheese, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips :)

I've never liked chili til now! This was the first time I've made it from scratch, so no wonder, right? My boyfriend really loved it too and we're having it for lunch again today! I didn't have an onion, so I used scallions and I also didn't have a jalapeno, but it still came out spicy enough.

This was delicious!  I started by browning the ground turkey with the peppers and onion and seasonings (I upped the chili powder to about 3 T and the cumin to 2 t.), and I also added a few shots of Tabasco.  I used frozen homemade stewed tomatoes left over from my garden, and I used only black and kidney beans.  The result was great, and along with homemade corn bread, made for a yummy winter meal!

my first time ever making chili and this chili is awesome! super easy to prepare and even better the day after you make it!! for the most part i followed this recipe to a "T" except i ended up using two cans of stewed tomatoes and two cans of peeled whole tomatoes which i believe helped to thicken the chili and the two cans of peeled whole tomatoes actually turned out to be lower in calories, carbs & sodium than the stewed tomatoes, which made this chili even healthier. at first it seemed like a lot of beans, but in the end it just helped make this chili a hearty, chunky chili. next time around, i will add more spices & jalepeno pepper to give it the extra kick.  A sure hit and tastes great with some mexican cheeses mixed in & saltines on the side.  thank you for a great recipe!!

Excellent chili!  I cut the stewed tomatoes to 3 cans and added 1 can of petite diced tomatoes.  Also added 3 C of V-8 juice to thin recipe a bit.

I had a recipe similar to this and lost it! This recipe was just as good! I did omit some items (green pepper, jalapeno and cayenne pepper) simply because i did not have them on hand. And i added a small can of tomato sauce. I cooked the turkey and onion as directed and then just threw everything in my crock pot and let cook on low for about an hour!! It was delicious!! Thanks!!

I left out the pinto beans in favor of an extra can of kidney beans. I use one can of dark kidney beans and one can of light, just to add color variety. I also added 3 cloves pressed garlic and let some of the water boil out for a thicker chili. It was delicious and had just a little bit of heat.  To make it even better, I served it over corn bread :)

Good basic chili, quick and easy to make. Added a few cloves of garlic,  2 jalopenos, and tripled the ammout of chili powder. Also browned the turkey in a seperate pan, drained it, and added the meant to the onion/pepper/garlic that I sauteed in olive oil. Turned out well.

Easy, flavorful, economical and wholesome - enough to feed a crowd.  I substituted 2 (16 ounce) cans of tomato sauce for 2 cans of the stewed tomatoes which made the chili thicker and also more visually appealing.  I also tried Ancho chili powder for the first time and it was delicious!  I highly recommend the recipe.

This is very good and very quick. For a little extra flavor, I like to:
1. Brown the turkey in two batches so I get some fond in the dutch oven.
2. Use the onions and about 1/4 cup red wine to deglaze the pan, before
3. Adding all the ingredients back.

This extra step gives it a meatier flavor, so that it tastes a lot like beef chili.

Made a few slight adjustments regarding beans and loved, loved, loved this chili. Would have browned the turkey first and removed from pan and then do the onions and peppers. That way the onions and peppers would have their own delicious flavors. Great recipe. Thanks.

This is an excellent hearty chili recipe. It makes a lot, so use a big stockpot. I made a couple of changes based on what I had in my pantry. Rather than using 4 cans of stewed tomatoes, I went with 2 28 oz. cans of whole tomatoes and broke (or squished) the tomatoes into the chili so the pieces would be smaller. I also did not have any cumin, so I tripled the chili powder. Finally, I added a couple of dashes of hot sauce to make it extra spicy. My family loved this and I will make it again.

I made this in the crock pot and its fantastic! Instead of jalapenos and green pepper, I added canned chopped green chilies and it was the perfect kick for our tastes. Delicious and so easy!

Very flavorful chili!  Loved it!  I substituted stewed tomatoes with jalapenos, garlic, and cumin instead of plain and left out the jalapeno.  Also used red pepper instead of green because I like the taste better.  It was spicy, but not too hot.  Perfect.

Great recipe good flavor. I made the mistake of using turkey breast meat and the texture and flavor of the meat wasn't great I would definitely use ground turkey next time. Good recipe.

My whole family loved this.  I added a little dried ground chipotle pepper instead of the jalapeno, and used Mexican style canned tomatoes (the kind with onion and peppers already in there).

Amazing and super easy!  Followed the recipe for the most part but did a few things different.  Here they are: 
-Used 1 green and 1 red pepper. 
-Added 2 garlic cloves chopped when I added the onion. 
-Left out the jalapeno pepper but used about 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of 1/4.
-Added a 15 oz can of corn, not drained.
-Added a 4 oz can of diced green chiles.
-Used a little bit more of each seasoning except for salt.  Added some fresh ground black pepper, just to taste.
-After bringing to a boil I simmered extremely low uncovered for about 35 minutes so it would thicken up.  Stirring occasionally.
-Sprinkled a little bit of 2% Mexican cheese over chili once served.

Great and simple recipe. I brought it to a potluck late so not many people got to try it but my husband said it was really good and that's what counts. He couldn't even tell it was turkey!

Really good, hearty chili!  My husband loved it; no need to tell him that it's healthy for him, too.  It's a stick to your ribs kind of meal that's tasty and easy and good for you -- basically, a great recipe.  I have this one in my rotation now.

I did not have the black beans, pinto beans or jalapeno pepper, but it is a good basic recipe.  I will make this again because it is cheap to make and good to eat!

AWESOME!  Took this recipe camping - just browned the meat with my pre-chopped veggies and dumped in the cans into one pot (w/o rinsing).  I also added a can of corn and a big can of green chilis (skipping the jalapeno).  I put all the spices into one ziplock baggie and I used:  2 T. chili powder and 2 T. cumin.  I also added red chili flakes and used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  I'm halving the recipe and putting it in a crock pot for tonight.  YUM!!!

Very good chili. I added garlic and celery to this recipe. Next time I am going to add brown sugar for a little sweatness.

I will make this over and over. It was a hit for a Christmas party at work today.... Very good recipe for turkey chili and easy to make as well. At the end I did tweak it a bit by adding some V8 to thin it out, but Other than that it was great! Not to spicy and not too bland! Definitely recommend!

This was a really good, not great recipe. As written it was a bit bland & not thick enough. My pot was thick FULL of ingredients - tomatoes, beans, turkey, onions & bell pepper - but the liquid part was just watery. I'm not sure if it was because I didn't drain or rinse my beans (but I don't think so because their liquid is on the thick side, not to mention full of flavor) I ended up mashing the stewed tomatoes plus added 8 oz. of tomato sauce to help thicken the liquid then doubled the chile powder & cumin, plus added a teaspoon of dried oregano & 3 cloves of sauteed garlic, oh & a can of drained corn. This made it tastier & my crowd was pleased.

Delicious! 

I cooked it a lot longer than 20 minutes (90 min) and doubled all the spicy ingredients. I also did not drain any of the beans and didn't have any troubles with the soupiness of the chili - it's a perfect consistency.

Try the jalapeno, it adds a nice heat and tons of flavor!

Delicious!  I feel less guilty when eating this Chili.  2 "mistakes" I made: I only used 2 cans of kidney beans and 1 pound ground turkey (no one else but me eats chili) and I mistakenly kept the spices the same, but increased the cayenne pepper by a teaspoon (no jalapeno).  I like chili heavily spiced, so this was not a problem for me.  I did, however, add small amounts of water until I reached the consistency I was looking for.

You'll love this right after you make it, but it gets even better the next day!

Wonderful go-to chili recipe! My family doesn't eat red meat so the turkey option was a good, healthy one for us. I found that after a good half hour of sitting, it still needed some thickening. The problem was easily solved by a sprinkle of cornstarch. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend!

As written this chili is a bit bland.  I doubled the chili powder and cumin as other reviewers have also stated.  Also since ground turkey comes in the 20oz packages I only used that amount and to make up for the lack of meat I added 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks and a yellow pepper (in addition to the green pepper) Love my veggies!  I only had 3 cans of stewed tomatoes so I added 1 can of petite diced and it worked out well.  I pulsed the stewed tomatoes in the food processor easier than chopping so many cans of them.  If your stewed tomatoes don't have basil and oregano in them you would want to add that to the chili.  My stewed tomatoes didn't have garlic so I added some minced to the chili as well.  I salted the veggies while they were sauteeing so I didn't add any salt later.  With all this it had great flavor and a spice level that is mellow enough for most children.  I like a lot more heat so I added sriracha chili sauce to my own bowl.  Very yummy!

Amazing! The best chili I have ever made (and I wasn't too keen on turkey chili) 
I added: 4 cloves of crushed garlic,  a french onion bouillon cube (or use beef),  doubled the chili powder and cumin, a teaspoon of oregano and a tablespoon of molasses. DELISH!

Hearty, delicious and good for you! What a great, forgiving recipe. We added 2 zucchinis, 1 can of Guinness beer, and used dried instead of canned beans (1 cup for each can. Boiled beans for 2 minutes and then set aside for 1 hour. Then drained and used). Finished it off with a lot more spices including cumin, chili powder and cayenne pepper. Can't wait to try it again for our next football-watching party!

This recipe was excellent and made just a couple of changes. We eat mostly organic and Muir Glen is my favorite line of organic canned tomato products!
I substituted a red pepper for the green pepper and added 4 cloves of garlic (pressed) to the turkey, pepper and onion while cooking.
I substituted 2 cans of Muir Glen Fire Roasted Diced tomatoes (w / jalapenos)in place of 2 cans of the stewed tomatoes. This gave it just the right amount of kick and the roasted tomatoes gave it so much flavor. 
I didn't have a can of black beans, so I used an extra can of pinto beans. 
I simmered for one hour vs. just 20 minutes. 
Garnished each bowl with Light Sour Cream and shredded Tillamook Reduced Fat Cheddar.
My husband went back for thirds and even my picky daughter ate two servings! 
This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe, though after tasting the recipe (exactly to specs) I had to add more spices as my huband and I felt it was somewhat lacking in flavour for our taste.  Overall, very good, will make again.

This was average. It's a fine basic chili recipe, but it didn't have a whole lot of flavor. I think you miss out by not seasoning the meat. It turns out to be quite bland.

I made this and it was great! My son hates beans and still ate all of it and loved it.  My daughter, who never eats anything but quesadillas, even asked for seconds.  I had to ask her to repeat herself because I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  AND she asked for leftovers as a snack the following day...it's a winner! :)

I used ground turkey breast, omitted the jalapeno, and added a can of Campbell's condensed tomato soup and 2 Tbs butter. Served with a variety of hot sauce choices and sourdough bread. I fed 11 of my in-laws and everyone loved it!

EXCELLENT!!  The only change I made was doubling the cumin and chili powder as another reviewer suggested. I also used a large jalapeno and used the entire inside of it to increase the spiciness and a bit extra cayenne pepper.  Mine was not too thick at all- just the right consistency.  Thank you for the recipe!

I am always a little nervous to try something that is not yet rated, but this was exactly the recipe I was looking for, so I tried it.  I did modify it very slightly -- I used tomato juice with fresh tomatoes, and used 2 cans chili beans and 1 can butter beans in place of kidney and pinto beans -- but it was still pretty darn good.  My family loved it and I was glad it was easy.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is absolutely delicious.  I don't put in the jalapeno pepper because it would be too spicy for my family, but I do sneak in some Tabasco and also chop up a bunch of medium hot banana peppers.  Easy and awesome!!

This is a simple yet delicious and hearty recipe. You can use more or less beans, add yellow hominy, change the turkey to ground beef and you will still get the same yummy results. My husband and children really like this meal! Thank you for sharing!

The only difference is i added a small can of enchilada sauce and sprinkled a couple of tablespoons of corn meal, and stirred it, to thicken it and also to give it a added corn taste...comes out real good and hearty, great for a winter night....

This is a good base recipe for turkey chili. I used part garden tomato sauce, and used half kidney and half pinto beans. I took one reviewer hint and added a can of tomato soup.

This was very good.  I tripled the beans, added stew tomatoes, diced tomatoes and a cup of V8.  I also added 3 teaspoons of diced green chilies.  Used the emulation to thicken but only a little.  Also, simmered for a few hours to blend flavors.  Dont be afraid to add extra chili powder and cumin.  As it simmers keep tasting.

SOO good!  I used 93 percent ground turkey to keep down the fat & calories.  I took others' advice & added chicken broth at the end so it wasn't so thick.  I like it hot, so I added some cayenne papper.  Topped with Weight Watchers shredded cheese and the cilantro really made it a meal.  It has so many great veggies in it.  I used 1 red pepper, 1 orange one and the zucchini.  I know it will be even better when it sits overnight!!  Thanks!

I love making this chilli. I don't use any other recipe EVER! My husband loves it, my 2 year loves it, my entire family when they come to visit love it! I use a little less than 2 lbs turkey to cut back on the fat and use whatever beans I have on hand. I throw in some fresh mushrooms and leave out the jalepenos because it would be too spicy for my toddler. So I just add some extra bell pepper. I finely chop the onion and make sure they're translucent before adding the rest of the ingredients. I never use a dutch over because I don't own one and it comes out just fine in a large pot. I use 1 28oz can of tomato sauce and a 14oz can of diced tomatoes and it gives it just the right consistency i'm looking for. PERFECT! It's so easy to alter to your liking. Add or take away whatever you like or dislike. But the seasoning is spot on!

Very nice...made a lot, and had good flavor.  I put in more seasoning, but it was a good chili, and not overly hot.
