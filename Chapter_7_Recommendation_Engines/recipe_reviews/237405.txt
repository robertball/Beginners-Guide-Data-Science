This was a great quick casserole option.  Doubled the recipe, which fit in a 9x13  casserole dish.  I used frozen, already shredded  hashbrowns (defrosted).  One bag was perfect for  a doubled recipe.

Wowzers!! This was surprisingly great!!!  I added 6 slices of bacon in and cooked it with the sausage. I added onion powder to the potatoes. I didn't have shredded Gouda, only slices, so I laid it over top of the eggs at the end and this was great!  Very yummy and easy!  Great on Christmas morning!!  I chose this recipe because all the wet bread in the other recipes sounds gross to me so I wanted one with potatoes not bread. ????

Delicious!  I added onions when cooking the potatoes. I served this to guests; it was filling and they asked for the recipe. It's not often my husband shows interest in new recipes but he did this one!  I KNOW that means HE LIKED IT!

I used a mild sausage, and added 1 tsp sage, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp black pepper. I used  3 potatoes, as I was concerned about having enough to fill the pan, and I lost some during the rinse/drain step. I would definitely use a 3rd, small potato again for that reason.  Also substituted provel for the gouda. It was creamy and smooth. I would definitely make this again.

Very easy and straightforward recipe.  I used the food processor grater attachment to grate to potatoes.  Then into cold water in the salad spinner.   Rinsed the potatoes and spun them dry.  I cut this recipe in half and the bake time was 20 minutes at 350 in a small 5 x 7" casserole dish.  Half a recipe should have been enough for 3 people but actually served 2 big eaters.  Thanks for a great breakfast!

For a 13x9 casserole dish, I doubled the recipe, except for the sausage, which I left at 1 pound.  Browning the grated potatoes adds a little more flavor to the dish.  Overall, very easy and tasty.

This is a great recipe! Been looking a while for a breakfast casserole recipe that didn't include bread in it. I added chopped onion & minced garlic to my shredded potatoes & used Gouda & sharp cheddar mixed.

I just diced potatoes because when I shred them, I tend to shred my fingers too! 
This was good, but really high in fat and calories. I think I'll do this with half spinach/half-sausage next time, and eggbeaters.

I made this for a family brunch and it got rave reviews from everyone. I was looking for a recipe that didn't have bread in it because I was serving coffee cake and bagels as well. This was easy to make and could easily be jazzed up with peppers, onions, jalape√±os, etc... I followed the recipe for the most part but I used thawed hash browns and turkey sausage. Wonderful and flavorful!

I made it twice with different cheeses and sausages. I learned that it's best not to have too much extra cheese and for some reason, the maple flavored sausage was a nice counterpoint to the cheese. I added gruyere and it was good, just had to cut down the amount  of cheese. Egg  sets up nicely. One time I didn't cook the potatoes long enough so remember to cook it  well. We served it to kids so only the adults used sriracha and it was very tasty.

I am not a fan of hash brown potatoes, so that may be why I wasn't thrilled with this recipe.  Perhaps I'll substitute Crispy Crowns  if I make this one again.  I served it with Crunchy Edamame Toast http://reluctantentertainer.com/crunchy-edamame-toasts/ and it was edible, but not much more.

Fantastic!  Very versatile and easily made with what I had on hand.  I don't keep hash browns around and didn't want to use bread, so that limits breakfast casserole options.  I made it without onions, at my son's request; I'm sure it would've been even better with them.  It was definitely a hit at our church's Easter breakfast.  My children were - Mom!  You've gotta make this for us at home, too.
