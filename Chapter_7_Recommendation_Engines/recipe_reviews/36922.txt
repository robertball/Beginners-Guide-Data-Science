This recipe is definitely a keeper, although (as others said) there is too much pepper.  I actually enjoy that much heat in many recipes, but in this recipe it dominates too much over the more subtle flavors.  I will cut in half at least next time, and maybe a quarter for my toddlers' sake.

A really neat thing about this recipe is that most of the ingredients are dry or easily replaced with dry ingredients, so it is easy to pre-mix on the weekend, store in a Ziploc bag on a shelf, and then throw in a crockpot with 2 quarts of water in the morning before work any day of the week - or even a month later, if you use an oxygen-reducing packet.  I replaced broth with boullion and garlic with garlic powder.  Button mushrooms were the only fresh ingredient we used, and I since found a way to order freeze-dried mushrooms - so next time I will be using entirely dry ingredients and then will "just add water".

Yum! I chopped up a whole onion instead of using flakes.  Before putting everything into the crockpot, I sauteed the onion, 2 minced cloves of garlic, one grated carrot, and one minced jalapeno in some olive oil.  Then I put that into the crockpot.  I didn't have savory, so I just used italian seasoning in lieu of that and the basil.  A keeper!

this is a great, healthy, low-fat recipe...i have made it several times.  HOWEVER, i would recommend that you cut the amount of black pepper in the recipe in half (to 1 tsp) because otherwise, it has a lingering burn and your lips will be on fire by the end of a bowl!!!

This is an amazing soup!  I made it two days before serving it for Christmas dinner (I had two vegans who came to dinner)and my guests were extremely impressed.  My husband who likes hearty beef based soups was surprised at it's taste and called it "satisfying."  Plus, my daughter-in-law who prides herself on her homemade soups stated it was the best soup she ever had.  Need I say more?  Thank you Carol.

Since I am not vegetarian, I used chicken broth but didn't add salt. Walmart didn't have shitake mushrooms ( I live in rual Western Michigan ) so I just doubled the amount called for, using regular mushrooms. This is a staple recipe in my kitchen, I will use it over and over and over...

This had delicious flavor and a wonderful, hearty texture. I used all fresh herbs (but I didn't have savory, so I used thyme and a bit of mint), a whole Vidalia onion instead of onion flakes, and baby bellas instead of button mushrooms. I followed other reviewers' advice and used only 1 tsp pepper, but next time I'll up it to 1.5. My boyfriend, the soup junkie, loved this.

Maybe it's just my crock pot, but I cooked it on high for 4 hours and most of the liquid cooked away.  I added more water, and a splash of white wine.  This is a delicious, hearty, fall/winter recipe.

This recipe was great.  I like others, made some changes: I replaced the onion flakes with 1 chopped white onion and the summer savory with italian seasoning.  I also reduced the pepper to 1.5 tsp.  I added frozen peas, chopped carrots, a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce and one bottle of beer (I used Anchor Steam Christmas Ale because that is what  I had).  The results were delicious and this was very filling and hearty.  I am glad I added a lot of extra liquid -- otherwise it would be way too thick.  I will definitely make it this way again!

This was an excellent recipe. I made it with the following changes: I increased the barley and lentils to 1 C each. I used 1 pound of sliced mushrooms and a chopped onion. The onion and mushrooms were placed in the bottom of a pressure cooker and sauteed for about 5 minutes in olive oil. I decreased the vegetable broth to 1 quart. Finally, I added 1 pound of fresh chopped spinach. After adding all the ingredients into a pressure cooker, I cooked them for about 15 minutes. This came out as a delicious meal that was prepared and cooked in under 30 minutes.

Made this last night before bed and woke up to a delicious-smelling house! How yummy is this?! Filling and hearty, yet low in calories and fat, very nutritious. The 5 stars are for how easy this was to prepare and for a recipe we'll use all year long. Thanks!

This is really good and different from most veggie based, earthy, spicy, and down right good. I had french bread and a henekien with it - excellent.

This is a perfect vegetarian stew! I have made it a couple times now and am happy with it exactly as written. You can also vary it a bit, use different spices, I cut down the broth by half and just add water for the rest as I don't like it too salty. I also never have onion flakes in the house so I just use an onion, all in all this is one of my favorite slow cooker recipes!

I made this because I had friends coming over after work and would have no time to prepare something.  Plus, one of my friends is a vegetarian making the "what do I make??" decision even harder.  

I really liked this!  I actually really dislike button mushrooms, so I upped the quantity of shiitake mushrooms and also added a mix of portobello and oyster mushrooms along with the shiitake.  I didn't have savory, so I used thyme.  And I used a diced onion instead of onion flakes.  I added a can of spinach (I felt like Popeye - I didn't even know they actually had cans of spinach!) which was good for colour and flavour as well.

The recipe makes a lot, and I've been happily eating leftovers for several days now.  I don't usually eat vegetarian food but who knew it could be so good?  ;)  Thanks for the recipe!

Shittake too expensive so more of the button, also used fresh garlic and onion, no savory so used Italian seasoning in it's place as per the suggestions of previous reviewers along with the basil.  Chicken broth instead of veg broth and some baby carrots, yummy!!  And yes, way less fresh ground pepper.

This was delicious. I made it with chicken stock and crimini mushrooms, just a few turns of the pepper grinder, and added a sauteed onion as some others had suggested. My husband and I enjoyed it with some cheese scones. Next time I would try adding some carrots and celery. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as is except I couldn't find dried shitake mushrooms, so I used dried porcini.  It was delicious.  I agree that the pepper is a little overwhelming but we like spicy, so still enjoyed it.  I would cut the pepper in half next time.  Definitely a do-over!

Absolutely delicious!  And very forgiving; I have made it with wheat berries instead of barley, and without shiitake mushrooms; it still turns out absolutely delicious. Even my 2 year old loves it!

My vegetarian husband is giving this 4 stars. I would give it three. I thought it was bland. I didn't have summer savory but otherwise the only other thing I changed was 1 whole fresh onion instead of the flakes. Good texture, just not much flavor. If the kids weren't eating it, I would have added some heat.

I'm trying to do more veggie dishes this year (limit our environmental impact of all the meat production) and have to say that this is nice and hearty so you don't miss the meat!  Even my carnivore husband declared that it was really good.  Helps that we both love mushrooms :)

This was delicious just as it was written! The black pepper gave it a kick. It was perfect for my family - I might cut back on the pepper if I were bringing the dish to a get together with folks who prefer a milder taste.

I followed the recipe except for halving the pepper per other reviews.  I was very disappointed.  It was extremely brothy, more of a soup than a stew.  It was also surprisingly bland.  Could taste the pepper, but nothing else.  I wound up dumping a bunch of seasoned salt in it to perk it up, but even so, it is still pretty boring.

E-A-S-Y and flexible.  I've made this without the driec shiitake (used fresh) and fresh onion instead of dried flakes and it's come out great.

My Wife and I really enjoyed this after only minor customization, and it is SO easy to make!  It has really nice flavors and my wife was very pleasantly surprised to see me attempt something that was vegetarian.  I didn't even find myself wishing there was meat in it!  Although I didn't enjoy the leftovers so much (slightly gummy texture), the first feed with some garlic bread went down famously!  I will definitely be making this again.  Here are some minor adjustments that we made: Used 1 portabella mushroom cap instead of the shitake (availability issue), 1 whole white onion in place of dried flakes, Upped the amount of garlic to 4 cloves (will increase this even more next time as we are garlic lovers), and reduced the amount of black pepper to 1 teaspoon (although next time I will use even less as we still found that much black pepper to be a bit overpowering).  Only had to cook on high for 4 hours and it was ready!

I followed the recipe exactly and honestly, I don't think it had much flavor at all. I will not be making this again.  I was really disappointed with this recipe.

I like barley, mushrooms, and lentils, but I did not like this stew.  I thought the herbs and mushrooms did not blend well, and it ended up smelling powerful.

Very hearty and filling. :) Good flavor. I used 1/2 the amount of black pepper, and might even cut it down a bit more. The summer savory I used ended up leaving bits of woody stems behind. I also used a fresh onion and couldn't find the dried shitake, so I used all fresh mushrooms (a combination of white button and portabellas). Definitely a keeper.

I opted to make this recipe on the stove. Used dried chanterelles a co-worker gave to me, along with fresh button mushrooms and baby portabellas. Chicken broth and my favorite seasonings rather than the savory gave it a familiar flavor profile that we enjoy. Next time, if we have wine on hand, I'll add a 1/4 cup to deepen the flavors. Loved the Unami  flavor that comes from the rich mushroom broth. Also used fresh carrots, celery, and onion as my base. This soup got better with each day. I did not use the amount of pepper suggested; instead, eyeballed it by just shaking our course ground pepper into the pot. Even on the stovetop, this was a quick recipe.

This was fairly decent. The only changes I made was to chop up an onion and saute it with some garlic in place of the onion flakes. I also followed the suggestions and lowered the pepper. It wasn't very flavorful but it was filling.

tastes great, very easy to make, but cooking it on High cooked out most of my broth, so I had to add some water.  I didn't even cook it for 4 hours on high, so be mindful of that.

This stew is just as amazing as everyone has said in the comments! A couple things I did/will do differently:
1. I don't have a slow cooker, so I used a pot.  On the lowest heat, the soup took about 2 hours to cook.
2. I found there to be too much liquid left at the end - it turned out more like a thick soup than a stew.  Next time, I will cut the liquid back to about 1.5 gallons. . .
Finally, I punched this recipe into a nutrition calculator.  If anyone is interested, below is the approximate nutritional info for each serving (total of 8)

Calories: 172
Carbs: 33 g
Fat: 0
Protein: 11 g
Sodium: 625 mg (that's with the tsp of salt I added, and a relatively generic broth)
Not too shabby at all!

Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made this on the stove top. It turned out amazingly "buttery" without any butter, which we are still perplexed about.

It did seem a little bit bland so I added 2 teaspoons of DILL to the left-overs. I am hoping that this will end up tasting more like a vegan Hungarian-mushroom soup. 

Great recipe overall.

I followed this recipe but used a real onion and reduced the pepper by one-third. It was really filling and good! If I make it again, I'll definitely pick up some bread (or bake some if I'm really ambitious) to go with it.

The mushroom, lentils and barley really work great together! I skimped on the shiitake to save money, and added carrots and onions instead for sweetness. I also used ginger instead as the main spice, which turned out really nice. I made this on stovetop (grains cooked first, then veggies added), and it only took about 40 min for everything to be fully cooked.

Absolutely delicious.

I made this exactly as directed the first time and it turned out great.  Now I'm having fun playing with it, like adding a cup of diced carrots or different kinds of mushrooms.  It's a fantastic weeknight meal.  Put everything in the crock pot the night before and keep it in the fridge until you switch it on the next morning.  What could be better?  Thanks so much!

Loved this! It's very hearty and delicious. I made the mistake of adding too much barley so it got too thick but other than that, I would definitely make again!

Excellent! I'm not vegetarian but really enjoyed this recipe. Per other reviewer's suggestions, I only used about 3/4 t. of black pepper and that was perfect. I also added a bit of sherry for flavor. Will definitely made this again!

This was a hearty meal with garlic bread on the side and it certaily stuck to our ribs however the flavor was missing and I used beef broth instead of vegetable and an extra shot of spices after reading reviews. Not bad but not a keeper for us.

I'm not a fan of dried mushrooms, so I used 2 8-oz containers of button mushrooms.  I don't like dried onions either, so I used a whole chopped up fresh onion.  I couldn't find summer savory so I used Italian seasoning.  I wouldn't even dream of using that much pepper in a recipe and was quite happy with 1/4 tsp.  I also added 1 tsp of salt.  This smelled incredible while it was cooking and I couldn't wait to eat it.  I was so disappointed... it was really bland.  I tried making it a second time since I had leftover barley and lentils, but added 3 stalks of celery and increased the garlic... still bland.

I have several favorite recipes from AllRecipes but have never written a review before. I LOVE this soup. I used chicken broth instead of veggie. I also sauteed an onion and a couple of cloves of garlic as another review suggested. I didn't have time to make this in the crock pot so did it on the stove top. It was ready in about an hour and fifteen minutes. I had a cup or so of baby spinach I needed to use so I chopped that and added it at the end. Also used a Tuscan spice blend instead of the savory since I didn't have savory. My meat eating husband loved this soup too. The only change I would make next time is to reduce the amount of barley and increase the lentils. I felt they were ouatnumbered! I will definitely make this again. Almost forgot. I decreased the pepper to 3/4 tsp.

Awesome soup, had such amazing flavor. I followed the recipe to a T except I didn't use any shitaki,  used a box of baby portobello mushrooms.  Cooked on high for 4 hours was perfect. A really good hearty & filling soup.

Delicious. What a huge hit this soup was in my house. I didn't have Savory, so subbed Herbs de Provence and dried Parsley. I have tried hundreds of recipes from this website, and this one ranks in the top 10 easily!

This is a really nice, hearty and healthy recipe. I reduced the pepper to 1 tsp like many other people recommended however it was still pretty bold (I'm glad I read the review, I don't know how anyone could use 2 tsp and enjoy it).  I think if I make it again I'll reduce it to 1/2 a tsp of pepper.  I also think it could use a vegetable to freshen it up a little, maybe some frozen corn would do the trick.  When I served it I topped it off with a little grated parmesan and it was fabulous.  This is perfect for broke students like myself considering all of the ingredients are cheap and don't expire too quickly!

This is a fantastic starting point for a recipe!!  I've been making this stew for a couple of years now and I absolutely adore it; it's the perfect vegan comfort food (if you use vegan broth.)  I used fresh brown mushrooms, a fresh onion, and thyme instead of the savory and basil...and of course, freshly ground black pepper because it's my favorite (and yes, like so many of the reviews have mentioned, I use about 1/4-1/2 the pepper)...and yum.  It just gets better with time, too!  I highly recommend this soup recipe.

I give this recipe 5 stars for easy of preparation.  It literally took five minutes to put together.  My husband and I both agreed that this soup deserves a 3 1/2 stars for flavor.  It was better than ok, but not amazing.  My semi-picky 2 year old also liked the soup.

As is, soup is delicious and makes great leftovers. Next time I make this I am going to completely cut out the button mushrooms and use either solely shiitake mushrooms or a combo of shiitake and oyster mushrooms.

We really enjoyed the recipe. I did tweak it a bit: I used ~2 cups of sliced fresh shitake mushrooms, and 4 medium portabello mushrooms. I also fried 1/2 a medium yellow onion with 1 Tbsp of minced garlic in lieu of using the onion flakes. Maybe a bit strong on the garlic but that's OK with us. I'll be making it again. Thanks.

This was great but a little on the salty side for me.  I used poultry seasoning instead of sage and added carrots, jalapeno, fresh onion, and garlic and sauteed them in some olive oil before adding to the crockpot.   My dried shiitake mushrooms were still a bit tough but added great flavor.  Next time I might just add another cup of button mushrooms to save some money.  Overall it's a great recipe and I'll definitely make again.

I sauteed the mushrooms and onion separately in garlic and olive oil before adding to pan. Instead of savory (I didn't have it) i substituted a pinch of thyme, sage, oregano. Also used homemade chicken broth instead of vegetable. Delicious !!!

Had for dinner tonight - delish!  I did substitute all fresh mushrooms (a variety) and based on another reviewer, I subbed italian seasoning in for summer savory.  Quite good - I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Very Good! The word is "Earthy". I used about a small, chopped onion instead of the flakes. I didn't have savory so used thyme and oregano (those aren't really a substitute but I thought they would taste good in this). I also added chopped kale, red bell peppers, tomatoes and serrano hot peppers at the end. My only complaint is that I didn't like the texture. It was kind of sticky and gummy. Next time I will try making this on the stove top instead of crock pot. There will be a next time because I LOVED the flavor.

I really liked this but my family didn't.  I think the problem was that I made it the day before we ate it and it got really thick overnight.  Also I think cooking it on high for 4 hours would have been enough.  I will make it again but not the day before.

I give this one five stars for both being healthy and for taste.  I added a carrot to the mix as well. This had become my new favorite soup.

This has many good reviews, so maybe this recipe is just not to my taste...  I made a whole pot, had a few bites, and decided that this was just not for me.  I love muchrooms, but something about this is just too mushroom-y and earthy.  And I agree with other reviewers - way too much pepper!  I would recommend cutting the black pepper in half.  Most of the broth boiled off or was absorbed by the barley and lentils, leaving a very thick, hearty stew.  But this is not for me - I won't be making this again.

Lovely on a cold winter's night. Wonderful aroma. I was a bit too timid with the pepper after reading the other reviews; I would recommend at least a teaspoon. I enjoyed the rich texture and earthy taste, but I prefer a more complex flavor, so I plan to tweak the recipe a bit. I suspect a splash of sherry would do nicely.

Good flavors. I am a big fan of black pepper however, and even having reduced the amount the recipe called for, my family and I found it to be a overpowering. Hubby did not finish his.

This was really excellent, and my boyfriend's favorite recipe yet. He says it's hard to believe that it has no meat in it, and compares it to a good chili. We used parsley for savory, and quite a bit of pepper.

We loved it! My husband is not a vegetarian, but thought it was great.  We would probably use a bit less savory for our own tastes next time though.

As others have noted, 2 tsp of black pepper is probably too much for most people.  I made it first with 1.5, and it still definitely had a kick.  In fact, we ate it topped with plain yogurt to take the spicy edge off, and it was a really good combo.  The second time I just used 1 tsp of  pepper, and it seemed to be missing something for us...So, maybe 1.25 the 3rd time?  Again, really delicious!

Made this for a potluck at church knowing there would be basically nothing else I could eat as a vegan. Loved this stew, next time though I will cut down on the black pepper as I'm not a fan of it anyways and the taste of the pepper was very noticeable. My husband, who LOVES black pepper thought it was perfect, but I told him next time I make it he can add more at the table to his  ;) lol

I substituted the barley for couscous which was very good but the cook time was very different! High for two hours was almost too much. Also added fresh onion and garlic and it was great. Looking forward to making this again

Used Chicken broth,  1-1/2 C barley & lentils, fresh onion, garlic, carrots & celery (sautéed in butter first).  Substituted thyme and Italian seasoning for savory.  Let cook on low overnight  & served next day with home made corn muffins.  Spouse thought it was wonderful and I had enough left over for another meal and also froze some for later.

This is an excellent cold weather or long day meal.  So easy to assemble in the morning and ready when you come home.  I use more mushrooms than is called for, and I replace the buttons with a variety of japanese mushrooms.  I can't keep enough in stock in hte house during winter.

Hearty and tasty, it was super easy to make! I did not use a slow cooker or shitake mushrooms just a whole package of sliced white mushrooms. Also I added 2 stalks of celery chopped, some diced onion, half the amount of pepper and 1 cup of fresh spinach. I also did not have summer savory so I used thyme instead! I will definitely make this again.

I have made this twice now and it is been delicious both times. Are used fresh onion instead of onion flakes and the second time I made it I added carrots and celery and cooked it in my pressure cooker for about 15 minutes on high. I couldn't find a summer savory but as many of the other viewers said Italian seasoning works just as well. This is definitely a keeper and a rich and hearty stew. You won't even miss the meat!

Sauted  in canola garlic first then added onions and a spicy pepper. Also made my own vegetable broth: 2 quarts+1 cup water added 1 tbsp peppercorn, 1 yellow onion cut into 1/4 pieces, a large pinch of thyme, 2 tbsp crushed garlic boiled everything, simmered for approx  10 minutes, cooled slightly and ran thru a sieve into the crockpot.Worked out cheaper  and healthier than  store brought.Served with garlic bread. Everyone loved it! Will make over abd over again.

This smelled so great while it was cooking, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The shiitake mushrooms had a an unappealing texture and after one day, the leftovers were a thick and unappetizing. I'm sorry. I feel terrible, but this is my first one-star review.

This recipe was easy enough to make, and smelled good. When I tasted it I found it rather bland so I added Worcestershire sauce and paprika. I also had to add a good bit more broth as it all absorbed. I did the 10 hour low heat setting on my crock pot, as that seemed like a good idea at the time. It was fine hot, very hearty and filling though still a little bland. I like to use my crockpot on weekends to make dinner on Sunday and eat the leftovers for lunch the rest of the week. Unfortunately I didn't realize that this became unappetizing gelatinous once it cooled down. I tried eating it but the texture was gluey. So to summarize it was good, if bland while hot but make sure you are going to eat it all that night as it doesn't store well.

Cut back on pepper like others.  Didn't have time for slow cooker so I simmered on stove for a while.  Wonderful flavor, and healthy.  Will make again.  Thank you for the recipe!

I pick a lot of wild mushrooms and I constantly look for recipes to use them. I just picked 4 pounds of oyster mushrooms and this looked tasty. I didn't have lentils so I used black beans and fresh onion instead of dried flakes. Six hours in the crock pot at medium heat and it was perfect. Everyone loved it. Next time I will use ham broth instead of veggie broth. Use whatever grains and legumes you have. It will still be good.

I needed a lentil recipe that I could make in the slow cooker, so I picked this one. It was very easy to make. I used fresh shiitake because that's what I could find. I added about 2 cups of water because I thought there's no way this will be enough liquid. I'm really glad I did! Next time, I will just use more vegetable broth. I've never heard of summer savory spice, so I just used Italian seasoning. Even though we love spicy food, we used less pepper as everyone else suggested. That was a good call, too. I still feel like the stew is missing something, but I'm not sure what. I can't say I love it and I can't wait to make it again, but it's a good staple to have.

I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it many times and shared the recipe with my Mom. I made it for a party and everyone like it. The only difficulty is finding the right kind of summer savory. At first I used ground summer savory because that's all I could find, but it is much better with the leaves (not the grounds). The savory really makes the dish; I would not recommend substituting.

Did my own combo of spices and as many have said, cut down the pepper to 1t. Used real onion and sautéed it with the garlic first. Did not have barley so tried quinoa and while it was still delicious, it was not the texture this barley stew was meant to be. I would have better off using brown rice. I did find it interesting that the quinoa actually sprouted in the stew.

The second batch I made I threw in a couple handfuls of frozen stir fry vegetables that needed used up in the stew for the last hour and that came out great as well. Veggies still had some crunch.  

Great meaty-like stew that should satisfy any hungry person.

I followed reviewer's advise to cut down on pepper, I used one jar of regular mushrooms (all I had), sauteed  onion, celery and carrot slices, and 'Not Chikn' vegetarian bullion cubes. It only needed just over 3 hours in my crockpot on high. Outstanding! eating every day!

After eainting one bowl I threw it out.  It absorbed most of the liquid and I had to add more during cooking, other than that I followed recipe exactly.  It was not my taste at all.

This is the first crock pot recipe I've ever made that actually came out well!  We're not big fans of lentils, but it's still delicious.  (I made a half batch, and added a cup of cream after I turned the heat off to sort of "lighten" the flavour.)

amazingly delicious - even the kids loved it. I subbed 1/2tsp of Bell's stuffing seasoning for the savory, omitted the bay leaves completely, and added only about 6 grinds of my pepper shaker - much less than called for in the recipe. I added about 1 tsp of salt and cooked on high for 4 hours, then left the cover askew for another hour to cook off some of the liquid. (I had only fresh shiitake mushrooms and forgot to reduce the liquid before adding it!) Will definitely make again!

Made this tonight and it was delicious, hearty and filling. 
Didn't have savory so added 1 tsp each of thyme and rosemary. Also, didn't have shiitake mushrooms so used all button mushrooms. Cooked in 3.5 hrs on high. Used 1/2 amount of pepper and didn't add salt (tasted fine without it). I'm looking to add simple, healthy staple meals to my routine and this will be one of them.

I loved it -- very hearty, rich, and tasty. I modified it slightly by using Trader Joe's very low-sodium chicken broth (instead of vegetable broth), and using Mrs. Dash instead of just regular salt/pepper when cooking. I still had to salt, very slightly, after the first bite. So if you're using a lower-sodium broth and/or a salt-free substitute, you may want to increase the other herbs/spices to provide a little more flavor. But awesome!!! I ended up getting about 10 servings (1 c each), and made whole wheat rolls to serve with it. My family (a meat-n-potatoes group for sure) enjoyed it -- not quite as much as I did, but they liked it nonetheless.

Delicious! 
I did make some slight changes.  Fresh Onions, and fresh  button, oyster and shiitake mushrooms.  Reduced amount of pepper per other reviews.  I cooked on low for 10 hours which seemed to long.  I will definitely be making this again.

My changes: about double the broth, adding two extra cups chopped mushrooms during last 5-10 minutes, 2 tbs red wine, 1 regular onion instead of flakes, 3 cloves minced garlic. With these minor changes the recipes was pretty good! :)

My husband, a total mushroom fanatic, loved it. I like mushrooms too - not nearly as much as he does  though - but thought the dried mushrooms made overwhelmed the other flavors. Next time I won't use so many, because otherwise it was tasty, filling, healthy, inexpensive and easy to make.

Awesome. Amazingly hearty and tasty: I made this for dinner and 3 meat-loving, six foot tall men were pleased and satisfied. Amazingly easy and healthy: I've been preparing the dry version of this recipe for all my friends with newborns. They've really appreciated the energy boost this healthy meal.

I thought this recipe had too much pepper. I even halved it and still found it too peppery for my taste. Otherwise it was good. I did use only baby bella mushrooms. This is a very thick stew and I think I will add a little extra broth next time  (along with less pepper).

I thought this was great!  I did what some of the other reviewers did.  I had to make substitutions for the ingredients I didn't have.  I used 1/2 onion, other types of mushrooms, and added rosemary, thyme, and sage.  I also added carrots and at the end added spinach as did some other of the reviewers.  Really happy how it turned out!  Thank you!!

Meh. Not what I was expecting. Found it rather lacking in flavor, to be honest. Was definitely edible and sriracha added to it made it much better, but I wouldn't make it again.

The easiest slow cooker recipe every made (twice).  I didn't have summer savory, used oregano & thyme.  The second time I made this stew I used frozen cropped spinach, added it within the last 2 hours of cooking time.  4 hours on high will cook barley perfectly.  Perfect for my vegan mom.

Very good! Filling and "meaty" without any meat. I made a couple modifications: as others have done, I sautéed a minced onion (along with the garlic) instead of using dried onion; I happened to have a good amount of fresh shiitakes from our CSA, so I used those instead of white mushrooms; I used 1 qt chicken broth and 1 qt veggie because that's what I had on hand; we grow summer savory so I used two good-sized fresh sprigs. I also used freshly-ground pepper and just eyeballed the amount. I added about a teaspoon of salt before cooking, but ended up needing to add a little more when serving. That's a matter of preference, though. It was a satisfying, hearty meal with a chunk of whole-grain bread, but this is a very "brown" dish so ideally I'd have a salad or some greens on the side to balance it out.

Great recipe w/ a little help...add some chopped carrot, celery and fresh onion. It will probably need a little more broth added to it, as it was slightly too thick. I served with a nice whole grain bread.

Surprisingly good!  I only added 1/2 tsp pepper; 2 tsp sounded like way too much!  We had warm dinner rolls to go with it.  Perfect!

I made this recipe last week and my family enjoyed it.  I presoaked the lentils for a couple of hours.  I also added two thinly sliced carrots.  The next time I might use dried porcinis instead of shitakes since they stayed a bit rubbery even after hours of cooking.  Definitely use the savory since it makes the dish.  Also, I needed the longer cooking time even with presoaking the lentils and using hot broth. I have small children so I didn't use that much pepper.

This is excellent! I made just a few minor alterations--I used all button mushrooms, as I had no shiitakes on hand. I also used one whole chopped onion instead of dried onion flakes, and cut the pepper in half. Next time I will add a little more broth, as the stew turned out really thick due to most of the liquid being absorbed.  I will definitely make this again! Very hearty and very healthy.

I made this as a side dish instead of stew.  I cut down on the broth.  I used portabello and button mushrooms.  Sauted some sweet potato cubes with onion, garlic, mushrooms, and spices and added to cooked barley and lentils just before serving.  Also threw in some dried goji berries with simmering barley/lentils.  It was a hit!

I added ground beef to this just for kicks and I also added a little too much garlic. Even so, it was rich and  fantastic. A great hearty fall stew!

surprisingly easy and good. Only had beef broth on hand and served it as side dish with steak.  Maybe could use a little more liquid but was good as a side.

This is an ecellent stew!  I put everything together and went to class and came home to the comforting taste and texture.  I had to add some water to it, but other than that, I found it wonderful.

I really want to like lentil soups, but I have yet to find one I like.  As lentil soups go, this wasn't too bad (unlike some I've tried), but I wouldn't make it again.  Maybe I should just give up on lentil soup.

Very easy to put together and tastes delicious. I didn't have the shiitake mushrooms but it was still great. If you cant find summer savory like the first time I did this, try using thyme and sage. I also added a bit of oregano. The second time I made it, I did have the savory and I liked it the same. This is going to become a winter staple for me!

This is a great recipe for a simple lentil soup. The only think I would change next time is using less vegetable stock than called for. The lentils and barley have such a delicate flavor that I felt was washed away by the bold vegetable stock flavors.

Hubby and Son loved it!  I thought it was a little bland, considering all the  stuff in it.  I used button, baby bella, and fresh shiitake (couldn't find dried) mushrooms.  I will make it again, with some tweaks. It was easy, and they loved it.  That makes it a keeper!

This was WONDERFUL, aside from (as others have mentioned) it was far too much pepper for my family. I loved it even with the pepper, but I love spicy stuff in general. I will definitely make it again, with far less pepper. Super easy, way healthy, and vegan!

I made this for Thanksgiving. I couldn't find dried mushrooms so I just used fresh. I couldn't find savory so I used rosemary. As suggested by other reviews, I added less pepper. The recipe is very easy. My family is not big on trying new things but those that did liked this. I loved it & will make it again.

I found this to be utterly tasteless.  I was glad to find a hearty and filling vegetarian soup, but wouldn't make it again.  I added root vegetables and more spices and different spices and herbs, along with some beans and split peas and more salt, but I was very disappointed with the outcome.

I give this 5 stars for simplicity and heartiness. My vegan son and I really liked it. I find it challenging to find a variety of recipes that are also quick to prepare. I thought it was missing something- but I didn't have the dried mushrooms, dried onions, or savory (never heard of it) so I'm sure those would have rounded it out. I added a dash of Worcestershire, lemon juice, and a little Parmesan to mine, but I'm not certain those made a big difference. Next time I'll try to get all the ingredients; either way will make again.

I cut the pepper down to 1 tsp per the other reviews, but we found this tasty, surprisingly "meaty", healthy, and easy. Great for a busy winter dinner.

Made for vegan daughter who really liked.  Only change was I used Italian seasoning for summer savory (I have no idea what that is).  Will make again for sure even the meat eaters liked as a side dish.

Good flavor for a vegetarian dish.  I looked at the recipe before I began and could tell that 2 t. pepper would be too much, so I cut back to about 1/4 t. and it came out perfectly seasoned.

I will definitely make this again. The summer savory wasn't in my cabinet, nor were the dried shitake mushrooms but the recipe was fine without. The black pepper is a nice and simple way to spice this up and I love the many bay leaves. I added some smoked paprika and doubled the recipe to freeze half of it.  Did not double the pepper, as my husband doesn't like his food spicy.

Even with adding carrots, celery, and onion at the start, it was still kind of bland.  Sprinkled parm on at the end to help the taste and texture.  I can't imagine how bland it would be without these additions.

This was soooo good! I added 2 blocks of tempeh to give it more protein and make it a more complete meal. The tempeh went really well with this, it just crumbled and fell apart in the stew. This is now one of my easiest healthiest weekday meals. Definitely a regular. Thanks for posting!

Because we are meat eaters, I used beef broth instead of vegetable and added 1 1/2 pounds of stew beef which I brown in oil prior to adding to the slow cooker.  I did reduce the black pepper to 1 tsp instead of 2, and I added salt.  This is a delicious stew which we will eat twice a day until it is finally gone (it is just my husband and me).  I have made it twice so far this winter, and my husband has already asked when I will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe and the reviews!

Very good! I added matchstick carrots, used fresh onion and Italian seasoning. I don't know what summer savory is. Also used  2 boxes of chicken broth in lieu of vegetable broth. Delish!

This would get 5 stars except for, as others pointed out, way too much pepper.  I just put a small sprinkle on top and that is plenty. Also I don't add salt (only at the end if needed), may be needed if you use homemade sodium-free broth, but I use store bought and even with very low sodium broth (6% per cup), it is plenty salty for my taste.  Also I prefer the taste of red lentils.  With my 6 qt. crock pot I can fit more veggies so I add whatever I have around (carrots, celery, peppers, etc.) can fill it almost to the top although it does expand very slightly as the lentils/barley cook.  This is the perfect recipe for a winter day when sick since it's so so easy to make, and can use up extra veggies lying around.

Very good soup! I substituted homemade mushroom stock in place of the vegetable broth, portabella mushrooms because those are the only kind my husband will eat, and a chopped fresh onion for the flakes. I used 1/2 the pepper based on other reviews and it was just right. Even better the next day!

Threw some of this in the slow cooker over night and couldn't resist but to have some for breakfast, really good.  It seems like my lentils pretty much broke down but it added to the thickness and texture of the stew.  Instead of using vegetable broth I used chicken stock that I had on hand.

I cut the pepper as the other reviewers suggested. I will add more salt next time as I just did about 1 tsp this time around. I also browned some beef and let it slow cook in the stew to increase the protein.

I am amazed by this soup! I used all white button mushrooms, and about a half an onion. Put it on low for 12 hours and really didn't expect much but was really amazed with how tasty this is! I thought it might be bland but it is far from it. Oh and I took most reviewers advice and used half as much pepper. This will be a staple for me now!

This is a delicious stew! I made it on the stove though because I do not have a slow cooker. I also used "Better than Bullion no chicken base" and added a little mimic cream.

This recipe was a huge success for the family that I prepare food for!  They couldn't find dried shiitake mushrooms so we substituted dried porcini.  I had half of an onion already chopped, so used that instead of the dried flakes and as per other recommendations, used only 1 teaspoon of black pepper.  This was a delicious vegan meal that I will make again!

I liked this recipe! It makes a lot, so for just two it was a bit much, but luckily it freezes well. Definitely cut the pepper! Make sure to use a fresh onion, as well. You can sautee the onions and mushrooms beforehand to get some more flavor out of them. I also added extra mushrooms, because I love them so much!   Very hearty, healthy, and rich. Will for sure be making this again.

LOVED this recipe.  Super easy and very tasty.  I used mushroom broth instead of plain vegetable broth and fresh shiitakes (3) instead of dried because the store I went to didn't have dried. I also added precooked barley that I had in the freezer instead of uncooked.  This is a brilliant recipe and will be on our table often this fall and winter.

I was so sad when I got home and ran to my slow cooker to try this.  There so so much pepper I couldn't taste anything else.  So I added some veggies and a couple cans of diced tomatoes in hopes of cutting some of the pepper, but it didn't work.  No one in my family liked it.  I was so dissapointed.

Have made this twice now.  The first time was good, but missing a little something.  I subbed beef broth for veggie broth on the second time around and used Italian Seasoning instead of summer savory and liked it better than my first outing with the recipe.  I've also found that it tastes MUCH better on the second day.

Too much pepper! I cut the pepper to only one teaspoon and the recipe called for two teaspoons. You would have to really like spicy for that. If I make it again I will probably only put 1/4 of a teaspoon of pepper.

Darn.  I read some of the reviews that said there was too much pepper, but it took a while between reading the reviews and my actually getting around to making the soup.  By then I'd forgotten.  The other reviews were definitely right.  It'll be better the next time (and I'll change my review then).  However, I was happy to find that my soup was finished in 6 hours instead of the 10-12 in the recipe.

Tried this soup yesterday, good earthy taste. Too much pepper for my liking and I actually like a lot of pepper. Even with the suggested reduction to 1 tsp, it was still too much. Maybe next time I'll reduce it to 1/2 tsp. It was slightly bland, and I was eating it I was wondering what I could add to it to give it more flavor. I didn't have summer savory and went with the italian seasoning as advised by a few others. I give it 4 stars because it's a good BASE soup and very simple to make. Definitely a keeper with a few additions. I enjoy recipes that I can tweak

Would definitely make this again.  I too used just 1 tsp of black pepper and used a real onion instead of flakes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  12 hours on low and everything was cooked perfectly.  House smelled great.  Had to look a little for the savory, but I found it and it was something new that I can enjoy.

5 stars for ease of preparation and simple ingredients.  I love that this can be made using only one fresh ingredient.  I also like that this can be used as a base recipe.  I didn't have savory, so I doubled the basil.  Added some white wine and rosemary and left out the bay leaves.  That said, it was a little bland, but I think more seasoning and some Parmesan on top could make a big difference.  I imagine I'll make it again with a few tweaks.

Very hearty. You won't miss the meat at all. I also cut way back on the pepper, adding just a couple of grinds before cooking and a little more when serving. I also needed to add more water at the end. It gets very sticky and thick- not very appetizing as a leftover.

DELICIOUS!!! Hearty and filling. My daughter who doesn't like mushrooms loved it (until I told her it had mushrooms).     I made this exactly as directed in the recipe except for 1 tsp. black pepper and I didn't have dried shiitake mushrooms, so I used 4 oz. fresh shiitake mushrooms instead.

I've made this two times, once with and once without beef.  Both times it was very good even though it doesn't look very appealing!  This is a very simple stew that you can throw in the crock pot and walk away from until it is ready to eat.  I use Italian Seasoning in place of summer savory.

This was really good.  I was skeptical at first because it didn't look to appetizing.  I didn't have any shitake mushrooms so I used a good sized portabella that I sliced up in addition to the slice button mushrooms.  I also had no summer savory - recipe was still tasty without it!  I wasn't sure which type of lentils to use since it wasn't specified - I ended up going with red lentils so that the stew would be kind of creamy once they cooked down.

Very easy to put together and it came out tasty. I used all baby portabella mushrooms and next time I will cut the black pepper in half. It was a tad hot for my liking but it was still very good. I cooked it on low for 11 hours. This is a keeper for my slow cooker recipes.

Fantastic.  No savoury so used sage and rosemary.  Added some celery towards the end for a bit of crunch. have to be very careful with salt content of stock so as not to over season

I used fresh onions and garlic, and I didn't have savory, and I cut back a bit on the pepper, as suggested. This soup had lots of good flavors, but it was missing something. I think some fresh rosemary may have done the trick. My husband said "It needs beef." Hmmm...I don't know if that's the answer. I think more variety of vegetables would have been good. Maybe some root vegetables, etc.

Even 1 tsp pepper is far too much. I will make it again because I like the textures, and I am sure that the onion, garlic, and veg broth will be enough flavor. Next time I will use 1/2 or 1/4 tsp ground pepper.

Made this due to need for lower cholesterol recipes. Only change was to not use so much pepper. Result: Girlfriend found it to be too 'earthy' tasting - my reaction was akin to eating too much baked beans! Don't think we'll be doing it again..

This recipe tastes much better than it looks!  It's not for the faint of heart, the recipe makes a LOT.  Excellent flavor and an excellent way to eat lentils!

This is an excellent and hearty stew that meat lovers will also love! We did it on the stovetop and sauteed all the mushrooms first (in butter, not vege-friendly). Any combination of spices will suit this: thyme, lots of pepper, oregano, cumin, basil, whatever.

This was a very harty and filling soup. It had all my favorites! Cheap and extra easy! Great for busy winter days, just stick everything in and come home to dinner ready to go.

Good meaty texture and body.  Interesting flavor but needs a little zip.  Possibly tomato, vinegar, hot sauce.

This wasnt what I thought it would be. I love mushrooms. I like lentils. But this....was just nasty. Maybe with some tweaking it would be ok. But it tasted "earthy". Maybe it would be better with out the shitakes and if you sauted the button mushrooms first in butter. I wont make this again at list in the current version. Yech!

This was really spicy! I didn't really like it at all.. My hubby and I added some sour cream to try and tone down the heat but it didn't help.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

WE did not like this.  I did everything just so and found the mushroom amount overwhelming.  I didn't give it any less stars just in case mine was unusual.  I would use only one-third of the mushrooms listed, the rest had a nice taste and texture.  Love the barley.

Excellent.   Made it for dinner.  Used poultry seasoning instead of summer savory.  Whole family enjoyed it.  Leftovers were given to a neighbor and my father who also loved it.  Thanks for a gread recipe.

Was very good, but on my own instinct, I did use about 1/2 teaspoon less pepper and tbh I didn't know what summer savory was, so I skipped that  :) With those adjustments, it still was very good.

I made this in the Instant Pot and it turned out very thick.  If I make this again, I'll reduce the black pepper by half and increase the vegetable stock.

After cooking in the Crock-Pot I put in a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and let sit for 20 minutes. It is exactly what the stew needed and was perfect. I'll definitely make this again.

I changed this recipe a bit but the broth was so flavorful
I used chicken stock instead of vegetable
did not use lentils or barley or dried savory and added boneless skinless chicken thighs.  It was awesome!

I wanted to like this. I like all the individual ingredients and the combo together sounded good. But I don't think a slow cooker was the best cooking method for this soup. Even though I used long cooking barley it, along with the lentils, were mush by the time was up.  This was a gelatinous, brown mass. The flavor was bland too. After having it the first night and leftovers one other time I couldn't eat any more and the rest ended up in the trash.

Liked this recipe-great for a vegetarian soup.  Husband thought it was a little bland and that it would have been better had there been some chopped carrots, celery, etc. in it to add some flavor.

I also thought this recipe was too bland.  It is really missing some acid..either lemon juice, vinegar or hot sauce.  It was better when I added acid.

This was very good, although not super flavorful. I added a coupl eof different kinds of mushrooms and ate it with hot sauce!

this was not good, all ingredients should go well together but flavour was not appealing to me. I will not make it again

It smelled good, but was very mushroomy (and I LOVE mushrooms). It was also very thick. We only ate it for one meal and left it in the fridge. I'm not sure what I would suggest to make it better though.

This came out very bland.....all we could taste was the pepper flavor.  We ended up dumping it out, which was frustrating because the dried mushrooms were very expensive.  Definitely needs something else to pump up the flavor.  And the pepper should be cut in half!

Pretty good hearty winter stew. My only complaint is that it was a little bland. Maybe adding some wine or lemon or something would spice it up. I served it topped with parmesan, which helped.

Bland. Maybe it will taste better in a couple days. This dish reminded me on why I like meat.

I wasn't able to find "summer savory" and don't know what is in it, so my dish came out a little on the bland side with exception of the black pepper.  I think I will use less black pepper next time, as it's such a sharp taste... and I'll try to find some summer savory!

This was delicious.  I reduced the pepper to 1 1/2 teaspoons and found that it was still too peppery, so next time I'll try just 1 teaspoon.

After 12 hours in the crockpot, the barley had exploded into mush and the lentils were still a little hard.  The flavor was ok, but could still use a little punch.  I did cut down on the pepper, based on previous reviews.

I found this a bit on the bland side, but otherwise it was good.  Also very nutritious, it was perfect for me after a workout, when I have trouble eating heavier foods.
