I made a vegan version of this by replacing the cheese with 1/4C Nutritional Yeast and it came out perfect.  The jalapeno added a nice kick.

We adore this pesto. Used fresh ingredients from my garden. This pesto is a five star recipe. Just a tad of heat on the back of your tongue. Not too spicy so you could add more jalapenos if you like. I did add the zest of one lemon. So glad I stumbled upon this recipe. Can't imagine why I didn't think of tossing a jalapeno into pesto before because if it grows together it goes together. Really great on white pizza.

Really good pesto as is!  I added a couple of extra garlic cloves  and a couple extra jalapeno's just because of my love for both!  I did add a splash of lemon.  Put it in an ice cube tray to freeze, so now I will have 14 cubes whenever I need one or two....  especially since no one else in my house likes pesto.  lol  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent pesto. I added the juice of two lemons, doubled the jalapeños and served it over spaghetti squash.

This was good. I had leftover jalapeños from another recipe and was looking for something to use them up. I'll admit I was sceptical about using walnuts for pesto (as I've always done it with pine nuts), but the flavors worked fabulously together. I did double use 2 jalapeños because that's what I had, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Will make again, keeping with 2 peppers.

Fabulous! Thought maybe the jalapeño might be too spicy or take over but it was actually perfect.  This was my first time making pesto without pinenuts. I will do it again. Great recipe Curiouschef. Thanks for sharing!

Since this was my experience with making pesto, I wasn't  sure of exactly what. Was looking for in taste, so I made 3 batches; Proper Pesto, Spinach/ Basil Pesto and Jalapeño Pesto. The Jalapeño Pesto won the taste test hands down.  The others were good but this one was the best. Served it with spaghetti squash. Wonderful....

this was amazing! I used fresh basil from my garden but added 1/4 cup of cilantro, 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2, 1/2 a jalapeno and used roasted peanuts instead of walnuts.   lastly I used a grated parmesan I had on hand.  A++

Excellent recipe! My dishes usually aren't spicy enough for me but this one is perfect! I used one whole large jalapeno from my garden.I think I'm going to put it on a flatbread with tomato and shaved parm.

This was really really good. I used a mixture of parmesan and asiago cheese and didn't add as much oil, and it turned out great!
