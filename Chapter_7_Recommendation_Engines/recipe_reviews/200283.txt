How delicious! I have never made pesto sauce before, so this was my first attempt and it was exquisite! Finding at the last minute that I did not have pine nuts, I looked up on the internet to find a suitable substitute, and finding almonds were appropriate (and I had them) I used almonds. They cut up beautifully in the food processor and I have some left over which I am going to freeze for another treat some summer evening! I highly recommend it!

This was fantastic! This was my first attempt at homemade pesto, and I will never be buying that nasty stuff in jar again. It is so fresh and all the flavors come together beautifully. I used 3 cloves of garlic because of previous reviews, but I don't think the extra clove would have been too much. I guess it depends on the strength of your garlic. I also used fresh parmesan, which I think is crucial to the taste of the pesto.  I served it with gnocchi and shrimp.  I don't have ice cube trays, so I divided the leftovers into little pesto "cookies" on waxed paper, put them in the freezer and then wrapped the frozen pesto in plastic wrap and then put them in a freezer bag.

Perfection. I was a little wary because other reviewers mentioned this tasting a little 'earthy' because of all of the spinach. I was also worried because once I blended mine all up the mixture only smelt of spinach. I had made this in the afternoon and stuck it in the fridge for a few hours. Once it came time for dinner it smelled much more like pesto. Actually one of the best pestos I've even had, this is one for the recipe books!

This is the real deal, truly amazing flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and since I do not have a food processor, I made this in my Kitchen Aid blender. I had to add all of the oil before turning it on with this method. I was pleased it worked just great. I used pine nuts and had no trouble finding them, I didn't think they were terribly expensive as some others have mentioned. Thanks Dianne for yet another wonderful recipe.

My 4, 7, and 9 year old love anything with pesto in it so I wanted to find a way to make it as healthy as possible since they eat it almost every day.  The spinach adds veggies and I used Walnuts to add Omega I added 1/2 cup more walnuts than the recipe called for.  Really good recipe.  I have huge crops of Basil in the summer time so I double the recipe and freeze in ice cube trays so it lasts for a few months.

Yummy!!! I thought the spinach may alter the flavor too much but it was awesome! I would slowly just add garlic to taste next time..it's a bit much (or maybe try roasted garlic?) and this is coming from a garlic lover! My cloves were pretty big tho. Great recipe!

Simplicity and fresh ingredients are a divine combo! I added cilantro, parsley, red pepper flakes, nutmeg and walnuts; omitted the cheese.

I forgot to add the lemon zest and I although I love garlic, I might use just 3 cloves next time.  This pesto made a great addition to my whole wheat pasta with sauteed onion & red pepper.  I'm sure I'll be using this recipe again and again!

Looking for a way to use up an abundance of spinach & basil in my garden is why I looked for someting like this since it would freeze easily & I could enjoy my bounty for an extended period of time. I made with & without the basil - I preferred it with basil but much to my surprise, my family preferred the version with out basil! I will use 1 less garlic clove next time though only because it slightly overpowered, also I love the lift it gets from the lemon!

Watch your salt! This turned out too salty for me when followed exactly. It's better to leave out the salt until the end because your parmesan cheese (depending on the brand) can have a lot of salt in it. I also added extra garlic which can act as a salt-like flavoring to dishes and depending on how "garlicky" your garlic is, you may not even need salt.  At the end, taste and if salt needs to be added. If so add in 1/4 tsp, taste again, then add more if needed. This is a very versatile recipe, perfect as-is (just add salt to taste instead of all at once) or easy to change up. I didn't have lemon zest so used an extra tbsp lemon juice instead. Added more olive oil for a thinner consistency, threw in more pine nuts for added taste and only used half the parmesan because that is all I had. I have also made this with more or less spinach or basil.  This recipe adapts easily! Works in pasta or as a spread, just add more or less olive oil depending on the use.

My husband, daughter, in-laws and neighbors all love this recipe!  I subbed almonds for pine nuts and added spinach I reached my desired consistency.  I've served this over pasta and also as pizza sauce (with a touch of cream cheese added).  It's very quick and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

Delicioso next level. Everything on the recipe works. I did the it one day in advance, stored the pesto in the refrigerator. The next day I cooked spaghetti and while it was still hot y folded in the pesto, OMG, I was even asked what brand of pesto it was! Also this can be served with salad, makes a perfect heavy dressing.

I had fresh spinach and basil to use up but not enough of either to make its own dish. I thought the spinach would weaken the basil but no! It was very good! I can't eat dairy so I substituted olives for the parm to add saltiness. I can't wait to make it again!

Really fantastic pesto!! My whole family loved it. I made it exactly as written, except didn't include lemon zest and used almonds instead of pine nuts.  Pine nuts are really expensive! Worked great, use it as sauce on pizza, pasta, and in recipes that call for pesto. Freezes great in ice cube tray!

I was nervous to try this because I have never liked pesto...but it was bizarrely delicious! I added cilantro and put it on ciabatta bread (sprayed with olive oil Pam and toasted) - then put fresh basil, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese on the toasted bread - and broiled. So good!

This was an excellent pesto, but I found it to be way too salty. I added extra spinach, basil, and olive oil to cut down the salty taste. Next time, I'll use 1/3 the salt called for in the recipe, or just a squirt of Bragg's Liquid Aminos. Other than that, it was delicious!

Wow!  This is great!  I am not a pesto fan but loved this because the basil is not overwhelming. We used walnuts instead of pine nuts because I didn't have any and we added an extra 1 1/2 tsp. lemon juice to our taste.

Good, but the spinach was awfully strong. However, I only had adult spinach, would try again as written if I used baby spinach, but I ended up adding another good handful of basil to balance the taste. 
Also, I used raw walnuts, and no zest, but fresh squeezed lemon. Added more garlic, never can be enough garlic!

Really good!  Omitted the lemon and didn't miss it.  Frozen spinach worked fine and I pressed the garlic.  This was good just as a dip with bread.

I don't know what I did wrong with this recipe.  I used fresh homegrown basil, toasted the pine nuts and just followed the recipe.  Neither my husband nor I cared for it.  BTW, I do like pesto.....in the jar.

Very tasty and simple. Freezes well. Note: when you use this pesto in recipes, you may have to use up to 2x the amount called for in the recipe. The spinach mellows the basil flavors so that you can't always taste them when you use the normal amount.

Wonderful pesto!  I've make it without cheese as I don't care for it, and it's delicious!  The first time I also left out the pine nuts as I didn't have any, and the second time, I used toasted walnuts.  I add extra basil and just taste as I go to see if I need to add any extra garlic, salt, lemon juice, etc.  I dont use all the oil and like to keep some texture, so its not pureed till smooth.  Its wonderful on the "Unique Spinach Noodles".

Absolutely delicious! I had saved this recipe as soon as it was published but just now had a chance to make it. I only used 3 cloves garlic and it was perfect to our taste. Thank you Dianne, this is definitely a keeper!

I just got a food processor and this is the first thing I made. It's delicious!  I cut the recipe in half but followed the recipe exactly.  Nowadays I'm much more conscious of ready-made store bought food, with ingredients I can't pronounce.  This way I know exactly what I'm eating and it's so easy to make.

I will never buy jarred sauce again! So much flavor in this recipe. The spinach and lemon added an extra element to basic pesto. Loved it! I might make extra next time just to freeze. Pesto is always a good thing to have on hand.

Outstanding! Full of flavor, but not too overpowering because of the addition of the spinach. This stuff would be good on anything! Good olive oil is important for good flavor.

VERY easy to make and oh so good.  My changes for the most part were similar to others recommendations -- reduce the amount of salt and oil.  I used 2/3 the amounts for both and it's still very tasty.  The other change for me was to replace the spinach with.....carrot greens.  They have the taste of parley with a little more bite.  Perfect for pesto.

we left out the cheese as instructed to freeze it (we had a huge crop of basil to use up), and without even trying it with the cheese, it is so delicious!  i am sure it is even better with the parm, but we will save some fat and leave it out.

Use a microplane or garlic press for the garlic, otherwise, you can easily end up biting down on a tiny (yet very spicy) piece of garlic!

Yummo! I followed this recipe pretty much as it is. I didn't have any pine nuts at all or fresh basil, so I used dried basil leaves in less amount. It was perfect! I tossed it with fettuccine, shrimp and asparagus for a yummy meal! My kids even liked it, which shocked me because they turned their noses up at it at first because it's so green. I will be using this for my pesto sauce from now on! Maybe next time I will get pine nuts.

WOW. This is amazing!! I used mostly basil leaves instead of so much spinach because I needed a basil pesto. It turned out beautiful! Next time I would mince the garlic before adding it to to the food processor. I like mine with a bit of texture so I did not puree as much. Oh, and I used toasted sliced almonds because I didn't have pine nuts. A keeper, for sure!!!!! This batch will never make it to the freezer. haha

OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the pine nuts, I used almonds (my friend is allergic to pine nuts), but doubled it, since I was having a dinner party, and everyone loved it!  Every person raved about it, and I will definitely be using this recipe again.  Can not recommend it enough!  I added a little milk to smooth it out a bit, since it was so thick, but it's great either way!

I grew the spinach and basil, and this was absolutely great.  Pine nuts are expensive, but it doesn't taste the same unless you use them. I like to leave a few whole ones mixed in after pureeing the mixture.

Wow.  My Husband ate spinach and didn't even know it (and I'm not telling)!  This recipe makes alot.  I froze the left overs in small containers, this works for regular pesto - I'm praying that the spinach does not take on a stronger flavor when thawed.  We'll see.  Thank you for this recipe.  I'm always looking for ways to hide vegetables that my family turns their noses up at.  UPDATE - FREEZES GREAT!

I did not care for this.  I purchased the ingredients fresh from the farmers market and toasted the pine nuts...it just was bad.  It was very bitter and had a strange burning aftertaste.  I normally like pesto.  I won't make this again.

This is delicious and so easy to make.  I just had it topped on tri-colore rigatoni and goat cheese.  Very delicious!  I had to add just a tad bit more olive oil to get it to start blending in my blender.  Might want to use a food processor if you have one.

The pesto is great! I used it on whole wheat pasta and it didn't taste as wonderful as out of the bowl. I will use it on white pasta next time and I hope that will carry the flavor from mixer to pasta.

This was so good...I ate 1/4 of it with chips before it even made it to the ice cube tray for freezing.  Great with pasta and chicken.  This is now a staple and I will never buy pesto again.  I also wait and add the cheese when I thaw it out.  mmm!

This is EXCELLENT!!!  Stuck with the recipe as is and it turned out tremendous!!  I love pesto, but this was great because adding the spinach made it a bit mellower.  My wife and I are HUGE lemon fans (it's in my Alfredo sauce) and the lemon and zest are a perfect compliment.

So good!!  I reduced garlic to 3 cloves and used canola oil instead of olive oil (it's just a preference, I like raw canola oil better) and since I didn't have any pine nuts I tossed in a few raw cashews and it worked out great.  We topped it with sliced avocado.  So awesome!!

8/15/2011 OMG, so delicious, it's the addition of lemon that gives it zippiness that is sooo good. I even forgot to toast the nuts and I didn't put the full amount of olive oil and it was yummy. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. This is a great way to use the basil growing in my yard. I love this recipe.
9/23/15 Update: I make this several times every summer to use my basil. I've used pine nuts, almonds, walnuts - they all work. This year, I'm using kale instead of spinach because it's in my garden - it works, too. I cut the garlic cloves in half, cook them on the stove on a med-low heat for maybe 5 min w/a little oil, flipping as needed. I prefer cooked garlic over raw. Roasting would be great if you have time. I use the same pan to toast the nuts. I like to leave a few tiny chunks, instead of blending until all the smooth. 
This takes about 10 minutes to make. Freezes well.

So good! I may have added too much garlic (is there such a thing?) so it has a bit of a kick at the end. This is very good pesto. Try it out.

This was excellent!!  Because pine nuts are so expensive, I substituted toasted Walnuts and it was still amazing.  I'll be making this again, using walnuts instead of pine nuts.

This tastes great but I agree with other reviewers that it is way too much garlic. maybe 4 small cloves would be fine but my cloves were pretty big so maybe 2 large cloves instead of 4. I didn't use any salt and the almonds turned out great in it. I used more basil and more spinach to help mellow out the garlic and a little more cheese.

Better than store-bought.  Didn't have pine nuts, so used almond slices.  Left out the lemon zest and it was still great.  In a pinch, I'ved used dried basil.  Not great, but still good enough for a healthy quick meal.

Not your traditional pesto. I ended up adding about three times as much basil to even taste it, the spinach and pine nuts overwhelmed all of the other flavors.

This is great. I use it for the Penne with Chicken and Pesto recipe. For nuts, I used a combination of toasted walnuts and pecans. I made it for 60 people and it got rave reviews.

Don't think I'll be buying pesto anymore....this was so easy, flavorful and made enough for future meals.  Didn't even notice the spinach.  My only change was that I substituted Beecher's brand Flagship cheese for the parmesan.  Did the freezing method (cheese included) with a silicone mini muffin tray.  Popped them out and stuck in a container in the freezer.  They seemed to freeze just fine!

I just made this last night, and it was delicious!  Even with the 2:1 spinach:basil ratio, there was a nice basil taste-- the spinach did not overpower the flavor.  I used fresh regular spinach leaves.  Like other reviewers, I was just a bit short on pine nuts so threw in a handful of slivered almonds.  I did not have grated parmesan on hand, so used a shaved four cheese combination (asiago, parmesan, romano..).  Four cloves of garlic was perfect for my taste.  I used this is a topping for paninis and froze the rest.  Yum!

In small amounts, this is great. It was a little strong. VERY garlicky. Almost too much. I went down to 3 cloves, but I think next time I'll go with 2. Maybe I just don't like pesto, but I'll try a few more recipes before I make that a final statement.

Delicious sauce and the freezing trick is brilliant! I especially love the nuttiness of the pine nuts. I found it to be on the salty side though. Might cut back just a tad. Definitely something to always have on hand!

OMG! This recipe has compelled me to write my first review. This is EXCELLENT!! Amazing flavor and the lemon zest just adds something really wonderful and fresh to the recipe. I didn't have enough pine nuts so I did a mix of almonds and pine nuts, tossed it with some cool pasta and viola! perfect for a hot summer night! Thanks for sharing!!

First time making pesto.  Used basil from my basil plant.  Made the recipe as written except I think I may have added a little bit more parm cheese.  It came out so rich and flavorful!  I used it the same day to make stuffed red peppers...delicious!  Next meal I'm going to use the pesto to make the "Penne with Chicken and Pesto" from this site.  Enjoy!

WOW, terrific and so easy to make.  I would reduce the salt or completely omit when making again.  I used the recipe as written and used all fresh ingredients.  I will freeze the remained in ice cubes as suggested,  this recipe made about 2.5 cups.

Tip: Don't burn your pine nuts or you will end up with charbroiled pesto (unless that flavor is to your liking). I'm not going to knock off a star for my mistake because it was very flavorful and indeed pesto-y. I like how it has spinach for those extra health benefits.

This is a great recipe. The first time we, me and my 25 year old daughter, made this we made it according to the recipe. Since pine nuts a so expensive, this time I used roasted almonds with sea salt, I think it tastes even better make sure to cut back on the salt or not add any. I will use roasted almonds going forward.

I have never made or even eaten pesto before, but needed it for another recipe. This was a great first experience in both areas. I used frozen chopped spinach, walnuts, and lime (what I had available). I used fresh basil from my garden.  The flavor was not over powering but still very good. Thank you for the recipe.

Tasted great! I misread the spinach measurements and added a lot more but it came out fantastic. Thanks for the recipe!

Well, this is fantastic. I like that it uses spinach instead of all basil (I don't have to decimate my basil plants to make it). Also, the lemon was genius. We had it on pizza and it was so good! We used almonds (untoasted) and loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

I had never made pesto before, and this was surprisingly easy, fresh, delicious. I used an immersion blender to "process" the ingredients. Made clean-up a snap. Recipe yields enough to save/freeze leftovers for other meals.

This recipe was excellent! The amount of salt was fine. Keep in mind when you make a recipe that calls for kosher salt and you use table salt, you need to use less.

We did like this, but found it too salty (which is unusual for us-we're salt lovers). We reversed the amount of basil and spinach because we had loads of basil, but after tasting it with the salt, we kept throwing in more lemon juice and basil and spinach. We didn't add any more cheese because that was also salty. May just be our taste preferences, but next time we will add a tiny bit of salt at a time. We also added a higher ratio of lemon juice to oil-partly because we like lemon and partly to reduce the fat. We also prefer a thicker pesto so did not add all of the liquid. In the end we loved it.

As delicious as it looks. I followed the recipe exactally, besides using a little more spinach than called for because we needed to use ours up. A nice thick, hearty sauce that tasted great.

Super yummy and healthy. Have also used swiss chard in place of the spinach and it worked out almost as well, although was a tiny stringy but that was probably just the swiss chard I was using. Also, I have made it without the pine nuts and decided I like it better that way.

Amazing! Like other's I replaced the pine nuts with almonds. I also ran out of grated parmesan so I used half grated and half shredded. I left this a little bit thicker too. My only complaint is that I don't see how this could be 24 serving, probably closer to half of that. Wonderful recipe, thanks:)

I am rating this a 4, because I think it turned out okay, but I think I just don't care that much for pesto. I had some basil I wanted to use up and found this recipe. I made 1/2 the recipe and it made about 4 servings. I am not sure how that could be stretched to 12. I subtituted blanched almonds for the pine nuts, because it was the closest with what I had in the house, but kept everything else the same. I thought the texture looked a tad creamier than I know pesto to be, but I may have ground it too much. Now, I will just have to figure out something to put this on.

I used to make pesto with basil only (without the spinach), but not any more. This recipe, which I have been using for over a year, is perfect. Sometimes I leave out the pine nuts (can leave a metallic taste if they are from China); it's just as good without them. My daughter's request for when she comes home from college next week: please make the pesto. Freezable, but also keeps for quite a while in an airtight container in the fridge.

I love this recipe!!!  I have to say that the whole reason I used it was because I was making another recipe on this site (Pesto Chicken Penne Pasta) and didn't want to use store bought pesto.  It worked out perfectly because I needed spinach for this one AND that one.  I followed it exactly.  I do have to say that I cut the pasta recipe in half and used one serving of this recipe.  I will be giving 5 stars to that recipe too.  WOW, what a fantastically great meal !!!!

I normally make pesto, so much better than store bought. But this recipe was a total hit! Even my super fussy 3 year old wolfed it down. You can not taste the spinach AT ALL! The only thing I omitted is the parmesan as I don't normally use it anyway. Will be making this weekly!

I wish I read the reviews of this before I made it. I love garlic, but it overpowered the pesto. I added an extra cup of spinach and lots of cheese to fix the problem.

This is - by a landslide - my favorite pesto recipe.  I make it as written, though sometimes without the pine nuts.  It is just as vibrant and tasty after a freeze &  thaw.  I find it doesn't last long in my freezer though. The spinach adds a lovely dimension to the flavor!

Wonderful flavor.  Fresh ingredients are a must.  I also substituted walnuts for pine nuts because I could not find them.  I took the advice of other reviewers and froze teaspoons of the pesto on a baking sheet for a few hours and then wrapped 2 or three together in saran wrap to make thawing individual portions easy and quick. I've already made 3 recipes using this pesto and all have been wonderful.

So very good. I didn't have kosher salt so I used a little less than 1/2 a teaspoon regular. And I used walnuts (not toasted) instead of pine nuts. SO DELICIOUS!!!!

This was a fabulous "pesto" recipe. Instead of pine nuts (my fiance is allergic), I used some walnuts, just to give it that nutty flavor. I froze the extra, and I plan on making again!

I made this without the cheese and used almonds because I was out of pine nuts. It was absolutely fabulous! I took it to a dinner party in a Pesto Quinoa salad (from allrecipes.com) and even though it was super easy everyone thought I was such a great cook.

Delicious, subtle basil pesto!  I used cashews instead of pine nuts (not a huge fan of pine nuts).  Also omited lemon zest because I only had lemon juice in the house and used a light tasting olive oil.  Will definately make again!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I followed it exactly and loved it.  Even my kids and husband - who don't eat vegetables - loved it (I, of course, didn't tell them what was in it.)  It is good as is, but it is also good with about 1/2 C cream (probably any dairy would work) added to make it creamier.  I am making a second batch today!

My husband and I both thought this was great! It was my first time making pesto. The spinach does give it kindof an "earthy" taste, but overall we really enjoyed it! I only used 3 cloves of garlic because mine were very large, next time I will probably only use 2 because it was a little strong.

This was very good.  I didn't have any basil, though, so just used spinach.  Very yummy.  I think I added more garlic, but I like a lot of garlic.  I ate it on crackers, and put it in pasta, and spread it on my sandwiches.  Very yummy.  Great way to sneak in some veggies.

This was excellent!  I thought the addition of spinach would lessen the flavor, but it wasn't an issue at all.  I added a little extra garlic and actually think it probably would've been fine with just the 4 cloves as the recipe calls for.  I ended up making a double batch because I like the first batch so well!

I've never had pesto before but was looking for something different for my pasta so I tried it. All four kids ate it without complaining. Two of them and my husband polished it off. I've made it twice now and will definately make this again. I also followed somones advice of freezing it in ice cube trys. Great idea! Thanks

Very tasty as is.  I froze cubes of this, and used 3 cubes over linguini noodles and shrimp tonight.  Drizzled the noodles with a little extra EVOO and topped with grated Parmesan.  Added a Side salad, and this was a nice meal.  My husband liked it too.

I made it with what herbs and greens I had on hand. The flavor was great but it could have been a little creamier. It may have been my greens and nuts. I am sure pine nuts and basil would have been perfect as written.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I adjusted it for 60 servings for my freezer. I screwed up by using 1.5-TBSP, of kosher pink salt instead of teaspoons. OOps.  I filed 3-500ml mason jars + another 250ml jar for my fridge. It is delicious. I love the combo of spinach + Basil leaves. Tip...pulse the nuts in the processor first  before adding the other ingredients. Use a thinner viscosity olive oil, designed for salads, as it is lighter & less dense. Also do add the zest of lemon, as it makes a difference.

I've made this so many times, it always turns out perfect!  You know you like pesto when you can't put it down to put it in your meal!   There have been several times when I haven't had enough pine nuts, but most nuts substitute well.  It goes really well with walnuts and cashews.  Tonight I wanted to quadruple it so I could freeze a bunch and I ran out of all those.  I tried it with almond butter and it turned out great!  I used much less than the suggested amount because it's much denser than whole nuts.

I started making this years ago and my wife loves it! She uses it on everything from steamed vegetables to meats to pasta. I never learned how to measure cups of greens, so I  use a whole container of baby spinach, 5 containers of fresh basil, the zest and juice of a whole lemon, a whole bag of toasted pine nuts, a whole head of garlic, 1 tsp of salt and pepper and 4 tbls olive oil. I don’t add the Parmesan cheese cause it makes it too salty. Purée all of it and put it into ice cube trays and freeze. It will last +1 yr in a zip lock bag and it yields 19-20 cubes, good for 10-15 meals.

This is another great way to add raw spinach in our diet. My husband doesn't like it cooked;). I also roasted the garlic, and put 2 heads of roasted garlic. We had it over spaghetti squash it was so delicious!

This is the best pesto recipe I've ever made! I'm always proud to serve this to friends and family.  I also love that you can freeze it so not a drop goes to waste. I didn't change anything and its so much better than any pre-made, commercial kind. Impress all your friends and make this!! - cthephoenix

Excellent and easy (and forgiving). I burned some pine nuts and it didn't seem to matter much. I doubled the recipe and (since pine nuts are so expensive) used 1c pine nuts, 1/2 c. slivered almonds. toasted them all together on the stove top. it's amazing.

I loved this recipe because it uses spinach, but tastes like basil.  I am too cheap to buy pine nuts so I used walnuts and it's still delicious!  I didn't use all the oil because it didn't seem to need it.  I also made it with sage and it's delicious too.  The basil is better, but it's a good way to use up sage.

Came out great -- left out cheese, used walnuts since they are more affordable and reduced oil.. left out lemon & still is great.. Love that I can freeze.. will be great fast marinade.. or plan brush on grilled stuff, hot or cold pasta dishes.. After its frozen I will keep it in quart zip lock -- just like my sons baby food.

This was a very tasty pesto and a great way to get my boyfriend to eat spinach. I only rated it a 4/5 because the texture was too clumpy and kept separating from the oil, which would have been great if we wanted pesto on sandwiches or to serve on toasted baguette as a dip, but used it as a sauce for gnocchi. Next time I will try less oil and add cream to get the desired consistency. Also, we topped with feta cheese, which really drove the flavor party home.

My go to pesto recipe! Great use for the basil plant that won't stop growing!! My husband finds it addicting. I make a batch every two weeks. I add two more cloves of garlic and reduce the olive oil to about 1/4 cup in total. We like ours smooth/chunky. I'm thinking about making a pesto hummus with this recipe!! Yum Yum!

This turned out fabulous! I listened to a few of the other tips to use real parmesan instead of the grated Kraft stuff.  Will be making this again!

I've been looking for a better pesto recipe for a while and think I've found it in this one.  My modifications were using walnuts instead of pine nuts for cost reasons. And toasting the garlic to remove the fresh garlic bite.  Love the addition of the lemon zest & juice.

Simple and flexible recipe with a bright flavor. Great way to use abundant spinach. When I don't have basil I increase the spinach to replace basil and add dried basil for flavor; not exactly pesto but tasty. I also substitute pine nuts with pecans when necessary.

I thought the garlic was way too overpowering- overall not bad but next time I would use less garlic.  Also just a note, I didn't have a food processor so I thought I could do it in the blender-Bad idea!  Unless you have a food processor don't attempt this - It was a big mess!

This was the best pesto I have ever tasted. I used half pine nuts and half almonds. I also used smoked pepper which added just the right dimension. Served over fresh tomatoes and carrot pasta. Whole family just loved.

We love this pesto, especially how easy it is to freeze in ice cube trays and just pull out a serving when I don't feel like cooking...which isn't often. :)

I've never cared for Pesto but that's because I've never had it home-made. This was delicious and very quick. I will definitely use a garlic press to avoid big chunks that don't process down next time. Will double recipe in the future because this wasn't enough for a full box of pasta.

I just made this.  WOW!  I never knew pesto was so simple.  From here on in, it's the fresh, homemade stuff only.  Careful with the lemon juice and garlic, it can really derail the flavor.

I tried this recipe looking for a way to use my extra spinach and basil.  I'm so glad I did.  It is beyond the best pesto I have ever tasted and/or made!  The idea of storing the leftovers in the freezer is a fantastic idea and tastes fresh every time!  My family and husband LOVE this recipe and I will definitely use it again and again!!!

Great but, as others mentioned, slightly garlicy. May have been better with only 3 cloves of garlic.  Next time may try using less oil to make it a bit healthier.

Loved it! Only thing I changed was the Parmesan cheese to Mozerella as it was all I had and pine nuts to cashew as it was all the supermarket had haha, and it worked fine! Also, added 4 deadly pieces of chili padi (or Thai Chili/Bird's Eye Chili) and it gave it an amazing splash of spicy! Other than that - great taste! (Would water down the paste with some water or oil though!)

This pesto was great! I made it to go on top of polenta stacks and my son couldn't get enough of it. I didn't have any fresh basil, so I used the minced version that I picked up from the store. If you do use this for a substitution, check to see if it has added salt. If so, you may want to omit the extra salt as it when then be too salty.

Oh my goodness, this is unbelievably delicious!! I made it for a pasta party, EVERYONE LOVED IT! Including people who "don't like pasta"! I'm glad I made a double batch because everyone wanted seconds! BTW there was none left to freeze, but that was a good idea, maybe next time :) THANK YOU!

This pesto appealed to my taste. The recipe is quick and easy to follow. Substituted walnuts for the pine nuts. I also loved that this pesto kept it's bright green color unlike my basil pesto, I used baby spinach and did not experience an Earthy flavor. Thanks Diane~

freaking delicious! made this for the office pot luck, wasn't any left afterwards.  smells and tastes great even when it's not warmed up, and gets better when it's left to sit on the counter overnight (guessing the oils mix better at room temperatures).  Spread over pasta with some grilled chicken, everyone loves it.
Like some others here, i used walnuts instead of pine nuts; i also used reggiano for a little extra kick.

LOVED this pesto! The only thing I did differently was walnuts instead of pinenuts. It was delicious! You can't taste the spinach at all and the lemon zest/juice makes this taste amazing! I used most of it on pasta with Salmon and saved some for homeade pizza the next day! Both were Excellent! I  Will be making this often!

I don't know what else to say other than it was so good that I seriously debated licking the bowl.  I've made it twice this week!  Delicious.

WONDERFUL.  I did use toasted walnuts and cut the garlic in half.  Only use 1/2 tsp of salt, the parmesan makes it salty. I wasn't sure how much it makes or how much to put on the pasta.  Just a tablespoon on a serving is plenty.  What a wonderful flavor.

Really tasty.  I had no nuts of any kind, so I toasted some fennel seeds (1 tbs) and added them.  I know that has no connection taste-wise, but i figured it needed a little crunchy texture.  It was really delicious on some angel hair pasta.  I'll try it again with some pinenuts sometime soon.

I;m not a very good cook, so when I had to make something for a church potluck, I was a little nervous to try this new recipe. Instead of pine nuts I toasted some walnuts, which worked beautifully, and only 3 cloves of garlic...and it was SUPER garlic-y. To fix it I doubled the amount of all the ingredients, except the garlic. (So basically I made a double batch with only 3 cloves total! I think I ended up using a bit more olive oil, and adding a little bit of pasta water to it to make it creamier. It was SO good! Definitely worth a try. Start slowly adding the garlic though!

Fab-u-lous! My first try at pesto and it was wonderful.  I omitted the cheese as personal perference and substituted Flax oil for the olive oil.   Will make many times over.

Super easy and really flavorful! The spinach element is a nice way to cut down on the cost of basil while also using up produce that your family may be tiring of. We made a big batch and froze half for later. Very little effort, very big taste!

Never made pesto before, but now, this is my second time. Love it. It's a very versatile sauce and I didn't have enough left to freeze. I used chef's blend (sweet, serrated and purple) and Thai basil. Watched the video and followed her oil emulsifying instructions. Perfection. Thanks Dianne  for a great and easy recipe.

This recipe was so delicious and yet so simple. It too kind about 5 minutes and then we were able to put it on our veggie pasta. We added extra basil, because it is a basil pesto. Great recipe!!

Have been using this recipe for years now. Sometimes it can be  garlicky due to how strong the garlic is. Nut we love garlic so no problem.

This is a great pesto recipe.  The lemon juice and zest gives it a bright taste.   The spinach kicks up the nutrition.  I reversed the quantities of basil to spinach because things can only be so healthy.  Plus, I had tons of basil.   
Thank you for this keeper!

I got myself a deck planter and planted lots of basil.  The basil is going great guns and I found this recipe to put it in (as well as others on Allrecipes).  I made the recipe today and I went the expensive route using traditional the pine nuts.  It is too good! My wife and I love it.  I'm anxious now to try it with some of the pasta recipes as well.  Thanks.

This is superb! It’s my first time making pesto. I don’t know I have been so afraid to attempt this. Especially with the amount of basil I have growing in my garden. I’ll never use the store bought stuff again. Fantastic recipe. And it freezes so well! It’s a keeper!

Ask my wife, I have never been a fan of pesto, but I  must have gotten store bought pesto in the past.  But, I love my wife and I made it. Her comment is “it is wonderfully good!”  Now I love pesto too. Darn good!  Love the butteriness of the pine nuts. 

We had it with noodles and she just had it as a wrap with lunch meat, provolone and a flour tortilla. 

I’m on a low carb thing so I think I’ll get some sliced turkey and lettuce leaves tomorrow. 

Thank you thank you.

This had great flavor! Yum! The only thing was that I found myself adding more olive oil and a little bit of pasta water to smooth it out a bit. Might be personal preference. Whole family enjoyed it. Will be making it again!

Excellent pesto!  I took the advice of others and added a little less salt and garlic.  I also had to add quite a bit of water to thin it out and so that it would mix all the ingredients properly.  The result was excellent though!

Very easy to make & very tasty.  I the only thing I changed was adding the graded parmesan when I added the remainder of the the olive oil.

I had a lot of basil left, so I doubled the recipe. I dry-toasted the pine nuts first and also added some red pepper flakes. Super-easy! Good stuff. I will try freezing some in ice cube trays.

This recipe was great!  We did exactly as the recipe said, and storing it in the ice cube trays worked beautifully!  We served it over spinach ravioli, and everyone loved it!

Amazing!  It was so easy I can't believe I've never made pesto before.  I substituted toasted almonds for the pine nuts and it was identical.  I love that it has the nutritional benefits of spinach and not just the basil.  This is a definite keeper as my new pesto now.  PS.  I've gone anti-cow milk and pecorino (sheep's milk) is my substitute for the parm. This is as good as the jar and better for me.  Thanks!

Out of necessity, our family has made this nut-free as well and it’s still just as good. Great way to sneak some veggies into our littles as well. They love this on their favorite pasta shapes. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  I used fresh basil from my garden, and fresh organic spinach from the grocery store.  I substituted pecans for the pine nuts because I live in Texas, and that's what I had.  I am guessing that pretty much any type of nut will do.  This fresh recipe was so easy to make, and worlds above the stuff you buy in a jar.  Guess what I am having for dinner tonight?!

I've made this recipe several times - and it always is great. I sometimes substitute walnuts or almonds if I don't have pinenuts - and add salt to taste after. Never buy already prepared pesto as this is so easy to make and so much better.

Only reason for the three star is due to my lack of being patient maybe? The sauce didn’t blend together very well for me after following the recipe.

My first experience not only making fresh pesto but also using a food processor and it turned out PERFECTLY! Fresh, flavorful and substantial: I paired it with cheese tortellini, grilled shrimp and fresh diced tomatoes. Love this recipe.

Very easy and delicious!  All I left out was the zest because I didn't have a fresh lemon on hand (used bottled lemon juice).  I prefer fresh, but didn't have any.  I also went heavy on the pepper and used 5 garlic instead of 4.  If you make this, you will never buy the remade stuff again!

So good!  This was my first time making pesto and this was easy and delicious.  I didn't have lemons, so I used lime.  And I didn't have quite enough pine nuts, so I added some almonds.  I only real change I made was to add red pepper flakes, because we like a things spicy.  I used part of the pesto with peas and green onions on a spinach pasta.  There is no need to change anything unless like me you are out of an ingredient.  Thanks for the recipe.

We thought it was really good. I added more basil than it called for.  I used a tad less salt and it was not too salty but I was worried about that. I used course Kosher salt. I toasted the pine nuts first in a pan. I may have used a little bit less of fresh garlic and I thought it was pretty strong. I usually use jarred garlic which I think is not as strong.  I only have a small chopper but it was fine.
I made it again and made a lot more of it.  I didn't use spinach this time and not sure if I should pat down the basil in the cup to measure it. I used 2+ packed down cups this time and upped up all the ingredients. I also added in some other greens like lemon leaves and arugula in some of my batches.

This was great pesto! I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a bit heavy on the lemon. I also used equal amounts of spinach and basil because I love basil. Next time I will use a little more basil.  I roasted the garlic which gave it a nice touch, but next time I will also add some fresh. I left out the salt and didn't miss it a bit. This is a keeper!

Delicious pesto! I followed the recipe as written and it is excellent as it is. I like that it is easy to make and freezes well. I mainly use this pesto to make my son's "deli" chicken sandwiches for school. This recipe definitely makes his lunches delicious, healthful and clean.

Made it as given in the recipe.  I’m from Johannesburg, South Africa and South African’s are not really pesto people.  That, for my family at least, has now changed!  We love this recipe and will now be trying other pesto versions. 

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Made a normal batch and a spicy batch with 1 tsp red pepper flakes and about 1/4 tsp paprika added.  Both turned out good.  I made it another time, but didn't quite have enough basil.  I wasn't going to count that one, but I think I may actually like it more. Maybe I'll cut back on the basil next time.  Oh, and I also used almonds instead of pine nuts for all three batches.  One of these times I might actually try the pine nuts... maybe once I've gotten rid of all the almonds.  Costco....

Awesome! I no sooner got the pesto out of my food processor when my husband spread some on a fresh tomato slice (basil and tomatoes from our garden of course!).  He raved about the pesto. I didn't have pine nuts so roasted some sliced almonds and since I love garlic I used a couple more cloves than what the recipe called for. We love it - this is a keeper!

A bit garlicky for me. My husband likes it fine as is. The sauce has a touch of unpleasantly hitter aftertaste, but that might have been my basil.


Edit: Raised to five stars because the flavors really blended overnight. Lovely.

Very fresh and the spinach keeps the pesto green.  Though I like garlic, I used half the amount to keep it light.  Many uses.

Would recommend you use less salt, cut amount in half as the parm chesse is also salty.

Great recipe!  I always make pesto this time of year and really enjoy putting it on almost everything.  With this year's batch of basil I added 1 1/2 cups spinach and a lot more garlic.  Thanks again for a great keeper!  Debbie

I have never tried to make pesto, nor have I ever tasted it. This was truly enjoyable. I  was a bit skeptical because other recipes I saw online were either all basil or mostly basil. I chose this one because I had more spinach than basil, like your recipe calls for. It was used to add to a slow cooker lasagna (also a first attempt) and BOY, WAS IT GOOD!  Thanks for sharing.

I absolutely love pesto, but I find that pine nuts are way too expensive. I used  walnuts this time and they worked perfectly. Sesame seeds work just as well.

Yum! Had a huge clamshell of basil that I'd never use before it went bad (but it was the only size at my local store) so I picked up some spinach and pine nuts for this. I made specifically with the intent to freeze and not use right now. I upped the serving to 40 to get to 1.25c basil leaves since that's how much I had. I used 1tsp salt (husband has high blood pressure) and sort of eyeballed the 6.75 cloves garlic because my garlic varied in size. It's a little garlicky but it's still great. I did use half pine nuts and half walnuts since pine nuts are so expensive, and I used fresh Parmesan cheese. Really good! I am freezing in ice cube trays and ended up with 27 cubes.

Excellent pesto.  Baked it into chicken breasts and they were delicious.  Had to use 1/2 cup "lightly dried basil" in place of 3/4 cup fresh basil because it was all that was available.  Because of the this, I also cut back a little on the spinach: 1 1/4 cup.

I've made it a few times and love it. It freezes well if you leave out the parmesan cheese. Add the parmesan after it's thawed.

I liked it, but didn't love it. Had a slight bitter taste that I didn't care for. I think this was because I used walnuts instead of pine nuts as a few other reviewers mentioned. This was my first time making pesto and used a blender with full amount of oil to begin with since I don't have a food processor.  Possibly these were my problems.

I liked the fresh flavor from the lemon. Consistency was great. I used frozen spinach that I thawed and squeezed the water out of.  Was uncertain how much to use as a substitute.  Used 3 oz by weight before thawing. Probably could have doubled without the spinach overpowering it.  I served most of the batch mixed in to a veggie stir-fry with shrimp and penne, and froze 1/2 cup for later. Very good. Whole family said they would eat it again.

Delicious! I didn't have all the necessary ingredients so I used half sunflower seeds and half almost instead of pine nuts. I also used tried basil instead of fresh. Was as good as the Costco pesto but a *bit* healthier thanks to the spinach.

Love this pesto! The combination of spinach and basil is a bit milder than straight basil yet still very tasty. I made it just as the recipe said and it turned out great. My husband likes it better than basil pesto alone, me too.

Spectacular! It has a wonderful bright flavor with the addition of the lemon and it's zest. I think it also helps that it has a little salt in the recipe.  I actually made three batches and froze some. Delicious!!!

I made it exactly as is and it was delicious! It reaffirmed my love of pesto. The addition of the spinach was great as it added some bulk and kept the basil flavor from overpowering the other ingredients in the pesto. Also the lemon juice and zest made things taste fresh without adding too much of a citrusy flavor that I don't typically like. Great recipe to make when your garden is overrun with basil and spinach! Will be freezing it for use over the winter for sure!

I try to always follow the recipe exactly the first time through as I did here. I thought the amount of toasted pine nuts was too much but I did it anyway ------ DELICIOUS!!! I've made pesto with home grown Genovese basil for years but adding the spinach and the lemon was a great change. This will be my new go-to pesto recipe!!!!

My husband makes pesto on a regular basis, but I was looking to use some spinach that was close to expiration. Thought maybe someone else had the inspiration to put the Spinach and Basil together. I was right!! So glad she did, cause I did not have to play around with the ingredients. This recipe is perfect the way it is and awesome! My husband says it's better than his, so I get to make the Pesto from now on. My daughter has a severe nut allergy so we leave out the nuts, you can't tell, it's delicious!

I use this recipe over and over again. At first, I followed the instructions. Now I use it as a rough guide for the proportions and wing it with whatever I have on hand. Chard or kale instead of spinach. Almonds, pecans or weird leftover Brazil nuts instead of pine nuts. Lime instead of lemon. Great every time.

I've never made pesto, haven't even had the jar stuff. It was so simple, a bit thicker than I thought. I really thought it was yummy. Made fresh fettuccine noodles and shrimp.

I made this with pine nuts and a second batch with walnuts. 
Both had too much lemon. I am very attached to good quality olive oil in what ever kind of pesto I make. I don't think I can recommend this one.

My measurements may not have been 100% accurate (I think I used a bit more basil) but this is delicious! I also substituted walnuts for pine nuts due to allergy.

Fantastic sauce! I served it on grilled chicken and was a big hit.  My husband has been eating the leftover sauce on chips.  Easy to make in food processor.  I omitted the lemon zest and used almonds instead of pine nuts.

This Pesto sauce is the best by far!! I have never made Pesto sauce before, this was my first attempt, aMy hubby, Kids, and family members LOVED it! I'm missing a piece for my food processor so I used my nutribullet. As other reviewer suggested, I added the oil first and a little bit of water and then added the rest of the ingredients. It came out really good! Thumbs up! This recipe is a keeper!

absolutely delicious. I used toasted almonds instead of pine nuts as I didn't have any. I also added maybe 3 tablespoons of EVOO as I always try to cut the fat and used maybe 2 tablespoons of water (or pasta water would be good) to thin the sauce. Also used whatever juice I got out of 1 large lemon.

I made my first batch according to directions with the exception of adding a bit of parsley. The flavor was great but was a bit too oily for me. The second batch I added about an extra cup of basil (I didn't measure) and more parmesan  and about 2tbsp of lemon juice. It came out thicker and pasty. I decided to combine the 1st and second batch and it was perfect. I made dinner with some and froze the rest.

This is the only way I make my Pesto~ Meaning with Spinach & Basil but I always use dry roasted salted almonds - if you use  plain dry roasted almonds, you'll just need to add salt:-) it's beyond fantastic~ and even better to add a bit of crushed red pepper flakes!

delicious recipe, but i did make a slight modification to the recipe  instead of using pine nuts i used cilantro about a pinch less than 1/4 of a cup and added a whole avocado to the recipe and it was more than delicious, it made the pesto extra creamy! cooked this for me and my wife one night and we loved it!

p.s.  also if you use crab meat or even the imitation crab meat it will make the pesto turn sweet in a bite with the crab!!!!

Great recipe!!! I have made this one a few times. This time i made the pesto in a vita mix. It was so easy & was ready in less than 2 minutes! I mixed in the pesto with Zucchini noodles & plain grilled chicken I made on my george foreman. After I mixed everything together I heated it in oven.  My husband & my brother both loved it! I would defintly make again. Oh, I also used walnuts in stead of pine nuts.

Yum! Followed recipe.  Packed the basil, probably used a little extra.  Didn't measure the lemon, just used the juice and zest of one.

Tried this because I had some leftover fresh spinach and lots of leaves on the basil plant. I also used the almonds, having no pine nuts. I love the added depth of flavor the spinach gives! Also, just because I like the, I added about 10 large black olives, but cut back on the salt a bit. I love it and definitely plan to make it again.

I just made this Spinach and Basil Pesto...  OUTSTANDING   The lemon zest and juice truly brighten it up and the garlic is perfect.   I froze some of the pesto for use later.   Put it on Linguine noodles just scrumptious !  Definitely making this again and again !

Just made this and it's amazing! I took someone's advice and tried almonds and it was perfect (not to mention a healthy bonus). I did find that I needed more oil than recommended. Great pesto sauce!!

I would have used 3 garlic cloves. However it's an amazing but I taste too much garlic. And more oil for the texture.

SO GOOD! I cannot believe how incredibly easy this was and how good it tastes! Why have I been buying sub-par tasting, jarred pesto? Crazy. I made this recipe to spec; didn't change a thing. And I'll be doing it many more times in my future cooking. Thank you so much for this!

I can't believe how much my 7, 8, and 11-year-old children love this. Like other reviewers, I used raw almonds instead of pine nuts. I didn't toast them and it was still amazingly delicious. I've made this twice and doubled the recipe each time. Even put it in the kids' lunches as a dipping sauce the next day. Definitely a keeper!

A super easy ,and delicious, pesto!  I made one big change though...almonds instead of  more expensive pine nuts.  It worked splendidly!  Freeze in ice cube trays as the author of this recipe suggests.  You will use these handy cubes frequently for sauces, pesto mayo and other tasty pesto recipes!

This is so good! The lemon zest & juice add a nice freshness to the pesto. I subbed walnuts for the pine nuts. I made this to use as the pesto for AR Tenna's Spicy Pesto Chicken recipe. It looked & smelled so good, I could not wait. I use a piece of french bread to clean out the food processor. This would be great on pizza, as a dip mixed with some goat cheese or ricotta & of course over pasta.

This is a really great pesto recipe!  I didn't have a lemon so I used bottled lemon juice instead of fresh and didn't add any zest.  It was still really good!  Also, I used the canned grated parmesan.  This has now become my go to pesto recipe.  I tossed it with some penne pasta, chicken and pine nuts.  Delicious!

My family loves this recipe!  I don't keep pine nuts in the house so the four times I've made this recipe, I didn't use any and we didn't miss them.  To change it up (and use what's in my garden), I've made some batches with a couple jalapenos thrown in which adds a nice kick.  It's also very good mixed with melted cream cheese for a creamy pesto sauce.

Good recipe.  I add the parm at the end to taste and less salt.  Try a little mixed into some sautéed zucchini noodles (made with my julienne peeler) and topped with a poached egg for a delicious, healthy easy weekday dinner.  Also is nice lightly dressing some homemade, fresh spinach-fettuccine noodles as it just enhances the flavor.

This is the absolute best pesto I've ever had! Even better than that my one year old helped me put it together with the basil and the spinach. I wasn't expecting her to like it but after one taste she kept asking for more!

My kids (9&11), hubby and I loved it. I did buy pine nuts from the bulk section in the grocery store and toasted them myself. The pine nuts are not too expensive when you buy bulk because this recipe doesn't call for much.

Fantastic!  Because of the price of pine nuts, I used half almonds, and this turned out great.  I got about 1.5 cups out of this recipe (I was wondering how much "12 frozen cubes" would turn out to be).  It's nice to be able to serve spinach to my husband without having to hide it.

Made this yesterday for pizza. Just sort of threw everything in the food processor. We all loved! Flavor is outstanding. We love regular pesto too but can't hurt using spinach too. Liked the lemon twang too. It's a winner!

This is great, and it's easy since I have basil growing in a pot on my deck. I found a food processor easier to use than the blender, though.

It's yummy!!!  My kids are devouring it!!  It's different than my usual pest but this is a great substitute when you don't have enough basil on hand.  I also used fresh lemons that we bought at a farmers market in San Diego 2 weeks ago...yummy!!'  I also used pecans because they are so much cheaper than pine nuts and I cut back on pepper!!!

I never write reviews but I feel compelled to do so as this is my go-to. I love it!! I am so happy that I found this recipe and will incorporate it into pasta dishes, chicken dishes etc. 

I don't put in the lemon zest as I don't have on hand and it's still deelish.  :)

We loved this recipe.  I enjoy it as dip, on pasta or add it to a jar of Alfredo sauce with chicken and pasta and it's great.  I believe I made it almost exactly as the recipe said to- I doubled it and froze it in small containers and it was great right out of the freezer.  I added the cheese before freezing and it did not cause any problems.

This was the BEST PESTO I've ever made!!! I made this vegan by omitting the cheese. I also pan roasted the cloves of garlic in their skins along with the pine nuts to reduce the bite of raw garlic. I had this with baked chicken, rice noodles, scallions and sun dried tomatoes. SO YUMMY!!! c:

This is fantastic pesto!  I love that it also uses spinach along with the basil.  This is perfect as a spread on bread but we've gotten addicted to using it as a topping for tilapia.  Absolutely delicious.

This could not have been easier to prepare.  Such a wonderful fresh flavor.  I prepared it per the directions and it was great!  I served it over penne.  My hubby loved it (he added grilled chicken to his)  and my 7 year old liked to as well.

I omitted the Parmesan cheese and pine nuts but I have to say this is AMAZING! I sauteed chicken breast and added the pesto (cooked it a bit since the idea of raw garlic being in it, I dislike it) and then added the spaghetti, it was marvelous!

Very yummy!  We put this on a grilled chicken and havarti sandwich on toasted ciabatta bread.  So good!

I make this all the time and my family loves it. I usually substitute almonds for pine nuts because they are less expensive and I don't find there is much difference in taste. I freeze it in ice cube trays and then just pull out a few cubes when I need it.

This is an amazing pesto!!! I especially was looking for a recipe to use the tons of baby spinach I had and this was the one! Easy to make, VERY flavorful!! I will make this again and again. Seemed a little salty so will back off the salt, but other than that, no changes!! Thank you Dianne!

This was my first attempt at making pesto and it turned out so great. I didn't have pine nuts to I followed the advice of another review and used almonds. Fantastic!!

So good!  I'm on an allergy diet and this was fabulous as a vegan pesto!  I omitted the parm, used walnuts instead of pine nuts and it was totally delicious.

I loved this pesto. It was so good and I love knowing it's got the spinach "hidden" in there.
