Awesome cannoli dip! I will definitely be making this for any parties. To avoid having the dip be too runny I strained the ricotta cheese using paper towels. Simply put a cup of the cheese on paper towels cover and squeeze to get the moisture out and repeat.  I served with pizzells sprinkles with powdered sugar.

I hunted for a cannoli dip recipe after trying one made by a friend.  This is yummy--my preschooler even approved!  It's not overly sweet, especially if you use dark chocolate chips rather than semisweet, and it goes well with a variety of dippers.  Besides the waffle cone pieces, you could try vanilla wafers or biscoff cookies (or even strawberries for a slightly healthier option.)

I can't eat traditional cannolis because I stick to a gluten-free diet.  This recipe is the answer to my prayers!  Rich and delicious, this recipe will be added to my list of favorites.  And it's so easy to make.  This one's a winner.

This is SO GOOD. I made it exactly as the recipe says, it's perfect just the way it is. I used my electric mixer to smooth out the the dip as the cream cheese was pretty lumpy. I served it with chocolate chip teddy grahams and they worked just fine. I can't wait to make this again!

Made this last weekend for a bbq. Family loved it. It didn't have the consistency of a dip, more soup like. How can it be thickened up?

I made 1/4 of the recipe. That still yielded well over a cup. It just wasn't quite sweet enough and the texture of the ricotta was just sort of unpalatable to me.  In the real dessert, the filling always seemed creamier to me also. Are they using heavy cream, mascarpone, not sure. It was also missing a hint of fruit flavor maybe lemon or something that I have tasted in cannolis. I don't think it is this recipe as I have tried similar desserts and dips that play on the cannoli theme, just eliminating the shell, and felt the same way about the ricotta taste and texture. It does taste better after it is refriferated though.

Awesome sweet dip! However, no need to double unless you have 100 guests! (Voice of experience, have LOTS left over! Not good for the New Years resolution of eating better!!) I did add 1/2 tsp of almond extract just because I like it, but tasted before that and my rating is based on how it was written.Fabulous, guests loved it!

Loved the taste of this, but like other reviews, it came out very soup like. I saw the reviews to strain the ricotta a little too late as I'd already made it. However, for those of you who also didn't strain the cheese and ended up with cannoli soup, you can fix this by taking three tablespoons of cornstarch and heating it in a saucepan with about 1/2 cup of milk (or heavy whipping cream) until it makes a thick smooth paste. Add this to your dip and mix it with an electric mixer until it's blended and smooth. Since I substituted 4oz of the cream cheese with a pint of heavy whipping cream (per another recommendation on here) I ended up with more filling than the original recipe and ended up using six tablespoons of cornstarch and about a cup of milk brought to boil (briefly) to bring the dip to the consistency of actual cannoli filling. It didn't affect the taste at all, but if it does for you, just add more sugar and perhaps more chocolate chips.

I made this with marscarpone instead of the cream cheese, and 2 1/2 cups of sugar, and took the suggestion to use an electric mixer to smooth it out.  Served it with teddy grahams (choc chip and cinnamon varieties) and vanilla pizzelles. Everyone loved it!  The recipe made enough for our party of 9 pre-teens and 6 adults, but every single bit of it was eaten-- we would have liked leftovers.

Excellent recipe! Definitely need to drain the ricotta ahead of time. I lined a colander with paper towels and let it drain over night in the fridge but you could squeeze the moisture out with just a paper towel if you need to make it same day. I let the cream cheese come to room temperature for 30-45 min before mixing. My father cannot have chocolate so I substituted the chocolate chips with 1/4tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp lemon juice. I thought it was good both before and after the additions. I served them with slices of nectarines, strawberries, green grapes and nilla wafers. I will be making this again. With an electric mixer, it really only takes 20 minutes.

My family really enjoyed this.  The only things I did differently were to strain my ricotta in a cheesecloth line colander and add a bit of grated lemon peel to the mix.  Delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly as written and found it to be bland and missing something. (Hense the 3 stars) I looked up other cannoli recipes and while the base was the same, several added cinnamon and some added orange zest. I decided to add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and another 1/4 tsp of vanilla. It tasted so much more like real Italian cannoli!

I Love this dip! and it is so easy to make! I made it for 2 holiday parties and people couldn't stop eating it. Just FYI - I used whole milk ricotta and I bought nilla wafers for dipping and it worked out great. For the people that said theirs was soupy, it might be because they used part-skim ricotta.. or they didn't refrigerate the dip before serving. Next time I think I will try crushing up some waffle cones or pizzelles and mixing them in there. Thank you!

I had an old cannolli filling recipe from years ago that is just about like this, to get the true filling, use marscapone in place of the cream cheese. Add almond extract instead of vanilla, add 1/4 cup finely chopped pistachios, and at the end, stir in 1/4 cup chopped marachino cherries. Make sure to dry the cherries on paper towels when done chopping them. If you want a thicker filling, increase the marscapone or decrease the ricotta. To get the creamy texture, make sure to blend the two cheeses throughly before adding anything else. Excuse the spelling, I'm getting ready to go someplace with this dessert and typing quickly! Enjoy.-PS if you make it thicker, just spoon it into sugar cones, waffle cones!-Update, 20 people at a party, they ate the whole thing! Were tired of chips and dip and this was like dessert before dinner! I went home with a tiny bag of leftover waffle cone chips!

It is so yummy ! I used whole milk ricotta and it wasn't thin or runny at all. I used a hand blender to mix it and then folded in regular sized chocolate chips with a spoon. Served with graham crackers and waffle cone pieces ! More than enough for the 5 kids and 5 adults that were there.

Let me tell you something....I think the kids loved this almost as much as the adults.  My friends 5 and 6 year olds loved the fact they could dip little Nilla cookies into this sweet dip.  They thought it was the greatest thing.  And the adults thought it was equally as clever and yummy.  Its a winner!

This dip is fabulous and I was the hero of our potluck! Made a couple minor adjustments - cut the conf. sugar down to 1 cup, used marscapone as suggested by others, and sprinkled some finely chopped pistachios on top. Used pieces of waffle cones and purchased Belgian waffle cookies for dippers. Definite keeper!

I made this recipe for an annual picnic my coworker has that has a lot of people are in and out of her house.  First of all  I made the dip the night before so it could sit & absorb the flavors.  The next day I brought it along with pizzels and waffle cones in a separate bowl broken up in pieces.  Within the hour it was gone.  So simple to make and great for a gather.   Followed the recipe's ingreds to the tee.   **someone suggested adding a flavor to it like lemon - I'll have to try that as well.

Ooh, so delicious! Wouldn't change a thing! For new cooks: when you mix the ricotta and cream cheese, it will be thick. Once you start adding the sugar, it will start to soften and become more smooth. This recipe does make quite a bit! Great amount for a party or large family, cut it in half for smaller groups or it will go to waste. I used an electric mixer until it was time to add the chocolate chips, then I folded those in with a spoon.

My sister brought this to my party yesterday - made with mascarpone cheese and mini dark chocolate chips. She served it with strawberries, blackberries and vanilla wafers. It was the biggest hit of the party (and we had tons of nice appetizers and sweets!) Several people asked for the recipe. I'll be making this all the time!

The flavor of the dip is fantastic. The texture was a bit thin for my liking but it was really good with Nilla wafers.

This is the BEST Dip I've ever made!!  It was a huge hit with my crowd.  It's not too sweet - just perfect!

I followed the recipe exactly!  

I did drain the ricotta based on some other reviews so it wouldn't be as runny.  I placed a few paper towels in a colander  with a bowl underneath to catch any drippings.  I poured the ricotta into the colander and let it rest in the fridge for a few hours.  Enough moisture was pulled out to make the dip the perfect consistency.   I don't think this step is necessary, but it works like a charm!  

Thank you for sharing this great recipe!  And Thank you to the other reviewers who shared the tip about draining the ricotta!!

Wonderful!  Made it as it is written and it came out perfect.  I used whole milk ricotta and didn't have to strain anything nor did I have any excess liquid.  I didn't change anything, used processor to blend and it came out perfect!!!  Will be making this again!

Not only did I love this, but all my guests loved it too.  Only thing I did differently was use a cheesecloth to drain the ricotta cheese overnight.  It got lots of the moisture out and makes for a creamier dip.  I didn't want to take a chance and have it runny, so I opted to drain the ricotta.  Was a big hit.  I will be making this again! Oh and it went very well with waffle cones.  Waffle cones were light and crisp with the dip

I have read other recipes and the ricotta should be drained overnight in a cheesecloth in the fridge - it won't be so thin or runny. I was wondering if it needs some lemon extract. Has anyone tried that? If so how much?

This gets 4 stars for ease of prep and very favorable reviews from coworkers.  I feel like it's missing some kind of zip to make it like a true authentic cannoli taste however.  I prefer the cream cheese over marscapone cheese recipes because they come closer in my opinion to that authentic flavor.  Plus cream cheese is a fraction of the cost of preparing with marscapone. Tip: blend with a power mixer to make very smooth, hand stirring will not have the same smoothness!

Why this recipe got so many good reviews is a mystery to me. The ricotta cheese makes this dip both too runny  and also lumpy (think cottage cheese consistency). You really have to drain and dry the ricotta if you want to avoid the soupiness, and even then you will still get the unpleasant lumps. The flavor was incredibly bland as well, and not like any traditional cannoli I've ever tasted. I had to add extra sugar, double the vanilla and then add a teaspoon of cinnamon to give this dish any real flavor.  This is one of those terrible recipes that should stay floating around on Facebook  where it belongs, and should never appear on a legitimate cooking website.  If you call this "cannoli" dip you might as well slap some Cool Whip on a graham cracker crust and call it New York Cheesecake, because that is about the depth of this trash dessert.

I took other's suggestions to really whip the cream cheese and ricotta well.  5 mins with a hand mixer did the trick.  So creamy and thick.  Used whole milk ricotta, I tried to drain it but nothing came off of it.  I did add some lemon zest and cinnamon as for my tastes it was a little too one dimensional.  That gave it the extra deliciousness I was looking for.  I didn't realize how crazy simple this is to make.  That might be a bad thing.

It was a big hit on Christmas eve.  It was a little to runny so I sprinkled a little vanilla instant pudding on top, mixed it in and waited a few minutes.  It firmed it up and you couldn't taste the pudding.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Good taste, but for me, too pudding-like once the sugar was mixed in.  For those who want a lighter, FLUFFIER dip simply whip cream , sweeten, and then fold it into ricotta and cream cheese .  I used 16 oz ricotta with 4 oz cream cheese.  I made 1 pint of whipping cream and sweetened with 1/3 cup powdered sugar  and added vanilla before FOLDING into the ricotta and cream cheese mixture.  Then I  mixed in the chocolate chips.

What an easy recipe! My only change was to add just 1/2 cup of chips - and glad I did. Even with just 1/2 cup, I felt there were too many chips.  But that's just me because I'm not the biggest chocolate fan. I think next time, I'll try another person's suggestion to add lemon. I'm pretty sure that's used in the original cannoli recipes. I served it with cannoli chips that you can sometimes find in the supermarkets. Perfect!

This recipe is so easy and so delicious! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I served with pizzelle pieces, honey and chocolate graham crackers. I think I've read waffle cone pieces, probably cookies too would be good-maybe mini vanilla wafers.

I like the flavor of this recipe, I added orange peel to the recipe for extra flavor. But as this recipe is titled....it is a DIP. I attempted it for cannoli filling and it was a fail accept for the cannoli (pizelle) shells I made into bugles. HOWEVER, this recipe is tasty and we used it as dip and it was delicious! Looking forward to using this with Nilla wafers or taking it as a potluck type plate with the cookies OR packaging it nicely in mason jars and delivering along with my pizelle cookies.

I think this recipe is great, but if you like the creamier essence found in many restaurant & bakery cannolis, put the ricotta cheese through the food processor before using. It breaks up those teensy, tinsy curds and you have a smoother result. For a lot of folks it's a texture thing with ricotta.  Also noticed that some folks missed the lemon/citrus flavor. That can be added with lemon extract or lighter with concentrated lemon juice, but lots of places don't add the citrus anymore. A preference thing. Don't use too much juice, though. You want the cheeses to cling together. Almond or almond/vanilla are a great addition to this.

I am on a low-sugar, low-carb diet so I made a couple of changes to make it a bit more "friendly" for my beau and I.  First I used Green Mountain Farms Greek Cream Cheese which has 2x the protein of regular cream cheese and I skipped the sugar and used Lakanto (aka Monkfruit) to sweeten instead of powdered sugar.  I also used 1/2 t of  Vanilla and 1/2 t of Vanilla butter nut flavoring to give it a buttery note/taste.  The result was AH-MAZING and not over the top sweet.  You could actually taste the cheeses instead of just the sugar!   I took this to work where everyone raved about it, especially after they discovered that it had NO SUGAR sweetening it.

I have made this numerous times for family and for massive functions. The key is to keep everything cold,  use WHOLE milk ricotta, sift or whisk the powder sugar prior to adding and if you have it, use clear extracts. {That last one is not needed but nice.}
Everyone who likes cheese, especially sweet ones :) will enjoy this!

My family (ages 9-48) all loved this recipe.  Yes, I tweaked it, but only bc I did not want it to be runny, as it was reviewed. I just cut back the Ricotta by half.   The consistency was then perfect for dip. It was 4 star by the given recipe ingredients. I then tweet the flavor by adding a few drops of Limoncello &  a couple shakes of cinnamon before adding the mini chocolate chips.  This recipe is a keeper!

Good flavor, a little too sweet, very runny after sitting overnight.  Needs to be thoroughly stirred next day before serving.  Food  with small, shaped sugar cookies.

Excellent recipe...! To easy to make, taste almost as good as a true Brooklyn cannoli. I whipped the cheeses together added some air to it and that really helped put a creamier texture. Then folded dark chocolate chips, served on chocolate gram crackers.

I made it, my husband hated it! Said it didn't taste like cannoli at all. I think this recipe calls for too much sugar. I thought it was okay but had higher expectations.

I took this to work for a pot luck dessert and came home with an empty bowl from a double recipe.  I used crunched up waffle bowls as dippers.

I, too, used mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese and it was great! Trying it today with cream cheese.

I followed the recipe but added 1/2 tsp almond extract. I also added thickener of 3 tbsp cornstarch and hot milk combined into a paste then added into the dip. Used whole milk ricotta. Beat everything til smooth.

I was missing some ingredients so I substituted 1% cottage cheese for ricotta and almond extract instead of vanilla then served it with leftover fortune cookies. Holy cannoli !!! We split into 2 bowls and added chocolate chips to one and left the other plain. My family devoured it all before I could could even chill it :) Perfectly creamy with the cottage cheese, not soupy as other reviewed with ricotta.

It was a HIT!  I only made 1/2 of the original recipe and it still yielded plenty.  I had a quarter cup of heavy cream left in my refrigerator and I added that to use it up...it gave it a smoother texture.  I also got a request to make it  for  a future gathering.  I seldom make anything sweet but this was so easy, I'll be definitely making this again.

We all loved the taste of this, our only thought was we wished the dip was thicker in consistency.  The taste was exactly what I had been looking for.

Excellent, simple recipe. Would give it 5 stars as is, but I have also made it using mascarpone  and a little grated orange rind. Would give that 5 stars too!!

The consistency was runny, even after chilling for over an hour.  I added 1 3/4 cups of corn starch to thicken it so that it could be scooped up to eat. The flavour was good.

This is delicious, but I recommend using less sugar than this recipe calls for, and then tasting it and adding more if you think you need to. I started with 1/2 c sugar. I thought it was sweet enough like that. 1 1/2 c would have been way too sweet for my liking.

Loved the original! Two thumbs up! I also made a healthier version: One 1 lb tub of 4% (full-fat) cottage cheese, 1/3 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 cup Swerve confectioners style sugar-free sweetener, and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. Mix together and enjoy. A half-cup serving is only 230 cal and gives you 17g of protein! Love getting my chocolate fix this way! Thanks again for the great original recipe!

Quick and easy, and is a special treat for my teenaged kids. It's even better the next day, and especially fantastic if you splurge and buy mascarpone to replace the cream cheese.

Absolutely wonderful.  We made this to go with pizzeles, and it worked quite nicely.  It was a good add to the pizzeles, and we will definitely do it again when we make the pizzeles.

Such a simple, yet decadent dip. I'm not much for sweets, but this hits the top. Between the crunch of the graham crackers and the balance of the dip,l it's always a hit at every party.

This was amazing! It tasted just like the dip I usually get from my local Meat Farms. Using a waffle cone was a great idea! I didn't want to have to take out the fryer to make the chips, just makes a huge mess for me. I added some confectioners sugar to the cone and it tasted amazing! I'll admit I've have a spoonful  of two of it plain! I didn't have the mini chocolate chips, so I used regular, and didn't have any problems. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Easy & Delicious recipe. It was a definate crowd pleaser.
I added the Zest of 1/2 a lemon and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.
*used a higher fat ricotta and no straining was needed.

Wow!! What a treat! I made this for our church picnic. After I taste-tested it,  I couldn't help but keep some for myself for later. I did change it up a little by adding some almond extract paste ( 1 good squirt) & 6 drops of orange essential oil (therapeutic grade that you can ingest).  One of the  other reviewers noted in her comments that she didn't like the texture of the ricotta. I used an electric mixer for about 5 mins, and it turned out very smooth, no graininess whatsoever.  Rave reviews & recipe requests galore! I was  even asked to make this for some special out of town artists performing at a festival!
 This one's a keeper!

It was delicious. However it tasted a little bit too sour due to the ricotta cheese and cream cheese so I would recommend cutting back on that a bit. For the Fourth of July, I decided to stuff the cannoli dip into strawberries and top it with a blue berry.

My company loved this!  I made it with fat free ricotta cheese and reduced fat cream cheese.  I reduced the amount of confectioners sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet for our taste.  I will try it again with even less sugar since the chocolate chips add plenty of sweetness.  I served it with cannoli chips the store happened to be selling (a new item) and it was awesome.

I did not drain my ricotta as is was very firm from the store. I did add a small amount of  pumpkin pie spice. 

Taste this as you add the sugar. I thought 3/4 of a cup was enough. I also felt about 1/2 a cup of chips in the dip was good but added more to the top to garnish.

When I made the cannoli dip .. I used Marscapone and proceeded with the exact recipe , and the results were "soupy " I decided to freeze it in a Tupperware container for several hours .. The outcome was amazing cannoli ice cream !! which I scooped into Sugar Ice cream cones .. I am glad I was able to   recover the soupy mixture and create a new dessert out of what seemed to be a disappointment. . My whole family, myself included  loved the cannoli ice cream ..

I agree with the other reviews - the dip needed lemon zest in order to truly bring the flavors together. It was thin and a weird texture due to the ricotta... I would perhaps add more cream cheese or drain the ricotta next time before making. But the flavors are definitely there!

This stuff is addicting! My favorite way to serve it is frozen as an ice cream sandwich. I use one cup of whole milk ricotta instead of two so it's thicker, 1 cup powdered sugar and 2 T Brown sugar. I also substitute the vanilla with 1 t almond extract.
I put a big spoonful between two waffle cookies from Trader Joe's and freeze. Amazing!

I made this just as written and it was a huge hit. I was a little nervous because it seemed a little runny after I made it. However, after 3 hours in the fridge it thickened up to a perfect consistency. I served it with waffle cone pieces and strawberries. This will definitely be one of my go-to dips to make for parties!

Flavor was excellent, however the dip itself was a bit thin.  The chocolate chips all sank to the bottom.  Will make again and thicken it up with less ricotta & more sugar maybe.

Loved it! I made it with mascarpone instead of cream cheese but only because all the "full fat" cream cheese was sold out (new years eve!). It was wonderful and very well received. Other cooks say it was not thick enough. It is true that it is not as thick as the filling of a cannoli. But because it is a DIP, it needs to have a softer consistency for scooping easily, especially if you are using thin dippers like Pizzelles (which I did). I thought it was just right and will make again.

Delicious - used 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups.  Turned out great.  I actually used this as filling for crepes for breakfast -- yum!  If the filling is a little too watery, use a little flour to firm it up.

I was able to mix it by hand with a fork by letting the whipped cream cheese get to room temperature and using about 2/3 cup agave syrup instead of sugar. It's amazing with graham crackers!

This was good, but we relied on my son to eat the whole thing.  It was not a big hit, but I am glad I tried it.

This was a really fun twist on one of my favorite desserts.  It was a little lumpy for my liking but it wasn't horrible.  I did double the vanilla and it was the perfect sweetness.  Served it with graham dippers.  I think strawberries dipped in it would be fabulous!

Loved it!! My husband loves canoli and orders one whenever we go out. This deconstructed canoli was perfect at our family BBQ. I made a full recipe and it does make a lot. I made the recipe as written except I sifted my confectioners sugar into the cheese mixture to make it smooth.  At 1 cup of sugar I felt it was sweet enough but added another 1/4 cup per Hubby's taste. I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon per my grandmother canoli filling recipe. Delicious!! I served this with cinnamon teddy grams and graham crackers. Definitely will make again.

I added 3/4 cup more confectioners sugar.  Without it this dip still had a cheesy aftertaste, but added sugar made it taste just like cannoli.

(My nine-year-old wrote this review. Clearly she is a fan.)

At the beginning, only with the cheeses, it was great in every way, texture and taste. When I  tried it with the vanilla and the sugar added it was still great. Everything was just great!  After it chilled it had a better texture! It's truly great and I suggest anyone in the world who doesn't hate life to make this delicious dip. I tried it with graham crackers instead of the traditional shell and it was amazing! Right when I tried it I said " five star!". the easiest dessert you've ever made! Try it! Love guaranteed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This dish was very delicious. It was very fast and did not take long at all. My family loved and licked the bowl. The only thing was that it was not as thick as I had hoped. Great dip I would definitely make it again.

Great recipe...I love the idea of a cannoli dip! I used 1 cup confectioners sugar instead of 1.5. I also used dark chocolate chips. I wanted to drain the ricotta to get the liquid out but since I was short on time, I added some homemade whipped cream so that it wasn't so liquidy. Put in the freezer for a few minutes and it was ready. Paired it with Anise Pizelle, but some of my guests loved it plain.

I doubled the chocolate chips :)  I couldn't find the Italian cookies so I bought raspberry Milanos and I am so glad I did.  The raspberry just adds a nice pop.  FYI -  I don't like cannolis and I loved it.  My husband loves cannolis and he was dipping his finger in it.

I drained the ricotta overnight in cheesecloth- made the dip thicker.  Definitely need to use a hand mixer to get a good texture.  This does make a LOT of dip.  For a small BBQ I could have made 1/2 the recipe.

How about 8 oz whipping cream or heavy cream, whipped with the confectioners sugar instead of the cream cheese. A wee splash of vanilla, then add the riccotta then chocolate chips. Maybe a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Just a different flavor, I think more rich than with the extra 'tang' of the cream cheese.

Just made this dip and love it. I used 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon oil instead of vanilla extract. The oil is Stronger than your extracts. I added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to the dip and added the other 1/2 to the top.

Excellent dip! I reduced the amount of vanilla to 1/2 tsp and grated about 1/8 tsp of orange zest into it. I also reduced the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup., though the full amount would not have been bad at all. I tried draining the ricotta (part-skim) for a few hours (around 5) and got no liquid out of it so I used it at that point. The dip was light and fluffy and not runny at all.

LOVE this recipe! It's my new go-to for parties, very simple and a crowd pleaser.  I reduce the conf. sugar to 1 cup because I use cannoli chips that are dusted with powdered sugar (found them in the bakery department at our grocery store).  My fave thing is that the leftover dip makes amazing pancakes- add some egg and flour and you're on your way to a super quick and easy breakfast!

I made this for holiday guests, but added additional sugar & vanilla and served it in Phyllo cups with semi-sweet chips on top. Everyone loved it (including my hyper-critical sister-in-law)!

A friend served this with pieces of sugar cones and teddy grahams. Very popular with everyone who tasted it. Very easy to make 1/2 recipe for smaller groups. I had to add this to my recipe box.

Easy to make. DELICIOUS! Very much like a cannoli. I broke up waffle cones.  No negatives.  Everyone loves it.

Every loved this!! So easy,too. It's best if you drain the ricotta cheese for a few hours. And blend thoroughly with an electric mixer until it's really smooth. This made a generous amount- and guests asked if they could take the leftovers home!

Served @ family party- big hit! Used low fat ricotta and mascarpone cheese in place of cream cheese. Used a bit more vanilla. Glad I read reviews - very good tips. Used hand mixer to mix. Not runny at all! Served with fresh strawberries , vanilla & lemon  pizzelles .

I used 8 oz of Marscapone Cheeze instead of cream cheese .
Let the ricotta drain over night on cheese cloth in a colander over a bowl.
Mix all ingredients together next day by hand not a mixer. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours before serving. Will thicken. Sooo yummy.  I served with waffle bowls broken into medium size pieces.

Be sure to use full fat ricotta and use a mixer for a smoother consistency.  I served with fruit, everyone wanted the recipe.  Emailing it now :)

Make sure you drain your ricotta good and let it set for about a day. Taste about right on and makes alot.

Family & friends loved it!  But of course made it my way. Used more vanilla than 1 tsp. but I like vanilla, all 12 oz. of chocolate chips since the bag size is larger than 8 oz. called for, 4 TBSP. sugar, stuck w/ the cream cheese and ricotta mixture and did not have to strain anything because the fridge firmed everything up. A previous reviewer suggested to use strawberries for dipping and they were on sale so we used and they were fantastic! Next time I would love to use some lemon zest liked suggested also.

I've made this twice now. The second time I forgot the vanilla and it didn't matter - it's that good!  I serve it with Stacy's cinnamon & sugar pita chips (can't take credit for that - that's how it was served by my friend who sent me the recipe) and it tastes just like a cannoli.  Another tip from my friend was to use ShopRite's part-skim ricotta, which doesn't need to be drained. So far mine comes out thinner than what you'd put in a cannoli, but perfectly thick for dipping.

Only thing I changed was cut the sugar in half and it was still SO good. It's hard to stop eating this. I took it to a cookbook club I belong to & everyone liked it. I used small waffle type cookies and brownie brittle for dipping. Really outstanding. Didn't drain or strain the ricotta either. Just use the whole fat type & you'll be fine. :)

Awesome and easy to make. I liked it more with vanilla wafers than I did with waffle cone pieces, but it was good with both. I also tried it on some healthy pumpkin bars without the chocolate chips and it was yummy.

* I used Neufchatel (1/3 less fat cream cheese) & Part Skim Ricotta. I do not recommend fat free dairy, but the reduced fat is delicious. 
* I also recommend that you do not try to make this without an electric hand blender. If mix by hand it just won't be any good. 
* Use mini chocolate chips for presentation. If you chop up large chocolate chips you get little flecks in the ricotta & it doesn't look pretty. 
* If you have a wet looking ricotta, drain it first. 
* Refrigerate before serving.
* For Cake Filling: I used 1/3 cup of Chocolate Chips, instead of a cup

I made this in a hurry for a party last night and served it with waffle cone chips. It was a HUGE hit with the party-goers and so simple to make. It's even better leftover today after sitting in the fridge overnight!

Skipped the chocolate chips as I don't like chunks in my smooth but otherwise made as per recipe. Very yummy! I served it with graham crackers for just the family, but think for a party I would add the chips and put out strawberries as well oh and teddy grahams for the kids.

This was really creamy and delicious. And super easy to make.  I might add a little kahlua next time to add a different flavor.  It makes a lot of dip, so plan to share it!  I served it with strawberries and italian cookies that had a vanilla flavor.
