Easy and tasty, this is a Gluten free dessert using healthy ingredients to include the positive health benefits of coconut oil. The ingredients can be easily adjusted to your taste buds!

Sorry but I did not care for this recipe. I don't understand the need for the oil.  All it did was give slighly warm raw apple chunks a slick coating.  There is also way too much cinnamon for one apple and a 1/2 cup of rice chex.

I really loved this dish! I admit that the one reviewer's post made me a little apprehensive about trying it, though. I, too, thought the recipe called for too much cinnamon and that the apples would end up being very raw with so little time in the microwave. I diced the apples in very small pieces and decided to use the amount of cinnamon the recipe called for. I didn't have any Rice Chex, so I used Ezekiel 4:9 Almond Cereal instead. The 45 seconds in the microwave was perfect for me! The apples came out slightly softened, the cinnamon was the perfect amount, and the cereal was still slightly crispy. I topped it off with diced strawberries and a small dollop of fat free whipped topping. I loved the textures that were going on in my mouth! This is a delicious HEALTHY breakfast, snack, or dessert! Thank you, Tawnya.

this is awesome but seriously, microwaving it is just all out wrong lol. medium heat in a pan, add just a touch of brown sugar and cook the chopped walnuts in it too. cook until the apples are soft. Soooooo good! but also pretty sweet and small portions are all I can handle of anything sweet. Great kids breakfast, would be great addition to oatmeal and I really cant stand oatmeal. OOOOO or quinoa. this would rock with quinoa. mmmm. yeah, quinoa.

We had this for breakfast this morning.  Both kids enjoyed it.  We followed the recipe as written, but I didn't crush the cereal, which made it even easier.  We will make this again.  It would also be a great snack or light dessert if topped with some whipped topping.

I used 1/2 the cinnamon and all the coconut oil called for. I melt the oil slightly first so it stirs into the mix better.  All loved it except for our picky 7 year old.
