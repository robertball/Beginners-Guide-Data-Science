Another great way to prepare asparagus.  I added fresh, not roasted, garlic, and I also used olive oil rather than butter.  Great side dish for my grilled soy and garlic marinated chicken breasts.  I mixed the remaining chicken and asparagus with white rice to make a one-dish lunch for us later this week.

Quick, easy & deliciou! The second time I made it, I actually followed the recipe, but doubled the teriyaki sauce, then tossed it with hot cooked spaghetti noodles.  My husband loved it!

Way better than a routine vegetable side dish.  I used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter," spread--the one with only 5 calories per tablespoon--instead of butter, and it turned out great.  Highly recommended.

We usually steam our asparagus and sprinkle it with salt and lime juice but this was just as yummy!  I used soy sauce instead of teriyaki and sprinkled it with a little salt. Thanks for your recipe Sharon, it's a nice alternative to our usual way of cooking asparagus.

This was great with the changes I made, I actually was cooking from memory.  I cooked in a skillet with some olive oil the garlic, added the asparagus then put about 1/2 cup of the teriyaki sauce in and covered it and let the sauce steam the asparagus.  I actually like my vegetables on the soft side so I left it for about 10 minutes.  It was wonderful.

This wasn't too bad. Was a way to have asparagus differently, but I still prefer it where the flavor isn't masked by something else.

Great recipe.  I realized after I had started cooking that I didn't have teriyaki sauce, so I did quick sauce of BBQ sauce, a splash of red wine vinegar, a squirt of sweet hot mustard and it turned out great.  I can't wait to try it with teriyaki sauce!

I just made this and it was amazing! I opted out of the teriyaki sauce because I didn't have any.. but this was still yummy and blended better with the burgers. I did add a bit of salt and its amazing! Make this!

I omitted the onion and garlic (no onion and I usually use some garlic powder but forgot :P) and I cooked the asparagus with the teriyaki sauce. I also added 1/4 cup chopped almonds. My husband doesn't like vegetables but he asked for more of these!

I'm new to eating/preparing asparagus.  This was a great recipe!  I added a little butter after I had it on my plate.  Other than that, followed everything to a tee!  I might would cook the asparagus a little longer next time, but didn't want the onions to overcook this time around.

Excellent recipe.  I had decided to stir fry asparagus but I didn't know what to do with it.  The asparagus was cut up and cooking in my pan when I quick, did a search for asparagus recipes.  This was one of the first I saw and it was exactly the ingredients I love.  My whole family really liked it with our orange chicken & fried rice.  Delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

Followed previous posts suggestions and changed the butter to olive oil; sauted the chopped garlic for a bit; then added the cut up stalks (oops forgot the onion, was still good) and dumped in a lot of teriyaki sauce; sauted a few minutes then added the tender tops; continued to saute until tender; served over hot spaghetti topped with toasted almond slivers. My asparagus was not too fresh, but this still turned out yummy.  (Remember to break off the tough bottom!)Five stars from me-an almost vegan. Non-veggies may call it a four.

Not bad but not outstanding. We thought it lacked flavor. Maybe doubling the garlic & teriyaki sauce would work? I'd give it a 3.5.

Quick , easy, tasty! I added a little more homemade teriyaki sauce and added some leftover rice. Topped with toasted sesame......yum! Oh I did not have roasted garlic , I used raw which I cooked with the onions , maybe that would have added more taste, but this was good nevertheless.

Tasty! We like ours softer, so I cooked for 10 minutes. The little bits of almost carmelized onions really made the dish- as well as the teriyaki sauce which we all love.

This was a nice new way to cook asparagus. Asparagus is one of my favorite side dishes and I am always looking for new ways to change the asparagus's flavor. This recipe was perfect for that. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the meal I made with it. Needless to say, I was very thankful that the asparagus was so tasty.

This is quick, easy and delicious. Since I was having it with an Italan themed dinner, I did not use the Teriyaki sauce. Rave reviews!

Tasty and easy.  I use about a tablespoon of olive oil instead of butter and I use raw garlic (although roasted garlic would be tasty and would make the dish a little creamier, I just lack the foresight).
