This was yummy. I didn’t have  fresh oregano or rosemary so I added olive oil to the spice rub and let the dry herbs soften for about an hour. I browned both sides of the steak on the range for 5 minutes on each side, added  2 TBS of butter and then placed it in the oven.  We like our steak medium so this added a bit more cook time.  I also didn’t have beautiful shaved Parmesan  just the green canister kind so I dressed the arugula with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper and some of the  cheese- once the steak was plated I did  drizzle with olive oil, lemon juice and more Parmesan.  I will make this again.  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE.
