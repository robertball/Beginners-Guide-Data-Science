This has become my favorite way to eat beets. I altered the recipe a bit. I added carrots which I steam whole with the beets and then dice. I also add lemon juice and cilantro to taste. Yum!

Sorry..  Didn't like this.   I agree with the previous writer, the Mayo and Beets... not a good thing.   Beets need a strong dressing ..  sweet and sour, sweet only ?    Not sure.    Roasted Beets are the best that one can do....  pull them, wash them, and roast in the oven, peel off the skins, offer salt peeper and butter............  and oh wow yummy...     Go back to the simple stuff...................

In defense of this recipe, mayonnaise with beets is an excellent combination for those of us who love it! This is delicious in our home and the only way my little ones would ever touch a beet. I never eat beats without mayo unless they are pickled. What makes this extra good is that these beets are fresh....yummy!
I leave off the seasoning since for me the mayo was just right.

This is the recipe my mom made too, but added some chopped celery.  She always used Miracle Whip with about a TBSP of sugar and dash of milk (instead of mayo).  Janet Ballantyne of Garden's Way suggested baking washed beets for about 1 1/2 hours (when you have something else in the oven anyway). Make sure to leave the skins & tap root on and leave 1 inch of stem.  Cool in cold water and the skins will slip off easily. Baking instead of boling results in less color and flavor loss.

I loved this recipe.  I grew up with a mother who cooked "Southern", using mayonnaise for a salad dressing, so it didn't taste foreign to the beets.  I used 1/2 vegetarian mayo and 1/2 Greek yogurt.  I think my 4 yr old DGD will love this pretty pink salad!

I disagree with previous raters...I do think beets and mayo go well together.  Since beets are sweet already, the mayo is a good contrast.  However, after I made it, my sister added a few chopped pickle and celery, and that was also a nice compliment!  I also have tried this with regular red beets and golden beets.  The parsley would probably be a good addition too!

I added some onion powder to taste. I'd give it 3.5 stars if the option was available. I appreciated having a beet recipe without vinegar for a change. Yum!

This was really good!  I used canola mayonnaise, which is what we use for mayonnaise normally.  Yum!!  Even my husband, who does not like beets at all (but will try anything I put in front of him) said that he probably won't eat much more of this batch, but he'd eat some again next time I make it.  That's a HUGE compliment to this recipe.  Thank you for sharing a beet recipe that does not use vinegar!

I hadn't thought of making a beet salad until I saw this one.  It's really good and very attractive.  I did add a diced sweet onion for a bit of sassiness and some crunch.  After reading some of the other reviews, I'm thinking I may also add some chopped celery.

I really enjoy this recipe for its freshness and lack of heavy ingredients. It's just so simple. After boiling the beets I chilled them in cooled water for about ten minutes which lifted the skin nicely and made peeling easier. After pealing, I put the beats through the julienne component on my food processor which cut the beets into nicely uniform pieces. Then I left the julienned beets in a bowl of ice water for about 15 minutes. This cooled them down and added a crisp professional texture.

This was a really great, simple recipe. It needs a little something extra, so I added apple cider vinegar and two more eggs. Thanks for sharing!

Mayo and beets make a terrible combination. And eggs, with beets? Terrible. We didn't care for this at all, and I will not be making it again.

I had a few fresh beets , and was looking for something different. 
Very easy recipe, and I can see the convenience of it
But I wasnt really sold on it, maybe I just was looking for MORE flavor
I might try it once again, but add a bit more to it, like green onions and maybe some other herbs to jazz it up
