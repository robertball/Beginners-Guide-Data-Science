We LOVED this salad! I made the dressing earlier in the day to allow the flavors to blend and ensure that the sugar was completely melted. Great combo of textures and flavors...I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wonderful salad, but I would use only half the dressing and double the amount of romaine.

Used slightly less fruit but was delicious. Did not have poppy seeds but dressing was still great.

Everyone loved this salad and wanted the recipe. I made the dressing the day before and used 9 oz of romaine. Will definitely make again.
