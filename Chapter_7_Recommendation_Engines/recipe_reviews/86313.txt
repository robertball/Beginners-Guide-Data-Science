This is a GREAT recipe. I omitted the liquid smoke (before reading other reviews) because I didn't have any on hand. After reading other reviews, it sounds like this was probably a good thing. I wouldn't change a thing (other than omit liquid smoke) about this recipe. These bites are so tasty, both hot and cold, that I could see using them in various ways at least a couple of times a week (I like tofu!).

This is one of my favorite ways to prepare tofu. I've made this recipe many times and find that baking it for a minumum of 45 minutes produces a more textured tofu.  I love the marinade as written and with a few variations, like adding powdered giger or honey instead of syrup, these little tofu bites are even more delicious!  The marinade really bakes into the tofu so don't plan on a saucy dish, I usually pair these with a saucy veggie stir fry and rice, yum! What a perfect dinner!

I have just put together this marinade and I really like it!  I did use half low sodium soy sauce and half regular soybean sauce.  Chopped garlic bits instead of powder.  Also, I started by putting in only a few drops of liquid smoke at a time and tasting to see my preference.  I think you need the liquid smoke.  Just in a smaller amount.  I used extra sesame seeds and they are the toasted.  When I put it in the oven, I am thinking of sifting a little cornstarch over the top, to give it a little crunch.  This will be great with some broccoli.  Thanks for an easy and yummy recipe!
***Update*** I am finding that there is no need for the cornstarch as the marinade cooks and clings to the tofu.  Sort of but not really in a crunchy way.  I also feel like the marinade loses some "punch" upon cooking.  The picture posted must have extra sauce used.  I would make this again, baking my tofu with the sesame seeds without the marinade.  I would take the marinade and bring it to a quick almost boil on the stove and pour it over the top of the tofu about half way through the cooking time.  Perhaps that would offer more flavor in the finished product.  It was however, good cold before I cooked it!

I usually follow the recipe exactly as written the first time. But after reading all the reviews, I did make a couple of minor changes. I pressed the sliced tofu between towels with a weight on top to dry it out. I really think this helps it absorb the marinade better. I left out the liquid smoke because I don't like the taste of it. I also added an extra tbl of maple syrup and sesame seeds and I subsituted 1 tbl of sesame oil for 1 tbl of the soy sauce. I wasn't sure why so many reviewers said that they didn't think this was enough sauce because it seemed to be plenty to cover that amount of tofu. But after baking, it did seem to bake off or thicken or something so that the tofu was just coated and the flavor baked in and no extra sauce. I did end up baking it for 45 minutes since 30 just didn't seem like enough. I think I will try 40 min next time though as a few pieces did start to burn on the bottom. Although it was ok warm. Hubby and I liked it best after it had been chilled. The flavor was subtle but delicious. And the texture was just right. We had a little as a snack and used the rest on a salad. I will definitely make this again but next time make a double batch since it disappeared so quickly!

I liked these. THey are nice and low cal. The marinade sounded strange, but is really quite tasty, however I omitted the hickory smoke flavor.  I feel it is really important that you dry out the tofu as much as you can before marinading them. This is easy to do by lining the sheetpan you are going to use to cook them with a folded towel (paper towels are not absorbent enough unless you use a lot of them) then place the tofu down and top with another folded tea towel. Place a cutting board ontop of this and finally top with a heavy frying pan or (I used my food processor, very heavy but effective) something with some heft. Let sit for at least 15 minutes, longer the better.  Then when they do go into the marinade, 5 minutes is not nearly long enough. I did it for an hour at room temp and found even that to still be a bit short. The longer you have the better it will penetrate and taste on the tofu. I will def make this again. Safe to leave out at room temp on the counter all day to snack. Once they are refrigerated they lose something, in my opinion.

I thought this was pretty good!  After reading reviews I doubled everything except the soy sauce, and I also omitted the liquid smoke (don't like it) and added 2 cloves minced garlic to the marinade.  Marinated for an hour, then plopped everything on a baking sheet and flipped/stirred it a few times while baking, so the extra marinade would coat the tofu and hopefully carmelize better than what other reviewers were suggesting.  Also, upped the temp to 400 degrees for the last five minutes to try to get it to dry out some more.  (Note:  Watch closely!  Burns easilty!) Made a mess of my baking sheet, but I did manage to get a few pieces with crispy edges, which is what I was shooting for.  Other than that, flavor and texture of tofu was excellent.  Went nicely with sesame broccoli.

These are so good!  I must confess that I ate the entire batch for a snack the other night.  Roasting the tofu is key here... the crispy edges are great.  I wasn't crazy about the idea of adding ketchup (it tastes fine, the idea just sounds strange) so I will try these with a different marinade next time-- maybe soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, honey, crushed red pepper, and garlic. Yum!

Really good, we will be making this again and again!  I am always sure to really take a lot of time squeezing off the excess water when I prepare tofu.  It really helps with the texture and also the tofu will soak up more of the marinade.  I let it sit of paper towels for 30-45 minutes with two three pound weights on top.  Also I cut out the liquid smoke, used chili oil instead of hot sauce, halved the amount of maple syrup, and halved the amount of soy sauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I think next time I'll either cut back the liquid smoke or omit it altogether. I found that flavour a bit overpowering. Thanks for the recipe!

Too much smoke flavor. 1/2 the soy sauce and double the sesame seeds.  My son loved these.  Would be great as an acompaniment to an Asian salad.

I just made these and they turned out great. This is my second time trying a tofu recipe, my first recipe was tofu parmiggiana and I did not care for that neither did my family, but after trying this recipe I am in love with tofu. I did the sauce a little differently, I couldn't find the vinegar, so i just used soy sauce, sesame oil (i couldn't find my sesame seeds either), syrup, ketchup, black pepper and garlic powder and a tbsp of hot sauce (i love spicy things) I made more sauce than the recipe calls for, after reading comments about how the sauce was baked on I decided to make some extra sauce, I marinated my tofu cubes and after placing them all on the baking pan I drizzled the extra sauce on them and baked at 375 degrees for 15 minutes, flipped them and then baked them for 15 more minutes. I used them in my salad and saved the leftovers for tomorrow. You have to try this !

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because the sauce needs to be doubled or even tripled. I marinated the tofu for about a half hour and after baking for about 15 minutes made another batch of the marinade and poured it on top, another span in the oven and  I added yet another batch of sauce. Good end result though, and I've never really been a fan of tofu.

It's delicious!  I hate eating tofu by itself so I made extra sauce to serve with rice or pasta.

Great recipe! I changed the marinade a bit (used green curry paste and sweet chile sauce instead of ketchup and hot sauce) and reduced the amount of smoke flavoring. The tofu bites were a great salad topping, my boyfriend couldn't get enough (and he usually doesn't like salad). I think it's a really good idea to bake the tofu instead of frying it: the tofu turns out crispy and has a very nice texture and it really soaks up the marinade. I also used baking parchment on my cookie sheet to make the cleanup easier. Thanks for the recipe, Vicky!

I make this at least twice a month.  My bf swore he wouldn't like tofu but he actually requests this!  I always double the sauce so that there's extra for the rice.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My family does not eat a lot of tofu dishes....but this one is wonderful. I wanted to make something besides meat for a change and this has been a regular dish for us for several years. I always use Bragg Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce (it cuts the sodium significantly). The taste is identical to soy.

This is a wonderfull recipe to use tofu in. I did make a few changes as I did not have sesame seeds so I used sesame seed oil. I also left out the liquid smoke. This is a keeper.

Marinading and baking does great things for the flavor and texture of the tofu. The recipe needs a bit of tweaking, though. This time when I made it, I left out the pepper (really hate it) and replaced the smoke and ketchup with bbq sauce. Om nom nom.  I like to saute up red cabbage and green beans in a sauce made of all the ingredients except the bbq sauce/ketchup and serve it with the tofu over rice.  Thanks for the good starter recipe!

By far the BEST tofu recipe. I could never get used to tofu taste, but this is is flavorful. I didn't have the sesame seeds, but I followed the rest of the recipe.

This was so tasty!  I cooked it for an extra long time so the pieces were super crunchy.  I also made sure the pieces were pretty small.

I didn't particularly LOVVVVE the sauce, but I loved the idea...so I've been experimenting with different sauces (peanut satay sauce is the BEST!)

I gave it a four for versatility. I'll DEF make baked tofu bites again, I'll just use a different sauce!

I am very big into following recipes the first time to the letter before making substitutions.  Unfortunately I will admit that I didn't have any hot sauce in my house but I used a little bit of Wasabe Paste, and it worked BEAUTIFULLY!!!!  I think that the purpose of the liquid smoke for this recipe is to give it a grilled flavor but not have it break apart on a grill.  Yes it was a little salty but it tastes great and was great as leftovers as well.

Tasty recipe.  I was skeptical about the 5-min marinating time and should have trusted my instincts, though.  Next time I make it will marinate much longer!

I didn't use the liquid smoke due to the reviews.  It tastes good, both hot and cold, that I could see using them in various ways.  It is a good introduction to anyone who hasn't eaten the tofu.

Great on top of rice. Doubled the sauce to serve on rice but didn't need to. It's a tad salty.

Made this today...very good,but didn't crisp up too much for me. Had oven at 400 degrees and drained tofu for 4hrs. BUT the marinade made just like it said, no deviations was FANTASTIC. Will use it again. Will also make this again. Oh, didn't have sesame seeds so will get some for the next time. Liquid smoke was good too,just used a dash of it per other reviews..so I guess I did deviate.:)

I too was hoping the texture would be a little different. I'll give this another try, but I'm going to stir fry the tofu first until it's crispy, then add the sauce in until it thickens. I'll also add fresh garlic and more hot sauce.

I've made this twice.  Once according to the recipe and a second time using some suggestions from other reviews and I wasn't impressed either time.  My husband and I both prefer the taste of tofu when it cooks in a frying pan with a stirfry.  Baking them dries it out and tastes like cubes of salt.

I was making this tonight and kept thinking that I've smelled that exact sauce before, but where? I added a few more spices because I like tons of spice. I added a 1/2 tbsp of A1 steak sauce, I used rice vinegar and only 1/2 the recommended liquid smoke. I added a dash of paprika, 5 spice, cumin, curry, and onion powder. It was very good over steamed white rice. I did in fact make 3 times the sauce because the recipe doesn't call for enough. I drizzled some on the tofu about half way through baking and a little on top after serving on the rice.
I figured out where I've seen this recipe before. It's a beef jerky recipe. Try it and marinade the jerky over night. Put it in a smoker or use a dehydrator. Very yummy stuff, as is this tofu jerky!!

I actually really enjoyed these. I made these because I had a package of tofu that was at it's best by date, and my mother had been skeptical I'd ever use the tofu *she told me "good luck", in reference to how she has bought two packages in her life and ended up throwing both away*. So yeah. THey're reeaallly good. THey didn't really get crispy (unless burning counts?lol), but I had to modify the ingredients due to no vinegar or sesame seeds, etc.. I did add ginger flavoring.  I plan to make these again, but I will Definitely increase the marinating time!  I really like them with ketchup..  But then again I am a teenager, lol.. Really good recipe, I will definitely make again.

I liked this recipe. I baked my tofu twice as long hoping to get it a little crispier. I served with blanched broccoli dressed with olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes. Very filling meal.

These were great!  I didn't have any liquid smoke, so did not add it.  Next time I will add at least a teaspoon of sriracha sauce, but that's based on my own preference.  I have never gotten baked tofu to turn out before but this did it.  I drained my tofu overnight between 2 hand towels with a brick on top and marinated it for 3 hours.  Next time I will do a larger batch and marinate it overnight for even more flavor.

With tofu baking it really is your best bet.  Well done cubes are awesome as a snack food. I like to make oriental food with vegetables only, then offer a choice of prepared-ahead meats (ie: deep fried pork, cubed broiled chicken, plain boiled shrimp) and then these tofu cubes. Season them like you would curly fries or

These were ok.  Decent flavor.  To get all the water out of the tofu, I put it on a plate with layers of paper towels above and below the tofu.  I then place another plate on top, with a 28-oz can from my pantry set on top to weigh it down.  I usually set it in the frig overnight for maximum drainage, and change out the paper towels as they soak up the water.  Anyway, the tofu bites were good, but not great.  I think just soaking them in BBQ sauce would achieve the same thing.

Yum! I baked the tofu without the sauce for about 20 minutes rather than marinating it, which helped it drain and made it soak up the sauce better. I also used a smoky hot sauce rather than the liquid smoke. New fav!

This is one of my go-to recipes, whether I'm cooking for vegans, vegetarians or non-vegetarians. Regardless of whether or not they are usually fans of tofu, They have all uniformly loved it, and most people ask for the recipe. I omit the liquid smoke, and serve it with southern-style sides as an alternative to barbecue, or I let it cool and serve it on top of salads with mandarin oranges, walnuts and avocado. This dish is fantastic!

This recipe sounded great and after reading some reviews I decided to use honey and a dash of ginger rather than maple syrup, and I think that was a bad idea.  I think the syrup would have lended a flavor and sweetness that was lost on the honey.  Leaving it out made this dish too salty and bland for me.  I ended up using a little syrup to dip the bites in, which helped a little.  I might try this again but will cut down on the soy sauce and add more maple syrup than called for.  Otherwise, this cooked up well and had a nice chewy texure on the outside which I liked.  Also, to get the moisture out of my tofu I used the method of putting the whole block in a colander with a small dish on top and a heavy object to weigh it down, for about 15mins.  This worked out just fine.

I followed the recipe exactly, and added some fresh ginger. I thought it was delicious! I was skeptical because before cooked, the sauce smells gross and unappetizing. Once cooked, it smells delicious!

I served this over rice. When I took it out of the oven, all the sauce had absorbed into the tofu, so it was "dry" but flavorful. I will certainly make this again!

I really wanted to like this as I am trying to eat healthier, however, I was not too impressed. Could be that I don'tt eat a lot of tofu.
It didn't seem to get crispy at all.  I cooked it longer and still pretty mushy.
I gave some to my kids without telling them what it was and my daughter  ran to the trash can to spit it out.
I did end up dipping it in some hot mustard, and it tasted better then.
I will keep trying to find a tofu recipe that the family will like.
Thanks for submitting it, though.

This is my favorite way to make baked tofu. You can alter how cruncy/chewy it is by adjusting the time. This is definitely the fastest and easiest way to make tofu that is great for lunches by itself or in sandwiches.

I would love to try these in another flavor. The oriental flavor was good, but a little overpowering the more pieces I ate.

Baked Tofu Bites Haiku: "Ohhhh dude, this is YUM. Pressed the liquid for longer. (No sesame seeds.)" Didn't have sesame seeds, so used 1/2 tsp. sesame oil; I know it's not a proper substitution, but it's such a strong flavor that I figured it'd jive well w/ the soy sauce. I put my tofu (prior to cutting into 1/2" cubes) on a paper-towel lined plate, put another paper towel on top, followed by a plate, then a couple of canned goods to press out more liquid; left there for about 30 min. Maybe the tofu being "drier" let the marinate stick better, but irregardless, I marinated it for 2 hrs., then followed the baking instructions, but left in an extra 10-15 min. Tasted awesome over a salad, and the leftovers the next day were just as good.

I thought this recipe was wonderful and I followed it *almost* to the T. The only changes I made are that I left out the liquid smoke, because I didn't have any, I baked it for 40 minutes instead of 30, and used reduced sodium soy sauce instead of regular. That being said, I found the dish to be VERY salty.  Next time I make it (there will be a next time) I will use only 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Also, be sure that you dry your tofu very well before you soak it in the marinade. (I went through several kitchen towels) Also, if time allows, let your marinade soak a little longer. It will still taste great if you cannot, but the flavors will intensify, even if it sits for only 15 minutes or so.  Give it a try, you'll be pleased!

Delish!  Made a couple of minor changes - I used honey instead of maple syrup since it's less expensive.  Also, I used several generous sloshes of hot sauce, plus a couple sprinkles of hot sauce with chipotles (to replace the liquid smoke), about 2 tsp of garlic powder, and a few shakes of paprika and cayenne (we keep it spicy around here!).  Marinated for about a half hour.  Baked it for 20 minutes on 375, flipped the pieces, but then BROILED it for the second 20 minutes, in order to make it a little crispy on top.  Yummy, and fiance raved about it.  Will definitely be making again!  Thanks, Vicky9999!

This recipe is only about 3-4 stars as is...it is FAR TOO SALTY! I've made it twice now, and the second time I used less soy sauce and some water to cut down on the salt and it was much better. Overall, it is easy and tasty if you can cut down on the salt. Good served with rice or noodles.

This was pretty good.  I did not have maple syrup, so subbed it for honey.  I always squeeze out the water for at least an hour.  I marinated this for about 3-4 hours.  I baked it for 30 minutes, turning it halfway through.  Then I drizzled the rest of the sauce on the tofu and baked it for another 5 minutes.  I sprinkled more toasted sesame seeds on the tofu in the serving bowl (a lot of the seeds were lost on the baking sheet!)  My husband thought it was 2 stars due to lack of sauce,  but I thought it was 4, so average of 3.  It's pretty good, but I think I will make more sauce and heat it up on the side.

After reading the reviews, I omitted the liquid smoke. I used BBQ sauce as the base instead of soy sauce and used agave nectar instead of syrup. I'm not a big ketchup person so I left it out. If I could have gotten it a bit crunchy I would have given it 5 stars. Great snack and even better with stir fried veggies.

I used low sodium soy sauce and still found this recipe to be WAAAAAAAY too salty......also....the cooking time should be adjusted....or watched very carefully.  The sugar in the maple syrup over carmelized and almost tasted burnt!  Wasn't inedible but I probably won't make it again!

These were really tasty. I used fresh minced garlic and honey instead of maple syrup because I didn't have any on hand. I also omitted the liquid smoke and added some brown sugar so it caramelized a little and was crispy and delicious. I added just a touch more hot sauce and these had great flavor and kick!

Great recipe! I tweaked my bites a bit by omitting the liquid smoke and maple syrup. I baked mine with some broccoli, yum! I added ginger and A Taste of Thai brand sweet chili sauce instead. The sweet chili sauce has the consistency of syrup and it's spicy so it kills two birds with one stone! I baked my bites at 350 for 30 mins and it really improved the texture of the tofu. I served the bites over organic brown jasmine rice. I'll me making this one again. Thanks!

Yum!  This one was very good.  I added everything except for the liquid smoke.  Tasted good hot or cold.  I lined the pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking.  The sauce that wasn't on the tofu burned and scorched, so make sure to line it properly or else you'll have a terrible mess to clean up.

I don't care what the rest of the reviews say... trust me, and follow the recipe to a tee!  It is AWESOME!!!  I make this all the time, and I LOVE it! I recomend using Heinz organic ketchup (healthier ingredients, same consistency) and pure maple syrup (other maple syrup is basically corn syrup and sugar... not good).  I wouldn't recommend using lite or sugar free syrup... it makes the marinade watery.  Enjoy this tofu, it's SOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!  And DON'T be afraid of the smoke sauce, YUM!

We thought this was better without the liquid smoke. The second time around I added 1 T. of sesame oil and 1 T. Thai chili sauce, which combines sweet with hot... Yum! My two teenagers loved tofu this way. I served it with stir-fried veggies and jasmine rice... it made a really nice meal.

For the tofu lovers!  This dish is very yummy and has a very nice presentation.  The tofu is very tasty and tender.  I made a small change.  I sauteed the tofu in a single layer in a skillet, with a tbsp of olive oil to add a little more consistency to it.  Which turned out great.

I halved the recipe and added only a few drops of liquid smoke. I had to bake them longer than 30 minutes, probably around 45-60 but they need to get chewy/crispy on the outside for them to be really good. Good flavor, easy way to use up tofu.

I enjoyed this, even though I messed up and didn't have time to bake it slowly as directed.  I only used 1 TBS of regular (Ms Butterworth's) syrup...and SEVERAL dashes of hot sauce (Cholula hot sauce...it's not as hot as tabasco)

very tasty

Great recipe, but leave out the smoke flavoring, add 5-6 dashes hot sauce (if you like things spicy), and use 1-2 fresh grated garlic cloves instead of powder, and lots more sesame seeds! My little ones won't eat it, but my picky teenagers both loved it! We serve it with sweet chili sauce, yummm!  Great recipe for our family who's trying to go vegan! With the changes I made it's Five star for us!

I was so excited to try these, and followed the recipe exactly, but they came out all mushy and ketchup-y. Normally I like tofu, but this did not appeal to me at all. My boyfriend and I renamed it "squiggly wiggly tofu with ketchup".

My daughter is a vegetarian so sometimes the creative ideas for dinner "run thin".  Tonight I made the tofu bites and she, along with other family members, adored them!  I didn't have liquid smoke so I substituted one teaspoon of Worchester Sauce; I also doubled the Tabasco; and finally, replaced the garlic powder with three-fourths tablespoon of fresh minced garlic.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Just tried this recipe.  Of course I made substitutions.  I used Nigari tofu, low sodium soy sauce, red wine vinegar.  I  sliced my tofu 1/4" thick and each slice in quarters.  I marinated the slices for 30 minutes in a sealed container turning it every 5 minutes to make sure every thing was evenly marinated.  I thought the flavor was just right, with the changes I made and will use this recipe again and again.  Thank You Vicky9999 for a great recipe.

Pretty tasty.  I followed the recipe with a few substitutions.  Tamari instead of regular soy sauce, rice wine vinegar instead of regular, fresh chopped garlic instead of powder.  I also left out the liquid smoke, I just didn't think I would like that.  It tasted very good.  I marinated about 20 minutes, perhaps longer would be better as the sauce lost some of it's potency during cooking.

They were okay, but much too salty.  I had to eat them with a salad, which wasn't too bad.  I probably won't make this recipe again.

I didn't use the smoke flavor as the other reviewers suggested and they turned out great. I actually used chile and onion flavored tofu, which added a great extra flavor. 
I also didn't have the sesame seeds, but I'm sure they would have added a great extra flavor. 
They're super yummy, eat up!

Susbstitute hoisin sauce for ketchup, leave out the smoke sauce, use 2 cloves crushed garlic instead of garlic pepper, add 2 T sweet chili sauce instead of hot sauce.

Very nice.

This was great! I followed the recipe but didn't add the liquid smoke as others suggested. A perfect amount of saltiness and sweetness. I gently squeezed firm tofu with paper towel, and then wrapped it with a few layers before placing in the fridge for a couple of hours. Next time I may make extra sauce with some corn starch as a glaze.

This was a very good recipe.  I omitted liquid smoke like many others.  I didn't have maple syrup so I substituted 1 tablespoon each of honey and molasses.  I also marinated an hour+.  This recipe was quick and easy so I will definitely make again.

Yum! I had a hard time keeping the tofu together, but the final product was a great mixture of sweet and savory. The softness and the crispy outside was also a great touch. I didn't have any liquid smoke and I don't like sesame seeds so I did without both and it turned out great! I'll be making these tofu bites again.

I love this recipe. It's the only way I can eat tofu. The texture is perfect for me because it's not mushy on the inside like most tofu. I don't change anything and I find the liquid smoke is a requirement while others disagree. 
While it cooks, I make another batch of sauce and cook it down on the stove so it starts to thicken like a BBQ sauce. When it's done I just toss the tofu with the thickened sauce. This recipe can win over any tofu hater like me.

I am having a hard time even giving this two stars. I followed the pattern, except I reduced the amount of soy sauce by half based on everyone else's comments. It was still waaaaaay too salty! Even if it hadn't been salty, I still think it would have not been good. I will NOT make this again!

I should note that I let it marinade for a few hours. Maybe if I had only marinated it for five minutes, it might have absorbed less salt. The recipe says to marinate for at least five minutes, maybe it should say for no more than five minutes? Still, I don't think I'll try this again.

I pretty much doubled the sauce as suggested, pressed the tofu between two towels, weighted the sheet on top with 5# flour & 5# sugar for about an hour, marinated for at an hour or a bit more.  I baked it, but it didn't get crispy - even after more than twice the recommended time.  'Thought it was a little too sweet.  I only put in 1/4t liquid smoke for a double recipe.  Too much of that is too much.  So, eh, I'm glad I tried it; but if I want crispy tofu, I'll try stirfrying it next time.

I liked this.  I did not take it out of the oven as quickly as the recipe indicated, because it just looked spongy still and I wanted a firmer texture.  It ended up staying "in" for a good hour all together, with me turning it over every 15 minutes or so.  Pefect little snacky bites...

What a great idea!  I have made these 2 times so far.  They are the perfect snack, but also make a great appetizer! There are little things you can do to this recipe like add in some fresh ginger, but made as written, it is very good!

Wow - this was great!

I used Tamari instead of Soy Sauce, and I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder (it's all I had).

I only needed to bake it for about 5 more minutes after flipping them over.

And after they were done baking, I tossed them in a bowl with the left over marinade.

So so so good.

I make this ALL the time! I make a little extra then marinate some broccoli and other veggies in the sauce and put them all in the oven and serve it on a bed of rice…quick and FABULOUS! Adjustments: I haven’t ever used the liquid smoke or hot sauce, I usually add a little onion powder and I tend to have to bake it longer than 15 minutes (usually 20) but I prefer a crispier outside.

solid 4 stars. found that marinating it for 4 hours was ok...more would have been better. 
reserved the extra marinade, and am going to drizzle on top of the tofu and rice just before eating...yum!

I eat mostly vegetarian, but unless I have deep-fried my tofu, I have found it almost intolerable. This recipe, however, made me want more! It came out with a very meaty texture and not soft, wet and mushy. The longer you can drain it, the better. I did maybe 10-15 minutes, which meant I had to leave it in the oven longer to dry it out more and give it a better texture. I had it over white rice with soy sauce, red pepper flakes, pineapple chunks and scallions and it was excellent!

This was very tasty.  I didn't use smoke flavor, because I didn't like it, but I roasted the sesame seeds and it was perfect.

I've been eating and cooking tofu for 15+ years and this recipe was a dud.  The sauce was super salty with the use of tamari sauce.  Like other reviewers I made extra sauce and the end result was still pretty dry.    I think it would have been better to press the tofu and broil it in slices with a good commercial barbecue sauce.  I was very disappointed.

This has quickly become my new favorite way to make tofu--and I have a lot of great tofu recipes. I made a few small changes. I used only 3 tbsp. soy sauce (reduced-sodium tamari) and 1 tbsp. water instead of 1/4c soy sauce. And I never use sesame seeds. Oh, and I bake it at 350 degrees, not 375. I think lowering the soy sauce and baking at the lower temp. eliminate the salty/burning problem others had. Also, I marinate overnight and use light tofu-- which comes out soft right after baking but when it cools it gets really firm. I usually end up eating it cold. The flavor is just excellent--smoky barbecue goodness.

My carnivore hubby declared it "ok" but my 10 year old son and I ate the whole batch in a few minutes as a snack. Definitely make a double batch, because it is a little trouble, for a small quantity. I froze the tofu, then thawed and pressed it. Mine came out crispy with a chicken-y texture. Would make a good sub for grilled chicken in an asian salad.

Very good.  I did not add the vinegar or liquid smoke.  I added some powdered ginger.  I might try freezing the tofu next time to see if I like the texture better that way.  I will make this again.

Really delicious! Like other reviewers, I recommend marinating the tofu for hours rather than minutes (I let it sit overnight). I also used honey because I didn't have maple syrup, left out the liquid smoke, and it was still good. This only lasted 2 days in my house because it was so yummy!

Measured the marinade ingredients exactly as original recipe.  Was worried about the liquid smoke, but it really added nice flavor.  Purchased pre cubed tofu, all I needed to do was gently press it.  Put all ingredients in a ziplock bag and let sit for 5+ minutes, turning occasionally.  Funny, but to me it had a slight hot dog flavor (Which I miss!).

I love this recipe!!  I have been searching for a way to make a baked tofu that tastes good.  Thank you:)  I didn't have liquid smoke or garlic powder, so I left the smoke out and used minced fresh garlic instead.

I was in a hurry to get these in the oven last night so I didn't read the helpful reviews that said to double most of the ingredients.  Still, these little bites turned out tasty--dare I say slightly better cold the next day?  They taste like bbq chicken (to me), and I will definitely make again, changing only the amount of marinade, and increase the marinade time to really get the full flavor.  Thanks for a good, easy recipe!

The recipe turned out great. I added a little sesame oil to the marinade, left out the hot sauce, and added half of the ketchup. I was afraid it would taste more BBQ flavor than Asian. I baked for almost an hour and tossed them with fried rice. I will definately make these again.

I was really surprised because I found these kind of bland as far as "kick" goes but overly salty. I normally just toss the tofu in some BBQ sauce of some variety and some honey and drizzle extra honey on top in between flips in the oven. Considering that is so simple I wanted to try something new. This recipe sounded great but I really did not care for the flavor. I will experiment with the ingredients as I always do and see if I can come up with a variation that I prefer more.

I could not get these crispy.  If you think they will be like cheesey-type poppers, they are not.  They taste like hot tofu soaked in BBQ sauce.  OK.  Maybe better luck next time!

Not bad, but REALLY salty (and man, I LOVE salt). I will remake with more maple syrup and low sodium soy sauce...  * I should note that I boiled off some of the marinade's water and tossed the cubes in there after cooking. This gave me the "look" achieved in the picture. However, it also gave me a super salty product. I would have given this 3 stars, but as I strayed a bit, I gave this 4.

I think maybe the flavorings are a regional thing - cause my husband & I were not accustomed to these flavors and found them rather not to our liking. We took only a few bites.  Made exactly as directed except mixed up a second batch or sauce because the first didn't seem to be enough.

I have never been able to prepare edible tofu before, so I'm happy with this recipe.  This is delicious!    The only thing I did differently was that I froze the tofu for a couple days before I used it.  I had read that freezing changes the texture to more meatlike.  Next time I will take the tofu out of the water b4 freezing and will slice it b4 freezing.    After I froze and defrosted it, I pressed on it to get rid of water.  i then applied the marinade.   Today some of my pieces were little squares, but I also loved the crumbled pieces that broke off.  I have been using Morningstar Crumbles and love that so I was thinking this might be similar.  The flavor is different, but equally delicious.

This was great!  i followed other people's advice, and made sure I pressed the tofu between two towels for 20 minutes or so.  And then I let it marinate for several hours (didn't count how long, but just put in the fridge and let it marinate until I was ready to cook dinner).  It was plenty flavorful.  Thanks!

This was decent....but not the best baked tofu recipe I've made.  If I make it again, I'll double the sauce...mine came out a bit dry.  I ended up stir-frying it with with other sauce and veggies.  Decent flavor though.  Kids liked it...that's always good!

I tried this recipes twice - once following the recipe, and it turned out OK, the second time I changed up the recipe and it turned out DELICIOUS, almost the best tofu I ever had.  I left out the ketchup, liquid smoke, and garlic powder - I sliced up two cloves of garlic to put in the marinade instead.  I put in about half the amount of maple syrup and put in the other half brown sugar.  I reduced the amount of vinegar (about half?), and added some basil (about 3/4 tsp), about a 1/8tsp powdered ginger, and some red pepper flakes.  Then baked them for at least 50min.  SO GOOD!  I rated the recipe three stars cause I felt I had to change so much to get them to taste five stars.

Not sure what I expected...maybe something more *Asian* tasting...but I didn't much care for the *marinade* combo...I followed the recipe as written with just a little bit less Liquid Smoke... ...and it came out somehow *bitter* tasting...and not crisp at all....and ...bland?!  ...not a good flavor to my taste buds won't try this this one again...  Additionally, having all the sugary ketchup and syrup and the high sodium soy sauce in the marinade,  I wouldn't call it *Low Cal* or *Healthy* as some previous raters described this recipe... :-/

Really enjoyed this, hot with steamed vegetables and cold in salads, and will definitely make it again and again. I tweaked the recipe only because I wanted to use what I had on hand. I substituted honey for maple syrup and a chopped clove of garlic for garlic power, and I left out the smoke seasoning. I will try it with maple syrup--sounds delicious.

This was a really good quick and easy recipe.  I didn't know what to make for dinner, just knew I had some tofu I wanted to use up.  I had all of these ingredients on hand, so I decided to try it out.  Went really well with corn, baked beans and cauliflower cream.

I made this as part of a vegetarian meal the other night, and my partner raved about it! I've been searching for something to do with Tofu besides just using it in stir fry and Berber Stew and this was perfect. I'll be making this quite a bit I think.

I have the dish right in front of me right now.  Followed the instructions to the letter.  Im not sure how this recipe gets a high rating.

The liquid smoke adds to the smell, not so much to the flavor.

I was rather disappointed in it.
Its not absolutely horrid.  Its edible.  The taste flavor of the combine ingredients sweetened up the tofu.

Combined with the rest of the ingredients, gave it a flavor (takes another bite) thats unique.  

The sesame seeds gave it a little extra crunch, but couldnt save how not so good this recipe is.

Its a little sour due to the vinegar.
(takes another bite)

Ok Im done, i cant eat anymore.  Its going straight to fido.

I was pretty disappointed at how this turned out. But, after they came out of the oven I didn't like the flavor so I mixed them in a little more maple syrup. I forgot about it until the next day and tried it again. The tofu was def. better the next day.

One of the best tofu recipes I've tried. The key is to squeeze the excess water out of the tofu, giving the marinade a chance to soak in.I also omitted the liquid smoke as I didn't think I had any on hand. I marinated the tofu bites for 30 minutes and cooked them for an hour. I doubled the recipe for the marinade and used the remaining liquid as a base for a stir-fry sauce for rice noodles combined with grated carrots. I added grated peeled cucumber at the end of cooking. It was a hit with both of my kids and my husband. My son is one of the pickiest eaters in the world so I'll definitely being using this recipe again! I'll probably try adding a few drops of liquid smoke next time.

These were great after I refridgerated the final product.  I used light maple syrup because that's all I had and the taste was still good (the sauce was just a little thin).  And since I didn't have sesame seeds I used a teaspoon of sesame oil for taste.  It worked!  I also followed the recommendations to leave out the liquid smoke.  Pretty good hot, and better cold!  My roomie and friends couldn't get enough!

Loved this recipe - following the advice of others I left out the liquid smoke.  I also left out the hot sauce and changed the garlic powder to a clove of garlic.  Thinking of changing the ketchup to BBQ sauce next time.  Thanks for the recipe - delicious!!!! :)

These were great!  I omitted the liquid smoke and served them over brown rice.  I gave them to my toddler and he ate them up!  I stirred the leftovers into some Mac N' Cheese the next day, total comfort food!

I loved this dish!  As a girl trying to find enjoyment in food again after an eating disorder, this is something I love to eat.  It is so tasty because the "barbecue sauce" gets so nice and caramelized on the little bites of tofu.  So good with brown rice and mixed vegetables!  Mmmmm...

We're tofu lovers and this was tasty.  Like many others, I doubled the sauce.  The sauce did burn a bit.  Next time I think I'll cook at a lower heat.

I really enjoyed these.  I used closer to 1/4 cup ketchup, balsamic vinegar, and doubled the garlic and pepper.  I also omitted the smoke flavoring because I did not have any.  Make sure to grease the pan well, also any extra marinade will burn onto the pan (not a big deal, but just some extra clean up).  The second time I made these I baked them for 10 minutes extra, and they were a much better texture!

Well, I was all set to give this recipe three stars--decent flavor, but a little too intense for my taste--but my two-year-old LOVED this stuff. That's worth another star all by itself.  Next time I will leave out the liquid smoke and add an extra Tbsp. of maple syrup to balance the soy sauce better.  I also had to roast these about 10 minutes longer than suggested to get a good texture on the outside.  Will make this again and again, playing with the marinade each time probably.

good flavor, but my boyfriend and i agreed: a bit too salty. maybe it needs something like honey or sugar to take some of the soy sauce zing out?

I was excited to try this recipe. I loved the sesame seeds.  However, I halved the marinade and it was still too much.  It was saltier than I wanted, but I'm notorious for my salt aversion.  I  think I would prefer a ginger based marinade to this soy based marinade.

So easy, healthy and delicious! What can be better? I followed the other reviewers advice and left out the liquid smoke thingy but I also improvised because I didn't have some of the ingredients. Instead of ketchup, I used the same amount of jar pasta sauce, a drizzle of sesame oil and a sprinkling of black sesame seeds in addition to the white ones. I will definitely repeat this again but I was just wondering, is it supposed to turn out a bit crunchy? Mine turned out not crunchy but I think that might be due to me piling up the marinated tofu on the baking sheet instead of carefully arranging them in a single layer...

These are really good - I find it help to freeze the tofu, let it thaw, "squeeze" out as much excess water as possible and marinate the cubes until the entire marinade is absorbed. I also recommend baking them about 1/2 hour. Very tasty.

I was really excited about this recipe but after tasting it I was not pleased with the results.  I love tofu, I eat it plain, in burgers, and all kinds of other things... but I won't make this again.  I followed the recipe exactly, omitting only the smoked flavor.  No doubt some people here do like the flavor... I really did try to like it.

I also left out the liquid smoke and I think it was a good decision.  I also let the tofu marinate for about 15 minutes, since I felt 5 minutes wasn't enough.  Next time I'll probably marinate it even longer.

It was great! A few adjustments: I had no vinegar so I used mirin (not the same at all but I figured why not try), used both Sriracha and chili flake in oil as the hot sauce, and finally added my own twist by putting a dash of sesame oil and a healthy helping of chili oil in there. Warms you from your stomach up and I didn't miss the liquid smoke at all!

I love this recipe!  As a relatively new vegetarian I've been searching for a recipe with tofu that I will want to make over and over again.  This is it.  I was out of maple syrup so I used honey and a bit of maple flavouring.  Served it with roasted veg  -  since the oven was already on  -  a good use of electricity, too.

I was so skeptical but it was delicious. I used liquid aminos instead of soy to cut down on the sodium content and did not use the liquid smoke. Will definitely make it again!

For me this gets five stars for the best way to cook tofu.  I like to press the liquid out, cut into cubes and then let it marinate for an hour before baking which really pulls the flavor inside. I've done a dozen different variations on the marinade based on what I'm serving it with or what I have on hand, but I always add the liquid smoke!

Really tasty...The only change I made was instead of liquid smoke which I did not have, I added a good squirt of BBQ sauce which added the sweet/smokiness I crave.  Marinated for about five hours at room temperature, baked 1/2 hour, served room temperature.  Delicious!

I didn't have any regular vinegar on hand, but I did have balsamic raspberry vinegar, and it makes it taste slightly sweet and tart. I also only used 4-5 drops of smoke flavour, and halved the soy sauce. It's DELICIOUS! Really, try the raspberry vinegar if you can. It adds a lot!

Great!    They are kind of a lot of trouble to make for one person, though.  Family won't eat tofu.

Love the texture and love the recipe.  Next time I think I will try to marinate it in a ziplock bag so that all the pieces are in the marinade.  Also, someone suggested baking it for 45 minutes and mine burned a little.  Definitely will make again. Thanks for sharing

YUM !!!!  I used minced garlic instead of powder and I didn't have hot sauce.  Doubled the sesame for extra crunch.  I used the bottom rack of the oven and the sauce around the edges burned. I suggest keeping the sauce corralled by the tofu, that way the sauce thickens nicely.  My hubby is a BBQ guy, not a big tofu guy,  He loved the smokey flavor.

I left out the hot sauce, sesame seeds and smoke flavouring. I'm pretty sure I used way more tofu than called for (mine comes in 500g blocks) but there was a ton of sauce still in the bowl. As many other reviewers mentioned the longer the tofu soaks in the sauce the better. For this reason I don't preheat the oven until the pieces have been soaking for ten minutes.

Amazing! I cut the cubes smaller, marinated for and hour, and cooked for 30 minutes. I also tripled the sauce and reduced it to have extra for my rice and veggies.

Really great, and so easy. I made it for a 'grazing' dish so that I would have something healthy and tasty when passing the refrigerator in the night :-)  It's best cold, and it was really good for dinner served with Sesame noodles (tons of recipes for this on this site). It's worth buying the Liquid Smoke- even if this is the only recipe that calls for it.  You will make this again after tasting it.

This was great! I cut liquid smoke to 4-5 drops and used sushi vinegar  because it's what I had on hand. 

Look for maple syrup and sesame seeds in the bulk area of your healthy grocer. You can buy as much as you need instead of the expensive pre-packaged containets at big box stores.

I've made this 3 or 4 times now. I've followed the recipe exactly regarding ingredients, except no black pepper.  I like this better the second day because it allows the vinegar edge to mellow.  I serve with stir fry or steamed veggies and rice.  Also, I think it tastes better to cook it for 35 minutes. It gives it a dryer texture, which I like.  I would like to try to find a way to make the tofu even more spongy-ish, but I'm still working on that.

I loved the recipe. It is so amazingly simple and delicious. Instead of adding sesame seeds, I added hemp seeds just because I didn't have sesame seed. Also I baked tofu for a total of 40 minutes.

I am still learning to cook with tofu and found this recipe very tasty. Note – use parchment paper.  It’ll save a lot of time on clean up!  I did make some changes with the recipe out of necessity because I didn’t have the ingredient.  I used extra firm tofu so there wasn’t much excess water.   I used a low-sodium soy sauce, honey (instead of maple syrup).  I also didn’t have liquid smoke on hand however would like to try the recipe with it.  Liquid smoke has an intense flavor so be careful when using it. Add a little at a time. When I make this recipe again, I’ll marinate for the 1 hour as suggested by other reviews.

I had to use what I had on hand so there were no sesame seeds or smoke flavoring and the vinegar I used was Trader Joe's orange muscat champagne vinegar and this recipe totally rocked! I also did not put in any hot sauce, I don't like things "too" spicy. I marinated for longer than 5 minutes, about 20, but think I would marinate for an hour next time. when I turned the tofu after 15 minutes I also drizzled some of the extra marinade on and it was awesome!

This is a really good recipe.  We eat this at least once a week, and my daughter eats leftovers at room temperature for school lunch. I think you need the liquid smoke flavoring, as it gives the dish more depth, but if you are squeamish, you could just omit it.  It doesn't taste as good without it, though, as I found out when I ran out of it.  Give it a try, and I think this recipe will be in heavy rotation at your house, especially if you have one or more vegetarians with you.

Loosely followed the recipe, making one lower calorie substitution. 5th time making this dish. Typically begin by draining and pressing the tofu. Then created 1/2" slices and pressed again. Ultimately cut into triangles. When making the marinate, I swapped maple syrup for sugar free syrup. Also added a pinch of ground ginger. Omitted the liquid smoke and sesame seeds as none we on hand. Allowed to marinade for 20min, stirring every so often to Cooked at 425* for a crisper texture. Served with roasted mixed root vegetables.

I am generally not a big TOFU fan nor is anyone in my household but this was delicious. I didn't bake the tofu but stir fried it instead. I used half the amount of liquid smoke after reading other comments and marinated the tofu for half an hour. Then in a frying pan with a bit of oil, on a low heat, I placed the tofu with the marinade, letting all the liquid absorb until the tofu turned brown and a bit crunchy. I mixed it with a bowl of orzo pasta. It was full of flavour and I am going to attempt to serve it to my family in place of chicken. The marinade made it!

I liked them better cold than warm.  I put them on peanut noodles for a cold lunch to bring with me, and that was good.  Super easy to make too.  If you want them even better, I suggest pressing the tofu under something heavy with some paper towels or something overnight to get a lot more water out of them.

I'm always looking for way to fix tofu that appeals to my meat eating friends and this just moved to the top of. The list. Two comments: I used a high quality hickory flavored salt, fresh garlic, and added fresh ginger.  I also noticed that at the baking time at the top of the recipe is 15 minutes.  However, further down we are instructed to bake for 15 minutes, flip the tofu, and bake for another 15.  Not optimal unless you are trying for popcorn tofu!  Great addition to salads, as a main corse, appetizer, or high protein snack.

I made this without the liquid smoke flavoring OR the sesame seeds, so I probably don't have the most ideal basis for judgement. However it was pretty good, and I would potentially make it again. 
As another reviewer has said, they're probably better if you bake each side for 20 minutes rather than the suggested 15.

Quick and convenient, nice flavor. We included these in a rice bowl with stir-fried vegetables. I found it neither too salty nor too sweet, I used a lower-sodium soy sauce and a natural ketchup that is low-sugar so perhaps that made a difference. I used black sesame seeds and, because I was a bit nervous about the liquid smoke after reading the reviews, only half a tsp. I didn't find the smokey taste overpowering at all and wouldn't hesitate to try the full amount next time. I marinated for 15 minutes and baked these on the middle rack of the oven which I think helped with browning.

I added it to vegetable fried rice and my hubby LOVED it! Nice texture, great caramelization. I added 1 tsp. sriracha sauce to the marinade because we love spicy. I went out and bought 2 more pkgs of tofu so we can make it again soon.

It is really good. Taking out the moisture is critical. I wrap it in a dish towel and set an iron skillet on it for an hour.

I was very pleasantly surprised with this one. I had never cooked with tofu before, but I know it's healthy and a good meat substitution, so I decided to give it a try. I had low expectations, as did my mom (she's always been leery of tofu) but when I made it we were both standing over the pan munching on it right out of the oven.  The texture can take a little getting used to, but the flavor is great and it went together very quickly.  A great way to try out a new food, and something I'll definitely be making again.

This took a lot longer for me to bake (about an hour) and it was SUPER salty. It's not bad, but definitely not good either.

Great recipe!  I made this just as the recipe instructed.  I am new to tofu and low-carb living - 3 months of it and down 70 lbs.!  Yay!  I loved this recipe, although it was a little dry.  However, I added some to a serving of Shirataki rice with some steamed broccoli, a handful of sunflower seed to  bump up the protein, and a spritz or two of Liquid Aminos for a delicious dinner or lunch with almost no carbs and very few calories!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love these.  I didn't have sesame seeds, and I omitted the liquid smoke however I would like to use it next time.  I wrapped the tofu in paper towel and let it drain (a la Alton Brown) for about 20 minutes.  Then I cut it up, marinated the pieces for about an hour and baked them for 45 minutes.  I used sriracha for the hot sauce.  Will make again!!

The tofu bites tasted ok. Nothing specular. Next time I will just use a teriyaki marinade instead of going through the trouble of measuring all the listed ingredients. Also I had to bake for 40 minutes instead of the 15 minute time listed. Remember to turn tofu during the 40 minute cook time.

For anyone who watches their salt intake, definitely reduce the soy sauce amount as these are very salty.  Other than that these are a quick and easy way to prepare little tofu bites. Make extra sauce and thicken it with potato starch for tofu dipping or topping. yummy!

These tofu bites were tasty.  I followed some suggestions from reviewers and marinated longer (overnight), reduced soy sauce to 2 T, and omitted liquid smoke.  I might try it also with a bit of the liquid smoke flavor, since I do like it and VICKY9999 recommends it particularly.  The tofu absorbed all of the marinade, as some reviewers noted, but I didn't mind, the amount was just right with nothing wasted.  I served these warm with a rice side dish.  The tofu cubes were nice and tender and had plenty of flavor.  Thanks!  Will make again.

I, too, followed the advice of others, and used less soy sauce (I didn't cut it in half, just used closer to 1/5 a cup). I used a bit more of the following: ketchup, garlic, hot sauce. What I would have done differently is combined all the tasty cubes with white rice and veggies. We definitely enjoyed them! The flavor balance (between hot and sweet and salty) ended up being perfect. Thanks for the recipe!
[Side note/tip: I added about 1 1/2 tsp of corn starch to the remainder of the marinade to use as a sauce later.]

Generally, I use tofu in rice and/or noodle stir fry, but wanted to try something different last night and found this recipe. It was delicious! Very flavourful, and I served it on a side of pasta and Caesar salad. The only variations I made to it were: I didn't use sesame seeds because I didn't have any. I didn't have any liquid smoke flavour, but instead I used lapsang souchong tea, which is a specialty tea with a very smokey flavour! My husband also enjoyed this dish. Light, healthy and tasty.

This is amazing!! I bought BBQ sauce and marinated the tofu for 4hours. 
Try "Sprouted Tofu" super firm. Awesome texture and you don't have to spend time draining the tofu. I will make this again!!! 

Thanks!

A good variation to this recipe is to add panko bread crumbs to the marination mixture. I gives it an extra crunch and soaks up the marinade well.

This is a good recipe, if a bit dry. I followed the advice of others and halved the amount of liquid smoke but otherwise made no changes. I'd make this again, but would likely serve the tofu in a stir fry or salad instead of on its own in order to balance out some of the dryness.

I followed the steps exactly, with the exception of adding the liquid smoke.  My tofu bites didn't look as dark as the picture, and they weren't as flavorful (I guess the liquid smoke may contribute to color as well as flavor?  Will try again after purchasing some liquid smoke.

I planned to add them to a salad, served with Frank's Thai Chicken (a slow cooker recipe I found on allrecipes.com), but in the end, I added them to the chicken and rice on each plate, and they were good!

This is really delicious, although a bit salty. When making the marinade, I followed the advice of some of the previous reviews, and used half the proper amount of liquid smoke. To cut the saltiness, next time I think I'll use half the amount of soy sauce. I marinated the tofu for about an hour, setting aside the leftover marinade while baking. (Oh, I doubled the amount of sauce in order to have a good amount of marinade with which to work.) After baking, I added the tofu to the remainder of the sauce and warmed it all in a saucepan on the stove until the sauce was simmering and had coated the tofu. It was super tasty - even my husband, who is not a vegetarian, loved it!

We had this sprinkled on top of a rice dish, but they were quite yummy on their own. There was no sauce to speak of. It all ended up stuck to the pan, which fortunately did clean up easily

This was good. Didn't have vinegar some added lemon juice and omitted liquid smoke. Added some ground ginger. My family and I loved it. Would cook it longer and have more sauce next time.

Very very good! I made it without the liquid smoke because I don't like that flavour. As is there was more than enough marinade to go around. I poured it on top of the tofu in the pan and re-basted the tofu mid-way. I recommend baking it on tinfoil for easy clean-up. Next time I'm adding fresh ginger!

Before trying this recipe I read a few of the reviews and followed a common suggestion to leave out the smoke flavoring. It was delicious. I doubled the recipe and took it to an outdoor evening party and none of it was left over!

These are awesome, very tasty! I left out the liquid smoke (didn't have any) and I marinated for about 3 to 4 hours.  Baked on one side for 15 mins, then about 9 mins on the other. My sister & I couldn't stop eating them. Don't forget to spray your pan, I forgot and some of them stuck pretty good lol

Pretty good. I added more hot sauce and maple syrup than called for. A lot of reviewers said to leave out the liquid smoke, but I LOVE liquid smoke. Makes everything taste like bacon--what's not to like?

This recipe has been a great way for my boyfriend to eat tofu with me without complaining!  I was hesitant about it at first, because I've never used ketchup in a recipe before(I'm not a fan). But I went with it. The result was actually quite good! It's a nice addition to stirfrys. I love the technique of baking the tofu as well. I hadn't tried that before and it really allows the flavor to be absorbed into the tofu. Its the only way I cook tofu now:)  For me, its a 4, but for my boyfriend its a 5 :P

I hate to give a bad review, but these were not appetizing. They tasted like salt with an unappealing hint of maple. I am a tofu fan and know that there are plenty of ways to make it taste good. This is not worth the time and effort.

I don't know what I did wrong. I followed directions with suggestions (left out the liquid smoke & made extra sauce) but this was just an over salty half burned disaster.

I followed the recipe exactly, only leaving out the smoke flavoring as I didnt have any. I did NOT like the texture of the finished product, and I normally LOVE baked tofu.....not sure what happened, but I wished it was better.

I'm just now making this a second time, but it was great the first.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  One Liquid smoke is hard to get in the UK so I omitted it.  I also found that adding a little more hot sauce makes for some zing!  Of course I like spicy things.  I also marinated for much much longer about twenty minutes.  It made for a better taste.  Also, when you drain your tofu put it between two plates with cans on top to get out more of the liquid.  It soaks up the marinate better that way.  Enjoy!

Very Tasty!  All the meat lovers in my house even enjoyed this tofu recipe.  The smoke flavouring really does something for it.  Only thing is I marinaded the tofu for about half an hour.

this was tasty, but i think it could also use some tinkering according to individual taste. honey, ginger, toasted sesame seeds, orange juice -- all could be incorporated here in various combinations.

I've made this recipe nearly a dozen times. It's truly a great one. I usually marinate the tofu overnight just to soak up the great sauce as much as possible. Rawk. Love it. And so do most non tofu people.

These were way too salty in my opinion. We couldn't eat them enough to finish half of them. I'll give it another go sometime in the future, but will follow other suggestions and use Braggs rather than soy sauce.

I made it following the directions to a T minus the smoke and I was a bit disappointed since the previous reviews hyped it up. Next time, I would definitely double up the sauce and put a little less soy sauce and a little more maple syrup so it's not as salty. I also think it'd taste better if it was battered, but I guess that would make it much less healthy.

These really good and spicy! I twicked it just a little by using Braggs which is a healthy alternative to soy sauce, omitted the liquid smoke and seamse seeds. Very yummy!

I loved it, but more importantly, my six small children AND my two teens loved it! They didn't realize it was tofu, until the entire tray was gone.  I usually use the cubed tofu, and serve as appetizers with toothpicks.  Couldn't be quicker, easier or tastier.  Also great in casseroles and salads.

it was pretty tasty - didn't have any liquid smoke so didn't use that.  My 3 & 5 year enjoyed it too.  Just a little too tangy, I would probably leave out the ketchup next time.

I substituted honey for the maple syrup because our maple syrup is butter flavored and I was skeptical of how it would taste in this recipe.  I also left out the liquid smoke because of the reviews that said it tasted weird.  I ended up cooking mine for about 50 minutes and cranked the heat up to 450 for the last 7 or 8 minutes to get them a little crispy.  Next time I'm going to try cooking them at 400 the whole time so it goes faster.  Regardless, my fiance and I really enjoyed this recipe and I'll make it on a regular basis!

oh my ! incredible. I marinated it just for half an hour, saved the marinade that wasn't soaked up, and when the tofu was through baking, I poured some of the left over marinade over top of it (along with my cooked zucchini and onions). I halfed the soy sauce, and used less maple syrup. I didn't use hot sauce (not a fan), nor sesame seeds (didn't have on hand). Personally, I thought this was very easy to prepare, and even easier to eat : )

This is such a simple way to add more protein to your diet.  And so tasty!  I cheated on the sauce and used the leftover bbq sauce I had in the fridge.  Came out great!

YUm and more YUM!  The only problem was it didn't make nearly enough! I used honey instead of the syrup because I didn't have any syrup, added a little brown sugar splenda and left out the liquid smoke.  I baked my cubes for longer than the recipe called for. I liked the leftovers cold from hte fridge.. they were nice and chewy and yummy. Oh I also let them sit in the marinate over ngiht before baking. They absorbed almost all of the yummy marinade

Great recipe! I omitted the liquid smoke flavoring and used a very hearty “dash” of hot sauce. I also turned the cubes about halfway though the cooking. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Thank you, VICKY9999!

I really loved this recipe.  It was quick and easy.  I didn't have smoke flavor but I don't think I would have liked it.  It turned out great and made a really great topping for salad the next day.

The recipe was great, but I remember why I don't like tofu that much.  Sirracha is a bit strong for this recipe by the way.

I am not sure what I did wrong BUT I could not get the marinade to stick to the tofu and get crispy. My marinade turned out watery BUT I am going to try this again because if I can get it right I am sure it is YUMMY!!!!

I didn't use the liquid smoke and being new to tofu didn't know I had to squeeze out all of the water before marinating, but it was still delicious. I live at a high elevation so I cooked it a bit longer than suggested (15 min on each side) and it was perfect. I'm not a big tofu fan and I really liked these. I will definitely make these again.

Terrible flavor; very salty and strong tasting.  I will not be making these again.  For all of the trouble, they are just a waste of time.  Plain baked tofu squares with a coating of bottle barbecue sauce are better and easier to prepare.

i made this as written and it was pretty good. It tastes like a bbq sauce to me but maybe that was the liquid smoke. Some of the sauce did burn on my pan so I had to wash it right away. I think I might make this again but tweek it without the smoke and add some grated ginger for a more asian taste. Thanks!

This was definately not worth the amount of stuff I had to use to make it. I love tofu, but this was waaaay to salty to even eat. The flavor was just plain odd to the point I can't even describe it, I had to pick them all out of my salad. My classmates who tried them just made a strange face and said they were 'different', hopefully this didn't scare them away from tofu for good. Bad texture too, maybe my oven cooks faster than the time set here. Maybe I'll ease up on the soy sauce and leave out the sesame seeds, otherwise I can't say I'll ever make this again.

This was Very salty. I followed the recipe exactly except I omited the liquid smoke and added 2 Tablespoons honey. I think it would have been a good bbq sauce but it would need anout 1/2 the soy sauce. dont think ill make this one again!

this was amazing. I made a few changes because i didn't have a few things, plus i doubled the recipe. and i added a tablespoon of a-1. instead of the just ketchup i did half ketchup and half bbq sauce. i didnt have the the sprinkles or smoked stuff. i added a few extra dashes of hot sauce. i loved this recipe! thanks for putting it on the website. it was a lil too salty, so next time ill use just a bit less. so yummy though!

Very, very tasty.  I didn't have ketchup but had Jufran banana sauce (a condiment that looks like ketchup but is a little sweeter, found in Filipino groceries) so used that instead.  I also ditched the liquid smoke.  I used extra firm tofu and pressed the liquid out as others have suggested, for about 30 minutes.  I also cut the tofu into cubes smaller than the 1/2".  This was so good on top of my salad, and even better the next day.  I'll definitely make this again.

I'm normally not a fan of tofu, but using extra firm tofu in this recipe, and then saving the marinade to use as a dipping sauce - wow!  The result was better than I had expected.  Just plonk a small jar of toothpicks and a dipping well in the center, and you have a great little appetizer plate.

Kids and Hubby LOVED it! I haven't even had a chance to try it yet. Will definitely make this recipe a regular event. The first time I've not had to nag my son to finish his lunch before the school bus arrives.

I used dark agave nectar because I ran out of pure maple syrup. I added 50% more agave and ketchup, doubled the vinegar (using Rice vinegar), used fresh grated garlic and white pepper (hubby won't eat blk pepper) and marinated for an hour as another reviewer said.

Then I baked on a parchment lined sheet at 375 the first 15 minutes, 400 the second 15 minutes, and spooned the left over marinade over after the second 15 minutes and cooked 5 minutes more.

I freeze then thaw my tofu to get a more meatier texture and pressed the water out before cutting.

I followed the recipe except for the liquid smoke (I did not have any).  I also made sure to really press all the liquid out of the tofu.  Lastly, just make sure to keep an eye on the tofu once it is in the oven.  Some of my pieces started to get a little "too crispy".  I really enjoyed this recipe as did two of my three daughters (and believe me, they are pretty picky eaters).  We snacked on them and finished them off within minutes.  Next time I'll need to make a double batch!

I liked them and I followed the recipe exactly.  Except they were a little soft b/c I got firm instead of extra firm tofu.  And I forgot to spray the pan so they stuck pretty bad.

These weren't bad, but just ok.  I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I liked the flavor of the sauce.  He wants to try it on chicken.  We both like toufu, but probably won't be maknig these again.

This recipe did not quite soak into the tofu and the tofu came out very dry.
I don't think I'll be trying this again.

Our family of 7 was split on this recipe.  Oddly enough one of our "meat eaters" loved it, but 2 of our "veggie eaters" didn't.  We did not use the liquid smoke, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Not a huge hit, but we will give this one another try.

This was a good recipe.  I didn't have any sesame seeds so I left those out. I was hoping for the coating to carmelize more so it would be more chewy, but it turned out ok.

These were pretty good.  I marinated for about half an hour and will probably do it for longer next time.  Also, I think that I cut the pieces a little bit too big.  Next time I'll really be sure to cut them into 1/2 inch pieces, since the outside, which gets coated in the sauce, is my favorite part.

This was very good only wish it was a little saucier, (quite possible it should have been, sort of new at this tofu thing).  Next time I think I will add some more maple syrup or try honey.

Great flavor and texture. The sauce/mixture blotted out that unpleasant tofu taste. It actually looked like cubed chicken breast when it was done. I made some modifications since I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand: 1) Lime juice instead of vinegar, 2) honey instead of maple syrup, 3) ground almonds, soy nuts and sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds, 4) soft tofu in lieu of firm, 5) no smoke flavor, and 6) baked for 45 minutes total instead of only 30. I'll definitely be making this again--so convenient and can be made with whatever's in your kitchen.

I made it just as described except I let it marinate for about an hour based on other reviewers feedback.  Even the longer marinating time didn't help the taste which I found to be bland.  Sorry!
