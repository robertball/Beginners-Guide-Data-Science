Spicy Baked Tofu Haiku: "I just love tofu, but it needs to be drained more. (Extra-firm is best.) Can't imagine only draining the liquid for a mere 5 min., when I usually set my tofu (this recipe doesn't specify what kind, but I prefer extra-firm for marinating and baking) b/t paper-towel lined plates, weighed down w/ heavy cans or cast-iron skillet. This marinade is wonderful, and flavorful but could really benefit from the addition of minced garlic and maybe some sesame oil; I sprinkled mine w/ toasted sesame seeds and green onion. Super nommy as written!

This was actually some of the best tofu I've ever made. Can't recommend enough. Spicy, tangy, filling, delicious!!! Bookmarked to use again. I added a little oil to the marinade

I LOVED this! Since I don't eat meat, I'm always looking for new tofu recipes. This was perfect and easy enough to remember without having to look at the recipe each time. Totally forgot to take a pic when done as the aroma prompted me to began eating immediately ??

I'm giving my vegetarian husband's rating on taste.  I don't care for tofu as much as he does.  I agree with other reviewers--do more pressing and draining with paper towels.  Get the tofu as dry as possible.  Marinade, dry again.  From experience, I cut the brick of VERY FIRM tofu in half.  I then bake the 1/2 bricks.  Once the baking is complete and tofu is cooled, then cut into cubes.

Yummy recipe and easy to make! My tofu came out a bit soft (I would have liked it crispier), so I recommend draining longer and making sure that it's completely dry before getting into the oven.

The marinade for this "Spicy Baked Tofu" is exceptional on its own - and my high-quality tofu (SOL CUISINE brand) tasted good just tossed in this without even cooking it (next time I will just use this to top some hot rice). I halved the marinade and still had more than enough. I also marinated the tofu in a glass dish since I am adverse to generating unnecessary garbage. There is no way I would follow the instruction to "discard the extra marinade": it is too yummy! The fresh ginger takes it over the top (dried ginger in this recipe is not even half as good). Thank you Kiara Sexton for sharing your recipe.

The recipe is great as is and with variations based on what I have on hand (sweet chili sauce instead of spicy) but I always use extra fresh ginger for a pop.

Although I enjoy strong flavors, these were just too assertive for me and felt like it needed a little something-something added to it.  My five year old loved it though!

This has a lot of flavor. I added garlic and a little sesame oil. I also drained the tofu for a couple hours and marinated it for a couple hours.

This was definitely spicy which gave the tofu good flavor.  Overall i am just not sure if I really enjoyed eating this dish.  The texture of the tofu was not bad.  I guess overall the dish was just not as good as I'd hoped it would be.  I do not plan to make this dish again.

This was quite good and an easy weeknight dinner, which I am always glad to find.  You definitely need to drain the tofu much longer than 5 minutes, though.  I set mine in a colander with a weighted pan on top, leaving it for at least 20 minutes.  The other option is to freeze the tofu and extract the water as it defrosts.

My first time making tofu and it was easy and delicious. Meat eating husband liked it too. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very crispy. I don't like mushy tofu, so yea! I couldn't find hoisin at trader joe's so I got a dark reddish teriyaki like sauce and the marinade was delicious. I served it with vegetable fried rice. I will definitely make again and will make a double batch of marinade to use half to serve over cooked tofu and rice. Yummy!
