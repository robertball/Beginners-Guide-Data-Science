Awesome healthy cookies!  These are definitely a perfect base for an "everything" cookie.  These are the changes I made - partly out of necessity and partly because I am health-conscious!  - I used unsweetened applesauce - Heaping 1/2 cup brown sugar only (omitted white). - 1 whole egg and 1/2 of a banana mashed - handful of sesame seeds - 1/4 cup walnuts and 1/4 sunflower seeds - 1/2 cup white and milk chocolate chips (no craisins or raisins on hand). - whole wheat flour  Because I improvised a bit, I ended up having an overly sticky dough at the end so added an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  I made the cookies quite large (1 1/2 dozen) and so baked them for 10 minutes.  Perfect!  The result is a very yummy and pretty healthy cookie - one I don't feel bad about allowing my two year old to have.  Next time, I may cut the brown sugar back again to just 1/2 cup... and keep the rest of my changes :)

Oh my! These were delicious! I made a few alterations, however. I didn't have applesauce in the house, so I used 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt. This seemed to work great. I also used a 1/2 cup of splenda in place of the sugar and only 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. I'm not a fan of nuts in my cookies, so I left them out. The description of the cookie said they weren't very sweet, but I thought they were PLENTY sweet. I will definitely be making these again! It's an awesome alternative when you're craving something sweet!

these cookies are soooo wonderful!!  i used cinnamon applesauce and splenda instead of the white sugar.  i also made a half batch without chocolate chips for my milk-allergic daughter, so i love that this recipe doesn't include butter so she can enjoy too! i baked mine for 7 minutes and they stayed pretty soft, as we like them.  they're enough to curb the sweet tooth without the major guilt trip later :)

I made these cookies with figs instead of dried cranberries and they turned out wonderful with a pleasant chewy texture that I like to have in a cookie. My friend next door said they were delicious and healthy to boot.

Fantastic! I made a few revisions because I baked these at home during a snow day and I think they turned out amazing!  I added one over ripe banana, some coconut, and substituted golden raisins and dried blueberries for the cranberries.  Really folks, OUTSTANDING!!!!

These are very good! I'm a health nut and am always looking for healthy alternatives to cookies and these are it! I didn't add quite as many chocolate chips though and they were really good. I did find that for my first batch 10 minutes was too long because they got a little dried out, but 9 minutes was perfect. I will be making these again!

Excellent! I baked for 11 minutes. Used pecans instead of walnuts. These are as good as any full fat cookies I have made.

Awesome! I work-out a lot and I like to sneak in protein wherever I can so I substituted 1/2 the flour with chocolate protein powder, and also substituted the chocolate chips for unsweetened carob chips (much healthier) and only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar (no white sugar). I think next time I may try to take out the brown sugar altogether, and replace it with agave nectar or splenda. Overall, I loved these, especially the way they "fluff" up in the oven! These are my new power bar ;)

These turned out great. I beat the egg whites but also added the yolks to the sugar/applesauce mix (couldn't throw them away...). Other than that I followed the recipe with the addition of 1/4 cup flour to counter for the extra egg yolks. Baked for 10 minutes. They came out soft and delicious. I might try a little less white sugar next time.

These were delicious, I omitted the cranberries and I also used whole wheat flour instead of regular flour. I made them for my husband to take on a weekend kayaking trip.

Based upon other reviews I adapted the recipe. Used only 1/4 cup brown sugar (no white sugar), substituted half the flour with chocolate protein powder, used one whole egg and one banana, used a combo of craisins and dried blueberries, and completely omitted the chocolate instead adding 1/2 cup mixed sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds. Yummy! Only needed to bake for 7 minutes. Don't need the chocolate at all with all the sweetness of the fruit and the seeds really add a nice crunch. Next time would probably use less sugar. Love how they get super fluffy. Thanks for the base recipe :)

Great recipe.  I don't normally make changes, but these seem to be open for experiment.  I used half wheat flour and half white.  I tried diced apples, added more cinnamon, and used almonds.  I'm going to make it again this evening using raisins, walnuts and milk chocolate chips.  This will be my 3rd batch and my 3rd experiment.

After going to a local cafe last week and breaking away from my usual chocolate treat,I decided to give their trail mix cookie a try. I loved it and was determined to find a recipe. I came across this one and will definitely make it again! I followed the recipe just as its given, only for my "trail mix" combo, I used shredded coconut, dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and cashews. This may replace my chocolate chip cookies!

Good cookie, excellent low fat cookie! I followed the recipe almost exactly. Used a little less white sugar 1/3 to 1/4 of a cup would be fine and I used Craisins instead of dried cranberries and no nuts. 10 minutes on a baking sheet is perfect. 13-14 minutes on a baking stone.

Hubby & I enjoyed these, not sure how my kids are going to like them. They are not very sweet & tend to be a little cakey if you bake them a tad too long.  Pull them out before they start to brown and let them sit 3-5 min on cookie sheet to firm up.  I doubled the recipe, but did not add quite all the flour or oats as the dough seemed stiff enough.  I'm glad I did because of the previously  mentioned tendency to dryness.  I will make these again for Hubby & I as we need some "Healthy" treats and good recipes are few and far between!

These were the best cookies I've made in quite awhile.  Used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose and only one egg.  (Whipped the white and threw the yolk in with the applesauce mixture.)  Cooked for exactly nine minutes.  The cookies came out light and fluffy with a bit of body--very impressed.  My only complaint is that to do it right takes four bowls.  Thanks, dancer7899, for a great cookie recipe.

Really yummy cookie!  I took it in a slightly different direction, though, as applesauce and walnuts are not favorites around our house.  I used a smashed banana and 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of the applesauce, peanuts instead of walnuts, and no cranberries or cinnamon.  YUM!

Bravo to a healthier alternative cookie, and I'm pleased with how nicely these turned out. Since it's easy to vary what ingredients you've got on hand (or just personal preferences), here's how I tweaked them:  3/4 c brown sugar and a healthy squeeze of two of honey. I added a few tablespoons of  peanut butter just because I like it (and wanted a little extra protein since I intend to eat these as a "grab and go" breakfast cookie). I used a whole egg and subbed 1 tsp baking powder instead, desiring a puffier, cake-like cookie. Not measuring, I tossed in some pomegranate craisins, grape nuts, and chocolate chunks (would've used the mini morsels, but I was out). I didn't have pecans, which I'll add toasted next time, nor did I have sunflower seeds, which I adore in anything trail mix-y.  Overall, these were a cinch to throw together, baked up exactly how I imagined, and I can't wait to experiment further with these!

a tasty healthier take on a usually fat and sugar packed cookie... I think you can throw what ever you want in these for texture (different nuts or seeds) and flavor (vanilla chips or other dried fruit)... the only problem i had with mine is they seemed to have a rather chewy texture... this could have been because I put them in a container too soon or perhaps didn't bake them long enough... but once you got past the texture these were pretty good

These were pretty good.  I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and added 1 banana.  Definitely a good alternative to normal sugar filled cookies.

Very good.  Followed the recipe to a tee, only used raisins rather than the cranberries. I only got 20 cookies out of this recipe since I decided to make a larger cookie.  Also, I flattened them slightly with a fork and unbaked so they would be chewy. Definitely a keeper, with so many possible variations. Thanks, dancer7889!

I used Splenda for the white and brown sugars which really shouldn't have changed anything, but they weren't even sweet enough for a breakfast cookie.   I had to add lots more.  Also, my biggest disappointment was the calories.  I used a small cookie scoop that I think was the equivalent to a "heaping teaspoon" and I got five less than stated.   I'm sure this sounds petty but when you are dieting every cookie counts!

Love these cookies. This is the second time I made them and  this time, I spiced them up. Used 2 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I didn't use chocolate chips. I substituted 1 cup of raisins. I also only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. They were plenty sweet enough. The other spices made them taste very rich. Thanks for a great healthy cookie alternative!

I thought they tasted okay, but they are no bargain on calories.  A Double-stuff Oreo or a fun-size Twix Cookie are less or roughly the same calorically - but, they're a little bigger and taste better.

I only used half a cup of cane sugar and left out the brown sugar entirely. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. My dad loved them! Not too sweet, perfect as a quick snack. I will definitely be making these again.

This were very easy to make and are very tasty. They were a little sticky so I am not sure if I did something wrong. I did made them twice the size because I was looking for a breakfast cookie I could have with my coffee in the morning. So maybe that was the problem. I made the recipe exactly but I did use unsweetened applesauce since it did not state sweet or unsweet in the recipe. Some of the people thought they were to sweet. These big cookies are only 4 weight watchers points and a definite keeper.

I am in LOVE with these cookies. I added 1/4 cup of shredded coconut and some sunflower seeds and DARK CHOCOLATE chips!! SOOO good. They got eaten up really fast. These are my new favorite cookies and I feel very good about them not having oil or butter. And they're dairy free! Awesome!

Great starting recipe, but felt there was more to be done to make these healthier!  Like other reviewers, I reduced the sugar- but mine went done to 1/4 cupe brown sugar, and 1/8 cup honey.  I also increased the vanilla to 2 tsp, and salt to 1 tsp.  Also used wheat flour instead of white. I love adding "extras" to my cookies, so I increased the walnuts and chocolate chips, and used raisins instead of dried cranberries.  Definately a delicious alternative to regular cookies!

Made these for diabetic friends/family. I used 2 whole eggs instead of just the whites. Most of white sugar was Splenda. That's the only modifications. They are so good and healthy!

I made these in a cabin at 10,000 feet with no mixer to beat egg whites, so I used a whole egg. I had no chips, but I did have trail mix with an assortment of nuts & chips, also craisins & raisins , so I threw in a cup of that. The first sheet was cooked on an aluminum cookie sheet...they did not cook fully on the bottom.  I used a baking sheet for the others...they were less gooey.  Next time I will use more flour to try to remedy this.  The flour I used was for high altitude baking.  My husband loved these... and he is not the cookie monster I am.  I will also try this at home as presented.

These taste awesome! They combine applesauce, cinnamon, chocolate, craisins and oats wonderfully. I omitted the walnuts, and the  batter made 34 cookies. I just couldn't get the egg whites to mix in with the applesauce mixture at first, but they mixed in well later. Everyone loved them, they're my new favorite healthy cookie!

Great recipe with a few changes.  I used oil instead of applesauce.  Added chopped dates and apricots instead of cranberries.  Used whole wheat flour and added a bit of flax meal.  These cookies were moist and smelled incredible.  We even had some for breakfast the next day.  Hearty, dense and good for you!

Added a little more cinnamon. Delicious and relatively healthy.
