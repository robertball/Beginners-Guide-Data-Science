ABSOLUTELY AWEFUL!  I love peaches and I love cheesecake.  This sounded like a great recipe to try.  The dough was too thick, the filling too thin and absolutely tasteless!  What a waste of perfectly good ingredients.  I made the mistake of making this for a party that I was having.  It was an absolute embarrassment to me to have made this recipe!

I haven't made this recipe, but a peach cheesecake bar sounds like it would be good. I have never seen any cheescake recipe that called for corn syrup for the sweetener and I think I'd try a half a cup of granulated white sugar instead in the filling for this. I don't much see the point of corn syrup in the crust either. Maybe the recipe orignally was published by Karo or something!

for LYNN-BOB, a good idea to improve this recipe is to use 3 8oz cream cheese instead of 2, use graham crust and thinly drizzle with chocolate fudge.
