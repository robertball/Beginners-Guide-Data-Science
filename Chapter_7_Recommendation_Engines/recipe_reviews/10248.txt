I decided that since I had all the ingredients for this mix that I would give it a whirl.  It only took a few minutes to throw it together.  I've tried some of the recipes that go with it and I love it.  It is incredibly convenient.  I can make a batch of cookies faster than I can tear open a bag. :)

This is convenient, but not very tasty.  The powdered milk is nutritious, but gives it an odd flavor.  I tried several variations, and ended up adding things every time to make the texture right.  I would rather use an individual recipe that I know will work.  This might be good for beginning cooks or kids who like to cook and aren't real picky about the results.

Pros: easy & handy! Cons: too high of a sugar to flour ratio? I made the choc chip & coconut ones so far, and they were candy like in terms of sugary taste. Not bad if you like that, but many cookie recipes have less sugar than flour so next time if I make this I will reduce the sugar by a cup. The bad side of doing that is I might just be left with enough for 3.5 batches of cookies instead of 4. Also, I think the sifting step might really help to thoroughly mix the ingredients, I wonder if people have had different results because of unevenly mixed ingredients? (For example, too much baking powder clumped in one of the cups taken or or not enough, etc.?)

I made some homemade PB with my PB maker, it was dry, so I thought I would make PB cookies. I loved this recipe, a little skeptical at first because it didn't call for brown sugar. I did add an extra egg because my batter was on the dry side. I know this doesn't always work, but it did for me. It turned out awesome. Baked them for 8 minutes, kids gobbled them up. Will be trying all the rest of the BCM recipes that are provided. Good job!

Good for gift-giving.  I've only made the brownies from this recipe...but I can only eat them with tons of frosting...otherwise, they aren't very good.

Horrible recipe. I made everything that this mix was to be used for but still yet it came out looking like water. None of the recipes even tasted good. I love to bake and well, I know that I will never use this recipe for anything ever again.

When you make this recipe, I would recommend using a finely ground dry milk powder. The one I used has larger rounds that resisted my sifting actions. I made basic sugar cookies and peanut butter cookies from this basic mix. Since this basic recipe is part of what guaranteed success or lack thereof, I have to report that the peanut butter cookies came out pretty great and the basic sugar cookies were flat. I wouldn't use my remaining basic cookie mix to make any more sugar cookies but I would definitely be making more peanut butter cookies.

I like this stuff!  It's so simple my 11 an 13 year old kids have been using it with the Basic Chocolate Drop recipe.  They can make their own when they beg for sweets.  Very economical, I finally found a use for that powdered milk thats been sitting up in my cabinet.  The cookies are nothing fancy but taste very good for the modest ingredients.  I think the kids can try the peanut butter ones next.

these were amazing!! I used coconut oil instead of butter and they came out so wonderful. I didn't melt the coconut but put it in solid and added a little water.

Wonderful recipe! I'm just surprised it doesn't have more reviews!!! because it taste wonderful! I think that the dough is a bit too soft but I added extra flour! so you can add an extra cup of flour or as much flour as you think you need until the dough is a little bit tougher enough for you to make a shape. Then add anything you like on your cookies and Voila! a very tasty and easy cookie mix!!!

WOW! I made the chocolate drop cookies with my nieces (4 and 6) and it was so easy and they loved it! The cookies were nice and moist and gooey, I only made 16 instead of 18 but then again we didn't really measure, just dopped them onto the pan! Really great!

This is a good recipe and will keep for later use if you want. I added like another cup of flour to make it more into a dough. You need to fiddle with it though, because it is definatly not enough flour for the dough you need for thick cookies.

We've used this recipe for the past two years as the base for our bake sale cookies.  I prefer to reduce the butter and/or add a bit more mix for better consistancy.  We make 15+ different kinds of cookies by adding different fruit, nuts, candies, coconut, etc.

Easy, easy, easy (and quick)! A little butter heavy, even for someone who likes butter. Adding cinnamon like another reader suggested was smart. I'm gonna try this one with chocolate chips next time :)

I burnt these cookies the first time I made them, but I think it has more to do with my oven than the recipe itself. Once I get the cooking time figured out, I think they will be great!

I made this and have only had problems with it. The "dough" when baked, spreads out and becomes gooey instead of hardening into cookies. It is great if you just like to eat chocolate chip cookie dough.

I've tried making chocolate chip cookies with this recipe twice, both times were failures.
The flavor was pretty good, but as the cookies baked, they spread out way too thin...even if I chilled the dough before baking.
Not very happy with the results at all.

This is a simple recipe for 9 different cookies, you just make the basic recipe, and then add to it depending on what type of cookie you want! I love this! It made making cookies so simple! I loved the Peanut Butter! I had problems with the sugar recipe, I think that it calls for to much butter, it made the batter to runny!

This is now my favorite cookie mix!  My only changes were that when I made my first batch I added 1/2 as much vanilla and used orange extract for the other half and rather than using melted butter I used shortening (I was running out of butter and the store was closed!)  Chilling the dough after cutting out the shapes - while the oven preheated - helped them maintain their shapes.  Family LOVED them.  Going to use the basic mix to make white chocolate chip/macadamia nut cookies today per special request.

After adding the wet ingredients the batter is crumbly and difficult to form the cookie. Any suggestions to fix this problem.

I made this mix and used in in pb cookies.  They turned out ok, but spread quite a bit.  I'm looking forward to trying it in more recipes.  After using 2 c. for the pb mix I put the remaining mix in pint canning jars for easy use the next time I make cookies.

had nothing but problems with this.  My sister and I used the scaled down option but it just flopped.  Admittedly we aren't very good at sugar cookies for some reason but this was ridiculous.  It was too soupy to roll out to even cut the cookies added a major amount of flour but eventually gave up and just cooked it in a cake pan.
