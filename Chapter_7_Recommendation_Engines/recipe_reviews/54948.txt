The soup was easy to prepare.  The 5-spice powder has a distinct and strong flavor (either you'll love it or hate it!) so do not over-use.  My 6 year old son really loved the broth and noodles.  My husband added a little hot sauce (as he does to everything) for a little zing!

Really good, I did add sliced mushrooms, sliced green, red and yellow peppers and onions; we like more vegetables.  Next time I will spice it up with a few drops of chili oil.

Thanks for a wonderful idea for dinner. I read this about a week ago and thought it would be a good way to use up all my stir fry veggies. This recipe is so easy that I didn't need to revisit it or print it. I made it with all the veggies I like and instead of angel hair pasta I used 2 packs of Mr. Noodles - and it still made 4 servings. This is a very tastey soup.

This recipe is very fast, easy to make, healthy, and delicious!  It's closer than anything I've found to the little Japanese noodle shops in Honolulu.  I didn't have the five-spice powder on hand.  So, I just boiled the chicken and cut it into small pieces, added bean sprouts, chopped scallions, red pepper to make it spicy, and omitted the soy sauce.  I prepared each family member's bowl with the ingredients they like, then poured the hot broth over it.  Excellent!  Thanks!

This was great! So easy to make! I added some Oyster Sauce and it was good. My husband loved this. Next time I might add some more spinach - my husband and I love spinach. I would strongly suggest this for all you soup lovers.

I LOVED this recipe. The five-spice powder lent a wonderful extra flavor and frankly made the recipe! The leftovers went fast...

This is our favorite soup.  We follow the recipe exactly, and it comes out wonderful.  SOmetimes I substitute chard and I like to top with garlic chives, makes it look pretty,  I wouldn't change a thing.

We weren't thrilled with this one.  I agree with those who complained about the broth--it washed the spice off my chicken.  I found the recipe somewhat bland--maybe reducing the broth and adding some heat would have made it appeal more to my tastes.

This soup was a bit dissapointing because the flavor of the broth definitly lacked something and was not worth the effort of preparing the other ingredients or buying the expensive 5 spice powder.

Disappointing. The broth washed out whatever I had going with five-spice and garlic and I took the time to make the broth.

I tried this recipe for the first time last weekend, and loved it! It was easy to make -- probably took 20-25 minutes total -- and delicious. Will definitely fix again.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  We didn't have any broth on hand but it was excellent anyways - it ended up more like a pasta dish.  Also we substituted broccoli for the spinach.  We're already planning to have it again!

Very tasty! The 5 Spice gives it a very unique flavor. I cut back on the broth so the recipe was less soup-like. We enjoyed it very much!
