I was looking for a quick and easy dinner to make and came across this recipe since I had most of the ingredients already. My husband is preparing to run his first marathon so I've been carbing him up all week.  I did not have cream of broccoli so I used cream of chicken instead. I read in the other reviews that it was a little bland so I added some paprika, sage and pepper...that seemed to do the trick!  I also seasoned some chicken tenderloins with the same spices (and a bit of salt) and broiled it while everything else was cooking since I didn't have chicken in a can.  Once I put everything together, it was very tasty and flavorful!

This recipe was very simple and tasted good... my family liked it, but I thought it was a little bland.. I don't what exactly but it needed a little kick of some sort...

tried it with broccoli cheese soup not cream of broccoli. I would probably use a little more broccoli.

Ok... so I usually really enjoy the different recipes by Campbells. This recipe, however, was merely ok... now don't get me wrong... my husband and step daughter loved it & said it tasted like chicken noodle soup without the soup. To me it was bland and was missing a lot of something. I'd make it again if they requested it, but most likely wouldn't eat it.

YUMMY!!  I did alter it a little.  I didn't have chicken stock, so I used a can of milk.  It was very creamy!!  I also took another suggestion and added a little sage ans paprika.
For less sodium, I used real chick breast... microwaved them til cooked and juicy...my micro was 8 minutes.

I used celery soup instead of broccoli soup.  Will try with chicken or broccoli soup next time!

Just okay for us. It's good for a quick weeknight meal. It was more soupy than I was expecting, so I'll try to use less liquid if I make it again.
