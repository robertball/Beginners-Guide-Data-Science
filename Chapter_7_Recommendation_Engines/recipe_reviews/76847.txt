I made a recipe very similar to this over the weekend to cheer on the Philadelphia Eagles' victory!  I used bonesless pork chops, 2 cups sauerkraut, 1/4 cup brown sugar, one envelope onion soup mix, 1 tsp. caraway seeds, and 1/2 cup water.  Cooked it for 8 hours in a crockpot - - very very good.  Next time I will add wine or beer to the crockpot for a bit more liquid.

Hubby was in the mood for ribs, while I was in the mood for sauerkraut: this was the recipe we needed!
Used beer instead of white wine and caraway powder, instead of seeds (I hate caraway seeds!).  
Taste was yummy and meat fell off the bone.
Next time I would cut the carrots smaller, because the "large chunks" were too large for my tastes.
Otherwise: recommended!

I used all wine for my liquid in the recipe and cooked in the oven, as directed.  The meat fell off the bone!  It has a very mild flavor and is very good.

The pork was tender and delicious however I felt it was too sweet and I really didn't care for the taste of carway with the Kraut. I'm going to stick with the tried, true and simple next time - just kraut and pork.

I will be making this as our "goto" kraut and pork recipe from now on.  Pork was very tender and the counterbalance of the minor sweet ingredients tempered the sourness of the kraut perfectly.  My only changes were not draining the kraut so I could retain the liquid in the roaster, layering half the kraut in the bottom of the roaster before placing the browned pork on it, and I removed the browned pork out of the skillet then deglazed the pan using the white cooking wine before adding the other ingredients and rest of kraut to the skillet.  I poured everything on top of the browned pork ribs in the roaster then covered to cook for about 2.5 hours.  We served this over hash browns (not crispy bec/I was out of potatoes to mash) and my boys each had two helpings.   Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very  good recipe I do not understand what another poster meant by "too sweet" ..there was only 1 Tablespoon brown sugar added and an apple  I browned my ribs in 1/2 butter and 1/2 oil also used 4  potatoes and ditched the carrots.. potatoes are made to go wuth kraut giving it a special flavor and texture as it slow cooks  next time may add 1 or 2 cloves minced garlic Delicious!

Supper?  SUPER!  Only thing I'd change is to use even MORE kraut.  Long cook time seems to reduce to "not enough".

Great recipe--I used for chops.  Used German Sauerkraut, which had wine flavoring, so I did not add more (I never acquired a taste for wine).  Baked all in my stoneware and added potatoes.  Came out really moist.

This was well-received by my family, who all "hate" sauerkraut.  I added some onions and left out the caraway seeds as a matter of personal taste. Very good with mashed potatoes. Just wish there was more!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I had forgotten to get carrots and had none in the fridge, so I used onion and celery which I diced and sauteed a bit.  Also, following another reviewer's recommendation, I added potatoes to the casserole.  The potatoes were just cut into large cubes and layered on the bottom of the dish before everything else was thrown in.
Considering how easy this is and the fact that the ingredients are quite often on sale, I know that this will be a do-over again and again.

Very good. My husband loves sauerkraut and I'm just sort of so-so about it. The combination of ingredients tames the sauerkraut flavor and makes it "just right". The only thing I changed was cutting the carrots smaller. I think this would work with other cuts of pork (the bonier ones). This is a keeper.

This was excellent. I'm not real fond of sauerkraut but I loved this. I used Bavarian style sauerkraut. My husband wants this again.
