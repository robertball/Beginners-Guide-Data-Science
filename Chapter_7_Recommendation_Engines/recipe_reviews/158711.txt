Most recipes I find on this site need modified slightly.  Not this one. It is perfect as is.  Kids loved it.  Husband loved it.  In our family, that is a true Christmas miracle!!

SOOOO good! My 1 yr old, 5 yr old, and husband loved it. I used leftover turkey meat from thanksgiving meal and turkey broth I'd made from the turkey carcass. Also I used cooked brown rice instead of barley. It tasted a little off in the end and it took a while to figure out what was missing... garlic powder made it PERFECT so next time I'll do crushed garlic with the onions and green peppers. Amazing! So good and so good for you!

This was great! I halved the recipe but used the full pound of meat to please my other half. I only had regular barley, so I precooked it and added it at the end. I did let it simmer a bit longer than the recipe states, to give my bread time to finish baking. Thanks for a great recipe! UPDATE: I did freeze a serving of this, and once thawed it tasted great! Almost better than the first time.

This was really good, and I have been hoping to find a unique recipe for ground turkey. We really enjoyed this soup. We didn't modify it much, we used 1/4c regular barley and 1/2c orzo (my husband loves orzo in soup). Oh ya I also added garlic. The flavor was great and it was warm & satisfying for a chilly night.

Fantastic! I worried that the tarragon (which is really pungent in its dried form) would be overpowering, but oh my, it provided a very delicate flavor that paired perfectly with the other flavors of this soup. It's even better the next day too! Even my husband enjoyed this hearty soup!

This was okay, but we thought it needed a lot more flavor. I had to add another 4 cups of broth as it was cooking especially after I added the barley, it just absorbed all the liquid. I didn't have quick cooking barley, so it actually had to simmer about 45 minutes before it was done. My family thought it was okay but not great and they both gave this 3 stars.

This came out pretty good, but I think it would be even better with leftover turkey instead of ground turkey (but then again, I'm just not a fan of ground meats in soups).  I probably doubled the onion, added two cloves of garlic and used my homemade vegetable stock.  I hate when I'm rolling through a recipe only to find I'm missing key ingredients, but subbing sweet potato for red potato worked beautifully, and instead of barley I had about 1/2 cup of red lentils to use up.  Love the tarragon aroma and flavor - used the full 2 tbsp and it was perfect.  Can't wait for the next turkey dinner so I can try this with chopped cooked turkey instead of ground!

We loved this soup.  I needed to add lots of pepper and additional tarragon to make it not as bland...but this was a big hit at my house.  Be careful...I didn't have any quick barley and added noodles...by the time we were ready for seconds the noodles had absorbed too much of the soup!  Use the quick barley!

Very tasty and simple. I had ground chicken on-hand, and it turned out just fine. I froze half the batch, and it was even better the second time around!

I was looking for a quick, easy and yummy soup recipe for the end of a busy day, this soup was fantastic!! I did make a few changes such as, I made it with 2 pounds of ground turkey, I also added kidney beans, white beans, corn, green beans and omitted the barley. I also added 2 cloves of garlic, 2 teaspoon of savory seasoning, an extra 2 teaspoons of tarragon. 1 teaspoon garlic salt, 1 teaspoon crushed dried bay leaf, 1 more 8pz can of broth and 2 Chicken bouillon cubes.

We all really enjoyed this recipe.  I had lots of leftover turkey from Christmas, so I cut that up and used it in place of the ground turkey.  I didn't have barley, so I used regular white rice and it was quite yummy.  I also added a couple of sweet potatoes, cubed.  Made the soup very colorful and tasty.  Easy and delicious.  I will make this again!

My husband and I love this soup recipe.  So much that today I decided to join AllRecipes !  This is the third time I made this soup.   Like most others, I added a few more ingredients/spices.  I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic to the turkey mixture.  I also added about a pinch poultry seasoning, ground blk pepper & Herbs De Provence & sea salt.   After adding the chicken broth I also added in about 1 stalk of chopped celery.   I used small russet potatos which I peeled and diced.  And finally I used 1 bag of brown Success rice, which I added once the soup had started to boil.   Seasoned w/ small amount of sea salt & pepper if needed and done!

Didn't have barley.  But I added some chopped up Chard that I had on hand, and it tasted pretty good nonetheless.  Oh, I didn't add bell peppers either (don't really like 'em).

Interesting combination of flavors, but something tastes a bit off.  There's almost a metallic aftertaste, which is disappointing.   I probably won't make this again, unless it all comes together after sitting overnight and being reheated (as other reviewers have said it has).  The potential is there for this soup to be an amazing "comfort food", but this aftertaste is killing me right now. :(

Very easy and tasty. I was hesitant to use 2 T of tarragon, but it tasted wonderful that way. Everyone seemed to love it. Tasted better the next day. I changed it slightly - I added a bit of garlic, used russet potatoes, and rice instead of barley. A squeeze of lemon juice and dash of hot sauce upon serving brightened it up. Will probably make it again, considering it uses simple ingredients I usually have on hand.

This was so delicious!  I was a little worried because I'm usually not crazy about tarragon.  I only made it because I had some quick cook barley on hand that I wanted to use up.  Wow! the flavors mingled beautifully without any overpowering flavor of tarragon that I have disliked in the past.

SO good. I did make some changes. I left out the green pepper and used a small turnip and a parsnip (thanks to another reviewer's suggestion). I also added, a bay leaf, white pepper, parsley, and lots of garlic salt to taste.

This was a great tasting soup.  I used shredded and cubed cooked turkey instead of ground turkey.  It was also good as left overs.  It makes alot of soup.

This soup was flavorful! Added one clove garlic, and perhaps less barley next time, as it does absorb the broth in the end. Overall very good and another way to use ground turkey!!

Made this soup in my Instant Pot.  It was very flavorful and I will make it again. I had a turkey breast in my freezer which I had cooked and I used the leftovers from that instead of ground turkey. I also made my own turkey stock in the Instant Pot using the turkey bones.  Also, I added the turkey meat at the end as it was already fully cooked.  Used rice in place of the barley.  I would definitely recommend using the 2 tablespoons of tarragon as it gives the soup a lovely flavor.  Highly recommend.

Yummy!! Delicious recipe especially on one of the few rainy days we get in Las Vegas. I used whole wheat rotini instead of barley and added two garlic cloves and celery. Absolutely delicious.

Great rainy day springtime soup!! Thank you! Added a can of northern beans, brown rice, two cloves of garlic, and 32 more fl oz of broth. It made a lot for just me and my wife. I thought i would have some to freeze but it's almost gone!

This recipe was delicious and easy. I did substitute the barley with rice, and the whole family really liked it (and for once the leftovers didn't go in the trash!) I did use a full pound of turkey, but think that the next time I make it, it will be with country style ground pork instead (less healthy, more tasty!)

this is one of the most flavorful soups I have ever made! I've used this recipe for a while now and still love it! The tarragon is a perfect compliment to the turkey and veggies!

Loved it on a cold winter's night after Christmas. I used  leftover turkey breast instead of ground turkey, brown rice instead of barley and a half bag of frozen (microwaved first) mixed veggies. Was yummy with my grandma's recipe for (no sugar added) white corn meal cornbread.

To my family, this soup seemed a little weak and thin.  It needed more flavor,  and I had to add orzo just so everyone felt like they were getting a real meal. The tarragon added an interesting flavor though!
