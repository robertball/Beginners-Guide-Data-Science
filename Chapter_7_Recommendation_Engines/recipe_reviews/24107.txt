I took into account the reviews on this recipe before I made it for the first time.  Rather than chocolate graham cracker crums, I bought a prepared Oreo Cookie crust.  I also used only 2/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, rather than 1 cup miniature chocolate chips.  I baked it in the evening, cooled it for about an hour before refrigerating it and served it the next day.  The result - a rich, creamy and delicious homemade cheesecake - the best I've ever had.  An exceptional recipe - and simple!

Wow!  That was the best cheesecake ever. I followed the instructions to a t and it was excellent. As a tips if you coat the chips in a little flour it will cause the chips to not sink to the bottom and to stay evenly distributed throughout the cake.

This was one of the BEST cheesecakes I have ever made. It was really quick and easy. I added a little more chocolate chips and it made it a little too rich. It disappeared so quickly!!

Coming from a novice in the kitchen, this is SO easy and turns out so  well!  I accidently bought plain graham crackers for the crust and it tasted good to my family... also, per the recommendation of another reviewer, I used the mini chocolate chips!  I got rave reviews from family and friends! I say BAKE IT!

My 12 year old daughter made this for Thanksgiving.  It was super simple and a huge hit, not one piece was left over.  They couldn't believe she made it all by herself.

I was hoping to make a cheesecake that didn't require a ton of cream cheese. This recipe fit the bill when it called for 2 "blocks" (which I did have on hand). After reading some of the reviews, I did decide to decrease the amount of chocolate chips (probably ended up being somewhere between 1/2 - 1/3 cup). I also did not have a full sleeve of graham crackers, so ended up substituting crushed vanilla wafers. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as it was written. It turned out great! I wanted to sample a piece in the worst way when I pulled the cheesecake out of the oven after 50 minutes. But I did wait. Everyone loved the cheesecake, though I think my husband will probably drizzle some of his homemade dark chocolate sauce over the top of his next piece.

I thought the choco chips were too much, at first, but as the cheesecake chilled longer (really the next day), I started to really fall in love with it. I made another a few days later.  The only problem- you have to wait sooo long to cool it before you can eat it :)

This cheesecake kicks butt!  My family loved it.  It was so easy to make and turned out so well.  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.  There was only one peice left the next day and it was even better after sitting in the fridge overnight.  I am making this again for sure.  Thanks, Barb in BC Canada

Very rich and delicious but a bit heavy. I think maybe mini morsels would improve it. But it got good reviews in my house as is.

My boyfriend doesn't even like cheesecake, but he liked this one.  Got raving reviews from everyone who tried it!  Only change I made was I used Oreo Baking Crumbs to make my crust.  I found this tasted best after I let it cool an hour after taking it out of the oven, refrigerate overnight, and serve at room temperature.

I used this recipe for our family Easter dinner!  I cut the amount of chocolate chips needed in half and substituded mini egg shaped colored whopper candies.  Everyone loved the taste and colors!

Admittedly, I'm a novice cook and have never tried to make a cheesecake before but I was somewhat disappointed in the result.  The consistency of the cake was not as creamy or soft as I would have liked.  It was a bit stiff and all of the chocolate chips settled to the bottom.  Is this recipe missing an ingredient?  Would sour cream help with the consistency?

The cheesecake was very delicious! However, I did not have chocolate graham crackers so I combined cocoa powder, regular graham cracker crumbs, the sugar, and the melted butter. Also, while my friend and I were making the cheesecake- I accidentally added 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract instead of 1 teaspoon. The cheesecake had a very... different taste but I'm sure it would have been delicious if I didn't make that mistake. Very rich though =)

It was good, but not as good as I hoped. Something was lacking, but I don't quite know what. I didn't have chocolate graham crackers so I used regular with cocoa powder, which turned out fine. I added more brown sugar, extra vanilla, and some salt to the cream cheese mixture. Never make anything without salt. I baked it for 45 minutes and thought the edges were slightly overdone and the middle slightly underdone. Perhaps a different temperature would fix this?

This was such an easy recipe for someone who has never made cheesecake before. I used a pre-prepared crust and followed the filling recipe exactly as provided. I made it for my parents visiting from out of town and they absolutely LOVED it.

made a few flavoring changes to this recipe putting my own spin on it, but this recipe overall is a good one. maybe a bit light on the crust, depending on how high up the sides of the pan you like it (i got it just 1" or so up the side). otherwise, delicious!

This is a great recipe but I would need to double it as it was mostly crust, so that was a bummer, but I did bake in a spring form pan, though it should have been approximate to the recipe pan size called for.

The end product is wonderful, and it takes very little time to make!  Even the future in-laws loved it!  I serve it with some leftover chocolate chips on top and some chocolate syrup.  A great end to any meal.

I’m not a cheesecake fan but the family liked it! Cut back on the chocolate chips (2/3 c.) and used a pre-made chocolate graham pie crust per other reviews. Some say the chocolate made the cheesecake better, others that they prefer a more traditional cheesecake, but all around they still felt it tasted very good. Baking time for me was more like 45 minutes, was a little overdone by 48 minutes.

I've been using this site regularly for years now. This is my first review! This recipe is incredible. Once chilled, It's like eating chocolate chip cookie dough right from the tube! Didn't change a thing on the cheesecake, but used graham crackers, sugar, butter and a little cocoa for crust because that's all I had on hand. Didn't matter, it was still amazing! This is a keeper!!

Easy to make and delicious!  I made it with a graham cracker crust because that's what I had available.  I used Graham Cracker Crust I recipe (minus cinnamon) which turned out great!

Made as is, except used milk-chocolate chips.  They did not sink to the bottom, they stayed evenly throughout the cheesecake.  It tasted like a chocolate chip cookie with the hint of cheescake.. YUMMY, I will make this again.

This was my first time making cheesecake and it was a good experience. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used a pre-made pie crust, plain. I was awesome, but next time I might try chocolate. I used the entire amount of semi-sweet chocolate chips in the the batter and then after it cooked, as soon as it came out of the oven, I sprinkled more chips on top so they would slightly melt and stick the to top. I let it cool on the counter for an hour before putting it in the fridge overnight. It came out perfectly, it is dense with the chips spread from top to bottom evenly (not sure why some reviewers said theirs fell to the bottom??) I will make this again for sure!

I've made this twice.  The first time, I followed the directions exactly.  The second time, I used mini chocolate chips and made individual cheesecake cupcakes, which I took to work.  They were a hit.  There's a farmer's market near my home, and an Amish family makes the BEST chocolate chip cheesecake.  I haven't been able to duplicate it yet, but this comes pretty darn close.

I would not recommend this recipe, the chocolate chips all mixed in, do not make a good looking desert. It tasted ok, next time i'll keep the chocolate out.

This has a great flavor, but I was disappointed with how it looked.  The consistency was very crumbly (impossible to serve gracefully!), and the chocolate chips sank to the bottom.

FANTABULOUS!  This recipe is super easy and delicious.  I've served this at 3 separate events and now...everyone wants me to bring this recipe!  To make it even quicker, you can use pre-made graham cracker crusts.  I've also done this with just plain white sugar instead of brown and tastes/looks great!

I would definitely make this again, however use less chocolate chips!  Also the tip to coat the chips lightly with flour worked!  My chocolate chips did not sink to the bottom...thanks to whomever posted that tip.  So as I was saying,  use 1/4 to 1/2 less chips than listed in the ingredients, unless you LOVE chocolate.  This was a super rich recipe...and will probably need milk or water to wash it down.  Other than that, you cannot go wrong with this recipe!

So simple! 2/3 cup of DARK chocolate chips made this recipe even more amazing! A full cup of chips would have been too much. Dusting them with flour prevented them from sinking as others have suggested. We made them in cupcake cups by distributing the amount of crumbs and batter, making 18 normal size mini cheesecakes. Baked them for 12-15 minutes. Easy to freeze and grab when wanted! Will make again definitely!

Easy and very good.  I accidentaly bought low fat cream cheese, but it turned out fine.  The hint about dusting the chocolate chips with flour works well too.

Made this as directed and it was just okay. 50 minutes was a bit too long for the bake time and the brown sugar was overpowering. I'll probably look for a different recipe next time.

Very creamy and delicious.  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi -sweet and it was great.  I have requests to make more pies for the holidays.
