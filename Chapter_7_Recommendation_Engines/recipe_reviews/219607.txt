This is really a lovely recipe! The subtle layering of flavors and the perfect contrast between sweet and tart were heavenly. This will be replacing my nice, but boring old standard recipe. I followed to the letter however, must admit to using a black cherry/cranberry juice blend I found. My only, albeit slight, issue with this recipe is it was a tad 'loose' so I would reduce the juice accordingly next time to allow the sauce to gel a bit thicker. Thank you so much for sharing this gem!

Good balance of tart and sweet.  I actually served this warm, instead of cooling it down to top pork chops.  Only alteration to the recipe was a little cornstarch/water mixture to thicken it some.  Would recommend!

Wonderful.  Because I like the flavor of orange zest I *was* going to zest some orange peel into it.  Not finding my zester, I said "What the heck?" and quartered an orange and threw it in the pot with the rest of the ingredients. I let the sauce cook down before removing from the heat; and I left the orange quarters but removed before serving. I buy ground korintje cinnamon in bulk, so I used that rather than a cinnamon stick.  Absolutely delicious (and let me throw in a plug for buying cinnamon other than what one picks up in the grocery store.  you will not believe the difference in the flavor!)

I made this tonight and wow, is it ever delicious!  The two fruits are really great combined, and the cinnamon and allspice are perfect.  Nothing overwhelms other flavors.  I can't do sugar being diabetic, so used "diet" cranberry juice and substituted agave syrup for the brown sugar (not sure how much, just a really good squeeze).  I prefer things to be more tart than sweet, so this was perfect.  I also didn't measure exactly 6 oz. of cherries, but sort of estimated since I had no scale and just went by the approximate weight of what I bought in bulk today.  I ate some, too, so who knows if exactly 6 ounces wound up in there, LOL!  It came out wonderfully, and my roommate, who doesn't even like cranberry, said it smelled so good that she had to try it...and she loved it! It was a little juicy, but thickened up nicely as it cooled.

I made this for the first time today and it was an instant hit!  Loved the combination of cranberries and cherries, which made it taste familiar yet very different than the run-of-the-mill cranberry sauce I would normally make.  I will definitely serve this again next year, if not before.  One note of caution, though:  I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and added a bit of cornstarch and water to the recipe, which made it jell to the consistency I wanted.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

This was the first time I made homemade cranberry sauce  ever, and it was so easy and delicious.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone really loved it.  Even my husband, who only eats the canned jelly sauce, liked it, and my mother, who can be very difficult to please, requested that I bring it to Christmas dinner.  This is definitely going to be a regular offering at holiday dinners!  The only difference I made was that I added maybe two more ounces of tart Montgomery cherries (total 8ozs instead of 6ozs) because the bag came in 8ozs and it was just easier to use the whole thing, but I compensated by adding slightly more cranberries.  Was amazing in the end!

I had never made cranberry sauce before, and last Thanksgiving I decided to give it a go. I looooove cherries so when I spotted this recipe I had to try it. This is without question the best cranberry sauce I've ever had. I didn't have cinnamon sticks so just used "regular" from the jar. My son doesn't really like cranberry sauce (though he will eat a little to be polite!). I made it while he was at work and when he walked in the door, he couldn't stop saying how great it smelled! When we were getting dinner together the next day, he opened the container and took a taste. I had to pry the dish from him or he'd have eaten the whole thing! I would have made a double batch if I had known he would like it so much. It's sweet, it's tart, it's perfect. I can't believe I didn't do a review on this sooner!! We tried a few new things last Thanksgiving, and I'm so glad this was one of them. I will make this every year, and I'm sure it will be a tradition for him when he has a family of his own. Thanks for sharing it!

11.21.19  I used Ocean Spray® 5 Calorie Cranberry Drink (what was in the fridge) instead of their cranberry juice cocktail and cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup (personal taste preference).  The combination of dried cherries, fresh cranberries, and cranberry drink really works, and for us, this had the perfect balance of sweet-tart.  Simply put, it’s full-bodied, vibrant, and not excessively sweet.  I’ve made a lot of cranberry sauce recipes on this site, and this one ranks right up there at the top.

I love this recipe, I made one change. Instead of cranberry juice cocktail, I use cranberry cherry juice cocktail. Wonderful!

Very good and easy recipe. Followed as written. To me, the allspice gave this an interesting flavor. Tasted like something my European grandmother from Germany would have made.  It is not watery, but not thickened either, next time I might try adding some cornstarch to thicken just a bit. It would be good without the addition of allspice too, but the allspice does give it a holiday feel. Gave it 4 stars because it is not my favorite cranberry sauce, but this is very good.

I made this recipe several years back and now it is a family favorite on my Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's table. I'll never use another recipe for Cranberries.
I wish I could can it.

Best cranberry sauce I have made...and I have tried many from this site.  I tried making this with both all-natural, no sugar added dried cherries...and then the regular sugar sweetened ones.  The sugar sweetened ones in it were much better...just too tart otherwise.
