I am always searching for great guacamole recipes, so I gave this one a try. It really works!! Who would have ever thought that 'soy sauce' was the secret ingredient to great guacamole?!!

Very good.  Soy sauce gave it a richer and deeper flavor than the usual salt.  I always keep this brand in the house for soy sauce, so i tried it with our mexican dinner.  Everyone enjoyed it.

So good!!  I didn't feel there was anything missing from this recipe, but then again, I think avacados are great all by themselves. The soy sauce gave the guac a really nice flavor. Thank you!

I loved this recipe as is.  I might try adding a little sour cream next time just to make it a tad creamier.
