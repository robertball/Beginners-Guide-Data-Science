My fiance made this dish for me and it turned out to be one of my favourites yet.  Easy and delicious!  I would recommend using more than the 1 lbs of asparagus though.  There was plenty of sauce to go around.

I made this for Easter dinner.  I adjusted the recipe as follows:  4 lbs asparagus, 2 cups reduced fat sour cream, 3 Tbsp butter, 1.5 cups bread crumbs, 3Tbsp horseradish, garlic powder, salt, pepper to taste.  I quadrupled the asparagus called for, and only added 1/2 cup more sour cream, and everyone thought there was more than enough sauce.  The entire thing took less than 20 minutes to assemble and cook.

Really good and different way to prepare asparagus.  As others have said you could use more asparagus because there was more than enough sauce.  Be careful not to burn them at the end.

i was so disappointed in this.  i absolutely loved the sauce - before i put it on the asparagus and then broiled it.  something happened to the consistency of it when it went in the oven.  it looked terrible.  i won't make this one again.  i do, however, think that the sour cream/horseradish mixture would be great as a sauce on top of a burger or roast beef sandwich.

Unlike the previous review, this was a huge Christmas success!  I used the recommended ingredients and followed the recipe to the letter, and I got nothing but compliments!  It was delicious and simple - I highly recommend it!

This is AWESOME; easy, quick and a beautiful presentation.  Will make again and would be great for a lovely holiday dish to bring and share. (I did decrease the amounts of the sour cream sauce and could have halved that portion of the recipe.)

Very delicious, quick, and easy. I made half the amount of sauce and it was the perfect amount. The crispiness of the bread crumbs is amazing. I would definitely make this for guests because it looks appealing as well.

This is a wonderful way to do asparagus; definitely a keeper! After reading the reviews about all the sauce, I cut back on the sour cream to 1 cup and kept the horseradish the same. Due to a wheat allergy, I had to find a gluten-free alternative to the bread crumbs, so I used finely chopped/ground nuts. Very easy to make, too.

Love Love Love this! I do tend to add just a bit more horseradish and black pepper to the sauce but it is a great EASY side for sure! :)

I don't like asparagus, but liked this.  I broiled for 2-3 min, but I have a gas oven and let the rack be on the second setting.  Yummy!

Quick, easy and delicious, this was a terrific accompaniment to our beef roast!  You were right about the broiling, for sure; our dish didn't take nearly the 3 minutes recommended in the recipe.  This was great, though -- thank you so much for sharing it!!

I have made this quite often, no substitutions and it always turns out well. Never any leftovers!

Delicious recipe and went great with our steak. I made it exactly as listed and my anti-veggie husband even ate a decent amount. The next day I reheated the leftovers and it was still tasty.

You can definitely halve the sauce and be fine.  The horseradish flavor was almost lost.  Also very sour-creamy.  I think this could be improved by halving the sauce so you don't waste it, doubling the horseradish, and maybe subbing in some mayo.  Made for Western Region Allstars Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

This was not my favorite asparagus topping, but I tried it with string beans at Thanksgiving and really loved it. I didn't use all the sauce, since it is quite strong. My family liked it also, thus the 5 stars.

Didn't turn out at all on Christmas Day of all days.  Substituted fresh asparagus was the first mistake.  Second was too much horseradish and not enough sour cream.  With all the other items watched, the asparagus was forgotten by a phone call from Mom in PA.  Oh, well...don't think I will try this again, but it sounded good.

I loved this recipe! I was looking for a quick side dish and this was fantastic. Great with pork tenderloin.
