Absolutely leave out the beef boullion!  I've never had a Caesar this way.  Rim the glass with celery salt and instead of the celery stalk, try a dilly bean for some added punch.

I like this recipe.  Watch out for the salty taste.  Don't forget the dill weed.  Makes a big difference.  Very good recipe.

I'm used to Caesars having a little more kick to it so I added a small bit of creamed horseradish.   I don't know if the beef powder was needed.

I've seen this recipe using tomato/beef juice INSTEAD of tomato/clam juice, it's a Bloody Bull. I wouldn't recommend combining the flavors, though, too salty.

you can rim the glass with a Caesar rim or Celery Salt.  Squeeze a lemon wedge in and add, this is a must!  I've also never used beef bouillon.  I've been known to add horseradish or even Montreal Steak Spice.  Add a spicy pickled bean for garnish, or a shrimp on a skewer

I definitely prefer it without the beef bouillon powder. Add a few drops of lime juice, or a twist of lime.

I get the idea of wanting the beef flavor, but the bouillon powder does not dissolve in cold liquid, so you have unattractive powder floating on top.  Either heat a bit of water and dissolve the powder or use some beef broth.
