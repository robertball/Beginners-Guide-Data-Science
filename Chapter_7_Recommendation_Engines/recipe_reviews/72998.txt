I also live in a high altitude area, one hour north of Denver. Baking desserts is sometimes precarious. Thanks for this exceptional recipe for Angel Food Cake. The directions were easy to follow. I was surprised how quicky the batter came together. The only little change I made was using 1/2 teaspoon almond extract rather than the lemon. Lo and behold this cake was moist, flavorful, and much more substantial than boxed or store bought Angel Food. I cooked up a cup of frozen raspberries, 1/2 cup sugar, and a tablespoon of cornstarch making a sauce to pour over the cake. My family loved it. This should do well in lower altitudes if the egg whites are whipped longer, and 1/4 cup less flour is used. This was my first attempt at home made Angel Food, and it turned out great!

I forgot to mention that it is VERY helpful to line the bottom of your pan with parchment paper or waxed paper. I usually fold the paper in half, then in half again... and then cut it to look like a slice of pizza (using the radius of the pan to measure.) Once I have the right size, I'll cut the bottom for the center hole. This helps avoid leaving 1/2 of the cake in the pan. It tastes good either way, but it is prettier when it stays in one piece.

Absolutely delightful!  This is my first stab at angel food cake baking.  I researched and tried a recipe two nights ago from Allrecipes.com and it was a huge dud.  Coarse texture, almost tough and not good taste.  I then made this recipe the  next night and oh the difference.  I live in Thornton, Colorado, a north suburb of Denver, so the high altitude is always a challenge for cake baking.  This recipe, however, has been adapted for our altitude and was amazing.  Rose well, light texture, amazing taste.  I took it for my friend's birthday cake and the 5 of ate and ate.  I also used a recipe from Allrecipes for buttercream icing that was incredible.  It is now our new favorite cake recipe, bumping dark chocolate cake out of first place!

Amazing cake!  I live in the Denver area and this turned out great at our high altitude.  I used A.P. flour and almond extract instead of lemon, and it's light, fluffy, and delicious! Wonderful recipe.

This was my first time ever to make a home-made angel food cake & it turned out great! I live in Denver & this recipe works for the altitude! I didn't have cake flour so I used 1 cup and 3 Tablespoons of regular flour & it still turned out fantastic! Great with frest fruit!

This is a fool-proof recipe!  I finished the batter and stuck the cake in the oven and while cleaning up the dishes, I came across 1/2 cup of egg whites that I had accidently omitted from the recipe!!  It still came out great.  I'm sure with the appropriate amount of egg whites, the cake would have been even lighter and fluffier; but, like I said it was still great.  I did use almond instead of lemon, but I'm sure either would've been wonderful.

I love this cake. I live in Fort Collins Co just outside the Foot hills and this worked perfectly for me. I did increase the sugar to 1 1/4 cup and it was perfect

I live at 7,300 ft in northern NM and made the recipe with just a bit more flour.  I should have upped the temp to 350F, then 400F because it didn't rise as much or brown as quickly as it should.  Needed an extra 10 min.  Will try again, though.

This recipe worked wonderfully! It didn't *deflate*. It does use a LOT of egg whites though...

I live in Wyoming and this was a great, I added some lemon zest and it made the cake even better.  I used a butter cream to top it.

It was pretty good. It kind of had a sour flavor to it so it would probably be better to add a little more sugar. Also, make sure you sift the flour into the batter because it will stay clumpy when you put it into there. Have a lot of eggs on hand!

It turned out great!  I am not a huge fan of the lemon extract but it still tasted good.

I haven’t made this recipe yet… but I want to! I have only ever made one angel food cake and it was out of a box. We just moved to Colorado Springs from Nebraska and the cake did not turn out ha! I never thought about the altitude … SO! We are around 800 feet higher. What do you recommend me to do to alter the recipe?!

Thanks! Happy Baking!

I live at just over 6000 feet.  Despite ever website I could find insisting that you MUST use a tube pan, I wanted a layered cake, so I decided to try using regular pans.  (I am a rebel like that!). I baked the recipe in three 6” heart-shaped,  ungreased pans lined with parchment.  I also put an ungreased large piping tip in the center of each pan (note — the filler tip works the best.  I also used 1M tips).  I filled each pan 3/4 full.  I otherwise made the recipe EXACTLY as written, down to the number of minutes baked.  It worked perfectly!!!!  I inverted the pans onto a cooling rack straight out of the oven, like you would with any cake.   I would absolutely make this again!

I've never made an Angel Food Cake before, but had whites from 10 eggs left over after making a flan, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm in Aurora CO and was pretty happy to find a recipe the I wouldn't have to do all the math myself to adjust for altitude. I made the cake exactly as instructed, except for the cake flour & lemon extract... I didn't have either. For the four, I used 1 1/3 all purpose flour minus 2 tlbs and 2 tsp ( that's 1 tsp short of 3 tlbs), and replaced it with cornstarch. I then sifted the flour/cornstarch mix 4 times (one short of the instructions I found on JoytheBaker's blog).  Instead of the Lemon Extract, I used almond. I baked it in a tube pan with no lining or grease. I ran a knife along all the edges before removing the cake. It came out beautiful and delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

The cake wasn't done after the prescribed cooking time, and I checked my oven to confirm the temperature.  I think you might want to cook the cake until it is brown and cracked on top.

We raise chickens so I make a lot of angel food cakes with all the egg whites, and this is by far the worst ever!   I double checked to see if I omitted any ingredients, but found I'd followed the recipe to the letter.
