Thanks! But I would also suggest to use half the amount of ginger .For eg.garlic-4oz,ginger-2oz..so that the paste is better and more tastier!Thanks for posting anyway!

FYI you can get Ggarlic ginger paste at any Indian foods market The brand I use is Vimal.
Just call your local Indian restaurant and ask them where the nearest market is.  They will be glad to help.

Five stars (with reservations!) - This was excellent for use in Indian butter chicken recipe.  But as a general health warning -- garlic infused in oil should NEVER be kept at room temperature or stored in the refrigerator for long periods of time -- it can lead to botulism poisoning. Use this ginger-garlic paste immediately or store in the freezer for future use. The jarred varieties you find in the store all have preservatives in them for just this reason.

This was a bit time consuming to make, but the paste is such a handy thing to have around! I made three parts garlic to four parts ginger so the ginger isn't too overwhelming.

Thank you for creating this recipe.  I went to several markets to find this paste and thought the same thing:  I could make it myself.  Well, it turned out very good!

EASY EASY EASY!!! What a money saver! I can't understand someone having a hard time making this. I used a veggie peeler on refrigerated ginger root (took maximum of 2 mins!!!), and pre minced garlic, with extra LIGHT olive oil as not to interfere with the flavors. Took me about 5 mins total, if that! Wish everything could be homemade this easily! Thanks!

Used for Butter Chicken, and used jarred ginger and garlic. I'm sure fresh would have been better, but this def served it's purpose!

Nice try, proportions are good, but olive oil is not an authentic flavor for this, use sunflower, avocado or other flavorless seed oil. Also, turmeric, powdered or fresh adds the dimension found in the real thing, in this recipe, a level tsp dry, 2 tsps peeled, grated fresh turmeric. Use keywords like 'Indian' to find more authentic recipes, they are out there.

Love it. It's great because on most recipes where there is garlic and ginger, the recipe calls for about equal parts of both every time. So I just combine the amount of garlic and ginger needed and voila! This paste has saved me a lot of chopping time on about 5 occasions so far. So simple I never would have thought of it on my own. ;-)

I've bought ginger garlic paste from the store lots of times and this recipe is much cheaper and just as good as any store version. Thanks.

This helps--I want to make garlic paste to store in freezer--harvesting garlic from my garden right now. So simple! I'll just skip the ginger part of it. Thanks!

I have been looking around everywhere and couldn't find ginger garlic paste in any grocery store around here! I was sooo glad I found this recipe.It is great. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars, is the time it took to make. Peeling all the garlic and ginger was such a draag! (probably because I am a lazy person and like things fast!lol)But all in all, I was finally able to make the chicken curry that I've been wanting to make for sooo long! thnx!

Top tip from a top Indian chef (not me) freeze the paste in ice cube trays and cover in film.  Lasts for months.

Very easy recipe.  I made a half recipe of this to make vegetable biryani, and kept the remainder in the fridge.
