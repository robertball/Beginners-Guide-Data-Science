The cobbler turned out very nicely! I used erythritol instead of coconut sugar and needed to add a bit more liquid (I used kefir instead of buttermilk).  For fruits I used a mix of blackberries, raspberries, blueberries and nectarines, probably 3 cups.  Hubby didn't even ask if it was GF!!

I’ve never made a cobbler before, but I wanted one that used gluten free  flours. I had to make some substitutions, as we didn’t have coconut sugar or coconut flour.  I used a 2 qt casserole, but I think it was too deep. That with the lack of coconut sugar, flour, made the baking time really long. But, it was DELICIOUS! I did add more sugar than it called for.

This was delicious! I made it with an equal parts combination of blackberries and strawberries, and my gluten free flour was cup4cup, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was great! The top added a great crunch to the delicious berries!
