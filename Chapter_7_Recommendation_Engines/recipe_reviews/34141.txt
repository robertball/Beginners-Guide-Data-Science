This was very good! My husband loved it, and my 10 year old son loved it. In fact the 2 were arguing over who got the last piece! The marinade reduced nicely for a great sauce. Only change I made was to use all of the marinade instead of half, and am glad I did.

A great marinated chicken recipe. I would recommend adding some more tarragon before serving. The vermouth flavor is just delicious! I served it with rice pilaf & a cucumber salad. Yum!

This chicken indeed has an unusual flavor, but the tarragon is the main component of the taste, after the salt.  The amount of lemon pepper is the culprit, I believe, for the excess saltiness in the flavor, especially since the marinade liquid cooks down and contentrates.  I made this recipe exactly as directed, and it does yield nicely colored BLSL chicken.  I made it because I had some vermouth, and I was curious to know how it would do in cooking.  The vermouth flavor was there, but in spite of the amount, it did not overpower the other flavors.  I would recommend using ground black pepper, lemon zest and salt, as a replacement for the lemon pepper, in order to control the saltiness of the dish.

I made this recipe, with the only substitution being 1.5tbsp dried tarragon instead of fresh.  After marinating about 24 hours, I grilled it, but the vermouth never really cooked out.  I didn't think it was horrible, but I won't make it again.

I made this tonight for my family.  I used fresh tarragon from my garden.  It was a big hit with everyone and not a bit of it was leftover.  I did follow the advice of another reviewer and added all the marinade in the pan.  Glad I did because everyone wanted the sauce spooned over their chicken.

I won't be making this again.  I used thin sliced chicken breasts and grilled them. In the amount of time they took to cook, the alcohol did not cook out.  Oddly enough, my 2 year ate it without complaint but me, my husband and my 5 year old didn't like it.

I liked this and have made it a few times, although my husband is not the biggest fan.

This was very good.  Some time I would like to double the marinade and marinate a whole cut up chicken and grill or bake it.  Got to have the fresh tarragon or don't bother.  I served with the Walnut Green Beans from this site.

when I dipped a piece of bread into the  reduced marinade I was very pleased.....my litmus test is always a piece of bread into the sauce, gravy, marinade etc....unfortunately the chicken lacked the punch that I expected and I'm not even sure what purpose the lemon pepper was suppose to serve....was the meal edible.....yes....would I make it again.....NO
