I just made these and the chocolate filling was so runny that we had to shovel the mixture out of the pan. The resulting slop was very tasty though!!

These cookies were so delicious! I thought that even 1/4 teaspoon of Almond Extract was a little much though, if I made them again I wouldn't put in quite that much.  By sight, they don't look like they would be that chocolaty, and I was disappointed at first because I thought it looked too oaty, but they weren't.  I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone as a wonderful switch up from brownies or your classic chocolate chip cookie.

These are fudgey and very sweet.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, and accidentally put the almond in the crust batter so I also put it in the filling.  It was a bit much - not a knock against the recipe, just a warning not to add more almond than it calls for.

I think these would be really good with part of the shortening replaced by peanut butter and chopped peanuts instead of walnuts.  The filling would also be amazing if it were caramel instead of chocolate.

A word of caution - don't run the filling all the way to the edges.  I'd recommend pressing the crust up around the edges and keep the filling toward the middle.  Mine ran over a little bit.  Luckily, since I thought the pan looked a bit overfull, I put a sheet of aluminum foil on the rack beneath to catch anything that might bubble over.  Not a lot, but something to keep in mind.

Overall these were good, and with a few tweaks I'd make them again.

I made the recipe exactly as written then had to add 2 T of water to the oatmeal/flour mix to make it useable.  It looked promising going into the oven, but even with 10 extra minutes of baking, the bottom never cooked and I can't get anything out of the pan.  You would have to eat this with a spoon.  Off to make something else for my son's birthday tomorrow.

These were wonderful! I used white chocolate chips (I was out of regular chocolate chips) and I forgot to add the Almond Extract but they turned out great. They would also be great with peanut butter chips.

Kind of bitter surprisingly. Also kind of dry.

These were pretty good..husband loved them.  They looked good.  I put them in a slightly smaller pan and added 5 min. to baking time. I would increase the vanilla...don't like almond....next time to 1 tsp. I think i'd try butter also for more flavor. I think some were having trouble with a dry crust if they used instant oatmeal or small grain...use the old fashioned rolled oats..they're big.

Because of all the comments regarding the crust being dry I got a little scared and used the crust from a date bar recipe found here at all recipes.  The fudge filling was delicious and a big hit with the family.  I used vanilla instead of almond. I will make it again and try the crust recipe however I would make it with butter and never shortening.  That could be the problem people are having.  I just didn't want to take the chance as these were going to be served on Christmas Eve.

Very good, rich and gooey.  I left out the almond flavoring because I am not a fan of that flavor.

These turned out great. I found the amount of almond extract to be perfect -- very mild; and I'm generally pretty sensitive to things like that.  The dough WAS dry, like another viewer commented. However, I just added 2 tablespoons of water and it turned out fine. In the future I would add the water at the same time I add the eggs and also I might use butter/marg instead of shortening to make them even more savory and irresistable. Thanks for a great recipe!
