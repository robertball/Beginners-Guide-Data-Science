I followed this recipe closely, with the exception of two changes. The first was that I added an extra 1/4 cup of maple syrup to the brown sugar/margarine mixture to ensure there was enough to coat the top after it was assembled (didn't want "dry tops" like the first reviewer). 

The other change is that I used thick cut bacon (8 slices) and "candied" it first by pressing dark brown sugar liberally onto both sides and sprinkling it with cayenne pepper (this is also referred to as Billionaire's Bacon). Lay it on a cookie sheet lined with foil and bake it in the over at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. Allow it to cool on parchment and then chop it up into pieces. Overall, it was the perfect combination of smoky, salty and sweet (with just a TOUCH of heat). While all of it was good, the inside pieces were gooey and delicious. We will definitely make this again!

This came out very good, and no dry top at all.  I didn't increase the maple syrup, and all of the caramel topping came out with the monkey bread.  I did remove it from a nonstick bundt pan at 20 minutes, it was too hot to work with any earlier.  I needed to bake it another 8 minutes to bake all the bread through.  
I used butter since I don't use margarine at all, added a teaspoon of madagascar bourbon vanilla & chopped pecans along with the bacon crumbles.  It took me longer than expected to prep.  Next time I may forego adding the left over cinnamon sugar to the maple sauce, since it came out very sweet and already has an incredible amount of sugar in it.

YUMMO!  I made this yesterday!  Thoroughly enjoyed the one taste I got!  The kids and hubby gobbled it up.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.  NOTE:  I had no problem with the carmel staying on top and oozing down sides making it absolutely a delish and decadent treat.

My dad always made something very similar to this every Christmas, but honestly, I like this recipe better! It is gooey and sweet, with a nice salty contrast from the bacon. I didn’t make any changes to the recipe (I think it's perfect as is), but to ensure that the top didn't get dry and hard like my dad's always did, I put a piece of foil on top in the last 10 minutes of baking. Perfect! I'm sure I'll be making it again!

I made a half-batch in a loaf pan (fit perfectly), and followed the recipe very closely.  Made one substitution of brown sugar to white sugar with 1 T molasses (2 T for full recipe).  Took to a work breakfast potluck and it was a HIT!  Once flipped, the top was very gooey/saucy, and the bottom was dry-er; it fit everyone's taste preferences!  There was NONE leftover and many colleagues requested the recipe.

Made this for Xmas breakfast and it was the most popular thing on the table. Even my super picky nephew loved it. The only change I made was to bake my bacon in the oven (425 deg F for 20 mins) so that it was all done at once. Came together faster because while the bacon was doing its thing, I could cut and coat the biscuits and make the caramel and then when the bacon was done, it was all ready to assemble. This is going to be a staple for Xmas breakfast in my house from now on!

I made this recipe this morning and it was a real winner. In the future I will use about twice as much beacon and/or add crushed pecans to the recipe. The bottom line is this one is a keeper.

this is great! Monkey bread is a big deal in my house, and every new and interesting combination is a hit (you should try our Savory and not sweet -  Jalepeno Popper monkey bread! :)) Anyhow, couple of things that work for me and my family that I do differently ... I'd use butter versus margarine.  and in place of maple..  honey :) I also recommend thinking about how your family likes their bacon... really crisp, or a bit softer? If softer,  I use frozen bacon and chop into smallish pieces before frying no need to crumble if they're small enough and not so crunchy, all about what the family likes right?
:)

I made just a little more topping to pour over the bread.  It was wonderful as is or with the extra umph.  Fast, easy, inexpensive, delicious.  What more could you want?

It was good but the bacon adds an unusual taste to it. NOT bad, but is better without bacon in my opinion

It is pretty sweet especially when you get a piece of the sugar and maple syrup.  Wow.  Baking for 35 min. in my oven was not quite long enough.  I had to do about 40 min.

I made this ,this morning.  I substituted frozen bread dough,thawed, as I had it on hand.  I also substituted light brown sugar for the dark, for the same reason.  This was absolutely my favorite recipe from All Recipes.  Sticky hands Down!

Good flavor but I wasn't a fan of the dry tops.  To bad there isn't a way to get the caramel to stay on top after you drizzle it on.  I loved the bottom pieces!

I made this exactly as written and will definitely make it again.  I am pretty much a scratch baker so not a fan of convenience products and shied away because of the canned biscuits. I made this for Father's Day 2017, and we loved it, a big hit for all.  Give it a try!

Take some extra time and make your own brioche dough, and omit the refrigerator biscuits, then follow recipe.  Very tasty.

Yummy, I added small pieces of craft Carmel also. And, used butter not margarine. Could have left it out the Carmel, because the sauce sets up nicely.

Yes, I will surely make it again.  I had made a big batch of crumbled bacon for use in a couple different recipes so did not measure what I put in the monkey bread, which was more than what was needed. Everyone loved it!

Made with basic yeast bread dough from my bread maker - turned out great! but was a bit more work - will try again with refrigerated biscuit dough. Used a pizza cutter to cut the dough as other reviewers have mentioned, which made it very quick and easy. I put it all together in the bundt pan the night before, covered and refrigerated overnight, in the morning I warmed the sauce and spooned it over while the oven preheated, then baked as directed so the bread was warm for Easter morning. Making another pan for dessert!

Followed others’ advice to candy the bacon, added chopped toasted pecans to the bacon crumble, halved the recipe and baked in a muffin tin for mini single servings. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was EXCELLENT.

I used frozen biscuit dough as directed and it was greasy.  I used frozen bread dough and it was much better.  Just follow directions for thawing if it is frozen.

What drew me in was the maple. I'm not a big fan of bacon, so I left it out and used pecans. I hate being that person who changes recipes then reviews, but the maple flavor in the caramel was so yummy.

Used a little less butter instead of margarine and made up the difference with bacon fat. Also added a little ginger and cloves.

I love this recipe because I am not a baker, so it helped me feel accomplished in an area which I am not proficient .  I made it as suggested, except I added chopped pecans to the top. In the future I will use maple flavoring and real butter, and flaky biscuits, instead of buttermilk (that's what I had in the fridge). This recipe is fantastic- great for brunch, breakfast or dessert.

Incredible ! Taste testers approved. I’m always taking new baking recipes to my puppies vet. The girls are awesome. It was like singing chorus of omg omg omg.  This monkey bread STAYED gooey pull apart. Not stuck and hard like regular ones. The maple syrup and DARK brown sugar are the key. Bacon. I do it in microwave in between paper towels. No grease no cleanup crispy bacon. 

About the pan, yes a bundt ‘style ‘pan is needed. I don’t have. I improvised. Used heavy duty Reynolds aluminum foil. Lined my 2 piece angle food pan, massive lining.  Again no clean up, no leaks. Did not stock to cake. I wanted a one person size serving. For me. I took a high sided sauce pan. Again. Massively lined with foil. I made a cone for middle. Firm like you would a foil ball, but mine was cone shaped. It looked hilarious. It worked incredibly good. So, no bundt pan. Get creative and use foil ! No need to spray and comes off if you let cool about 5 minute then flip and remove foil. Have fun making and eating. It’s essy and incredible !

My husband said " DO NOT lose that recipe".    We loved it!!.   Next time, I will probably add a little more bacon and a little less syrup.     Make sure you "dump" it into a large pie plate type dish, the syrup will run.

I made this for my other half a couple days late for his birthday. We were on a birthday trip that didn't include cake :( It was a great recipe. I made the dough using my kitchen aid mixer and followed the manufacturer's directions using these ingredients. I did let it rise after assembling for about 30 minutes.

I've made this twice and it's to die for!  I used thick bacon this time and liked biting into more substantial pieces of salty flavor.  This bread makes for a nice presentation on the table and slices well.  I will only make when I have company as it is too hard to resist for my husband and me.  So good!!

A new favorite in our house!  I made the recipe as written 
 At first I thought  that it would tricky and take a long time to make the sugar syrup. I was wrong! It couldn't be easier!  It only takes a minute or two to make it. The whole recipe is quick, easy,  and delicious!

Absolutely perfect! My husband loved it.  Perfect amount of sweet & salty flavors.  I used a one-gallon storage bag for the biscuit/sugar/cinnamon mixture and it coated them perfectly with no sugar mix leftover.  The top does get a little crusty while baking, but softens up with the glaze when you dump it on a plate.  This will be my new go-to holiday breakfast treat.  Should be easy to prep most ingredients the night before and bake up quickly the next day.  Deliciousness!

Way too sweet! Will try again using less sugar and like the idea of peppering the bacon. Monkey bread is fun so worth experimenting.

Not only did I make this but I made it in a Crock Pot, and it was wonderful. My brother asks it there was any of the sauce left over.  I too the recipe for Crock Pot Monkey Bread and applied this on.

Wow Amazing! Used 3 tubes of biscuit dough, next time I'll cook all 4 tubes of dough as there was plenty of sweet syrup sauce. Maybe bake lil longer so all the dough in the middle gets cooked and rises more. Made in DeMarle Bundt flexipan turned out onto serving plate perfect.

I love this recipe, although I did not add the bacon as I had a few people who were eating that probably wouldn't like it. I'd love to give it a go again with the bacon.

I'm not a sweets person, but everyone loved the monkey bread.   I used real butter instead of margarine, added a extra 1/4 cup of maple syrup.   Winner!

Monkey Bread is my daughter's absolute favorite. Her eyes lit up when she saw her birthday surprise this past weekend. I did not add the excess cinnamon/sugar. Other than that, I followed the directions to a T. It was a big hit! It was just as good cool as it was warm. I'll be making this frequently!

I made it for a few family members (minus the bacon) for a holiday dessert.  The pieces with more of the mixture on them were entirely too sweet!!  I also baked for 35 minutes  as instructed and most of the bread was extremely hard.  I will give this another try soon adding pecans and reducing the syrup and baking time to see if it comes out better.
