If you choose to use boneless chicken  you will end up with dry chicken; however, if you follow the recipes instructions and use bone in chicken it turns out wonderfully.  I use bone in thighs, and add rings of green bell pepper (or red or yellow or orange) and this is a very popular recipe in my household.  Have served it to guests many times and all want the recipe.  With toasted white rice, it is delish.

This recipe is great.  I made a few changes.  I coated the chicken with flour (I used boneless chicken breast cut into strips) and browned it in a little oil.  For the sauce I did not put pineapple chunks in the sauce, I used pineapple rings, and placed the rings on top of chicken, I also arranged green pepper rings on top.  I am not a chili powder fan, so I omitted that. I cut the baking time in half.  The result a beautiful, and delicious dish.  This is a family favorite!!

This is one of the best dishes I have tried from this website and I've tried a lot!!! Why aren't there that many ratings or reviews???? I can not believe how good it turned out. I was thinking the worst when I first started making it. All the ingredients sounded weird together and I thought maybe the chicken would turn out dry since it stays in the oven for so long, but boy was I wrong!!! This is definatley one of the best meals I've eaten. I would strongly suggest serving this with white rice or even over the rice. Mmm..I already want another serving!

Delicious!  I only cooked mine for 45 minutes covered, then about 15 uncovered and it was great! My four year old ate it up.

This was so good!  I made the sauce (w/o the soy as my son is allergic) on the stove, added the pineapple and allowed it to boil for a few minutes.  I then poured it over the boneless chicken breast in the crockpot and cooked on low for 5hrs and then 1 hour on high.  My girls had 2 servings and told me to make this again.  I shredded the chicken up to serve and poured the juice all over it.  Made rice pilaf and couscous to go with it.  Again a very easy, very tender chicken dish!

Great sauce for Hawaiian Chicken!  I already had grilled chicken cooked so I made the sauce according to the recipe but with the butter.  Then, I added the chicken and pineapple after the sauce boiled to heat it all together.  I served it over rice.  It was delicious!

Good and easy.  The sauce was awesome!  I plan to try the sauce on grilled chicken.  I used fresh pineapple instead of canned.

I made 32 portions of this dish for our Welcome Back Teacher's Appreciation Lunch on 9/25/07. The teacher's raved over it and some said it was the best luncheon they have had yet. I just hope I can find a good enough follow-up for the Spring!

The chicken was okay with the sauce but the pineapple was not to my liking.

I made this on the stovetop.   Melted the butter in a pan, then mixed ALL the ingredients (less pineapple) in a bowl and poured it into the pan with the melted butter. Then I added the chicken. I used BONELESS chicken cut into large chunks.  Cooked this on a VERY low flame and when it was done, I added the chunks of pineapple to heat through.  DELICIOUS! Serve with plain rice.

We loved this!  It was so easy to make and was a nice change of pace from the same old stuff.  I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken, and didnt have any problems with it drying out.  I just kept an eye on it while it was cooking to make sure it didnt get overdone.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts. The first time I cooked as directed and the chicken was way over done and dry. I tried it again but this time cut the cooking time in half. The chicken was sill dry. My daughter liked it, but everyone else really hated it. I won't do again. But it is easy.

this was pretty good. It took a little longer to cook than the recipe called and I thought it could have used some more veggies, maybe some onion rings or green beans.

Not for us - too much tomato flavor that I feel doesn't mix with the sweet stuff.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It is quick and easy to put together and pretty much takes care of itself in the oven!  I used frozen chicken wings instead of a whole fryer chicken and it tasted fabulous!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

**revising** changing my three star rating to four. I followed the recipe except that I also added fresh ginger that was minced. The night I cooked it my bf liked it but the next day he liked it even better as the ginger flavor had really come thru. Maybe I'll add the ginger earlier next time. Last time I added it just at the end with the pineapple.

Oh so so Good!  I will certainly be serving this dish on a regular basis.  I did as another reviewer, and cooked it in a skillet on the stove top on a very low heat using boneless chicken breasts cut into large chunks. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. If I were to change anything next time it may be to cut the ketchup back a little. Since it said it served six, I was hoping to have some leftovers, but it was so delicious three of us finished the whole thing, served with jasmine rice. My picky husband went back for thirds!

i made this in the crockpot and my chicken came out really dry (how does that happen in the crockpot?)  but i liked (not loved) the sauce -- skipped the butter and salt and cornstarch, food processed 1 fresh pineapple and used red pepper flakes instead of chili powder (couldn't taste the spice at all).  also added a large drained can of yams.  served over rice.  would make again, but try it baked next time.

This is a great recipe that everyone will enjoy!   I decided to marinate the chicken in the mixture for 3 hours and then BBQ the chicken.  I am not sure if that made a difference or not.  Then I made a new batch of the mixture with butter and brought to a boil and let thicken.  Then I added the BBQ'd chicken and the left over pineapple.   Served over brown rice.  Alongside on the grill I cooked red and yellow bell peppers and mushrooms soaked in teriyaki which gave the plate and nice colorful look and perfect accompaniment. Very easy to make.  Served it to two other families on Memorial Day who also loved it.  Thanks Lois!
