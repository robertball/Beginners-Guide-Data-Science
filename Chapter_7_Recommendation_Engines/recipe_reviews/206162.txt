This recipe is very good, however the Lima Beans are bland and Mozzarella cheese is too.   We really enjoyed the chicken layer.  The next time I make it I will try and stronger tasting cheese.  If anyone has come up with a better idea I'd love to hear it too.  I'm suprised at the number of Calories listed in this recipe.

When pureeing the lima beans, I added 1 tsp. cumin, salt to taste, dash cayenne pepper, about 3 tbs. of olive oil, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. I also added 1 cup cooked cauliflower to  increase the quantity.

I loved the idea of this recipe, but I took a lot of liberties based on what ingredients I had available. It worked well with 2 cans of garbanzo beans for the topping!
