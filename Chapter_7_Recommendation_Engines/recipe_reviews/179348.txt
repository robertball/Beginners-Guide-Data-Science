bison being expensive,but healthy i decided to give it a try.  i added to this recipe, potato's, carrots,and rutabaga  which i added the last half hour to forty five minutes.  i would add another tablespoon of flour, and a bay leaf next time, as i thought it should be a bit thicker.  i will make again.

Excellent comfort food for a cold winter's night.  I changed it to 3 tablespoons flour and added carrots during the last 40 minutes.  I would back off on the salt next time, it really doesn't need it.  Lots of flavor.  The family loved it.

Very good! Had a lot of flavor. I would up the garlic by one clove next time. But my husband and I like garlic. I added the 3tbls of flour like others had suggested and I probably would have done one more because I like thick stew.
