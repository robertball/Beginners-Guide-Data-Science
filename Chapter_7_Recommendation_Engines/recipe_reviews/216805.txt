I have not tried adding onions, but another variation is to thinly slice fresh brussels sprouts (I use a food processor) and then stir fry rather than saute with the olive oil and garlic. You can also drizzle in some teriyaki for a more oriental flavor.

This is the best way to eat Brussel Sprouts! The ol way of boiling/steaming is out! The flavor is fantastic. Anyone who says the hate Brussel Sprouts will change their mind. So much better pan fried in a skillet. You don't have to use a cast iron skillet, but if you got one definitely the way to go. Perfect base recipe, with flexibility to do your own twist. Add chopped bacon, onion, change up the herbs...

My husband and I have been preparing brussels sprouts like this for years.  It's our favorite!  We leave out the garlic powder at the end and sometimes lightly steam them before frying since they can get a little dark before becoming tender.  If they're smaller sprouts, it's not an issue though.  A well seasoned cast iron pan does wonders for the flavor, too!

These turned out tasty, but I found I couldn't follow the directions exactly. I believe I'd have ended up with a mess if I had. If garlic, then onions are cooked for the stated times on medium heat and then raw brussels sprouts are added, the result will be sprouts that are burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. I added the garlic and onions together in the cold oil and brought it up to while sweating the aromatics. I added the sprouts (I had to cut most of mine as they ranged from medium to huge). They started to brown quickly, so I added about 2 TBSP of water and covered them for a few minutes. When I uncovered them, I continued to cook them until they carmelized. At this point they were cooked nicely and not burnt.

Good, and even better with cooked, crumbled bacon.  Not a good idea to cook without stirring - you'll risk burning the garlic.  Garlic powder in addition to fresh garlic not necessary.

I've been making my sprouts like this for years, even my kids love them!  I do add grated parmesan/romano cheese right before they are done, it gives them an extra kick.

The flavor was okay and they smelled great but they were not very tender at all. If I were to make it again I would add the Brussels sprouts much sooner after adding the garlic and onion because the onion was charred by the end and the Brussels sprouts were still underdone even though they were blackened. :/

Num!  Even if you think you don't like Brussels Sprouts you may like this!  Just don't overcook them, they turn unpleasantly mushy and bitter.  Like other reviewers mentioned it really helps the texture to microwave or steam lightly before browning in the skillet.  It is fine to go ahead and stir, just give them time to brown.  I only used fresh garlic and didn't bother with garlic powder.  Served with pork tenderloin and rice pilaf for a tummy warming autumn meal.

Really good. I didn't put in any garlic and I used some bacon fat to saute the onions and brussel sprouts. Very tasty using frozen sprouts that I had allowed to almost thaw.

These were very good, I'd never thought to saute' them in olive oil before.  The only change I made was to add some Bacon Bacon seasoning.

It was really good!  Next time I will add the garlic and onions at the same time as the brussel sprouts though, cause they were burnt to a crisp.  I also added butter.  yum.

These were good sprouts! I cut them in half to shorten cooking time, and I threw everything into the pan at once (I don't like my garlic to darken that much). At the end I sprinked the sprouts with Parmesan cheese.

I started cooking them this way about a year ago, but added in some chopped red sweet pepper in place of the onion.  The flavors really suit one another - the bitter with the sweet.

Really good! I liked doing these on the cooktop, because my oven was busy with Chicken Parmesan Bake (Chef John!), and I needed to use the Brussels Sprouts before I had to throw them away. I did them in cast iron, and I put the garlic in at the same time as the sprouts so I didn't burn it. I used the trick with the water and the lid because the onions were burning and the sprouts weren't cooking very fast, and that evened things out nicely! My daughter's boyfriend had never had them before, and said they were delicious. I thought so too!

I never really cared for Brussel sprouts, but dear hubby does, so I made this recipe in hopes he would like it and I would enjoy them too. Well I did and so did he. This recipe is so easy and made them very tasty.  The only change I made ( and I hate it when people change a recipe and rate it low) was I added some water at the very end to steam them throughally. Hubby likes them cooked soft. Other than that yummy!
Cheap veggie too, $2.00 for a stalk and I got 2 dinner sides.  Thanks!

Excellent.  Steamed them for a bit first to bring out the color and make sure they were cooked.  Pan friend as directed.  Even my daughter who never likes them ate a couple.

Sadly, they still taste like brussel sprouts. Good try, though.
Only bacon or cream can make these suckers palatable. This recipe is not the answer to your prayers if you are a brussel sprouts hater like me. This recipe might work out if you like brussel sprouts a little bit.

I've made this recipe twice now. The second time I decided to make it the main dish by adding grilled chicken breast. The dish was a hit with the family. No leftovers for this house. Will be making this dish again.

I cut off the tough end and slice in half. I add them to hot olive oil that has had the garlic added to it already (and lots of it). I fry them until they look burned. This makes them SO sweet and yummy. Every time I make them we always say, "Why don't we have these more often?" They are $2.98 a pound that's why!!! Worth it though when you can make them this delicious.

My kids love these Brussels Sprouts, they get so excited whenever I fry some up for dinner. They are delicious, easy to make and very healthy. If you are as lucky as I am, your family (especially your kids) will love them!

I used onion powder instead of onion and have used real garlic and garlic powder, and it was good both ways.

Pan frying them for 14 minutes (as per directions) and they weren't close to being done.
Then I took them out and chopped them into 4ths.  Took another 15 - 20 minutes.

Add some asparagus spears snapped into bite size pieces and use red onion instead of white for some added color.  Sprinkle with real bacon bits before serving.

Delicious!! One of our local Star5 Restaurants has this on their menu with a few improvements:
Add crispy bacon and crispy almonds.
Make a thickened balsamic vinegar sauce, by simply reducing the vinegar to sprinkle over the brussel sprouts...makes SUCH a difference!

No. This recipe is backwards. By the time the Brussel sprouts are done the onion is burned to a crisp. Brussel sprouts should be cooked first until almost done then add onion for about 5 minutes and then garlic for last 2 minutes.

Delicious, and very easy. I was using the cast iron pan for steak, so I made them in a Gotham pan . Also, I covered the pan so they steamed a bit while they cooked. They were superb.

Very tasty!  I added the garlic and onion at the same time as my Brussel sprouts and my onions still ended up a bit burnt but I still liked it. Also added some white cooking wine to the mix and steamed them a bit. I also cut them into quarters so they would cook faster.

As another review said, the onions should be held back until later in the cooking process.  By putting the onions in first and leaving them in the skillet throughout the entire process, they are cooking for about 15 - 19 minutes, which is far too long for the onions to be cooking; they are burned by the end of the  total cooking time.

I love all of the ingredients in this recipe but as written it didn't work for me. The sprouts really need to be steamed or shredded, by the time that they were cooked the onion was burned.

Although I did like the flavor but I really wish the sprouts were more cooked. I even left them longer. I will try it again and see if I can get them softer.

Awful. We love Brussels sprouts but not only did I not like this, but my entire family did as well, by refusing to eat more than the 1 bite that they made faces to while choking it down. Texture for the recipe is off, flavor is off- this recipe is a no go. Don't waste your time with this. Look for a better Brussels Sprout recipe that is well thought so it actually tastes good.

The Brussel sprouts tasted good cooking in the end. But, even with halving the sprouts to cut on cooking time, the garlic and onions were still burnt by the time the sprouts cooked.

The garlic cooks much faster than 3 minutes, and I'd add the Brussels sprouts earlier. Also, covering the pan with a lid helps them cook through faster. I left out the garlic powder - it was delicious enough as it is (fresh garlic - so much better).

I omit the onion, use a large paella pan so I can get every cut side touching the surface for maximum roastiness, and add crushed red pepper and a drizzle of truffle oil at the finish. Not at all undelicious.

Great, I trimmed the ends and cut the brussels sprouts in half,  carmelized the onions with the garlic first and added kosher salt instead of regular salt. Plus, topped with crushed butter and garlic croutons at the end. I like my vegetables crisp / tender- if you don't, simply cover for five minutes at the end. Excellent and easy!

These turned out really great, but I had some issues with the directions.  I needed much more olive oil, about 1/4 cup or they would have burned.  I cut the Brussels Sprouts in half, and they still needed more time to cook than stated, but maybe I just like mine very well done.  When it says "cook without stirring", that ends up making them very crispy and delicious but make sure you watch them carefully.  I also ended up omitting the crushed garlic and onion.  That worked really well.  I didn't have to worry about burnt garlic or onions.  I used a VERY generous amount of garlic powder.  My version ended up being a lot simpler, but it came out really good.
