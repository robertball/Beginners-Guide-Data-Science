I used Red (hot) jelly over the cream cheese and then topped put decorated the sides with green (mild) jelly.  I omitted the pecans on top.  We prefer this recipe with crackers instead of chips.  But overall a festive, inexpensive and good recipe.

Been making this for years. I don't spread this into a bowl, I just leave the cream cheese in brick form and spread the jelly all over and then place pecans all over. Always serve with assorted crackers. Always a hit. Thanks.

Update: Easier yet!  Just combine the jelly and the cream cheese, stir together and serve with Club crackers. HUGE HIT! What could be easier *~...
Original review: I love this. But I really wouldn't even have thought to call it a "recipe". For me, it's just a way to eat jalepeno pepper jelly! Which is on a cracker over cream cheese. It's simply delicious. It's a nice mix of sweet and spicy. (But if you don't like spicy, you probably won't enjoy it.) I howerver, LOVE it.

I totally agree with Breeze's review.  Leave the cream cheese in block form and put the jelly on top; delete the nuts.  It's best to put several spreaders in the cream cheese since it's so thick.  (It's not really a dip.)  It tastes great on wheat thins.  You can even use reduced fat/calorie cream cheese. A great way to serve pepper jelly.

This had a very unpleasant taste and was too hard to dip, the tortillas we used just broke.

Everybody loved the spicy taste!  It was appropriatly chrissmassy.  I made the night before, however, which it got very runny.  Best made right before using.

I make this without the pecans, however, I would call it a spread, not a dip.  Way too thick!  We just eat with crackers.

Wonderful!  I have made this for years, without the pecans.  Wish I had thought of it before.

This is so easy for the holidays. Be sure your cream cheese is at room temperature before you serve it. Use small cheese spreaders and crackers. This is not soft enough for tortilla chips, they’ll break easily. Do not make this the night before. It’s best put together and served immediately. My family really enjoys this appetizer.

I found it's easier to dip if served room temperature in a shallow dish as the recipe states. If you try mixing the jelly into it, the jelly gets runny.
We like it with Rice Crackers.

This is a good appetizer, and it isn't necessarily all that spicy if you use the green and red jelly both. Let the cream cheese come to room temperature and warm the jelly a bit in the microwave (about 15 sec) to make it easier to spread.  Even better served with gingersnaps than it is with crackers, the spicy sweet of the gingersnaps really sets off the cream cheese and the heat of the jalapeno jelly.  You can use the nuts or leave them out.
