Second time making and has become my new favorite dinner!  1st time was according to recipe (with 1 hr cook). 2nd time with modifications:  I diced my mushrooms and used Marsala vs White Zinfandel.  I used the excess mushroom And cheese stuffing to make a sauce with the pork chop Marsala drippings ( at the end of cooking) in a separate sauce pan and poured over the chops and garlic mashed potatoes I served as my side.

We really liked this. I didn't cook as long as the recipe calls for. I didn't have parsley so I used spinach flavors are slightly different but it was the green I was after. I will put this in my pork chop file and will be making it again.

Tried it.  Cooking directions have to be wrong.  Fortunately I was keeping a close watch as total cooking time was one (1) hour, not two.

The whole fam loved this recipe.  Even my two year old who eats like a bird at dinner ate a lot of this.  I personally didn't like the swiss cheese in it.  I would rather have cheddar.  I also changed the cooking method a bit.  First I seared it off in oil, then I placed it in a pan with the wine and covered it and let it cook for a few minutes, then finished it off in the oven til fully cooked.  It only took about 1/2 hour.  I think the recipe's cooking time is too long.  It was very tasty and tender.  I served it with Mushroom Orzo (recipe on this site)

I have made this recipe several times now and it has never disappointed.   It is not difficult to make and is very delicious.  In fact, I really avoided pork chops all together until I found this recipe as I always found pork chops to turn out dry and not very exciting.   This recipe changed my mind about making pork chops for dinner!

Delicious! Cooking time is way off but I expected that. You could stuff maybe 4 chops with the recipie. Will make again. I used Sherry because I didn't have white wine.

Excellent and easy to make! The oil for frying did make them a little too oily. I did not use the wine cause i was afraid it would turn mushy..will be a regular at my house :)))

Although I did not make this recipe to the letter, it is a good starter recipe.  I went with the other suggestions to saute the onions, so I did this in butter.  I omitted the mushrooms and swiss cheese and added leeks and one apple.   Salt and pepper to taste.  I added bread stuff and had one left over sour dough pretzel that I had to the mix.  After stuffing each pork chop, I laid them on top of a bed of sliced onions and a half cup of chicken broth.  I cooked it according to the time in the recipe and temp.  It came out very moist and flavorful.  I served it with Bearnaise sauce.   I will definitely make this recipe again.

DELICIOUS!! My family went crazy for this recipe. I substituted Pinot Grigio because that’s what I had. And sautéd the extra stuffing in the juices from the chops after I removed them from the pan and served over Zoodles. Also cooked chops only 1 1/2 hours.

I added 1/2 pkg spinach with a little minced onion , which I sauted until the moisture was gone and the onion was tender.
 Only needed one egg and about 1/4 c wine.

I mostly followed the recipe using what I had. I used an Italian white cheese mix with a bit of added Swiss for the filling with the shrooms .......and spicy bread crumbs vs regular crumbs. I did sauté onion slices in butter (instead of oil) for browning the stuffed chops, then added additional slices of onion and the stems of the mushrooms (sliced) acting as a little bed for the chops to rest on during the simmering process.  I opted for Marsala ( per reviews) thinned with a little chicken broth for the liquid and simmered for about an hour and a half while checking for tenderness. *I had a little leftover dressing, so I dumped that into the mix  for the simmering....worked out well.   Very tender, flavorful and simple. Impressed the man so I must do again!

Wow, these were so moist and delicious!  My husband said it was the best pork chop he's ever had!!  That's a compliment, because he's pretty finicky.  My husband and son split the last one!  Only changes I made was to chop up some baby spinach and sweet onion to add to the mushrooms and swiss cheese.  I used 4 chops and simmered them in Riesling.  I also put the extra stuffing mixture on top of the chops before simmering.  Will be making this again!

Loved this dish.  I Recommend 1 inch chops.  Additionally, I would chop the mushrooms instead of using them sliced , just to make the mixture more manageable.  Great flavor.

Yummy! I subbed cornmeal for the breadcrumbs to make this gluten free, but otherwise did not make any changes. My chops were done and pretty  tender after 1 hour. A nice, easy way to glam up a pork chop dinner!  If you make this with cornmeal, dredge the chops in the cornmeal before dipping in the egg, then dredge again: this helps the coating to stay put.

I must say most likely the best stuffed chops i made. I didnt put mushrooms in other than that used  1 teaspoon of Hot Hungarian  Paprika. Gave it a wonderful flavor. I have mase it twice now and the 2nd time around with no musrooms. If there was enough space for them i would of used them. I did make extra stuffing as suggested . My Dinner Guests had to have the recipes also. Great all really enjoyed. Not a sound at the table other than chewing the food. When they were finished all i could hear was the raving of the Chops and stuffing.

I'm afraid I didn't have any White Zin, so I went w another's suggestion and  used Marsala wine. I also added spinach to the stuffing. It was really good and will make it again.
