This was a discovery that I thought would be a real flop. I did not have white sandwich bread, so I subbed whole grain. Neither of us wanted to eat it, but once we took a bite we were pleasantly surprised. The watermelon actually worked well with this combo. I will def do this when the little ones come to our house. I just would not try to pack it in a lunch :)

I have a bag of cubed watermelon so I thought I'd give this a taste test (without the bread). The watermelon makes the peanut butter really creamy and then you get a of cinnamon. Definitely interesting and strangely satisfying. I'm on a crepe fix so I'm going to try this as a filling.. will let you all know how it goes!
