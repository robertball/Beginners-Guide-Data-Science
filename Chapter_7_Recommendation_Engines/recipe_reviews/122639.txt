I make something very similar to this recipe but while the long grain rice and wild rice is cooking, I saute 8 oz. of fresh, sliced mushrooms in olive oil and butter with a few cloves of minced garlic and finish with some thinly sliced green onions.  Then I add this mixture to the cooked rice.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  I have also thrown in a cup of toasted, chopped pecans for some crunch.  If there is a good amount left over (ha ha), I make latkes with the rice mixture for dinner the next day.  Both are delicious!

This is a great recipe,but I made it with a couple of changes. I made it for 8, and used 1/3 c roasted/salted pine nuts, 1 1/2 c fresh mushrooms and 1 1/2 tsp salt. Also, I used 5 1/3 c canned beef and/or chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. I lightly topped it with grated parmesean cheese before baking.  DELICIOUS!!

This recipe is excellent.  I received a pound of wild rice in a Christmas gift and used some of it to prepare this dish. My partner, who is an extremely picky eater, actually went back for seconds.  Don't change a thing when you make it.

I made this recipe and just added a few of my own touches to it. I brown a pound of hamburger and throw it in before it bakes along with three slices of bacon that I chop and throw in. It makes for more of a casserole dish but it is yummy~

AMAZING!!!  Used a carton of low sodium beef broth instead of bouillon cubes and water, and added parmesan, like other members have mentioned.  Absolutely fabulous!

Much better using organic broth instead of bouillion, fresh mushrooms instead of canned and some choice spices to make it more pleasing to the palate. I added a 1/4 c. of white wine, subtracting a bit of the broth to make up the difference. I garnished it with fresh parmesan. We ate every bite. NOTE: This also can be made on the stovetop, which is what I did, if you're on a time crunch. I served this with Asparagus Parmesan and Corn Bread Chicken.

Though a little time consuming, this is a  great method for cooking wild rice. The finished product is a nice crispy-chewy texture that I like. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. The one drawback to this recipe is that it is a bit boring in flavor, but certainly easy enough to perk up with your favorite herbs, spices, wine, or veggies. Thanks!

If you are unfamiliar with wild rice, don't let that stop you from trying this recipe.  I served it with prime rib on Christmas and it recieved rave reviews and there were no leftovers.  The recipe can be prepared ahead and baked later.  The only change I made was to substitute canned mushrooms with fresh mushrooms.  Awesome!

So midway through starting this recipe I realized I didn't have mushrooms! So I instead added a cann of peas and a can of tomatoes, along with a little bit of packaged gravy...It was very good and a wonderful alternative to just plain old rice!

THis recipe is a GREAT side dish! The only thing I didn't add was the sliced mushrooms as we aren't a mushroom family (for the texture, not taste). It took a little longer to make than I was anticipating (to get all liquid absorbed) so it was done AFTER we had eaten dinner, however our family sat around it after it came out of the oven and ate HALF. It was so good - even for picky toddlers! Will definitely make again, but this time serve it WITH dinner! :)

This was good, I used fresh mushrooms and I had to add a bit more water, the rice soaked up a lot.  I used Jasmine rice for my long grain.

I'm only going to give this recipe three stars because I really think it would have tasted a lot better with chicken broth instead of beef bouillion and water.  The beef flavor seemed to over take the wild rice flavor.

I was in the mood for sweet rather than savory tonight, plus I wanted to "veganize" this, so I made substitutions like crazy. The recipe is awesome either way. Here's what I did: Used vegetable broth instead of water and boullion, brown rice instead of white, apple butter instead of regular butter, and added some finely chopped carrots when the second round of rice was added. With the mushrooms and apple butter at the last step, I also added three small apples, roughly chopped, and 1/2 c. craisins before putting it in the oven. It was absolutely delicious :)
