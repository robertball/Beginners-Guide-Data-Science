I am Donna Q and I posted this recipe.  All Recipes made a few changes to it before putting in on the website.  1.  Parchment paper is not necessary.  I've never had these cookies stick.  2.  Mix ingredients well but batter should not be smooth!  The nuts and oatmeal are what give them the great texture.  3.  Use a teaspoon to drop onto cookie sheet so that the cookies are very small.  Because they're crumbly and sugared they are easier to eat if they are really small.  Enjoy!

YUMMY!  For a smoother texture put the oats in a food processor or blender.  Then pulse it until you have the consistency of flour.

WONDERFUL EUROPEAN VERSION!  I ROLLED THEM IN ABOUT 1 ROUNDED TABLESPOON BALL TO BAKE (LIKE PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES) AND DOUBLE DIPPED THEM IN A BOWLFUL OF POWDERED SUGAR, ONCE WHEN THEY ARE SEMI-WARM ON THE COOKIE RACK, AND WHEN THEY ARE COMPLETELY COOLED.  I ALSO LOWERED THE COOKING TIME TO 15 MINUTES.  YUMMY!!!

Really good cookies.  Buttery, light and crisp and delicate.  Used regular oatmeal right from the container (did not process) - these are supposed to have flakes of oatmeal in them.  Chopped my pecans up pretty small.  Easy to mix up with a wooden spoon and probably don't need parchment.  Excellent!  Give 'em a try!! **** OK, I wanted to make them smaller so I made 1" balls.  Def the way to go - makes the shape more uniform too.  Didn't dust with powdered sugar.  Posted pics.  Man oh man, these are delicious! ***This is my third update:  I chilled the dough and then rolled into balls.  They stay a little puffed up that way and I like them better than flat.

This is like an awesome cross between a sandie cookie and a shortbread cookie.  If you want oatmeal flour as suggested, just put oatmeal in your food processor or blender to do that. (THAT was a terrific suggestion too) I had good results with oatmeal blended this way. Melt in your mouth goodness!  Don't sub margerine for butter unless you want to change the taste and texture of this great cookie. It is perfect as written and was well received by everyone in our house.  My oldest called this cookie "naughty" because you can't eat just one.  Thanks for a keeper recipe!

What a treat!!!! SO DE-LI-CI-OUS. However I made few chjanges as I'm intolerant to gluten & my husband has diabete. So I used rice flour, barley flakes, raisins instead of respectively wheat flour, oatmeal & pecans. I also cut down on sugar by half. In spite of all these changes it came out really great.  They've become my favorites now & will make tem again...

Will make again, definitely one of my favorites. Something different and delicious.  I had no pecans so I used chopped walnuts. Used parchment paper, probably not necessary. 300 degrees, 11 minutes using convection. Made 74.

DE-li-cious! Thank you! Quite the crumbly little cookie and next time I will make it smaller (more bite size). I read your comment about making them small and did, but not small enough apparently. Wonderful, though. Thanks!

Very delicious - light and so so buttery!  I took the reviewer's advice who said to pulse the oats in the food processor before adding and it made them have a great texture.  I didn't need the parchment paper either - there is so much butter in there that there is no way it will stick to the pan.  Also, it didn't make 60, it made 30 - maybe I made them too big?  But I did a scant tablespoon...

This was a cross between an oatmeal cookie and a shortbread cookie. Almost a pecan sandy - ish cookie. It was very good - light and buttery, but still a little weird. The oatmeal definitely gave the cookie an odd texture. I give it 5 stars for flavour but it loses 1 star because of the texture. The family loved these.

Donna, thank you so much for posting this recipe. This is the cookie I have been longing for but couldn't put into words. Just made a batch for the first of what I know will be many times. I made exactly as the recipe indicates with one exception. I didn't dust the tops with powdered sugar because they tasted wonderful as is. Excellent flavor from the pecans and vanilla and the combination of butter and confectioners sugar created such a delicate crumb, just what I was looking for. I can't imagine any improvement on these wonderful cookies. Thanks for sharing!

This produces a wonderful, melt-in-your-mouth cookie for relatively little effort -- perfect for when you need something impressive on short notice.  It tastes like a Mexican wedding cake, without the time-consuming rolling and with less powdered sugar all over everything.

YUM!  I chilled the dough and then rolled them into marble sized balls and cooked for 10 minutes and they were awesome!  I made a bunch and gave them as Christmas goodies along with other treats and I got rave reviews from everyone!

This cookie deserves 10 stars! I knew they would be delicate because of the confectioners sugar and the taste was just incredible! I used a little almond extract along with the vanilla. I used quick oats and chopped just a little bit finer after reading the reviews. Oh Yummy and such a nice texture. Thank you Donna Q.

a delicate, rich cookie... easy to make... only a little tricky getting it off the cookie sheets (so tender and crumbly) I finally slowed down and let it cool a bit longer than I usually do and then it was fine. I didn't remember to dust with confectioners sugar but it didn't see to matter as they were already sweet enough for us.

Yummy...used old fashioned, rather than quick oats, and no nuts because my kids don't like them in cookies (although I'll have to make more since I love pecans)...As the original contributor updated, parchment paper definitely not needed...I put a drop of oil on the pan and wiped it- cookies slid off easier than any I've ever made.

Kids LOVED them even though they keep claiming they don't like oatmeal cookies!  I loved them too- so buttery delicious!  Forgot to dust with sugar and no one noticed...
Best part besides the taste is how quick and easy they are to make.

So easy and so darn tasty it's hard not to eat the batter before it makes it to the pan. I used some oatmeal cereal I wanted to finish off. In the cereal was raisins, cranberries and cherries, so not all the cookies were quite the same. Awesome.

Turned out very well and nice but had some trouble combining liquids and solids so resorted to adding 2 eggs in to the mix. Lovely Recipe though!

These cookies were SOOOOOOO GREAT! At first when I brought them out of the oven, I didn't like the way it turned out (i guess its because the recipe lacks eggs) because it didn't rise and it was so light and fragile. Its really oily but unbelievably hard to resist from eating them!

Excellent.  My husband and 3 boys couldn't stop eating them.  I used pampered chef's small scoop and yeilded 6 dozen.  I didn't sprinkle conf. sugar on them when cooled.  Still great!

Delicious, easy and quick to make.  Had no problem with too much spreading even without refrigerating the dough.  Followed the recipe exactly.  While I agree the icing sugar sprinkled on the baked cookies doesn't add much to the taste, I think it adds to the look and distinction of the cookie.  I'll be making these again. Thanks for the recipe.

DELISH! SO crispy and the taste is just sinful. SUPER easy to make...we didnt have pecans so we just left them out....stlll awesome. Dont need parchment paper and we just used the regular oats. I did put my dough in the fridge for 15 min to make it easier to scoop. Used rounded teaspoons and cooked at 350 for 15 min. PERFECT!

I loved them! OMGosh these are so yummy! I agree with another reviewer, these do take like something similar to a pecan sandie (russian tea cake cookies). I didn't roll w/ confectioners, didn't need them. I used old-fashioned oats and also only had about 1/2 cup pecans so used about 1/4-1/3 cup of ground flax seed to add more nutty flavor. SOOOOOooo yummy especially the dough! ( I think I ate like half the batch, oops! :) The only things is that they ARE very tender and crumbly, almost dry. I will try to make smaller sized cookies next time to see if that'll help, I might even try replacing some of the butter with applesauce. This batch also doesn't make 5 dozen by the way, it's more like 3.5 or 4. Overall, VERY GOOD but VERY CRUMBLY

These are very good. As others have said, keep them small, don't need parchment paper, and 300 degrees (convection oven) for 10 minutes. They're a bit greasy - I wonder if the amount of butter can be cut back? Made 48 cookies - they are somewhat crumbly, but tasty!

I have to say that I tweeked these a great deal, but I made them more healthy and they were AMAZING!  What a great, healthier cookie!  My tweeked version were more fluffy and chewy, opposed to the other reviews that said they were crumbly.

Very, very good cookies.  I  did make make them bigger when I baked them so only got two dozen.  Next time I'll make them a little smaller, but they were really delicious as they were and everyone loved them.  Thanks for the great recipe, Donna!

I made these after I saw the corrections by the submitter.  I went by what she had said and these were the best ever.  I did use spelt flakes since I can't tollerate oats.  I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  Very Nice!!!!

These are very good, but obviously very rich!  I would make the balls small not only because they're so rich, but because they are delicate and crumble easily. I halved the recipe and made it as is.  I did not grind the oatmeal and I did not dip in powdered sugar after baking as they were already plenty sweet.  A nice cookie!

I made these for the 1st time today - they definitely spread out on the cookie sheet. I used a teaspoon & I only got 30 cookies out of the batch when it says should make 60.

They spread out super thin & definitely aren't thick like the photo shows on the recipe.

Only thing I did to change this was to give the oatmeal a quick whirl in the mini food processor, baked in 300 degree convection oven for 11 minutes, as one other person suggested....perfect, delicious cookie.  Also did not require parchment paper, the cookies came of the sheet easily.

The family loved them, me too. They turned out a bit big and touched each other, no problem with the taste. My wife says they are a bit to sweet.  Maybe next time I may reduce the sugar in the recipe. It is okay with or without the confectioners sugar on top. I think this is my new oatmeal cookie recipe.
Made cookies this morning with an adjustment to the recipe since my wife said they were too sweet, I added about 1 1/2 extra oatmeal. They turned out better to her liking, me and the kids love them too.

Be forewarned, these are addicting.  These were a huge hit with the family. These delicate little treasures are ideal for any gathering or just simply with a cup of coffee.  I gave them a very light dusting of powdered sugar because I don’t like overly sweet cookies and it was perfect.  These will look charming on your cookie platters.

Though, the recipe promises 5 dozen, and it didn't make that many, or at least, my family finished them in like 5 minutes! :) I didn't use confectioner's sugar, instead, I used brown sugar, and added chopped raisins, chopped almonds (pecans are too expensive in Guatemala) and a dab of cinnamon. Love them! :)

I really liked the flavor of these. They are a pretty cookie too, before the powdered sugar covers them. They bake up nicely. I followed the recipe exactly just cutting the recipe in half. I love that they are not too sweet and have the added oatmeal and pecans. However, my main issue with the cookie is, they are crispy. I took them out 1-2 minutes early also. I guess, I didn't expect that. Being as their flavor reminded me of cookies I have eaten from a bakery, I would still make them again though. ty

Wow! I made these exactly as written (except for using a rounded teaspoon rather than a tablespoon of dough) and they are FABULOUS! Quite possibly the best cookies I've ever made ... and I've made a LOT of cookies over the years! Very light, crisp, buttery and absolutely delicious! Will definitely make these again and again. I used Old Fashioned rolled oats (not quick cooking) and pecans chopped medium-fine.

These cookies are wonderful!!! I followed the recipe to a T and they're just perfect.  My family loves them as they are very tasty and yet so light...great dunkers!  I used a small ice cream scooper and I achieved perfect,  same-size cookies. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Good cookies!  My first batch was dropped by teaspoonfuls and they spread out completely flat.  They were ready in about 12 minutes.  After tasting them, I thought they should be a little sweeter, so I sprinkled some powdered sugar on them.  My second batch turned out better when I rolled them in balls and then in powdered sugar.  These cookies are very delicate, so the next time I make them, they'll be 1/2" balls.

These are unique and delicious!! Crisp and airy. Similar to pecan sandies, but way better! These were not at all what I expected when I set out to make oatmeal cookies, but they have become a favorite with family and coworkers.

Wow, these were so good and buttery with a flaky almost shortbread-like texture! Also, these are ridiculously easy to make. They are a bit sweet so I didn't sprinkle with powdered sugar after cooling and am glad for that. I subbed almonds for the nuts since that's what I had on hand. Donna Q, thanks for a great recipe that I most definitely will be making again!

Not sure how I went wrong since I followed the instructions to a tee but these turned out terrible as far as texture is concerned. They weren't cookies at all. The taste however was awesome so I'm willing to try it again. Hopefully I get it right next time.

My family and my daughter's in-laws (and there are a lot of them) are huge fans of these cookies!  I have made them for several years now and they are looked for whenever we get together.Only change in ingredients is to increase pecans a bit and chop them really finely.  I chill ALL cookie dough before baking, sometimes I make this dough the evening before baking.  Once mixed, I place the dough onto waxed or parchment paper and roll it into a 1-1.5 inch log (inside of the waxed paper) so it looks like a giant salt water taffy.  Chill overnight and cut into about 3/4 inch pieces, and roll into balls to bake.  This step yields regular shaped cookies without spreading out too thinly bc of the high butter and fine sugar content of this dough.  These will  come out as cookies, not balls, after baking.  I dust with confectioners sugar (placed in a strainer) once as they are cooling on airbake cookie sheets. Then move to cool sheets to firm up, as soon as the cookies are cooled enough to keep their shape when picked up with a pancake turner/metal spatula. Then I dust with conf. sugar again after cooling completely.  These are a very tender cookie that cannot be stacked up in a cookie tin without crumbling. I place in a single layer stacked on a slant on a platter, or in an aluminum pan prettied up with paper doilies.  No matter how they are presented, they are snatched up. Now I also make little take home pans for everyone as well, which are well appreciated.

Love these cookies.  I substituted 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds and 1/2 cup dried papaya for the pecans and they were really delicious.  Great texture and perfectly sweet.

They taste okay and are very easy to make, but they are very dry and crumble when you eat them.

FANTASTIC!! These were a nice little treat! I agree with the other users that said they are a cross between an oatmeal  and a shortbread cookie!! I did add a dash of cinnamon and a handful of dried cranberrys! Scrumptious!

Delicious!  Tasted like oatmeal pecan sandies.  Followed other reviewers and chilled the dough for 30 mins prior to rolling into marble-sized balls. I'm not sure it made a difference but the cookies weren't as flat as I expected them to be.  Cooked for 15 mins.  Next time I'll double the recipe. Oh, and I used 1/2 cup pecans instead of the full cup.  I think that was a good call.  Will definitely make again.

I make these every year for Christmas. It is something different that everyone loves. I lowered the cooking time to 15 minutes also as one of the other viewer suggested. It make them a little more chewy rather then just crispy and crunchy.

sorry, didn't like these. They were very bland and the texture was similar to a pecan sandi.

Only changed one thing, omitted pecans.  Used unsalted butter, real vanilla, quick oats right out of box, no extra processing.  Used more of a 1 1/2 tsp size after reading reviews that said they were better suited to a smaller size, and baked for 9-10 min.  Sifted confectioners sugar on top after removing from oven.  A very nice alternative to average chewy or crispy oatmeal cookies. Turned out slightly crispy on bottom, airy, not chewy, very tasty bite-size little cookies.  Someone else said a bit like a tea cookie, that's about right.  Very nice that it takes so few ingredients and makes so few dishes to clean up.  I used wax paper to line cookie sheets, worked just fine.

This has become not only my husbands FAVORITE cookie but mine as well.  Super easy and delish!!!! I make them a little bigger than called for and leave off the powdered sugar on top, only because of the mess.  They are still good without it.  You don't need parchment paper.

Great new twist to oatmeal cookies.  People who do not like oatameal cookies really rave about these. I added just a little cinnamon to the powdered sugar before I dusted the cookies. YUMMY!

insane!  it sounded weird but there is nothing weird about it!  these cookies are a perfect hybrid and the best new cookie i have tried in a long time!  i substituted hazelnut extract for the vanilla because that is what i had.  these are definitely going to make the rotation!
