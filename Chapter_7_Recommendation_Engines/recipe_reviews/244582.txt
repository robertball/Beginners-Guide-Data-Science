My family loved this dish! I cut the chicken up into little pieces before adding it to the rice mixture, and we made burritos out of it. Instead of adding the cheese in the skillet, we put it in our burritos. It turned out great!

Yum this was good! DBF enjoyed it too. I weighed out my chicken, it turned out to be three breasts, which was not enough for the rice mixture. Otherwise there is nothing wrong with this recipe and it will be great for weeknight dinners. Thanks Swanson!

I thought this was very good.   I didn't have picante sauce so I boiled the rice in the broth without it and added the salsa I had when I added the beans and corn. I had to add a little tomato sauce and a little more broth. Without the picante the mixture went well over tortilla chips with sour cream. I'm looking forward to making it with the picante sauce.

Winner winner chicken dinner!  This turned out to be very good and well seasoned.  I made it with chicken tenders since that is what I had.  I seasoned the chicken with a little S&P and taco seasoning before browning but everything else was followed to a T and it turned out great.  However I think the next time I make it I will pair it with a nice green salad so I'm not tempted to have seconds.

This dish was excellent!  Only issue was too much rice compared to the chicken, but the flavor was great, so I froze the leftover rice for future use.

Yum!!! Forgot to take a picture of it. I sliced the breasts in half when they were brown on both sides and sautéed them some more. Great for a pot luck - easy and quick.

The chicken was very bland and didn't. The rice mixture was good, though.

I used as pineapple-habañero salsa I had rather than a plain red salsa and it really jazzed up the flavor. I had to cook the meal longer as the rice was too hard after the prescribed time but then I broiled the pan with the cheese on at the end and it more than made up for the time.

Delicious!  This meal was a “Let’s see what I have in my pantry” dinner and it turned into a possible family Staple.  I substituted frozen corn with canned corn and a little water, used 3 bullion cubes and water for the broth, and managed to make something close to salsa with a can of peeled tomatoes, onion, garlic, and 1/4c jalapeño based hot sauce.  I cut the chicken into chunks to make it easier for the little ones and toped it with 3/4c Colby jack cheese. Served with tortilla and sour cream.  It was so good!!  We WILL be making this again the next time I have real Salsa in the house.

This recipe was sooooo good! The only thing I changed was that I used leftover rotisserie chicken and added a can of chicken, so I’d have enough. It needed just a little more liquid. It was very tasty! We put a spoonful for sour cream on top of our servings, to tone down the hot picante sauce. We’ll definitely have this again.

We loved it!!!  My husband even asked for more. The only change I made was to add ½ cup sauted onions and seasoned the chicken with sea salt, pepper and garlic powder. I was out of long grain rice so I used instant and adjusted the cooking time for the rice and I was out of black beans so I used well rinsed ranch style beans. But even with the ranch style beans it still turned out great. Thank for sharing this recipe, it is going to become a regular around our house!!!

This dish was very good. I added a small can of diced mild green chili's which it really needed since the recipe is not very spicy by itself. Also I would use 1 3/4 lbs of chicken next time as it was a bit lean on the chicken.

This was delicious and very easy to make.  I used about 2 lbs of chicken.  I also used brown rice.  I did cook the rice a little longer with a little more liquid, but it came out great.  My whole family loved it and we will definitely make this often.

This was a huge hit for my family, I scaled it to serve 5 and added about a 1/4 more rice and 1/4 more Swanson chicken broth but I probably didn't need to.  However, everyone went for seconds on the rice!  I will make this again!  I topped the chicken with some sliced scallions.

This was easy to make and my family loved it but the ratio of chicken to rice is off. Not a bad thing because my family had seconds of the rice but if I would make this again I would add more chicken.

This dish was a big hit at my house and I am sure it will appear many times on my table. Despite the small amount of seasoning used, it was very tasty. I'm sure the Swanson Chicken broth also helped to create the depth of flavor. In addition, the combination of rice, beans and corn created a meaty texture that served to complement the chicken that was used. To finish the meal I added a garnish of chopped tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese and a sprinkling of parsley.
