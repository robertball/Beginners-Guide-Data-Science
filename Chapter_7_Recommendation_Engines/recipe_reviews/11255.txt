I substituted half the cocoa for chocolate pudding for a moister consistency but they were still very cake like, I did enjoy the light chocolate flavor.  I think next time I will add raisins and maybe premade pudding, I dont know......

It seemed good but average. To bring out some flavor, I added chocolate chips and a little cinnamon.

I was expecting something along the lines of breakfast biscuits (where you have to cut them out using a glass) but this was way easier by just plopping the dough on a baking sheet.  Tasted a little bland because I used low-calorie instant hot-chocolate.

Based on the title, I expected biscuits, not cookies! That said, these cookies aren't very good. Yes, they're easy to make, but they are bland and have a cake-like consistency. My two-year-old likes them, though.

Not sure if I did this right but my dough ended up more like a batter...so I made muffins. Kids seemed to like them...so they can't be too bad!

The recipe made 12 big soft cookies. Not sure if the oatmeal provides any texture benefit. Added a bit of cinnamon. Serving with ice cream.
