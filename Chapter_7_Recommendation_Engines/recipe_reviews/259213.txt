SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!  This was amazing and the family LOVED it!  Only tweaks I made were using 3/4 lb ground beef but I will go back to 1/2 lb when I make this again because yes, I will definitely make again.  But, I will use 4 pepper jack cheese sticks instead of two.  Just needs a little more cheese.  I didn’t need a sushi mat, just used a cutting board and it rolled up real easy.  Highly recommend, it’s fun and delicious.

It was easy enough to make, by nothing special for taste. It was like eating a bacon cheeseburger.

Made as written and this was excellent! If you like your bacon really brown I recommend cooking it for a few minutes prior to making your roll. While I liked the look the prosciutto gave the roll, the taste seemed to have gotten lost. It is very expensive so I will leave that out next time. If you are wanting to impress that meat loving man of yours, this is the recipe to do it with!
