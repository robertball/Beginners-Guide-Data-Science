Wow, this was good...a little rich, but good!  I don't have beer, so I used beef broth laced with a little red wine vinegar for a little tang.  Other than that, no changes.  I only gave four stars because the bread was a little weird.  Maybe next time I will toast it or something.  I know a cheesesteak doesn't have toasted bread, but it's also not swimming in cheese sauce.  It made the bread a little doughy.  Leftovers this morning are not quite as good as the dish was for dinner last night, so I would recommend trying to consume it all in one fell swoop.  A great recipe, though.  Definitely worth trying and possibly making again!  Thanks!

Super yum! BAsed on what others said, I used 1 box Stove Top stuffing on the bottom by soaking the bread stuff and forming into a thin crust. I then put it under the broiler for 2 minutes to firm & crisp. No beer either, used drippings from the beef and beef broth, as suggested also. Due to the Stuffing, I lessened all spices, especially salt. I know I tweeked it a bit, but this recipe is AWESOME.

This has a really nice flavor and I liked it better reheated.  I think this would be a good recipe to make the night before, so all the flavors can blend before baking.  There is a strong beer flavor to it, so I recommend using half the beer and drinking the other half while you cook!

This was between 3 and 4 stars for me. I think it's a great recipe, but I didn't expect it to taste so much like beer. I think if I make this again, I'd maybe use beef boullion or cook some of the alcohol out of the beer. It was just too overpowering for me since I wanted to taste Philly cheese steak, not beer. But, in general I think it's a great idea for a casserole and everything else about it was good!

I rated this recipe based on the confidence that it would be wonderful if made as written. I made it with frozen Philly steaks, which I'm sure affected the quality slightly. (Next time I would cook the steaks as directed on the package, in a skillet, instead of heating them along with the spices and broth.)Not having beer, I used beef broth and a little balsamic vinegar. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because my hubby thought the bread on the bottom was too soggy, but our preferences differ on this point. The cheese on top gave it a great texture to balance the soggy bread, in my opinion. Thanks for a great idea!

What a great idea!
the sauce is so good.
I used red, yellow, and orange peppers instead of green.
I also only used monterey and cheddar cheese.

We didn't like it at all.  Don't know if I fixed it wrong, probably did.  Didn't like the consistency of it.

Wow!  My teenage son is the pickiest eater, and loved this dish.  I used artisan bread, cut it into cubes, sprayed the cubes with butter flavored oil and sprinkled garlic powder over it all.  I then baked the cubes for about 20 minutes.  I didn't have green peppers, so I used red and I'm glad I did.  I also used 3 pounds of ribeye steak that I had just bought.  Everyone loved the slightly sweet flavor.  The cheese sauce absolutely made the dish.  Leftovers heated up well the next day.  I will be making this again!

Got rave reviews at party I brought it to. I did add a variety of different cheeses that I prefer- mont. jack w/jalapeno-adds nice little bite,and cheddar with the provolone. Also used "Amoroso" type roll instead of italian bread. Loved it!!!

Didn't like the sogginess of the bread. The sauce was nice. DH didn't like the cheese on top. We finished it but won't repeat.

this was so incredibly good! i made it with two minor alterations: i would recommend spraying the bread cubes with pam and sprinkling garlic on it beforehand. and i wouldn't use as much beer, but try to balance it out with beef broth! other than that it was AMAZING! thank you for putting this up!

Very good! I made it for Father's Day ahead of time. I think everyone will enjoy it. I had a lot of round steak which is pretty tough. So I simmered the heck out of it till it was tender. Also, I just mixed all the spices and liquids (except milk) together to simmer with the beef. I threw the onions and peppers in at the end. I sub'd a little  bacon fat for the butter since I had some from another recipe...not low fat but tastes great! :-)

This was not good at all.
I did prebake the bread cubes, but then followed the recipe as written.
The bread is mushy after baking.  The taste distantly resembles a Philly cheese steak.  The beer gives the cheese sauce a strange flavor.  
The expense of a tender rib eye is lost, it comes out tough.

This is the first negative review I have ever left, first recipe I have ever tried that I am deleting out of my box. I love phillycheese steaks, I love beer, I love to cook and 99.9% of the time I  can take the recipe on here and reviewers suggestions and come out with something awesome. This was not. It was mushy and bland and expensive to have three bites eaten and not eat the rest of the casserole.  My husband and I did not like this one at all. I wish I could make it to our liking but I am not even going to try this one again. Good luck.

A big hit with everyone.  I used 2 onions, orange bell pepper, added mushrooms and used Focaccia bread.  Re: paragraph 5 - it confused me, so I added each spice only once and it turned out great.

I had it all ready to serve and hubby came home and said he already ate.  Well, into the fridge it went for tomorrow.  But, I tasted the cheese sauce and it was great.  For those that said it tasted of beer, they probably did not cook off the beer long enough. Can't wait to see how it tastes in whole.  I did leave out the peppers... cause hubby doesn't like peppers. It does take a bit to cook it but take your time and you will be happy.

I toasted the bread cubes, but I think I may double toast next time to get the consistency closer to croutons or try the stovetop suggestion in other posts. 
Doubled the Worcestershire and hot sauce. I'd also half the beer or just swap for beef broth and natural juices. The presence of the beer flavor is distracting. My husband LOVED this.

I thought this was pretty good.  My hubby said he would rather have an actual philly cheese steak. He wasnt big on the bread at the bottom but I liked it.  I ended up using beef broth instead of beer just because of some of the reviews.  I also sauteed some mushrooms with the peppers and onions. I thought this was a pretty creative recipe!

3.5-4 for me also. The flavor was good, altho we didn't think it tasted anything like philly cheese steak. It was very black-peppery. I did not bake this w/the bread, I served it on the side-my hubby doesn't like mushy bread at all. That part worked out perfect for us.

Yummy! I made the recipe as presented. Next time, I will pop the ribeye into the freezer for 10 minutes to make the slicing easier, cook the ribeye until there is a bit of pink left (it will finish cooking in the oven), and finally, I will let the casserole sit for 10 minutes before serving to allow the bread and sauce to be set. This last suggestion will be the most difficult as it smells and tastes so good!

I made this with a few differences. I cut the recipe in half because there was only two of us and I used toasted (to prevent sogginess) white bread slices making it more like an open-faced sandwich and New York steak. My friend and I really loved it and I will be making it again with bread cubes. I was surprised that the alcohol taste cook out a lot while in the oven, there was more taste before hand. Thank you for the recipe.

Yum!  There was a good kick to it. Next time I might not use the full can of beer (you could really taste the beer) and use a little less black pepper and hot sauce. Overall delicious!  Leftovers are just as good if not better than fresh from the oven.

I left the beer out all together! I purchased a cheap eye round cut of steak. I cooked the steak in crock pot with can of beef broth and equal water. I through in some of the spices and a bay leaf, cooked on low for 6 hours. I followed the rest of the directions and only added the spices once ie, pharagragh 5 was confusing.  I used a loaf of sliced stale french bread. I sprayed bread with pam and a dash of garlic powder then toasted on both side. Poured cheese sauce over meat and veggie and bread. Added the cheese on top and baked.  I used the beef broth to the cheese sauce instead of beer! Everything was really dry before the cheese sauce was added, so I think that is partly why the bread did'nt get soagy.

Looked as good as it tasted.  Although I did crisp my bread ahead of time in the oven and didn't use the milk -- just the beer.  Nummy.

AWESOME and unique recipe.  Husband loved it.  Has a taste which reminds me of french onion soup.  It is fairly rich and very filling, and makes a lot, so I will half the recipe next time (3 of us eating) since we aren't big on leftovers.
