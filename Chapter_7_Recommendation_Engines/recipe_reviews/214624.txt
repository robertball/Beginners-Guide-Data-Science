This is so good!  I've made horchata before but not like this version.  I put it in a milk bottle and my neighbor thought it was just that and poured herself a glass.  What a surprise!!  Now she's into making horchata at her house.  Thanks!!  Rum does work in it too.

Patience!!! Takes a while to make this but OHH is it worth it. For those having trouble straining it try placing a double layer of cheese cloth over a bowl and secure with a large rubber band. Pour puree over cheese cloth and allow to drain. Repeat process using a sieve to get the smaller particles out. It's an extra step but much easier than trying to force it through a sieve the first time and gives you a much smoother puree to finish with.

I made this today and just tried it--delicious!  I have never tried horchata, so I have no basis for comparison, but I like it a lot.  My only issue was trying to strain the rice mixture...it just didn't seem to be flowing through the sieve...maybe a drop at a time, but at times not even that.  I finally took a flat glass pitcher lid and used that to press the top of the mixture, and then it came through.  Does anyone know if there is a way to make that process easier?  It did eventually work though, and it tastes great!  I highly recommend adding the rum.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used a 15 oz. can of Creme of Coconut, which made it sweet enough to not add the sweetened condensed milk.  I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon before straining the mixture and finished it off with 1/2 cup of half & half to make it a bit creamier.  Next time I would run the final product through a blender to incorporate the creme of coconut better.  Delicious!  It got rave reviews from everyone!

Try straining it in batches.  I use a large wire strainer and I fill it 1/3 of the way full before I dump out the rice.

Wow.... this is amazing!!!  This is the perfect drink for a nice sunny day, very refreshing.

while making this, i found it was easier to strain out the almond, rice, and coconut mixure if i poured it in small amounts instead of all at once.  then i took a piece of aluminum foil and pressed down on it to get all of the liquid out.  i'm going to recommend this recipe to all of my friends!

This was so good! Ive made horchata before using another recipe and it was horrible. This recipe was delicious. The almonds and the coconut add so much, and using the sweetened condesed milk made it sweet but not sugary. This is my go to recipe from now on. Thank you!

We love this recipe. We use up the leftover rice to make a creamy rice pouding-type concoction.

Absolutely the best horchatta I have ever tasted!  I agree with other reviewers that it was difficult to strain the mixture, but well worth the time.  I served this at a family gathering and everyone loved it including the children.

The BEST horchata I have ever had, though I did add a hint of cinnamon! It was a hit within my household! I will most certainly make this again soon!

I could have just opened a jar of cream of coconut and poured that into my glass. 

WAY too sweet.

I used about half of the SCM and it was sweet enough.  Very delicious.  Nice coconut flavour.  I'll make this again.

Takes some work, but well worth the effort. I would recommend straining it through a large sieve into a bowl (my first attempt at straining it through a small sieve into a Mason jar failed), as the rice, almond, and coconut clumps are pretty thick. I used honey roasted almonds and unsweetened coconut flakes, and Milkadamia (macadamia nut milk) instead of coconut milk and it turned out great. I used only half of the sweetened condensed milk because I know how potently sweet that stuff can get. It was still plenty sweet and had that lovely light milky taste and texture still.

Excellent!!!  I have had traditional horchata, but I love coconut and had to try this.  It isn’t too sweet and has such a great consistency.  I did add a little cinnamon, cause that’s how I roll, but it was still delicious!!!  Next cup will have the rum!  (Us pirates love our rum and coconuts!)
