I made these for my husband's office for breakfast.  Very simple ingredients - just make sure it is well incorporated before rolling into balls.  It will look very dry and crumbly, but, keep working with it and it will come together into a smooth ball.  Make sure you don't see any of the dry Bisquick.  I only used about 1-1/2 lbs of sausage and about 1-1/2 cups of Bisquick.  My oven cooks hot - so, I also baked at 350 for 20 minutes instead of 400 and they were perfect.  I also baked them on a parchment covered baking sheet and they came right off the paper. Thanks, Mitchell!

I have found that if I microwave the sausage for a bit, it  is easier to mix with the other ingredients.  After cooling, I freeze these in a ziplock bag and microwave as many as needed for breakfast.

FYI - It says makes 12 servings, and my batch made 60 1-1.5" balls. So I guess it's 5 balls = 1 serving?

The sausage I used was 1 lb Great Value brand mild pork sausage (in the chub) + 4 links (about .8 lbs) of Great Value mild Italian pork sausage. I didn't have sharp cheddar, so I used medium cheddar (Tillamook) and grated a little over half of my full pound brick. (a little extra cheese to make up for the too little sausage).  A full 2 cups of regular bisquick.   It made 62 balls for me. Baked at 400 for 17 minutes on parchment paper lined pans. These produce a fair amount of oil/grease, so best to use a fully rimmed pan to prevent spills when taking out of the oven. 

The flavor was great, though mild. Perfect for the kid and parent crowd at my party tomorrow, though sophisticated palettes will appreciate using the hot sausage and sharp cheddar IMHO.

I've been making these for years. I use the Bob Evans Zesty style pork sausage for mine. Really gives it a nice kick without bing too hot. I always add more cheese because well, CHEESE!! I add 2 tsp. baking powder as well. This really makes them puff up. I also use 1/2 Cup of water, otherwise they're a little dry. One more thing I'd like to add is that I grate my own cheese. When you buy the pre-grated cheese they put some drying chemicals on it so the cheese won't stick together. That dries out the sausage balls. Just grate your own, you'll not be sorry you did. These sausage balls are SO much better when you do it yourself.

I was searching for a cheese ball recipe and happened to find this recipe.  I've been making this EXACT recipe for years.  If you don't have hot sausage or want more kick, try adding some crushed red pepper.  These sausage balls are requested of me all the time!  And they are really simple to make.  You can mix ingredients and shape the balls a few days in advance if needed.  You might want to save a few for breakfast the next morning.  :)

These are great.  I've been trying to find a recipes for Hot Shots that I've had at Wild Wings on Hilton Head Island.  Yum.  These are the closest I've gotten.  I served them with the "Yummy Honey Mustard Dip" found on Allrecipes. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/yummy-honey-mustard-dipping-sauce/detail.aspx

I covered my baking sheet with parchment paper and turn them half way through baking.  They lift off easily.

Super easy recipe that I have used for years. I use the heart healthy Bisquick because it does not have partially hydrogenated oils in it. I also make sure to use a high quality/local sausage for better flavor and less fat. Using foil is a great idea only if they are sprayed with nonstick oil. Otherwise, they stick! I like to use the foil as I have many different coated/color cookie sheets and the foil helps make all the meatballs more uniform when baked, no matter the pan!

These are kinda good. I made them using the exact recipe. I was surprised when I made them, I thought when I made 1.5" balls that they would shrink a little, but they turned out huge! I didn't add anything to spice it up since it called for hot sausage, but the ones I picked out were overpoweringly spicy. It would be better to refine this recipe using mild sausage and a measure of complimentary spices. I also used the 8 ounces of sharp cheddar as called for but it didn't come through in the finished product very well, especially against the spice and Bisquick. Both my brother and I tried these (incidentally he works at McDonalds) and even though I did not tell him there was bisquick in these he said "I handle a lot of sausage and pancakes every morning, and that's what this tastes like, but spicier." He then broke out the maple syrup and dipped them in it, and that's when it became clear: this is not a great party food or a great starter or app, but it IS decent as a breakfast item. If you want a good party version of this, I would use more cheese, a lot less bisquick, and melt some cheese over the top of the balls at the end. Also, they should be closer to 1" in diameter. If you keep them as is, they might be good as part of some kind of breakfast meatball sandwich!

Delicious!  I used Jimmy Deans sausage, did NOT precook it before baking, baked at 350 bc my oven cooks hot.  These were a HUGE hit at a church breakfast.  I will make these again!

They weren't anywhere near done - sausage was still raw and outsides were practically burned.

My family has been making these for as long as I can remember. Using a good quality of sausage and sharp cheddar makes a big difference. Personally, I like them better after they've been frozen. It may sound strange, but freezing them first seems to help maintain the moisture better while they're cooking.

Fantastic! I did have to cook them about 30 minutes though.  Also, I used the finely shredded cheese.  I think it mixed better.

I had never heard of sausage balls before.  My sister-in-law (who's from the South) says these are very common and made them for our Christmas dinner.  AMAZING!!  Loved them.  Highly recommended and truly the easiest thing in the world to make.

I made these for a Christmas gathering, and they were liked by all who tried them. I can tell you, they are DELICIOUS right out of the oven. After they've cooled, pop a few in the microwave for 15 seconds or so. It makes them more tender and brings out all the flavors.

So, so, so good.  And so easy too!  I added a little extra cheese which oozed out as they baked and became crispy and fried-like around the bottom.  Was an awesome Thanksgiving appetizer.  Will definitely make these again soon.

Very good if you add a little more cheese (and oil?), and you are careful not to overcook.

Love these for Christmas morning. Tip: Mix sausage and Bisquick first, then add cheese. SO much easier.

I forgot how much I love these!  Since my daughter prefers ground turkey, we used Jennie-O Italian Style ground turkey and added red pepper flakes and creole seasoning. Delicious!

This was very easy to make I think the hardest part was making sure everything was mixed well. But it turned out well.

Delicious! Added chopped wild onion and a touch of garlic. I love sage, so I added a lot to my pork sausage. I added more cheese too because, why not? Yummy!

I've been making these for years.  I use all hot sausage (we love spicy!) and I also add a couple  dashes of garlic powder over the sausage before mixing it all up with my hands.  Oh!  And I grate my own sharp cheddar, also.  Makes a big difference!

Made these exactly as recipe stated. Turned out great. Recommend spraying tinfoil with nonstick spray! Very good.

I used hot  and mild sausages,  8 oz of sharp cheddar cheese, 4 oz of cream cheese,  1.5 cup of pancake mix, and made 45 balls. I froze the balls before baking , and baked them in 350 degrees for 25 minutes. They came out moist and tasty.  Also I used silicone baking mat so they easily came off. Next time I will put sliced jalapeno and onion.

Love this recipe and have made multiple times. We use 1 package of sage sausage and one of hot. And we just about double the cheese. A favorite at our house!

The only change I  made was I used two  tubes of Jimmy Dean's hot sausage because my husband love hot sausage. I don't eat them but he gives them 5 stars. He said they are the best ones I have made yet.

Made these Christmas morning and they were a hit. I have made them before and everyone loved them, but this time I halved the recipe. I used 1 package of sausage and 1 cup Pioneer Brand baking mix but I inadvertently used the entire 8oz package of cheese. They were even better than before. Doubling the cheese made them even crunchier and better, IMO.

Parchment paper covered pan works the best!  No aluminum foil to stick to the balls and no extra cooking spray needed.  Always a hit.

Vegetarian option:
I know it sounds weird making sausage balls vegetarian but I use Light Life Gimme Lean ground sausage and it works very well. I don't use vegan cheese because I feel that stuff is not very good but I do use Cabot farms cheese and it's a rennet free cheese so it just has the dairy as the only animal product. They will seem a little dry but just work them into balls and when the cheese melts they will be moist. I take these to work and the non vegetarian people have no idea their meat free.

Made this today and must tell you that these balls are absolutely delicious!!  YUM-O!  Liked the tip about spraying the tin foil; didn't do it on the first batch but managed to get them off the foil without too much trouble.  They taste like Philadelphia Scrapple which I dearly love!!  Will definitely make these again!!

I liked the recipie pretty much just as it was, my boyfriend liked it better than I did.  Unfortunately for me I don't do "hot".  The only change I will make the next time is maybe mild it down a bit for wimps like me. :-)

Maybe I've been depriving myself from the whole sausage biscuit thing but my goodness, these are tasty. I made them for a party at the last minute (super duper easy!) and they were the first thing gone from the table!  Perfect app snack, football day treat for a large crowd. So easy, the kids even helped make 'em!

Turned out too greasy, so I warn that you should be careful the sausage you use.  Used a different brand and they were great!
