I used regular lettuce and left the tomato off due to my husbands personal preference. Because I left off the tomato (I would have loved the tomato by the way) I gave the sandwich a sprinkle of paprika for some color. My mom always sprinkled that on her deviled eggs so I thought why not? This was really good. If you are like me and you like vinegary-y things you will love this. For the hot sauce I used Sriracha because it is thicker and I was going for a Sriracha mayo flavor. Excellent!

3.30.18  I love this egg salad’s vinegary tang, that’s what makes it so special.  I used English Muffin Bread (what I had on hand) and skipped the tomato slices (personal preference).  But I could see removing the pulp from a tasty summer tomato, stuffing it with this egg salad, and just skipping the bread.  I gave this an extra shake of Tabasco® and used Popa’s Pickled Eggs from this site.  Phoebe, thanks for sharing your recipe, it’s good.

The only thing that would make this better is a slight dusting of black pepper on the tomato.  :) Or put it on a pile of spring salad mix and mix in, awesome!
