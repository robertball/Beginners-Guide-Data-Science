As is, a pretty basic marinara sauce.  I followed the recipe except to add 1/4 couple of dried minced onion.  The sauce cooked on low all day (at least 10 hours) and did not get thick.  It fit the bill for what I needed for dinner as we were having meat filled ravioli.  I am going to freeze the remainder and will probably tweak it when I reuse it.

One thing that I failed to put in directions was that you should not cover crock pot, it makes moisture and your sauce will thin out

I only had one can of tomato sauce, so used one can of tomato sauce and one can of tomato soup.  The rest of the recipe was the same.  After the sauce was done, I added it to saute'd veggie burger with onions and garlic.  Delicious!

Basic recipe but that's what makes it a good all purpose sauce.  Only change I made was adding 1 t. minced garlic.
