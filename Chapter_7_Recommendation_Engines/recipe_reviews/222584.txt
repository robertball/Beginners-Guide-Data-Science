Five stars for taste, ease of preparation and aesthetic appeal. So versatile! Add whatever you might put in an omelet or scrambled eggs. Great way to use up vegetables in the fridge too! In this case I browned the bacon, drained most of the grease, added finely chopped multi-colored bell peppers and onions, briefly sauteed that, then added it to my beaten eggs (which I just mixed with salt and pepper and half-and-half) along with some sliced black olives and garden fresh chives. I baked it in a pretty, shallow buttered casserole. No muss, no fuss, free to do other things while it baked, and it cut into individual servings perfectly. This will definitely be a re-do.

I made this in my cast iron skillet. After I cooked the bacon, I saved some of the bacon drippings to cook the egg ingredients in. I did use lactose free milk and I cut the cheese back to a half cup only because my son is sensitive to milk. My sons and I liked this. I served this with my homemade waffles, which my kids used their frittata to make waffle sandwiches, and fruit salad.

AWESOME! 
I put the whole bacon package and 2/3 of the green onion package. Even my picky little son finished his whole plate. 
Thanks for sharing.

I printed a recipe on 2/19/2012 called; Bacon Cheese Frittata. Just made it this morning for the 1st time. This recipe for a Bacon Cheese Frittata is exactly like the one from 2/19/12, which is not on AR anymore?? Regardless, this is the exact recipe submitted by someone else and it was delish! Easy and fast and DH loved it. I used Costco Precooked Bacon and used about 10 pieces. Nuked for 1.20 seconds on paper towels. Let cool and then crumpled. Stirred all ingredients in the pie dish once I had added them all. Will make this again!

I made this recipe for the first time today but in my opinion along with my husband's opinion it is a keeper.  I had some eggs that needed to be used before house sitting so I ended up using 10 eggs adjusting the amount of mile to 1 and 2/3 cup of 2% milk but I didn't double the butter. It still came out awesome and fluffy.  I did adjust some of the of the additives however I used: 
1/2 of a yellow onion (diced)
1 red pepper (diced)
2 Tbs. of hot paprika
6 slices of bacon total 
It went into the oven in a 13x9 baking pan for only 25 minutes.
A nice and easy way to start off our rainy Sunday morning.

Made this tonight for a cheap dinner and loved it.  Fast, easy, cooked perfectly (and I'm a sucky cook).  I added a little extra bacon and exchanged the green onion for 1/2 cup of green pepper.  This recipe will be much used in the future.

Baked this easy breakfast/brunch recipe this morning.  This recipe was the Recipe Group's selection for the week of 12/7/12. I HALVED PART OF THIS RECIPE. Last night, I microwaved six slices of bacon and tossed the bacon, onions and about 1/4 cup of green pepper into the food processor and pulsed for a few seconds and stored in the refrigerator. This morning, I prepared a 5" x 7" glass baking dish.  I beat 3 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk, added the salt and pepper.  Poured the egg mixture into the prepared baking dish and then sprinkled the bacon mixture over the top, followed by 1/2 cup of shredded cheese.  Baked for 30 minutes.  Puffed up nicely and cut into nice firm pieces to serve.  I'm glad I added the green pepper and next time I make it, I will add some garlic and maybe nutmeg.  A dash of hot sauce would add to it as well. Overall, an excellent, versatile  brunch/type recipe.

This hit the spot! I had about a half a pound of mushrooms that needed using so I sliced them up and fried them after frying the bacon.  Otherwise followed the recipe and mixed the eggs and milk in the blender.  I baked for 30 minutes and it is perfect!!

Recipe Group Selection:  08, December 2012 ~ I fixed this for dinner for a DH who is NOT crazy about breakfast for dinner.  I did add some yellow onion, red and yellow peppers along with the green onions.  He liked it and ate two helpings, although he added that this would be awesome if I would serve it for breakfast where eggs belong!  This baked up nicely in 25 minutes.  I served this with 'Classic Hash Browns' for him and 'Sweet and Sassy Hash Browns' for me.  Both are AR recipes.  Thanks millie m m for sharing this recipe.  I know I will be making this again..........for breakfast!

Easy, delicious, versatile - what's not to like? 
I used diced yellow onion in place of green onions, sauteed kielbasa chunks instead of bacon (faster), and a half cup cream/half cup milk. I used an electric mixer on the eggs, milk, and cream to produce a fluffy consistency, and I will never skip this step in any future renditions of this dish. Finished the bake with a few minutes under the broiler on LOW.

We made this but sauteed a vidalia onion with some mushrooms. Extra cheese and bacon was added as well. It was pretty tasty, but next time I would add some fresh herbs or something to give it a little more of a 'pop'.

I made it as directed, but couldn't stop myself from adding things:  feta cheese, red bell pepper, olives, garlic, and a handful of arugula.  It was a major hit!  It baked exactly as the recipe says, in 27 minutes at 350.  It was a lovely light supper with a salad, and one we will be having again soon.  Loved it!

Wonderful recipe. I went through my fridge and dug out the veggies I had in there. I added chopped asparagus, red, green and yellow peppers. About 1/3 cup of each. I used low fat back bacon and added 2 more eggs (total of 8) as well to compensate for all the extra veggies. Lastly I mixed 2 tsp of Italian seasoning in place of the salt. SOOO delicious, and an easy way to slip in those veggies! Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was a very easy, tasty frittata.  I made a few simple changes.  I didn't have fresh onions on hand so I added dried ones.  Also had some leftover tomato in the fridge, so I chopped that and added it.  For color, I sprinkled in some dried basil and parsley.  It was pretty and yummy!  I have added this to my recipe box and will make it again.

Made this Frittata for the recipe group selection of 12/7/12. I'm eating it as I write this review. A pretty simple dish to make, filled the 7X11 casserole dish perfectly. I did saute a red bell pepper and mushrooms that were begging to go in this dish or go bad. I used 2% milk since that is all we drink, and even with my added vegetables this held together very nicely on the plate. Tasted wonderful, looked beautiful and smelled heavenly while baking. A wonderful brunch dish that just about any vegetable or cheese you want to use would work just fine.

I made this for a lazy weekend brunch for the family. It came out just beautiful! I omitted the salt as I was using smoked bacon, and added a sprinkle of parsley with the cheese. The fritata was light, fluffy, tasty and just delicious! The whole family are begging me to make it again regularly! Thank you for such a delicious recipe.

I’ve been using this recipe for years. It’s a great recipe that you can modify to suit your taste. I add mushrooms and tomatoes. I do have to increase the cook time since those ingredients are “wet”. Thank you for sharing this with us!!!!

Delicious!  I used a whole packet of bacon with 12 slices. I crumbled the bulk of it to bake and then 5 pieces crumbled on top after it baked. It was a huge hit!

This is a great and easy recipe.  I did do a couple of changes.  I used an oven prove skillet in which I cooked the bacon.  Instead of green onion I used white onion which I diced and added to skillet after the bacon had particialy cooked.   After onion was tranleten I added the beaten eggs, topped with a mixture of cheddar and mozerella cheese then put it into the oven to back.   Loved by all.

This was a winner at a potluck brunch with friends.  Added a little more bacon of course and onion powder.  I had to cook longer than 30 mins -- closer to 45, but simple, easy recipe. This is going in my favorites.  Will make again.

We really liked this recipe, I kept all of the basic original ingredients the same with the exception of leaving out the salt. I doubled the recipe and made it three times using standard sized muffin cups, those cook in about 18 minutes and I used sausage and ham in two batches and mushrooms and spinach in one, I'll be keeping this recipe to make multiple times. I froze all of the individual portions for future breakfasts.

I love this recipe. I omitted white onions since I absolutely detest them, but I love scallions so added plenty of them.I whisked all the ingredients in with the egg mixture, then added extra cheese on top. Delicious! Thanks for sharing

We really enjoyed this easy to prepare, quick breakfast!  It was nice not to have to make a crust...this is basically a crustless quiche.  I added a few vegetables: red bell pepper, garlic and thinly sliced tomatoes on top.  I also added garlic and onion powders because we typically have those in our eggs.  Baked biscuits, bacon and a pear topped with yogurt rounded out the meal.  This will be made again and again.  I'm already thinking about possible combinations, ham & swiss cheese, zucchini with Italian herbs, spicy with jalapenos served with a bit of salsa.  The possibilities are endless.

A delicious basic recipe than can easily be modified with ingredients to your liking. Based on other reviews, I added fresh herbs to liven it up . It was super easy and quick to make!

This was delicious. I did make a couple of minor additions, I added about a 1/2 cup of sauteed onions and a little bit of garlic powder to the egg mixture. And I'm sure I went over on the cheese.  I will definitely be making it again.

I prepared this  yesterday for Christmas breakfast in the morning. I just popped it in the oven while family opened presents in morning. Very simple to make.  The taste was very good.  my husband and I enjoyed it.  My kids thought it was ok.  I made it exactly as recipe was written.  Next time I will omit the green onions and cheddar.  I will swap that out for mozzarella, ricotta cheese and Parmesan to give it a more thick taste.  Thank you for sharing.

Versatile and delicious.  I layered homemade hashbrowns, cheddar cheese, bacon bits (for convenience), broccoli, and chives.  I used the egg base given in the recipe and cooked according to directions but used what I had laying around.  Since bacon bits are saltier in my opinion than fresh cooked bacon, I ommitted half the salt in the eggs.  It was loved by all in the house.

Very consistent each time, however I am not a fan of green onions, so I sprinkle some onion powder in with the egg mixture and also some dried minced onion. Always a winner!

Wow so good!!  I added a cup of frozen hash-browns thawed and patted dry. Also used a little more bacon and some Monterrey jack cheese along with sharp cheddar. Mind you it didn't need anything extra I was just hungry and thought it sounded good. Will make this again and again and again. Already looking forward to having the leftovers for a quick and delicious work day breakfast.

I've never rated a recipe before and this one was so good that I had to do it. I followed the salt and pepper amounts but I added 1/2 cup of Parmesan Cheese and the topping cheese was mozzarella. Highly recommended. Ate it with Italian Bread

Made with ham instead of bacon. I sautéed the ham with onion and peppers in a cast iron skillet. Baked in that same skillet.

I made this last night and used 10 eggs because using 6 made it too thin in the baking dish. I used sliced turkey sausage links instead of bacon and shredded colby jack cheese. I added mushrooms and sliced grape tomatoes on top for color. It was delicious and beautiful. We'll be eating it as planned overs tonight for dinner.

We liked it other than adding the salt along with the bacon was too much. I used bacon bits I keep in the freezer. Next time I will eliminate the salt and only make half the recipe. I also added some finely chopped onion to the  mix and just before serving added some fresh chopped tomato to the top.

I made this for breakfast for girls weekend at the lake and everyone loved it! It had a great taste. To save time I cooked the bacon at home before we left and sautéed half a white onion instead of green onions. It still turned out great. I also used mozzarella instead of cheddar.

Great recipe!! I've made it 4 times over 2 weeks we love it so much! I've used bacon twice and sausage twice. I add sweet onion to it. I cook the sweet onion in the bacon grease or sausage drain then add the egg mixture to my iron skillet and cook in oven. It's fantastic and a great way to stay keto is  by using whole fat sour cream instead of milk.

Made a smaller version, halved everything. Used caramelized onions instead of green. Needed a bit more salt at service, but I have an empty dish to prove it was that good for the 2 of us.

Was so easy and delicious! I sautéed chopped onions and canned mushrooms together, also chopped black olives and added all to the eggs. Did not add melted butter because of the  sautéed I did. Will make this frequently mixing it up with different ingredients.

This will be a staple in my home from now on! Fantastic!  I only did one thing different because we always put salsa on our eggs.  Instead, I sliced up cherry tomatoes & spread them out on top midway through the cooking.

Just delicious!  The ONLY thing I altered was the couple of shakes of dry mustard in the egg mixture.  It is a knee-jerk move for me when making any kind of baked egg dish.  Everything else was strictly the recipe as written.  Will be making again and again and again.  BTW, it is equally delicious eaten the next day.

This was a hit during a ladies brunch. Super easy to do and packed with flavor.  I may cut down on the salt a little next time because the bacon was already salty to me.

Amazing, easy, delicious. I didn't use the green onion because i am not a fan of veggies for breakfast. I will add potato next time, but everything about it (taste,look,and texture) was amazing. My wife and picky 10 year old loved it. Gone in 60 seconds!

This is a hit with my family and friends.  My gluten-free and my low carb diet friends were delighted with it. Recipe can be cut in half. Use the same size pan, temperature, And bake time. Especially nice looking if you use the Allrecipes.com  baked bacon on the top

Tastes just like an omelette. A little salty- but that was my bad. I accidentally doubled the salt. Ops!AND I substituted oil for butter. Also I used an 8x8 pan. It took 40 minutes to cook through.

Both my husband and I liked it.  Very easy to make.  It's like a quiche without the crust.  I didn't have green onions so I used a yellow onion.  Next time, I'm going to add more bacon.

Excellent and very easy to make! I included the bacon, some cheddar, and some onions I had on hand (Vidalia onions are the House Brand at my place). This recipe is very versatile--it would be great with peppers, sausage instead of bacon, ham, broccoli, whatever you have on hand. I omitted the milk  because I like it fluffier. My first time making it--definitely a keeper!

I have made this recipe a couple times and loved it and how easy it was to make. I made a couple changes, using chopped onions and about a half cup more of cheese than it called for. My house guests all raved about it and asked for the recipe.

Very easy and fllexible.  I've made complicated stove top and oven frittatas and worked sometimes and failed sometimes.  This was super simple and reheated well.  I through in some leftover turkey as well.  Very flexible. Reheats well also.

I scaled the recipe down for one serving and made it in my Jamie Oliver tapas dish (5"×1") and baked in my toaster oven. The only thing I substituted was white onions instead of green because I didn't have any. It came out perfect at 25 minutes maybe even a little over done. I use the convection setting on the oven.  I would recommend using extra crispy bacon.  My bacon was well cooked but came out a little chewy.  Will definitely make again and looking forward to trying other ingredients.

I first made this in January 2011, with bacon. Tonight I used 4 cut up sausage patties and I posted a picture. It's really good either way, but I prefer bacon!

Omitted the green onions in favor of package of C&W ultimate Southwest blend frozen vegetables.  I probably added too much as the finished frittata didn't hold together well.  The addition of the black beans, corn, bell pepper, onion and roasted chillies along with finishing it under the broiler for a handful of minutes definitely made it tasty and beautiful, but there was so much packed in that the eggs struggled to keep the whole thing intact. Oh well. Served with a bit of salsa  it was the perfect midnight snack for a protein starved diabetic like me.

Quick and easy, which is just what I love first thing in the morning!  Came out very tasty.  I may try to mix it up in the future with ham or sausage, not just bacon, but it was a great one stop shop with some toast and coffee!

I added broccoli, and had to cook it a little longer than the recipe called for, but the end result was great!! We make it at the beginning of the week and have easy breakfast or emergency lunch for several days. It's delicious!

I made this at the last minute for a women's group function because I had all the ingredients on hand. I did use chives instead of green onions and I added some fresh spinach that I chopped up.  It was so easy, tasted delicious and was enjoyed by all!  I will definitely keep this one handy because it was quick, easy, versatile  and looks impressive!

Awesome!  I baked this in a cast iron skillet, and used sautéed polsa kielbasa with vidalia onion (with a dash of Worcestershire sauce during cooking) instead of bacon and green onion.   Also mixed half of the cheddar cheese in with the egg mixture before topping off with the meat, onion and cheese. Super rich and delicious!

It was super easy to make, but it was so wet that it took an extra 20 minutes until it was I able to scoop it out with a spoon! Other than that, I thought it was wonderful. My whole family liked it.

Great quick-to-make comfort food, colorful and happy looking, a tad on the salty side so I accompanied it with plain Greek yogurt on the side.

I cooked the bacon the night before and crumbled.  I sautéed onions and peppers (from a frozen mix) and added those too.  A great Easter brunch dish.

Very light and fluffy egg casserole.  I recommend using freshly shredded cheese from a real block of cheese rather than the shredded bagged variety. Next time I think I'll add some green chilies.

Very easy recipe. Made my first frittata! I added Italian seasoning and garlic. Omitted the onion. I also accidentally did not read the recipe and combined all ingredients, but came out the same.

Learning to cook and even I couldn't screw this one up.  Easy to follow and results were delicious.

Loved it!  It was so easy and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe and the only thing I did differently was add some mushrooms.  Next time I would add more mushrooms and maybe some peppers.  I did have a problem figuring out how many mushrooms I had already added because they sank into the egg mixture immediately so I couldn't tell where they were.  It was pretty moist, so I might want to use less milk next time.

Quick & yummy.  Didn't think it would be that good w/the simplicity, but I made mine w/leftover ham from Christmas & my husband & 1 year old approve.  They ate half of it.  Definitely a keeper!
