Terrible. Powdery taste, not crispy.  If you are hoping this will be like regular fried pickle chips,  you'd be very disappointed.

Although I always enjoy fried pickles I did not enjoy these much.  It took 10 minutes total and it didn't have that fried pickle taste.

Thumbs down.  Tasted like eating powder.  Very disappointed this didn't come out.  Made a couple of batches adding more cooking spray after first batch was gross and the second batch came out just  bad.

Not what I thought it would be. Pasty, dry and not crispy. Followed recipe. No go.
