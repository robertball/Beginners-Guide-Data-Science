Very reminiscent of hole-in-the-wall vegetarian cafe fare -- I do believe that is a compliment!  But the lentils & rice alone are way too bland -- I added some curry, garlic, and a bit of lemon to the mix.  The recipe was somewhat confusing - are we really supposed to spread the entire batter into a skillet and flip the whole thing when ready?  That sounded very daunting; I made patties which worked just fine.  Topping with a mint/yogurt sauce or chutney is a good idea - it's pretty dry otherwise.  I probably won't make this for dinner again, but will make a bunch to freeze - they make a great lunch.  Do not attempt to make this without a food processor!  Agh!
