I've used this recipe for years and perfect every time. You can also substitute chocolate frosting and is super rich.

So creamy and delicious! I accidentally bought a can of regular cream cheese frosting instead of the whipped, but it worked out great. These taste just like the inside of a peanut butter cup. In fact, I want to dip a few  into melted milk chocolate b/c I know it would be awesome! I can't believe that those two ingredients produced such a great fudge.  I will def be using this recipe again and again~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This simple recipe is a breeze to make and clean up is a snap.  Works great if you are vegan/have a milk allergy and nut allergies by using a jar of alternative "butter" like from soy nuts or sunflower seeds (I used Wow butter) and a dairy-free can of cream cheese frosting (I used a famous brand in the white can that starts with a "P").  Turned out great and helps me to not feel too left out during the holidays at the dessert table.  It is not meant to be a nutritious daily health food but an occasional much-needed treat.

I normally make traditional fudge but thought I would try this in a pinch. I made this with chocolate canned icing that I had on hand instead of the whipped cream cheese and it was delicious.

I used one 28-oz jar of Jif peanut butter and split it between a can of cream cheese frosting and a can of chocolate fudge frosting. I didn't use the whipped version for either, but both batches turned out beautifully. My whole family loved them! I love fudge but frequently don't get it right with regular recipes. This is going to be my go-to from now on. Delicious!

Great stuff! To thicken a bit I stir in 1/3 c. Powdered sugar.   Also try adding 1 tbsp. maple extract for maple fudge.  Also..substitute Nutella for peanut butter adding 1/3 c cocoa powder to thicken .  The possibilities are endless.

Super easy, super delicious! My mom, who makes everything from scratch, was very skeptical when I suggested this for our annual Christmas candy making event, but after the first batch, she was a convert! Iâ€™m about to make a frosting run for our third and fourth batches!

For a 2 ingredient fudge, it was easy, set perfectly, and tasted ok. Other recipes are better for taste. But, in a pinch, I'd make it again.

I love this one!!! I'm a peanut butter fiend and this is so easy that I will be making it often. The only thing I did differently was used crunchy PB instead of smooth, came out perfect!
