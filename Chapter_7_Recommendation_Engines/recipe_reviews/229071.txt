This was more a stew than soup so I added some beef broth with the water. I made it for a family of 12 but have no left-overs...too many people really liked it. It needs more seasoning so I used Mrs. Dash instead of salt. I used frozen veggies instead of canned for lower sodium and I did not peel the potatoes (for more fiber and vitamins). It was delicious and easy to make.

Very good!  My husband who is afraid of vegetables ate this up fast!  It's very filling and has wonderful flavors! He says he'll even eat the soup a second night. He doesn't do leftovers, normally. We will definitely make this fall soup again!

We really liked this soup. I had to change it a bit based on what I had on hand. I used frozen vegetables not canned, and had to use diced tomatoes. Since I made these changes I had to add extra water and I also threw in an extra can of tomato sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

I was searching for ground beef recipes and tried this one. Our family loved it. Instead of using canned veggies, I used frozen or fresh. Much higher in nutritional value. I reduced the ground beef to 1 lb and used grass fed pastured local ground sirloin. It was plenty of beef. This is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

I remember my mother making this very same soup when I was a kid, and I loved it then. Though all of her veggies were canned from the garden, this recipe is delicious!

This is our go to meal for cold weather. Have been making it for many years. Use less ground meat but lots of frozen / fresh vegetables,low sodium beef broth, no salt seasonings, fresh or dried herbs to taste, lots of garlic, low or no salt tomatoes and tomato sauce and sometimes a little pasta. Occasionally grate some Parmesan on top of each serving. Serve with a good crusty bread.

This is a huge favorite at our house.  I do add beef broth for sure.  Also hot sauce!  I make a huge pot and then freeze some.  We've gone on vacation with a gallon zip-lock of frozen soup and had a wonderful dinner when we arrived at our destination.  Love it!!

So good, and pretty low in carbs for those of us who are diabetic.   Substantial enough to be a whole meal!   Has become a favorite.

We really liked this at our house.  It is super thick -  not really a soup.  That was great for us though.  I had to add more liquid to keep it from burning on the bottom.  I will make it again!

Overall I would say this is not bad. As Mardi posted, this was more stew than soup. I didn't have any beef broth or extra room in my pot so I made it this pretty much un-doctored.  I don't think this had enough liquids to actually call this soup, but it did hit the spot.  It was a bit bland; i would recommend adding some more spices to add flavor.

Very very good soup recipes. It took significantly longer for the carrots to get soft than the 5 minutes recommended. Next time I will saut√©ed onions with the beef, then add the celery and carrots to that mixture along with the crush tomatoes and tomato sauce.

I left the hamburger out and added 3 cups of cabbage.  It was a bit thick so I thinned it out with 1 can of beef broth and a 2-3 cups of water and 2 beef bullion cubes. I adjusted the seasonings to taste. So good.

This was fantastic, like others I added beef broth to make it more of a soup. I also added garlic salt. Will definitely make it again.

This was a hit! I went with adding liquid to make it more of a soup, like everyone else did. I also added Italian seasonings, cut up some mild italian sausage and a couple cloves of garlic. I did not put peas in it though, didn't have any on hand. I served it with bread. I cooked it in a crockpot instead of the stove top. I will make it again.

Greater starter recipe to add your own touches! Since I live in LA I added garlic and rotel tomatoes for a little kick. We always love Worcestershire with any beef recipe. I had some chicken broth and added about 2 cups, frozen corn, and one large sweet potato instead of carrots. Yummy and hearty!

Great soup!  I did make some changes to account for the ingredients I had on hand.  I used 2.75 lbs of hamburger and frozen black-eyed peas instead of canned.  It was too thick with the additional meat so I added 16 oz. beef broth (made with base) and 2 cans of V8.  I adjusted the thyme and pepper for the additional ingredients.  The recipe turned out to be the best beef vegetable soup I've made so far!

I just added some Kale, Zucchini, and Broccoli to make this a vegetable powerhouse and my family actually ate it up! I also added two quarts of beef broth. I love that this recipe is super simple to make from ingredients on hand. Everything can come out of the freezer or pantry for those days when you haven't been to the store for a while. It's flexible too, still is good when ingredients change here and there.

I used this recipe as my first attempt to make vegetable beef soup and loved the way it came out.  While I started out using my dutch oven, by the time I added all the vegetables (fresh or frozen-the bag mix with okra in it was a good addition), I had to move it to the crock pot.  I added beef stock since it was very thick. Nothing is more enjoyable than warm, comfort food on chilly days and there is still some in the freezer to enjoy another day!

This was a very delicious, thick, and satifying soup for a very cold winter day.  As written I think it's more of a stew...very thick.  I added 28 oz low sodium beef broth to get this up to a soup consistency and only used 1 1/2 lb ground beef.  I also added Montreal seasoning, garlic and onion powders to the published ingredients.  Loved all of the veggies in here.  A thumbs up from hubs, too, with plenty of leftovers for the freezer.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us, Sue!

I doctored this up a bit.  Added 30 ounces of beef broth, fresh garlic, and 2 table spoons of Frank's hot sauce to give it a bit of a zing.  The added beef broth makes it a soup instead of a stew.  I would start by following the recipe and let your taste be the driver.

Made this last night and it was perfect for a cold winter day.  I made a few changes just based on what I had in the house - frozen peas instead of canned and diced tomatoes instead of whole.  I also followed the suggestion to add some additional chicken broth for some additional flavor and liquid.  I probably added about 1 cup and it resulted in a delicious and hearty soup.  My son ate 3 bowls!

Not one drop was left....great soup.  I made this the other day while I was doing last minute preps for Christmas.  I did follow the advice of one of the other reviewers and added beef broth (as listed it was more like stew and I wanted soup) - added a 32 ounce container.  That was the only change I made and everyone in my house loved it.  A definite keeper and will be making again real soon.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This was very good. I did add a can of beef broth so it was more soupy, used frozen peas instead of canned because canned peas are too mushy added some garlic, johnny's seasoning salt and a couple splashes of worcesteshire. My husband ate 2 huge bowls and even wanted to have it the next night for dinner.

This was delicious!! The ONLY thing I added was 2 cloves of garlic. We like bold flavors and I usually put garlic in all my meals. Thanks for a great recipe.

This vegetable stew is very easy and VERY good. I added a little salt, cumin and paprika to give it zip.  Not much though.  It makes a big pot that my kids finished off for lunch the next day.  I will make this again.  It takes longer than 20 minutes to prepare, plan on 45.

Flavor was good.  I added about 1.5 cups of water as it was very thick otherwise.  Everyone like it and I froze some for another day.

Why rate something when you left out the beef and added the cabbage? You would be rating your own recipe.  Small adjustments may be appreciated but I made this just as it read and it was very good.

This was a delicious soup! I added two bouillon cubes (Knorr brand) with hot water before I added it to the soup. It was more like a stew since it was so thick. I cut the recipe in half too. The hotter you want the soup, the more pepper you add. I will definitely making this again.

Very good recipe.  Used fresh vegetables instead of canned.  Also, I finely chopped 2 of our fresh chili's and threw them in to simmer with with my beef and vegetable mixture.  Lastly, I added some fresh chopped kale just near the end to give a little more dimension in flavour.

This was great but must admit, I changed it up quite a bit because I was emptying out the freezer & pantry due to leaving our vacation home after several months. I used ground chicken and all of the veggies came from the freezer. I also used a can of diced tomatoes and liked the bits of tomato for color. Many added broth, I had a 48oz box of low sodium beef broth that needed to be used, I added the entire thing and loved the result. Hubs commented he really liked it and we have several containers in the freezer for the last few weeks of vacation!

Very good basic recipe. easy to switch up to make it your own. also a good way to use up leftover veggies and hamburgers. ( especially hambugers cooked on the grill) to make it easier i will just use the frozen bag of mixed vegetables and usually instead of plain tomatoes i will use ro-tel. also great to use macaroni noodles to bulk it up a bit and make it a little heartier.

I've been making this stew for the last 40+ years.  It's a great way to save on those high beef prices for stew meat and you get meat in pretty much every bite using ground beef instead.  I haven't found any one family or friend who hasn't loved stew however it's made.   It's so versatile that you can literally dump in every thing but the kitchen sink and it will always turn out yummy!  You can make it with tomato juice if you don't have tomato sauce or you can omit both and just add canned diced tomatoes.  You can add beef broth (liquid, cubed or granular) or none at all.  You can add any veggies your family likes including ones you wouldn't normally use in a stew and it will still come out good!  Use any seasoning your family likes best but do add some garlic to your browning beef (it really adds to the beef flavor) as well as some diced onions as your browning your meat.  You can use all canned veggies, home canned veggies or frozen veggies or a combination there of.  I can't imagine anyone screwing up a stew especially if you just use what your family likes.  I don't normally use bay leaf in my stew but I imagine it would only add another layer of flavor.  For those new cooks out there don't be afraid to dump any veggies your family normally likes in it.  I promise it will come out amazing.  Sometimes I even put in some cabbage in our stew if I have it but not always.  We also like a few diced bell peppers in ours.  This stuff is just as good warmed up a day or even three

Made this as the recipe says, with the exception of adding beef broth since I like my soups a little more, well, soupy.. It was very good but seems to need more seasonings. But still pretty darn good!

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I added a cup of Quinoa in the last 15 minutes of cooking. I ended up adding several (I lost track) cups of water for it to be a soup. Maybe I will add vegetable stock next time.

Hearty and easy to make. I think I would cut down the number of potatoes though. I used three and that was a bit too many. Also, be sure to add a little water each time you reheat and cut the potatoes up small.

This soup was so simple to make and turned out delicious!! 
Reading the reviews was really helpful. Using ground chuck, I didn't need to drain the meat because there was hardly any grease. I omitted the water and used 2 containers of beef broth (about 32 oz. each). Also, I don't use the thyme or bay leaf because I didn't have any on hand, and it still turned out great. Sometimes I'll add a small can of tomato paste if I'm going for a stronger tomato flavor. This soup has become a staple in our home!! Thank you!!

This soup was fantastic, my whole family loved it, though my middle daughter said it was not "soup" because it was so thick.  Making it again next week.  Only change was I used beef broth instead of water and probably added a whole cup and I also threw in some Spicy V8 that I had left over.  Seriously, so good!!

So far it smells great (and tastes great as well)!! I added 32oz of beef stock and drained the beans and peas (if I feel it's too runny, I figure I can add Arrowroot powder to thicken). I also added about 1TBS of Oregano, Parsley, and Basil along with a lot of extra Thyme with liberal salt and pepper. I think the seasonings are a little light, plus I'm going through an Italian phase :) I also added about 4 garlic cloves to the beef while it was browning, omitted the corn, and used sweet potatoes instead of reg potatoes. We shall see! I'll report back!

Since this recipe received great reviews, I decided to double the recipe on the first try.  I'm glad I did.  First, I agree with what everyone said on adding more liquid.  I added 2 cups of no sodium beef broth, and it wasn't enough (I didn't have any more room).  My soup still came out like a stew.  Didn't bother me because it was so tasty.  I did some small changes to the original recipe:  I sauteed the onions with the beef and substituted the peas & green beans with frozen edamame & frozen cauliflower (hubby doesn't like peas or green beans).  Will definitely be making this again.

This is a really tasty soup! The only thing I added was some salt (to taste) and rather than canned peas/corn/beans I used frozen.

This turned out so delicious! The only thing that I changed was that I added about a TBS of minced garlic and 1 Qt. of beef broth. I didn't have any peas and I used two spice mixtures that I love and use frequently- (Bragg Organic Sprinkle 24 herbs and spices seasoning and Kroger Zesty Seasoning Blend) about 2 tsp of each. Other than that, I followed the recipe that was given. We will definitely make this one again!

This was pretty good. I used ground deer meat instead of beef. If I make it again, I will only use 1 lb of meat. It is definitely more of a stew than a soup like other have said in their comments.

I really enjoyed this.  It was a great basic recipe.  I altered it some to make it my own, of course.  I rarely don't. ( I used 2 cans of rotel and fresh cherry tomatoes in place of the cans of tomato the recipe asked for, and a few more seasonings)  I also served it over rice.  It was fantastic! Thank you!

Had some neighbors over for a little Christmas get together and it was a big hit. Since I had read some of the previous comments and I like a lot of broth, I added both beef and chicken broth. I added extra thyme, two bay leaves and some garlic powder.  Turned out great.

I went a little rogue on this recipe but it is very delicious.  I added minced garlic to the beef when cooking.  Added 1/2 beer with 4 bouillon cubes when I added the onion, celery and carrots.  Added red pepper flakes, cayenne and paprika when simmering.  It is very hearty and chunky; like others have said.  But very delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this to change up my normal meatball and hamburger routine. I was so pleasantly surprised how easy, versatile and delicious this was. I used a can of kidney beans and a can of navy beans and used beef stock vs water.  All the other ingredients were the same. It was hearty and even my picky 8 year old loved it. I will definitely be making it again.

You cannot mess this one up. Follow it as written, it's delicious ;  use it as a way to clean out your vegetable draw, delicious!
Use whatever you and your family enjoy and just go for it.
My house smells amazing!  I added extra liquid to mine because my husband likes a "brothy" soup.  I like to play around with spices and have taken this soup into many different directions.  Italian with Italian spices and cannelli beans, Tex Mex with chili powder, rotel, cumin with tortilla chips, sour cream, splash of fresh lime juice, etc.  But as it is written is OH, so good!
Try it as is, then if you want to, make it your own. You just can't mess this up.

I'm assuming the absence of salt in the recipe was an oversight. You will certainly need some unless you enjoy really bland food. I suggest beef bouillon cubes dissolved in boiling water. Recipe was far too thick. 1/4 cup of water won't come close to making it like soup. I had to add about 4 cups of water as well as salt and finally some hot sauce to give it any flavor. It was still pretty thick.

I have made this multiple times, the whole family loves it.  The only substitute I do is beef stock/broth at the end.

Great base soup!
However like others have said this will be way to thick like stew. I used a slow cooker for 6 hours and added 4 cups of chicken/beef broth. I like this with cornbread!!

this is a great starter. I used fresh green beans and carrots, 1 can of Rotel tomatoes and 1 rinsed a can of diced tomatoes. Added some chicken sausage, parsley and about 2c of beef stock. lastly I added about  1/4c of red wine and approx 1tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. very hearty.

We used frozen mixed veggie packs instead of canned.
We made egg noddles instead of potatoes.
After browning and sauteing, we cooked ours in the InstantPot for 10 min.  Tasted like it had been stewing all day.

I didn't have any peas on hand, so I used green beans instead. I cut my potatoes a little larger than 1 inch, so it took longer to cook. But it was a huge hit with my husband and I, and he's not really a big soup eater. My kids are picky and they didn't like it, but they really only want junk :(
I will definitely be making this again in the future.

Added chopped jalapeno and some chili powder for a slight kick as well as some beef broth to make it more of a soup than a stew. Overall good!!

It makes a lot of soup.  I had to add a cup of V-8 in addition to 8 beef bouillon and 2 cups of water.  There was so much meat and vegetables but no broth.  Once I did that and added 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, celery seed, salt and lots of pepper it tasted delicious.  If you doctor it up it is delicious!

It was great soup; until I added the thyme.  Definitely didn't like that herb in the soup.  Will make this again; without the thyme.

I agree with many of the other opinions that this was more stew than soup and that it was a little bland.  Maybe some thyme or bay leaves next time. With salt and pepper it was pretty good.

The recipe as it stands needs a fair amount of extra liquid so I started using a thing chicken broth. We have loved it since and tastes great.

My family really enjoyed this meal. Super easy to make. The only thing I added was a can of vegetable broth to make it more soup-like. I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef (as I always do). Served with cornbread. Will be making this on a regular basis.

This was a good basic soup.  I used frozen vegetables for the peas, green beans, and corn b/c that is what I prefer.  Also, instead of just the thyme and bay leaves I used an Italian seasoning blend.  Beef broth worked good as the base instead of just water and you definitely need more than listed if you want it to truly be a soup verses stew texture.  My husband liked it and my kids didn't complain about it so I see that as a win!

This was delicious and very hardy! I omitted the corn to make it Whole 30 compliant and added cabbage, garlic, fish sauce and salt and doubled the tomato sauce and tomatoes. Also used frozen peas and green beans instead of canned.

Also added beef broth. Garlic, fresh veggies, and green chillis. Needed a kick but a good base to work with.

This soup got thumps up form the whole family, including my youngest child who doesn't like soups. It was delicious, hearty and comforting on this snowy day. I wish I didn't halve the recipe, some of us were fighting over the little bit of soup left in the pot  :-) 
I made few changes. I used fresh and frozen vegetables, omitting the green beans (didn't have any) but upping the other vegetables to make up for it. I seasoned the beef with some all spice and some paprika before adding the rest of the ingredients. Of course some chopped garlic. Also, to make this less of stew like consistency, I added a quart of beef stock ( to half the recipe). And right before serving a stirred in a handful of chopped parsley.

I liked it fine. Husband was not a huge fan. I do feel like it needs more spices so I will probably make it more "my own" next time. Good starter recipe.

Instead of potatoes I used a cup of barley, and I replaced the can vegetables  with fresh zucchini and frozen green beans.

Possibly the best soup I've ever made.  I added a cup of beef broth and no green beans, only 1 pound of organic grass fed beef and a tablespoon of Himalayan pink sea salt.  Thank you for the recipe!!!

I was looking for a soup recipe to use some leftover prime rib in and this was the perfect one!  I modified the recipe a little using the diced meat in place of the ground beef and used beef stock instead of water for additional flavor.  I prefer frozen vegetables to canned so used frozen corn and peas!  Served with cheesy bread!

This was SO easy and SO good.  I added garlic to the ground beef and onions.  I left out the celery and used canned carrots that I put in with the rest of the veggies.  I used beef broth instead of water.  I also added some Italian seasoning.  Served it with cornbread and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

Very tasty soup!  I accidentally poured the entire can of corn into the pot without draining and rinsing it first.  I think that made the soup taste a little sweet.  I tried to counteract the sweetness with more beef broth and a little salt.  I skipped the can of green beans because I ran out of room in my dutch oven.  Overall very good soup!  I'll definitely make this again.

This was delicious! I did make a few changes only because I didn't have a few things. I omitted peas, green beans, and tomato sauce. I added zucchini, beef broth, and an additional can of diced tomatoes. I served it with Parmesan cheese on top and will definitely make this again!!

I made this just how it says but instead of ground beef added albondigas (meatballs) and cooked in the crockpot. Served with buttered tortillas. Yummy! Will definitely keep this one!

This is a decent stick to your ribs kind of meal, great for a cold fall day. I agree that this fits more into the stew category than a soup (which I prefer anyway). I added a little more liquid during the final cooking process. I do think it could do with some more seasoning, it's just a tad bland. I would make it again with some minor adjustments.

Really good base to a vegetable soup. I stuck to the recipe but used frozen veggies and added 3 cups of beef broth. Also used oregano and a little cayenne pepper for a little bite! So so good! Added a dollop of cottage cheese in the middle before serving amazing soup!

I am agoraphobic and don't leave my house unless my husband takes me. I was really running low on groceries and husband was working late. I had all of the ingredients for this except carrots. I had shredded ones for my salad. I used frozen mixed vegetables that had carrots and a few minutes before serving threw in some of the shredded carrots. I had everything else on hand. This was really good! The best was my husband had a meal ready when he got home. Thank you for sharing.

Good base recipe. Made it exactly as written at first. Some changes were necessary for our family afterwards. The 1/4 cup of water had to be increased to about 4 cups & added another 4 cups of beef stock, and added an additional 2 cups of vegetable stock for flavor. As this was slightly bland for our taste I also added onion powder and garlic powder. This really is a good base recipe, it allows you to add or subtract to your liking. Will make again!

Delicious with changes. Like other reviewers said, it was a stew, not a soup, so I added 2 c. of beef broth. I used no salt tomatoes so added 1 tsp. garlic salt and a few shakes of regular salt. I also added 1/2 tsp. basil.

Made this tonight and it was fantastic. I used frozen vegetables and even added a splash of wine. I used Pomi tomatoes cause I do not serve any vegetables out of a can anymore. Pomi tomatoes come in a box and we like them very much. I did add Rosemary as well. Instead of water, I added low sodium vegetable broth.  I also added Broccoli and Cauliflower like others posted. This is such a good dish and I like that it can be frozen.

I made this but used a few short cuts. I omitted the chopped celery & used celery flakes. Added beef bouillon cubes (about 4) to water chopped onions, chunked potatoes, canned carrots, canned corn, canned green beans, canned blackeyed peas, tomato sauce & when we are in a spicy food mood, I add a can of rotel tomatoes.

This was a great opportunity to use leftover carrots, onion, celery, potatoes, and ground beef in the fridge. I skipped tomato part and peas... And added kale and parsley. Crowd-pleaser in our house!

Quick and easy. Used frozen veggies instead of canned. Needs lots more seasonings ( a little on the bland side).

Will make again.

Very good recipe. My wife, year old daughter and myself really enjoyed it. I changed nothing about the core of the recipe, but I did add these things... a couple minced garlic cloves (I put garlic in just about everything savory I cook) and some other seasonings (I can't remember which, I also like to raid my spice shelf and add  whatever sounds like it'd taste good). After cooking it for a few min, it was awfully thick, so I added a bunch more water, probably 40 oz, maybe a bit more, and a couple cups of chicken broth, then brought it back to a boil, turned down the heat and let it simmer awhile. After refrigerating, the contents soaked up a lot of the liquid and wasn't very soupy, again. Which is fine with me, I like thicker soup.

I used frozen veggies so didn't have the liquid from the can. It started out with little liquid so I added 1/2 c. of water. As it cooked it developed more liquid and looked  more like a soup. It  was more like vegetable soup without the "soup". It was good, I'd make it again with a lot  more tomatoes and perhaps broth.

Excellent!  Didn't add peas, corn or thyme (my husband claims thyme tastes like pines needles).  It was easy and cooked while working on homework.  Will make again and again, I was told about 5 times..."Great Dinner Idea"!  Enjoy!

FANTASTIC soup. I absolutely loved this, THOUGH, I added quite a bit more water and crushed tomatoes to it. But that's it. Times wise, my potatoes took longer as well, but as long as you're checking them, you're good. Every batch is different. Highly recommend. My kids loved it too (3 and 5).

I used frozen vegetables instead of canned, left out the celery as we don't like celery, left off the extra carrots, used yellow potatoes, added 4 beef bullion cubes, 1 tablespoon of seasoned salt,  2 Bay leaves,  a little more thyme, and 1 tablespoon of garlic powder.  We also used no salt added crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce and then just ground a bit directly on top of the soup.  This makes a nice thick soup and is the best I've ever made or had.

This was a meaty, hearty meal - just the way I like it.  Very easy to make.  I used beef broth as others suggested and highly recommend doing so.  Don't be afraid to add more liquid.  The leftovers didn't have much liquid since there was so much meat in this but very good recipe!

I didn't have all of the seasonings so I used a couple of beef bouillons and celery seed instead of celery stalks. Tastes great!

I made this recipe yesterday and my boyfriend loved it, and me too! I didn't add corn and instead of tomato sauce and diced tomatoes I added Bartolli tomato & basil sause(that was the olny tomatoes I had at home) and still turned out very good! Easy, fast and very tasty!

The original recipe was too thick for my taste.   But the overall taste was fantastic.   I added a carton of chicken broth, because I didn't have beef broth on hand, and about a cup of ketchup.   I like the bit of sweetness brought in my the ketchup.   All that extra liquid I added got mopped up by grilled cheese sandwiches.  Which I think are the perfect compliment to this cold weather soup.

It's good and healthy. I needed to add more salt because it lacked flavor. It's not amazing but good:)

This was delicious. Like other reviewers said, it came out to be like a stew so I added 2 cups of chicken broth, seasoned it to taste wit salt and pepper, and added about a table spoon of brown sugar to cut the tartness of the tomatoes.. Excellent!

I used mini carrots and could have diced them more; a little tough. I also added Mezzi Rigatoni and topped with Parmesean.

I tweaked a little. I added a full 32oz of beef broth in substitution for water and drained all of the canned veggies. I added another 1/4tsp of thyme and added 1 1/2 tsp of salt. Also I used the Hunt's Dinner Starters Beef Stew tomato sauce and three cans of diced potatoes instead. This way tastes wonderful!

Delicious! A very flexible recipe. I will make again. I added 1/2 head of sliced fresh cabbage and 6 cups of beef broth. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes. I omitted potatoes, corn, and peas. Works fine with frozen green beans vs. canned.
