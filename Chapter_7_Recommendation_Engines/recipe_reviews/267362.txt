I, too, ground my oats first (makes for a smoother shake). I used freshly brewed espresso, which gave it a nice mocha flavor. Because my espresso was still a bit warm, I added a few additional ice cubes to my glass before pouring this over. I topped it with a some semi-sweet chocolate shavings! Mmmm!

A really refreshing and healthy drink. Not super sweet but sweet enough to enjoy the mocha flavor.

Very good taste! I do wish now that I would have ground up the oats but it still turned out great. Will make again and again!

This was easy and really good! Next time I’ll grind my oats first but even though I didn’t this time, I still liked it. Make sure you use a really strong coffee (or espresso as someone else suggested - yum!) for the best flavor. Really easy breakfast to throw together before you head out the door!

The flavor was pretty good. I did not grind my oats into a powder first, I should have. I've never put oats into a smoothie or shake before. So we didn't love the texture. But the flavor was good.

Yes please. This is one of my favorites!  I too,ground the oats beforehand?.  The flavors go so well together, I mean who DOESN'T like mocha???  I happen to LOVE almond mochas so I added a little sugar free almond syrup to mine.  It's pretty awesome!

Like Lutzflcat, I always grind my oats first too, so I did with this recipe as well. I use very strong coffee, so the flavor came through very well for me. The amount of coffee vs chocolate flavor was perfect. I really enjoyed this shake!

9.1.18  As I always do with smoothies or shakes that include oats, I first ground the oats to a powder in the blender (personal taste preference) before adding the other ingredients.  We like our coffee pretty strong, I set aside 1/2 cup this morning, and put into the fridge.  Unfortunately, it was not strong enough because I could not taste any coffee in this shake, so do make sure it’s “super strong.”  After blending, it was pretty thin (could be my fridge ice maker cubes are smaller), so I added additional ice to get more of the shake consistency that I like.  This was really quick and easy, and I garnished with just a smidgen of grated chocolate.  I enjoyed this shake, but I still was longing for a bit more of a mocha flavor.
