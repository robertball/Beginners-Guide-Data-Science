I made this for dinner for my husband and my parents, and they all absolutely loved it.......every plate was licked clean!  I read all the reviews beforehand and it seemed the only complaint some had was that the fish itself was bland.  What I did was marinade the steaks in 8 oz. of Italian Dressing for a few hours.  That really made a difference, it kept the fish moist and flavorful and complimented the toppings nicely!  Also if you are able, try to use every ingredient in its freshest form - it really helps the taste!  I used garlic and herb feta instead of plain and that was great.  The last thing I did based on some reviews was loosely cover the dish with foil for the first 8 min., then I uncovered and baked another 8 min.  I could really tell how the foil helps the feta not brown too quickly and keeps the tomatoes from turning mushy.  Besides its spectacular taste, this dish is a beautiful presentation, perfect for company!  I will use again and again!
P.S. If you can't get fresh halibut, Trader Joe's sells it for $9.99 lb.  Its flash frozen, so it's the next best thing to fresh - you really can't taste the difference!

This is an amazing recipe.  I used more a bit more vegetables than called for and added crushed red pepper and lemon juice and it was just sumptuous!  Will definately serve this to guests.  Thanks, Dakota!

Absolutely incredible!!  Being from Washington state my husband is a serious critic when it comes to fish, especially halibut and salmon.  He said this is the best he's ever had and that's saying a lot considering his brother-in-law is an Alaskan halibut fisherman and his sister cooks some amazing dishes with halibut.  I did marinate in Italian dressing for an hour, used the diced tomatoes with basil and oregano as previously suggested.  Used fillet instead of steaks, so it took a little longer to bake.  While the fish was baking I sauteed mushrooms and garlic in olive oil and added those to the dish before presenting to the table.  Yummm, will make again and again!  I can't wait to make this for my sister-in-law!!  :) Thank you for this wonderful dish!

I just eyeballed the ingredients and seasoned the fish with a a lemon pepper seasoning. This is a simple, light and fresh tasting dish that can be eaten totally guilt free! Hubs can't tolerate feta cheese, so unfortunately I had to leave that out, but I'm sure that would have been a delicious addition.  I baked this as directed, uncovered, for 15 minutes and it was perfectly done. Beautiful on the plate, and a very satisfying meal that doesn't sit in your stomach like a brick.

We love this recipe. We make it for ourselves and for company. The colors are gorgeous (white feta, red tomatoes, green basil) and it looks delicious right out of the oven with the feta slightly browned... mmm! We take a nice big piece of fish and throw everything on there (i.e. a whole zucchini, etc) and it's like having a big salad on top of your piece of fish. We don't serve it with any sides because the topping is enough. Just a glass of white wine and you're set! 

One recommendation -- In order for the fish not to dry out, it's best to use an evenly thick piece of fish. We've made this recipe about 8 times and it always turns out juiciest when the piece has an even thickness. 

Great recipe for beginner cooks! Really impressive! : )

Now this is the kind of recipe that I like.   You, in essence, create a main course and side dish simultaneously.  Hence I give it high marks for ease of preperation plus it tastes great.  I tried this recipe because it was rated 5 stars and I concur.

This recipe took me by surprise.... The topping was a perfect mix of flavors that complemented the halibut beautifully.  Easy preparation, flavorful, healthy with a pleasing presentation; what more could a recipe possibly offer?  Served with a side of Parmesan and Basil Orzo from this site for a light meal.  Thank you Dakota Kelly for the submission.

Perfect!  This meal was extremely easy to cook and at half of the recommended serving I cooked for 15 minutes and the fish turned out moist and cooked to perfection.  The colors of the ingredients added to a nice presentation.  Definitely a dish to make during any night of the week.

This was so good!  It had a lot more flavor than I thought it would.  I thought the feta might be a little strange with the fish, but the saltiness perfectly complements the fresh vegetables.  I loved it.

This recipe was delicious.  My mom made it and my family loved it.  The feta cheese gives it the perfect touch.  All the vegetables were delicious.  I would suggest roma tomatoes.  It was quick and easy too!

I added mushrooms to my vegetable mixture, and seasoned my halibut with a bit of dill weed.  It was hard to stop eating...very yummy!  Everything was perfect!

This was wonderful!  I gave this a 4 because I do feel marinating the halibut is imperative for full flavor.  I marinated in Zesty Italian dressing for about 1 1/2 hours but could have used a bit more time in the marinade, plus I should have lightly salted the halibut before topping with the vegetables, as hubby said it was fantastic but a little salt directly on the fish would have brought out the flavor more.  Per reading reviews I used a can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic.  Also added 1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms, used one zucchini and one summer squash, added 1 tablespoon of butter with the olive oil---it's a Southern thing--and to add even more calories--I used 1/3 cup of Tomato/Basil Feta and 1/3 cup of Garlic/Herb Feta.  I used a 1 1/2 lb. halibut filet, cooking time was about 17 minutes and did not cover, Feta was perfect.  I served over a bed of rice cooked in 'Better Than Bouillon' vegetable flavor.  When I make this again I am going to lightly drizzle with fresh lemon.

I'm a rookie when it comes to fish.  I looked this up when my wife asked me to cook halibut for her birthday. This recipe is awesome!! It was a homerun out of the ballpark.  The hardest part was the 2 cups of diced tomatoes but only 'cause I'd never diced tomatoes before.  I sprinkled some italian herb seasoning on the fish before I spread the tomato/zuchini mixture.  I'll be fixing this again.

Delicious. Thanks for the recipe. I did end up using orange roughy because halibut was unavaliable. And I added mushrooms and a little lemon. The acidity of the tomatoes was wonderful. This is an easy recipe for anytime and would be great for a dinner party because it looks gormet.

Excellent! So FRESH! The only thing I did different was to season the fish with a bit of salt, pepper, and garlic powder before adding the veggies.

SO GOOD! I read a lot of the reviews and did the following: marinated my halibut in italian dressing for about an hour, used diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic drained instead of fresh tomatoes, and added a little more fresh basil than called for.  Such a great simple tasty recipe.

This was very good.  Unfortunately I used frozen halibut steaks and they weren't the freshest tasting, but the flavors of the veggies and feta really helped a lot.  I also added crushed red pepper for some heat.  I will make this again, but next time I'll be sure to use fresh fish.

This was by far the best Halibut I have ever eaten. It was a hit with my husband and it would be great for guests. It's easy to make and looks like it took a lot of work! :-) Thanks Dakota!

this recipe is wonderful, but i didn't think the feta went so well with the fish, so i plan on leaving it off next time. it might be a product of how i was raised - my grandmother always told me cheese doesn't belong with fish!

The vegetables on this were outstanding but even with seasoning, the fish had very little flavor. I will make this again but will marinate the fish as others suggested in Italian dressing.

Loved this! My grocery store did not have fresh halibut steaks so I made it with Tilapia but it was still so yummy. Full of flavor, I would even make the topping as a side dish.

This was a very tasty dish.  I prepared it as instructed with the exception that I marinated the fish in Champagne dressing.  I did not have any Italian and didn't want to make any.  Hubby and kids liked it!  I served it with angel hair pasta, and salad.

Very good, colorful and easy - I used Tilapia rather than Halibut and substituted red peppers for tomatoes and added some pine nuts and chopped green olives (got the idea for those from a similar recipe on here).  I also put a splash of balsamic vinagarette dressing on top of the fish (under the veggies) to give it some extra tang.  Really good, easy and healthy.

Fantastic! I used extra garlic, a little more zucchini and an herb flavored feta, and I added a few sliced mushrooms that I had to use up.  I was planning on making pasta to go with this, but I ended up just sauteeing some spinach with a little shallot and garlic and served the halibut on top.  Excellent!

I got a lot of compliments on this dish.  Such as:  "this is better than restaraunt quality."  I thought that was funny, but it tickled my ego.  I did not alter the recipe.  I served this with basmati white rice (with basil garnishment which also gave an additional basil aroma) and pesto garlic bread.  It also gave an absoultly beautiful presentation.  Perfect for an intimate celebration. Playing with the presentation was fun.  I would defiantly make this again.  ~Michele Page~

I feel the need to start this with "I don't EVER eat fish" but this was very good!  I felt that the fish steak itself could use more flavor and so the next time I think we'll try a complimentary marinade of some sort, and I don't know if my husband put enough feta on, but all in all this was a wonderful dinner.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I did think the fish needed to be seasoned a bit - the veggies/feta were delcious.  I think maybe next time I will add some white wine and tomato paste to the veggies and also will season the fish with salt, pepper, garlic powder, etc.. prior to spreading the veggies on top.  Overall very good!

Great recipe! Taking the advice in some other reviews, I marinated the halibut in italian dressing for a few hours. The end result was definately not bland. The topping is a great mix of flavors, I added in a little more garlic for my personal preference. It took almost 30 minutes for 2 good sized steaks. I covered the baking dish in foil for the first 15 minutes, and I don't think the feta was melted like it should, in fact, only some of it was browned. Next time I'll try pulling off the foil around 8 minutes to see how it goes. I prepared this meal for a woman I was trying to impress, and she loved it. The many colors of the topping makes for a great presentation... It was almost a shame to eat such a masterpiece. :)

AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS - thank you for sharing this recipe!!  I used black grouper fillets because that's what I had, more garlic than called for because I always do, canned diced tomatoes with basis & oregano, dried basil 'cause I couldn't get fresh, and tomato-basil feta.  I had to cook longer than stated because my fillets were HUGE, so the feta got kind of browned.  17 year old daughter kept raving about it, husband thought is was restaurant quality, and I just loved it!  Can't wait to try it with fresh (real, summer garden) tomatoes and fresh basil.

This was very good. I did marinate it in Italian dressing while I prepared all the ingredients to be cooked.  I added extra garlic,veg., cheese to our own tastes and some of my home grown cherry tomatoes sliced in half to the regular diced tomatoes didn't have fresh basil handy so I used dried and it was good..I love fresh basil and next time I will definately have some and even add a little fresh sprig for garnish. I covered with foil after the feta was browned enough and cooked for recommended time. Served it with a herbed creamy pasta and fresh white corn... my husband had two helpings  I will make this again...easy and tasty and looks pretty.

The veggies were definitely a flavor enhancer.  Call me a traditionalist, but I thought that the feta was a little bit of a strong flavor for the subtleness of the halibut.  I would consider substituting for parmesan, which seems like a slightly more balanced accompaniment than the feta to me.

Great recipe.  We had a turnip that we threw in with the sautéed vegetables called for.  We also used twice as much of the vegetable mixture as was called for.  Have saved this to our family favorites file in the recipe box and will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe except I didn't use fresh basil and I actually used tilapia instead of halibut after seeing how much halibut costs! It turned out wonderful even still and I will be making this again!

This is a fantastic recipe! The veggies are perfect with the fish to make a complete meal. Variation: I sauteed zucchini, onion, 1/2 portobello mushroom and 1/4 red pepper (all chopped) with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning. I put fish in a dish and drizzled a little olive oil and garlic powder on top and then rubbed this mixture into the fish. I topped with veggies. I didn't have feta in the fridge, so I topped with some shredded medium sharp cheddar and a little brie. YUM

This was great! I only had cucumber, so I used that instead of zucchini, I don't think it made a big difference. The feta cheese burned a little on top, but that's my fault for not covering it better.   On a side note, I made this recipe a second time but with tilapia, since I didn't have halibut, and it definitely was not as good. Since I'm a cooking amateur, I didn't think about it. Halibut has a much more meaty taste that matches the vegetables.

This was a good recipe.  I used cod instead of Halibut because I am on a poor man's budget!  It was very good but I did have to adjust the temperature to 375 and cooked it about 30 minutes.  I used the Italian Diced Tomatoes as other people have recommended. I used minced garlic and minced onion and the flavors were great.  I think the Feta gave it the best flavor so don't skip this ingredient!  My 5 year old did not like this though but my husband and I did.

I used large halibut steaks for this-big mistake. Took much longer to cook. However, the fish turned out beautifully-vegetables were well cooked, deboning process was quick and easy. Halibut is expensive, and so should be prepared with much pomp and show. This recipe certainly does all that. Very easy to prepare, and exceptionally delicious.

This was a waste of good (expensive)halibut. The tomatoes were overpowering and the fish was tasteless. I did as others suggested and marinated in italian dressing - the fish was very moist, but bland. I got advice from a great chef a while ago that said you have to let fish speak for itself and not over-dress it. This is a great example of over-dressing.

Absolutely delicious!  This has so much flavor!  I increased the zuchhini to 2 cups to balance the tomatoes.  Just wonderful!

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I only made a few changes which I thought were necessary for the type of fish that I was using.  I did not have halibut but used tilapia (white flaky fish).  I sauteed the onions first in olive oil and butter in a 14" everyday pan. (If you don't add butter to the oil the onions might burn).  Once translucent, I added about 1 1/2 cups of chopped mushrooms and then added the chopped tomatoes.  To give it more flavor, I added 1/2 cup of white wine and 1 tsp. chicken base.  Finally, I added the fish and spooned the mixture over the top and baked for 15 min. at 350 degrees.  To top it off I added the feta cheese and returned it to the oven for 5 min.  As a garnish I added parsley.  Note:  The pan I used is able to withstand temps over 400 degrees.  Also I kept the zucchini as a side.  It turned out exquisite after all of the additions that I made and I will continue to make it again.  Thanks for posting!

This is my now my favorite method of preparing halibut.  After the first bite, my husband declared that it has to go into our permanent rotation of recipes.  The beautiful results of this dish belie how easy it is to prepare.

I used red onion, and I am happy I did.  The soft pinkish-red hue of the carmelized onion contrasted nicely with the white fish.  I also left out the zucchini (because I forgot to buy some), and I don't think the dish suffered at all.

I've served this halibut with leftover gazpacho and with a Greek salad.  Anything with a Mediteranean flare would pair nicely.

A great recipe made much better by reading the feedbacks. I took care to season the halibut before applying the topping. I added crushed red pepper flakes to the topping and substituted dry tarragon for the fresh basil with some in the topping and some on the halibut. Finally, I cooked it about 10 minutes longer and my wife and I dined with gusto!

This dish was so easy and delicious.  I added a bit more crushed garlic and more zucchini for extra vegetables.  Came out perfect and juicy!  Highly recommend!

Let me say first I don't like fish very much but I am trying to loose a few pounds so I need to eat "lighter"... and this was so good I could eat it every night...that good! I used some Italian seasonings instead of the basil -the only change I made.

This was wonderful!  Unfortunately halibut was extremely expensive so we used salmon instead.  I'm sure the halibut would have made it even better!  My kids all loved the dish and couldn't get enough.  
A couple recommendations.  I punctured the salmon fillets with a fork multiple times so that the juices could run into them.  Also, I will add a couple more cloves of garlic next time as well as double the feta cheese.  Fresh basil is a must in this recipe (I may increase the amount of basil as well next time)!!
I can't wait to make this again!  Hopefully Halibut will be more affordable so I can use it with this amazing dish!

I've been trying to find decent fish recipes to try and get more fish in our diet and this recipe is just what I was looking for.  I used cod (because it was what I had available) but will try it with halibut next time.  After reading the suggestions of other reviewers I added hot pepper flakes to spice things up and covered with foil for the first 8 minutes of baking.  I drizzled the juice of half a lemon after removing the foil and finished baking it.  The feta browned perfectly and the vegetables were tender but not mushy. My boyfriend loved it! Thanks so much for such an easy and delicious recipe.

I've made this many many times because it's healthy and simple. You can use just about any type of white fish besides halibut such as sea bass, tilapia and cod.  It tastes delicious with all of them.  I always use more veggies than suggested, such as adding mushrooms and doubling up on the rest so I have to add more salt and pepper, about 1.5 tbs for 2 servings and I add rep pepper flakes because I like spice.  If you plan on using this dish as a whole meal, then I would suggest doubling up on the veggies, salt and pepper.  I can see why people would think it's bland because it's lacking enough seasoning for my taste, which is why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars.

Very easy and tasty recipe!  I didn't have halibut but used it for tilapia and it worked out well.  It was a great single course meal.  I prepared the fish with chili flakes and lemon juice and this added nicely to the flavors.  Will make this again!

This was excellent. The only changes I made were to marinate the halibut in a little bit of light italian dressing for about 20-30 minutes, and added one more small clove of garlic to the veggie topping. The vegetables, basil, and feta played wonderfully with the halibut.

This is a delightful way to prepare halibut.  I used suggestions from others - marinated in Italian dressing for a few hours and used the crumbled garlic & herb feta.  Also, used less zucchini than called for but added one small chopped yellow pepper.  We enjoyed the lovely fresh taste and colourful presentation.  Will make this again.

I've never reviewed before, but I absolutely had to review this fabulous dish! I was stunned something this good could come out of my own kitchen. It was amazing, restaurant quality for sure, and yet so simple to make! It smelled heavenly and made a lovely presentation, taste was out of this world. I've never been more grateful for the basil plant growing in the window. Out of personal preference, I added some mushrooms and a small amount of asparagus, and I marinated the fish beforehand in a quick mix of lemon, oil, vinegar, and Italian spices. Also sprinkled some fresh grated parmesan  along with the feta. Served it with a side of broccoli, I think some angel hair pasta would have been nice, too. This will definitely be my go-to recipe if I feel the need to impress!

Very Good - had to use flounder as Halibut was not available - added extra garlic & basil - but best enhancer was to sprinkle the fish with Italian Seasoning - really made it great. Will definitely try again when Halibut is available

This is a good recipe full of veggies. I also doubled up on the veggies, Added a small amount of spinach for color because I had to use dried basl, not fresh, I also switched the onion to green onion and added mushrooms. It makes for a really pretty plate.

MMMMM, good!  My only complaint is that I didn't have enough fresh basil...the tiny bit I had was great, but using the correct amount would have been much better!  Regardless, nice and light and flavourful, great dish for halibut.

I agree with everyone that this was great.  I followed the recommendation of marinading the Halibut in Italian dressing...didn't have any and used Caesar dressing!  Excellent.  Then I did use the zucchini and followed the recipe, but when I added the tomatoes and fresh basil, I also added some greek olives.  My husband said it was "restaurant" quality!

what a perfectly decadent meal! Served this for a very picky eater as a birthday meal. did marinate the Halibut in italian dressing first, as well as seasoned with sea salt and pepper before adding topping.  It turned out Wonderful! Everyone ate it up! This was a beautiful dish with a light spring flavor. LOVED IT! Served with Basmati rice that i cooked in chicken broth with one bay leaf and a sprig of rosemary, 1 tsp salt. Cook like normal, but take out the bay leaf and rosemary before serving.

My husband and I both thought this was great.  Our store was out of halibut so I bought orange roughy because it was the thickest white fish I could find. Served with steamed broccoli seasoned with garlic and parmesan.  Fish was moist and delicious.  Will make this often!  Thanks!

I let the halibut sit in italian dressing like one of the reviewers suggested. It was an excellent idea. I didn't use steaks though, I used a fillet, baked it at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. The vegetable topping with feta was AWESOME. I will definitely be making this halibut recipe again!

I followed the recipe as is and thought it was very bland.  Used some Peri-Peri sauce on the side and was able to finish it.  If you do try this recipe, then take the advice of others and coat the halibut with Italian dressing before baking.

I took it out of the oven before leaving to work, I came home and it was all gone.  My son and husband at it all.   They loved it.  I was really surprised since we are not big fish eaters.  They keep asking me to make it again.

My boyfriend just made this for me tonight - so easy to pull together especially for the delicious pay off!  We had it with toasted pita and roasted red pepper hummus... yum...  He claims it was the best meal he's ever had.  I would definitely recommend!

This was an amazing fish recipe! I used all fresh (and mostly organic) vegetables, except for the chopped garlic from the jar, and it tasted so fresh and healthy. I doubled the veggies, and added yellow squash. I also used the garlic and herb feta cheese and doubled that as well. I will make again for sure. My boyfriend's kids, 12yr old and 15yr old both went back for seconds!

I used fresh striped bass because that is what we caught.  Added a few chopped kalamata olives on top with the feta.  Also seasoned the fish with Old Bay Seasoning before adding topping mix. Best fish I have ever eaten.

Excellent.  I used tilapia instead of halibut because it's not as expensive.  I also used the canned tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano.  I put a little salt on the fish before the topping and some lemon too.  It was so good.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe. To avoid sogginess and still get a heaping serving of that wonderful vegetable medley, I simply spread the veggies out over the pan as well as on top of the fish. The juices are excellent over rice.

I made this with filet rather than steaks and it came out FABULOUS!  I did add more garlic than called for, but the fresh zinginess of the vegetables and feta is a perfect compliment to the halibut.

This was really incredible. We used halibut filets instead of steaks (no bones) and it turned out great. I had to cook it a little longer since they were so thick but the end result was fantastic.

Yummy!! This was soooo good! All the flavors blended perfectly. It was so easy and quick to make. I used a tomato/basil feta, which added to the flavor.

Awesome! Our favorite brand of feta has a new added flvr with lemon, garlic and oregano.  Used this with excellent results. I used basil sold in a tube located in our bagged salad dept. Sparingly buttered the pan, 2 dabs of butter on my halibut filet, lemon pepper and other seasonings.  Will make many times over.  Thanks!

i would have never thought fish and feta cheese would compliment each other so nicely. i did make some minor subsitutions to accommodate what i had on hand. i used lots of spinach(instead of basil) and omitted the zucchini. i added a dash of red pepper flakes and some garlic powder to the mix. i loosely covered with foil until the last 10 minutes. this kept the feta from burning too much and the tomatoes from turning to mush... i will definately make this again

The dish was too watery from the tomatoes. At 450 degrees, the feta burns a little. The halibut should also be seasoned before baking with some sort of seasoning (I haven't figured it out yet!) AND with lemon juice and butter. The steak did come out a little bland. Eggplant would have been a nice addition to the zuccini.

I really enjoyed it, but the disappointment on my husband's face when he realized I'd cooked the fish with vegetables instead of deep frying it was hilarious.After a bit of prodding, he tried it and liked it.

I had a 2lb Halibut Steak and this recipe worked out beautifully.  I added a little fresh lemon to the mix while omitting the onions. I also sautéed the tomatoes and basil for a few minutes before pouring everything on top of the fish.  Prior to putting everything in the oven, I used Roquefort instead of feta.  I cooked the fish for 18 minutes and it was absolutely delicious.  Would definitely make this again.

This was the first time I've ever made halibut and I'm so darned excited at how good it was!  After reading the reviews I chose to marinate the halibut in Italian dressing for about 40 minutes, because that's all the time I had.  I used a can of diced Italian tomatoes (drained) with basil, oregano and garlic instead of fresh tomatoes.  Other than that I followed the original recipe.  I did use the entire zucchini also, which is good because the vegetables taste so good and fresh that you'll want extra!  New to cooking fish, I was worried fifteen minutes want enough.  Plus I had covered it in tons of veggies, so really worried.  In the end I cooked it uncovered for seventeen minutes because my fish was on the thicker side.  This was perfect.  I definitely wouldn't cook longer!  Thanks to the author for sharing your wonderful recipe and to everyone who reviewed and offered tips!

I loved this recipe! Of course some minor changes. For one double veggie topping (at least), and I added it on top of the cooked halibut. I also added white wine and seasoned the halibut with garlic salt, oregano, salt, pepper, lemon whilst baking. It was amazing. Will do this again but make a lot more of this delicious side dish.

Delicious! Made this with cod fish marinated in Italian dressing 30 prior to baking. I was Leary about feta cheese on fish but it makes the dish don't skip it. Veggies were excellent on top I will make more next time

Really delicious.  Didn't think I would like it but made it anyway because I had the ingredients.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.  Made extra zucchini mixture and served on side.  Didn't change anything except added italian dressing directly to the fish before topping with zucchini mixture.  Perfection!

tasted good. I used frozen fish because I had no fresh on hand. Next time I will be using fresh. My frozen even thawed and drained had to much water in the pan.

Used a squash mixture with a can of diced tomatoes. 
I cooked mine for about 45 minutes (a little over cooked.) but still had a good flavor.

After reading comments I made some changes. 1st, I cooked it 8 min covered, 7 min uncovered. 2nd, I added half a lemon's juice to the veggie mixture before placing it on top of the fish. 3rd, I let it marinade in balsamic vinaigrette while I was at work. 4th, We arent feta cheese fans so for a creamy-ish taste, I used a dollop of greek yogurt after it was done cooking. Very good, will make again.

I used Basil olive oil in the baking pan and gave each piece (6) a swirl to coat lightly.  Then I sprinkled them liberally on both sides with Old Bay and black pepper; tomatoes and basil fresh from my garden, 50/50 zucchini and yellow squash fresh from farmers market.  Topped with shredded mozzarella vs. feta.  Served over whole wheat angel hair pasta and a sprinkle of Romano cheese...20 minutes at 450 and flaky and moist.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND for a fast, easy and delish MEATLESS dinner!

Loved it!  Fragrant and delicious.  I did not have any zucchini on hand so used broccoli florets.  And also had no feta so used seasoned Boursin cheese.  The kitchen smelled wonderful and the end result was absolutely delicious!

Perfectly delicious as is! I followed the recipe precisely and it was to DIE for. I recommend using ripe grape tomatoes simply cut in half. Yum!

We really liked this recipe.  The veggies added nice color and flavor to the fish.  As a matter of fact, this combo of veggies would be good on its own!  This very healthy and tasty recipe deserves a repeat, and for 6 points+, it will definitely show up on my menu again.  Thanks for the idea!

This was a delicious, simple recipe.  I didn't have zucchini, but used everything else.  The ingredients complemented the delicate taste of the halibut.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was a great recipe, and I would give it 5 stars with these changes:  first, use flavored olive oil (e.g., basil, chili or garlic flavored).  To solve the problem of it being dry and a bit bland that others commented on, use 1/2 cup of fire-roasted salsa and add to the saucepan with the zukes, and also add in a small handful of sun-dried tomatoes. I used cherry tomatoes and added them whole to the saucepan for a few minutes with the zuke for a few minutes til they were a bit blistered.  I used a mix of yellow and red tomatoes and the presentation was spectacular.  Cover it in the oven for half the time like another reviewer mentioned.

Very tasty and low in calories and fat especially without the feta. The veggies also paired well with other proteins (besides halibut).

This was really good! I used Tilapia to cut down on the cost of using Halibut. I also used fire roasted tomatoes which was suggested by other reviewers. The fire roasted tomatoes added more flavor. I also added squash in addition to the zucchini. I served the dish over Basmati rice which worked well with this dish. The Feta cheese definitely adds a surprising twist to this recipe. This is definitely a keeper

This dish is delicious. I am not a big fish eater usually but decided to give this a try. I am glad I did. I did make the following changes, I marinated the fish in some italian dressing for about an hour before baking, I used spinach instead of zucchini as I dont care for that particular veggie. increaed the garlic as I usually do and covered for the first 1/2 of bake time. This is definately a dish I will be making again.

Great recipe, my boyfriend thought it was one of the best things I ever made and he is hard to please! I modified this recipes by adding some pesto to the veggies when cooking them and cut up and added some marinated artichoke hearts when topping the fish before baking. I also used only fire roasted tomatos out of can instead of fresh. The flavors worked out wonderfully! I will make this again--so easy and so tasty!

Love this recipe, have cooked it several times. The first time I stuck to the original recipe and it was very good. The second time I added extra garlic and basil and it was even better. I like to use different veggies...asparagus and butternut squash are favorites.

Yum!!!!  I live in Alaska, so halibut is a staple in our diet.  I am always looking for new ways to cook it and this was amazing!  I did add mushrooms, but that was my only adjustment.  I was a little skeptical abut the feta, but is was fantastic.  Will definitely cook again!

Great moist fish.  I only had 1 roma tomato so I added 1/2 a can of crush tomatoes along with chopped parsley, spinach and mushrooms.  I poured all the sauteed veggies over the fish to cover, then sprinkled on the feta. I covered with foil for 10 minutes and cooked without foil for 10 minutes.  (I had large pieces of fish)

It was delicious and fresh.  Next time I will add more fresh basil and maybe a bit of oregano.

I am giving it 5 stars, even tho I didn't use halibut. I didn't have any, so I used tilapia filets. The flavors were wonderful and I plan on using this with halibut soon. A keeper for fish.

I've only cooked fish a handful of time, but this is probably the best I've ever made!  I too enjoy how the veggies are like a side dish as well and the Feta was perfect with it!  I followed others' tips and marinaded the fish (I used Tilapia) in Italian dressing and covered the baking dish loosely with foil for about half of the cooking time.  I made some rice pilaf on the side--excellent!

This was a great dish.  I have been trying forever to get my inlaws to eat healthier but they are really scared healthy will not taste very good.  But guess what they LOVED this.  For me the fish needed some seasoning, but the veggies....mmm....they were good.  So maybe if you put seasoning on the fish before you bake it, it might give it a little more jazz.

My first recipe with halibut and it was absolutely fabulous!  I'm not a huge fan of tomatoes normally but thought I'd give it a shot and I'm so glad I did.  I couldn't find steaks so I used 2 fillets (same amount of veggies) and marinated them in Italian dressing for an hour. Baked for 20 minutes with foil on for the first half and it turned out beautifully. Thank you for the great recipe!

This is my first rating ever, but I could not resist because this is THE best fish recipe I have ever made. The only changes I made were halibut filets (1/2 lb each) instead of steaks and dried basil instead of fresh  because that is all I had.  I cooked the fish for more like 12 or 13 minutes since they were not thick steaks and this turned out perfect.  This will become a regular halibut recipe.  I cannot wait to serve this at our next dinner party.  It will be a hit!

Amazing and healthy!  This will be my go to halibut recipe for the winter when it's too cold to grill.  We loved it and it is so good for you.  The feta cheese adds a nice kick to the recipe, but the veggies are also amazing.

Fantastic flavours!  This was the first fish meal I have made and it went fairly well!  My alterations were that I used 500g of halibut fillets rather than steaks, of which I marinaded in a zip lock bag for a few hours in zesty italian dressing, flipping bag around occasionally.  I omitted the onion as I don't like to eat it, used a can of diced herbed tomatoes, dried basil (as didn't have fresh) and herbed feta.  I covered the baking dish with foil for the first 8 minutes, however it took a lot longer for the fillets to cook than the recipe states.  I ended up leaving them in the oven for a total of 35 mins or so, as I was so worried the fish wouldn't be cooked enough!  It ended up fine, maybe perhaps still a little too mushy?  Maybe it had something to do with all the juice that came out of the canned tomatoes in the bottom of the baking dish??  Otherwise, a success!  :)

Very fast and easy to make, and came out great.  I didn't have feta, so used Parmesan.  Probably a mistake, but wasn't bad.  Surprised lemon wasn't necessary, but it really wasn't.  Had a tough time pairing with wine due to fish/tomato/cheese combination.  Went with an overly oaky chardonnay which didn't work too well.  Really good with fresh baguette and butter.  Great recipe!

This was an easy and very delicious meal.  I'm not a big fan of zucchuni so I used asparagus instead.  It was yummy.  I also used frozen fish filets which you can typically go straight from freezer to over, but would let them defrost completely for this dish because the topping ends up overcooking. Still a great recipe.

INCREDIBLE. I only made this with 2 steaks (used Trader Joes frozen- not bad!) and made the same amt. of topping for the 4. What a beautiful presentation. I'm making them for my in-laws tonight, easy and very impressive looking dish. Thanks! (OH also marinate them in Italian dressing...that helped with the lack of flavor some reviewers complained of).

This is sooo awesome!!!  I accidentally used albacore steaks..oops...  but it really didn't matter it was awesome!  I did add a little more olive oil to create a little more sauce and I would recommend using more than 1 cup of zucchini and when you are sautéing the zucchini with the oil, garlic and onion..its really good if you can sauté them until they are almost brown.  I will make this again!!

Loved this and so did my husband. Substituted with diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano. Used yellow squash and blue cheese as that's what I had on hand. As per previous reviewers, salting and peppering the fish would add more flavor. This was fast, flavorful, and low-calorie. Thanks.

Very good!  You need to use halibut to get the right texture, as tilapia will turn to mush.  I doubled up the veggies and added fresh oregano, which was perfect, as this is really more of a Greek dish than an Italian dish.  Light  and perfect for summer when the zucchini, tomatoes and herbs are abundant in the garden.

This was delicious! My changes were only to add a few more veggies & cheese, and a little sprinkle of seasoning on the fish, I also covered it during baking. So good and such a nice presentation. I coupled this with a Cashew Rice Pilaf from Tina Coburn, (minus the raisins for me). Nice combination and really colorful. Enjoy! We did.

I followed the suggestion to bake for half the time w/tin foil cover and then remove the foil. Kept the feta looking good. Overall, the fish looked beautiful -- the presentation aspect was tops. And the taste was yummy, too. (I left out the olives bc I hate them and no one missed them.)

This recipe is so quick and easy.  I followed the advice of another user and used more zucchini than called for.  I can't wait to cook it again and I suggest serving along side of garlic whipped potatoes! AWESOME!!!

Wonderful dish!  For convenience, I used one can of canned diced tomatoes and one can of mild Rotel tomatoes.  It gave it a lot of zing, and the whole family raved about it. Will definitely fix again!

Great recipe! It's a shame halibut is so darned expensive - we paid $21 a pound! But it was worth it - this dish is light and tasty. Served it with rice one night and served the leftovers with angel hair. Both were outstanding!

The reviews in my home were mixed about this one.  I loved it because it was so healthy, but my husband reminded me that he does not care for things wtih tomatoes....whatever.  I loved it.  I am in Florida so fresh halibut is hard to come by so I used hog fish and it was yummy!!  I will make this again but try some different veggie combinations.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

This was great. I made this with Tilapia fish instead (because I couldn't find halibut) and it worked out just the same. Very tender and juicy. I love garlic so I tend to season more with garlic salt too.

This receipe was wonderful.  Rather than the Zuc. I used colorful, red, yellow, and orange peppers.  I cooked it for 8 people and it was a hit by all.  Important: Salt and pepper the fish before you put the veggies on top.  I put the salt and pepper on the bottom before I put the fish in too.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I used tilapia instead of halibut, since that was on sale when I made this recipe.  That may have made the difference between 4 and 5 stars...tilapia is a  very mild fish, and I didn't salt it, so I thought the fish neede some salt when the I tasted the finished dish.

I also made other substitutions, as I decided to use what I had on hand. Instead of the zucchini, I used frozen cauliflower. Instead of fresh basil, I used dried Italian seasoning, and reduced-fat feta cheese.  Overall, I thought the substituions worked well, but of course using fresh veggies and seasonings would probably make this dish outstanding :)

This dish is WAY too wonderful to be called a name that is so plain.  I made this with Tilapia filets, and would call it something like "Bruschetta-topped Fish Filets."  We loved it, and will definitely have it again.

I'm not sure why my halibut didn't turn out as well as others did.  The feta didn't melt and actually lost its flavor after being cooked.  The toppings didn't do anything to compliment the halibut.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was edible...and healthy.

This was very good and fairly easy to prepare. The feta (I used tomato-basil) added so much flavor. I cooked the veggies in a grill pan, and I added some black olives. This is a keeper--next time, I'll try adding sun-dried tomatoes.

Oh yeah, oh yeah. Chubby hubby made it for me and himself and it was yummy. Full of anti-inflammatory ingreadients - oh yeah oh yeah. Left out the zuccini because nobody likes it, especially poor Anoose. Too bad, too bad.  Also cooked it for much longer, much longer. Julia Child knows how to cook - oh yeah, oh yeah. She says that you should never cook fish "until it flakes" - no flakes, no flakes. Halibut itself could have used some seasoning, some seasoning. Otherwise, a yummy recipe. Recommended for acne sufferers.

My husband and I LOVED this!  It's very light, fresh and melt in your mouth delicious.  Very easy too.  We will definitely be making this again.  I can't wait to serve it to guests.

This was extremely good!!  I made it exactly how the recipe said.  Halibut is a little pricey but definitely worth it!

My boyfriend really liked these, but I wasn't as fond. The feta goes really well with the fisj though. I thought the tomatoes provided to much juice, so maybe next time I'll try and squeeze most of the liquid out.

I followed this recipe with just a few minor edits.  I used Mahi Mahi in place of halibut and it was wonderful!  I also baked for 30 mins and used 4 TBS basil, two while cooking zucchini and two when mixing up with tomatoes.  This was SO declicious!  I also used a tomato basil crumbled feta cheese from Target.  Mmmm!

This recipe was wonderful.  I used Flounder instead of Halibut because that is what my grocery store had.  I also used canned tomatoes instead of fresh.  It was still absolutely fantastic.  It tasted like it came straight from a restaurant.  I loved the feta cheese.

Excellent and healthy tasting, although it took me almost twice as long to cook (I cut thick pieces of zuccini and added spinach). My family loved it.

Pretty good! It was definitely the topping which made the meal. The store didn't have halibut so I used orange roughy which took longer to bake so the toppings were getting crisp, but still yummy.

I very rarely give 5 stars, but this one is a winner!  I used all the ingredients listed, but just threw it in. I don’t measure anything, because I’m biased towards the things I like ( basil, garlic..) I did use a glass baking dish instead of a sheet, as It helps to keep the fish super moist. If you go with the glass, bake them about 10 min longer. This was fantastic!  My wife said she would go to a restaurant for it!!

This is a great recipe! My husband and I enjoyed it. I will definitely prepare again. I marinated  the Halibut filet in  Mrs Dash Lime Garlic marinade for 25 minutes which gave the fish an additional wonderful flavor and kept the fish moist. I covered with foil while baking for the first 8 minutes, then uncovered to allow Feta to melt. 
I served this recipe with brown rice and kale slaw. Super healthy and tasty meal.

Easy to make  and would work with any fish, except tuna steaks and salmon, in my opinion. Wouldn't change a thing! I used garlic & herb Feta because that's what I had on hand. Tuna should be quick seared and served pink, and salmon may need a heartier topping.

I made a modified version without zucchini and substituted roasted red peppers for the tomatoes, and went very heavy on the Basil.   This allowed me to avoid needing tomatoes and zucchini fresh, as I discovered too late that those were no longer available when I began.   I grow Basil and you really cannot have too much Basil on it I don't think as it bakes down.  Was wonderful with the red peppers.  Named this Greek Baked Halibut. Feta was key as well as the Basil.

Didn't have any zucchini so I substituted kale instead.  It got a little crispy in the oven.  Sounds strange but it was really good.  I'm sure it would be just as good with just tomatoes.  This recipe is very easy and super tasty, will definitely make it again.

I made it with Atlantic Cod.  I did drain the tomatoes after chopping.  This made the result less juicy.  Cod is not as firm as Halibut, but is a lot cheaper.  Made this recipe many times and everyone loves it!

Sorry. Second post for this recipe. It was very good and healthy. Seemed like it needed more flavor. I added some asparagus and artichokes with a baked potato on the side.

Needing to use up things in my freezer, I adapted the recipe:  Frozen cod (marinated in Italian dressing), frozen chopped spinach (husband doesn't like zucchini), canned Italian-style tomatoes, dried basal. I poured part of the dressing into the pan to keep the fish moist as it cooked. I had to add some extra time since the fish was still partially frozen, but otherwise followed the rest of the recipe. Will definitely make this again. I really liked the Italian/feta/spinach combo of ingredients.

I made this for supper last night I am dieting so I wanted something healthier I found I didn’t need the oil in the pan because I talked with the mixture and you created enough liquid that it almost poked the fish which was lovely..  I personally would prefer a little more garlic but that could be my personal preference but I liked it and I used it with card not Halliburton but I think you could top any fish with this and it would be a smashing success

So good. I seasoned the fish with Old Bay Seasoning before I topped it with the veggies. My DH loved it.

Easy and delicious!  When I make it I again, and I will, I will follow some of the reviewers' suggestions to marinate, use more spices, or maybe add a bit of white wine.  It was a bit bland for my taste.  I sliced the tomatoes and used them as a bed under the fish.  Since I had a red pepper, I chopped that and sautéed it with the zucchini then spread over the halibut.  This is a good recipe; it just needs an added bit of oomph.

I make this all the time, generally I just throw all the vegetables in a pan to roast together with all the ingredients, no need to sauté anything first.  Comes out great everytime.  I do usually fry the fish (i prefer mahi-mahi ) with a little olive oil and salt and pepper on it's own.

I was looking for a light, fresh tasting recipe to try on the  halibut I bought, and this was a perfect choice!  It tasted so fresh with all the veggies, and the feta complimented the fish nicely, without being overpowering.  My kids are normally not big on zucchini, but didn't even notice it mixed in with the other flavors.  Definite keeper!

My husband said it was five star restaurant worthy.  I only changed one thing ingredient wise, because I did not have fresh basil, I used basil I'd dried prior.  And cooked the halibut for about three extra minutes.  Excellent.

I used canned tomatoes and lowered the cooking temp to 400 and only 13 minutes, because my halibut filets were smaller than 6 oz.  The feta had a nice brown on it.

At the suggestion of other reviewers, I marinated the halibut in a champagne dressing for about an hour or so.  Otherwise, I made it as the recipe instructed.  It was tasty...a little on the bland side as I like more flavor, but I think if I salted the fish before marinating, that would make a difference.  I'd make it again to try other variations.

I made this with fresh (never frozen) halibut following the recipe exactly as written....it was so delicious!! I printed the recipe and gave it to the seafood market to share with other customers. The second time I made it there seemed to be more water in the fish, hence my comment on "fresh, never frozen".

Beautiful, Festive and Delicious! Followed the recipe almost exactly as  written, but  did marinate the fish for an hour  in  a small amount of Italian salad dressing as other reviewers suggested. Baked the fish at 450 degrees covered with foil for 10 minutes and uncovered for 10 (my  steaks were thick!)
My husband commented that this was the best fish I've ever made  (and we've been married 36 years lol)
Will definitely make again! Can't wait to try it out on guests!

This is really easy and tasty! My husband isn't big on fish, but actually likes this dish quite a bit! I use cotija cheese instead of feta, probably a little saltier, but we live in Mexico so it's the closest I could think of, and it works very well with the fish and vegetables! Love this recipe!

Very good but Gene thought it a little bland.  Doubled the garlic, added a bit more onion and marinated halibut in Olive Garden Italian dressing for four or five hours.  Don't overlook!  Try cooking for 14  or 14 1/2 minutes.

Slipped the skins then removed the seeds before dicing the tomatoes. Substituted yellow summer squash for zucchini (it's what I had on hand). Gave the top of the fish fillets a light coating of low fat Italian dressing just before baking.

Delicious. Based on other comments, I salted and peppered the steaks before placing them in the baking dish. I also made double the vegetables and added a pinch of red pepper flakes (I had only 2 steaks). Finally, to make sure the fish stayed moist, I spread a thin coating of mayo over the steaks before adding the veggies and feta. I did cover loosely with foil. My hubby said the result was "restaurant quality."

Like other reviewers, I marinated the halibut steaks in Italian dressing for a couple of hours, increased the volume of veggies and added half a yellow bell pepper for additional color.   I cut the halibut steaks fairly thick so I seared the steaks briefly and let them cool before putting in the oven with veggies on top.  I baked for about 8 or 9 minutes and it came out perfect!

Halibut was bland and tough in spite of using temperature gauge to ensure doneness.   Family was not impressed.  Will not make again.

Great recipe.  I used the canned tomatoes as others suggested along with a little greek seasoning I had.  I also marinated the halibut in italian dressing as was suggested. I mixed all the vegetables together and microwaved them for 5 minutes instead of sauteing them. The cooking time was spot on.

This was fabulous!  I am not very proficient cooking fish, but I tried this and wished that I had purchased larger steaks.  This recipe has definitely been added to my repetoire.

This is one of my favorite recipes and almost can't go wrong.  Can even be used with haddock if halibut too expensive. Highly recommend and definitely deserves 5 stars

Excellent, easy recipe for fish!  I made it just as stated except I used cod instead of halibut since halibut wasn't available.  The cod was fine, in fact I don't think it would matter what type of white fish you use because the vegetable mixture is so flavorful.  Very easy and couldn't be healthier...I will make this regularly.  Thank you Dakota Kelly for the recipe!

OMG it was fantastic!!!  I did marinate the fish in Italian dressing a few hours as suggested by another user, and my halibut was fresh caught and like 4 inches tall a foot long and around 6 inches wide so I sliced it into 2 inch steaks to the skin, but left it as a chunk so when I cooked it, I cooked it a little longer and shoved the veggie mix in between the steaks as well as on top.  I also omitted the tomatoes (allergies) but OMG fabulous!!  Will make again for sure, in fact for the next dinner party! Thank you for sharing!!!

*update: I subbed yellow squash for the tomato, and did this with talapia filets, deliciouuussssss!!! Home run recipe.

Really Good! Easy to make, first time followed the recipe exactly using Halibut steaks. My husband loved it so much he wanted to try it on other things so we used Haddock the second time and Chicken thighs the third. Just need to adjust the baking time depending on what you are using as the meat/fish but yummy each time.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and he loved it. I followed the suggestion of some others and marinated in Italian dressing beforehand. It was awesome to use all local vegetables from my CSA! Tomatoes, squash, onions, and basil - perfect for the summer. It was so fresh and delicious, I only wish I'd made double so he could have had seconds. Paired it with some savory potatoes and a not-too-expensive chardonnay and the dinner was a big success.

I used a fillet for this recipe because that's what my freezer is full of. Since the fillets were pretty thick i had to extend the cooking time quite a bit which led to the feta being a little bit more browned than it should have been. That being said it was still a great dish and will definitely be made in this house again

This was absolutely perfect!  I used a filet instead of steaks, so I had to up the cooking time a bit (about another 10 mins, but the toppings kept the fish so moist as it cooked!).  The flavors work beautifully together, and it was a very easy meal to prepare.  Only minor addition I made was after dicing the tomatoes, I sprinkled them with seasoning salt while I was cooking the zucchini and onion.  I think it helped bring out more flavor, since other reviewers indicated the tomatoes seemed bland.  I served it with a side of couscous with basil, sun-dried tomatoes, and spinach.

This was pretty tasty! I followed some of the comments: seasoned the fish itself, used the canned toms with garlic/basil/oregano, added some lemon juice and crushed red pepper flakes. It is very easy and simple, but I agree with some others; it is not necessary to spend the big money on the halibut (I just paid $25/lb) because the flavor comes from the basil (I used dried because that's what I had), tomatoes, garlic, feta etc. I think this would be equally as delicious with any white fish: cod, tilapia etc. I just got a bag of "Uncle Ben's" brown/wild rice (micro pouch) and served it on top, yummy!

This has become one of my favourite ways to make fish.  I use Halibut fillets and add dry basil when I don't have fresh on hand.  Great mediterranean taste with the salty feta/tomato/zucchini/basil mixture.  This is simple and quick and the results are fantastic.  Definitely a keeper, thanks!

Made this recipe for 2 people but with the 4 servings of vegetable topping and ate the extra as a side.  It was very delicious, easy and quick to make.  Will definitely make it again!

Very tasty!   I couldn't get halibut so I used Cod instead.   Tasted great!  A definite hit with my family!

I used haddock since that was available fresh.  Deleted the zucchini since my husband hates it, and added sliced black olives to sprinkle on top of the feta cheese.  Also used tomatoes I had jarred this summer.  I had more tomatoes than needed so added salt, pepper and a bit of brown sugar and stewed them to serve with the fish.  Delicious!  This is a definite keeper.

My husband and I loved this! The only change I made was to cut the amount of onion down to 1/3 C.  Next time I will make twice the amount of veggies as they are so good!  This is by far my favorite halibut recipe!  I served it with cous cous and french bread.  A keeper!  Thanks!

This is a super low fat recipe.  I doubled the vegetables and increased the cooking time to 30 minutes.  The fish was moist and delicious.  It reminds me more of Greece than Italy, but mediterranean none the less.

This was wonderful and so fresh. I would use the tomato mixture on a lot of other fish and maybe even chicken. We really enjoyed this recipe and used low fat feta as well. It did not melt as well, but the feta got a little crunchy at the edges and added a great little crunch to it!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe and so EASY! I got one 0.9lb for myself & bf and marinated the fish steak in the juice of half a lemon.  Salted both sides, and added a pinch of pepper, and let that sit in the fridge while I did the prep work.  I used 1 large roma tomato and 2 small zuchinnis to amp up the veggies, and surrounded the fish with them in the baking dish. I also used 1 large clove garlic, and half a small sweet onion. Perfect! I will be making this frequently!

This was delicious!  I did not have Halibut or fresh tomatoes on hand so I substituted Orange Roughy and canned diced tomatoes, and it was fine.  I also doubled the topping recipe and covered the filets completely and it was so moist and flavorful!  We will have this again and again!

This was so good!  I had to use orange roughy b/c thats all the store had and so I was worried but it turned out great.  I did take a shortcut by using the canned diced tomatoes w/garlic and oregano and then added additional fresh garlic and basil and it was perfectly flavored!  Served over brown rice.  Thanks for the great meal!

Our family was divided on this one.  Half gave it a thumbs up and the others weren't as impressed.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that we had to substitute tilapia for the halibut . . . .  We did marinate the fish in Italian dressing as someone else had suggested.  Perhaps I'm just not a fan of baked fish -- I prefer mine with a drier texture.

This was very, very good. I took the previous reviewers suggestions and marinated the halibut in Italian dressing for 1/2 hour or so then followed the recipe as written. I would have given this 5 stars but the sauce was missing something - I'm thinking it needs a splash of a dry white or red wine to make it perfect. Thanks for sharing Dakota!

Unfortunately I did not enjoy this as much as I had hoped I would. I thought the fish was bland, and I did marinate it in Italian dressing for a while. I enjoyed the veggies though. I thought they were great.

I used grey sole, since halibut was out of season and the flavor was perfect!  I also cooked it for 30 minutes like the other reviewers had mentioned.  Next time I may try salmon.

The only reason why i am giving this any stars is beacuse i didnt use Halibut,it was too expensive. i used white fish, which i now know i dont care for. and i used motzerella cause i don't care for feta. the tomatoe over took the flavor (and i used less then what it called for) it was not filling at all. i served with rice pilaf wich was a good side choice.  if your a light eater this may be a healthy, flavorless snack. but if you are feeding a big hungry body builder husband. not a good choice. how ever it was very simple. i wish it had more flavor. i loved how simple it was.

After one bite, my guy informed me this was "restaurant quality."  For the flavor, I couldn't believe how easy and healthy this recipe was.  It was a perfect week night meal--I'll definitely make this again.  I used tilapia because that's what I had on hand, used fresh basil instead of the dried and left out the onions because I don't like them.

The flavors in this dish were incredible!  The tomatoes and basil gave it such a nice fresh taste, while the feta added a great tangy bite.  I plan to make this often!

This was really good.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I really liked the halibut and thought it had a nice flavor.  In fact, the vegtables may have even overpowered it a little.  Overall, it was a good dish.

This is the first recipe I've ever rated on here because it is the first one I thought was wonderful enough to do so.  I'm single and bought a package with 2 halibut steaks.  However I did keep the rest of the recipe the same because I wanted lots of veggies.  I didn't change anything else and it was absolutely delicious!  I always worry about undercooking fish but the time given was perfect even with the mounds of veggies on it.

I marinated the fish overnight in Italian dressing, as suggested by others...in the end the fish was still tasteless, underneath the veggie topping.  Yuk.

This was really good. The zucchini at the grocery didn't look very good, so I used asparagus. Also, I had a lot of extra vegetables so i ate it just as a vegetable medley and it was very good. Actually reheated pretty well too.:)

Yum! This is perfect. I bought halibut steaks on the bone by mistake but the fish just fell off the bone. I really like this because it's healthy and tasty.

These were good but very fishy smelling. The juices from the veggies were too much. I think that is why they were so fishy.

This was a great recipe for our first halibut meal.  My husband loved its "fresh" taste.  I'll probably add more cheese next time, but that's just because we're cheese fanatics.  Thanks for sharing!

This was fabulous!  I used canned diced tomatoes with basil since I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand.  I couldn't find halibut at the store so I used Cod steaks.  My husband, 9 year old and I loved it.

This was very yummy! The sauteed veggies on top are a hit! I substituted salmon for halibut because my husband likes it better though. And I also used a feta, parm, mont jack mix for the cheese. Thanks for the recipe

I could not find halibut and used tilapia instead.  This was pretty easy and tasted good, although it was a little bland.  I will use more feta if I ever make this again.

This recipe was amazing.  I made a lot more of the topping (because I had a bunch of zucchinis), and it was really good just as a side.

The fish came out very bland, but the topping was very good & I could picture using that again, even putting it on top of noodles.

My husband who is not a fish eater loved this. I added pepper flakes and put a pat of butter on each fish...I don't know if i really needed to do that I just wanted to make sure it came out moist. This recipe is sooo good.

This tasted excellent!  I used Flounder and Tomato-Basil feta instead of plain feta.  It turned out great, and I definately plan on making it again!

The topping for this was pretty good, but I would reduce the amount of onion next time.  Also, the halibut tasted a little too fishy; maybe I should have cooked it longer.  I would make the topping again to maybe put on something else.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and WOW!!! It is so good! The fish turned out so moist and delicious!I took the advice of other reviewers and added some red pepper flakes to the zucchini mixture.  What a super, quick, and healthy meal! Thanks, Dakota!
