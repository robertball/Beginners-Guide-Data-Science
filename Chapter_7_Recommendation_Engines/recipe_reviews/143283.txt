I could see how this would be a good sauce over pulled pork once combined with the smokiness of the pork.  I simmered this sauce for an hour and it was still very runny.  It is a little too sweet/vinegary for my taste.  Like Kelly says in the sauce description, I feel like it would be much better with some premade barbeque sauce mixed in.

I scaled way back on this recipe but made as written. I too felt it was too sweet. Mine wasn't too awful thin but just too sweet. If I were to make this again I would cut back on the honey and molasses and leave out the syrup entirely. This has potential and reminds me of a Kansas City style bbq sauce which are my favorite.
