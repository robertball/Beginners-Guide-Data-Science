This was a home run! I used honeyham (a cheap not so tasty one at that)... Added a sprinkle of granulated garlic and powdered onion (just our personal flavor) and sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil and used 3T of margarine... I also let it simmer for 30 minutes waiting for DH to get home... It REALLY was great. I'm not a huge fan of cabbage and still loved it... The best part though is that it was EASY to make even with 2 toddlers hanging on my legs! LOL

Excellent!  I needed to use up leftover ham from Easter and through I would try this recipe.  The whole family loved it.  I didn't change a thing on the recipe and will be making this anytime I have leftover ham!

I'm so glad I tried this!!!  I simplified this by buying bagged shredded cabbage, and it was a breeze!  I know what recipe I'm going to when I have left over ham!

Easy and quick. Add more flavor by using garlic salt, and I did not use all that butter. I used about 2 big table spoons after I added the cabbage. And used olive oil to saute the onion.

3.5 Used less butter, not too bad and a nice change.  Served with mashed carrots and parsnips.

I was looking for a recipe to use up all the ham leftover from Easter & this one was a hit!  Very easy to make & tasted delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly other than I didn't have any gnocchi on hand (I've never even heard of gnocchi, lol) so I used maybe a cup & a half of rotini noodles.  Delicious & I'll definately be making this again!  Thanx for the recipe, Scott!!

I enjoyed this but my family was not impressed.  I thought it was a good way to use up the leftover ham I had from Christmas.  I happen to love cabbage and I keep trying different recipes with cabbage on my family hoping they will come around.

I didn't expect to like this as much as I did.  I was skeptical that it did not have any sauce, but it worked!  I did cut down the butter to 1/4 cup and cooked the ham in the cabbage to help flavor the dish.  Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for something to cook with some bagged cabbage and uncooked pork.  I just chopped up and cooked  the pork with salt/pepper, onion and 3 cloves of garlic.  Then added bagged cabbage, half the butter and  the cooked whole wheat gnocchi.   Pretty good.

I had a ton of leftover ham from the holidays.  Had frozen it and was looking for ways to use it.  This was GOOD.  I used a bit less butter, a bit more ham and added some red pepper flakes.  I also browned my gnocchi in a little butter after boiling and before adding to the mix.  All in all, very good!  The only problem...now I have another ton of leftovers!  Next time, will make half a recipe and will still have lefties for lunch and possibly another supper.  I will also consider adding some frozen (or fresh, if you're lucky enough to have access to them) green peas.  Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the instructions and didn't change anything. I was really surprised that it was as good as it was. My husband is not a big fan of cabbage but he loved it and even said honey you need to make this again...So, I guess I will be making this again.... Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is delish, and a great way to use up leftover ham! We used pasta noodles in place of the gnocchi, as it's what we had on hand, but next time I think we'll try it the original way, just for the fun of it.

Great comfort food and easy to make.  I used thick cut of smoked bacon in lieu of the ham which added more flavor in my opinion.

I've made this recipe many times and found it to have excellent flavors and a really nice meal on cold fall or winter days.  I've also experimented with Virginia country ham (use a bit less salt because the ham has loads of salt) egg noodles, and chopped fresh sage at the finish.  I get requests every time from co-workers when I bring it in for lunch.

I have never had gnocchi and did not see any in the grocery store, so I made my own.  I was not a fan.  Other than the gnocchi, this is a very good recipe.  I shall try it again with different gnocchi.
I made this again with Ricotta Gnocchi from this site.  It is SO much better.  This is good stuff!

Made this with some changes, using what I had, and it was delicious!  Didn't use gnocchi because I didn't have any, substituted cooked potatoes,  added a little chicken broth, and simmered for about half an hour.  Tasted so much better than I expected it to!

I didn't have gnocchi on hand so I used frozen egg noodles.  I cooked the noodles in a quart of chicken broth; sauted 4 cloves of minced garlic and a med onions in the butter  and added half a package of frozen peas the last 15 mins of cooking.  I added the peas because I only had half a head of cabbage.  The peas and cabbage combo was very good.  As U did not drain the noodles from the chicken broth but continued cooking with it as the base, the final product became more of  a stew which we ate in bowls along with some crusty bread.  There were no leftovers.  This recipe is a keeper, a new family favorite and a comfort food great for cold nights but June in Mississippi wasn't bad either.

It was "ok". I make a Russian dish called Kapusta that is similar but made with kielbasa that I feel is more flavorful so prefer that dish over this one.  This is not a keeper for me.

This was really tasty and easy - we substituted angel hair for the gnocchi.
