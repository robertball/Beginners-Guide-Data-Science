Very good cookies!!!! I just took the first batch out of the oven and they are soft and tender. I substituted margarine for the butter and the batter was still very soft after chilling. I am sure that wouldn't have been a problem had I used the butter. I may add chocolate chips to the remaining cookie dough. Very easy recipe to make!!
