I was pretty skeptical about this recipe at first. I've never had soup for dessert before, but this was really good. I followed the recipe except that I didn't have 3 hours to chill it, so I put it in the freezer for an hour. It was really good, and nice and frothy. My boyfriend and I both liked it.

I got many compliments on this soup,
including one from an international 
chef.  Wonderful taste (really follow the
directions about the wine, it does make
a difference.)  The only reason I have it 
low on the kid friendly is the use of the
stove with the wine and sugar.

I love strawberries, and I love wine, but somehow, I think something got lost in the way. The wine flavour was way too strong and made the soup taste kind of bitter. I'm going to  give it another go with another kind of wine and a bit less quantity, since I really love the idea.

we really liked this one. I have made it several times, always as a soup and although people have said it was good enough to be a desert, I definitely like this as an alternative to a hot soup. Unlike some other strawberry soup recipes on this site this one is dairy free which can be a plus!

I never thought I would make a cold fruit soup. I stumbled upon this recipe and happened to have all the ingredients on hand. I'm very glad I tried it! It was cool and refreshing, perfect for summer. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Always use a wine you like. Never use a wine you won't drink.
