Very easy to make and fast. I used fresh garden tomatoes (early girls) and blanched, skinned and seeded them. This was basically exactly what I was looking for to use up tomatoes. The sauce I used in a homemade chili recipe but tasted good when I tested it. I will make this again. I removed the garlic at the end since my husband doesn't love garlic.

The only difference is I add more garlic, and I roast the garlic.

Everyone at my Thanksgiving meal loved the sauce. I even saved a little for myself and enjoyed it for dinner last evening.

Quite good, but it needed more *umph*. I put extra salt, and a Tablespoon of sugar to balance put the acidity.

Next time I'll use 1/2 the onion and garlic. Very quick to make and that I loved.

Excellent. Simple and quick to put together, but tasted great. Used dried Basil and added some Bay Leaves.

I doubled the recipe, and added a teaspoon of allspice,  One green pepper  and a quarter cup of chopped cilantro. I used bush Basil instead of sweet Basil.  I also used Roma tomatoes fresh from the garden, skinned but I left the seeds in. 
 I blended the sauce with an immersion blender after it had been simmering for half an hour.

It is a good recipe but I rendered a piece of pancetta in the oil and garlic and I put some red pepper flakes in with it so the flakes would give forth their oils.   The source was great.   Thank you

Very authentic! Instead of already chopped tomatoes I used whole peeled ones and it added a bit more texture to the sauce. I squished them in my hand and then put them in the pot. Used on top of homemade pasta and it was an amazing turnout!
