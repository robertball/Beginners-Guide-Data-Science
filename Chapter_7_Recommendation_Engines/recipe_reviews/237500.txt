Just a quick note to my Namesake in the US of A. Similar to the black cherry clafoutis, it is properly called a 'flaugnarde’  My Grandfather, who was a French trained chef, said the name comes from fleunhe or  flaunhard meaning  "soft" or "cushioned". But by any name, it tastes great! Keep up the good work, Mate, you are very popular here in Australia.

This is like three deserts in one. It comes out very pretty too. I didn't have blackberries so I used blueberries and used two peaches and it was wonderful!

Picked a bunch of blackberries and peaches and was looking for a good way to use them all up.  The recipe sounded unusual and interesting so I thought I'd give it a try. My family loved it :)

The batter cooks up to a nice texture, sort of a cross between a pancake and a custard. I used a 9" deep dish pie plate and whole wheat pastry flour. I was pleasantly surprised that it did not have a strong whole wheat taste.  I've made it twice and got raves both times!

Love this for breakfast, used a little less sugar. Made twice, once without peaches since I didn’t have any.

I was looking for a good summer recipe and in Texas peaches and blackberries are in abundance. I love this recipe I did lower the sugar and I also strained the batter before pouring it in the dish. It made it come out light and fluffier than anticipated.

Served warm for breakfast with bacon.  Very good.  Used frozen peaches (thawed and drained well) as I didn't have fresh and fresh blackberries.  Very nice and light.   Do not be afraid of the thyme and pepper.  They added an interesting flavor profile that was very pleasant.   Anxious to try with other fruit combinations.

Such a quick and delicious recipe.  I can't wait to make this one again and try some different variants.  A couple things I did differently...Instead of a casserole dish I used a 9 inch pie dish and I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup (next time around I might even use a 1/4 cup) I did this because i figured the fruit and the milk would provide plenty of sugar for this dessert which it did.  Topped with homeade whipped cream (no added sugar here either) and served cold, delicious!

Sorry to say, we were disappointed. The dough was very heavy Maybe it would be better with white flour.

These flaugnardes are a hit no matter what fruit combination one uses. A clafoutis is only made with cherries. If any other fruit is used, it becomes a flaugnarde. The French pronunciation is "flown-yard." There is no hard "g" sound in the word. As always, Chef John can provide a good recipe to widen one's personal menu rotation.

I decided to try making this as an easy Thanksgiving dessert, since we were looking for a lower sugar option then straight pies and whatnot. I was surprised at how easy it was to make, and how tasty it came out. All of our guests really liked it too and were surprised when I told them it was only a few steps. Will make again for sure. I used a pint of frozen peach slices and thawed them a bit instead of fresh, it worked great.

I've made this without peaches (because I didn't have peaches at the time, just blackberries and raspberries). And no, I didn't just make it because I wanted to say I was playing with flognardes (OKAY, THAT'S A BALD LIE, OF COURSE I DID). Anyway, the result was delicious. I can't wait to actually make it with the peaches the way the recipe advises, now. 

If I find some fresh sprigs of tarragon or dill to arrange on top as decoration, I can even claim to have tried my hand at messing with a nine tailed flognarde! 

(I know, the correct pronunciation of "flognarde" doesn't really work with the pun, but the temptation is there, nonetheless).

We now live and breathe flognarde. So good, the savory creaminess of the custard and the sweetness of the peaches and blackberries - keeper for sure!

Followed recipe 1st time straight up. Our pan was perhaps not flat enough, so it took a bit extra time in oven to set. I used dried thyme, ground a bit in a mortar & pestle, and the flavor was extraordinary. 

For my own tastes, next time I  would sub fine ground white pepper, and less of it. I love blackberry flavor, but seeds bug me so perhaps I'd use blueberries instead,  and a more wide shallow pan.

We made mini Flognardes to share with our friends. Nice and easy recipe, but we baked it a little long then called for. Also, I was expecting it to be sweeter than it was. Maybe a nice simple icing on top would do the trick?!

I cannot believe how good this was!  And so easy.  I reduced the sugar slightly because I prefer less sweet.  The thyme and black pepper made this dessert spectacular.

Super easy-- takes just a few minutes to whip this up!  My family really enjoyed this.  It's not overly sweet, and the thyme was a nice element.  Will definitely make again.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some blackberries and came across this one from Chef John. I didn't have any peaches and I didn't have any tyme but I still used the recipe. I added some blueberries and slivered almonds and cinnamon. It was delicious.  I knew if I started with a chef John recipe that it would turn out good.
