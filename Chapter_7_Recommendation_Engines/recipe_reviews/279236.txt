Very tasty! I do think you could get away with WAY less butter. Not only was there an excess amount, the lemon pepper flavor gets diluted in it. No turkey baster neede either...just drizzle or brush the butter over the fish.  Also try and use a pan that's not much bigger than the first, otherwise the butter starts to burn. Mine was perfectly done after 7 minutes. I used panko bread crumbs because that's what I had on hand, and it added a nice crunch.
