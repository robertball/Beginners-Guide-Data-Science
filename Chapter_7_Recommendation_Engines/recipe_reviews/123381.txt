This was really bland.  I had to add a lot of stuff to give it good flavour.  This was filling, but not too tasty.

I made this at my hubby's request... it's delicious!  I used black pepper instead of cayenne.  Will definitely make this again.  (Keep thinking of the line near end of "A Christmas Story" when the Bumpis's dogs run off with their turkey -- "..no turkey leftovers, no turkey soup, no turkey hash!")

This was excellent! I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey and red potatoes. I did need to add a good bit of extra butter (and a little canola oil) to allow browning without burning. I served this topped with fried eggs for Sunday brunch.

Simple and good!  I only had a yellow bell pepper so that's what I used.  I diced up my potatoes pretty small so they would cook quick.  I used fresh grated nutmeg and it was a genius touch.  Perfect topped with 2 fried eggs ;)

I added mushrooms and celery. I enjoyed it. And my husband did too. He went for seconds.
