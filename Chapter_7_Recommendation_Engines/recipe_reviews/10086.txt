Thank you SO much for posting this recipe.  Martha Stewart had a very similar recipe in a magazine from years ago and I have been unable to find it until now.  I always make very unique Christmas cookies to get the oohs and ahhs, and this one really makes a pretty presentation.  The cookie texture is delightful and the filling is absolutely delicious.  I do add a 1 tsp. of lemon juice to the date mixture as I've seen with other date fillings although I'm not sure what it assists in doing.  You don't taste the lemon.

These taste OK, but think a better suited name would be Date Swirl Cookies. I was looking foward to the date rolls my Grandma used to make, that were 1/4" tall round cookies that kept their shape after baking. These cooked down and flattened out like a regular cookie, and wasn't really what I was expecting for a date roll.

I've made these many, many times. My husband loves these cookies. I only get about 4 dozen out of this recipe, but we like thicker cookies. I use butter-flavored shortening sticks when I make it and I think these taste great! They are a big hit even with people that don't care for dates.

These are really, really good! Very light, very tasty. I follow it exactly and they turn out well every time.
