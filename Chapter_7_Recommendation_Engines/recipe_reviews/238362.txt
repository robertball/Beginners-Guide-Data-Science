Used a combo of vanilla and plain Greek yogurt and didn't feel the need for the sugar for our tastes, so I omitted it.  A lassi is very similar to a smoothie, and I must admit that I love them.  I've tried many different smoothies and a few lassis on this site, and I think this is one of the easiest and the best, perhaps because of its simplicity.  It's just pure banana flavor with a little tang from the yogurt.  Very, very nice!

WOW!  Loved it.  I just got banana on sale and printed this and made it.  Great.  I was too lazy to get the sugar out of the cabinet so I put in 2 packets of truvia.  Amazing.  Very fast to make.
Will make it again and often, great way to use up bananas.
Thanks

Looking for someway to use overripe bananas I came across this recipe. Made some alterations in the interests of time, I.e., made one serving using 1 banana, 1/2 c + 2tbsp Dannon Lit & Fit Greek style vanilla yogurt(since I had it on hand), no sweetener, about 1/2c skimmed milk, pinch of nutmeg,  & 5 ice cubes. About 45 sec in my Nutribullet made a great tasting smoothly. Nice diet lunch on a hot summer day.

This was excellent and I recommend trying it! I scaled this down to one serving, using a container of plain Greek yogurt and one vanilla Activia yogurt. After I tasted it, I found that no additional sugar was needed. My banana was quite small, so the lassi had a subtle banana taste which I think I enjoyed more, and a nice tang from the yogurts. Thanks for this delicious lassi recipe, Ivy!
