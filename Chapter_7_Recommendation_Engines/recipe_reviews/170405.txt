I used my own ranch dressing as a base instead of bottled ranch dressing. I also increased the horseradish. This was my dipping sauce for my lunch of broccoli flowerettes, cherry tomatoes and baby carrots. Delicious.

I'm actually the first to rate this?  Oh, the pressure. :-)  Well, it was obviously very easy.  I used it with some chicken nuggets.  I actually prefer a regular ranch dip for those but didn't have sour cream, so I tried this.  It was good and did the trick, but a little too much of something - perhaps Worcestershire.  I'm *still* trying to use up some packaged ranch dressing I made (stupid me - it's got milk in it and can't be kept around), but normally I don't have ranch around.  So I may play with this and see what I can do with it without the ranch.

This tasted like just ranch to me.  I had to keep adding Worcestershire and horseradish to get the flavors to really talk to me.  Once I found a balance I liked, it was great with homemade chicken tenders.

My husband asked last minute for a mayo sauce. My name is also Valerie so it caught my eye. I had the ingredients and whipped it up...except I didnâ€™t have the Worcestershire sauce...substituted a bourbon sauce. He LOVED it. We toasted some bread slathered on the sauce with lettuce, tomato and a pan fried salmon steak. It was gone before I could take a picture. Thank you for the great recipe!

I really don't like the mayo in it.  I dilutes the ranch dressing and makes it too sweet.  I added some (1/2 tsp) hot Chinese mustard and am letting it sit in the fridge for a while hoping the flavors combine and the garlic wakes it up.  I may change my rating if it gets better.  Well, the horseradish and garlic woke up and it's better.  I added a tablespoon of dry ranch dressing and a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes.  By dinner, it wasn't bad.  On the chicken tenders, it was pretty good.  I may try it again with just ranch dressing and no mayo.  The mustard and pepper flakes really helped it. I'll also use fresh grated horseradish.

I added 1 Tbsp of ketchup. I agree it needs some tweaking but it's a good start.
