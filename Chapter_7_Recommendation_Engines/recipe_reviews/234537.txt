This meal was absolutely fabulous and super simple to make,  would be great for company because it is so low maintenance.  I trimmed most of the fat from the pork chunks to make it a little more healthy.  I skipped the fennel, husband isn't a fan, but included everything else.  While I wish I had a mortar and pestle to make the paste, sadly I don't (yet) so I could only stir all the rub ingredients together.  Good news, it turned out better than fine.  I wasn't sure my husband and 2 teenage boys would like the beans and greens, I think it is safe to say they were a hit since I had to make another batch to go with their second helping of pork - they devoured 4 cans of beans!   I considered subbing spinach and glad I didn't.  The best bites included the pork, beans and greens altogether.  We drizzled some of the pork juice on top, was soooo good.  Only thing I would do different next time is serve it with some warm crusty bread (and butter) - still mad at myself for forgetting to buy a loaf.

Make this, you won't be disappointed.  This might actually be my all time favorite allrecipes.com meal.  I also just found my new go to method for cooking roasts, beats the crock pot everyday.

I used a combo of escarole & arugula.  And used A LOT more greens since they cook down so much.  This was delicious and the family loved it!

Made exactly as written and it came out amazingly good! So simple to make and transformed this cheaper cut of meat into a juicy and flavorful show stopper. Thank you for this recipe!

I loved everything about this and couldn’t decide it my favorite part was the beans, greens, or pork! I made the pork again, the exact same ingredients—sans beans and greens—as my greens had went bad, but prepared it in a slow cooker and it came out in that pulled pork texture. It had a texture that the kids preferred. But for company, the chunks are definitely better. I will alternate how I make it.

This is a delicious, company-worthy meal! The only change I had to make was kale (de-stemmed) and a little baby arugula due to lack of availability of more mature arugula. Making this again and again. Thank you!

Much flavor! Next time I will double the beans and triple the greens. (I had fresh adult spinach leaves).

Again, as with all of Cheg John's recipes, there were no leftovers. Good stuff!

Awesome!  Only change was I used spinach and some kale instead of arugula cuz it's what we had on hand already.  I might cut back on the hot pepper flakes a bit next time (for my wife) but I loved it.  Doubled the beans too.  They would work great for other dishes too.  Highly recommend.

This was SO good.  My local store did not have arugula (mature or baby...) so instead I made some of Chef John's creamed spinach to go under the beans and meat.  It was delicious.  This made enough meat to have leftovers tonight, and the flavor was maybe even better.  Meat is still moist, but with the au jus  spooned over it that gets created in the initial bake, it is even better.  Try this one out - you will not be disappointed.

excellent recipe - perfect proportions - but the arugula is a bit bitter for our taste - not sure what else it would go with.

Our cut of pork shoulder was too fatty but the rest of the meal and the non fatty cuts of pork were good.
