This is a yummy recipe.  The next time I will try to cut the fat in the recipe in several ways because I don't think it will detract from the taste.  I will decrease the amount of oil and/or butter by about 25-50% because there were pools of oil on the top of the sauce at the end.  I will also use a combination of half and half and milk combined with flour to thicken the sauce instead of heavy cream.  The mushrooms I added were a great addition.

This is a great recipe for company!

The sherry added a delightfully subtle flavor to the sauce. We really enjoyed this pasta dish, Deanna.

I loves this recipe!  It came out soooo good.  I did a few changes - used roasted red pepper flavored olive oil, used twice as much garlic, used twice as many red peppers, and instead of regular tomatoe sause I used Classico Creations sun dried tomatoe.  I also simmered it all a little longer to make it thicker.  My husband loved it!  Thanks for the recipe, I'm definately passing it along to everyone!

I live in the Utica, NY area where Chicken Riggies are big, a Chicken Riggies Festival is being planned!  This recipe is great!  All my relatives loved it.  Some added hot peppers and olives just make it better.  I am gointo try others suggstions for fat free non dairy creamer.  Thanks to Deanna for sharing.

This dish is scrumptious!  It truly is restaurant quality.  I speed up the cooking time by combining the sherry and cream and simmering together for ten minutes. Leftovers don't look as appealing  as the oil tends to seperate, but then again there are rarely leftovers!

Everyone in my family loved it and with young children that is not always easy!  I lowered the fat by using fat-free non-dairy cream instead of heavy cream and reducing olive oil to 2T.  You can always thicken with cornstarch mixed with sherry at the end if necessary.

Personally I ended up with a pink, runny mess that could be considered a sauce with chunks of chicken in it. I didn't find it to be all that appetizing.

I was trying to use what I had in my pantry this week and this recipe popped up. Though I have to admit that my tomato sauce was canned, and I added fresh parsley and basil (my sauce was begging for green) - I otherwise followed the recipe. The guys loved it - an easy, yummy dinner with ingredients I almost always have on hand. Thanks!!

This dish is one of our favorites! Although, it is only for a rare occasion since it's so rich. Before frying, I dredge the chicken pieces thru some flour mixed w/a bit of salt & pepper. Also, add slices of black olives (when tossing in the peppers),if desired. Can also be made with shrimp instead of chicken!

I loved this recipe!!!  I had Chicken Riggies in a very popular restaurant here in Central NY and I have been dying to find the recipe.  Well, this is as good as it gets.  I make it a little spicier so before I add in the spice I take enough out for my son.

I tried this recipe once and found it too rich for me, but I tried making again the other night and changed it up a little bit by adding marsala instead of the sherry, I used mushrooms instead of sweet peppers and I only added the cream until I thought the taste was just right (about 1/2 of what was suggested). I also added some carmalized onions to it also and it tasted great!

This chicken dish was very good.  My husband and I loved it.  It was a little too gourmet tasting for my children.  I also cut back on the heavy cream and added red ground pepper to jazz it up.
The sauce will thicken after you let it cool down a bit.  I did add some Wonder sauce thickener to it after I added the cream.

This is a delicious dish, even if you substitute half-n-jhalf for the cream.  This is rich and elegant enough for a dinner party.  I might add some mushrooms next time as well.

Big hit!  I didn't have the sherry.  Used vinegar and water, w/ a little sugar and a small splash of vanilla instead.  Kids loved it.  Even the finicky one year old ate three helpings (for her, three bites is usually an accomplishment).  Will definitely make it again.

Prior to adding the cream, this was tasting great. I did increase tomato sauce to one cup. Started to add the cream - 1 pint is waaaayyy to much in my opinion. Once I realized it was overpowering the other ingredients, I stopped. Tried to reduce the sauce without much sucess. Unfortunalty the over abundance of cream took over the wonderful taste it had prior to adding. Next time I'll start with a cup of cream and add more if I think it needs it. My family thought this was very bland tasting. Will give it one more shot by tweaking it a bit.

This recipe was very good, but I had to tweak it a little for my personal preference.  The sauce seemed very runny so I added Parmesan Cheese to thicken it up.  We liked it so much that I added it to the recipe permanently.  Overall a good recipe that I will use again.

I think it would have been much better with shrimp instead of chicken.

My whole family loved this.  My husband called and said he would be home in 15 minutes and all I had out were 2 chicken breasts.  I ran to allrecipe.com and found the chicken riggies recipe.  It was done by the time he walked in the door.  When my son sat down he turned his plate upside down and said he wasn't going to eat it.  After 1 bite he asked if he could eat it all day!  It was a huge hit.

I first had this delicious dish at a bed & breakfast in upstate new york.  I altered the recipe by adding more sherry (3/4 cp), red pepper flakes (1/8 tsp), one diced jalapeno pepper, and 1/2 cp of parmesan cheese.  It made for a creamy and spicy delightful dish that my fiancee' loved (and he doesn't like pasta dishes).  I will definitely make this again.

While it was very good and will make the recipe again, I couldn't help but think that maybe it needed a little more garlic and another vegetable type ingredient such as zucchini or squash.

This was delicious.  I did use only half of the butter and cream and it still came out great.  This dish also reheats really well and was enjoyed just as much as a leftover.

Made last night and was very yummy!!!  Used precooked chicken so saved on prep time.  Used homemade speg sauce as well, but I"m sure would have tasted just as good w/ regular tomato sauce

This was absolutely delicious, but I didn't use nearly that much olive oil. I loved it!

This was an easy, inexpensive dish.  The flavor was very subtle.  I used less than a pint of cream and next time I would use even less.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I cut it in half, which, when I used Allrecipes conversion, wasn't quite perfect, but it was still delicious. I added some chicken stock to keep it from drying out. Note: when you cook your pasta al dente, it will absorb the cooking liquid, so you may want to leave your sauce a little runny. I served this with a side salad and homemade rolls. Hubby had seconds (and thirds).

Used fresh red pepper and fresh onion slices.  Added about 1/4 cup instant mashed potato flakes to thicken. Honey loved it, me too!

This was really good, though it needed a lot more salt.  I also added red pepper flakes to give the flavors a boost.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks!

I used just enough olive oil to saute the chicken and veggies, as well as plenty of garlic, some fresh peppers, and half & half instead of heavy cream.  Taking another reviewer's advice, I mixed a little bit of cornstarch with the sherry as a thickening agent.  This recipe could go from satisfactory to good with good sprinkling of red pepper flakes or a little bit of lemon juice.  It needed a little more pizazz.

In order to thicken the sauce, I found I had to cook this at a very rapid simmer. We enjoyed this and I think I would like it with shrimp even better. In that case I found make the sauce and then put in already cooked shrimp from the fish market in at the end.

Delicious and really easy! You need a solid 45 min to do this one but it's totally worth it! The only reason you need that much time is because the cooking is in stages, not because it is all that involved or complex. 

I made this recipe for just 2 people and still ended up using half of the adjusted cream amount so do what the other reviewers suggested, and add the cream slowly so you can see how thin/thick the sauce gets. 

I didn't have sherry and substituted vinegar and sugar instead. Also didn't have the peppers but added a dash of cracked red pepper and sliced green olives instead. Lastly, I only had spicy tomato sauce instead of fresh tomatoes and this proved delicious too! 

Definitely making this again! Served with spinach salad and warm garlic bread.

As someone who grew up in Central NY, I was excited to find this highly rated recipe. However, I was very disappointed with the results: very bland and the chicken was entirely over-cooked. You should never, ever simmer chicken for more than 20-30 minutes as the result will be grizzly, hard, dried-out, tasteless chicken.

I made it again, with revisions, and it was decadently delicious. I cut the olive oil and butter in half (couldn’t taste the difference), added an entire jar of roasted red peppers, 1 teaspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Topped with fresh parmesan cheese. Just lovely.

Very good meal.  Based on other reviews, I cooked the chicken separately so it wouldn't dry out and tossed it with the pasta and sauce at the end.

I love this recipe.  I made 1 change....I added flour to a plastic bag, added spices (including cayenne pepper) and chicken.  Then cooked the chicken....this also made the sauce a little thicker.

The chicken gets very dry if cooked for this entire time.  I saute the chicken, shallots, and garlic in olive oil and then add the peppers, sauce, sherry, and cream and cook it until it is thick enough for my taste.

By the time I simmered everything in the correct order and turned off my stove, the sauce was tasting really bland. However, once I let it sit for another 10 minutes (without heat) to thicken up and coat the rigatoni, all of a sudden these delicious flavors developed!

The taste was terrific. My kids went back for seconds and even thirds which is something they never do. I used penne and half and half with a little cornstarch to try and cut back on the fat. You could easily halve the oil and butter and have it cook beautifully. This serves more like 8. There are 5 of us and even with 3 kids eating with adult appetites we were left with almost half.

This was a huge hit at our house. Usually I have a 50% rate on anything guaranteed since 1/2 of my family will eat anything. This had a 100% which is not unheard of but more exclusive. I did not put in the sherry (we didnt have any on hand). I also used penne pasta the first time. Next I used rigatoni. The kids actually prefer penne so I will use that from now on. I saw other recipes that had actual alfreo sauce that was used in place of the cream. We dont like bottle alfredo sauce and my homemade is so rich this was not something we wanted to mix - so this recipe was perfect. We actually had company the third time I made this so I doubled it. They would have left with leftovers had there been any but they did leave with the recipe in hand. My kids will all fight over the leftovers on this recipe for sure.

We loved this recipe.  I do try to make all new reciepes as written but, I didn't have any shallots so I used red onion.  I didn't add the sherry either(I just don't like it).  I did add some mushrooms buttons and they were a nice addition.  After adding all the cream it was a bit runny, I tried to cook it down but it needed to be thickend a bit with corn starch.  After that it was perfect.  I will make this again and boy does it make enough, I bet at least 8 servings!
Thanks.

Good, but not great. I used fat free half & half to cut down on calories & fat, added cornstarch to thicken it up, and added crushed red pepper to give it a little kick. It still needed something. The flavors blend well together though, and the sauce is very smooth. It just needs some work.

This was really delicious! I used no butter, more garlic, onion instead of shallot, and fresh red peppers. I increased the sherry to 1/2 a cup (and it could use even more!), and I wish I hadn't added the cream. The sauce tasted better before the cream. Will definitely  make again with no cream.

I love this recipe. I am 10 miles east of Utica, so I have been introduced to several different types. I had introduced it to NC, Washington state and other places I have visited.
The only thing I did to make like easier was use regular onions & substitute sweet pepper with hot cherry peppers. I now have to make the recipe times 4 because my kids, my boyfriend and my nephews, etc. all like them so much.

I made half the recipe following instructions.  Everyone agreed that there was too much oil in this.  Thanks for sharing something for me to try;  just did not fit our tastes.

I thought this was a good recipe. Only thing I changed was to add about 1/4c. of shredded parm in the end. It thickened everything up and gave it a great flavor. I will make this again. Thanks.

Made some adjustments here due to what I had on hand....onion instead of shallot....totally omitted the sherry and subbed with some of the juice from the jar of sweet peppers. Also added some procuitto and leftover crisp bacon. Cavitappi pasta instead of the rigatoni.....what can I say....this way delicous with all the changes and add ons.....family loved it...served with salad. Thanks!

This recipe is delicious.  I personally like to add mushrooms and cherry peppers to mine for extra flavor.  I also found adding eight ounces of sauce works better too!  It can become somewhat runny towards the end but I just cook it a little longer till it reduces to the right consistantcy.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was good, but... I can only give it 3 stars. I decided to try this recipe this past weekend for no other reason than it sounded good (I've never heard of "riggies" nor was I aware that it is a popular upstate NY dish). I would make this again - only with several modifications. I enjoy red peppers, and would recommend adding more next time (an entire 12 oz. jar - I used up all of a 7.25 oz. jar this time b/c 4 oz. didn't seem to be enough...). I would also add less cream and more tomato sauce and maybe spice things up a bit with a some of the juice from the red peppers, red pepper flakes or halof a jar of spicy peppers (or, if I have some on hand, just use a 1/2 cup of my homemade arrabbiata sauce in lieu of the tomato sauce called for). I think I'd also add some fresh coppped basil for color/flavor. One thing to note... My sauce seemed runny, so I added 2 tsp. cornstarch to 4 tsp. water, mixed well, stirred into the skillet and brought  everything to a low boil to thicken. When tossed with the pasta, it was perfect! Served with garlic bread on the side, this makes for a very nice and filling meal. Thanks for sharing (even though my bf thinks "riggies" is a corny name for a pasta dish - hehe!!!!)!

This is a good Base recipe for Chicken Riggies. I have been making this for years. However, I do use fresh bell peppers and a couple of sliced peppers from the jar. I use 1/4c of the juice in the sauce, which makes it different from the others. If you end up with a runny mess then you either used the entire jar of peppers, including all the juices... or you used Margerine instead of Butter.  Margerine will make it a runny mess.  Add some tomato paste to thicken it up if you must. I also add mushrooms, onion wedges, and omit the olives.  Using diff flavored wine changes this also. Once made it with blackberry wine from arbor mist and ppl were begging for the recipe, asking what I did to it.  Enjoy and play around with the recipe, make it your own as I have done.

I decided to be unhealthy and use the heavy cream and boy am I glad I did! This was really good. The only change I made to the original recipe was to add some fresh mushrooms. Served it with a small Caesar salad and Texas toast. The whole family loved it!

So much fat and calories so you can't eat this all the time, but it is very good! The roasted bell peppers added lots of flavor and everyone loved  it!

Exellent Recipe however, I have made a few modifications. I use fresh peppers. red and yellow for color. I also include 3 or 4 jalipino peppers for some kick. Instead of the called for amount of marinara I use a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes or my favriot, Dom Peppinos

Very good...having never had Chicken Riggies before, I wasn't sure what to expect, but really enjoyed the pink sherry cream sauce (we love pink vodka sauce, and this was similar) combined with the peppers.  I did add both sweet red pepper strips as well as hot banana pepper rings.  Yummy!

I used shrimp instead of chicken, and just added it in at the last five minutes of cooking.
I also used half-and-half instead of heavy cream, letting it reduce for about 10-15 minutes on medium heat until thickened.
Both modifications worked out very well and have no effect on my rating.
However, authentic chicken riggies are supposed to be spicy! This had some flavor (although, granted, not much), but not the flavor any riggies I've had in upstate NY did. I dumped in half a bottle of hot sauce before I was satisfied.

This was a very good meal, awesome  flavor.  We did it low fat so we left out the cream sauce and butter.  We served it over asparagus which really gave it great color. Totally a do-again meal.

Having never heard of Chicken Riggies, I tried this recipe on faith. Outstanding! I followed it exactly (okay, I don't actually measure anything, but still...). There was more sauce than I expected, so I served it up in a bowl with a spoon. When I commented that I thought I would use less liquid next time, my husband said he liked it the way it was!

Very good. I used evaporated milk instead of cream.  I think next time I will substitute chicken broth for the sherry.  It left a funny after taste in my humble opnion.
