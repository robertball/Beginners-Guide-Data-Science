Husband loves catfish, and this recipe had a perfect combination of seasonings. The only thing I dislike about frying catfish is that it really stinks up my house. Other than that, this was great. Thanks!

I'm not a fish fan, but I make it once a week because it's a good protein and source of omega. That being said, I decided to give this a try. I used tilapia rather than catfish (I maybe the only TN native that can't stand catfish - LOL) and swapped the tsp of onion powder and 1/4 tsp garlic salt for 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion salt. 

I cooked the fish in a bit of garlic butter, squirted some lemon juice on top and sprinkled liberally with McCormick's Cajun seasoning while the fish was cooing.

This did not taste fishy at all! I'll be making this again.

Delicious spice mix that is perfect for catfish.  I didn't do this on the grill since it started pouring down rain so I prepared it on top of the stove.  I also sprinkled some of the seasoning mix on both sides of the fish.  I served this with greens (mustard&kale), potato salad, and cornbread. I will  make this again, and the spice mix is definitely a keeper.

Easy, fast and good.  I cooked on the cooktop in a cast iron skillet.  It didn't take as long as indicated to finish cooking - so I would say watch it and go with your gut.  Entire family loved it - will make again.

Very Good!!! Will make again, but will add a bit more garlic salt as I thought it needed a bit more.  Butter was good, just didn't add the full amount.

If you like catfish, it's a enjoyable recipe. If you don't like catfish, it's an okay recipe. Before you coat the fish in the bag, maybe you could sprinkle salt, pepper, lemon juice on the fish ahead of time and keep it in the fridge for a while to weaken the strong fish taste.

This coating for catfish is excellent.  I used olive oil instead of butter and it was perfect.  Thanks Traci!

Excellent recipe.  We used Halibut and it was very tasty, not fishy smelling and nicely flaky.  We served it with a side of creamed spinach and a trio of different shaped pasta.

i used this recipe when i found some frozen cod fillet's in the freezer. for being cheap fish, that was frozen, this turned out great. 

I cut the fish into strips, and didnt use a bag to shake them in, i used a bowl. i pressed them into the flour mix twice too. 

turned out great, wish i had done this with the better fish earlier this week.

It is very easy to get the heat too high and scorch the cornmeal/flour coating. Take care.

This was good, but I found the flavor lacking in punch. Next time I might add some lemon juice or fresh cilantro.

Excellent flavor! I didn't have onion powder so had to omit that. I also substituted white pepper for lemon pepper and added a 1/4 tsp of mustard powder. will be making again.

I used a different type of fish because the catfish prices were too high, but it was still really great.  I personally think the flavor might be better by frying in oil vs. butter.  Next time I think I'll try olive oil - I think this will make it a solid 5 star :)

My family loved this!  I made a double batch and every piece was eaten.  The only change I made was to use a non-stick pan on the stove instead of a skillett on the grill and I didn't cover the pan.

This was super impressive & easy to make. I didn't have cornmeal so I substituted corn starch & used extra virgin olive oil in lieu of butter. I also recommend squeezing a wedge of lemon over the fish after removing it from the skillet.

This made a nice breading.  Really didn't find it all that flavorful though.  I would cut back on the onion powder and boost of the other seasonings.  I also think frying in oil or at least adding some oil to the butter would be healthier and easier to fry in.

I thought the seasoning on this catfish was really good, but I didn't like the taste of how it cooked in the butter. Next time, I might try sautéing or frying the fish in some vegetable oil.

Wonderful flavor!  I omitted the white pepper only because I didn't have any, and it still tasted great.

Delicious!!  We're always looking for new ways to cook fish.  This had a nice "fried" taste but not the fat & grease.  My ONLY change I made was I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of butter for the healthy Omega 3.  We'll definitely fix this again.

I'm not quite sure what I did wrong, but I didn't think this fish had very much flavor at all.  I was afraid it was going to be too spicy with all the pepper but the only thing I left out (by accident) was the black pepper and it just seemed like it needed something else.  It looked very pretty but we had to add salt and lemon and it still was just okay.  I'll try again and maybe add some garlic or lemon.

I don't recall having ever had catfish before trying this recipe. My husband is from the South, and he LOOOOOVES catfish. I cut the basil down to about half and I omitted the white pepper. I only used a few grinds of pepper and two pinches of cayenne. He said it needed more cayenne, but I didn't want it too spicy for our daughter. I used three fillets totalling one pound and around two TBS each of butter and vegetable oil. The batter ended up pretty crusty, almost like if it had been deep-fried. He said it was pretty good (high praise coming from that fish-lover!) and my daughter and I enjoyed it too. Thanks for sharing, Traci!
