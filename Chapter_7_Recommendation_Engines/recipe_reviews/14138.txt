This is something I make almost weekly (sometimes more). It's really great for when all my veggies are starting to go bad. Very easy to customize...

I've made this soup several times now and we always enjoy it. The first time I followed the recipe exactly but now I change it up to suit what's in our fridge and pantry on any given day. But that's the beauty of this soup, it's very versatile. Quick and healthy :) Today I made it with corn and I also threw in some ABC noodles. Mykids love this soup! :)

Loved this as a low calorie, vegetarian, easy, filling  meal. Soups are great to tweak to personal taste. My personal taste is to use 3 carrots and 2 zucchini and 3 cloves of garlic. I also used macaroni alphabet pasta to entice my kids. DO NOT substitute anything for pearl onions, nothing else will do.

I made this recipe but used chicken broth and chicken bouillon.  I omitted the green beans because I didn’t have any.  And I used mini bow tie pasta and cooked it separately.  This was a nice vegetable soup and easy to throw together.  One can of kidney beans seemed a little sparse, so next time I’ll add a second can.  UPDATE 1/17/14:  I made this again as follows:  I used chicken broth and chicken bouillon as before, the tomatoes, 1 cup each of carrots, celery and pearl onions, no green beans, macaroni, or beans.  I used two zucchini and one yellow summer squash.  Great flavor and really low in calories!

Wonderful recipe and great for adapting to whatever veggies, beans or pasta you have on hand. I have made this 4 times now, and each time I play with ingredients following the basic recipe. Every time I have gotten great respnse from a very picky family!

I added 1 more carrot and 1 more celery. Hubby doesn't like pasta or beans in soup, so I substituted with 2 Yukon Gold potatoes. I  sauteed the carrots, celery and garlic with a little olive oil just until the garlic is fragrant. I used fresh green beans. Added some frozen sweet corn. A tiny pinch of dried oregano. Some s & p. I served it with grilled cheese sandwich. It was excellent!

I had to double the ingredients and STILL RAN OUT before everybody had their share; Next time 
I will have to quadruple the ingredients. Everybody went CRAZY over this recipe. Well done Jana Thornton!
I am planning on making this again this month for an Easter party with my best friend, her family, and my family together.

Excellent recipe!  I didn't have italian sausage so I substitued Kielbasa.  I also used chicken bouillon instead of vegetable broth.  Spiced up a little extra to my taste, and it was loved by all.  Thank you!

I love this recipe! I added more broth (32 oz) to use the whole container, which I think it really needed a little more liquid anyway. And used 28 oz can diced tomatoes because that's what I had. Didn't have macaroni so I used ziti. I probably cooked it about twice as long so the zucchini and ziti were more done. We will definitely be making this one again!

I added this to my recipe box a month or so ago and have already made it twice.  Vegetarians and carnivores both love it.  I added a large can of tomato sauce and an extra can of kidney beans. I omit the pearl onions and chop and sauté an onion with the celery, carrots, and some garlic in a bit of olive oil.   I leave out the zucchini just because I think it starts looking kinda sad on reheating the soup.  If your carnivores insist on meat, slice and cook some chicken sausage Italian sausage in another pan and them have them add it their bowls.

Very good, hearty soup.  I used Ditali pasta instead of macaroni and added more veggies such as cabbage, peas and broccoli.  It's so healthy and very filling, we all enjoyed it!  THX

Good base soup. 
Not sure if it was the fact that I double the quantity or that fact that I used reduce/sodium-free canned ingredients (where asked for), but I found it to be rather bland. I double, in some cases tripled the herbs/spices, to get some of the flavors to pop out. Overall, soup was a success both at home and in the office.

When I make this I end up eating it for breakfast the next day too! Make it healthy by using organic beef and vegetable stock and organic crushed tomatoes, and fresh veggies. I skipped the carrots, celery, and noodles and used zucchini and yellow squash. I also substituted the kidney beans for cannallini beans or lentils (just a few). Also I had fresh rosemary on hand so that worked nicely when chopped up really small. One of my favorite soups!

This was soup was meh. I substituted fresh tomatoes and green beans since I try to use canned food as little as possible. Regardless, it was nothing special.

I'd have to say this is the best Vegetarian soup that I have made yet. The only thing I did different was leave out the zucchinis because we didn't have any left. We had seconds! Next time, I'll be adding more noodles (I love noodles) and only half a can of beans. The soup kept very well and even better the next day. Thank you for this recipe!

Tasty! The only reason I didn't give it four was because it did not keep well, which is half the reason I make soup. Very good when we made it though.

I used dried cheese ravioli in place of the macaroni.  Also used dehydrated onion and garlic.  Very good, very easy, though nothing spectacular.

Quick and easy meal on cold winter nights.  This recipe is very forgiving, so I just add what ever veggies I have  on hand and double the beans for protein.

LOVED this soup, I modified it though, with what I had on hand. Since I had a busy day ahead, I threw all ingredients in the crock pot. I used beef broth instead of vegetable broth. Also, I didn't add kidney beans, as my husband doesn't care for them. Otherwise, everything else I added as directed. I added elbow macaroni an hour before serving. We had a salad and dinner rolls hot out of the oven to complete the meal. There is plenty leftover to have again tonight.

My family loved this soup!  I used vegetable bouillon cubes & 12 cups of water to make my own broth in a crock pot.  Some things I substituted, like I used whole peeled tomatoes cut up, a can of tomato sauce, fresh green beans, a whole yellow onion cut into quarters, & italian seasoning.  I did not use macaroni, but later I added some ground beef & barley and it was incredibly delicious & healthy.  I make this often & the family loves to snack on it.

I tripled the recipe. Had too much zucchini in it for me.
Will certainly make it again but will use less zucchini.

This soup is good,while it was simmering I tasted it and found it a bit bland. I did not use the pearl onions, I used a yellow onion, chopped, I upped the garlic also to 4 cloves. I make my own broth so I used that.Also used fresh parsley and basil, had them here.I also added chopped turnip as it needed using.
 I also added some Worchester sauce which bumped up the flavour bit. Also added some salt and pepper.The soup is very versatile any vegetable will really work. Thank you for the recipe

Very good, easy to make, and overall delicious. However, I felt it was heavy on tomatoes and would reduce the amount or add more vegetable stock. Let's just say I kept wanting a grilled cheese sandwich with this soup as written. This is a very versatile recipe to add other veggies or seasonings to your liking. Will make again with some minor adjustments. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Delicious! Omitted the pearl onions and kidney beans, and added peas and corn. Will definitely make again, although I might add cubed potatoes and omit the zucchini as I'm not a huge fan. I love this recipe because you can use whatever you happen to have on hand and it still turns out great. Great recipe.

This batch made 8 servings for our dinners! It was delicious served with hot bread. Very easy to make. I will definitely make it again. I froze the other 6 servings as I look forward to using it when I am rushed or someone shows up unexpectedly.

We wanted a basic vegetable soup to have as a starter, with a focus on vegetables and not additional calories, so made without beans or macaroni.  Turned out great, just what we were looking for!

I loved it.  I put a few slices of chopped deli ham in and fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  A pinch of red pepper flakes & dried jalapeños for kick. A very adaptable recipe.

This was quite good soup but I didn't realize it would be so tomato-y. It was basically tomato vegetable soup and that's not what I was looking for. However it turned out really good, was extremely easy to make and hubby loved it.  It made way too much for just one meal and he did not love it enough to eat it for lunch so it was wasted but still, a very good soup for those who like tomato soup with a lot of healthy veggies.

This was my first time making soup, and it was delicious! I opted for yellow onion instead of pearl, used fresh parsley, used bow-tie pasta, and added in canned corn and canned green beans. I also used some oregano to spice it as well, and had to use a chicken boullion cube instead of vegetable boullion because that was all I had. I will definately make this again, thank you!!

This was very good, I added some chopped zucchini at the end and a can of corn but omitted the green beans. I added too much pasta though, I added almost a cup because I like a lot of pasta but I should have added more broth but I didn't have any!
