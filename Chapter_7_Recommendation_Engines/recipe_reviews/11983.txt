Pretty good, although I like my moms recipe better...Even amounts of cream cheese and mashed potatos (potatos should be a little more dry than creamy to prevent runniness), salt,pepper. Add the cream cheese to potatos to avoid making mixture to thin. When pieogis are prepared, they should be browned over butter and onions for an authentic Polish dish...Yum.

This was very easy and very good.  I halved the pierogi recipe but the amounts listed in the recipe for the filling looked to be quite a lot so I adjusted.  I ended up using 4 small/medium potatoes to make the mashed potatoes.  I threw in a couple cloves of garlic while the potatoes were boiling and mashed them also.  I added 8-12 ounces cheddar (we like it cheesy) and 2-3 ounces cream cheese to the mashed potatoes.  This ended up being the perfect amount for 36 three inch round pierogies.

Good recipe, I added a little green onion to it just to give it that extra "oomph".  Good consistency for filling the pierogies, easy to handle and it cooks nicely.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Awesome filling. I wasn't sure how much was 1lb of cheese and 4lbs of potato so I winged it. I added the cheese while the potatoes were still warm until the potatoes seemed sufficiently cheesy, then added in real bacon that I chopped up. I didn't even need salt or pepper. Very tasty filling.

I used 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 medium cheddar. They were perfect - just like grandma used to make.

I added sauteed onions, mushrooms and green peppers to the mashed potatoes, and I used Emmenthaler (a Swiss cheese) instead of Cheddar. The result was fabulous!

This is similar to what I make but it is extremely good with 1 cup chopped onion sauted in margarine or butter then add it and the shredded cheese to the potatoes and mash together, let cool before using to fill the perogies.

I find this to be an extremely dry, uninspired and flavorless perogi filling.    You should first boil the potatoes, then mash them and add the cheese while mashing to help melt the mixture together.  The mixture should become orange and hold itself together. Add 1 cup of sourcream, 4 cups of finely chopped cooked onion and  2 cups of finely chopped cooked bacon.  Place inside perogi/pierogi dough, boil and freeze.  Secret tip: add a small amount of the potato mixture to the dough to help them hold together while cooking.

Tasted bland inside the pierogies, but great on its own.  I will double the cheese if I make this again.
UPDATE:  I did make this again with doubled cheese and garlic powder.  MUCH better flavor within pierogies.

The perfect filling for Pierogi.  Very easy to prepare and fill.  Tastiest when Pierogi are fried.

I make the dough using the starchy potato water. It makes the dough very user friendly, not too springy, just right. I have been making periogies for 20 years and have found that the boiled potato water is the best for making the dough. I also add garlic powder, onion powder, dry curd cottage cheese (one full container), and aged sharp cheese to the filling to add a little different flavor. This is a real hit and a family tradition for the holidays. 
Cheers!

Just having potato filling makes it a little dry.  I made a yummy cheddar alfredo sause to pour over the top.  It added a lot more flavor and kept the pasta moist.  I know it's not the traditional way to eat pierogis...but it was goooood.

I modified it a little, first, I did use the full recipe, however  I added 1/4 tsp. white pepper, 1/2 tsp. onions salt, and a tbs. of extra virgin olive oil to the potato mixture. I found the mixture as it was originally a tad bland and a bit dry.

I've been making these since I was a teen. My hubby never tasted them until I made them for him when we first got together. Now we both can't wait until we get a bigger apartment that has more counter space so that I can start making them again.

Per other reviews, I added a caramelized onion, drained, and some garlic powder to this. It was still way too bland. There was way too much, as well. The dough recipe made over 5 dozen and only used half this filling. I think if you used 2 pounds of potatoes, and kept the rest the same, it would be just right. With more garlic powder and more butter, the leftovers made decent mashed potatoes.
