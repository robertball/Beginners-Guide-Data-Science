I made this and it was a big hit!  I altered the recipe slightly.  I used fresh broccoli, and added sliced green onions with the red bell peppers.  After pouring off the bacon drippings, I sauteed veggies in same pan.  Then, instead of spreading cream cheese on croissant dough (that idea seemed difficult), I stirred the crisp tender veggies with the cream cheese.  Finally, before serving I placed a plate of strawberries in center of wreath.  Christmas-y colors, indeed!

sounds good and easy--going to give it a try for the holiday season--might add a dip in the middle.

This was a big hit for my Christmas party. People loved the creamy taste with the croissant saltiness. 

I did alter the recipe a little for taste / calorie content. I did light herb & garlic cream cheese, frozen spinach instead of broccoli, and didn't add the bacon or sesame seeds.

I'm a little late for my review, however, I took this dish to a Christmas dinner at my sister's house.  She had approximately 15 people over for dinner.  All I could say is that I wish I made more than 1 of these wreath's!!!  It was a huge success and everyone raved all evening about it!  Thanks for the recipe...this is certainly a keeper!!

I made this with substitutions. I used a puff pastry, omitted the broccoli, added roasted garlic, roasted red pepper and herbs. Turned out pretty amazing and is being requested over and over.
