Everytime I make this cake for a morning meeting at work, it gets rave reviews.  I make a few changes though.  I make mine in a bundt pan.  I sprinkle some of the topping on the bottom of the pan and then put in some of the batter and then sprinkle some more topping and then more batter and then top with the rest of the topping.  It makes a beautiful presentation.

I've made this recipe before, with some substitutions.  I am only rating it 2 stars, hoping to draw attention to my review, because at the risk of sounding presumptuous, I think it may help lessen some of the negative reviews, following this one, in the long run .  I have made this cake once and, somehow, despite several substitutions, it turned out beautifully.  It is a very good recipe.  HOWEVER, here is a BIG ISSUE:  Presumably, due to our current economic woes, manufacturers of cake mixes have begun cutting back on the amount of mix that was standard for most cake mixes, the 18.25 oz., such as this recipe and many other recipes call for.  And they have instead reduced the actual amount in their boxes to 15.25 ounces.  Word has it they are adding in just enough leavening ingredients to make the cakes manifest to the same size, but which produces a cake much different than the way it would have turned out, had consumers been aware of the changes.  And the boxes themselves aren't that much smaller, thus fooling the average consumer into thinking they are still getting the same amount of cake mix for the same price.  Since this recipe calls for an 18.25 oz. box of mix, double-check that the mix you get is the same amount.  Otherwise, recipes that would normally work, won't, unless adjusted.  Some premium brand mixes still make mixes in the 18.25 oz. size, as well as some generic brands, or so I've heard.  But just thought I'd interject this info, if it helps. Anyway, 5 stars!

This is a wonderful cake!!! I thought it tasted very similar to a honey bun, my husband thought it tasted like a coffee cake but we both thought it was awesome!  Extremely moist and tasted great.  I did make a few substitutions.  I made the cake batter from scratch (2 1/3 c. flour, 1 tbl. baking powder, 3/4 tsp. salt, 1 1/2 c. white sugar & 1/2 c. shortening.  Sift together dry ing. & add shortening until crumbly in nature.  Then follow the recipe as is).  Added 1 tsp of vanilla & 1/2 tsp of brandy extract to the batter.  Reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cups.  Halved the icing & added 1/4 tsp of brandy extract to that, as well.  I'm not big on glaze & only ended up using about 3/4 of what I made.  I served it warm & ended up eating seconds which I never do.  It was easy to make & I loved the taste.  This is the cake to make when you're craving something sweet & satisfying.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This cake tastes like one giant cinnamon roll.  It is REALLY good.  The presentation is also beautiful (I also made mine in a greased and floured bundt pan -- which I highly recommend).  The baking time is the same for both pans.  However, you will have about twice as much glaze as you need if you use a bundt pan.

Perfectly delicious, however, not very pretty. I'm a teacher who LOVES to bake, and I'm known around my school for being a great baker.:-)  I made this cake for my administrator who just had a baby...you know, my boss who I really want to impress.:-) It wasn't quite done at 40 minutes, so it needs longer to cook. I baked it in a 9x13 glass dish.  This cake would likely be much prettier in a bundt pan, so I will try that next time.  Its taste is to DIE for, even with the full cup of brown sugar.  Wow!  Serve it warm with ice cream and oh my, you have yourself an exquisite dessert.  Pretty, no, so probably not a cake you'd want to take to someone you were trying to really impress.  Delicious, heck yes, so I guess it depends on your audience.  Good luck! Ally

I made this cake the other day..  my husband and i LOVED it.  i made it a bit more low fat by playing around with the ingedients.  i used 4 ounces sour cream, a little motts container of applesauce and a low fat vanilla pudding cup to make up for the 4 ounces of missing sour cream.  i also left out the vegetable oil. 
(i like to experiment when i cook :) )
it turned out wonderful..  its a moist wet cake.. the brown sugar in the middle was definatly what made it yummy!

This is a classic cake recipe that has been around for many years. It has stood the test of time simply because it's that good, that easy, and makes your kitchen smell wonderful too. A tried and true cake that I know good cooks will still be making for years to come.

Where I come from in Mississippi, this is called a "Sock It to Me" cake.  It is divine, and so unbelievably easy!  My husband asks for it every year on his birthday (and several times a year between birthdays!)  You WILL NOT regret making this cake!!

One word describes this cake--heavenly.  I've made the cake twice so far.  The first time I followed the recipe.  The second time I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 3/4 cup instead of 1 whole cup.  It was still enough to cover the cake but it didn't make it overly sweet.

I have taken this cake to work twice and got tons of raves, plus no left-overs!  Have been asked over and over for the recipe.  Thanks!  This one's a keeper!
Note:  Don't get the cake mix that has "pudding in the mix".  I made that mistake, and did not get the rave reviews that I was used to.  Just get plain ol' yellow cake mix.

This is the most amazing cake I've ever had, no exaggeration! Keep all the ingredients and amounts exactly as the recipe says. I used a cake mix in a box that was a couple of ounces less than the recipe said and only had "light" sour cream but it still turned out amazing!!! Melted in your mouth. The 40 minutes was perfection, the outside got the slightest bit crispy and the inside was melt in your mouth moise so when you bite into it the textures are wonderful together. Don't short the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture even though the layer looks crazy thick, this is where the flavor comes from. I took some of the extra cinnamon/brown sugar mixture and sprinkled it on the top of the bundt cake (which when you flip it will become the bottom of the cake). This was a great idea, as the sugar melted and made this fabulous, light, crispy, sweet crustlike layer on bottom. This cake didn't last 3 days in our home, it was a huge hit! I would rename it "Cinnamon Bun Cake" because it reminds me of a Pillsbury cinnamon roll much more than a honey bun. Thanks for sharing this, it is a new family favorite!

I think this cake is sometimes called Sock-it-to-me or at least it's a very close recipe.  Anyways, this cake is THE BEST.  I added chocolate chips to the cinnamon layer the second time I made it and it was to die for.  I also made the glaze with 3 tbs of butter.  I warmed butter, confec. sugar and vanilla on the stove and then poured it on top.  It is SO good that way.  I made it in a one of those cute, sunflower bundt pans-a great thing to bring to someone's house.

Very good cake it disappeared in minutes when I took it to work. I made a few adjustments though. I did not use all of the brown sugar it just seemed like too much, I used only about 3/4 cup as opposed to 1 cup. I also frosted it with Clone a Cinnabon cream cheese frosting I found on this site! Overall an easy delicious cake!

We loved this cake! Thanks to the other reviewers, cut the brown sugar by half and also, reduced the "topping" by half.  Perfect amt of sweet and very moist and fluffy...almost like an actual honey bun. Will keep this recipe around for future use! Thanks Jennifer!

Scrumptious!! I made it a bit "lighter" by using 3/4 cup apple sauce in place of the oil and I used fat free sour cream. It was devoured at a family gathering. I think the apple sauce works perfectly with the cinnamon in this cake. But whether you use my lighter version or the original recipe (which I've had when my sister made it "by the book" for a game night we had last week) it's truly delicious and a crowd pleaser.

This is a new family favorite.  It's great for any meal of the day!  I found it helps to use just under 1/2 of the batter for the bottom layer so that you have extra batter to go on top of the brown sugar/cinnamon layer.

Wow...this was terrific.  I added some chopped walnuts to the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture and used 2 sticks of butter rather than the vegetable oil.  Betty Crocker has a honey bun recipe on the back of her "Butter Recipe Yellow" cake box...so I used ideas from both recipes and produced a delicious cake. My batter was SO thick it was almost impossible for me to spread half the batter on the bottom, so I dumped it all into the pan and sprinkled the brown sugar mixture on top and swirled it with a knife. This also had a slight cinnamon roll taste to it.  I will definitley be making this again.  Oh..and I doubled the icing.  Great recipe Jennifer.

Great recipe!  I followed another reviewers (CaleyCat) suggestion and made the "cake mix" from scratch, as I don't typically have cake mixes on hand. (2 1/3 c. flour, 1 tbl. baking powder, 3/4 tsp. salt, 1 1/2 c. white sugar & 1/2 c. shortening. Sift together dry ing. & add shortening until crumbly in nature. Then follow the recipe as is).  I subbed natural yogurt for the sour cream (that's what I had available).  Very nice cake.  Extra special with it's warm!  Don't forget the icing!

First time making this and took to Thanksgiving gathering.  It was a HUGE HIT! As others suggested, I used cinnabon frosting & baked in bundt pan.  The aroma is incredible as it bakes.  Make it & have a cup of coffee ready when it comes out of the oven.  Thank you!

I grew up eating honey buns so I had to try this cake. Wow it was not only simple to make but very very good and really moist. I only change one thing and that was I used buttermilk instead of sour cream, because that was what I had, next time I will use sour cream to see if there is any difference, and let me say it can be a little sweet but you can control that with the amount of glaze you use, As for me I love sweet, 5 stars plus more a must try!!!!!. Update!!!!!  This cake was so good I had to make another one two days later for my daughter and family. Came out as great as the first, try adding nuts. UPDATE!!!! I MADE THIS CAKE AGAIN FOR EASTER AND THIS TIME I USED THE ICING FROM THE CLONE OF A CINNABON RECIPE FROM THIS SITE. WOW IT WAS A BIGGER HIT I THINK THE CREAM CHEESE CUT DOWN ON SOME OF THE SWEETNESS OF THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE CAKE.

Great cake, very moist and sweet!  My husband and I enjoy sweets, but try to eat healthy, so I made some changes.  I used fat free sour cream, cut out one egg and used 1/2 C applesauce and 1/4 C oil (instead of 3/4 C oil).  It was very good.  I too used a bundt pan and next time would reduce the brown sugar/cinnamon and the frosting by half to cut more calories.  Thanks for the recipe!

The cake is the star here and the magic is in the brown sugar/cinnamon filling.  I've made this one several times now and it just keeps getting better.  I've made it with all the icing, half the icing and no icing at all.  On that occasion I dusted the top with some confectioner's sugar with a little cinnamon added.  Any way you top this cake, it's delicious.  For those whose don't think this tastes like a honey bun, pehaps this recipe ought to be called cinnamon bun cake.

My printer was out of ink the night I found this recipe so I wrote it out by hand. I mistakely wrote 8 oz of cream cheese instead of sour cream and this cake was amazing. Taste better if it is made a day ahead and the icing soaks into the cake. Great recipe. Will try it with sour cream one day.

THIS CAKE IS EXCELLENT, AND SO EASY TO MAKE. AFTER READING REVIEWS, I ALMOST USED 1/2C. BROWN SUGAR. I'M GLAD I FOLLOWED RECIPE EXACTLY, IT CAME OUT WONDERFUL. I BAKED IT EARLY AND TOOK IT TO WORK STILL WARM. THEY LOVED IT! YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEIR FACES WHEN I TOLD THEM IT WAS MADE FROM A MIX. THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ME AT FIRST. I WILL BE MAKING THIS OFTEN. THANKS, JENNIFER FOR THIS WONDERFUL RECIPE.

Tasty. I used a butter-flavored cake mix and used butter instead of veg. oil. It was well-received but it is more like a coffee cake than a dessert.

I have now made this twice in three days.  The first time I made it exactly according to the recipe in a bundt pan.  I did not have any difficulties as did previous reviewers with it being too moist.  I brought it to a function at work and my coworkers referred to it as the "evil cake"- evil for diets and waistlines that is!  I did find it to be too sweet however.  It tasted like the cake mix.  The second time I made it I substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and applesauce for the 1/2 the oil.  I also reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  My 3 year old said it tasted like monkey bread!  Will be making it again for it's convenience and versatility.  Think next time I may try with blueberries!

Very easy and very tasty.  Some cake mix cakes taste like cake mix, but this one does not.  It was very well received at a church potluck.  I will make this again and again.

MMM... delicious. This cake came out moist and nicely dense. I did add vanilla for extra flavor and used Butter cake mix.
Instead of making one big cake, I made small cupcake/muffin ones. Put one heaping TBSP of batter, then 1 TBSP of sugar mix and topped with another "small" TBSP of batter. The top TBSP I just dropped on and did not spread to cover the sugar. It added to the presentation. Baked 27 min. The edges were slightly crispy and the centers soft and moist. I added chopped nuts to the sugar mixture which was a nice touch. I received high remarks from everyone who tasted it.

I was a little concerned when I read some of the reviews about the cake not working out for them.  I followed the recipe exactly and cooked in a bundt pan.  I cooked for a total of 55 minutes and it was cooked to perfection.  I did not make the icing as I just used a sprinkling of conf. sugar.  Not sure if this tastes anything like a Honey Bun cake as I have never had one, but the cake was very enjoyable although rather on the sweet side.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving, and everyone said it was better than the pecan pie! This cake was great, I havent' had a honey bun in awhile, but everyone said it tasted just like them! The cake was so moist and light. I baked it in a bundt pan for only 45 minutes, and it came out great. Any longer than that would have been overcooked. I only made half the icing, and it was a great amount. Three days later and this cake is still moist and yummy:)
It's totally worth trying!

I would like to thank one of the reviewers “CaleyCat” for giving a substitute recipe for the cake mix. I followed her instructions, it came out perfect.
I baked it in a bundt pan , added the filling into 2 layers, no need to swirl,  it needs 60 minutes at 325 degrees, looks good,  tastes wonderful.

I have been making this cake for so long, that I just have to write a review.. :)
It is the best cake ever.. we make it whenever someone is coming over and it is asked for over and over again.. I don't do the powder sugar glaze on top anymore, I use Pillsbury frosting vanilla or cream cheese flavor melted in the microwave and pour that on top.. It is just a slice of heaven...

I just made this cake for Christmas dinner and everyone LOVED it...even my husband, who typically doesn't like cream cheese. I used a different frosting recipe. The batter was a lot thicker than expected, and I did a sheet cake. It was a little hard to spread the second layer of cake after I did the brown sugar cinnamon mixture. I think it would be a lot easier in a bundt pan, and next time I'll do that, but it was delicious!

DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT attempt to make this cake in a bunt pan as the picture would suggest.  I was extremely careful and the cake still fell apart in the middle where the sugar layer is.  Terrible waste of time and ingredients.

TIP:  Make sure you mix BY HAND.  I've made this several times and it always comes out great EXCEPT FOR THE TIME I was in a hurry, didn't read the directions and used a hand mixer.  For some reason, it took an extra 20-30  minutes to bake and the texture just wasn't right.  Not sure how the difference in mixing affects the finished product, but it really does! TRUST ME!


So yummy and so easy.  A great way to take a plain cake mix and make it extraordinary!  My hubby said this was one of the best cakes he's ever had.  We couldn't leave it alone.  Delicious right from the oven or even better the next day -- the glaze has time to soak in and make this super moist.  I followed the recipe exactly (used a Duncan Hines Butter Recipe mix because that's all I had).  If you use a Bundt pan like I did make sure you grease the pan.  Mine stuck and I had to piece it back together -- as a result it wasn't the best looking cake but it definitely didn't keep it from being gobbled up in record time! Some other reviewers suggested cutting the glaze in half for a Bundt cake.  I used the full recipe and was glad I did.  Yummy!  I wish we hadn't demolished the whole thing...I could go for another piece right now.

Fun to make and the swirl was pretty.  My husband said "wow."  The icing is too thin, so I recommend either less milk or more powdered sugar, also only 1 tsp vanilla (it's expensive!).  Also, best to drizzle the icing over the top or else it will get mixed up with the cinnamon-sugar.  The cake was perfect.

this came out perfect, the only suggestion I heeded was to cut back on the brown sugar mixture.  I went to 3/4 of a cup but forgot to cut the cinnamon back.  It came out perfect.  I bet this could be doubled easy and baked in a large lasagna pan.  I used the icing from the recipe.  It wasn't pretty, but it tasted right with the cake

Wow, so good.  I did not add the glaze because I felt the cake was sweet and yummy enough without it.  Used cheap yellow cake mix and light sour cream.

Made this in a bundt cake pan.  Make sure you let it cool 15-20 minutes before trying to flip it over out of the pan!  Otherwise, the bottom layer will stick in the pan!  Also, you can definitely get by with using less brown sugar/cinnamon and less glaze.  About half is needed!

My son LOVED this. He said it tasted similar to, but much better than, the Little Debbie honey buns I used to buy when he was a kid. The only change I made was to decrease the amount of oil by a couple tablespoons because the cake mix I used was only 16.5 ounces (the new size). I also decreased the amount of powdered sugar to 1-1/2 cup and used only 3 tablespoons milk. I used the whole 1 tablespoon of vanilla, but I would cut back on the vanilla to 1 or 2 teaspoons the next time I make this, especially since I use less powdered sugar. My oven bakes everything fast, so my cake was perfectly done in 28 minutes, but 40 minutes seems long. I would recommend starting to test the cake at 30 minutes.

I made two of these for Mother's Day and followed the directions closely.  I made one in a 9X13 pan and one in a Bundt pan.  They were both so easy to put together, baked up perfectly, and Mama, Mama-in-law, and everyone else raved about it.  Next time I will cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, but no one complained and it was gobbled up.   Great, simple recipe.  I'll be making this again for sure!

This is EXCELLENT! Friends dropped in unexpectedly for morning coffee, and I didn't have anything in the house to offer them, so I stirred this up. It was so fast and easy-- and so good! I cut the brown sugar down to three-quarters of a cup as other reviewers suggested, and only made half the frosting because I thought the cake would be sweet enough. Everyone raved. One friend said it was like something from an expensive bakery, which it was. I'll make this again. I'd give it ten stars if possible!

This was one of my Mom's favorite cakes to make--this is a really good recipe but next time I'll cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 or 3/4 cup and either half the glaze or try the cinnabon icing recipe.  I'm an extreme sweet lover but this one was a little too sweet even for me without the changes mentioned. My cake was great and very moist but about half the height of a normal cake--did use a bundt pan which I like better than the 9 x 13 pan I've used in the past.

Everyone loved this cake.  Unfortunately, I used dark brown sugar though.  Next time I will use regular brown sugar.

Very good cake.  I made according to directions except I used 6 oz. plain yogurt and 2 oz. Sour Cream because that's all the sour cream I had.  The cake didn't rise much but it was very tasty.  Next time I'll use a bundt pan because I think it would be better that way presentation wise.  This will be great for a potluck.  Thanks Jennifer for the recipe.

Wow! This came out so well! I made a few changes, though; instead of using a box cake mix, I made my own. I took about a 3rd of the brown sugar/cinnamon combination and sprinkled it on top. It made an excellent crunchy and crumbly topping.

Look, I'm giving this 5 stars because I know it would have turned out fantastic if I had just used a regular metal bundt pan instead of a stupid silcone bundt pan.  This was another attempt to win my in-laws over.  I made it so they could slice off a piece before an early morning function the following day, but sadly the cake didn't make it through the night.  It smelled delicious while cooking and when I saw them the following morning, they confirmed my suspicions that it was wonderful tasting.  Because of that stupid silicone, it wook nearly twice as long to back and looked a bit slimy in some spots (thank goodness for icing, right!?)

This was pretty good the first time I made it, but next time I cut the brown sugar in half and put a layer of mini-marshmallows in the middle.  I couldn't believe what a difference this made.  I also added finely chopped nuts on top before cooking.  The frosting is better made with water instead of milk - allows for transparency to view the cinnamon!

I am NOT a baker, but this turned out despite my baking handicap!  I followed the recipe to the T, measurements and all- it wasn't the prettiest cake I've seen, but it pleased a crowd of 14 including my husband who doesn't have a huge sweet tooth (yeah right)!

Perfect. Just make sure you wait until the cake is cool before drizzling the icing on. Otherwise it soaks into the cake...Still tastes delicious, though

This cake is awesome. I made it to bring to a freinds house for Christmas Eve and it was a hit. With the glaze on it it does taste similar to a honey bun or more like a cinnamon glazed donut. I will definately make this cake again.

This cake is just out of the oven and looks great.  I made two 9 inch square pans and the proportions were perfect.  Be careful though, it went from still wet in the center, to firm and brown in just 5-6 minutes (as box cakes can do).  I had a timer set to check things halfway thru the baking and if I hadn't checked on it early, it would have been too brown.

Couldn't decide if this was a 4 or 5 star... my husband gave it a 5, for me it was a 4 just based on preference.  The one recommendation - don't bother with the frosting... the cake is plenty sweet without the frosting.

Very good.  Only modifications I made were to bake it in a bundt pan for 45-50 minutes, and I used less glaze than was called for.  Very good and will definitely make this again!

This is a very tasty cake, though I made some alterations after reading comments: I used my Kitchenaid to mix the eggs, oil and sour cream, then I stirred in the cake mix. (I find it is too easy to over-mix when the eggs and wet ingredients aren't fully blended)I also added 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs and 1/4 cup melted butter to the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. I used a lightly greased bundt pan and placed 1/3 of the batter in the bottom followed by half of the cinnamon mixture; another 1/3 cake batter and then the secong half of the cinnamon mixture - I swirled this somewhat with a wooden skewer, then I topped it off with the remainder of the batter. I baked it for 45-50 minutes and allowed it to settle for three minutes before I removed it from the pan. I came out easily and looked great. I served it as is - no need for any glaze or frosting when the cinnamon is integrated well into the cake. This is the first cake that I made with a mix in which the cake mix is undetectable in my opinion. The addition of the butter and graham crackers made this a more complex and richer cake, so I was able to serve this up in smaller pieces which were every bit as satisfying as a larger piece of cake. I was a little hesitant to serve a box cake at a social gathering, but it was literally devoured before any of the other desserts. This is definitaly a winner!

This is a good cake, read the reviews of others and decided to make minor changes.  I only used half a cup of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I also changed the glaze only because it did not taste right.  I used 2 cups confectioners sugar, 3 tbls milk and 1 tsp of vanilla.  With those changes the cake was great, but more like a coffee cake with glaze.   All in all I will make this again, its an easy recipe.

A co-worker brings this cake to work all of the time but has been reluctant to share her recipe. That gave me the determination to find the recipe for myself. I made it for the first time today and i must say that it is very delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe stated with one variation. I added Jello Vanilla pudding to the mix just like I do when I'm making a regular cake. It makes it really moist. All in all this is definitely a cake that I will be making again and I would highly recommend it to others. I admit that it is REALLY sweet so be careful if you are a diabetic.

this cake is wonderful.  I have been making it for years and lost the recipe!  When I make it and I mix the brown sugar and cinnamon in with the cake instead of in the middle and it's a christmas/birthday tradition in my house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My cake turned out delicious, but to me it tasted more like a cinnamon roll than a honey bun. I made it low-fat using fat free sour cream, egg subst., and non-sweetened applesauce in place of the oil (the way I do all cakes).

Great cake, although I  don't  eat  it ( I  follow a low carb lifestyle)  my "sweet eaters"  LOVED the  cake.  My 12 yr old  daughter says it tastes better than honey buns. My only suggestion would  be to use slightly less than half the batter on the  bottom as the top is hard to cover without enough batter and I added 2 tbsps melted butter and a tsp of cinnamon to the frosting (glaze)

Delish! Followed the instructions exactly. batter is a bit goopy, and somewhat challenging to layer because it sticks to the cinnamon mixture. No biggie. Just swirl the hell out of it and it will come out fine! It was a big, big hit- next best thing to Cinnabon itself  ;-)

My five stars come from the combination of ease of preparation and delight of consumption! It's not a fancy dish, for sure, but it is the sort of thing you could serve to a crowd without worrying about pickiness interfering. I was a little concerned when trying to "swirl" the layers, as nothing as elegant as a swirl was made. The wet batter and dry brown sugar mixture did not get along too well, but I did my best with the knowledge that icing could cover whatever was ugly. I ended up having to use a can of cream cheese frosting from the store and it was a great complement. The cake looked great cut because of the swirls, and at our recent holiday luncheon mine was the only dessert that was completely gone at the end--success! This is a good (and super-quick) go-to recipe for informal occasions.

Ohhhhhhhhhhh...this cake will melt your teeth with sweetness, but who cares? It's delicious! I am normally leary of recipes that begin with a cake mix because I can still detect that "mix" taste in the finished product, but I didn't in this. My only change was to add 1/4 teaspoon of rum flavoring to the batter, the hint of it "makes" the honey bun flavor I think.

I really adored this. It was Easter evening....we had a huge, wonderful dinner & I totally FORGOT dessert. I had all the ingredients for this cake & literally threw it together. It was GREAT. We loved the coffee cake-like flavor...bursting with cinnamon. I didn't "swirl" but left a nice thick layer of the cinnamon sugar to caramelize throughout. Even better as it cools, this cake was a winner with coffee or tea. Will make again when a mix cake in in order. Thanks so much for this : )

Delicious & very easy to make!  A perfect treat to bring to the office...not a morsel will remain!  I made this almost the same, but prepared the "filling" a bit differently.  I pour all of the cake batter into the pan & sprinkle the cinnamon & brown sugar over top of the cake, in addition to drizzling 1/4 cup of honey over top.  Then, I swirl it all through the cake.  There's not really a need to worry about spooning the batter on top of the filing...it still comes out lovely!  I like the addition of honey in the cake.  A wonderful recipe and definitely NOT for dieters', but it's worth the indulgence!!

I made this for my boss's birthday and everyone absolutely loved it!  Everyone that ate a piece got a copy of the recipe.  I considered reducing the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture, but after devouring my first piece I am so happy I didn't change a thing.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

This was very good, very easy and I added pecans to the brown sugar mixture.  Also, I made it in a bundt pan, 50 minutes baking time.  It was rather sweet, but everybody liked it, none is left!

This cake was wonderful.  I halved the amount of brown sugar mixture and used 1/3 less fat sour cream.  Also halved the icing.  It was wonderful warm, right out of the oven.  I took it to work and it was a hit!  This will be made again!

Absolutely wonderful, this cake lived up to all the 5 star reviews!I cooked it in a metal pan at 350 degrees and in 40 minutes it was done. For icing, I used store bought cream cheese frosting and this was a wonderful compliment to the cake. It turns out like a coffee cake and literally melts off the fork into your mouth. Excellent!

I just finished baking this and already my husband has had 3 huge pieces and my 7 year daughter had 2 pieces.  This is a very good variation to a coffee cake.  I used the entire 1 cup of brown sugar but I was careful not to pack it because I didnt want the cake to turn out to sweet.  Next time I will add about a cup og chopped pecans to the brown sugar cinnamon mix for a little crunch in the middle. I also drizzeled the frosting over the cake rather then cover it completly.  This is a delicious cake!! thanks for sharing the recipe :) Oh one more thing my daughter has renamed it to honey bunny cake :)

Fabulous flavor!  My picky husband and daughter LOVED this cake!  I would consider it more of a coffee cake though.  It is so moist that it almost falls apart when you slice it.  Even though it tastes best when warm, it slices better when it's cool.  I plan on making this very often!  (It didn't last a day in my house!)  Thank you!

This cake was totally good!  I made it in a bundt pan, and only needed about 1/2 of the brown sugar filling stuff.  I used a different glaze as someone else had suggested, and it was fantastic.  I cut it up and sent it to work with my hubby.  He  said everyone LOVED it, although he's a little confused and told everyone it was apple spice cake (ha ha) they still loved it.  I will definately make this again, maybe in a regular cake pan next time to see the difference.  THANKS MUCH!

You don't have to add inches to your waist with this one. It tastes just as good when you substitute the fat-ful stuff with fat-free! Use applesauce instead of oil, use egg substitute instead of eggs, use reduced fat sour cream and use skim milk. I have sent the recipe out to 5 people so far who liked it! And you won't have to do extra workouts after eating it!

I love this recipe.  I had a 15.25 oz. cake mix (the newer smaller size another reviewer mentioned.) I went to Betty Crocker web site to see if ingredients were different.  They only change was to decrease oil to 2/3 cup.  Just a FYI .

I was super excited to make this cake last night, since I have never had a honey bun cake and it sounded delish. I followed the recipe almost exact except for: I baked it in a smaller glass pan since the cake mix I got was 15oz, I used about 2/3 cup of the brown sugar mix, but next time I'll just use 1/2 cup because it was ALMOST too sweet, and I cut the icing in half since I used a smaller pan, also, I sprayed the baking dish with pam because I was afraid the cake would stick. I let the cake cool completely before drizzling the icing on top so the heat from the cake didn't make it a melted uniform thin coating. I tried it soon after drizzling the icing and I was actually disappointed and agreed with the negative reviews saying it tasted like yellow cake mix and sugar, but I had a piece this afternoon and with the icing hardened and cake completely cool, the flavors come together muuuch better! Also, I thought, "Soo where does the 'Honey' part come into play?...well I lightly drizzled honey on top with the icing and it just adds to it, presentation wise and taste too! This will go great with my morning cup of Joe...might not make it in the near future, but it's pretty frickin' good!

Made this recipe except only substitution I used was  1/2 regular brown sugar with 1/2 Splenda brown sugar.  Came out wonderful.  My whole family loves it.  We will be making this a lot in the future.

I was looking for a drizzle top icing for another bundt cake I made.  I used this recipe's icing ingredients and the measurements I think are wrong.  I believe the 4 tablespoons of milk is probably right, but the 1 tablespoon of vanilla probably is 1 tsp.  When I used all 5 tablespoons of the liquid ingredients (including the vanilla) it was literally like a runny soup.  I had to add another 2 cups of confectionary sugar to get it to the right consistency!  yikes!

Soooo moist and delicious! Everyone at my part LOVED it!I wasn't paying close enough attention to the recipe and mixed it all together, it was still awesome. I've made it twice the first time I froze it so I could trim it and it sat afterward for two days(covered), it was much much better than the one we ate fresh. Sounds strange but it's true, it was moister and more flavorful. Also I used my favorite cream cheese icing. Yummy!

.I brought this cake into the nurses station, I used the clone cinnabon bun icing instead of the one for this recipe, the nurses loved and gave it two thumbs up. Its a keeper, I made it in a Bundt pan and I noticed that it didn't rise that high, so I checked the cake box to make sure it there wasn't pudding in the mix and ithere wasn't,  it was a regular cake mix, so I guess this cake doesn't rise as much as the Irish cream cake. This is a keeper and a very easy cake to make, I topped it with some crushed nuts to make it look prettier. I made another one when i got home, My mom said it was one of the best cakes I have made and I bake all the time.

Everybody raved about this cake when I brought it to a dinner party - everybody wanted seconds (and thirds)! I was out of sour cream so I used buttermilk instead (1 cup of skim milk with 1 Tbs of vinegar) and it worked just fine. Great recipe!

Added a box of vanilla pudding powder mix, 1 TB more of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of cardamon and it was perfect. Thanks for this nice cake- also a version of the graham streusel coffee cake here on this site. Only diff is the other uses walmuts and no sour cream but this honey bun cake is more moist and more like a cinnamon roll. Thanks!

Made this recipe once before as a bundt cake and receive rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  Baked it yesterday for a bake sale but divided the recipe and made it using two 9 inch round pans.  Used the mix manufacturer's recommendations for baking two rounds as a guide.  Turned out beautifully!

this cake lasted just 3 days in my house, which is pretty telling.  i had made it for a church function that got cancelled so we indulged! :)  i had to make some changes due to what i had on hand, such as subbing fat free cinnamon flavored yogurt for the sour cream, and white sugar for the brown in the swirl.  i baked it in a bundt pan as many other people did.  i wish i would have waited for the cake to cool before adding glaze, because when it's warm the glaze just melts into it instead of forming the honey-bun like "crust".  otherwise great - my husband really really enjoyed this.  thanks!

I got this recipe from Jennifer Walker here in 2003. I've made it so many times I can't even count. Everyone loves it. I've passed it on to my Mom and she gets so many compliments.  They think its store bought. Absolutely a go to recipe for emergencies, and know it will not let you down.  Well Done!

Made this as a bundt cake.  Put all the crumb mixture in the middle of the cake carefully spooning it on so that none of the mixture touched the edge of the pan.  Baked for the same length of time as the original recipe.  Followed another readers suggestion and poked holes in the cake while still in the pan & as soon as it came out of the oven.  Spooned on abt 1/3 of the glaze & used the back of the spoon to work the glaze down into the wholes.  Waited abt 15 min to invert the cake onto a plate & then spooned the rest of the glaze over the cake.  Also, I put abt 1/4 tsp of malple extract flavoring in the glaze.  This cake was very moist & was gobbled up at work.

Very Good!!! Taste just like a Honey Bun. I cooked in a bundt pan and baked a little longer. It's very sweet. Next time I might put a little less of the brown sugar / cinnamon mixture. Everyone loved. Thanks for the great recipe.

I don't get the "honey bun" thing? It is excellent but not like any honey bun I have ever had. Moist and sooo good. Family just loves will make again. The glaze was kind of too sweet. But besides that LOVE IT

I made this cake exactly as instructed and, while I find it to be delicious in its own way, it doesn't taste like a honey bun. I think that the cinnamon dominates the cake. It's a good thing I love that spice! It reminds me of a coffee cake more than anything. I will make this again, but next time, I won't use a packaged cake mix. The generic flavor of it took away from the great potential of this cake, in my opinion. Completely scratch made will be the way to go with this recipe to make it superb. But if you're in a pinch for time & just want something good to put on the table or take to an event, this will do fine. I made mine in a greased & floured bundt pan and it came out absolutely beautiful. Thanks so much!

My family loved this cake.  I ate mine with coffee in the morning and it was really nice.  I made the glaze and added a little cinnamon and only one teaspoon of vanilla. I made it in two loaf pans and it made two nice loaves.

This cake is good, my 8 year old son loves it, but i'm giving it 2 stars because whoever posted the recipe must have been, um, never mind, but... 1 tablespoon of vanilla? Nope!! Don't even go there. Cook time says one hour, but then "bake in the oven for 40 minutes". Make up your mind. Also, show a pic of a bunt cake, but tell me to use an ungreased 9x13 glass baking dish. The cake was not as good as it should have been, as the cook time was TOTALLY unclear and overdone, and the icing, I had to pour it out and start over using 1 TEASPOON of vanilla and THAT was still way too much.

I am the cook for our family and am 14 1/2 years old. This was soooo good! I didn't have any sour cream, so I made sour milk instead. I also used a bundt cake like some people suggested. I am definitely making this again??

I totally pirated this recipe. What came out was really good, especially the next day- nuke it for 15 seconds, it's so yummy.  First, I only used 1/3 c. oil, I replaced the sour cream with 2/3 c. fat free sour cream & 1/3 c. fat free plain yogurt.  I added 1/2 c. applesauce to make the cake moist since it lacks the extra oil.  That's the only changes to the cake.  I did put it in a nonstick bundt pan sprayed with Baker's Joy and baked at 350, not 325 for 40 mins.  It came out beautifully and smelled awesome.  Instead of the glaze, I made my own with 2 tbls butter, 2/3 c. brown sugar, & 1/3 c. water heated until boiling, then off the heat I added 1/4 c. whiskey very slowly. I poured it over the warm cake.  So good, but even better the next day.

Soooo disappointed! I generously greased and floured my bundt pan and the darn thing stuck and fell in pieces as I tried to get it out. It tastes OK...it was really hard for me to tell when it was done because the knife came out gooey due to the filling so I may have overcooked it a bit. The icing was very unappealing looking and it didn't taste so great, either. I will stick with my fave bundt cake....the irish cream bundt cake!

I made this for my sons and they loved it- said it tastes exactly like their favorite honey buns.  I used a bundt pan and needed an additional ten minutes cooking time.  Make sure not to get the brown sugar mixture near the outsides of the pan- it makes it stick.  I halved the icing and it was still plenty.  Thank you for the recipe, Jennifer- my oldest son says he wants this for his birthday cake this year.

This is totally AWESOME! Got in a hurry & added the struesel to the batter, but that made the cinnamon permeate the entire batter-which is a good thing. Smelled wonderful cooking, made the glaze w/half & half & poked shallow holes in the top w/a fork.  So tender when I put the knife in to cut-was the star of the evening at the neighbor's dinner~~will definetely be making this again-thanks for the recipe!

Thanks, Jennifer, this one is a definite keeper.  Made it just like written except used bundt (sprayed with Baker's Joy).  Used about 3/4 of the brown sugar/cinnamon in the middle, then lightly sprinkled the rest on top of the batter before baking.  Used only 1/2 the glaze bc DH was watching me and is the sugar police.  Excellent.

I gave this 4 stars instead of 3 because I think I made a mistake with layering the batter.  I used a bundt pan and layered the batter with the brown sugar mizture.  As a result when I got a bite without the brown sugar the cake tasted very bland. I would mix the brown sugar in with the batter next time.
I added additional cinnamon per other reviewers suggestions but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It was NOT too sweet at all. In fact someone who doesn't like sweet said this was the best cake I ever baked. 
Also the name is deceptive- it more of a cinnamon roll/bun cake than honeybun. For me it was just ok but very easy to make.

This cake was pretty good. The flavor was delicious though it seemed a bit too sweet, even for honey bun cake.

Another 5 star review here.  Made recipe as written except used canned frosting on top--about 2/3 of a can of vanilla--and I let it melt on top while the cake was still warm.  Awesome.  Big hit at the office.

I didn't have yellow cake in the pantry, so I used white cake mix.  I made it in a bundt cake, 350 degrees for 42 minutes.  I only made half the frosting per previous reviews, but I wish I would have made it all since it would have looked prettier with it dripping down the side.  My guests loved it and I was asked for the recipe.  Will definately make again.

This cake is so easy to make and gets rave reviews! It does taste just like a honey bun! I used a white cake mix b/c that's all I had in the pantry, and it was great. Very moist, just enough cinnamon and sugar. I cooked the cake in a bundt pan and cut the icing recipe in half and it was plenty. Received rave reviews! Thanks so much for sharing!!

Allright the taste gets a 4 star rating. It was pretty good, I did add a little extra cinnamon because we like cinnamon. However, I did use a bundt cake pan because I saw the picture with the recipe and it looked great. I followed the directions as stated to put the batter in a UNGREASED pan, but that was for a 9x13 glass baking pan and the cake did not come out cleanly. The bottom stuck on the pan, so if anyone uses a bundt pan my suggestion is to grease with a spray. I will make this again, but I will use a greased pan.

Easy and delicious and yes, very very sweet, so be warned if that's not what you're looking for. My husband and I love it, however. I've made it for four birthdays and once for fun. It always goes fast!

My father-in-law loves Honey Buns so when I came across this recipe I had to make it for him.  It was a huge hit!  I made a small change though, I exchanged the sour cream for 1 cup of vanilla pudding to cut back on the fat. It came out so wonderfully moist. The recipe is so easy and the results are awesome.  I highly recommend it.

This cake is sooo delicous!  Oh my goodness----absolutely fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was to die for.  Very sweet and extremely yummy.  I wanted to try this recipe out, before my job Christmas party, because I'd planned on making it for our potluck.  Well...its a winner.  I'm sure everyone will love it as much as me!

This recipe is great as is the only thing I changed is the icing. It only needed half of the amount in the recipe. I made my cake in a bundt pan like most did but I'm sure it's fine in the pan suggested as well. Next time I may add pecans to the icing.

This was perfect! I've been looking for a bundt recipe with yummy cinnamon in it for my hubby, and this is it! I also used a bundt pan & had to cook it for about 50-55 min. It came out moist & delicious. My kids loved it as well! Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe.  The cake was delicious and moist.  I used a bundt pan and put some of the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture on the top as well as in the middle.  Also I substituted mayonnaise for the sour cream only because I didn't have any sour cream on hand.  Will try the sour cream next time.  In addition to this I used the cake recipe posted by CaleyCat instead of a store bought mix.    It turned out lovely, was enjoyed by all. 5 stars and highly recommended!

This is one of the best recipes that I have ever tried that is based around a cake mix.  I cannot show up at any family function (especially for the holidays) without having this cake in tow.  A knock-out!

Normally, I love anything that has to do with cinnamon and brown sugar, I was very excited to try this recipe, but when I made it I was sadly disappointed. This cake was way too sweet (I never thought I would say that about any dessert)it might have been better if I would have left the icing off, but I took one bite and could not touch it again. It was awful and I followed the directions to a tee, I would not make this cake again.

This recipe makes a very moist, flavorful cake.  My husband loves it, and he usually wants chocolate.  Cutting the vanilla to 2 tsps. in the glaze cuts down the sweetness and makes it just about perfect.  I used lite sour cream, and it worked out perfectly.  Next time, I will cut back the oil to 1/2 C as it is simply TOO moist.  Made it 2 days ago, and it is 3/4s gone.  I have only eaten 1 average-size serving.  That tells you something!

Very good, and very sweet!  I only used 3/4 the brown sugar mixture and only 1/2 the glaze. This would definately be good with coffee!  I will make again, but I will try some add-ins like others suggested, and maybe cut the sugar some more.

I brought this to a church potluck, and initially it was getting passed over because it *looks* like an ordinary coffee cake. But once a few people tried it, word of mouth spread, and the cake was gone in no time! Several requests for the recipe with this one. The only thing I changed: I made the full recipe for the glaze, but I used less than 1/4 of it. Just a light glazing while warm was perfect. I think any more than that would be overkill.

WONDERFUL! I WILL ADMIT TO ADDING PECANS TO THE CINNAMON MIXTURE..BUT WHEN I READ ABOUT ALL THE SUGAR GLAZE I HIT ON SOMETHING ...HOT VANILLA SAUCE! I COOKED A BOX OF SUGAR FREE VANILLA PUDDING MIX ON THE STOVE BUT ADDED A THIRD OF A CUP TOO MUCH MILK TO MAKE IT THINNER...SERVED WARM MY WHOLE FAMILY ATE THIS UP LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW!

Very simple, but delicious! I think it would be best if made with plain cake mix, not the pudding in the mix kind.

I made this and reviewed it a couple of years ago, and I made it again last night, and had to re-write my review. This cake is SOOO good and EASY! I didn't have a lot of time to throw something together before we had company over for dessert, and this totally hit the spot. I love the idea of using a cake mix (which I generally don't enjoy) as a base, and adding simple everyday ingredients to make it super yummy. 
The only difference is that I used about 1 1/4 cup of sour cream (light). I also cooked this in a bundt pan instead of a sheet. Delicious and pretty! Couldn't ask for more.

Well, hubby thinks that I am the best thing since sliced bread for making this. He is on his 2nd piece in 5 minutes! I think that the directions are all off. I think everything ought to be dumped in the mixer, including the brown sugar and cinnamon, and just mix it all together. The layering is ridiculous and too time consuming and frustrating. I loved the brown sugar mixture and the topping, both were the right amounts. Thanks for the post!

Easy and yummy!  Followed the recipe exactly except used a butter white cake mix and the end result was great.  Next time, though, I will cut the cinnamon/sugar mixture in half.  The glaze complemented the cake nicely, but you could probably cut that in half as well (as another reviewer pointed out, as is you are adding 3 additional cups of sugar to an already sweet cake mix).  Next time I might add some nuts as well just because we like nuts.  This one's going in the recipe box!

My family enjoyed this cake. I did not have the ingredients to make glaze, so I cooled the cake and put cream cheese frosting on it. Not much like a honey bun, but very good! Will make again.

Oh - My - God. This cake is fabulous! And sooooo easy! I used a Betty Crocker French Vanilla cake mix instead of the yellow cake and half the brown sugar with only a teaspoon of vanilla. When i took it out of the oven, I poked holes in the cake with a toothpick and drizzled the icing over the top while it was still hot. The glaze formed a sweet, sugary topping that can't be beat. Try this recipe - you'll love it.

I am 14 and luv 2 cook (got it frm my mom). This is the BEST I've ever made. Though, I got really scared when I had to spoon the other half of the batter over top of the brown sugar and the cinnamon because I didn't really have enough. I was like, OMG, am I going 2 beable 2 do this?!?! I tried and tried, and eventually, somehow, I covered the brown sugar and cinnamon completly (my cooking maricle)!! I really enjoyed making this and will be one of my favs. This is NOT the last time I will make this high fatty type food that has ruined my diet; beware dieters!!!!(lol)!!!!

This had a great taste but didn't turn out very pretty as the top half stuck in the bundt pan! The cake also failed to rise very much. I used about 3/4 of the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture and think that was too much. I probably won't make this again, but if I do, I won't use a bundt.

I just had to try this recipe!  I made two 8 inch cakes with this recipe- they turned out small, but that way I could give one to my mother without doubling the recipe.  I only used 1/2 of the brown sugar mixture and it was plenty sweet.  I also had tons of icing left, so I put it in the fridge for cinnamon buns.  The only other alteration I made was instead of using vanilla, I made the icing with 2 cups conf sugar, 2 tbs of milk, and 2 tbs of strong brewed coffee.  I thought it gave the glaze a nice flavor.  Overall, this cake is supereasy and moist, but a little sweet for my taste.

I love sweet, but WOW this was way too sweet.  It was, however, very good and very easy.  Next time, I will cut the sugar in half like others said and I will also cut the icing amount in half or use a cream cheese frosting instead.  Very good otherwise.  also i did not cook as long as the recipe stated.  I used a butter cake mix because I did not have yellow.

Wow, made these for my husband's coworkers as breakfast cupcakes, topped with storebought cream cheese icing.  He said they disappeared as soon as people heard about them.  I left a few uniced, which I preferred as well as only using half the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  They seemed awfully sweet already but I guess some people just can't have enough sugar in the morning! Very easy to make and hard to mess up.

This cake was outstanding.  I took it to the office this morning and the whole cake was devoured within an hour!  The only change I made was that I did halve the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture and the amount was just right.  The cake was so moist - it just melted in your mouth...very yummy.  I will be making this cake often!

Very easy, very quick, and very good! I suggest using high quality grade A eggs (or maybe just three eggs instead of four) because the cake tastes a bit eggy to me. The cake tastes great either served warm with ice cream or served cool by itself. And the icing recipe, although simple, is definitely a keeper. I use it on all my bundt cakes now - who knew that much vanilla would taste good? Overall GREAT cake.

This cake is very good.  The batter was quite thick so I did add a little water.  Cake turned out very moist.  I did make mine in a bundt cake pan which did add a little time.

yum! This is so good. My husband and I each had three pieces over the course of one day!! Since I love honey buns with raisins and walnuts, I can imagine these additions would taste good. My husband says, it is great as is. It was definitely better on the first day. The sugar starts to get crunchy after a couple of days (It's a lot of cake for just two people)

I love it when you get a new recipe and you have all ingredients needed to make it. I guess this would be considered semi-home made. I will forever keep pkgs of yellow cake mix handy. This was fool proof, quick and simple! and grrrreat warm with a scoop of ice cream. This will be something that I will make and take for get togethers. Yummy, Thank you Jennifer!!!

Ok, I don't know what I did wrong, but it didn't turn out like a honeybun.  The cake looked like it was raw when it was done, but I checked it and it wasn't.  The texture was weird, like moist/raw? I did however halve the recipe, so maybe that's what did it.  I might give this another try though, since I love honeybuns.

The cake was easy to make, and made the house smell fabulous! I served it with a cream cheese icing. Everyone loved it, but it wasn't as good as I expected. Still great cake, though, and a nice alternative to plain yellow cake. This tastes a lot like a crumb cake, and would be great with a crumb topping.

I think I am going to have to try making this cake again.  My first effort today was disappointing.  The smell of the baking cake was awesome, but the end result was not what I expected.  I again with other reviewers that the brown sugar should be reduced by half.  This is definitely a coffee cake or a large cinnamon bun.  I topped the warm cake with the Cinnabon Frosting which was nice.  I will try again and hope to have better results.

If I wasn't such a chocolate lover, I would say this was the best cake ever made.  I've eaten it numerous times, but this is the first time I've baked it.  I can't rave about it enough.  So easy!!

I made this for a neighbor who had their parents and in-laws visiting for a week. When I got back home, my house smelled so great, that I made another cake for my family. It was gone in both households the SAME DAY! My neighbors raved about the cake, and my husband is asking for more! Very sweet, and very delicious!

This cake mysteriously disappeared in a little over three hours! Fun, easy, and even a conversation piece...I give it an all-over 5 rating.  On the "did my husband like it" scale?  A "10"!

I've made this a lotta times - just wanted to add that I just recently had to substitute vanilla yogurt for the sour cream (thought I had sour cream....didn't....figured it might make a good substitute, lol) & it worked out great!

This is quick and easy to prepare, and I made it in a bundt pan as other reviewers suggested.  It makes a beautiful cake that is wonderfully moist.   I would cut back a little on the cinnamon as I found it too aggressive though, but everyone still enjoyed it.

This recipe needs no icing. Great as a bundt cake. Sprinkle a little of the sugar swirl in the bottom of the pan to create a nice crunch on top. Add chopped pecans to the sugar before swirling. So yummy.

Absolutely amazing!!!!!!  I have used this website for years and have never written a review but I had to for this cake.  I made it for thanksgiving as some of my guests don't really like pie or any traditional thanksgiving desserts.  Once one person tried it and word go around the house at how delicious it was this cake was gone in minutes!!!!  The only bad thing I can say is I wish I had made two.  This will forever be my go to.  Although not as pretty as some other cakes I've made.  The taste is just amazing.  Try it you will fall in love too.

We thought this was okay. It did taste like a cinnamon roll, but a different texture. It did not taste like a honey bun. I think a cream cheese icing might made the cake taste better as the standard "frosting" (glaze) was super sweet. It was not as moist as I would have liked.

I'm giving this four stars only because the cake completely fell apart.  It is a delicious cake, but we had to eat it out of a bowl instead of enjoying it like a real cake.  We will make it again, but I don't think I would take this to a dinner.

Not only was this easy, it was also very delicious. It does not taste like a cake mix. I did not change the recipe at all, but I did use a bundt pan  and sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray in order to take it out of the pan while warm. Thank you for sharing this!

FYI--if your cake mix is a 15.25 oz, you can either use 7/8 of everything or just throw everything together!  Although I did use 3 eggs instead of 4.

I used a bundt cake pan, and this was a huge hit!

Made this recipe a couple of times. Only ting I did differently was to make it in a bundt cake pan. Turned out great! Lots of compliments on it. It is definitely more of a coffee cake, than a dessert cake though.

I made this for my first dinner party and served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Although i had only four guests it was gone in less than fifteen minutes! I guess it was good but I was so busy entertaining that I never got to taste any. I will definitely make again but this time, just for my household lol.

I used a Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Orange Supreme 18.25 oz cake mix.  

Since my family likes things extra-sweet, I added 1/2 cup white sugar to the batter as indicated by the other honey bun cake recipe on here & an extra teaspoon of cinnamon @ 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the brown sugar mixture.  I put 1/2 the brown sugar/cinnamon/nut mix to the center, then the other 1/2 on the top (which will become the bottom of the bundt cake).  

Baked it at time & temp indicated in this recipe, but had to increase temp to 350 & bake an additional 30 minutes more to get it to finish (due to the increase in fluid via the sugar added to the cake mixture).  

For the icing, instead of milk & vanilla extract, I used the juice from 2 small oranges & about a tablespoon of butter.  I also had to use a little more than 2 cups powdered sugar to get it to thicken.  But in my family, the more icing, the better.  

This was a big hit with the whole family - would definitely make it again!

I give this 5 stars for taste and ease of preparation.  I made it according to the recipe and only took one reviewers suggestion and added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. brandy extract.  I only made 1/2 the glaze...it was more than enough.  Tasted it while still a bit warm....yummy!  I will make this one again, probably to serve as a breakfast cake.

This was a fine cake but nothing exciting.  I've made a similar cake that didn't have the added sour cream and it was better in my opinion.  I will stick with my other recipe.

Yum! Really does taste like a honey bun. I don't put all of the glaze on it. Only about half, with even a little less milk.

This cake is so good and so moist.  I added a little water to thin the batter some.  But my family and my coworkers had a fit over it.  I have been asked to make it again.

Excellent! My DH's favorite cake. More like a sock-it-to-me cake minus the nuts. Before I take it out of the bundt pan I poke holes all over and pour 1/3 of the glaze over the cake. Once absorbed I turn it out onto a platter. I cool the cake completely before I glaze the top so that the glaze doesn't liquify and slide right off. So, so yummy.

Made this for Father's Day - My BF loved it. Followed the recipe exactly but only used half of the ingredients for the icing. Will make again!

Easy recipe, still  tasted like box cake mix  but more moist with a hint of cinnamon.   The glaze on top was a nice touch.  This was tasty warm  but most likely will not make again prefer scratch cakes.

Very good cake.  I did use a little less brown sugar mix and added some lightly toasted chopped pecans to the frosting.

Excellent! I usually make it in a bundt pan and cut the frosting in half. You don't need that much if you drizzle it on and let it run down the sides. You do need to let it cool completly before drizzling the icing. So pretty and good too!

I make this cake a lot because everyone just loves it.  It keeps really well and gets better as it sits, if it lasts that long.  I usually make it the day before I need to take it somewhere and hide it.  It is wonderful still warm.

I liked this because it was quick and easy and tasted good. It wasn't outstanding and that's why I have it 4 stars. I would call it a CinnaBun cake!

I'm giving this 4 stars, but I plan on making it again, and I hope to re-rate it to 5.  I took the other reviewers suggestions and made the cake in a bundt pan.  When I tried to remove it from the pan, the top half came out first, so I had to piece the cake back together.  Also, I sprinkled the brown sugar mixutre in the bottom of the pan, and it woundup with a slightly burned taste - very unappetizing to me.  I removed that topping from the cake, and added the frosting.  And voila! - a delicious struesel coffee cake (dont' know why it got named "honey bun" - doesn't taste anything like one).  So, a very tasty cake, easy to make, but I won't use a bundt pan next time.

Only change I made was added about 2 ounces of cream cheese to the icing. This cake taste like a cinnamon roll more than a honey bun. But the kids liked it.

Cake tastes great, if it would turn out.  Twice now I have tried it, and it turns to a pile of solid mush.  Way too many liquids (sour cream, eggs, oil).  I just took those elements out and made it--turned out great.

WONDERFUL! This is my new favorite dessert to make and to eat! It is so delicious! Very moist, and the brown sugar in the middle, with the sweet icing on top makes it just like a cinnamon roll but better! I highly recommend this its so so so good!

We love this recipe.  I took the advice of another reviewer and sprinkle some of the topping in the bottom of the pan. I make it in a bundt pan and in mini bundt pans for gift baskets.  Everyone thinks they are great!  I also add cream cheese to the icing to add to the flavor. YUMMY recipe. Thanks!

Everyone loved this cake, but as other reviewers warned, it is VERY sweet. Instead of making icing per instructions, I used a tub of whipped cream cheese frosting. Next time, I'll probably use the confectioners sugar described in instructions but only enough to drizzle over cake. Only other comment is that layering the second half of the batter over the filling is NOT easy. Batter kept sticking to filling and wouldn't smooth over it. but no one noticed. This one's a keeper.

I gave this a 4 star review.  The cake is very good, but much too sweet for me and I am a lover of anything sweet.  Next time I will use only 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I set the timer for 50 minutes because other reviewers said it was not baked completely in 40 minutes.  I took my cake out and it still had runny cake batter in the center.  I put the cake back in the oven and baked a total of 60 minutes.   Overall this is a good cake.  Will bake again.

I make this cake also...I use plain or vanilla yogert instead of the sour cream and it comes out moist with less calories. Another change is I cook it in a 9 x 13 pan for 30 mins at 350. I add 1 cup of brown sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon, mix together to form crumb mixture. Bigger the crumbs the better I say! yum! poor half batter in pan, poor some crumbs on it and poor the other half in and top with remaining crumb mixture. take a knife and swirl it around. Bake and Drizzle. Yum! everyone in the house will love this one.

Very tasty cake.  I decreased the oil to 1/2 cup and put half the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture in the middle, half on top before swirling.  I omitted the glaze and added chopped walnuts on top.  It was delicious!  I wouldn't say it really reminded me of a honey bun, though.  Maybe with the glaze it would...I guess I'll have to try it again to find out!

Just baked this cake in a rectangular pan and I'm pleased with it.  I only used half of the sugar and it tastes wonderful.  I also replaced the sour cream for natural yogurt, just because it's what I had in my fridge. I'm very fond of cinnamon.  The reason I gave 4 stars it's because the bottom got too dark and i don't know why...For my taste, it doesn't need icing-I'm thinking that may be with a scoop of ice-cream to top it would be delicious.

This cake is AMAZING!!! It is now my new favorite cake. So good and so irresistible! I baked mine in a bundt pan for 45 minutes. I also added some of the cinnamon/sugar mixture in the pan before pouring the batter. When using a bundt pan, you can half the icing recipe. I poured a majority of the excess in the middle whole, but it was still a ton. Everyone loved this cake!! It definitely tastes like a mixture of honey bun and cinnamon roll! YUM!!

I made a mistake by cooking it in a tube pan without adjusting the time. So it fell. We end up tasting it and it had a decent flavor. I'm just bummed that I screwed it up.

Very good! I love to bake cakes just to see how they turn out. We don't eat a lot of sweets so they usually end up at my husband's work. He said everyone gobbled it up. We even took some to our vet's office and they loved it too.

Everyone loves this cake! However I only gave it 4 stars because it is way too sweet with all that frosting. If you cut the frosting ingredients in 1/2 it is just right. And, I can never get it to swirl because of the brown sugar mixture, but that doesn't matter me.

This cake is amazing.  My family loved it.  I made the cake from scratch, as I did not have a box of cake mix...but other than that, followed the recipe as written, and it was delicious.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing.

This was really good!  I used a butter cake mix, so I replaced the oil with butter.  Other than that, made as instructed.  Next time, I believe I'll forego the glaze...the cake was great without it...and a little too sweet with!!!  Thanks!!

We make this cake on a pretty regular basis.  It's really easy and tasty. The only problem I have with it is the icing. It doesn't go well with the cake. I tried, as another person suggested, the clone of cinnabon icing.  It didn't work either. We've been just skipping the icing. It tastes great that way too. This cake is a definate keeper.

Be prepared for this to be very, very sweet. If you decide to do the icing I would suggest to thinly drizzle it over the cake. I used a bundt cake pan and found that I had to bake it for an additional 20 minutes. The brown sugar, cinnamon filling layer tasted good but it did make that part of the cake slightly mushy. I wasn't expecting this to happen as I have made similar recipies without this result. If I make this again using the bundt style pan I will not use so much of this filling.

I made this into a bunt cake for a prettier look. All though it did not taste like a honey bun it was still a very good cake. It tastes more like a coffee cake. I added chopped pecans and extra cinnamon. I cooked it at 325 for 40 mins and at 350 for an additional 10. Turned out great and my guests loved it.

I baked this cake without changing anything and I feel it's the best cake I've ever made. It's so unfilling! I don't feel like I've eaten cake after I've eaten a piece. I will definitely bake this again.

Made this as a dessert for a book reading group I have. We read "Secret Life of Bees" so I thought this would be a cute refreshment. Very moist and terribly good. Many of the ladies loved it and asked for the recipe. Took the suggestion to layer the cinn. and brown sugar mixture and swirl, it turns out very pretty. Love it when something this easy taste so great. Thanks!

This cake is great!  I did make little changes I fixed mine in a bunt pan and I used condenced milk and a little more vanilla.  I added a little regular milk until the icing was not so thick. 
Great recipe! Thanks

I was going to a convention, so I needed a cake that would travel with me and didn't need to be on ice. We all drank coffee in our hotel rooms, and I wanted something different than donuts. When the cake cooled and was firm, I cut it up into two inch squares so it would be easy to grab one while drinking coffee. Everyone loved it. Very sweet, but with a hot cup of strong coffee it was a hit.  I did add 1/8 teaspoon almond extract, 3/4 cup of finely chopped walnuts, and a little water to the powder sugar frosting. I've never told anyone the name of the cake, but people were telling me it tasted like a honey bun.  A winner!

This was so sweet, and over all was the worst cake I've ever made. I even left off the glaze! I thought the sour cream would add some kind of depth, like maybe a subtle creamy tangy flavor(like in cream cheese) but it didn't. The only flavor this cake has is sugar and I want a more complex flavor than that in my cakes. What a waste of eggs.

This cake tastes delicious!  I made it for Thanksgiving of '07 for my boyfriend's family, and everyone loved it.  Next time I make it, I may use clear imitation vanilla, however, for the glaze because real vanilla tinted it a brown color.  I'll admit it did not look too pretty. I winded up cutting the cake into slices so it would look more presentable.  It was, and I will definitely make it again!

Good as far as taste, but not the best in terms of overall results. I made the cake without any ingredient changes at all, used all 1 cup of brown sugar, 1 T cinnamon, full fat sour cream, all the oil, etc. The only difference was that I made it in a 12 cup Bundt pan which was well-greased and floured. It took 55 minutes to cook in the Bundt pan and it rose nicely but the sugar filling sunk in several places, with the result that the top stuck in the pan even after allowing for cooling time. I had to piece it together and cover the wounds with a different, thicker and whiter glaze (1 cup confectioners sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla powder, 4 TEASPOONS half and half, drizzled on while cake was still warm, so it could flow down the sides a little). It tasted nice, moist but not wet, but it really is more of a breakfast/brunch cake. I will try again in the Bundt pan with same ingredients and a slightly different technique. If it still sticks, I probably won't make it again, as there are more predictable cakes out there.

great coffee cake!  Used bundt pan and made repeated layers of batter and cinnamon sugar.  4 eggs tastes eggy out of the oven, but was perfect the next day. Will make this for Christmas morning as it gets better the next day.

i followed the recipe exactly and i also used a 9x13 pan. i think the glaze was just the right amount. what i did though was use a fork to poke holes in the cake so the glaze would seep through. this is a very easy, very fast and super delicious cake!

Very good, very sweet, and very moist.  I made it in a bundt pan, like the picture.  I started adding the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture and thought it was too much.  I then noticed the recommendation was to cook it in a 13x9 pan.  I added the entire mixture thinking "this is never going to work".  It did work and it turned out great.  I cut the glaze recipe in half.

I loved it.  But I love sweets, boxed yellow cake mix, and cinnamon.  If you dislike yellow cake mix you probably won't like it.  I put all the batter on the bottom, topped it with the honey/sugar/cinnamon, and ran a knife through just the top 3 things to mix a little.  Best warm.

OMG...How delicious is this cake?!
I can't believe how quickly it gets scarfed up, both at the office and at home. Everybody loves it, and ends up saying, "Please, sock it to me some more!" You will end up with a bit of extra glaze, whichever type of pan you choose to prepare it in. Suffer with it! (LOL)
My sweet tooth has been renewed since finding this particular recipe. Thank you, Jennifer! (I think.)

This was a good flavored cake, but def does NOT taste like a honey bun.  Im sorry, it just doesnt.  It tastes and looks like a cinnamon and brown sugar pound cake.  Simple as that.  My hubby loved the icing and the cinnamon and brown sugar, but i was let down when it tasted NOTHING like a honey bun.  LOL

I was skeptical because this recipe calls for a box cake mix, however, this cake is delicious! It is best served warm and with a tall glass of milk. I didn't change a thing! Thank-you!

I made two of these cakes, one friday and another saturday morning.  I followed the recipe to a tee on the first one.  The only thing I didnt like was not greasing the cake pan.  It was a little difficult to get out.  The taste was GREAT.  The second one I sprayed the cake pan with cooking spray and dusted it with a little cake mix.  Then I also added 3 teaspoon (or to taste) of peanutbutter in the icing mix and made a peanutbutter icing.  Saturday at my daughter's birthday party everyone love the cake and two people took the recipe home with them!!

I was not at all pleased with this cake.  If you want a cake that tastes like yellow cake mix with cinnamon swirled in, then go for this. Otherwise, keep searching.  I'm not normally harsh with my reviews, but this was just plain bad.  Made it in a bundt pan but otherwise followed the directions precisely.  I'm used to cake from scratch, though, and don't generally care for cake mix.  I was hoping it would somehow taste homemade, but was sorely disappointed.

This is SO wonderful! We're not big cake fans but my adult sons asked for this after a friend's mom made it. I did not expect to like it but the cake turned out moist, light, the filling perfect! I did only use (at most) 1/4 of glaze and it was perfect! Thank you so much!

I MADE THIS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND IT WAS WONDERFUL SO I MADE ANOTHER ONE FOR MY HUBBY TO TAKE TO WORK AS A TREAT FOR HIS COWORKERS. I MADE IT JUST AS THE DIRECTIONS SAID AND I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING. I DID POKE HOLES IN THE TOP OF THE CAKE BEFORE POURING THE ICING ON. THIS WAS SOOOOOOOOOO EASY TO MAKE AND ALL THE PEOPLE AT MY HUBBY'S WORK THINK I AM AN EXCELLENT COOK =) *CHEERS! THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE=)

This cake was all right, but I didn't find it 'fantabulous'. What it's got going for it is that it is incredibly easy to make, and you can enjoy an almost-homemade coffeecake with a little time and effort. I found the icing to be a bit much (enough to drown the cake) and halved it with plenty enough to drizzle.

I have made this cake 3 times now.  The first time I followed the recipe to a tea, it was too dense for me, I like the moist cake like texture of the cake without the sour cream.  So I make the cake mix and swirl in the brown sugar and cinnamon, I like it much better like this.  Everyone love this cake at my house and everyone has different tastes and they love it!

I think you have to really like cinnamon to like this cake.  Maybe if I had added some pecans to the brown sugar mixture I would've liked it more.  I served it to 9 at a gathering and 4 really liked it others were kind and did'nt say much.  I had a bite of it warm (couldn't stand the suspense and liked it way better than when cold)!

I was happy that it didn't taste like cake mix, it was great.  I used low-fat sour cream and used a bundt pan.  Tasted like a cinnamon roll, with glazed donut-like icing!  Thanks!

I'm not sure if it was human error on my part, but I didn't like this cake. It was way too sweet for my taste, if I make it again I will use some of the suggestions in the reviews and cut down on the sugar.

This was a very good cake.  Very much like  a coffee cake.  Had to give it 5 stars since it was gone in 24 hours.  Ran out of sour cream, so I added vanilla instant pudding to make up the difference - worked perfectly!

Everyone loved this recipe.  I was embarrassed at how easy it was and how great it tasted. I took it to a coffee social at church. I baked it in a pampered chef's batter bowl and decorated like a coffee cup using pipe cleaners for a handle and placing it on a decorative plate. I did add cool whip at the last minute making it appear to be a latte. Everyone thought it looked great and then wanted the recipe after tasting it.

Very good.  My daughter doesn't like a lot of sweets, but she loved this cake.  This was a very easy cake to make, and would be a huge hit at a potluck.

Loved this recipe.  My husband has an identical twin, and even though they look alike they don't have the same tastes.  I had to find a cake that wasn't chocolate, and this sounded perfect.  The only thing I did was cut back on the liquid, and add more brown sugar.  (I actually used splenda and a brown sugar substitute, and it was just fine).  I will gladly make this cake again.

Delicious.  I've made this twice.  Instead of pouring all of the cinnamon mixture in the middle, I pour half, and use the remainder to top the cake.  Cinnamon-sugar goodness.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday, it was extremely sweet, even for him... and he's a real sweet tooth. Along with the glaze, I put a very thin coat of frosting to make it look pretty. All in all, pretty disappointing. It has already met our garbage disposal. Sorry. :o(

I asked my friend for the recipe after I tasted it and absolutely loved it.  I think the frosting is too much, so I would recommend one cup of sugar instead of two.  I would also suggest putting the frosting on right after it comes out of the oven so that the cake absorbes some of it (not a frosting,but a glaze...ymmmmm).
My friend also recommended adding an extra 50% of both the cinnamon and brown sugar...great idea!  Oh, and to use dark brown sugar since it's richer.

Is a definite keeper.

Oh my gosh...this is a great recipe. I make it frequently for church potlucks (which we have every week, so I'd say I do this about once a month) because it's easy and SO good! It's devoured every time. You can't go wrong with this.

This cake was fabulous. I got many great comments.  I took it to work and the people loved it and are asking for it again.  The only thing I personally would do is add some nuts!!  Then it would be more like a cinnamon roll!  Yummy-will make again for sure!!!

After trying over 1/2 of the coffee cake recipes on this site...this one is "THE BEST"!  On occassion I add mini chocolate chips and toffee bits sprinkled on top.  Beautiful served in two 9" pie plates-bake for 25-30 minutes. Be careful not to overbake.

This was a great cake. Easy and good. I took this cake to our youth group function and brought nothing home. My son is now begging me to make it again, and I had many parents asking for the recipe. I made it just as the recipe said, and I would change nothing. Maybe add pecans. Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was just ok.  It doesn't take anything like a honey bun.  It tastes like yellow cake mix with cinnamon in it.  Would not make again.

This cake is very easy to put together and quite tasty. I followed reviewers suggestions about the amount of brown sugar - i used 3/4 cup and it wasn't too sweet. I also used a yellow butter cake mix because that was as close as I could find at the store, and I used cream cheese frosting. Mine was finished baking after only 35 minutes, and it smelled so wonderful while baking! Thanks Jennifer for such a yummy recipe!

Another 5 Stars!!! I took some of this cake to the guys I work with and they loved it! One of them told me that he would pay me to make him one. I started to give him the recipe and then I said nawwwww, let me get the glory for it for a little while longer. I'll make them another one first. Thanks so much Jennifer!!!

Oh my gosh this was so good. I cut out some of the fat by using Egg Beaters instead of the 4 eggs and you would never even know the difference. I also took some advice and used only 1/2 of the brown sugar in with the cinnamon and it was plenty sweet. Thanks for this easy and tasty recipe!

The taste of this cake is addictive. Unfortunately, with all that added sugar, it hits your stomach like a rock once you've over indulged in all that yumminess. Be careful how much you eat at one time! :) I think I'd do as other person suggested, halving the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture. Other commentor is correct; don't worry about top layer of mix being gloppy. Swirling it with a butter knife blends it beautifully.

This cake smelled great when baking, and my son, who has a sweet tooth, loved it.  The rest of the family would have preferred a little more cake with their sugar.  After all, you're adding 3 extra cups of sugar to an already-sweet cake mix.

The cake was just OK.  I had a lot of trouble smoothing out the top layer of cake over the brown sugar mixture so I ended up just mixing the top layer with the brown sugar.

This cake deserves 20 stars it is SOOOOO good!  I made this and could not believe how delicious it was.  I gave some to a few of my family members then wished I hadn't when mine was all gone!  My family thought it was great.  I can't wait to make more.  My sister said this was much better than a honey bun!  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!!!

I made this for my family and they liked it but it is very sweet.  It is easy to make but too sweet for me. UPDATE: I made this for Army Soldiers and they loved it. I made it according to the directions; in a cake pan but forgot the icing. The Soldiers loved it but agreed the icing would have been too much.

I don't have a clue what a honeybun is but this recipe sounded so good I had to try it.  How fabulous!  It is so quick and easy to make, too. This will be my new standard! Don't get discouraged when you are adding the second half of the batter over the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture.  It didn't seem like I had enough to cover but I just kept working at it.  Remember that you are to run a knife through the batter anyway so don't worry how it looks.  Also, my cake caved in a bit while baking -- trust me -- it didn't matter to those who gobbled it up!  I thought 1 tablespoon of vanilla sounded like too much for the frosting but after the cake sat and cooled a bit, it tasted just perfect. Thanks!

This was a real treat - light, warm, sugary. Not sure I did everything right though - the icing came out very thin, so I didn't use it (cake was still good without), and the batter was very thick, which made spreading it over the sugar-cinnamon layer a challenge. Still, this is a wonderful, tasty cake!

Very yummy.  We thought it was more like a moist cinnamon cake as honey buns are more doughy and this is definately cake.  It is sweet and I followed the recipe exactly but wouldn't change a thing.  It is even good the next couple days if you have any leftover!!! :)

EASY, EASY, EASY!!!  I have made this cake three times in the last two weeks.  It is so moist and is even good (though very fattening) in the morning with coffee.  This is a recipe that you most likely have the ingredients on hand always so it can be made very quickly and also served warm so no need to plan ahead.  I am so glad to have found this recipe.

Simply the easiest, tastiest cake I have served my family in a long time. Although it is not a "diet" cake, I did use fat-free cream cheese, so that I didn't feel as guilty. This cake does not last around my family and probably won't at your house either.  Great honey bun taste!

The cake was d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s! My aunt has always made this cake at family gatherings. Now, I can make my own. My sister loved it and she made this cake for her dorm and they loved it also. Thanks.

I thought this cake was ok. It was entirely too sweet and very crumbly. Really, it's mostly sugar. I am not sure where most people buy their honey buns from, but I've never tasted one like this. My husband liked it, but I won't make it again. It gave me a tummy ache, I felt like a kid after eating too much candy.

My hubby loved this, and so did I!  Like other people, I only used about half of the brown sugar mixture and half of the icing.  The icing was a little sweet, so next time I'll probably try a cream-cheese based icing.  Overall, it was an easy way to dress up a cake mix! Yummy!

This was very moist. I think it tasted just like a cinnamon bun more than a honey bun. I will make this again and again though. Too easy and too good to pass it up!!!

Very good coffee cake flavor. This was a big hit with my family. Would be good with chopped pecans stirred in the batter. This is definitely a sweet cake -- cut it into small servings.

Excellent, and addicting!  I did take the advice of the other reviewers and halved the recipe of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture.  I added pecans, and topped it off with the "Clone of a Cinabon" icing.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I'm assuming this was a great cake, I took it to work and it was gone before I could get a slice! I've already. I looked real moist and smelled so buttery and good. I did substitute butter for  vegetable oil,added vanilla butter nut extract and drizzled warm butter cream frosting on top. The next time I make this I will have to take a slice for myself first!

Really good but almost too sweet and if it's even possible, almost too moist. I have a sweet tooth, but I could only eat a very small serving of this cake.

Fabulous Cake!! The 3-year-old loved it, the 8-year-old loved it, the grandparents loved it. I, personally, don't really care for honey buns or cinnamon buns. I made this cake for my family. But after tasting it, I also devoured it. I only had skim milk and fat free sour cream in the house, so I used that. Otherwise I followed the exact recipe for the sugar and icing. I baked it until it was a deep golden brown. The cake was not too sweet for any of us. It was perfect, and it was unbelievably tender and moist and bursting with flavor. Thanks a million for the recipe!

I made this last weekend. Nothing spectacular but pretty good. I didn't use the frosting. I just sprinkled more of the cinammin/brown sugar mixture on the top. It came out pretty good. I would make it again.

I substituted the oil with apple sauce.  I ate it right out of the oven because it smelled so good, but it tasted more like apple cake (probably because of the apple sauce).  But when the cake had completely cooled, it tasted like real cake.  It was even better the next day.  My suitemates all hogged the cake.  It disappeared in two or three days.

this cake kicked boo-tay! we loved it! my son thought that less cinnamon was in order next time. (it could be a bit on the spicy side for some kids). i would make this again. it was so moist, and the sour cream really makes it tasty. try this one. it took very little time, and was inexpensive to make. honey buns rock the house!

WOW!!  This cake is so delicious!  My husband and co-workers loved it!  Yes, it is best warm out of the oven, but the cake is still amazing several days after first making it.  I rarely give a recipe 5 stars all around - this cake deserves it!

This cake is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!! The only thing I did different was to use only one cup of powdered sugar for the icing, and when I remove it from the oven I use a meat fork and punch holes in it while still warm, then pour the icing over the top.

I made this for my husband's "Guys Weekend Out" party for 10 men.  I made 8 dishes and 3 desserts (all from Allrecipes.com).  Out of them all, this was the HIT!  What is so amazing, is in my preparation of all the other dishes, I forgot to add the icing for this cake and they still thought it was the BEST!  Needless to say, this recipe is going with me to every party.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I was wary of this recipe at first because I usually don't like cakes that start with a mix... but this was GREAT!!  I know I will make this one again.  It's sticky and super sweet, just like a honey bun.

Came out perfect! To start off, since the cake mix is a few ounces short I added the same amount of sour cream and oil. I also added 2 tablespoons of honey because I wanted a bit more sweet and it is Honey bun cake after all. I baked this in a bundt cake and followed the rest of the recipe. 
I added half the mix, then the brown sugar/cin mix then the rest of the batter. I baked it at 325 for 40 minutes and it was still too liquidy so I turned the heat up to 350 for a few extra minutes and it baked all the way through and came out perfect. Very easy as well, this took almost no time at all to mix together and throw in the oven.

The cake turned out great. I substituted a butter cake mix for the yellow but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I ran into 2 problems. 1st, a 9x13 pan is a little too large. After layering the brown sugar I didn't have enough batter to cover the top so I just mixed it all up in the pan. A 11x9 would be better. Secondly the cook time isn't long enough. I needed another 6 minutes or so. Other than that it was excellent. If you use a smaller pan, check it starting at 40 mins and continue to bake accordingly.

2 of us ate it, but thought it was just ok, the third person disliked it so much he didn't eat it.  Other than making it in a bundt pan, I made it per the instructions.  Found it overly sweet and not much flavor.  Was very easy to make though.

Delicious cake, however, I would make several changes next time.  I would use half of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. I would also make half of the glaze.  Way too much of both and it made it sickeningly sweet.

Oh yes, this is a good one! Super easy and delicious. I've made it about 6 times now and get  requests for the recipe! Each time I've made it in a bundt pan. I layer the brown sugar and cinnamon with crushed walnuts on the bottom of the pan and in the middle.  Sometimes I sprinkle some on the top of the batter as well and then really swirl it. I cook mine at 325 for 70 minutes, but my pan is dark. I let it cool for 30 minutes and then invert on a plate. I let it cool almost completely before I glaze it. I made half and used 3T butter, 1 cup confectioners sugar, 1.5 t vanilla and a few drops of milk to get the right consistency . . . Enough that it drizzles down the sides. So yummy!!!!

I guess my taste is different than reviewers here. Just tasted like a box cake with brown sugar cinnamon in the middle. Nothing special to me.  Won't make again.

I tried this today to take to my daughter-in-law's and it turned out great! I did substitute real butter instead of oil and used a mixer because I didn't feel like trying to mix it well by hand. I also used a bundt pan and gave it a new name so my tech savvy family can't Google the recipe. Lol. Thanks for sharing!

Made this to send to work and they loved it.  Only change was I had an orange cake mix not a yellow mix. I think it added to the flavor.  Made it in a bundt pan and glazed the top.

This has become my favorite cake.  It's easy to make and is delicious.  My son even made it for me for my birthday and he is not a cook.

My daughter and I made this as a Saturday morning bonding project. I followed the recipe exactly as is however I did add some of the brown sugar and cinnamon mix to the bottom and around the pan. I also added pecans inside the cake.  I am not a cake eater but this was good. I will certainly make this again. Maybe as a cupcake treat.

good recipe. quick and easy. made in a bundt pan and still cooked at 325 for 40 min. i cut the brown sugar/cinnamon in half and left out the icing completely and it was plenty sweet! oh, I also didn't have sour cream so that was left out too. Will make again. Thanks for sharing :)

I did't make any changes  but next time I will add the sugar-cinnamon mixture in layers or swirl into a portion of batter as it hung together too tightly.  Overall this cake is excellent and my coworkers raved about it.

We call this the incredible disappearing cake in our house. I cut back on the oil to 1/2 cup and a 1/4 cup water. I make it in a bundt pan and I don't frost it. I put a little batter in the bottom then the filling and the rest of the batter.

I don't know if it tastes exactly like those packaged honeybuns I used to eat as a kid, but it is delicious.  Easy to make, and best served a little warm.  This is one of those recipes that shows that you don't have to be terribly fancy to be delicious.

I substituted half the sour cream for vanilla yogurt.   The family loved it but it was a little too sweet with the frosting.

Delicious! I made it just as written except at my husband's request, I put maple extract in place of vanilla for the frosting.

Fast and easy. And it really tastes like I went all out to make it!

Delicious!  Made it for our company who completely devoured the cake.  Caution should be used to not over mix it as the longer you mix it, even by hand, the more flaky the cake becomes and I was aiming for a slightly denser cake.  Very good, I will definitely make this one again!

I have made this cake too many times to count.  I'm adding to the reviews because I feel like it's the least I can do considering how many times this cake has made me look good.  I've done cupcakes, which were a little more work, spooning batter into each cupcake, sprinkling the brown sugar/cinnamon mix in the center and topping each with batter, but they were as good as the larger cakes. I only use DH butter recipe golden. I've tried other cake mixes and I've shared the recipe with others who accused me of leaving out a "secret" ingredient.  It's the cake mix.  No other cake mix makes this cake taste as good. I baked it for a friend once who pretended she'd made it herself.  When her co worker asked her to bake one for her, she asked me to make another one!! Really??? I gave her the recipe but I don't think she made it.  Nobody believes this cake can be as good as it is and easy too.  It is!!!!

Loved it! I reduced sugar by using  less than 1/2 cup brown sugar Splenda, and instead of sour cream used  whole milk with 1 1/2 tab lemon juice. Half the frosting. Decreased oil. It's wonderful.  Carmen

Made this last night for our church group.  It was still warm when I served it.  Oh, my word, they went nuts about it.  Several said it was the best cake they had ever eaten.  It was so easy and so delicious.  Definitely a repeat!!! Also, I took the knife and swirled circles so it actually looked like a pan full of cinnamon rolls.  Several ladies commented how pretty it looked. (another review talked about her cake not looking very pretty)

Very sweet but good!  It would be great with a cup of coffee or some vanilla ice cream to cut the sweetness a little.  I used nonfat Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream only because I was out and cut the confectioner's sugar in the glaze down from 2 cups to 1/4 c and it was still PLENTY SWEET.  Next time I may cut the brown sugar from 1 cup down to 3/4 cup.  I made it in a bundt pan and it took 50 minutes to bake through.

My guests loved this just as the recipe was stated.  However, we decided that it also made a great breakfast coffee cake and an individual serving could be microwaved 20 sec. and was perfect.

As I was paging through my Allrecipe recipe box, I was shocked that I never reviewed this Honey bun cake. This is a tried and true recipe in my house. My son asks me to make this for his birthday every year and sometimes it is just a Sunday dessert. Even my chocolate-cake-only lover husband has started in on it. Love this cake!

This is so good and easy! I let my younger brother make this recipe for Christmas. It was the first time he ever made anything. And everyone raved about this cake. It tastes like a coffee cake to me, would be really good for a breakfast. Plan to make another one tomorrow to take to a New Years get-together.

I made this cake over the weekend, instead of caek mix I used homemade batter. Cake was very moist and sweet, although not sure why it's called Honey Bun cake, should be Cinnamon Coffee cake, neverthless it was a great hit in my household. Will make again.

I don't know what to say about this recipe.  I made it once and it was really good, everyone loved it.  Then the next two times I made it, it did not turn out ... the top of the cake got too heavy with the brown sugar and stuck to the pan, and it broke apart trying to get it out of the pan.  So I don't know that I will attempt this one again even though I know it can work out perfectly and that it is really good, just don't think I'll risk it.

I got many compliments!  i used 3/8 c applesauce and 3/8 c canola oil, which worked well and made it even more moist!  used light sour cream, which was fine.  also cut brown sugar back to 3/4 c.  i split it into two 9" cake pans, baking time was about the same.  tried to layer the two (after icing each side) and it fell apart a little, but still tasted wonderful!

This was a great cake. I took it to a church potluck and everyone raved about it. I was talking with a group of people as they told me how wonderful the cake was, that it was the best cake ever. Our leader came up and said, "what the Honey Bun Cake?", then he turned to me and said, "see all I heard was 'the best cake' and I knew it was the Honey Bun Cake". It was moist and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake is the BOMB!!! I make it in a 9x13 pan and bake at 325 for 40 minutes and it is truly the best! Eat it warm or rewarmed - should be in a bakery.

This recipe is fabulous. The housed melt great as it was baking. The next day when we sliced it I was thinking this better be good and it was. My husband couldn't stop eating it. This is a definite keeper.   As as the frosting is concerned I only used 3 tabs of milk and it was just "runny" enough.

I made this for a friend's birthday. It was a Sunday afternoon & this is a really nice cake for a brunch because it kind of tastes like a cinnamon roll.  It was a big hit. Several people said it was their new favorite cake.  I made it in a bundt pan so it came out really pretty too!  Took about an hour to bake, not 40 minutes

Absolutely delicious! I also made this in a bundt pan and found I had to add about 8 more minutes to the time. I layered batter and cinnamon/sugar topping as suggested by another reviewer. I also added 2 1/2 ounces of cream cheese to the icing. It made it soooo much better!!! It took away some of the sweetness and added a richness instead.

This is teriffic!  My 15-year-old grandson's favorite cake.  Everyone wants the recipe.  I changed the topping just a little.  I add a melted tablespoon or so of real butter, cut back on the milk and the vanilla (I think a tablespoon is way too much.  Sometimes I add some cinnamon to taste (grandson likes cinnamon also).

I have tried this cake several times and to no avail.  I can't stand boxed cake mixes and I will not make any recipe here that calls for it.  I went against better judgement and tried it as the recipe stated and I got a mushy mess no matter how long I cooked it.  I then tried it with my tried and true homemade ingredients (for a basic yellow cake) it was awful as well.  It also is sickening sweet...Sorry, I don't usually leave critical reviews but this was bad

I was tempted to make this as a Bundt, as Bundts are my favorite, but I went with my gut and made this in a 13x9 before school this morning.  I made a batch of the icing this recipe calls for, knowing that a full tablespoon was way too much vanilla.  My fiance and I both gagged when we tasted it, thank god I didn't frost it first!  I dumped that and made the Vanilla Glaze off of this site, which turned out perfectly!  My lucky classmates got to try it while it was still warm.  It was a winner all the way around!

One of the best tasting cakes...very moist.  Easy to make. Made mine in a silicone bundt pan and baked for 45 minutes...came out perfect!  Have already been asked to forward the recipe...everyone loved it.

This cake tasted OK but very sweet. It says not to spray the pan which ended in a mess. Half the cake was on the top of the bunt pan. It turned out to look like a coffee cake.

This cake is hazardous to your health!  Holy cow it's so good I can't quit eating it!  I took the leftovers to work so I wouldn't eat it ALL!  I DID make it in a bundt pan with no problems at all.  I thoroughly coated the pan with home-made 'cake release' (equal parts cooking oil, shortening and flour), only let it cool in the pan for only about 20 minutes, and it came right out.  Beautiful too.  I used 1/2 light sour cream and might try making with applesauce instead of oil (just to help with those pesky calories and fat!)  But is is WONDERFUL as is!

Excellent! Sooo yummy! I used Butter Pecan cake mix instead and it still turned out great. It was a hit at our family gathering. I did butter the bottom of the pan before adding the mix. Will definitely make again! Thanks!

It had good flavor, but it was almost too moist.   Next time I think I would cut the cinnamon and sugar filling in half.  And, I didn't use all of the frosting.

Delicious. Does taste a lot like honey buns. Will be making again; next time, I'll try it as a bundt rather than 9x13.

Very good and it was a hit for Thanksgiving breakfast.  I was looking for something that I could serve to company and not have cook that morning.

This was a huge hit. The lid popped off my cinnamon, so a lot more went in than was supposed to, but didn't hurt it a bit!! I added walnuts because I have a lot to use up, and it got gobbled up at work.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I did put some of the brown sugar mix into the greased bundt pan before pouring in the batter layer and will continue to do that. I did not use the icing for the cake because it was used for more of a coffee cake. It needs to be warmed up before eating though.

This tastes really lovely. The only problem i had which was probably a fault of my own that after the sugessted 40mins baking time the middle was still soft so i put it on the bottom shelf reduced the temperature for another 20min. But everyone loves it oh yeah and i didnt add the full cup of brown sugar i thought it would be tooo sweet

Had high hopes for this cake. Did not really enjoy it and probably would not make again. Had a not-so-good after taste..Not sure if it was the oil or what, but definitely not enjoyable.

I cut the icing in 1/2 for a bundt pan.  The bundt size took 50-53 minutes to bake.  I sprayed it well and let cool slightly before flipping it out.  Cool before icing.

I made mine in a loaf pan (which turned out great after 45-50 mins).  Everyone that tried this cake loved it.  I cut back on the brown sugar, which I now wish I hadn't, because it wasn't sweet enough for me.  Next time I will do a better job swirling my brown sugar mixture in :)

Excellent!  I don't usually bake a lot of cakes, but this one is definitely a keeper.  I used low fat sour cream since that is what I had on hand and still tastes wonderful.

This was super good!! I made mini bundts and my kids went nuts for them. I only got to glaze a few because they were eating them as they were coming out of the oven! Whoa!! I followed the recipe to a T! Thx so much for a nice spin on a box cake mix.

This cake was good, but I was very bothered by the amount of oil; it had an oily aftertaste. I compared this recipe to a Sock-it-to-me cake recipe I had which was very similar, but with only 1/3 cup of oil. This recipe made with  1/3 cup of oil earns 5 stars from me and my family. In fact, my husband and my 6-yr old son have both requested this for their birthday instead of traditional birthday cake.

This is a really good sweet cake! Tastes just like the honey bun sweet rolls. I did use a Bundt pan and used only half the glaze,brushed it on with a pastry brush evenly over sides and top. otherwise followed the recipe as written My family couldn't leave it alone! Good with coffee or a glass of milk!

I made this per the instuctions and it turned out wonderful! So moist! It only lasted a couple of days, but I think it got even better the longer it sat. Next time I am going to use clear vanilla, as regular vanilla made my icing a little dark. However, that didn't seem to bother anyone else who ate this cake with reckless abandon.

I never would have guessed a cake mix cake would taste just like a honey bun, especially with simple ingredients. I also baked in a bundt pan with sugar sprinkled in the pan in the middle of the cake, and on top (which would end up being the bottom when you flipped it over). I was out of powdered sugar so I used extra cream cheese frosting I had in the fridge. mmmmmm...mmmmm thank you for this recipe!

Very good and tasty. Followed recipe just the way it was written. The recipe did say a 9x13 pan but all the pictures showed a bundt cake pan and that is what I used still came out tasting great. Will try a different pan next time.

I thought this cake was okay....It didn't really taste like a honey bun to me, more like a boxed cake with an extra sweet icing. Will probably not make again unless I need a quick dessert and I have all the ingredients on hand.

Whatever you do, DO NOT take this as a general cake recipe. I made cupcakes and they sank under the weight of the sugar, BUT it just meant that I couldn't give them away and had all of them to myself! YUM!

This was very good.  I'm so glad because I made them for my sister's baby shower as a take home favor.  I made two batches in 10x17" pans one with raisins the other without.  It took about 20 minutes to bake.  I gave the bars in individual bags with a note about celebrating a bun in the oven and a hot bun picture.

WOW. This is my new go-to breakfast, brunch, and afternoon cup-of-coffee cake. I will never make a coffee-cake again! DEFINITELY make it in a fluted bundt pan - beautiful, EASY, and so tempting!! Definite new favorite.

sorry, this cake lacks flavor for me. not sure what to do to give it the little something extra, but i think i'll just let it be and try another bundt cake recipe. on the plus side, the cake was very moist, but again, had much less flavor than i anticipated. a bit "blah".

This is a wonderful cake! My husband asked me how many pieces he could have. That is a huge complement! My teenage son loved it as well. I'm am not a big fan of cakes but I love this one! I will definitely be making it again!  Thank you for sharing!!

Nice and moist, very cinnamony. I took it to work and everyone wanted the recipe. I will probably make again because it is easy and quick.

I put a little too much batter on the bottom so I had to get creative with my swirling to mix it through the cake, and it didn't end up the prettiest thing... however, everyone who tried it said that it was like a cinnamon bun, "Only better"!  I'll definitely make it again!

I thought that this cake was good, not great. It was too sweet- wish I had added less sugar! I didn't even bother w/ the icing b/c it was that sweet. I like a more traditional coffee cake, so I don't think that I'll make this again unless I'm in a rush.

MMMMMMMM....this cake is awesome. I baked one yesterday for church and everybody raved. I would not change a thing with this recipe. I baked this in a bundt pan and had to cook it a tad longer than the recipe called for--around 55 minutes or so. Definitely a keeper!

That was delicious and devoured by everyone (sweet lovers and non sweet lovers!.  Used clone of cinnabon frosting and added some chopped almonds to the sugar mix but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  Making a second one the next day!  Thanks for a great and easy cake!

This was so easy to make. I sprayed a bundt pan with spray canola oil and cooked for 45 minutes. Other than that followed the exact recipe. The icing gave me a little trouble, needs a little trial and error. Pretty cake when you cut it on the inside. This was a little too sweet for my sweet tooth, think I will play around with the brown sugar amounts next time. Lots of potential with this one.

This is a  very moist and  delicious cake. I did add a little orange juice about 1/4 of a cup
 to the batter. And  I used
orange juice in the frosting instead of
milk. To me it added to the flavor of the
recipe.

I made this cake Saturday night to have something sweet around the house, by Sunday morning it was GONE!  Me & my husband as well as the kids LOVED it... tastes great right out of the oven or warmed a bit if it lasts long enough to cool!  If you're taking this to a party, beware, it'll likely be gone - you may wanna carry 2! ;)

This recipe is sooo good. Too bad I made it for a birthday and not just for us. I will have to make this one again.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and put the brown sugar mixture on the bottom of the bundt pan. It warrants 5 stars, but there is always something better. This recipe will not let you down.

This is a wonderful and easy cake.  Very, very, sweet!!  Goes great with a glass of milk or a bowl of vanilla icecream.  The only thing I did different was I added 1/2 cup of fine chopped pecans to the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture.  It was great.

This was sooo yummy, although I think it is better as a breakfast cake than a dessert.  I followed the recipe exactly but used a greased and floured bundt pan (baked for 55 mins). Next time I will mix all the ingredients together instead of layering. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that my glaze did not come out the way others' did in their pictures. It slid down the cake immediately and gathered at the bottom. Still tasted great though!!

I followed the recipe as provided and was very happy with the results.  For those who enjoy sweet, cinnamon desserts...you will love this!  It is quick, simple, and delicious.  I plan to keep the recipe handy for those times I crave cinnamon rolls but don't have the time to make them.

This cake is awesome.  I have made it for work and they rave over it.  My daughter won her schools baking contest in fifth grade with this.  VERY GOOD considering that her school goes all they way up to twelvth grade.  I'm back again for the recipe because they keep asking for it and I can't find it. Thanks!!!!

great cake, quick and easy to put together. I usually add pecans to the filling. everyone who has tasted it ask for the recipe. Very sweet, taste more like a cinnamon roll than a honey bu to me.

This tastes like a danish. I used a homemade cake mix instead of the boxed kind due to personal tastes. One of my new favorite desserts!

Wow, this is a yummy cake. I used a white cake mix since that's what I had, and the frosting I took the advice of using the clone a cinnabon, and it was wonderful. At home we enjoyed it and at work it was gone so quick,and so many raves. It looks nice also, when you cute into it the swirls of brown sugar. 
Great thanks.

This was pretty sweet. I used a bundt pan. All we tasted was brown sugar and sweetness. No real flavors outside of sugar... This was more like a glorified coffe cake, and not even as good.

My husband rated this cake.  He said it was better than a Honey Bun.  I took his word for it since I haven't ever had one.  I took half of it to work and it didn't last past the first break!

Only change I made was I used olive oil instead of veggie oil because I was out of veggie oil.  I also made it in a regular metal 9X13 pan.  The kids loved it.  I can't wait to try it in a bundt pan.

This cake is absolutely the best! My family is STILL raving and asking when I am going to make another one!
I followed the recipe exactly but I used 2/3 tub of vanilla frosting instead of making the frosting.
This recipe is a keeper!

I loved this recipe!  I read reviews of others saying that it didn't taste much like a cinnamon roll, so I just added more cinnamon than called for in the brown sugar mixture and then saved some to sprinkle on top of the glaze too.  I thought it tasted wonderful and very cinnamon roll-like.

This is a really good and really easy cake, but it didn't really taste like a cinnamon roll to me..maybe it needs more cinnamon?  And my cake came out really short (but fluffy), not high like the picture.  I didn't use any frosting but my family thought it tasted yummy anyways.

I can't imagine eating it for dessert, but it's absolutely perfect for breakfast or brunch. Just a sweet, cinnamony coffee cake, really. This is extremely easy to make, and I've probably made it about a half dozen times now. The recipe needs no 'fixing', it comes out perfect as is. Very highly reccomended...

I made this in a 9x13 pan and this couldn't have been simpler.  It tasted better the next day, after melding a bit.  I think next time I'll mix the cinnamon/sugar mixture in a bit more so it isn't so much like a struesel cake.  This was very moist and everyone loved it.

This cake was so good. It's easy and the sour cream makes the cake so so moist. People will think you did so much work to create this yummy cake but you dont. If you like cinnamon and honey bun you'll love this cake. I did!!!

Seems like ever since my co-worker brought one of these to work for a birthday, we gals just can't make enough of them.  I like to add pecans to the middle and "top" of this bundt pan style cake. Taking one to my OB-Gyn doc tomorrow as treat for her office staff (after three deliveries with multiple complications, those hard-working gals deserve a special thank you!) Thanks for this keeper recipe

I really thought this was going to be fantastic with all the positive reviews and was excited to make it.  However, I thought it was way too sweet.  Tasted like a yellow cake with an overload of cinnamon and sugar.  Sorry, but I won't be making this one again.

Well after spending tons of time reading all of the reviews & deciding what changes to make to the recipe, I went to my cupboard to get the yellow cake mix and lo & behold if I didn't find a Betty Crocker Super Moist Cinnamin Swirl cake mix (there was a big sale and I stocked up a couple of months ago.)  It is basically this very recipe --a yellow cake mix with a separate pouch containing brown sugar & cinnamin.  So I just used that and followed some of the suggestions I found here in the recipe reviews. I baked it in a sprayed bundt pan, beginning with 1/3 of the sugar/cinnamin mixture (to which I added 1/2C of crushed walnuts, then half the batter, swirled in 1/3 sugar/cinnamin and repeated.  Ater baking & cooling 10 minutes, I made a glaze of 1 cup powdered sugar, 1T milk and 2T strong coffee, and drizzled it on while still warm.  (I didn't use all of it) Delicious!

This was absolutely great!!  I followed the directions exactly except for I just mixed the brown sugar and cinnamon in all at once.  I also only used 1/2 the icing.  I don't have a bundt pan but may buy one just for this!

I made this a week ago and my husband and I loved it! It was addictive. I was going to add nuts to the batter but I forgot. So I toasted some pecans that I had and just added them to each individual serving. I also added a lot more milk to the icing as it was very thick. I made a bundt cake and just poured on the icing as a glaze. It was a very good cake !

Huge hit at the office.  I followed the recipe all the way.  Used a slightly different glaze that I found in another cookbook, but I doubt it made much difference.  Great cake!

This is a very good cake!  I was a little dissapointed at the texture.  I was expecting something closer to the honey buns and it was more of a coffecake.  Still a very good tasting cake and couldn't ask for anything much easier.  My 13 year old son made this as I had to be somewhere and he thought it was easy enough even for him.  Whole family loved, even my picky husband who doesn't eat much sweets.

Made this recipe several times already in the last few weeks since I found it. Have tried reducing oil and sugar and found a happy medium now. Using only 1/2 cup veg oil and 3/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar but increased cinnamon to 2 tbsp because the boyfriend, his really picky eater son, future in-laws and I of course, all love cinnamon. We all rave over this recipe. Have used white, french vanilla, golden vanilla (all came out fantastic) and butter yellow (not as good)cake mixes. P.S...reducing brown sugar below 3/4 cup makes the cinnamon swirl less gooey.

This was very good. Like some of the other it can be a bit too sweet, but with a cup of joe it could do very well. All and all it was moist, and i sprayed my pan so it came out easily.

I know This recipes has been reviewed by hundreds of cooks, but I also wanted to leave my 2-cents. This cake is perfect with coffee, as a  snack or dessert with ice cream. It is best tasting the day-after it was baked in my opinion. I'll be making this as part of my day-after christmas brunch- and I can't imagine it won't be  a total hit.

This cake tastes more like a cinnamon roll than a honey bun, but either way, it was DELICIOUS! I constantly like to make different types of cake that noone in my family does, and this is one of those unique ones!.. I used fat free sour cream & I also made two layers of cake so the icing was just enough! I couldn't get it to look like a honey bun though =(.. Thanks for the recipe Jennifer!

Easy, good cake.  I def think the icing took away from the cake. Next time I'll only use a bit of it in a very thin glaze.

This was so yummy! I made this last night to take to someone's house for a basketball game. Well, my boyfriend (and I) got into it when it was still warm! It was very good just out of the oven. Next time, I will probably try light sour cream or lowfat plain yogurt and see if the great flavor is still there without some of the fat. I wondered if you could substitute applesauce for the oil, as you can in some recipes? Or decrease the amount of oil, without losing the great taste. I will definitley make this bad boy again!

wow!!!! i didnt think it was going to be this good...but it was! My fiance and I ate the whole thing in 2 days!! and we are the eat healthy low fat diet type couple....I couldnt resist on this one. I cut back on the brown sugar and icing a bit...but i think next time I will use the amount suggested on the brown sugar and cinnamon (as this was the best part) and cut down on the icing..sooooo good esp when warm! thanks

A favorite at work!  Easy to make and take in the morning.  I had a problem making this recipe in Denver, because of the altitude and couldn't get the recipe adjusted.

Taste is great!  I followed others and cut down on the oil, brown sugar & icing.  I agree too that it would look prettier baked in a bundt pan.  If you bake it just for taste a 9x13 is okay.

Made this honey bun cake for my "honey bun"'s 17th birthday dinner. Took the advice of other reviewers and cut back a bit on the sugar. I also added some cinnamon to the glaze. Everyone at our gathering absolutely loved this moist and delicious cake! I'm not a sweet eater, but I even went back for seconds!! Thanks so much Jennifer and my daughter Tyler thanks you too!!!!

Pretty good but very very sweet. This was also really gooey (which is good). I liked this but next time I will use less of the cinnamon sugar mixture.  I liked the topping a lot.

I thought it was ok, but my family really loved it! My mom asked me for the recipe and has made it at least a dozen times. However we both agreed, it was way way way too much icing. I used about 1/4 of the icing and threw the rest away.

This was okay.  Instead of the frosting, I made up a mixture of crumbs (butter, flour, sugar, cinnamon)for the topping.

Am I the only one who had trouble "pouring" the second half of the batter on top of the mixture in pan??? It just sort of dropped in about 4 clumps. I swirled anyway! The cake is delicious! My family thought it was from scratch!! It would be good without the icing too!

I found this recipe only a week ago and have already made this cake twice.  My family loves it.  I also took it to a work luncheon and no one could get over how good it was.  They were begging for more!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This cake is awesome.  My 5th grader entered it in a baking contest at school for 5th-12th grades.  She won FIRST prize.  It is sooo easy that she made it right before the contest so that it was still warm when being tested.  Thanks for a new dish for potlucks and breakfast.

This is an amazing recipie that is suprisingly simple to make. I'm a 19 year old college guy and I made this for my girlfriend on her birthday. Trust me, if I can do it, anyone can. I will be making this again because I don't think they'll let me back into the dorm without it!

It was delicious! I added an extra 1/2 c brown sugar, and a few sprinkles of cinnamon to the mix. I used lower fat (light) sour cream. Also, I added a few sprinkles of cinnamon to the glaze. It gave it a very nice flavor.  My kids loved it.  Did not need any ice cream, that is for sure!

Absolutely delicious especially if you love Cinnabon rolls.  I brought it to someone's house for dessert and every single child and adult raved about it.

Petty good if you like suger/glaze suger.  It was much too sweet for me.  However, my son who can afford to put on a few extra pounds loved it.

Very yummy!  I got this out of the all recipes cookbook and the kids picked it out first because of it's name! We all loved it!  I also made it into a Bundt cake instead as it's much prettier! Thanks!

Ok, so here is my story.  The first time I made this (last week) I read the recipe fast and thought it asked for 8oz of cream cheese.  I made it with cream cheese and it turned out wonderful.  Very good.  The second time I made this, I realized what I had done and made it the correct way.  Still very good... But I almost prefer it whith the cream cheese.  Using the sour cream made the cake moist and the cream cheese made it almost like a cinnamon roll.  Either way OUTSTANDING..

This cake was a little sweet for my taste, but all of my guests loved it and ask for the recipe. It really is best when served warm with vanilla ice cream. I'll make it again this summer and serve with homemade ice cream. Thank you for sharing your recipe. =)

I made this exactly as the recipe was written.  I was nervous about not greasing the pan, but it came out ok.  It is very, very sweet and fell apart when warm.  I think next time I will use 1/2 the brown sugar and cinnamon and will also add some nuts.  It is very good the day after and extremely moist.  I'm in charge of snacks for our Sunday school class and I will be making this cake for them next week.

Loved this recipe.  Kind of a cross between a coffee cake and a regular cake.  Took it to work, everyone loved it and 2 people asked me for the recipe.  Next time I make it I might do as another reviewer suggested and mix the brown sugar and cinammon into the batter and then pour it into pan.  Thanks for a great recipe Jennifer :)

I used some suggestions from these reviews and mine came out great.  I used butter cake mix (on sale) and made it in a bundt pan.  Wish I would have put in all the cinnamon/sugar mixture, but only put in 3/4.  Baked for 35 min. at 350, let cool in pan for 15 minutes and then put it out onto a rack.  I made a 1/2 recipe of icing and that was the perfect amount.

WONDERFUL as is but this time changed.  Used 1 egg/3 eggbeaters; and 8oz of lowfat yogurt instead of sour cream.  Turned out very moist.  We like a lot of flavor so use 2 tbls of pumpkin pie spice.  I make 1/2 of the glaze as that's plenty for us.

I made this for a bake sale at my daughter's school. I had a little trouble spreading the dry mixture evenly on top of the batter and now I know why.  I didn't read the directions and "sprinkle" not spread over the batter. O brother!!  Anyway, the cake was a hit.

Both of my sons (and 16 year old brother in law) loved it.  I liked it very well too.  While the icing definatley tasted like it came from a honey bun, the cake reminded us all more of a cinnamon donut.  But we all still enjoyed it and will make it again.  :)

This is a wonderful morning treat.  Tastes just like Hardee's Cinnamon Rolls, might even add raisins to half next time.  Serve warm for sure, re-warming in the microwave on a low heat worked great with leftovers.  Yummy!
4/23/12 Accidentally picked up a sugar-free cake mix and this still turned out great.  I find that a half batch of the icing is plenty.

Great recipe, really does taste like a honey bun.  At first I saw how much oil in the cake and how much vanilla in the glaze and I thought geez thats a bunch but it works.  I had alot of the brown sugar left over but I did use all the glaze.  Whole family agrees it taste like a honey bun, very strange that it does lol, but glad that it does. Very sweet, great with cold milk or coffee. Thanks!!!

I made this in fancy mini loaf pans and baked for about 30 minutes or so.  The mini cakes were moist and the glaze topped them beautifully.  I will make this cake again.

This was the most awesome cake!!  It was GONE in just 2 days!  (mostly because of me)  I added some coarsly chopped walnuts to half the pan, because I like them and wanted to try it.  It was great that way too!  Both were awesome!!  THANK YOU SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH FOR THIS DELICIOUS RECIPE!!

I give this cake 10 stars.  This is my first time actually rating the cake but I have made the cake at least 25 times in the past several years to everyone's enjoyment.  Family and Co-workers always make a request for more,  and for the recipe.  Thanks for a recipe that has become a family tradition.

Soooo moist, easy, and delicious!  I love this!  I used about 12 of the brown sugar, and it was still very sweet.  I used low fat sour cream.  I greased the pan, even though the recipe said to use an ungreased pan, and it worked out well. This would be great for brunch, too.

Looked bad....tasted great!! I let my 2 1/2 year old daughter help me and I think we got carried away with the stirring. I also tried this in a bundt pan; pretty sure we needed to grease and flour. Of course, I never have baked a decent cake in this high altitude.  Trust me, I'm not giving up on this recipe - it was still devoured by everyone.  I'm chalking this up (as with all my cakes) to baker's error.

I love this recipe!  I have made it twice already and have actually had requests for it.  It tastes wonderful, even if it looks strange.  I had a hard time covering the cinnamon mixture, but it turned out just fine.

Okay, I have made this cake twice in a week for work and both times the cake was gone within and hour and people complained that they never got a piece.  This really is a great recipe.  I did have to bake it longer thank 40 minutes, but careful monitoring was all that was needed.  This cake is just so good!  Give it a try.

This is rich but delicious.  I made it in a 13x9 glass pan and used 1/2 of the recipe for the icing using 1 Tbs. of honey and 1 Tbs. of milk.

This recipe does taste very close to a honey bun. Very good and extremely sweet. My husband didn't really care for it so I probably won't be making it any time soon.

Delish! Although mine took alot longer to bake ~ it was extra good! I have never eaten a honey bun (No, I don't live under a rock, LOL) so I can't compare the cake to the bun. Thanks for such a tasty recipe! :o)

Man, this was so good!!! I made a few changes though: I used the cake mix recipe listed earlier in the reviews (only I substituted 1 c. of whole wheat flour for 1 c. of the all-purpose and used fat free margerine), used egg whites instead of the whole eggs, added 1 c. of raisins, and used fat free sour cream.  I also halved the brown sugar mixture and glaze, to cut down on calories and sweetness. It came out terrific!! I will probably add nuts next time and make two layers of the brown suger mixture. I also used a bunt cake pan. Yummy

I am not convinced that this tastes exactly like a honey bun, but it is very nice, nontheless. It gets better as the days go by and is very nice with vanilla ice cream. Also, upon the second time making it, i had trouble swirling the sugar layer around, mainly because i used a larger pan. However, this caused the sugar layer to remain basically intact and created a very nice crystal texture in the middle of the cake.

OH.  My.  GOD!!!  This was so-o-o delicious.  I served it at a brunch and it was gone before half the guests had even arrived.  I have to say, it was the moistest, most flavorful cake I have ever eaten, and I generally don't even like cake that well.  I actually forgot to put the icing on because I had saved too many tasks for the last minute.  Even so, it was fantastic.  Every single person had seconds, and I can't wait to make it again with the icing.

Yep, Good cake.  Served at a baby shower and even my neice loved it. (She's a very picker eater, even when it comes to sweets). Did taste like a honey bun, but sweeter and gooeyer.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe.  I do alot of baking and if I can get away with a really simple recipe that tastes great then I'm there.  It does not, however, taste like a honey bun nor a cinnamon bun but it was very delicious.  I would defintely make this again.

This recipe was delicious. I cant make it anymore because I'll gain too much weight! Hubby & my children loved it. Don't be too alarmed about the negative ratings.....You have to appreciate a good store bought honey bun. Once you do this, one will realize how awesome this recipe really is. It taste better than what any store can sale!

After reading several reviews (thanks fellow cooks!), I too decided to reduce the brown sugar and the "topping" by half. Glad I did because it turned out perfect! My boyfriend loved this cake so much that while he was gone, my friends came over and helped polish it off.  When he came home to find the cake gone, he got mad! :) I guess that means its time to make another cake! Thanks Jennifer!

It was good, but didn't live up to the rave reviews, I thought. It was more like a coffee cake, and Aunt Anne's Coffee Cake (on this site) is way better.

This cake deserves more than 5 stars!  We absolutely loved it!  It was so moist and tasted more like a coffee cake.  The prep is quick & easy.  I used light sour cream and added a tad bit more cinammon.  I only used half of the frosting (I didn't want it to be too sweet) and I drizzled it over the cake.  I received lots of raves.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks Jennifer for sharing this awesome recipe!

This cake was very good! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and I used the "clone of a cinnabon" icing. I served this to guests with coffee and it was just delicious!

This was pretty good.  I made it for a family party last month.  It's a bit sweet and probably better for brunch.  I also reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 the amount requested.

Great recipe, easy to make.  I have made it twice now.  The first time in a nine inch round pan and then in a bundt pan.  When I did it in the bundt pan it layered the brown sugar mixture ( I redused it to 3/4 cup )and swirled it around using steak knife.  Looked great !  Thanks for the recipe.

First of all, this did not taste anything like a honey bun but, whatever...
The overall flavor was good but after putting the icing on, the cake turned into a mushy mess.
We both had a piece and threw the rest away.  I would make it again but cook it about 5-7 minutes
longer and add only half of the frosting.

This was a delicious cake.  It looked beautiful and tasted just as it looked.  My 11 year old said "Mom, I'm sorry I keep eating it but I can't keep my hands away from it"  That is a compliment because he is not big on sweets. Thanks for the recipe.

Have made this twice now - never enough to satisfy everyone! Need to make a double batch when there are lots of people around! I think it is sweet enough without the icing, depending on your tastes and addiction to sugar. haha

I thought this recipe was okay.  The cake part had a nice flavor but did not put me in the mind of a honey bun at all. I also did not care for the icing although it seems to be a typical mixture for glaze, only doubled.  It may be better once it has set for a while.  I may try this again but using the cream cheese frosting from the cinnabon recipe on this website.

This cake ROCKS!!!!!!It is soo delicious that I literally want to eat the entire cake myself.  It is possible to make it lower fat adding some applesauce for the oil and cutting back on some of the sugar.  I want to make this for everyone I know.  It is awesome.  The glaze is terrific.  You will not be disappointed.

Wonderful!  I took the advice of some and used 1/2 of the sugar, will use all next time. I also used cream cheese icing.  If you want to be the talk of your next get together make this cake.
It's a keeper. Wonderful!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I made this for my husband's office for a breakfast meeting and everyone loved it.  Instead of vanilla in the icing I added rum and they really enjoyed it.  It was very easy to make and turned out perfect.

This cake was very good, and easy to make.  It reminded me a lot of cinnamon coffee cake.  The glaze makes a whole lot, and could make your cake very sweet, and soggy after sitting for a while!  I was good, and I will make it again!

This cake was delicious.  I used a 9x13 glass dish to bake it in and followed the suggestion to cut the icing in half.  I wish I hadn't -- it wasn't enough icing.  Next time I'll use the full recipe for the icing.

This turned out to be a wonderful fluffy cake. My family loved it. I didnt add the oil and instead I added two table spoons of butter and a 3/4 cup of milk (1%) and it couldnt have come out any lighter. This is a keeper. thanks Cory

I took all the advice of other reviewers and made this for the first time for a pitch in at work. It did get very good reviews.  Everyone else liked it more than I did.  I think that is because I know how much sugar I put in it!! : ) I will make it again.

This cake is absolutely delicious!  I have never have anyone NOT go crazy over how good it tastes and ask for the recipe.  It is so quick and easy to make and it smells wonderful while baking!  One revision I made:  I found that the vanilla in the frosting was a little to overpowering, so I decrease the vanilla to one teaspoon, as opposed to using one tablespoon.

I took this cake to our Sunday School class for our brunch and it was a huge hit!!  I ended up having to give out the recipe to several people.  I think the person that usually brings the food is being replaced now. :-)  The only two things that I would change are:  1)Next time I will double the recipe  2)I ended up only using a little over half of the icing.  I think the whole recipe for the icing is a little much.  This is definitely going in my favorites box!

Very impressed with the overall result of this mix-based cake.  Tastes like a really good coffee-cake.  If you want it lighter, I'd reduce the amount of oil to follow the instructions on the back of whatever mix you are using.  And to save time, buy the frosting.  Other than that, this was a simple and delicious snacking cake!

This cake is very easy. It's one of the few cakes I've made that didn't sink in the middle! Everyone who has tried it loves it...my grandmother makes it without the icing but it's really better with it.

I made this and took it to a bbq potluck. I should have made two. Everyone there wanted the recipe.  I am taking it to work and try it on my co-worker with copies of the recipe!  One of the easiest and most moist and delicious cakes I have ever made. Definately a permanent recipe in my collection.

Yum! I didn't have any confectioners sugar, so I heated a third of a can of vanilla frosting in the microwave on high for about twenty seconds. The I spooned it over the top and spread it evenly.  This made a great glaze; very tasty. Everybody loved it, and I didn't think it was too sweet at all.  A keeper.

Very good cake, however, my pan was a little smaller so I baked it an extra 12 minutes and put the icing on as soon as I took it out of the oven.
I will make it again,  Thanks

My 13 year old daughter made this cake for us and it was delicious! I usually don't like to eat warm cakes but you couldn't stop yourself with this one!

What a treat for our mother's birthday-a real honey bun lover.  My sister made this cake and it was perfect-my mother and I have tried it but it didn't turn out as well.  There must be a trick to it. I will try again though-it is already a family favorite.

I served this after Sunday dinner at my Mom's and everyone raved! It really does taste like a honeybun. It's super easy to make and it's been put on my "favorites" list. It is very sweet, but I expected it to be. So are honeybuns!

Awesome! You'd never know this recipe includes a cake mix. Took this to work, and all remarked it was the BEST cake they've ever had, and I bake lots of cakes.  Tastes just like a honeybun/glazed donut. It is by far the sweetest cake i've ever tasted. Try it! It's definitely one of a kind!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but didn't care for it at all. It was too sweet and too thin. I didn't like the frosting or the taste of the cake despite the addition of brown sugar and cinnamon. I don't really like yellow cake mix cakes, though (chocolate are a bit better).

Mmmm....this is an absolutely delicious cake. I substituted the sour-cream with yoghurt with great results. I don't know how the original tastes but I can vouch for this one being great on taste and lower in calories.

Very easy to make.  Extremely moist and flavorful. It really doesn't need the frosting.  It's great without it. This is a keeper.

Served it warmed with a scoop of ice-cream.

I made this cake for my husband's coworkers, as I always send in baked goods when he works the weekend, and everyone raved about it. Unfortunately, no one saved any for my husband, so I will have to make it again! :)  I also adapted the recipe to lower the fat, using 1/4c oil and 1/2 c applesauce, 8 egg whites, and reduced fat sour cream.  I can't tell you what the original tastes like, but my husband came home with the most requests for a recipe that I have had yet!!!!

A BIG 2 thumbs up!! It's as delicious as it sounds.  It took no time to prepare.  The cake was just as good the next day as it was right out of the oven. Besides being a great dessert, it makes an excellent accompaniment to a hot cup of tea in the afternoon.

I thought the recipe was too sweet, but my family loved it.  We ate it heated up with some vanilla ice cream to tone down the sweetness.

Yummy!! Didn't really taste like a honey bun though..more like a cinnamony streusel cake! No matter what the name, dissappeared all the same!

This cake is AWESOME!  In just a few weeks, I have made it several times at the request of my husband.  He thought it was fantastic!  I took it to 2 family reunions and didn't not have any leftovers to bring home.  It is definitely a winner!

This is a very good cake. It is quick and easy to whip up. It's not too rich or heavy, just right! I may try using a smaller pan next time to make it thicker. Thanks Jennifer

Yum, yum, yum!  I add lots of chopped pecans in the center with the brown sugar and use a cream cheese frosting recipe for the top.

Two 9 year old friends of my daughter made this for us.  It turned out great!  There wasn't even too much mess because of the mix as a base.
