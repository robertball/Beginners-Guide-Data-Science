very nice. i'm sick with the flu and needed a really easy fast recipe. I added a clove of garlic, a bit of onion, and chopped up some fresh coriander to sprinkle over the top when i served it.

EXACTLY what I needed for a house full of sickies.  I used barley instead of noodles.  It was surprisingly easy and wonderfully satisfying!  I made this yesterday and kept it warm in the crock pot.  I put the insert with leftovers into the fridge and just put it back on today.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a great basic recipe. I used everything but the celery because I didn't have that on hand and the chicken because I don't eat meat. I made this both with regular wide egg noodles and the Reames frozen thick egg noodles and I highly recommend the Reames noodles, they really make the soup.

I wanted to make mine a little bit more heartier. So I added potatoes, asparagus, fresh garlic ( for extra cold fighting ability) and fresh basil.  YUM! 4 star rating for blandness, I found I had to add some more flavour.

My family loved this. My 15 year old even told the kids at school about it! I made homemade egg noodles, which made it a little thicker. I'll make this again for sure!

I thought this was very easy and kid friendly soup. I boiled the chicken breasts before hand with bay leaves in the water. Since they were skinless there was hardly any fat in the water. I fished out the bay leaves and added rest of ingredients plus garlic. Easy and great to warm up the next day. Next time I'll try Reames noodles for a different touch. Thanks for the recipe!

LOVE IT! But I boiled a whole chicken and used the broth. Made a large pot for family and friends and still had leftovers.   Very easy to make.  AND First time my boys ate leftovers :).

We cooked this is a slow cooker as directed. Half way through I wanted it a little thicker so I threw in a can of cream of chicken soup and a teaspoon of garlic powder for flavor. Tasted great, we all loved it!

I doubled the recipe so I could make a lot at once and freeze small portions for sick days....
Also added chopped portabella mushrooms and several cloves of garlic.  And some Tony's to make it spicier.

This recipe is the foundation of any chicken noodle soup.  I used a rotisserie chicken to make sure it was tender and flavorful - and no work!  I put the soup over mashed potatoes - mmmmm.  So, with all the carbs of the noodles and potatoes, I put much more celery and carrots in the soup than what's called for in this recipe.
