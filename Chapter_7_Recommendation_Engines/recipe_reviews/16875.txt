This is the best homemade pudding my husband and I have ever tasted...but please reduce your sugar...I find 1/2 c. sugar to 2 c. whole milk provides just the perfect backdrop for the eggs and vanilla extract to show off their flavors.  Oh my goodness, it is really that good!!!  My husband and I also think the dish could use more pudding, so next time we will increase milk to 3 c., and adjust sugar accordingly.

Yum!!  I usually use the recipe on the vanilla wafer box, but, I didn't have the wafers, yet, so...
I doubled the recipe (because I like extra...I'll share that in a minute).  I added about 1/2 tsp salt.  I cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup (1.5 cup for double recipe).  Cooked on med.hi. heat in a double boiler until it thickened, (be patient and make sure to cook at high enough heat, but not too high).
When done, I poured 1/2 of pudding into a bowl and added the vanilla (2 tsp) and chill before making the banana pudding, hot pudding has always made my wafers mushy.  The other half of the pudding stayed in the double boiler on low heat and got a good dollop of semi-sweet chocolate chips, they melt quickly and VOILA!  Delicious chocolate pudding!!  Since this is a sweet pudding, even with the sugar cut back, bittersweet chocolate chips (or cocoa powder) would be good.  I'll put this one in my recipe file, hopefully my family will carry on the YUMMM.  ;-)

I thought heaven had felled in my mouth when i made this pudding.iI was so good but i did change it a little.I didn't used the 2 c of whole milk.I used 1 c carnation milk 3/4 c of 2%milk and the rest in heavy cream to measure 2 c of milk.I did as other reviewer suggested in decreasing the sugar.I used 3/4 instead of 1 1/2 c of sugar.I believe i cooked the pudding on medium for the 1st 5 min and then decrease the temp to low for the rest of the 10 min whisking frequently in the 15 minutes.Adding cornstarch at the end to thickened it up.And then however i let the pudding refrigerate for 1hr 30 min.Once it firmed up i took it out of the frig. Layer my pan with vanilla waffer add the banana in then the  pudding.And i continue that untill it reach the top, i didn't do a meringue topping i just  place crushed vanilla waffer on top.This was my first attempt at making an homeade banana pudding becasuse i always opted for the easy instant jello way out.But i'm through with instant pudding mix this will be my one and only banana pudding recipe.Thanks a million for such a delish pudding.Yummy Yummy

Very good pudding, but cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. I like to dip the bananas in lemon juice and sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg. And the last change is to the meringue, I use 2/3 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar.

This is how my Granny made it....I only changed a couple of things. I used all the sugar-I have a BIG sweet tooth-But as my grandma used to do it instead of meringue I put one more layer of Nilla Wafers on top and served it warm. I also used Mini Nilla Wafers so my children could enjoy it-They bounced off the walls for hours! I will definately make this one again.

My family loved this Banana Pudding Pie.  I did cut back on the sugar and will cut back some more the next time.  I like this site because you can review what others have experience and make the changes for a good dish.  Overall I loved it!  Will make again.

I thought this was good. I did reduce the sugar like some of the others (which I am glad I did) But in the meringue I followed someones suggestion of 2/3 instead of a 1/2 cup (I believe) DON'T DO THIS! KEEP IT THE ORGINAL AMOUNT OF SUGAR OR A LITTLE LESS. It turned out way to sweet! But I did add Vanilla and cream of tartar (which I don't think was a bad idea). If I had of just added those 2 things and did not add more sugar to meringue the recipe would of been great. Next time I will know better :)

I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who is a "pudding snob"- I can not stand instant pudding, and prefer to not eat the boxed stuff at all.  I agree it's a good idea to cut back on the sugar and throw in a pinch of salt.

Spectacular. BUT TAKE NOTE!. That's a lot of suger!  3/4 cup should be plenty and I always add 1/4tsp cream of tartar and a splash of vanilla to my meringue. This is so good! I would say this serves 4 to maybe 6 since about half of each serving is airy meringue, so I would recommend doubling the recipe if you anticipate people wanting seconds, more generous portions, or if you're feeding more than 4 or 5 people.

A touch I experimented with and get rave reviews from the annual family reunion.  I shave some dark chocolate onto the meringue before baking it so it melts in.  It only gives a small hint of chocolate, but everyone noticed it.  Also, although it's ready almost immediately, anyone that grew up on banana pudding will tell you it's better after sitting overnight in the fridge!  That allows the cookies to soak up some of the pudding and banana flavor.   
Trust me, they'll scrap the dish clean!

I'm on a quest to find the absolute best banana pudding and since I've not tried all of them I can not say this is the best but it is definitely in the number 1 spot. Thanks for a very good recipe

I'll say right up front that this was DELICIOUS! The texture was very smooth. It was everything I was looking for. This will be the recipe I use from now on. However, it is waaaaaay too sweet. My bananas actually tasted tart next to the custard, it was that sweet. I'll cut back to 1 c. of sugar next time. It may need to be cut back more than that, but we'll see.  I used skim milk, but was worried it would turn out a little thin so used about 1/4 c. less than asked for. I also added 1/4 t. salt, and used only half the butter. I suggest allowing the custard to cool to room temp before proceeding to the meringue step. It will help minimize condensation between the custard and meringue layers.

Amazingly good, but a bit too sweet for my family. Easily remedied by cutting the sugar back to 3/4 cup. Also tasted delicious with ginger snaps instead of vanilla wafers and bourbon instead of vanilla, just for a change of pace, but is absolutely delicious as it.

The absolute best banana pudding.  It's everything you hope.  The pudding is easy to make and so smooth.  I made it with between 3/4 cup and 1 cup of sugar.  It was pretty sweet but that's what made it so good.  The amount of pudding is perfect for a standard pie pan.  I let the pudding cool to just warm before I added it to the vanilla wafers and then let it sit all together in the frige for approx 5 or 6 hrs.  The vanilla wafers were still crisp but starting to get soft.  Really it was perfect!

Pudding had no banana flavor at all. It just taste like cornstarch. I think a recipe using flower would be better. also you should use banana extract.

This recipe was OUTSTANDING. Even just the pudding part could be eaten on its own as a perfectly acceptable dessert. 

I made two of them, one as directed, and one with graham cracker crumbs instead of vanilla wafers. Both were sensational.

you could not possibly fit 2 cups of cookies and all of those  layers into a regular 9" pie pan. if you want all the layers, i'd suggest using a 2 quart dish. as it was, i just put a layer of cookies and bananas, topped with the pudding, added some more banana slices, and then the meringue. it was gone in less than 24 hours, and i think my husband ate it himself. i'll make it again.

I only made the pudding itself because my sister didn't want the pie crust or meringue. We followed the recipes exactly and it was delicious! A little too sweet for my mom though. I layered everything right after I took it off the stove and then put it in the fridge overnight. The flavor of the bananas came out really well and the wafers seemed to 'melt' into the pudding(which I like so I can mix it all up). I will definitely be keeping this recipe. :)

I followed the recipe with the exception of cutting the sugar in 1/2 as suggested by other reviewers and I'm glad I did.  It took me a while to get the pudding thickened because I was afraid to get the heat too high.  Next time I will use a double boiler.  It was pretty good but it has a little too much vanilla for my taste.  I am not a huge vanilla fan so I will put only one teaspoon next time.  Overall a good recipe.

I only made the custard part, which I used for another dessert and that's what I'm going to rate. I only used 3/4 cups sugar and it was still a tad too sweet. I cannot imagine how anyone could eat it with the suggested amount of sugar. If it weren't for those great reviews that guided me, I would have tossed the whole thing.

As others recommended, I doubled the pudding recipe and cut the sugar by half.  I also chilled the pudding before pouring over the bananas and wafers- hot pudding seems to "cook" the bananas and give them an odd texture.  I made the meringue with 1/2 cup sugar (because I had 6 egg whites) and thought it was fine.  The end product reminded me of dinners at my Aunt's house.  Absolutely AMAZING!  Thanks so much for posting the recipe.

WAY TOO MUCH SUGAR!!! If you do nothing else, reduce the sugar. I made this for a family get-together of 10. Not one person ate more than a couple of bites. The pudding was a good consistancy and had good flavor but was so sweet it made my teeth ache. I might try it again, but it will be greatly altered.

Quite quick and simple - nothing outstanding, but nice solid base.  Second batch, I decreased sugar to 3/4 cup (probably should stay at 1 cup) and added only 1 t vanilla (stay with 2).  Make sure heat is OFF when incorporating egg yolks - I had a bit of a problem with my 2nd batch and had to run through strainer.

This was an excellent recipe.  I did use only 3/4 cups of sugar for the pudding and it was still sweet.  I also added 1 tablespoon of corn starch.  As I was stirring the original recipe my pudding was not thickening.  I made one batch on Friday and had to make another batch on Saturday.  My grandkids kept coming back for more "Nana Pudding" as they call it.  Of course I'm Nana also.  They loved the pudding and now I acquired the name of "Nana Ana Banana Pudding".  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is an easy recipe to pull together.  Tweaks I had done was use graham crumbs instead of the wafers.  Cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup as others had suggested.  I also used 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 1 tsp. banana extract instead of the 2 tsp. vanilla extract.  There was several complaints about the pudding not thickening.  Please remember the instructions say to stir frequently not constantly.  If you stir constantly the pudding will take forever to thicken up.  Will be making again but next time will use 2 tsp. of banana extract.  Thank you Pat for sharing.  And thank you bakergirl for suggesting this recipe.

I wish I had looked at the reviews and added less sugar to the pudding.

This was wonderful and I would give a 5 star with a few changes.  I changed the servings to 12 and made in a 6 quart casserole.  I cup the sugar to 1/4 of the recipe, but it still needed less.  My husband is not a sugar person and he could not eat a full serving because is was toooooo sweet.  Also, cook your custard until thick because it will not thicken after off the heat.  Great recipe and yummy.

Pouring the pudding over the wafers while still warm resulted in a very mushy wafer layer. Next time I would let the pudding chill fully first. Delicious filling!

I dislike banana pudding made with a mix as well. No idea why the one person said it only tastes of cornstarch and would be better if it used flour when the recipe DOES call for flour. lol  This is a very nice tasting recipe although  I did cut the sugar to 3/4 c and added 4 banana's instead of 3 just because I LOVE banana's.  Thanks for sharing..

this was a huge success with my family:) I would have rated it 5 stars, but I felt the meringue process wasnt entirely helpful. It doesnt include some of the key ingredients meringue normally has.

This is the recipe I use when I want pudding. I agree that it needs less sugar. When I made it as a pie it got runny when it was baked.

THIS IS a delicious recipe EXCEPT next time I WILL reduce the sugar.   I added 1/8 tsp. cream of tartar to the egg whites and got a creamier meringue.  I reduced the oven temp. to 330 and only baked it for ten minutes - just a tip if your oven runs hot.

I doubled this recipe to make 2 pies and I thought the 3 cups of sugar was too much so I even cut back by 1/2 cup and it was still too much sugar, and I am a sweetaholic.  I would do 3/4 for one and 1 1/2 cups of sugar for 2 pies. It is sickening sweet. I had to make an extra batch of milk and flour to add and it was still comaville!  Other ingredients worked well. I was taking 1 pie to a get together and didnt because it was too sweet.

Marvelous!  This is the closest recipe to my Grandmother's that I have found.  She passed away in Oct. before I could get hers.  I have missed this dessert, but this recipe is wonderful.  Increased the heat to medium when cooking the pudding mixture and added a pinch of salt as suggested by another user.  I cooked it on low for a long time, but it seemed not to be thickening.  Thanks!!!!!!!

Simple and beautiful pie! Loved it, and so did everyone else. It's sooooo easy making this pudding, makes me wonder why people would buy desserts in a box... Thanks for sharing. This is a great recipe for leftover banannas, or just any time you need a yummy pie!

This is a VERY yummy recipe!! Loved it. I followed everyone's suggestions about cutting down the sugar so, what I did was I used the same amount of sugar and doubled the recipe and it was still pretty sweet. Next time I'll probably cut more sugar. But over all, delicious recipe. I will never go back to instant pudding! :)

Whoa- sorry, but this was no good.There was definitly something wrong with the sugar and flour measurements. It was way to sweet. My 8 year old son thought it was to sweet and dumped it out.Plus the pudding never set. I cooked it longer than than it was supposed to be cooked, but it was still watery. I've used the recipe on the Nilla wafer box before, and it came out great. It uses only 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/3 cup flour.I'll stick with that from now on

Wonderful recipe and it looks so nice too!  I used the 1 cup sugar recommended by other   reviewers and I wouldn't make it any sweeter.  Also in a rush, I didn't crush  the vanilla wafers and they were fine.  [Now I've made it several times.  Note that it only serves about 4 people with this yield so to serve 6, I use at least 4 medium bananas; and layer it in a 6 quart glass casserole dish.  You can make 3 layers with the amount of pudding, if you use whole vanilla wafers.]

Used equal parts half and half with skim milk, due to lack of whole milk.  Cut sugar to 3/4 cup and added cream of tarter when whipping meringue.  Loved it!

I know this supposed to be like banana pudding, but I would have preferred this with a tradition baked pie crust instead of the vanilla wafers.  The wafers got soggy.

This is a hit at every family function.  It is five stars as is but to take it up a notch I crush up the vanilla wafers to make a "pie crust" at the bottom and then start layering with bananas.  I always add more bananas and wafers than it calls for and more egg whites to make the meringue higher.  You won't regret making this recipe but beware, people will ask you to make it all the time and it is best fresh so be sure to prepare close to when you plan to serve it.

After hearing how amazing my boyfriend's mother's banana pudding was, I knew I had big shoes to fill. Not only did he go crazy for this recipe but it holds up to hers! I've never had banana pudding and I love this one too! First time making meringue and it turned out amazing! Thanks for the recipe!!! It's super sweet so it's a rare treat we both get so excited for.

I made a double batch of this tonight because I wanted to serve it in a bigger dish than the pie dish. The recipe is great if you omit half of the sugar in the pudding. 3/4 cup is plenty for a single batch..1/2 cup is even better. I'm not sure how anyone can stomach this with 1 1/2 cups of sugar. This is definitely better than the instant recipes.

Well, it's not a pie or a pudding, it's a banana custard with meringue on top. It turned out fine but although it tasted ok it was not very exciting. My family said not to bother again. Also if you let it chill after cooking, the meringue loses it's crisp top. It was still very sweet even after reducing the sugar as suggested but other reviewers. The half soggy wafers were not very nice either. Just not to our taste, I suppose.

This is a good pie but I think it was missing a bit of a kick for my taste. I could probably eat the pudding alone.

Awesome. Like previous reviews, USE LESS SUGAR! Mine came out too sweet. Next time I may use 1 cup or less. Very easy to make!! I baked it in a deep dish pie shell and was great!!

I liked the taste of the pudding but I found that it was too soupy. I tried it several different times and different ways and could never get it right. Maybe it was just me, probably won't attempt this one again :(

I don't know what I did wrong but the pudding never set.  I was like soup with bananas and vanilla wafers.  I threw it away right away.  Also, it was very sugary!

so, so good. the cream filling compliments the banana perfectly. Didn't have wafer, so I made with pie crust. Next time I think I'll experiment with cinnamon and perhaps sprinkle nuts on top instead of meringue.

I made this today and it is spectacular. The kids love it and so does the man. The pudding filling is so good that I made extra to just eat. I think this could be called more of a banana cream pie. I will try it with my mom who loves banana cream pie and see what she thinks. I used 3 cups whole milk, a scant 1/2 cup flour, and 1 cup sugar -perfect.

Good but REALLY REALLY sweet.  Very sugar tasting. Maybe if it was made with a bit of lemon juice on the bananas and less sugar.  Anyhow it wasn't bad just really sweet.

WAY TOO SWEET!!  I meant to cut down on sugar, but forgot & boy did I regret it.  Changed the meringue to freshly whipped cream, which helped to cut down on the sweetness a little.

This was great! Even my mom who usually does not like banana desserts liked it!!! Thanks for sharing! The reason I stumbled across this recipe was because my boyfriend asked me to make him a banana pudding pie because his aunt makes one, but I think she uses the instant pudding mix. I hope he likes it when I make it for him.

This is way too much sugar. I used half the amount, per the suggestion of others and it was still too sweet. We love our sweets but dang. I'll try it again but with maybe just 1/2 cup sugar.

Really good!! It was a bit on the sweet side but I forgot the vanilla and that may be why. Vanilla cuts that sweetness and gives more of a flavor. It was still good though! I will make to take to the next BBQ! Well worth the effort! VERY GOOD!!!

Yumm!  Excellent!  I made this for Easter and it was long gone by the time we came home.  I didn't change a thing, but I wanted to make 2 9x13 dishes for both sides of the family, so I figured, 1 batch serves 8, tripling the recipe should be good - wrong!! I tripled it and it made 1 9x13" dish - Just a word of warning.  Also, for that size dish, I used 4 bananas (and don't triple the wafers either).

1) REDUCE THE SUGAR!!!!!!!!!!  Way too sweet the way is, even after I reduced it, I wish I would have reduced it some more because it was super-sweet.
2) I suggest following another merengue recipe for the topping, as someone suggesting, adding cream of tartar helps it to reach the right consistency.
3) Unless you're okay with more of a "pudding" than a "pie", I would suggest using a ready-made pie crust.  The vanilla wafers don't hold too well as a crust (but it is delicious).
4) Make sure you cook the pudding long enough so that it's nice and thick.  I think mine was a little too runny and I wish I would have cooked it just a bit longer.

This is a very good recipe! I did change some of the recipe, I used 1 cup of evaporated milk with 1 cup of regular milk. I used about a box of wafflers and not the crumbs. I tasted great. Its alot more rich then the bake recipes that are online.

Cut the sugar down to a cup as others suggested.  For the maringue, I made the mistake of beating the eggs with a spoon - too much effort!  Definitely use a mixer for this or just use Cool Whip.  I also threw in a half cup of shredded coconut to the pudding after it thickend and sprinkled some on top.  Came out great!

This was my first attempt at an authentic banana pudding. Where did I go wrong?! It is runny and the meringue was hopeless! I was so excited about making this because it is my husbands favorite. I am rating this 4 stars because I am sure it is delicious. My version wouldn't even rate a one!

Tried this recipe twice, first time I put ALL of the sugar in ..way too sweet! the second time I decreased the sugar to 1/2c much better. For the most part, it's a good pudding recipe.  I dont like meringue, so I crushed vanilla wafers ontop and served it that way.

WOW! This recipe was awesome. I'm going to add a little less sugar but other than that it is great and the recipe was simple to follow.  I even somehow got the meringue to turn out right.  I'll be making this for when my husband gets home from Kuwait, since he is a banana pudding fanatic!

This was *way* too sweet for my family.  Sorry, did I do something wrong?  I would try it again but would probably cut back on the sugar in the pudding by about 1/4-1/2 cup!  I also think the vanilla was a little strong - I will cut down to 1.5 tsp. next time.  The meringue was a nice addition.  I did add a pinch of salt like another reviewer suggested.

This was so good. Just like mamas! I used a little less than a cup of sugar after reading the other reviews. Also, 1/4 tsp of cream of tarter in the merangue.

I used a whipped cream topping, and only one layer of graham crackers and bananas because I used a large rectangular baking dish.  Served for an Easter dinner.  Lots of compliments.

I made this the day before for Easter.  My neighbor said it was the best banana pudding he has ever tasted... much to his wife's chagrin. I accidently used lemon extract instead of vanilla.  I was not impressed but everyone else loved it!  Next time I might try one teaspoon of lemon and one teaspoon of vanilla since it was a happy accident.

Only thing I changed was the milk. I used half and half and it was soooo much better. It was purely out of the fact that I'd run out of milk. I was so praying it would turn out good. And it turned out amazing!

Yes, a few changes. I used a Nilla Wafer Pie Crust instead of cookies. And I mashed 1 ripe banana into pudding mixture, then I mixed on high while cooking, shaved a 1/4 of cinnamon stick & continued cooking & mixing until thickened. I lined banana slices in bottom of pie crust pour pudding over slices until all bananas are covered. Cut up remaining banana slices into peices, add scarcley on top of pudding. Top & bake

Way, way too sweet. I reduced sugar to 1 cup due to others mentioning this, but it was still way too sweet. I liked how easy the pudding was without having to temper egg yolks.

I usually never do reviews but I've made this recipe a few times and it just wouldn't be fair to give credit . It is amazing ! I love baked banana pudding . I usually add a little extra flour and milk to make more pudding . After pudding is thick I take it off heat and mush a banana and add it to pudding to give it that banana flavor . Some MISTAKES I've made is making meringe before everything  because it turns back to liquid. Also I cut the bananas at the last minute since they brown quickly.  I literally feel like I make the best banana pudding . Lasted less than 5 min on thanksgiving table.

Perfect as is! Maybe a little sweet but for us - not much. I’ll reduce it a ridge next time. Absolutely loved this recipe and the meringue also! About to go and finish it off now! Thanks for posting!

I reduced the sugar from 1-1/2 c to 1 cup, it was still overly sweet.  The pudding had a chalky taste and the consistency was a little too gooey. We have a great recipe at home that we use, were on vacation so needed a recipe. This one just didn't cut it.

Too sweet. Four ripe bananas barely tasted them over the sugar. Cut the sugar if using cookie crumb crust. Cut the sugar anyway.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't use instant pudding and that was easy to follow.  This definitely worked well for me!  I made the following changes:

- 2 cups evaporated milk
- vanilla + banana extract in pudding
- Chessmen cookies for a cooler decoration where visible (see photo)
- reduced fat vanilla wafers
- cream of tartar + vanilla in meringue
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter

Best banana pudding ever.  I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup as other readers suggested.  I used ginger snaps for a little bite with the bananas and homemade whipped cream for topping instead of the meringue.  Will make thousand of times.

This was my first time ever making HOMEMADE banana pudding and with this recipe i wish to look no further! I love it! It is a lot better than instant. I wish i would have added just a tad bit more sugar into the pudding, but overall it is the best recipe yet!

Yes!!! This is what I think! I was waaaaaaay to darn sweet.  It gets a 1 rating. If I tried it again I will definitely use less sugar. The recipe calls for 1 1/2 cup of sugar, I will use only 1/2 cup.

The pudding recipe called for much more sugar than was palatable. It also would have been helpful to know that beating the egg whites for the meringue is best done with an electric mixer. This might be common knowledge, but I had never made meringue before. This clarification would have been easy to include in step number 6 of the directions, and it would have saved me a lot of hassle, mess, eggs, and sugar.

This by far made my teeth ache from way too much sugar! The basic pudding recipe will be adjusted next time I try it with 1/2 cup sugar and more milk.

Way too much sugar...  it could be cut in half easily with the 2 cups of milk.  Outside of that, it was pretty good!

I have made this recipe now as a pudding without the meringue, which was yummy and with the meringue but no cookies. It is our family favourite! Used Almond milk and cut the sugar to 1 cup for the oudding and it turned out great. Thank you.

Excellent banana pudding! As suggested in another review I cut the sugar down to 1/2 a cup.  I then adjusted the reciepe to make a very large aluminum pan of this deliciousness for a birthday party.  It was a hit!  I also opted out of making the meringue since I was making more of a traditional pudding and not a pie.

This was fantastic and fun to make!  My son loved helping stack the wafers and bananas.  Banana pudding has always been a family staple that my father loved.  My mother was the only one that could make it to his liking.  She passed away in 08' and when he had this it teared him up saying this was exactly the way mama used to make.  Thank you.

I followed this recipe exactly, except the sugar and I doubled everything to make a large enough amount for my family. I actually used 1 1/2 cups of sugar (when everything else was doubled). It was absolutely great. Reminded me of the banana pudding my grandmother used to make.

This was good the day it was made but not the next day.  I doubled the pudding as one recipe would not have been near enough and yes, cut down on the sugar.  My pudding was a little too thick so added a little more milk.  I laid the wafers in whole and did not layer twice.  I agree that it tasted like a custard instead of pudding and I didn't care for the soggy vanilla wafers.

Indeed an excellent recipe.  But please realize this is not a pudding at all, it is a CUSTARD.  This would be more commonly known as a  "Banana Cream Pie" :)

...so delicious!  My first attempt to make pudding pie, and gosh, I wish I've known earlier how easy it is to make pudding!  I followed the instruction exactly, and it turned out so delicious.  Served with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon on top, and it was heavenly!  Thank you for the recipe!

This banana pudding was awesome and very easy to make.  I used only a 1/2 cup of sugar and it came out wonderful.  I used 1/2 cup of evaporated milk and 1/2 cup of regular milk.  I cooked the pudding over low heat and then medium.  I even cooked the rest of my dinner at the same time and let it simmer.  The pudding got thick on its own so let it cook about 15-20 minutes and be patient.  I cooled it on the stove about 15 minutes and poured over bananas and wafers.    After alternating, I finished with just cookies on top and then placed it in the fridge for 30 minutes.  It came out perfect!  Nothing was soggy at all.  My family loved it.  I also agree that you may need to double the pudding because it made a very small amount which is fine because I need to watch my weight.  Thanks for the receipe!

It was really good--just make sure you're NOT using old bananas.  I made the mistake of putting in one frozen ripened banana and whenever I came across one of the slices it was definitely an unappetizing difference in texture.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I do think that 1 1/2 cups of sugar is way too much.  I only used 1/2 cup and it was fine.  I must say that I do like it much better when it first comes out of the oven rather than chilling it first.

yummmmmmm very good WITH  the changes! 1 1/2 cups sugar is too much, i honestly think the person who submitted this recipe put 1/2 cup, because even 3/4 cups was too sweet. I ended up adding another cup of milk mixed with 2 teaspoons flour. It was perfect! didnt have to add more eggyolks either.. this was perfect for me because i live in chile and they dont sell pudding here.. or im not very sure what the translation would be, so i prefer making it from scratch.. i didnt use the egg whites for the meringue, i whipped up some cream and sweetened it.. i didnt think the meringue would go so well.. maybe it does, but my family doesnt like meringue that much anyway.. plus its summer here and the cold dessert with cream is more "refreshing"  thanks for this great recipe!

I have been wanting a recipe that is close to what my mother used to make.  Wow!  This is as close as it can get.  Although, she never crumbled the 'nilla wafers.  I like this method better.  The only thing I did different was add 3-4 drops of banana flavoring to the pudding with the vanilla just to give it a little more banana taste.  Oh by the way, I have never made homemade pudding before.  The pudding came out perfect.  I think the next time I will decrease the amount of sugar a little.  It was really sweet.  As you can see by my handle, I still have a lot to learn.  Thanks for sharing your old recipe.  :)

Yes!  This is the way to make banana pudding!  My only suggestion is that instead of using whole cookies, crush them to a fine crumb and only line the sides of the dish with the whole cookies.  So, it's crumbs, bananas, pudding... crumbs, bananas, pudding, then topping.  I've read so many recipes that have corn starch in them instead of flour.  What?

This is an excellent recipe. Once you have this homemade banana pudding you'll never settle for a recipe that calls for pudding. A bit sweet, so adjust to your taste.

WOW!  How can I ever go back to pudding in a box!  I'm glad I read the reviews b/c it helped tremendously!  I used 1 1/2 CUPS SUGAR as called for BUT DOUBLED THE RECIPE as someone suggested.  I also cooked in a double-boiler, saved one-half of the pudding and added a square of Baker's semi-sweet chocolate to make a chocolate pie.  As the pudding was cooking for a while, I realized it wasn't thickening as much as I would have liked.  I added about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and whisked it.  It started to thicken nicely at this point.  My meringue turned out beautifully.  This was worth the time and effort to end up with TWO different pies!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  I will make it again for sure!

Very good taste but even 3/4 cup sugar is too much.  I'll definitely make this again but only use 1/2 cup like another reviewer suggested.  I'll also do only 1tsp of vanilla.  Otherwise everything with the recipe was right.

This recipe was really great, I think that next time I make it I willput only half of the vanilla into the pudiing. It was a little too vanilla-ish for me.

VERY VERY sweet.  I cut the sugar down to a cup and it was just a touch too sweet.  Next time I'll follow the advice of everyone and possibly use 3/4 cup instead.  I used a shallow pie pan and omitted the meringue, only because my pan was already overflowing.  Next time I want to use a deeper pan and try it with the meringue.  Overall a great recipe, the kids loved it.  I will definitely make this and many variations of this pudding pie!!

I thought this recipe was great and it came our perfectly.  WHEN I make it again I will try other's suggestions of cutting back on the sugar.  It was a bit too sweet for my taste.  After I served our second helping we threw some fresh blueberries on top which were delicious and they cut down on the sugary taste.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

I love this recipe as it is.  I used evaporated milk (recipe did not specify what kind) and I couldn't get my meringue to act right (my fault), so I used whipped topping instead.  I maded it for Thanksgiving, and it did not last the entire day.  This is one dessert that is here to stay.  It was also really simple to make.  Everyone LOVED it.  Thanks, Pat!

This recipe deserves all 5 stars. It is wonderful and just like grandma used to make. I did cut back the sugar to 1 Cup and am not a great fan of meringue but, I will use this recipe from now on.

I made this and it is a good recipe but it is way too sweet.  I cut the sugar to 1 cup and it was still sweet!  I will try this again with 1/2 or 3/4 cup of sugar.

This pudding has become the recipe for bannana pudding in our house! Although great as written I did change it up due to the varying preferences in the household. Used soymilk, cool whip in place of meringue and reduced sugar to 3/4c. Also as an adjustment for not using meringue and a family member's preference for a crunchier cookie, I do not bake it; rather I let it cool in the refrig sealed in plastic wrap then once chilled I mix in sliced bannanas and layer as directed and then place it back in refrig. Turns out great every time!

This recipe is terrific!  I made the change recommended by other reviews (less suger - 1 cup)and I used whole wafers and an 8x8 square casserole dish.  The pudding was gone in 1 1/2 days!  I will ALWAYS use this recipe!

I think the recipe would have tasted better if it included a dash of salt.  Without salt it tastes too sweet.

I liked it.  It tastes better than the instant variety to me....although the instant certainly deserves a spot in our recipe file for a quick, easy and tasty dessert.  But for an old fashioned treat, try the cooked variety.  That being said, I also recommend decreasing the sugar to no more than 1/2 c. for a single recipe.  For me, the recipe did not make nearly enough pudding, so next time I will double it, and adjust the sugar accordingly.

I made my own vanilla biscuit crumb using gluten free flour. One because I am gluten free and also because we don’t have the vanilla wafers. It turned out great and although the puddling mix was extremely sweet, this seemed to balance out when all together. It was easy to made and everyone enjoyed it. 

I will definitely make this again.

I made just the pudding part, and as other reviewers suggested, cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. I used a homemade graham cracker crust layered with banana slices, poured the pudding in, and then another layer of banana slices. It came out WONDERFUL.

We had a party for the kids last night that involved s’mores over a camp fire, so today we had left over graham crackers, so I used them crushed with a tablespoon of melted butter to hold them together.  Other than that I used the recipe as listed.  Maybe didn’t cook the pudding enough, as it is still pretty liquid in the oven now, then going into the fridge for a while, if its a bit runny, I’ll know to cook longer next time, I was right about 15 minutes on the stove top.

The pudding wasn’t thickening on low heat for me. I needed to use medium/high heat to get it to thicken. Not sure if it’s because I have an electric stove? It turned out great! I agree with other tips that the sugar could be reduced & it would still be plenty sweet.

I made it twice. The first time it definitely had too much sugar and not enough pudding l. The second time I doubled the egg yolks milk and flour and cut the sugar to 2 cups instead of four and it was much better.

My 92yo dad is from east Tennessee - he said this tasted just like how his mom made it!  Following other reviews, I reduced sugar to 3/4 C and added 1/4 tsp of salt. To the egg whites, I added 1/8 tsp cream of tartar.  Also, did not crush the wafers - just layered them.   Just a note - I cook my homemade puddings on medium (not low), and they turn out nicely.

It is very delicious! Like others I did cut out some of the sugar in the pudding to 1/2 cup.  Next time I'll try using 1 tsp banana extract with the vanilla.

This  pudding is so sweet it is overwhelming.
If I decide to try it again; I would cut the sugar in half if not more.
Do not feed it to your children, unless you feel they need extra energy.

This was wonderful but I thought the sweetness overpowered the banana flavor. Perhaps I will cut the amount of sugar next time. Definitely worth a next time!

I really enjoyed making this homemade banana pudding. I was so surprised and excited to have something new turn out to be so delectable! My family loved it and it was a great Thanksgiving hit. Like other reviewers, I cut the sugar for the filling in half - mixing in a total of 3/4 cup. Next time I make this, I will double the pudding mixture and double the meringue mixture. I found that with 2-9-inch pie pans, a standard box of Nilla wafers, about 4-5 bananas, and double the amounts of each mentioned above would yield two perfect pudding pies. If I make this in one pan, like an 11x9, I will probably just follow the original measures. So delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

I used gluten free vanilla wafers and left the whole. (That's how my mother in law always made banana pudding.) I also used "Cup for Cup" GF all purpose flour. The custard is a bit sweet, and I believe a pinch of salt would do wonders for balancing it all out. Will update after the family tastes it today!

It was exceptional and very delicious I made it with vanilla wafers around the edges, at first I thought the  meringue wasn’t going to come together but then I put it in an electric mixer and it turned into a delicious fluff I will definitely use this recipe again ??

I made the pudding part of this recipe for a baked pie crust. I did not make meringue for the topping as this type of pie was requested by a family member who preferred whipped cream topping. After reading the advice of other posters, I used 1 1/4 cup sugar, which was a nice sweetness and wish that I had added 1 more tsp vanilla for a bit richer flavor to match the request of the recipient. This recipe makes enough pudding for a large pie. Everyone was happy!

The flavor was wonderful (according to those who ate it) but the pudding was very runny and almost like a sauce/gravy. Not sure what I can do to ensure pudding like consistency but I’ll try again for sure.

I made this yesterday and it tastes even better today! I followed the other reviews and only used half of the sugar in the pudding and it was plenty sweet! Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and it is delicious. 

For those having trouble with the pudding, you probably aren't cooking it long enough. Put on medium-low heat until it starts boiling. Keep stirring and it will thicken perfectly!

The thing that caught my eye about this recipe was the from-scratch pudding, so I gave it a try. I also hate instant pudding. The recipe got rave reviews from my family and being from the south and very familiar with traditional Southern banana pudding, have to say this this is the best recipe I've tried to date. Because I was making this for company, I "fancied" it up by using shortbread cookies (very Paula Dean!) rather than the traditional vanilla wafers. Everyone thought it was perfectly sweet, but next time I may try to reduce the sugar a tiny touch. Great authentic recipe!

This recipe will send you into sugar shock. Uses entirely to much sugar.  You only need half the amount of sugar. 
Use the original recipe from the Nabisco Vanilla wafer box and this would get 5 stars.

I added 1/4 t. Banana extract. Probably could have used one more egg white for the meringue. Brought it to work. Everyone loved it. More work than the instant but I think it is worth it if you have the time.

Excellent recipe as is. I did change the method somewhat, blending in half the cooked milk mixture into the egg yolks and then adding the egg/milk mixture back into the hot cooking milk/sugar in the heavy saucepan. I used mini-vanilla wafers.

This was SO good.  However, I did not cook the pudding part long enough.  I thought it would thicken upon standing and it didn't.  The taste was amazing, but the pudding was too thin.  Be sure to cook it long enough to thicken and you will be very happy.

Good overall recipe, but I would definitely reduce the sugar next time, it is very sweet. It does take a while to thickening pudding to the right consistency.

Love this!  Have made this for years. In my home my Mom always just called this Banana Pudding! Been making this for 50 years. We do use less sugar.  This can get too sweet if you are not careful.  We also make this substituting the vanilla wafers with graham crackers!  Just as good!

I read the reviews before making this dessert.  I'm glad I did cut down on the sugar because it was just the right amount of sweetness for me.   I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

So, after constant mentioning from my boyfriend  of wanting a banana pudding.... For the 4th of July,I surprised him with one.... Thanks to this wonderful, easy to follow recipe. I must say it didn't last long.... It was a big hit at our family BBQ.  I will definitely make it again (maybe with a little less sugar) for other family members to experience this greatness.

The absolute worse! After more than a day of refrigeration (after cooking), it was still runny and disappointing. I followed the recipe completely! Oh, the best was when I thought it was ok and decided to take it in my car to a friend. It was literally the consistency of water within the 10 minute drive!

Excellent recipe. I used 1 c. of  sugar and even that was too much. I will try 3/4 c. next time. Other than that this is a great recipe. No banana flavoring/extract in the pudding is necessary, it's delicious as is.

Disappointing. It looked gorgeous. The only thing that came out lovely was the merengue. I chilled it for a few hours in the fridge. I was expecting it to be soft like a pudding and not a pie, but it waas very liquidy and not pudding-like at all. The crushed cookies had turned to mush. Way too sweet!

I really liked this recipe,  it is not that fake no bake kind everyone is making, it was well received in my home.  I used way less of the regular sugar the recipe calls for because I also used sweet condensed milk as well. I will definitely make again!

This was my first time making Banana Pudding. I doubled the recipe and per the most helpful review, used 1/2 c sugar to 2 c Milk. However, I added a little more sugar to taste while I was cooking the pudding. I was worried this might mess with the consistency, but it worked out just fine.   Also, per the most helpful negative review, the pudding did taste a bit like the flour, perhaps because I cut the sugar, so I added extra vanilla to taste.  The finished product vanished from the bowl. It was a huge hit.

I made this and it was great. After reading reviews I did double the recipe and cut back on the sugar.  For a double portion I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and there was still room to cut back some.  I did use ripened bananas so next time I will use 1 1/4 cup of sugar for a double batch.  Other than that this recipe was great!  It was informative to know from another reviewer that it does take about 10 minutes of continuous  whisking before the pudding thickens.    I did refrigerate my pudding for 2 hours as others suggested and everything turned out perfect.  Great homemade pudding recipe!  Thanks Pat!!

Delicious! I modified it slightly by using 3/4 c sugar, 2 1/2 c of milk and 4 bananas. After pulling the pudding mixture off the stove, I allowed it to cool down to a warmth to prevent my cookies from getting mushy. Simply scrumptious!

Yes! This is my first 'from scratch' pudding pie, my family LOVED  it! Of course, anything with 1 1/2 cups of sugar would please the kids, but hubby and I will prefer less sugar next time.  I had too many over ripe bananas on hand so I ended up smashing up one and incorporating it into the milk and sugar mix as it was cooking. Delicious and nice over-all banana flavor.

I cut the sugar in half, and this was still too sweet. If I make it again, I will cut the sugar more.

Followed this recipe and the pudding was completely watery, complete liquid. Never got thick.  I continued the recipe thinking it would eventually get thick. NO! Its still watery. Im going to refrigerate it overnight and hopefully it gets thick but as of right now its not edible. I wont be following this recipe ever again.

I was worried with the amount of time to make the old fashioned banana pudding, but was really surprised. Not only is it easy, my kids fought over licking the spoon and sauce pan once I got finished! It's for a memorial day party so I'll find out how good it actually is later. I did adjust the sugar after reading some of the reviews, though. Fingers crossed!

This pudding is absolutely the best! Hands down better than any boxed jello pudding, however I made some adjustments to the recipe. I made this recipe 3 times to get it to the perfect sweetness and flavor. My ending result is: 1/3 c. Sugar, 1/4 c. Flour, 2 c. Milk, 3 egg yolks, 1 t. Butter, & 1 t. Vanilla extract.
My husband has eaten almost the entire batch before it even had a chance to cool!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! My husband and son both have a huge sweet tooth so I followed the recipe with all the sugar :)  The only substitution I made was instead of 2 cups of milk, I used 1-1/2 cups 2% milk and 1/2 cup HEB MooTopia 2% Reduced Fat Vanilla milk. It was the perfect amount of vanilla flavoring needed. I also used the 1/2 teaspoon cream of tarter for the meringue. I let it sit overnight to give the bananas and wafers a chance to soak in all the flavors!!! DELICIOUS!!!! I will be making this again and again!!!!

I dropped the flour and used cornstarch instead, I think it was creamier and I didn't use the wafers I hate those things. I just wanted the pudding and nothing else. Finding a good banana pudding is next to impossible and the ones i did find I would have had to modify too much. This is the closet I could find to be a real banana pudding. I do not want or like custard which are also redundantly abundant on the internet.

So good. So very, very good. I have made banana cream pie, banana pudding, etc. but always with instant or some sort of store bought ingredients. The pudding was AWESOME! My husband was just amazed. This is definitely a keeper.

There are a few things I changed and it came out fantastic! I used 3/4 cup of sugar for a double recipe, slightly ripe bananas, 3 cups of milk, 1.5 tsp of Haitian vanilla, 1.5 tsp of cornstarch, and added about another 1/8 cup of flour as I mixed the pudding on the stove to thicken the pudding as I mixed for nearly ten minutes over medium heat. On low, it would never heat through and thicken on my stove. For the meringue, I added 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar, a couple sprinkles of salt, and a few drops of vanilla. After leafing through the previous reviews and having never made meringue, I talked to my aunt who is a chef, and she said NEVER bake meringue, always broil because baking with cause the filling to be ruined and runny, so broil I did, and it only took a couple of minutes to lightly brown. You must watch on broil because it will brown QUICKLY! Also, like others have mentioned, save yourself some carpal tunnel surgery and beat the meringue with an electric mixer!

It was hard to find a recipe without using a banana pudding mix. This one looked very interesting. I was very surprised to see it all work out well. I used a rectangle taller dish so I should have used three layers instead of two. Next time maybe I'll fold in a mashed banana the liquid pudding before pouring into the dish for more uniform flavor and line the glass dish with Nilla Wafers for visual effect. Another lesson learned was I should have used a mixer to beat the meringue instead of hand beating it for what seemed like 10 minutes.

I was looking for this recipe because I couldn't find my written one from my Mom that I usually use.  It is the same and having made it countless time it is awesome and gets rave reviews every time I make it.  My family doesn't even let it cool off before it vanishes.
    The only differences from my (and Mom's recipe is that we use who vanilla wafer's not crumbled.  Also she taught me to always use 1/2 - 1 tsp of cream of tartar whenever making a meringue to keep it stiff and dry and prevent it from becoming "weepy".  It is a trick that really works well.

Very good recipe but I added 2 tablespoons cornstarch because I was using 1% milk and the first batch did not set up correctly. I also only added half the sugar like suggested. . With those changes it turned out perfect.

This turned out SO good! I took it for Easter dinner yesterday and the pie was gone by the end of the day. I followed the recipe just like it said. I did however forget to add the vanilla and it still turned out. I will for sure make this again!

This is a true "Southern banana pudding" recipe. This is exactly how my mother and grandmother made it. I hate the instant vanilla pudding recipes and this was the only recipe I could find on this site a few years ago that didn't use it. The only thing I change to make it "more southern" is extra bananas and a whole box of wafers (not crushed) because I make this in a 8x11 casserole dish, not as a pie. Just line your dish with whole wafers and do two layers.  So easy. I've been making this for years from this exact recipe and I get requests every holiday to bring it.  Tip to those who can't get their pudding to thicken, cook it on LOW - MED heat. It takes a little while to thicken, that's why it's not INSTANT! Keep stirring, it will thicken just be patient!

This "pie" tasted great, but it was more like mush than pie. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and put the pudding in the fridge to cool before making the pie, but the crust was mushy and didn't hold together. Even after adding 1 tsp cornstarch to the pudding, it never thickened so the entire pie was a mess.

I found this recipe by accident, and boy, sure glad I did! Made this last night.. I was nervous about the pudding never thickening up, but it finally did. I agree, it is quite sweet, so I will cut this down to a 1/2 cup sugar.

Hubby and I were very disappointed. Pudding did not set at all. It was one big liquidy mess. Next time I try this I will sub corn starch for the flour and maybe I will have better luck

like everybody else, i say cut the sugar in half and use the raw sugar instead of the refined stuff. it just tastes much better. also, make more pudding. i increased it by another half.  the first meringue i tried to make didnt work. i think that some yolk got into it, or something.  maybe i didnt mix it enough before the sugar. the second time, i made sure to whip the whites until stiff,THEN put the sugar in and whip until very stiff.  try putting strawberries in it too. very good.  i cooked it a little longer, too. just until brown, about another 5 min. overall, better than my moms

my pie came out kind of runny and never got eaten by anyone.  the top crust was a definite brown so i dont think it was undercooked.  dont know what happened.  kind of confused by the recipe cos it calls for wafer crumbs, but in the directions it says line plate with alternating wafers and banana slices.  hmmm... so i used mini wafers and alternated them with the banana slices.  didnt care for that - maybe that was why it turned out bad.  if i were to make it again, i would grind up the wafers and have that as a bottom layer and then put a layer of bananas on top of the wafer layer.

This was a very good recipe, but I have to admit I did tweak it a bit as I remember my Grandmother used undiluted evaporated milk in her pudding since the can was only 12 oz. I also used a half a cup of half and half.  My husband, the banana pudding fanatic, acclaimed it to be "Killer"!

This is the yummiest banana pudding I've ever had. I used 3 cups of whole milk to 1 cup of sugar which yielded plenty of sweet pudding for the pie - next time I will add a little less sugar. I also added salt as suggested. Very Yummy!!

Super good, this is the exact recipe my Mom use to make for us when I was a little kid.  I did not have vanilla wafer, but I did have chocolate graham crakers, so I made a choc. graham cracker crust and put choc. crakers in the middle layers also.  YUMMY!!!!

DELICIOUS. I did not make it in pie form, I layered like a traditional banana pudding and skipped the meringue. Chilled and put whipped cream on the top...wow. Pudding was so good hot! I think I would also cut the sugar next time.

This was tasty but the pudding part was way too sweet for my family's taste!  I think the sugar could be reduced to one cup.  The pudding did cook up mice and thick and made a yummy dessert that we all enjoyed.  I ended up mixing in about 1/2-3/4 cup of fat free sour cream to cut the sweetness and it was perfect!

This was good, but the meringue tasted and smelled a little too eggy.  I'm not sure how to fix that, but the flavor of the pudding was delicious.  Very sweet, so the meringue is needed to offset it.

Delicious! I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the suggested amount.  My meringue burned, so I scraped it off and served the pie with chocolate flavored whipped cream which goes great with anything banana flavored.  I'll be making this again!

I cook for the Shrine Club Members. Mostly over 50 crowd with a lot of good cooks and they loved it!  I did cut back on the sugar (I'm a taste as you make kind of cook). I was so surprised at how easy it is to make homemade vanilla pudding. It is so much cheaper and better tasting than the box kind! Loved it!

This dessert is awesome!  I took PP ideas and reduced sugar to 1 cup...could possibly reduce to 3/4c.  Also, used cool whip instead of meringue - yummy.  I will use this recipe from now on.

I'm eating a dish of this pudding (didn't make it into a pie) right now, and in a few minutes I will probably be bouncing off the walls from a serious sugar high. I agree with the previous reviewer that this is FAR too much sugar. Next time I'll decrease it to one cup. There will be a next time, however, as otherwise this pudding is delicious: smooth and creamy with a glossy texture and rich flavor. I too added the pinch of salt; that's good advice for all sweet recipes. I also substituted soy milk with marvelous results. This is definitely a good, old-fashioned pudding!
