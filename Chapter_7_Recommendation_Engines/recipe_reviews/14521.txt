OMG! This is Absolutely Amazing! The meat practically "melts in your mouth" it comes out so tender and juicy! The marinade and instructions are spot on except for the marinade timing of "2 hours or overnight". That leaves a lot of room for interpretation. I would highly recommend a minimum of at least 8 hours and overnight for maximum effect. I used low sodium soy sauce to avoid this being overly salty. I also used 1 Tbsp. of sherry and 2 Tbsp. of rice vinegar so if you don't have sherry you could easily sub that for the whole thing. I would also recommend using a sweet or mild bbq sauce, not anything spicy or smokey. I didn't have fresh ginger on hand so I used a 1/2 tsp. of dry ginger plus a bit of Chinese five spice powder. I poured everything into a ziploc bag and let it go! What could be simpler? The results were nothing less than fabulous and as the submitter states these are excellent as an appetizer or an entree. This recipe is a definite keeper!

Wow! This was just like they serve in the restaurants! Loved it. Here are my alterations. Didn't have any sherry, so substitued rice vinegar. Was wonderful! Used extra clove of garlic. Marinaded 4 hours and came out perfect- not too salty as some reviewers warned against. I also boiled the remaining marinade (boil at least 3-5 minutes), adding a little soy sauce. I used this sauce on jasmine rice with chopped green onions and it was the perfect match for the beef.

THIS WAS DELICIOUS. I only gave four stars, though, because it was more ingredients and a more expensive cut of meat than a mixture I already use.
I use: ROUND STEAK (cut against the grain, approx. 1/8 in. thick),fresh minced garlic, chopped green onion, ground ginger(or oriental  
'5-spice' powder), chicken broth, sherry, and soy sauce.
I don't think the flank steak, fresh ginger, Hoisin sauce, and bbq sauce did anything MORE for it. Will definitely make again, but with my changes; it's cheaper and I think, just as good.  Oh, and I use this same sauce/marinade for the meat for stir-fry made on the stove also(not just for skewers on the grill). It's great cooked and then mixed with (stir-fried) veggies. For chicken, it is outstanding, also.

Wow! Outstanding!! I had to make some changes because I didn't have sherry. Used sweet onion and substituted 1/4 tsp. powdered ginger because I didn't have ginger root.I use a grapefruit sliceing knife when I want to slice my meat very thin, it works great when meat is slightly frozen. Must slice this very thin. I doubled the marinade to make sure every piece was covered and marinated overnight(steak will thicken a bit from sitting in marinade)Cooked on grill and they were awesome!Don't over cook,just need to be slightly browned,they cook fast! So much better than restaurants.Thanks Vivian, I will be making this alot!!

I submitted this recipe 10(?) years ago.  I'm glad people are still enjoying it.  The original recipe calls for chinese barbecue sauce or sacha sauce.  It has dried shrimp, garlic and other things in it.  I can only find it at asian stores. I use a brand called Bull Head and you can get it in a 8.5 oz can  I think the editors omitted it because they didn't know what I was talking about.  Ten years ago asian markets weren't as common.  Please try this recipe with sacha sauce!! My kids love it and we can't have a successful BBQ without it!

YUM YUM YUM!!  I've tried this recipe several times now and I definitely agree w/using flank steak, I've tried tri tip also, but didn't hold the flavor as well as well. I felt it very important to use the right meat, once i used a quite pricey flank steak, then one from a lower end market, no comparison! the cheaper flank steak was chewy and wasn't as enjoyable.  Stick to a good flank steak! Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow, this is a great recipe. I only cook recipes that have a lots of 5 star reviews. I was excited to try this one. We like things spicy so I added between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp. of hot red chili paste. It gave it just the right spiciness. I also cooked these on our indoor electric grill. I skipped the skewers, and just placed the meat directly on the grill. I buy my flank steaks at Costco, in a package of three, and automatically freeze them in seperate gallon size ziploc bags, so I just defrost(mostly) the meat in the fridge overnight, remove the meat to my plastic cutting sheet in the morning, and make the marinade directly in that bag, cut up the meat and throw it in the bag, tossing to coat. 
Anyway, it is a superb recipe, Thanks Vivian  : )

WOW!  These were awesome!  I made these twice.  First time was for dinner; we loved them but my husband thought they were a little salty.  I also forgot to add the green onions the first time.  Well, the second time I made them was for a barbeque yest.  This time I added the green onions and I added half soy sauce and half Yoshida's marinade.  They turned out perfect!  All the guests were raving.  Even the kids kept asking for more "meat on a stick."  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe for a bbq get together.  They are quick to cook and delicious to eat!!! Thanks for this recipe.

Excellent. Aside from the task of slicing the flank steak thinly (Hint: try slightly freezing it first), this was easy and won raves from my guests. Be sure to let it caramelize on the outside slightly when you grill them; gives them great texture, and they taste just like the Chinese restaurant appetizers (BBQ Beef Stick). Recommended for summer cook outs.

Excellent!!! I have made this twice already.  The second time I did not slice it before cooking and it was not as tasty as the first time.  I will go back to the original way.  My husband and kids loved it as well.

This is an ok recipe. Except I did not understand why the BBQ sauce is in there. I don't understand it. I replaced the BBQ sauce with 4 tablespoons brown sugar and it turned out much more authentic to Japanese and Korean.

5 Stars plus+++ Absolutely delicious! I couldn't ask for more in an asian inspired meal! I marinated the flank steak for 5 hours. The ingredients were easy to put together. I used fresh grated ginger root, juice and all. I also added a couple dashes of Chinese Five Spice. I threaded the meat on about 9 skewers since I had about 1 pound of flank steak. I soaked the skewers for 30 minutes so it wont burn on the grill. I made sure the meat was all threaded the same way, flat on one side for even grilling. The cooking time was approximate, 3-4 minutes on each side on medium high heat or 375 degree. The meat was so juicy, tender, not hard or tough, plenty of flavors running through each piece of meat and every bite! good blend of marinade, nothing overpowering another. I suggest to those wanting to try this to try to use flank steak because it makes a huge difference - the meat practically MELTS in your mouth! The aroma just filled my house with this wonderful smell of ginger, bbq and beef. I think next time I will make a little more sauce because the sauce was finger licking awesome! Perfectly complemented, "Sesame Noodles," and "Chinese Almond Cookies," from this site. This is going into my recipe box to use again!! A definite keeper!

I made these (along with the Chicken Sate)for my son' birthday party and they were a smash hit. They were so good that they were gone before I got to even taste one!

I made this recipe tonight for 11 people and everyone loved it.  It was very easy and had lots of flavor.

My husband had a fantastic suggestion...thread the meat onto two skewers, instead of one, to prevent the meat from twisting around the skewer when turning.

These were great!  I think the problem some people who find this too salty might be having is that they're using the wrong soy sauce.  I used good stuff I got at the local Asian store and they were great, but my friend tried them with cheap soy sauce and they were just straight salt.  just a suggestion for y'all... ;)

never made skewers before, but tried this recipe when my son was visiting, and even though I doubled the recipe they were the first thing to go and everyone wanted more.  Made it exactly as stated and wouldn't have changed a thing.  Thanks for a delish addition to my bbq

Good marinade Vivian.  I used this on round steak cut into strips and let them marinate all afternoon.  I used garlic powder and added some lime juice (to act as a tenderizer) and also a couple of spoonfuls of brown sugar.  Meat was tender and flavorful.  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome recipe!!  I am not a big fan of the ginger root flavor.  I will either cut back on the amount of ginger I use next time or use ginger powder.  This is definitely the best skewers I have tasted.  The flank steak was very tender.

Excellent. One warning: make sure you use flank steak. My meat market only had one small flank steak so I used that and a top sirloin. I figured if I cut it thin enough it would be okay. It wasn't the taste was the same, but the flank steak was tender and the sirloin was not.

Wow! This recipe is better than any I've had at any oriental restaurant! I grilled them for a very short 
time on a very hot charcoal grill (3-4 minutes per side) which carmelized the edges. Fantastic! It helps 
to slice the flank steak with a very sharp, narrow knife while it's partially frozen. You really should try this
one. My compliments to the cook!

I made this recipe for the first time for my daughter's graduation.  They were such a hit, two people asked me for the recipe.I have made them twice since that time and there are never any left.  I doubled the recipe to accomodate for extra people.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I've made this several times, and have gotten rave reviews each time.  The two modifications I would suggest is to first at least double the marinade, and to substitute 1/4 to 1/3 of the soy sauce with pineapple juice.  This changes the flavor slightly to more of a teriaki, and reduces the saltiness that several have complained about on this site.  However, this is a permanent addition to our summer BBQs.

Update: We tried something new last weekend due to running out of charcoal.  Place the meat in a slow poker and cover with enough marinade to cover meat completely.  Cook on low for 6 hours.  The meat just fell apart.  Serve over noodles and if you want, heat some of the marinade, thicken with roux, and it makes a wonderful sauce/gravy.

This was delish.  But save yourself a spoon/bowl to wash and just mix the marinade in the zipper bag.  I'm all about doing things as efficiently as possible.  Please note, skipping the bowl doesn't change the flavor of the beef at all.  Oh, I used "light" soy sauce.  Really yummy, something I'll make again.

Wonderful.  My husband raved about them.  
I used Petite Sirloin (it was more affordable)in place of the flank steak and it was very tender and easy to eat.  I think I will use more garlic next time and possibly some red pepper flakes too.  I served the skewers with Sesame Green Beans, sticky rice and Caravelle brand Sweet Chili Sauce which I buy at an Asian market.  
If you use bamboo skewers, don't forget to soak them in water for a couple hours.  I was rushing things and didn't soak them long enough, so the tips caught fire on the grill.

I used the marinade for grilled steak (rather then skewers) and it was fabulous!  I bet this would be a great marinade for pork or chicken too!

These skewers are great!  My kids love them and they are so easy to make.  Great summer recipe when it is just too hot to turn on the oven.

These skewers did not turn out very well at all, nobody rated them much and they were the only leftovers at my BBQ.  They'll be going in the bin!

Thanks Vivian for the great recipe!!The flavor reminded me of Korean BBQ beef ribs (Kal Bi). I followed the recipe EXACTLY however I used low sodium soy sauce and added 3 tablespoons of water to the marinade since others commented about the saltiness. It turned out perfect.  I served it as an entree with Jasmine rice and grilled zucchini.
I used flank steak and grilled it for about 12 minutes (well done for me) and about 8 minutes for my partner (med. rare for him). TY!!

Wonderful marinade.  The second time I made it... I marinaded  raw ship with this before putting them on the grill and the shrimp came out even better than the beef.  My guests have been raving about the "shrimp" on a stick.

I wasn't overly impressed with this recipe. I didn't have any sherry so I don't know how much of difference that made. It wasn't bad it just wasn't that good. My husband on the other hand gave it four stars. So it just may be a matter of taste.

This was very good. I didn't have any sherry and I forgot the barbeque sauce. Used a top sirloin and marinated about 8 hours. Will definitely make this again. Thanks.

These were great.  I cooked them in a pan rather than grilling them and they were still good.  Even my dad who hates ginger liked them.

I made these for Mother's Day this year along with some Shrimp Kabobs and Chicken Kabobs, but these Asian Skewers were the BEST!!!!  Everyone loved them.  They tasted like I ordered Asian Carryout, but much better.  I am planning on making them for a camping trip this fall.

Absolutely delicious! Having trouble finding sha cha sauce locally. I ended up using an Asian-style BBQ sauce this time and will probably buy the real stuff online so we can have this again. Fantastic, served with Basmati rice and veggies with stir fry sauce.

We liked this very much. Since it was still too cold to BBQ I did a stir fry with snow peas and served over rice. Maybe this summer we will try the skewers.

This was one of our favorites. I prepared it all in a gallon ziplock and then stuck it in the freezer. A week later when we were ready to grill, I took it out in the morning and let it defrost and marinade all day. Came home from work and threw it on the grill. It was sooooo yummy! Thank you!

I had never made beef skewers before but thought I would try them for my annual 4th of July party this year.  I made about 30 of them and when I went to the barbecue to get one - they were gone!  Devoured as they came off the grill!  I had to make them again the next weekend just so I could try one.  Delicious and so tender they melted in your mouth, just like everyone had told me at the barbecue.  Easy to make and wonderful!  Don't change a thing.

I did the overnight marinade time and it tasted like nothing but soy sauce...VERY salty soy sauce.The smell was incredible though so I may try again with much less soak time for my meat...flank steak is not exactly cheap.

I had a party of 40 comming to the house so I was looking for things to do on the grill.  This was THE BEST steak skewers we have ever done.  EVERYONE loved them and I had to print the recipe for several people.  I did use skirt steak instead of the flank but the smell and taste of these skewers is to die for.  I will definately be adding this to our regular grilling out menu.

Made this two times now.  I like my sauces a little sweeter, so I added a cup of Sprite (or a little less) to my marinade the second time around.  The family loved it!

Very nice flavor!  I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased.  The flavor was good, but i think I cut it a little too thick, which was my own fault.  Next time, I will slice it thinner.  Overall, it's a very good recipe.

Simply delicious.  I paired this with stir fry broccoli and asparagus.  I marinated for 2 days (only because I was busy) and it was very tender.  Great job!

Made this for a big Christmas party with very high hopes.   For me, it was just "okay".  Might be better as a main dish, but I found that it didn't taste very good when no longer hot, so not the perfect option for an appetizer buffet.  It is also quite a bit of work.

These were AWESOME!  They taste almost exactly like the ones you get at an asian restaraunt.  The only reason why I only gave it 4 is they were a bit salty to me.  I think next time I will use low sodium soy sauce to see if that helps with the saltiness.  I put these on top of white rice; yum!  I will definitely be making these again!

I just prepared these for a New Year's Eve bash at my sister's and everyone loved them! Since it was cold outside, I marinated the beef overnight and prepared on an indoor griddle. Instead of skewers, I prepared bell peppers and onions, paired with corn tortillas and we had beef fajitas. They were a huge hit at our bash, and I will definitely make again!!!

After tasting our neighbor's version of this recipe I had to find it on Allrecipes.com (where they told me they'd found it). I made it a week later, following the recipe to the T and was bowled over! Since then I've made this recipe about a dozen times and always receive rave reviews.  Generally, I do not stray from the recipe except when I don't have green onions which I substitute fresh chives from my herb garden for.  Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe!

I made this for the first time tonight. It was excellent. I didn't have any sherry so I skipped it and it was still great. I look forward to making it again with the sherry this time.

Very tasty and easy.  I actually did on the skillet because it was not a good grilling night.  I think that next time, if I do it inside, I'm going to skip the skewers.  I always worry when cooking with flank steak because it can get so tough - but this was wonderful.

I really liked the taste of these. My family wasn't as big a fan as I was. I thought they had the right amount of taste but my husband thought it could have used more. So perhaps marinating overnight would help with that. Putting the meat on the skewers was a bit of a pain but worth it because they were fun to eat. I omitted the hoisin sauce and cooked them in a very hot oven (475) for about 10 minutes. But keep an eye on them. I would love to try with shrimp.  To complete the meal I made 'Japanese-Sytle Sesame Green Beans' and plain jasmine rice. Fun.
P.S. I had about 10-15 left over and didn't know how to warm them back up for leftovers without drying out. So I put together a soup. Heat 6 cups broth (beef and/or vegetable) and add dashes of ginger powder, garlic powder, s&p. Then add cut up meat, cooked carrots, cooked green beans, cooked rice. Very tasty.

Yum...used chicken instead because that is what I had on hand---only marinated it for about 2 hours.  Served with fried rice.  Not my favorite marinate, but, still good.

I've prepared this recipie in two different ways. First was what the original recipie called for.  The other varation was to subsitute the sherry for rice vinegar. Both were equally superb. Very tasty recipie.

we love this recipe, and it also works really well on veggies.  you double the recipe and put wedges of bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions in a separate ziplock bag from the meat to marinate (doesn't have to marinate as long as the meat).  also works incredibly well with cherry tomatoes; their flavor with the marinade is outstanding and they burst open and their skins char when on the grill.

My husband and I kept drooling for more after they were all gone! I didn't have any flank steak so I ended up using just some cuts of cubed steak and it worked really really well. Also marinated them overnight and by the time they were cooked they were so tender they were falling off the skeweres. Also didn't have any sherry and it didn't make a difference. I served with some jasmine rice! A keeper!

I am rating it 5 on behalf of my family, who devoured it. My daughter does not eat any beef at all, but will eat it in Chinese restaurant dishes occasionally-so I took a shot she might like it -she loved it, so did my 12 yr old son. I give it 4 stars, alittle too strong tasting for me, I think it was the hoisen. I did cook on gas grill in 40 degree weather, and had meat rip apart as I moved it from grill-definitely does stick to grill.
I will certainly make this again when it gets warmer, and maybe try using skirt steak or even chicken. One word of caution, I cut meat in too small strips, try to stick to size in directions.

I started marinating the night before and grilled early the following evening. EXCELLENT! We enjoyed these a lot. 1 or 2 skewers were a bit dried out, watch the flames - these grill up quick.

Flavor was good, but flank steak is too tough.  I bought two different flank steaks for a bbq, which took forever to cut into thin slices (although it helps a lot when its partially frozen).  One flank steak was much more tender than the other.  I would recommend buying a good cut of meat, marinating in cubes, and shish-ka-bobbing instead of skewering.

Awesome recipe!  I used flank steak, followed the recipe exactly and marinated, as instructed, overnight.  The flavor was superb and the meat was so-o-o tender.  Will use this recipe often.  Thank you for sharing.

YUMOLA! Making the marinade is a little work but it is definitely worth it. I bought a sirloin steak tip cut that was thick & the results were perfect! I also let the meat marinate about 10 hours. DELICIOUS!

Really good but the meat wasn't as tender as I was hoping.  Perhaps I didn't get the greatest cut of meat or the fact that I only let it marinate for about 3 hrs.  Also, I cut the slices thicker, about 1".  Next time, I'll cut them thin, like the recipe recommended, and let it marinate overnight.

Fantastic beef skewers full of flavor! I alternated pieces of steak with a variety of vegetable pieces as I threaded the skewers. Meat marinated for 24 hours and was super tender. I used rib eye steak. I also did not discard the remnants of marinade, and instead thickened it in a small pan and used to brush over the meat and veggies as they were grilling. I really cannot write enough to convey just how awesome the flavor was, even thinking about it makes my mouth water. If you are fancying asian flavor meat - this is the recipe to try!

Yeah, baby... that's what I'm talkin 'bout.  So good!  The marinade is delicious.  I used plum sauce (the store was out of hoisin sauce, what the heck?), and rib eye steak (we only eat red meat every now and then - I didn't want to blow it with a cheap cut).  I skewed the meat with some red onion and mushrooms, and "BAM", huge smiles all around.

My husband loves Chinese food and loved this but I am not a huge fan of any Asian food with the exception of sushi. While the meat was perfectly grilled the flavor was too much like Teriyaki jerky and not in a good way.  My low rating has to do with my personal likes/dislikes and not so much the actual recipe.  If I made this again, I would need to use less hoisin and perhaps ginger.

These were okay but we felt that they had way too much ginger.  I did marinate them overnight so maybe that made it stronger?  I doubt I'll try this again but if I did I would use less than half of the ginger.

Perfect as they are!  Made them as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and was a bit leary but they were awesome.  Everyone wanted more!  I did go to an upsale meat market and bought good quality flank steak making this rather pricey but it was so worth it.  I let the meat marinate for 48 hours.

I made a few slight modifications to this.  I didn’t have fresh ginger root so I used dried ginger, cutting back to about 1/2 t.  I also used top sirloin instead of flank steak.  I increased the marinade by half and used part to marinade the beef.  I tossed the remaining marinade with bell peppers, onions, mushrooms and zucchini and grilled the veggies in a grill pan.   This was very good.  Served over Orzo and Rice by C. Crane, also from this site.

I prepared these in the morning and my husband grilled them later in the day and they were extremely tender, tasty and flavorful.  I used Sweet Baby Rays Barbque sauce for the 1 Tbsp it called for. This is definitely a keeper that we will make time and time again!

I loved the taste of these skewers!!  I marinated my meat for about 5 hours and they came out fantastic.  I served with white rice and stir fry veggies.  I will be making this again!!  :)

Didn't change anything in the recipe. Marinated for 48 hrs in the fridge. Was very good. Even better tasting as leftovers the next day.

We made this recipe for our Labor Day cookout yesterday, and they went fast!  My husband forgot to add the ginger to the marinade and they still turned out great.  I think he added a little bit of dark sesame oil to the marinade as well.  We'll be sure to include the ginger next time for extra flavor.  Both my sister and best friend demanded the recipe.  We're doubling this recipe next time!

Don't look any further for a beef skewer marinade or beef satay recipe. This is it! I loved it, it's exactly the taste I was hoping for. I used flank steak, marinated for exactly 2 hours. It was sooo tender and flavorful, I was really pleasantly surprised. I sub'd rice vinegar as one reviewer suggested. Served with peanut sauce, rice and shrimp. De-lish! Thanks so much, Vivian!!

This recipe was excellent. I used a type of meat, called flap steak, which I generally use for Asian and Mexican recipes. I only marinated it for 1 hour, and instead of threading the strips onto skewers, I put the beef and marinade in a broiler pan lined with foil and cooked the dish in a very hot oven for about 15 minutes (too cold outside!). The result was extremely tender and flavorful meat. I served it over jasmine rice accompanied by Sweet and Spicy Green Beans from this site. My husband and teenage children loved it. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Fantastic. We marinated for 2 days (we had seafood in the fridge that needed to be eaten first), but once we got to eating it, it was wonderful, truly. We grilled it with some 
broccoli and green onion and served over rice. It was truly amazing, better than any takeout. Thanks!

I didn't get the skewers and had to spatula the strips on and off the grill. They were incredible. I only had time to marinate for 90 minutes. Still very tender. This is how I'm cooking flank steak from now on. Thanks for recipe!

Great!  I used 1lb tender cubed beef instead of flank steak.  Marinated 24hr.  I drained the beef, boiled the marinade then added it to stir-fried green beans and canned mushrooms.  We loved the whole meal.

These are very tasty. I made these along with other kabob recipes from this site (Pineapple Chicken Tenders, Chili-Lime Chicken, Mushroom Kabobs) for a big potluck this summer. They were definitely a crowd pleaser. I was asked for the recipe numerous times and referred everyone to allrecipes.com! Thanks!

I thought these were so good!  My only suggestion would be to oil your barbecue before putting them on because mine stuck, other than that this was a great recipe.

This is a fabulous marinade!  I didn't have any sherry so I substituted beef boullion instead and I used 2 tsp. BBQ sauce.  I marinated it overnite (about 20 hours as it turned out!), threaded the meat on skewers, and broiled them for 6 min (3 min per side).  They were perfect!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I used chicken instead of flank steak. My mother-in-law couldn't get over the delicious meal I had prepared.  The ingredients were easily put together in a bowl, no fuss.  I will use this recipe over and over again!

Great party food.  It was a hit.  I substituded tri-tip in place of the flank steak;  the meat melted in your mouth.

Really fantastic but I can't stop the skewers from burning on the grill. I served it with Thai-Style Peanut Sauce with Honey and they were a hit. I made way too many (half beef, half chicken) and had leftover uncooked meat. No problem, I pulled the meat off the sticks and stir fried in the pan. I used Sirloin as it was a lot cheaper than Flank Steak.

This is the BEST marinade.  I didn't make the Beef Skewers but just marinated the Flank Steak all day in this sauce and then put it on the BBQ.  What a Fabulous taste.  You have to try this.

Savory!  I basically followed Jillians suggestions from using low sodium, vinegar, and which bbq sauce.  Fr the next time though, im going to try out regular soy sauce because it short on the salty side.

Made these tonight exactly as recipe specified, and they were fantastic.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I did marinate them late last night to cook for tonight's dinner, so the meat had soaked in the marinade for close to 24 hours.  Killer taste and tenderness.

Wonderful flavor! Made no changes, but did use low-sodium soy, as always.  Beef was not as tender as it should have been, because I forgot to make the marinade yesterday and it only had 1 hour. Luckily, I was using London broil leftover from a previous recipe. The sauce is truly delicious! I only used 3/4 lb meat but made all the sauce, boiling the remaining to pour over our rice. Very, very good, and can only think it would be worth more than 5 stars if I'd let it marinate overnight. The hoisin made the dish and I'll be adding it to my standard beef stri-fry sauce from now on. Thanks for a great easy recipe!

I'm impressed! I've never been able to cook flank steak. This turned out soooo tender!  I cooked in a skillet instead of the grill. Next time I need to buy more steak. The kids actually wanted 2nds!

Loved this! I took another reader's advice and used rice wine vinegar instead of sherry, then cooked and thickened the sauce to use over jasmine rice.  Delicious!

Wonderful blend of flavors!  Followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting red onions for green, since that's what I had.  I marinated the meat all day, and grilled the meat with mushrooms and onions in the evening.  Perfect blend of sweet and spicy!!  Will make again and again...!!

This was very tasty, but I could see where it might be a bit too salty if sitting overnight. I marinate about 4 hours. I have made this twice now and the second time I added yogurt and instead of mincing the ginger just added slices of it. It was fantastic both times!

Excellent way to cook flank steak.  My grill wasn't working when I tried this, so I used the broiler.  I broiled it whole and sliced it against the grain. That worked fine.  Also substituted powdered ginger since I didn't have fresh. Anxious to try it on the skewers and grill!

Hello!!! This was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I was hesitant to use flank steak at first because I thought it would be tough, but it melted in our mouths!  I think the fact that I marinated it overnight made it more tender.  When I make this in the future I may add a little honey to the marinade.  I like a little sweetness to my asian food.  Either way, this recipe is something I will make again and again.  My husband loved it too.

I couldn't swing the flank steak price, so I used london broil instead and it was absolutely delicious.  I omitted green onions and put mushrooms, red pepper and onions on the skewers.  Served over white rice.

These are awesome!  I cooked a big batch of these this past Sat. morning before the Jimmy Buffett concert.  I stopped grilling a couple minutes short and sealed those babies up nice and tight in some tupperware.  At the tailgate, I re-glazed them with the leftover marinade and put them back over a medium het charcoal grill with the top up just long enough to reheat them.  Let me tell you, they were the hit of the party (alcohol not included of course)!!!

Delicious!  I marinated the meat for a little less than 24 hours and they were extremely flavorful and tender.  Very simple to prepare and amazingly fast to grill.  Definitely the best beef skewers I've ever made!

Made this with white wine because I did not have sherry on hand. Came out GREAT! I took another reviewer's advice and let the steak defrost only partially and then sliced it nice and easy. It was a 5 out of 5 with all family members present- 2 of which were kids. The meat was so tender, it melted in your mouth!
EXCELLENT!

Good recipe.  I used top sirloin and sliced very thin.  Marinated most of the day and was really pleased with the result on the BBQ.  The thickness of the meat and length of time on the BBQ, along with the marinade are the keys to perfectly cooked meat.

I am finally rating this recipe after using it many many times in the past few years.

This marinade is spectacular.  Every time I make it, I am asked for the recipe.  The flank steak always turns out tender and delicious.  We grill extra and turn it into stir fry.  

I've used it on chicken and pork also, always with good results.

I was looking for something different to do with tri tip and I happened to have almost everying on hand for this.  I cut a tri tip roast into some big chunks and marinated for about 4 hours.  I subbed dry ginger and left out the green onions.  The flavor of the marinade permeated the meat well even though it was in larger chunks then the recipe called for.  It was a tasty change and everyone loved it.

I made this recipe using tri-tip sliced 1/4" thick.  The meat is more tender than flank steak.  You must marinate at least 24 hrs for the meat to absorb all the marinade and tenderize whatever meat you use.  I grilled them on the BBQ grill for just about 3 minutes per side so they are just medium well.  I placed the meat on top of a platter with sliced pineapple, then sprinkled sesame seeds on top for nice presentation for a party... and of course, everyone wanted the recipe!

WOW! Marinated for 5 hours for an appetizer for a party and of course my propane went out so I sauteed them over the stove and put toothpicks in them to serve.  Everyone was RAVING about them! They all wanted the recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!

These are a big hit with our family, and at barbecues where they have been taken.  Very tasty and tender.  Good marinated for even an hour or two, but great marinated overnight!  We've never had sherry on hand, so just substituted 1 1/2 Tbsp. each vinegar and oil.

This was WONDERFUL.  The only change I made was dried ginger instead of fresh, I didn't have fresh.. but I don't think it mattered.  This marinade would be good on chicken and shrimp, even salmon.  YUMMMMMM... My husband raved.  Can't wait to dig into the leftovers tomorrow for lunch.

Simply delicious!  I make this often!  I did the same as someone suggested and used rice vinegar instead of sherry.  I have also tried on one occasion added chinese chili garlic sauce to add additional flavor and heat.  I also did not cut the flank steak and simply grilled it whole and sliced it after it was cooked.  I have used the marinade on chicken as well as pork and was wonderful also.  This is great with white rice!

I would give this 100 stars if I could!  I really enjoy cooking, but the one thing I find difficult to make at home is asian food.  It never seems as good as at a restaurant.  Well, these beef skewers are even better than I've ever had a restaurant.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I subsituted rice vinegar for the sherry- not something I usually have.  I let the beef marinade for about 6 hours.  It was incredibly tender.  Sometimes, I've had trouble with flank steak being a little tough, but this just melted in your mouth.  It was kind of a pain skewering all those slices of meat, but it was worth it in the end!

Great recipe and easy to prepare.  I served them with Sesame Green Beans, Peanut butter noodles and a wonderful mandarin orange/almond salad with Marie's Asian Vinaigrette Dressing from the store.  This made a wonderful dinner party!

This was great! I didn't "skewer" them, but served the beef with homemade fried rice. I let the meat marinade overnight. Great as leftovers too! I bet it would be great on chicken, shrimp or scallops!

Incredible flavor, so tender it melts in your mouth.  Your taste buds say "Yippee...I want more".  Everyone likes them.

An absolutely wonderful recipe!  I used the marinade on strip steaks on the grill and they were fantastic.  I forgot green onions, so I used fresh minced onions and a sprinkle of dried chives.  Also added black pepper to the mix. I'm making this for my Mom and using the skewers and small bite-sized pieces of beef, she's having wrist surgery next week, so lifting the stick and no fork/knife will be great for her.  Thanks, Vivian!

This recipe is so easy and delicious!!!  I found this recipe three years ago on allrecipes when my husband and I first got married.  He is by far, the world's pickiest eater, so finding recipes that we both would like is always a chore. :)  But this has been his favorite dish and he asks me to make it all the time.

Fantastic!  I reserved the marinade, boiled it to make a sauce for stir-fryed vegetables. Served the beef skewers and stir-fryed vegetables over rice.  Garnished with Chinese noodles.  Even the kids ate it all!

Was not bad. I followed the directions exactly as directed. It is definitly missing something. Had a strange flavor. I think adding a little brown sugar would improve this. It was almost a metallic taste. Probably will stick with my current recipe.

I needed 8 servings but used 3 lbs of flank steak figuring I would have left overs for the next day.  There was not one skewer left!  Even my friends picky 10 yr old who doesn't eat too much meat had 3.  Need I say more??? :-)  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks Vivian for sharing!

I doubled the marinade, used 3/4 of it to marinade a larger flank steak.  The remainder I tossed with raw shrimp for 15 minutes, then grilled them also.  What a hit--everything was devoured!

Tried this recipe over the Easter weekend and it was so so at best.  Nothing special, in fact it was not something I would try again.  First of all, the flavor is too plain, and not enough "zip" to it. If these satays were offered at a party, I would not help myself to seconds, unless there was nothing else to eat. My own creations are much better. The ingredients offered in this recipe are just average ingredients, none of which I would consider the "secret ingredient" to a good satay stick.

What a disappointment. :(

Just made this again last night and always love it!  We have used this same marinade on chicken and beef.  I found I didn't like having pieces of minced ginger on the meat, so went to using ground ginger instead.  Tasty, tasty, tasty.  Thank you.

Made this for a Father's Day BBQ, all my guests raved! It was very tasty and quite easy. I will make it again but next time I may use a bit less Hoisin sauce, it seemed to be a little flavor domineering.

These turned out great!  I didn't use the BBQ sauce because I wasn't sure how it would 'work' with the other ingredients, but added a tablespoon of brown sugar instead.    I will definitely try these again.

I made this without the sherry since I didn't have any and it turned out great! I've never used hoisin sauce before and it gave them a very unique flavor! I took some to a cookout and several friends agreed that they turned out good as well. I'll definitely be making this again!

We made these for our recent camping trip.   I added an extra clove of garlic as we love our garlic.  I didn't have any sherry on hand, so used apple cider vinegar. To substitute the apple cider vinegar for sherry, use half the amount, and add the same part water, so 1.5 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, and 1.5 table spoons of water)  I left it to marinade for 2 full days, and cooked over briquettes.  Was absolutely amazing!!

I used it for pork spare ribs.  It needs the salt and pepper that are not mentioned and could certainly do with some chilli.  Icannot find sherry, in spite of living next door to Spain, so I used white porto.  Next time I will used cognac.  I had lovely meaty ribs and they were delicious.  The next time I will try it with fish/sea food.

I used the marinade as is on Sirloin steak tips as my grocer did not have any flank steak this week and we were pleased with the taste. The marinade was not difficult and I let it set 24 hours and it was not over powering either. Will make again.

This one is a keeper.   The trick of cutting the meat when it's partially frozen is key.   I marinated overnight and it was spectacular and tender.

This is really easy with great results. I doubled the marinade amounts and used more ginger root. I used skirt steak and garnished it with cilantro.It was great. Thanks for the recipe. Everyone liked it. I served it with Jasmine rice made with ginger, garlic and cilantro, and mandarin oranges on the side. YUM.

Very good.  I only marinated for 2 hours and the meat was a little tough but the flavor was amazing.  Next time I am going to marinate over night and I think it will be much more tender.

I will definitely try this, sounds wonderful. I'm wondering how anyone (a reviewer) could possibly substitute rice vinegar for the sherry, they are so different in taste. The sherry has a nutty, wonderful taste and the rice vinegar is 'just that' "vinegar" That must have changed the whole recipe taste. I will do it the way that Vivian wrote it, the way it's supposed to be.

I thought this was fabulous.  The only change I made was to use red wine instead of sherry.  I also just used this on a London Broil and then sliced it against the grain.  Best London Broil ever.

Very good. I used round steak instead of the flank, and had to use ground ginger because I would never have had used all of the fresh. I also served it over white rice that I cooked in chicken stock.

These were wonderful, and looked great as a party appetizer! I only marinated them for 2 hours because they were a last-minute decision, but turned out great anyway. Will definitely be making again.

Delicious beef skewers! I made these for a small group of friends, and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly, and definitely thought using good quality flank steak makes a big difference.

This was delicious, the flavor wasn't overpowering.  If you want real authentic soy sauce, try "Golden Mountain" brand soysauce at your local asian store.

This was very good recipe and I would try it again but modify it to add a slight sweetness to the meat.  We marinaded 10 hrs and I think I would try 8 hrs as the meat was on the verge of going "mushy"

My family absolutely loved these!  They disappeared in no time, and I've been informed that they will now be anticipated at least once a month.  We fixed soba noodles and sauteed veggies to go with it, and also made one of the terayaki chicken recipes.  It was really great!  I ended up having to broil them since we don't have an outdoor grill.  I let them broil for about three minutes on each side, and they were perfect.  They might be even better on a real grill.  I tried one or two on my big George Foreman grill, but they were kind of dried up, so we switched to the broiler.  I'll definitely be repeating this one!

We thought these were excellent, although the kids didn't care for them much.  They were salty and the skewers burned so next time I'll remember to use low sodium soy sauce and to soak the skewers in water first.  Thanks for sharing!

I tried to cheat and cooked a few on the ol' George inside after just a few hours in the marinade.  Don't to that!.  Too much liquid and the meat steamed and got tough.  I also found it really needs  24 hrs for the flavor is sink in. Will do again.

These were delicious.  Only change I made was I used marsala wine because I didn't have any sherry.  You have to cut the flank steak on a diagonal otherwise the meat will be tough.  I marinated for 30 plus hours and they were so tender.

These were so delicious! For best results buy the flank/skirt steak! It is so tender and works so well on skewers. It is important to cut against the grain of the meat or else you may end up with stringy/chewy meat. Also try using Saki (japanese rice wine)instead of the sherry.. sooo delicious!

Great recipe! Fantastic flavor and easy to make. I found they taste even better when they are slightly burnt. Cook on high heat when on the grill and watch them to make sure they dont burn too much. Will make over and over, every tender, very tasty!

I made these with a bunch of other appitizers this past Football Sunday. I followed the recipe to as stated and marinaded it over night. I broiled them in the oven 5 minutes each side. They were tasty and tender, but you have to make sure and not leave them out for too long, because they dry out Quick!!  Next time, I'll make them for just my family and serve them over some Jasmine Rice!  Yum....

These were very flavorful will definately make again. They grill fast so dont even go to the fridge for another beer. TIP: For anyone like myself who never used skewers before and have a habit of not reading directions. Soak the skewers in water for like an hour. Wood skewers will burn! Luckily these tasted so good that I quickly got over my blunder.

Prepared exactly as recipe called for and I wouldn't change a thing. Key to this dish is sharp knife to slice meat.  Cooked this in the broiler for 3 min. each side.  You can send hubby out to pick up your favorite chinese soup, fried rice, egg rolls, etc.  It was just 4 of us and we only wanted to nosh so we had egg rolls, fried rice and the skewers and the sauce from the pan was outrageous over the rice.  Will definitely make this again.

Made this last night as a test run for Father's Day.....it was excellent!! I did not cut the meat into strips and skewer them, just left the flank steak whole and did marinate for 24 hours. The flavors were fantastic. I will be making the actual skewers for Father's Day and can only imagine how much better they will taste as that yummy marinade soaks into the thin strips of meat! I'm so excited, made this with grilled asparagus and tossed salad. Also, I reserved the rest of the marinade and brought it to a boil for a few minutes to serve on the side for extra dipping. Thanks for a great recipe!

VERY VERY GOOD! I wouldn't change anything except add more garlic and slice the meat just slightly thicker than recipe calls for.  Mine were hard to keep on the skewers being sliced so thin. Flavor was awesome and I would definitely use flank steak if possible rather than subbing a different cut of meat. (Especially if you like a very lean cut) Can't wait to make this again.

We used flank steak and marinated overnight.  Nobody really liked the flavor or the texture.  I think that the reviewer who recommended a cheaper cut of meat may have been right.  Also, although most of the time it seems that the longer meat is marinated the better, in this instance a shorter time in the marinade might have been better.

This recipe is sooo awesome.  I made it for a BBQ, and now everyone wants the recipe. After a while alot of the marinades start to taste the same, with the soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and so on, but this one is different. I think it's the BBQ sauce that sets it apart. Yummy!!

Oh if only I could give 10 stars! The only substitution I made was to use white wine instead of sherry because that's what I had. My batch didn't come out too salty at all as some folks complained. My only explanation for this is that I only ever use low-sodium soy sauce. I don't know if this is what made the difference, though. I also lightly sprinkled sesame seeds on a few of the skewers the last few minutes of grilling. I've never cooked with hoisin sauce or even ginger root before so I was a little leary, but oh my gosh! For our bbq yesterday, I used several recipes from this site: the basil shrimp skewers were the second biggest hit. I also tried the basic kabobs recipe just with veggies (was just eh. Probably won't make again.), BBQ Sausage & Peppers (next time will just throw the Johnsonville Brats on the grill instead of going thru all this trouble), and then did our old standby of marinading overnight chicken breast chunks in Italian dressing (the third best recipe of the day). Vivian, thank you SO much for your recipe!

This was excellent.  I marinated it for 2 hours and it turned out perfectly.  My 3 year old was trying to grab them off the grill.  I used the flank steak and the meat was melt in your mouth tender.  My 16th month old little girl couldn't get enough.  Needless to say we will be making it again.  Thanks!

Why did this sit in my recipe box for a year before I tried it?!  It's one of the best steak marinades that I've ever had!  It wasn't distinctively asian, but I got tired of grating the ginger root--perhaps this was my fault.  Anyhow, I will definitely use this recipe again.  Hubby and 3 year old ate it up.  My two year old thought the meat made a good projectile.

Amazing!  A huge hit.  I didn't think they could live up to the rave reviews these have been getting but they sure did.  Marinated for about 8 hours, was afraid they might be salty but they were delicious!  Will definitely make again.

I marinated the beef overnight and the meat was so tender.  My friends had a grilling "contest" and I came in 2nd place... although after hearing everyone's verbal feedback, I know in my heart the the contest was rigged and I should have come in first!  Ha ha!  This is a great recipe.

I made this recipe for a luau last weekend and they were so good that I didn't get to try any. I made a lot of different kabobs, but everyone raved about these kabobs in particular.  It was very easy to put together.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was wonderful!!!  My husband just loved it!  I didn't have Sherry, but it still seemed great!  I doubled the marinated, becuz I love sauce serviced with rice.  The kids didnt' care for it,but that's okay.  Give this one a try.  Will make again for friends very 
soon. Made a dozen times sometimes using ginger powder 1/2 tsp always loved!

This was wonderful!  I didn't have any green onions, but used 1 tsp onion powder instead.  The hoisin made the sauce stick to the skewers.  I have also made this using shrimp with excellent results!  Serve with grilled zucchini, fresh pineapple and steamed rice on the side!  Yum!

I have used recipes from this site often, but this Asian recipe is a once a week deal for our family.  If you love Asian food...you will ABSOLUTELY love this recipe.  Sometimes we will cut back on the ginger just a tad because it can be over-powering for the kids, but it is the BEST.  It is the only recipe I have found that EVERYONE totally loves, even younger children.

I LOVED this recipe!  The marinade is so quick to throw together and the flavor is fantastic.  This is exactly the recipe I was looking for! (Note: I left out the green onions and the flavor was still perfect.)

I made these for a party and everyone scarfed them up.  These were very good, and easy.  I even enlisted my 12yo to thread the beef on the skewers.

I didn't change anything in the recipe!  It was fantastic!  1.5 lbs of flank steak provides at least 4 servings (recipe says 3 servings.)  I marinaded for 2 hours only but I could see that a longer marinade time would make it even better, if that's possible.

This was easy and very tasty!  We only marinated for two hours and they turned
out great with lots of flavor.  This is great as appetizer or as a main meal with a salad.

Superb recipe!! I've gotten fed up with the tasteless food local Chinese restaurants have been delivering to my home. Thus, I've resumed making my own from my extensive Chinese cookbook collection and this is an outstanding addition to my files.

This was awesome!  Everyone loved it!!  I didn’t use the skewers and cooked it on the stove.  I used tenderloin (what I had defrosted) and marinated it for 24 hours.  Will make again!

This is an amazing recipe as is, no changes needed! It's my favorite go to recipe when I need something fast and easy; I don't skew them usually I just throw them on a broiler pan. I've marinated for less than the time suggested and it's still great too!

The hoisin sauce painted on by itself is just how the restaurant do it. Goes good on Beef Tenderloin Strips and even chicken. It caramelize on the grill just great. I love painting beef with hoisin sauce and saw this twist on marination. I did substitute oyster sauce for the barbecue sauce. Fresh ginger root in anything Asian is a must. Overall, the hoisin sauce is the flavor that still makes these great to eat.

Oh my GOSH is this recipe DELICIOUS!   I made it exactly as shown with the exception of the flank steak which I was unable to get.  I asked my butcher his recommendation, and he had some very thinly sliced sirloin tip strips which he said would be very similar.  I marinated it for 6 hours - and the meat was incredibly tender.  Reading through the reviews- I found one from the original poster of this recipe who recommended a particular Asian BBQ sauce only found in Asian markets.  As I was unable to acquire that, I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hawaiian BBQ sauce - and I think it added the perfect flavor.  I tripled the recipe as I was cooking for 8 people (and wanted some leftovers too!)  Everyone RAVED about how good it was - and I think we all overate!  I will most definitely be making this again and again!  As an aside, I made a cold spicy peanut noodle salad to accompany these and it was a perfect combination!

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I did a couple of things differently. I didn't have sherry, so I used rice wine as another reviewer suggested. I also used flat iron steak instead of flank steak because my grocery store had it on sale. I was short on time, so I only marinated them for an hour. The flavor is exceptional! Everyone raved about them! Can't wait to make them again!

Wonderful recipe!  Followed the directions but eliminated the barbeque sauce.. and this turned out perfect.  I did marinate for about 6 hours too.   I've never been able to use flank steak, it's always just too tough, but these were perfect!   Definitely a hit in my family...

Made this exactly as written, the only exception was that I did not have green onions so added a little granulated onion. I marinated it for only the two hours and it was plenty flavorful. I am thinking those who say it needs to be marinated longer must not be cutting the flank steak in 1/4 inch strips. This cooks very quickly. It is the most tender and flavorful flank steak I have had!

Easy and yummy!  Used brown sugar instead of BBQ sauce as another reviewer suggested.  Perfect!

We really liked this.  Served it up in a lightly grilled tortilla with broccoli slaw and slivered almonds for flavor and texture. Even better for lunch the next day.

These were so good! I made it exactly like the recipe but cooked the skewers on my george foreman grill instead of a regular grill. The meat was tender and flavorful and the marinade was really easy to make! I marinated mine all night.

I tried this recipe awhile back and it tastes just like my family's recipe. If you're grilling you should try slicing the beef thin. I think they come out better. Tender and juicy and take no time to cook at all. Plus there's more to go around. :) Which is what your family and friends will want!

Incredible!  We love it.  I wouldn't marinate the meat any more than what the recipe says - overnight would be too much.  The last 1 1/2 hours before cooking I threw some cleaned uncooked shrimp into the bag with the beef and let it marinate.  A terrific duo of meat!

I made these last night.  It was okay.  The meat was tender, but the flavoring wasn't that good, and I followed the recipe.  It didn't have much flavor.

Just gorgeous. I used a different cut of beef and cubed them, just out of habit really, but the taste was sensational! I marinated overnight and you could see how much the meat had tenderised - I guess thats mostly down to the sherry. Mmmm. Yummy. Thanks for sharing.

Fabulous! Even the leftovers served cold were great. I did add onions, but they need to be pre-cooked a bit as the grilling time isn't enough for them.

Holy cow (ha ha, no pun intended) is this good!!!  I'm not a red meat fan and my husband's not a my-cooking-fan so there were 2 strikes already against this recipe.  Everyone, my husband, 3 of our kids, and myself, all loved this recipe!  (Only the 1 year old spit it out - not surprising since it didn't come out of a Kix box.)  I marinaded it for about 4 hours but really, the only change was that I made it stove top in a pan instead of on the grill (rainy night) so the fact that it was still good, I can't wait to actually try it grilled!  Really, really worth making again!!!

Great flavor! I used 1/4 tsp ground ginger instead of the Tbsp of fresh ginger. Did not have a flank steak so maybe the meat I used is why we found it a little tough or maybe I didn't slice it thin enough. Anyway this recipe was awesome as for as flavor and I will be making this one again.

Deelish; I've used this marinade on regular packages of stirfry beef and it's still good.  I would cut back an eensy bit on the soy, though.

This is soooo good!  In error my husband cooked the strips of beef in a pan, without being skewered, and it was still great.  Definitely an option for those without a grill.  Pan must be screaming hot and cooked in small batches.  We will make these again (on the grill though!) The flavor is great.

Fabulous just the way it is.  Nice because you can prepare it ahead of time and then just grill for your company!

OMG!!!This was amazing. The market didn't have flank so I had to use skirt steak. It was awesome. Made it on the grill as an entree.

Very good flavor.  Marinated overnight & used a top round steak rather than flank steak.  Would have liked some sort of a sauce to put on or dip in.  We ate with white rice for dinner and was very tasty!  This ones's a keeper...thanks for posting!

This turned out excellent. I followed recipe exactly and needed no changes. I have been searching for something like this forever. A local chinese restaurant makes something like these and haven't been able to find anywhere else. They are delicious and didn't last long at my Christmas Eve party. Thanks for the recipe!

These were amazingly good!  So full of flavor.  My flank steak was only a pound rather than a pound and a half so the amount of marinade was perfect.  We let it marinade about 8 and 1/2 hours and there was plenty of flavor. I did as another reviewer suggested and put the steak in the freezer for about 1/2 hour which made it easier to cut.  Makes a lot of little skewers.  Perfect for  a barbeque serving finger food.  I will make these again, a lot.  Thanks so much for the recipe it was wonderful and so simple to whip up.

This had great flavor, but I thought the meat was too tough.  It was not overcooked either.  I might make this recipe with a different cut of meat.

I thought this was very tasty. I specifically used the flank steak. Although it is expensive, it is worth the cost. I will make this again.

Maybe I did something wrong with what I ended up having to substitute.  None of our grocery stores or my butcher had flank steak available so I used what the guy told me would be about the same.  I also used this marinade on some sirloin that I had left in the fridge from the family pack last night.   Maybe I marinated to long because they didn't brown well and came out mushy. (36 hours--obviously too long)  I couldn't find Hoisin sauce either so I have not a clue as to what that would have added to the flavor. I have every asian sauce but that one!   This is also too much ginger for me.  I have decided that I don't like fresh ginger at all now--my skewers tasted too much like a lemon! I will try again when I find the sauce and I will have the butcher order flank steak for me.

These were very tender and tasty. The only changes I made were from other users' suggestions. I replaced the sherry with rice vinegar and used 1/4 tsp dry ginger since those were things I had on hand. Served with slightly buttered rice, mixed veggies and a salad. One of the guys we had over couldn't stop eating them and couldn't believe how great they tasted. We will be making these again.

This was good and I can't figure out what to do to make it better.  We enjoyed this.  Just isn't 5 stars.  I did let it soak for a day and a half in the sauce though.  I planned on making it for lunch and had it the following day for dinner.

This was very good.  I didn't have sherry so I substituted Marsala wine (I'm not sure it matters what you use because it acts as a tenderizer), I also didn't have Hoisen sauce, but had a stir fry sauce from Trader Joes's that I substituted.  I used flank steak and sliced the meat at 1/2 inch.  I marinated for around 8 hours (prepared in the morning and on the grill at 7pm)  I will make these again.  Thanks for the recipe-

We love these.  I have a hard time finding flank steak and it's expensive so I've used cheaper cuts and it's still very good, though a little tough sometimes if I go too cheap.  We've also substituted with chicken, which I think I like even more.

WOW great! I think i marinated mine for too long more than 24 hours and it turned out extra tender - falling off the skewers while on the bbq.. Next time I'll try it for 3 hours instead and maybe slice my flank steak a little thicker... Great flavor mmmm thx for sharing

Wow, were these ever good!  My family gobbled them up in no time.  I thought I had made too many; they said they had wished there were more.  I followed the recipe exactly and I think it was perfect.

Out Of This World!!!  I marinated London Broil with this marinade for 24 hours then grilled.  This is by far the best tasting flank steak marinade we have had in a long time.  I added sesame oil to the ingredients for more of an Asian taste.   Absolutely fantastic!!!!!

I didn't get to have a taste test myself because it disappeared as soon as they were off the grill! This was my first bbq party and I was nervous because I don't cook and I needed good recipes. I got a lot of compliments from this recipe ! Very happy that everyone loved it! Will definitely make again!

This was nice but not brilliant. I only marinated for 6 hours and it was enough. Any longer and the soy sauce would make the meat to salty.

This is a family favorite - the flavor is fabulous and so easy to make.  I haven't used flank steak, yet - we just marinate steak!

YUMMY!!!!!!! I used Certified Angus Top Sirlon Cheateu Briand per recommendation from the butcher. (I don't know anything about cuts of meat and i needed help). It was fantastic! I marinated over night and the only change i might make is to add a little more ginger. I may not have added enough in the first place because I did not measure the amount of ginger and i just eyeballed it. I cut the meat into cubes and we did kabobs and we cooked the meat about medium rare to medium . Perfect. We did have a chicken kabob that was the favorite of the night but I really loved this recipe. I have now been named the offical bringer and preparer of meats for the little get togethers some of my friends and i have.

I only marinated for 5 hours and this was still a great recipe. I think marinating overnight would make this even better. We'll be making this again!!

These were very good! I used sirloin instead of flank steak and they were very tender. I also grilled some peppers, vidalia onions and water chestnuts...yummy! Thanks for sharing!

I was too lazy to slice the meat and skewer it ahead of cooking, so I marinated the whole piece of flank steak for a few hours and then cooked it on our Big Green Egg (charcoal bbq).  VERY tasty.  I served it with wasabi mashed potatoes.  The next day, it was delicious cold.  I also heated up leftovers, sliced, in a saucepan with a new batch of marinade, to make bbq sandwiches.  My husband and sons (15, 13 & 3) all said, 'it's a keeper.'

Great recipe- followed it to a tee (with about 3-4 hours marinating time) with awesome results!  Wonderful flavor and the flank steak becomes so tender!  I might try this with another cut of meat just for change.  My hubby can't get his favorite beef skewers anymore at a certain Thai restaurant because they don't even compare to these.  Try it.. you'll like it!
