Wow, these were good!  I actually modified them a bit by adding about 1/4 c. of brown sugar, and rolling them in powdered sugar because of one reviewer stating they weren't sweeter.  I probably wouldn't have needed to add the extra sugar because they were very sweet and soft.  Yum!

I thought these were great.  Really easy to make, and nice and soft to eat.  They were definitely sweet enough for me without any added sugar.  I didn't have any peanuts to chop and add so I left those out with no adverse effects.

The cookies are not sweeter because there is no sugar in the recipe.  Good consistency but bland.

My Husband is a peanut butter cookie junkie so Ii was looking for something that would satisfy him.  The 14 oz of sweetened condensed milk is what caught my eye. I added a whole cup of crunchy peanut butter as per a review I read and two cups of flour, the batter was creamy and not easily turned into ballls of dough, but theyturned out perfect. i left them in the oven for about 13 mins because at ten they didnt even look brown, my husband just had three and had to lay down!! definitely a keeper!

I was disappointed with the cookies. Although they were soft and chewy they lacked the good flavor I expected. My kids didn't even like them and pronounced them- blah. My search for the perfect peanut butter cookie moves on.

These are tasty and easy.  I always wondered why most peanut butter cookies didn't have actual peanuts added.  I love the crunch that the chopped peanuts provide. I made the recipe as written except for deleting some of the baking powder because of Denver's altitude.

Good peanut butter cookies and EASY.  I dipped the fork in sugar before flattening the cookies.  Chewy and soft.  Those baked on a stoneware sheet had better color and crispier outside, tho still soft and chewy inside.

I liked these - they have a smooth taste and texture. I added 1 teaspoon of salt to the recipe and made half with 60% dark chocolate chips and the other half with quality milk chocolate chips. My daughter and her friend loved them. I was looking for a recipe that didn't require brown sugar because I ran out, yet was looking to bake on this gloomy day. This recipe hit the spot, thanks!

all they needed was some salt in the recipe- not bland at all with the salt and it sets off the sweet peanut butter taste real nice about 1/2 to 1 tsp as per preference.

Kid friendly because the ingredients are simple, and the cookies easy to prepare. Of course they ate them all too. Just not as 'peanutty' as regular peanut butter cookies.

I love these! They are light and chewy. And I especially love the fact that they have no sugar - they are sweet enough without being sickening.  Very good recipe.

Very easy recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I added   1/2 teaspoon salt and added milk chocolate chips instead of chopped peanuts. I'll need to bake them longer next time, 15 minutes. Other than that they all disappeared, still warm off the cooling rack. :)

Loved these cookies! Not too sweet but perfect with a glass of milk. I added chocolate chips to half the batter too.

It's also pretty delicious if you replace the chopped peanuts with chocolate chips

These were wonderful. I read the reviews about the cookies not being sweet enough and toyed with the thought of adding brown sugar. While tasting the dough before baking, I decided to add 1/4 cup of brown sugar. They came out wonderfully. They aren't too sweet and aren't to bland either. Gave it 4 stars just because I altered the recipes.

Good cookies. Used chunky peanut butter instead of peanuts. Worked out about the same. Thanks!
