I love this cake. My mom made it for us on Christmas (changed it to 1 C sour cream) and used a vanilla sauce that consisted of 1/2 C melter butter, 1 C sugar, 1 tsp Vanilla, and 1/2 C evaporated milk...It literally melted in our mouths. We weren't so sure about the tangy-ness to it but once the vanilla sauce was on it it was AWESOME. So you may want to try it with the vanilla sauce. She said it would be calliing our name later that night too, and IT DID! Great recipe.

This is a great holiday cake... I did substitute a few things...I omitted the cinnamon and used 1 tblsp of orange zest and I arranged orange slices in a spiral in the pan and arranged the cranberries around them... added 1/4 cup fresh crushed cranberries and 1/4 cup of orange juice to the cake batter and a full cup of sour cream... it was fabulous.

This cake was delicious and pretty easy to make - I am not a baker, savoury is more my speed, but I was asked to bring a nut safe dessert to a New Year's Eve dinner and fortunately this one caught my attention.  I made it pretty much according to the recipe, though combined suggestions from two other reviewers (Thank you Justina & Dianna):  I added the zest of 1 orange (naval orange, I think) into step 2 (with the butter, sugar, cinnamon & cranberries); the juice of 1/2 an orange (naval) to the batter; and arranged seedless mandarin orange slices (about 2 oranges worth) in the bottom of the cake pan before adding the cranberry mixture.  I also made the vanilla sauce that Justina described in her review (1/2C melted butter, 1C sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2C evaporated milk), but at the last minute zested another orange into it - it was divine!  It looked as delicious as it tasted!!  My only concern now is that people are going to expect that I can bake!!  Thank you AllRecipes & thank you reviewers - it was a huge hit ;)

Two things - really do cover the bottom of the Springform generously with foil, without holes, because the syrup will leak through, and burn in the oven (and set off all your smoke detectors).  I went by guess and by golly for a holiday party, though, and it turned out fine.  Great recipe!

I like the tartness of cranberries so I reduced the sugar by half, left out the cinnamon, added lemon zest & used lemon juice in place of the water. I also used only 3 tbsp of butter instead of the 1/2 cup it calls for & it was still quite buttery and sweet. So if anyone is calorie or sugar conscious, you can probably even reduce a bit further than half and come out with a tasty cranberry topping. I've used a similar recipe from williams sonoma in the past and I may return to it as I found the cake a bit lighter. Also, you don't need to fuss with a springform pan - I've used regular cake pans and aluminum pans and it turns out just as good.

Really amazing!! I baked gluten-free with 2 Tbsp tapioca flour, 1/2 C oat flour and the remaining with Brown rice flour.  It was a bit too sweet and I think I am going to cut down the sugar in both the sauce and in the cake next time. Boyfriend loved it and cannot wait for me to make it again.

Yum, yum!  I made this as directed, except for AP flour as I had no cake flour on hand.  It was delicious!  Pretty sweet though.  Maybe I will cut down on the sugar a bit next time.  I also like the reviewers who suggested the orange zest, orange juice and then garnishing with orange slices.  I will try that next time.  Oh BTW, my batter was too thick to 'pour'.  I had to spread it around on the cranberries as best I could, but still did not get it all the way to the edge of the pan.  Once it baked though, it had spread cleanly to the edges, no problem.

I used a parchment lined 9 x13 pan and it turned out great.

Being overly careful, I lined the bottom of my pan with three layers of foil.  I still had a terrible mess in the bottom of my oven.   I had to bake this for at least an hour and 20 minutes.  At 50 minutes, it would have been a runny mess.  I added the zest of one orange to the cranberry mixture.  Overall, the taste was good and it's pretty when garnished with an orange twist and greenery.  Will I make this again?  Probably.   But first I have to clean the oven and that's going to take a while.

I have made this recipe four times (and am making it again today).  I do not make it in a springform pan, just a regular (larger size) round pan and it pops out super easy.  Sometimes, if I don't cook the butter/sugar long enough, it doesn't assimilate quite enough into the cranberries, today I plan to try it with half brown sugar to see if this will work better. Overall, LOVE this recipe and so do all the recipients.  Thank you!

This is my second attempt at writing a review for this cake, I wrote an earlier one but sent it before I was done, so here it is. The first time I made this I used a springform pan and doubled the aluminum.  After baking in the oven for 50 minutes it made a runny, smoky mess, the cake was undercooked.  I tried it again last night but using a regular round cake pan like other reviewers suggested and OMG it turned out perfect, baked all the way thru and no mess.  It is very pretty and sweet.  I will definitely make it again.  Thank you for the recipe.  Now off to the store to buy and freeze more cranberries.

This is awesome!  I doubled the foil on the bottom of the pan, and put it on a pizza pan (just incase).  No mess in the oven, and everyone enjoyed it.  Thank you so much.  I usually buy a lot of whole cranberries in November/December, and freeze them.  It's nice to enjoy cranberry dishes when cranberries are not in season.

I would give this 5 stars with the following edits: like other reviewers I bumped the sour cream to 1 cup and added the zest of an orange to the sauce. I also put in a half tsp of vanilla extract and a half tsp of orange extract. It was a big hit for thanksgiving! And really gorgeous on the table!!!

I made this cake as written and it was a hit!  I think next time I'll try it next time with the oranges as mentioned in some of the reviews just to add more depth of flavor.  It definitely is a holiday flavor with the cranberries and cinnamon.

My whole family loved this wonderfully moist cake.  It was sweet and sour and oh so good.  I made it in a bundt cake pan with all-purpose flour and it turned out beautifully.

Workmates loved this.  Followed recipe exactly and it was great--oh wait I didn't have cake flour so I used the cornstarch sub method and it worked fine.  Take the foil wrapping instruction seriously--it took me an hour to clean my oven since my foil tore!

Excellent.  I read all reviews and changed accordingly. 
    Substituted  juice of one orange and orange zest in place  of water in step 2 ( with butter and cinnamon). 
    Also increased sour cream to 1 cup.  Cut sugar by 1/2 cup because I decided to use a glaze.  
      I cooked it in a 9X13 pan lined w/ parchment paper that went up all sides a little.  
     Then made a glaze--  juice of one orange and 1/3 - 1/2 cup granulated sugar   and   1 tsp vanilla mixed with spoon.     Poured glaze over cake when it came out of oven so it would seep into cake.
     Reduce cooking time if cook in a "flat" pan-  mine was ready in about 40-45 minutes.   Other cooks have said it take 1 hr and 15 minutes when cooked in a bundt pan. 
Cake comes out flawlessness when you turn it over if use parchment paper. 
   This is a keeper.

I used two 8" cake pans lined with parchment paper. Baking time was about 25 minutes. After the turned-out cakes were cool, I stacked them. So pretty! And the mess that some experienced was avoided. And I did increase the sour cream to 1 cup. In the cranberry mixture I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added the zest of one orange. Excellent!

This cake is delicious!  Like many other reviewers I reduced the sugar in both the topping and cake and it was plenty sweet.  I used 1 1/2 cups in the topping and reduced the granulated sugar in the cake to 1/3 cup.  I also increased the sour cream to 1 cup and omitted the cinnamon. It came out perfect, everyone loved it.

I have made this recipe twice and both times it came out very well. Everyone loved it.  I use a 4 inch deep 8 inch round pan and never had any problems with it over spilling into the oven. A regular 8 or 9 inch round pan that is only 2 inches deep is to small for this recipe.  The second time I did not have any sour cream so I used buttermilk the cake was still very good I also did not use the cinnamon I personally don't like it much so I left it out , other than that I made exactly as directed.  I did not feel this was too sweet the tartness of the cranberries calls for more sugar but you can always use less sugar in the syrup if you want a more tart flavor.

It was so yummy and pretty easy but I would caution those that are ADD in the kitchen, like me, to note that the sugar is divided.  Some for the cranberry compote and some for the  cake part.  I did not use a spring form pan and just scooped it out of the cake pan to serve.

Made it as written and would give it four stars.  It was a little too runny, but still good.  Second time, made a few changes.  Used all brown sugar in the cranberry mixture.  Like a lot of people, subbed orange juice for the water.  Finally, baked them in eight 7 oz ramekins for 28 minutes.  Did put all the cranberries in the ramekins, but left about 1/4 cup of the sauce out of the ramekins.  Came out amazing!

What a nice way to use cranberries!  If you have a deep 9" cake pan, you could use it instead of the springform, but a regular depth cake pan might be too small.  I followed the recipe except for increasing the sour cream to 1 cup, since I didn't want 1/4 cup leftover from the 8 oz container sitting in my refrigerator.

Made this cake for a Thanksgiving dinner.  I made it as written with the exception of baking it in a bundt pan instead of the springform pan.  It was a beautiful cake.  However, it was a little bland.  I saw that many other reviewers made changes to the recipe.  I can see how this could be a really great cake.  The suggestions of adding orange sounds good.  I think it would be great also if you added almond or almond flavor.  Also, I thought mine was a tad dry.  Not sure if that was my fault or if it could use a little more moisture.  I will try this again with some modification.

Awesome! Like other reviewers, I'd add the OJ to the batter...it's very thick and will make a great difference with texture & flavor. Also, the cranberries are tart but a wonderful pair to the coffee-cake type of cake below!

10.31.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/27021/cranberry-upside-down-sour-cream-cake/ ... I attempted to halve this & it isn't big enough to halve.  It didn't come close to being enough, cake especially - vs berries - for an 8x8.   Because of that, it's hard to distinguish cake from topping.  I subbed whole milk yogurt for the sour cream, & reduced sugar as so many others did.  No way is a cup of sugar going to dissolve in 4T butter.  I added a little oj, the berries & cooked till they released juice, added 1/4t almond extract.  'Added 1/2t orange extract to the cake, which was pretty dense.  'Made this on Halloween, which turned out to be quite appropriate as the cranberries - not enough to cover bottom - looked like bullet holes in the pink-colored cake.  :o  M'Sis called this Homicide Cake & I'm loving that name for it!  BF is so funny.  :)

Instead of cooking the cranberries, I used homemade cranberry sauce. This tasted wonderful! But baking for 50-60 minutes was not long enough. The middle was really undercooked and cranberries seeped out from the foil. Next time I’ll use other reviewers suggestions and use a bundt or round pan and bake longer.

I got free cranberries, and wanted to try something other than sauce. 

It was too much for me--labor intensive, too sweet and too tart. My husband, MIL and son really liked it, though. 

I don't think I'd make it again, but if you love cranberries and sugar, you'll love this!

Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Fantastic! Loved it! Perfect fall dessert. One tip--make sure that you tightly seal the springform with aluminum foil. I didn't and there was leaking.

Tried this for Christmas dessert.  Come out extremely soupy, all the topping ran off the top!  I mean ALL of it!   I’m thinking, after adding cranberries and coating, should you put them in pan by leaving behind most of the thickened liquid?  I might try this again, but will likely try my own version.  Any help from anyone?

Delicious cake. Made it in a bundt pan and turned out just fine, no mess. The cranberries were very tart though, so make sure you like that strong flavor, or consider adding something, like white chocolate sauce, to tone it down.  Family loved the cake.

This was more work than I wanted. I have another Cranberry Upside-Down Cake from this site we do like better & it is easier. I think you don't need all that sugar or the sour cream to make a good cake.

This was delicious!  I am going to try this again in a Bundt pan to see what it's like when I don't lose so much liquid through the leakage at the bottom of the spring form pan.  The pic shows syrup running down the sides while I think the cake was a bit on the dry side.  Perhaps I should've pressed the foil tighter.  Will see what works . . .

Tasted great. But.....upon removing from pan, it was obviously not cooked completely and ran all over. Scooped up and reput in pan and continued cooking for a further 30 minutes and then let cool in pan for 2 hrs, just in case! Needs tweaking.

I made this exactly as per the recipe and got rave reviews when I took it to the office - gone in one day! The tart cranberries offset the cake beautifully and the flavors melded so well. This was not difficult to make; I only had to think how to upend the cake onto a platter when it was only 10 minutes out of the oven, but figured it out and got it done. So pleased with this. Consider it a keeper to be made again and again. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This was great.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, except I used a bundt pan, so no spills.  I thought it would be too sweet, but it was perfect with the tartness of the cranberries.  My husband and three year old loved it, too! I will make this again!

Only 3 stars. Had to cook 15 more minutes and when I turned it out, most of the cranberries stuck to the bottom of the spring form pan. Now what?

We all loved this cake.  It was great the first day, but might be better from the refrigerator the next day.   Will make this again for sure!

I made this recipe for my husband who loved it! The sour cream gives the cake a nice flavor and it bakes up great! Would recommend for any family gathering. Very easy.

Really good and easy to make.  Lined a large pie pan with non stick foil leaving tall edges. It turned out easily and made no mess in the oven.  We made a snowflake stencil and dusted with non melting powdered sugar - very pretty!

I loved it and people went for a small piece but then went back for more. I used  a gf flour mix. I did not have any cinnamon so I used cardamom. It was wonderful. Very moist. The cranberries were caramelized but stayed tart. I will make it again.

OMG amazing.  I made the original recipe with only 1 change - 1 cup sour cream after reading the other reviews.  The cake is beautiful for Christmas and tastes incredible.

This cake was ok but I didn't do anything to modify it. I followed the recipe step by step. It looked absolutely beautiful but I don't think I will make it again. The cranberries were super sour but covered in too much sugar and the cinnamon was a little overbearing. The cake was also a little too dense for my liking.

Came out superb. Some things to consider:

1) Adding the orange zest makes a huge positive difference.

2) The topping tasted great, but quite sweet; consider reducing it a little if that quality doesn't appeal to you.

3) IMPORTANT. Make the cranberry topping, BUT DO NOT POUR IT IN. Let it cool a bit while making the batter. Then, pour it in your springform pan that's been super-well-wrapped. This will prevent spills.

4) Put the batter around the outside first, or the cranberries will be all at the edges.

5) Let it cook longer than they say. Mine took about 1hr15mins.

Everyone loved it.

Very good cake overall.  I, too, had to bake it quite a bit longer than directed.  The center was still slightly underdone, but the outer edges were a little dry.  I would definitely try it again.  It was very pretty and a great additional to a holiday table.

It just didn't work - we cooked it over an hour and still it came out a big sloppy undercooked mess!

It makes a terrible mess!  I wrapped new spring foam pan twice in foil and all the juice ran out.  Cleaning the floor and oven now.  Also had to bake much longer than directed.  Pretty and taste wonderful

Tried this recipe out on my family at Thanksgiving.  It was by far the most popular dessert!  They couldn't get enough of it and it was completely gone by the next day.  I'm baking another now.

This recipe turned out great! Everyone loved the cranberry topping best. I did add mandarin oranges to the pan first, zest to the cranberry mixture and a dash of juice to the batter. I covered the pan with 4 layers of overlapping foil and it still dripped out while cooking. Good thing I had put a baking sheet on the bottom rack to catch it! I also made the vanilla glaze recommended in another review, but next time I might use orange juice and confectioners sugar for a brighter firmer glaze. I didn't love how the cake batter came out either,  so I might just cheat and use a favorite boxed mix next time.
