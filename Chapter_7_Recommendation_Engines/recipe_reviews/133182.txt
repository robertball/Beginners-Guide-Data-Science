I added garlic salt in with the cheese etc for some extra flavor, but other than that there is nothing I would have changed on this. I did pin some loose ends with tooth picks and that helped, so the cheese didn't slip out at all. Definitely recommend.

I think this one has potential. Unfortunately, I had a problem because the prosciutto I bought claimed to be thin slices, but was really more like thin tatters--I had to made a kind of patchwork of it to wrap the chicken. This meant that I couldn't tuck the ends in, and all the cheese melted and ran out. The chicken was also overcooked at 40 minutes, so next time I will try 5-10 minutes less. Even so, the flavor was good, and I'll try it again with the right kind of prosciutto slices. I used dried sage instead of chives and no chipotle.

This was really quite bland. Most of the cheese ran out of the chicken whilst was cooking even though I secured it tightly. Needs some garlic & other flavourings rather than just chives.

Great recipe. The chicken was a bit dry/overcooked, though. I'd cook it a for either less time or turn down the heat some. I'm going to try 30 minutes next time and then add 5 minutes if it's undercooked. Excellent flavour, though!

Delicious! Love the brie inside! I didn't have chives, but it was still very tasty without them. I think I may have had smaller chicken breasts, but found that I did not need to bake it for the full 40 min. (I would just check the temperature vs. going by the cook time.)

I had to play w it a little bc when I went to get the prosciutto out of the fridge there were only three pieces left!  So I made it more of a casserole with the prosciutto on top. I also added totally squeezed out spinach on the chicken before the cheese. It worked and was really, really good!

Not a winner here! The recipe sounded great but it was very bland and not flavorful at all. I followed all directions but it was just a flop. Would not recommend.

I liked this, but for me it needed a little more oomph. I did use the chipotle but I guess not enough. Next time I will add some fresh rosemary - I tossed a few springs in with the leftovers.  My cheese stayed in the chicken just fine
