I don't normally review recipes that I make even if they're really good, but this one I had to.  I traded in oil for 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, the brown sugar for Splenda for Baking, and added a banana because the ones I had were pretty small.  Usually when I do this, my muffins come out hard and not as moist as the real recipes, but this one came out just AWESOME!  I also added 3/4 tsp salt, 1 tblsp cinnamon and a small dash of cloves for more flavour.  I will definitely be making this one of my staple recipes.  Never have I made a muffin that tasted so delicious (and I make some at least once a week) and had only healthy ingredients.  I'm so glad you decided to share your recipe!  Thank you!

I made a few minor changes to make it even more healthy. I used applesauce instead of oil, and used extra blueberries but omitted the nuts. I also used two VERY ripe banana's and egg beaters. I did not have any brown sugar so I used 3 Tbsp vanilla sugar instead. The result was wonderfully moist but could have used a bit more sugar. Next time I'll make sure I have brown sugar!

I just discovered recently that I love bran.  So as soon as I found this recipe, I knew that I had to be the first to try it.  I left out the walnuts (my husband hates them) and can't get buttermilk here so I used 2% instead.  I had no problem following the instructions except for the fact that the recipe doesn't state exactly when to add the egg, sugar, oil and vanilla mixture to the rest.  Anyway, the muffins turned out well and the only reason I'm giving the recipe four stars instead of five is because I think that the texture and taste of the bran would have been better if I had let it soak in the milk for ten minutes, as other bran muffin recipes recommend.  Also, I think I might add a little bit of salt next time.  One thing I really like about this recipe, though, is the banana flavour, which  really goes well with the bran.

I just pulled these out of the oven and have already eaten two of them.  They are sooo good.  I used applesauce instead of oil (drain the extra moisture first so it doesn't make your muffins too wet).  I also added a 1/2 tsp. salt and extra blueberries.  I only had wheat bran so I used that in place of the oat bran.  I don't eat a lot of sugar so I thought these were a little too sweet.  Next time I might just use 1/2 c.  Also, don't be afraid to really fill the muffin cups because these don't rise much.  I actually made 18 muffins but they were rather small because I didn't fill them very full.  Thanks for such a delicious and healthy recipe.

This is a "keeper"! Delicious AND healthy. It does make enough batter to REALLY fill 12 muffins cups, though - I actually got 15 muffins out of it because I was afraid of them overflowing.

Love these muffins! I reduced the canola oil to 1/4 c. and added another mashed banana as well as 1 tsp. cinammon. They were a hit even with the kids!

What an awesome HEALTHY muffin!  I didn't have any blueberries or buttermilk, and so I made sour milk and added an extra banana instead and they came out sweet and moist and my kids and husband loved them. This is the best high fibre muffin recipe I have ever tried.  Oh yeah, I also sprinked a few chocolate chips on the muffin tops before baking them. That made them a real bonus with the kids and hubby!

These were surprisingly good! When I saw the texture as they were coming out of the oven, I thought they were going to be bland and dry, but they were so moist and delicious! Even my picky husband liked them. I actually made 3 mini loaves instead of muffins and baked them for 25 min. I also substitued white flour for wheat and wheat germ for oat bran, becasue I didn't have either ingredients.

This can be made into an egg-free version as well by adding an extra Banana and doubling the baking powder.  They don't rise as much but it's great for those who don't eat eggs.  Also, I used1 1 1/4 C. Blueberries instead and used 4 Tbsp melted butter instead of the oil and added some Cinnamon.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because I made some changes to accomodate individual tastes, but it's a great recipe!

This was excellent. I don't usually rate recipes, but my last muffin experiences were so bad I just had to comment that this recipe works!! I also used 2 bananas, but then it was a bit too sweet. 20mins was perfect baking time and I used chocolate chips on top cuz didn't have bberries and used oats instead of oat bran cuz I didn't have it. Kids loved them.

Very good. I omitted the walnuts and increased the amount of blueberries to 1 cup. I also used 3/4 tsp of vanilla, because the taste goes well with these. It took me a bit of searching to find oat bran, but found it in the breakfast cereal aisle of our supermarket. Took them to work, and got great reviews.

These are great!  I do not even feel guilty eating these!  (215 calories per muffin)  There is a delicate balance of flavors here and each flavor compliments the other.  The banana and blueberries enhance the wheats and brans rather than overpowering the muffin...and vice versa with the wheats and brans complimenting the fruit.  This does not taste like cardboard...for those out there who may be skeptic of eating wheatey/braney foods.  It is not too bland...not too sweet. Since I found out last year that applesauce can substitue for oil in baking 1:1 ratio, then I never use oil in my muffins, that is the only thing i did different with this recipe.  (Side note:  substituting apple sauce for oil does not add an appley taste in case you are concerned about that. Also, you can substitue honey for sugar 1:1 ratio in baking...but i did not do that in this recipe, so as to stick as close as possible to the recipe that was posted and give an accurate rating.)  Enjoy!!  And thanks jayne04 for posting this!!!!!!!

Amazing! Easy to make as the most delicious gluten-free muffins I've ever had. I used rice bran instead of wheat bran and gluten free flour blend for 3/4 cup flour. Also, for good gluten-free baking add 1 tsp guar or xanthan gum. SO YUMMY!

Really fantastic (and full of fiber).  I could not find wheat bran so substituted wheat germ (didn't taste a difference).  I also replaced the oil with applesauce, walnuts with more blueberries, and sugar with splenda.  I baked some in a regular size muffin tin and the rest in a mini muffin tin.  The results were fantastic!  The muffins were moist and the chunks of banana made them just sweet enough.  I am definitely going to make these again and will try to add strawberries in the mix.

I was very pleasantly surprised by how good these were! I followed the recipe as much as possible, but had to make some changes. For those who this review may help: I didn't have wheat bran, so I used oat bran. Then, for the 1/2 c. oat bran, I used wheat germ. Used pecans instead of walnuts, and a full cup of frozen wild blueberries. So yummy!

I used the following because it's what I had:  I used 1 cup wheat germ instead of 1 1/2 c wheat bran, rolled oats instead of oat bran, 2 small bananas, white flour, and a whole pint of blueberries.  I skipped the walnuts, but they would have been good.  I sprinkled decorating sugar (large sugar granules)on top before I put them in the oven.  They were AMAZING!  I froze some of them, and they were still great.  I thawed them in the microwave, and then I put them in the toaster oven to make the tops crunchy again!  I will definitely make these again soon!

These were good, but not amazing.  I'm not sure I will make them again as there are other muffins I prefer.  The banana/blueberry combo is a little strange.

Hands down the absolute best bran muffin I have ever had. I never write in reviews, but just had to share. I used the recipe as directed, twice now, and next time will try substituting applesauce for the oil. I really enjoy the blueberries, as many bran muffin recipes call for raisins...which can be great, but gets ho-hum after a time.Kudos to jayne04, and many thanks. Enjoy, everyone!

These are DELICIOUS!  I was able to find both oat bran and wheat bran at my grocery (quite an amazing feat) and forgot to get buttermilk, so I just used regular skim milk.  These were enjoyed by all...even my 8 and 3 year olds!  Will absolutely make again!

Healthy and tasty! I use milk or plain yogurt for the buttermilk, since I never have buttermilk at hand.  I subbed the 1-1/2 wheat bran with 1/2 cup oat bran + 1 cup white whole wheat flour. Oatmeal works just fine if you don't have oat bran. The main difference is that oat bran has more insoluble fiber, which helps out your digestive system flush out toxic waste in your intestines.  The white whole wheat flour works fluffy wonders like the all-purpose. I used a huge banana for added flavor and moistness. Don't worry if the batter goes up the rim. The muffins do not rise much. These muffins are a great healthy sweet bite.

Amazing! Since discovered it has been our staple muffin at home.  I make it as per the recipe (although I sour my own 2% milk now and omit the nuts so my daughter can bring them to school) and between hubby, 6 year old, 15 month old and me I make minimum 24 muffins a week!  Thanks for the perfect delicious bran muffin!

Great Muffins, I didn't have oat bran so used rolled oats, and substituted the oil for applesauce.  I bought wheat bran cereal (generic) and ground it up to be used as my wheat bran substitute. My children even liked them!

This is pretty good.  I like the blueberries and bananas in this.  I thought these would be a little sweeter.  All and all a nice nutritious snack.  I will pack one in my lunches this week.

I made these with an extra banana and no blueberries.  They are SO YUMMY! These are by far the softest, melt-in-your mouth muffins I've ever had. 

They tasted like "normal" muffins the next day, but when you eat them just out of the oven they are honestly the best I've ever had!

My family loves these muffins!  I make the following modifications:  I use oatmeal in place of oat bran, Bran Buds cereal in place of wheat bran, and white flour in place of whole wheat.  They have a wonderful texture and are perfect for breakfast.

These are amazing! The best muffins I have every had and they are filling. I substituted applesauce for the oil and put in a few extra frozen blueberries. Next time I will try them with a little less sugar to make them healthier.

I love this recipei and make it all the time with leftover buttermilk. I make the recipe with All Bran cereal for the wheat bran and also add chocolate chips. I have 6 children and they all love it. Great way to get extra fiber!!

These muffins were really good.  I used oatmeal instead of oat bran, and used half frozen blueberries, half frozen cherries (it's what I had).  They really are good.  I was suprised at how much batter the recipe made, but even though it fills 12 muffin cups to the top, these don't rise much so they are perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These muffins were great! I did change the milk to soy milk. Couldn't tell the difference. The grandkids gave the a five also. I'll definitely make them again.

Since trying this recipe a few months ago, it has become my go to for bran muffins. I was bent on finding a recipe that included a healthy dose of as many wheat/bran ingredients (not just a hint of  one or the other) and this one fit the bill. I make these with only slight changes, and due to family preferences (at the moment), omit the walnuts and blueberries. I add a touch more buttermilk, enough to really moisten the bran, sometimes add an additional banana, and reduce the sugar. I make a double batch every time, as opposed to 1 1/3 cups b. sugar I add 1 cup. I also took another suggestion and added salt. So I now include scant 1 tsp sea salt to the double batch. As Fall approaches, I will be making these and keeping them in fridge for those hurried rushes out the door to school. My children, 5 & 12, both really enjoy them, as do I.

I had to substitute some things as I did not have all the ingredients. Ground up All Bran in a coffee grinder to make the 1 1/2 cups wheat bran. Ground up oatmeal to make the oat bran. Used 2/3 cup milk with 1/3 cup sour cream and 1tbsp. vinegar in place of buttermilk.  Also used 2 bananas. They turned out GREAT! Moist and delicious and healthy! Love it!

I made this today, keeping as best I could to the original recipe.

I used softened butter in place of the
canola oil and whipped it with the brown sugar, then added the egg and banana. I alternated between the dry ingredients and the buttermilk/vanilla, adding a little of one then the other until they were gone. This made for a fluffy batter
and light muffins.

I used blackberries in place of the blueberries, as my Dad and eldest son surprized me with ten pounds they'd picked that morning. 

These turned out great. I'd make these again for sure. These will be great tomorrow for the boys and will pack well for my husband's lunch.

Very good!  I did not have wheat bran so subbed oat bran for that, and used ground flax for the oat bran.  Used two medium bananas and a few extra blueberries, and since the batter looked a bit too dry to me I added another splash of buttermilk.  Came out very moist and delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

While I am not a bran or whole wheat muffin fan, this came out pretty good.  I used applesauce instead of oil, added a banana, put one and a half cups of blueberries, put a touch of cinnamon and cloves for a bit more flavour, and since I didnt have oat bran, put rolled oats instead. 

This was a hit with my 2 year old and would definatly make it again!

I loved this recipe!  I love cranberry and orange so the second time I made this recipe I substituted 1 cup orange juice for the buttermilk and then added 1 TBL of orange zest.  Instead of the bananas I added 1/3 cup half and half.  Of course cranberries replaced the blueberries.  They were fantastic!  Even my children loved both recipes!

I had some buttermilk to use up so I tried this recipe.  I halved it & used 1 egg & 1 banana (no oil).  It made 6 jumbo muffins.  They cooked up beautifully. But I am disappointed because they are so dry.  I would not make these again because of the driness.

i love love love this recipe! I made a few changes, but only because I didn't have the reauired ingredients in the kitchen. I used whole plain yogurt instead of milk and chia seeds instead of walnuts.. also... i didn't have whole wheat flour, so I used all purpose non-bleached/non-enriched with whole old-fashioned oats... I know! i was so excited to make this.. i just used what I have & it was awesome!! ???

I made this just as written except for adding some cinnamon. This is an awesome recipe. I am trying to get more fiber in my diet and this is a delicious way to do so. I know a lot of people substituted the oil for applesauce but I really don't think that's necessary given how little oil it is. This recipe made 18 muffins for my husband and I. I think I'll see how they freeze individually so we can take one for breakfast everyday. Thank you for a great recipe!

These were really good. I made a couple of changes: I added 2 bananas, because that's what I had. I didn't have oat bran so I gave some rolled oats a few pulses in the food processor and that worked well.  I didn't have enough blueberries so I used about 1/2 cup blueberries and 1/2 cup fresh cranberries. I also added a scant 1/2 tsp salt. 

My husband took a couple to go this morning (no stopping for drive-thru muffins) and sent me an email saying they were so good, he shared one with a co-worker. I will be making these again.

I really love this recipe. The muffins are not too sweet which I like. Once they were completely cooled I wrapped each one separately and froze them in a ziploc freezer bag. This way I can grab one to go in the morning on my way out the door. This is an easy recipe that I'll make again and again.

I love these muffins!  They taste healthy and "substantial". Two of these with a little peanut butter makes a delicious, healthy, satisfying breakfast. 

Like many, I substituted apple sauce for the oil. Turned out great!

Fantastic!  Have made several times, always easy and awesome. Kids love them. Added about 1 T cinnamon and subbed applesauce for oil (a little more than called for), use wheat germ/flaxseed for oat bran (didnt have it). Perfectly done at 17 min on 385 convection. Made 12 good sized muffins, very moist. Filled the cups completely full as they dont rise much. Good hot or cold. Next time might try with additional banana as the flavor is very mild.

I made the following changes based on what I had: 2 bananas, used almond milk soured with a bit of vinegar, increased the baking powder by another 1/2 teaspoon, used applesauce for oil and oats for oat bran. I also used cranberries instead of blueberries and added some cinnamon and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. I wanted a little more texture with the oats and tried to make them a little more healthier. The result was still a moist muffin with good flavour. Next time I will try honey instead of brown sugar.

I made these with blueberries the first time and again with raisins, and they were wonderful ... both ways!  Don't be worried if the batter seems a bit on the dry side.  I was surprised by how moist they turned out.

My Dad seldom says too much about anyone's baking but these got a "yummy, are there more?"

Really good. I was short on ingredients, so I substituted applesauce for the banana, and white sugar for brown. Still excellent. I would probably decrease sugar to 1/2 cup next time.

Delicious and healthful! I didn't have buttermilk, wheat bran or oat bran, so I made the following changes: I added a tablespoon of vinegar to skim milk to make 1 cup, I included 3/4 cup of white flour, in place of wheat bran I used 1/2 cup wheat germ, in place of oat bran I processed raw oatmeal in the food processor to make 1/2 cup. I also added 1/2 tsp. salt and increased the blueberries to 1cup. These muffins rose well and turned out light and flavorful, not heavy and small like most "healthy" muffins.

I've made these perhaps a dozen times now, doubling the batch on occasion.My husband is diabetic so I replace the 2/3 cups brown sugar with 1/3 cup splenda. I also (sometimes) replace a bit of the oil with applesauce when I have some on hand. These are delicious, healthy and stay moist for days afterwards. Make them the day before if you're serving them to company. They're even better the next day and are much easier to remove from the paper if you used muffin sleeves.

I would describe these muffins as banana bread plus blueberries.  DELICIOUS.  I was confused about exactly what "oat bran" is, so I just used wheat bran twice.  That turned out too soupy so I added more wheat flour.  They turned out awesome.  Next time I will use flax seed instead of oat bran like someone else mentioned.  My husband and I ate all 12 muffins in 3 days.  hehe

These muffins tasted good, but, like another reviewer said, they are too crumbly.  It was difficult to get them out of the pan, and when I did, they fell apart.

Great muffins...moist, light and full of flavour!  I doubled this recipe and used a mixture of fresh blueberries and raspberries (b/c my boys and I just recently picked, so we have many)!  I ended up using almost 2 cups of fruit, but left out the nuts as we don't much care for them.  The banana flavour is subtle, allowing the fruit and bran to shine through!  My gas oven tends to cook quickly, so I only needed about 16mins at 375.  Will definitely make these muffins again!

Although I had to make numerous substitutions, these muffins were fantastic! My husband took them to work and they were gone in under 5 minutes! I didn't have wheat bran so I used some Raisin Bran cereal; no buttermilk so used skim milk mixed with a tablespoon of lemon juice; and no oat bran so I just added a bit more flour and Raisin Bran until I got a good consistency. I will absolutely make these again! The combination of blueberry and banana was fantastic!

These were pretty good and reasonably easy.  I will make these again!
After you make them, just make sure that you put them in the fridge for storage...berries will start to get funky after a day or two on the counter.

Easy muffins to make, kids loved them and they are obviously very moist.  Husband however, unkown to me, hates Bran.  "Taste like flavored cardboard" was his rate on the muffin.  However, my kids are scarfing them down, so I'm assuming that they're good.
