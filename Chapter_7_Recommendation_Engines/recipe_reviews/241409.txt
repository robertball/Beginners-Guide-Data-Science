Used  dried Cranberries instead of cherries.  I found that the longer the salad sat, the better the Brussels sprouts absorbed the dressing and softened or suggest warming the Brussels sprouts so they soften and the dressing is absorbed better

Love this warmed so the  Brussels sprouts soften and the dressing absorbed better. Skipped the honey as my family doesn't like. Didn't miss it. Thanks!

I tried the honey-mustard-Parmesan vinaigrette but since I hate mustard it really didn't taste good to me. I started over with a splash of honey mixed with store-bought balsamic. I also added fresh raspberries and golden raisins. All my picky kids loved this coleslaw and even my husband who is leery of being experimented upon.

This is one of our favorite salads and very popular at potluck dinners. I add more garlic and use craisins instead.

Pretty good for a "healthy" salad.  Substituted Craisins for the dried cherries which was my only change.  I took a bag of Trader Joe's brussels sprouts and pulsed them in my Cuisinart.  It made for a quick and easy chop and an inexpensive and easy to make salad.  I'd make it again though it wasn't my total favorite.

I made this and added some additions from another recipe from a different site to create more flavor dimensions.  I used some white wine and also cider vinegars, added some lemon zest and lemon juice, some dijon mustard, salt and pepper, used dried cranberries and dried bluberries, and toasted pecans instead of almonds.   2 T. of honey instead of 1 and used only 2 T. olive oil, not 1/4 cup.  A lot of changes, I know, but I wanted it to be good.   It was good and I plan to make it again.

I sliced a few and sauteed them in the pan. I let it soak for 4 hours, then added the almonds. Awesome recipe! Even my little guy and my dad who claim to not like brussle sprouts were shocked they enjoyed it!

This was delicious, even the fussy teens ate it. Who knew raw brussel sprouts were better than cooked ones? YUM

Very good!  I substituted craisins because I had them on hand and let each of my family use the bottled dressing of their choice (I have so many bottles of dressing, so no need to make a separate dressing for this salad).  Even my kids who don't like brussel sprouts liked this!

I made this receipe and feel in love with it.  It is easy to make and I have passed this receipe to my friends.  Has a great taste with all of the ingredients that it uses. I will be making this a lot.

We just didn't care for the flavors in this.  I'm not a Brussels sprout fan but love cabbage so am still in search of a recipe I will like.  Husband does like the sprouts but also didn't care for this slaw.  Won't do this one again.

Scaled it down to three servings.  Loved this, but had to double dressing because it was too dry otherwise.  Nice nutty flavor and quick to make (used food processor on the brussel sprouts).  Liked this!

I found it one dimensional. I don't like sweet with savory so I added 1t of honey and found it ruined the dressing. To fix it I added another 1/4 cup of oil, 1T of white vinegar, 2T of lemon juice and  1T of cider vinegar (as others suggested) and three more cloves of garlic. I think the cider vinegar helped a lot. I also added some salt and cayenne pepper. I didn't measure the parmesan and probably added too much because it added a nasty texture to the slaw. I think adding shaved parmesan as someone suggested would be better.  I also eliminated the cherries/cranberries because I didn't have any and didn't want the sweet element anyhow.

This turned out very good. It was much better the next day when I used it as a filling with thin-sliced deli ham lunch roll-ups.

Fantastic! Made this for Father's Day and it was a huge hit! Made it as written and it was great. I did use shaved Parm instead of grated...would highly suggest.

Doubled the honey as recommended by others and used white balsamic vinegar instead of cider and used avocado oil instead of olive oil.  I toasted the sliced almonds.  Used organic naturSource Salad topper which contains pumpkin and Sunflower seeds and cranberries (available at Costco)

Never told my family until after dinner that it was Brussels sprouts because they would have never tasted it. They LOVED it!  I didn’t change a thing and it was a huge hit. Thank for a delicious easy recipe that will be used often.

I enjoy the Brussels sprout salad.  But I reduced the oil and left out the cheese. (I don't eat dairy.) I didn't have dried cherries so used dried cranberries instead.  Wonderful!

Made this exactly as written. Thought it sounded really good. Didn't care for it right after making. Figured the flavors need to blend and it needs to chill. Tried it again the next day. Just sort of reminded me of eating grass. Brought some to a friend, thinking maybe it was just me. Nope. She tossed hers too. Didn't like it. Sounded good and very healthy but I'm not saving this recipe. Fun to try something new but not this one.

I used cranberries instead cherries.  Otherwise   I followed the recipe. I wanted a  recipe for  balsamic vinegar. I was happy to see the suggestion to use nutritional yeast. I did that.

I substituted the honey and white vinegar with agave nectar and apple cider vinegar. Also, used cranberries and chopped walnuts for toppings. Addicting! Thanks for the recipe.
