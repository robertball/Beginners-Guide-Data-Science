Yummy!  I really enjoyed this recipe.  I do suggest adding lots more spinach (add at least one or 2 boxes).  I think it would be wonderful with a white sauce like alfredo, to make it a little more creamy.  Maybe some mushrooms too.

Very good.  I used no-boil pasta which made it so quick to put together, and it came out great.  Also, instead of straight provolone, I subbed a three cheese Italian blend of provolone, parmesean, and mozzerella.

This is sooooo good!  I used fat free ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. I also used low fat cream cheese. It turned out excellent, I will DEFINITELY make it again!

My husband and I loved this! I would have given it 5 stars, but I think I overdid the bacon and not enough spinach. Next time I will add much more spinach and less bacon. I did cover it with foil to retain moisture.

This recipe produced quite a dense product.  It tasted good, but was better (in my opinion) with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle of salt.

Awesome!  Substitued provolone for mozzarella and added a couple more slices of bacon.  My Husband doesn't care for spinach, but he LOVED this recipe.  He said it was the best lasagna I had ever made.

This is very good. I can't have tomatoes and have missed lasagna. 
I made some changes:
*I used 16 oz of lasagna noodles and made several layers instead of just 2. Ended the top layer with the cheese mix and topped with sliced provolone.
*Used egg sub
*9 slices of turkey bacon
*Garlic salt instead of powder
*to taste ground peppercorn, ground cayanne pepper, dried dill, dried cilantro
Next time might add in Ricotta and sauteed onions

The secret to this recipe is to cook it covered with foil to retain moisture. I fiddled with the quanities a bit and used fresh spinach. More cheese, some sour cream. We enjoyed this.

Great recipe. Not only did my kids eat it, but my husband did as well. And even
asked for seconds. Doesn't have very much of a spinach taste though, I think
next time we will try more spinach. I prepared it the night before except the 
cooking so I only had to bake it when dinner time rolled around. We used
precooked noodles and skipped cooking the noodles. A Quick, easy great tasting
your kids will eat it recipe:)

This is by far the best recipe I have ever got.  I make this constantly for any party, work fucntion, etc. and it's always the same overwhelming response and praise.  I can eat a whole one myself!  You cannot go wrong with this meal and you'll raise a lot of eyebrows since it's not your typical lasagna.  Enjoy and Kudos to the originator!

Very good, although extra rich - and I even took previous suggestions of using low-fat everything, and chicken bacon.

To agree with others - it needs MUCH more spinach, maybe twice as much! Next time I'd add a bag of fresh spinach to chop & add to the cooked stuff.

Add a little sour cream in the cheese mixture; more egg and shredded cheese too (I used an Edam-Mozzarella mix). Top with a sprinkling of cheese and broil to get a nice top.

And it freezes well - I made the recipe for 12, refrigerated it, sliced it up & plastic-wrapped individual portions to be defrosted & cooked in the microwave or oven, at home or at work some other night!

This was a great recipe.  I personally used 1 pack of 8 fat free cream cheese, mix blend of provolone with some other cheeses, 1 cup of more of cottage cheese, turkey bacon, more than a dash of garlic powder, fresh spinach, ground turkey, and garlic flav. alfredo sauce. It came out excellent.  The best lasagna I ever made. Great for anyone. Also I served with bread sticks with infused olive oil, spinach salad, and homemade strawberry ice cream.

This was great, but I used fresh spinach instead.  I really love pasta without a tomato sauce base, so any time I can find one this tasty it is going to the recipe box.

Fantastic! This was my first ever attempt at making lasagna and it was super easy and very delicious! I'm not one to follow exact recipes and changed it up a bit by using bacon bits, a whole container of cottage cheese and added mozzarella and cheddar in addition to the original ingredients. I mixed it all together with 2 12oz. bags of cooked spinach. Next I did my build different by doing a layer of noodles followed by a layer of the mixture and repeated until the last layer, then I just topped that with swiss and fresh parmesan.  Everyone loved it, even the 6yr old!

This recipe had good taste but was dry.  I would make it again and add some ricotta to give in some moisture.
Or... I think if you added some milk or half and half to the cream chesse it would help too.  Don't make it ahead and put it in the oven to heat.  That is too long for it to be in the oven.

This wasn't a terrible recipe, but my fiance and I didn't care too much for it, and will not make it again.  I think it was too bacon-y for my taste and he said we should stick to tomato-based lasagnas.

Husband loved it. I had to substitute mozzarella for provolone, whipped cream cheese for half of the called-for amount, precooked bacon, and a 16-oz bag of x-wide egg noodles.  It turned out very moist, full of flavor, and delicious.  I have been looking for a recipe just like this and I highly suggest the substitution of cheeses.

Great recipe, I tried it with fat free cream cheese and it made it taste a little too fake.  I would recommend using the real deal for this recipe to get the full effect.

I tried this recipe for the first time.  I  discovered I only had one 8 oz cream cheese, I substituted the remainder of 16 oz. cottage cheese.  It was very delicious.

This is awesome!  I made this using fat free cream cheese and low fat provalone, making it lower in fat.  It was fast and delicious.  I also think it'd make a great entree for a brunch!

This recipe worked great with the salty bacon and the flavor of spinach.  I also added pepperoni and extra cheese on top.  Overall easy and great tasting.

Used an Italian cheese mix instead. Bacon was a nice touch, but the cream cheese over powered everything. I will add a red sauce to it next time.

Tasted pretty good-bacon and spinach are a good combination together. However, this lasagna turned out a little more dry than I would have liked it. If you can find way to remedy this good dish you can make it great!

This was very tastey. I added mushrooms, used Bacos instead of real bacon, added more garlic salt, and added  2 Tbsp's of minced garlic. I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe with an awesome flavor! The prep time did take longer than 25 minutes and I thought 30 mins at 350 wasn't enough time so I went for an additional 15 mins.  Also used only one package of spinach. Still tasted GREAT!!!!!!

I am not sure if using fat free cheeses would make a difference in this recipe, but I give this recipe a 1.  My boyfriend didn't think it was that bad, but I took one bite and couldn't swallow anymore.

GREAT, we will make again.  I want to use more spinach & add some type of mushroom.  Somewhere I'm going to also take other suggestion & try crabmeat.  Making a lasagna without meat took awhile to really accept it; we must keep an open mind & try new things.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  I'm usually open to new ideas, but he is a meat and potatoes kind of guy.  It was easy and very delicious.  My husband thought we should try adding imitation crab next time.

Not good. Was much too bland. The cheese was too thick. Something was missing in the recipe--not the meat, mind you. It was just .....blah, ho-hum, nothing to write home about. Don't waste your ingredients on this one.

The topping was a little too rich & heavy.  Definatly use less for topping & add more spinach!

Just made it. I didn't put bacon in it but I pan fried the spinach in butter, oil and garlic. I added more cottage cheese ,mozzarella cheese and sliced provolone. Very good

This was a really good alternative to the "classic" meat lasagna, and I LOVED the cheeses used in this recipie!!!  I'd like to try the meat lasangna using this cheese mixture!! YUMMY!  I'm not much of a vegie eater, but thought i'd try spinich and thought the flavor deffinatly wasn't overwhelming even for a NON vegie eater like myself!  The bacon was a great adding, i went ahead and used the whole package instead of just the 6 slices and it was supperb!
