This was really tasty! I've been on the road for the past 5 days, so it was nice to get back in the kitchen and cook up some Italian comfort food. The polenta was really creamy, just like the recipe states. My husband said it's a "do again". Saving to my favorites. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with some adjustments to reduce the sodium and fat content. I used water instead of broth, left out all added salt, milk instead of half and half, reduced the butter considerably, cut back on the garlic (personal preference) and used fresh tomatoes instead of sauce. We enjoyed this in its lighter version.

This was absolutely delectable! I have to admit this, and other variations of it, are among my favorite things to eat.  There's just something about the tomatoey rich sauce and sausage with the creamy polenta that just sings to me.  It probably isn't the best thing in the world for you but I can think of worse things and this splurge is totally worth it!

For a rather simple dish, this turned out amazing.
I’ll definitely make it again for company.  
I only used 1 large sweet onion. 
I went to my local Italian meat shop and purchased sweet Italian Sausages made with chicken rather than pork. Using a fair amount of olive oil, I would be more careful to drain after frying the sausage, the potatoes , the peppers and onions. That would result in a less oily dish.
Baking it in the oven after frying separate batches really added to the taste and to blend the flavours together.

Awesome! We used precooked polenta (minus the extra cream and butter) and It was still delicious.  I don’t think you can go wrong with this one.

I used a homemade chicken sausage with sun dried tomatoes, doubled the peppers and omitted the marinara. Delicious and quick!

This is an amazing dish! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I changed was to add more garlic, and to cut way back on the butter. I substituted milk for half of the half and half. The polenta is so creamy that it doesn’t need that much fat. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! I'll definitely make this again. I used five sweet Italian sausage links (hubby doesn't care for hot), dried basil instead of fresh (it's what I had on hand), and cheap sauvignon blanc. I left the salt out of the polenta, IMO there's already plenty in the chicken stock. The polenta was sooo good but I may cut back on the butter next time, I think it would still be great with a bit less.

Loved the polenta, didn't use any butter. Sausage and pepper medley was delicious. Omitted the marinara part because the polenta was so creamy and delicious on its own. Would make again totally.

Delish! Whole family enjoyed it. I tasted the polenta after cooking, and it was already creamy and yummy, so I did not add the cheese or butter to it. We did not miss it! (We did top w shredded Parmesan at the table.)

I followed another reviewer's low-fat suggestion and used water and milk instead of chicken stock and half-and-half. Perhaps if I had used the original ingredients, this would have turned out better. This tasted like tasteless batter. It was just terrible. The sausage-pepper sauce was good, giving this recipe two stars instead of one. It would taste better on rice.
