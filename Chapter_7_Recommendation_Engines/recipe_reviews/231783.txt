This is absolutely fantastic.  First time ever tasting hummus.  Unbelievably good.  However, I had to make a few changes for lack of ingredients. I had to substitute the cumin and parsley.  Instead, I used savory and chili powder.  Also, I had to make my own tahini with the following recipe:
1 1/3 cup sesame seeds
1/8 - 1/4 cup oil
I baked the sesame seeds on a shallow pan at 350'F, shaking the tray every minute or so for about 8-10 minutes.  Let the seeds cool, and pureed them with the oil.

As a twist, I put the hummus on a tortilla wrap with chopped carrots.  Delicious every way you serve it.

Delicious! I used a can of garbanzo beans, that I drained. I did need to add a bit more water and lemon juice to get it to the consistancy that I wanted it, but that was no big deal. I topped mine w/ olive oil, parsley, toasted pine nuts and paprika. Great flavor...I will def be using this recipe again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

We've made this several times, usually with homemade bagels but not always. The flavor is terrific and the texture is smooth and creamy, even though I often add additional garlic. I have always used one whole can of garbanzo beans, drained, and it comes out great.

So, so good!  Made according to the recipe and I love the fresh lemon juice.  I'm going to make it for my mom as well, she will love it.   I will add some paprika and/or hot sauce just before serving too.
