I LOVE this recipe...I've made this the last 3 Thanksgivings (and also to impress a cute boy...totally worked) and it has gotten rave reviews. I'm not a huge pie person, but I LOVED this. It is so rich and delicious. I changed a few things - I omitted the nuts and 1/4 c. butter and used a large-sized graham cracker crust (because I hate pastry crust.) 

TIP: Many people complain that the chips sink to the bottom. With about 20 minutes left to cook, I just dropped about 20-30 additional chocolate chips on top of the pie. These didn't sink and made it look like a giant chocolate-chip cookie. Way cute...

Since I don't like chocolate much, I can only base this on my husband's reaction.  He LOVED it!  He claims it is one of the best pies he has ever eaten!!  I was very skeptical as it was cooking, because it took about fifteen minutes longer than the recipe called for, and it looked strange when it came out of the oven (very shiny and smooth, and an odd tan color--not what I was expecting).  It actually created a layer pie--the chocolate sunk to the bottom, and created a chewy layer over the top.  Based on my husband's reaction, I think I'll have to make this pie again and again!!

My niece was raving about a Tollhouse Chocolate chip pie she had when on vacation this year. We decided to look for a recipe and try.. after reading the many reviews we settled on this one. Jasmine Decided this was this was the best she's tasted. We had the caramel sauce on the warm pie with vanilla Ice cream!

This pie got raves at our local Pie Auction.... I had many phone calls for the recipe!  It did overflow a bit in the oven, next time I'll put a cookie sheet under it!

Wow! The word of the night on Thanksgiving was "sinful" (honestly - about 4 people used that same word!)I bought crusts that came in a 2-pack to make Pumpkin Pie, thus had 1 crust left over. Pulled up good 'ol Allrecipes to see if there was something I could make with what I already had on hand and voila! This was the hit of the night and embarassingly EASY! I will use a deep dish pie shell next time (the contents oozed over onto the roasting pan in the oven) and I used mostly milk chocolate chips, with some semi-sweet; used pecans instead of walnuts based on what was on hand - my favorite pie now! Thanks for the submission!

If you've ever had chocolate chip cookie pie, you would know that this is SUPPOSED to be a gooey pie!  It is not supposed to be like a giant/thick cookie in a pie shell...it's gooey rich sweet decadence in a pie shell!  That being said, I omit the nuts, usually cut down a bit on the butter and add a teeny bit of salt. Perfection.

Great recipe! I used pecans since I didnt have walnuts and only used 1/2 a cup. A whole cup would have been too much, for my tastes anyway. I could not get enough of this.

Very good! I believe some of the reviewers here are mistaken when they say that when you take it out it's not done. The thing is, although it's gooey, it's definitely done. The filling of pie's are usually gooey. But it definitely tasted better after refrigerating it. The gooey filling is hardened and it tastes like a delicious brownie-like dessert.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Everyone went nuts over this pie. I did not use nuts, because I dont like them. And yes the chocolate chips did sink to the bottom, but it still tasted great. Can't wait to make it again.

It's good and easy to make; I went by suggestions of others and used a graham cracker crust and deeper pie dish.  It has too much butter.  It was bubbling up at the sides; I poured some of it out by tilting the dish.  If taking to parties, it's easier to just make chocolate chip cookies.

Just like a big chocolate chip cookie with a smoother texture. Very rich and very good. It was best warm with vanilla ice cream. All of my chocolate chips sank to the bottom of the pie. I'm not sure if there is any way to avoid that though. Still tasted great.

Pretty tasty! For those who like sugar pie, this is a nice twist. I made the recipe exactly, except omitting the nuts, and used "Grandma's Secret Pie Crust". Dead easy to make, and everyone enjoyed it. I only took away a star because it didn't totally blow me away (though it's a solid recipe and I'll make it again).

This is the same recipe as "toll house" pie just 1/3 less butter. It is such a great tasting pie! We used to make it at a restaurant I worked at. I always thought the toll house pie was slightly greasy, and thought the butter could be cut back, so this would be perfect. For that pie though I do use a deep dish pie shell, but a regular shell might work here as it has a little less butter.

Very simple and delicious! The chocolate does sink but the top layer come out crispy while the inside was a very chocolatey and pie-like, making it very tastey (I didn't have to cook it any longer than 55 minutes). I only added about 3 1/2 TBS. of butter and suggest to stick with the semi-sweet choc. chips so the pie isn't overwhelmingly sweet. Very good recipe and SO EASY! (Also, I used homemade pie crust without sugar, just flour shortening and water, which served as a great balance for the sweet inside and made it more cookie like)

I needed something to whip up in a hurry, and this was definitely easy. It was a little too intense for my taste (very sweet and chocolate was pretty gooey), but I enjoyed it a bit more the next morning after it sat in the fridge and hardened.

Really good.  It is a lot like chocolate chip cookies, as other reviews say, but as far as I'm concerned, you can't go wrong with that.

This is a good recipe but next time I think I will make mine in a bigger dish to make it a little thinner, my top got done way before the middle was cooked. It still tasted great once it was finished though!

This pie was better than that served at a local upscale cafe.  I did cut the butter in half like other reviewers suggested.  I also added a half cup of coconut flakes.  It was delectable and I will certainly be making it again soon.
Thanks for such an awesome recipe.

I scaled this recipe down and used an individual pie crust.  I also added caramel bits.

I saw a chocolate chip pie at a restaurant recently that looked so good that I knew I'd have to fine the recipe. This pie was a cinch to put together and Oh so good!

Sorry, but we did not enjoy this.  Just can't put my finger on what was wrong, but it didn't seem like a good combination of ingredients. I really wanted to like it!

I changed the crust to graham cracker and only added 2/3 cup of chocolate chips. Big hit with everyone.

This reminds me of a fudge pie which is also on this site.  It pretty much tasted like a brownie in a pie crust and this is just like a chocolate chip cookie in a pie crust.  I don't really get the point unless you get a kick out of eating things in pie form.  Good but nothing really to it.

Just made this for Christmas.  Most people reviewing this recipe said it was "sinful", everyone at my table said it was "ridiculous."
It is wonderful in small amounts.  This is not an everyday dessert because it is soooo rich but it is very, very good.  It was gone before the pumpkin and pecan pie. Thanks for the recipe.

I used a store bought graham cracker crust and it tasted great.  I used the larger size crust since I read that the filling overflowed in the oven - it worked out perfect.

I searched a lot of different sources on the web for a Chocolate Chip Pie recipe, but I still came back to this one.  I'M GLAD I DID!  It was so easy to fix, and just what I was hoping to find in a wonderfully tasty pie!  I fixed this pie for the Choco-holics in the family...we all loved it!  I'll be making this again, and I'm emailing the recipe to family members who raved about it, too!

I love this pie!  It is so easy to put together (especially if you cheat and use a store bought crust) and it tastes great.  I made it once with the nuts but after the first time I leave them out (we don't like nuts) and don't miss them a bit!  My favorite is to serve this warm and have some good vanilla ice cream on hand but it tastes great cooled too.

SOOO good and SOOO easy! Smaller than average slices are enough but who would really want to stop there?  Once again, I didn't have all the ingredients I thought I did and made the following substitutions: maple extract for the vanilla and 1/4 c. butterscotch chips for 1/4 c. of the chocolate. Can't wait to try it with the original ingredients and ice cream!

As stated by some others, this is also called 'Derby Pie' and made for the Kentucky Derby.  I grew up eating this each May, except I was never a fan of the walnuts.  Because of this, I made a substitution for my non-nut liking family.  I added Chocolate Chunk pieces instead. YUM!  I did not have any trouble with the pie being underdone.  Yes, the butter is bubbling under the crust when I took it out after an hour, and I luckily took the advice of others by placing foil on the rack below the pie to collect any spills.  I placed the pie on a cookie sheet after taking it from the oven and allowed it to cool for 2 hours.  The pie was gooey, but not falling to pieces or raw!  We loved it.

This turned out great! We loved it! After the first 25 minutes I sprinkled additional chocolate chips on the top since most of them did seem sink to the bottom. This was amazing hot & it was just as good the next day when it was cold.

Very yummy.  I didn't have chocolate chips so I used butterscotch chips.  It was soooo good.  You don't need a very big piece so one pie goes a long way.

This pie was great!! I followed some of the other reviewer suggestions and only used 3/4 cup butter and a deep dish pie pan. Really simple to make as I used store bought pie crust. I also sprinkled a handful of chips on top with about 15 min baking time left. Definitely will make this one again!! Oh I also didn't use any nuts this time but I'm sure it will be great with either pecans or walnuts!

My changes were to only use 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 t vanilla (I'm not a huge fan of vanilla and using half ended up being a good decision!), leave out the nuts (we don't like them), and 1/8 teaspoon salt.  I read a bunch of the reviews first and made sure to beat my eggs for about 3 minutes in my mixer, and added my melted butter when it was warm rather than hot.  Then I checked the temperature of the batter before adding the chocolate chips to make sure it wasn't warm enough to melt them.  I read that the chips sink to the bottom of the pie, so used 3/4 cup regular chocolate chips and 1/4 cup minis because I thought maybe the minis wouldn't sink.  Turns out they'll sink no matter what size they are!  40 minutes after putting the pie in the oven, I sprinkled the top with another handful of chocolate chips.  My pie was actually done after 50 minutes.  I stuck a toothpick in the center and it came out mostly clean.  The pie is wonderful- it's just like eating a soft, gooey, fresh from the oven cookie.  Even when it cools and firms up, the texture is still like that!  Awesome!

I thought this was great! Like a big gooey chocolate chip cookie. I just made it in the pie plate without a crust. I also reduced the butter to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 teaspoon salt. Perfect! :)

My pie never cooked either.  After 2 hours, it was still so gooey that it wouldn't hold shape when cut. I followed the directions exactly, I can't figure it out. So dissapointed.

This is a family favorite that a friend in England made for  us the first time 12 years ago.   The key to success in this pie is to beat the eggs for at least 2 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Otherwise the pie separates.

Delicious! Family loved it. The only change I made was the BUTTER. Listened to another viewer and cut the butter down to stick and a half.  Next time, will use a graham cracker crust and milk chocolate chips.

Good, but not great - there are better "kentucky / derby pie" type recipes on the site.  This one turned out like a big, unbalanced chocolate chip cookie, with all the chocolate on the bottom and a bland, soft cookie on top.  Used walnuts, but suspect that pecans would have added some needed richness.

Tastes like a big cookie in a pie. I only added 1 stick of butter. Also, when pie was done, I added addtl choc chips to the top and spread out like frosting. Only bad thing is the chips seems to settle at the bottom during baking. Anyway - big hit!

This is a very good pie with a consistency like a buttermilk pie, which was a pleasant surprise.  I'm glad I waited a couple days to rate it though.  I did not like it right out of the oven.  It tasted better to me after it sat a day.  It also took almost 2 full hours to bake, which was annoying.  Next time I'll cut the butter in half as suggested by others. Update: I have now made this twice more. The 2nd time I made it I used 1/2 cup butter and it didn't taste right. This last time I used 3/4 cup butter and it was perfect!  Success!  And it only took 50 minutes to bake!

If you're after a chocolately pie, this one fits the bill. I used about 1/2 cup of butter which was plenty. Be sure you bring the eggs to room temperature prior to making this. This is a special treat with vanilla ice cream. You're going to love this one!

This recipe has waaaay too much butter in it.  I think it should probably read 1 STICK of butter, not 1 CUP.  Mine was a gooey, soupy mess that went into the garbage.  What a waste of ingredients, very disappointing.

this is good (good enough to rate well!), but when they say rich, they mean it. this is so rich, in fact, we probably won't finish it ourselves, and it will get passed on to the boys who work with my husband. likewise, i probably won't make it again any time soon ... but only because it's just too much, which isn't always a bad thing! i used about 1/2 cup more chocolate chips, and no nuts, just because i didn't have any. had to cook it an extra few minutes, too, but that's just my oven. i'd omit most of the salt, as well.

This recipe was good. It had to be served warm and was best with some vanilla ice cream. It was very rich. I used a graham cracker crust. I might make it again for special occassions, but I'll probably stick with regular old chocolate chip cookies most the time.

This recipe, although tasty, is far too rich and chocolatey to make often.  
Don't make it unless you REALLY like chocolate.

This was okay but not as good as I expected with all the rave reviews.  I followed the directions exactly except I used a graham cracker crust (extra serving size) and used pecans rather than walnuts.  I served it warm out of the oven.  Everyone ate it, but no rave reviews.  Don't know if I would make again.

This pie was amazing! I used a gluten free crust and gluten free flour in the filling (I have an allergy) and the rest of my family still loved it! The chocolate chips did settle together, but we ate this when it was still warm and it tasted just like a warm chocolate chip cookie! I will definitely make this again!

I followed some reviewers' advised and added some chocolate chip on top half way through the baking process. 1 cup of butter is WAY too much butter though - the grease was seeping out of the pie onto the sheet, and it simply is too greasy. I'll try it with just 1/2 cup next time.

I used deep dish pie crust simply because I had that on hand.  Cut down the nuts by half and used 3/4 cup butter. I made sure to beat the eggs for 3 minutes by what other review said.  I did keep it in for the entire time but made sure to cover the edges and also the center of pie once it started browning.   I did not measure the chips .  Maybe that's why I thought it tasted far to choclatey or else because they all sank to the bottom,  Might do what others did and add half of chips later.

This pie is amazing. Reduced the butter to 1/2 cup or 1 stick and it was still gooey and rich. The center is not supposed to be fully set - that's the point. It is supposed to be like a warm gooey cookie right out of the oven.

I've made this a few times and it's always a hit. I have found that if I decrease the butter by 1/4 cup and increase the flour by a 1/4 cup, that I get a more cookie-like pie, that isn't so heavy and too rich.   By doing this, all the chips don't sink to the bottom either.  I also do as others have suggested and drop some chocolate chips on top with about 20 minutes left to cook. Finally, I use a 9" graham cracker crust because that's what we prefer.

This recipe is so good! I love how the top gets harder like a cookie but the middle stays soft and gooey. Instead of a traditional crust, I subbed an Oreo crust and it made quite a difference! So so good!!!

Scrumptious when it's still warm out of the oven.  Oh man, it's so delicious.  I love it.  Every time I make this, everyone begs for the recipe. I never add the nuts because I'm just not a nut person in desserts.  Thanks for this recipe - I will make it again and again.

Rich and delicious!  Easy to make.  I followed other member's recommendations (use 3/4 C. butter, an already made graham cracker crust and sprinkled some chips on top).

Just made this last night for a small party. It was a hit with everyone. My husband already asked me to make it again! I followed the recipes except I used a grahm cracker crust, and I used extra chocolate chips and about 20 min before it was finished baking I sprinkle butterscotch chips over the top. That way there were chips at the top of the pie. Next I will add even more chips as that was hubby's only criticism.

amazing! and I even cut back on the amount of sugar (did 1/3 cup of each kind), the amount of chocolate chips (3/4 cup), the amount of walnuts (1/2 cup) and the amount of butter (3/4 cup) ALL in an effort to make it just a *little* healthier and it was just as good as the first time, when I made it as written. I loved it then and I love it now that I know I can cut back on the bad stuff a touch and still have a great pie that will only require an extra 15 minutes on the treadmill rather than an extra 30 minutes. thanks for sharing this recipe, a big hit with me and my chocolate-loving roommates as well!

I'm so disappointed to only give this recipe two stars.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It's been about two hours and the inside is still not done!!!  The top has been done for quite some time, but the inside just isn't baking.  I don't know what happened.  :(

This recipe had WAY too much butter in it! Next time I would try cutting the butter amount in half. The whole time baking the butter just bubbled around my pie crust and edges of the pan. Made it sooo greasy. Such a flop but I would try again with less butter :)

I made it just as it was written...delicious!  Yes, the chocolate chips sink to the bottom but that's okay...it looked like I layered it that way on purpose!  It looks impressive and tasted better...but very very rich!  You need coffee or a big glass of milk for this one.

Excellent and simple.  My 10 year old son wanted to make a pie and he picked this one.  After reading reviews I did cut the butter to 3/4c. Turned out great, very rich.

I recommend using a DEEP dish pie crust!  My filling overflowed in my oven which created lots of smoke.  After cleaning up the mess, I finished cooking the pie and it was very good and RICH.

The ONLY change I made was reducing the butter to 1 stick instead of 2.  It turned out to be a gooey mess - the pie fell completely while cooling - when I cut it, it was just a mess - crunchy on top and a gooey mess on the inside!

I doubled the recipe and used two deep dish crusts. I used the full amount of butter and everyone loved the pie; no one felt it was over buttered. In fact, I gave one of the pies to my teens; it was devoured. The other was for some colleagues that I had over . They are from Mexico and Peru and loved it. They thought that it was " really American" and took the left over slices back to their hotel. I recommend it as a special treat; it is too rich for every day :-)

This was really good. However, I found that it was too much filling for my pie crust (frozen store bought.) I actually ended up with a mess in my oven because I put too much of the filling into the pie shell. My guests all enjoyed it, though and I will make it again, I'm sure. The only changes I made were to use pecans instead of walnuts, and I bought a crust rather than made one.

I loved this recipe.  I did not have a pie crust but followed the rest of the recipe.  It turned out wonderful.  It baked in about 40 to 45 minutes without the crust.  It was so good I will make it this way again.  Eat it warm with vanilla ice cream and you'll want seconds!

I made this for Christmas this year and it was a huge hit with the kids and adults alike.  I served with vanilla ice cream and had many asking for more.  One thing I would suggest is only using 1/2 cup of butter.

In New England, this is what restaurants serve and call Kentucky Derby Pie, so I served it on that weekend to friends.  Big Hit.  Rich, chocolatey and yummy warm with French Vanilla ice cream.

Absolutely wonderful!  Tastes just like a big chocolate chip cookie in a pie crust.

Sooo easy, made it 4 my bud's birthday and made him take it home, along with the fresh whipped cream. He could never understand why I make sweets from scratch-he's a believer now...

This is a great pie.  It's just the right amount of sweetness not to sweet just right.  It's chewy like a giant chewy cookie the chocolate was perfect.  Loved it!

A delicious, sinfully rich pie.  I served it warm, with a dollop of whipped cream...my guests practically licked their plates clean.

There's only one drawback if serving to children...many do not like, or cannot eat nuts.

I have made this pie a couple of times and it has turned out different both times. My husband loves this pie. I will use this recipe quite often since it is easy. I think you could also put in peanut butter chips instead. Thank you for the recipe.
