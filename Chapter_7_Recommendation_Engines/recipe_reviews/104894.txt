I lost my 100% whole wheat pancake recipe and tried this one.  What a wonderful surprise.  My son and husband sucked them up and I had to make another batch.  I always double it now and use a 1/3 cup batter per pancake.  My alterations:  All organic ingredients, 3 tablespoons sugar instead of 2,  and brown sugar instead of the substitute.   Ive made them several times and the recipe proportions are great.  As is, you will have a bouncy, very thick pancake.  Sometimes the family wants thin pancakes and I add 1/4 cup milk (for base recipe- double this for a double recipe).  My recommendation is to use fresh ground flour!  Use soft wheat berries.  We love this recipe better than my old one!

Great recipe. Just add a bit more milk (or soy milk) and you're good to go! I make all the dry stuff in large, large batches, store, and then when ready, measure out the right amount of "mix" and add the wet. This way, we're all ready in the mornings!

I use this recipe almost every weekend!  It is so versatile that I can make different kinds with whatever I have on hand.  I've used ripe bananas, blueberries, blackberries, and even used just cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves/vanilla when I didn't have any fruit.  You can sub some or all while flour if you are running low or have picky eaters.  I even use vanilla soy milk to add that hint of vanilla and sweetness.  I use Splenda instead of packet sweeteners and find that 1/4c of Splenda does the trick.  These are so good you can eat them without any syrup!  I usually make a double batch and put the extras in the fridge or freezer.  Just pop in micro or toaster and you are good to go! You don't even have to worry about overly juicy fruit, like if you use frozen, because I usually end up using more than the cup of milk and the juice makes up the difference.  I absolutely love this recipe and it is SO easy to mix, match, change, add and still I have yet to have a bad batch!  I even keep them warm in the oven while cooking other items and they still turn out great!  Top with some sugar free syrup and it is the best "healthy" breakfast that the kids won't even notice there's no added sugar!

These were excellent. We used cane sugar instead of artificial, and 2 eggs instead of one. We also added a couple tablespoons of wheat germ and a little flax seed meal for some added nutrition. Even my picky 4-year-old loved these!

Soooo good!! I did add 1/2 t of cinnamon and vanillaand doubled the blueberries (my family really love them). I was also a little leary of all the whole wheat , so I used 1/2c of white and 3/4c of whole wheat,and I did need to add about 2 T more of milk, butthese pancakes are great!

I'm sorry but i did not like these and am wondering what I did wrong because there where so mnay good reviews.  I love whole wheat flour more than white too but these had a weird bitter taste to them and all my baking supplies are newer and have been used before so I dont think that is the problem. m The only i did differently was rubbed oil on the pan ibnstead of using spray.

since it's a little dry, adding blueberries, chocolate chips, or mashed bananas makes it so moist and delicious

I thought these were pretty good. I didn't have blueberries so instead I made them "stuffed". I sliced each pancake almost in half and put in a dollop of homemade fat free raspberry lebneh mixed with a small bit of low fat sour cream. EXCELLENT!! I am thinking these could probably be made stuffing with with vegetables if the sweetner isn't added.

They were great! Subbed 8th Continent Vanilla soy milk because of DD's milk allergy and used 2TBSP sugar instead of artificial sweetener. Made the kid's without blueberries(weird ones, they don't like blueberry pancakes, just plain!) and they still were great!

First time making homemade pancakes & I'm pleased I went with this recipe.  Very nice indeed.  A little tough around the edges but the taste made up for it.  Great tasting, these will remain in my recipe box.  Thanks brossettelewis.  UPDATE: August 1, 2010....this is now my go-to recipe for home made pancakes.  I've been making them with & without the blueberries as well as strawberries too.  I've also been adding a tablespoon or two of Flax Seed.  Delicious, I'll never buy boxed pancakes again. To the folk who think these are too heavy or thick...add more milk like the recipe suggests.  And don't forget things are going to be heavier with whole wheat flour.  Personally I think these are 5 star pancakes.  Thanks again.

We really liked these pancakes, and I really like the short list of ingredients!  I dug out some whole wheat flour from the freezer, and we had a tasty breakfast.  The recipe made 6 6-inch pancakes.  After preheating and lightly oiling my griddle, I stirred up the batter, leaving out the blueberries.  When I poured the batter on the griddle, I placed my blueberries on top of each pancake, lightly pressing them down into the batter.  As they cooked, the batter rose around them, and when ready, I flipped them and finished cooking.  This prevented my batter from turning purple, and I was able to evenly distribute the berries in each portion.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Just what I was looking for. I left out the blueberries because I didn't have any. I was just seeking a WW pancake recipe. I used 3tsp egg beaters and 1.5 cups of almond milk. Portioned each at 1/4 cup which made 10 pancakes at 66 calories each! Just the perfect fit into my breakfast.

These pancakes are delicious! I've made them different ways but our favorite way is: add 2 teas. brown sugar to the milk egg mixture, and add 1/4 cup ground flax seeds and 1/4 cup ground hazelnuts to the flour mixture then combine. It may require a bit more milk to thin. When done we top with a dallop of plain yogurt and maple syrup, so yummy and filling.

This is a great whole wheat pancake base. The only thing I would not recommend adding is artifical sweetner. I didn't have blueberries today, so I added some milk chocolate chips to my pancakes and my family ate their plain with real maple syrup.

Very nice recipe! I tripled it and used a mixed variety of flours (buckwheat, corn, rice, oats, wheat, & coconut) for a multigrain pancake. Used brown sugar in place of artificial sweetener and extra blueberries.  Excellent! My new go to basic pancake recipe.

Very easy, very tasty, and healthy too. I tried some other whole wheat pancake recipes that came out very tough and rubbery, but these are nice and fluffy. These have become a staple for weekend breakfasts when my fiance and I get together to cook. We modified the recipe slightly, though- sugar instead of artificial sweetener, and start with just 1 cup of flour so you don't have to do so much guesstimating on how much milk to put in. We also add a 1/2 tsp or so of cinnamon and another of vanilla. And instead of mixing the blueberries into the batter, we drop them into the individual pancakes after we pour them into the pan. That way the berries don't sink to the bottom of the bowl and all end up in the last 2 cakes. Sometimes we drop in some crushed walnuts too. Very yummy!

My new favorite healthy pancake!  These are so light and fluffy and delicious.  Instead of artificial sweetener, we used 2 T of pure maple syrup.  We also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla (just because that's what we always do).  We used defrosted blueberries, with their juice and 1 1/8 cups of milk.  We spread the batter on the griddle, right after ladling to help with quick and even cooking.  My 2 1/2 year olds ate two huge pancakes each.  Quick and easy and healthy and delicious.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Fantastic pancakes.  Very versatile recipe!  I used bananas instead of blueberries and they were a hit!  Next time I might substitute some other berries to change things around.  Check out these pancakes if you're looking for a healthy, delicious, quick breakfast!  (I also used sugar-free syrup to make them even more healthy!)

Wonderful recipe! I followed it exactly EXCEPT: used buttermilk in place of regular milk, and honey in place of artificial sweetener. I added a full cup of blueberries instead of half a cup. I slowly added 1/2 cup regular (2%) milk until it came to the right consistency since the batter was very doughlike at first. They came out perfectly! Pretty great for making pancakes from scratch for the first time. Eat your heart out, Bisquick!! :D

These pancakes were delicious!  I used 1 tbsp Demerara sugar instead of the artificial sweetener.  The batch was too much for my husband and I, so I am freezing the rest of it as another review suggested.

I used vanilla soy milk, added cinnamon & nutmeg and put the blueberries onto each pancake rather than in the pancake mixture.  I eliminated the sugar as the syrup was sufficient.  You could also add walnuts to the dough...yummy! Excellent recipe.

Yummy! Very fluffy and easy to make. Add in some flax or flax meal and you have yourself a healthy breakfast.

Yummy - but i mixed whole wheat and white flour... 3/4 cup whole wheat with 1/2 cup white because i don't like the taste of whole wheat all by itself.

This is my go-to blueberry pancake recipe, from now on.  I generally modified baked recipes because I only bake with whole-wheat flour, so this was a nice change, to have a recipe made for it.  I used whole-wheat PASTRY flour, which just has a silkier feel (more like white flour).  The only substitution I made was using real sugar instead of the substitute sugar.  Fresh blueberries would have been better but these were delicious with frozen.  Truly, this is perfect as-is.  Healthy but not heavy, very mildly sweet, and a genuinely filling breakfast.  Don't expect uber-fluffy starchy diner flapjacks - this is the next generation of comfort food.  Good stuff.

This was a really good recipe!  I didn't have milk so I used powdered milk to make 2 cups - 4 heaping tablespoons dissolved in water to make 2 cups, frozen blueberries and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, used 1 tbsp white sugar and 1 tbsp brown in place of the sweetner.  I only let mine sit about 15 minutes and they were still really good, thinner than in the picture but I didn't mind at all.  Will make these again!

Excellent.  Didn't have blueberries, added chocolate chips for my daughter.  Don't like to use artificial sweetner so added 2 tablespoons of applesauce.  Will make again!

They were pretty good! I'd def. make them again. But next time, I'd ad more (maybe even double) the blueberries an I'd probably add brown sugar. It neeed to be just a tad sweeter, but all in all they were yummy!

Addicted!  Since I tried this recipe 2 weeks ago, I have been making tons of pancakes.  I followed the recipe very closely, using the extra 1/4 of milk and also adding 3 tbls of Splenda brown sugar.  My pancakes come out delicious and I have been making lots of the on the weekend and then reheating for breakfast during the week.  I top them with peanut butter and honey...yum!  I have made these with blueberries, apples, and plain.  You won;t be disappointed!

Awesome recipe! Defiantly needs more liquid as recommended. I did 1 1/2 cups which makes it the best consistency. I added strawberries, bananas, and blueberries. Big family breakfast hit 5 times now.

Excellent blueberry pancakes. Even my picky preschooler, who barely eats anything, ate an entire one and asked for another. I highly recommend that you try it. I loved the texture and that they do not spread too much. I doubled the recipe and cut the salt in half. Seemed like a lot of salt for pancakes. I'm freezing several for a quick weekday morning breakfast.

This recipe is amazing.  The pancakes turned out perfectly.  These are the best blueberry pancakes I have ever tasted.  I used organic regular sugar (didn't measure just eyeballed) because I don't like using artificial ingredients, used organic flour, eggs, and milk, as well as organic pan spray.  I think think organic tastes so much better, but that may just be psychological.

I think it's a good recipe, but I had to add much more than 1 T of artificial sweetener, (lost track) plus 1 t of vanilla and about 1/2 t of cinnamon. Thought they DID need butter plus syrup when eaten.  I have a very sweet tooth, so maybe it was just me.

Love this!  Tasted GREAT.  Wear a bib, though, because my white shirt got sprayed with blueberry juice THREE separate times while eating!  YUMMY!!  :)  I used something called "white whole wheat flour" which was a nice, mild flour - the pancakes didn't even taste whole wheat-y.  I didn't put in any of the sugar substitute, or anything else to sweeten it up because I was going to use syrup on top.  But when I took my first bite, I decided to forgo the syrup, and I just loved it!!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Good recipe! I'll definitely make it again, but next time I'll make more--I gave it 4 stars because the recipe as is would make absurdly small pancakes (like, barely palm-sized) if you tried to make 10 out of it, this recipe supposedly yields. I also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla.

these were not bad-other whole wheat pancakes I've made have turned out super rubbery and with weird textures. these were relatively fluffy in comparison. I used 1.5 Tbsp cane sugar and chopped strawberries and added 2 Tbsp ground flaxseeds. I also ended up using way more milk to get a good consistency-maybe 1.5 cups or more. We still added peanut butter and syrup on top and it was a great breakfast :)

Made these this morning but I thinned the batter out a lot more. Also, used liquid Kirkland Egg Beaters instead of the whole egg. Without a doubt, the recipe is outstanding.

YUMMY! I've tried numerous pancake recipes over the last month and this is a keeper. I love the simplicity of it. I, too, modified it slightly by adding some vanilla extract and brown sugar vs. artificial sweetener. The batter did need additional milk, but the recipes indicates this. My family loved it!

Pretty good. I used a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar instead of the art sweetener. I also put in a couple of tablespoons of coconut milk to keep them from getting too dry. Excellent!

These were great as is.  The second time I made them with these changes and liked them even more.  I doubled the amount of blueberries (I used frozen blueberries and they cooked just fine).  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg.  Probably about 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  My husband and I loved 'em even more!

I never made pancakes from scratch before, but we are on this no white food kick, and after 2 weeks I miss pancakes, so I looked this up.  The batter was thick, so I added the milk.  My husband doesn't like blueberries so I always add them after I put the batter on the griddle.  they were very good; not as light and fluffy as I would like, but I will work with the recipe.  I did not use sugar but I put vanilla extract.  They were a hit with the hubby too.  Next we'll try it with waffles.

This was a great pancake recipe. It is among the few of the many whole wheat pancake recipes I've tried that tasted like a pancake! I've tried a lot of "pancake" recipes in a search for a recipe that is both good for you and delicious. This one made the mark, we will be making this over and over again. Part of the reason I've tried so many recipes is that I lose most of them, you know, print them out and then can't find them in the black hole of retired recipes, so I like that I can save recipes on allrecipes.com. They have a great website. I tweaked the recipe by adding about 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and a good dusting of cinnamon for added flavor. I did this recipe in a big batch: x5! This also works for a waffle recipe, but I would suggest maybe a tablespoon or two more oil if you like them crispy on the outside. Loved it and will be making many more times in the future. BTW: We demolished about 3/4 of the batch :) They were great! The rest are frozen waiting for a time crunch morning.

I absolutely loved these and so did my guests - I should have made more!  You would barely guess that these pancakes were made with all whole wheat flour!  I used fresh blueberries and substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar Splenda.  I served these with Citrus Wild Blueberry Sauce from this site - that went really well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've never made pancakes from scratch.  I had blueberries to use and was curious about the whole wheat.  These were very good.  I have nothing else to compare it too, but I don't think I need to find anything.  I ate a couple the morning I made them with a little butter.  Being single and living alone, I had no one else to help me eat the rest so I froze them.  The next morning, I took one out, nuked it for about 15 seconds then popped it in the toaster just to get rid of some of the moisture.  I ate it with a little whipped cream cheese and it was good!  I'm not much of a breakfast person but I know I need to eat.  I ate one pancake and was fine until lunch.  I will be making these again to throw in the freezer for an easy breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe!  Oh, and I don't know how much it changed the flavor, but I added a 1/4 ts of vanilla and 1/2 ts cinnamon.  I also used water because I didn't have milk.  I will definitly use milk next time.

Made these today and they turned out very well.  I used splenda instead of sugar. I'm trying to eat healthier so this was a better choice than making regular pancakes and even my husband who does not like wholewheat bread at all and said they were good! Since it was only 2 of us I have frozen the leftovers so when I want a quick and easy breakfast I can just pull  them out of the freezer!

This recipe was delicious and so filling! I did have to add more milk...about a 1/4 of a cup...and I used the 2 tbs of real sugar that someone else suggested (I don't ever consume artificial sugars). My fiancé loved them and he's not a whole wheat person!

I think these are very quick to put together and taste great. I always add a full cup of blueberries and usually add 2 Tbsp. of real sugar.

I made this over Easter weekend. It was delicious. I did use regular sugar instead of the sweetner. My husband said he couldn't tell the difference between the white flour receipe and this one. I'm happy to be serving my family whole wheat instead of white flour now.

I was very impressed with this recipe.  They are light, fluffy and soft.  Not heavy and dense like you would expect from whole wheat.  I did find that I liked them a little better with an added TBS of sugar, but they would be fine without for those who want to cut back.

Wonderful! I used egg beaters instead of eggs applesauce instead of sweetener and apricots instead of blueberries (since that is what I had on hand). Very healthy recipe.

This is a very good whole wheat recipe.  The batter "held" the berries quite well.  I used 2 T. agave instead of the artificial sweetener as well as twice the blueberries.  I also added a splash of vanilla and sprinkle of cinnamon.  The note recommends using up to 1/4 c. more milk, and I felt that was needed.  For my family, I then doubled the whole recipe and used 1/2 c. batter per pancake.  Thank you for sharing!

I love this recipe! I've tried a few whole-wheat pancake recipes and this is definitely my favourite so far. They turn out nice and fluffy (for whole-wheat pancakes anyway... they're more dense than those with white flour, but that's what I was going for!), and I don't find the taste of baking powder stands out as it does in some other recipes I've tried where they use more to compensate for the whole wheat flour. I also like that it doesn't use any white flour. I use a bit of honey instead of the artificial sweeter, and add some vanilla when making them with berries. I really enjoy playing with this recipe, and have a lot of success adding some chopped apple and cinnamon instead of the berries when the mood strikes.

Wonderful, but without the tablespoon of artificial sweetener please. Better to use organic cane sugar than industrial chemicals. Adding mashed bananas helped with the moistness too. A few walnuts in the mix if you like a nutty texture.

I love this recipe, however, maybe because I am at a high elevation, I have to add a little more milk to the recipe, or the pancakes are too dense. I don't always have fruit to put in them, but the base is great with just pecans or walnuts or plain too!! Thank You!! Love this recipe!! I also did not use fake sweetener, I just used organic raw sugar from wholesome foods, since it is a fine grain, and I can get a 10 lb bag at Costco for around $11-$12.

2.5 stars.  I thought that for a 4.5 star recipe, these pancakes would taste better than your run of the mill whole wheat pancake...at least different.  I was disappointed but will concede that these were very fluffy and that I did not have any problems with undercooked batter around my store bought fresh blueberries.  I would be willing to sacrifice calories and nutrition for better tasting pancakes, since pancakes are an indulgence for me.

I've tried several whole wheat pancake recipes, often with poor results - too doughy, too rubbery etc. but these turn out nice and fluffy, like regular pancakes only much healthier! I use frozen blueberries which is fine, just make sure to take them out of the freezer and let them thaw while you're making the pancake batter!

I added some more milk (didn't measure), and I added lemon juice and poppy seeds (because I wanted to use them up).  Delish!!  Very fluffy (for whole wheat) moist.  I used stevia, and it was perfect.

Delicious! This was my first time making pancakes from scratch and they turned out beautifully. I did add a bit of vanilla and cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers, and used regular sugar since I don't buy artificial stuff. I also added splash of lemon juice/zest because I was craving lemon blueberry pancakes! Great recipe that I will use again and again.

Great recipe! I made a few changes as I wanted to sub some coconut flour to add a little extra nutrition. I used 1 C ww flour, 1/4 C coconut flour, an extra egg, and about 7 extra Tbsp of milk. 

Turned out FABULOUS! And I'm sure they'd have been just as good as the recipe is written, just wanted to share my own twist.

These were great, but I altered the recipe a bit.  I used Skim Milk, used 1/2 tbs no-cal sweetener, 1/2 tbs light brown sugar, and added nutmeg and cinnamon to the flour and baking powder.  I also recommend adding the bluberries to the pancakes individually once they are on the skillet.  If you make 12 pancakes "my way", there are 130.6 calories for every 2.

These turned out great! I did substitute 1 1/2 Tbsp real maple syrup for the artificial sweetener. I think the maple syrup helped keep the pancakes moist. Also added a splash more milk and subbed frozen strawberries for the blueberries.

I added vanilla and cinnamon as suggested in another review. I added 1/4 c more milk for a thinner pancake.  I also left out the blueberries as I didn't want my sons face stained blue before Sunday bible study. I gave four stars. They were light and fluffy. But I think they would have been lacking in flavor without the vanilla.

Just made these for breakfast a few minutes ago. Granted, I am one of those rare people who make things whole wheat because I prefer the taste, but my 5 Stars still say a lot! ... and I didn't even have any blueberries on hand, nor do I care for chocolate chips. My plan is to caiter to my tastes a bit more next time... I'm definitely going out today and buying either toffee-bits, butterscotch flavored chips, or better yet caramel flavored chips and using them in the batter. If I rated it 5 stars without fruit or chips I can't wait to try it with them! Thanks so much!
PS - I froze the leftovers and I pull them out whenever I want and they microwave beautifully. 30 seconds to a minute does the trick, and they taste just like they're hot off the griddle.
Update: I stated previously that I probably liked them so much more than others may because I prefer the taste of whole wheat. But my little brother stayed the night at my place when my mother was on a trip, and I made these for us for breakfast and he didn't notice they were any different than the Aunt Jemima ones my mother makes! I didn't tell him till afterwards. He looked a bit stunned that he'd just eaten - and enjoyed - sugar free/low fat (I used Skim milk anyway)/100% whole wheat pancakes! 
And whenever I do have regular pancakes away from home they just don't measure up anymore. ;)

Made these for my son before school but I doubled the recipe and used 2 bananas (chopped) vs blueberries (didn't have any) added some white choclate chip lightly chopped. I also added a bit of vanilla & almond extract and a dash of cinnimon. I used suncrystals vs sugar. I topped with a few slices of banana & chopped white chips & used sugar free syrup. They were a HUGE hit!!! Thanks for sharing. Looking foward to making again with another kind of fruit.

These were good. I added a little bit of vanilla extract, because that's how my mom always made pancakes. We used these without fruit, just because we didn't have any. I also definitely needed more milk. Probably close to a 1/4 or 1/3 of a cup more.

My husband and I both really enjoyed these! The changes I made:
I subbed 1/4 cup white flour for wheat;
I added some vanilla as per other reviewers' suggestions;
I eye-balled how many blueberries to add;
I used 3/4 tbs sugar instead of sweetener

Will definitely make this recipe again.

As far as pancakes go these are relatively healthy; unfortunately, you can taste it. If you enjoy a strong whole-wheat flavor and pancakes that are not overly sweet, these are worth trying. Tried them with various toppings: plain, applesauce, maple syrup... Not a recipe I would care to make again.

Wonderful! I used vanilla soy milk for less fat and sodium, and didn't have any fresh blueberries, so I put in some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. I don't really like maple syrup too much, so finding a pancake that I can eat without syrup is important. These did it! I bet you can even add some juice of berries, orange, or other fruit instead of adding more milk to sweeten it more; I'm doing that next time. Love it!

Very good for being completely whole wheat, and very filling. Also so simple!

These were a little thick and really dense.  I think next time I'll go half regular flour and half wheat flour.  Also, I left the salt out.  There was enough saltiness from the baking powder.

Really good! Instead of artificial sweetener, I used 2 T. of brown sugar. Since some of the reviews said the pancakes turned out dry, I added 2 T. of unsweetened applesauce, so they turned out moist for me. Perfect with real maple syrup!

This is a very simple & wonderful recipe!  I make a batch of these every other week for my son!  I do skip the artificial sweetner & use a tablespoon or two of honey instead.  Yum!

These pancakes are wonderful!!! Hubby loved it, kids loved it and I love it!!  I did alter it just a little, I used soy milk instead of regular and a little bit of agave nectar instead of artificial sweetener.  I usually make pancakes at least once a week, this will definitely be my go to pancake recipe. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!!

This was wonderful! I am super creative, but I need a solid starting point, so I used this (so excited it doesn't have butter or oil!). I added some oatmeal and cinnamon and used soy milk instead. I topped them with homemade granola and a bit of honey. I can't wait to make them again!!!

These pancakes turned out really good. The second time I made them, I used a little more sweetener as the pancakes seemed bland with only 1 tablespoon of sweetener. Otherwise, delicious!

I had some trouble with this one, but I also added flax which I think made it too thick. I did add extra milk which helped, but it was still pretty think. I also just wiped the skillet with olive oil and I don't think I used enough because they started to kind of burn at the end. I also made the drops too big I think because they turned out huge. I'm a newish cook so I think this is why all the trouble. Anyway, give it a try it's still good.

Yum! I omit the salt and sweetener. If you're adding syrup, you don't need additional sweetener. I also add about 1/2 cup of oatmeal.

I was not impressed with these. I have to admit that I have never cooked with wheat flour before and I have never made pancakes with fruit in them before.  I think that I am not used to the wheat flour and it's texture, also felt they were very bland and not even the syrup helped much.

Great WW pancakes! I was out of blue berries so I added a couple TBSP of oil to keep them moist and cinn and vanilla for taste. Nice and fluffy (which is difficult with WW sometimes). Excited to add some fruit next time.

I used a blend of white and whole wheat flour because my Hubby is afraid to eat healthy! They were very dense, but flavorful! I didn't have blueberries, so I added vanilla and sugar for flavoring. Be sure to add a bit of extra water.

I used a premixed 1/2 white/wheat I get from a local coop then added about 1/3 cup oats and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.  Also used 2 Tbs of brown sugar instead of 1Tbs artificial sweetner and the extra 1/2 cup milk as suggested.  These were by far the best from scratch "healthy" pancakes I've ever made.  I was really impressed at how fluffy they were when they rose after being flipped.  Super good.  Thanks for a keeper!

I love whole wheat and choose it anytime it is an option.  However, these tasted like paper with blueberries to me.  I don't know if I did something wrong or if that is how they are supposed to taste.  I did make my own syrup to go with them (1/2 cup of honey, 1/4 cup of butter and about a tsp of cinnamon melted together).  It was DELICIOUS and made these the best tasting blueberry paper I have ever had!  Sort of defeats the "healthy" aspect of the pancakes but when you are looking to treat yourself definitely try this!

These are delicious. I subbed 1/4 cup of the whole wheat flour for white, because I have a couple of picky eaters. But to add to the health benefits I had taken away I added 2 tablespoons of wheat germ and a tablespoon of ground flax seed. I used 2 eggs, and a little more milk than the recipe called for since we like our pancakes a little thinner than that. Instead of artificial sweetener I used 2 T white sugar, and 1 T brown sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla, and put in a full cup of blueberries. These are delicious and really didn't even need syrup. I can see that they are also quite versatile and would be good with mashed banana, raspberries, mashed strawberries, chocolate chips, etc.

Best whole wheat pancakes ever! They turned out light and wonderful even without following the prep instructions very closely. I threw everything into one bowl (except the blueberries) and combined, then let it sit while the griddle heated up. I used a 1/4 cup measure to ladle out the batter after adding a bit more milk, then dropped the berries on top of each pancake as they cooked. Definitely the ONLY whole wheat pancake recipe I'll use from now on!

I loved these.  I made a blueberry syrup with 1 c. water, 1/2 c. Splenda and 1/2 c. sugar, about 1 1/2 c. fresh blueberries, and 1/2 tbsp corn starch.  The result was awesome.  Even my 4 year old, who doesn't typically care for blueberries, loved it.  I have already shared this recipes with my sisters!

Very good!  My three kids love blueberry pancakes, but they are very picky eaters and I was worried that they would reject these due to the whole wheat.  No need to worry!  Even one of my sons - who eats them plain (no butter or syrup) ate heartily!

I made the batter for this the night before, so all I had to do this morning was spoon it on the griddle. I used buttermilk and added a tsp. of vanilla. Very good. I served this with Cinnamon Cream Syrup also from this site. It went well with these pancakes.

Great recipe.  I use applesauce instead of sugar.  Super tasty.  Also, whip the egg whites(after removing yolks), it adds that extra bit of fluffiness!

Very good base recipe, but only 4 stars because I had to change it a bit.  I use whole wheat pastry flour instead of whole wheat flour, omit the sugar substitute and salt.  Sometimes I add some fresh ground nutmeg to the batter, nutmeg really compliments all things blueberry.  I also make a blackberry sauce to top: 1 cup fresh blackberries, 1/4 cup fresh squeezed OJ, 1/4 cup pure maple syrup; mix and boil, stir in a bit of cornstarch if it's not thick enough.  SO good you don't realize you're eating a very healthy meal full of antioxidants!  We have these every Sunday before church, and even my picky children gobble them up!

I scaled down the recipe for just myself (1 serving), so that might have affected these, and I omitted the blueberries (which, I know, sounds really dumb, but I wasn't in the mood for pancake mix-ins.) The batter yielded rather bland, dull pancakes. They needed something else in them (I really should have added those berries.) Maybe I'll try this recipe again how it's supposed to made because of the great reviews, but probably not. 

However, the pancakes did rise very well. They were light and fluffy. Too bad they didn't taste better.

I have never had whole wheat pancakes before, so maybe they are supposed to be a little dull.  They were pretty good, but not compared to regular pancakes!  My son gobbled them up, but there was maple syrup drizzled all over them.

Delicious!  I heeded advice from everyone else and added just a bit more milk and 2 tbs. sugar instead of the artificial sweetener, also subsituted blueberries for chocolate chips (it's what we had on hand) and presto!  They were fantastic and my boyfriend admits now that whole wheat is definately the way to go.  And still was around 273 calories per serving, which is still awesome!

These are absolutely fabulous. I didn't have blueberries so i subbed for strawberries, they came out nice and airy. I've never made pancakes like this before, this is definetly a keeper. I also like the fact that the recipe stats that more milk may be needed, because i definetly needed more milk...

I love this recipe.  I used the conversion setting to reduce it down to one serving, and I can make these for myself when I have time on the weekends.  A few changes though--I typically add in 1-2 tbs of wheat germ and 1-2 tbs of Bob's Red Mill 5-grain Rolled Cereal (similar to oatmeal, but with whole wheat, rye, oats, flaxseed, barley, and triticale).  And the great thing about these pancakes is the recipe is so basic you can add in any other flavorings you're in the mood for too--if I don't have blueberries on hand, I'll add in cinnamon and vanilla extract, or pumpkin, or whatever else I have handy.

These were delicious!! I used fresh strawberries instead of blueberries, which I highly recommend. Also, I halved the recipe (but still used a whole egg; I also used only whole wheat flour. These cakes were moist, tender, and perfect!

Added some extra milk to loosen the batter up and used frozen blueberries, which turned the pancakes a pretty shade of purple. My kids gobbled them up and were very full afterwards - hooray for making our weekend tradition a little healthier! I saved the last portion of batter for me and added some protein powder and they cooked up just as wonderfully. We doubled the recipe, and it gave us 11 pancakes (I used a 1/2-cup scoop to measure each one), which allowed extra to freeze for a quick weekday meal. I will definitely be making these again!!

Mmmmmmm just ate these and they were so delicious. Fast and easy. Added some dried cranberries, walnuts and flaxseed. Even the husband loved them so much he said we should never buy boxed pancake mix again. Agreed.

These pancakes are DELISH! I used unsweetened Almond milk instead and used the extra 1/4 cup and they were so light and fluffy. I also used honey instead of an artificial sweetener. These pancakes will be a weekly breakfast in our home!:)

This is my new fav recipe, except I make it with half milk half plain yogurt for a thicker pancake. Also I use sugar or any other natural sweetener rather than artificial as a matter of preference. Plus add a little vanilla, some cinnamon, and yum!!

Great pancake recipe! Add however much milk you prefer to get your desired consistency. I use this recipe all the time and change up the fruit. A favorite is mashed banana in the batter and stirring in cut up strawberries. I will also add a splash of vanilla or a dash of cinnamon sometimes, so good!

Five stars as written!
I tried these again and used 3/4 cup oat flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat, subbed sugar free applesauce for the sweetener, added a couple of tablespoons of ground flaxseed, about a teaspoon of vanilla, and a mashed banana.  They were to die for.  Thank you for providing us with a healthy and delicious pancake recipe, they are hard to come by.

Awesome recipe.  I was afraid that with only whole wheat flour they would be dry but they weren't.  We didn't have blueberries so I made them without and served them with sliced strawberries, cinnamon and whip cream on top.  I doubled the recipe but only used 1 Tbs of baking powder.  Like other reviewers I added vanilla.

I changed the ingredients a little bit. I used 1/2 cup 1% milk and 1/2 cup water. I also used a tsp of honey instead of artificial sweetener. I added 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce. I also used baking soda instead of baking powder. The kids loved these. Much better than the ingredients that come out of a box.

Soo good. I altered the recipe a bit. No sweetener and two mashed overripe bananas instead of blueberries. I also used unsweetened almond milk, approx. 1 and 3/4 cups until I reached the desired consistency. They came out amazing!!!

I'll never use another full fat, zero nutrition pancake recipe again.  These are fluffy and flavourful.  I added a splash of vanilla and used bananas instead of blueberries, and almond milk instead of milk.  Delish, and not dry at all!

This recipe is PERFECT, PERIOD. I wanted to take pics to upload but it looked so darn good that I only remembered after I said "wow, that was really epic" with a clean plate. The only alterations I made was 1 tablespoon of brown sugar instead of the artificial sweetener. I topped my pancake with organic honey instead of sugar syrup or maple. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

There is a sight chance that these would be better if I had added real sugar, but I doubt it. I liked this recipe because it was healthier than most pancake recipes, but it was not good at all. Unfortunately, the only way I could consume them was to pour syrup all over them bad boys and stuff many berries in my mouth. I would advise substituting them with bananas because bananas are awesome, but I wont make these again. Also, you probably shouldn't do what I did unless you like choking.

I used egg replacer instead of an egg and used about 1 cup and a quarter of milk..even tho i forgot to sift the flour it came out delicious! I did not have blueberries on hand eithe..but i am certain it would have been  even yummier.

Great! Omitted the blueberries. I had to add water to thin out the batter. We don't like thick pancakes and if you don't thin it out, they are thick. I also added mashed bananas and creamy peanut butter to half of the batter.....delicious!

I tweaked this recipe a little and loved the results!  I doubled the recipe, adding 3/4 c. rolled oats and an extra egg. I also substituted the regular milk with coconut milk  (about 2 1/2 c. because I doubled the recipe), used 3/4 c. brown sugar instead of artificial sweetener and used frozen mixed berries instead of fresh blueberries. I was pleasantly surprised how light and fluffy these were--not the heavy texture and "healthy" taste I was expecting.  They were really good!  Everyone in my family (hubby and 6 kids under age 10) gobbled them up.

These were wonderful, even without the blueberries (I didn't have any on hand, but wanted whole wheat pancakes).  I took another reviewer's advice and used 3 Tbl. brown sugar instead of the artificial sweetener.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used 1/2 quinoa flour, some coconut palm sugar and added some vanilla extract.  They were yummy and made enough to freeze for a few days of breaks during the week.

Just finished these for breakfast. They were good,  A little bit bland if you dod not get a peice with a blueberry, but the syrup helped with that, and the fact that i added extra blueberries. The texture was a little  bit grainy but they were stillf light and fluffly. I will make again.

We really enjoyed these pancakes.  I only made 2 small modifications.  I added a splash of vanilla and 1 T. Ground Flax Seed.  These will be making an appearance on our breakfast table again.

Fantastic recipe. I was looking for a way to healthify the normal pancake recipe and found this. If you're eating them with syrup, then omit the sugar/sweetener all together. I used raspberries delicious.

These were awesome.  Just started changing white flour to whole wheat flour in my diet and i thought these might not taste so hot but wow were they good.  I can't deal with artificial sweetener though so I did sub it with 2 tbsp. plain sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were amazing.  More fluffy than other ww pancake recipes I've made, and so yummy.  I accidentally added the wet to dry instead of vice versa, but they still turned out great.   I also added 1 tsp vanilla extract and used a mix of half vanilla soymilk, one quarter regular milk, and one quarter water instead of one cup milk.

Added 2 small very very ripe banana's which made it really moist so not sure if they would've been dry without that but I needed to use them.  Delicious!

I made these on the weekend, not knowing how well they would taste, so I made only half of the recipe because I didn't want to make ten pancakes for myself (I'm the only one in my family that loves pancakes, crazy, right?!) I definitely had to add the blueberries because I'm a huge blueberry fan, and once I tasted them I was surprised how wonderful they were! I added some vanilla and cinnamon to them because I mostly add vanilla to everything, sometimes cinnamon. This recipe is a definite save! It was the first time I made homemade pancakes, now I don't have to buy the store bought boxes! Give this a five star!

Good! Found that I definitely NEEDED that extra 1/4+ cup milk, because my batter was so thick. I used organic agave instead of artificial sweetener, and added a dash of vanilla extract. Mmmm!

These were delicious. I followed the recipe but did add 1/2t vanilla & cinnamon. Base on the nutritional info I can gather, these are better than the B-quick Heart Smart mix that I normally use. Pre-diabetic DF raved & would eat again for a special weekend breakfast. Yum! Thick and delicious.

These are super fluffy and I just added some applesauce to it because it was real thick at first.  I also added vanilla and cinnamon..which I add to all my pancakes.  But it has a 3 year old seal of approval.  She loves them.

Best homemade pancakes I ever ate, bar none! I omitted the blueberries as I had none, and just followed the rest of the recipe. I used a heavy teflon-coated skillet and coated the bottom with a small amount of vegetable oil. I used about 1/2 cup extra milk, but then I may have had a tad more than 1-1/4 cups flour as I did not sift it. Also, I make my pancakes plate-sized and the recipe made 4 pancakes for me at that size. With the box-mix, buttermilk pancakes that I always used before I could always eat a full stack of 3 plate-sized cakes and still be hungry when done. But, I could only eat half the plate of 4 of these plate-sized cakes because of how filling these cakes are. I just put the leftovers in the fridge and will microwave them to eat later. I will never buy a box pancake mix again, if that tells you anything. So, give these a try. You will not be disappointed whether you use blueberries or just make them plain!

This is my second review.  Gush gush, this receip is amazing.  Today I substituted whole wheat pastry flour in our effort to be healthy, and it was AMAZING!  Can't believe it, actually.  I did put in a 1/2 tsp of baking powder to the blender, just before adding it to the pan.  From previous review, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp salt and dash of nutmeg.  Bon Appetit!

Wow, this recipe was brilliant.  I doubled it and added one more egg (so 3 eggs altogether).  I also left out the salt, and used demerara sugar instead.  SO delicious, and they really cooked well and didn't feel too doughy.

First time making scratch pancakes and using whole wheat flour.  A bit nervous that my very "unhealthy" hubby would not appreicate the wheat pancake.  I used king arthurs whole wheat pastry flour and fresh strawberries on some and banana's with cinnamon on others.  Also used fat free milk and was not sure if that would ruin the recipe, but still great! Husband loved them, didn't have a word of complaint!!!  They were very moist, didn't use tons of butter or syrup like on normal pancakes!  Will definitely make again...may throw in wheat germ, flax seed or chopped nuts???

These pancakes are flavorless. Perfect if you need something to throw your own spin on. Not so great if you like naked pancakes.

Doubled the recipe, used 3 tbs of sugar in place of the sweetener, and replaced 1/2 cup of the whole wheat flour with unbleached flour (I ran out of WW, oops!). Also used a mix of wild blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries. It didn't look like enough berries, so I added 1/2 cup more. It didn't need extra milk, & the family loved them! Will definitely make again.

I've made these every Saturday for 5 weeks now. Love Love Love.  Just add a touch more milk to make the batter a little more runny.  I have used blueberries, sometimes sliced up strawberries.  Once I had blackberries on hand and those were incredible.  Today I am going for chocolate chips.  Can't say how much I love making these! Oh and I use unsweetened almond milk (only 35 calories a cup!) to make these even healthier.

I decided to make these for Father's Day breakfast after taking my kids to a blueberry picking farm. Based on other reviews, I doubled the recipe and made the following modifications: 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup white flour, 2.5 cups 2% milk, and 2 TBSP honey.  

Doubling the recipe yielded 15 pancakes, each 1/4 cup of batter. 

I served these with "Blueberry & Raspberry Pancake Topping" (from this website, using only blueberries) and smoked turkey sausage. My hubby and the small kids loved them, but my teenager, not so much. I felt great knowing I had made a delicious healthy meal for my family. 

I rated these a 4 because of the changes that were strongly suggested by others. Perhaps I'll make a single batch next time exactly as written. I will definitely make these again.

This recipe was easy and delicious...and 100% whole wheat? What more can you ask for? Like what others in the reviews suggested, I added an extra quarter cup of non-fat milk. Other alternations included: 
1.) Honey instead of artificial sweetener 
2.) Added a splash of vanilla

These were excellent!!!  The only changes I made were:
I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 c unbleached bread flour with 2 c. whole wheat bread flour, used 1 T Splenda with 2 packets Stevia, and did use the extra 1/4 c of milk.  

With 1/3 c. scoops they were 107 calories per pancake and absolutely delicious!

I made these for brunch today and, I have to say, they were very good.  I have never made whole wheat pancakes before and was a little nervous, but these turned out light and fluffy and we liked them.  I made a few changes - I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of white flour with 1 1/2 cups whole wheat, 3 tbls of brown sugar instead of artificial sweetener (I'm a little wary of all the chemicals in artificial sweeteners), and 1% milk.  Served with butter and light syrup - quite tasty.  I also used an ungreased griddle to cook these.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was the texture.  It was a bit grainy and not what I prefer in a pancake.  But the health benefits outweigh the texture thing and I will make these again.  I think I'll make a blueberry compote to top these the next time and see if I can make them even healthier.  Thank you for this good recipe!

These were great!! Doubled the recipe and glad I did. I did add 1tsp. vanilla, an extra egg and about 3 tbsp of Splenda. These did take longer to cook through and the first one I pulled to early and it was still gooey in the middle. With a little spread of peanut butter my 3 year old ate 3 whole pancakes!! And I didn't even feel guilty because they were so good for him.

We use this recipe every weekend for our "Sunday Pancakes."  My kids LOVE them.  I use whole wheat pastry flour and eliminate the artificial sweetener.  I make them plain and top with fruit (blueberries, bananas, etc) and organic maple syrup.  Very yummy!  We love our Sunday breakfast tradition!

These were so dry as is!  I had to add nearly one extra cup of milk.  I also added cinnamon and vinalla for extra taste.  With those changes, they were pretty good, although still more cake-like than I am used to.  I am going to try a different recipe next time but may at some point come back to experimenting with this one.

This is the best  whole wheat pancake recipe I have found! In my experience, many recipes fell flat, literally. The first time I made them, I had to make a second batch to keep everyone happy! Then, I made a third batch to freeze so we could pop them in the toaster on weekday mornings. I did add an extra 1/4 cup or so of milk and I also like to add cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. Even when you omit the fruit, these end up being light, fluffy and have just enough sweetness to them. My self-proclaimed 'pancake expert' teenage daughter loved them with strawberry fruit puree! I

I really like this pancake recipe.  It's quick and easy.  I will try different fruit later.  I have put banana and it is great.  I only use 1/4 tsp of salt.  I had to add a little bit more milk, probably about 1/4 cup or a little bit less.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The batter was very thick, and as others have mentioned, I couldn't get the inside of the pancakes to cook without burning the outside.  They for sure taste healthier than most pancakes, not sure if that is a good or bad thing.  I'm glad I tried it, and they were pretty good, but not sure these are for me.  Thanks for sharing!

These are great, even without the blueberries! I added a bit more sugar -- used the large brown grain, less-processed variety. Subbed in 1/4 c white flour because my family prefers a smoother consistency. But I think next time we'll go straight whole-wheat healthiness! Thanks!

This was my first time making whole wheat pancakes. These were really delicious! I highly recommend this recipe; it's easy, not too many ingredients, the pancakes fluff up nicely, and it's a really great base for any kind of pancake (not just blueberry!). I gave this recipe 4 stars because they did come out a tad dense as wheat flour is wont to do. Not so much so that it really bothered me, but I think next time I am going to try adding in some wheat gluten to see if it makes a significant difference. Alterations: I used brown sugar instead of a substitute. I did end up using an extra 1/4 cup of milk. I also added cinnamon.

These were delicious and fluffy!  Wonderful texture.  My boyfriend usually complains when I try to make things healthier and use whole wheat flour.... but he loved these.  I used fresh strawberries because that's what I had on hand, and also I haven't yet sold the boyfriend on blueberries.  Baby steps :)

Doubled the recipe and made them with frozen wild blueberries (Costco), because that's what I had on hand.  Gotta say, they were okay, but I think some good fresh blueberries would make them WAY better.  They definitely are nice and thick, so if you like thinner or want to stretch them even more, add more milk.  I believe doubling it made about 18 pancakes.  I did also add some cinnamon (few dashes) and vanilla (1tsp), which I will definitely do again, and I used 3T. brown sugar for the sweetener...would probably even do 4T. next time.  Definitely a great recipe to play around with.  Fresh fruit is definitely the key though, in my opinion!

These were excellent!  I used frozen blueberries and my 6-year old son ate them up.  He didn't even notice they were whole wheat.  Will use this recipe as a base for many different kinds of pancakes.

I made them with blackberry instead...not that good.  They taste much better with the blueberries.  I added about 1/3 cup more of milk, it didn't taste the same than the time i did it with the milk it suggested.  All in all, very tasty!

Very good! My daughter said they felt like a pillow since they are so fluffy.  I added some vanilla and used 4 tbls of sugar.  Served them with some fresh macerated strawberries and the kids ate them up!  I'll be keeping this recipe.

This was a bad recipe. The batter was 'glue-like' and so thick that the pancakes burned before they had cooked all the way through. I added milk and then water several times but it didn't help much. I finally got one to cook through but it was sooo heavy, just not an appealing pancake to me. I like mine light and fluffy. I'm not sure if that's the way whole wheat pancakes are supposed to be, but if they are they're just not for me.

So good! Added 2 tablespoons of ground flax seed and a little water to even out the consistency. I also added a splash of vanilla. You don't need sugar if you're eating with syrup but I sprinkled in some brown sugar instead of the fake stuff. Next time I won't need it.

These were pretty good.  I added vanilla and cinnamon like a few other posts recommended.  I also used the Blue Agave and Egg Beaters like others mentioned.  My husband liked them, too - which is saying alot since he likes fat, sugar and salt in everything.

I made these this morning.  I found I did have to add a little more milk, plus I did add a dash of vanilla.  They were excellent! I made a double batch so we can heat them in the microwave for our breakfasts. My husband and I have been eating healthy, and I prefer to cook from scratch rather than using the mixes.  I asked him if he thought the recipe was "a keeper" and he said "definitely!"  Thank you for sharing this, as it is so hard to find recipes that are delicious AND healthy!

I loved it, hubby has aversions to whole-wheat anything...so it wasnt his favorite. I did add extra milk, and next time would add even more. I'd also add more blueberries. I used regular sugar instead of artificial sweetener. I thought the flavor was really good overall and it wasn't too grainy or earthy like some whole-wheat items can be.

This was an interesting reciepe.  I followed the directions exactly expect I used raspberries instead of blueberries ( no blueberries on hand).  My 2 year old picky eater did not eat it however it was an okay taste for me I used Organic Blue Agave as my sweetner.  The taste was just okay.

I love it!  I've used it many times now, i've made some changes  of course.  i used rice milk or water instead of milk(milk allergy). For the egg i used 2TBSP warm water 1TBSP oil and 2 tsp of baking powder. mix that in a small bowl then add to rest. For an egg sub. Blueberry tip: if you roll them in flour first, they won't make your mix purple. love it!

GREAT Recipe! The only changes I made was I used Almond Milk instead of milk because I don't drink milk and I used Agave Nectar instead of Artificial Sweetner...I also added a bit of vanilla extract! Mmm!

I made these with blackberries and the taste was worth four stars. It tasted good raw! However, I am giving it three stars because they stuck like crazy, even when the pan was doused in spray. They also cooked on the outside when I had it on med.-high, but were goey on the inside. Keep the heat on low-med. unless you feel you can kick it up a bit. They taste wonderful, but something needs to be done so they don't stick.

very yummy! They tasted great without an over whelming wheat flavor. Like some others I also added cinnamon(about 1tsp), a little vanilla(about 1/2 to 1tsp) and a little more milk. They came out great. If your making them for your family I would double the batch.  P.S. Don't forget to smile today!!!

these made big, thick, fluffy pancakes! I love that they are 100% w.wheat, so I don't have to fuss w/ oatmeal or wheat germ or whatnot. I made mine w/ peach slices and soy milk, and a dollop of pancake syrup for the sugar (which is a great trick for any pancake recipe). Burning them is totally my fault and not the recipe's, so 5stars strong! :D

So simple my 3 year old does most of the work! I substitute real sugar for the artificial and when I don't have blueberries I throw in a splash of vanilla. Just the absolute best recipe, and for me takes a minute or two more then the boxed kind. Can't beat that!

These were amazing I couldn't believe they were so healthy.  I doubled the recipe to make extra for freezing, but then realized I only had half a cup of blueberries.  I mashed up 2 very ripe bananas and a very ripe peach and added them in the way with the blueberries.  I used a tablespoon and a half of sugar in place of the artificial sweetener and dashed some cinnamon and these turned out amazing.. surprisingly thick and fluffy.. so delicious i'll definitely make these again

Excellent.  When I got blueberries on sale for $1, I knew what I wanted to make and found this wonderful recipe.  I added more milk, sugar substitute and vanilla as suggested.  Tried a few variations - added lemon zest to one and a bit of oatmeal to one - did not care for either.  Also added some pureed cottage cheese in place of some of the milk (in my effort to get enough protein in my diet) and that did not make much difference in the pancakes, a bit moister.  Thank you for posting this, it is the best no oil added pancake I have ever had!

Made these as "breakfast for dinner" and WOW!  I thought they would have a dense texture, but quite the contrary.  I doubled the recipe and used 3 eggs total and 2 1/2 cups milk.  It needed more liquid than the recipe called for.  I also crushed a few blueberries and blackberries and heated them with our maple syrup.  Son and husband gave it 5 stars.  Will be my new pancake standby.

Very good. Apparently I'm not cut out for pancakes, but these are easy and tasty, even if I burn them a bit. I think next time around I'll add a bit more milk to make them fluffier.

Wow! These are the best pancakes I've ever eaten, let alone cooked. I am really quite horrible at cooking pancakes, but I've made these pancakes twice now and they've turned out perfect and delicious. The blueberries litterally provide a POP of flavor each time you bite into it.

This recipe is AWESOME!  Best pancakes I've ever made!  Usually I find whole wheat pancakes too dry, but these turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly, but added the suggested extra 1/4 cup of milk.  I also added some cinnamon, vanilla, and cloves, as suggested by other reviewers.  Yummy!  My new favorite pancake recipe!  :)

Best pancake recipe.  I soaked the flour overnight with water(instead of milk) and 2 TBSP of whey) Then added the remaining ingredience (baking soda last) in the morning when I made the pancakes. I LOVE that the recipe reminds you to add liquid to get the right consistancy. I am terrible about just following the recipe and wondering why the pancakes were so hard.  My kids gobbled these up even without syrup and jelly.

This recipe is perfect and is the only one we use now.  Instead of artificial sweetener, we use honey, and sometimes we leave out the blueberries depending on what the kids are in the mood for.  I have no complaints and no suggestions for improvement.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

These are great.  The best part is not needing buttermilk.  I rarely have that around unless I buy it special for baking.  I will definitely make these again and use any fruit I have around.  They would probably be great without fruit too.

One of the best whole wheat pancake recipes ever! Because I used 1/2c flour & 3/4c whole wheat, I added 1/3c ground flaxseed. Also, as another reader suggested, I added cinnamon and vanilla. The extra 2Tbs milk made the batter perfect for us. I didn't have blueberries on hand, but it was still delish!

Very good pancake recipe. Like others, I substituted 3 Tbsp. brown sugar for the artificial sweetener. The kids loved. Mine made about 16 and kids each ate 2 (3 yo and 5 yo). Will try bananas another time. I added vanilla, wheat germ, and flax seed. Love it that it's healthy and tasty.

Really yummy!  These were light and fluffy and loved by all.  I did double the recipe because we have a big family.  I also added a cinnamon blend,  vanilla and did need to add some additional milk as others suggested. Its a keeper.

These were fantastic! I added a 1 and 1/2 t of white vinegar to 1 and 1/4 c milk and set it aside while I mixed dry ingredients. This seems to make them lighter/fluffier. Also added 1/2 t vanilla and 1 t lemon peel, subbed 3T egg whites for egg and doubled blueberries. Stevia was my artificial sweetener. My recipe made 6 pancakes - ate 2 and will individually wrap and freeze others for later. Thanks for great recipe!

Lovely breakfast treat! I stayed pretty true to the recipe although I did add 1 tsp. brown sugar and once batter was mixed I divided it into two bowl, adding 1/4 c thawed frozen blueberries to one and fresh sliced strawberries/choc.chips to the other. They were delicious! Thanks for the healthier pancake recipe. :-D

Not bad.  I've never tried a whole wheat pancake but was specifically looking for one.  My husband said he couldn't tell the difference.  I used double the amount of blueberries because I had them frozen in one cup baggies.

This pancake was light & fluffy. I loved it. I followed the recipe exactly with only one minor exchange, I used Splenda Brown Sugar mix in place of the regular artificial sweetener. I think the brown sugar added a rich flavor. I also made extra to heat up in the microwave the following morning. This is a great recipe for those following the South Beach Diet.

These were not good. They tasted like flavorless bread, not pancakes. I even put chocolate chips in them, which made them slightly better.

I used fresh nectarines in this instead of blueberries, it was so good!  I used 1 tbsp brown sugar instead of the sugar substitute, and a little bit more milk.  It was really delicious.

pretty good.  I used whole wheat flour, and honey in place of the sweetener (needed about 3 or 4 TBS).  Nice and wholesome.  Didn't have the blueberries but the recipe was still great.

The pancakes were awesome.  I mixer beated the eggs with sugar, then added 1 1/8 cp milk, salt and baking soda + wheat flour.  I replaced the blueberries with kiwi, cuz I didn't have any.  And I also replaced a quarter cup of wheat flour with almond flour cuz I thought all wheat flour might've been too heavy.  But I really need not have worried.  The pancakes were light, airy, and delectable.  It's definitely better and healthier than any pancake mix batter.

I was very surprised at how good this recipe is. My diabetic 3-year-old wanted something "different" for breakfast. I suggested pancakes and she jumped for joy. I quickly found this recipe and tried it. I followed the recipe and it turned out great. Good texture and just sweet enough. Very easy to make. 1/4 cup is too much for one pancake - for us. I recalculated the carb count and found that it's approx. 9 grams of carbs per pancake and it made approx. 15 pancakes. Important info for the diabetics out there.

I substituted a mashed banana for the blueberries as I didn't have any on hand. Both my 18 month old daughter and my husband found these to be very good. Eliza ate two of the 14 pancakes made in this recipe. However, I would say that with the moist banana, they are not  as light and fluffy as they would be with blueberries. They were a little heavier, but we didn't mind. I debated just slicing the bananas and placing on top. That may have made them more like the blueberry version. Try it! Healthful and tasty.

these were great.  I searched a recipe b/c my daughter wanted pancakes and I didn't have mix left.  I did use more than 1 cup on the milk and I detest art. sweetner, so I added 2 TBS of sugar and could have easily gotten away with just 1 TBS.  I will definitely make these again - they are healthy :)  thanks!!!!

I made this as a healthy breakfast for my very picky 6 year old who will refuse to eat anything that seems to be remotely good for him.  I used a tablespoon of splenda in the mix. My son ate two whole pancakes and kept saying how much better these are than the one's mommy makes from the red box (Aunt Jemima).  This will definately become a Saturday morning ritual at our house.  Thanks so much for sharing!

these were very good; a bit on the heavy side but I don't mind that at all.  I used eggbeaters in place of egg, and in lieu of milk I used f.f. yogurt that I needed to use up and the water to the consistency that I like.  Used butter spray and some honey on top.  Nice fat free recipe and a great way to get the fiber and those high antioxidants that come in blueberries!

It definitely needs more milk than called for, 1 1/2 cups. We added pecans and did not use butter in the pan.

I added cinnamon, nutmeg, a squeeze of lemon, Mexican vanilla, and about one tablespoon of melted butter, they were so moist and tender, just delicious!   I a served them with sliced strawberries and whipped cream yum.

My kids love these pancakes and don’t care that they are made with whole wheat flour. I add 1/2 of semi-sweet chocolate chips for a touch of delicious chocolate gooeyness. Delicious!

These pancakes were delicious, easy to make, and so good for you! I substituted almond milk for the soy milk. my wife my son and myself all enjoyed breakfast this morning so much. They had just pancakes and I added eggs with mine. Couldn't be happier!

I make these all the time for me and my baby! I use agave for the sweetener and only 1 cup flour because I prefer the thinner pancakes. I use almond milk to combat that tree nut allergy. So happy I found this recipe. Thank you!

I'm on a low-sodium, low fat diet.  For a single serving, I cut the recipe in half (3/4 c. whole wheat flour, 1 tsp. baking powder) used  1 1/2 Tsp. Egg Beaters, left out the salt and sugar, but added extra blueberries, and a little cinnamon.  The batter was thick for pancakes, so I used a little waffle iron.  With jelly or maple syrup to sweeten them, they were delicious and heart-healthy.  Thanks!

This recipe just didn't do it for us, they are really dense even with adding a little more milk and an extra 1/4 of blue berries. You really need the fruit in them to help balance out the flavors and texture, with out the fruit they would be really heavy.

Very good.  Doubled recipe and substituted 1/2 cup flour for oat bran and added some ground flax.  Used almond milk, changes colour but kids didn’t care.  Didn’t need sugar substitute, I find syrup always sweet enough.

A bit dry and not sweet  or fluffy enough. Perhaps buttermilk or white vinegar with milk is what's missing here?

I'm not sure what i did wrong but even after adding lots of extra milk, the pancakes were still too thick and they would not spread or cook all the way through. They also had a rather bitter taste. I really like the idea but this recipe just didn't work out for me.

So good! I have to say, not sure why the need for artificial sweeteners...I just used brown sugar. Also used coconut milk and frozen blueberries. This is my new pancake staple!

I didn't use any sweetener at all and used frozen blueberries (but they were thawed overnight). I added frozen (thawed) strawberries and additional blueberries and cinnamon as topping. They turned out amazing! Next time I will add some pure vanilla extract and some cinnamon in the batter and will update my review once I've tried it.

I made these and I thought they were very good. I used a T of brown sugar and added all the dry ingredients together and it still turned out well. I cooked them on a skillet at 350 degrees and the texture and consistency was spot on. Just adjust the thickness of the batter with more or less milk.

Taste reminds me of frontier Johnny Cakes. But there's no structure, the pancakes fall apart. I'd rather use my regular pancake recipe, replace half the flour with whole wheat flour and get a better result.

I added additional 1/4cup milk,  1 tsp vanilla, 2 tbsp veg. Oil and 1 Tbsp  sugar rather than artificial sweetener.  They are wonderful.  Now I always keep a batch in freezer so I can eat during the week for breakfast.   Great recipe whether you have blueberries on hand or not.   Wonderful either way. .

Well, we made it as written and wasn't that impressed.  Just another pancake.  Think you'd do as well or better taking Aunt Jemima's Whole Wheat Pancake mix and adding your blueberries.  May play around with this next time, should we be out of mix.

I usually buy pancake mis and did my own spices to it. This is the first time making pancakes from scratch. The blueberry pancakes turned out awesome! They were so so good.

Yum! We thought these were great and not dry at all. I doubled the recipe and made 15 pancakes from the batter. Instead of sifting the flour I just whisked it with the baking soda, which I subbed for the baking powder by accident. I subbed coconut sugar for the sweetener and added the zest of two lemons to the dry ingredients before combining with the wet. Will make again! Thanks for posting!

I was surprised to find artificial sweetener as an ingredient...how about agave nectar or maple syrup or another type of natural sweetener?
 there a plenty out there that don't cause cancer.

VERY GOOD  These seem very light. We liked the slight whole wheat flour taste, but could go 1/2 and 1/2 next time. I needed
the extra milk. They do not have a heavy dough feeling.
Make again.

Simple recipe using moistness of blueberries instead of oil. I used whole wheat pastry flour, and added more bluberries and vanilla extract for flavor. Made 6 medium size pancakes.

I'm vegan so I substituted the egg with flaxseed & water (look online and see how many teaspoons of flaxseed & water per egg), and I used vanilla almond milk,  no artificial sweetener,( because it's not good for you) I used organic vegan sugar, no salt, and only a half teaspoon of baking powder.  And it tasted awesome! And they were nice & fluffy!!

I just discovered hazelnut flour so I substituted half of the whole wheat flour with that and got a whole new level of flavor/protein/nuttiness.  I never use sugar substitute as I am not diabetic and do not like to use artificial/chemical anything, and am thinking that is why one of the reviewers got a kind of bitter flavor.

This recipe was pretty good, although I can't say that I adhered to the "healthy" part of it, just the "it tastes wildly good" part.
I did add flax seed like so many reviewers on here mentioned. After that, it was our way......we have a ton of blueberries that I froze this summer (we live in Maine), we also have maple trees that our neighbor "sugars" for us, so fresh maple syrup is always on hand in this house.  I have made this a few times now and as the recipes  goes it's usually too heavy, so I thin it out with a big splash of buttermilk gently stirred in.   I never add sugar because our berries are very sweet and of course so is the syrup.  We always make these on an electric griddle and my husband does the honors, he does not use oil or anything else but unsalted butter, so the crispy edges of the pancakes are sheer heaven!  This is a great recipe but the photos are awful, I can't imagine why they used old berries for the photoshoot and no syrup, so the pancakes look dried out and unattractive, as a matter of fact so uninteresting it's a wonder anyone tried it! But, I'm glad they did because it drew me in. :-)

Wow. Best pancakes i have every made. I usually do not make pancakes because they never turn out . These were perfect. Thick,soft cooked perfect on a cast iron skillet on med  /low heat.
I used Spelt and Oat flour,Almond milk,blueberries. A touch of vanilla. Healthy pancakes anyone would eat. 
Will keep this recipe . 
PS. Alea Walt I think you misread the recipe . It is baking powder not baking soda. Might be why it would taste so soapy. That is a lot of soda. 2 tsp.

Okay, this is the first time I have made pancakes that are SO fluffy- but the reason I gave it four stars is that I altered much of the ingredients, which I feel are part responsible for the newfound success: with using normal whole wheat flour,  I took out two table spoons and replaced with cornstarch (like cake flour). Then I tripled the amount of baking powder and added lemon extract which reacts well with baking powder. Furthermore, some reviews complain of the dryness so I added one extra egg, two tablespoons of oil, and a tiny bit of extra milk. :) When I put it on the pan, the batter was so thin it spread like a crepe, but then thirty seconds in, the batter suddenly grew upward.  Thanks!

I tripled this recipe, and put the blueberries on top while cooking the first side and put 1 teaspoon off allspice, cinnamon, and 1/2 a teaspoon of ginger in the batter. [that being the tripled recipe...cut down for single recipes.] A little bit thick even with the added milk, so they were 1/2 an inch thick :P

These were OK. Easy recipe but I thought they were pretty bland.  Next time I'll double the amount of blueberries and sweetener (I used brown sugar since I don't eat artificial sweetener).

These were perfect!! I love making healthy food with whole wheat flour etc, but my husband is still getting used to it. So for the first time I made this I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, in order for him to adjust to whole wheat easier. I also added a tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  My husband and I loved them and will definitely make again, working up to using all whole wheat flour. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made the recipe as presented and the batter turned out a bit thick. Will try it again next time with a little more milk. Also might have been due to a slightly small egg (we have chickens, so we use our own fresh eggs). Otherwise the flavor was great!

These are great!  The only thing I would change is add cinnamon.  Pancakes and waffles aren't the same without CINNAMON!  I do not mix in blueberries, but chocolate chips, walnuts, and coconut instead.  Fantastic!  They are SO FLUFFY!  And the kids gobbled them up!  I always double the recipe and freeze the leftovers.

I tried the recipe with 70% whole wheat flourand added about 3 tablespoons of milk. 
I used organic cane sugar and a tablespoon of coconut oil. 
The  pancakes came out tasty, especially with the addition of maple syrup though. I found them to be a little thick and heavy.

I took note of other reviewers' comments regarding the dry texture. I added 2 T of apple sauce and think that helped. I may add another T next time. Also used honey instead of artificial sweetener. 

Turned out all right!

I was really surprised at how well these pancakes turned out. We have recently started eating more healthy, so I wanted to try out these whole wheat panckaes. The blueberries added the sweet flavor we like, and the pancakes were so filling that we only needed two a piece, except fory husband ;) I did have to add more milk, and next time I think I might add a banana to the mix, just to make them a little more moist. I will definitely make these again, the kids loved them!

I loved these! Very easy. I did not need any extra milk to get the batter to the right consistency. I ended up with four really big pancakes (probably 1/3 to 1/2 cup of batter each), but you would get more if you made regular size pancakes. These are fairly heavy and dense, but I like that and expect it from a whole-wheat pancake. I used blackberries instead of blueberries, and added a little cinnamon. Once I added the batter to the pan, I sprinkled pecans on top so they baked into each pancake and toasted a little once I flipped them. I also added a little wheat germ to the last half of the batter, which added a nice chewy texture. Will definitely make these again!

These low calorie blueberry pancakes were fantastic!  I didn't taste the stevia.  They were nice and thick and crunchy along the edges using olive oil.  My blueberries were fresh from chili.  With some GMO heart healthy butter and lite on the syrup, they tasted like Cracker Barrel blueberry pancakes with out all the fat and calories.  This one is a keeper!

I guess I'm not as crazy about cooked blueberries as I am about uncooked blueberries.  My son is a blueberry fanatic, so I made these for him, but he wouldn't touch them either :/.  After I drowned mine in syrup, I was able to eat them, but still wasn't a "to-die-for" dish.  Not giving a lower star, because I do feel like I have very "boring" tastebuds and this could be quite delicious for some. I think if I were to ever make these again, I would add the blueberries at the end before I flip the cakes so they don't cook as long, leaving the bitter taste.

I didn't care for these pancakes at all. I used Kroger brand whole wheat flour and subbed agave nectar for artificial sweetener; perhaps those changes affected them.

Delicious and perfect for a sweet, healthy pancake breakfast. For the tablespoon of sweetener, I used 100% pure honey. I sprinkled with some powdered sugar and fresh blueberries, and served with butter and maple syrup. I will definitely make these again and try different fruit substitutions, like banana and walnuts, and strawberries.

I used Blue Diamond Unsweet vanilla almond milk and had to use about 2 1/2 to 3 Tbsp more of milk. I just guessed until the batter was a little thinner. The blueberries were so sweet. I put a little butter on them and ate them hot. So delicious! I will be making these more often, especially with eating every two to three hours!

Thanks for such an easy recipe, exactly what I was looking for. I did use sweetened almond milk plus an extra 1/2 c to make them thinner. Overall a winner just the way it was, thanks.

I really like how low calorie these, as compared to regular or box mix pancakes.  So far, I've made them a few ways, and like it most with various fruits, cinnamon and vanilla.  As is, without any fruits, the pancakes are very plain tasting and haven't gone over well with my family.  Hence, if I'm making these without fruit, I do add some cinnamon and vanilla.  Really adds to the flavor, and not much to the calorie count.

This recipe rocks!  I used it in my kindergarten classroom during baking week.  We also made fresh butter out of heavy whipping cream.  We had about 1/2 cup of buttermilk so I used the buttermilk and then finished off the recipe with 1% milk.  I did not use artificial sweetener, but 4 domino packets.  I'm sure we added extra blueberries!  The kids had a blast, worked hard and sanitary(!) and enjoyed every last crumb!  I will definitely keep this recipe on hand for when we earn  class reward!

It's an okay good but, pretty nice for ww pancakes. I added about 1/4 cup of oil and a packet of maple brown oatmeal. I let it sit for about ten minutes and cooked it on med low (as another reviewer suggested). It was a thick batter, i had to spoon onto the pan but came out nice and fluffy. Will use this recipe again.

I tried them this morning and they turned out delicious!! They are just perfect for a healthy and balanced diet and due to the natural sweetness of the berries you won't need any additional spread. Furthermore the preperation doesn't take much time and therefore the recipe can be used for every day.
I'm really looking forward to making these pancakes again which I'm definitely going to do very soon.

These tasted great, fluffy, I added about a cup of blueberries instead of half a cup because I prefer more fruit and i think pancakes would've been a bit dry with just half a cup. Also substituted real sugar for the artificial sweetener since that's all I had.

Just okay. Used regular sugar and about 1/4 cup more milk. Not bad, just hoping for a really good whole wheat pancake recipe so will keep looking...

These had a really yummy flavor with the 1 1/2 Tb brown sugar instead of fake sweetener and a teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon. David and I didn't like the blueberries in it. Using the 1 1/4 cup of milk gave it a good consistency. 2/3 cup filled the waffle iron.

I used raw organic honey in place of artificial sweetener because I care about my health. Since the amount was small, I used a 1:1 ratio substitution. I even ended up having to use more milk like they suggested, despite the extra liquid from the honey. They turned out delicious! Good flavor, fluffy, and moist. I'd definitely make them again!

Perfect! I always add more eggs because it makes it more nutritious and I whip the whites to make them fluffier. Tastes like a blueberry muffin.

Tasty pancakes! Would have been a 5 star but, unfortunately, even with doubling the recipe it didn't feed 6 people, 2 adults and 4 kids. 
Also artificial sweetener we changed to real maple syrup, as a natural sweetener is way better than a cancer causing artificial sweetener. We had to reduce the liquid to accommodate but it is well worth it, for health reasons as well as for taste reasons.

This recipe is really good.I had to add more milk I like it because it is good for you and you can add anything that you instead of the blueberries you can add chocolate chips.

We have made this our Saturday breakfast staple since finding this recipe.  I have had to double this recipe for my family of 5, my husband and kids like them so much.  I did double the blueberries and have needed to add the extra 1/4 cup of milk every time. I use a white whole wheat flour (king Arthur flour) and regular granulated sugar instead of artificial sweetener since I never have the artificial stuff on hand. On another note, if you use frozen blueberries, it cooks better if you thaw and drain them before putting them in the batter.

Very simple recipe and it turned out great! I was out of eggs so I substituted 1/4 cup of applesauce which made my batter thicker I think so I had to add a bit more milk but they still came out really good. The only thing I would change is maybe add a little vanilla and more blueberries to the batter.

Magnificent! These were fluffy and light with a beautiful texture. I used1 &1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk and added a half tsp.of cinnamon. I added the blueberries to the pancake batter AFTER they were in the pan by pressing them into each pancake as chefs do. This allowed for even distribution and the berries really taste great from being in direct contact with the heat. This is a keeper!

If your interest is a low cal healthy pancake this is a good recipe, but they are a little dry and not extremely flavorful.  Not surprising since they have no oil.  Not bad, but not great.

I use this recipe only when we have pancakes, just do not over mix, and you need a bit more milk.  So, instead of the sugar I put a big squeeze of honey in mine.

I make pancakes weekly and wanted to try out a new recipe. I changed the serving size to two, and this recipe did not turn out.  Even after adding more milk and some cinnamon for flavor, these pancakes turned out thick and tasteless. Will not make them again.

Lovely with a little more milk. I used Vanilla Almond Milk instead of milk and sugar free raspberry preserves instead of blueberries and artificial sweetener :) I'd say 1/4 teaspoon of salt is sufficient. The salty taste stuck out a little too much

This is the best pancake recipe, hands down. It's a bonus that it's healthy, with whole wheat. I make these every Sunday, with a few tweaks. I replace the sweetener with sugar, and double the blueberries. I sometimes add minced lemon verbena. This recipe works well with other fruit, too. I love it with apples. The pancakes are really thick and moist, and truly don't need butter or syrup. We prefer them with extra fruit on top. Thanks to the author for sharing!

We really liked these...no more boxed mixes and frozen blueberries for us!  I did add about 1/8 cup more milk and I used real sugar because we don't go for the "sweeteners"....My 12 year old loved them as did my husband and I.  We did not even have to add butter, we just used a little vermont maple syrup

This was a tasty, SUPER easy recipe for super healthy, diet friendly pancakes! They were so easy to make, and tasted great! The blueberries definitely give these another flavor dimension that is perfect. I did have to add a bit more milk, but I didn't measure it - I'd say less than 1/4 cup extra. Also, used Splenda and it worked great.

I paired with sugar free syrup and turkey bacon for a healthy breakfast! Definitely will make these again!

DELICIOUS! i halved the recipe, used white flour (because i didn't have whole wheat on hand) , added chopped bananas, and used cane sugar. i loved it. since i cut the blueberries in half, the juices squeezed out and the batter turned a lovely pale purple. super nice.

Yum!  I used brown sugar instead of artificial sweetener (chemicals: yuck), and dropped the blueberries into the pancakes after I poured them, because I find that easier.  Great way to make healthier pancakes!

They were dry and dull and not fluffy at all- even though I had bananas and blueberries in the mix. I'll go back to my own recipe.

These are great! I used whole milk because I was making them for my one year old and they didn't turn out thin or runny at all. I also substituted the artificial sweetener with a little over a tablespoon of brown sugar. Great Sunday morning breakfast!

Made these this morning as part of my 1200 calories diet menu. They were great! I added a half serving of walnuts 2/6 of a cup and served them each with half a sliced banana and sugar free syrub.

I can't for the life of me figure out how this recipe got 5 stars from so many people.  These were the worst pancakes I've ever had (and I'm a healthy eater who normally loves whole wheat recipes).  I added the extra milk, but the batter was still way too thick, and the pancakes came out incredibly dense and chewy.  We ate two of them and then threw away the rest.  I won't be making them again.

The only reason this recipe can taste strange or a little bitter is because of the baking powder.  Most people still don't know that you should use Rumford or any brand that is Aluminum Free.  You will be AMAZED at the difference!

These were the best I have ever tried.  Even though we have been programmed not to mess with something that does not need fixing, I did just that, as I am always looking to cut down on the carbs as a general rule for my high protein diet.  To my surprise, they were just as fantastic as the original recipe with a lot less carbs.

Fantastic!  Easiest/Healthiest/Tastiest pancake recipe I've tried.  I substituted almond milk for the regular milk, and the taste and consistency was great.  Added a little cinnamon, more blueberries.  Topped it with a sprinkling of  sunflower seeds and slivered almonds.  This was even a big hit with my husband who is typically not so inclined to the whole-wheat/healthy genre of food. :)

Very nice, simple recipe that turned out delicious. Like reviewer "mattalan" I went all organic with the ingredients, using cane sugar instead of artificial sweetener (in fact that's why I withheld 5 stars; why artificial sweetener? Seemed incongruous to me).  I used frozen berries; just plunked them, still frozen, in the batter.

Very good pancakes.  A tad thick, so next time I'd add a bit more milk.  However, easy enough to whip up in the morning, and tastes good with fruit, peanut butter or syrup.  Thanks for the recipe!

Consider this a review from an unhealthy eater:

This recipe was "fine" for us. The kids scarfed them down, my husband and I *chose* to eat them. :)  Maybe if I was accustomed to eating healthy I would have thought differently about them but to me they were very "wheaty".  I substituted white flour for 1/2 cup of the flour to help make the leap to whole wheat pancakes a little easier.  

I'll probably make this again so that I can feel good about feeding my family whole wheat pancakes but I'd be lying if I said I was ecstatic to eat them myself.

This recipe is also fabulous using 3 very ripe mashed bananas instead of the berries.  I omitted the sweetener (the bananas were very ripe), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Turned out better than I expected.  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! I wanted to make pancakes and just happened to have whole wheat flour and blueberries at my boyfriend's house. I followed other users' advice and used 3 tablespoons light brown sugar instead of artificial sweetener and also added 1 tbs cinnamon and about a teaspoon of vanilla extract. We didn't have syrup so I used organic blue agave sweetener on top and it was yummy!

Only okay because I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh and they cooked a bit funny. Nothing particularly special about them, but a good whole wheat recipe.

I thought this was a great recipe!
It def needs WAY more milk, but it is really good. A bit dry though too. I used brown sugar instead of white can sugar. I didn't use the salt I was supossed to use, but it still came out great.

Yum!  I used 1c. whole wheat + 1/4 c unbleached white flour, 1 1/4 c lowfat buttermilk, 1 packet splenda and put thinly sliced bananas in some and blueberries in other.  LOVE that these don't contain fat since I like to put butter on top of pancakes and don't need it in both places.

Pretty good pancakes.  A bit dry, but that's to be expected with the whole wheat flour.  I added some cinnamon and vanilla (after reading another user had)which I thought really brought some flavor to the table.  I ate the pancakes with sugar free syrup, and.. ehh, it wasn't the best.  I'm sure I would have given this recipe five stars if I had some regular syrup on hand.  But then again, that's a boat load of sugar, reversing the recipe's healthy-ness!

These were pretty good. Even with the extra 1/4 cup of milk they were still very thick! I probably added at least another 1/4c more and still weren't that thin. Other than that I'd probably try this recipe with bananas and walnuts next time instead of blueberrys but this was a good recipe to start with. Thanks

I absolutely love this recipe. I have tried with and without modifications, and both ways are fantastic.

Modified, this is what I do: use 3/4 c. whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. all purpose.  Instead of artificial sweetener, I use 1 tbsp. brown sugar. In addition to the other ingredients, I include 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and 1/4 c. finely chopped strawberries and 1 mushed up banana. 

My whole family loves it!

An excellent recipe that is quick and easy!  I used whole wheat pastry flour to make the pancakes more tender.

I love this recipe!  The only thing I do differently is I use sugar and I double it. I also put the sugar in the blueberries and stick it in the microwave for 1 minute, it makes the blueberries soft and sweet.  I always have to double it to make enough for my family.

This is a great recipe!  I used whole wheat pastry flour, almond milk/crushed pineapple for liquid combo, cinnamon, vanilla, choc chips and Stevia and the boyfriend and I ate these w/o any syrup at all (although powdered sugar would've been great on top).  They have a great flavor and you can put anything you want in them (I just happened to have extra pineapple in the fridge and it worked perfectly).  So easy to make, definite winner!!!

I made these this morning. YUMMY! I put a little wheat germ in it and used egg whites instead of a whole egg. Added alot more blueberries ( I adore them) I also used the tips on this site. I beat the egg whites till stiff then mix it in with the batter and put the batter in the fridge for 3 hours...end result: light fluffy on the inside crispy outside just how I like it!

These pancakes are SO good! I wanted to make whole wheat pancakes that my kids would love. These did the trick. In fact, they said they were the best ever. You do need a little bit more milk. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, 2 tsp. brown sugar instead of artificial sweetner, and 2 mashed ripe bananas. SO GOOD!

I made these this morning and they were wonderful!!  I used real sugar instead of a substitute and I added about 1/4 cup flax to mine and probably a bit more blueberries and everyone loved them!  I made a second batch because I didn't think the first one would be enough but they were so filling so now I have leftovers!

I really enjoyed these.  They are very heavy/dense pancakes because of the whole wheat, but I enjoyed them.  I left out the artificial sweetener and didn't miss it.

This recipe was absolutely awesome! I kind of expected a very bland cardboard-ish taste but they were perfect. I just added a pinch of vanilla powder and cooked them in oil since I don't have any cooking spray. Everybody loved them!

I've been using this recipe for a few years now and today I made a break through with this recipe. For light and fluffy pancakes, double the baking powder and replace 1/3 of the milk with sour cream.

I honestly don't know why people gave this a five star rating.  I followed the directions perfectly and found the pancakes to be too dry and too gritty due to the wheat flour.

I've been looking for a while for a pancake recipe that didn't use any white flour, and finally found one here.  When I made this I changed a few things: (a) 1% milk, (b) walnuts instead of blueberries, (c) 1.5 TBSP Sugar instead of Artificial Sweetener.  They came out amazing.  Some of the best, creamiest pancakes I've had in a while.. and healthier than probably ANY i've ever had.  Thanks!

Hands down, the best 100% whole wheat pancakes we've ever made.  I loved the texture and how moist they were. Filled my husband right up! He can usually eat 4-5 of the other pancakes. 2 from this recipe had him FULL.

Surprisingly fluffy, these were a great Sunday morning breakfast.  I followed the recipe "exactly" (frozen blueberries instead of fresh, cane sugar instead of artificial sweetener), and the pancakes came out moist, fluffy and delicious.  I guess I also added 3 tablespoons of crushed almonds to the batter to give it a bit of a crunch, but really, this recipe needs no alterations.

These are so good you would never know that they are actually healthy for you.  I did add half of a mashed banana and cinnamon and nutmeg to give it some umph.  I used Kirkland Signature Egg Starts instead of real eggs and it lowered the calories even more on this healthy breakfast.

The healthiest, tastiest pancakes I've ever had. There's literally nothing unhealthy about these pancakes (used egg whites, came out great). A well balanced breakfast! Actually the syrup used was the unhealthiest part, but I think I'll add more artificial sweetener next time because they were almost sweet enough without it this time!

These pancakes were delicious. I didn't have any artificial sweetener but I didn't want to use it anyway. I followed another user and added 3 T of white granulated sugar. Also, I added 2 egg whites instead of the whole egg. The were super moist and I don't know why people had a problem with them being dry. I hope I will be able to make these again with another type of fruit, maybe mashed bananas and walnuts :)

These were great. My son had been asking me for chocolate chip pancakes and I saw this recipe as recipe of the day, but I changed it a bit to suit what I had in the house.     I substituted 1/4 C of flour with 1/4 C ground flax seed and used 1 TBS of agave nectar instead. I didn't have chocolate chips, so I cut up leftover halloween candy... 5 little nestle crunch bars. My son loved them and didn't even use syrup. I can't wait to try them with blueberries or cinnamon apple. I did need an extra 1/4 cup of milk.  Thanks.

These weren't anything special, I could have easily grabbed any cookbook, looked up pancakes and substituted wheat flour and added blueberries and it would have been the same or better. Though I know you can only do so many variations on pancakes.

Great recipe! I made regular pancakes instead of blueberry, and added an extra Tbs sugar, a splash of vanilla, and a healthy dash of cinnamon. As the recipe notes, I used extra milk (about 1/4 c.) to thin the batter a bit. Will definitely make these again!

Yum! This is so easy but so tasty!  I halved the sugar and added a dash of cinnamon, brown sugar, vanilla, and mini chocolate chips. It was heavenly!

I can't believe these are healthy! They are so good! The only thing I did differently is instead of a whole egg, I just did egg white. Came out light & fluffy & yummy!

Great pancakes! My little one loved these fluffy pancakes. I don't like to use artificial sweetener, but instead added 1 tbsp. of brown sugar. Perfect!

I have never reviewed a recipe before but these pancakes are amazing! I used an egg substitute, a little more milk and a lot more blueberries and my family loved them.  Thanks for a pancake recipe that I can feel good about serving my family.

We have been allrecipes fans for years but this is the first time we have written a review because my young kids just love these pancakes. We love the texture and flavor and they are absolutely perfect with real maple syrup!

I love this recipe because not only is it so yummy, its also really healthy. Whole wheat and no oil or fat? amazing. The only alteration I did was that I used vanilla rice drink (you could do plain and then add vanilla extract) instead of milk. After making these my boyfriend liked them so much that I made it easy for him by making it a easy mix. To do so you can triple all the dry ingredients and put in an air tight container. Put directions on the container, 1 1/2 cup mix to one egg and 1 1/4 rice milk.  yummy!

So far the best recipe I have found yet. Most of the recipes I found were very tastless. This is sweet and yummy! Just a little to thick so I am going to add a little more milk next time.

I needed to add a lot more milk than called for because the batter was way too thick. I wasn't wild about these at first, but I froze the leftovers and had them a few weeks later and really enjoyed them.

This recipe was excellent.  I had to try it twice before I mastered it.  I too used more milk(2 cups) and added vanilla and a couple more packages of splenda.  I really am impressed with this recipe.  Our family is taking white flour out of diet;  so this was excellent.  Thanks to all

Fantastic! I made this recipe because we ran out of Bizquick, and I'll definitely make it every time. It's just as fast and you can't really notice the wheat flour texture. Instead of artificial sweetener I added sugar mixed with a pinch of cinnamon; everything else I left the same.

My kids thought these were great.  While the pancakes still in the pan I take a stick of butter and lightly rub it over each pancake then sprinkle a cinnamon/sugar combo over them.  I don't add anymore butter than that.  Cut them into fun shapes with cookie cutter and lightly drizzle with light syrup.

Fabulous recipe! I just made a double batch and they are gone. My son thought they were better than Ihop; my DH and I thought they were much like a fruit cobbler. Too good for just breakfast. We are all watching what we eat and trying to cook healthy. I served them with Agavea Nectar instead of syrup which was very good. Hoping to try peaches instead of blueberries next time!

These were very good however a little on the heavy side, but I think that I should have added maybe two cups milk instead of one and a half. Was able to make 3 big pancakes out of the recipe and ate almost every bite. They were even better with real maple syrup. Thanks for a great recipe!

SO AMAZING! I didn't change anything - except replaced artificial sweetener with applesauce b/c i'm an all-natural girl. I used white whole wheat flour - milder taste, same nutrition. THey didn't taste like typical dense, healthy pancakes - they were fluffy and light like regular pancakes! So delicious. Will make these every weekend!

These pancakes were great ... great consistency and taste.  I used egg beaters instead of eggs and added a little honey to the batter.  This is, by far, the best whole wheat pancake recipe I have found.

Great base recipe. Made a lot of modifications to my liking: doubled the batch, halved the (brown) sugar, instead of blueberries added golden raisins, a mashed banana, applesauce, walnuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, more milk and flax seed. Served with organic yogurt. Delicious!

These were very good. I added about 1/4 cup of milk as well as 1tsp of van. extract and 1T of lemon juice. These are very tasty with fresh blueberries, but I liked them even more with sliced strawberries. Great flavor and very filling!

I made these pancakes for breakfast yesterday; at first, the batter seemed really runny, and the first pancake was a flop. I added a little bit of extra flour, and then the pancakes were perfect! They don't really have a fluffy texture, but for a whole wheat pancake, they were very tasty! I did substitute brown sugar for the splenda, because I don't usually have that in the house. Next time I make these, I think I will sprinkle the blueberries on top of the batter circles instead of stirring them in, so that my batter won't turn blue. Thanks for sharing; I will make these again!

I will never be making pancakes from a box again! What a lovely recipe. The only change I made was using brown sugar instead of the sugar substitute.

Delicious! I didn't have any blueberries, so I just put some chunky strawberry jam and powdered sugar on top.  My 2 year old loved them!

this was good - not to die for, but a  good breakfast to start the day. i doubled the recipe and added 1 more egg. took the advice of others and added 1/4 cup more milk (2%). mashed 3 bananas and added it to the batter because i didn't have blueberries. also added about 1 tbsp. pure vanilla and an extra tbsp. of splenda.

For a recipe that used only whole wheat flour, it was great. I didn't have milk, so I used 1 1/4 cup buttermilk, the Saco Brand powder+water version. I substitute frozen strawberries (chopped) b/c I didn't have blueberries and used 2 tablespoons of sugar. It was delicious and I'd make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

We made these pancakes and they didn't work out right at all. Our whole wheat flour was too large to sift, and the texture of straight whole wheat flour just isn't very good. We wouldn't make these again - they were pretty hard to eat.

Bland pancakes, even with extra blueberries and some pure vanilla added. They were also dense like bricks, probably due to being all whole wheat flour. I used low-fat soy milk instead of milk (potential milk allergies in the house) and I used 2 TBS brown sugar instead of the artificial sweetener. Next time, I'd do ½ cup WW flour, 3/4 cup AP flour, 1½ tsp baking powder, 1 egg, 1 cup+ milk, ½ tsp salt, 2 TBS brown sugar, and ½ cup+ blueberries. Some advice: sometimes blueberries sink when added to the wet mix, so try adding them to the dry (flour+baking powder) mix, stir well to coat the berries, then add the wet works. The flour will help suspend the blueberries instead of dropping to the bottom of the bowl. As written, they weren't horrible, but I wouldn't make them like that again. Thanks for sharing, though!

Unbelieveably good!!  I used egg beaters for less fat, but otherwise followed the recipe.  These were healthy, low in calories and fat and filling and delicious. We are making them again tomorrow with raspberries instead of blueberries!

I make whole wheat pancakes for my 1 year old and freeze them for a quick breakfast.  Last time I made them I used store bought whole wheat "blend" mix and the pancakes were alright.  Well this time I wanted to make them from scratch so I found this recipe.  Wow!  I will NEVER buy a store bought mix again.  These are soooo much better and easy!  I added some applesauce and a few mashed strawberries as well as the blueberries to the mix as well as I like to pack them with as much fruit as I can since they are for my daughter.  I had to try one to make sure they were ok and I'm having a hard time not going back for another one!  I will be using this recipe from here on out.  Oh and I used a couple teaspoons of brown sugar rather than artificial sweetner...again since they are for my 1 year old.

They have no fluffiness even with the added milk and have a rubbery texture. I would not recommend them. You are better off splurging on pancakes with regular flour. It's better than being tremendously disappointed. It was embarrassing to serve these

These pancakes are great. My blueberries were a little more tart than I prefer so adding a little extra sweetener may have helped with that. Oh and i added a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla, just because I wanted to. I can't wait to try using banana instead of berries and adding some nuts. I think ground flax seed added would have been great to.

I've finally found a great, great whole wheat pancake recipe!  Thanks!  You could really play with this one and get the same great results...different kinds of flours, fruits, etc.  They weren't heavy like most whole wheat recipes I've tried.  YUM!

These were really good.  Next time I will add the 2Tbl sugar and may be some vanilla and cinnamon... I will double the recipe, too, because there weren't enough for my 2 and 4 year olds AND my husband and I... I nibbled everyone elses but had to find something else to eat!  I used frozen blueberries because that's all we had... of course they turned the batter an unappetizing blue, but once cooked they looked just like any other pancake.  I'm looking forward to 'playing' with this recipe more in the future.

Nothing says Saturday mornings like getting fresh blueberries from the farmer's market and making pancakes.  The only change I made was using real sugar, rather than the sweetener.  My husband and I make these frequently...thanks for the great recipe!  We love it!!

This was excellent! I used 2 TBSP brown sugar as recommended, and it was perfect.  I also found that a little bit over 1 cup was the right consistency for fluffy pancakes - my first batch was a little runny.  The flavor was very nice - better than plain! I love being able to incorporate whole wheat flour into recipes!  It was great with and without blueberries. I might try with some cinnamon next time.

YES!  No need for white flour! They come out absolutely perfect (just needed to add a bit more milk to loosen up the batter)and were eaten straight up with no syrup!
I did use 1 Tbsp. regular sugar instead of the artificial sweetener; we prefer the real stuff.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used soy milk and brown sugar. Also did a batch with chocolate chips. A little bland, next time I will add vanilla and maybe some cinnamon. I also noticed mine didn't "fluff" as nicely as other recipes I have used. Maybe a tad more baking powder will do the trick.

i used one cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup of ground flax. i used egg beaters instead of one egg and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. they came out great! a little gooey in the middle though, i may try adding a little milk next time. i definitely plan on making this recipe again!

Excellent pancakes! It was my first time using whole wheat flour so I used 1 cup of the w.w. and 1/4 c. of all-purpose white flour. Instead of blueberries, I used bananas and they were excellent. The leftovers froze well too.

Very easy and basic. My kids loved them and did not miss the white flour. I did not use blueberries, instead I dropped in some chochlate chips after I put them on my griddle and before I flipped them. I doubled the recipe and froze the rest. The leftovers heated up well from the freezer.

I've tried many and these tasted the best and are the healthiest with no added oil.  I used Stevia for the artificial sweetener and they came out excellent, even the first ones!

I read all the reviews before trying this recipe cautiously because I didn't want heavy pancakes from the whole wheat.  I used 3/4 C WW flour and 1/2 C white, added 1 T olive oil, 1 T brown sugar.  Added choc chips for one batch; blueberries for the other.  I actually used 1 C of milk and they were too runny so I added a bit more flour.  Be sure to sift the flour.  They turned out great.  I will gradually try using more WW flour until I can use it without any white.  It is definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe, and I use it all the time.  The pancakes are easy to make, they taste great, and they work with bananas as well as with blueberries. I do substitute brown sugar for the Splenda, and I only use a tablespoon; the blueberries bring their own sweetness to the party. I also use about a cup and an eighth of milk, sometimes a little more, or the batter gets very thick by the second batch.  All in all, the recipe makes a very satisfying breakfast for two -- four cd-sized pancakes apiece.  But I've also saved extras in the refrigerator, stacked with paper towels or parchment and sealed in a plastic bag.  To reheat, I just pop 'em into a toaster oven, directly on the rack, and literally toast them till they're hot all the way through.  They don't get tough or overdone; they taste very close to just-made.

I was so leary of using all whole wheat flour, and although these pancakes turned out dense and chewy -- the flavor was awesome (I did add about 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and used real sugar). I will NOT go back to my old recipe. This is it from now on! My husband kids LOVE them!

The receipe was excellent. Add more milk than what it calls for, and add blueberries and sliced banana to each portion immediately after pouring the batter onto the griddle. Even better than buttermilk pancakes!

Delicious!  I made these for dinner tonight- doubled the recipe. I used fresh blueberries- smashed them a bit after I added them to the batter. Also I used vanilla soy milk b/c of dairy sensitivities.  I added 1 tablespoon of oil and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I also used brown sugar instead of sugar substitute.  They turned out great! My entire family loved them!

i made these for breakfast one saturday morning for my mom and brother. the only part of the recipe that was a challenge was sifting the flour, it got stuck a few times. the outcome was well worth it. the pancakes were so tasty. i've never been much of a pancake fan, but the whole wheat is very tasty and the blueberries (i used double the recipe) made them so awesome. don't even need that much syrup. i highly recommend this recipe to everyone who wants something new for breakfast.

Maybe I'm just not used to the whole wheat thing, but I put in extra blueberries and I couldn't taste them, just the wheat. While making them, I thought cinnamon or vanilla would be good in it.

These pancakes were very good!  I did notice a slight aftertaste from the artificial sweetener.  But, I've been using sweetener instead of sugar for so long, it doesn't bother me anymore!  Anyhow, I will definately make these pancakes again.

These pancakes were fantastic! I followed the recommendation of using 1 cup of whole wheat and 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour... they turned out great. This is a keeper.

My son and I loved these pancakes.  I've searched for a great whole wheat pancake recipe but none that I've tried were very good.  These were delicious.  I added a little more milk to the batter and sprinkled some walnuts on each pancake as they cooked.  Delicious.

Good combo of healthy whole wheat and a filling pancake. Made mine with bananas instead of blueberries because thats what I had. Doesn't have a heavy whole wheat taste, however i did only use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup of all-purpose. Would definelty make again for a nice change at breakfast.

Not as fluffy as I wished. Tried again, doubled the batch, made with half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat. YUM!!

These are by far the best whole wheat pancakes ever.  I had to add about 1/3 more cup of milk so that they would be thin enough.

these were very good!  I had to add milk, but they turned out excellent.  Even my toddler loved them.  I lightly buttered them, it was all they needed!!
