After comparing a friends recipe to this one, I decided to make a couple of changes. I replaced half of the vinegar with orange juice and due to personal preference only used 2 cloves. I also felt grilling was a must both for the meat and for the pineapple. This turned out really good. The meat was super tender and tasted just like authentic tacos al pastor.

I made this for 1 person (myself), so I made the following adjustments:

> 4 thin-sliced pork chops (not as good as pork butt), cut into thin strips
> 6 oz can pineapple rings, juice reserved
> cut pineapple into Â½" dice
> put pork and pineapple into ziploc bag.

for marinade:

> 1 4 oz can Herdez Salsa Ranchera in place of the chiles
> eliminate achiote and cloves
> juice of 1 lime
> 1 shallot, minced
> 1/3 C cider vinegar
> reserved pineapple juice. 

> combine marinade ingredients in a pan, stir, and bring to a simmer; let simmer 5 minutes to cook off raw tastes; marinade should be thickened but not a paste
> cool marinade, then pour over pork and pineapple in the ziploc bag. 

> Marinate pork and pineapple for at least 1 hour
> put 1T veg oil in a cold skillet, then heat over medium burner until oil starts to shimmer
> remove pork and pineapple from marinade, but don't remove any marinade sticking to it, and put in hot skillet
> stir until pork is browned
> serve as per recipe

This was really delicious.  The chili paste is amazing.  Don't skip the pineapple!  It really sets off this dish!

I wish I would've followed some of the recommendations in the reviews. I just followed the recipe as is, and it turned out okay. I didn't have time to marinate the meat either, so I just made the sauce then cooked it up. I'm sure that affected a fair bit, but I wasn't too impressed.

I didn't have achiote powder or pineapple. I substituted turmeric for achiote, which I read was acceptable and just omitted the pineapple entirely. 

I should have cut/torn the dried peppers smaller. they didn't completely cook down into a paste and I picked chunks out. 

it was still tasty and I'm looking forward to making it again with corrections.
