If you want to make it just a little more light and fluffy, just separate the eggs and beat the whites with a hand mixer for a couple min.  Then fold them in as part of the recipe suggests.  Not much added time and this step really makes a difference.

No changes, and absolute perfection just as Chef John made it.  Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.

I used some cardamom seeds, crushed and steeped in a 1/4 cup of hot milk for a half hour to add some of my favorite flavor to this pie. It was a hit with everyone who tried it. I've made it repeatedly since.

You can make this without the crust and it's still amazing! I found this recipe as I was trying to use up some ingredients I had around. I didn't have enough flour (or desire, really) to make a crust, so I skipped it. Also, I substituted coconut oil for butter because I didn't have any butter, and I cut the sugar by a half-cup. The pies still came out great. Next time, however, I'll reduce the sugar even more. It just wasn't necessary to use so much.

Love love love anything by Chef John and this pie is no exception! I substituted plain organic yogurt & coconut milk for buttermilk per Chef's suggestion (I didn't want to go to the store) & lime for the lemon, due to allergies. Decreased sugar to 1 1/4c and used salted butter omitting the salt, OH MY WOW!!! Used to think "Grandma" made the best buttermilk pie but even she could take lessons from Chef John. The undetectable substitutions and fresh grated nutmeg made an authentic, rich, ample, 9" deep dish buttermilk pie.  There are more of your recipes than any other contributor in my favorites collection. I am NEVER disappointed!
Gave pies away as Christmas gifts and all exclaimed this was better than a favorite at our local restaurant.

It tasted like a lemon pie. And it was beautiful to look at but it was not accepted well by the dinner guests. No one was very enthused with it. I thought it was pretty good but not even close to a 5 star pie. Sorry.  I used all fresh ingredients but it seemed a little too tart. I also had a very picky audience so I wouldn't take this vote as proof perfect. Wonder if it wouldn't be better with some other mix and match flavors?

Lovely, unusual pie that tastes like it was more work than it was. Mine came out of the oven with a pool of butter on top; not sure if that was supposed to happen, but it was soon absorbed again. I think next time I'll cut the sugar down a bit and add an extra lemon.

For most of my life we have made this pie year around  and it's always gone before I can get a slice. So I always  make two and on holidays  and special occasions  I'll make three or four because  the buttermilk pie is always the first pie gone in Southern homes.

I wanted to love it, but it was more like a giant lemon bar than a buttermilk pie. Next time I make it I'll be cutting out the zest, and cutting the juice down to 1 tbsp (per most traditional recipes) and the sugar down to 1 cup.

This is not the Southern buttermilk pie that I grew up with. Too much lemon! I could not discern the buttermilk flavor at all.

I've made it 6 times so far.  Whenever I go to a party I get, "You gonna bring one of those buttermilk pies.". So easy and so good.  I've used both buttermilk and yogurt and its amazing either way.  Also agree with other comments...only use one cup sugar.  For an amazing crowd pleasing topping blend I can evaporated milk, 1 cup blackberries (I had to use frozen) and about 1/4 cup sugar.

This pie was fantastic! I am rating it 5 stars because it's worth every star. I did almost mess it up when I added the juice of 2 lemons and zest rather than the one called for and I didn't compensate for the extra liquid with flour so it didn't set up in the oven like it was supposed to. It did however, set up overnight in the fridge even though it was a little bit loose, it still cut and served well and was well received by our guests.
Thank you Chef John for another delicious dessert recipe!

It was a good pie, I prefer fruit pies but I made this pie, since my husband doesn’t like anything with fruit. I did not use as much lemon (just a bit more than a teaspoon), since I know he doesn’t love a lemony flavor. I baked for about 49min and it seemed well set. I think I will make it again, it was easy to make and flavorful but definitely not my favorite.

This is my new favorite pie! Its lemony, custardy, and delicious. All my children loved it too. I did mine in a toaster oven on the middle shelf. The top got dark but in a good way.  It was like creme brulee. This was the result of baking it in the toaster oven on a shelf that was too high. What a wonderful mistake. I will do it that way every time I make it. I can't wait for Thanksgiving this year, I have a feeling everyone will love it.

I love your recipes, Chef John but this one didnt work for me.  Maybe its me.  The pie separated into lemon pudding on the bottom and cake on top.  I think only a tablespoon would have really been enough just to balance the vanilla without overpowering it or curdling the batter.  Nice try tho.
