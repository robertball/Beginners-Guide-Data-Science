This coffee cake was good, certainly not moist, it's quite filling, but very tasty!  The cake went well with milk or coffee and I think next time I'll cut down on the chocolate - it got to be quite rich for me.  Others loved it.  Oh, and for anyone making this, please mix the chocolates & nuts in one bowl and the cinnamon & sugar in a different one.  I tried following the recipe and ended up using a sifter to separate them so they could be spread equally.     Will make again.

Absolutely delicious and very moist!  I'd recommend mixing the cinnamon & sugar separate from the chocolate & nuts just because it would be easier to spread the layers.  Will make again!

This recipe was fantastic.  I substituted fat free yogurt for the sour cream and didn't mix the chocolate with the sugar as suggested.  It was moist and delicious.  We will surely make this again.

Excellent!  We made this cake this year for our Happy Birthday Jesus coffee cake for breakfast for Christmas morning. The only thing that I would do differently next time is not mix the chocolate chips and sugar/cinnamon. I would sprinkle LESS chocolate chips when it's time to add that layer and sprinkle cinnamon and sugar.  Due to dietary issues in my family, I used raw sugar and carob chips and it turned out fantastic!  This is a keeper and will be a repeat.

I halved this recipe for a 8x8 pan, and it was great! The batter tasted great from the beginning, and I didn't think the combination of chocolate chips and pecans tasted odd. I just added a bit less sugar, like everyone suggested, and it was perfectly sweet!

This is the one!! Totally a keeper.
Like everyone, i do altered the recipe :))
Here goes: i only use 1cup white sugar n 1/2cp brown sugar to sprinkle with the cinnamon. I do separate the cinnamon n the choc like other reviewer said, i also omit the nut (coz it's very expensive here), i only use 8ounce choc chucnks, and i forgot the baking soda, hahaha..
I use 4eggs and only use 1cp sour cream coz that's all i have.
And with that much alteration, it's still turn out great!! 
Definitely try this recipe! If you cream the butter n sugar (it takes me 10mnts till all the eggs mixed properly) well you'll have a perfect cake.

This was really good. I followed the recipe except cutting it in half and using an 8x8 pan since it is only me and my husband. The only problem I had was the choc. chips sank to the bottom so next time I would try mini choc chips and maybe some more cinnamon in the middle layer but otherwise this was delicious! Reminded me of choc. chip muffins we used to get from this little family owned bakery in Rochester, NY!

This is amazingly delicious and moist!  To get around using 3 bowls, I mixed the wet ingredients, then added the dry ingredients (no premixing).  I use reduced fat sour cream, and it tastes great.  I've also made this with blueberries instead of chocolate, and it is just as (if not more) delicious!

This is incredibly good!  It's always a big hit whenever I make it.  It's very hard not to go back for seconds, or thirds....or maybe 4ths.  Very rich

This was tasty. To make once and enjoy. But not one to make over and over again. Glad I made it, but really nothing amazing.

This recipe is a "Keeper", but I would not call it moist like some of the other reviews.  I also would suggest that you sprinkle the cinnamon & sugar mixture first, & then sprinkle the chocolate chunks & pecans ( I see no reason to mix the sugar-cinnamon-chocolate-pecans together).  People at the church have asked me for this recipe several times...they really enjoyed it...it also looks great when cut & placed on the plate.

A huge family hit! To make the prep time a little quicker I used mini semi-sweet choc chips rather than the chunks. I also took the other reviewers' advice and added the choc/nut and cinnamon/sugar mixture seperately.

This was a great coffee cake. It was gone in minutes at work! I used a smaller pan so it took a little longer to bake and the edges were crustier, but it was still delicious!

I loved this, and so did everyone at our Easter brunch. I made recipe exactly as-is, I just separated the chocolate and sugar mixtures like the other reviewers suggested. This cake is FILLING and makes a LOT so you can easily cut it in half for a medium/small sized crowd.

This was so so yummy. The cake was super moist and my dad even loved it (he hates chocolate!). The only thing i would do differently next time is mix the cinnamon and sugar in a separate bowl from the chocolate chunks and pecan pieces.

I had no pecans when I made this, so I added in 1/2 bag of white chocolate chips instead, otherwise, the recipe was made exactly as stated.  Next time, I think I'll put in a pinch more salt, but it wasn't missed by anyone but me.
This was excellent, and was even better the second day!

I LOVE this recipe! I didn't have enough chocolate chunks, but I substituted white chocolate chips for the rest.
