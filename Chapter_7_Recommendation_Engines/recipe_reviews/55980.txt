Delicious recipe. Love the combination of flavors. Very easy to prepare and went well with a bottle of cabernet. Will make again and again.

I tried this recipe along with the entire Thanksgiving menu and loved it.  I didn't even test out the recipe before I served it to my guests.

This was gobbled up right away to rave reviews.  I used regular olives instead of calamata because I had them in the house!

Delicious!  I made a dinner for my boyfriend and used these as the appetizers.  We LOVE goat cheese and we ate so much of this there was very little room for our main and dessert!  Perfect for lunch or a Friday night easy dinner after work.

This was delicious.  Fresh, healthy, elegant.  I enjoyed taking it to an appetizer party.  Was a wonderful addition to the table.

I loved this and have been asked for this recipe...stands head and shoulders above the same old bruschetta recipe we all have!
