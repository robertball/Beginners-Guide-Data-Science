Thank you for this recipe!  My children also love canned soup, but the sodium content is horrifying!  I bought an organic whole fryer chicken and was unsure what I would do with it. I found your recipe and gave it a try.  I have often made chicken soup with prepared broth and chicken breasts, but I love your version.  Before I added the vegetables, I refrigerated the broth overnight and then skimmed off most of the solidified fat. I then boiled the broth, chopped chicken, onion and vegetables the next day. I added 1/2 the recommended salt, a little parsley and basil, and I love it!  I boiled the egg noodles separately so I can freeze half the soup. I did not add the spinach.

I liked this version. But I exchanged the Rosemary for Thyme (family preference).  I also cooked half the noodles, separate from the soup and added them just before serving (I don't like cloudy broth unless it's a creamy base) I also used about 
 3 leaves of Kale (chopped) rather than Spinach.  Everyone liked it,  but this family still has it's favorite.....one that has been passed on throughout the years from G. Grandma.

This was amazing! Best chicken noodle soup ever! I made it as written with the exception of needing to add more water throughout the cooking process. Definitely recommend this soup recipe!

A favorite in our home. I add extra chicken and drop an egg or two in the broth.

Delicious!  Kids and wife loved it.  I used 2/3 of a pound of angel-hair pasta instead of the egg noodles.  I also needed to add a fair amount of water and salt to taste.

The flavor is great and the soup is easy to make. I used 4 chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken because we donâ€™t care for dark meat. I ended up having to add about 7 more cups of water and 2 chicken bouillon cubes because the soup got really thick.
