I won my company's Chicken Cook-Off with this recipe.  I cooked the chicken in an oven at 350 for 30 minutes instead of using a microwave.

TERRIFIC! We could not believe how GREAT this recipe was! Instead of the microwave I used the oven: 350 for 45 minutes (don't put them too close together or the sides won't cook). I toasted some rice bread (wheat allergy) and put it in the cuisinart to make crumbs - they were the best part! Kind of a chunky coarse crumb topping instead of super fine crumbs (had about 1 cup total). Poured all the left over crumb mixture over chicken before cooking. They held a lot of the butter (used about 1/4 cup vs 1T) and got crunchy-toasty in the oven! SUPER RECIPE! Amazing flavor! Smelled fantastic while cooking! Presentation is company-worthy or nice for an everyday meal! Don't leave out any of the spices - the combination of them all is what makes it! Thank you for a new favorite! We'll be talking about this one for a long time!

I wasn't sure what to expect as its cooked in the microwave.  I loved this meal and plan on adding it to my regular rotation.  I only made one change: used mozzarella instead of swiss.  Its a little messy to roll them all up but its worth it.

I have to give this 5 stars because I was so happy with the butter/bread crumb/microwave idea! I changed the stuffing though, used fresh mozzarella, roma tomatoes, and fresh basil. I cooked for 7 minutes 30 seconds and it was moist and perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

I, too, was skeptical about this dish because it's cooked in the microwave, but it is delicious!  It's almost too good to be true because it's so quick and easy.  I was looking for a great dinner dish that wouldn't heat up my kitchen during the summer months, and this one fits the bill.  I will be making it again and again, all year 'round.

What a timesaving delicious recipe for a working woman.  Didn't think something so easy would taste so good, but I was gratefully wrong.

When I found this recipe I was looking for something I could cook in the microwave. I got a new apartemnt and very little time for cooking. The recipe sounded great. I did make a few changes: insted of using swiss chesse I use provolone. The presliced round simlir to the turkey lunchmeat and turkey breast slices that I used. I added this recipe to my recipe and e-mailed to my mother It was great!!!!

Wonderful recipe! Fun to make with lots of flavor! I seasoned the chicken with garlic pepper and basil before topping with the ham and cheese (swiss and monteray jack). As suggested by some others, and since my oven was already on, I baked in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. It would be interesting to use the microwave to cook this though. I placed  the chicken with the seam side up to help keep the cheese from melting out.  This recipe is a keeper!

I was skeptical to try this because it cooked in the microwave but because of all the 5* ratings I just had to try it.  I used Provolone instead Swiss and did not use the tarragon because I didn't have any.  I would definitely make this again.  It was easy and had a great flavor.  I did cook it about 6 minutes instead of 4 but all microwaves heat differently.  Thanks Sara for a quick weeknight main dish!!

I love this recipe.  It is super easy and very tasty.  And, best of all, it is made with ingredients I usually have in the house already.  For a whole pan, it usually needs 7-10 minutes in the microwave.  I use flavored bread crumbs mixed with parmesean cheese and finish with butter flavored cooking spray instead of melted butter.  These two changes make it an even easier recipe!

Family liked this.  We are low carbers so I prepared the chicken following the recipe leaving out the bread crumbs and the melted butter.  Using olive oil, I browned on all sides in a pan then covered, turned on low and finished until chicken was cooked through.  Then I sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served.  Outside was crispy and brown, inside was tender and juicy, the spice blend was delicious.

Excellent as written!  My teenagers loved this, and I loved its simplicity.  I don't know why anyone would choose to cook this in the oven instead of using the microwave.  The benefit of this recipe, in addition to its wonderful taste, is the ease in cooking it.  My kids will be taking this recipe to college.

This was AMAZING. I used Havarti cheese, and ground up pork rinds instead of breadcrumbs(low carb diet). The pork rinds didn't affect the flavor of the chicken though, and made a good breading. I will definitely be making this again =)

Delicious, I love the recipe. I baked it at 400* for 20 minutes. Tonight, I am using pork rinds (grinded up) instead of bread crumbs. Same result minus the carbs =)

Great recipe!  Just a couple of changes: I used grated mozzarella because it was what I had in the fridge, and since I was in no hurry and was a little afraid to microwave the chicken, I cooked it in the oven.  It recieved a "not bad" rating from  my husband, which for him means it liked it.  Yummy!  I will make this dish again.

Very good! I used mozzerella and thin sliced chicken breast (it made more and cost less by using thin sliced - plus no pounding out the chicken). My microwave is on the fritz so I baked for about 15-20 min. on 350. I also sprinkled a little garlic powder on the inside before rolling (personal preference - love garlic). Very simple to follow. Will try microwave when I buy a new one. Thanks for sharing!

Delish!! I added a little shredded mozzarella to the inside and dipped in an egg wash before coating with the crumbs...baked instead of waving and it was outstanding...looked so pretty with the mozzarella oozing out of the middle...yum! Thanks Sara for a dish that looks and tastes like I slaved for hours!!

I just served this for dinner.  It was like 86 degrees outside and I just didn't feel like cooking.  I was very impressed!  I left out the tarragon (didn't have any) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This was absolutely fantastic!  Only 4 minutes in the microwave (I was REALLY skeptical about this) but it turned out absolutely perfect.  Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful!  I double the recipe and baked it in the oven for 45 minutes at 350 F.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  For ham, I used a whole container of the ham that comes from the pre-packaged deli section in a glad-ware like container (Hillshire Farms or store brand would work).  It's a little lower in fat than some hams.  Also, I used 2% Swiss slices from the pre-packaged cheese aisle to cut the fat a little more.  Instead of drizzling butter, I just sprayed a few times with a zero calorie butter spray (but be careful with those...if you do too many sprays, you ARE adding calories and fat!)....I had eight roll-ups and gave each one about 10 sprays.  It was VERY good!

I was definitely skeptical about the microwave cooking method and actually saved this recipe planning to just use the oven. When I came home for a short lunch break today, though, I decided to try it in the micro. My fiance and I were extremely surprised at how well it worked and how moist the chicken was. He actually said "why do we ever use an oven, anyway?" I varied the recipe a bit... Just skipped the tarragon bc I didn't have it, left out butter bc it doesn't need it, and added slices of roast beef bc he always loves extra meat. We will definitely make this again.

I added some cream of mushroom soup on the top and put it in the oven. Once, instead of using ham, I quartered hot dogs and that turned out wonderful.

I loved this recipe!  In appearance, too, I give it 5 stars.  The only change I made was to split the chicken breasts into smaller strips so that I instead ended up with a lot of mini-romano-chickens.

My family asked two questions when I served this dish. 1)Why haven't we had this before? and 2)Will we be having this again? This is "dinner party" in taste and appearance but so simple and fast you can make it anytime with minimum effort.  ***FYI, I also found that 4 minutes in my (very powerful) microwave was insufficint, go with 10 minutes*** This is a keeper!

I was the hugest skeptic of this but pleasantly surprised! Mine took longer than 4 minutes but I think that was because of the thickness of my chicken (while the edge of the ham was popping and a little overcooked). Still, an easy and QUICK meal that I'd use again! Great for nights we eat and run! Thanks Sara!

The hubby and I both love this recipe.  Chicken always turns out moist and delicious.  Have used various fillings, usually whatever I have on hand, but the ham and swiss is our favorite.  Can prep it beforehand and then all you need to do is pop it in the microwave.  Super easy!

Fabulous!  Didn't have tarragon, so I skipped it.  Used provolone because I hate swiss cheese.  I can't believe this cooks in the microwave!  Amazing and so fast!  The entire family LOVED it!  Definitely a keeper! Thank you for this recipe!

Excellent!! I served with some spaghetti and marinara sauce.  I baked it for 35 minutes at 350F. I also broiled the chicken for about 30 seconds to make it more golden and crunchy.

My husband absolutely loved this dish. I used Rosemary ham and it was delicious. I cooked it in the oven on 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. I am a bit nervous about cooking meat in the microwave.

Delicious! I shredded the cheese (thought this would make it easier to roll it up), then dipped the rolls in ranch dressing, bottled not the packet,(actually I brushed it on; if I dip it in I get too much ranch on the chicken), then used crushed Ritz crackers with paprika, basil, and pepper (my spice preference) as the coating. Didn't have to use toothpicks. Put them on a rack on a cookie sheet and baked 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes. Man oh man, was it delicious! Thanks!!

This is the best!! Thanks for a great recipe. We don't have a microwave so I cooked this in a pan under the grill at 225C for 35 minutes, turning once.
I served this on a bed of rocket and watercress drizzled with olive oil.

Always great- this is in my regular rotation - everyone loves it and it is SO easy. I do bake mine and I use Prosciutto (SP?) instead of ham. 
Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe, quick and tasty. We doubled the cheese, and broiled it for about 5 minutes after the microwave to make it crispy, other than that we thought the recipe was perfect, and we'll make it again.

Fantastic!  I cooked it in the oven, but I think I'll try the microwave next time.  I doubled the butter - yum.  There were no leftovers for the next day.  I'll have to make more next time.

This was surprisingly good.  We made half the recipe, and it still took about 5.5 minutes to cook the chicken in the microwave.  We also took the suggestion to add extra butter and then the remaining bread crumb topping after it comes out of the microwave, and then broil it in the oven...got nice and crispy!  A very impressive-looking and tasty meal for not very much work.  The best kind of meal!

Yum.  I used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and baked in the oven, but I think I would probably try the microwave in the future.

Very delicious!  Even my picky eaters liked it!  (One of them pulled the ham out, but -- hey, at least they really liked the flavor!)
     I decided to bake it in the oven since I couldn't flatten my chicken out to 1/4 inch thick.  Then, I was concerned that it would dry out in the oven, so I put a little water into some Cream of Mushroom soup and poured it on top of the chicken rolls.  I put my seasonings on top of the soup mixture.
     I baked it at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.

I'm pretty sure this is a recipe for chicken cordon bleu, if you use swiss cheese for that. It was very good. I cooked it in the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes and put an extra piece of ham and cheese on top during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Next time I would add an extra slice of cheese inside the chicken.

My only alteration for next time  (of which there will be many) is to only make half the crumbing mixture as I had alot left over.

The beauty of this recipe is that      it is done in 4 Minutes. in the Microwave! And it truly is great! Why bother go the conventional way, heat up the oven and bake for over 30 minutes. A total waste of energy !A total waste IMO.

Excellent.  I had to omit the tarragon because I didn't have any.  And I browned the chicken before cooking in the oven because I always do, but otherwise followed exactly.  This is like chicken cordon bleu minus the sauce.

This was amazing!  After my husband took the first bite, he said, "Wow!" & I said, "Microwaved!" & he said, "But it's not rubbery!" It was so incredibly moist & flavorful!  I didn't have some of the ingredients (like ham, swiss cheese, paprika, garlic salt, or tarragon), but used mozzarella, two small minced garlic cloves, parsley, & doubled the basil & it came out great.  I did end up having to cook it for 8 minutes in my microwave.  Thanks so much for this quick, delicious, & easy recipe!!

We love this recipe. I've made it in the microwave and the conventional oven and it's always great. The only thing I do differently is use less paprika - 1 1/2 tsp is really overpowring. I usually only use 1/2 tsp.

Everyone liked the chicken, but nobody liked the Swiss cheese. Maybe I'll try this with another type of cheese - havarti or monterey jack. Thanks!

I was a bit leary of cooking this in the microwave. It is wonderful! I used mozzarella instead of Swiss and Italian bread crumbs. I dipped the chicken rolls into butter before rolling them into bread crumbs. After removing the rolls from the microwave for 5 minutes, I put them in my toaster oven for five minutes. Yum! Very easy, very good recipe.

Great!  I used fresh tarragon and basil. Panko bread crumbs make the coating very crunchy. Used presliced lunch ham, monterey and mozzerella cheeses and baked in oven for 35 min at 350.

I am always skeptical of trying anything that is not a perfect 5, and then I read all the reviews and usually talk myself out of making it. Tonight I had no time to read the reviews. This was wonderful. My picky eaters all ate it. Its hard to make a hit with all. I have a 1, 3, and 8 year old. This is the fastest recipe I have ever made that didn't compromise the taste.

I used the thin sliced chicken breasts that you can buy.  It saves time not having to pound the breasts.  I didn't even need to use toothpicks...just put seam side down.  Baking them works nicely and gives them a bit of crust.

Very good  for Micro chicken , did take me about 8 minutes to cook it though with a very powerfull microwave- sometimes we use chciken cutlets to cut down on pounding time.

Smelled great cooking. Very tender. Vegetables were awesome.  Used garlic clove not garlic salt, and Italian seasoning because I didn't have Old Bay.

This recipe was my first ever cooking success with chicken!  It really is easy and tastes very good, especially considering it's so quick to make.  Use saran wrap to cover the chicken while you're pounding it with the tenderizer.

Great recipe.  I used it for a weekend lunch.  It was great to get in and out of the kitchen fast.  Even my very picky 5-year old liked it.  I will use it for after late ball practices on school nights so we can get kids in bed fast!  It took about 7-8 minutes in our microwave.  Also, I used italian bread crumbs and that came out very well.

My microwave took 7 minutes.  This was so quick and delicious.  I made this on a hot, humid day and was pleased not to have to use the oven.  I used smoked ham packaged in the deli section and shredded swiss.  I opened up a can of mexican corn tossed that in the microwave and I was eating in no time.  Healthy meal!! indeed.

These are soooooooooo yummy. I usually just put them flat and bake in the oven. I never have gotten comfortable cooking meat in the microwave. We love this taste combination.

Family loved this.  It does not taste like a microwave recipe.  I used wooden toothpicks to hold the chicken together, but they were hard to remove when the chicken was cooked.  Next time I'll leave them out.  The chicken kind of cooks itself together anyway.

Excellent flavors.  Followed recipe to the "T". Cooked in microwave about 10 minutes though. Next time I plan to roll in egg wash and then bread crumbs and bake in oven.  Thank you for submitted - easy and delish.

This recipe was really good. I substituted colby-jack cheese for the swiss and it turned out great! Took a little longer than 4 minutes but was worth it.

This is the a great recipe! So easy to make and very very good! Took my chicken about 8 minutes to cook and 8 minutes to make! After I breaded the roll-up I poured the butter on top and then the remaining breadcrumb mixture. It made the dish alittle more rich and flavorful. I used honey baked ham and light swiss cheese.

This was delicious, and yes, cooking it in the microwave worked & it looked good done as well.  I have a bigger Family so I cooked 6 breasts at a time in a glass 9x13 pan in the microwave, & had to double the cooking time. Halfway thru cooking my husband came in & "said:"you're cooking dinner in the microwave? Oh no! It will probably be awful!" So to appease him I turned on the broiler and cooked it for 2 minutes under the heat. But I didn't need to do that, and next time I will just make sure he's not in the kitchen ;)

Sooooo easy! This was delicious and the perfect easy meal to make after a stressful work week. I baked mine in the oven at 350 degrees for 20-30 min as recommended by other viewers. I plan to make these again for my roommates very soon.

I made this using fresh grated Parmesan and omitted the tarragon by personal preference.  I also did not microwave this, but cooked it in the oven at 375 for about 30 minutes.  I loved the breadcrumb coating on this chicken.

We like the bread crumb spicing of the chicken.  I think I would add more cheese the next time, since I could not taste the Swiss cheese at all.  Ours took 11 minutes to cook in the microwave.

I still can't believe I made a chicken dinner in the microwave.  I was so much of a non-believer that I put one roll-up in the oven, just in case, but lo and behold, the microwave chicken was done to PERFECTION in 4 minutes.  Not rubbery.  Not dry.  And delicious.  I was simply amazed.

At the end of this month, we're having a dinner party/game night and did a test meal with this recipe (we want a less fussy meal so we can also enjoy the party).  Love this!  We weren't sure that the microwave would do the trick, never cooked meat like this before.  Delightfully surprised!  It was very juicy and all the way cooked through.  And even though I tweaked the recipe a bit (see below), it was incredibly delicious.  Totally going to make this again.

We didn't have tarragon or basil, so we used Italian seasoning.  We also didn't have swiss so we used cheddar.  We used a glass baking dish in the microwave, no toothpicks (just put the end of the rolls down) and had no problems.

Keeps really well for the next day.  Reheat in microwave a little at a time versus overheating, (the cheese will melt out too much and be inedible).

This was amazing. Crispy/juicy/textured in just the right way. Admittedly, I substituted quite a few things: chicken thighs for hammered boneless chicken, mozzarella/goat cheeses for Swiss, herbs de Provence for paprica, fresh rosemary for tarragon, and instead of the microwave I cooked it in the oven at 350-375 for about 45 min. Really easy and really yummy! A nice variation from the typical boring chicken dish. I'll have to try the microwave next time in a rush.

Using the words of Michael Scott, this dish is "Awesome blossom, extra awesome!"  I baked it instead of nuking it, and wow, the compliments just kept coming. Great stuff, I will be using this one again and again.

Taste is pretty good but we felt it was a little bland as most of the cheese melted out of the chicken.  Next time I will add fresh basil leaves to the filling because I imagine it would taste better.

We tried a very nice smoked ham that we got from Omaha Steak Co. It added a nice element to the overall recipe.  I recommend shaving the ham and cheese to allow for easier assembly. This is now one of our family favorites.

I changed this recipe a bit, putting a bit of tomato sauce and mozzarella on the chicken before I rolled it up.  I also cooked it in the oven for 30 minutes at 350.  Everyone I've made it for has raved!

I was really excited about this recipe, but by the time dinner was over I was a little disappointed. Due to allergies I used crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs, and I couldn't bring myself to microwave this, so I threw it in the oven. I don't know if that's what the problem was or not, but it seemed really dry to me, and a little on the bland side when it came to the spices. It wasn't one of our favorites, but all in all it wasn't that bad.

Great recipe!  This dish is extremely quick and doesn't compromise on taste.  I ended up having to adjust the cooking time to six minutes (every microwave will be different, I suppose).  If you want a crisp coating on the chicken, put it under the broiler as other reviewers suggested.  I also use prosciutto instead of ham, just my personal preference.  Thanks for the quick meal idea!

This tasted really good; I had a heck of a time rolling the chicken, cheese and ham to be honest. I used tenderloins and I did pound them as well but the cheese didn't wrap easily. However, coating wasn't as hard as I anticipated. Will make again and hopefully will develop a technique to make it easier to roll. Thanks for the recipe!

I've been telling everyone about this recipe.  The miracle microwave chicken recipe.  I usually loathe food cooked in the microwave, but this is delicious.  It did take 8 minutes to cook in my mic oven, but other than that I made no changes and it turned out fab-u-lus!

Tonight will be the second time I have made this dish.  I am still leary of putting the chicken in the microwave, picturing it pretty rubbery.  I have made it in the oven and it is one of the best dishes I have made.  All family members cleaned their plates.  I might be more brave next time and try the microwave.  Thanks for an awesome meal!

Very easy, except having to pound the chicken.  I wish my grocery store sold chicken cutlets!!!  Pretty tasty, an easy weeknight meal.  I followed the recipe except for using provolone.

Very easy to put together and very good flavor.  The only thing I had to adjust was the time in the microwave.  Four minutes was nowhere near long enough.  I ended up doing 10 which was a touch too long, so I think about 8 minutes would work best.

Very tasty and quick to make in the microwave.  I used provolone instead of swiss and it tasted great.  I only used 3 chicken breasts so I probably should have cut down on the bread crumbs, so that more of the parm and herbs came through in the taste.  Also, make sure you pound the chicken very thin so that it rolls more easily.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this and they are very picky. I used chicken tenderloin instead of breasts, so they ended up appetizer sized. Also used mozzerella sticks cut up instead of swiss cheese. Turned out just a little dry so I will add more butter next time.

Wow, everytime I make something new for my picky family, they usually complain...not with this one!  I didn't have a pounding tool, so I hammered the chicken w/ a rolling pin.  I was very hesitant to use the microwave, but this turned out very moist,favorful and evenly cooked in 10 minutes.  Used 2T butter, but I think 1T would be plenty as it pooled in the dish.  Served w/ garlic and cheese mash potatoes.

I agree with everyone, this is very quick and tasty!  I didn't have bread crumbs, so just crushed up some croutons.  Also, I unknowingly thawed out chicken tenders, not chicken breasts, but I made them the same way as mentioned in the directions and they turned out great! Because they were smaller, the 4 minutes in the microwave was perfect.  This is definately a keeper recipe!

My chicken breasts were huge so they looked like a smashed mess once I pounded them thin enough, but when I got them rolled up and coated, they looked great!  I've made this twice now and was casual with measuring but both times they turned out very tasty and pretty.

Absolutely the best!  Don't change a thing!  I used a glass 9x9 dish.  The Tbsp of melted butter, although I didn't think it would do the trick, was enough.  I would have to say that Pounding time is not included in the Prep Time.  I pounded mine very thin and then froze the extras.  Worked very well.  Thank you.  Have made several times now and guests are always amazed.

This Romano Chicken is like Cordon Bleu without the deep-frying.  Next time I'd add a little less paprika to the bread crumbs.  Otherwise, there's nothing else to say except: Bon Appetit!

I made this recipe last night and everybody loved it - they're still talking about it today!  I cooked in the microwave for about 8 mins first.  I then took some of the other reviewers suggestions - added more melted butter, and the rest of the crumb mixture on top and then broiled a bit in the oven to make it crispy.  This recipe is unreal!

These were great-I used chicken breasts, pounded thin, and they took about 14 minutes to cook in the microwave on high.  They were perfect.

WOW!  This was my first recipe tried from this site. I was skeptic since it is microwaved, but the ratings and need for a quick dinner won me over.  I am amazed at how easy and how yummy -- so was the hubby.  I cooked for 7 minutes...will use this recipe many times again!  Thanks!

This was really good. Following some of the others’ suggestions, I used the oven, but ended up using the microwave to make sure some of the larger pieces were cooked through.

Was skeptical about the microwave thing but the stove isn't working right so I tried it!  *note- didn't have ham and Swiss so I used turkey, pepperoni and cheddar*. This recipe turned out GREAT!! IN THE MICROWAVE!! Love it!!  Would also note that the rolls should not be touching to ensure better crispness and with my microwave I needed about 12 minutes to get 4 rolls cooked completely.  Delicious and will do this one again!!!

I also baked this in the oven instead of microwave.  45 minutes at 350.  I will also try it with Provolone instead of Swiss.  My husband was impressed - he called it "advanced cooking" even though it was pretty simple.

We loved this recipe. It was wonderful. We cooked everything as directed except on one we tried it with provolone cheese (it was all we had left) and we liked that better than the swiss. We'll use provolone next time. Great recipe.

My boyfriend LOVED this!!! He said you better give this one a good rating. To me, it tasted just like Cordon Bleu but w/out sauce! Anyways, it was really easy to make, I used thinly sliced ham from the deli counter and instead of making in the microwave I cooked in the oven at 350 until finished. It's nice to know though that if I'm ever in a super big rush I can cook in the microwave! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I use a different cheese (usually mozza) only because I don't like swiss.

I made this back in my dorm when I was in college, and my room mates where SO jealous when it got done. It looked great, and tasted even better. I'll have to make this again soon.

The bottom line: it works. I think this is the first time I've ever cooked the main course in the microwave. But by golly, it works. Thought the chicken would need some moisture to help the coating stick, so I dipped it in some melted butter first. Make sure your chicken pieces are pretty much the same size or some will dry out while others are still a little on the raw side! (And don't forget to take out the toothpicks -- or at least warn your diners...)

I wish I could give this 6 stars.  It is so quick but makes a great flavorful, pretty meal that looks like it takes lots of time.  I paired with fresh greenbeans cooked 3-4 min in the microwave and some crusty bread - Superb!

These turned out great!  I used the tenderloins, and enjoyed them.  I was skeptical about putting chicken in the microwave, but after reading other review, thought that it would be okay.

Very easy and really good. My husband and son really enjoyed it and said it was a keeper. I used two tablespoons of butter instead of one, and it was delicious!
Thank you Sara!

Good mix of flavors in the breading. Easy to put together. I also cooked mine in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 to get a bit of a crisper coating. Might be good with an extra slice of swiss added to the top of each piece of chicken during the last 10 minutes of cooking.

This was delicious! I was nervous about making an actual meal in the microwave, because generally I only use my microwave to defrost or heat something up, but this was very good, the entire family enjoyed it. I made the recipe exactly as stated, minus the tarragon (I didn't have any on hand.)Will definitely make again!!

Very good recipe.  I added a bit extra garlic than it called for, and it was a good change.  Obviously prep time takes longer than recipe claims.  Also, cook time was about 9 minutes as opposed to 4.  Still, a quick fix.
