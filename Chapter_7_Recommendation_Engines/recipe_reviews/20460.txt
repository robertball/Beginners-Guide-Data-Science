I bought 2 of the cooked rotisserie chickens from the grocery store. I cut that up. I also used fresh broccoli. 
Both uncooked chicken and frozen broccoli release a lot of water when cooked. Hence, most of the reviewers problems.
As for the bland taste, I sprinkled garlic powder, I did not use basil. (sorry, basil is better in Italian dishes)I grated monterey jack that had jalapeno in it, and sprinkled a mix of monterey and cheddar cheese as well. The grocery store sells this mix in one bag.
 I also added some uncooked minute rice, for it will cook due to the soup in it.
 I cooked it at 400 degrees and watched it to see if I was going to need to add any more milk. 
 The way I did this turned out incredible, and was not watery in the least.

Loved it, with a few changes.  My family doesn't care for basil, so I omitted it.  I also substituted fresh broccoli for the frozen and cheddar for jack cheese.  I added an extra layer of cheese the last few minutes of cooking.  It was a little watery, so I served it over rice.  I'll probably omit the milk next time to make a thicker consistency.  Even my broccoli-hating husband enjoyed this one. Delicious!

I thought this was pretty good. I cooked the chicken breasts before I put them in the recipe. (I had read some reviews that said it was too soupy, which was probably from the chicken being uncooked.) I covered it with aluminum foil so it wouldn't get burned on top. My husband really liked it.

I left out the cheese and instead, topped with prepared chicken stuffing.  Also used a can of cream of mushroom in the mix and doubled the broccoli.  Very tasty recipe!  It's been added to our meal rotation.

Pretty good, my husband liked it. Since other reviewers said it was watery, I cooked the chicken and steamed broccoli before I put it in the oven. I also added fried onions on top.

This was an excellent chicken recipe.  I did substitute sharp cheddar for the monterey and I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  I made biscuits to go with it.  Very good.

This was great. Easy and quick and I could make it with items already in my house.  I served it with rice on the side.  I would make more servings next time because there were no left overs.

We've made this several times now. We don't change it very much- we aren't exact on chicken, and do 12 oz of broccoli. We add a small can of mushroom stems and pieces. I usually decrease the milk by a hair because of the liquid in the other foods. As written, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper is way too much. We cut in half and still have a very strong pepper flavor. We love this recipe because it is a delicious chicken "slop" that is very healthy and low in calories.

I used 4 chicken breasts, baked seperately and then chopped. I thawed 16oz of chopped frozen broccoli and squeezed out the excess moisture. I only used 1/3c milk and this turned out perfect. 4* due to changes made, but it was very tasty and went over well with my family for Mother's Day.

It may have been my fault that it didn't turn out great...it was good but don't think I'll make it again. Not too much flavor but filling! I put in double the mushroom soup which made it a bit runny but I like extra sauce. Easy and little to clean up!

This is delicious...made it for the first time.  It was quick, easy to prepare and the taste was wonderful.  My son joined us for dinner and he had two helpings and raved about it. I used Asiago shredded cheese instead of the Monterey Jack and substituted French's Fried Onions in place of the green onions for a little crunch.  Yummy,  will make this again.

I used this recipe as a base and kind of did my own thing with it. I subbed cheddar for the jack, aded a good bit of garlic and onion powder, paprika, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. I cooked the chicken and broccoli before mixing everything together and also added about a cup of pre-cooked brown rice. It still seemed soupy after I added the rice, so I added one beaten egg to the mixture as I would have done for a typical broccoli casserole. Lastly, I topped it with a small layer of cheese and one sleeve of ritz crackers that I crushed and mixed with 3 tbsp of butter. Three stars. Good base recipe but needs a good bit of tweaking!

This was a great meal for my family.  My husband and small children loved it.  My only change was that I used a cheddar cheese b/c I didn't have the jack cheese that it called for.  We'll definitely be making this again.

This was just okay.  It wasn't the best.  It was too watery.  I think the broccoli needed to be defrosted and then the water poured out because I think that's what made it too watery.  The green onions also were crunchy and I didn't like that.

This is the first recipe I've used from this website, and I got a great first impression! Me and my family are pretty picky and we all LOVED this recipe! Healthy, filling, cheap, easy, and low in calories, this was perfect for us! The jack cheese was switched for cheddar, here; I think it would've turned out better had I actually used jack like the recipe said as the cheddar wasn't pronounced enough. Also, an additional half cup of chicken was used. Other than those changes, I followed everything else.

I precooked the chicken breasts,then cut into chunks. I also used about fresh broccoli, about 1 1/2 crowns and used about 1/4 cup diced onion.  This is a recipe that can really be changed up and still turn out great!

This was good. I had to use cream of cerlery soup because the kids don't like mushroom, but i think it would have been better with that. I used fresh brocoli so it wouldn't get to watery. served over rice.

We loved it! Just finished eating and it was so simple and tasted so good. I boiled the chicken before hand with celery, onion and salt and pepper then chopped it up and added it to the other stuff and bake and enjoy! We will be using this one again!

Somewhat bland and mediocre.  The basil gave it some depth/flavor.  I also used fresh leeks instead of scallion, sharp cheddar instead of monterey, and then at the very end I topped with shredded parmesan/asiago blend.  This made it much better, but it still needed more cheese, more flavor and less soupiness.

This was an easy, quick, tasty meal. I boiled and cubed the chicken ahead of time and cut the baking time in half. I also didn't use the onion and added more shredded cheese on top. Next time I'm going to add bread crumbs to the top too!

The only thing I did different was use Cheddar. Was a little runny, but I served it over rice so that was perfect.

My husband and I enjoyed this a lot! I used cheddar instead of the jack.  I've made it twice.  Last time I made it my husband was like "we should have this more often" : )

Excellent!  In addition, I added 1 cup of rice, fresh baby carrots, onions and green peppers to the mix and sprinkled the top with bread crumbs.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was sooo good. I rarely write reviews but this called for it.I did as others and pan fried the chicken and boiled the broccoli. Omited the basil and voile...I did bake in the oven for 25 min to get all the juices flowing together and it turned out beautiful....thanx.  I also dont like mushrooms but didnt taste it when cooked...

I cook a lot of time-consuming dishes (quenelles, paella, layered dishes - that sort of thing), but I am looking for easier recipes as I get older. I typed in what I had in the ingredients box, and this recipe came up. It sounded too simple to be any good! However, my daughter (adult) and I liked it - and it was fast! For those who thought it was 'watery' - brown chicken well first, and cook and drain the broccoli first. I covered it with foil so top would not be too brown - used some French fried onions for top. I served it on thin noodles. Thanks for the help!

I used 1/4 cup of milk instead of 1/2 and it turns out less 'runny' and also used boiled fresh broccoli instead of frozen....it tastes good and what I like most about this recipe, it made my mother-in-law 'clean-up' the bowl.

I thought this recipe was great.  The flavor was amazing.  I cooked my chicken first and used fresh broccoli.  I used a medium onion and added 3/4 cup instant rice.  The only thing I would do different would be to steam the broccoli first.  It was a little too hard for my liking.  I will definitely make this again.

It was OK.  Mine was not watery like other raters thought but I added a lot more cheese.  I used fresh broccoli but it got really mushy which was OK for my little ones.  I don't think I would make this again.

This tasted very good, but was very runny at first.  I added some cracker crumbs to try and absorb some of the extra liquid and I cooked it at 400° for the last ten minutes; that did the trick.  However, like the other reviews suggest, I will cook the chicken before hand and make sure the broccoli is well-thawed before cooking.

Despite precooking the chicken it was a bit watery so next I'll remember to steam the brocoli as suggested. I used Italian Seasoning in place of the basil.

My teenagers loved this - I wasn't as impressed, but think I can jazz it up a little more next time around. I'm giving it four since the family wants it again.

I made this and the only change I made was I used Colby/Jack because I just couldn't find just shredded Monterey Jack.  It was very good, and my husband loves it too!  I agree it is watery, next time I'll either precook the chicken or cut the milk by half.  But I will make it again, it was a big hit in my house!

Good comfort food. I cooked the chicken before I added it to the casserole. Otherwise, I made it according to the directions. I would make this one again.

This is a great recipe and has become a standard at my house. I do use fresh broccoli, add mushrooms and frozen peas, omit basil and cover while it cooks. Then I boil some wide whole wheat egg noodles and mix it all together. YUM. :) THX for the recipe

This was excellent but I did change a few things, I added 3 cups of cooked penne noodles, used fresh broccoli and left out the basil.  I didn't have any monterey cheese so I use 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup mozzarella chesse instead.  This was not watery at all but I did end up reducing the cooking time by 6 minutes since the noodles were starting to get a little too crisp (the chicken was perfect).

This was very good. The suggestions on the other posts were very useful. I cooked the chicken before adding it to the rest of the ingredients. I used fresh broccoli, and added some garlic salt for taste. My family loved it! Next time I will double the recipe so that we can have leftovers.

This was pretty good.  I used left-over chicken and pork and fresh broccoli so it wasn't too watery, but I can see how it would be.  I used mild cheddar cheese as that is all I had and I put stuffing mix on top with some cheese which was good, and a little garlic powder as well.  It was easy to make but I find the soups a bit too salty.  I served it over left-over rice.  This was a good way to use up left-over meat.

Awesome!  I followed the recipe as described and my family ate it up and would have eaten more if we had it.  I think next time I will add minute rice to it, just so that it fills them up a little more.  And I'll probably throw in a can of mushrooms just because we love mushrooms.  Great recipe though!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was east and tasted really good. I served it on a bed of rice and my husband pretty much licked his plate. The one thing that I would definetly recommend it putting the basil in. Some people would think leaving a little thing out like that wouldn't matter- but it does. It gives it a great flavor! I used Sweet Basil!

It was very watery. Should the chicken have been cooked before making the casserole? If so, it didn't say to do it.

As far as recipes go, this was okay...nothing spectacular though.  Probably would not make again.

The taste was a bit off and I think it's from the green onions. I didn't find it too watery. Not bad for a low cal meal but I don't think I would make this again. I did add garlic powder and salt, but if anything that helped it. I think that rather than green onions you should just use white or yellow onions.

I love this recipe I do make a few changes just that I use fresh brocolli and reduce the milk by half. I also added sliced fresh mushrooms and before baking I sprinkled the top with cheese. I did not have green onions so I substituted a smaller amount of red onion. Oh also I cooked it on convection oven at 375 and baked it covered for the first 20 minutes then I uncovered it for a crispier top layer.l and cooked until it was bubbles Came out great!

This is a good low carb casserole. I added 1/4 or so salt and next time I would add 1/2 cup sliced buttons mushrooms.

This was an incredibly quick and easy dish that was satisfying while still staying on the healthy side of things.  I added some frozen peas simply because I had them.

I used cooked breast, jalapeno cheese, fresh broccoli, soup & milk. Then I added crumbled Tater Tots on top. Very nice for a cold winter's night.

Husband and I are on reduced starch diet so important to find recipes with no pasta, rice, etc. in them.  I made this and it was tasty.  Followed recipe.  Precooked the chicken and didn't add milk but added a splash of cooking wine.  

It was a bit "hot" and I don't know if it was because of the quantity of pepper or because the cheese I ended up using was Monterrey Jack mixed with Jalapeno pepper.  I might reduced the seasonings or use the right cheese next time, but it was still good.  Mine was not watery at all.  

*threw a few sliced almonds on top for variety. 

Made a nice reheated lunch the next day.

I omitted the curry powder, and I added milk and salt because I did not have any cans of creamed soup. I also used havarti and added mushrooms. Turned out great.

Enjoyed this quick and easy dish. I pre-cooked the chicken, added a tsp. garlic powder, used mozzarella instead of jack, and topped it with fried onions. Will definitely cook again!

I made this with a few variations.  I used two 13 oz. cans premium chunk chicken breast and substituted 1/2 cup plain fat free yogurt for the milk and  13oz. deluxe frozen broccoli florets and used shredded mozzarella cheese.  I drizzled about a tbsp. of milk over it and then I baked it at 350 degrees for about a 1/2 an hour.  Then I mixed 8 cups herb stuffing mix with 2 1/2 cups chicken broth. Spread the stuffing over the casserole and baked an additional 10 - 15 minutes.  Very Good!!

Instead of cream of mushroom I used cream of chicken b/c it is what I had in the cupboard. Also, took others suggestion to defrost the broccoli & I baked the chicken 30 minutes b4 hand. I then mixed all the ingredients and baked for an additional 20-25 minutes. It turned out great. I will definitely make this again. Even my 6yo and 3yo loved it.

Even precooking the chicken and adding the broccoli to it to thaw it, then draining, it was still pretty watery. Cooking it all up front will make it better, at the cost of more time invested.

Followed suggestions to: use a grocery store broiled chicken, cut up bones removed. Used fresh/steamed broccoli. Used shredded cheeses (for pizza - in fridge). Used garlic powder instead of basil. 
Did not come out watery at all. People loved it!.

Tasted okay, but it was a little bland.  I added about 1 1/2 cups of Penne pasta to soak up the excess water people were talking about.  That worked quite well.  Next time, I think I'll add some cashews and more spices.  Overall, it was a good starter recipe.

This was OK but it was watery, like others have said.  I tried to thaw my broccoli a bit before I added it but I just didn't have time to thaw it completely.  I added some rice, which it needed not only to soak up the liquid, but also because the dish lacked substance without it.  What bummed me out the most was that I couldn't even tell there was cheese in it, and I put in about 1 1/2 cups.  How is that possible?  The basil and pepper flavors are nice, but overall this is nothing to get excited about.

My family and I enjoyed this recipe. I found it simple but tasty. After reading the other reviews, I decided to make a few changes myself. I used fresh broccoli, and the prepackaged, precooked roast chicken- which was tastier and more moist than I had expected. I also used a lot more of the broccoli for a more veggie packed meal. This was a very good short-cut friendly kind of recipe.

It was OK. I give it high marks for convenience and delivery of broccoli to a 5 year old. But it was a bit mushy. I did pre-cook my chicken and used fresh broccoli, steamed in the microwave for 3 minutes. If I were to make this again, I would put the broccoli in raw and use less pepper.

I loved this recipe! I didnt have green onion so I didnt use any. I also subituted cheddar cheese for what ever the recipe called for (only because I didnt have any and didnt want to run to the store). At the last 20 min. of baking time I also added some leftover peas I had in the fridge and also added a top layer of cheese and parmesan for the last few minutes and it turned out GREAT! I served it over rice and was a big hit! I even love it as a leftover!

This recipe was easy to make and I liked it but unfortunately my husband did not.  I did substitute fresh broccoli for frozen as suggested by other reviewers and I did not have a problem with it being watery.  I also probably at least doubled the cheese and used a blend of chedder and monterey jack.
