Absolute love. Wouldn't have thought to do this, but will be repeating frequently. I used a chevre gouda instead of the Parm and it was terrific. Can't wait for tomorrow lunch with the leftovers.

Great simple sandwich!  I did saute the asparagus in a little olive oil instead of microwaving.  Nice!

This was really good!  I heated the asparagus for 2 minutes and added grilled red bell peppers.  I also toasted the bread first (we just used wheat bread).  Made one for lunch tomorrow, I hope it holds up well!

Delicious! I used a sesame french bread cut on the diagonal, and lots of fresh shaved parmesean. The asparagus is crisp tender and this really is a great spring appetizer!
Thanks Dakotabear1 for submitting this recipe!

This is one of my favorites now! This tasted much better than I thought it would. I think fresh sliced tomatoes will make it even better next time.

Yummy!  This was a great alternative for using asparagus.  I used sour dough bread and toasted it, placed the mayonnaise on one side and used green leaf lettuce with the steamed asparagus and parmesaen cheese and it was wonderful!  Will definitely use again - thanks for the recipe!

I halved the asparagus spears lengthways, then sliced them into thirds before cooking. I also used lite mayo, and a little more Parm. This was a nice sandwich. Thanks!

I used leftover asparagus for this and my hubby was out of his mind thrilled. Very rare that he comes home from work and raves about the sandwiches I make him. Thanks!

This is a really good idea and as written we found it a little bland.  The second time we left off the butter, added lightly smashed avocado, quite a bit more pepper and a generous squeeze of fresh lime.  Excellent!

Yummy! I just became a vegetarian ( for the 3rd time in my life but hoping this time it will last the rest of my life) and have been looking for new "sandwich" meals w/o meat and this was so good!
