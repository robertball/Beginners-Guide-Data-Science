This is my new go-to recipe for baked beans...AWESOMELY FANTASTIC!!!!!! I did halve the recipe, using 2 cans of pinto beans, drained and rinsed. These were super simple to make and the house smelled soooo good while these were baking. I always get baked beans from a local market that we always considered 'the best' baked beans, but these surpass those, and are waaaaay cheaper to make than those ones are to buy, so that's a bonus. I did measure all of the liquid ingredients and brown sugar, but I did eyeball the onions and red pepper, and I'm sure I used more of those than the recipe called for. If I could give these beans more stars, I would...these are wonderful~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Huge hit.  I made my own beans (from dried) so I could control the salt; I used one pound, not sure how the translates to cups when cooked.

Followed the recipe exactly, with a few small exceptions... I added a bit of liquid smoke in lieu of smoking, and put a splash of bourbon in them for extra flavor.   I also cooked the bacon first, and added the peppers/onions in the last 5 minutes or so.  Why cook them in oil when you have all of that flavorful bacon grease to cook them in?

The flavor was very good, for these baked beans.  I left the bacon out, because I had some people that were vegetarians, that would be eating them; I could have substituted soy bacon, however, for the amount of beans, I was making, the cost would have been very high.  They turned out good without the bacon.

Made this pretty much like the recipe says, but can't afford that much bacon for one dish.  Used about 4 thick slices instead.  Still the flavor of this was very good.  Really enjoyed that!!  But did have a little problem..... In the interest of time, I used canned pinto beans.  Golly, I would have cooked those beans another hour or so!  They just weren't as tender as we would have liked.  Could still eat the beans, but we chewed awhile.  Think this would be terrific with remains of a fresh cooked pot of home cooked beans, seasoned while cooking with ham.

The beans were a hit.  I made them in the oven and not the smoker, but the taste was still amazing.  Great recipe!

I didn't make changes, really, but I made twice, once with light brown sugar and a tangy bbq sauce, and I really preferred those.  Second time I used just a regular bbq sauce and dark brown sugar and they were a little sweet.  Next time light sugar and spicy bbq.

I've made this recipe as written, and I've also added various meats--bacon, ground beef, smoked sausage--DELICIOUS! I made this  at a couple big bbq's, including my son's graduation party--everyone asked for the recipe. I'll make this again and again.

Made this recipe to accompany a smoked beef brisket and served it to family and friends.  It was a HUGE hit with all.  It's got some good spice to it using 2 whole jalapeño's (did not deseed or devein) so some folks felt it had a little too much "kick".

Some changes I made were that I used a 4 bean blend of pinto's, black, kidney and great northern since that is what I had on hand and it brought a great flavor to the dish as well as nice color diversity.  I received many compliments on that feature alone.  

Also, I chose to cook the bacon separately from all the vegetables and then incorporate all the ingredients at the end prior to baking.  This allowed the bacon to crisp much easier and allows you to remove any additional bacon fat if you don''t want all of it in the final product.  I chose to remove about 1/4 of the bacon drippings prior to adding the bacon to the beans and it was awesome!

This won't replace my usual KC style sweet baked beans that is generations old but it will be my go-to for a Texas spin on beans when doing traditional Texas style BBQ.

Thanks for this Amazing recipe, these beans have become a must have when I’m BBQ’ing. I followed the recipe very closely at first with great success and have since made this over a dozen times. I have tried adding yellow and red peppers for a splash of color and sweet heat along with apple smoked bacon! I would recommend cooking the bacon so it’s nice and crispy then adding it to the beans, otherwise it’s just mushy bacon.

Just made these delicious beans for a neighborhood bbq. Everyone LOVED them and want the recipe. I tweaked the recipe just slightly, adding some different beans, but other than that, stayed pretty true to the original recipe. I will make these again for sure.

Excellent recipe. I had folks who weren't pinto bean fans so I made with Great Northern and Navy beans and turned out great!  I also substituted Poblano peppers for jalapeños since had a lot of young kids eating and it gave it great pepper flavor without the heat.

Everybody loved these.  I stayed pretty close to the recipe.  Used turkey bacon due to my wife's aversion to the good stuff and I used extra garlic.  Cooked them in a cast iron dutch oven on the outside stove.   Nice level of heat and sweet for a group picnic.

Awesome beans. Only gave 4 stars because of my changes due to what I had on hand. Would probably be excellent as written.  Here are my changes. Used 3 Serrano peppers instead of Jalapenos. Used canned pinto beans, 2-15 oz Kuners with jalapeno and 1-30 oz regular Kuners drained and rinsed. Also used 1-1/2 lbs bacon and a vidalia onion. All else as written except  I also put these on my smoker for a couple hours to pick up some smoke flavor. Definitely one of the best baked beans recipes I've ever made. Great side dish with the smoked ribs I made. Yummy yummy in my tummy as my youngest daughter says.

They're good, but definitely could have used less beer so they wouldn't be so watery. I will add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce more. Flavor is good.

Loved this recipe! A little labor intensive but well worth the trouble! Using maple bacon is a good option...trust me!
