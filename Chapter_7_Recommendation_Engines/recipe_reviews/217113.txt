This makes a great soft, chewy bread. No crusty outside here.  The oat flour doesn't have its usual nutty flavor in this bread like I expected it to, but it's a good carrier for butter, jelly, deli meat, etc.  My bread machine doesn't have a "normal" time setting because it's based on the size and color of loaf (even on the White Bread setting).  I chose 1.5 pounds and light crust.  Turned out perfect.  Thanks also for the tip about substituting oat flour in yeast breads!

Smells heavenly and nice texture. I did have to add at least 1/4 cup more water, however. Not a big deal since I always check the ratio when it's kneading. I also added 1 tbsp. gluten.

My husband made this first, and it turned out as a lump of flour, then I tried it twice with no better result.  Maybe there is something wrong with our ingredients, but this is the only bread maker recipe I have tried that has turned out like this.

I didn't make this in a bread machine. I made rolls for pulled pork with this recipe. I have to say that the bread was delicious, but not what I was looking for as far as pulled pork. I definately will be making this again so I can slice it up and make toast in the morning with it. Fantastic recipe, thanks for submitting it!

I made this under the dough setting but I changed the recipe some. I did 1 cup wheat flour and 1 and half cups bread flour instead of all purpose flour. I them had it raise in the pan before baking it the oven. I brushed the top with a egg white butter mix. It came out great. I put the ingredients in the pan just as I do any bread machine recipe not like it tells you to. I hope this helps someone!

This recipe was easy and delicious! It helped that I already had all the ingredients. I used the oven to bake the bread instead of the bread machine - still delicious! Made a few extra for the freezer too. Thanks for sharing!

We followed the recipe for the most part, but used oat bran instead of oat flour and added an extra 1/4 cup of water. It turned out great! We put the bread machine on 1.5 pound loaf and medium crust. We recommend light crust because, while perfectly fine, it would be even better with a slightly less crispy crust. Also, once the dough ball started we poured in about a tablespoon and a half of honey. Great recipe. Perfect bread for slicing.

This is a winner! Better than the whole wheat recipe from my bread maker manufacturer. Just a few adjustments to meet my bread maker's recommended method: I used rapid rise yeast and cold water as they recommend. (water on bottom, ingredients on top and yeast on top of it all)

The bread was tender and moist when we ate it 2 hours after it was finished. Not too dry, heavy or chewy. As a vegan, I'm not thrilled about the butter - I'll have to experiment to substitute that ingredient.

We ground our own oat flour in the Vita Mix for this and used wheat flour for the rest. Plus, like another reviewer suggested, we added a little extra water and a teaspoon of vital wheat gluten. Also, we substituted brown sugar for the white sugar since that's what we had. The result is delicious! I braided the bread just for fun, so it looked truly artisan.

The bread did not rise and once the dough baked, it was a crumbled mess. However, the crumbs were very tasty, but it was no way you could call it a loaf of bread.

Try it twice and twice it turn not good. The bread don't leaving up, it's like a brick.  I'll do it in Breadmaker and the second time I try it I put more yeast : same results. I won't try another time!
