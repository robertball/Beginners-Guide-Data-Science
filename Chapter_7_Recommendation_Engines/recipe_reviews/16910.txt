I added some vegetable stock to the poached salmon mixture to intensify the flavour.  My family enjoyed it, so I would do it again, but I would use 3 cups of water instead of 4, and dispense with the cheesecloth-just be gentle on the salmon.

This recipe was just what I needed for a busy day with houseguests. I served rice as a side dish and after the salmon was finished cooking, I poured the juices in the pan over the rice. It was fabulous!

This tasted wonderful but I think the cooking time should be increased a bit if you like your Salmon cooked through.  A fruity Chardonay went well with this dish.  It will appear on my table again.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly. Agreed that this would be perfect with a rich sauce like Hollandaise, but since I wasn't up for making it, I served this hot with the "Elegant Scalloped Potatoes" recipe on this site. The richness of the potatoes really worked with the subtle flavour of the fish. By the way, there's a video tutorial of this recipe in the "Tips and Advice" section - very useful if you've never poached before.

I tried this recipe for a brunch.  It was superb! I didn't precook the onion, carrots or celery.  Just put them in the water with the wine.  It was the hit of the day!

I replaced 2 cups water with 2 cups chicken stock for extra flavour. I also added 2 tbsp fish sauce and 1 tbsp peppercorns, which I thought "kicked it up a notch"! 

NOTE: This is also really good served chilled on a hot summer's day.

Can skip the butter- does nothing for the recipe. Poaching is a gerat way to keep salmon moist, especially if it was previously frozen or is a thin or uneven cut. Added 1/4 of a very juicy lemon squeezed and rind tossed into the pan.

Easy to do and takes fishy taste away.  I served this with a white cream sauce with parsley and chopped hard boiled egg added. (My mother's receipe and she was never wrong.)

The salmon does stay moist but I think it lacked an abundance of flavor.  It's a good base recipe, but needs tweaking.

A little lacking in flavor but good and I added peppercorns and chives. I served it with baked artichoke hearts and tomato slices.

I ended up replacing the celery for more carrots.  This was delicious & healthy!  I served it with a bed of garlic couscous & asparagus.

Not to our liking - dry,tasteless - and I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe I did something wrong, but we won't try this one again.
