Pretty good--healthy way to use up hot dogs. I didn't have any v-8 (I thought I did)so I used tomato puree and shook some hot sauce in it. Close enough. Surprisingly good actually. It could really be good with some parmesan cheese on top. I served it over whole wheat penne pasta.

I didn't try this with hotdogs as I'm not really a fan of them. But I DID try this recipe with Smoked Sausage and it was awesome!! Next I think I'll make it with Brauts. Thanks for the recipe.

I like this recipe right up to the Brussels sprouts! I subbed veggie dogs (meatless franks) for the hot dogs. I was looking for a recipe to use up my Brussels sprouts; I don't really like them that much anyway but I'm trying to branch out. This recipe would really be great with just the onions and franks etc. maybe over a bun! Very inventive recipe and if you like Brussels sprouts you'll like this.

Pretty good. I did not have hotdogs so substituted with fried bologna. Interesting creation!

This recipe is fantastic!! Our family loves fresh vegetables and we are always looking for ways to spruce things up. We added some other veggies like zucchini and summer squash. Before this recipe I would never had imagined that hot dogs would taste so good with brussel sprouts!

Preparation time was a little tedious but was worth it. We left the tomatoes out simply because we had none. Zing-Zang was our choice for the "spicy tomato juice." The final product was recieved well and I thought quite good. Sausages could be substituted nicely. Served over pasta can be a complete meal.

I changed the recipe a lot. Including using mushrooms instead of Brussel sprouts. Instead of a fresh tomato I used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes with spices. Instead of the spicy tomato juice I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce with spices included. Other than those things I pretty much followed the recipe. My whole family enjoys it.
