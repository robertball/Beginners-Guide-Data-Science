Delicious cookies, followed the recipe exactly. Very quick and easy to make. Only difficulty was the candies at the end didn't swirl very easily. But still tasted great.

WOW, quick, easy and a fav with my kids!  It all started with a package of Marth White chocolate chip muffin mix... 

I had a craving for something sweet but didn't feel like making muffins, so I looked up this recipe and made a half batch (because I only had one package of chocolate chip muffin mix to begin with).

Tips:  
~  I added a handfull of *white chocolate chips to add color and make them more decadent. 
~  Definately have to use ROLOS for your carmel candy.  
~  Follow the directions in #2 above, you want to add that carmel immediately after pulling cookies from the oven and before you take them off the cookie sheet.  Doing so helps melt the carmel correctly.  Push it in just enough so that you don't blow apart your cookie. 
~  I then let them sit a minute and go back and delicatlely pushed down on the carmel to help it spread out more, let them sit a few more minutes, then I took a toothpick and swirled the carmel lightly.

This recipe is great! Everyone that try one loved them, but make sure you use a chocolate candy with a liquid caramel or the middle will get hard. Rolos work perfect for this.

I  made these for my hungry co-workers. They were one of a dozen types of cookies that I baked. These were the overall favorite.  Out of 12 different kinds, that's saying something! Several people wanted the recipe. I will definitely be making these again.

They were good. The kids loved them. A bit more cake-y than I expected but still yummy! Kids and hubby said they tasted like brownies.

I don't like sweets but I bake all the time as a stress reliever and just give them away. I can honestly say that these cookies have become my signature. EVERYONE loves them! I even have to have one everytime I make a batch. They're easy, amazing and have helped me leave everlasting impressions with higher-ups! Perfection!
