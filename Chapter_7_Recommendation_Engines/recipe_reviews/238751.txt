Eh, this came out pretty bland which was particularly disappointing given how expensive the halibut was. Definitely healthy, but there was way too much onion and almost no flavor. If I had the ingredients lying around I might try it again, but marinate the fish in the lemon juice/garlic/butter mixture for ~30 minutes before baking.
