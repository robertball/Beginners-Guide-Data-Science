Excellent recipe.  Made a few changes according to reviews- used butter instead of shortening, used rounded teaspoons of spices and included rounded teaspoon of pumpkin spice.  Used whole bag of chocolate chips. Used a generous 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin. Accidentally forgot baking powder.  Still turned out amazing and were eaten in 24 hours.

These are a big hit with my family!  I actually use the entire can of pumpkin and add a little more flour to 'dry' out the batter. I also use half a bag of chips for a single batch, but I rarely make a single batch!  I double the recipe by using a large can of pumpkin, and double the rest of the ingredients. It's quick and easy, and everyone loves it!

These are awesome! I make these every year around this time,they are my husbands absolute favorite! I make a few changes due to personal taste though. I use 1 1/2 cups pure pumpkin, and I use 1/2 cup butter plus 6 T. water instead of the shortening. I also like a bit more of the spicy flavor so I use 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead of the called for spices. You could even add another 1/2 to 1 tsp for an extra kick. I also use 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I use 1 cup chopped walnuts and 1 whole bag of chocolate chunks. Basically just added more of the yummy stuff!DELICIOUS! Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Very flavorful.  I added a bit more pumpkin than it called for to give it more of a pumpkiny taste.  I also added a teaspoon of pumpkin spice seasoning.  My husband's already asking for more.

These are so yummy!!! I saw cookies like these in a store a few days before making them. But they had scary unpronounceable ingredients. Thank you for making life a little more wholesome while staying super yummy! I've made these twice in less than a week. I altered the recipe a little. The first time I made them I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 1/2 cups whole-wheat pastry flour. And since I love spices I added more cinnamon and nutmeg, just a touch of ground clove and mace, about a teaspoon of cardamom, and a few sprinkles of pie spice just for good measure. (Okay so I'm a spice freak I admit it) I used 2 cups of pumpkin puree and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. The second time I baked these I had no more all-purpose flour or shortening on hand so I substituted apple sauce for the shortening and whole oat flour for the all purpose flour. I had to add more flour because the applesauce made the dough moister so I added a little more oat flour and a little bread flour. I didn't measure because I was looking for the correct texture. I also added a tablespoon of flour to the nuts and chips in a separate bowl before mixing them in so they would distribute through the dough more evenly. The first batch crumbled a lot more but was more flavorful. The second batch was still very moist but didnâ€™t crumble. I think the extra gluten from the bread flour help hold them together more. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!! My inner cookie monster is very happy!

The dough doesn't spread, so you might want to press it down like a peanut butter cookie.  Delicious!

Thank you so much for this recipe! I was able to make the best cookies for my dad since pumpkin cookies are his favorite. I doubled the recipe and used a whole can of pumpkin and lots of semi-sweet chocolate chips. For people who think they are too cake-like, that is how they are supposed to taste.

I've been making these type of cookies for years and they're always a favorite of my kids...I don't care for the pumpkin chocolate combo so I substitute the chocolate chips for cinnamon baking chips...the combination is perfect and much better than the chocolate!

These cookies are perfect to make for any occasion! They aren't too sweet, so you can eat more than one without feeling sick. I added a little extra cinnamon.

I'm putting five because the cookie part was perfect.  The only change I made was using white chips instead of semisweet (seemed more palate pleasing to me), and it was a great change!  My husband made these for me and they turned out superb.  Matter of fact, they're all gone!

As many reviewers suggested, I used 1/2 cup butter in leiu of shortening and these turned out to be beautiful and delicious!  Slightly cake-like only because they are light and airy-- they are much better than other pumpkin cookies which tend to be dense.  After making one batch, I couldn't resist making not one more, but two more batches!  A+

I make a recipe almost exactly like this one, but I like mine better because the cookies spread out a little more and have more flavor.  Instead of shortening, I use 1/2 cup (1 stick) margarine and I reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  I also add extra chocolate chips (semi-sweet) because I like lots of chocolate.  Awesome cookies!

These soft, moist pumpkin cookies looked and felt like "muffin tops" rather than cookies and we enjoyed making and eating them.   I did use real pumpkin rather than canned and the recipe turned out just fine.

My husband did not like the chocolate chips as he felt that they overwhelmed the pumpkin.   I agree that it might be better without them, but would not be as popular with the kids.

These are delicious! I substituted the butter/shortening with 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup vegetable oil. The were a big hit with all who ate them. A definite keeper!

I was excited to see I make almost the exact same recipe.  The only differences is I only use 1/2 t. salt instead of 1 t.  I also found Ghiradelli Milk Chocolate chips (instead of semi-sweet) make everything taste better.  I bake them at 375 for 10 minutes.  I also stir everything together except for the pumpkin and flour, alternating them at the end (half the pumpkin, then half the flour, half the pumpkin, half the flour).  THESE COOKIES ARE A BIG HIT!

I supervised my 11-year-old son making these for "life skills" a.k.a. "excuse to make yummy treats" part of his homeschooling.  We used fresh cooked pumpkin, since I had it on hand.  They turned out delicious.  Next time we will use parchment, though.

My husband and I *just* made these, and they are so yummy!  Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies were my dad's favorite, so I really wanted to find a great recipe with an end result similar to the ones he used to buy from ZCMI in Utah.  These are very close!  Next time, I think I will use a bit less nutmeg, since I'm not a huge fan of it, and perhaps a bit more cinnamon.  And while I love the semi-sweet morsels I used, I might try raisins or even cranberries instead of chocolate, for a fun Autumn harvest-y twist!  Wish I had read the previous reviews BEFORE making these, because I also would have used more pumpkin, too!  But, these are delicious, exactly as directed.  Thanks for a great, easy-to-make recipe!

4.5 * I've made this recipe over and over again, and the cookies are a huge hit! The reason I sisn't give 5* is because I don't think the cooking time is long enough; after 15 minutes I found some of the cookies very under cooked in the middle. 17/18 min depending on how big they are. I'm into enduro and off road dirt bikes, and these puppies are a huge hit at the track with adults and kids, and my coworkers love them. "It just isn't fall until we get pumpkin cookies!" They are SO worth the effort (which really, isn't that much; they're very simple to make).

I made these and messed up the recipe but they still tasted really good.  I used butter instead of shortening and I accidentally added a whole can of pumpkin instead of 1 cup.  I also put in 1/2C brown sugar and 1C white sugar so when I added too much pumpkin I added about 1 1/2Tbs more brown sugar and I did a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon.  I will make these again and I might add more pumpkin just because I like a strong pumpkin taste and I will probably add a little more of the spices next time too.  I will definitely make these again though.

Easy to put together, but considering how the amount of spices going into these cookies, there isn't much flavor.  Soft cookies - disappointing flavor.  I won't make these again...sorry.

I was going to make these myself but I went into labor, so I gave my mom the recipe and had her make them for me when I was at the hospital.  OH MY GOODNESS these were so good!!  Very light and cake-like.  Even the nurses were eating them on me!  My whole family loves them.  We prefer them without the nuts and with extra chocolate chips.  The best!  UPDATE 8/8/2010 I add extra pumpkin to these= the whole can is fine, and they spread out beautifully.  Also I use a whole bag of choc chips.

These we're amazing! I have been looking for a recipe that wasn't too casket and these had the perfect moist consistency I was looking for. I took the advice of other commenters and substituted butter for shortening, added more pumpkin and spices (including addition of pumpkin pie spice).

I did one batch of these but I only put chocolate chips in about half of my batch. The cookies without the chocolate chips were okay...I could taste the pumpkin and spices and they were the texture of a cake almost. The ones with chocolate chips just tasted like chocolate totally overrode the pumpkin flavor. Overall they had a lukewarm reception with my family and I will probably not be making them again.

This is a yummy easy-to-follow recipe.  I did tweak it though after reading some reviews.  I added 1 tsp ground ginger and a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  I also used butter instead of shortening, and mini chocolate chips instead of large ones. This gives the recipe just the right balance of pumpkin, spice, and sweetness.  I took them to work and they were gone in about two minutes, everybody went crazy over them!

I doubled it and used a large can of pumpkin.  For one cup of sugar, I used brown sugar.  It didn't cream very well, but no big deal.  For the (doubled) spices, I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, and some sprinkling of cloves and allspice, just for fun.  I also used guittard milk chocolate chips.  Next time I might use a package and a half, because the chocolate chips were very scanty.  This was sooooo good!  Made me feel like an amazing cook and they were gobbled up fast!  I love the cakey texture and the spices and sugar and flour (and everything else) ratio was perfect!

Awesome cookies.  Just changed the shortening to butter and added Craisins along with the chocolate chips, also used pecans instead of walnuts.  I'm going to try it next with a combo of craisins, dried apples and pecans; no chips.

I used butter, 1 cup w/w flour, 1 cup all purpose and 1/2 cup oats and reduced the sugar to 1 cup (used brown). I only used 1/2 cup pumpkin since that was all I had so I cut the spices to 1/2 tspn each.  I omitted the walnuts and used 1 1/2 cups choc chips. A little cakier than we like, but very good!

What a fantastic recipe. I love extra spices so I added a teaspoon of pumpkin spice also and that elevated the pumpkin taste. It made the recipe that much better.  It also yields a lot which I personally like. This recipe is a huge hit every year!

I have never had so many people ask for this recipe!  YUM!  I think the smaller chips would blend better since the cookie 'meat' is fluffy and cake like. If you double, only do 4 cups flour and not five and just use one can pumpkin. Butter, not shortening, will give it a fuller flavor and taste better. Enjoy!

I love this recipe. I make some changes, I used 1/2 cup butter and a whole can of pumpkin, I omitted the nuts and used real semi sweet morsels, sometimes I add rasins.I also at more spices ( nutmeg, cinnamon or just use pumpkin pie spice) I really like the texture which is soft but its holds it shape well.  everytime I make these I get good comments on them.

My crazy cousin's girlfriend works at a chocolate chip factory and he gets us these delicious real dark chocolate chips for this recipe.  I always use my own garden-grown, home-roasted pumpkin puree.  Makes them extra moist and delicious.  Its vital not to make them too big, other-wise they get cake-y on the inside.

I came across this recipe as I was craving something sweet.  Luckily I had all the ingredients available and whipped up a batch.  Fantastic flavor and easy to make recipe!!  I added the caramel icing  from another pumpkin cookie recipe I found on this site.  I wish I had doubled the batch as one reviewer suggested.  I will add this to my "keep" file.  I did 1/2 butter/1/2 shortening for the shortening amount as other reviewers mentioned.  This is a perfect fall cookie.  I will be baking several batches to give to neighbors and friends at Thanksgiving.

I made a few subs. I used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white, 1/2 brown flour and 1/2 white and I didn't have any nutmeg so I added 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/2 tsp ginger. My son's friend said they were the best cookies he's ever had (although, they are quite possibly the only fresh out of the oven cookies he has ever been served) and his other friend gobbled up 4 in the blink of an eye.

I don't really like these... but my boyfriend loves them and I make them for him.  I use the whole can of pumpkin and add some extra flour to the mix.  I always end up having to cook them longer than the recommended amount...and they still come out a little doughy.  My boyfriend prefers them after they've been chilled in the fridge for awhile.  If I liked Pumpkin Choc Chip cookies, I'd like these. =)

Amazing!  They are more cake-like than cookie-like, kind of like muffins.  To make sure they weren't dry I took the advice of other reviewers and upped the pumpkin to 1 1/2 cups of canned pumpkin.  Subbed half of the all-purpose flour with organic whole-wheat flour and still tasted great, as well as subbed half the white sugar with brown sugar.  I also added an extra 1/2tsp of cinnamon, an extra 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a 1/4tsp of ground cloves too.  Next time I'll decrease the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup and increase the walnuts to 1 cup, since I thought there were too many chocolate chips and I really like walnuts!  And I'll add maybe a 1/4tsp of ground ginger as well.  I TOTALLY recommend these--me and my boyfriend gobbled them up!

These cookies are absolutely amazing!!! To make it a little more healthy I substituted with whole wheat flour, upped the pumpkin to 1.5 c., used 1/2c. brown sugar and 3/4 c. Splenda, and two egg whites.  I didn't have any nutmeg so I substituted it with pumpkin spice, and it was delicious!!! I didn't use nuts this time, but I think I definitely will the next time--would be a great addition.  This gets one big thumbs up!!!!

I enjoyed this cookie for its texture and unusual combination of pumpkin and chocolate chips.  The recipe adapted well to using applesauce in substitution for half the shortening for a lower fat version.  Yum!

This is the exact recipe that my Great-Grandma made and passed down to our entire family. It is never fall until I start making these cookies!

Awesome! Better than the old recipe I used to use! I made a few changes though, I added a tablespoon of milk, a bit more cinnamon, a dash of pumpkin pie spice and used mini chocolate chips. Came out great! Will definitely be making these again!

Very comforting cookies! I did follow the suggestion to use butter instead of shortening. Also, i used half white sugar and half brown sugar and added a 1/2 tsp ground ginger. They were delicious. These cookies are great for kids because of the soft, cakey texture. They are a lunch box favourite in the fall.

OH. MY. GOD. I'd give these 6 stars if I could. I am a pumpkin fanatic and these are incredible! The only changes I made were: using 1/4 c butter and 2 tbsp plain, non-fat yogurt instead of shortening and instead of 1 tsp nutmeg, I used 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ginger. I also omitted the walnuts because I didn't have any on hand. Yum!

Tastey, although I think I'd like them more with white chocolate chips. I followed the recipe exactly except I forgot to grease the cookie sheet, but they didn't stick at all. Next time I think I'd add 3/4 cup of chocolate chips instead as some had only 1-2 chips in them. Only made about 3 1/2 dozen for me.

I wanted to give these 3.5 stars but it wouldn't let me.  I liked these cookies. They didn't wow me but they were tasty.  I took the advise of other reviewers and used butter instead of shortening. Also, I went a little heavy on the spices. I think I added a bit too much nutmeg so I'll probably go lighter on that next time.  Also, I didn't add the full cup of chocolate chips. I thought it looked like a lot in the batter so I stopped at 3/4 C.  However, it was not enough. Some cookies didn't have more than one or two chips. They are best eaten fresh or from the fridge.

These were good. Very light. I used half whole wheat flour, and they were still puffy and soft. Would probably add more pumpkin and more spice next time. I subbed all the spices for pumpkin pie spice, and it could have used more. Thanks for sharing!

I unfortunately did not care for these nor did my family.  The flavor was a little bland so I added about 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, batter then tasted real good but when I baked them the texture was not right, I did use butter however in lieu of the shortening; that could have played a small roll in this less than stellar cookie.

These are really flavorful and tasty!  My friends and I absolutely loved them.  One thing I did differently--I did not have chocolate chips on hand so I used butterscotch chips instead.  Also they seemed to take a little longer than 15 minutes to bake for me.  Next time I will try chocolate chips, but either way they are just great.

These were just okay. Very cakey which is not what I like in a cookie. I couldn't quite taste the pumpkin flavor. They tasted like cakey chocolate chip cookies with a funky flavor in it.  I followed the recipe exactly. I will not be making them again.

When I saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it!! I love pumpkin and I love chocolate, so this was pretty much perfect to me. So moist from the extra scoop of pumpkin I added, but other than that I followed to recipe exactly as written. Delicious!!

I made three good changes: substituted 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening, added a pinch of cloves, added more choc. chips.  Because these are very cake-like remember that they won't "spread out" like regular choc. chip cookies do. Therefore, don't drop them on the sheet too tall, but spread them out a bit if you want them to more cook evenly.

This is a great recipe. Turned out perfect.I made it for family that came over last nite. My husbands cousins luved them. I wasn't sure how pumpkin would work with kids as my critics, but they luved them. I gave them some to take home thats how much they luved them. 
I added lots of canned pumpkin as some of the reviews said to do. and so i added more flour to get the cookie dough consistancy. I also added pecans for some crunch.I used the mini chocolate chips because i find they disperse in the batter better than the regular chips. With those i find u only get a couple chips in a cookies b/c they are big.  I will be making this again soon. I love fall and well these are perfect as a fall dessert. Fall flavours fill my home when I bake them. The cinnamon and nutmeg are lovely.They come out awesome, soft and delicious. Thanks again.

My family has always loved Pumpkin Chocolate Chip cookies from the bakery, but the high price of them sent me in search of a recipe I could make at home.  The first time I tried out the recipe the only change that I made was using butter instead of shortening (which I do not like).  They turned out great and everybody loved them.  The second time I substituted the butter with applesauce for a healthier cookie, and added food coloring to make them more orange.  The cookies turned out soft and wonderful, and nobody missed the butter.  The only other change I will make is using  a bit less nutmeg, as I found it overwhelming.  This recipe is a keeper!

We loved these cookies! However, my first batch nearly burned at 15 minutes. 10-12 was a more appropriate baking time and I also made them a bit larger.

Pumpkin chocolate chip cookies are some of my favorite cookies.  I made some alterations to the recipe-
I used 6 Tbs shortning, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, 1- 15oz can pumpkin (which is about 1 1/2 cups), 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 pumpkin pie spice.  I also used a mixture of milk chocolate chips and white chips, and baked on a Silpat.  My husband said they were by the far- the best I have ever made.  They do come out pretty sweet, so if you don't like cookies too sweet, I suggest cutting back on the sugar.

Fun twist when compared to the original chocolate chip cookie.  So yummy.  I used nearly an entire bag of chocolate chips.  I will most likely add more walnuts next time too :)

I hate to say this but these were gross. I have no idea how anyone could rate these 5 stars. I did use pumpkin pie filling, which should only have made it more flavorful. Too cake like, and too bland. I wasted time and $ on this.

These turned out better than expected!  They are sort of cake-like in texture.  I used mini-chips instead of large ones.  The big ones I think might overpower the cookie.  Also, I smoothed cream cheese icing over the tops of them.  I think they would have been a bit bland without.

This was NOT the pumpkin chocolate chip recipe I was looking for. Really cake like consistancy and NOT the moist kind you buy from the store. The only reason I didn't give it one star was because the person I gave them to as presents said they were good and so did my husband but they were way too dry for what this cookie should be like.

I think it's my own fault these didn't turn out at a 5 star rating. I used pumpkin pie filling (which has some added ingredients) instead of just canned pumpkin, so there is not a whole lot of flavour to these cookies. They're still tasty, just not the "5 star" I was expecting.

Sorry, I won't be making these again.  These are more like a type of pumpkin bar (not really cookie texture) with some choc chips - what I was looking for was a choc chip cookie with background pumpkin flavor.

This cookie was requested by a Marine buddy of my Marine Hubby... I have never heard of it or made it before but lo'an behold here it is!! And it is GREAT! OoH-Rah!! I tweaked with it just a little bit... I used roughly 3/4 of the can of Pumpkin puree (didn't use a measuring cup),I put in a full bag of chocolate chip morsels (12oz),1/2cup of butter flavored shortening and 2 teaspoons of the pumpkin spice instead of the individual spices called for in the recipe. The dough rises high when baking insted of spreading so keep that in mind if you are packing for presents or shipments. I got compliments of "Just like Mom's...where did you get the recipe?"

I got rave reviews for these cookies - but took the previous reviwers' comments to heart by adding an extra 1/3 Cup of pumpkin and almost doubling the spices and chocolate chips. The cookies were like mini muffins, they were so soft!

Everytime I make these cookies they are gone in seconds!   Everyone loves them and asks for the recipe.  A tip though- after the cookies are cooled, store in a ziplock bag or sealed container.  They are better the second day and very moist.

I love pumpkin anything, so I had to make these cookies.  They aren't very pumpkinny but they were still good.  I think the cake like texture comes from the shortening as opposed to butter.  I followed the recipe exactly and have to agree with other reviewers that it's a little bland.

I hate to say it, and I must have done something wrong but these were VERY bland and I doubled the spices (and then went back and added even more before cooking the next batch).

A good cookie but it had sort of a cake-like texture and the pumpkin flavor wasn't very noticeable.  The walnuts were a nice addition.  I used a mini-ice cream scoop to make the job go faster and got close to 5 dozen cookies.

These are pretty good.  It's just really hard to beat plain old chocolate chip cookies.  The pumpkin taste just distracts from the yummy factor.

Very tasty, you'll love these! My only problem is that "drop by teaspoonful" isn't very exact. How do I really know the nutritional stats when serving size is vague? Still, they're very good...I doubled the recipe and used a 15 oz can of pumpkin. The dough was soft, but no spreading at all. I was surprised at that.

Following other reviews, I just added 2 heaping tsp of pumkin pie spice. I split the sugar between white and brown. I used 1/2 a cup more pumpkin and had to balance it with 3/4 flour to get the right consistency. I used a whole bag of dark chocolate chips. I also substituted butter for the shortening. They did spread some but turned out delicious.

Wow, I just made these cake-like cookies making some suggested changes per comments and they are so delicious!  Used unsalted butter instead of shortening, 3 cups of flour,   3/4 c. white sugar, 3/4 c. brown sugar, one can of pumpkin, 1 tsp. each of nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, and allspice and one bag of chocolate chips (left everything else the same).  These are for a dessert table for my nephew's wedding!  My house smells wonderful!

I'd give these five stars with the modifications I made. I replaced half the shortening with butter to add more flavor. These are the perfect type of cookies to use shortening in though, as you want the height and tenderness that shortening yields, so I didn't want to take it all out.  I also swapped a half cup of sugar for dark brown sugar for more flavor, and cooked the tinned pumpkin in a skillet for a few minutes to get rid of the tinny flavor and cut down on the wateriness and up the pumpkin flavor. I used a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and a few extra shakes of cinnamon. I baked at 375 for 12 minutes, but mostly because I live at 5,000 feet. I got great reviews from tough critics.

this recipe needs to be a 10!! Its like a COOKIE/CAKE and way too addicting. Therefore if you are trying to gain weight I highly reccomend  making these on a regular basis!!!              Now there is one major change here, I always double this recipe and when i do I always use mini chocolate chips . Inwhich the recipe would call for 4 CUPS of those babies. If i used that many i would have a bunch of chocolate blobs on a cookie sheets with an occasional cookie crumb on it..... Instead I use 1 cup of mini chocolate  chips for a double  recipe and trust me u get more then enough chips per cooky. A double recipe makes about  76 cookies. I  spoon them out by the heaping teaspoon of dough takes 7 minutes per batch in my oven......Also if you do not want to bake all of those at the same  time  i make my own break and bake. i lay them out on my cooky sheet as if i am going to bake them but cover with wax paper then put them in my deep freeze for awhile and when frozen i pack them between wax paper and put them in air tight container and put them in the freezer. then when ever we feel like home made cookies i will grab out a dozen or two and within an hour they are ready to go in the oven!!!!  HOT and YUMMY

We love them!  I forgot to buy shortening and used butter instead and they were fine.  A little different texture but still tasted very good.  The recipe only calls for 1 cup of chocolate chips but I doubled it and I think we still could have used more.  I also would have added just a little more cinnamon or maybe a pumpkin spice to get more of a pumpkin taste.

It was a normal Monday night when nothing was going on. Until I found the pureed pumpkin in the fridge. I wanted something pumpkin-y but family tradition dictated that it was still too early in the year for pumpkin pie (of course). Needing to satisfy my longing for pumpkin I immediately started scrolling my favorites and I found this recipe. These cookies were amazing. I doubled the recipe and my large mixing bowl filled right up. We had all the ingredients for these already in the house and they were super easy to make. The recipe would have been able to satisfy my six siblings and my parents even without doubling it (which is a miracle in of itself). I didnâ€™t have enough vanilla but they still tasted wonderful. I do think I might have done something not quite right because they ended up a little flatter and denser then they probably should have been, but hey, Iâ€™ll take what I got.

I use butter and a 1/4 tp. of ground cloves.  My 21 year of grandson's favorite cookie.   He's moving to TX and I'll send the recipe along for his fiancÃ© to make for him!

My Grandma use to make these cookies and I have been trying to find a recipe similar to hers, and this is it. The only thing I did different was I used a whole can of pumpkin, and they turned out perfect. Next time I'll probably use a little less nutmeg.

made a few changes taking into consideration what others had done.  Used butter instead of shortening.  1-1./2 cups of pumpkin and half whole wheat flour.  A heaping tsp of 
cinnamon.  I also used 1 pkg of Ghiradelli 60% bittersweet chip and added 3/4c. of raisins instead of nuts.  I didn't have time to bake cookies, so spread the dough in a jelly roll pan and baked them for 25 minutes at 375.
They were yummy!  Very cake-like.  Will make these again!

I used butter instead of shortening and these came out fluffy and soft.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Since it is just me I ate a few and bagged the rest for the freezer.  I have Vitamin A cookies for snack now :D

I loved this recipe! I followed some of the instructions of the comments like adding 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, then halved the nutmeg and cinnamon. I also added 1 1/2 cups of the canned pumpkin because my family loooooves pumpkin. I also did 3/4 brown sugar and 3/4 white sugar. I think brown gives it a little more flavor than white. They came out perfect and were gone in a day! Definitely doing this recipe again for my fall party!

I found these lovely, but a little dry and cake-like. Next time I'll use a little less baking powder, less baking soda, and perhaps a tablespoon more butter.

We didn't use the chocolate chips because I don't want to know what chocolate and pumpkin taste like.  Used a heavy hand with the walnuts and cinnamon and they were divine.  We don't ice them either.  Just so darned good.

they were o.k. We are going to eat them anyway, don't want to waste the pumpkin and chocolate chips.  If I were to make them again, I think I would do what iknudsen did and change it to butter instead of shortening. and use a lot more chocolate chips and nuts.  And definitely more of the pumpkin spice.

I had never had pumpkin chocolate chip cookies before, so decided to try them. My boyfriend likes this type of cookie. The only change I made was the sugar. I used 1/2 brown sugar, as I'm not a big fan of refined sugar. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I love these cookies with the walnuts added! They are cakey, but moist and delicious!

Very, very good flavor.  I used butter instead of shortening, and 1/2 C. golden raisins instead of the nuts.  They did spread a little on the pan, which I wanted.  I hope to eventually find a chewy pumpkin cookie recipe instead of cake-like, but this one is a winner in terms of the flavor.  I will use this one again for sure.

I make this recipe exactly as is and thought they were great.  The only thing I would do different next time is add more chocolate chips.  Some of the cookies ended up only having 1 chip in them.

I have used this recipe time and time again and folks can't believe how good they are!  I always double the recipe and use one large can of pumpkin. I use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, and add 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.

I needed a way to use up the rest of some canned pumpkin- and this was the perfect way! I didn't change anything and they were perfect. Pumpkin and chocolate chips is one of my favorite flavor combinations, so I loved these. They're very moist! :)

These are truly amazing.  Made a double batch and they were gone the next day...neighborhood kids devoured.  Took others advice and substituted butter for shortening, reduced nutmeg to 3/4 tsp.  And if you like nuts, definitely add the walnuts! Don't forget to grease cookie sheets.  Off to make another batch now!

These are good...not as cakey as some others I've made before.  I used white chocolate chips...and while I don't like them as well, they are disappearing around here and were a hit at a party last night.

Just made these and they came out better than I anticipated.  I had tried some of the batter and I thought it tasted strange, but out of the oven they were delicious!  I used butter flavored shortening and replaced 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour.  I was wary of the 15 minute baking time, but it was perfect.  Glad I tried these- will make again.

This is a wonderful recipe.  These cookies don't last the week (and I'm talking about a double-batch)!  They are really good with the chocolate chips but they are also really good without them!

These cookies were great!  I didn't quite have enough pumpkin, but they still turned out great.  They were still soft the next day.  A definite keeper!

I love to cook these in the fall, but I get requests for it at other times of the year as well.  I add more chocolate chips though b/c we love chocolate chips and I use butter instead of shortening b/c of personal preference.  Delicious!

These went over very well with our children and friends.  They disappeared very quickly.  After the first batch, I flattened them with my fingers prior to baking them.  Very good

ok I was leary of these at first because I don't like pumpkin cookies I have to admit their not bad. I used butter instead of shortening, I think it helped them spread out more. Also I added 1 tsp. pumpkin spice to the other spices and increased the pumpkin by i/2 cup. My son won't stay out of them, I'm having a hard time too.

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes. Perfect for Fall and absolutely delicious. I make them without the walnuts and it does not sacrifice the taste. Enjoy with cocoa or hot cider.

I found this recipe after a co-worker had made some pumpkin chocolate chip cookies and needed a fun recipe for thanksgiving. I was so thankful that I printed this recipe instead of the one she did because these where much better. I have since made them 3 times and have handed out the recipe to over 7 people. They were also a huge hit at my daughter's pre-school.

My kids loved these cookies!

I made them with fresh pumpkin puree I had leftover from Thanksgiving.  I added additional cinnamon and used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg.

Next time, I will try making them with butter instead of shortening, and will substitute 3/4 of the white sugar for brown.

I will also omit the chocolate chips, I think they took away from the great pumpkin taste.

I love these cookies!  They are moist and yummy.  I made them for a couple of my friends for their birthday, because pumpkin chcolate chip is their favorite cookie, and they pretty much devoured them in one day!  The same thing happens when I bake them for a party.  People just rave about them, and they don't last long.  Definitely make them a bunch, and recommend them to everyone!

I love everything pumpkin so I had to give these a try...the recipe makes a good cake like cookie...I used the whole 15 ounce can of pumpkin to enhance the pumpkin taste I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg and cinnamon...I wish they were a little moister maybe I cooked them too long next time I will add raisins thanks for the recipe.

I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup and swapped 1/2 cup of whole-wheat flour for white to make small nutritional improvements. Taste came out great. Dough was a little stiff - perhaps the wheat flour? Cookies are quite good though not super attractive (maintained their dropped irregular shape).

My husband, who is not a big fan of pumpkin, really liked these cookies.  He would recommend more chocolate chips!
