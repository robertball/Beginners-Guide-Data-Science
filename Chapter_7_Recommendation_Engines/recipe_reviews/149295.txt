AWESOME!!! I did cut the paprika and salt down to 1/8c each, just seemed too much to me. And I did 3/4c brown and 1/4c white sugar. Rubbed on flank steak 20 mins before grilling last night and it was sooo good. Prepped ribs by peeling membrane, rubbed with 1/4c apple cider vinegar and 1ts liquid smoke... This really tenderizes the ribs. Then, rubbed GENEROUSLY with Wally's Rib Rub, double wrapped in foil, in frige overnight. Cooked according to AR's Scott Hibb's Amazing Whisky Grilled Baby Back Ribs from this point on. BEST RIBS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! I'm gonna repeat the process exactly tonight with a pork loin for tomorrow's Sunday family dinner... I have no doubt it too will be extraordinary =) ***UPDATE: Pork loin came out GREAT! Did everything exactly the same (Wally's Rub, then Scott Hibb's sauce and method).  Gonna do it again tonight with chicken breast. That makes 4 nights in a row we've used this rub! Steak, Ribs, Pork Loin, and now Chicken... Maybe Salmon tomorrow...? =) P.S. ONE batch has sustained us all of these meals.

I thought this spice mixture was amazing.  I didn't rub the ribs and let them sit overnight and will do that next time.  I rubbed the ribs, wrapped them in foil and backed them at 200 for four hours and then put them on the grill and slathered them with bbq sauce.  The ribs were tender and oh-so flavorful.  This is definitely a keeper.

This Rub is the Best! Excellent! Omitted the ground cayenne pepper.
Absolutely the best Rub I have ever ate!
Used it on grilled ribs. They turned out finger licking good. We did'nt even need any kind of dipping sauces.  I will definitely be using this rub again and again. Would probably even be good on baked or grilled pork chops. No more store bought rub for me!

This is my FAVORITE rub now. I use this on everything (i.e. steak, chicken, flank or skirt steak, ribs, and pork). This taste great on all meats. A dinner guest told me while eating it how wonderful it was and wanted to know the recipe. Even if you can't marinate it for hours, it's still incredible. I use it on the meat and then add olive oil before grilling. Thank you for posting this.

Love, love, love this rub!  I am rating it 5 stars because it is JUST that good; however, I did have to make a minor change.  When I made the 1st batch exactly by the recipe, it was WAYYYYYYYYY to salty, so I made another batch without salt at all, combined the two batches and it was DELICIOUS (not to mention I now have enough rub to last for a long time!).  So I highly recommend cutting the salt by half.  You can always add more if it is not enough for your liking.  After tasting these, most people I cook them for don't even bother with the BBQ sauce!

Good rub, although I did prepare the ribs a little differently.   Rubbed the ribs with the spice mixture, put them on top of sliced onions on a large baking sheet, poured about a half can of beer on them, covered tightly with foil, and baked for 1-1/2 hours in a 350 degrees F oven.  Then finished them off on the grill, basted with BBQ sauce, until they were crisped up, about 15 minutes, and served with extra BBQ sauce.  Baking the ribs first cooked off the fat, and the ribs were succulent and flavorful.  I cut back on the salt and cayenne, and will be using this rub in the future.

I originally thought there was too much sugar, but the ribs came out great!  I will make a double recipe next time to keep on hand in an air tight container.

Very good rub. I found it tasted a bit too sweet when I was `checking`it, but once on the meat I did not find the sweetness overpowering at all. I put the rub on the ribs the night before, then baked them on low int he over for 2 hours. Transferred to grill for 5 min a side and they were falling off the bone! Delicious!

I cut the sugar down to 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar to make it a bit healthier.  The ribs were fantastic!

This is a FANTASTIC "starting" point for making your own rub and this is easily to customize.  I cut back on the pepper as hubby does not like spicy and I used very little salt as I prefer to use fresh cracked sea salt but I had been buying my rub for years and tried this and all I can say is IT ROCKS!  THANKS A MILLION for posting this......as a matter of fact I have country ribs in the oven right now!  Awesome rub Wally!

i used regular table salt and this is WAY too salty.  I would reduce the salt by 75%.  (was this supposed to be kosher salt?)  Otherwise, the spice combo was good.

Used on pork ribs that we smoked and they were delicious! Not too spicy and not too sweet. Great combo.

Okay so I have been making ribs for years, but this was a first for me!!  I took the advice of another reviewer Starlet and I used the recipe for Wally's Rib Rub and then I made Scott Hibbs Amazing Whiskey Grilled Baby Back Rib BBQ sauce (OMG).  I cooked the ribs by baking them for 2hrs in the oven @250 then put them on a low temp on the bbq and basted them with the sauce.  By far the BEST ribs I have EVER tasted or made in my life.  After making the home made BBQ sauce, I will NEVER buy a store bought bottle of BBQ sauce ever again!!  I too tried the same recipe on thick cut pork loin chops & skin on, bone in chicken breasts...WOW...

Oh Yeah!!! This rub is incredible!! You don't even need sauce afterward. Try in on your roast in the crockpot, or your stew meat before adding it to your stew, chicken, almost anything really.

Wow. My husband raved over this rub and that just doesn't happen. It was sweet but the heat balanced it out. Due to changes in scheduling this sat for two days before we cooked them. The Hungry Teen didn't like the spice, he said they were too hot.

This is a pretty good rub recipe. I didn't use the paprika though. I'll use it again when I make ribs in the oven for sure. Cut the salt to only about 1/4 of what the recipe calls for too.

My evaluation is that that it is not spicy enough and the sweetness does not have character. It clearly needs more zing if used on ribs that will be smoked at  225 to 250 degrees for five hours. The sweetness is good but it has the character of the white sugar used. I would rather molasses, sorghum or a good brown sugar. Honey would also be an improvement. This recipe needs some work, yet.

Wow, I was looking for a rib rub recipe and decided to try this one. It is simply amazing. I have tried a lot of rib rubs and this was the best one ever. I cut the salt back just a tad and added a tad more hot pepper but this is just my personal preference. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Made this last night and got rave reviews. Didn't have time to set overnight just 2 hours. Cooked 3 hours at 275° then grilled for  20 minutes with BBQ sauce. Only used 1/4 cup of kosher salt. Much tastier than just BBQ sauce.

This Rub recipe was superb!!!  Will be using this anytime I make ribs!  I did cut down on the spicy ingredients, since my family isn't huge on spicy 
food.  I used a honey garlic BBQ sauce with them.  Awesome!

I cut the recipe in half and, even with seasoning liberally, I still have quite a lot of the rub left. I haven't cooked the ribs yet, but I tasted the rub to check the seasoning level and it tasted great. I switched the white sugar measurements with the brown sugar measurements, increased the garlic powder to about 1 1/2 tbsp, and added a small pinch of crushed red chili pepper because I didn't have cayenne pepper in stock. I also used smoked paprika instead of the sweet. I will update once I cook the ribs.

Delicious! I didn't have the time to let it sit overnight, I just prepped it & baked it. Can't wait to try again when I do have time to let it sit. I did however use just 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 3/4 & I used 1/4 cup of salt instead of 1/2. Even my picky 9 year old loved it!

I've been on a quest for a good rib rub this summer. So far this one is the best. I rubbed it in to my ribs and then smoked them for 5 hours at 250. I pulled back on the sugar just a bit and added a little more brown sugar. I'll probably add more spices next go round. I prefer just a little more kick.

Buckeyewalt, Thanks for a wonderful rub. Used it on 8 racks of Baby Backs (tripled the amounts of course) and everyone was happy. Great recipe! Definitely will be using again.

Put rub on the night before so the spices soak into the meat and refrigerate.

I know this is one of the best rubs I have ever tried.  It works from Chicken to pork to beef. It not only gives the meats more flavor it tenderizes a bad piece of meat to a great flavor.  Don't change a thing.

Sorry, but this was way too salty...I will try again, but will reduce the salt way down. Otherwise, I think it would be good.

Good basic recipe.  I changed a few things - added more garlic powder & used part chipolte chili powder.  Also threw in a little onion powder.  Let it marinate overnight and then baked them at 300 for 3 hours, then finished them off on the grill.  They were very tender and tasty!

I have been using this rib rub for a few years now for the slow cook type of ribs and now I am using it for ribs in my instant pot. My only changes are that  I use 1 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar. I also omit the cayenne pepper  and I do use Kosher salt ( diamond brand). I usually put this rub on the ribs 1-2 hours before cooking and put the ribs in the fridge in a large ziplock bag.  I pressure  cook them 25-40 min in the instant pot depending on whether baby back or spare ribs and wow!  I finish them off with barbecue sauce under the broiler for 2 minutes. Best Rub ever!

I didn’t even bother to measure. If you pile this on thick,  make sure to have a lined pan  (parchment is best) because the sugar and fat bake will turn to a candy-like rock in the pan (and if you’re  like me, that’s the best part!). I slow roast my ribs on low heat (225) for 5-6 hours and the bones fall out of the meat.  It’s delicious and makes great leftovers if there’s any left at all.

I made this the other night as a coating for the three racks of ribs I was about to prepare. I took another reviewers advice and used 3/4 Cup packed brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar. I only added 1/8 teaspoon of salt as other reviewer’s advised as well. I then separated the rib slabs into thirds, rubbrd both the front & back down well, then wrapped them in foil and placed them in a 230 degree oven. After cooking them for about four hours, I removed 2 of the packets, poured off the juices, and slathered on the Sweet Baby Ray’s BBQ sauce. Back in the oven for about another 15 mins @350 just to get the sauce coating and served them up. Hubby was amazed! This is the first time I have ever used a rub on ribs, but it certainly won’t be the last. The ribs were absolutely delicious and fell off the bone (we like ours that way). They weren’t too sweet but had a wonderful flavor to them.  And, you most likely have all these simple ingredients in your pantry as well! I highly recommend this run!

Excellent rub.  I work in a high volume buffet.  Customers love this.  I mostly put on my baked chicken, which I brine overnight.  Not too salty as others have complained.  Perfection!

I love this recipe and always use it on my smoked ribs. Everyone I've served them to raves about them and my family will not order ribs in even the best of restaurants anymore. I admit, I've adjusted the recipe a bit: I use only brown sugar, I add the same amount of onion powder as garlic powder, I use Kosher salt and only a couple of tablespoons, and I add a bit of cinnamon; not too much or it overpowers the rub. If there are any leftovers, my wife adds the meat to her pork green chili. Good eats!

The best.  Follow the recipe.  Make sure to use Kosher salt or else it might be too salty.  Plus the course salt make it a better texture to rub.

I was a bit worried about the amount of sugar, but this was awesome! Not too sweet, really terrific! I didn't have the sweet paprika, so I used regular. Served these ribs for company and they RAVED. Looking forward to having them again soon!

I use this to rub my ribs, then bake with a little apple cider vinigar. I then use Al's Kc Masterpiece recipe from this sight to mop my ribs... Excellent combination...
