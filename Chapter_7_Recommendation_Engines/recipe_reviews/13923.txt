I probably won't be making this one again. I am a die-hard Miso Soup lover and this just didn't taste like Miso to me. I kept having to add stuff to it to give it flavor. I don't think it was worth the effort.

Very hearty miso soup. I will increase the amount of Miso in it next time because the 1/4 cup didn't flavor the soup as much as I'd like. Filling and delicious!

Very hearty with all those vegies, not overly brothy like other miso soups. I also nearly doubled the amount of miso paste. We enjoyed it very much.

I wouldn't call this miso soup.  Too much vegitable, the smell of garlic, pepper and olive oil kill the taste and flavor of miso. I would use corn oil, chopped regular hot peppers, no garlic, less amount of vegitables, and more miso. Thin-sliced pork could be added... I guess.

I used this recipe for my first-ever attempt at making miso soup at home.  I had no carrots, so I left them out and added kelp instead of spinach.  It turned out great. The family loved it.

Easy to make.  I made my own dashi with dried bonito and seaweed instead of plain water.  Yum!

I thought this was a great recipe. Very tasty. I added mushrooms and a little green onion. I didn't have Sherry, but I don't think it made much of a difference without it.

What a delicious winter recipe!! We didn't add the sherry as we didn't have any, but it still tasted amazing. We also add vegetable stock and it made it more flavoursome.

This was okay.. But I'll probably try a different recipe next time. I omitted the tofu (because we didn't have any on hand), and increased the miso to 1/3 cup due to the other reviews. I thought the miso flavour was too strong that way, so ended up adding an additional 1.5 cups of water.. All and all, definitely edible, but a little disappointing.

On the advice of other reviewers, added more miso.  This soup was easy and delicious, and my 7 year old loved it.  Added frozen edamame (shelled) the next time, and made it even better.

This is very good.  However, I think there is an error in the recipe.  It calls for 3 cloves of garlic and then 1 Tbsp. of chopped garlic.  I think the 1 Tbsp. is supposed to be chopped ginger.  The instructions mention ginger.
