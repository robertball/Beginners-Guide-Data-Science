I rated this recipe with 5 stars as it is a perfect base recipe.  Anyone can take this, play with it and make it suit specific taste preferences.  If it is too oily, you have added TOO MUCH SESAME/CANOLA OIL.  If it is not spicy enough for you, the ingredients listed are NOT spicy.  You need to add red pepper flakes, curry or other spice of your choice to GET IT THAT WAY.  Not enough flavor for you?  Rummage through your spices and have at it!  A nice twist to the hoisin sauce is to use black bean and garlic paste.  Throw in a little fish sauce.  Play with the veggies.  Have FUN with this recipe!

After eating this meal (I tried it out on the family this Saturday night 3/24/2001), my husband and I talked about it and decided a variation would be good.  This is only a suggestion but, we thought use less ginger (1/2 tbsp would be good), less pasta (probably 4-6 oz), more soy sauce (about 1 tbsp more), more hoisin sauce (about 1 tbsp more), more chicken (I used a 9oz time trimmers box, so I would double that), and add about 1 cup of fresh sliced mushrooms.  I'm going to try that variation next shopping trip.  Otherwise, thanks so much for sharing this recipe, it's totally awesome!  and once you get all the ingredients together...totally easy to cook!

This was really great! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think it needs more vegetables.It is a great base recipe, and if you like more flavor- just add it! I personally like more of a sesame flavor, so I added more sesame seeds. More Bok choy is absolutely necessary! Thank you for the recipe! My husband and I really enjoyed it.

This is one of my husband and I's favorite, go-to recipes. The flavors are bold, the prep is simple and it has a lot of room to play.   We love ginger and always add more. I agree with others that it's low on veggies, so we always add more bok choy, sometimes snap peas, but usually just enjoy its simplicity as is.   *Suggestion: slice the chicken into thin, bite-size strips instead of cubing it (helps if meat is slightly frozen). It allows the meat to soak up the sauce better and over a greater surface area.

My family loves this.  I use the whole bok choy (not just the leaves).  I separate the stalk of the bok choy from the leaves.  Cut the stalks up and cook those with the onions (I use lots of onions too).  Then add the bok choy leaves at the end like the recipe says.

Stunning... however I do find that adding a bit more hoi-sin sauce and soy sauce make the flavour quite a bit stronger.

This was fantastic, it really felt like you were eating out!  I substituted udon noodles for the pasta and added fresh peppers and mushrooms.  You could make this with chicken, beef and or seafood.  I am making this again, and soon!

This is really good.   However, I  used Chinese sausage instead of chicken and I omitted the dry sherry and added more chicken broth since I was using egg noodles.  I also used another clove of garlic and added some marinated fried tofu in there and it was terrific!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. My changes: added some baby bella mushrooms (which were awesome), used some leftover cooked chicken, increased the amount of Bok Choy, added a bit extra soy because I didn't have any hoisin (though I want to try it with hoisin because it sounds really good), and I didn't have any green onions to use. 

The next time I make this (because there will *definitely* be a next time), I'll add even more Bok Choy - I don't think that you can use too much of that in this recipe. Bean sprouts would also be fun.

Very good! I made this as a side to go with my toasted sesame chicken cakes, so omitted the chicken. Needs more oil, I'd double it. Also, I agree with others that it needs more veggies. I used finely cut broccoli and cabbage and shredded carrots.

These noodles were pretty good, but I did modify the recipe a little. Used kale instead of bok choy (because that's what I had) and omitted the sherry (didn't have any). I also added zucchini, mushrooms and green beans and doubles the soy and hoisin sauce. It was a nice change from my usual stir-fry kinda dish.

My family loved these warm or cold!  Omitted chicken and added extra veggies.   Sauteed garlic and ginger in peanut oil then added veggies for stir fry.  Made twice the sauce for 1/2 the noodles and it was plenty tasty.  Topped with cashews.  Will definitely make it again!!!

Pretty good.  I used already cooked breaded chicken breasts, and more than hte recipe called for, so I left out the canola oil and just used the sesame oil.  I also added more veggies, adding more bok choy and a chopped red bell pepper.  Very easy to make, and delicious over pasta.  I added more liquid, as it evaporated quickly and made a flavorful brown sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family really liked this. I however was not a fan but simply because I don't really like the very powerful ginger favor. If you love ginger as my family does then this is perfect!

This was just ok.  But I admit, I did make a couple of changes, I omitted the chicken and added more bok choy.  This was "sweet", I expected the salty taste.  If I make this again I might add a little bit more soy sauce and less hoisin sauce.

A good base recipe that allows for lots of creativity! I used tofu instead of chicken (be sure to use EXTRA FIRM), a whole head of baby bok choy, and some julienned carrots for more color. Also added a few shakes of crushed red pepper, which was great. Reduced ginger a bit, which evened out well with the spice from the red pepper. I'll make this again and probably change the ingredients even more next time. Thanks for a good starter!

Thank you Christine for sharing this. I enjoyed trying it out, but I feel it was lacking in flavor, and maybe needed more hoisin, soy, perhaps sesame seeds, and some asian chili - more flavor for the amount of noodles (used 8 oz)
I threw shitake shrooms in and made a vegetarian attempt. It has inspired me to try more enhancements, next time I will add the chicken as well. Thank you for the fun ideas!

It tasted like a stir-fry. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't recipe-worthy in my opinion. It was really basic & mild.  I wouldn't make this again.

We found this to be kind of bland. It made a lot of food though! I had to use sake instead of sherry because I didn't have any on hand, and teriyaki sauce instead of hoisin because I was out of that too, and I was out of green onions, so that may be why it didn't have enough flavor.

The flavor wasn't enough for the whole dish...more sauce would have been better.

Used a baby bok choy, bean sprouts, thin sliced chicken breast, and fresh, small, shrimp. Love sesame oil and hoisin sauce flavors.

good recipe.  I use the base recipe but add a lot more spice as I have a high tolerance.  I usually add a whole habenero if I have one fresh on hand or marie sharps hot sauce.  The heat and flavour of the hoisin/soy sauces make for a great meal

I only rate this 4/5 instead of 5/5 bc I made some changes. I used 2/3  a box of pasta bc the first time I made it it didn't have nearly enough sauce. In addition, I also double the sauce ingredients and use shrimp instead. I'm now in LOVE with this recipe!

This was not one of my favorites.  I thought the sauce tasted a little odd and was not spicy enough for my tastes.  A quick, easy recipe, but I won't make this again.

Very tasty. I used rotisserie chicken. And added some peas for color. I also added some more bok choy that I stir fried after this was complete to add to it. The bok choy that is called for cooks down so much that it doesn't seem like it is there. A little cornstarch to thicken the sauce and it is perfect. I served with egg rolls and skewered grilled beef and and it was very yummy. The noodles are great warmed up the next day!

Not really that great.  It was pretty tasty, but not really flavorful.  There was no kick, which surprised me because of the sesame oil and the hoisin sauce that I added.  O well, not bad though.

This recipe was not very good. It was either the recipe or my cooking. I am not a very good cook, but usually my meals come out mushy, instead of dry and flaky. Next time i'll add a little more soy sauce.

This had great flavor.  However, I think I will use less pasta next time, and maybe add a little extra sauce.  I also think that a noodle that is slightly thicker than angel hair might be better.

A quick and easy recipe. I added a half a jalapeno diced for a little heat. Next time I'm going to add a red bell pepper. Definitely a keeper for a quick meal.

Excellent stir fry base. I rarely deviate from a recipe but this begged for additions. I added (along with the bok choy) diced orange & red bell peppers, diced broccoli florets, shredded & sliced carrot, radish sticks, and 1/4 a diced red chile pepper. Along with topping it with green onion, I also added sesame seeds. I used vermicelli pasta instead of angel hair simple because it's what I had on hand and it worked great. Also note the ingredient list says chicken broth, but the directions say chicken stock. I just guessed and used broth. This is definitely restaurant quality.

Fantastic!!  I was craving Chinese tonight and this recipe hit the spot!!   I thoroughly believe that the hoisin sauce made the dish. I have never had bokchoi before and figured it would be a waste to buy a whole head just to use two leaves, so I omitted it. I instead added broccoli, julienned carrots, and a bit of shredded cabbagge and it was fabulous! I like my food spicy so I also added a bit of white pepper for an extra kick. It was such a success that my husband actually got 2nds! Kudos!!

I agree with a previous reviewer that this is a really good base recipe.  I followed exactly except I didn't add extra salt and I had no green onions.  Next time I will add a lot more veggies to the mix.  This really is a budget friendly meal.  2 chicken breast and a pound of pasta to feed 4 BIG eaters!  It doesn't get much better than that.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again.

My family thought that this tasted like a combination of a dish from Noodles & Co. and/or Mongolian BBQ. I added an Asian medley mixed vegetable package to the recipe and we thought it really made the dish. Thanks for the easy yet tasty recipe!

This is a great recipe. My boyfriend requests this all of the time! You can add any kind of veggies you want to it and can substitute the chicken for leftover pork or tofu easily. When I made it with tofu I cut the tofu into strips and squeeze the strips over the sink to remove extra moisture. Then I cook the tofu as I would the chicken (until it's browned, about 10-15 minutes). Really gives the tofu a great flavor! Great recipe!

This recipe was pretty tasty.  I never follow recipes exactly - I omitted the soy sauce and made double the sauce.  I also used rice sticks. Next time I'll add in some more veggies, perhaps mushroom and shredded carrots.

This is a good starting point but, as written, I thought it was pretty bland - I added a lot more soy sauce, Hoisin sauce, sesame oil, and also some Oyster sauce. I also threw in a couple of shredded carrots and a handful of beansprouts too. This turned out really good, but it definitely needed some adjustments.

My DH and I liked this, but I don't think it's something we'll eat on a regular basis.  IMHO it needs some more vegetable (maybe some broccoli and grated carrot).  I may try it again, but will add more veg and will reduce the amount of sherry used because I found the flavour to be quite strong.

I wasn't impressed. It just wasn't what the title implied. I haven't tasted take-out like this.

I would make this again.  It was a good meal to bring for lunch.  My only issue was that all the liquid ingredients I added, besides the hoisin sauce, evaporated.

I don't think I'll make this again because it was greasy and bland.  It reminded me of really bad Chinese takeout.  Maybe I've just gotten too used to food with a lot of spice though...

This is delicious, quick, and easy. Especially when we use pre-cooked chopped chicken breast.
