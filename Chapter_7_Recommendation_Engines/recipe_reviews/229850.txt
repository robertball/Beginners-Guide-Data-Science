To give this egg pie a little creamier texture, I used fat free evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I did add a few spices (fresh ground black pepper, little Frank's Hot Sauce, garlic powder, pinch sea salt) and I used pepperjack cheese. We loved this. Very good. This would be a great base recipe to throw in whatever add-in's you like, too. Next time, I think I'll add spinach and diced tomatoes.

I made this for Christmas morning and my husband loved it!  I will probably make this again.  It's just that it's hard for me to find breakfast meat I can eat (nitrates, etc.).  I made it with coconut milk and chorizo and it came out really well.  Not too spicy and delicious.
