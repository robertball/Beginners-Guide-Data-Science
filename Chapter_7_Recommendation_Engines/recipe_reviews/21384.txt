I need to preface this review by stating emphatically I am a Bisquick pancake girl.  It's what I grew up on, it's all I know.  NOT ANY MORE!!!  I love, love, love these pancakes!  They are nice and fluffy and w/a great flavor and texture.  I subbed whole wheat flour and Splenda brown sugar blend for the AP flour and sugar (and I only had old fashioned oats) w/amazing results. I also am not a big fan of buttermilk, so I used 1% "regular" milk.   I am a home made pancake convert, and healthy ones, at that!  THANK YOU for an awesome recipe (DH concurs).  My only wish is that I'd had the ingredients to make home made butter & maple syrup to serve along with them.

I made these this morning before school. It was my first time making my own pancakes, and they were awesome! I made some slight modifications: I used skim milk instead of buttermilk and substituted two egg whites for one whole egg. I also added banana slices to the batter, and topped my finished pancakes with whipped cream, additional banana slices, and a generous sprinkling of wheat bran. Delicious! Probably better than the pancakes I've had at Bob Evans. Thank you for this recipe! 
UPDATE:
I made these again today. Same modifications: skim milk, egg white. This time I also substituted whole wheat flour for white and added more chopped banana than last time. They turned out wonderfully! I love them even more now. Can't wait to eat them in the morning! Next time I'll add some semi-sweet mini chocolate chips!

These were pretty good, kids and husband liked them. I like the addition of the oatmeal. I doubled this recipe, blending the dry ingredients in the processor first, then the wet just to incorporate it. Next time I may add a touch less baking soda or add some brown sugar to hide the baking powder taste (there was a slight taste of it). 
*Update 1* I made these again with 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 2 Tbl brown sugar. They came out great! *Update 2* to this I've also added in 1/4 C. pecans, blended right in with everything else. Delish!

the baking soda was unnecessary.
i used regular milk and it came out just fine.
also, i didn't have a food processor so i just whisked the mixture. pancakes turned out great-- they had a lot of flavor and texture!

I used 1/2 tsp baking soda and thought the recipe was delicious, not bitter at all.  I do recommend mixing the oatmeal and buttermilk first and letting it sit while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

I decided to go healthy and use whole wheat flour and splenda and I still got two thumbs up from my sometimes-finicky five year old.  I separated the egg yolk & whites and beat the whites and folded them in at the end and the pancakes came out light and flufyy. The only thing I would change about this recipe is the amount of salt. As other reviewers have mentioned, they are a bit too salty, at least for my taste. I prefer my pancakes sweet, not savoury.

Good texture, but too much salt.  I'll cut it back to 1/4 t next time.  I also used vinegar and powdered milk as a good substitution for buttermilk.

Very yummy and simple. Has a nice different taste. Added some pecans for a nutty flavor. Didn't have buttermilk, so used 3 teaspoons of vinegar and the rest 2% milk to make total of 3/4 c. Still very good!

Says it serves 4, but we only had 3 pancakes each.  Need to double the recipe to get a good number of pancakes.  We liked them and I will make them again.

Excellent!  These are healthier and more flavorful than regular pancakes.  I took some other reviewer's suggestions and used part yogurt, skim milk and half whole-wheat flour.    I also (accidentally) left out the oil, but we didn't miss it (just made sure I oiled the griddle well!)  I'm looking forward to making these again.

I've tried a number of pancake recipes on allrecipes, and this is my absolute favorite. I use whole wheat flour rather than all-purpose and usually just sour skim milk w/a little vinegar since that's what I have on hand. (Who just has buttermilk sitting around??) I grind the oatmeal in my coffee grinder and usually throw in a couple dashes of cinnamon. This recipe stands up really well to additions as well - I've used this base to make banana pancakes (1 mashed banana) and mixed berry pancakes (a handful of blueberries and 3 sliced strawberries). This recipe has become our Sunday morning routine and it's a little less guilt-inducing than regular pancakes, without sacrificing any taste!

These were a lot fluffier than I expected, and I would make them again. Except note that I think they cook faster / burn more easily than typical pancakes. I was really surprised at how fast they bubbled up on the surface, and I even burned a couple (and I make pancakes almost every weekend)! I'll make again though, but just flip faster and start on medium instead of medium high heat.

I start this review explaining that I live in Spain, so I have only been exposed to the european type of pancake (what french would call crêpe, I guess) so I had never ever before tried the american version. I decided to give it a go with this oatmeal variation, and my only thought is: mom2hhh, whoever you are, and wherever you live, I love you! Thank you for helping me to discover this awesome type of pancake, much easier to prepare than the french crêpe or the russian blinis, and equally superb. Now my only risk is to abuse this recipe and prepare it every single day!

Based on my kids, I gave this 5 stars! My 1 and 2 year olds gobbled these up! I couldn't cook them fast enough..."More!" is all they kept saying:)  I made slight changes...I used whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil, and I added one banana and some cinnamon to the mix. Wonderful.

The original recipe calls for 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, not 2 teaspoons. The correct amount now appears in the recipe.

Awesome pancakes!  I made a few substitutions.  Instead of all purpose flour, I used whole wheat and instead of white sugar I used honey- same amounts.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used slightly less than 1T of vinegar in a 3/4 cup then filled the rest with whole milk and let it sit for about 5 minutes.  My daughter is allergic to eggs so I used 1T of ground flax seed with 3T of water and let that sit for a few minutes.  I also added about 3/4 cup ground walnuts.  The pancakes were amazing, even my husband who tends to prefer the traditional pancake really liked them!  Thanks!

Light and fluffy, just like we like them.  Diabetic in the house soooo..2 substittions..whole wheat flour instead of white and Splenda instead of sugar. I added 1/4 teaspoon more baking powder (no after taste noticed). I did blend the oats and buttermilk, egg and vanilla in the blender and then added to dry ingredients.  This had just the right amount of sweetness for David but I would have liked a bit more "flavor". I believe the original recipe would have done it for me, hence the 5 stars.

These pancakes are very good! They cook up nice and fluffy and have a good oat-mealy texture. They are healthy too. It is easy to make in a blender too just go on the lowest speed until smooth.

I really enjoyed these pancakes..  I used half white and wheat flour, I also used brown sugar instead of white and used applesauce in place of the oil.  From previous reviewers, I left half of the oatmeal to add in after processing everything together to give my pancakes some texture-I really loved it with the pieces of oatmeal.  I topped it off with the "simple maple syrup" from this site--it was awesome--I will make again and often.

I just made these for dinner, they were so good, i did make 2 changes, first i really dont like buttermilk all that much, so i just used reg. milk, then the next change was actually an accident, i grabbed the almond extract, which was right next to my vanillia, and did not realize it till it was too late. they were really good with the almond. I also doubled the recipe, and in the last half of batter i added sliced banana's and choc. chips for the kids. they loved them both ways. i will definatly be making these again. thank you

Love this recipe...I just made them! They are just as light and fluffy as regular buttermilk but they have a better flavor! We used to go out to a large chain breakfast resturant for pancakes but I think we'll save our money from now on and make these instead...much tastier and healthier!

A must try for anyone that loves pancakes and oatmeal.  My first time ever having tried the combination, and I’ve got to tell you these were the best pancakes I’ve ever eaten. The only thing I did different was to mix it by hand.  Truly wonderful!

Pretty much the best homemade pancakes I've made yet. And more healthy than most!  I didn't have buttermilk so just used regular low fat, threw in some cinnamon, mixed wet and dry ingredients separately and then combined, with no food processor, and voila!  The whole family ate them up.

Perfect.  I hate cleaning my food processor, so I just mixed the ingredients by hand.  From the pantry to the table in under 30 minutes.  Topped with cinnamon spiced whipped cream.  This is fancy enough for Sunday, but quick enough for a weekday breakfast as well.

I didn't deviate at all from the recipe, and I thought these were the best pancakes I've ever had.  They were incredibly tender, moist, and full of flavor. Don't skip the buttermilk, as it's an important element of this recipe's success (IMO).  This now will be my "go-to" pancake recipe, and it already has been added to my Favorites folder. Thanks mom2hhh for sharing your fantastic recipe!

These were great, I took others suggestions and halfed the salt, soda, snd baking powder. Subbed applesauce for oil and did half the flour whole wheat. / also added cinnamon and half a banana and ground flax seed. This made 8 pancakes and they were around 70 calories each :)

Update: made these again and subbed almond milk for regular milk, I also used only wheat flour this time, with cinnamon it was fantastic (60 calories)

These were really good. I pulsed the dry ingredients in the food processor first before adding the wet. At first I thought they were not going to be very sweet, but once we added the syrup they were perfect. I think any sweeter and it would have been too sweet. I also realized I forgot the oil after I had already cooked most of the batter, it really did not need it. I cooked them on a nonstick griddle pan and they were perfect, it really did not need the oil, even better that made them a little healthier! Overall very good!!!!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it did not impress me or my family at all.  The batter seemed way too thin, which I'm guessing is the reason why it wasn't a fluffy pancake.  It was also way too salty.  In my opinion the baking soda was not necessary.

Kids loved these. Double the recipe makes 8 pancakes.  Used brown sugar instead of white.  Omitted baking powder, salt & vegetable oil.  Used 2% milk instead of buttermilk. As suggested by others I added fruit- diced peaches & a lil cinnamon.

So good! Used whole old fashioned oats and still cooked up nicely. You can just mix everything in a bowl and they will still be delicious. Really a no fail recipe. Today I will grind up the oats to a fine powder for a smoother pancake.

I have never made oatmeal pancakes and these were simple as ever!  As other reveiwers mentioned, I would lower the amount of salt.  It has a strong vanilla flavor, which I love, but others may want to reduce the amount if they don't like strong vanilla overtones.  I also just mixed the recipe up by hand and they were great! I topped them with applesauce and a drizzle of maple syrup and they were perfect.  My kids loved them!  Next time I will try whole wheat flour and rolled oats.

Yum! Smelled good and tasted even better.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I used fat free evap. milk, ground oats, splenda granulated sugar & added about 1/4 tsp of cinammon.  Only used 1 Tbsp of oil...cooked well & bubbled just like regular pancakes.  Filling and great without syrup/butter!  Very yummy! This one's a keeper!   Thanks!

I just made these, with a couple of changes. First, I omitted the flour, and instead blended 1 cup of oatmeal into a flour in a food processor, and second, I substituted low fat blueberry yogurt for the buttermilk. They were FABULOUS! I loved them. Hearty, a complex flavor and VERY filling, I had 2 and am stuffed! I will be making these again and again.

Very tasty and healthy, too!  I use 3/4 cup oats, light EVOO and added 1/2 cup pecan meal.  Going to use whole wheat flour next time.  Served these to friends who loved them!

These were fluffy and the kids gobbled them up.  I did not have buttermilk, so I used 1Tbl white vinegar and enough milk to make 3/4 cup.  This substitution worked well.

Gorgeous pancakes!  I love that they are healthy, tasty and have a wonderful texture.  I'm obsessed with adding cinnamon to my pancakes (if you haven't tried it, you must, especially with this recipe!), so I added 1/2 tsp.  One of the main reasons I love this recipe is that it is the perfect amount for just my hubby and me - no leftovers.  The only thing I would change is the salt, I would cut it back to 1/4 tsp.  I think this just might become my regular pancake recipe!

I actually have this recipe from Taste Of Home, and it's a regular at our house.  I usually substitute whole wheat flour for the regular flour, and I've used regular milk when I don't have buttermilk.  I've thrown in different kinds of fruit, and they always turn out great.

Double all other ingredients but triple the vanilla, otherwise you'll only get a sample of these delicous cakes. Old fashioned oats can be sustituted for the quick cooking ones.

Good Hearty flavor!!  I substituted the oil for 6 Tbsp of ground flaxseed.  This made it really flavorful and healthier! UPDATE:  I also added 1 Tbsp vanilla, used milk insted of buttermilk, and ground the oatmeal.  Definitely my favorite pancake!

this really was easy and tasted very good.  I even used whole wheat flour instead of white and Splenda instead of sugar and it was still light and delicious.  I added dried blueberries so it was not necessary to use syrup or butter.

Wonderful flavor, easy to make. My kids and husband wanted more than I had made up the first time, so I've doubled the recipe since. I make a couple of changes: replace the white with whole-wheat flour, replace the oil with melted low-fat margerine, let the batter sit for a while after making to allow the oatmeal to soften. This has become my standard pancake recipe. Oh, and I ALWAYS add some sort of shredded or diced fruit to pancakes, so apple, pear, peach, berries, banana, or such always becomes a part of it too. A healthy and terrific tasting way to begin (or end :) the day!

They were soooooo good and so easy to prepare. I just got up from the table. Fortunately did I double the recipe because I assumed they would be good. I was right. I used double acting baking powder instead of regular. They were veeeery fluffy. Topped with sour cream and fresh strawberry jam a dream come true. Or peanut butter and grape jelly.This recipe is a keeper. Thank you.

I made this last weekend. I doubled the recipe. I left out the salt, used 1% milk instead of buttermilk, and used old fashioned oats instead of instant oats. It was great! The pancake were very fluffy and didn't have an undesirable texture. They were also much more filling than regular pancakes. I made my son be my test subject. I asked him how he liked the oatmeal in the pancakes. He said "What?!? There was oatmeal in those?!? I didn't notice it, Mom, but can we have these again next week?" So there you are. Don't tell them it is healthy and they will love it!! hehe!!

These are super yummy. No need to use food processor - just soak the oats in the buttermilk while preparing the batter. I even used old fashioned oats, not quick oats.  The only thing I would modify is cut the salt back to 1/4 tsp. I also like to throw in a Tbs of ground flax seed to raise the healthy factor. The first time I made them I thought the batter looked thick so I added a little more buttermilk but won't do that again because they were too moist so stick to the 3/4 cup!  My 3 year old said they were delicious!  This recipe is a keeper!

These were delicious.  A couple of words of caution that I really should have listened to from other reviewers.  When you see bubbles which may be right away, flip right away.  These cook really quickly, and it's a fairly delicate batter.  

I made mine in the blender - I blended the oatmeal on its own first to get it to a powder, then added the rest of the ingredients and just pulsed a couple of times to incorporate them, then finished by hand.  Taste these before you add a lot of syrup or butter to them.  They are great on their own actually.  I used just a little drizzle of syrup and not much butter (and I'm a butter-holic!).  Great recipe!  I rarely stray from my tried and true, but I'm sure I'll make this one again.

Simply fantastic.

If you want a guilt-free traditional tasting breakfast, this is it. Just pour traditional maple syrup, and yum.  

I have been making these for 6 months now, maybe once every 3 weeks, for my husband, daughter and I.  I used the suggestion to use whole wheat flour instead of white, great choice.  I also add frozen blueberries that we picked last year here in Finland -it was an awesome blueberry year!-.  When these are on the grill, the house smells of blueberry muffins.  These whole wheat blueberry pancakes are flavorful, have a great texture, and are the family's favorite breakfast.  I double the recipe for 3 people because the stated amounts make 4 IHOP-sized pancakes, no more.  If you want to feed several people, keep that in mind.  About the amount of butter/cooking spray needed for cooking these as others mention... it is not bad.  If you use a non-stick thick bottom pan, you only need to spray the pan every other pancake.

I always recommend using the recipe as written the first time.  This is no exception.  I like that it made a small batch.  Probably 8 pancakes total.  The taste & texture were very nice.  I will use this recipe often.  5 star rating, no substitutions!

My daughter loved them.  I liked them.  My husband prefers our usual recipe.  We halved the salt and put in a little less baking soda per review recommendations and added blueberries.

My kids really liked these, but I am not so sure.  I will give them another try though, because my son wanted them again for dinner!

Taste the vanilla and oatmeal - nice loft - makes enough for me and 2 kids.  Easy to pour from the blender.

Really good pancakes.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have quick cooking oats just the old fashioned oats.  I don't know if that made a big difference in taste.  But I'll be making these again.

I tried these pancakes this morning for breakfast and they were amazing! They were very fluffy and raised very well. This has become my new favorite pancake recipe. Oh and just a little hint... I sprinkled some fresh blackberries into my last pancake while it was cooking and it turned out delicious!

These are wonderful pancakes.  We have been making these for a while now and I definitely have to say the first time I made them I did not have actual buttermilk and used skim milk and lemon juice to substitute.  The last couple of times, I've had real low-fat buttermilk and it really did improve the flavor of the pancakes.  I did not make mine in the food processor and they still turned out great.  My hubby and boys love these.  We all like to put peanut butter and homemade syrup on them.  They are also very hearty.

I usually make "moms buttermilk pancakes" from this site which we love. Sometimes I want a more filling oatmeal type pancake and this hit the spit. I used whole wheat flour,old fashioned oats, applesauce instead of oil, and sweetened with pure maple syrup instead of white sugar. I doubled the recipe so I could freeze the leftovers for a quick weekday breakfast (toaster on low heat, two times). Thank you!

Made these pancakes today and they were a big hit with my kids and husband alike! I make a lot of pancakes and these were my favorite as far as cooking them goes. They held their shape well and were nice and thick and fluffy, which made flipping them a breeze. I read another review that said they soaked the oatmeal in the milk first, which is what I did while I mixed the rest of the ingredients together. The only changes I made was to use melted butter instead of oil and a little less salt, just as a dietary preference. Worked great!

These are PHENOMENAL! Taste even better than regular pancakes. I did however tweak this recipe to make it a little bit more healthy. I substituted non-fat greek yogurt for the buttermilk and applesauce for the vegetable oil, and added about 1/3 cup of water to the mixture to thin it out a bit. They turned out fantastic! I found my new staple pancake recipe!

I have tried many pancake recipes and this is my new favorite!  I doubled the recipe and ground up my oats in the blender into a fine flour and used whole wheat flour.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk and vinegar.  These turned out absolutely delicious.  I will use the leftovers to make my little boys pb and j pancake sandwhiches.  Easy to make, and so much healthier than store bought bread.

Only made about 3 medium sized pancakes (similar to pancakes in photo). They taste very good, pretty heavy. I substituted almond milk with 3/4 tablespoon of lemon juice. Tastes good with raspberry jam...not great with just butter.

These were delightful. So tasty and light. i did not add as much salt because the amounts of baking powder and soda give it enough of that salt like edge already.

Made exactly as written ingredient-wise, but ground only the oats in the food processor and then whisked together everything else in a bowl- nice light, fluffy pancakes w/ a buckwheaty flavor/texture. Not quite sweet enough, so would probably add a tad more sugar or maybe honey to the recipe next time. Thanks!

This is quite good.  I substituted oat flour for the oatmeal, so I did not need to use the food processor......just whisked the dry ingredients in the bowl before adding wet ingredients.  I made my own elderberry syrup this year, so that topped our pancakes this morning.

I'm rating these 5 stars for taste, but for some reason my pancakes often go flat and soggy in the middle.  I would love it if they looked like the photo! It must be something I'm doing wrong, if someone can advise me that would be great.  It happens with pretty much every pancake recipe I've tried!

My new favorite pancake recipe! I loved them. I was a little skeptical at first b/c the batter was much runnier than I'm used to seeing, so the pancake was thinner. But, they tasted amazing! The only modifications I made were I used 1 tbsp oil instead of the 2 and I didn't have buttermilk so I just added a tbsp of vinegar to 2% milk. I always grab the Bisquick for pancakes, but not anymore!  I think next time I may try whole wheat flour and use less baking soda as other reviewers mentioned. I may also add fruit and nuts for variety. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Fabulous! I made the recipe exactly as it's written and the result was perfect. The flavor of the oats is delicious and I love the texture they give to the pancakes! The batter is thick and creamy and the pancakes are fluffy. (Note: another reviewer commented that the baking soda wasn't needed but she used milk instead of buttermilk. It's only when buttermilk is used in a recipe that baking soda is needed.)

These are so good. They taste amazing and I feel even better knowing that they are healthy. I took the advice from some other reviews and use 2 egg whites and use regular milk instead of the buttermilk but that is just because I never have buttermilk. I also added 1 tablespoon of ground flax seed and I think that added a lot to them! I will keep making these!

I wanted to use new Star Wars molds to make pancakes, but this is not a recipe for making shaped pancakes because the batter is too thick. It did have a good taste.

I tried these this morning and everyone really enjoyed them. I did have to double the recipe because the original would not come close to feeding us all (I would have had to triple if my oldest son was home) I did add in cinamon and lemon juice/whole milk combo. I prepared only the dry in the food processor and teh wet in a seperate bowl. I added the dry to the wet and mix until just combined (so it wouldnt over mix.) I also shredded in 1 - 1 1/2 cups of apple. I was out of applesauce so instead of oil I just used melted butter. My two youngest (4 and 2) devoured them, ignoring the sausage which is usually the first thing to go. A nice change from standard pancakes. Thanks for the recipe!

This will be my go-to recipe for healthier pancakes. I tripled the recipe for my family of five and substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose. Yummy, filling and better for you than regular recipes.

One of my favorite pancake recipes.  The batter is perfect, not too thin, not too thick.  It might seem that these would be kind of thick and heavy, but they cook up light and fluffy.  I sometimes add bluberries, which makes them even better.  Love these - Thanks!

Great pancakes!  I love most any pancake with buttermilk and this one really works!  If you don't have fresh buttermilk, you should really try it.  Makes a difference!  I wanted to use up some packets of apple cinnamon oatmeal that my kids didn't like, so I doubled the recipe and used three packets.  We like sweeter pancakes, so these were perfect.  I also substituted butter instead of oil, but next time will try the oil. I didn't add salt because I am sure there is some in the packets I used.  I didn't let the batter rest like I usually do, but the texture was still good.  They were soft and cakelike.  I'm not sure if the texture would be different with plain oatmeal, but I will try it sometime.  I used the blender to mix.

Yummy healthy pancakes!  I used whole wheat flour, omitted the sugar, 1 tbsp ground flaxseed for 1/2 the oil, and added cinnamon.  My 5 year old loved them!  Great with a dollop of yogurt and topped with strawberries, bananas or blueberries

5 stars with modifications! "Mom's" pancake recipe for the family now. DH has a lock on banana pancakes... what the kids call "Dad's Pancakes." Now, I have my own, seperate but equal recipe!  I have modified: 1/2 all purpose, 1/2 whole wheat flour; slow cooking oats substituted for quick oats; brown instead of white sugar; 1/2 the amount of baking powder; eliminated baking soda; 1/2 amount of salt; 1% milk w/ splash of cider vinegar; a little less oil in the batter.  The oats need to soak for a little while to soften, this also helps to keep the batter from being "thin". I found no need for a food processor and simply hand whisked. While I lessen the oil in the batter, I grease the pan with butter at each application of batter. (That's right, butter! Between whole wheat, reduced fat milk, and reduced sodium something's gotta give). The butter added to the pan adds a nice browning to the edges and imparts a flavor that has no substitute. I simply remove the option to add it at the table. The kids insist on syrup but I love these pancakes with fresh fruit and powdered sugar. The modifications made were based on previous reviews and personal preferences, not on disappointment with the original recipe.

these were delicious!!  i made the following modifications...  used whole weat flour instead of white,  used apple sauce instead of veg oil & sugar, used skim mile instead of buttermilk, per another review, i added smashed bananas & cinnamin. i also added a dash of lemon juice. i also did not have a food processor, so i just whisked....loved the texture.   okay, so i modified a LOT!  but i think it's a great basic recipe to play around with.   next time i will add flax seed. i will definitely be making these instead of bisquick from now on.

Good,easy recipe- I just whisked everything together in a bowl, as I didn't have time to set up the food processor, and it worked just fine.

Our favorite pancakes on this site. We use whole wheat flour and substitute soymilk w/lemon juice for buttermilk. Works just fine. We also add cinnamon. Awesome with homemade cinnamon applesauce!

Bravo, Bravo!! My daughter Hannah (16months) and I are a HUGE fan of good pancakes!!! I made these this morning and boy were these delicious!!   Here are the changes that I made:  I used unbleached flour & organic vanilla extract.  I omitted using baking soda after reading several reviews and decided against bc I was afraid that it would be too salty--this was an excellent choice.    I also swapped the buttermilk and used regular milk after reading one of the reviews and I also didn't have it on hand--another excellent choice although I'm sure that it would have tasted just as good if I did have buttermilk.    I also added in 2 TBL spoons of brown sugar and I used Earth's Best Organic Instant Maple Brown & Sugar Oatmeal.  I mixed all the ingredients in a mixing bowl just by choice; the result:  wonderful tasting pancakes with a good texture! After the panckaes were done I topped them off with some butter and real maple syrup (Wegman's brand--the best!) These were really good and I will certainly make these again and again for years to come!! Thx mom2hh!!

These were the best pancakes I've ever tried! I subbed whole wheat flour for the white and applesauce for the oil. I got exactly 6 pancakes, so it really only serves 2 - 3 people.

Scrumptious, divine, delectable...the list goes on and on!  These are wonderful!  I made exactly as written and they resulted in  a lovely fluffy and very gratifying pancake.  I love the fact that they have just a hint of oatmeal flavor!  Thank you so much for this champion of pancakes!!

These were pretty decent.  Not "Oh my God!" good, but good enough to consider making again.  I disagree with the serving number.  It makes about 5 five inch pancakes -- enough for two adults in my book.  We followed another reviewer's suggestion and mixed the oatmeal and buttermilk ahead of time.  Don't know if it made any difference, but it all worked out in the end.  We added fresh blueberries, which were a nice addition.

I tried this recipe when I had overnight guests staying with me. We all enjoyed them.  I wished that I had doubled the recipes as it only made 9 medium sized pancakes.  One guest said they had such a full bodied flavor.  I couldn't agree more.  I will definitely make these again and again.

These were very tasty and smooth! Adding vanilla really made 'em taste good.  I used whole wheat flour instead of AP.  My only complaint is that they turned out a little flat- I like my pancakes fluffy.

Very, very good. I made the batter for this the night before and let it sit overnight, which made for an easier morning. I made no changes. I served this with the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup, also from this site. Thank you to lovestohost for suggesting this one. There were NO LEFTOVERS! Great pancake recipe.

Maybe this is ok as is, but based off my healthy tweaks save yourself some time and find another recipe.  These were dense and bland.  The recipe made 7 4" pancakes.  I used coaches toasted oats, wheat flour, applesauce in place of the oil, added chopped toasted pecans and 1 tsp of ground cinnamon.  Even with using infused berry maple syrup, these were no good.  A big downer at my Easter brunch!

These tasted...healthy. I love to eat healthy, but never noticed a recipe that tasted so bland. Since I don't like to load up on sugar, it's silly to sweeten this up. Don't plan on making again. Very fluffy though!

I was so scared to try this recipie because i was trying to mock a pre-made pancake mix i received as a gift for christmas. My entire family LOVED the pre-made mix but it was from Texas and i live in California. OMG!!!!!!! this is even better than the pre-made stuff. My hubby kept telling me how great this was between bites. He gave me a way thumbs up for this. He could not beleive that i added oats to this. THey trully are GREAT pancakes. Thanks for sharing

I chose this recipe in order to use the left over buttermilk that my father-in-law left from his visit and all I can say is WOW!!! I ended up using Old Fashioned Oats instead if the quick cooking and it turned out fine.  I also tripled the recipe to feed my large brood, but only had 3/4 cup buttermilk.  To make up for the rest, I simply used regular milk.  My picky kids (who do not like oatmeal pancakes) didn't notice a difference and ate every bite, even asking for seconds.  This is definitely a keeper and easy to keep on hand by mixing all the dry ingredients and keeping them in a sealed container. Upon making this recipe a second time, I used all buttermilk, and while you don't have to ues it, the buttermilk does make a distinct difference in taste.  Also to make these a bit more healthy, I used whole wheat flour and flaxseed instead of the plain white flour.  Totally awesome recipe!!!

These were pretty tasty.  I added a bit of brown sugar and some chopped walnuts.  My biggest problem with these were that the batter was SO thin.  Whoever took the main pic on these pancakes must have been making some other pancakes or didn't add nearly as much milk and oil as this calls for b/c their pancakes look thick and fluffy.  I only did 1/3 cup buttermilk and they were still thin.  The taste was good...just wished they were fluffier.

I wanted to make pancakes a little healthier, but family always bulks. Not with these though! By processing the oats, the texture wasn't all that different to them, from white,all-purpose-flour pancakes. I made half exactly as shown, then added chopped pecans to the second half. Both were very good. Definitely, will make again. I want to try only 1 TBSP oil, and adding part whole-wheat flour (although that might be pushing it too far for MY family ? :) and adding different flavors (ie: cinnamon, bannana, blueberries, etc). Thanks, for sharing a great recipe, mom2hhh.

Another great way to use an immersion blender! Makes cleaning up so much easier. As far as the recipe goes, my family loved the fragrance and the simplicity of these pancakes. We'll be coming back to this recipe often.

I really liked these a lot.  I added two mashed bananas to the food processor with a large additional splash of buttermilk.  When the batter was done, I stirred in a cup of blueberries.  YUM! I agree with the reviewer who said to cook on low and wait until the sides brown to flip. I tried just waiting until I got bubbles a few times and ended up flipping too soon.  I doubt Bisquick will enter this house again!

These are pretty good.  I didn't use the blender because I enjoy texture in my pancakes.  I cut down on the salt and it was still too much.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and these were still light and fluffy.  Gotta love buttermilk in pancakes!

I've wanted an oatmeal pankcake recipe for a long time, then I found this, tried it, and it resulted to be delicious. Any way, as I allways do, didn't follow the recipe exactly, instead, I intriduced my own variations, so it fits to my taste. As I preffer fluffy pancakes I used teaspoon and a half ofa baking powder, and as I like the salty-sweet flavor on my pancakes, I used a bit more salt. Anyway I thought It was very nice and tasty; didn't put anything on top, but I believe some jam will be a good match. Thanks

A+++++  I just made these for breakfast for dinner and my family devoured them.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except mixed it up in my blender which made it very easy to pour out onto the hot griddle.  The recipe states it will serve 4.....not in my house!  I doubled the recipe and ended up with 14 pancakes.  I will make often.  Very good served with a blueberry compote.

I'd rate these 4.5 if I could. My family loves pancakes, but I feel a *little bit* guilty feeding them regular ones due to the processed flour, etc. I can feel a bit better about these. I've made them as written (cutting the salt as suggested) and they're very good. With a few tweaks, I LOVE LOVE LOVE them. First, I substitute either organic brown sugar or organic molasses for the white sugar (adding the molasses to the wet ingredients). These sweeteners up the flavor quite a bit. I've also used agave nectar (a low glycemic sweetener), but the flavor isn't very intense. I also use melted canola margarine instead of oil. Again, it just adds another layer of flavor. I increase the vanilla, too. Finally, I add cinnamon to the dry ingredients--about a half teaspoon. The result is fluffy, light, flavorful pancakes that everyone inhales. Oh, sometimes I add a couple tablespoons of flaxseed, cuz they have a nice nutty flavor, and sometimes I'll use egg substitute, to lower the fat. Go ahead and try these. They really are good, and good for you. :o)

EXCELLENT RECIPE.  I use about 3/4 to a full banana per batch, so it has a hint of a banana, and the banana adds some sweetness.  I also use whole-wheat or 1/2whole wheat 1/2 white flour for the flour part.  Very good.

I really enjoyed making the recipe.  The batter was really thick though and I ended up adding about twice as much liquid.  That, however, could have to do with the fact that I substituted oat bran, wheat germ, and whole wheat flour for some of the other ingredients.

Great Pancake if you're the light and fluffy style eater.  If you're looking for a thinner pancake (like my own preference), you may wanna consider a different recipe.

I made these for dinner and garnished them with sour cream.  They were just average.  They were easy to make, but they didn't really taste any different that a typical buttermilk pancake.  Even the texture was bascially the same.  If I try it again, I won't process the oatmeal.

Delicious! Very good recipe! Missed the part about putting into blender. Added an extra 1/4 cup flour and let batter sit 10 mins to soften oats a little.  Turned out wonderful! I added frozen blueberries the second time and they were great!

Delicious. I've had it at a restaraunt before, and they must not have puréed it because it had the oats visible. The purée helps blend the flavors together and make it taste well! I didn't have buttermilk so I had to make some with milk and lemon juice.

It is our go to pancake recipe! It is absolutely delish!  I always double the recipe and freeze a bunch of pancakes for the week.  The only changes is when i double the recipe I sub applesauce for half the amount of oil. I also now use this version to make gluten free pancakes using a homemade blend of gluten free flour and gluten free oats. Ohh so yummy!

I did like these. While fluffy, they have substance to them and aren't starchy and overly sweet. I got 6 - 4" pancakes from the recipe, enough for two small appetites. If you have teen boys I'd at least double it. 

I have to agree with other reviewers who said the consistency is a little odd. The second time I made them I first ground the oats in the food processor to make 1/2 a cup, then added the rest of the ingredients. That improved the consistency considerably. I also reduced the salt by half. With those changes I'd bump it up to 4 stars.

My teenager hates oatmeal. I made these and hid the ingredients. He ate every single one with peanutbutter! I prepped the night before, buttermilk and vanilla together in the fridge and the dry ingredients in the processor. Morning prep was almost nothing. A definite addition to our weekday breakfast recipes. Highly recommended.

Have made these for years & years. Absolutely the best. Gave the recipe to a friend and she gave them to everyone that she could think of. They were a big hit in Dixon. We used Mexican vanilla and it made them even better. Can' beat them.

These pancakes were wonderful! Very hearty and filling. I didn't have buttermilk so I subbed "sour" milk (reg. milk+vinegar) for it. I do this all the time for pancakes and it's fantastic! I noticed some reviews were saying that the baking soda seemed unnecessary or omitted it altogether. If you're using buttermilk or "sour" milk like I did, the baking soda is very necessary! It reacts with the acidity in the milk to really thicken up the batter and yields a fluffier pancake. Anyway, we topped ours with butter and fresh blueberries and they were delicious!

Absolutely loved this recipe! This was my first time making pancakes and was a total success! I read almost all the reviews prior to preparation and adopted several recommendations: 1) I doubled the recipe; 2) used 2% fat milk instead of buttermilk; and 3) cut in half the vegetable oil. I prepared two pancakes with semi-sweet chocolate, two with banana, two with strawberries and two plains! My bf loved them!!!  Will definitely do them again and will change the all-purpose flour for whole-wheat flour! Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe is very tasty and the only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because I like fluffier pancakes. This pancake does rise but still tends to be more crepe like. I did mix all ingredients up in a blender. I used whole wheat flour that I made from winter wheat berries. And I also threw a handful of pecasn in blender before I processed the mixture. The batter is very runny yet surprised they did rise and puff while cooking. I did note that these should be cooked on a lower temp as you normally would with other pancake recipes. I served with a berry mix and cream cheese along with syrup. I would make them again.

I will definitely be making these again!  Next time, I will run the oats in the food processor to break them down a bit more; although they do have a nice consistency.  I used heavy cream to make my own buttermilk and butter for the pancakes.  We doubled the recipe and froze the remaining pancakes which reheat very well.  I defrosted them in the microwave and popped it into the toaster to heat and crisp the outside.

Made this recipe for the third time today. So easy and delicious and nice to know there's a little something healthy in it. First time followed it exactly except used skim milk. Never buy buttermilk and skim was all I had in the house. Second time I added some blueberries. Really good but will try to refrain from adding so many next time. Today, third time I doubled the recipe and used almond extract instead of vanilla. Equally as delicious! Will continue to experiment!

Very good recipe.  I adjusted a little like some of the others.  Reduced the salt and soda.  I also used whole wheat flour, 1% milk and Stevia instead of sugar.  In addition I added 1 T total of finely chopped walnuts and pecans.  If you were feeding 4 adults you would need more batter.  This made about 11 small to medium size cakes.

Really turned out great. I used a bit less soda and a bit more powder, but the vanilla was perfect and the food processor fast.

These were soo yummy! I added a touch of cinnamon to the batter. And instead of maple syrup, I put a bit of cinnamon sugar over the pancakes - it was almost like eating a warm oatmeal cookie for breakfast!

I add 1/4 cup oat fiber, use yogurt in stead of buttermilk and for half the wheat flour I add oat flour. I add no salt.  And I add a mashed banana.  I use a 1/4 cup measure to measure out. Very yummy!

These were so good! I used ultra grain flour, added 2 tbsp of ground flax. I also made my own buttermilk using vinegar. So good! These are now my go to pancake recipe! I think next time I'll try some coconut oil instead of vegetable! Thank you!

Very good! After reading other reviews, I halved the salt and that was perfect for our tastes. To make it dairy-free, I subbed soymilk (unsweetened) for the buttermilk and it turned out just as well as if I'd used buttermilk.

Made this yesterday and again today for the children and it was fantastic!
Served it with raisins and chopped pecans on top with a little maple syrup.
I paired down the baking soda and powder because I could taste it in the cake. 
Today, I substituted some Greek vanilla yogurt for some of the oil and the topping choice: warm blueberries in their own juices. Heaven!

Used old-fashioned oats instead of quick-cooking, and processed them before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Excellent!

One of my favorite comfort foods.  I don't own a food processor, so I grind the oats in the coffee grinder and mix the dry ingredients with a spoon.  I subbed the vegetable oil for some nifty butter-flavored olive oil that I got at our local olive oil store.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  You'll see that the batter is a little runny, but it turns into fluffy pancakes.  Just make the circles smaller on the griddle, or they'll run into one big pancake!  I top with chocolate chips and maple syrup.

I made these this morning I didn't have buttermilk so I used skim milk instead, and instead of one whole egg I used two egg whites. I also substituted apple sauce for the vegetable oil. To give them more flavor I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. I topped them off by unfreezing some frozen blueberries and added a little bit of sugar to them to make them a little sweet. So delicious!

These were good! I made them almost as directed, in the blender, with the only changes being that I used only 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 2% milk soured with lemon juice, and I added mini semisweet chocolate chips. The batter was thinner than I am used to, and they cooked very quickly, but they turned out with a nice smooth texture and very tasty!

These were excellent!  Usually whole wheat can yield very dense results, but not these.  They were fluffy, hearty, tasty, and light...  not to mention, healthy.  The few adjustments I made were purely personal and not altering the recipe.  I replaced one of the tablespoons of oil with unsweetened applesauce, omitted the sugar (because I like to douse in maple syrup later!), and instead of buttermilk I used 2% milk – as it’s what I had on hand.  I added blueberries since I had an abundance of them!  This recipe is not only yummy, but it is extremely quick and simple.  I have a mini food processor and it was the perfect size for this recipe.  This one's a keeper; thank you for sharing!

We love this recipe! We've been making it every weekend for about six months now. I add one teaspoon of cinnamon, and always double it to feed our 4-person family. If you want to sneak in a bit more protein, substitute the buttermilk for equal parts greek yogurt and milk. Also, if you're out of buttermilk and do the recommended substitutions, know that using vinegar will bring out a salty taste in the pancakes. I prefer lemon juice. This recipe is a superstar!

Much better the second time around.  I did double the ingredients because the current serving size can not be correct. Instead of doing the healthier version I used the ingredients suggested.  However, I did omit the oil and used a substitute for the buttermilk.  I will continue to try it with the Whole wheat flour and a natural sweetener.  Overall they came out great and none was leftover.

I used buttermilk powder mixed with water, let the oats soak in that for a bit.  Then mixed everything in a bowl since I don't have a food processor.  It all turned out very good and I am definitely keeping this recipe.  I did reduce the amount of salt to 1/4 tsp. though.

I added 2 TBSP of brown sugar.  Need to double the recipe at least in order to serve 4.  Had plenty for two servings.   I used regular 2% milk since i did not have buttermilk on hand.  Mixed everything up in food processor.  Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes before cooking.  They were fluffy,very easy and good.  I would make these again.

Light and fluffy. I used almond milk, and no salt. I probably used a bit less of the baking soda than called for, and i added some strawberry jam to some sugar free syrup and heated it. I used Olivio to cook them in. A keeper.

i used sprouted whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and i used 1% milk. i didn't have a very big food processor so i just mixed the dry ingredients in it and then did the wet separately. i have to say, these were fabulous. i am not a fan of pancakes but my son is, and even my hubby loved them!! we all had seconds! oh ya, i doubled the recipe and that gave us probably at least 3 each but i put about 1/4 of a cup in the pan (actually a bit more than this)  these pancakes are really filling! they were so light and fluffy. i only put in half the required salt and oil. thx so much for this great recipe! my family gave them a big thumbs up.

I really like the idea of making pancakes a bit heartier by adding oatmeal. I like the texture of these and the ease of preparation. I also don't think the baking soda is necessary so I won't add it next time, but I did use regular milk (didnt have buttermilk) and while I thought they were very good I think they would be even better with the buttermilk. Very good way to make a kid-favorite breakfast a bit healthier. Thanks for sharing!

Makes fluffy, yummy pancakes.  I added one packet of apple cinnamon instant oatmeal and topped of the measuring cup with more oats and my kids loved it.  I also had to use vinegar in milk as a sub for the buttermilk.  The secret to fluffy pancakes - let the batter sit once prepared for about 10 minutes.  Great recipe!

These were delicious & so easy to make. Even my 6 year old loved them & she is kind of a picky eater.
I added 1/4 cup of sweetened flaked coconut & 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. The texture & flavor were just perfect. :)

The result was a bit salty but good.the batter is more fluid than the regular. The pancakes are thinner than usual because of it but still good.

Let's start out by saying I messed these up and they still are good! I will make these again and try to do it right!!  I wasn't going to put the oil in anyway so no harm done, but I DID forget the egg! They still turned out. Flat, but great flavor. Thank you for a wonderful, healthy recipe!

I made the above recipie last week and it was very good.  This week I changed this up a bit and it was an even bigger hit.  I replaced flour with whole wheat, buttermilk with low fat milk (I have also used almond milk prior...very good), oil for melted butter, added cinnamon, frozen blueberries and raspberries.  WOW. Very easy to make.

This was great. Did as others suggested and used half the salt. Also used vinegar and milk to make buttermilk. Topped with a variety of homemade jams and everyone was happy, including the baby who ate 1 1/2 of them!!!

Used brown sugar instead of white, old fashioned oats instead of quick, butter instead of oil but 1% milk instead of buttermilk, and whole wheat flour instead of white. Also added 1 tsp of cinnamon as others suggested. We also added about 1/2 cup shredded and cooked down zucchini.
Came out great!

I made these gluten-free by first processing oatmeal into flour in my food processor to substitute for the flour and then added 1 cup of oatmeal.  Instead of sugar I used honey (you could also use real maple syrup!).  They were puffy and beautiful!  I made some with fresh raspberries and some with bananas.  My husband loved them!

Very delicious recipe.  We just moved and I did not have baking powder (so subbed 1/4 t baking soda + 1/2 cup buttermilk) and no vanilla (so added an extra T sugar) and it was very yummy.

This is my first time making any type of homemade pancakes, and this is a fantastic, easy to make recipe. I recorded a video that shows me making this on YT. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmn4fiyT0fM)

These pancakes are not too sweet, but taste great with syrup. Very nice and fluffy. Can't wait to make it again!

I thought these were tasteless. The consistency of the batter was looser than I usually make and I followed the directions to the letter. One reviewer suggested adding salt but salt was already an ingredient. I was very disappointed as I love oatmeal. I will continue my search for a better oatmeal pancake.

These pancakes were very fluffy. I replaced All Purpose Flour with Brown Flour. And used brown sugar instead of white.
The pancakes came out too salty though and I would only use a pinch of salt next time I make them.

Very good, healthier and heartier than regular pancakes. I use 2 tablespoons of applesauce instead of oil and halved the sugar. Tasted great with both buttermilk and 2% milk. I add some cinnamon and nutmeg for a heartier flavor, have started adding a tablespoon of chia seeds and flax occasionally for health reasons. My kids love these and aren't normally big pancake or oatmeal eaters.

I just made these on a whim, and they were amazing. Subbed half the flour for whole wheat, and added a 1/8 cup PB2 and a few chocolate chips! Such a tasty treat!! Great base recipe an can't wait to see what else I can do with it!!

I've made these several times now - five stars may not be enough!!  They are the most tender, flavorful pancakes I've ever made - and I've made a lot of pancakes in the last 40 years!  Don't bother getting the blender/food processor dirty - just whisk until mixed well. The real secret to these is to let the batter sit as long as you can before cooking - it will thicken up beautifully. I backed the salt down to 1/4 tsp, and today I added 1/4 tsp almond extract along with the vanilla.  That was what took it over the top and made a review necessary...love these pancakes!!

Something about the flavor was a little off - can't tell if it was too much baking soda or not enough salt. Or that I subbed whole wheat flour for regular. Regardless, the syrup covered up any issues and they were a big hit. Also cook really fast, which was nice.

My finicky four year old stuffed his face and then asked for more !!  I had to use skim milk and also didnt put in a food processor and it was just delicious !!  I'm looking for ways to add grains to meals I already cook (and have ingredients for) and this was top notch !  Pleasantly surprised and so happy to find this recipe.  Thanks !!

Anything that my kids enjoy is worth 5 stars. Although I did not have buttermilk, I substituted it with soy milk and vinegar (recipe: 1 cup SM to 1 tbsp Vin, let it stand for 5 min plus) it was delish. Then to top it with homemade whipped cream, YUM!

Like a lot of reviewers, I did not mix this in a food processor. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup WW flour and 1/2 cup AP flour. Did not double the sugar and used vinegar+milk for buttermilk. This recipe reminds me of the "Fluffy Pancakes" recipe from this site. I like the little bit of texture this recipe gives you. Great way to have some oats for breakfast!

Made a double batch and got 13 (4-5in) pancakes. 1/4 Cup Batter per pancake.  Taste great. Going to try to freeze cooked pancakes for quick morning breakfast, to reheat in the toaster.  I used 1/2 white 1/2 whole wheat flour and used a multi grain hotcereal.  I processed the dry multi grain hot cereal in a coffee grinder to a finer consistency, then soaked this in the recipe liquids for 30 min. These puff up real nice even with the weight of the whole grains.  Used only 1/2 the salt and oil with no problem. Can't wait to try with sliced bananas and walnut sprinkled on top.

I made these this morning and it was delicious! I subbed the buttermilk for whole milk because I just didn't have buttermilk. I also whisked the ingredients together, which kept the oatmeal whole and gave the pancakes an interesting texture that I liked. I'll definitely make this again! :)

Very nice.  I used whole wheat flour and used melted butter in place of the veg oil.  Added blueberries which was very tasty.  Only complaint was that the recipe didn't make nearly enough to feed us all.  Yes they are hearty but my family LOVES pancakes so next time will double it.

Okay, so I switched up the recipe a bit.  I did not use baking soda.  I added some brown sugar and some cinnamon.  I substituted milk for buttermilk.  And I had to add some more flour to thicken the batter.  These are some of the best pancakes I've had, and my husband is asking for seconds.  Great recipe!  Will definitely use it again.  So quick and easy!

These were fantastic! Family LOVED them. The first few turned out too flat so we added 1/4 cup of flour. It made all the difference...fat, fluffy pancakes.

Tasted great! I'm confused on the amount of flour. I didn't use a food processor (thought this just serves to eliminate the oatmeal texture... maybe I'm wrong there?). But 1/2 cup flour left them way too runny... I'd recommend starting with 1 cup flour (and maybe 3/4 cup oats) and adding more til you get 'em where you want 'em.

My husband said, "These are the best pancakes I've ever had!"  I was blown away when he said that!  He loved the texture and the airy-ness of them.  That said, I adjusted as follows:  1. brown sugar vs. white.  2. Made buttermilk substitute with 1T lemon juice and the difference of a cup of 2% milk (only used 3/4 c as indicated in the recipe).  Heat your griddle to 375 and voile!

This recipe is terrific! Since I didn't have buttermilk I subbed skim milk and added ground flax seed for a bit of extra fiber.  I also put a chopped apple in to the food processor w. all of the ingredients and it was delicious!

FANTASTIC!!!  I used the same ingredients listed here in the same amounts.  The only thing I did different was to put the oats in the blender to make oat flour and stirred that in.  It was wonderful!

I enjoyed these. We doubled the recipe and used only 1/4 tsp. baking soda and put 1 Tbsp vinegar in 1 1/2 c of the milk. We also used only 3 Tbsp oil and no salt. I sprinkled cinnamon on some and pecans on others; they were all delicious! These are pretty plain, but regular pancakes have just as much flavor, so people who complain probably haven't tasted real pancakes.

Pretty tasteless, even though I'm always generous with my vanilla extract AND I added cinnamon. Even after I added chocolate chips to make up for the tastelessness I didn't enjoy them. The oats gave it a kind of creepy texture, I think the proportions are wrong. They definitely aren't very sweet, either. With so many other pancake recipes out there, there's no reason to waste time on such a mediocre one.

Ground the oats lightly in the food processor, then soaked in (whole) milk while assembling the rest of the ingredients.  We added a banana, and substituted honey for sugar and melted butter for oil.  Probably could have used a little more flour added, as a little thin, but very good flavor.

I have to say that I absolutely love these pancakes. The simplicity of making them make them a must for any family with small children. My 10 y/o is a pancake freak and being able to make these in a pinch is ohh so helpful. 

Thank you so much for this recipe

Excellent!  I made them both blended and not.  I prefer the blended slightly more.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk and lemon juice.  It is not a breakfast staple in my house.

Thanks for the recipe!! These were awesome! Didn't change anything other than subbing milk/yoghurt for the buttermilk. Will definitely make these again!!

WOW!!  These are amazing!! I've been making my own pancakes for years, but wanted something a bit more healthy. These are also versatile.  I made blueberry and chocolate chip, and they tasted great both ways. I actually had to make two batches.
I did find out that it is better to let the mix sit for a little bit before cooking it.  Helps the oats absorb some of the liquid.

I was looking for a healthy breakfast and/or dessert alternative and this was exactly what I was hoping for. I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted for fat free yogurt. I omitted the sugar and put a tsp. of pure maple syrup instead. I also used grape seed oil in place of the vegetable oil. I made some with blueberries and others with sliced bananas and they were both hits. Great with apple butter for a change.

Good, simple recipe.  I would make these again, but would add cinnamon, and maybe use brown sugar, in order to get more flavor.  I just mixed these briefly in the food processor in order to keep some oat pieces, and liked the texture.

I made these with half wheat & half white flours, added about 3 tbs sugar & used about 2 tbs of applesauce. OMG...were they good! My bf went to have one because he had already eaten a big breakfast & ended up eating 3 more! I also disn't bother to blend these & they turned out great.

Loved these pancakes.  Variations I made per some of the other reviews was to handmix (like the texture!) and used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I added fresh blueberries to some of them and served with a blueberry compote.

Second "from scratch" pancake recipe I have tried.  My family (including the picky ones) loved it the best by far.  Sometimes I'll add chocolate chips to the batter for a special treat.  Don't know what I'll do with my half-empty box of Bisquick!

At my wife's request we substituted whole wheat flour for the usual white flour.  Came out a bit more bran like but absolutely delicious.  We also added chopped almonds to the mix for added crunch. Great recipe to play around with and everything we have tried has turned out delicious! =^_^=

This was great.  I did add a 1/4 cup more flour to give it a thicker consistency.  Also added and additional tablespoon of sugar.  They were very good!  I will definitely make them again and again!!!

Yeah healthy pancakes!  I even hid almonds without my 3 year old being able to tell.  That girl could spot something out of the ordinary in her sleep.  

I thought they were yummy too.  I don't even like pancakes.  

I mixed dry ingredients in my vita mix so it was to flour consistency to help "hide" the good stuff.

These were really great! This recipe is going to be my new staple. So easy and really great flavor. I doubled the recipe as others recommended so I could have leftovers. I also hand mixed the batter for more texture. The only ingredients I changed were to sub brown sugar for white and I used half the mount of baking soda. I can see possibilities of fruit variations by adding bananas or blueberries to the batter, maybe some dried cranberries and use orange extract instead of vanilla.

I put the dry ingredients in the food processor.  Mixed in the wet ingredients, stirred.  They were wonderful, everyone loved them.  I will mix up the dry ingredients ahead of time so all I will need to do is add the wet ingredients.  Thanks for a great pancake recipe.

We love these pancakes - I do add a bit more oatmeal than called for to 'thicken' up the pancake and frequently add fruit. My whole family loves them, so I make them frequently.

Tasty, healthy and with a pleasing texture. I did not have buttermilk so substituted 1/2C milk (lactose free) plus 1/4C 0% fat Greek-style yogurt). Since I wasn't using the buttermilk I omitted the baking soda (which would have made the batter bitter in the absence of buttermilk to react with) and just used the 1tsp of baking powder as directed. I also followed other reviewers advice and cut back a little on the salt. I was very happy with the result and would make this recipe again with the adjustments noted above since I don't often have buttermilk on hand.

I doulbled the recipe, and added Saskatoon Berries. Topped with fresh berries corn syrup, and a light dusting of powdered sugar I also accompanied the cakes with crisp bacon, and egg whites. I'm not a big fan of pancakes, But I would make this recipe over and over...

The only change I made was using whole wheat flour.  They tasted great.  I'm sure they would have even tasted better using regular flour but I was trying to sneak some nutrition in there ;)  Oh I technically made another substitution, I used whole rolled oats because I don't have quick cooking oats.  I just put everything in my stand mixer (buttermilk and rolled oats in first while I gathered other ingredients).  So easy and my boys loved them.

Okay but bland when eaten plain. I doubled the recipe and added some cinnamon but did not use buttermilk. They were a bit on the salty side and yes, I did check my measurements to make sure when I doubled I didn't add too much. I also subbed the oil for applesauce. I did serve them with warm applesauce with a touch of cinnamon and sugar mixed in it and the kids loved them. They just dipped them in it.

They are a healthy option and cost about 1.95 to make 52 small 1/2 dollar sized pancakes. Next time I will reduce the salt a bit and maybe add apple chunks or raisins for added "healthy" flavor instead of adding more sugar. Or just make a homemade apple chunk "compote" to put on top instead of serving with applesauce.

I am a novice cook and I loved these pancakes (so easy!).  I only had old fashioned oats, so I used them, and substituted applesauce (all natural, unsweetened) for the oil.  I do not have a food processor, so I pulsed the oats in my mini handy chopper (mainly to "hide" them from my 5-year old), then whisked all the ingredients (dry first, made a well, added wet, whisked).  We loved them.  Will try the wheat flour, splenda, and 2 egg white substitution options next time.

I ground the oats in the food processor since I didn't have quick cooking oats, and it turned out great. I also added a dash of cinnamon. My finicky two-year old loves these in miniature.

VERY GOOD!! Used ingred. as written, 'cept 1% milk for buttermilk, and didn't food-process everything. I let the batter sit out for 30 min. b4 making the pancakes, and doubled the recipe. Served them w/ my Thanksgiving dinner's cranberry salsa for a nice way to extend our holiday leftovers. Next time, I'll up the healthy factor by subbing in WW flour, applesauce, and Splenda, but as written, these are fantastic, filling, and fluffy pancakes.

I tried this recipe for an alternative to the same old Bisquick pancakes.  I like that is uses ingredients that I always keep on hand.  My son is allergic to dairy, so I substituted vanilla soy milk for the buttermilk, and it worked great.  I used a hand mixer, and the batter came together easily.  It seemed thin, but the pancakes puffed up perfectly and with a great consistency.  I will try applesauce next time.  Great recipe!

Thanx  for great recipe.  I made these up for breakfast this morning and they were delish.  My Husband really liked them too.   Super quick and easy using the food processor, could use a blender if you don't own a food processor.   I didn't have buttermilk so I used just under 3/4 cup milk added 1 T sour cream & 1 T vinegar and let sit 5 minutes. I used a ladle for uniform cakes.  The recipe made 7 mediumish pancakes which the 2 of us finished with ease.  So if you have kids &/or big eaters double the recipe.  I may put together bags or jars of the dry ingredients to make them "quick as boxed" but SO much better and good ingredients = no trans fats!

Delicious! Some changes/suggestions: 1. cut baking soda in half 2. don't have buttermilk? Place 1 tablespoon vinegar in a measuring cup per 1 cup milk (this recipe would need 1 1/2 T. vinegar). Add milk to make 1 1/2 cups. Mix and let stand for a few minutes.  3. Pulse dry ingredients in blender or food processor. Then add wet ingredients and stir gently until just blended. There should be lumps! 4. The original recipe makes approximately six 4-inch pancakes. I doubled the recipe but still only used one egg. These were great!

We use yogurt instead of buttermilk in our house.  You have to add in a little milk or water to get the right texture.  Very good high protein pancake.  Especially if you use a high protein yogurt.

i just made these this morning. they were ok, i liked the idea of adding oatmeal. I used regular milk instead of buttermilk and they came out ok. Although I would make a double batter because a single one fed only me and my 2 year old son

Oh my these are great! With some real maple syrup on top or with bananas and nuts. Any ways you serve them these are wonderful. I've tried subbing white sugar for brown when I was out, and egg for 2 egg whites, even oil with applesauce. Great as is and great to play around with. I use old fashioned oats, b/c that's just what I keep. I see no difference since it's blended to oat flour anyways. This recipe as a serves 4 fits perfectly into my mini blender (it's a desert trading co magic bullet). Clean up is a breeze. They freeze wonderfully for busy school mornings.

I made these pancakes this morning. They were really good; however, I found they tasted kind of bland so I added some chocolate chips.  Not too many. Just enough to give it that something special. My husband loved them and so did my 10 month old daughter (without the chocolate chips of course). :) I will definitely make these again. A big hit.

Really good!  We're pretty picky about our pancakes, so it was nice to hear, "Mmmmm, these are good!".  I didn't have buttermilk, so I mixed a little lemon juice in with milk and let it sit for a few minutes, I also put in half the salt and baking powder.  Good stuff. Thanks for sharing!

It was a good recipe if you're looking for basic. It was easy, so if you don't have a pancake mix, this is a good alternative. I wasn't extremely impressed, but it tasted fine.

These are just as easy as the instant pancakes in a box. Great texture and flavor!  I substituted 2 tbsp of vegetable oil for apple butter and ommited the sugar.  Added almond extract instead of vanilla and added ~1/8 c chopped almonds to the batter!

To make the pancakes more fluffy, I didn't follow the recipe. I made sure all my ingredients were at room temperature. I separated the wet and dry ingredients as well as stiffly whipping the egg whites. If you do this, your pancakes are always light and fluffy. Well, almost always. These pancakes were a nice change from regular pancakes. Next time I'll use cinnamon and brown sugar to disguise the faint taste of baking powder

This pancake recipe was awesome!  It was extremely easy to make, especially for someone who doesn't cook a whole lot!  I followed the recipe exactly, with two additions (chopped pecans and chopped bananas), but the pancakes themselves were very light and fluffy.  Also, I didn't use a food processor, because I don't have one, so I whisked the batter instead.  Make sure to use real maple syrup on these babies!

I took the advice from a couple of the reviewers and then again modified it. I first doubled it. I used whole wheat flour, and instead of only oatmeat I used half oatmeal and half soy chips and added an over-ripe banana (mashed)then let it sit for 5 min. for the chips to soften.My wife that only eats traditional foods loved them.

These were the best oatmeal pancakes I've found. Most of them take forever to cook because they are so dense, and feel like hockey pucks in your belly. This batter has the perfect liquidity to thin out on the griddle and cook evenly. They are so moist that after my first bite, I stopped to check their doneness because I expected that I had a mouthful of batter. Nope! Just good pancakes! I also used brown sugar, because I feel like that's a better compliment to oatmeal. I doubled the recipe and got 6 largish pancakes.

I only had regular rolled oats so I blitzed them in my spice mill.  Also had no buttermilk so I used 1/2 cup milk plus 1/4 cup yogurt.  Left out the sugar.  The recipe made three 7-inch pancakes.  They were great with some apricot jam.

Great - makes perfect pancakes! The only substitution I made was using whole milk instead of buttermilk as that's what I had in the fridge.

This is the best pancake recipe I have found!! I made them this morning and they turned out perfect.  Like other reviews I used skim milk and whole wheat flour...  I also did not puree the ingredients, because I prefer the added texture. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe.  First time for me ever making home made pancakes.  Don't usually eat them because they aren't very healthy.  Took some suggestions from others and used whole wheat flour in place of the white.  Also used splenda in place of sugar and three egg whites instead of the eggs.  As for the milk, I used Almond milk because it's low in calories and better for you.  I used half the salt and baking soda and they came out great!

Made as written.  Resulted in light fluffy, but filling pancakes.  No more box mixes for this family!  Thank you for sharing.

I substituted brown sugar for white and omitted one TBSP of oil - we didn't miss that at all! Like other reviewers, I recommend letting the oatmeal soak while you're preparing the rest.  Great flavor and perfect with a fresh fruit topping!

One of the Exchangers was talking about these pancakes today, and I was surprised to see that I hadn't reviewed them!  I've made them multiple times now, and my favorite way is to use the milk/vinegar replacement for buttermilk and to sub whole wheat flour for the all purpose.  If our granddaughter isn't eating with us, I still make a double batch because they heat up well as leftovers.  Wonderful recipe!  I once tried to incorporate a banana, but I discovered that I like the taste better without.  Just delicious!  UPDATE:  Now when I make a double batch, I mix half just like the above, but for the second half I use non-fat Greek-style yogurt for the buttermilk.  We just love this perfection!

Fantastic pancakes. Made them first without buttermilk (before I knew the vinegar/milk trick), and they were merely good.  Second time, with buttermilk, they were great. Buttermilk is the key.

Excellent recipe!  I do not have a food processor so I put all in my Kitchen Aid mixer to combine. I used egg whites only (double), 1/2 whole wheat flour, and 1 % milk instead of buttermilk.  I also added some fresh blueberries to mine and my husband's, but mini chocolate chips for the kids.  Very good!

These pancakes are AMAZING! They are hearty but nice and fluffy at the same time.  I made a few simple adjustments...I used w.w. flour instead of AP, brown sugar in place of the white sugar, cut back the baking powder to 1/2 tsp. and added a 1 tsp. of cinnamon. I also mixed everything by hand and didn't rely on the food processor and they still turned out great.  YUM YUM!!

This is my new go-to pancake recipe. I find I need to add a little extra flour and oats or they are a little thin.  I like them fluffy and thick.  Also, since we eat them plain, I add a little extra sugar and they are a great to-go breakfast.

Fantastic with a few changes!  Loved previous rater's tip to add 1/4 C pecans to food processor.  Better with brown sugar than white.  Also liked cutting down on baking powder.  I'm a pancake FIEND and these might be my favorite ever.

These were good.  My boyfriend and I made them for dinner, and since we eat pretty health, I did make a few changes though.  First, I used two packs of low sugar blueberry oatmeal for the oats, and ommitted the sugar and vanilla (since there was a flavoring with the oatmeal), used 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour for the all-purpose, and added some more buttermilk since it was pretty thick.  I will definitely make these again, but next time, I will try it as is.

I love buckwheat pancakes but they are deemed too dense and healthy-tasting by the kids and husband. By using whole wheat flour, the taste and texture of these pancakes was pleasantly similar to buckwheat but fluffy enough to please the rest of the family! How great is that! I will definitely make again.

Excellent pancakes.  A new way to get oatmeal into our bodies.  I didn't bother with a blender, just put the ingredients in a bowl and mixed with a spoon.  Easy cleanup.

Ecellent hearty pancakes!  I did the standard low-fat substitutions (egg beaters, applesauce, splenda, whole wheat flour and skim milk) and they are still fantastic.  I would recommend cutting down the baking powder also and adding just a dash of salt.  Next time I think I'll add in some raisins and walnuts to get a 'trail mix' type breakfast!

Im doing 4 stars as they were good but not phenomenal BUT my buttermilk had expired so I had to use regular milk so I'll say it was my bad. I hope to review again once I have the proper ingredients. Added some cranberries in mine as well and used only whole wheat flour and half the salt.

These were a hit for breakfast this morning.  I did have to add a little more flour, the batter was a little thin, so I used about 1/4 of whole wheat flour.  They were delish!

Good pancake recipe.  I threw a few chocolate chips in for my daughter, and she loved these.  I also didn't have any buttemilk so I used canned milk which worked fine and added a dash of cinnamon.  Next time, I may try sour milk to substitute for the buttermilk.

The batter and the pancake in itself was rather flavorless, but the syrup made up for the lack of taste. I would rather rate this recipe 31/2 stars if I could. The pancakes were light and fluffy but had need of more flavor.

I scrolled some pancake recipe and I pick this one because it is quite similar to the one I'm already using. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 strawberry flavoured yoghurt & added enough milk to make 3/4 cup. I pulse the oatmeal in my blender. I used melted margarine instead of oil & it came out fantastic. I will definitely make this again. In fact, I'm going to make flour/oatmeal mixture ready so I can have them anytime I want to!

(Hint: You may use different flavoured yoghurt too!)

I also used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 flour.  Plus, I  used applesauce in place of the oil.  These were very tasty and filling!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I used this as a starting point and played with the recipe substituting cream of wheat, grits and malt o' meal in equal parts for 1/4 cup of the flour.  I ended up having to add about 1/4 cup more of the different cereals because the consistency was too thin.  The pancakes were quite good.

These are delicious!  We used old-fashioned oats because that's what we had on hand and added the zest of an orange, chopped & toasted pecans and craisins.  Really, really good!  And I had the dry ingredients in the blender last night and the wet in a bowl in the fridge.  This morning I blended quickly and they were on the table 15 minutes after we woke up!  Thank you - really, really good!

Amazingly easy!  Produces healthy, light and fluffy pancakes that cook quickly.  I mixed them in the blender, using a 50% white/50% whole wheat mixture for the flour, and only 1/3 tsp of salt.  Because I didn't have buttermilk on hand, I mixed a couple of drops of lemon juice with the milk and let it sit for a couple of minutes.  I've always been a butter-in-baked-goods person, but I used canola oil as stated in the recipe and loved it!  My husband asked for seconds, and he's not usually a "breakfast food" person.

My family loves this recipe. However, I use half the salt that it calls for, and I don't use a food processor. I double the recipe to have enough for my family of 4. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good and certainly not your everyday pancakes! I didn't have any buttermilk on hand, so I used milk and sour cream. I also added a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, some chopped walnuts, and brown sugar instead of the white. Raisins would be a nice addition too. Thanks Letha!

Very good recipe.  I used a blender instead of a food processor, and added blueberries after mixing it.  They turned out great.  Tasty, light, and fluffy.  I will definitely make them again.

My children loved these pancakes!  I have four kids 4,7,9,and 12 years old.  They are easy to make with no mess at all.  I did not have any buttermilk so I used 1% milk.  They were perfact!

I mix the dry ingredients the night before.  If you let the mixed batter stand for about 15 minutes the pancakes are very fluffy.

The best pancakes I’ve ever tasted! I made a few changes: instead of adding 3/4 cup of buttermilk I added 1/2 cup of skimmed milk and 1/4 cup of yogurt. This is our new family’s favorite pancake recipe!

Tasty, fluffy.  (not raw in the middle like mine can be)  I substituted a combination of sour milk & sour yogurt.  I used "regular" oatmeal.  Great flavor.

YES!  The oatmeal adds such  nice texture and a bit of nutrition.  Making in the blender and then pouring straight onto the griddle was amazing--not sure I will make pancakes without a blender anymore!  I tripled this recipe for my family to have plenty leftover.

Batter seemed thin, but cooked up beautifully.  I didn't have quick oats, so I used old fashioned oats, and used unsweetened vanilla almond coconut milk since I didn't have any buttermilk.  They were delicious!  I got raving reviews from the whole family.   I served with homemade blackberry "syrup" (crush blackberries, stir in a little sugar, then microwave.) These will be a regular on our weekend rotation!

Best pancake recipe I've ever tried, hands down. and I've tried a few. tips which I feel help a lot: do use buttermilk if you can, seems to add a depth of flavor which the usual milk+vinegar substitute doesn't capture. add shredded dried unsweetened coconut. I also add Flax seeds but not sure how much that contributes to the lovely flavor.

These are very tasty pancakes.  Used the Vitamix to blend up the oatmeal and it worked perfect.  Nice flavor change from the basic pancake.  Will definitely make these again.  Thank you.

These are my favorite pancake recipe by far. The whole family loves them. I grind the oatmeal up a little first and my kids don't even know that it's in there. I sometimes add cinnamon based on a suggestion in a previous review and it takes them from delicious to next level!

These are wonderful! As suggested by others, I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar Splenda, added a  banana and some walnut "flour" (the little bits at the bottom of a bag of walnuts) and used applesauce instead of oil. They do brown very quickly. They are the best!

Overall, we liked these pancakes.  We found the crunch of the oatmeal a little off-putting.  I even soaked regular oats for 5 minutes in the buttermilk.  Next time I will try to either soak them longer, try instant oats, or grind them.  Flavor was good, so I will try again.

Fluffy! And easy to make. I'm an amateur, but these pancakes browned beautifully on low heat and flipped over so well. Added another handful of rolled oats for the nice chewy texture.

I  made these pancakes twice this week.  They are great.  Both times I  forgot the sugar, but since we put maple syrup on them, I  don't think it was a problem.  The taste and texture were perfect.  They are my "go to" pancakes for breakfast!!

Followed the recipe almost exactly. I forgot the vanilla but it had no impact on the flavor especially since I had homemade blackberry syrup. I doubled the recipe and made waffles. I only got 5 of them but one was enough for each of us leaving one for the puppas to share :)  Made them again and only got 3 1/2 waffles in my newer Belgian waffle maker. For sure will triple or quadruple the recipe next time depending on who's son is visiting or if both or their friends come by.  This saved me tonight when I realized it was dinner time and I had not even started to think about it as I was rearranging cupboards. Breakfast for dinner is fast, easy and popular.

Excellent!! I took the suggestions from the other reviews and added skim milk instead of buttermilk, applesauce instead of oil, added bananas and extra oatmeal. We used a homemade blueberry purée for a topping.  Everyone loved them. We will definitely make them again!

I followed this recipe exactly except I didn't put it in a food processor. the batter was too thin and way too salty and it had a baking soda after taste. I tried to counterbalance with a ripe banana and chocolate chips for the kids but it still left it with a lingering aftertaste. I'm surprised everyone really loved this recipe in the reviews.... We did not sadly.

Good tasting pancakes. I took William's suggestion and used a 1/4 teaspoon of salt. I also used 2% milk instead of buttermilk. When I make these again I'll try them with more oatmeal next time.

Usually when making a new recipe I follow the instructions.  However I wanted fruit in them.  Knowing it would increase the liquid I used yogurt and the fruit and blended it in my magic bullet.  It was thicker so a bit more liquid but the pancakes were amazing!  I will certainly make them again!

I made these in an attempt to copy some I had at a chain restaurant and to alter them to use as a lactation supplement. I doubled the recipe and used whole wheat pastry flour, coconut sugar and coconut oil as replacements. I substituted 3T of the flour for ground flax and another 2T for brewers yeast. I added 1t cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg and stirred in 1/2 c of pecans at the end. I had to add a splash more milk to thin it out but they are REALLY  good, better than my old recipe, and my 3 & 4 year old kids ate 3 of them. I will freeze them in ziplock bags and reheat them a few seconds in the microwave, my husband likes them reheated in the toaster oven for a crisp outside. Next time I will 3x or 4x the recipe since it only makes 4 pancakes with the given measurements but definitely a keeper!

These were very good..I used the blender to mix them and the only changes I made were to use melted butter instead of oil and a pinch of cinnamon.  They were thinner than my regular buttermilk pancakes, but I loved the texture the oats lent to the cakes.  I'll definitely make these again.

Perfect! Even my picky kid loves them! I always omit the sugar just because I like my pancakes extra savory, but I’m sure it’d be delicious with it.

This recipe says it serves four but just looking at the volume of the flour and oats I decided to double it to feed the two of us (both grown men).  We did not have any leftovers.

I thought these were too salty and will leave out the added salt if I mate them again.  There is already a lot of salt in the buttermilk and lots of sodium in the baking soda.  

These are not the best oatmeal pancakes I have every made but cant find the recipe I used when I was cooking for my kids.

This was a big hit with my kids (who are mostly use to Bisquick pancakes).  They said this was MUCH better.  The only thing I did different was substitute reduced fat regular milk, but next time I will try with buttermilk.  Enjoy!

These were great. As per another reviewer’s suggestion, I soaked the oats in plain yogurt, because I didn’t have any buttermilk handy and reduced the salt.  Made another batch with some shredded apple, a few dashes of cinnamon and reduced the oil. That batch was also great. This recipe is a keeper!

Thanks for this recipe! I was excited to see a pancake recipe that incorporates some oatmeal, something a little healthier than straight white flour, so this recipe was worth trying for that alone, in my opinion.  The only thing that made me hesitate is that I didn't have any buttermilk, but I had some 'mock' buttermilk left over from last week (which you make using vinegar and milk and only adds about 5 minutes of your time), so I used that as a substitute. I then proceeded to accidentally leave out the salt, but with syrup added on top the pancakes were certainly edible and I can tell they will be really delicious next time. The only thing I question, which is my issue with every other pancake recipe I've tried, is how to get the pancakes to be fluffier. Add an extra egg? Whip the egg whites? As it is, the pancakes were still relatively flat, about half as thick as a restaurant pancake. Otherwise, they're great :-) Well done!

Love this recipe! I'm on a low calorie, high protein, low GI diet and found this recipe. I made some very minor alterations: I used 'skinny sugar' instead of caster sugar, and 'spelt flour' in place of all purpose flour. I didn't have buttermilk, so used plain fat free natural yoghurt (2 tbl sp), a tsp of apple cider vinegar and topped up with a little normal milk and it was basically the same taste and result. Absolutely delicious. It made 4 pancakes in my frying pan, each being roughly 120 calories. Great for a healthier carb-y snack when you're craving carbs and pancakes. They were beautifully fluffy and were a breeze to flip (often alternative ingredients make the pancakes fall apart when flipping, but no problems with this recipe!). Thank you. 10/10.

I would say these were just ok. The mix was thin and  after cooking they weren’t as light and fluffy as I would have liked but they were a bit healthier than other recipes. Pretty sure I followed the recipe and I do make pancakes regularly.  I would maybe change it up next time using less milk.

So easy to make and very tasty. It's a recipe that you can use whole wheat flour in if you wish instead of white all purpose. I've made it both ways and each time the recipe stands up. Very good!

Made, with a few alterations....

I milled the oats to a coarse flour consistency first in my nutribullet.

I used brown sugar for the heck of it.

Doubled the batch.  The recipe as is DOES NOT make 4 servings...maybe it makes four 4-inch pancakes. A doubled batch made about six 8-inch pancakes. That's about 3 servings in my opinion.

DON'T: Don't put this in a blender. No offense, that seems stupid. In my experience, if you mix the ingredients for too long they get tough. I whisked the ingredients by hand for 10 seconds and the texture came out fantastic! (Something I learned from Good Eats back in the day). Seriously...don't put them in the blender. That isn't easier than a bowl and whisk in my opinion anyway...

It was a little salty, as some others have mentioned. Next time, i'll use half the salt.

All in all, they turned out great, and I'll make them again.

Bisquick is my gold standard pancake recipe, but I wanted to use up some buttermilk, so I tried these. They are fine! They're very dense, but have a good texture and flavor.  Not as good as Bisquick, though. Plus, I generally will make a double batch of pancakes so that I can freeze the leftovers. These did not reheat well. I have no real complaints about this recipe, but I won't make it again, either.

With a few minor adjustments, this recipe is delicious! Per the recommendations of other reviewers, I skipped the baking soda, halved the salt, and added a touch of brown sugar and some almonds. The pancakes were moist and lightly sweet, and with the nuts, they had a gentle crunch for some hearty texture. Great with blueberries in the batter and raspberry jam on top! Just beware that because of the thorough blending in the food processor, they do cook really fast.

Great recipe. Double the recipe and freeze the extras for weekdays - they come out in the toaster really well from frozen. For double recipe quantity, added 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2tsp nutmeg, 1tsp honey, 1 tsp black treacle, reduced baking powder by 1/3, full fat milk soured with 1-2tbsp lemon juice, used all wholemeal self-raising flour, substituted oil with either apple sauce or a fruit of choice, latest was 1 mashed banana. Leave batter is standing for 5min (basically wash up before starting the pan) to get maximum fluffiness.

My husband and teen both really liked them and asked me to make them again. I thought they were pretty good.  They are a tasty alternative to pancakes made with just refined white flour.  We are trying to eat more healthfully, and these fit the bill.  But, they are not as good tasting as the unhealthy ones I usually make.

Amazing. Best pancakes I've ever made!! Love the flavor and texture that the oatmeal gives to it. And if you didn't know it was an oatmeal pancake you probably couldn't tell! It just has more flavor and body which I love. Thanks for the great recipe! Definitely a keeper.

I made them with 1 to 1 gluten free flour and added 2 scoops protein powder. Also used almond/coconut milk. Would definitely decrease either the baking power or soda next time. You could taste it.

I used old-fashioned oats and omitted the vanilla. I let the batter sit for 10 minutes to rest after blending. (It will thicken slightly.) I used a scant 1/4 scoop of batter for each pancake. Medium-high heat for 1-1/2 mins on the first side and 1 min on the flipped side. Served with soft butter and warm syrup! Delish!

Swapped out buttermilk for 1% milk, coconut oil for veggie oil and truvia for normal sugar. Then I topped with fruit I had in the fridge. Pineapples, strawberries, apples, cactus fruit, bananas, peaches and frozen blueberries. Yum!!!! It turned out great! Thought I'd share.

I made these tonight for dinner and they were delicious. I doubled the recipe and added apples (peeled and shredded in the food processor) and we had no leftovers. I just whisked together the ingredients as I just have a mini food processor, and I omitted the salt and used milk and vinegar in place of the buttermilk. I will be making these often.
Edited: These have become my go to pancake recipe, I make these once a week. The texture is nice and I like that the oatmeal adds some extra nutritional value. Works well with added fruit as well, the first time I added apples chopped in the food processor and today I added blueberries.

Since I didn't have buttermilk and wouldn't use it anyway, I used non-fat milk instead. For texture I increased the cooked oats to 2 cups. Also, I only used a pinch of salt and honey instead of sugar. They were absolutely yummy!

I don't think I've ever tried oatmeal pancakes. I just mixed by hand; not sure why you would want to blend a pancake mix until smooth. These came out fine. The batter was a bit thin for me, even after adding a little extra flour, which made them a little difficult to cook, but they still tasted good. I added red food coloring to make pink pancakes. I also put Valentine chocolate sprinkles in the batter, and then put whipped cream on top and added more sprinkles. My 4 year old daughter was thrilled!

These were good and hearty!  Like others, I did 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour plus added ground flax.  I also added chopped pears and cinnamon chips.  There are 3 of us and this recipe made plenty for all of us!

These are amazing! Super easy and taste great, my boyfriend doesn't eat pancakes and he loved them!  I didn't have buttermilk so used 2% instead, and I only put in 1/4 tsp salt. After blending it in the Ninja until smooth I added 1 tsp cinnamon, a diced green apple, and a few more quick cooking oats and used the pulse feature a few times just to mix it. They came out beautifully with the oatmeal, apples, and cinnamon, plus had a few oat pieces visible which adds to the texture. These have been added to the list of Sunday breakfasts in our house :)

Yummy. I accidentally use old fashion oats instead of quick oats, which my husband was a big fan of because he liked the texture. Both my kids two and five enjoy the pancakes. The only issue I had was that the batter was a little bit too liquidy, but this could have been my mistake because of the type of oats that used. Will make again. Oh yeah I also added cinnamon to the batter, which I do with most my pancake and waffle recipes.

This was a really good recipe. I set aside the oatmeal in the buttermilk to soften it and added it to the egg mixture then to the dry ingredients.

Substituted vegetable oil with coconut oil. Light Coconut flavor in pancakes which I don't mind.  Will definitely make these again and may substitute the sugar with  maple syrup.

Baby led weaning / Toddler friendly.  
Doubled the recipe, halved the sugar, only about 1/4 teaspoon of salt, this makes approx. 10-12  pancakes (10cm).  Also added optional cinnamon (1 teaspoon).

I followed this recipe exactly seeing as was first time making it. It was perfect. Quick and easy and the fussy kids demolished it and asked for more. We fed 4 of us but kids would have eaten more so would double next time. This will be my usual recipe now rather than my non-oat pancake recipe.

Made these with no buttermilk (as I had none) & just used plain whole milk & added some flax seed powder (for the health factor) & they came out tasting better than the regular pancake recipe that's on here! My new fave pancakes to make from now on! I also made extra batter for the next day & just added some extra milk the next day to make them creamy again & they tasted wonderful!!

Very Good Pancake recipe, I liked the texture :) Kids loved it and it was very easy to make.  I quadrupled the recipe and kept in the fridge for the rest of the week.  Easy to make on school mornings.  I did use whole wheat flour, 2% milk, and added a banana to the recipe.  Will definitely make again.  Perhaps use egg whites next time.

I substitute oat flour for the white flour and melted coconut oil for the oil. Also, I use 1 cup unsweetened almond milk with a teaspoon of vinegar in it and eliminate the sugar. Don't overmix it and let it sit for a few minutes to thicken before putting on the griddle. Turns out so hearty and filling with delicious flavor and texture!

I made it exactly how the instructions said and ended up with a very good tasting, but rubbery flat pancake.  Next time I will use a blender to blend the oatmeal into something between quick cooking and instant oatmeal texture.  Then use that oatmeal to mix into the recipe and use a whisk and not over mix it with a blender.

I found the batter to be extremely thin and the pancakes difficult to flip as a result. Maybe it was because I used a sour milk (2% with 1TBSP vinegar to equal 3/4 cup) instead of buttermilk since I don't typically keep buttermilk on hand. It may have also been due to using the food processor and over mixing the batter. Next time I'll hand mix to see if I get a better result. The flavor and texture was pretty good though.

Fabulous! Just made these out of curiosity, as I had never heard of oatmeal pancakes before. Super hearty and ultra filling. I couldn't even finish two of them! And yet, they're not heavy. In fact, they're quite light going down. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but since I'm diabetic, I replaced the sugar with Splenda. Also cut back the salt, as many reviews found 1/2 tsp to be too much. Other than that, all the ingredients are perfect. The marriage of these with a light smear of butter and a  drench of maple syrup is epic. The oatmeal contributes a subtle but irresistible chewiness to the texture, with just a kiss of resistance to the tooth, which lets you know these aren't your granny's pancakes.

This was a hit with my family!!! I doubled the recipe and it was perfect for a family of 5. I did modify a little bit. I subbed the white sugar with brown sugar, used 1 1/2 cups of almond milk, and did 1/2 teaspoon (instead of 1 teaspoon) of baking soda based on other reviewers saying the baking soda wasn't needed. I also saved some of the oatmeal to put in the batter after it was blended. This definitely helped to thicken it up. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

These pancakes are delicious!  I made these for dinner and my family (including my extremely picky kids) gobbled them up.  I was going to make the recipe as is, but I had to go with what I had on hand.  We are not buttermilk drinkers, so instead of buying it, I used vinegar and whole milk to make sour milk.  I also used Old Fashioned Oats instead of quick cook and I cut the salt amount in half.  The batter was very runny so I did add a tad more flour, and noticed that the longer I let my batter sit, the thicker it became.  The pancakes came out soft and fluffy with a great texture from the oats.  I topped them with sliced bananas and a bit of maple syrup and they were gone in a flash.  I will be making these again!

I made a few changes, and they end it up great. I used brown sugar instead of white and used one tablespoon of butter instead of the oil. I also mixed the dry ingredients separately and made my buttermilk with two table spoons of vinegar and let it rest for five minutes before incorporating the mix to the dry ingredients. Hope you find this useful!

My family loves this recipe and it is a regular in our house.  I rarely have buttermilk so I use regular milk and applesauce instead of oil.  The oatmeal makes the pancakes hearty and fills everyone up.

I loved these pancakes. I didn't have any buttermilk so I use 2% milk the first time I made them and 1% milk today. I doubled the recipe so I would have batter for another day. The first time I made the pancakes I did not add extra milk and found the pancakes a little heavy. This time I used a little more milk and the pancakes were nice a fluffy. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

Really yummy! Used regular milk instead of buttermilk and don't have a food processor so just used a whisk like someone else suggested. I've always sucked at cooking pancakes correctly but these actually came out really great! Good flavor and texture, would maybe use a little less vanilla extract.

Really good! The oats also make sure you feel full for a few hours, which is great

My Dutch and picky husband loves it. Made 1 1/2 of this recipe, used 2 eggs, no vanilla, no baking soda, but still tastes good! Thank you for sharing!

Love these pancakes. Doubled the recipe and added 3 bananas. Froze and  microwaved the next day and still as good as the day before. Making more today to finish up the buttermilk I have and will freeze them for a quick weekday breakfast.

I was looking for a recipe that would allow me to use oatmeal to lower my cholesterol.  On the Quaker oats box, 3/4 cup is the heart healthy amount so I increased the oats by 1/4c, then decreased the flour by the same amt. Used coconut oil instead of butter and put everything (dry ingredients first) in my  'bullet', the one I use for smoothies. Added a dash of nutmeg, flax seeds and toasted sesame oil, 2 teaspoons of raw sugar. I loved my pancakes and ate the whole batch! Lol  I like this recipe too because it's  quick.  A friendly suggestion: make sure your baking soda and baking powder is fresh, makes a BIG difference!

I love pancakes, and make them often, but these were the best I've ever had! Definitely a keeper! I subbed regular whole milk for the buttermilk as I didn't have any on hand, and let the batter sit for about 15 minutes to thicken up a bit. So tasty, and with the food processor, easy too! Thanks for sharing your recipe! :)

Nice and light for a whole grain pancake, missing the texture and "bite" of oatmeal. I found the batter quite thin, maybe it was over-processed. But I will make it again many times, using old-fashioned oats and skipping the food processor/blender.

I sub'd  half whole wheat flour, halved the salt and added a bit of cinnamon.didn't use food processor except to grind oatmeal before soaking in buttermilk (milk plus lemon juice)  prior to mixing everything else in. These were filling pancakes, but not too heavy. My daughter likes them with mini chocolate chips which I don't mind too much since it means she doesn't use syrup!

When it says 4 servings it means 4 pancakes. I doubled the recipe and made 10 pancakes. Put all ingredients into the Blendtec blender; quick & easy. Topped off with wild Maine blueberries that I simmered down. Great tasting and a healthy option.

This was pretty tasty but I changed the recipe a bit. I used whole wheat flour, instead of veggie oil I used grapeseed oil, and instead of an egg I used applesauce. I also used almond milk instead of buttermilk...okay so I used her recipe as a base but made it all my own lol. Still it was quite yummy with Agave nectar instead of syrup!

Really yummy! Just added to favorites. I used regular milk  in place of buttermilk, and butter instead of oil. I added a mashed banana and chopped walnuts, and used coconut oil in the pan. They turned out so moist, yet fluffy. Very delicious!

I made a few modifications, as I can never resist, but I consider this recipe a great foundation. I stretched the recipe a bit by adding about 3 tablespoons each of almond flour and almond milk. Also a teaspoon of flax seed and a tablespoon of chia seed. Also added chopped banana and walnuts to the mix. Did as others suggest and used vinegar + 2% milk as I didn't have buttermilk, and whipped in the egg white separately. I didn't have baking soda and didn't notice any issues. I also forgot the oil! Even so these were delicious.  Mixed everything by hand and cooked in coconut oil on the griddle. Topped with chopped dates stewed in butter and maple syrup... Heaven!

This pancake recipe was surprisingly tasty for "healthy" pancakes. I used Scottish oats, which are a finer grind, and then mixed  the ingredients in a bowl with a whisk. I added 1 cup previously frozen blueberries to the batter and served with a smear of melted butter and small amount of maple syrup. Delicious. My husband hates "healthy" versions of pancakes and loved these.

This is a no fail recipe, I have made it several times, with a multitude of varities.... banana, chocolate chips, or just added fall spices. Consistent and healthy. I do not add in all of the buttermilk as I like a thicker pancake.  Also let the batter rest for 15-20 min before cooking for fluffier pancakes.

I thought this was a great recipe, especially because most of the ingredients used you probably already have on hand. Even with just 1 tablespoon of sugar it is still sweet enough for a pancake. However, I think you may need to cut the salt a bit in this recipe. Maybe 1/3 TSP will do better than what the recipe calls for.

Awesome!!! I didn't have buttermilk so I threw some vinegar in milk. I also had regular old fashioned oats, not quick oats, so I just threw the dry ingredients in the blender first, whizzed it up to chop up the oats, then added the wet ingredients. Fantastic!! Next time I think I will sub half the AP flour for whole wheat. I also doubled the recipe, but next time I will triple it!

Mine came out really flat but they tasted great. I didn't have buttermilk so I did vinegar and milk(I think it needed more vinegar because it takes a lot of the kind that I have(great value) to thicken the milk even a little.) I'll try this recipe again some other time with different vinegar and maybe let the mix sit for a while longer than I did this time. I mixed it in the blender and did the liquids together first then added the dry.

This recipe was delicious!  I think I have found my go to for pancakes!  We made them and I used lemon juice instead of vinegar for the milk  and used olive oil instead of veg oil.  And I lowered the salt ( due to reading other reviews to 1/4). I think they are a bit sweet so I will make again and reduce sugar by half.   Thanks again for sharing!  ??

They are good and i would give another star but I've made them twice and I feel the batter is too thin. Next time I make them I am going to reduce the liquid. I also feel they are better with some cinnamon.

Awesome! I used almond milk in place of buttermilk just because that's the only milk I buy. I don't have a food processor, so I mixed it up in the blender. Next time I will put the wet ingredients in first so I don't get dry clumps on the sides of the blender. We have a LOT of maple brown sugar instant oatmeal that we never eat. I might try that in place of quick oats next time.

Love these pancakes.  I use whole wheat flour and throw in some blueberries.  They have great flavor.

Best pancakes I've ever had!!   The only thing I substituted was coconut milk for buttermilk (didn't have any) and fried them in coconut oil also.   The flavor & texture were fabulous!   I also don't own a food processor but whisking worked just fine too.   Next time will double the recipe because these went fast!

This is the first pancake recipe that worked with my spelt flour! The pancakes were delicious and fluffy. I used spelt for the flour, much less salt, less baking soda, and organic cane sugar. They came out perfect.

I subbed a mashed banana for the oil and put dry ingredients in food processor first, then changed to my whisk attachment and added all the wet. I made buttermilk with my skimmed milk and lemon. I also used less baking powder and salt and gluten free flour mix. They are delicious and so easy to make!

love love love these pancakes. I have always use Hungry Jack pancake mix with wheat but after making these pancakes I won't ever look at a box pancake AGAIN. I have made these pancakes  4 times. I always double the amount I eat 3 pancakes  and freeze the rest. I do substitute the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour. Other than that I follow the recipe as is and it's perfect!

This was excellent.  I used whole wheat flour in place of the white.  I did not use a blender but stirred all the ingredients in a bowl with a fork. Other reviews mentioned they were a little salty and I would agree.  Next time I will cut salt in half.  For a healthier topping I microwaved a small  bowl of frozen blueberries for 1 minute and stirred them with some greek honey yogert. It was a real treat!

Delicious recipe.  I swapped 2 tablespoons butter for the vegetable oil and it made the outsides have a nice, browned, crisp edge.  Also used brown sugar instead of white and added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon just to suit my preferences.  Yum!

Delicious! Warning. Do NOT over mix. I suggest mixing the dry ingredients in a food processor and then adding dry mix to the wet ingredients and mixing by hand. If this is over mixed pancakes will be flat.

Great taste and texture. Instead of setting up my food processor,  I cooked the oatmeal  in just enough water to get them nice and moist. I also used 1/2 cup whole milk and a 1/4 cup sour cream because I didn't have any buttermilk. My one-year-old devoured them. Healthy alternative to flour based pancakes. I served them with lingonberries instead of syrup.

I make these often and they are great! I don't bother with a processor or anything. I just toss everything in a bowl and mix with a whisk and voila! I also always use regular milk. I'll add a few chocolate chips, or some cinnamon, or raspberries, etc as desired. It's a tastey recipe that can be altered or left alone and always come out great.

Batter was thin, but I read on other oatmeal pancake reviews to let it rest and it did help. I will make again and look forward to adding bananas and nuts.

This recipe was great, However I did find that 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract was a little too strong, maybe it would have worked better if it was vanilla essence. I threw in some frozen raspberries as well into some of the batter. It yielded 4 small-med sized pancakes for me

I just made these and they are amazing!!! Better than any restaurant. They have a sweet taste, so no need for lots of butter and syrup. Made these with oven baked bacon (a first). Both amazing. It says 4 servings for the pancakes, but it's more like 2. There was enough batter for 5 smallish (about 5 in) pancakes. With the bacon, it was perfect for my husband and I. First meal as a married woman--success!!

I didn’t change a thing to this recipe ... I think it’s perfect just the way it is. I do double it to feed my family of 5 and make my own buttermilk with 1 tbsp of vinegar and 1 1/2 cups 2% milk.  I let the batter sit a bit after I blend it and it actually thickens. The buttermilk in my opinion gives it a really nice flavor ....These are one of our favorites!

Loved this simple pancake recipe. Good enough to eat without syrup. I used regular milk 'soured' up with a tablespoon of vinegar, because I didn't want to run to the store.
My picky 6 year olds and not so picky 2 year old gobbled them down. Even my hubby, who is a insta-blueberry-pancake man, enjoyed them very much!

I expected these to be dry, but they were wonderfully moist. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose; turned out great.

I doubled the ingredients but used 3/4 c quick oats and 1/4 c whole wheat flour and a dash of cinnamon along with 1 c all purpose flour (2 t b.p., 1/2 t bs, 1/2 t salt.. And I used 3 T butter melted. I always separate the eggs, mix the yolks with the liquids and whip the whites which I fold in after mixing the dry and wet. My fussy eater grand children gobbled them up!

I found the pancakes to be a bit doughy - very good taste. I cooked them at a lower heat longer and a higher heat shorter and it didn't matter.  I loved the taste of them. I also followed the recipe to a T.

I added mini chocolate chips to my pancakes, and they were a great complement to the oatmeal flavor. I used the vinegar and milk method instead of buttermilk. The pancakes tasted even better the next day!

Great taste, easy breakfast fare.  I no longer bother with the processor, preferring the more robust texture of the oats.  Like others, I reduce the salt by as much as half. The serving size is off, at least for my family.  I double the recipe and serve 3 or 4 people.

Love this recipe because I love pancakes and this recipe eases my conscience! I used a little less sugar and salt because of preference, I used coconut oil which gave them a delicious hint of coconut that we love. They did turn out flatter than I usually like, but the flavor makes up for that and they were moist. Great healthy pancake recipe that I can whip up on a whim!

Love this recipe. I Substitute all purpose flour with whole wheat flour. Made these with and without baking powder. But the ones with baking powder resulted in fluffier pancakes. Substituted butter milk with milk + vinegar like others suggested and it works great. This has become our tradition for Sunday morning breakfast.

I doubled this recipe.  I used (2)egg whites and (1) egg.  Used skim milk instead of buttermilk and added pecans to the mix.  Turned out great.  My family can be very picky but they loved the pancakes.  This is my new pancake recipe.

This recipe is four stars IF you reduce the salt.  I have never found a pancake salty -- until now.  I used whole wheat flour for this recipe and it turned out great -- fluffy and light.  I will definitely use this recipe again, but will add only 1/4 of the salt.

These were great! I used regular (not quick cook) oats and it was fine probably because they are zipped up in the food processor. I also added half a sliced banana while processing and a dash of cinnamon. So good. The portion is just right for two - three people.

loved this recipe! I coupled it with a buttermilk syrup that is soo yummy!  If you are an oatmeal cake fan then add cinnamon to the mix and then sprinkle some toasted coconut on top before topping it with syrup,  super yummy. also I used rolled oats that I soaked in the buttermilk (milk plus lemon juice) while I mixed the dry ingredients, loved the texture. also I used a whole grain mixture (just threw lots of different grains in my wheat grinder) and it turned out great! These are definitely my favorite pancakes! Make sure you at least half the salt, or they are way too salty. Next time I am doing less than half of what it calls for.

This was great. Very tasty. I'm not a fan of pancakes but made these for my hubby and he also loved them. I used almond milk plus vinegar as a sub for the buttermilk and these came out perfect; light and fluffy and had a nice taste from the vanilla and oaty-ness, no tatse of baking powder at all. I added a few wild blueberries and topped them with warmed and thinned whole strawberry jam.

Very tasty! Delicious! I did do things different. I did not have quick cooking oats, so I soaked my old fashioned oats for about 10 minutes in buttermilk  while I put all the other dry ingredients together. Came out excellent.

Made these this morning and they were great!  Didn't modify the recipe - made it "as is".   I don't have a blender - I use my Nutra Bullet for anything that requires a blender and the batter was perfect. I read the reviews while I was eating and some said the batter was too runny - I had to scrape the remaining batter out of the bullet at the end.... Not runny at all. Others said that they tasted baking soda - don't think I tasted baking soda -  but than again not sure was baking soda taste tastes like. I topped with bananas and some chopped walnuts and syrup. Definitely will make these again but next time I'm going to try it with regular milk - it just so happened that I had buttermilk in the house which is not usually the case.

I love this simple recipe. The only thing I do different is to grind oatmeal in blender first and then add all dry ingredients mix together then add wet. It does seem runny to me so I end up adding about 1/4 cup more flour after mixing ingredients. For Christmas I added tsp of cinnamon and my son wanted chocolate chips so added during cooking.  Love texture and consistency of batter. Yes, taste great.

Not as fluffy as white pancakes, but the wholegrain nutrition is worth the small sacrifice. Used Organic Valley' s powdered buttermilk, reconstituted, and slightly less salt.

These cooked up rather dark and I don't know why but they were light and delicious.  I tried them twice, using white whole wheat flour.  I added 1/2 of a banana to one batch and used brown sugar - the combination of banana and oats was delicious.  My whole family voted this recipe a "keeper".

These were very good. Even my 10 yr old who turned his nose up at the sound of the recipe really liked them! I don't own a food processor so I just mixed the ingredients in a bowl. Probably would have even better ground up as the oatmeal was still a bit 'gritty', but still pretty good. Also I subbed coconut oil for the vegetable oil and Splenda blend instead of sugar and added a tsp of cinnamon, made it very tasty.

These were pretty good.  I added nutmeg and omitted the oil.  I could taste the baking soda even though I used slightly less.  I made a double batch for my family of five and there were no leftovers!

Very good recipe.  I trippled the recipe, and added 3 cups buttermilk consistent with my other recipe, but it was too much, so 2&1/4 would have been right, as indicated by the recipe.  As it was, I added 1/3 cup flour and it turned out good.

Wow.  These are delicious.  I doubled the recipe and used a bit more buttermilk than it called for because I like the batter a little on the thinner side.  Made it all in the food processor, just as the recipe instructed.  A keeper.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, although I did make a few changes. I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 AP and 1/2 Whole Wheat Flour, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and almond milk in place of buttermilk and the pancakes turned out great!

I make these pancakes almost every weekend for my family. I make them a little healthier by using whole wheat flour. I don't think you can tell the difference. I love that they also contain oatmeal, so I don't feel so bad about making pancakes every Saturday. The oatmeal adds a really nice texture but since it's ground up in the food processor, you don't really notice it's there. The vanilla adds a nice flavor. Sometimes I use half the milk and make up the rest with ricotta. It makes them fluffier, but they fall apart a little easier. I never have buttermilk on hand, so I just use regular milk. Sometimes I add blueberries or chocolate chips and bananas (not that anyone needs this suggestion to think of that!) o have tried many other pancake recipes on this site and this is the one I always come back to. There's definitely no need to keep pancake mix on hand when you have this recipe!

This is exactly the pancake recipe I was looking for - to find a great recipe that I could make accommodate some dietary restrictions.    I made a few changes - can't eat wheat so subbed Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Baking Mix.  I also increased the amount of oats and decreased the amount of flour.  Used just 1 tbs oil.  Also am non dairy so used almond milk with a splash of vinegar.  Also added fresh blueberries.  Perfect pancakes!!!  (I've been trying various recipes and the search stops here.)

These turned out great, even my 'thou shalt eat no oatmeal' girl loved them.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour and regular milk instead of buttermilk since I didn't have any.  Keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe for 12 servings.  I loved it.  It was delicious.  I didn't use buttermilk though.  I substituted 2 1/2 c. of milk with a little over 2 tblsps. of lemon.  THEY were delicous and sweet.  Not fluffy, but I didn't expect them to be.  But very delicious.

I decided to cut a few more calories and use almond milk (30 cup)instead of buttermilk (100 cup).  I also added 1/2 Tablespoon white vinegar.  These turned out delicious!  My finicky, 12yo daughter asked if I would continue making these when we have pancakes.

Really good, but the serving sizes are pretty small. I made 8 servings for six people and it made about 10 pancakes.

This recipe prompted my signing up for this site. It was delicious to say the least. I made a few minor adjustments due to the fact that I'm lactose intolerant. I used silk vanilla almond milk in lieu of the buttermilk and added a tablespoon of peanut butter to the batter, and voila! heaven! I was really hungry and hence made two servings. Big mistake!!! One serving is more than enough to fill you up!! I drizzled some agave nectar and sliced some strawberries and oranges to accompany my pancakes... DIVINE...

These are a big hit with the entire family. We add blueberries while they are cooking. I hate buying buttermilk so I use powdered buttermilk and they still turn out great. If you have a big crew or want leftovers definitely double or triple the recipe. They freeze well (freeze with layers of parchment paper in between the pancakes so you can remove one or two).

Good base recipe. I also double the recipe to freeze some. I used gf flour, coconut palm sugar, added pureed banana and flax meal. Made half of them with blueberries. By eliminated the egg & replacing the milk I could've easily made this vegan.

The BEST pancakes I've ever had.  I've been making these for about a year now and I cannot eat regular pancakes anymore - they don't have any flavor compared to these.  I follow the recipe exactly and they come out perfect every time.  I use the food processor just like she says and it literally takes 10 minutes, start to finish, and clean up is a breeze!  I probably make these more often than I should ;o)

I wanted a no fat/sugar oatmeal pancake recipe. I used this as my base, doubled the recipe getting 7 5" pancakes. I substituted plain yogurt for the oil, wholewheat for white flour, zylitol for white sugar, and using powdered buttermilk into the dry ingredients. My wife thought it was a little dry so next time I'll use 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 fresh ground flax seed subbing for oil. I thought they were great as is but I may be biased.

I scaled this recipe down to one serving - one large pancake for my breakfast. I omitted using the food processor and just shook it all up in a blender/shaker cup, which worked quite well. I was surprised at how delicious these pancakes are on their own without a topping of any kind. However, I discovered that after I had topped mine with unsweetened applesauce, cinnamon, and a sprinkling of walnuts. ***I made these pancakes again 3 days later when a grandchild spent the night. This time I used the blender and the full recipe. Oh, and I use regular milk, not buttermilk. These are the best homemade pancakes I've ever made. Love them!

This is an excellent recipe. I'm wondering why I have not tried it before now.  It will be in our regular rotation from now on.  I followed the recipe with only a few minor exceptions since I read several of the reviews that said it was either too salty or had too much baking soda.  So I used only 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and of baking soda and the pancakes were perfect.  One other tweak I made was to use 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup all purpose flour.  These were a winner.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this! I substituted the all purpose flour for spelt flour, buttermilk for milk, quick cooking oats for bob's red mill thick rolled oats, and white sugar for ground panela sugar. Turned out Very moist and tender!!!! For a more buttery taste, use ghee to cook the pancakes. Yum!

So easy to make, and so delicious! I had no buttermilk, so just used milk and it was great. With no food processor either, I just mixed it all really well, no problem.

Awesome.  We use regular milk and add all kinds of fruit, chia seeds and serve them with peanut butter, Greek yogurt or agave syrup.....kids gobble them up. Outstanding!  Healthier and just as delish!

Made it with 1 cup oatmeal ground to powder in the ultimate chopper (no flour). Followed the rest of the ingredients, but used 2 tbsp maple sugar. Pureed 1 banana and 1 small red apple in the ultimate chopper, and used a hand mixer to mix it in. Added 2 tbsp walnuts, 2 tbsp coconut flakes, and made a couple of pancakes with this mix, added chocolate chips to a batch, and then cranberries to the last batch. We are able to make 7-8 smaller pancakes with this recipe, and have done this 4x already. It helps to let it stand 20 minutes before cooking. And it does burn faster than the usual pancake. We use a crepe maker/griddle (CucinaPro) for ease of turning. The banana/apple puree in the mixture makes it moist and just soooo good and sweet enough not to need additional syrup/fruit preserves. I did not particularly care for the chocolate chips (too sweet!), but the cranberries are perfect. Thank you for this recipe! My husband states that anybody would be crazy to go back to flour pancakes after having these "oatcakes!"

I doubled the recipe and it made 10 nice size pancakes. The only little change I did was to substitute some whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour. Mixed it in my blender. The batter was a bit runny but it still made fluffy pancakes.

These turned out wonderful making a few changes for my gluten free family. I used gluten free old fashion oatmeal that I blended slightly in the food processor. A few other changes made were: substitued gluten free flour mixture for regular flour.  I used 2 egg whites for 1 whole egg and used another's suggestion of adding finely chopped pecans. My batter was very thick so I added a little extra buttermilk as well. Yummm! We served these with fresh berries but I think fried apples with them would be perfect as well!

Easy, tasty pancakes. I used whole wheat flour and added some chopped almonds. Also, I can't get buttermilk where I live, so I used half plain yogurt and half milk for the "liquid" content and it was still very good.

Absolute favorite pancakes ever. We don't have a food processor but even if we did, I likely wouldn't use it. We LOVE oatmeal and having it a bit chunkier is delicious. Makes it so hearty and whole tasting. I always add extra vanilla and throw in cinnamon or allspice too. Today I didn't have enough milk so I used almond milk. Amazing.

Yummy. I doubled the recipe and substituted mashed banana for the oil and then negated all of the attempts at healthiness by frying them in butter. Was very tasty though and I loved the texture (a little bit of chew to it more than plain pancakes).

These were really great! I used WHOLE WHEAT flour instead, and used ALMOND MILK instead of buttermilk. They were amazing, and just the right texture. I will use a little less baking soda next time though! My kids loved them, and so did I!! :-) Thanks!!

This was good and so easy.  I just used my blender (no food processor) and add lemon juice to my milk.  I didn't have quite enough milk so I added apple cider to make up the difference! Then I topped them with apples and cranberries that I cooked down a little bit. I used applesauce instead of oil, just what I had.  My kids ate them up and then wanted more and the extra ones they ate plain and still loved them! I will make this often and double it so there are plenty to freeze!

This recipe is soooooo good! I made some substitutions of course because I didn't have buttermilk on hand, I used greek yogurt and thinned it out with almond milk, about equal parts of each to make 3/4 cup. I also used wheat flour instead of all-purpose and this was so delicious. My first oatmeal pancake recipe I've tried and I love it!

These were delicious. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of processing the dry ingredients first then incorporating the wet.  I added about 1/2 cup of milk but only because we prefer thinner pancakes.  Great taste and texture!

I did make a couple minor changes by using whole wheat flour, melted butter instead of oil, and adding some mini chocolate chips and banana after the batter was blended. I dont have a food processor right now :( so i used my blender. These came out so tender and wonderful. I will definitely use this recipe from now on.  Thank you!

My family loved these.  I did not purée in a food processor, used kefir instead of buttermilk and butter instead of oil.  Will definitely make these again.  A double recipe served our family of 4 with 2 left over.

These were fantastic.  My mom makes these as written (and they are delicious) but we try to eat as clean as possible in our house.  I made these with white whole wheat flour, minimal salt (really don't need much), applesauce instead of oil, sugar-in-the-raw instead of white sugar (will be trying honey as a replacement soon) and added ground flaxseed.  My 13 month old devoured them with applesauce topping.  I make a double batch and keep the batter in the frig. for a couple days.  I have also froze them but they are much better fresh!  If you do freeze, I recommend placing wax paper or parchment paper between them - or they are a bear to get apart.

These are great. I processed the oats to make oat flour and mixed by hand instead and I also whipped the egg whites separate and then folded them in to make a lighter batter because oats give it a more hearty, dense texture. I would suggest to not substitute with milk and use the buttermilk, buttermilk powder reconstituted in water according to the package, or make buttermilk because they add that traditional buttermilky pancake taste to these. Regular milk is fine if you don't have buttermilk but the flavor just isn't the same. Otherwise, I served with bananas and syrup an they were delicious.

We had these for dinner tonight and they were absolutely delicious. I made them exactly as the recipe specified except I had no buttermilk on hand so I used 2% milk and a squeeze of lemon. The texture was really excellent - I was surprised they were so fluffy considering the oats. Instead of the food processor, I used my stick blender in the bowl I mixed them in so cleanup was super easy. This is now my go-to pancake recipe. Thanks, mom2hh!

WOW!  What a great rib-sticking recipe.  I did not process the ingredients; instead, I soaked my rolled oats (didn't have quick cooking) in my milk + vinegar for 15 minutes or so.  I also subbed with Splenda Sugar Blend, applesauce and plain egg substitute.  I was really worried when the mixture fell flat on the pan, but they ended up puffing up nicely.  My only problem was that my pancakes keep sticking to the pan, but that may have been my own doing (by not processing the oats).  Other than that, I found this recipe DELISH! and may actually have to abandon my previously go-to pancake recipe for this one!  Thanks for sharing it mom2hhh :):):)

My son's friend stayed over night and I made this pancake recipe for them in the morning (it's a family favorite).  His mom called me the next day a little annoyed to ask for the recipe because he raved that these pancakes were better than anything she has ever made.  And she's a really good cook!  Be generous with the vanilla!

I made quite a few changes based on others' recommendations and to make it healthier and it still turned out well.  I used old fashioned oats (finely grounded in the food processor) instead of quick cooking oats, skim milk instead of buttermilk, 1/4 teaspoon salt instead of a 1/2 teaspoon and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda instead of a 1/2 teaspoon.  The batter seemed a bit thin, but cooked up fine.

What a fantastically simple recipe.  I substituted whole milk instead of buttermilk since I did not have it on hand and followed all other ingredients as stated.  The pancakes turned out fluffy and tasty.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I have no idea what I did to these.  They did not turn out well at all.  At first they were very, very runny. I added a bit more flour and oatmeal.  They ended up being very pasty and pretty tasteless.  All of my ingredients were fresh and not expired. I'm not sure what the problem was...

Absolutely delicious! But I would definitely double or even triple it. This was enough for me and my two little ones to have 2 pancakes each.

My kids like pancakes. But they LOVE these pancakes! 
I followed the recipe, but I wasn't sure if I was supposed to put the oats in the food processor...so I did. Also I had to add just a little extra flour because the batter was a little too thin, that could have been a mistake on my part. My husband didn't even get to try them! The kids ate them all before he got home from work. Def making this our regular pancake recipe!

I really like this recipe, as it actually yields fluffy oatmeal pancakes, rather than dense ones.  I've made it 4 or 5 times now, and my 2 & 4 yo kids love it.  After reading the suggestions of several reviewers, I put the oatmeal in the food processor and pulse it to a fine powder.  I also let the batter sit for about 20 minutes so that the oats have time to absorb liquid.  I use brown sugar, I add about 1 tsp of cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice, and I add a 1/2 cup of finely ground almonds.  I like to triple the recipe, and keep some extra pancakes in the freezer for quick breakfasts on school mornings.  I microwave them for 15-20 seconds, then toss them in the toaster for two minutes.  Great recipe.

Really YUMMY!   I make pancakes practically every weekend.  I ground the oats. Mixture was a little thick, so I added 2/3 c. milk to original recipe.   Cooked on med. heat.   Served with homemade berry syrup.   Light, fluffy and a huge hit!  I'll make these again.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled it but left out the extra egg, and replaced a tablespoon of oil with a half a zucchini.  Also, I didn't have any buttermilk, so I took a can of evaporated milk and added a tablespoon of white vinegar.  And instead of vanilla, I added a tablespoon of maple syrup (since that's what I had on hand) and another tablespoon of sugar.  The food processor definitely helped everything blend well, and on low heat, the outcome looked and tasted great!

Made exactly as written. Really good flavor. Though they were soft, these were a little flat so next time I'll try increasing the leavening because I like my pancakes fluffier.

Great recipe!  Doubled the recipe and made some substitutions for clean easing:  whole wheat flour, honey for sugar, applesauce for oil, plain yogurt for buttermilk.  Reduced baking soda (as per other suggestions). Added one mashed banana.

So good! I left out the egg (my son has allergy), used 1% milk instead of buttermilk, added cinnamon, and I didn't puree-I liked this cause I thought it made them taste like oatmeal cookies.

This is such an excellent recipe. I use it all the time. The pancakes are pretty thin but the flavor is wonderful. So easy too. I never have buttermilk so I just add a little lemon juice to the milk. Perfect.

My son and his friend loved these pancakes (and his friend is a picky eater!)   I modified using Nutri-blend (half whole wheat flour), and added 2 tablespoons of ground Flaxseed.   After reading other reviewers comments, I doubled the recipe but only used 1 teaspoon each for baking soda and baking powder. Only used 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Used brown sugar and 1 % milk (I didn't have buttermilk).  Also, I don't have a food processor, but used my mini-chopper for the oatmeal and soaked in milk (as suggested by another reviewer) while getting all ingredients ready.  Will try variations next time.  Adding bananas sounds yummy.

These were really good.  I doubled the recipe and added a little pumpkin pie spice to make them fall-ish.  My husband and two year old loved them.  Side note: there's no need to substitute skim milk for the buttermilk because buttermilk naturally is low fat and can often be found fat free.  Excellent recipe!  Thank you for sharing.

The only reason I'm giving this recipe 3 stars is becuase my kids ate it. The taste wasn't TOO bad, but honestly these were the flattest pancakes I've ever made. They were WAY too watery right off the bat, I added a bit more flour but that didn't help much.  These weren't fluffy at all and nothing like the picture I see.  I don't think I did anything wrong here. My baking flour/soda were both new and all my ingredients were fresh. I'm not sure how mine went so wrong.  I even let the dry and wet sit a while hoping that the wet ingredients would soak into the oatmeal and that helped a TINY bit but not much.

This is my go to pancake recipe. Depending on what I have on hand, I sometimes use milk instead of buttermilk - it's still perfect. I use brown sugar instead of white and add cinnamon plus whatever fruit I have on hand. It's perfect! They are thick and fluffy, almost like muffins.

Of all the pancakes I've ever had, this is by far the best recipe I've come across. The oatmeal is not overbearing but gives the pancakes a yummy texture. I substituted half of the flour with wheat flour and like a past reviewer, I decided to omit the white sugar and added in 2 TBSP brown sugar instead. Turned out great! If you're the kind of person that submerges their pancakes in syrup and sweet fruit toppings however, I would maybe decrease the 2 TBSP brown sugar to 1 or 1 1/2 TBSP.

I used regular milk and it worked out fine. It made about 7 pancakes. I added banana and blueberries.  Delish and filling.

These were yummy!!  They were a great alternative to the box mix that I've always used.  I had oatmeal pancakes for the first time last week at a little diner and I thought, "I can make these myself."  I liked the ones that I was served so much that I made some myself.  I took advice and lightened up on the salt.  I used 1/4 tsp.  I used 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  I included almond extract along with the vanilla, since I had them both on had.  The almond was really flavorful.  I doubled the recipe because others said the single batch didn't make enough.  With the doubling, I had 8 pancakes to serve to a family of 4.  They weren't huge pancakes.  Probably more like medium sized.  I added 1 1/2 cups of oats because after doubling, I feared the batter would be too watery.  Everything fluffed up perfectly.  I cannot wait to make these again soon.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I made my own by including 1 TBL of lemon juice in the milk.

I just made these for my husband and myself and they were very good! I did tweak the recipe for our tastes...I used whole wheat organic flour, organic whole oats and replaced the sugar with a tablespoon of Maltitol (less sugar)...I didn't have buttermilk so I used a 6oz. container of organic vanilla yogurt plus 1/4 cup fat free milk...I don't have a food processor so I put the liquid ingredients in the blender first and then added the rest...I let it rest for about 10-15 minutes.. In a small pot on the stove over medium heat I put in half a bag of frozen mixed berries, about 1/4 cup water and a tablespoon all fruit cherry jelly... Let simmer while the pancakes are cooking...The results were amazing! Very light, delicious pancakes! Serve with butter, Agave Nectar and a little Redi Whip if desired...

These were good not my most favorite but a good recipe. I made mine with whole wheat, splenda, and maybe a tsp veg oil and just increaded the buttermilk to 1 cup. I added blueberries and they were good. Thanx for sharing

Nice, light pancake.  Love the whole-grain goodness of the oatmeal.  I added 5-6 thin banana slices to each pancake as the first bubbles appeared.

I used 1% milk on these so I can't give the most "honest" review of the recipe since it calls for buttermilk.  BUT, that being said, I really thought this was a great basic recipe for healthy pancakes.  I added cinnamon and raisins and substituted 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour.  I would triple the recipe if you have a few kids and want any leftovers! I snacked on the leftovers straight out of the fridge and they were yummy.

These pancakes are so good!  I like others, substituted WW flour (freshly milled) honey in place of sugar and applesauce in place of oil.  I also added a little cinnamon.  I love the oatmeal addition!  Great recipe. I had to give 4 stars, because I changed some things.

This recipe is great as is, but I've made a few changes that make it even better! I use apple sauce instead of the oil, whole wheat flour, and brown sugar. I also mashed up a banana and added pecan chips to the batter. These taste great without any butter or syrup!

Tried these this morning.  Very good and I think the secret is using the food processor to really get the dry ingredients finely ground and blended.  To add to the healthy note, I added 1 tbsp flax seed (freshly ground, of course) and subbed applesauce for the oil.  Also, dropped in a few blueberries for Vit C and other antioxidants.

I find this recipe much too thin so I blend everything together and then stir in an EXTRA 3/4 cup oats and 1/4 cup flour.  Then it's PERFECT!  I now choose it over bisquick :)  I use all whole wheat flour and rolled instead of quick oats.  I never have buttermilk on hand so I just do the substitute of milk with a dash of vinegar.  I LOVE THESE PANCAKES!

I mixed the liquids first in a blender, and then added the dry ingredients a little at a time, blending in between each add.  I poured the batter directly from the blender. These are the best pancakes I've ever had...and they disappeared quickly! I would definitely suggest doubling the recipe though - this doesn't make much at all!

Great recipe!!!  Just made a couple of changes per our preference.  Like other reviewers, I substituted whole wheat for all purpose flour. I also used honey instead of sugar, skim milk instead of buttermilk and applesauce instead of oil.  I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped nuts.  I mixed everything in the blender.  I added the baking soda and the powder after everything was mixed for 1-2 minutes.  These pancakes cook really fast and were very tasty!   Thanks again!

So, I didn't have most of the ingredients on hand, but the recipe was great for a basic oatmeal recipe.   Instead of flour, I used whole wheat pancake mix and omitted the baking soda and powder. I used skim milk instead of buttermilk and included all the other ingredients.   I should have added the sugar, but I used lite syrup and it was delish. I did a happy, happy oatmeal pancake dance at the end. Thanks!

This is a great recipe! I make it for my kids all the time. I don't use a food processor, though - I blend it up in my blender (a VitaMix) until the oatmeal is totally smooth. The other changes I make are to use whole wheat flour, and add 1/8 cup ground flax seed and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Oh, and I often half the milk with apple juice to add some extra sweetness. These pancakes are surprisingly light and fluffy, and once my family got past the fact that "they're brown," they really enjoyed them.  I double this recipe every time I make it and freeze the extras for quick before-school breakfasts.

We love this recipe.  The first time we made them, though, I used the recommended amount of salt and my husband couldn't eat them.  Since then, I only use 1/4 tsp salt.  Also, 1/2 tsp baking powder seems to work just fine as well.  Our only problem is that the recipe only makes a teeny tiny amount.  Even when we double it, it is barely enough for myself, husband, and toddler.  We feel like we need to quadruple the darn thing if we want to have any leftovers for toasting (and we do).

This recipe was quick and easy!!! I thought it was easier to just mix it up by hand with a whisk and it turned out delicious.  I will definitely use this recipe again... it is even more delicious adding a handful of frozen blueberries to the batter!

good flavor, but personally I was looking for a crunchier texture, so I'll try this next time mixing by hand as opposed to the blender.  I used a muesli type oatmeal mix with sunflower seeds, flax and almonds.  All of which disappeared when I blended it.

I am in awe of this recipe, I wish I could give it a million stars! I have tried many "healthy" pancake recipes over the years only to be dissapointed and SO aware that you're eating a healthy pancake. Not here.  This was so delicious, i wouild choose it over a white pancake anyday!  I used brown rice flour I had ground in place of the other flour.  Used whole oats instead of quick cooking.  And used my own homemade yogurt in place of the buttermilk.  Blending in the blender (I used my vita mix) until smooth was key.  I stopped blending too soon and th first few were strange.  So amazing, thank you so much for this recipe!!

My son loved the pancakes.  They were good, but at the same time the pancake seems to be thick and heavy. You will need something to drink.

4.5 stars. Good, use extra vanilla to cut out soda taste.  Made 6 pancakes.  Do not really taste the oatmeal.  Thin batter, but probably because I used skim milk instead of buttermilk because it is all I had.

Yum!  We had these for dinner with strawberries on top and it was great and easy.  Used wheat flour and milk with a bit of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk.  Will make again for sure.

Great pancakes!  I used milk and a little vinegar instead of buttermilk, which worked just fine.  There weren't any left!

These were great with a few changes; I used brown sugar, applesauce instead of oil (as I do in most recipes) and thinned out sour cream with milk. Also added 1 cup of blueberries. Doubled the recipe and I let the extras cool on a rack. Then I put them in a storage bag and freeze. For a quick snack or breakfast reheat in a toaster oven! Yummy!

Great pancakes!  I substituted honey for the sugar and flax seed for half of the oil.  I also added a little bit of cinnamon.  My husband said they tasted like cookies!

these are the best pancakes i have ever eaten - hands down!  i made a vegan option by using egg replacer and coconut milk.  they came out light, fluffy, moist and filling.  the quantities made about 6 small pancakes.  we also tried adding raisins and coconut shreds - a great combo!

Delicious!  I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so just used 1%.  Also, my food processor was dirty so I just whisked it all together.  They came out good!  I even added some chopped pecans and diced strawberries for a little extra flavor.

Very easy and quick and a nice change of pace from regular pancakes.  I've used 1% milk many times instead of buttermilk and it still turns out well.  The batter is a little thin, but don't worry about it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were really pretty good - I used half whole wheat flour and half regular white - the mixture was quite thin so I added another 1/4 cup of flour. I also used Splenda and did the milk with lemon juice trick for the buttermilk. I did add raspberries and blackberries and that really made them yummy. If ihadn't they would have been really boring. Still, will probably make again adding more vanilla and definitely the fruit.

Tip: One package of instant oatmeal = 1/2 cup. We used flax oatmeal and these were absolutely delicious! I did prep it in the food processor and then let the batter sit and thicken up. Very tasty!

Flavor and texture was great.  On the runny side (even for pancakes).  Didn't change a thing though and they turned out OK.  My kids enjoyed them.

Perfectly delicious. Just used milk, because I didn't have buttermilk and was too lazy to make the vinegar-milk replacement. They were still wonderful. All 5 members of the family loved this breakfast!

Very good Pancakes!!!  The only thing i did was, i didn't put the whole thing in the blender.  I think it over beats the batter and kills the baking powder.  i just soaked the oatmeal in the with the milk and use a hand blender to blend it all up.  Defenlty don't want to over beat the batter in this recipe, makes them flat as ever.  Thank you for sharing!!!  Defently going to be one of our favorites.

These pancakes were easy to make and tasted really good!  I used regular milk and only 1/4 tsp. baking soda.  I added dried cranberries and my 4 yr old daughter LOVED them, and so did I.  I thought they could have used some cinnamon, so next time I will add that.

Used 2% milk and steel cut oats, double batched, and 90% of it was consumed by 4 picky pre-Ks that refuse to touch oatmeal in my other efforts. I will add this to my weekly line up.

These were terrific!  I added blueberries, bananas, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Cut back on salt and baking soda.  Didn't have buttermilk so I used a combo of 1% milk and lowfat plain yogurt.  Family loved them!

I made these with butter instead of the oil because i did'nt have any good oil. I also added a tsp of cinnamon and used large oatmeal flakes. These were delicious. My 2 year son and I enjoyed them :).

Delicious with less salt!!! Turned out fine for me without processing the batter too! And if you want to cut calories - halving the oil works perfectly!!!

We really liked this pancake! ... I made some adjustments to the original recipe: no baking soda, I subbed spelt flour for all purpose, and I added one mashed banana as a sub for both the sugar and oil, the banana also added some extra flavour ... and since I didn't have a food processor on hand I just whisked the dry ingredients into the wets.

These were wonderful.  I didn't have the buttermilk, so I substituted part sour cream and part milk.  I'm going to add chopped pecans next time too.

Wow! These pancakes are aweseome! I substituted 1% milk for the buttermilk which worked out just fine. I also added a whole banana (which I probably should have only added half of one--it made the pancake texture as if it wasn't cooked all the way through--my fault, but they were still tasty!) The recipe does make a small batch, so if cooking for more than two people, definitely double or triple the recipe. And try adding the banana! (half of one for each single batch is my suggestion) Yummy! =)

These were quite tasty. The texture is different but good. I reduced the oil to only about a tablespoon and added 1/4 cup of applesauce and some cinnamon. I also just used regular milk.

Excellent recipe.  It's a big hit in my house with the exception of my VERY picky 9 year old.  I did make some changes (but not substantial ones).  I substituted brown sugar for white and egg white substitute for the whole eggs.  I also used lowfat buttermilk.  Those changes made a solid difference in the fat content but maintained the flavor.  Next time, I'll probably see if I can use some Splenda brown sugar to help even more.  This was excellent.

These have become our weekly Sunday breakfast.  I always add blueberries, and if I'm feeling healthier, I substitute applesauce for the oil and whole wheat flour for the white four and they are still delicious!

These pancakes were great. I only blended the oatmeal by itself, then mixed everything else in a bowl. I also used wole wheat flour instead of white.

I love this recipe! I used about 1/2 a teaspoon more of vanilla extract,egg whites instead of the whole egg and used apple sauce instead of vegetable oil for a healthier alternative. They still turned out great!

These were delicious, I used less salt and 1/4 wheat flour with 1/4 allpurpose flour. Also didn't have buttermilk so I used half and half. Next time I will double the recipe because it only made eight 4-5" in diameter pancakes. We are a family of 5, and it wasn't quite enough! These are my NEW recipe, no more bisquick!!! Thanks!

We just "discovered" this recipe last week and have already made them 3 times! Huge hit with everyone, especially the kids.  I have to make a triple batch so we have some to stick in the fridge in a ziplock bag.  Yep, we will eat them right out of the fridge!  I added 1 TBS of brown sugar.  You can make several batches of just the dry ingredients and keep it in a ziplock bag in the fridge- 2cups of dry mix-then double all your wet ingrediants.

These were really good. I did half the baking soda and baking powder. Also, I added pecans while I was blending the batter and added pancake syrup and halved pecans before serving. Really good. I wonder if I could use Quaker Oats Oatmeal and make different flavored pancakes? Hmmmm.....?

GREAT RECIPE!! I followed some other tips and used less baking soda, and added a little brown sugar, it made them so much sweeter. These are honestly some of the best pancakes I have ever made. There may have been a little too much oatmeal so the next batch I might use a little less.

I make these pancakes a couple times a month, but I never measure and I make a few modifications.  I use a combination of old-fashion oats and quick oats for texture, and I soften them in the microwave with some milk and water before adding the other ingredients.  I substitute milk for the buttermilk, and I often add blueberries. We top with real maple syrup, which makes these pancakes incredible. You'll need to add extra milk if you make the pancakes my way... don't ask how much b/c I never measure.  Enjoy!

This is an excellent recipe for oatmeal pancakes.  I have to be honest and tell you that I did not have buttermilk, I used regular whole milk and I added an extra tablespoon of oil...PERFECTION PERSONIFIED!!!  I cooked some this morning for my husband and daughter and they just raved and raved and these are people who didn't love oatmeal pancakes.

These pancakes are the best! I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and got a batch of moist, fluffy, yummy pancakes! I've added cinnamon and bananas to the batter too, and it's been great!

These were okay, but did require some modifications.  I followed LDYLVBGR's lead with the brown sugar, baking soda and cinnamon measurements/additions.  These don't stand out enough for me to make again, but it's always nice to try something different.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Excellent recipe! I subbed soy milk for buttermilk, honey for sugar, 2 egg whites for the 1 egg, added a couple tablespoons each of milled flax seed and wheat germ, and about a teaspoon or so of cinnamon. The texture was great and they were so fluffy.

these were pretty good. i subbed whole wheat flour for the white. used honey in place of the white, and added a fair amount of frozen blueberries.

topped with honey and butter. my toddler loved them. they tasted super, but looked really flat. next time i will add some ground up flax meal to make them healthier, and might try making them with banana to switch it up.

I will NEVER buy box pancake mix again!  This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I substituted 1/4 cup AP flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat for the half cup AP flour. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I also found there was no no need grease my griddle.  I have a good quality pan, used NO grease on it, and the pancakes brown perfectly.  Can't wait to add nuts next time.  Also, just mixed in my blender and it ground up the oatmeal perfectly and then just poured in the griddle.

These were not the worst pancakes I've ever had but they were pretty flavorless. It tasted like plan oatmeal to me. I think if I decide to make these again, I will add some spices like cinnamon to it or some fruits to give it more flavor.

These are by far the best pancakes I have ever made. My son who does not like pancakes said these were pretty darn good. I myself made just 2 adjustments and that was I added a little more cinnamon plus added a pinch of allspice. FANTASTIC!!

This was so good.  I was actually shocked because I didn't think it would be.  I used splenda instead of sugar, added cinnamon and used egg substitute.  VERY DELIGHTFUL!  With the homemade buttermilk syrup it was SUPREME.

SOOOO GOOD! Made them exactly as the recipe says - the kids were so impressed. They loved them. My recommendation is to make a double batch because the recipe only makes 7-8 pancakes and my 6 year old ate 3! Will make again and again. Even called the neighbor girls over to try them - a sure hit!

I gave this 4 stars because my pancakes were not fluffy at all. I did like the texture but just not sure what went wrong on the fluffiness. Will definitely make again though.

We love this recipe, and find it a great way to get the kids to eat oatmeal.  We double it for our family of five, and usually only have a couple of pancakes left over.  Our four year old son LOVES these with Apple Butter instead of syrup.

These were very light and fluffy!  I used skim milk, added a little extra flour & tossed in a ripe banana.  Tossed it all in the blender and then added some walnuts!  Great pancakes!  Thanks for the recipe!

I love these pancakes.  I used strawberry flavoured buttermilk and used whole wheat fl instead of white.  I was out of instant oats and I ended up using ground old fashioned rolled oats.  I froze the leftover pancakes and reheated it in a bread toaster.  It's a easy b'fast/snack for my toddler- saves me time! Thanks!

Great recipe! I made a few alterations to make it a little more healthy.  Used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and didn't blend them totally smooth in the food processor to keep the oats a little more in their natural state.  Also, I hadn't realized I was out of milk before starting so I used powdered milk, water and a little half and half with some vinegar for the buttermilk.  I omitted the oil, just because I forgot to put it in and used Splenda instead of sugar.  But having said that, the base recipe is awesome if I can make so many changes and have it come out so well!  Even my somewhat picky husband liked them...and he's not into healthy breakfasts!

These are very good, especially considering how healthy they are. I substituted whole wheat flour to add more fiber, cinnamon to give them extra spice, and milk since I had no buttermilk. Sorry that I'm rating with all the changes, but I'm sure they would have been equally good or even better if made the original way.

This recipe was delightfully delicious.  I am a pancake lover and normally make Good Old Fashioned Pancakes from this website, but if you are in the mood for something different or you have some oats or buttermilk to use up, this is great!  I loved the vanilla flavor to it.  Yum, yum!

The pancakes were nice and heavy, but I thought they lacked a "full" flavor.  I have 3 kids and they didn't care for them.  I may try them again, but I'll add cinnamon, honey or banannas.  They simply tasted like oatmeal to me.

These pancakes were so yummy and such a pretty site.  They cooked up into perfect little round puffs.  I did think the batter was too runny so after reading the reviews I added just a bit of whole wheat flour (1/4 cup) but they cooked up so nicely that maybe I didn't really need it after all?  I like to make my pancake batter ahead and just add the wet ingredients in the morning so I'm not sure this recipe is that kind of user friendly but really quite a healthy treat.  Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe. I tweaked a few things according to other reviews such as the salt, the buttermilk, and I added ground flaxseed.

I made these for breakfast and my kids all enjoyed them.  I found after I started that I was out of quick cooking oats so I used old fashioned, out of buttermilk so I used regular milk with vinegar (out of reg vinegar so I used rice vinegar in desperation!) Despite all this they came together quickly and beautifully (BTW, I am not a bad planner.  My college-age daughter lives away, but close enough that she can come home and raid my pantry and fridge without any notice. Apparently she was here yesterday. Love my daughter and I don't want her to starve on her tight budget, but this is making me crazy!)

I made these with whole wheat flour. They were good, better than the good old fashioned pancakes on this site. I didn't have veg oil, used 1 Tablespoon of light butter and 1 tsp of olive oil.

i am a multi grain pancake addict
these were sooooooo good
kinda hard to flip but if i kept the burner on medium and let them cook a little slower, then they browned slowly enough that they firmed up well before i had to flip them. for my husband and son who prefer regular pancakes, i added chocolate chips and they went nuts!

Great pancakes! Nice flavor, texture and they cooke dup nicely. I didn't add salt per the advice of other reviewers and they had a nice, mildly sweet flavor. Will make again and again.

I followed the recipe relatively closely, although I only used a pinch of salt and I used 2% milk instead of buttermilk. I mixed it up in the Magic Bullet and blended it for maybe 10 seconds. After blending it, I let it sit for five minutse or so and then I added 5 strawberries (chopped) and I mixed them in with a spoon. Very good. :) The texture is different than I'm used to, but it's a nice change! Thanks for sharing, Letha!

Very easy to make and very little dirty dishes. Tossed everything in my blender and poured it from the blender into the pan. Taste better and healthier than the pancakes I used to make!

these are amazing and VERY easy to make.  i am not in possession of a food processor so the blender is my weapon of choice.  i substitute the buttermilk w/ plain or milk or sometimes yogurt and add 1/4 cup of wheat germ.  i also add whatever fruit may be lying around the house--apples, bananas, etc.  i've added vegies in the past, carrots, zucchini--it's a good spot to hide the vegies where the kids will never think of looking!!  there is no need to oil the pan as the batter has oil in it and browns nicely without extra.  let's put it this way--my family now eats their pancakes w/out syrup!!  yes, they are that good.  thank you so much for sharing!

Wow! My husband hates oatmeal but he loves these pancakes. Next time I will double the recipe since it only made about 6 pancakes. Also I didnt use a processor or buttermilk and it was still a great recipe. Thanks

This is a solid, four star recipe!  Hope you enjoy the simplicity - just because it's easy to throw together, doesn't mean you'll sacrifice on taste; they're delicious!

Very good, very easy. I used old fashioned oats. I don't have a food processor so I combined all the dry ingredients in one bowl, all the wet in another. I then combined the two. They turned out fine. Will make these again.

Very good, but not spectacular. I used milk soured with lemon juice in place of the buttermilk, and topped them with blackberry syrup. Yum! I look forward to tweaking this, as it is our new default recipe. Thanks!

Great recipe!  Running it thru the food processor is a key factor in its success. We were short on supplies but I made do with substitutions - had to use two packets of instant oatmeal (brown sugar variety) and used regular milk cut with blueberry yogurt for the buttermilk. Also used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  I didn't add sugar (enough in the oatmeal mix), but I did add cinnamon and nutmeg. Forgot to add the oil, but in the end it turned out great - the kids (who usually won't touch anything but white pancakes) ate them all up. Even the toddler.

Wonderful pancakes with lovely texture.  We used an equal amount of yogurt to replace the buttermilk and it was perfect.  Let the oats soak in the buttermilk or yogurt for a few minutes, and be sure to lightly oil the pan before cooking!

Really good flavor - I doubled the recipe and followed the measurements exactly, turned out very well!  My children loved them!! I like another reviewer had no buttermilk, and used 2% milk instead.

Awful, awful stuff!! Baking soda taste was way too strong and the batter was much too thin.  Never again!

these were hearty and tasty.  resist the urge to flatten them with the spatula though - they are much better when they are fluffy!

This recipe is so yummy!  It isn't heavy like some oatmeal pancake recipes, especially if you use a blender or food processor to mix.

I loved these pancakes.  They are quick and easy to make.  The only thing that i would change is the thickness of the batter.  It is quite thin.

These were OK, nothing extraordinary, but they weren't bad.  I don't have a food processor so I didn't blend the ingredients.  I also used less soda than the recipe called for because of the other review I read.  They were good with real maple syrup, though. :)
