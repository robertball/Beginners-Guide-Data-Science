Very Good. The only thing I would change is using whole tomato's to diced tomato's since you end up cutting them up anyway. Very yummy. I opted out of the cream cheese. Need less of quantity for us 5 people.

Very tasty! Have never had tomato gravy before, but this is EASY and makes a great breakfast! Have to say it's biggest downfall is the pink color..But really was GOOD!

Wanted to try something new and this was it.  Fairly easy to make - I used peeled, crushed tomatoes and left out the cream cheese.  It is still on the stove, haven't served it yet but my taste-testing tell me this is something that will be very versatile and I will be making it agaiin.  Thanks for posting this for us Yankees, Bella.

Delicious and an unexpected treat for those who've never had it. The reason for using whole tomatoes is that canned diced tomatoes have something on them so they don't stew like they should to make this at its best. I add 1 tablespoon sugar in the Southern manner.

I was so surprised to see this recipe on here! My 90 year old grandmother made it often in the summer when we had tomatoes from the garden. She still makes it for me! Most people have never heard of it. Ours isn't an exact recipe but very similar to this one. Use fresh garden tomatoes if possible but I have made it with canned before. If you use fresh tomatoes blanch and peel them first then course chop them as they will break down some while simmering anyway. We also add chopped onions and green peppers (you can sauté these a little before adding if you want them more tender) and some salt and pepper. I've never added cream cheese but would like to try it that way. I use what ever milk or cream is on hand. Usually don't add the milk until after the vegetables have simmered a while. Mainly because a lot of water comes out of the fresh tomatoes and I don't want it to end up too thin. I had only ever eaten it over cornbread until a friend mentioned it would be good on pasta. He was right! I love it poured over cavatappi pasta.

My husband only likes brown gravy on his chicken fried steak. I however am more adventurous. I tried it by cutting it in half, only used 3 slices of bacon crumbled into finished gravy, patite roasted diced tomatoes with onions, adding more sautéed onions and chopped garlic. OMG! So good on chicken fried steak!
