First time hummus recipe for me as I'm tired of paying the price for such a small amount and I like as a snack on Triscuits in the afternoon.  I followed the recipe pretty close although I did bake my sweet potato in the microwave, put in refrig and skin came off easily when I was ready to start recipe.  Other than that I followed the recipe perfectly but found that it was so dry I couldn't use my Ninja blender with any success nor my Cuisinart hand blender after emptying into a bowl -- dry and too thick.  Soooo, I Googled and discovered that many hummus recipes add water while blending to reach desired consistency.  I added an extra TBSP of lime juice, added water to the garbanzo bean can to rinse and added slowly as I blended with Cuisinart until it loosened up a bit.  It's beautiful, it's tastes great and I would make it again.  Next time I will not drain the beans and I think that might solve my dilemma.  Love that it made such a large batch.

What a unique and tasty marriage of flavors! I didn't plan to change anything, but found that I didn't have any lime juice on hand. I substituted lemon juice instead with great results. For presentation, I sprinkled chia seeds over top. I love it and can't wait to share with friends and family! Thank you Megan for posting this delicious recipe!

Yummy! I omitted the oil and used vegetable broth. Also decreased the amount of cumin and cayenne pepper. Substituted smoky paprika. Delicious!

Liked a lot!  I used tahini instead of oil and left out the cumin and cayenne.
