I have made these, but my version is lazier.  I use about 3/4 cup salsa or picante sauce instead of the onions and taco sauce.  I just stir everything together in a big bowl to make a filling, rather than layering the individual burritos, and I also only bake them for 8-10 minutes, without turning; just enough for a firm burrito that's not too crunchy.  I have made them with and without ground beef with equally good results.  My whole family loves these!

This was a great recipe!  The only thing I did differently was to spray the outside of the burritos with cooking spray prior to baking.  I increased the temperature to 400 degrees and baked for about 15 minutes.  Then, I turned the oven temperature to broil and cooked 5 minutes more.  They came out crispy and delicious.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

This turned out one of the best burritos I've ever fixed at home. I used dried minced onion about 2 T worth and only 1/4 c Julio's hot salsa since it was "hot" and not mild. I left out the black beans. I just tossed all the filling ingredients in the skillet at the start with about 3/4 c of chicken broth to break down the meat to a fine texture and simmered this until the liquid was gone. (That is how I always brown my taco meat) I had impatient diners so I only let this bake half the time called for and they were only crispy on one side as a result. This was still a huge hit here and my husband even remarked this was probably my best taco meat this year. I am always trying out new recipes. A keeper! Thanks we loved these.
UPDATE 7-27-12: I made this again using 1 cup water and 1 cube chicken bullion at the start to break the meat down to fine particles, 1 TBL dried minced onion and 1 tsp onion powder and then the 1/2 c of medium Julio's salsa (taco sauce) as called for. YUMMO! This is so delicious as works perfectly for the best taco/burrito/enchilada/tostada/taco salad filling.

Yummy! The only thing I did was use a taco seasoning instead of the spices and wow these we're good! Will make these again.

Wonderful recipe!!  Just as it is is really good, but then I tried it with "Slow Cooker Shredded Beef for Tacos and Burritos" in place of the gr. beef  mixture. Oh man!  Not quick, but so, so delicious.  Rivals "Tito's Tacos" burritos in Culver City (don't know if it's still there, but was a childhood fav.

For some reason this was my first time making burritos. Maybe I thought it would be too difficult, but these are easy and delicious! Followed the recipe except that I used a Mccormick burrito seasoning packet that I had in the cupboard in place of the spices. I also added rice and pinto beans to each burrito whch made a very hearty meal. I will make these again for sure when we want Mexican but are not in the mood for tacos.

Awesome dish, give lots of room for personalization. I added chopped jalapeños and mixed the refried beans with hamburger mix before placing on tortillas. 
A new family fav!

Made this the first time as written, and we weren’t thrilled with the seasoning or oven baking the burritos - - gave it a 4*. We now make this by subbing 1 tablespoon Taco Seasoning I by Echols & Sazon Tropical to taste, and omitting the chili powder & ground cumin. Also add 1/2 chopped green bell pepper. Time permitting, make Luscious Turkey Bacon Refried Beans and Mexican Rice III, both of which are from this site and used to stuff the burritos. Rather than oven bake, simply wrap each burrito in a moist paper towel and microwave for about 3 minutes @ 70% to get a soft and moist tortilla.

I loved this, so did my husband. I used salsa instead of taco sauce and used a pack of taco seasoning. I split it between the meat and the beans. I cooked a little longer to get crispier. I could only find 9in burritos and used about 1/4 cup each for the filling and was a little short. and we skipped the sour cream

I liked this recipe but it was kinda bland.  I think next time I will add some more spice, maybe a jalopeno or some hot sauce.

OMG! Delicious! This was a huge hit with my family we all enjoyed it even my 8 year old. This is the first time I have ever made burritos and boy boy boy had our taste buds dancing in our mouths. We all topped it with lettuce cheese and sour cream and some of us used medium taco sauce and some of us used salsa. For the side dish I made mexican rice which was Taco Bell and I want to say Uncle Bens mexican rice that you have to heat in the microwave for 60 or 90 second rice in the packet that you have to heat up in the microwave.  I did'nt change anything in the making. This was a quick and easy meal and WILL get made alot more times in my famuily.

No problems with the recipe--these are easy and taste fine; they're just nothing special.  I didn't have refried beans, so I just mashed up some pinto beans and added them to the meat for the last few minutes of cooking.  And I added jalapenos.  I might make them again; but I might instead look for a recipe that really knocks my socks off.  Just my preference!

We really loved these burritos. I used a packet of taco seasoning instead of all the spices and used garlic and onion powders instead of the real thing. I also skipped the taco sauce and sour cream mixed in the hamburger, I added a can of Spanish rice instead and added the refried beans to the meat and rice, which doubled the filling and I was able to make twice as many burritos. Will be making these again and again! :)

Absolutely phenomenal. Made them as directed; except I used canned beans and Red Kidney beans instead of re-fried. It was a huuuuuge success, and it makes for tons of leftovers!! Loooved it, will definitely make these again!!!

I love this recipe!!! I follow the ingredients, but for the preparation I always seem to break the wrap and meat goes everywhere. So now I put everything in the centre of the wrap and fold in the edges to make a pentagon. Cook the first half with the folded parts down then flip. Amazing!!! My hubby requests this meal about once a week!!

Very good! Tweaked it a bit by using regular refried beans and adding green chilies and a dash of lime juice into beans.

A simple yet tastey recipe. I shredded some leftover potroast in place of ground beef and kept the sour cream on the side due to some anti-sour cream family members. My picky kids loved it and I was free to slather on sour cream, spicy salsa and guacamole on mine!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was quick and easy and the spice measurements were right on.  I topped mine with homemade guacamole, pico de gallo, and sour cream.

Great recipe. Easy. Only thing I changed was adding a little salt. Family of fairly picky eaters all like it a lot.  Make extra and freeze.

I am not a fan of refried beans, so I used a can of Mexicorn instead. Just mixed everything together and voila!

Loved it. But instead of taco sauce and onions i mixed in about 3/4 salsa, and mixed everything together instead of layering

These were bagin'!  Because it was on hand, I substituted with a packet of Taco Seasoning and about a half cup of both black beans and regular refried beans, mixed directly into the meat mixture.  Baked in the toaster oven!  Easy peasy.

Yummy! Delicious! I have made this twice & I will continue to make it. I have to admit I cheat by using taco seasoning & onion powder but only because I was being lazy.

Not my favorite, but my husband loved it! Guess it might be one of those recipes that's based on your own personal Taste Buds : )

Good, not great.  Do not use Velveeta for cheese, my mistake.

This was pretty yummy.  My six-year old gave it the "make again" review.  My husband isn't in yet, but I will update to see what he says.  I served it with Spanish rice and in hindsight will probably include the rice in the filling next time as the flavors compliment each other very well.  To be fair, we omitted the refried beans only because they make my little one ill.  But the meal was great and I will make it again.

I used this recipe the same night I printed it.  It was a winner in my house.  I just added a little more seasoning to my meat. But, my family loved it!  Thanks

Very good recipe.  I only had about 1/4 cup taco sauce, so I seasoned my beef with taco seasoning instead of the garlic, chili powder and cumin.  Also, I topped the burritos with fresh salsa, fresh diced tomatoes and lettuce, along with shredded cheese and sour cream.  These reheated nicely in the oven and remained crispy.  We also added a little chipotle tobasco on the re-heated burritos.  Will definately make this again!
