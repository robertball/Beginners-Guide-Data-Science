I made enough for two sandwiches. I did increase the garlic powder. I used deli sliced mozzerella instead of shredded because that was what I had on hand. Instead of serving this with pasta sauce, I made tomato soup to go with. The kids thought this was wonderful. I didn't have one myself but it smelled/looked amazing. I bet this would work with those frozen garlic toast slices, too.

this was pretty good but needed a more flavorful cheese in the center besides just mozzarella. this was a wonderful way to make a whole bunch of sandwiches all at once and much faster than the skillet method on the stovetop. I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on the tops of side two after I turned them over. Great little sandwich and kind of like pizza. This would be very kid friendly.

These are absolutely delicious!  I added pepperoni slices to them and they were even better!

This is a great twist on the classic grilled cheese sandwich. I personally loved the tip on putting them on a cookie sheet to do more at a time. phew...time saver.

Great change of pace! Mixed the garlic powder & oregano into the butter and used thin slices of buffalo mozzarella. I cooked on a cookie sheet but not under the broiler, in the oven on 400*
