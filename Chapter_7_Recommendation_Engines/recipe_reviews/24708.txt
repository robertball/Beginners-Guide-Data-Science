This was very good!  I didn't have any sunflower seeds so I substituted 1 cup of peanuts instead and it turned out great.  I also only put in 1/4 cup of oil to reduce the fat content, especially since I used peanuts.  Other then that I followed the recipe pretty close and found that it actually makes 4 cups (before being cooked) so I divided it into four different containers, baked one and froze the other three.  After baking let it cool to room temp and it can be shaped into a ball or log for a nice presentation, sprinkle top with dried parsley and paprika too.  Next time I will add some cayenne pepper for a little extra zip.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe! I tried it with triscuits and couldn't stop eating. I don't have a food processor, but I was able to use my blender just as easily. Tastes as good as it smells!

Wonderful! I have missed veggie patê since leaving Montreal, and have been unable to find a recipe.  This is a great one - and so easy too!

I've been making this dish and its variants for decades, and it's a local favorite in Quebec. The choice of yeast is a critical element. In Quebec, torula yeast is fairly common, but in the states people in stores look quizzically at you when you ask for it. Some Asian markets carry it. If you can't find it, look for a primary yeast grown on molasses for the best flavor.

This was wonderful! I also used my blender and it mixed up very well. I made this for a party and one suggestion I would make is to flip the pate onto a large plate or platter - for a more appetizing presentation! Will make this recipe again, THANKS!

Excellent taste! Just like the one I buy at the store, but for a much better value! This recipe yields the equivalent of 4 of those little Fontaine Sante packs and I calculated it costs around $6 to make (vs almost $16 for 4 packs of commercial paté!)
One little thing: next time i'll go with only 1 cup of water maximum instead of 1 1/2 for a denser texture.

Excellent recipe! I hated paying $5 for a small veggie pate at our local farmers market. This was so easy to whip up and I made 2 large pates (2 cup ramekins) and 4 small pates (in 3/4 cup ramekins). The flavour and texture are great. I'll defintely be making this one over and over again.

I really liked this recipe -- I'm glad I came across something like this since it is regularly so expensive in the store (5$ for a 1" slice).    I made this recipe to precision but next time, I'll probably try something different with it since it seems to be a base recipe with a few extra herbs added.  I'm thinking along the lines of curry powders and poultry spice mixes... even though I'm a vegetarian.  I think this could very easily take on the smells and flavours of a Thanksgiving meal.

This was good, though I think the taste of the sunflower seeds was too strong and I will reduce next time to about 2/3 cup. Also  when I thaw out my leftovers from the freezer, I'll give it a couple of splashes of tabasco sauce.

This paté is rich and delicious!! I took the suggestions given by some reviewers and used 4 garlic cloves, soy sauce instead of salt, 1 cup of water and only 5 tablespoon canola oil. I served it w/ homemade whole meal bread and green salad. It's a lot of paté. We are just 2 people and in spite of beeing a lot I had to hide some away so DH would not pig ou and finish everything at once :) This is addictive!

WOW! Do not change anything the first time you make this,Fantastic as is. I have made this over and over and have played with it a tad,more spice, mix of herbs, Black beans makes a great sub for the potato. 
I also can this and has a shelf life of 12 months.

it's really yummy, but I have to add more spice to it, and add ground red pepper to give it a bit more zing for my family.

I couldn't find nutritional yeast so I'm not sure how much this affected the flavour. It wasn't bad, the texture was good, and it ended up tasting like a bizarre version of pot pie! Unfortunately not for me.

My subs: raw pumpkin seeds and raw cashews for the sunflower seeds, sweet for white potato and no lemon juice (out). As others have mentioned, I used my blender. Easy, quick, delicious and vegan! Loved it! I will be making this a lot, I think. It's versatile and could be a great go-to dish. I'm serving it at a holiday party in a couple of weeks.

The sage or some other spice really made me feel like I was eating stuffing which is not positive for me. I loved the texture for spreading on crackers or dipping with. I will make this again with a slight change in the spice mixture. Also thanks to the person that said they used their blender as I don't have a processor. I just made sure to add the veggies and liquid first before the flour etc. Also I used chickpea flour and it worked great.

Good stuff.  Looks ugly, taste great.  Spread on pita or naan and top with veggies.  Easy too.  Might be worth cutting in half or freezing some as it makes quite a bit.  Goes on the keeper list.

I love this recipe. Made a few changes: doubled the spices; instead of oil, I used a 1/4 cup tahini and 1 tsp tamari (soy sauce). I also used 3/4 cup water and 1/2 c veggie broth. I also added 1/2 tsp creole seasoning (Tony Thachery Creole seasoning. Sorry, I put it on everything). It was delicious, but it was even better after 2 days in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this! Couldn't find nutritional yeast.  So, added a little more flour.  I will cut down the amount of water by 1/2 cup to give a thicker consistency.  And depending on the crowd that I'm serving this to, I would add some red pepper flakes & tabasco sauce to give it a little punch!

Good suggestion to reduce water to one cup.  I also used half sunflower seeds and half walnuts.  For a party I would bake just half or a third of the final mixture to serve in a terrine.  Once you flip the pate out of a baking tin, it loses the nice baked brown color.  Very good appetizer for a vegeterian/vegan guest.

This is a great recipe and quite adaptable. I've made it once according to the recipe (delicious!) and twice with leftover veggies I have from making vegetable broth (even better!). I also just made it with leftover veggies from an autumnal stew, which included squash and ginger. It's still really good. The nutritional yeast and sunflower seeds give it a rich, creamy, savory flavor that's delicious.  My friends love it.

I found the spice mix to be a bit unbalanced. The consistency was good though.
