I will make it again, but will decrease the honey mustard 50% and mix in regular mustard or a bit of Dijon. 
The change I made for this batch was to caramelize the onions for 20 minutes on low instead of 10 minutes per the recipe. I didn't want the onions to have any bite in them for this. Maybe that's why the honey mustard was too sweet, but I still would prefer well-caramelized onions to bitey ones in this. Loved the addition of a half tsp Worcestershire in the brushing butter. Was a great, easy mid-afternoon lunch on a lazy, football-watching day.

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and added a scratch honey mustard sauce from this site and everyone said these were the hit of the party even over the wings and my son is a wingnut (in more ways than one :-) )

I loved this recipe!  My husband didn't care for the honey mustard, so next time I will leave it out. I also substituted the ham for turkey because we don't eat pork, and i used provolone cheese because that is what had on hand. I will make this again for sure! Thanks!

I made the original recipe and we loved it  Tonight I had leftover crockpot roast beef (drained of juices) added horseradish to the mustard mix and shredded cheddar.  Love this version, too.  Very versatile and will keep this on the menu more often.  Thanks!

I made 96 of these for a party. I didn't change the ingredients or how they were prepared except that I chopped the onions instead of slicing them. Two hours ahead of the party these were assembled and popped into the oven as the guests began arriving. I used Martins small potato rolls (24 to a package). By keeping the rolls together except to slice each group of 12 in half, assembly was a breeze. After baking, I let them sit for a few minutes then separated the tiny buns with a pizza wheel. They went fast!

07.11.17 ~ Having some ham and Hawaiian rolls to use, this was the perfect combination.  Plus they traveled to the rehab center quite nicely as we visited my dad and took dinner.  I've made sandwiches similar to this in the past, but not with the sautéed onions or the honey mustard.   That is what really made this recipe stand out.  I didn't have shredded Swiss but I did have slices and that is what I used.  My parents, husband and I really enjoyed this recipe and I will be using it again.  Served them with home fried potatoes and a fruit salad.

Substituted Dijon mustard & mayo for the honey mustard dressing. King Hawaiian dinner rolls balanced the spicy Dijon and these sliders were devoured quickly.

I used diller rolls. They fit nicely into a 9 x 13 pyrex.
I put garlic butter on the bottom of the pyrex.
Half the rolls went in next.
Then i stacked it with beef pastrami and honey backed ham dill pickles pepper jack cheese and cheddar cheese salt and pepper. Some mayonaise brown mustard. Mixed and matched as i built them.
Theni put the buns ontop and waited themdown. Pressed themfor 10 minor so...then garlic butter on top and baked them. Were great.

I have made this recipe about 8 times. Today I didn’t have enough Ken’s honey mustard and followed another reviewer and used Dijon. Oh, no. I’m not a honey mustard fan, but now I know why it is imperative in this recipe. Other mustards ruin the flavor balance. I’ll definitely stick to the main recipe from now on!

These were really good.  Next time I would use sliced Swiss cheese--so much easier to deal with without cheese shreds falling out while assembling and then melting on pan.  Other than that I would make no changes to the recipe.  I did cook the onion in a little butter in the microwave.

Very good.  Left the onions off for the kids.  I didn't measure the honey mustard dressing -- just spread a good amount on the bottom and tops of the bread.   Quick and easy.  Very tasty!

These are great for kids if you minus the onions. 
Personally,  I liked the grilled onions, but the honey mustard was too sweet. I will try brown mustard with a touch of honey mixed in fora sweet and spicy taste. 
I would also double the ham and cheese.
