I'm not quite sure what flax seed meal is doing in this recipe, and not having any I just used 1 cup of italian bread crumbs.  To that I added the dried parsley, romano cheese as well as some parmesan, garlic powder, italian seasoning, basil and oregano.  I didn't measure, just eyeballed it and mixed it up.  I used two eggs and thinned that out with a bit of milk.  I didn't bother with the flour either.  I cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces and dipped them into the egg then the bread crumb mixture then back into the egg and back into the bread crumb mixture (double dipping) for a thick coating.  I sprayed a glass baking pan with Pam so nothing would stick and baked it for 35 minutes at 350 turning once during baking.  The chicken was very moist and had a great italian herb flavor.

I really like this recipe.  I didn't use flax seed, and I took the other reviewers suggestion to add a little italian seasoning to the egg mixture.  I also sprinkled lemon juice over the cutlets before baking.  It was wonderful!  I served it over pasta and put red sauce over it, and my husband said it was better than being at an italian restaurant!

I thought this came out a little bland, but was overall good. Bread crumb mixture stuck great. I served with spaghetti and covered the chicken with spaghetti sauce and sprinkled with extra Romano cheese. Reheated well the next night too.  Will make again, but will try adding salt, Italian seasoning, or extra Romano cheese to bread crumb mixture.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The chicken baked up moist and tender.  And the recipe was easy to follow.

I made this recipe as written: it was edible, but really bland. The egg part of the coating was sort of like the underside of chicken skin. The directions seemed fussy for this type of recipe, too. Far simpler to bake uncovered at 425ยบ for 25 minutes. I'll stick to using a very thin coating of low-fat mayo (instead of the egg), and a more seasoned crumb coating recipe. I do appreciate the use of flax seed meal in this recipe, though. I will add flax seed to my usual recipe. Thanks for that :)
