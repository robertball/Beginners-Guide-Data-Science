Make sure you really like vinegar before you make this!  My Easter guests and I found this recipe acceptable, but too heavy on the vinegar.  (Even my sister, who likes vinegar, found it a bit overpowering.)  The bacon was a delicious touch. I doubt I'll make it again, but it was worth trying once.

After reading previous reviews I decided to try this with less vinegar. I cut it back to less than a 1/4 cup and the dish still tasted a little too vinegary. Hubby's not a green bean fan and while he did say the the vinegar was a little too overwhelming he did wind up eating seconds. This was an easy dish to prepare and the overall taste was good. I'll try this again with even less vinegar.

I made this for the holiday and no one really liked it.  The vinegar was too much.  A friend of mine makes this using very little vinegar and she said it tastes much better that way.

My eggs started to curdle too, so I ended up starting all over again. Fortunately I had saved my bacon fat. I'll go back to Sweet and Sour Green Beans on this site.

Not so great.   Too vinegary too--I should have read the other reviews before making this.

I am not a green bean eater, but I made this recipe, and I loved it!  However, my roommates who are green bean lovers HATED this -- the vinegar was way too strong for them.

I was glad I tasted the dressing before I put it on the green beans because the dressing had way too much vinegar. I will not make this again.

Excellent, easy recipe. Because of comments about the vinegar I used 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar,4 Truvio packets and one egg. I heated the sauce on low and whisked it while it thickened. My bacon was already cooked so I chopped it and added it into the onions and cooked on low.

I gave this recipe five stars because my children will eat the beans with no comlaints.  It is also pretty quick and easy.

Delicious!  This recipe was a big hit at my house!  The vinegar was not overwhelming at all.  The only thing that I noticed that I didn't like was the bacon grease, next time I might add a little less.  We enjoyed it, thanks for sharing!

I will never make this again.  as soon as I put the dressing on the green beans the eggs cooked and it was lumpy.  maybe my beans were too hot but I don't like to eat lukewarm green beans just so the sauce will work.
