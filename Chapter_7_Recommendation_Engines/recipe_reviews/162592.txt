I don't like this recipe personally, my family loves it though. We always add a teaspoon or two of McCormick Salad Seasoning, a cup or so of chopped pepperoni, and a couple of chopped up sticks of string cheese.

I really liked this.  I used cherry tomatoes instead of olives because I don't like them and I omitted the red onion.  This was very tasty.

I sauteed the broccoli in a little olive oil because my wife doesn't like it too raw.  That's the only change I made.  She had two helpings.

I gave it four stars because I made mine differently and I don't  know how the actual recipe tasted.
I added Cucumbers (English wrapped in plastic) and celery. I didn't add any tomatoes, but you could throw in some cherry tomatoes if you like.
I omitted the recipes dressings and replaced it with Olive Garden Italian dressing, you can find it in the grocery store or at a Olive Garden restaurant.  I also added some permesian cheese (not the stuff in a can) as a topping once Served (not mixed in with the dressing and verges, but you could.)
I buy my Permian cheese at Gordon's Foods, it's a large bag..but it's worth it.

I added pepperoni slices and used 3 cheese Italian dressing (cutting down on the 1/2cup of parm cheese) and chopped the broccoli into very small pieces with my food chopper.  This came out awesome.  My 1 year old son loved it.

This is a great recipe.  I have also made it with Catalina dressing and it is fantastic!  Make sure you put it in the fridge overnight so the flavors can mesh.
Wonderful!!

I did this recipe for my co-workers but I think next time I will at least blanch the broccoli a little. I think overall it was an ok recipe.

This was excellent! I did not use a red pepper, because I am not a big pepper fan. But in it's place I used little baby carrots. I also used tri-color rotini pasta. You could also use tri-color tortellini. This is a big family favorite and party favorite. I highly recommend this recipe.
