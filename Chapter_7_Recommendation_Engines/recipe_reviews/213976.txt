Very good treats. They set quickly and perfectly however i did use a bag of miniature marshmallows instead but i dont think that matters any. My only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 was because there should be a note to only use frosting. I used the decorating gel and went through the whole tube on 4 squares. The kids loved them though
