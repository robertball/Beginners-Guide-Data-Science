Loved this!  True to it's name...EASY!  Only changes:  Used 3 Granny Smith apples & added a few drops of lemon juice, 1/2C of pecans (no raisins) and sugared the pastry before adding the apples.  Brushed pastry after it was rolled with melted butter and then sugar. Seems like a lot of sugar but the apples I used were pretty tart and needed it.  (And we aren't hugh sweet eaters.) Mine have cooked in about 12-15 min...maybe it's just my oven, but I would watch to make sure not to burn bottoms.  VERY, VERY GOOD & EASY.

This recipe was nice and easy, which was key for me because I had to bake 40 of them for an Oktoberfest.  I added some cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg to the apples and sugar, and sifted some powdered sugar on top for a very professional looking presentation.

Excellent recipe and very easy. I added just a dash of cinnamon to the filling. Will definitely make this again. Thanks Jess.

We like to make this for an apple dessert that's a ton quicker than apple pie. Really easy! However, I prefer to cook the apple filling in a saute pan on top of the stove till slightly softened before putting in the pastry to end up with a more done result without overbrowning the pastry. And definitely add some cinnamon to the filling!

I used layers of phyllo dough instead of puff pastry (with melted butter and sprinkled sugar between each of 3 layers) and dried cranberries instead of raisins, as well as adding a little cinnamon, but the basic recipe is a good one.  Be sure your filling isn't too wet.  I also brushed the top with butter, instead of egg.  This actually made two strudels for me, but still only served 6.

Very EZ to put together and lots of compliments. Guests said "Better than apple pie!"  Served warm with vanilla ice cream. Only used 1/3 cup sugar (subbed a couple delicious apples in place of granny smith) and added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a little melted butter. Only used 1/4 cup regular raisins. Can't imagine using a full cup of sugar AND that many raisins - would've been way too sweet. Also didn't want to waste an egg for the wash so I just sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar on top after baking. Made a few slashes on top to vent before baking and covered my cookie sheet with no-stick foil. Will make again for sure.

This was a great addition to the mini-Oktoberfest we had for some neighbors - bratwurst, German potato salad, beer, and apple strudel.  What's not to like?!!!  Here is how I modified the recipe for our taste:  3 apples, 1/2C raisins, 2/3C brown sugar, 1t cinnamon, 2T Minute Tapioca.  I used the puff pastry, egg, and 1/4C milk as listed, but added sliced almonds on top as others suggested.  I also took the suggestion of cooking the apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, and tapioca in a sauce pan for 15 minutes on medium heat.  Baking time was only 25 minutes in the oven. Three apples makes enough for 2 strudels.  When they came out of the oven and cooled a little, I sprinkled them with powdered sugar.  Simply delicious for dessert or breakfast.  I received many compliments.

ok, but the juice content was so high that the crust was not flaky but clumped on the bottom and carmalized.  Must eat hot and not great after cooled.

Agreed with the other reviewers and added cinnamon and a combo of pears and apples. Perhaps it was the juicy (courtland) apples I used, but I would suggest not putting in the extra juice, so that the strudel doesn't leak as much. Thanks for the recipe! A quick and easy apple dessert for the Fall!!

Excellent recipe.  I used Granny Smith apples, golden raisins.  Imagine that it might be sweet if one used another variety of apple.....  My only advice/tip would be to flip the freshly 'wrapped' streudel over so the doubled dough forms the bottom and the single layer becomes the top.  I made vent slices in the top and sprinkled with coarse sugar.

Thanks, Jess - this was very easy to make - and so good!  I made it (with a couple of modifications) for an Oktoberfest dinner we hosted.  I left out the raisins and drizzled honey over the top of the apples before sealing up the pastry.  We served it warm with ice cream.  It was awesome!

After reading other reviews I made the following changes: cooked apples before placing them on the dough.  Added only 1/3 cup of sugar - and it was plenty sweet for us.  Added some cinnamon and sprinkled some almonds on the top. Cooking time was 20min.

Very simple and easy recipe.  I did change up the recipe a little. Like most reviewers I added a tsp of cinnamom, and used 5 small apples.  I reduced sugar to 6 tbsp, and 1 tsp of lemon juice to keep the apples from browning and added a small handful of walnut pieces just before adding to the puff pastery.  I let the apples, sugar and lemon juice sit for about 2 hours and then added 1 1/2 tbsp of flour to soak up the juices from the bottom of the bowl.  Very yummy my husband couldn't wait to get into it and once he did I had a hard time from keeping him from going for seconds.

USE 2-3 TABLESPOONS OF FLOUR in the apple/sugar mixture.  It will make the juice inside the strudel thicker.  Make sure to coat all the apples and raisins with the flour.  VERY GOOD otherwise, great taste!!

10 stars for easy, 3 stars for taste. Easy to make but strongly agree w/other reviews--you must add cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. or the taste will be bland. After living in Germany for a spell, I missed the substantive, rich apple filling. I forgot to do it this time, but next time I will add vanilla flavoring.  I also missed the buttery taste. I could have infused it by adding a little flour to my butter/sugar sauce in my sauteed apple mixture to thicken it up. (To avoid excessive juice, I strained my sauteed the mixture of apples, raisins, chopped apricots (b/c I didn't have enough raisins) in a 1/2 tsp of butter & the sugar... I really didn't need the butter b/c the juice from the apples developed.)  I don't like Granny Smiths but they are perfect for this recipe. I folded dough to overlap. Overall, VERY easy to make. I used confectioner's sugar instead of almonds to dress it up & added a few chopped walnuts to the apple filling. I'd make it again but add vanilla flavoring & season the dough more. Give it a try!

I loved this!  Actually, my whole family loved this.  I had two hours to make a dessert...it was so easy...and tasted wonderful.  I soaked the raisins in hot water and vanilla...and, I also added chopped walnuts, lemon juice, and lemon peel...since my apples were not intensely tart.  But, I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar...and 1/2 of shortbread cookie crumbs.  This did require both sheets of puff pastry, with the stuffing between...and the sliced top layer allowed all the steam out, and kept the dough flaky and crisp.  I sprayed the top with a butter spray...perfect color...but it did take 40 minutes to bake at 350 degrees.

This is easy and absolutely delicious!  One of the things I really loved is that since you cook the apples before placing in the pastry, you don't get that mile high pastry empty hole effect!  The pastry is full of tasty apples and cinnamon.  We just loved this.

This is so good! The only problem is that there's enough of the apple mixture to make two strudels. So plan to make half of the apple mixture or to get to sheets of puff pastry. DE-LISH!!!

My first attempt at strudel and will do again.  Added 3/4 tsp of cinnamon. Mine was stuck to the bottom of the pan (glass pan lined with foil).  next time I will assemble and pop it in the oven while the dough is still cold.  I would cut back on the sugar...maybe to 3/4 cup.  I also had a lot of liquid.  Maybe 2 tbsp of flour tossed in the apple mix is needed (like pie filling).

The base recipe is a good idea but it needs tweaking.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, vanilla extract, and walnuts.  I also used phyllo dough sheets instead of puff pastry (personal preference), but I imagine it would also taste delicious with puff pastry.  I drizzled slices of strudel with maple syrup as a final touch.  Took this to a party and I got rave reviews, so will make again.

Thank you so much for this dleicious and EASY recipe! And thanks, also, to all who reviewed and gave such great suggestions!
Per other reviewers, I planned ahead of time to make two, which was great as that's how many puff pastries come in a PF box. :)
I also used half the brown sugar and added 1 t. vietnamese cinnamon, 2 T instant tapioca, and 1 t. good vanilla to the apples. The cinnamon is pretty strong and I didn't want to overdo it, but next time I'll add 1 1/2 t, maybe even two!

I met the two halves of pastry dough in the middle (on top) and it worked out really well. I recommend doing it that way. With the tapioca I had no leakage at all. My apples were getting a bit soft, so I didn't pre-cook them, but it came out perfectly. Oh- and I forgot some were supposed to be grated, but it made no difference as far as I know. 
I did cut 3 or 4 slits in the top to vent.
I also topped it with cinnamon and sugar, which I won't try next time as the high heat of the oven burned the sugar a bit. Totally my fault.

I can see gow a glaze would be delish on thses. 
I will make these again and again- so glad you posted this recipe!

I'm not much of a baker (especially pies and other things that use a crust) but I loved this recipe.  I used puff pastry for the first time and found it very forgiving.  I added a little cinnamon and three pats of butter on the top of the apple mixture.  It was delicious!

I have done this recipe a few times and always with good results, I change nothing about the recipe.
I did have some left over filling, so I think it depends on the size of your apples. I used my own puff pastry and next time will either use larger sheet or less apples and raisins to accommodate the puff pastry sheet.

Oh my gosh, this apple strudel is AWESOME! I was craving apple strudel the other day and always thought making it was complicated, so I searched for "easy apple strudel." :-) This was ridiculously easy (I even did it while my 1-year-old was still awake, which is a slight miracle) and I loved how it turned out so much I made it again last night! I actually was able to split up the filling and put it in two puff pastries because there was so much. I used half a cup brown sugar, which was plenty, and used Pepperidge Farms puff pastries. SO GOOD.

Too many raisins (and I like raisins).  Came out too flat.  For the amount of apples one pastry sheet was not enough.  Flavorwise... plain.  I will suggest to make cuts on top so the apple juice will not pop out of the pastry. Will look for another recipe.

This is a great starter recipe but needs a little tweaking (in my opinion). Basically, this is apple pie with a different crust. So... I added 2 teaspoons of cornstarch to my apple filling (helps absorb the excess juice that will ruin your crust otherwise). I also added 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/8 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg. I reduced the amount of raisins to 1/2 cup since I think they should complement, not overtake the dessert and soaked them in rum 30 minutes prior to adding to the apples (discard or drink the rum - if you don't have rum, apple juice or even plain water will do but won't be as good as rum soaked).  I put all of the filling ingredients, along with 1 tablespoon of butter, into a saucepan and sauted the filling for about 10 minutes over medium-low heat. Then, instead of sealing the filling in the crust, I spooned it down the middle, cut the crust on either side into strips and criss-crossed them over the filling. I used a light egg wash and sprinkled with coarse sugar before baking. Now we have what I find to be a five star apple strudel!

Delicious!
Served (w/van. ice cream) as part of an entire German themed meal to my book club and they raved.  Wished I would have rolled the strudel over before cooking so that the crease would have been on the bottom (would have looked better) added toasted walnuts & pecans which gave the filling an added crunch. Filling was enough for two-which works out great since a box of puff pastry has 2 sheets.  Once you've opened the box you might as well use both- I've tried freezing 1/2 used boxes...not so great.

Spiked it with a tablespoon of whiskey, omitted the raisins and used a handful of fresh blueberries instead. Also, I omitted the egg/milk wash. Fabulous!

I made this w/my son for a project he did on Austria to take in to his class (and one to have at home).  It was delicious!  We each made our own bowl.  He made his w/less raisins because the kids at school don't like them but I followed the recipe.  I have to admit, although I adore raisins, the recipe calls for too many and it was actually better w/fewer.  I'll use less next time.  Also, we did add a little cinnamon per others suggestions.  I think this recipe needs it.  W/those two changes I rated it 5 stars.  It was easy and delicious!

Good and easy. I was out of raisins so 
I used chopped prunes. I overcooked it a little, but the hubby still liked it.

when you add sugar to fruit, after a short time it releases its juices. I would have suggested a change in order: preheat oven, prepare apples, roll dough, make egg/milk wash, add sugar to apples, add apples to dough, secure the dough and pinch it closed then egg wash it and pop in oven.

I must have used larger apples because I had enough apple/sugar/raisin mix for second sheet of pastry.

My cooking time was half which is consistent with suggested cooking time on the puff pastry box.

I had a lot of problems with this. The apples "leaked" so much water that it leaked off the parchment to the pan and started burning. The time in the oven at that heat was so  high for the pastry. How did everyone else not burn theirs? Any suggestions?

I really enjoyed this recipe. My husband loved it! It was the kind of recipe that was perfect, not too difficult or complicated. Simple wholesome ingredients, and when finished it looked beautiful.  It's the kind of recipe I could take to potlucks or make for special occasions and no one would know it was so easy. I added a couple ingredients to it to give it more flavor. I added a tsp of real vanilla extract and a medium dash of cinnamon, and a couple squirts of lemon juice to the apple mixture. I also omitted the raisins and used fuji apples instead to give it more natural sweetness so I could use only 3/4 cup of sugar. Also I listened to another rating who brushed melted butter on the pastry after rolling it out. And sprinkled sliced almonds and raw sugar on the top before baking. Overall awsome recipe, and I'll definitely make it again!

I really liked this recipe, except I think my homegrown Granny Smith apples were a little sweeter than the ones the recipe creator used.  I cut the sugar down with the second one I made.  I also added a little flour because they were really juicy.  Co-workers ate it up.

This was totally easy and turned out great.  For some reason my apples were really runny.  Sugary apple juice ran out of the tart and all over the baking sheet.  The pastry held up and didn't go soggy.  This tasted really good with vanilla ice cream.

Excellent recipe and very easy to make! For richer flavour use demerara sugar for the apple mixture and add a splash of dark rum to the apple mixture as well.

Did not find this easy to make at all.  I bake and follow recipes with ease.  I found there was too much filling for the pastry - eventhough I rolled it larger than it came.  Used Pepperidge Farm pastry sheets - maybe the wrong brand.  This was for a school project for my son- luckily he gets graded on the effort - not the final product.

This was a tasty recipe, but not real easy to work with....at least not easy to keep it looking nice, neat and pretty.  Be very careful not to "overfill" if you are concerned about how it will look.  Still tasty though.

First time I made this. Had lots of Granny Smiths to use up so made two. Dough a little frozen still but able to faltten enough. Used Stevia in place of sugar. No raisins, no nuts and allspice 1/2 tsp. Put in about 2 large apples on each sliced thinly. Used some of the egg mixture to seal the center fold and ends as well as brushing the tops. Forgot to slit the tops. Still they came out great at 375 for 40 minutes. Quite brown on top. Sprinke powdered sugar and served w/ fresh cream whipped cream. Trial run for hilodays. Not a cinnamon lover but may add a loittle next time.

The only recommendation is, only use Granny Smith and other apples will make the bottom of the dough soggy. Great recipe, I have used it many times...the strudel will not last in the house for more than a day, I have to hide it to get a piece myself :) My family loves the strudel...Thanks

Very easy, very yummy. Set the smoke alarm off twice though when the liquid spilled out and caramelised then starting smoking on the tray. Note to self: seal the ends next time.

Yum, yum!  I used two phyllo sheets instead and made one serving using one thinly sliced and peeled pink lady apple, a little brown sugar, little turbinado sugar, a dash of cinnamon and about 5 crumbled pecans.  I cooked it for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees and it was perfect!

it's in the oven and looks very nice.  No oozing.  To seal the puff only wet one side.  I folded mine so the the puff did not overlap.  They met in the center on top of the filling.  Seal the edges with just water, pinch the seam across the top, run a knife and create equal slashes across the sealed pastry.  I also pre cooked the apples in a skillet with just an 1/8 cup of water and a teaspoon of tapioca.  You can also use corn starch or flour in place of the tapioca.

This was definitely easy, once the apples were peeled and sliced.  However, it seems that most of the sweet juice ran out of the pockets, leaving the remaining strudel to be kind of dry and pasty.  Maybe I didn't seal up the pastry well enough?  It was definitely better warm and fresh vs leftover.  I don't know if I'll try this one again.

Excellent, basic recipe. i did make a bunch of changes after reading reviews. i cut 3 small apples and 2 nectarines. sliced them all in a bowl with sugar. (whole amount) a cinimon stick. pinch of nutmag and all spice. i let it sit in the bowl after mixing for about 3 hours. all the juice ran to the bottom. i then emptied the juice into another bowl. mix up fruit with a little bit of juice and some flour. This makes the recipe not so runny. i brushed it with milk and poked some holes on the top. made  2 strudel.

this was easy as anything!  I was a bit worried when the brown sugar just disolved & turned juicy in the apples & then oozed out the strudel but it went quite caramely in the oven & tasted good stuck to the bottom of the pastry.  Tasted great & just as good cold the next day!

I modified this quite a bit and it still turned out great!  I left out the raisins (my kids don't like them) and used 4 Honeycrisp apples, all sliced.  I used only about a tablespoon of brown sugar and added some cinnamon. It ended up being too many apples, so I left out about a cup and a half and just baked those separately.  So easy and delicious!

I was skeptical at the beginning because there was no thickener for the apples (and they produce a lot of juice).  Filling ran out of pastry and all over oven.  This also caused pastry to be soggy.

Used cinnamon and nutmeg like other reviewers, omitted the raisins. Next time I would drain the moisture off the apples before filling the puff pastry and line the baking sheet with  aluminum foil (in addition to using parchment paper) for easy clean up.

mine came out great. the only thing i changed was that i put a cup of chopped walnuts instead of the raisins but that's just a preference... also I made two and still had enough filling to make a third. this calls for wayyy too many apples. you'd do fine with two.

This was wonderful! Quick and easy. I made this for dessert after a traditional German holiday meal of roast goose and red cabbage. My husband loved it. The only thing I added was an icing of powdered sugar mixed with a little water before serving.  Yum!!

I've made this twice so far and both times it leaked like crazy while baking. Not sure if its the apples I'm using (cortlands) or what. 

The first time I followed the recipe mostly (did not add raisins or nuts and cut the sugar to 2/3 cup instead of 1 cup).  It was tasty.

My more recent attempt, I used three little and one large apple and fresh raspberries. I squeezed in a quarter wedge of a large lemon and added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. I also added a tablespoon of flour, hoping it wouldn't leak soo much while baking but it didn't help. Very tasty though.

I made it.  The only thing I might change next time is not to grate the one apple.  In the 30 minutes, it took to cook the juice dribbled out somewhere and burned in the baking sheet making it difficult to clean and getting the burned brown sugar and getting on the strudel making it burnt in spots too.  This was otherwise a great cake.  I added an icing drizzle of 1 cup organic powdered sugar, 1 tbsp of orange extract, and 2 tbsp of water.   I also used black instead of white raisins and they were good as well.

I added mixed berries,  nutmeg,  and cloves.  Also two tablespoons of flour to the apple filling and let it sit while the dough thawed.  When adding it to the dough I carefully drained it of the juices that seeped to the bottom.  I also didn't shred one this kept the runny fluids at bay for the most part.  It kept its height and to cut I recommend your knife for angel food cake. I use cutco so I had no issue cutting.

It is easy to make and looks gorgeous.  I found the brown sugar and raisins took away from flavor of apples, so substituted half brown and half white sugar.  Also you can use less with sweeter apples.  I would cut the raisins by at least half.

I'd say that when making this it might well be easier to start more on one side of the pastry dough and then roll it over, and as you do so, add another layer of the filling, because otherwise, it ends up being too much pastry and not enough filling. Additionally, adding bread crumbs in before cooking would be a good idea because the apples let out juice as they cook, and it gets on the pan and can burn during cooking, and then that can ruin the flavor. Also, I did two of these with one box of Pepperidge farms puff pastry, and it didn't use more than 3 Granny smith apples total.

Great basic recipe. I gave it 4 stars because it really needs the addition of cinnamon and flour as other reviewers recommended. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp flour to the sugar. Turned out perfect! Sealed well, there was no juice run off at all. I served it with whipped cream. Kids loved it. Simple, quick and delicious! Will make again.

Made this for dessert on Christmas and the family loved it!  We   made 2 smaller pastries instead of one big one and added walnuts to the filling.  Quick, easy & delicious!

By the time the apples were cooked enough, the other juices ran out and burned on the bottom and the pastry was overdone.  I would cook the apple mixture a little first and then fill and bake.

totally awesome, but when I made it I used 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 cup raisins and a flaky pastry and it turned out great. Just a note: use aluminum foil or wax/parchment paper so cleaning is a bit easier.

Forget any advice on telling you to cook the apples first.  The heat of the cooked apples made the sugar syrupy and made a huge goopy mess as it started to pour out all over my oven.  Even when I sealed the dough it still crept out.  Not sure my rating is fair but that ones  for my dirty oven.

This was yummy but too sweet for me and waaay too much filling. I will do the following next time - cut apples in half, cut raisins to 1/4c (or even less), add 1/2 c pecans, cut sugar to 1/3c, add cinnamon. I, too, omitted the egg and milk and just put a few pats of butter on top.

So delish! I made the apple filling 2 days before my moms 85th bday party and refridgerated it. I think this cut down on the extra liquid reviewers were talking about and it minimized the sticking and burning of the cookie sheet. I did add raisins, a pinch of nutmeg, a pinch of cinnamon and some lemon juice and cooked it on low for about an hour. All we  had to do on the day of the party was put the filling in the dough, roll it up like a swiss roll, stretch it to each end of the pan and pinch the ends TIGHT. We didn't vent it because the pastry sheet ended so we put that on the upside, brushed it with melted butter and had literally no spillage or sticking.  There were 2 pastry sheets in the pkg and since we had extra filling left over, we made two. They were kind of short and stubby so we stretched them to each end of the pan. At 400 degrees, instead of taking 40 minutes, they were golden brown around 33 minutes so I turned off the oven and let them sit a few more minutes before removing and didn't cut them until they cooled down so each piece came out perfect. We cut about 20 pieces and everyone loved it. My mom is 100% German and she couldn't believe how easy the pastry sheets were to work with and she was even more surprised that it tasted like authentic Streudel. I forgot to sprinkle powedered sugar on it but it was beautiful anyway!  Will definitely make this again and againg and again. Enjoy y'all!

It was good but not great. I needed something quick to put in the oven and this was it. Simple, so simple you can basically put anything in it that you have on hand. As long as you follow the basic principle of baking time and ratios. I would of preferred apple and cheese over apple and raisins. Kids liked it, they were real happy about how fast they had an unplanned dessert.

This recipe is certainly quick, easy, and popular with my family. Like others I found adding a couple of tbsp of flour cut back dramatically on the juice from the apples...also added some cinnamon and apple spice. This is really delicious with dried cranberries.

I am English so I used Bramley cooking apples with a sprinkling of sugar and cinamon as they are sharp. They are also more juicy and produced more liquid, but it turned out fine. The bottom of the pastry sort of caramalised. YUM!

A bit messy, but worth it. Adding a little cinnamon also gives the recipie a little spice to counter the sweetness of the brown sugar.
