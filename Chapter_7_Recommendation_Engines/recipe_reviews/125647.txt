I'll admit that I changed things here cuz I needed something with less far fat.  I really appreciated the starting point, though and hope to make it as the recipe states at another point.  That said, it was a big hit.  I actually just used 2% milk instead of cream.  I also didn't wait 8 hours--only about 3.  The consistency was like Jello.  It was a nice light flavor.  Also didn't have brandy so just used the berries and sugar.  My fussy, fussy eaters were full of compliments and the dieters were delighted to know they weren't doing too much damage to the diet.  Thanks.  I'm looking forward to trying it again both your way and mine!

great reciepe for bulk. I did a 200 person party and used it. Just make sure to freeze it in rubber molds if you are not serving it in a dish.

great recipe, most recipes for panna cotta use sheet gelatine and it is not so easy to find as powdered. I'm not a fan of frozen berries and fresh are not available so I served it with rhubarb and strawberry compote. ( strawberries available all year in Australia)

Wonderful recipe! Perfect consistency and not too sweet. I used half and half cream, plus a bit of vanilla and rum extract instead of infusing w vanilla bean. Also omitted the sauce. Delicious, light and creamy..

I was pleasantly surprised by how easy this was to make.  It certainly tastes delicious.  I am making it again tonight for guests.   I infused the cream with lavender while it cooked and sliced fresh berries very finely instead of squishing them.  A lovely spring dessert.

I use 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (instead of bean), 3 cups Half and Half (instead of cream), and Carmel (instead of berry sauce).  Always satisfies.

Super easy. Very good. Next time I will probably reduce the fat by using half and half. I added vanilla extract because I didn't have vanilla beans. Great!

Made this today & I must say it is fantastic. I had tried so many berry sauces before which were harder to make than this & not even as good.  This is absolutely wonderful & tastes just like what they serve in Italia  & so easy to make.  

Military Cook, THANK YOU so much for sharing your recipe.

Perfect. Simple and satisfying, it's a dessert that looks more sophisticated than it really is.

Wow! Easy and awesome, rich and decadent! I had to use vanilla extract but no worries there- it was still so good. I made a simple berry sauce using fresh black raspberries and blueberries. Thanks for sharing!

My family absolutely loved this dessert. My son ate it without the berry sauce since and he found it so creamy. I will definately be making this again.

Very smooth and oh so delicious!   We each had seconds as I put them in smaller molds.   So easy and quick to make. Never changed a thing.
