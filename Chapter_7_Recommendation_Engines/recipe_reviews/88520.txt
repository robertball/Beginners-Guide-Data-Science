My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe.  It was a nice change to broccoli with cheese sauce.  I used two crowns of fresh broccoli that I steamed.  While it cooked I melted 1/4 cup of light butter (it has a large water content anyway so I figured it evened out.  I then juiced one lemon, added a little cayenne, salt, pepper and garlic.  I let this simmer until the water was gone from the butter.  I poured this over the broccoli and sprinkled with about a tablespoon of parmesean cheese.  The broccoli has a very light lemon taste and was perfect.  I will remember this and make again in the future.

My husband, 17  year old son and I liked this- and we're not big broccoli eaters. I used fresh broccoli, steamed it until just done, and then poured on the sauce, stirred, and let it sit for a few minutes. I did not use the full 1/4 tsp cayenne, and I added garlic salt.

Using frozen broccoli, I ended up with a very soggy, limp vegetable. Maybe it would have been better with fresh.

I didn't use cayanne pepper, instead I used lemon pepper. I cooked both carrots and fresh broccoli. It was very zesty and good.

Simple and excellent.  I had a large lemon, so only used half of its juice - which was a good decision.  It was a perfect balance of flavors.  A new favorite (except with my 8 y.o. daughter who likes broccoli plain).

This was pretty good.  I, too, used fresh broccoli, steamed it and poured the juice over the broccoli.  It still needs a little bit something, but I don't know what that is.  Maybe I just didn't use enough salt.  I can't help thinking a creamy lemon sauce would be good, but I don't know how to make one.

Not over the top, extraordinarily delicious and unique, but good, especially if you don’t go crazy with the lemon juice.  A respectable squeeze is all you need.  Omitting the cayenne pepper for Hubs did not hurt at all – in fact I, too, preferred it without .  For Hubs and me, Lawry’s Seasoned Salt (and fresh broccoli spears) was all this needed.

Very good - took the advice from other reviews and used fresh broccoli which I steamed for about 4 minutes;  made the sauce in a small saucepan and poured over top.  I also, on the advice of a previous reviewer, used about a tbsp of RealLemon Juice in lieu of a fresh lemon.  My husband poured the leftover sauce over his rice as well - it's a great, versatile sauce that can be used for almost any veggie!

What a nice sauce! The flavors went so well together.  I took the advice of others and steamed my fresh broccoli for just a few minutes till bright green. I used a fresh lemon and organic unsalted butter, coarse salt, fresh ground pepper and just two dashes of cayenne pepper (less than 1/8) as this spice can pack a lot of kick.  I had some extra minced garlic so I added just a touch of it to the lemon butter mixture.  It was right on.  I poured the sauce over the broccoli. I will definitely make this sauce again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious but the water was unnecessary & prevented the butter from coating the broccoli well. It was pretty spicy too, so the cayenne pepper should be reduced to taste. That said, it was delicious & a big hit at the potluck where I brought it.

I really liked this recipe. I used fresh broccoli and I think that probably makes a difference. I enjoyed the tartness of the lemon in the sauce. The sauce really isn't a sauce - more like a flavored bath. I will be making this one again.

It has been some time since I consumed this sauce (over the Salmon, Rice and Fried tomatoes recipe, which was Yummy!) so I cannot recall specifically what we did not like about it but neither my wife nor I cared for it at all.   Usually if a recipe sounds good I can tweak it to my liking if it's not quite what I had hoped but with this one I doubt I will bother.

Very good. My husband and I do not like broccoli and in a spirit of aiming to eat our five veg a day, we each got a good amount down thanks to this recipe! Not recommended for kids though (too bitter) and I would cut down on the lemon a bit next time or try lime.

It wasn't bad, but we didn't care much for it either.  The kids wouldn't touch it because it was too spicy, and they normally like brocolli and tolderate spicy stuff.

Amazing. I used fresh broccoli and I didn't use the water. I thought it had enough liquid with the butter and lemon juice. Broccoli and lemon are a match made in heaven!

Was a little watery. Will steam the broccoli, rather than boil, next time. Also reduce water a little in the sauce and determine if it needs a thickener such as for flour/starch.

I loved this recipe!! Finally a great way to use frozen broccoli that was easy and fast. Next time i will try and substitute the butter for olive oil. Thanks for the recipe!

I enjoyed the cayenne pepper, but the lemon was a little over powering. A little too sour, like some others said. It probably depends on how much juice  you get out of the lemon. Mine was extremely juicy. Might try it again with less lemon juice.

I wanted something a little different for a nicer dinner of filet mignon and potatoes with caramelized onions. This was PERFECT! The butter, of course, made the broccoli so savory and the little bit of cayenne gave it just the best flavor. Not spicy at all. I will definitely be making this again with no changes.

I served this hot, and it was the best broccoli I have ever had. I think I somehow divided by zero and got an eight year old to eat it. I hope others can understand that.

I wasn't a big fan on this recipe. Although I will say I didn't have any lemons, so I used lemon juice, but I used a little and the suggested amount of water. It was pretty sour, but it did give a variation from usual broccoli toppings. Probably won't try it again though.

I followed this recipe exactly as indicated except used fresh broccoli and a little garlic.  I liked it but the lemon taste was a little too overpowering.  It tasted great, but I felt like I only wanted to taste it a few times before it was too much.  I will keep this recipe and definitely make it again but I will use the juice of 1/2 a lemon as opposed to a whole.

a lovely but not to over powering way to dress up broccoli.  We all loved it and there was not any left overs of our veggies with this meal.  Our 2 year old had thirds and our five year old had fourths..  5 stars from everyone in this house.

At first, my broccoli looked fine but unfortunately, over the course of just a few minutes, the sauce turned my broccoli a nasty shade of brown. It tasted just okay to me. My kids tried it but didn't care for it at all. Appearance is a big part of a dish's overall appeal and success. I wish I knew what I could have done differently to prevent the "browning" of my veggies.

OMG! This is too good!!  I actually had to give a four year old a second helping!!  Absolutely use FRESH broccoli.  And, I just used "ReaLemon" juice - probably about a TBS.  I didn't cover it while cooking.  TRY THIS ONE TONIGHT! It's AWESOME!

After reading some of the reviews, I cut the amount of lemon juice down to a tablespoon.  Like other reviewers I found it sort of bland so I added a couple shakes of garlic powder and some salt after tasting it halfway through cooking.  I think the garlic really helps unite the taste of the broccoli and lemon.

Not very good.  Too much lemon juice. Odd blend of flavors. Will try with 1/4 to 1/2 lemon next time.

Was looking for someting like the butter/spices used at longhorn steakhouse. The quest continues.

I've made this dish before with the cayenne pepper and this time without.  Honestly, I prefer the dish without the cayenne.  I don't cook the broccoli for the full 10/15 minutes at the end because I like broccoli al dente.  All hail the crunch!  Great side dish.

It wasn't as thick as I wanted it. I ended up skipping the water and adding a tablespoon of flour to the butter and lemon and then adding almond milk ( I imagine regular milk would work as well) We like a lot of lemon flavor and since my lemon was quite small I ended up adding some lemon pepper to it as well.  The milk took away the sour taste  of the lemon and made the sauce nice and creamy like I wanted.

I made this dish for a dinner with a few of my girlfriends.  I bought a  big bag of fresh broccoli florets to use.  I started by melting 1.5 sticks of butter and sautéing some minced garlic.  I think squeezed a lemon into the butter.  I added some fresh ground pepper and sea salt.  I then added the broccoli.  I noticed that the lemon started to turn the broccoli a brown color rather quickly.  My friend's really enjoyed the flavor though....I think next time I may steam the broccoli and cook the sauce separately, then pour the sauce over the broccoli and toss right before serving, so it doesn't turn so brown.

You gotta use fresh broccoli when a butter mixture is coating a vegetable. I blanched the broccoli and then stirred in the hot butter mixture when I was ready to serve. The butter and lemon did come through in taste. It was a good a quick dish to make.

Made it as posted, would be good on most any veggie, in my case, I used this on Baby Carrots this time and it was great. Will definitely do with broccoli also, and I bet would be lovely on fresh spinach!!!! Uses are endless, thanks for sharing.

No changes. The secret is: Have the water going to a rolling boil, add broccoli  turn off heat ,cover  and let it sit for 15 min.

My family loved this.  I used fresh broccoli and steamed it, leaving it still crisp.   Then added the broccoli to the melted lemon butter sauce and stirred until the broccoli was warm and coated, about  2 minutes.  Wonderful

I made this tonight and used the broccoli from my garden.  I did not steam it first at all.  All I ate for dinner was this and a tomato from my garden. This was absolutely amazing!! I posted that on Facebook and will make this many more times for sure!! Thank you for the great recipe!!

I've been on a diet and am getting really sick of plain veggies so decided to give this a try. I cut back to just one tablespoon of butter. It was ok and I'll probably make it again, but I might add some garlic or onion next time. It was the minimal ingredients that attracted me to this recipe. UPDATE: I really don't remember making this before but just had it again tonight (using 1/4 cup of butter) and it was good. I don't think I can give more than 3 stars because broccoli is not my favorite. Maybe it's it's smothered in cheese? But that's a different recipe.

I used a frozen veggie mix with broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots.  I cooked the veggies first, then poured the sauce over afterwards.  The sauce made about 1/2 to 3/4 c. and it was way more sauce than was necessary for the amount of veggies I used.  I could have used around 8 c. of veggies.  But it was delicious and I'll certainly serve this again.  It's great with pasta and tomato-based meat sauce.  The lemon juice makes this extremely acidic, so maybe the juice of half a lemon would be better.

instead of using water try for the lemon butter sauce, use heavy whipping cream.  reduce it down and then kill heat when adding butter slowly. then add lemon and return to heat for broccoli.

Had this for dinner this evening.  What a nice change from plain cooked broccoli.  This is a keeper and I will be making it again and again.  Thanks for this recipe.  Only thing I did different was used three tbs. of Real Lemon juice as I did not have any fresh lemons on hand.

Didn't care for this AT ALL!!  Made EXACTLY per recipe.  We found the flavor way TOO lemon-y & too spicy (apparently, too much cayenne for amount of broccoli).  Also, the broccoli discolored with the "sauce" to a very unappetizing "dull green/yellow-ish" color!    Maybe I'm just mad at myself! I violated one of own personal rules: never try out a new recipe on company -- and unfortunately, none of us found this enjoyable.  Sorry, but definately NOT for us!

I've made this broccoli several times now. It's good but definitely use only half of the amount of lemon juice this calls for otherwise it's just too lemony.

I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much liquid if you use frozen broccoli.  Also, I think the cook time is too much for frozen broccoli.  My broccoli gradually lost it's green color the longer it cooked.  Really, frozen veggies only need to be cooked until they're hot, and that only takes a few minutes.  This recipe probably works much better with fresh broccoli, in lieu of the recipe-stated frozen.  That said, I LOVED the flavor, but I'm a lemon nut.  My boyfriend didn't particularly care for it; he said the lemon overpowered the flavor of the broccoli.  You might want to watch how much lemon juice you add.  Also, I don't see any point in adding the butter.  You couldn't taste it, and with all that water, it wasn't like the broccoli was going to stick to the pan or anything.  Save the calories and forget it.

I thought this was fantastic!  It was lemony and a little spicy.  I served it with wild rice.  I think I will try adding cauliflower to it next time just to experiment.

I made it as is and put a few drops of sesame seed oil to accompany the asian salmon that also uses seseme seed oil.  My husband said it was his favorite way to eat broccoli.  My 11 yr old twins who don't eat broccoli, ate it too.  We will make it again.

So good! It was a bit tangy but my husband and I like it that way. Also added some garlic.  I was afraid the frozen broccoli would be soggy, but it was all I had and it was still good.  I will definitely use fresh next time, though.

awesome!  few changes...I steamed broccoli and made the butter sauce in a pan.  I minced one clove of garlic and I served the butter on the side so people could put as much on as they wanted.  It was so delicious!

My man loved this soooo much and insisted I give it 5.  If it was me....  I dont really want to say.  Im glad he likes it though!  We both agreed this would accompany a seafood dish nicely.  OK, let me just warn you this is going to taste just like the ingredients: Sour and Spicey.  I didnt taste the broccoli much and I used the fresh stuff too....  Secondly the cooking method is not likely to impress anyone.  So Im going to suggest that if the comination sounds appealing then you should try steaming your broccoli as you normally would, then cut the sauce of the recipe by half or so, and combine it to the steamed stuff.  That makes more sense to me.....

I take fresh broccoli, steam it in the microwave for 3 minutes and let sit in the m'wave after for about 3 minutes. Then I add 1 tbsp real butter, sea salt and 1-2 tbsp lemon juice and m'wave another 1 minute, let sit for 1 minute or until the meat is done. Granddaughter loves it!  Bounce it around a little to coat. One dish, simple!

I really don't like broccoli, but this was delicious!  I did use fresh broccoli, steamed in the microwave.  Made the butter sauce as directed and poured over it. A lot quicker this way too!  I think I may try this butter sauce on fish or shrimp.

My family loves broccoli.  I thought this dressed up version would be a nice change, but it was mediocre at best.  My kids, who normally gobble their broccoli, barely touched it.  This probably would have been better without the water.  Cooking the broccoli with the lemon juice turns it brown.  It'd probably be better to make the sauce separately and pour it on top of the cooked broccoli, although I probably won't bother making this again.

I used fresh broccoli in this dish to 
avoid the limp broccoli issue. I also omitted the water to give it a more concentrated butter/lemon taste. Oh, and I added garlic, to go along with the theme of dinner.

I loved it but noone else did.

Although this recipe was easy and edible I me & my husband didn't like them and won't be making them again.  Strangely, the borccoli was completely overpowered by the lemon, yet the falvor was bland.  Not a good mix of flavors.  Maybe garlic would have helped.
