I gave this four stars because it is easy to make and delicious. The end result is a beautiful peanut flavored syrup that your kids and peanut lovers will enjoy. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar because it is my favorite.

I tried this recipe today. While I was making it, I had three out of four boys whine about 'Peanut Butter syrup, EWE!" I cooked it up and served it anyway...It was a HIT! All of a sudden it was their idea in the first place-- rolling my eyes...

I used evaporated milk in this recipe, plain ol' Jif (I don't keep natural peanut butter on hand) and folded in a half cup of chopped salted peanuts. I did not try this myself but my kids told me it's fantastic. Especially over homemade whole wheat waffles. ;)

I made this as written with regular peanut butter.  It is quite tasty with a sweet peanut butter flavor and a hint of vanilla.  I was worried at first that it was too thin, but it thickened a bit upon standing.  This syrup turned toasted frozen waffles into a special weekday breakfast.  I am excited to try this on homemade waffles and pancakes too.  It also crossed my mind to maybe try this with Nutella in place of peanut butter to make a chocolate syrup, I think I may do that next time.

This is delicious. I only had whole milk and it did thicken it for me. It was more like a caramel consistency. It was still delicious.

I used almond milk, cashew butter, and brown sugar (I didn't feel like going to the store, it's what I found in the pantry and it seemed like it'd work) and used about 5 drops of chocolate extract (because I didn't have enough vanilla - I really should go to the store) and served this over Elvis Pancakes (Krusteaz Buttermilk pancake mix with thin sliced bananas and dark chocolate chips. https://snapguide.com/guides/make-yummy-chocolate-chip-banana-pancakes-1/) . Plates were licked.

I love this. For storing leftovers I bought a cheap condiment bottle with a lid. Microwave for 10 seconds at a time to reheat. I made it as is except I only had whole milk. I was completely broke the day we tried it and had to feed to small kids with what I had in the pantry and fridge. We also made chocolate pancakes so it was basically a peanut butter cup dinner.

Made this with fat free lactose free milk and store brand peanut butter. Was very runny so we had some water and cornstarch. Very good over oatmeal pancakes!

This was very good. My four year old really liked it. While I did too, I found that a little goes a long way. Don't do what I did and pour a generous amount on your pancakes!

I really didn't like this. It was really thin/watery. In fairness I used Kirkland brand natural peanut butter and I haven't been thrilled with that either.

Delicious! Definitely cook it down to the right consistency and maybe add a pinch of salt, depending on your peanut butter. I will for sure make again.

This is really yummy and a great idea. It reminds me of a peanut butter fudge in syrup form. It cooled to room temperature, to the consistency of applesauce. I didn't alter the concept/proportions of ingredients but I did sub half the milk for condensed milk as offered by another reviewer to help thicken a bit. I also subbed half of the sugar for brown sugar. I thought it needed a dash of salt but that's also personal preference. Even for syrup it's pretty sweet--although that's probably because we've (finally) gotten used to real maple syrup. Hubby and kids ate it on pancakes with banana and loved it. Still, next time I will try half the sugar--but there will definitely be a next time.

Easy to make and tastes great! Made it exactly as directed. Took a while for it to come to a boil on medium heat. Used it on German pancakes, but I think it would be great on anything. :)

This was a great recipe. We used brown sugar in place of white and it was a huge success. This was expecially good on the fried bread we made.

I was looking for a pancake syrup recipe using what I had and ran across this. My husband loves when I put peanutbutter on his pancakes so I thought this would be a winner and sure enough it was. My husband was like have you tasted this????  He was so excited. Thanks for the recipe!

I am a peanut butter fanatic, something that I passed to my kids. I made this this morning because we ran out of regular syrup. We like peanut butter on our waffles and pancakes anyway so I thought why not look for a recipe that combines both? This was very easy to put together not to mention with ingredients we always have on hand. I did use half brown sugar and half regular sugar after seeing it in a different recipe elsewhere (along with butter but I figured we'd better pace ourselves) whole milk and plain ol' brand name peanut butter. Great recipe and I'm positive I'll be making it again.

My fiancé obsessed about it for the whole morning! We drizzled it over pancakes, bananas, and whipped cream.

This was so easy to make. I used a brand name peanut butter and 2% milk out of the fridge. It was a huge hit at our brunch.
