Simple and easy to make. A plain baked cheesecake with a different texture that makes it less filling, less rich than the traditional NY style. I served it with fresh fruit sprinkled with sugar and a mango sauce I made out of mango puree.

Easy to make, not too sweet.  The perfect dessert you crave after dinner without overdoing it. I topped it with fresh strawberries. I will definitely make it again. Im a cheese cake lover.

This was indeed light and airy.  It definitely had a much lighter texture than a typical cheesecake.  Mine turned out great, even though I didn't do the water bath - I just took a chance that it would be okay without it.  We topped this with sliced strawberries, and it was a great, light dessert.

The first time I made this cheesecake my daughter and I made 2.  I followed the directions as stated with three exceptions.  We didn't let it sit in the oven for an hour and didn't let it chill for 4 hours in the fridge. After it cooled a bit out of the oven we ate it!  Then we made the second one and did the same!  This is our favorite cheesecake.  Great tasting and with simple directions. I did add a tad more vanilla flavoring.  Only because I had the dollar store brand on hand.  Thank-you for a fantastic recipe!!! XOXOXOXO!!!

This is a very light, very yummy cheesecake. Very easy to make, too. The vanilla wafer cookie crumbs make a nice, thin, simple crust. I added a few squirts of lemon juice, and subbed part skim ricotta for the sour cream. I'll use this recipe again!

This is a pretty flawless recipe. You will not be disappointed.  It is exactly as explained "light and airy", which means it is easier to pound back piece after piece :)

Cons: it's a bit of a thin cake, though I think when I use larger eggs and really beat them like crazy it has better results.

Other things: I have tried different crusts, and I prefer ginger snap crust! I have also made this a few times with agave nectar instead of sugar, and it tasted the same(if not better). My favorite is to put cherry pie filling on top, but not much of the sauce, just the actual cherries, and it is SO GOOD!

Followed the recipe as stated, but the cheesecake ended up with half the hight of what it should be. Otherwise very tasty.

Prefer to the really dense, but I think just a little too soft and fluffy for cheesecake.  I think I'll add a little less sour cream next time.

It is fabulous!  I've made it twice.  The first time I used chocolate graham cracker crumbs on the bottom & sides, and I added a heaping tsp. of fresh orange zest to the egg-cheese mixture.  The second time, I added crushed almond slices to the vanilla wafers on the bottom and sides, included 1 tsp. of almond extract and used a 1/4 cup of Truvia instead of a 1/2 cup of sugar (in fact, it was slightly less than 1/4 cup).  Still yummy.  I have only one concern:  It cracks and "falls" a lot after being taken out of the oven.  However, I just re-read the recipe and saw that it was supposed to rest in the oven for an hour after baking.  Is that my problem?  (Please note I also live at a high altitude.  Could this have an impact?)  The "falling " is the only reason I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5.

Simple, light, good. Exactly what I was looking for. I will most likely add butter to the crust next time so it stays together. I did not use the towel, but filled baking pan with water and put under the cheesecake. It worked just fine. My baking time was 40 minutes. I think you really need to watch it after 30 minutes. Thank you for the recipe. I will make it again.

Fluffy Cheese Cake. Wonderful, not too heavy.  I added two tablespoons of pancake mix to give it more body.

Brings back memories of the cheesecake my dad use to bring home. This is a good recipe for what I was looking for.
