Was a little too cheesy for me.  And the tortilla was VERY soggy.  But, I'd probaly make it again if I was desperate for something quick and easy for lunch. Maybe add a little bit of leftover meat in it.

Have to use different cheeses.  We mix this up depending on our mood.  Also, don't microwave either (like another reviewer said).  This is good for a base...but needs more than the recipe calls for.  Thanks for the post.

While I don't follow the recipe exactly, (I love cheese but not salsa) I still love quesadillas! I recommend them to anyone as a quick and easy fill up, and to everyone. Ages 10+ only though, no little burnt fingers! ^^

These are nothing special - would be good for kids to make for a snack for themselves.  I like a mixture of colby & jack instead of the American processed.  Also prefer to put a little salsa inside too.

I used a blend of shredded cheddar and white cheese rather than the singles and left out the salsa since my son is not fond of it.  I thought this was good but my son took a few bites and called it quits.  He's very picky so it's no wonder I ended up throwing most of it away.  If he had his way he'd live on French toast and peanut butter...(so could I).  You could definitely be creative with this one.

Havent made this, but I suggest when making to use a sharp cheddar, and to bake at 350 for 10 min rather than microwaving.

It's a good, quick lunch. I use packaged shredded cheddar instead of the Kraft singles.

I make these all the time, except w/o salsa (because I never have any on hand...). 2% Pepperjack cheese is the best. I HIGHLY suggest not microwaving them, put cooking them in a nonstick skillet. It gives you a nice crisp tortilla rather than a soggy one. =(

Definately use a different cheese (I like a combination of shredded cheddar and Monterey jack). Also, use a non-stick skillet with a little butter. Gives the tortilla a beautiful color and added flavor. Very kid friendly recipe, both for them to eat as well as prepare themselves.
