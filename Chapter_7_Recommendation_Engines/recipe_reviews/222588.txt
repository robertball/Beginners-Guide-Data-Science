This is a great cheesecake recipe! Very creamy and delicious. A couple suggestions: only use 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon as it is a very potent spice and 2 whole teaspoons makes the crust extremely sweet. You can also use natural unsweetened strawberries either frozen or fresh and the cheesecake tastes just as good!

I followed the recipe almost exactly...I did bake the crust for 7 min. at 300 degrees and then let it cool.  I also made sure to use my ingredients at (almost) room temperature and after pouring it in the spring-pan I let it rest for about 5 minutes to let the bubbles rise.  I baked it for 65 minutes then left it in the oven (off) for another hour then put it (uncovered and still in the pan) in the fridge until the next evening.  The crust was crisp and delicious & a great contrast to the creamy cheesecake. Everyone loved the strawberry sauce in the middle and the extra swirled on top!

Tastes amazing!!!  Few quick tips, only mix the batter on low or you will get too much air in the cheesecake, and if you want it a bit firmer try adding 2 tbs of flour.  Good Luck :)

Made this twice- first time the box of unopened graham cracker crumbs smelled a little "funny", but I kept going.  Ended up throwing it out and now I make my own crumbs from whole graham crackers.  Only change was to leave some of the strawberries out of the puree to use on top of the cheesecake when serving.  My husband loved it!

I love this recipe.  The cheesecake is creamy and delicious and it's easy to make it look beautiful with those strawberry swirls.  I followed the advice and cut back on the cinnamon in the crust to 1/2 tsp. and it was plenty.  NOTE:  one of those cellophane packs of honey maid grahams produced exactly 1-1/4 cup crumbs.  Will definitely make this one again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made. I used an oreo crust per my hubby's request, otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I made sure all ingredients were room temperature. Everyone loved it. It was super easy with no water bath. My husband said there is no reason to look any further for a cheesecake recipe, this is the one! Thanks for the simple recipe.

This is the one!!  From now on, this is the recipe I will use!  It is not only the easiest baked Cheesecake recipe I have ever made, it is also the fluffiest!   I never changed a thing in the recipe,  & although I did think about omitting the cinnamon, I am sure happy that I didn't, it gives it such a nice flavor.   I was lucky enough to still have garden strawberries in my freezer & they were so flavorful.  All of our guests, 10 year olds & up just loved it!  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe that I have been looking for,  for so long!

Awesome! I have never made cheesecake before and wanted to try. This recipe was easy to make and everyone who ate it raved about it. Didn't change anything in the recipe but next time I will probably cut back on the cinnamon as others have mentioned.

This was AMAZING!  I had never made a cheesecake before and this recipe made it quick, easy and simple.  I did only use 1 tsp of cinnamon, but might try it again with the full two.  I made this for my cousins birthday and everyone loved it...some even said it was the best cheesecake they have ever had.  Will def try again and experiment with different fruit,  I think this might make a great base for a key lime cheese cake too.

Instantly infamous. My husband loves cheesecake, I enjoy baking and sending them with him to work. I have always made with fresh berries and only use half the cinnamon. USMC approved.

Made for the first time.  It was great.  Did not have sweeten straberries. Used frozen straberries and just added about a tablespoon of sugar to the final sauce. I topped the cheese cake with fresh straberries and dropped sauce over it. It was delicious.

Talk about heavenly! I made this for Thansgiving since there are a few that don't care for pumpkin....well by the end of the night there were only a couple slices of this left but the pies were barely touched lol..The only difference i made was using a mixture of berries - blackberry, raspberry and blueberry and because of that I used almond extract instead of the vanilla. LOVE this recipe!

This was my first try at something like this and it turned out great. We had family and friends over for dinner recently and this was one of the desserts which everyone really liked. Made me feel good since I am only a novice/want-a-be cook.

Love,Love,Love this recipe!!! I have always wanted to make a cheesecake from scratch and not from a box and never did. Well this year I was able to pick fresh strawberries from our own patch and decided I would like to try to make a cheesecake using fresh strawberries. I came across this recipe and was a little overwhelmed at the length of time it take to get ready but decided that I would try it anyway. Boy am I glad I did. I have gotten nothing but rave reviews from family members that it is one of the best cheesecakes they have ever tasted...right up there with Cheesecake Factory. I have made this 3 times in the last 3 weeks. YUMMY! The only thing I changed was I used the cinnamon crackers instead of adding it in.

excellent recipe, thanks for sharing! Very simple. I only used one teaspoon of cinnamon to my personal preference of sweetness. I also put the cake pan in a tray filled with water to ensure even baking.

brought this into a potluck at work, where we all had to bring in our favorite dessert. I won the first place prize. I have made it before, and spoiled the family with this cheesecake, now they ask me to make it all the time. --- I too only use half the cinnamon since I don't want to over power the crust w/ it.

I made 2 yesterday for a party.  The best recipe ever!!  Even my husband who normally doesn't like cheesecake raved about it! Really pretty easy and sooooo yummy!  I used 1 springform pan and 1 9" fluted pan.  Both worked .  Just didn't take out of fluted pan to serve on plates .I used fresh strawberries from garden I had frozen, and the strawberry sauce you swirl through and then pour on top was incredible.  Putting the extra sauce on top really made it beautiful and a fabulous taste.  I did not change a thing with recipe.  No need, loved it! Would give more stars if possible. Really the best cheesecake I have ever made!!

I normally do a water bath plain cheesecake but wanted to try something different. I didn't have enough frozen strawberries so did 1/2 raspberries. Everyone loved it, I think more than my plain cheesecakes. This one is a keeper!

I did cook a little longer, I hate when the middle doesn't set so I cook more just to be sure. I also used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon like another had suggested. Thanks!

I baked crust like many other suggested prior to filling.  Let it cool first.  And I lightly smoothed inner layer of strawberry filling all over cake.  Topped gently with next layer then used the circle of purée and swirled out.  Looked just like the pic.  Very pretty!  Had extra cream to put on top and was a hit with family.

This is my go to cheesecake recipe.   Always comes out delish.  I make sure my eggs and cream cheese are almost room temp and I let the batter sit for about thirty mins before I put it in.  I have not used a waterbath for this recipe but I do let it cook for the suggested time then crack the door open and shut  off the oven.  I let it cool all the way until basically room temp, then let it cool in the fridge for about 6-8 hours.  This really helps with no cracks.  Awesome recipe!

Love this recipe. I even leave out the strawberry portion of the recipe for a fantastic plain cheesecake. Texture and flavor are my favorite.

I used one tsp cinnamon rather than two, and it was the perfect amount of spice to bring out the flavors in the cheesecake.  I definitely recommend trying this one!

I love strawberry cheesecake, but my boyfriend doesn't. so one half i made it as the recipe indicates (using half the amount of strawberry sauce to keep proportions right of course), the other half i used canned Dulce de Leche using the same method (think a half and half pizza, where the different toppings don't ovelap). Both sides came out great, so if you would like to use this recipe as a base and add different filling/topping flavors, you can certainly do so. The only thing i did differently from the recipe was add only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon per the suggestion of other reviews, and it came out plenty cinnamony, so i can see how 2 tsp may be overpowering for some. Also i couldn't find sweetened strawberries, so i used unsweetened, and added a bit of sugar (i tasted the sauce before adding sugar and it was a bit tart for my liking).

As far as negatives, there's only one. The crust stuck horribly to the bottom of my Wilton springform pan, so a lot was wasted. I'm not sure if the recipe says to use an ungreased pan because it will mess with cooking, so next time i make this (yes there will be a next time), I will add parchment paper to the bottom and see. Also, for the filling, make sure that after fluffing the cream cheese that you do not overmix the rest of the ingredients, because it will add too much air and make it a weird whipped texture, so take care to only mix just enough until all the ingredients  are incorporated together, and no more. 

All in all a great recipe

Oh my goodness, this was amazing! Everyone loved it at the little party I made it for. I used cinnamon graham crackers which took out the steps of adding cinnamon and sugar to the crust, and pre-baked the crust for about 7 minutes. I also took the advice of anther reviewer and made it with a combination of Blackberries, Raspberries, and Blueberries. The cheesecake was beautiful  and perfectly delicious, not too rich or heavy like others I've had in the past. Everyone loved adding extra sauce to the top! I just poured it in a gravy dish and let everyone add as much as they wanted. This is a definite keeper, can't wait to try it with strawberries!

I made this in a graham cracker crust I bought but it turned out just fine I would have had to double the topping for it to look like this though.

Wow!! This is one tasty cheesecake!!  I've made this twice now, both for dinner company and everyone just raves.  I didn't change anything in this recipe (which is unusual for me) and it was just wonderful.  Defiantly worth a try.

Best Cheesecake Recipe Ever!

Aced it the first time and I absolutely love the use of condensed milk (reduced sugar).  It was a hit and was gone in a matter of hours. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is amazing! I had never made cheesecake before and I chose this recipe to make for the holidays.  My family raved about it and was requested our next dinner.  I have also substituted strawberries with other fruit for a different cheesecake.  This is by far the best cheesecake I have ever had. I did follow the recipe exactly.

First cheesecake I've ever made. Came out beautifully the first time. Tastes so much better than anything bought from a store. I left the cinnamon out of the crust entirely, my husband doesn't care for it, still came out delicious.

This was my fist attempt at making a real, baked cheesecake.  It was fabulous.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the cinnamon down to 1 tsp.  I also used fresh strawberries and added a tablespoon of sugar to the puree to add a little sweetness.  I made two of these for Father's Day and received thumbs up from both my dad and my husband.  I would definitely make this again.

This was a very good recipe and easy to make. My family loved it! The only thing I changed was the topping witch I made out of strawberry jam. I have made this multiple times and it is a party favorite! Thank you for this recipe! I have also tried it with raspberry jam and it is just as good!!

First attempt at cheesecake, and it turned out perfect! The condensed milk gives just enough sweetness.

Wonderful cheesecake.  First had this recipe made for my birthday.  Began making it myself.  I hold all the strawberries out for a puree topping.  Beautifully rich flavor and easy to make.

This will always be my ‘go to’ cheesecake recipe.  The only thing I changed was that I used fresh strawberries instead of making a sauce. It was wonderful!

This is a wonderful cheesecake recipe! Extremely easy to make and simple ingredients! Pretty much fool proof and it comes out looking like a restaurant worthy cheesecake! Just beautiful! I made it as is, but with fresh strawberries instead of frozen and it was perfect.  I can’t believe anyone would reduce the cinnamon! The cheesecake itself is not that sweet, so I would not reduce anything. The cinnamon balances it out. Wonderful recipe and definitely a keeper!!!

I made this tonight, so I haven't ate it yet. I'm basing this on the recipe. It was easy enough to make. I have been making a basic cheesecake for several months. I got bored with making just a plain cheesecake, so I wondered if I could make something different. I followed the directions without any changes. After finishing it, there really wasn't much sauce left over. So next time I'm going to try and see what happens by not draining the strawberries.

I didn't change anything. It was very easy and tasted great. I'll definitely make it again. I have a strawberry patch and it produces so many strawberries that I still have frozen berries in my freezer. Since they will be producing again soon, I'm trying to use up the frozen ones from last year. Everyone really loved this cheesecake. I gave the recipe to my daughter and she made it the next night, only with pineapple.

I always make this cheesecake on special occasions and  I always bring this cheesecake to gatherings and everyone always goes bonkers over it! The only thing I change is that I add fresh strawberries, add half the cinnamon, and I use graham crackers and crush them myself because it’s cheaper than the boxed graham cracker crumbs. But I absolutely love this recipe, fairly easy to make and comes out perfect every time!
*I have also experimented with using chocolate graham crackers as the crust, so delicious!

Baked this recipe for a family friend who raved about how good it was. Said it was the best cheesecake she had in years. Mind you, this was my first time making a cheesecake as well. Just followed the recipe like it said, made no adjustments and it came out lovely.

Quite good. 
The strawberry sauce didn't came out shiny as the recipe said... don`t know why. But the taste was quite good, not oversweet. I think we could add more strawberry sauce IN the cheesecake batter to have more strawberry flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but the recipe calls for too much cream cheese, and the cinnamon was a bit strong. I had so much of the cream cheese filling after I made this.
Loved the recipe, but it's a bit much

I baked the crust for 10 min before adding the cheesecake (I use chocolate graham crackers no cinnamon). The cheesecake cracked terribly. Next time I will cook it in a watwr bath like I normally do.

I'm sorry to say I did not enjoy this recipe! The utilization of sweetened condensed milk rather than sugar in the filling is what did this recipe in for me, I think. The flavor was bizarre for a cheesecake. Additionally, the strawberry sauce was in dire need of more sugar. I actually added a teaspoon or two of sugar, and it still wasn't enough.  Maybe this recipe would be great for someone who doesn't like their "sweets" to be so sweet, or for someone who is trying to limit their sugar intake, but I can't see how it would satisfy the average person's desire for cheesecake.

Love it. First time making cheesecake, and it was awesome! Thanks for the recipe. I found that the cinnamon was too much, maybe put a bit less?

Cheesecake used to be my favorite dessert - until I was diagnosed with celiac. I was really wanting some cheesecake and the only substitution I had to make to this recipe was gluten-free graham crackers.  They worked perfectly and my family loved it!  The texture is amazing  - a little more creamy than most baked cheesecake recipes. I was so excited to be able to enjoy a slice of cheesecake again! YAY!

This is my fave strawberry cheesecake! I use fresh berries and add a touch of Splenda instead of using frozen, sweetened berries.  For a thinner crust, I crush a few almond cookies in a blender, spray my spring form pan with Pam, add the cookie crumbs to the pan, then tap them to cover the bottom and sides.  That adds just enough of a 'crust' for us.  It also makes a pretty presentation when the cheesecake peeks through the crumbs.  I'll be serving this cheesecake for our anniversary!

Absolutely loved this recipe! My only advice is to follow the recipe as written. I only had fresh strawberries so my sauce wasn't as sweet as sweetened frozen ones might have rendered but that suited me just fine because it gave this cheesecake a bright, fresh strawberry taste. Coupled with the creamy dense filling, it is simply ambrosial!

Too many have made this and raved over it but mine cracked horribly as it cooled.  But it looks pretty, has an amazing flavor and a nice creamy texture  as compared to most.  I agree with one reader, 1 tsp of cinnamon in the crust is plenty.

I make cheesecakes all the time but mine take 5 hours in a low oven of 200°F.  They come out so creamy and stay flat.  I have to give this 4 stars because it took forever for the center to even get close to setting which is 163°F (allows for carry-over baking to reach 165°F).  After an hour, a test probe far from center came out wet.  After that I used a digital thermometer.  My oven is calibrated and spot on regarding baking temperatures.

On a positive ending note, I like the technique of the swirl in the center (I'm just not creative at all), and the sauce.  I used fresh strawberries and sweetened them to just slightly tart to contrast with the sweetness of the custard.  

So, in all fairness, I'll try this recipe again only in a low, 200°F  oven for 4 - 5 hours and see how it works regarding appearance - flavor-wise this is delicious!  Win some - lose some.  Never say die!

So fantastic! I usually make a cheesecake with a sour cream topping, but I tried this one and my family definitely loved it! The only change I made was using a quart of fresh strawberries, and that worked out well. The crust, the creamy cheesecake, the strawberry sauce... it was all very tasty.

It turned out great. But for me I didn’t add the eggs and lemon juice and just baked it for 10 minutes at 300 degrees. It still turned out really good because I froze it before serving which makes the crust more crunchy. Also I added a bit less sugar in the crust because for my crust I used a sweeter biscuit. But overall this is a great recipe!

Made this twice - the first time I used fresh strawberries, and the second time I bought  frozen raspberries by mistake, so I used them (made a Raspberry Cheesecake, I guess), and I was out of condensed milk, so I substituted evaporated milk and sugar. It was an easy recipe, and it came out beautifully both times. The first time, it cracked something terrible - so I covered it with strawberry sauce. It was a thank you gift for the local fire department, and they said it tasted amazing! The second cake - we ate every bit ourselves. I will make it again over and over. This recipe is a keeper!

It was pretty easy to make, but it didn't taste as sweet as I expected. This cheesecake is just like eatting creamcheese and strawberriess together. No sugar. Still taste ok, but it's not what I wanted at the time.

We're a bunch of cheesecake snobs, heavily into New York style so i was hesitant to make this.  However it looked interesting and easy so i made it with the only change of using less cinnamon in the crust, and it was fabulous!!! Everyone said it was the best cheesecake they've had.  This will be my go to cheesecake recipe now, thank you!!!!

This is always a hit with the family. Only change I will make next time is less cinnamon and sugar in the crust as there was plenty in the graham crackers already.

Best cheesecake I've ever made. It was quickly devoured by the family and some said it was the best cheesecake they've had. I took a shortcut and just bought strawberry pie filling, blended it and added a little water to thin it out. I'm sure it would have been even better if I had made the pie filling myself, maybe I will next time, because there most certainly will be a next time.

This was my first try at a cheesecake, and I expect it would have turned out really well, BUT I made a huge mistake using the can of evaporated milk on the shelf instead of sweetened condensed milk which is an altogether different product (read the ingredients list, dummy!). I'll try again. But not today.

One of the best cheesecakes I have ever had—and I have had MANY over the past 40 years!  The recipe is as simple as it is delicious—not as heavy as many cheesecakes and so creamy.  Everyone raved about it at my Christmas dinner.  The only thing I did differently was I used vanilla wafers rather than graham wafers—and left out the cinnamon.  Fabulous recipe!

Great recipe...mase it twice both times were excellent, and this was my 1st time doing a cheese cake. I tweaked the recipe a little. I did not use frozen strawberries instead I used fresh strawberries..1/2 cup of crushed gram crackers that I crushed myself. And a 1 1/2 teaspoon on cinnamon... I also put sliced strawberries over the cake on top if the sauce.

Learned how to make baked cheesecake from a YouTube video, not nearly as daunting as it seems. Have learned a few pointers along the way so I added them into this recipe.

1 Crust,, rather than buy the relatively box of graham crumbs for $6, I bought a bag of teddy graham's on sale for $2, works just the same. If I need an Oreo crust just buy a bag of Oreos, skip adding sugar as the filling makes it sweet enough and totally dissodars when processed in the food processor. Can use any cookies for this, Fudgeos, Peanut butter cookies etc etc.. Cheaper and adds a lots more flavour to the crust.
When it comes time to spread in a buttered Springfield pan I use a small round sauce pan to spread out the crust mixture evenly, and by rolling it Lon the sides of the cake pan it even rolls out flat and  also up along the sides of the pan to create a perfectly even crust every time. 


2. BAKING
 I use a water bath, a large roasting pan filled with water just about to the 3/4 mark on the Spring form pan, don't forget to tightly wrap the pan bottom and side, leave top open, with heavy duty tin foil. The water bath prevents cracking and keeps it from drying out during the baking times, temp and times all stay the same, let it cool in the water bath as well in the oven for at Keaton 6 hours or overnight. Never had a cheesecake crack yet using this method.

Excellent recipe, turned out fantastic for my 6th attempt at baking one since I started learning last spring.

So I made this exactly precise to the recipe, it didn't come out well the flavor was a off and I think the lemon juice didn't compliment it well. I'm not also taking the blame as well for it not coming out spectacular, I'm ot sure how long it was supposed to beat but I put it in my electric mixer and the consistency was a little off so that may have had some to do with it. All honesty I don't think I'll attempt this recipe again, but I'll try a new one and see if it's me or just this recipe.

Made this recipe for a few years now and it is a big hit. I get requests every Thanksgiving.  Came out perfect. Not too firm, not too fluffy.  This year I'm using this recipe but regular mixture on bottom and a portion mixed with pumpkin for the second layer. My favorite is strawberry but this is a perfect base for other flavors.

Made it, but it was wet in the middle after 65 minutes. What size springform pan was supposed to be used? It didn't s9ay, I used a 8 inch pan. It tastes good but takes longer than 45 - 50 minutes.

I made the cheesecake part of this recipe according to the method, with the exception of less cinnamon in the crust.  I also cooked it for 55 minutes instead of 50 and it came out perfect!  I made this for my niece's wedding as a "groom's cake".  I have tasted but just a tiny bit of the cheesecake part but it's pretty darn good!  Instead of the strawberry sauce recipe listed, I used a jarred whole fruit spread and that seemed to work.

Was to soft. It wouldn't hold its shape. Worked best at a drizzle over strawberry brownies.

Next time I will use more of the strawberry purée in the cheesecake.  As it was I used about a 1/2 cup and that was not enough.  Also when cooking the berries I added 1/2 cup of sugar. Glad I did!  Super easy and a little different from the normal cheesecake. I think would be great with apricot filling or pineapple

This was really tasty! I followed the recipe to a T and mine turned out just like the photo :) it was a bit lighter and sweeter than the average cheesecake but it was very tasty. I found the sauce too thick so I added the leftover juice from the frozen berries.

This was really good!  The only modifications I made were to increase the graham cracker crust quantity (I like a think crust on my cheesecake), to cut the sugar quantity in half (1/4 of a cup). It was still sweet (with the crust and condensed milk) and delicious, and to use real strawberries.  It tasted wonderful...rave reviews from my guests!

Made it for my 17 year old's birthday and no one could stay out of it. I cheated with store bought crust and also did a minor tweek; instead of swt cnds milk, I used 14 oz coconut cream and enough powdered sugar to make it taste right. Yummmm

My first attempt at making cheesecake. I thought the center was a little too soft. The recipe calls for 45-50 minutes in the oven, but I think it should be a little longer for the center to set. Other than that, it tasted really good and my fiends loved it!

I have been making cheesecakes for years, but this is the first time that I have used sweetened condensed milk in place of sugar and it turned out great!  I think it makes the cheesecake have a creamy texture and this cheesecake tasted awesome!!! Everyone loved it and my son wants me to make a raspberry one -- which will be easy to do because the fruit sauce can be adapted to just about any fruit! Thanks for a great recipe to add to my cheesecake recipe collection!!!

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake and it turned out delicious. I made a couple minor changes. I used my food processor, fresh strawberries,  full teaspoon of vanilla,  Graham cracker pie crust store bought (leftover from the holidays). I let mine cook about 5-10 minutes longer.  My strawberry design did not turn out but at least it tasted good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Best cheesecake I've ever eaten! That's what my family said, and I agree. It's wonderfully creamy, not dry like some New York style cheesecakes can be. And it's beautiful, with the fruit flavor layered throughout instead of just on the top. I've decided this is my only go-to cheesecake recipe!

This was a great and easy cheesecake to mske. It was my first time ever making a cheesecake, and it came out awesome. I posted some pictures of my first one of these cakes, because I know I will make more. I did change one thing though, I used chocolate Grahamcracksrs instead of traditional.

This recipe has now become a holiday must have. I follow the recipe exactly as it is written except I only use half of the sauce ingredients because we don't use the extra sauce at the end for the topping.

Such a good recipe! I made this as my first attempt at a cheesecake ever and it came out perfect! I made it a couple of weeks ago for my boyfriends birthday and gave some to my mom as well. They both liked it so much that I am actually in the process of making two more to bring to thanksgiving meals tomorrow! My boyfriend even said it was better than any cheesecake he has had from restaurants before!

I'm not a huge fan of graham crackers so I substituted half with crushed gingersnap cookies. Then I swapped half of what was left with some rolled oats (the quick cook ones, not the microwaveable packets). I also made double the fruit sauce, adding extra to the cakes and having extra for drizzling on once cooked. I used a mixture of frozen strawberries, frozen field berry mix (including more strawberries), and frozen mango. I really liked it, and so did the other two people who managed to snag a piece before I polished them off. Lol

My boyfriend loves cheesecake, so I figured I'd try my hand at it for his birthday. I'd never made cheesecake before so was a little nervous but it came out perfect! I followed the recipe, though I accidentally put in 1/3 cup lemon juice instead of the 1/4 cup, so it came out slightly lemony which went really well with the strawberry sauce! I'll definitely be saving this recipe, the cheesecake is nice and creamy and wasn't too hard to make!

The cheesecake tasted good, but the recipe calls for more than the pan can handle. I also recommend adding about 2 tablespoons of sugar to your strawberry purée while its on the stove. Otherwise it's a little too sour. The crust also gets greasy.

This is my favorite cheesecake recipe to make, everyone I've made it for has loved it. Because I don't have a springform pan and because I'm not a fan of doing the dishes, I use store bought, disposable, aluminum pans that come in a 3 pack. They're not as deep and you have to watch how much you add to them but overall it just ends up making 2 cheesecakes instead of one which in my eyes is a bonus!

Great recipe followed the instructions exactly as written with only one change. That was to reduce the cinnamon to 1.5 tsp instead of the 2. .. As far as everything else to the letter.. Baked  for 45 minutes. Was creamy texture with a great strawberry flavor subtlety  through out the cake.  One thing I would do next time it to bake the crust for 10 minutes at 300. As written the crust is some what soggy.  I will bake this again

I made this just like the recipe and it went over amazing. My fiancée loves blueberries so I decided to make  a blueberry version for her, and it worked out equally amazing. If you want an amazing cheesecake, don't change a thing, this is an absolute gem.

Gets better with time.  It was ok the day after I made it, but by day 3 I had to get it out of my house before I ate it all!  I followed the instructions in the comments to cut back the cinnamon, and left it in the oven a bit longer til it didn't jiggle much, and then just turned off the oven and left it for a bit til I was ready to go to bed.  So much easier than most cheesecake recipes I looked at.  Make sure if you don't get sweetened strawberries you taste the mix so you can add sugar if they're tart.

The cake was creamy and delicious. I thought there was too much butter in the crust at first but it turned out alright after baking and chilling. Many deep cracks formed after I took it out of the oven though. Thankfully, the cracks were where the strawberry sauce was and where I had used a fork to marble the cake so it was not that ugly.

I used raspberries instead of strawberries, and used plain yogurt with a bit of sugar to replace half of the sweetened condensed milk. (I didn't have enough.)  
Everyone loved it! I think this will be my go-to cheesecake recipe.

This was incredibly good. I made it as directed the first time. Everyone loved it . The second time I used canned strawberry pie filling for the topping just to save time and it was still very good.

Fantastic! The only quibble was that I only have unsweetened frozen strawberries at my grocery store so I had to add sugar to get this working right. Otherwise it came out just perfect!

This is our new favorite strawberry cheesecake recipe. It's more delicious everyday!  I used my own frozen strawberries, I pureed, added sugar to taste,  adjusted the cornstarch,and followed the rest of the recipe. I added the 2 extra tablespoons of flour to the filling,  due to our altitude.  Worked wonderful.  I've never made one without pre-baking the crust, it made it easier.

Not good at all.I followed the recipe,checked and double checked to make sure I followed it properly.It looked good but I was sure sugar was suppose to be in the filling and I checked the recipe and the directions only called for sugar in the crust part.This was my first attempt at baking a cheesecake so I figured if I followed the recipe it must be right. guess what? It is suppose to have sugar!! I brought this awful tasting cheesecake to a family supper and not realizing how bad it was I was mortified when I was told that it DIDN'T taste good !!! Who ever posted this needs to edit the directions an ingredients list and add sugar.After reviewing other recipe's which I wish I would have done and spared myself the embarrassment I now know sugar should have been in this recipe.

This Cheesecake was soft and not the best tasting either. I made the cheesecake part exactly as instructed and even left it in the oven for a few hours after turning the oven off and it didn't help. I placed it in the fridge for almost 24 hours before slicing it and it was very soft. Didn't eat it until another day later and was even softer when I ate it. I placed in the freezer for a few hours to see if that would get it to harden up and that didn't work either. I am sticking to the traditional way of making a cheesecake.

Sorry, too rich for me, even using Philly light ! Also a few things didn't work.
I found a little confusing the quantities indications, then using fresh strawberries I had to adjust the sugar. Following most of the advices I beated the cheese mix a very long time but it didn't turn to the aerian silk I was expecting, just more like butter ! The crust is perfect though and YES ! definitively needs the cinnamon. I ended up with not so much of strawberries spread compared to the cheese mix so it was hard to save some for the top decoration and so thick that the final result was FAR from the nice pattern of the picture. 
Soooo I guess I did something wrong somewhere... Strawberry cheesecake being a favourite I shall give it a 2nd try though, maybe with eggs whites in the cheese mix to make it lighter ? and with more fruits. I shall also separate the lemon juice (with the strawberries) from the vanilla (with the cheese). The final piece of cake was eaten after 4 days : the crust was then softer than at first but the taste nearly better as all the aromas had mixed and develop together.

I've made cheesecake before but my husband wanted a Strawberry cheesecake, this was the first recipe I came too. I used less cinnamon as per other reviews and added conf. sugar to the topping because it tasted quite tangy (could have been because they were frozen though). Overall - great cheesecake. Will be using this recipe in the future, even for regular cheesecake.

Great cheesecake made it with fresh strawberries (Stickler for fresh as opposed to processed) and worked out great and added some Balsamic vinegar to the strawberry mix. The whole cake was nice and so easy to make.
