It's so delicious. I made it for my school bake sale. I found some extra large chocolate chips at safeway! Plus, at the fair, I won second place! My complements to the chef.

Took to a couples poker game on Derby Weekend.  Everyone LOVED them & they were gone so fast, I didn't even get one myself!  Easy to make, moist and a nice change from normal chocolate chip.

These were seriously the best cookies I've ever made. I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and about a tablespoon of cocoa powder, left out the pecans, and made cookie bars (baked for 20 minutes at 350). Two days later, they're still super soft and moist. The vanilla notes in the bourbon I used came through really strongly, although I might add a little more bourbon next time to make the flavor even stronger. Also for next time, I might use some honey bourbon, or I might make mint julep cookies using either mint chips or a bit of mint extract.

I made half the receipe because of not having enough ingredients for the full receipe . I did add three tablespoons of Buffalo Trace bourbon . These are great! Im not sure what one of the reviewers was talking about because I can taste the bourbon. I did put the dough in the fridge for a cple of hrs before baking . Will definitely be making these on Derby Day !! Thanks for the great receipe Amy!!

I didn't add the bourbon and substituted the pecans with walnuts. They turned out great! So buttery and delicious!

I love this recipe, but take note of what type of cookie it is! They're quite flat as shown in the picture, but they're quite soft and yummy; they're not a hard or crispy cookie. The bourbon is really subtle but enhances the overall flavor and texture of the cookie. So, steer clear if you're a lover of big cakey cookies, or crispy ones. Otherwise, give it a shot!

Delicious! I donâ€™t have a mixer so I had to cream the butter and sugar by hand. It was a workout! The cookies turned out a litter flatter as a result but were still delicious.

Very good! My favorite recipe by far! I used a bit less chocolate chips simply because I'm not a huge fan of having too many in my cookies. Pecan quantity is great though!

This was a really great chocolate chip cookie! However, I like the taste of Bourbon and it was not really that noticeable after baking. I will make this again but I will increase the amount of Bourbon next time to give it a kick.
