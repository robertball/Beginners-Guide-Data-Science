I entered a chili cook-off and WON 1st place! I halved the chili powder (actually I used a generous 1/4 cup), and used about 18oz of Hunt's Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce. As for the sausages, I used hot (spicy sausages) and removed the casing before cooking the ground sausage meat. I cooked it for a total of 4 hours and have had several people ask for the recipe within hours of winning. It was just the right spiciness, just the right sweetness (not too sweet) and turned out fabulous! Great recipe!

This chili took second place at a recent chili cook-off that had fairly stiff competition (7 other decent entries).  Of course, what makes this particular recipe a “winner” is its novelty.  Who doesn’t enjoy chocolate? So here are my tips for taking a prize with this recipe:

(1)  Give it a good name that includes the word chocolate.  No offense to Rick, but call it something like “Chocolate Chili Cha Cha”.  This also warns away anyone who may be allergic to the key ingredient.
(2)  Offer two toppings only: sour cream and shaved chocolate.  (Let the competition keep that dull cheddar cheese.)
(3)  Add a few dashes (or more) of cayenne pepper to give it a little pep.
(4)  Cut back on the BBQ sauce as others suggested, but consider adding ¼ cup of brown sugar.  But be careful: don’t make it too sweet.
(5)  Add more beans (as I did) if you feel the meat to bean ratio is too large.
(6)  Make it 36 to 48 hours prior to the competition to allow the flavors to meld.

Also, many people commented that the chili reminded them of a mole (MOH-lay) – a traditional Mexican sauce served over chicken or turkey that incorporates chocolate but is not typically sweet.  So, you may want to consider serving it with hot corn tortillas (instead of corn bread).  The idea is to set your chili apart from the rest of the competition.  Good luck…and may the best chili win.  Yours.  [One last note: I sliced the onions into thin rounds and sautéed them in a little of the bacon grease.  Delicious.]

I entered this recipe in a Chili CookOff and won two prizes.  One for "Best" chili and the other for "Spiciest" chili.  I reccommend adding fresh jalepenos and a little garlic.  I also would change the BBQ sauce to a brown sugar based BBQ 16-18 oz. bottle.  Overall it was a favorite.

I made this for a chili cookoff last night and won 3rd place! It really is good BUT all the reviews about decreasing the amount of BBQ sauce were right on the money. The chili tastes a little like BBQ. I would at least halve the amount of sauce. It is really flavorful!!

My husband loves Chili.  Me...not so much.  I generally make it when I want something fairly easy and need to stock up the freezer with left-overs for future busy nights.  However, this recipe was excellent.  I consider myself a pretty decent cook but chocolate?  Well, I could not fathom this ingredient making so much difference in a dish but I read the reviews and decided to test.  Very nice addition and now I'm dreaming of using in other recipes for depth. Spicy sausage was a very nice addition as well.  Thanks for the post, this one is a keeper!

I've made this twice now, the last time was last month for a large family gathering. Everyone commented on how great it was and wanted the recipe. My husband and I both agree it was the best chili we've ever had. We froze a bunch of it and have been using it over nachos, and added to velveeta cheese dip for holiday gatherings. YUM! I made the following adjustments:
- For the spicy sausage, I used one pound of hot and one of mild
- Added one additional 12 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapeno peppers 
- Added a dash of cayenne pepper 
- Used brown sugar bbq sauce instead of hickory smoked
- Used three cans of kidney beans instead of four, was plenty!
DELICIOUS!

Using this recipe, I won 1st place at a church chili-cook off! I noticed that others have written about similar success. The only changes I made to the recipe were using half the amount of hickory barbecue sauce and using uncured bacon. I should also note that I used Asian Indian chili powder. Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

Yum, yum!!  I made this exactly as written and got rave reviews at my Halloween party.  Made what I thought was a huge batch but 8 adults polished off almost all but a small bowl (I wanted some for the next day!).  I made Absolute Mexican Cornbread which was soooo tasty and complimented it perfectly.  I made the chili the day before, let simmer for 2 hours, then overnight in the fridge.  Warmed up great the next day and was fantastic!

Rick is either a culinary genius or got lucky trying to figure out a new/better way to fix chili. I have a pretty good recipe for chili, but thought I would give this a try when we had about fifty friends and neighbors over for our annual holiday gathering. I made my recipe as well as Rick's. Both were finished off and well received, but Rick's got the raves. I used 2lbs. of chorizo sausage, 2lbs. of ground beef and 1lb. of pulled pork as well as the 1lb. of bacon. I mixed up the beans a bit using 1 can of dark red kidneys, 1 can of light red kidneys, 1 can of pintos and 1 can of great northerns. I also added about 2 tbs. of ground cumin. I took it slow adding the bbq sauce, tasting as I added, but ended up using the full 32ozs. Great flavor! Everyone wants the recipe.

I made this chili for Superbowl last year and it was popular enough to make a repeat appearance this year. BUT, I needed to make one important tweak (hence the 4 stars). I now use only one cup of the bbq sauce so it adds a SUBTLE element to this chili rather than an overwhelming one. I also recommend adding half the chili powder if you like a subtle spiciness. Half the amount of chili powder along with the spicy sausage makes for a subtle spiciness. But if you like it hot, by all means add the full amount. This recipe makes a TON of chili, so it's perfect for a large crowd. Tip: your cooking pot needs to be bigger than 8 quarts if you are going to simmer the chili in the pot. I mix the whole thing up in my 8 quart stock pot but it's too full to actually let it simmer in, so I then split it between two slow cookers and cook on low heat for the entire day. Makes the house smell delicious. Popular with everyone, kids and adults alike, this is definitely meat lovers chili - my daughter dubbed it 'Man Chow'. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

GREAT RECIPE!!!!! I won first place in a chili cook-off and everyone loved it. I did halve the BBQ sauce and used chorizo instead of the spicy sausage and only one tomato sauce and added an extra can of diced tomatoes. VERY VERY YUMMY! :)

Just didn't care for this chili. I like things sweet but this was too sweet. I cut the recipe in half and used a 12 oz bottle of BBQ and it was still too sweet. I added sauteed green peppers and onions and lots of other things to try and "fix" the taste but this was really pedestrian chili. My husband said it was "fine" but that's not what I'm going for. Sorry.

Yummy! I tied for 1st in a chili contest with this recipe.  I cut the recipe in half; otherwise, it wouldn't have fit in my crock pot.  I followed the advice of others that said to let it sit for a day before serving, and that's exactly right. The flavors were so much better.  I'll be making this often.

This chili is excellent! It takes a while to prepare but it is definitly worth it. I love the smokyness of the bacon in it. I did not use bbq sauce but i use a dash of liquid hickory smoke and it turned out really nice. I did put some carots, corn and celery in it because i love vegies in my chili. I also used 3 different kind of beans to have different colors and textures. I used more tomato sauce, more chili powder and more chocolate because i haded a lot of vegetables and needed more spices. I also used a bit of cayenne pepper powder. I will deffinitly make this again, it is excellent with sour cream and corn chips. I now have a huge batch i will enjoy for the rest of the winter! (i used my crock pot and a big soup pot...)

I was excited to try this recipe after reading all the chili contests it had won.  I was a  bit dissapointed.  The taste was very BBQy. Too sweet for Chili.   My family didn't seem too thrilled either.   PLENTY of left-overs... ugh.

I thought this recipe was good but not award-winning. Of course it may just be me and my preferences for chili, but I thought the chili powder may have been too strong and overwhelming for the recipe - with good ingredients like sausage and bacon, I was wishing I could taste them more. Just my opinion........

Won 1st place in a chili cook-off with this today. The only thing I changed was that I used Sweet Baby Ray's hickory/honey bbq sauce and only used about 7 oz worth (Do NOT use 32 oz!!!) I also carmelized my onions in the bacon grease before adding them. I also used 3 oz of unsweetened chocolate instead of 2 oz. I garnished with cheddar, sour cream and some cilantro. I also friend tortilla chips and sprinkled with chili pepper and cocoa and stuck one in each dish. Superb!

It was the chocolate that intriqued me.  I've never cared for chili, although I've wanted to, I just couldn't find the right combo of ingredients.  I made up the whole batch, and then put it in a slow cooker to cook on low all day and it was simply AMAZING!!!!  Was SO proud!!  Hubby is thawing out the left over's RIGHT NOW for lunch tomorrow!

This tasted like an upscale "sloppy joe".  Chili should have a distinguishable flavor - this way way too sweet - the bbq sauce is too overwhelming.

Love the 3 different meats in this chili and the chocolate.   Bought the italian diced tomatoes with italian seasoning.  Would recommend using noted amount of barbecue sauce but add 2 extra stout guinness beers, a tablespoon of cumin and a dash of cayenne pepper. Shortly before serving add a cup of masa flour and wow this is one fantastic chili!

This is one of the best chilis I have ever tasted and I generally am not a big chili fan.  I make chili every Superbowl (because that's what people do), but after making this- yum!  There is only one other I know of that would compete with it- My neighbor Scott makes a rockin' pulled pork chili. Anyway, if you make Rick's you won't be disappointed!

This would have got a 5 - but the last added ingredient ruined it for me! The unsweetened chocolate added a burnt taste :( I will make the recipie again sans the chocolate and it will definitely be a 5.

This was the best chili i have ever made and tasted. I made it for my family of 15 and some of my coworkers and everyone of them absolutely loved it!!! At first i was a little skeptical about the chocolate, but after eating it the chocolate gives it that little hmmm factor that makes you wonder what is in this chili that makes it soo good.  The only change i made was i halved the BBQ sauce, but still followed the directions and it turned out wonderful. This is now the offical chili receipe of my household. thanx a million.

Amazing!!  I followed other reviews and added much less BBQ sauce and I'm glad I did.  I'm not sure about the choc. though, It seemed like mine didn't mix very well with the soup. . .?? Maybe I did not melt it well enough?

All the ingredients blend together to make a dish that is more than just the sum of its parts.  Michael Edwards.

I made this for a chili/soup cookoff at work. Not only did I not win, but mine had the most left uneaten. I was pretty happy at first - it's a little different with the different meats in it. I liked it though - until I added the choclate. I only added 1/2 of what was recommended. To me, it ruined it. If you like Mole sauce, you may really enjoy it. I may try again without the chocolate.

This is a terrific recipe....minus the BBQ sauce. Don't reduce the amount you use, just omit it completely. It really takes away from the spice and chili flavor.

Took a chance and nailed it! Cooking all of the meat does take some time in prep, it's well worth it.  Before putting in the chocolate, it really did taste like a BBQ chili.  However, the chocolate seemed to balance out the flavor and it was....well, beautiful! I added a little more of the chili powder to give it more kick and did cut the BBQ sauce in half like others had suggested. I think the next time I make it I might add one more can of beans....as I like a lot of beans in my chili. I have added this to my recipe box and will FOR SURE make it several times again.

Really good!  Even my picky 17 year old liked it. I did cut the BBQ sauce in half, and will probably decrease it a little more next time.  Just personal preference...this is a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe I tried to give a little variety in what I normally cook.  I'm not used to sweet in the chili and I think the large amount of bbq sauce was too much for me.  I like the spicier side of chili but was fun to try.  I also liked the large amount of meat included with this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Ive been making this for a few years now, started off because it was my boyfriend's theory that EVERYTHING tastes better with bacon!  I found this recipe with that in mind, and although it sounded a bit different, i tried it.  It is the BEST chili recipe ever! I've never even been a big chili fan and LOVE this.  My 10 year old son is the pickiest eater ever and loves it too!  I halfed the recipe tonight and have a pot on the stove now, it smells great!  No alterations necessary...sometimes (if we have it) we put a little cheddar on top, but its certainly not needed for flavor!

I made this for a group of about 100 people. Everyone loved it. I had several people tell me that this is the best Chili they have ever eaten. I loved telling folks it had chocolate in it. They could hardly believe it.  Thank you! This is a definite keeper.

I loved this chili!  I did, however, read the comments and saw that I #1) Was making enough to feed an army and #2) was adding way too much BBQ sauce (by 50%).  Keeping thos two things in mind it made a great chili and will be introduced to my extended family next fall probably as Chili Jer's.  Okay that sounds horrible...maybe Chili Jerome...I'll work on that over the summer.

Mark another 1st place up for this chili.Despite the strong competition, this recipe blew away the judges and received top marks all around.  I added canned corn for color and texture, and traded out some of the kidney beans for black and white beans.  Half of the bbq sauce is more than sufficient as it is strong and has a tendency to give it a burnt flavor as the sugars start to carmelize.  I also served a sour cream/fresh chopped cilantro topping on this which  gave a cool and refreshing break from the heavy and powerful chili flavors.  Overall, it was a superb base to work from and easily allowed for minor adjustments to suit each taste.

This chile was awesome the next day! When I was cooking it, all I could taste were the chocolate and bbq sauce.  Took the advice of another and tried it again the next day.  It was one of the best chili's I have tasted!  Cut the bbq sauce by half though.

I also won a prize in a chili cookoff with this chili.  I cut the amount in half, and used about 1/2 of a 14-oz bottle of bbq sauce. Great recipe.

I made this chili month's ago and I forgot to rate it. This is absolutely the best chili that I have ever had. A lot of work but it is worth it in every bite.  It also freezes well too.

I didn't really like this recipe.  It was too sweet for me and I didn't care for the hickory taste in the chili.  I think I will stick with a basic chili recipe in the future.

Delicious -- and really easy to make! Since my mouth is too wimpy for anything too spicy, I like that this recipe is not dependent on lots of hot stuff (though that can certainly be added if one wishes). This was my first try at making chili, and it came out just perfect. I plan to make it often.

Really good chili.  My son made this the other day, and it was outstanding.  My personal favorite chili is "Best B.E.A.N. Chili from this site, but this one was very different--definitely a heavier chili.  Very good with cheese and sour cream and tortilla chips.  Served it with sweet corn bread.

Delicious, but thicker than I like.  I might try adding more liquid.  I did let it simmer quite a while, maybe too long.  Also, I wasn't brave enough to try the chocolate this time because I was having guests.  I will try it sometime though.

I made this recipe for my first chili ever and entered it in a neighborhood chili-cook-off and won 2nd place.  I did cut the BBQ sauce and used the brown sugar type as suggested by another reviewer, used 1 # mild and 1# spicy sausage, used 3 cans kidney beans and added cayenne to taste (which made it spicier than it would have been).  My husband said it was better the 2nd day. So if I had made it a day earlier I might have won 1st place!

This recipe was great! I also used it for a chili cookoff at work and won 1st place! I used green chili sausage and Stubbs barbecue sauce. In my trial batch I used unsweetened chocolate and ended up using sweetened for the actual contest and was great either way. I called it "Willy Wonka Chili" It was a big hit!

This is awesome chili!!! I've made it several times and I usually cut the chili powder and BBQ sauce in half. I also do half kidney beans, half chili beans. I never have unsweetened chocolate in the house so I always forget that.

my first time cooking chili and I won 2nd place in the firm cookoff.  4 stars only because I made quite a few modifications:  used 1/2 the tomato sauce it called for, replaced one can of diced tomatoes with a can of rotel, added some liquid smoke, used Chappell Hill sausage (removed the casing and sliced), used kidney and black beans, and only used about 6 ounces of BBQ sauce

This chili is fantastic!  Two kinds of pig and cow!  I don't use quite so much BBQ sauce (too sweet), and I like it a bit hotter, so I add hot chopped chilies or something to give it a little kick.  I also added a tablespoon or so of cumin to keep the taste familiar.

I adore this chili as is (except without the chocolate- can't stand mole taste so I don't want to go there).  My husband prefers this recipe with the bbq sauce cut in half so it isn't so sweet.  I sometimes use small chunks of stew meat instead of hamburger because I prefer the texture.  When I know my guests aren't crazy about beans I leave them out.  This tastes great without them, it just of course doesn't stretch as far.  When I leave the beans in I use whatever I've got on hand- black, kidney, chili or whatever as long as they aren't seasoned.  It makes the color more interesting too.  Fabulous and simple recipe, thanks!  Company always raves!

Now I am basing this review on other's oooo's and ahhhhh's because I don't like chili. Every time I go to a picnic, people ask me "You are making your chili aren't you?" I stick pretty much to the original recipe. To keep the clean up down, I fry the bacon crisp, pull it out to drain on paper. I then put the sausage and ground meat in same pot and brown, then drain. I put it back into the same pot with the crumbled bacon then add the rest of the ingredients and stir (no seperate meat frying pan necessary). I use Bush's chili beans in hot sauce and sometimes even add tomatoes with chili peppers mixed in. I simmer for one hour covered then one hour uncovered. I am making this today and will transfer it into my crock pot as it makes it an easier transport and server. Anything that doesn't fit stays home for leftovers tomorrow :) As others have mentioned, I too offer trio mexican shredded cheese on the side for those who want to top it off. Although this is a time consuming recipe as well as a little pricey (around $40), the pats on the back are well worth it.

This chili is amazing! I tried to follow the exact recipe, but I only had one bottle of bbq sauce. It was still so delicious, I couldn’t stop eating it while I made it. I am going to let it sit overnight and serve it tomorrow with cornbread muffins and I can’t wait! Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

This is the heartiest, best flavored chili we've had in years!  I sauted the onions with a garlic clove & 1 tsp of red pepper before putting everything into a slow cooker.  I used just one 18oz bottle of kraft smoked hickory BBQ sauce, and a tsp of liquid hickory smoke.  4 hours on high in the slow cooker mixed the flavors really well.  I can't decided if I like the BBQ hint or the bacon pieces better.  This is a guaranteed winner every time!

I made this for a large group of people coming over and they all loved it!  The only thing I really did different was that I used only half a bottle of the hickory sauce and added a 1/4c of brown sugar instead.  (A full bottle would have been way too sweet in our opinion, so I'm glad I took the advice of others on that one).  I also let it cook ALL day (a good 10 hours at least), which made a HUGE difference.  I tasted it throughout the day and by nights end, it tasted great compared to just four or six hours of cooking.  Chocolate seemed to make a delicious difference in the outcome of this recipe.  A wonderful mix of spice and sweetness.  :)  I cooked this up with a side of Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread (also from this site), which was an excellent recipe to go with it.  The chili that was left (this makes a lot), I put in a food saver bag and froze to eat at a later date.  Freezes well.  **Also, one person in our group doesn't eat pork, so I made them a small side of this without the sausage and instead sliced up some beef sausage.  To be honest, I would have sliced up some more beef sausage into the main pot if I had known how good it would have tasted!  So next time I will!  It was delicious!**  Thanks for the excellent chili recipe!

I did not care for this. I halved the recipe, but other than that, I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  It turned out very watery. Do yourself a favor, and don't make this recpie. Skip over it for another!!

This chili is great. I agree about reducing the amount of barbeque sauce- I used a smoky bbq and it was delicious. I had to make mine much spicier though, which is easy to do by adding more chili powder and some cayenne. Also, I should warn you, this is a huge recipe. It wouldn't fit in my biggest pot- I had to divide it into 2!

OMG!!  I had the assignment to bring chili to a potluck because I was one of the only caucasians participating and they wanted really good chili (apparently us white girls can do that?).  Anyway, I was under a lot of pressure to succeed in my assigned task and certainly did not want to dissapoint.  This was a BIG HIT!!  Everyone loved it.  I of course took no credit, but announced it was Rick's chili recipe.  There was a couple servings left over so they got put in ziplocs and put in the freezer for Mondays lunch.  Unfortunately the refrigerater decided to break over the weekend and we lost those two precious bags of Chili Rick.  Tears were shed!

Very tasty.  

I did make a few changes: I used smoked sausage, which I cut into fourths.  Also, like many others, I cut the amount of BBQ sauce to about 18 ounces, and I also used 2 cans of kidney beans, 1 can medium chili beans, and 1 can black beans (rather than 4 cans kidney).  This adds a little variety with the beans, and also makes for interesting mix of colors.  I also cut back on the chili powder.  The only thing mine lacked was enough kick.  Next time, I'll likely try to find a way to re-add the kick without changing the flavor.

Fantastic chili.  Just entered this into a contest today and got first place overall.  
My wife (who does not like chili) said I could make this again any time.
I can't understand why some people would reduce the amount of chili powder.  I used the full 1/2 cup and it was barely medium hot.  It may seem like a lot, but this recipe makes more than the 20 servings it says.  

Changes I made

replaced two cans of kidney beans with cans of medium chili beans.
Italian seasoned diced tomatos
two small cans of diced green chilis

In the next batch, I would cut back a little on the BBQ sauce as that seemed to overpower some of the other flavors.

The BEST chilli we have had EVER! I feell like ive been saying that alot since i started using recipes from this site, but i'm really not lying! I specially ordered the BBQ sauce from usafoods.com.au (the only place in Australia you get get proper American food!!) for this recipe, and im glad i did. The BBQ sauces in OZ just dont have the same smoky taste. I have heard of chocolate with chilli and will never go back now! Thankyou so much for the great chilli recipe! Planning on serving the leftovers tomorrow night with a whole baked potato, sour cream and coleslaw!

Loved this recipe. I had 14 people for dinner. Didn't know if there was gonna be enough. There was enough for seconds and lunch the next day. The only thing i would change is the amount of bbq sauce.  Otherwise everyone liked it...and I'm no cool. Will make again.  :)

Update: WE WON THE COOK-OFF IN 1ST PLACE!!! AND THE TEACHERS EVEN ASKED FOR THE LEFTOVERS!

This was like.. THE BEST chili I've ever prepared and had in my life. The best. Well, I've only ever prepared one, but this is so delicious!!

We had entered this in the chili cook-off at our school, and we decided to switch the bacon with 6 chicken breasts, seasoned with Italian and a bit of salt and pepper and minced garlic. Most of our teachers had loved it!!

We even tried it and it was AMAZING.
This was a chili that I had had when I was about 8, when my father took me to a BBQ Ribs restaurant. We ordered baby back ribs and my little brother was being annoying as usual and complaining because he made a mess on his hands, even though that was how you eat it.
So my dad ordered chili because we were all still hungry, and he decided to get a large bowl.

We couldn't even finish it, but I still wanted to eat it, so I stuffed myself with the rest of the chili! I'm amazed I'm not fat :)

This has got to be like, THE BEST AMAZING CHILI I'VE EVER HAD.

I hope we win the chili cook-off, results will be on Monday :)

I just made this for a staff chili cookoff at our school and it was a hit- 1st place!  10 chili's in the competition, most were excellent but everyone went crazy over this chocolate chili.  I recommend reducing the bbq sauce to at least half otherwise it is too bbqish.  Tried the chili before adding the bbq sauce and it was great as well.

This is a great chili recipe. I actually made two for our community cook off. One as is listed here. The other I added some more spices, jalapeño powder and other hot spice powders to give it a bit more bite. Both were excellent. The flavor is excellent. There was another chili there that prided itself in being extremely hot. I found that it was too hot to enjoy the chili. Even with the added heat I put in, the rich flavor of the chili came out. Rave reviews of the great tasting and hot chili. Thanks Rick.

Add me to the chili cookoff winners using this recipe.  I used half the BBQ sauce of my favorite kind which is brown sugar based.  I also substituted cocoa powder for the chocolate, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did put "chocolate" in the name, which got people's attention.  I won both the 'traditional' and 'judge's choice' prizes.

I made this a few days ago for a chili cook-off, but it never made it to the competition. I heard it was really good. Today I made it again using many of the same ingredients and some of my own ingredients.  I call it my Chocolate Alarm Chili cuz it is a perfect sweet and spicy blend.

I made this chili for a cookoff at work.  It didn't win but the chili was very good. Some people said it had too much BBQ sauce and I used half of the BBQ sauce that it called for.  Overall, very good and the men in my office really loved it!

Let me just tell you that my fiance is the most picky eater in the world, but he loved this chili. The first flavor I tasted was sweet, then there was a surprising kick. I was not used to these different flavors in chili, but by the second bowl I was used to it and loved it! The only thing I changed was cutting the recipe in half as there is only 2 of us. Highly recommend. Thank you.

I hate to be a party-pooper but I did this recipe EXACTLY as written and it was a disappointment.  I should have taken the advice of the other reviewers and used a brown sugar sauce instead of a hickory BBQ sauce.  When I first made this, it tasted like a strange BBQ rather than a chile.  I later added more chile poweder and chocolate, which improved the flavor but when I fed it to a friend who asked me about the weird sloppy joes....  It was OK like this.  Definitely edible but not like chile and not that great.    I have lived almost all of my life in the Southwest including a large time in New Mexico.  I know chile and Mole sauces and this was neither.  I will try it again with the brown sugar sauce and see if that makes this better - or I'll just scratch this recipe of my list and go back to making chiles my own way.  *** One note to those who used less chile powder because they thought it would be too hot.  Try to find a Chimayo chile powder.  It has an authentic, New Mexico chile taste without as much heat as other chile powders.  I usually find this in small bags in either the organic or gourmet parts of the store.

Based on the reviews I expected alot from this recipe and was quite dissapionted, the bbq sauce is very overwhelming, if your trying this recipe for the first time you might consider cutting it in half as it makes a huge pot and it's alot left if no one likes it.

We have entered this into 2 chili cook-offs. It won first place in one and second in the other. My husband likes to let everything but the beans & chocolate simmer for a while, then adds them at the end. We halve this recipe and it still fills a 5 quart slow cooker to the brim.

I've made this recipe four times in one month. It's that great. I halved the recipe because it was just me an my husband. I read the other reviews and made a couple of changes the second and third time around. I used fire roasted tomatoes, added a jalapano for an extra kick, used Sweet Baby Ray's Brown Sugar Hickory BBQ sauce because I couldn't find the other kind suggested. I also  omitted the brown sugar just because I thought it was too sweet. I followed the directions and threw it all in a slow cooker for a couple of hours. It was fantastic each and every time. My in-laws couldn't say enough about it. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I give this 4 stars because everyone seemed to enjoy this. but their reaction  was nothing compared to the pizza/pasta casserole [another allrecipes recipe] I made last night. We didn't have any sausage and I used regular Hersheys chocolate b/c the store across the street didn't have baking chocolate.

Rick must have a much larger pot than most. This is not really a human's chili. It s more like warming up barbeque sauce and lots of meat. My intent was to make a meaty chili but this was off the hook I couldnt even fit most (1/2) the ingrediants in the pot. I recommend scaling this recipe down if you want to eat BBQ sauce by the spoonful.

I made this chili awhile back when I was searching for a different "type" of chili recipe than my traditional. With the addition of the sausage & bacon with the ground beef..this chili is off the charts delicious! I served mine with home made cornbread and topped off with a mild cheddar cheese.. trust me with so much flavor you only need a mild cheese. It's flavorful and filling..in fact, it made so much, that I have leftovers in the freezer! A true 5-star recipe.

Very good!  I also won a chili cook-off with this basic recipe.  I made a few changes based on the ingredients I had.  Didn't have an Italian seasoning so I made up my own mixture of basil, oregano, garlic and parsley.  I used 3 cans of hot and spicy chili beans and reduced the chili powder to about 3 tablespoons.  I only had one pound of hot sausage so I reduced the ground beef to 2 pounds.  I followed the suggestion of others and reduced the BBQ - probably only used about 1/2 cup.  I would suggest frying the bacon very crisp or mincing it.  Most of mine was very crisp, but the few pieces that weren't just looked like fat in the chili.  I took the suggestion of someone else and called the chili "chocolate chili cha-cha" and served it with sour cream and mini chocolate chips.  It certainly piqued everyone's interest.  Thanks for the great recipe and great suggestions!

Won 1st place Judge’s Choice and 2nd place People’s Choice in a cook off with about 15 entries. I made it exactly as written and it has the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. Making it for an upcoming family reunion and I know it will be a hit.

Based on other reviews to add brown sugar, I used a hickory/brown sugar based BBQ sauce. It was a little on the too sweet side so I doubled the amount of chili powder and onions to compensate and added two large cans of green chilis. I will probably use chili sauce the next time instead. I couldn't really taste the mole (chocolate), but my boyfriend could. I used ground chorizo but sliced would have been better to diffentiate the taste between the sausage and hamburger. Also, neither one of us could taste the bacon, so I won't add that next time to save the calories! Over all, I cooked the chili in the crock pot on high for 5 hours.  The end result was that the taste started out sweet then went to the heat which actually made it quite tasteful.  I will definitely try this again.

Reading about so many chili contest winners I thought this recipe must be good.  I made Rick's Chili for a contest and got 1st place.  WOW!!  I also had friends over to try it and they wanted some to take home.  It was such a huge hit.  I did change the following: 1.  Used only 1/2 of an 18oz bottle of BBQ sauce 2.  Used only 1/2 of the Chili powder (it was all I had) and used cayenne pepper for the rest. 3.  Added some coarse pepper  It was an amazing taste along side some corn bread!!

I'm hoping this will taste better after it simmers longer, but for now to's too BBQy.  I used 1/2 and it's still to strong/sweet of a taste.  Maybe I need more chocolate - not sure.  So far this is just OK.

Made this for my daughters 2nd birthday party (mostly all adults) and it was a huge hit.  I got a lot of compliments!  I toned down the spice as a lot of my family doesn't care for super spicy things.  Also cut the bbq sauce in half per other reviews and I'm so glad!  I think it would have been way too much like bbq and not chili had I added the full amount.  Served it with fritos, cheese and sour cream.

This chili was good, but had to much beans.  I may have ruined it a bit myself though with the substitutions.  I don't like kidney beans so I used red beans instead.

I have now won 2 chili cookoffs with this recipe.  I have modified it a bit to add a little more spice (they like it spicy around here), but it is the recipe on which I base all chili that I make.  To add a little kick, I like to add a bit of cayenne sauce and some red pepper flakes.

I will say this is the best chili that I've made to date and it is very tasty. I can't wait until it has blended to perfection! I threw in a few extra herbs/spices and a lot of peppers because I like the heat. A sprinkle of beer doesn't hurt either.I'm quite sure the recipe would be great without any changes.

I LOVE this chili recipe!  I wanted a recipe that was different and would really stand out... this was it!  I followed the recipe exactly and it is just amazing.  I love how it is rich and spicy, but not too spicy.  It is perfect and I am glad I made extra to freeze so that I can have it whenever I want!

I am not a fan of chili with beans, so I deleted the beans and increased the amount of ground beef by a quarter pound. I like chili that has a kick so I added some papaya based habanero sauce. This one is sweet and hot. Great recipe and everyone loved it.

Very good recipe, made a half batch and cut the BBQ sauce down to about 1/2 from there.  I made the bacon pieces to big so I'll fix that next time.  Couldn't taste the chocolate, but it does make it interesting.  Tasted even better after a 6 hour simmer in a slo cooker.

I thought this was great (so did my husband!).  I used unsweetened cocoa powder instead of the chocolate and it was good (the cocoa can had substitution quantities).  It gave the recipe a hint of something different without being obvious. I usually wouldn't mix all of those meats, but I had them on hand, so it worked.  It would be easy to make with red kidney beans and then add another bean too (white northern or black bean).  Yummers!

I won first place in the mild category using this recipe. I used about half the chili powder, 1/4 the Bar-B-Q sauce and used plain ground sausage instead of spicy. I also added some brown sugar about an hour before the contest. I've made it twice now and everybody thats tasted it just loves it. If serving at a contest just serve crackers. Sour cream and cheese takes away the true taste of the chili. Thank's Rick...Great recipe.

Excellent!! I love it. The chocolate is a great touch. The only thing I would recommend changing is the amount of bbq sauce. It gets a bit too much. And I added some beer, which really helped out.  Thanks Rick.

I fixed this a day ahead for a camping trip. Talk about a hit! Because this group had a couple of picky eaters (wasted my time because they wouldn't even try it) so I only replaced half the diced tomatoes with tomatoes with jalapenos. Next time I'll apice it up. I used an 18 oz. jar of brown sugar based bbq sauce - good suggestion. Everyone loved that the "secret" ingredient was chocolate. My only problem was I didnt have a pot big enough to cook it in. I had a very large slow cooker, but I had to put a good bit in a large stock pot. That's not a complaint, but a note. Next time I'll cut it in half for my family of four and freeze the rest. Sour cream and cheddar were nice addtions for some of our group. Serve this with Absolute Mexican Cornbread from this site - just be sure to follow the reviewers suggestions on butter and chilies. Thanks for a great recipe.

Entered this chili in local contest - took best in traditional red chili category. Added 6 cloves garlic, replaced 28 oz. of diced tomatoes with 28 oz. of diced tomatoes with jalapenos, used on 16 oz. hickory brown sugar bbq sauce.  People raved about it!  I couldn't believe it, I'm not into chili.  Also offered sliced jalapenos on the side, and stirred togeter sour cream and chopped cilantro - fantastic!  Our favorite chili now! Thanks, Rick!

Great Chili!  I did what some of the other comments mentioned about using a brown sugar based bbq sauce.  I only used about half of what the recipe called for as far as the chili powder goes.  I knew my 4 year old was going to want some of this, so I was afraid of making it to spicey.  I also just used regular sausage instead of the spicey stuff.  But it was great regardless of the few exceptions that I made.

I made this chili for my son's basketball team & parents- HUGE hit! We froze the leftovers in baggies and have had the greatest dinners! I did cook the meat in the slowcooker with brick chili while I was prepping everything else. Wonderful, Thanks!

Good stuff!  Halved the recipe and it was perfect for 4-6 people and served cornbread with it, which cut down the spicyness some.  Used only half the BBQ sauce as others suggested, but otherwise a very good and hearty meal - definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

I've made a lot of different chili recipes over the years, and this one didn't sound all that fabulous, but I trusted the other reviewers and took a leap of faith. Wow, this is some fine chili! I used 1 lb. hot bulk sausage. I served it at a Halloween party and it got rave reviews. My daughter's boyfriend said it is the best chili he has ever eaten. This  one is in my Recipe Box for keeps!

First off, I am not a huge chili fan.  However, this winter here in Alaska, I was so cold and chili sounded perfect.  I selected this recipe as I am not fan of very spicy food.  THIS WAS AWESOME!  I halved the recipe as it is only my husband and myself.  The only change I made was instead of using kidney beans (another reason I'm not a fan of chili)I put in half black beans (as they are so good for you) and half garbonzo beans.  We both loved this recipe and I make it often.

OK.. I have to admit when I read the ingred. I was a bit skeptical. I mean chocolate!! Come on now!!! And BBQ sauce!!! BUT, there was something inside me telling me to just go for it and to try something new. Hubby BEGGED me to NOT make it. Well I made it and IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!! My 3 yr old and MY HUSBAND tore this stuff up!!! My husband at 2 huge bowls and loved every bite of it. We were all fully satisfied I must say. IT's def. a keeper. Next time I have a family gathering Ill whip this recipe up. I wont tell them about the chocolate though. That'll be our lil secret. ;)

Followed recipe to the letter, and it tasted very very good.  But we like cumin in our chili and just had to add some to taste.  Since the barbeque sauce in that quantity is definitely apparant best to buy an above average barbeque sauce.  However, next time I will use less as it had more barbeque flavor than I am accustomed to with chili.  It was a crowd pleaser for sure and could feed 40 a bowl apiece, we froze leftovers and it is one frozen dinner we look forward to reheating in the future!

I am the Activity Director for 1200 residents at an RV & Golf resort in Arizona.  My staff made this chili recipe on Halloween for 200 residents and the response was unbelievable!  Sometimes it's hard to know what to put into chili when you have an "older" crowd, but this was just the perfect mix of sweet/salty/spicy/YUM!   I recommend this for a family or a big group.  THE WILL LOVE IT.  We served it with cheddar cheese biscuits, cheese & onion on the side. Followed the recipe EXACTLY.

This is great chili! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the tweaks I made.  I added the BBQ sauce to taste and so glad I did bc I only added about 6-8oz and was worried it might overpower.  I used dark and light kidney beans.  I carmalized my onions in the bacon grease.  I also added Sweet Italian sausage in addition to the spicy.  I used 4oz of chocolate instead of 2.  I got 2nd in a very competitive chili cook-off and I'm pretty sure someone licked my crockpot too so I'm calling it a success!

Wonderful!  Try draining the beans and add 2 light beers then simmer for 4 hours before serving.  I actually made it in the morning and simmered all day.  Can't wait to make it again.

We like this recipe when we want to switch things up from the traditional chili.  The chocolate adds a very interesting (but good) flavoring.  It's just not your traditional chili, if that's what you are looking for.  But very good!

This is a terrific chili recipe. I agree with the other reviewers who suggested cutting the barbecue sauce in half, but otherwise I did this recipe precisely as written and it is absolutely wonderful.

This is OK the day it's made, but absolutely spectacular after it's "aged" a bit. Next time I try it, I'll probably use just 3 oz. of chocolate. When I taste-tested, I ended up adding an extra (14.5 oz) can of diced tomatoes to balance out the chocolatey taste.

This is by far, the best tasting chili I have ever had. My husband made it, as is, for a chili cookoff at work. I am having it for lunch, as well. I really don't like chili, but to support him, figured I would try it. I LOVE IT! The chocolate makes the chili very smooth. Great recipe!

Along with other reviewers, I entered this into a chili cook-off and won 2nd prize!  I'm not a huge fan of sausage chili but this was very tasty!  With each bite you get the full sweet and spicy aspect.  Yum!  I did cut the BBQ sauce in half.  I'm not in love with Kraft BBQ sauce so I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar.  I also added a little garlic powder and sauted the onions in the bacon grease.  I let it all simmer for about 2 hours.  I got a ton of compliments!!!  Thanks Rick for a delish chili recipe.

OMG! So amazing.  I thought the chocolate would be gross, but it made the chili so rich and tasty.  The only change I made was to add a tablespoon of peanut butter (my friend who's a chef suggested).  I highly recommend this recipe, try it and you won't be disapointed!

This is insanely good!!!! I had to scale it down some because we are only a family of four. I also used hickory/brown sugar BBQ sauce and cut the amount to use by about 1/3. I think I may have overused the chocolate a bit as I used what was called for in the whole recipe rather than in a scaled down version by accident, but overcompensated with chili powder and cayenne to dummy it down and it went over SO well!!! I will ABSOLUTELY make this again!!!!

I tend to follow recipes very closely.  After reading the many reviews that said to cut back on BBQ sauce, I did.  In fact, I cut in in half.   While I hate to be overly critical,  I thought this was the worst chili I have ever tasted.  The BBQ sauce was OVERWHELMING.  I can't understand how other posts said they won chili cooking awards with this recipe.  I will never make this recipe again.

I picked this recipe because I was entering a chili dish in a contest. I got a lot of votes, but I didn't win! However, this is an easy tasty recipe. I did simmer longer than the recipe called for and I think this helped blend the flavors so that you don't think BBQ when you initially taste the chili.

we had my father over for dinner tonight,and the three of us were quite pleased with the turn out of the chili, however we would change it alittle. besides adding 1 tablespoon more of chili powder this time, we would next time, caramelize the onions before adding them to the chili, we would also season the beef slightly when cooking it before adding it, we felt the it was just to bland compared to the flavors of the bacon and spicy sausage. and last we feel chili beans would give better flavor than kidney beans. but all in all, very tasty and we plan to make it again!

Once again this chili took first place at the super bowl party.  But this year I used "Famous Dave's", "Devil's Spit".  I held the onions, but gave twice as much bacon as the recipe says too.  So, with ought saying it, I obviously won again this year.

This chili is the best - and every time I make chili it's with this recipe. I started doing half a batch just because it makes SO much, and the only changes I make is that I use sweet sausage and to save time I use pre-cooked bacon (I know that's probably a sin).  But I need to go now to the store and get all the ingredients - because this is what I am making for the Superbowl today (2009)! And I'm making it for the Superbowl again this year (2010)!!

I made it for the Superbowl in 2014 and I am making it for the AFC Championship this weekend (Go Pats!!!)

The only chili I will ever make.

I'm afraid this one was lost on me. I made it for a chili contest at work. I made it like the recipe said, but added less BBQ Sauce, and to be honest, was ashamed to serve it. It was so sweet and over powered by the BBQ sauce that it didn't even taste like chili.I tried to doctor it up, but the BBQ just overpowered everything. The really bad part, this recipe makes a boat load of chili. I guess if you like BBQ a lot, you will like this recipe.

Too much time and effort for a too sweet canned taste.  Will not make again.

I hold 2008 version of the "Golden Chili Spoon" traveling award at my work place for this chili recipe.  I did NOT deviate from this recipe.
This truly is a fabulous chili recipe, and is quite hard to beat.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

This chili has excellent flavor and had just the right mixture of sweet and spicy, although I made some modifications to suit my families taste.  I left out the beans since we don't like them, cut back the chili to 1/8 cup so my kids would eat it, and since I did not have BBQ sauce, I just added a little more tomato sauce, some liquid smoke, brown sugar and a few of those other spices we all use to make our own BBQ.   It turned out great - I told my kids it was chocolate chili to get them to try it.  My daughter said It Rocks!

I like spicier chili but other than that it was good. I guess I could've made it spicier myself but I wanted to try the original recipe first.

Very good basic recipe. Here are the changes I made: first, I cut the chili powder to about 1/2. Second I used sweet sausage instead of hot and third, I used tomato puree instead of tomato sauce. I think the bacon and sausage make a big difference and also the unsweetened chocolate. Great flavor. It was easy and really good. I served the chili over pasta. Next time I will try rice. Thanks!.....an update: I won first prize at our Baseball Opening Day Chili Contest this year with this recipe!  Followed the recipe pretty closely except I used turkey sausage (it was on sale) only 3 cans of beans, and maybe 1/3 cup chili powder.  I called it 3M Chile....Three meat Chili or MMM.  Thanks again Rick!

My hubby and I entered this recipe in a chili cookoff yesterday and won in the Most Flavorful catergory.The note enclosed in our winnings said "What a mouth pleaser that was!"Great Job"  We cut back on some of the ingredients and used organic ground bison and swet italian sausage for the meat.One can of black beans and one can of dard red kidney beans..Added one bulb of sliced garlic and 1/4 tsp. of cumin. Cut way back on the chili powder to one tsp. and one cup of the barbeque sauce. We used uncured bacon.Neither one of us had ever made chili before so this was a real thrill to win over almost 20 other entries.

The bacon flavor got lost in the mix, I cut down the BBQ sause and still it was overpowering.  I've made it twice and with some extra tinkering to the recipe it turned out great - less BBQ sause, more liquid - tomatoe juice!

I made this chili the other night with mixed reviews.  I took the suggestions of previous reviews and used the brown sugar BBQ but only 18 ounces.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a tee.  Some of my friends raved about it that it was the best they had ever had, and begged me for the recipe.  My husband said it was unique - not good or bad, just very different in flavor from what he expects from chili.  I tolerated it.  I probably will not use this recipe again.  Based on the results we received, you either love it, or simply tolerate it.

this was awesome- everyone that tried it the first time I made it thought it was the best chili they had ever had. 

now that I have made it 2 times, I would say to downgrade the amount of BBQ sauce and add more tomato sauce. Very, very good

This is the best chili. After reading other comments, I did cut back the bbq sauce. I also cut back on the chili powder, it just seemed to be a little much for my taste. I have made this chili 2 times now, and it disappears fast! Thank you for sharing!

Terrific chili!  Loved everything in it.  Used super flavorful blackforest bacon from Whole Foods, grass feed ground beef, and spicey chicken sausage.  I did cut the bbq sauce back by half and also added half a shiner bock beer.

Another win for Chili Rick's!  My husband and I won by a landslide.  The bbq sauce was halved and we added garlic and starch to thicken a bit.  The chocolate added a really nice touch.

The hubby and I agreed that this tasted more like Cincinnati Chili while it was cooking, so I added a half cup of Coke and a little cinnamon and served it over spaghetti with shredded cheddar and minced red onion.  It's FANTASTIC!   Better than my regular Cincinnati style chili recipe.  I probably would have given this only 3 stars as a "bowl of  chili" (too much BBQ flavor), but this will become a regular at my house over pasta!

I didn't end up adding the barbeque sauce, but did use the chocolate.  I added garlic, jalepeno pepper, along with red, green and yellow peppers and mushrooms.  I used black, kidney and pork & beans (bbq).  For the chili powder I used a mixture of regular, ancho and chilpolte, and I added a bit of hot sauce and cayenne.  I didn't find the bacon added much, so I probably won't use it next time because of the fat content.  I did find that the addition of spicy sausage made the chili really good.  I used ground beef and chicken.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was really delicious.  I made a few changes: I used turkey products and cut it down to 8 servings.  For 8 servings, I added 15 oz of kidney beans and 15 oz of black beans, this total of beans was a little more than called for.  I used half of the bbq sauce called for and this was just bbq-y enough.  I simmered the chili for about 1 hour.  It came out thick and delicious.

This is a great recipe.  We're not huge barbecue sauce fans, so I added a few tablespoons at a time until the flavor felt right (I only used about half of an 18 oz bottle.)  I also added a few vegetables to liven it up - a couple cubed zuchinni, chopped red pepper, can of diced green peppers, and mushrooms.  I like more variety in my beans so I used 2 cans kidney, 2 cans butter (lima) and 1 can great northern.  I cut back the ground beef to just 1 lb.  Everyone said it was a keeper - makes a HUGE amount.

I used turkey sausage/bacon and it didn't miss a beat.  My New Mexico red chili might have helped kick it up a notch too.

I wish I had read to use half the BBQ sauce before I made it!  My husband tasted it and the first thing he said was, "Too much sauce."  But I still liked it, loved all the different meats in it.

I loved this chili.  I also used 1/2 the BBQ sauce.  Insted of 4 cans kidney beans:  I used 1 can kidney, 1 can northern, 1 can black, and one can pinto beans. I will make this again. My picky 7 year old loved it too.

The only chili recipe I use!  My husband loves it!
I do agree with only using half of the BBQ sauce.

Personally, I'd rate it about a 2, but others did enjoy this chili-I would definitely say its a "Man's Chili", and a great tailgating chili.  I was looking for a different chili recipe; this just didn't knock my socks off.  The flavors didn't blend as well as I'd hoped, but the chocolate did seem to deepen the flavors.

I made this recipe exactly how it is.  I won best flavor in a chili cook-off with 15 other entries.  It was gone before I got a taste and everyone raved about it.  Great recipe.

I made this a couple of months ago, but never got around to rating it.  Anyway, best chili I have ever had.  My husband said that after 11 years together that I finally beat his mom's chili!  Wow!  I was very hesitant about this recipe because of some of the ingredients, but it turned out wonderful.  Heats up well for leftovers.  Love this chili.  Thanks so much!

Absolutely awesome Chili.  My Aunt raved about this Chili-she even ate it for breakfast the next day.  I did soften onions prior to placing in pot, used sweet or italian (not hot) sausage, used 1/4 cup of chili powder and I did use an Abuelita Mexican Hot Chocolate tablet and a litte Hersheys cocoa powder-made it perfect. Made another batch which I took to work, and the co-workers were on it like a duck on a junebug.

This chili was okay.  I added cumin also because I thought it needed more and put in about half the barbecue sauce because I thought it was too sweet.  I was hoping it would be awesome as leftovers, and it was fine, but I think I'll keep looking for a good chili recipe.  Thanks!

I made this for a crowd of 17 and it was a perfect amount.  It was universally liked, especially by the teenagers and the men.  Personally I thought the bbq sauce made it a little sweet but I was the only one that thought so.  It had just the right amount of heat.  I made it with turkey bacon, spicy italian turkey sausage and ground turkey and it was great.  The only other change I made was to add a tsp. of ground cumin.  I will make this again.

I made this for my husband;s birthday party last Saturday night. I served 26 people and had rave reviews. I got more than 20 servings from therecipe, but that was fine. We had some leftovers this week. It was the best chili I ever made, beyond a doubt! Just enough heat and faintly sweet because of the BBQ sauce. 

The recipe is not real clear about what to do with the sausage. I wasn't sure whether to use links or just bulk sausage meat. I used two different kinds of spicy link-style sausage - cooked them up and then sliced them thin. Definitely a keeper recipe.

This recipe is great for different flavor... it has a tangy barbeque flavor... I would use a better quality Barbeque sauce next time for a better flavor.

I made this chili yesterday, despite having some reservations about the BBQ sauce, bacon and sausage the recipe called for, which I've never used in chili before.  It turned out fabulous! Thick, rich, lots of flavor. Perfect heat. I followed the recipe pretty closely though I cut it down to10 servings instead of the 20 in the original recipe.  I also cut down on the amount of bbq sauce. I only used about half a cup.  I was afraid the bbq flavor would overpower  the chili flavor.  I used Johnsonville spicy italian sausage, (removed the casings and cut into bite size pieces) and used two 15 oz cans of Bush's chili beans with sauce, (one red and one black bean, one medium spicy and one mild) instead of kidney beans. I also used bittersweet baking chocolate 66% cacao instead of unsweetened chocolate. Oh my goodness -- so good.  I will make this again.

I made this last Saturday NFL Chili Contest and as many others wrote, I too won first prize !!!  I never made chili in my life but read the reviews and decided this was the recipe I'd use.  Thanks everyone.  I used a 1/4C chili powder and 16oz honey barbeque as other's said.  Also no corn in recipe but in the picture so I threw some frozen corn in.  I have a knocked out recipe for corn bread if anyone wants it let me know.

Quick (I didn't know chili could be quick!), easy, delicious. The first time I made it I did find the barbecue sauce flavour to be a little overpowering, so I reduced that to taste the second time I made it. Also added about a teaspoon of cayenne because I just wasn't feeling the spiciness I wanted from the chili powder (probably my fault for using dollar store chili powder). I like recipes that give great results without having to spend all day in the kitchen, and this definitely fits the bill.

My chili has always been awful.  I was looking for a recipe that could redeem me and this one is it.  My husband asks for this chili when the temp starts dipping.  Sometimes I add the full amount of chocolate and sometimes I forget to put it in.  Either way he still loves it. I love the ease.  One little tip is that I use my kitchen shears to cut the bacon into little strips and then cook it.  Start with the bacon just semi frozen.  I find it makes it much easier.

This chili is really tasty. I changed it up a bit, added more italian seasoning, added diced green chilis, added at bit more chili powder and served it with shredded taco cheese, sour cream and shaved chocolate. I may use a little less BBQ sauce next time but it was a hit! Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this was awesome.  My 9 yr old son took one bite and looked at me wide eyed and said this is sooooooooo good Mom!  My whole family loved it.  I didn't use the beans and added a lot less bbq sauce as others did.  I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is the best! I prepared it on Saturday and it turned out great. I did cut the recipe in half because I didn't have a pot that large and even cutting it in half filled a regular pot to the rim. I did add garlic, cumin, red pepper flake and a little salt and pepper. Also I only used 2/3rds of the 18 oz bottle of bbq sauce.  Good stuff.

This is a very good Chili.  I was afraid to use the BBQ sauce so I used about a 1/4 of a 16oz bottle in a skillet with all of the chocolate and then put it in the Chili.  Very Good!

I took the advice of others and changed the BBQ to brown sugar and only half the suggested amount. I took this to a chili cook-off at work and won first place....tripled the votes of the second place person! Since the contest, this has become a family favorite. It freezes well, so I always make a big batch.

Here's the thing....I just made this huge batch of chili, followed the recipe to the tea, and it's not so great.  It tastes like I'm eating bbq sauce.  I'm hoping it will be better tomorrow like others said, but so far, I don't get it!!!!

It is too BBQ-ey.  For a less sweet chili I would recommend using less BBQ sauce.

A very good chili recipe. I followed the instructions however the chili was too sweet with the specified amount of BBQ sauce, so I added more chili powder to compensate. I also left out the chocolate because no one in my family likes mole sauce

This chili was awesome... Only made a few changes...  We used green onion sausage instead of spicy because we have a few toddlers and can't do spicy...  We also added double the onions, only half the BBQ sauce... I can't tell you how good this was..  Anyone who says different is just crazy!  The one pot didn't last but two meals and none to freeze.  Will be making a extra pot just to freeze! Oh yeah and only cost about 30.00 to make!

Finally after 20 years of trying to please my husband with a chili - this was it! I reduced the beans to two cans, one dark and one light red kidney beans, only one cup of BBQ sauce, used ground venison and Tennessee Pride Hot sausage tubes. I used slightly more chili powder to finish off the 2.5 ounce spice bottle and it was perfect. I suggest making this the day before you need it to let the flavors blend together more. YUM! Thanks Rick - who knows maybe I'll enter a chili contest like the others :)

I absolutely luv this recipe. I was craving chilibeans and came across this recipe. I thought it was a little weird at first because of the ingredients, but it is YUMMY. We fight over who gets the last bowl. I have made it a few times, and it's always just as good!!

I'm afraid I'll be the decenting voice here. We didn't like this at all. My family kept saying it smelled like I was making BBQ sauce and it tasted like it.  I didn't add the sausage, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Think I'll stick to my standby.  Thanks anyway.

All the reviews were right about cutting the barbeque sauce by 1/3.  It just didn't have the chili kick to it.  I even tried using jalapenos with the diced tomatoes to give it a kick the secibd time I made it but there was still something missing.  I used venison instead of ground beef the second time. I think it turned out a little better but the kick is definitely missing.  I liked the recipe because it was easy to make but I'll still play around with it to achieve perfection.

I added a pinch of Paprika to this recipe, I cooked it on the stove and then let it cook in the crock pot over night and added 2 large (can) Jalapenos. I only used 1/3 of the BBQ sauce and 1/2 the Chocolate but I won FIRST place in a chili cook off! It was so good. I would reccomend this to anyone! Thanks =)

I made this for a small group chili cookoff. It did not impress our group, although I thought it was very good. I ended up using a bit more than half of the BBQ sauce suggested.

After entering our annual friends chilli cook off for ten years and losing this was my last enter!  I won.  This receipe sounds different but the favors blend together well.  I increased the diced tomatoes by one can added garlic powder, cumin, dash cinnamon and oregon.  Wow what a taste.  My friends are dying for the recipe but it will remind my little secret.

I pulled this recipe off the website and made it for a chili contest.  I won the prize for "Tastiest" chili.  The only thing I changed was I cut the bbq sauce by about 1/3.

This went over great, everyone loved it!  Multiple helpings were had, yummy sounds were made and leftovers were packed home.  By the way, this feeds an army, I ended up making this in my stock pot, barely.  It never really registered exactly how much I was making til I saw all the ingredients in one place.  In the future I'll halve or quarter the recipe.  Even with 9 people, 2nds and thirds and leftovers I still ate chili for 3 days.  Don't forget the corn bread.

Pretty good. Way too much chili powder! :) I used turkey substitutes and could not tell, but I know that probably will ruin osme people's chili. Also, I did not have any BBQ sauce, so I made one called "Simple BBQ Sauce" from this website. One last thing, I did not have any unsweetened chocolate, so I used some Hershey's Syrup, haha, I am not sure if it helped, but it did not worsen it.

Very good! I don't like chili and I even ate some of this.  I read some of the other reviews and used only 1/2 the amount of bbq sauce it called for and it was perfect. I also decreased the amount of beans and didn't used any Italian seasoning (I used my own). This makes a fairly large pot...so make sure you use a big enough stock pot when you begin.

Following some suggestions here, I varied from the recipe a bit.  I don't like really spicy chili so I went with regular sausage instead of the spicy.  I also followed other reviewer's suggestions to cut the BBQ sauce.  Unfortunately, that left my chili somewhat bland.  It was still darn good, though.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll go for the spicier sausage and maybe a bit more chili powder.  I used a little less than half the recommended hickory BBQ sauce and it added just the right amount of hickory flavor without tasting like BBQ sauce.  Very good!

I made this recipe for a large ski group.  I left out the bbq sauce, but did everything else.  I got tons of compliments, but the best compliment of all was that out of 22 servings, only a small bowl was left over and that got eaten the next day!

This recipe makes a huge amount of chili! Even after I cut the bbq sauce in half, like others suggested, it still seemed too much. I picked the one with the lowest amount of sugar on it and I wish that maybe I only put in a 1/4 the suggested amount. I suggest going a little bit at a time and adjusting the recipe. I had to doctor this up quite a bit to get rid of the sweet over powering bbq sauce flavor. None of the bacon flavor came through.  I cooked it for about 5 hours and it had a nice consistency, but I don't think I would bother with this recipe again.

I'm not a big fan of chili and I wanted to make some for a family chili cookoff coming up. I've always had a talent to look at a recipie and know whether it'll be tasty or not. When I saw this one it caught my eye and i thought i was losing it, Chocolate? I halved the recipie and made some for my husband and I and loved it. We ate all of it in 2 days. The changes I made were I added some cumin powder and halfed the BBQ sauce and then halfed the whole recipie. I LOVED IT!

Very, very good. I added three cloves of minced garlic, and 1/2 tsp. more italian seasoning than it called for. Need to serve with sour cream, as it is very hot! 

Only use 1 lb. of ground beef. 

1/4 cup of chili powder was good, but makes it very spicy. Could be less.

Only used 1/4 bottle of BBQ sauce.

I wanted to make a "different" chili.  Since I love barbeque sauce, I thought this would be the perfect recipe to try.  Wow!  It made a lot - too much for my huge crockpot!  (I had to transfer it to my canning pot.)  Then again, I wanted leftovers to freeze for my lunch in the coming months.  As for the taste, it is delicious.  I only gave it four stars, though, because I think you could use a half-cup less of barbeque sauce and get an even better result.  It was just a little overwhelming, even for a barbeque sauce fan.  All in all, though, a great recipe and one that I will be making again.

I've never made chili before.  Decided to give this recipe a try for a gathering at my house recently.  Very easy to make, by the way.  Received rave reviews too.  I cut the amount of beans from 4 cans to 2 cans so I could easilly pick them out (NOT a bean fan).  Highly recommend this recipe for convenience (makes a huge pot) and guaranteed results.  Yum!

I love this chili recipe. Won a chili cook-off with it. I added minced garlic and Trader Joe's roasted corn. I substituted pork n beans for the kidney beans. As others have said, the right BBQ sauce is a key.

I have made this several times and love it.  I do switch out the typical BBQ sauce and use Famous Daves Devils Spit.   I also use some great northern beans as well as the kidney beans.  I love making this recipe.

This is a great award-winning recipe. How can you lose with three meats and chocolate? I personalize mine with a few delicious modifications. First I cook a 3 lb roast in red wine in the slow cooker overnight instead of ground beef. Makes amazing shredded beef for any use. I use chorizo for the sausage and baked bacon ends and pieces, chopped up for more noticeable chunks of bacon. I add a green pepper for color variety and texture and my (no longer) secret is a hint of maple syrup. There you have it. Two first places and one “Maverick” award. Add a good name with the word ‘chocolate’ in it to seal the deal!

This chili is flavorful and easy to make. I think that the best parts of this recipe are the three meats, BBQ sauce and chocolate. I served it to a discriminate group of foodie friends who all said it was really good. Maybe they were just being polite but there was none left at the end of the night. My husband said he wanted it to be saltier.

Best chili ever!  Changes I made:  1/2 dark chili beans and half light, and I used 1/2 the barbecue sauce as others recommended.  (Sweet Baby Rays) Not the typical chili taste that people expect. Excellent.

I make this chili at least twice a winter. It is AMAZING! I added pulled pork to it as well- vegetarians stay away!  I make a huge pot and freeze a bunch of bags so we can enjoy it over and over.  In fact today is probably the last rainy day here in Nor Cal so we are going to eat the last bag from the freezer tonight and I can hardly wait!  I serve with Fritos, sour cream and cheese. Yummy!!

I tied for 1st in a chili cook-off with this recipe.  The chocolate adds a nice smoothness and the sausage brings out the meaty flavor.  To me, this is a chili that the longer it simmers (on low in a crockpot after cooked) the better it gets.  The only tweaks I made - I used Dr. Pepper Bar B Q sauce instead of Kraft and added some cinnamon to help the chocolate out.

I've made this many times. Although my husband and I don't usually like chili, we like this recipe. The chocolate rounds out the flavors and with the sausage you can control the heat. We don't care for spicy, so  have done one pound of spicy sausage and one of regular. It's just a tiny bit of zip and the kids tolerate it much better. As many of the other reviewers recommend, half the amount of barbecue sauce. Otherwise the flavor is overwhelming. It's also helpful to remember that the quality of the barbecue sauce, the bacon, tomato sauce, chocolate, etc. can have a major impact on the overall product. Every brand of Italian Seasoning will be a different blend of spices and different ratios. Some have salt and others don't. Every brand of sausage will have a different flavor. Ditto for the bacon and the barbecue sauce. I always splurge for the best barbecue sauce and I'm never sorry. I have also sometimes added a tiny bit of liquid smoke. I love this recipe!

Made this 2 years in a row at our neighborhood Halloween party and it was a crowd favorite for sure.
I reduced the amount of  ground beef to 2 lbs. and used a honey bbq instead, but other wise followed the directions.

I made this for a chili cook off at culinary school. I followed the recipe but also the reviews for less BBQ sauce and a lil brown sugar. Also followed a review for using a little of the chocolate as a garnish... That was the only mistake. Gives the dish a slightly unpleasant bitterness.

This chilli is amazing just the way it is, or with some added heat. Its so good, a dinner guest once ate their finger after dipping it in for a taste. Ok, I'm embellishing a bit, but it is really really good.

My husband works 12 hour days and takes this for lunch every day.  We divide it up into meals and freeze them and he just pops one into his lunch box in the morning and microwaves it for lunch.  We did make a few changes.  He uses Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce.  And he doubles the chili powder and adds tobasco hot sauce.  We also double the bacon!  It is a great recipe and allows for the ability to adjust the taste to suit whoever is eating it!

Wow! I've never made great chili, so when my hubby entered his new business in our local school's (where I happen to teach) Homecoming Tailgate Chili Cook-Off, I wasn't pleased.  I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. You can add another 1st place trophy to your growing collection of fan wins, Rick!  I did cut the BBQ sauce down a little and I only had 1# of spicy sausage, but it was perfect.  The only thing I'd like to change is the prep time. It took me about 50 minutes to get all of the ingredients simmering in the pot.  Thanks Rick! Love, love, love the flavor.

It was a big hit.  I agree with the rest of the reviews, next time I will cut back on the BBQ sauce.

The worst thing I ever did in the kitchen was made this chili for a friends house warming party, everybody's been hounding me for it ever since. More than a few have called it the best chili they,ve  ever had. I agree, this stuff is delicious.
Cheers

This is an excellent recipe. I've made it a couple times a year for a while now. I tweaked it a little. I use Pizza seasoning in rge place of Italian seasoning and added 2 Tbs. of Cajun seasoning. I make my own BBQ sauce so I used that it's a sweet and spicy sauce. I use 1 lb ground sweet italian sausage and 1 lb ground hot italian.

This is my favorite chili to make. I am usually not cooking for a crowd, so I halve it when I make it, and have leftovers for a while. I don't find it too sweet, but I also don't use hickory BBQ sauce as recommended.  I live in Kansas City, a local BBQ joint mecca, so I use locally-produced Arthur Bryant's sauce when I make it, which is unlike most mass-produced sauces, and not at all sweet.  It's an acidic, vinegar-y/peppery sauce with bite. I also slightly decrease the chili powder, because of the bite you get with Bryant's sauce.  I sometimes use tomatoes with diced jalapenos (RoTel-style), as well.

I used this in my first chili cookoff-  I won my category!  :)  I tweaked it a bit...added a little brown sugar and a little less bbq sauce.  Also I added 1 1/2 oz of unsweetened chocolate to the recipe.  It was AMAZING!  Going for win #2 today.  :)

Thank you!

I omitted the bacon and added some dried cumin. This is some of the best Chili I have ever had. The chocolate with the chili powder is just such a great suprise.

I made this chili for my boyfriend and my roommates and it was a huge hit! A few changes were made, but nothing huge.  As recommended, I used Brown Sugar BBQ sauce and cut it down to half the amount. I also did not use sausage because I couldn't find the kind I wanted at the store. I added one red and one green pepper, diced. A little bit of garlic and cayenne pepper and voila! This recipe was delicious and I am excited to be eating the leftovers for a few days!

Excellent recipe.  I halved the recipe and used just a few squirts of barbecue sauce.  Excellent chili.  I also used 1 can of the kidney beans and 1 can of black beans in lime juice with jalapenos.

My husband and mom said this was the best chili they've ever had!  They are both pretty picky about their chili too.  I took the advice of others and only added half the bbq sauce.  I will for sure make this one again!!!!!!

This was yummy yummy.  We cut back on the meat and only used 1lb of the sausage and 1lb of the hamburger meat.  Also followed another readers suggestion for the cilantro sour cream which was really good.  Great recipe and very easy.

I halfed the BBQ sauce and it was still way too much. It didn't really taste like chili.  It was pretty good until I added the BBQ sauce.  Sorry I don't think I will use this recipe again.

The family liked this recipe.  Next time I will decrease the BBQ sauce slightly & add some more spices that will heat it up just a tad more.  
We also added sour cream & cheddar chesse to top it off.
