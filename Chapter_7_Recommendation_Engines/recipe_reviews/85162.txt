Sorry.  Have to disagree with a lot of reviewers.  This was overspiced and way too sweet for us.  We live in Tex Mex country and love our spice, but this entire blend of dried herbs thrown in was too overpowering. We will stick with our tried and true recipe that is more tomato and onion based.

too much pepper? are you crazy?? this is the best meatloaf!! quite tasty. the only change I made is that I reduced the brown sugar to 2 Tablespoons instead of 1/4 cup- the first time I did made it exactly and found it a bit too sweet, last night I made it again but with the reduced amount of brown sugar- and it was perfect! I want to thank you for sharing this recipe!! it is the now the meatloaf by which all other meatloafs will be measured.

Well... I ended up making this meatloaf at the last minute and changed quite a bit due to what I had in my kitchen and It was still a hit!!!

First off, I doubled the recipe because I had 2.lbs of ground beef, I didn't have any bell pepper or celery, 

Here are my Substitutions:
~2 eggs for eggbeaters
~1/4 cup soy sauce for 1/4 worcestershire
~Dried basil/parsley/oregano/ for meatload seasoning mix
~garlic powder for garlic salt
ADDED:
~1 beef boullion cube
1tbsp of liquid smoke to loaf.

For sauce: I also reduced the brown sugar to 2tbsp  I also doubled the sauce and glazed twice while baking and was perfect. Because it was a 2.lb loaf I baked at 375 for 1hr 15-30min.  It turned out very good and didn't fall apart.  I want to try this next time with ground turkey...Yummy!!!

Edible. Might have given this 3 stars on taste and texture as it was spicy and moist but the presentation was unimpressive - looked like baked dog food and the recipe required a whole lot more prep than the finished product warranted.

it was good but very spicy and the taste of all those dried herbs was overpowering. I won't make it again this way.

Made the meatloaf itself, but without the glaze on top.  (Served it with tomato gravy instead)   Needed another egg to hold it together better, but had a fabulous flavor that my entire family enjoyed. Will make this again.

Mmmmm, I just finished off the leftovers for lunch.  Very good, even my picky daughter liked it.  I thought my son would love it but he was upset by the veggies showing so I will chop them smaller in the food processor next time.  I also only had one egg and doubled the recipe but loved it even though it fell apart!  I did cut the sugar in half and used half yellow mustard instead of all brown just for kid appeal. Thanks!

The Family loved this meatloaf!!! Amazing! I followed the whole recipe, with just one change from other chefs feedback, I used 2 TBSP brown sugar rather than 1/4 cup. It was a so tasty! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Perfect for those who dont want a pound of tomato sauce with thier meatloaf. I didnt care too much for the topping on the meatloaf though and next time would leave it off. The meatloaf itself was quite delicious though. My family thinks my normal meatloaf is the best but this came in a close second. I will use this recipe when in the mood for something different than my normal meatloaf recipe

This meatloaf was different but delicious. I didn't have liquid smoke but I will make it again and add it next time. I also thought the amount of spices was excessive and cut way back. I couldn't imagine biting into something with that amount of dried herbs in it -- or that much black pepper.

I liked the recipe, but made some changes.  I used three different colors of bell peppers for color and presentation.  Also, I used bread crumbs instead of oatmeal... and the only herb I used was parsley.

I didn't make the sauce for the topping because it seemed entirely too sweet for meatloaf!

I loved it!

I have always made meatloaf the old boring way, oatmeal, green pepper, stewed tomatos, garlic and salt and pepper. Let me just say that this recipe has to be the best meatloaf I have EVER had. It does have a little hint of sweetness due to the brown sugar but is offset by the mustard. This is a must try! I will never make meatloaf any other way. I did however have a little trouble with it keeping together like the picture shows.( I probably added to much oats) this is fantastic!

very good! I didn't measure the veggies so not sure if added what was posted but it was great. As for the sauce I didn't make it since I had honey BBQ sauce which was awesome on top! I wanted to get rid of stuff in my pantry.

The oats do not add any flavor, and make the meatloaf mushy.  Try substituting club crackers, finely ground.  They will also add a slight buttery taste.

Maybe it's a matter of taste, but this recipe has too much black ground pepper in my opinion. 2 teaspoons in the loaf and another 1/2 teaspoon in the topping. It's very peppery.

i was looking for something to make with the lb. of ground turkey in our freezer and decided to try it as a substitute for beef in this recipe.  the results were very tasty.  i'm not a meatloaf fan usually, because my mother's growing up was incredibly bland.  this recipe, however, is not!  like some said, there are large amounts of dried spices which yield a strong flavor, but i enjoyed it.  i was short on time so skipped the homemade brown sugar/ketchup glaze and just poured some stubb's BBQ sauce on top and sprinkled a bit of paprika over that.  both my husband and i were pleased with the moist texture and taste.  might be too peppery/pungent for my 2 year old, though.  we'll see!

After losing my recipes, I was looking to replace a traditional meatloaf recipe.  This isn't quite what I was looking for, but it's delicious and wouldn't go back to "traditional" for anything!

I used what I had, so I substituted a couple ingredients (bread crumbs for oatmeal, yellow bell pepper instead of celery). I liked the flavor of the meatloaf itself, but I do have to agree that there is too much pepper in the sauce on top. Next time I'll use 1/4 the amount of pepper in the sauce. Mine did turn out a little crumbly as well. But that could be the result of using breadcrumbs instead of the oatmeal. Overall, a good meatloaf, not the best I've had, but good.

Sounded better than it was.  I'll keep searching for another meatloaf.  Can't put my finger on what was wrong with it.  Maybe all the flavors just didn't blend.

Absolutely the best meatloaf recipe ever! I substitute the beef for ground turkey and like another reviewer also use a trio of bell peppers. I use far less oregano as it's a personal taste thing but would recommend making the topping as it adds a nice, sweet and smokey flavor.

We thought this was very good, but I too felt that some of the herbs were a little much for only one pound of meat; particularly the oregano and the basil. If I had used fresh herbs, it most likely would have been fine. I cut back on the two even tho I used two pounds of ground turkey. I like a lot of sauce, so I used two cups of catsup and cut back on the sugar being that catsup is pretty sweet on its own. While cooking, I added some chicken broth to the bottom of the dish so that the sauce wouldn't burn. It actually made a really nice gravy after I thickened it with a little cornstarch and water. Served this with a big green salad, mashed potatoes, baby peas and creamed corn. The perfect ending for an unusually chilly, raw and very damp NJ day. Thanks so much ValKaryn!

Awesome meatloaf. We've never used oats before. We also added some italian bread crumbs since you can never buy a pound of ground beef it seems and its always over. My husband also added a little barbeque sauce with the topping (because he cant leave well enough alone LOL) I tried it with the BBQ sauce and with out and it was both really good. Awesome with the red onions too. I'll definatley make again!

We didn't like this at all!  Very "herby" and too much garlic (didn't thing there could be too much but this sure had too much)!  We won't be making this again.  Sorry!

Very delicious, though I did have to make amends for what was in my kitchen! I used yellow onion and red bell pepper. Didn't have celery, so did about a tbsp or so of dried celery flakes. I didn't have enough ketchup, so I thought I'd use BBQ sauce for the rest, but then I didn't have enough of that either, so ended up finishing off the 1/3 cup + 1/4 cup with the end of a bottle of 57 sauce, and even then it wasn't quite enough. I still had enough sauce to cover the loaf. Didn't have liquid smoke, but I think the BBQ and 57 sauces made up for it. I used about 2/3 cup of the oats. When it came out of the oven, I thought it was really crumbly, but then I realized that I had forgotten the eggs! So with the eggs, the full cup of oats probably would have been fine. Overall though, this was really tasty and we ate it with corn on the cob.

This is probably one of the best meatloaf recipes I've tried. There was a lot of flavor, it was nice and moist, and it was actually sliceable. The only things I did differently was to use an Italian herb seasoning, and regular liquid smoke. Good stuff. Thanks!

This was pretty good. I made only a few changes...yellow onion instead of red, BBQ sauce instead of liquid smoke, no mustard and no pepper. Hearty and filling but not really anything out of the ordinary.

Great meatloaf recipe. My husband is not a big fan of meatloaf but he really enjoyed this one, stating it was the best meatloaf he had ever tasted. I did cut the ground pepper to one teaspoon in the meatloaf as suggested by other reviewers but I am not sure that it was necessary. I also omitted the mustard in the glaze due to allergies and decreased the brown sugar to 2 tbsp as suggestted by another reviewer. very good flavor.

The best meatloaf!  I've always used my mom's recipe, which is similar, but this one is better.  I didn't have celery, so I subbed with red bell pepper.

This is my go to Meat Loaf, I love it. It is so full of veggies that I don't have to make a salad if I don't want to.  

Tonight I am going to add some feta cheese to the meat loaf for my cal. I Love FETA too.

I love the sauce on top of this meatloaf. Mine took WAY longer to cook than was specified (over an hour longer!).

This was an awesome meatloaf recipe--with a few changes.  I agree with many of the cooks in that there was too much spice.  I added 1/2 tsp. of oregeno and basil respectively (I didn't have parsley on hand).  I also added 1/2 tsp of dry mustard and about a tsp of worcheshire sauce.  I used 1 tsp of pepper and garlic salt (instead of powder)  I also subsituted bread crumbs for the oats. In terms of veggies, I added 2 cloves of garlic and an orange pepper instead of green (didn't have green on hand).  

For the sauce, I reduced the brown sugar to 1 tbsp. --that's plenty and I added a few drops of worechesire sauce.  I used regular French's mustard and instead of liquid smoke--club house spicy hickory rub/marinade.  With these alterations, the meatloaf was delicious.

This was really good, my husband loved it and so did the older kids who usually don't like meatloaf. The younger kids didn't like the sauce on the top because they said it was spicey. This was my first successful meatloaf and it turned out great. Like some other reviewers I cut down on a few herbs and used a little less brown sugar, all in a really easy and tasty!

This recipe is excellent! My husband said it was the best meatloaf he's ever had, and couldn't stop eating it! I agree. It is very tasty and moist. And I love the sauce that goes over it. 

Some things I did different, like another reviewer suggested, I reduced the brown sugar to 2 TBS. perfect. not too sweet at all. Just really flavorful and delicious.

Also, another reviewer stated there were too much dried spices involved, and pepper, these I just "eyeballed" to see how much looked right. And it turned out perfect! Just enough spice and herbs so they added flavor but not overpowering. 

Overall I love this recipe and so glad I found it! Thanks!

Very tasty, I've never before made meatloaf with this many veggies...IMO the glaze is the best part, the liquid smoke adds a good flavor to it...I felt the spices were a bit too much so I held back a bit on the oregano, black pepper and garlic powder...will definitely make this again

Loved, loved it! I read the reviews and cut down on the herbs and the brown sugar. I added a little bit more soy sauce. My husband got home and said whatever I was making smelled really good! I knew then that I had a winner! ( oh, I glazed it with ketchup only)

I am the queen of improvising ingredients sometimes they work sometimes not so much, I am always looking for a easy and tasty meatloaf recipe and this one was a great start, but as usual I never have all the ingredients, I am curious if anyone improvises like I do and if others think it is as tasty as I found it, I didn't have any fresh veggies and I don't like just plain ketcup so I used the bold sloppy Joe sauce, I doubled the meat so added half of a can to the meat and saved the rest for the glaze. I didn't add any brown sugar because of the sweetness of the sauce, I also didn't have any oats but I did have some cheese flavoured crackers, I also added a little Worchestershire sauce.  Everything else followed to the Tee. My family rated it among one of the best meatloves I have made.
