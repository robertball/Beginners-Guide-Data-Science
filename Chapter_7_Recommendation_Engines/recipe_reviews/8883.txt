This is one of the best grilled chicken recipes I have ever tasted. I marinated boneless/skinless breasts for 6 hours. The taste was outstanding and the chicken stayed very moist. Make sure you grill on low/medium heat. Around 25 minutes total.

I par boil my chicken (I do this so I am sure the chicken gets done completely on the grill without taking a lot of time)  the night before I want to use it, cool it and then marinated in overnight.  It was awesome.  The chicken was so tender and the skin browned to perfection.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

The chicken was yummy. Even the kids loved it. I did not marinade it for the full length of time so it lacked in flavor but I be it would be fantastic if it marinaded the full time according to the recipie.

Seriously EASY recipe!!! Gets bonus points for that!!! I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also used Diet Sierra Mist (I might try it with ginger ale once) if I have it on hand. I also reduced the soy sauce to about 1/2 cup and added some McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning to it. Kids and adults ate it up!!! Great recipe!!

This is the seriously the best chicken ever! We had this growing up all the time at parties and everybody asked us for the recipe. It is so easy and nobody can believe the simple and unusual ingredients. You can reduce the oil to 1/2 cup.

I made this for a group of 20 and they all loved this recipe. I used chicken breast with the skin no bone and leg quarter w/bone. I marinade it for 3 days and partially cooked the leg quarters 1 day before so I wouldn't have to spend all my time BBQ. It turned out fantastic and would make this again.

Marinated my boneless, skinless chicken breasts for nearly 24 hours. The smell was wonderful coming off of the grill. The flavor was in the chicken but it wasn't as strong as I had hoped for, that's why I am only giving this a four-star rating.

This didn't do much to enhance the chicken.  Not as great as I thought it might have been considering the preparation time necessary to make it happen.

This is great!  I marinated the chicken all day and it tasted wonderful.  Nothing overpowering - just nice flavor and very moist chicken.  I highly recommend this!

By far the most outstanding, moist chicken that will ever come off the BBQ.  Don't be worried about the soy sauce - it goes with ANYTHING - people have no idea what I used to make it - they love it!

I was very unsure at first.  The smell was not appealing.  But I figured I would try it anyways.  I let is sit overnight (24 hours).  We grilled the chicken and it did burn.  But even burnt a little the chicken was still juicy and tasted SO GOOD.  I was very impressed.  But the way I knew it was a hit is that even my Cat wanted it.  Sometimes but very rarely will he want or even eat our food.  But that chicken he was begging for he ate a whole piece all on his own.

Not a ton of flavor. Perhaps it needs to marinate for 2-3 days.

100% satisfied, I prepared this for a large group and wasn't very hard to make and everyone loved it. I doubled the marinade to make sure that all the chicken breast were thoughly soaked. I will be making this again.

Not an overpowering flavor but nice and subtle, allowing for lots of different flavors in side dishes as it goes with everything. I used Sprite and 7-Up, cut waaaay down on the oil, used a soy sauce/teriyaki mix and grilled on my Foreman. Perfect week night dinner and the BF is looking forward to the last piece for lunch tomorrow.

This was a really good recipe. I didn't marinate them for the full amount of time but they still turned out good. We just basted with extra sauce we had. Thanks for a yummy recipe.

This is delicious!  My family loved it!  I marinated boneless, skinless chicken thighs for 18 hours and used only about two tablespoons of oil--the rest exactly by the recipe.  Loved it!  Thanks Mary!

We only had time to marinate for a few hours, but it still tasted great. I cooked it on our indoor grill. Very juicy and lots of flavour.

We used this marinade recipe exactly as outlined for our 'end-of-summer' BBQ and it was a hit!
The chicken was extremely most and the exterior did not carmelize while cooking.
Would recommend this recipe and will definitely use it again.

Easy chicken to feed a crowd!  Cut the oil in half - chicken is still moist and flavourful.  I marinated boneless breasts and thighs for 7 hours and basted liberally while grilling on low.  Served with bread and salads it was devoured!

This was unusually good! I say "unusually good" because I could actually TASTE the marinade quite distinctly... And it was all the recipe promised. I used bone in thighs (which is what I had on hand) and let them marinade for a 6 hours or so. I'll definitely make this recipe again and will probably use the marinade on other meats.

Great base but needed a lot more in my opinion. Once we added some 21 season salute (while it marinated) and coated it with Jack Daniels BBQ sauce right before pulling it off the grill - loved it!

I did not have enough time to marinate the chicken for 9 hours but it still came out great.  I do recommend boiling the chicken before marinating them so that you dont have the problem of having raw chicken on the inside.  This also helped the chicken absorb the flavor of the marinade.  I will repeat this recipe when we have another bbq!
