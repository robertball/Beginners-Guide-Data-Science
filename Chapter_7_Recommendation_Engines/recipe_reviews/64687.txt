I did alot of subsituting on this , but it was great I use real eggs (1 egg to each tortillia) milk (or evaporated milk) your favorite cheese (mine is the pizza blend (cheddermozzorella mix) and since the kids don't like onions I use onion powderor salt also if you like substatute the sausage with ham, bacon hot dogs or any meat you like. I've been making this for the kids for years and they love it.(even before I saw this recipe). ENJOY!!!!

The problem I had with this recipe is the Boca product. It's much better with the Morningstar Farms brand sausage pattie; then it was a 5-star recipe for me.

I make a triple batch, add low-fat cheese,  sautee the onions with red peppers, and add some hash browns.
 I roll them all up, wrap them in foil, and microwave them in the morning on my way out the door.
