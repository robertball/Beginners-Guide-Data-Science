Quick and easy for a weeknight meal! I cut the recipe in half and grilled the sausage instead. I pan fried the onions and peppers in a littled olive oil and some Italian herbs along with a splash of wine. I did cheat and used a jar of Classico Marinara sauce (sorry Prego) that I doctored up a bit. We served this with some Parmesan and Romano cheeses, nice Italian bread and of course wine!

I tripled this recipe for a communion party.  I made it the day before and then reheated it.  It was excellent and I received many compliments on it.  Quick and easy.

yum yum yummmm.... BUT I HAD to cheat the recipe.  My husband wanted me to make a sausage sammy for him, but he bought only already cooked spicy chicken sausage... STILL, with already prepared sausage and 1/2 the cooking time, it was delicious.  Very little ingredients made for a fabulous sammy.  :o)

I'm giving this 5 stars WITH some modifications. No need to slice the sausage, save time and leave it whole. I did flip half way thru so it would get brown on both sides. I also drained and blotted up all the grease. I skipped the sauce and added pepper, garlic salt and onion powder. Next time I will add the veggies a little later. They became too soft and melted down to almost nothing. Overall a biG time saver when feeding a crowd.

Loved this.  Added more onion and three different colored peppers.  I also used whatever spaghetti sauce I had on hand.  Serve it on spaghetti or buns.  It's very good.

I made this to bring to my sister's house for Christmas eve - she was having lasagna and it seemed like a good side dish. Everyone thought it was delicious!!   I made it again a couple of days later with hot Italian sausage instead of sweet.  It was equally good, and a matter of personal preference as to using either type of sausage.  I reduced the oven temp to 400 degrees - my oven tends to run hot, and I like the peppers a little on the firm side.

I've tried so many more complex sausage & pepps recipes and still go back to this one all the time.  Simple & easy and still phenominal.  Though i add 2 tsp of Siracha hot sauce.  I must have had at least 10 people ask me for the recipe.

This was great.  I use all hot sausage because I prefer it over sweet.  I used just the sausage and peppers part since I was serving over pasta.  I did everything except I only added peppers and onions for last 25 minutes of cooking and they were perfect (soft but still had a tiny crunch).  If the veggies had been in there for the entire 45 minutes they would have been completely soft and flimsy and I don't like them that overcooked.  Turned out fabulous!

These sandwiches were soooo good! I cut the recipe in half since it was just my husband and. I also made a very easy marinara sauce from this site instead of jarred sauce. It is called 'Chunky Marinara Sauce'. It went along perfectly with this recipe! I will make this again for sure :).

we LOVE this recipe! We use the Chunky Marinara recipe and the French bread Rolls to Die For from this site. It is a super crowd pleaser at my house. Friday nights are even happier with this recipe on hand.

Made this and served it over spaghetti instead of as a sandwich. The cooking times were a little off, but I kept an eye on it and it was delicious!

I have made this once and will defiantly make it again. The only thing I will do different is leave the sausage whole instead of cutting it and I added a bit of red wine to the sauce. So delicious and super easy!! Great for a weeknight.

I used homemade sauce and sausages.  Once the sausages browned I put everything into the crockpot and let it simmer all day.  I served on my own crusty rolls recipe.  Once I placed the sausage and peppers on the roll I put a slice of Provolone cheese on top and one on the plain side of the roll.  I broiled until the cheese was brown and bubbly, put the sandwich together and enjoyed! I used red and green peppers and an equal amount of onions.  I had mushrooms that needed using up and put them in there too.  Will try adding zucchini next time.  Great recipe you can play around with!
