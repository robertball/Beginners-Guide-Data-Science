I have made a lot of cakes in my lifetime and this is the worse  I have ever made
whome ever submitted this needs to take it out of there.
Even the frosting is terrible.  I would not recommend anyone try this one.

its a very flavour less cake so i would change the coconuts for fruit which suits you and for the frosting i would put chocolate instead for coconut flakes
