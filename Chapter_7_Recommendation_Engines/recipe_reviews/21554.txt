This recipe was great. I made it for Easter breakfast and it was a big hit! I did change the recipe a little...used 12 eggs, 1 lb. of sage sausage, and I chopped up 1 large green bell pepper and 1/2 a large onion and sauted them instead of using the green onions, mushrooms, and canned peppers. I also used 8 oz. of shredded sharp cheddar instead of the 16 oz. of jack cheese after reading the reviews that it was too cheesy. I used a pastry cutter to combine the flour mixture to make sure it wasn't lumpy, and it turned out wonderful! I'll definitely use this again. Thank you!!

My priority was trying to find a "do-ahead" egg recipe, the night before--that DIDN'T have bread in it (as my other entree dish was eggnog french toast w/ cranberries and apples...we Certainly didn't need more bread!!) I made this sausage egg casserole for a large Christmas brunch--and it was "rated" by 10 people of various ages, 12 to 80.  Everyone Raved about it  - the flavors were wonderful!! And... everyone wants the recipe - which to me, is the HIGHEST compliment ~ Thanks Linda, for sharing!!

This is insanely good.  didn't make it low fat, but would try cause I can imagine it would still be good.  used whole 16 oz. ground breakfast sausage.  had to replace 1 can of jalapenos for 1 can of chilies (still good with a little kick-I didn't mind).  looked weird adding the crumbles of the flour to the egg mixture but once it baked up, it was very good.  husband asked if there were biscuits in it. make sure you let it sit for 10 minutes or else it'll be too loose and hard to dish out.  I also did let mine bake for maybe 10 minutes more cause it's had no browning on top after first 50 minutes.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have done it with and without the flour mixture and I personally preferred it without the flour.  You can also put these in a muffin tin for individual servings, just bake 20-30 minutes instead.

This is a great make ahead breakfast casserole.  I cut the recipe in half.  If you do this make sure you use a large enough dish so it will cook within the 40 - 50 minutes.  The first time I made it I used a smaller dish and it was too thick to cook through.  This also reheats well for leftovers.

This egg casserole is absolutely delicious and easy to prepare.  I have made it twice.  The taste reminds me of a light and fluffy souffle.  I omitted the peppers, because my family does not like spicy food.  Both times I prepared it I halved the recipe, and it still comes out beautifully.  The second time was for company so even though it was a half recipe, I still used 3/4 lb sausage and the full amount of green onions - for maximum flavor.  I did use 6 eggs - in the "half" recipe while using the full amount of green onion and sausage.

Periodically Hubby and I like this type of thing for dinner, so I pretty much divided this recipe by 4 to make 2 good size servings.  It was SUPER GOOD, even though I could only refrigerate it for about 3 hours.  For my 1/4 recipe I diced 3 oz. of fully cooked Polish sausage and fried it until it was almost done.  Then I stirred in 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper, 3 sliced green onions, and the 2 oz. of mushrooms, and cooked it all until the veggies were tender.  I did use 3 eggs, to which I added 2 small squirts of Oriental hot chile sauce.  Cut the shredded cheese back to 3-1/2 oz. because I used extra-sharp cheddar.  I thinned the flour/butter mixture with a bit of canned chicken broth because I knew the glop of junk I made would never mix into the egg mixture.  Baked it (covered) in a glass 8-1/2 by 4-1/2 inch loaf dish for about 40 minutes until the center was set, and then about 10 minutes (uncovered) for it to brown.   Do try this with my changes, and you will LOVE it.  Not bland at all!!!  Thank you, Linda, for sharing the basics of this recipe.

I fixed this for a football tailgate party and everyone loved it. The cottage cheese gives it a moist texture.

Very simple to make and really tasty.  Was extra popular since it wasn't all bread.  Was very cheesy, may cut back next time.

I have made this recipe twice and everyone really likes enjoys it.  The only thing we don't care for is the biscuit mixture you add in before you bake it.  The casserole ends up having little chunks of dough in it and we didn't care for the consistency it created.  We will definitely make it again, but will leave the biscuit part out.

Very good and easy to make since most work is done the night before.  The first time i made it the flour/butter mixture was clumpy and didn't mix into my egg mixture.   I left that part of the recipe out this time and I don't think you lose anything but calories.  Love this!

This tasted great. Would be great evening meal, too, especially with some salsa & chips on the side.

I did change up the veggies, only because we didn't have everything on the list.  We used mushrooms, onions, green onions, and green peppers.  I also just threw them in the pan with the pork sausage and cooked it all together... no need for butter.  We used 12 eggs instead of 10, didn't add the flour mixture to it, and it was fantastic!  Everyone loved it!

IT TASTES LIKE IT HAS BICUITS INSIDE!! 
It is really good!!  I am a recently divorced guy.  I think I surprised some people with this great dish at a breakfast meeting this week.

I agree with some of the others...needs more meat.  
I also added green pepper and onion and made the following adjustments:
--use 3/4 lb of cheese
--use pepper jack cheese and forgo the green chiles
--add salt, pepper, spices (I like some kick in my food)
Mine got brown on top at 45 and I let it go a little longer--shouldn't have.  Don't over cook it.

Made this for a football tailgate and got lots of compliments!!I also used a dozen eggs and 1 lb. turkey sausage. Also just 8 oz of cheese. It came out wonderful!! Didn't have a pastry blender, so I just used a fork, and it worked just fine.

I skipped the "pastry" part as well.  I froze it uncooked, thawed overnight, and it baked up perfectly in the morning.

Absolutely delicious.  I forgot to make this up last night so I baked it immediately after mixing it this morning.  Was superb.  I also left out half the cheese (because I didn't have more) and it was still excellent.  I'm going to use this as a base recipe to experiment with other ingredients such as spinach or peppers, as I always have extra produce from my garden that needs to be eaten.  Great recipe!

This recipe is delicious and a favorite of all our family and guests. I've made it at least 20 x.  It's not "filled" with bread and potatoes. I use Jimmy Dean sausage and cheddar cheese. It is excellent and easy. I recommend using a casserole that cooks the casserole at a shallow depth, around 1" so that it cooks faster. Great for brunches and Christmas breakfast!

This is my new favorite egg bake recipe, no messing with bread!  I loved it, so good and so easy!  The first time I made it, I had some lumps of doughy flour mixture throughout.  The second time I made this, I used a pastry blender to mix the flour/butter to make sure there were no big chunks.  Much better!  I highly recommend trying this recipe!!!

pretty good, just make sure you add some milk or other liquid to the batter so it mixes properly with the egg mixture.  I added approx 1/4 c of milk and it turned out wonderfully.

I try to follow a recipe as close as possible the first time i make it. This recipe was great. It came out of the oven bubbling. It looked so tempting that I couldn't wait for it to cool down so I took a forkful of it, blew it a bit and impatience got the best of me and so i scalded my tongue. I loved the gooey moistness of it. It was as yummy as it looked. I couldn't find plain Monterey Jack cheese so i ended up with a Monterey Jack/Cheddar cheese blend. Everything else was the same. I may just have to season it up a bit more next time and maybe change it up a little by adding or substituting with some veggies. I assure you, there will be a next time, and another next time. It's a wonderful starting point. Keeps well as left over too. My husband and I finished it in 3 days. First day, I had a serving and the husband 2. 2 hours later, i had another half a serving. And then another one close to dinner time. We don't do a lot of family gatherings but if we did, I wouldn't hesitate to take this to one.

I've made this many times but omit the flour mixture because I don't like the texture it gives it.  It is wonderful without it.  I also leave out the chili peppers and it still tastes great.

I have made this 3 times in the last 3 months--once for a football tailgate (those 12 noon games require breakfast :), once for Thanksgiving morning (big time saver), and once this holiday season when the house was full of company.  This recipe does not disappoint!  For the tailgate, it was good even after trying to keep it warm for 2 hours before we ate.  I don't tell my husband about the cottage cheese because he doesn't like it, but he raves about this recipe.  I tend to leave out the mushrooms, because people either love them or hate them.  I use the full dozen eggs, and I use all the cheese called for in the recipe.  I also sprinkle some on top before baking.  I have made it the night before and in the morning--both ways turn out great!

So easy, and quite the hit.  I brought it to a breakfast to welcome a staff member back today.  I wasn't able to stay long, but several people told me they loved it, and when I went back to get my dish it was almost completely gone.  Just a few brave remaining morsels left.  So I guess that means everyone liked it!  I made a couple of changes--used 1/2 a package of sliced turkey bacon, and used some salsa instead of a second can of chilis (only had one can of chilis!), but otherwise kept it the same.  So easy to put together, even for me, a complete non morning person.  It baked in about 45 minutes and amazingly enough was still warm--almost completely hot--after my hour drive into work.  Definitely a successful recipe.  thanks for sharing!

Every Christmas brunch I make a sausage cheese strata...but this year I decided to try this recipe instead of using my usual one with all that bread. It was DELICIOUS!!! My family said it was the BEST I've ever made (and I have 8 children)! It was so easy to prepare too! This is gonna become my traditional Christmas brunch from now on...and because it was so easy...I think I'll make it for other occassions too!

I served this for some friends and it was a huge hit.  I made it the night before, let it sit in the fridge over night and cooked it up in the morning.  Very good.  I chose not to add the flour mixture at the end and it did not need it.

I did change it up alittle, and it turned great.I used the whole package of sausage. I didn't have green chiles or green onion, so I sautéed yellow onion and green peppers in a little olive oil and chopped up the mushrooms and added that to it. I mixed sharp cheddar, Monterey jack and Colby. Put it in the oven the next morning and it was ready  in an hour. Company loved it.

Very good but not over the top to deserve a 5*. I made this exactly as written but would not do so again. At least read the first 10 most helpful reviews as they capture three issues repeatedly stated by many reviewers: (i) bland, (ii) very cheesy, and (iii) cooking time. I’m in the camp of this being slightly bland and would adjust ingredients next go round. However, I believe this is a matter of personal preference as some people prefer less spicy food. Like others, ½ lb. cheese vs. 1 lb. is adequate unless you’re a cheeseaholic. Especially take note of needing it to cook longer as it was mushy & runny at 50 minutes other than about 2-3” from around the edges of the 9 x 13 inch baking dish. I believe the cooking time in such dish is 60-70 minutes rather than 40-50. A big plus is the ability to make this the night before!

We craved something like pancakes or biscuits when eating this dish but maybe it was caused by the “flour mixture” being incorporated into the recipe, but nothing sweet to go with it. We drizzled some pure maple syrup on top, and that satisfied our craving. Plan to omit the flour mixture next try, and aim to make a healthier version. Thanks KNITWIT!

Excellent breakfast casserole! Used a whole 1 pound tube of sausage.  Was afraid that the cottage cheese would give it a weird texture & appearance, but it baked right in to the casserole!  Not a huge fan of the mushrooms, next time will make with spinach & some red bell pepper.  Yum!

I really liked the flavor of this casserole.  It had a nice amount of spicy.  Next time I make it I will leave out the flour mixture-it added a wierd sort of texture.

Our new family favorite! I crumbled meatless breakfast sausage patties instead of using pork sausage. The flavor is the same without the grease or "mystery" meat that is ground up in sausages :).  I used my pastry blender to mix the flour mixture--No problems with the texture after baking. I might add spinach next time.  Thank you for the recipe!

Tried this recipe with fat free cottage cheese, shredded mexican cheese blend, and vegetarian Morning Star breakfast patties. Didn't let stand overnigh, but baked right away. WONDERFUL! Brought it to work and shared with co-workers, many asked for recipe. Highly recommend this dish.

This is pretty good. I am deathly allergic to green chiles so take note I subbed in a green pepper. A little underwhelming at first but gets better as you work through it. I upped the mushrooms a bit, used an additional few ounces of oyster mushrooms. Next time I'll use a much better sausage, this is worth the good stuff. Also, the cooking time is a bit light, at one hour it was just done, a somewhat larger pan would remedy that.

I love this recipe....to make it even easier, omit the flour mixture. The casserole doesn't need it! I use turkey breakfast sausage, and reduced fat cheese. This recipe is a keeper!

Good, easy. I replaced green onions with approx. 1/2 cup chopped sweet onion because I had it in the fridge, replaced the chiles with red bell pepper, and used a cheddar/mozzarella cheese mix. I added a little salt to the onion/mushroom/pepper mix as I cooked it. Tasted great!

We absolutely love this.  It is my 'go-to' dish to take along for any morning event--playgroups, work meetings, etc.  I have made it ahead to take camping too and baked it in the motorhome in the morning.  I have also made it in individual muffin-size portions in a muffin pan (don't cook as long!)  It is delicious!  Thank you!

This was the best breakfast bake I've ever made. I made it for an office meeting and they gobbled it up. We are low-carbing it at home, so I made a second batch without the flour mixture, and it was just as good. I did use part Monterey Jack and part Pepper Jack cheese, to add a little more zip. Definately a keeper.

DELICIOUS!  My husband and teenage daughter loved this!  The only change I made to the recipe was using 1 lb of sausage.  I was surprised at how thick the mixture was, but it should be.  When baked, it had a beautiful golden brown top.  We cut squares of this off for breakfast for several days, and it heated in the microwave wonderfully.  This will definitely be a recipe I use over and over!  Thanks for sharing it Linda!

Delicious.  I not use the flour mixture because I was trying to avoid bread/flour, and it was great.  I didn't have a pound of cheese, so used what I had (about 3 cups) and it was plenty.  I had never made a breakfast casserole with cottage cheese in it, and I think that's the ingredient that makes this casserole excellent.

this recipe was wonderful! at first I will admit the egg mixture looks pretty freaky prior to making it but the end result is honestly awesome...I am a beginner to cooking and I made the recipe for 20 of my friends and everybody loved it...I added a few more eggs to thin out cheese because there is alot of cheese (so yummy!) I will definitely be making this again...you should try it out for sure

This was pretty bland, I did not care for it at all. My family ate it without any comment, they usually let me know when they like something. The texture was weird, and I even left out the flour mixture as some had suggested.

Because I am vegetarian, I used imitation sausage and bacon strips from Morningstar farms. I added some extra cheese to it and a few seasonings here and there. Its very dense and it is definitely something that you could eat for a week or so. I also added tater tots to it-just lay them on the bottom of the pan.

I don't review very often, but this was a big hit at our house Christmas morning! I made it with italian pork sausage (as one reviewer suggested) and it gave it just a little more spice. Everyone loved it, including my Mom and my mother-in-law! They both asked for the recipe! Thanks for sharing this one. I'll be making it again soon!

You really can't go wrong with this dish.  It was a big hit, and I, too, liked the texture. I also added green pepper and onions and cooked it at least 50 minutes.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Made this for a family brunch the other day. Everyone liked it..the only thing I would change is use less flour..it made it too much like a bread consistency for our taste. Otherwise a delicious flavor. I will definitely make this again and tweak it to our liking for the flour issue.

Great Recipe, served it for Easter Brunch. I was looking for a prepare ahead of time recipe without bread. After reading other reviews, I used Sage sausage, and sauteed red pepper, onion, and broccoli. I also used Colby Jack, because that is what I had in the fridge, I added a little dry Parmesan to the mixture. I needed it to Gluten free so I left out the flour portion of the recipe. Turned out delicious! All ages loved it.

Good recipe. I especially liked the "bake in muffin pan idea. Easy way to customize for each. Picky child, or adult for that. Matter.

This is a great recipe!  I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 MJ cheese, and put the chiles on top of only part of it for those that didn't want chiles.  I also didn't make the night before.  I will definitely make again!

The whole family loved this recipe.  Will definitely make again.  My kids don't like mushrooms, so I used sauteed onions and peppers instead. Skipped the green chilis also. Used chopped up turkey sausage patties, and didn't have time to let it set overnight.  But still came out delicious!

I was a tad shy(about 4-5 oz) on the cheese & def miss it. I might make it again but I'll use a different meat-ham or bacon-just a personal choice.

This was a really quick and yummy breakfast.  Although, I included all the ingrediants except for the cottage cheese.  I was a bit timid on including it...so I just left it out.  It was was great though.  I think I will make it again.

Love this, and I always get requests for the recipe.  Very versatile.  You can use bacon, different cheeses, veggies, whatever.  I leave out the mushrooms and cut the chili peppers way back.  Some reviewers commented about the flour mixture not incorporating well.  That is really one of the things I like best about this recipe.  The flour mixture is a little lumpy, and gives the whole casserole a nice texture.

This casserole was a complete hit!  I made it for Christmas brunch and everyone loved it.  I omitted the cooking of the mushrooms and onions by accident (I was making this at 3am) but it still turned out fabulous!  Thank you for posting!

Wow!  I'm always looking for a good overnight breakfast casserole and this one did not fail!  I cut the recipe in half but it still made a lot!  My 8-yr old son asked for seconds!  My 16-yr old daughter enjoyed it for breakfast the next day.  Very flavorful and tasty.  My 6-yr old son helped make it because it's so easy to prepare.  The only changes I made...used 16oz of sausage even for a half recipe and as I didn't have green onions I used  small yellow onion.  This one is a keeper for sure.

Great recipe! I make this every sunday and have it for leftovers in the mornings during the week. I don't use mushrooms because I'm not a fan. I just use a package of frozen green peppers and onions. I also use hot Italian sausage. It gives it a bit of a kick. I sprinkle the biscuit part of the recipe on top of the egg mixture after I pour it in the pan. ***A lot of other reviews comment that the biscuit mixture is doughy and they don't like it. The trick is to make sure the biscuit recipe is crumbly! If it's sticking together in a big ball, add a little flour until it becomes crumbly. If you don't do this, then the recipe won't turn out.

Excellent recipe!!  I don't really like eggs, but was asked to make this for an Easter brunch - and I loved it!  It got rave reviews and many got seconds.  I changed the recipe slightly - to compensate for many reviews of "bland":  I used hot sausage, and added 1 lb instead of just 3/4 lbs.  I also used 1/2 lb of sharp cheddar cheese and 1/2 lb. of Monterrey Jack.  I omitted the mushrooms, and used 1 can of mild Rotel with green chiles.  
Also, I had no problems with the flour.  I used a pastry blender to combine the flour mixture and butter, and blended to a fine texture.

I hate to go against the grain but I just don't see what all of the fuss is about. This was easy to make and did bake up nicely but we thought that the taste was bland. The flour mixture had a little bit of a strange texture. Hubby and I brainstormed that if we added bell pepper, more cheese, sausage, onions, s+p, that this might be better. Hubby ended up spooning salsa on top of his for more flavor. This is definitely more of a souffle than a casserole.

This was a humungo success!

Here are some modifications I made:

Used turkey sausage instead of pork - I used Jenny-O which was actually very salty so maybe go with another brand.

Used olive oil instead of butter.

Used egg substitute instead of real eggs - there's a carton that replaces 10 eggs exactly.

Used 2 cups of monterey jack - it was too much cheese though - may have made it saltier also

Didn't use chiles - replaced with green, orange and red peppers

Added a full bag of spinach with the onions and mushrooms in the skillet at the beginning. Could have added even more since it kind of got lost in the mix.

Did NOT add the flour, baking soda, salt or extra butter - didn't need it.

May want to add tomatoes at some point or maybe serve the finished product with salsa.

Also use a real 13x9 sized pan. Mine was too small and it needed extra time in the oven. Came out a little watery right out of the oven but it was banging for dinner that night and the corner that was left the next day!

Enjoy!

Made this casserole this morning for a men's breakfast, and another one very similar except I used a pound of diced ham, about a cup and a half of diced onion and red bell pepper, and three handfuls of baby spinach which I sauteed with the onion and pepper in a couple tablespoons of butter. Both were outstanding, but the one with the ham was the bigger hit. I also used 12 eggs instead of 10. Will definitely be doing this again!

Excellent recipe!  It has become my “go-to” dish to bring to a weekday morning Bible Study.  What is especially nice is that I don’t have to wake up extra early to prepare it...I prepare it at night when I am wide awake, and then just bake it in the morning.  I use disposable pans so clean up is easy.  I am

This banana bread is terrific!  Followed the recipe to the letter and it came out beautifully. The only difference was 50 minutes baking time as apprised to 60. Sixty would have burned. Used a new top of the line LG range.

This was so delicious.   I took the advise of other reviewers and did not put the flour mixture in, and it was still good.  The green chilies did it for me.  I think without them it might be too bland, however, I only used 1 can.  I think 2 might be too much.   I wanted muffins to freeze, for an on-the-go breakfast, so I cooked them in silicone muffin cups, which I recommend for easy clean up.  A keeper.

I made this for my overnight guests. I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I have made quite a few different breakfast casseroles before, but this is my favorite. I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It is quick and easy and delicious!

Turned out good, kids loved it and they ate seconds, and one third.  Even though it is a "breadless" recipe, there is flour so really it's just a bread light version in my opinion.  There are a few things I would change in the wording of the recipe.  

1.  State a little more clearly that you have a part that is prepared the night before.  For the uninitiated like myself, this is not obvious and I had to move the Saturday breakfast plan to Sunday to accommodate the overnight step.  

2.  It wasn't clear to me if you are to mix the flour step with the eggs then the overnight part.  Again, probably a novice question but I had to scour the video, which wasn't exactly clear to me either.  In the end I mixed the flour/eggs together then combined the overnight mix and placed it in the pan.

Delicious! I cut it the recipe in half. Like others noted, depending on the size of your pan, you might need to bake it longer. I used a square casserole dish but needed to bake it a bit longer. It was done when the top was a darker brown like the photo.

This is the first review I have ever written! I made this last night and brought it to worlk today for an office potluck.  There was more than enough for an office of 12 and everyone loved it!!  I am going to make it for christmans morning so I won't have to be stuck in the kitchen! But i will probably cut recipe in half as we only have 6 people at home. You could substitut any of your favorite omelette ingredients.  I served it with sour cream and salsa too.

This recipe calls for WAY too much cheese if you are at all health conscious.  I used turkey sausage and fat free cottage cheese. I put about 18oz cottage cheese and just a cup of Monterrey jack cheese. It was ok, but it definitely needs some more spices. I ate mine with salsa because it was too bland and that made it a little better.

Wow, this was easy and delish. Yes, I gave it 5 stars, even though I made with lots of substitutions. Basically it was a little too high fat for me. I used reduced fat cooked smoke sausage, 4 oz of cheese, low-fat/no salt cottage cheese and egg beaters and canola oil for the butter.  Quite a bit lighter, and it was still great. It was super easy to make for breakfast for company, I will definitely be making this again.

Wow!! excellent recipe.  I took it to a ladies' brunch at church and it was devoured.  I used the whole pound of sausage and misread the recipe, so only used one can of chile peppers.  Other than those 2 small changes, I followed the recipe as written.  Will definitely use it again and have already had some of the ladies ask for the recipe.

My husband said he could eat this for every meal.  (he asked if I would add peppers to it next time, though)  I thought it was missing something, too.

Everyone really liked this and I liked being able to make it ahead and then just pop in the oven the next day. The only alterations I made was to use Jimmy Dean Hot Italian Sausage and instead of green chiles I used jalepenos (we prefer spicier food)...although I brought leftovers to the office and everyone said it had just enough kick...a keeper (although a special treat since it is anything but light fare)

This tasted good, but I had problems with the butter/flour mixture... what do they mean, pour in? ...mine was a floury lump that I tried to mix in, but failed miserably.  We ended up eating lumps of it in the dish.  Not sure what I did wrong.

This was really good.  I couldn't find a can of diced green chile pepper sin the grocery store so I bought 2 fresh chiles.  Maybe next time I'll use more.  I didn't feel any heat from them.  This was a great recipe and I'm sure it would have tasted better if my oven did  on me right after preparing it.  I only made a half batch and was prepared to make it in a 9x9 pyrex.  Thankfullly that fit nicely in the toaster oven, however mine is relatively old and doenst cook evenly.  I had to move it around a few times.  But not the recipe's fault.  I thought this reheated fine, and although it was added calories, we drizzles some Hidden Valley spicy ranch on top of it.  oh... so yummy!  Thank you for this simple recipe!  Will make again!

I made this for a group of 6 and we all loved it.  I have since made it twice more.  I only put in 8 oz monterey jack cheese and leave the rest for people to add as desired.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, egg substitute, 1/2 a green pepper, 1/2 a yellow onion instead of green onions, and have tried ground pork and ground beef.  It's even better when topped with salsa or taco sauce.  All variations are awesome!

Easy and delicious! I halved the recipe, did not use mushrooms, and added sage. Everyone liked it, including my 2 year old son and my picky brother who had previously claimed he didn't like sausage. Will definitely make again!

I substitued the pork sausage for Italian sausage, about 1 cup of diced ham and added green peppers and red peppers. I also thawed about 1 1/2 cups of shredded hash browns, then added 3 more eggs to the mix. It was fantastic!!! My husband loves it!

This was EXCELLENT!!!  I was looking for something a little different from the typical egg casserole that has bread as an ingredient and stumbled across this.  The only thing I did differently was use only 8oz of cheese.  Oh, and I didn't have any mushrooms (plus the kids don't like them), so I just omitted them.  Absolutely delish!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Very tasty and a nice change from the bread casseroles. Made a few changes.I browned italian sausage, with onions and red peppers. Left out mushrooms d/t family preference. Used Ricotta cheese and a mix of cheddar, colby, monterey jack and pepper jack cheese.

Had this for company and it turned out really well. Was great to pretty much have it all put together the night before. I'm not a fan of cottage cheese so I subbed ricotta instead. Will surely do this one again.

loved this! My family prefers breakfast food for dinner. I did use ham instead of sausage as this is what I had on hand.I think this is a very versitile recipe that you can play around with adding some different ingredients from time to time. I will will definately try sausage and bacon next time and different cheeses..

AWESOME!  I didn't have green onions or 'shrooms so I used green peppers and an onion, which I think is better since it adds more flavor.  We all LOVED this!  There's hardly any left ~ Thanks!!

Just made this recipe for a Mother's day brunch and EVERYONE loved it.  I did use plain green peppers instead of the chilies (older crowd - for me I would use the chilies) and I actually made a mistake and created the whole recipe the night before including the flour etc.. and it still was fantastic

Paired with a nice big salad, this was the perfect dinner for my younger daughter's and my busy Monday and Tuesday evenings. We don't arrive home from dance until ten, so I'm always looking for something that I can put together quickly before we leave for the night. I scaled the recipe down to four, but still used the same amount of sausage. The quarter pound of sausage the scaled down version suggested would have gotten lost in the dish. Due to the extra sausage, I used five eggs and because I didn't have any mushrooms in the house, I just threw in some black beans along with several other seasonings. Thank you "COOKER476" for your advice on the flour/butter mixture. It indeed needed some liquid so I just added warm water. I also shredded some cheddar on top of the casserole along with a sprinkling of paprika. My family loved this recipe Linda and I thank you for submitting it!

This was awesome!!! I made it last week for a womens club brunch meeting, and it was a hit. Like many others, I made a few changes. I used 1 lb of spicy sausage, extra mushrooms, 1/2 jack and 1/2 sharp cheedar and a cup of chopped onions instead of the green onions. I also agree with many. Plan to cook longer. Mine took almost 1 hour and 10 min. My husbands family come in this weekend, and I will be making it again

I've always loved this recipe . . .made it today and it was wonderful.  I add a little more melted butter to the flour mixture so that it's not so lumpy and easier to blend.  The point of the flour and bkg powder is that it makes a kind of "crust" on the casserole that's yummy.  I Definitely recommend this one.

I made this for Easter brunch and eveyone seemed to really like it.  It really helped to make it the night before!  I added some orange & yellow bell peppers to the mixture.  I also used reduced fat cottage cheese, spicy turkey sausage and doubled the amount of mushrooms.  It also cooked alot longer than called for about 1 hour 10 min.  I'll definitely be making this again!  Thanks Linda!

This is a great brunch recipe to have handy.  I am curious whether the flour mixture is necessary or not.  I might try skipping it next time.  I have made this twice now with reduced fat sausage, reduced fat cheese, and egg substitute, and you couldn't tell at all.

Omg good.  But I used turkey sausage,  browned that lightly and then turned off the heat and mixed in the mushroom and a red bell pepper but did not cook them.  I used a little less cheese and used Mexican blend, also added a sprinkle of garlic powder.  I skipped the flour because I needed it to be gluten free.  It sat in the fridge over night, I stirred it up before baking. Came out fantastic, and was great reheated the next day.  No idea why you would need flour in it, it sets up perfectly with just the baking powder. Really easy and delicious.

I made this without the mushrooms, threw in a dash of hot sauce and it was great. I did a full lb of sausage since posts talked anout too much cheese and I didnt want to waste the extra bit of sausage in the 1 lb container.  Used fat free cottage cheese and the 2% cheese. I did misread the instructions about putting the butter in the pan w the green onions. I put the 1/3 cup butter with them but that butter is for the flour mixture. It still came out fine. I didnt watch video which showed butter just a small bit in the pan when you do the green onions.

I made a version of this in the individual muffin size for my kids' school Halloween Bake Sale and it was the first dish to sell out (to parents, of course :-).  5-6 people asked for the recipe.  I usually add a few more eggs.

This is sooo good.  I substitute whatever meat and vegetables I have that work together; ham, bacon, I've diced red peppers, and yellow onions.  Stick to the base recipe and improvise - truly delicious.

This has become my go to recipe when I have overnight guests.  I have made it as is, and substitute canned biscuits, grits and croutons for the flour mixture it says to add in the morning.  Whatever I add, I do it the night before.  I use 12 eggs and a pound of sausage and omit the mushrooms because unfortunately one of my sons does not like them.  I have a programmable oven, so I put it in the oven the night before and schedule it to be ready when we get up.  Works great!

This is my go to egg casserole for holiday breakfasts or just breakfast for dinner nights.  The cottage cheese gives it a great consistency and the diced chilies add a nice kick that isn't to spicy.  The only change I've made is half the cheese.  The recipe calls for a whole pound of cheese, which would be two bags. I only do one bag, and it does not take away the flavor at all.

came out light and not dense.  I only used a little of the flour mixture...not the entire amount.  Didn't need full 16 oz of cheese.  8 oz was plenty.  everyone really liked.  made in muffin tins for about 20 minutes.  perfect.

It was quick and easy to make and it tasted fantastic. It was even better with some Pace mild sauce. It is also something you can munch on through out the day. I would suggest if you want this dish for breakfast you get up early because it has to sit for a while so the flavors can come through more or else it will taste a little bland. But the sharp Monterrey jack cheese flavor mixed with the familiar sausage and egg flavor with the breaded texture is all I need for breakfast and brunch all in one casserole!

I made this for a potluck brunch at church.  Most of it was gone so I'd take that as a good sign.  I enjoyed it immensely.  It was a nice change from the recipes that call for cubed bread.

I used Jennie-O turkey sausage patties and broke them up in the skillet as the meat cooked.  I used 3 cups Egg Beaters (instead of 10 eggs) and only put in 1/2 lb. Monterey cheese.  I sprinkled another 3/4 cup (approx) cheese on top of the casserole before it baked and another 1/2 cup or so after I took it out of the oven.  I also found that it needed closer to 60 minutes bake time.

Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe.  I made exactally as called for.  Everyone liked it but I found that I had to cook it for about 20 minutes longer than called for.  70 minutes total.  Maybe next time I will separate into two smaller dishes and make it a little thinner to cook faster.  Nice to have a make ahead that didn't have a bunch of bread.  We made it the night before and served with waffles and a spiral ham for Christmas Brunch.

Wonderful for Christmas Breakfast.  I stuck to the recipe, but omitted the mushrooms (my husband doesn't like them) and substituted jalapenos for the green chiles.  We like it spicy!  I also divided the mixture and baked it in two 9x9 pans for about 45 minutes.  Turned out great!  We all went back for seconds (& thirds!)  Also,  my husband dipped his in spicy barbecue sauce and liked the additional flavor!

Left out the mushrooms (by request) when I made this for my husband's office brunch. Followed the recipe, otherwise, to a T.  It was perfect! Everyone loved it and several have requested the recipe.  I usually make a strata for this bunch, but wanted tp try something different, and this will be my go-to from now on!

More like a 4.5 star review.

This was delicious.  Love the addition of green chilli to anything and this cooked up splendidly.  

Followed recipe as is first time: may add spicier sausage/ hot sauce/ cayenne to the mix next time.

Favorite part that makes this a repeat is the ability to cook the filling ahead and bake in the morning.  Just pull out the casserole and add the last step and boom.  Tastiness abounds.

Also reheats very well...as I overestimated the size of the crowd for a sunday brunch.

Made it for a family reunion breakfast.  It went over well with everyone and was all gone.  I thought it could use a little more heat, maybe a dash of red pepper flakes would do it.  Not much different than many other make ahead egg dishes, but a good one.

I didn't have cottage cheese or cheddar cheese on hand. I did have ricotta and Colby.  It still was delicious and light. I'm sure you could use any favorite.

I'm not quite sure what I got wrong.  I was bringing this to a breakfast at work and it took so long to bake (probably almost twice as long) that I had to go to work, have my husband finish it, and go back home to get it a while later.  With that said it was well enjoyed, thought seemed a bit too salty to me.  I made some substitutions.  Ham instead of sausage and 1 red bell pepper instead of the chili's.  The grocery store was out of mushrooms.  All in all very good, but took too long to bake.

Wonderful recipe.  I made it for a breakfast potluck at work and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe with these changes...  I used a full pound of breakfast sausage and 12 eggs instead of 10.  I used regular cottage cheese instead of low-fat.  I added a little bit like maybe 1/4 teaspoon of salt and pepper to the egg batter and added about 1/2 teaspoon of basil.  I did not measure my onions and mushrooms I just eyeballed it ;) and I used fresh green chillis instead of canned.

You HAVE to try this recipe!  I love being able to just get up and pop it in the oven after being assembled the night before. And it's delicious! I used Monterey Jack and cheddar cheese and didn't have any green chilies but the result was absolutely wonderful. Everyone loved it and my son and husband polished it off the next morning. I'll be making it for my Easter brunch. Thanks for such a great recipe!

This recipe is amazing! I've been making it for a while now exactly as written and it never disappoints. I usually make this for a crowd since it makes a nice large portion and a small piece is very filling. I've made variations to this too using bacon or veggies.

This is very good.  I made it with TJ's Chicken Andoullie Sausage, 2 cups of sharp cheddar, mushrooms, and 1/2 cup flour.  Did not try the peppers, but would be good.

This is one of the best egg casseroles I have ever had. I made it for a baby shower and everyone loved it. Used green bell pepper and onion for the veggies this time, but I'm sure the ones originally listed would be great too. Also used a whole pound of sausage, as others did, and there were no complaints (I mean why not? You're going to cook the whole pound of sausage anyway!). I LOVE that you can mix it up the night before and stick it in the fridge. Makes it so easy in the morning!

I love this recipe! I pull it out anytime we have over night guest. It's always a winner. I did however use turkey sausage, sweet onions, egg substitute,low fat cheese and omitted the flour. These changes lowers the fat content greatly.

It's a Christmas tradition to have this for breakfast.  It cooks while the kids open gifts.  I omit the mushrooms and cut the cheese in half.  I typically use monterey jack or colby-jack.  It also makes a great supper.

I've used this many times when I have a house full of company for holidays, family events, etc. They even ask for it now when they are visiting. I also used fat-reduced sausage and lean bacon - no loss in flavor. I do recommend a lower oven setting and longer cooking time. It sets better in the middle without burning on top.

Great hearty recipe.  Because I didn't have mushrooms I substituted red bell peppers and I also used turkey sausage.  Dish came out mild so I would definitely spice it up with jalepenos or a spicy sausage next time.

This was just ok.  Might be better with additional ingredients, but was really too cheesy to me.  Ended up throwing half of it away because the family wouldn't eat it.

I was hosting a jewelry party in home and needed some breakfast ideas.  I found this wonderful recipe and had to try it.  I accidentally forgot the green onions, but it was a HUGE SUCCESS!!!  Everyone wanted a copy of the recipe.
Thank you for your talented delicious recipe.

Absolutely fantastic!  I made this for our friends this weekend and everyone, even the kids, loved it!  I needed a recipe I could assemble the night before and bake the next morning, with little prep.  This was perfect. Our friends requested the recipe and the website!

Very easy. I baked them in muffin cups, as someone else suggested. Minor changes for ingredients on hand:          used turkey sausage from a recipe on this site, subbed 14 oz container of silken tofu mashed up for the cottage cheese, used only 3/4 lb. of colby/jack cheese, no chiles, added 1/2 c plain yogurt and 1 tsp chopped garlic. I omitted the flour mixture and did not let everything sit overnight. I just baked them for about 25 minutes and let them cool. For the brunch, I nuked them for 1 minute and then heated in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes. I'm freezing the leftovers because I made 24 baby quiches. Very moist - delicious. I could see serving these on top of a mixed green salad. (nobody knew about the tofu!) Thanks, Knitwit!

This is the BEST breakfast casserole! I made it several times for my family and once for company with little kids and even the children loved it and asked for seconds.

Great flavor, but very runny!  I cooked the casserole at the prescribed amount of time plus 10 minutes more and I let it set for 10 minutes.  The casserole was cooked well on the sides, but the center was runny.  So, I am rebaking it.  

I used the Vegan sausage instead of pork sausage.  The outcome of all of the flavors was GREAT!  I will also try to add hot chilis for some kick next time.  All in all, this is a good recipe.  I will make it again, but I will bake it for a longer amount of time.

So yummy and easy to prepare. I would probably divide the recipe in two because it's so filling. It would probably take at least 10 people to eat it all! A definate winner.

Wonderful! I made half a batch and cooked it in an 8x8 pan and it turned out just great. I forget how long it took as I was paying more attention to the color and the firmness than the clock. I was a bit doubtful about the flour/butter mixture, but I stirred in the little crumbles a small amount at a time and it tasted fine. In fact, it was even a little hard to spot them in the final cooked casserole. I will be making this recipe again for sure!!

Absolutely the best egg type breakfast casserole ever!  I made this for a ladies brunch and everyone wanted the recipe.  I think it is the monteryjack cheese that gives this dish an unusually great flavor and texture.

This recipe is pretty good.  I did not like the chunks of flour you run into every once in awhile throughout the dish.  This dish is not good reheated the next day.  I think I'll stick to my old stand by recipe.

Similar to everyone else, I also had a great experience making this casserole.  I also added sage to the sausage, and substituted the green chiles with Monterey Jack with Jalapenos. The flavor was excellent, and, Linda McCann promised, the compliments were many when I presented this at a baby shower.

This was excellent!!! I used a little ricotta as well, and seasoned the sausage with sage for added kick (we love sage at our house), and all in all, my husband, who LOVES sausage, said it was one of the best meals he's ever eaten!! thankyou!!!

This was a big hit at a New Year's Day Brunch and several people asked for the recipe.  I did find that I had to cook it a lot longer than the instructions, as it didn't get brown and was still liquid in the middle.  But with more cooking I was happy with it.

Made this for a family Christmas brunch with low-
fat sausage, egg substitute,& fat free cottage
cheese. It bakes up beautifully & cuts nicely for
easy serving. Everyone loved it.  Thanks for replacing our HIGH fat breakfast casserole.

Super duper good! I wanted to make this a low carb option, so I omitted the flour, butter and baking powder mixture. I didn’t let this sit overnight either. I just baked it immediately for about 50 minutes. Came out delicious all the same. I cut it into squares for a work breakfast meeting and everyone loved them. I also used turkey sausage as I don’t like beef or pork. Will make again!

Like many reviewers I made some changes. I used 1 lbs. of sausage, a dozen eggs, substituted diced red bell pepper for the green chili’s, reduced the shredded cheese to only 8 Oz. I sautéed the veggies (mushrooms, green onions, bell pepper) in butter. I mixed it all up the night before. The next morning I simply transferred it into a large glass baking dish and baked for about 40 minutes, just until it started to set. I then let it rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. I also left the flour mixture out. This casserole is excellent without the addition of bread. This is now my go to breakfast casserole! My church group loved it by the way and I received several requests for the recipe.

I made this for my husband who works from home so he'd have an easy breakfast to heat up every morning. He loved it!! Instead of green onions, I chopped half of a sweet onion and sauteed them.  Also, instead of ground sausage I chopped up turkey breakfast sausages. I only added half the amount of cheese to make it a bit healthier and it was still amazing!

I read several reviews and omitted the flour mixture. I used 12 eggs, about 8 ounces of shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of chopped onion, 8 ounces of cottage cheese and 1 pound of seasoned pork sausage. I baked it for 40 minutes and it turned out well. My kids liked it but no rave reviews. I plan to make it again and possibly add some peppers or something else.

Made just a few changes: used 1 lb of sausage and substituted whole wheat white flour for the all purpose and yogurt for the butter.  Came out perfect.  Served it at the family Christmas breakfast gathering and it was devoured.  That says it all.

I made this for Christmas Brunch and it was a big hit.  Since my guests do not like mushrooms I substituted roasted red peppers. One guest does not eat recipes made with flour,  so I just eliminated the biscuit part of the recipe.  It smelled delicious and everyone said it was a great recipe.  This is a keeper!!! Next time I will probably try it with ham.

This is our go-to Christmas breakfast. I've been making it for years. It's so good that my kiddos commonly request this for their birthday brunch, too. When I make it I use a whole pound of sausage, and a dozen eggs. All the other ingredients for the egg mix I keep the same. It comes out perfect every single time. I do omit the last step that uses the flour, too.

Made this recipe without any changes for my quilting group's Christmas brunch and everyone loved it.  The texture is different than usual, probably because of the flour, but I liked that because sometimes egg casseroles can be runny. I also use the best ingredients I can find, ie. organic eggs, cheese, local farm sausage, and that also contributes to great taste. Making it again Christmas morning.

I made this for brinner and forgot to read the recipe, so I didn't have time to let the cottage cheese mixture sit overnight.  It sat for, oh, thirty seconds while I sprayed my pan with non-stick spray.  Regardless, it was so good!  I had a small square before running out to Bible study and when I returned there was nothing left but crumbs!  I wanted to review to reassure others that it's still wonderful without the overnight time.  And I can't wait to try to recipe as written!

I didn't care for the consistentsie of this casserole. In all fairness and to be helpful to other prospective cooks, I put it all together the night before. It was dense. Probably from letting the baking powder and flour sit all night so would not recommend doing that. I won't try again as I prefer the ones you can put all together the night before if I'm having company.

Very good. I needed to use some cottage cheese and this worked. I will put this in my rotation. This is a nice basic recipe that you can change to what you have on hand. I will add only 1/2 c of flour next time as I thought this was too much.

Excellent egg casserole. The taste is great and it's not too heavy. All of the party goers asked for the recipe.

I made this for Christmas breakfast and everyone loved it!! The cottage cheese made it taste creamy. I am going to try a healthier version as it could be easily reheated for breakfast during the week.

Used it this morning for Christmas brunch. Came out great! I did have to cook it a little longer than what the recipe called out for. The family loved it because it was just the right amount of food to allow them to enjoy their Christmas presents.

Followed this recipe almost exactly. Did not use mushrooms since I don't like them. It turned out OK but not great. Will not be using this again.

I LOVE THIS!!!!  made it , no time for overnite!  I didn't have cottage cheese, though, and being Christmas day and the stores are all closed I had to leave that out.  I browned TWO full pounds of Jimmy Dean sausage, drained it and dumped it into a 9x13 greased cake pan (we were at our kids place so I used what I could) and spread it evenly across the bottom.  Topped that with 2 cups of shredded mixed cheeses.  I beat 13 eggs (13 for luck), added a scant cup of milk, beat the melted butter into that and then the dry ingredients into that.  Poured this all over the sausage and cheese mixture, popped it into the oven and baked it for 45 minutes.  Let it sit for a few minutes after (if you don't let it rest it is greasy on top...rested it is lovely!) and my family devoured it.  I will try it with the cottage cheese next time.  Thank you for this easy, quick recipe!

Wow, is this ever a good recipe.  I love that it doesn't call for chunks of bread.  This was excellent, served it for brunch, it doesn't last long at all.  I'm not sure why some find it bland, because it's everything but. I love that you can make it the night before.  I will serve this Christmas morning!  Thank you!

I love this recipe! My family raves about it when I make it for Easter. A couple of modifications I make are I use different hot sauces and sautéed red/green peppers instead of the chile peppers. It adds color ( and my daughter doesn't like chile peppers). In addition to the green onions I add sweet onions and bacon! Plus a dash or two of garlic powder.

It was superb!!! The ONLY change was due to an error on my part! I "thought" I read Diced  tomatoes with Green Chili Peppers! Ooops! So I picked out the green chili peppers from 3 cans of Diced  tomatoes with Green Chili Peppers!  Then added half of an onion as Which turned out just fine!  I used lb sweet

Wonderful master recipe for any strata you wish to make.  I needed to use up some leftover pepperoni, sausage and olives from pizza plus I like spinach and egg so added that, as well as a chopped small jalapeno and 1/2 an onion (sauteed).  And it turned out great.  I used a pizza cheese mix from a bag.  Very light and fluffy and satisfying.  I would set my timer a few minutes early as my strata was a bit too firm/crunchy.  This would be great with herbs and grilled vegetables, with crispy bacon and sauteed tomato, or even mexican style with a few ounces of chorizo, chopped onion and grilled tomato and a few jalapenos with cilantro.  I can see this working for me.

My family loved this recipe...and I have a hater of egg casseroles.  I did change the recipe for more flavor.  Instead of the flour, baking powder and salt, I added 1 cup of Jiffy Cornbread mix and mixed with the melted butter. I also did not let it sit over night just baked it right away. I increased the baking temp to 400 and baked for 35 minutes. It turned out perfect!  My husband topped it with fresh salsa for added bonus flavor!

I made this for Easter and took out the green peppers and substituted the mushrooms for celery. It was spectacular! However, next time I'm taking out the green onions and substituting them for some thing else.

This was delicious. Although I did modify the recipe with the help of other reviews I'm still giving it 5 stars.  I halved the recipe using 1 1/2 cups egg beaters (equals 6 eggs), still used roughly 3/4 pound hot Italian sausage (we like spicy!), omitted the mushrooms and added 1/2 red pepper, three green onions,  1 4 oz can green chili peppers, 1/2 cup cottage cheese and 1 cup pepper jack cheese.  The cheese amounts to half of what the adjusted serving suggested.  I used no butter at all and omitted the flour mixture.  I ended up baking it for 1 hr.  We didn't miss any cheese or notice the egg beaters.  Ill definitely make this again.

I use cheddar cheese, no flour or chile peppers, I use the whole package of sausage (1 pound) and I add a pound of crumbled cooked bacons to make this my perfected breakfast casserole. The flour turns it into a muffin-like consistency so I leave it out and you get more of the egg texture which I like better. You can experiment with the flour  option by making one muffin  with it and one without it before you cook the whole casserole pan to see which consistency you prefer. Doesn't add flavor by adding flour, but does make it easier to bring this to a work party in muffin format.

Just made this for a big brunch and it was a HUGE hit, thank you for the excellent recipe.  Followed it exactly except adding less cheese and less butter to the flour mix.  Everyone raved, making again for Christmas day!

I halfed this recipe for only 3 people and there was still plenty leftover for afternoon munchies YUM! 
Also, I didn't use the can of chilies opting for only onions, mini sweet bell peppers and Italian sausage but the taste was AWESOME. This casserole was halfway gone in 2 hours! and we kept picking at it until noon. 
Definitely a recommendation :)

We really liked this recipe! I made it exactly as the recipe dictates and it turned out great. I had to bake it closer to 90 minutes, though, in order for it to be totally set throughout. Next time I will try to half the recipe so there's not so much left over but keep the amount of mushrooms and green onions, since we love those, there's always room for more!!

This one's a keeper.
I've made this twice during this Christmas season. One directly as the recipe stated, and one with the flour mixture left out, and used ham instead of sausage, and Muenster and Colby Jack mixture of cheeses because that was just what I had on hand at the time. Both dishes turned out wonderfully. 
  I think this is the perfect breakfast casserole that isn't loaded with bread, and is incredibly versatile. Exactly what I was looking for. Awesome! Thanks!!

This was great.  I didn't have any trouble with the crumbles, nor were they a weird texture.  I made them the night before, also, then realized that it was rock hard from being in the frig... so I softened it again in the microwave for 25 seconds.  I made sure the crumbles were the texture of crumbs w/ a pastry cutter again, then mixed it in.  No noticeable chunks.  Everyone enjoyed it for Christmas morning.  I left out green onions because of my kids.  I used the full tube of sausage, rather than waste 1/4 lb.

I followed the recipe exactly and this really turned out well.  After reading the reviews, I didn't really know what to expect with the flour/baking powder/salt/butter mixture.  I used a fork and just kept mixing as best I could and it almost looked like a wet, crumbly dough but just remember that you don't pour it in - it's more like sprinkling it into egg mixture.  With all that said, it was really delicious and I will definitely make it again.

This casserole turned out amazing! I did not let it sit overnight as suggested and it was still to die for. I did not use the bread mixture as other reviewers did not recommend. Also, I placed the mixture in two 9"x13" dishes, approximately 1" deep and cooked at the suggested time. Both dishes turned out golden brown and tasty.

This egg/sausage casserole was very good and filling! I served it for several overnight guests and everyone commented how good it was. My preschooler even liked it.  I tried keeping to the recipe as much as I could, but I used what I had on hand.  I believe the main ingredients in this recipe make it good, regardless of what you add to it.  I used an entire 1ib pkg mild sausage. I used 1 small onion, I didn't have mushrooms but did have a red bell pepper on hand so I added that.  I only had mild cheddar so I threw that in with a little mozzarella I had left.  I didn't have peppers, but wouldn't had added anyway.  I did add a little salt & pepper, though I doubt salt was needed as sausage gave it a good flavor.  I used a pastry blender for the flour mixture.  I baked it 40 min with my pampered chef 9x13 and let it stand the 10 min, came right out. Don't be afraid to make the recipe your own! Thank you for sharing the recipe!!  Will make it again.

This is a great use-what-you-have recipe! I was looking for a bread-less egg casserole to use up some leftovers I had on hand. I didn't have any breakfast sausage so I subbed ground beef, used cheddar instead of jack, a big dollop of salsa instead of chiles, added some baby spinach & a chopped tomato along with the mushrooms and green onions before adding to the egg/cheese mixture. It came out great. The texture is so light and fluffy! I'm sure it is even better with sausage. I don't think it is lacking anything without the bread, would be great for those cutting carbs! Thanks KNITWIT, love this!

I left out the butter and crust.  Used turkey sausage added cooked green peppers instead of the chile peppers. And poured approx 1/4 cup of mixture in a greased muffin tin and baked right away.  Perfect for a quick individual breakfast and they freeze well. This recipe made approx 24 muffin sized servings.

Used as a base recipe.  Used 1 lb sage pork sausage.  Fried a green bell pepper and one small white onion in with the sausage.  Didn't include biscuit mix or green chile peppers.  The cottage cheese in this is fantastic.  Will make over and over again.  Hoping leftovers are as delicious as fresh out of the oven.

This was a wonderful casserole. I halved it, but used 6 eggs, turned out great & has the airy texture of a souffle.

This recipe is awesome.  I made some changes the second time I made it and it was still great.  I used ham in place of the sausage.  Didn't have any green chillies so replaced with chopped banana pepper rings, used canned mushrooms and cheddar cheese; and omitted the flour, salt and baking powder.  The baking time is closer to 70 minutes made according to the recipe or with changes.

Great for any celebration morning!We modified it to suit ourselves---used a dozen eggs, skipped the flour mixture altogether, no chili peppers,and added about a half teaspoon of paprika. Serves 12.

Rave reviews from a mix of guests.  I followed other reviewers' advice and only used 1/2 lb cheese.  1 lb would have been a lot.

Excellent recipe!  My changes: substituted turkey breakfast sausage, whole wheat flour, fresh green chilis, and Emmenthaler cheese.  Tasted delicious!  A great way to get more protein in the most important meal of the day.  I also did not refrigerate overnight, and it turned out just fine for me.  Maybe I'm missing something and it would fluff up even more with an overnight preparation, but it was just the right consistency and juiciness/firmness when I whipped it up and then put it right into the oven.  Great, will use again!

Great recipe!   I like mine spicy so I think I will add hot sausage next time or some hot sauce to the mix.  I love that you can make this ahead of time!

Great casserole to make the night before...did not make any changes...comes out thick -- not flat like many egg and sausage combinations.  Loved the chilies and mushrooms!

Quick and easy.  A very good option when less bread is wanted in the casserole.  We thought the chilies were mild, but a good addition.

Really good.  Everyone that tastes this wants the recipe.  I added some milk to the flour mixture so it was easier to mix in the next morning.  I also do a vegetarian version with broccoli and red bell pepppers.

I followed this recipe to the letter except used sharp cheddar and I found it very bland.  It sounded so good with all the ingredients I like but even topped with salsa I did not enjoy it.

Great Recipe!  I have made it more than 10 times now.  Always play around with the veggies I put in....spinach, mushrooms, peppers, etc.  I usually make them in muffin tins so they are easy to reheat in the morning before work.

fool-proof! I made this with veggie sausage patties (cut up one pkg morningstar) and 1 can chopped mushrooms, 1/2 chopped onion, and 8 oz sharp cheddar (plus another cup on top before baking). I didn't make it the night before (just in fridge about an hour and a half) and totally forgot to mix in the melted butter to the flour mixture until it was already all mixed, but I threw in the butter anyway. Baked loosely COVERED with foil for the first 40 min and then uncovered last 10 min. Turned out perfect!!! All of my guests loved it and many asked for the recipe. Plus, they had no idea it was vegetarian until I told them. Excellent!

This recipe was very good. I didnt give it the full 5 stars because I kept finding chunks of that flour mixture in the finished product. I cant figure out the purpose for the addition of that mixture. I did follow the directions to a T. Very good, just not the best.

This is now a staple for Easter brunch. I make two - one I substitute the reduced fat sausage with a spicy sausage to add some sizzle for the more bold palates and one exactly as the recipe calls for everyone else - both are hits! HINT: Don't use a deep dish. As others have posted, the middle can be runny and edges burnt if it is too thick.

Wow this was awesome! I halved the recipe, used red bell peppers, onions and mushrooms instead of sausage and chile peppers and it turned out great! The only thing was it was still runny in the middle when I took it out of the oven- but that was because the dish I put it in was too deep! Next time I will use a shallow dish. Good recipe!

This recipe is wonderful! Out of necessity, I made a few changes. For breakfast I had no sausage, but I did have chorizo. I had a dozen eggs, so I used them all. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe. The casserole was cooked at 350 degrees for 50 minutes. It worked!

This definitely gets points for being easy to put together on a busy morning, while still being festive. I was cooking for a family of 5 so I halved the recipe. I did not use sausage, as I had cubed ham that needed to be used. And to make it more kid friendly, I took out to green onion and green chilies (I would love these, but my kids not so much) and used onion powder to still get some onion flavor, and replaced the chilies with black olives. I also used 1 can of mushrooms rather than fresh because fresh make me sick. I served with homemade salsa. Next time I will definitely either use sausage, or I will thinly slice the ham, because I wasn't in love with the consistency of the cubed ham in the egg mixture. Everyone in my family except my 2 year old ate it, but she doesn't count because she was obsessed with her applesauce. My 7 year old texture/taste sensitive son said it was good and ate most of it. Since we also had pancakes, bacon, and milk or oj to drink, I call that good! My 5 year old declared it YUMMY! I am only taking away one star because I wasn't in love with the consistency brought on with the flour, and think that maybe next time I won't put as much. All in all, it was tasty, and we will use this again next Christmas.

I really couldn't decide if I LOVED this or not. I followed to a T, and for the time and money spent on ingredients, I don't think I will make again. I served this for my family Christmas morning, and only 2 servings were eaten...Sorry. nm

My husband is so picky and he loved this recipe.  I would probably use half the flour next time though.

This was delicious. Everyone loved it.  I brought it over to my daughter's house on Xmas morning.  If I had known it was going to be so good I could have gotten away with buying no gifts...ho ho ho.  I left out the flour mixture all together.  I used a pound of sausage and eleven eggs. Instead of Monterey Jack I used the 4 cheese Mexican blend.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.

Made this casserole many times. I make these changes: I use 1lb turkey breakfast sausage and about 10-12oz of Jack cheese. I assemble the casserole at night and in the morning I put the casserole directly in the oven. I omit step 4 completely. The results are perfect! This is a wonderful recipe - I always get requests for it and I make sure KNITWIT gets the credit! Many thanks.Pattih5

Really good, nice flavor and easy to make. Although I thought that there was to much of the dough mixture so next time I will probably half that part of the recipe.

I made this this morning for Christmas breakfast and it was delicious!  It got rave reviews.  I did not change a thing and it was very easy to make and time saving to boot because most of the work is done the night before, although there is very little "work" involved.  I did leave out the mushrooms because I am the only one that likes them but I bet it would have been even better with them.  This would be great for a potluck.  Thanks for sharing it is definitely a "keeper".

Very easy.  My husband loved it.  Great flavors.  I made the egg mixture 2 days before and put the remainder of it together right before cooking.  It was light and fluffy.  Will make again.

Tasted Great! Although I did some changes. I didn't do it overnight, I baked it right away, I didn't have Mushrooms or Chiles to put in it, so instead I did cook up the Green Onions and put one potatoe diced up for the veggies and the rest I did by the original directions and it turned out great. My husband kept coming back for more!

This was really good. I used 1 lb. Andouille sausage for a little extra flavor. I didn't have time to let it sit, so I cooked it right after mixing everything together. The leftovers had a lot more flavor the next day, so next time I will let it sit overnight so everything can meld. I also didn't get "biscuits inside" as other reviewers mentioned, perhaps also because I made it immediately. I can't wait to try it again.

I love this recipe! It was very easy to prepare and it taste great. I used 12 eggs instead of 10 and I added a few additional seasonings. I will use this recipe again in the future.

This was delicious and easy.  We only used 1 can of chiles and thought it was perfect, 2 may have been too overpowering.

I made this Christmas morning. My bake time was longer than what the recipe suggested. I left out the mushrooms, because they are not a family friendly item. Omitting the mushrooms may explain the additional bake time needed. The result was still delicious. I will make this again.

This was a huge hit with my family. I did not make it the night before and it was still yummy! I did use the toast feature on my oven to brown up the top and it definatly needed the full 50 minutes to cook. Can't wait to make it again!

I am still thinking about how delicious this cassarole was!  I made it on Christmas morning--VERY easy to finish off and pop in the oven after assembling the bulk of it the night before per recipe. Everyone loved, especially husband, and even the picky kids!

I used 1 pound of sausage and left out the mushrooms.  Also added an extra egg and 2 cans of green chiles.  Used four cheese mixture plus mozzarella.  Delish.  Hubby added hot sauce to his.  He really did not like it but the rest of the family did! He is not in to "casseroles".

This was a great recipe. My daughter and I loved it. The middle was a little runny and had to bake a little longer after cutting. Would scale it down because it made way too much.

I made this for a baby shower today and everyone loved it! I made it exactly as the recipe stated. It was easy and very hearty. I am very new to this cooking thing and was a little nervous about trying it. But it was super easy and came out great. I did not have problems with the flour mixture as others stated. I sifted really well,so there weren't many clumps. It was excellent! Thanks for the great recipe!

Made a few changes, but this was fantastic.  Made it for some guests and it disappeared quickly.  I cut the recipe in half and substituted bacon for the sausage (personal preference).  Didn't add the flour part because I ran out of time.  Like I said, it was gone instantly.

I made this because I had all the ingredients, but honestly didn't think my husband would like it as he never goes for this sort of dish.  Well he LOVED it and so did everyone else.  I made it exactly as written except I only used one can of green chiles.  It was still perfect.  Great recipe!

This was delicious and was very well-received.  I used cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack.  I also used hot pork sausage.  I think that next time I will mix the last four ingredients in with the rest of it.  I wasn't crazy about the flour/butter clumps.

bought this to a breakfast at work-everyone asked for the recipe.  I was worried when I mixed the flour and butter together, but it blended with the egg mixture just fine.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I did have to cook mine for 10-15 minutes longer in order for it to set.

Very good.  I used maple sausage, but next time I will use a combination of hot and mild Italian sausage for more flavor. Everyone enjoyed this. I had no problem with the flour mixture, I used more butter and mixed the flour into the butter in 1/4 cup incriments.

Awesome recipe. I made this for a Couple's baby shower and it turned out perfect. The only change was that I didn't put the Flour mixture in. I just prepared everything the night before and threw in the oven - had to bake a few minutes longer than suggested. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

My husband liked this more than I did.  I made the recipe as called for.  It was good.  A little bland.  Next time, I may add more cheese and maybe some green pepper.  Overall, it was a good dish, but I think there are better egg/sausage casseroles out there than this one.

Delicious!  Big raves!  I prepared this in advance, baked it, and froze it.  The only changes I made were: I added about a cup of chopped onion to the sausage/egg/cheese mixture, and: I used frozen hash browns, with about 2 TBS. Wildtree Herbs' Home Fries Seasoning Blend (to the potato mixture). Took it to my sister-in-law's over the weekend, and first thing in the a.m., I popped it in a  300 degree oven for about 45 minutes, covered. Wonderful breakfast!

I prepared this the night before, and it was a huge hit. I doubled the recipe, and it came out perfect. Next time I'll cut the fat by using low fat cheese and sausage. Very delicious!!! I was concerned that the casserole would be dry, but it was great. I think the cottage cheese helps keep it moist.

This was a very good breakfast casserole.  I didn't have time to assemble the night before, so that may have made it even better.  I did use the "hot" ground sausage for extra flavor.  Leftovers were good too.

I made this for brunch on Thanksgiving since we planned to have dinner later in the day, it was wonderful!  Everyone liked it.  I used Jimmy Dean maple flavor sausage and left out the onion, it was very good!

This is great. Just make sure you allow for the allotted set-up time. I jumped the gun and it was a little mushy in the center. Still...it tasted excellent and got rave reviews.

I've made this recipe twice now for brunch and it has turned out wonderful both times.  Making it the night before really saves time the morning of the brunch and it was so nice to just be able to throw it in the oven and let it cook.  Everyone I've served it to (including my 3 year old), love it.

Nice flavor though next time I will add some hot sauce and use hot sausage. Thought it could use a little more spicing up. Didn't have baking powder so I omitted and it was fine. I am like the other reviewer and think maybe you don't really need the flour mixture. Will try that next time. Had to increase the baking time quite a bit and still didn't get done in the middle...Soupy. Reheated nicely this morning in the microwave.

I just made this casserole again for the 3rd time since Christmas. It was a big hit. My house guests kept  asking for more. I've never made an egg/cheese dish that was this popular before. I will definetly make this often. It would also be good for dinner.

I like this one because it has no added bread.  I can serve it with a french toast casserole and not have too much bread in my dishes.

The BEST crustless quiche I’ve ever had. Very flavorful!! I omitted the flour and baking soda used 1 full lb of sausage so I didn’t have 1/4 lb left over and it was spectacular!!

This was delicious!  I cut the egg portion in half, using 6 eggs.  But the roux portion I kept the same.  I forgot to buy diced chilies, so instead used a can of Rotel and that worked great!  We enjoyed the flavors very much!

Made this several times. I have used bacon, pork sausage, turkey sausage, but the best, in my opinion, is Chicken Apple sausage. Quartered and sauteed, I think it is the best of all. I have use various kinds of veggies, mushrooms, broccoli, onion, green onion, asparagus,  it all works.  I prefer to use TJs Swiss, and Gruyere,  cheese mix. In my opinion you can almost never have too much cheese.  Make it your own.  The recipe is very forgiving. I have also made this as a Zero points WW option. It all works.

I almost followed the recipe.  used a pound of sausage and 13 eggs.  Also went with 3/4 cups of Bisquick instead of the milk, soda and flour.

It was great and pretty too

The melted butter and flour mixture made a stiff dough. I knew it wouldn't blend in. I don't know why it is in the recipe. I added more melted butter until it was more like a roux. I don't know if it's needed at all, though. Next time, I will try without it.

I've made this recipe many times and my family and co-workers have all loved it. It's so easy to fix the night before and just pop it into the oven while you get ready for work in the morning.  I use the whole dozen eggs, a pound of sausage and skip the biscuit mixture. I actually serve it with biscuits and it's a big hit.  Thank you for a really good and easy recipe!

This was delicious and filling! I made as directed except used 1 lb of sausage since that’s how it came, and I omitted the mushrooms because hubby doesn’t like them. I used a pastry cutter with the flour and butter part, as someone else suggested, and I think that was a huge help with getting it to evenly distribute. I didn’t have any doughy globs. I didn’t find it too cheesy either. Very tasty.

Made this for Mother’s Day brunch and it was a huge hit! I  made a couple of minor modifications. Since the group does not like spice, I used regular peppers instead of the chile peppers. I also used a little over a pound of the sausage since that was what was in the package I bought. Also, I took advice from other reviewers and went a tad less on the shredded cheese. This one is a keeper for sure!

It’s good, but even making a few adjustments to add some oomph it’s a bit bland. I added some red pepper, tomato, oregano and garlic and doubled the green onion.  I did reduce the cheese slightly and used extra sharp cheddar (what I had). Spicier sausage or another can of chiles might help (and/or more veggies).  I needed to make it gluten free so skipped the flour mixture; I thought the texture was fine without but will be interested to see what it’s like with.  I’ll make it again but definitely need to play with the ingredients.

I've actually made this lots of times, with variations. It's now a household favorite. Sometimes with meat. More often without it. With red, green and yellow peppers instead of mushrooms, less butter and it still comes out great.

I used a spicy chicken sausage with cilantro and through in some bacon. I also broiled it for that last 3-4 minutes to crisp the top. It was good!

We kept the recipe exact. Yes we will definitely be making it again. I only added more butter to sauteing the green onions and mushrooms. Other than that nothing.

This is an excellent recipe.  It was a big hit with my family!!!!!  I did have to cook it an extra 10 minutes.  I have made many egg casseroles over the years so I knew it was not done.  I added some tabasco to the recipe because of other comments but this is a wonderful recipe and I will be making it many more times.  It is very important to get the flour mixture mixed in well.  I added it a little at a time and stirred with each addition of the flour.

I made this egg casserole for Easter brunch and everyone really liked it. I substituted white onion for the green onion and left the mushrooms out because I didn't think my grandsons would like them. I love mushrooms and will include them when I make it next time. I also used an organic maple chicken sausage and substituted a combo of pepper jack cheese and shredded cheddar cheese. It was really tasty and I look forward to  making it again!

TBD: Trying :


 12 eggs, 1 lb. of sage, pork or turkey sausage,  chopped up 1 large green bell pepper and 1/2 a large onion and sautéed them instead of using the green onions, mushrooms, and canned peppers. I also used 8 oz. of shredded sharp cheddar instead of the 16 oz.

I substituted the sausage with ham and used pepper jack cheese instead for a little zip! I also didn't let anything set overnight, and it still turned out great.

After reading the reviews that it was bland and too cheesy, I used a hot sausage and added about 1tsp of mustard powder to the eggs and reduced cheese to about 3/4 substituting part with cheddar.  We thought it was great. It was more dense like a bread pudding which I thought made it hardy. Definately used a pastry cutter for the dough as someone suggested.  Came out perfect. Would make again!

This is my favorite egg casserole recipe ever, and I am pretty picky about egg casserole!! No other recipe compares. I usually add a brown onion and red or green bell peppers, and often omit the mushrooms as the rest of my family do not love them like I do. But I've made it with all kinds of veggie and meat combos and it is always delicious!! I

It was very flavorful.  I love being able to prepare it the night before.  I love the bits of 'biscuit' incorporated into each bite.
I used 3 fresh chillies instead of the cans.

Made it according to the instructions, and it was indeed good. We are on a Low Carb diet at present, and I think the next time I will leave out the flour. Bit to "cakey" for me, and my diet. The eggs and cheese will do just fine holding it together. I will leave the baking powder in for fluffiness. Might throw in a bit of Creole seasoning for taste. Or maybe more Chiles.

I think I will add Bisquick instead of the flour next time. The casserole will make its own 'pie crust' if Bisquick is added instead of the flour.

I feel like every holiday I try a new make before breakfast casserole, and every year I'm fairly unimpressed. This one, however, is a keeper! I will for sure be making this time and time again! The only thing I changed, and would suggest, is to use a whole pound of sausage if this is now you have purchased it. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Made this for our Christmas breakfast. I'm giving it 4 starts because my family raved about how they loved it.  I don't need much spice at all, and found it a little bland.  I didn't use the chiles  but the onions and peppers should have been plenty sufficient.  It just seemed like something was missing.  I ate mine with some salsa and  it helped a little.  Will make again for the fam but I won't  really be looking forward to it myself.

Love this recipe. It has been our Christmas morning tradition for many years. Sometimes I change the white cheese but that's it. :)
I'm considering trying it in the Crock-Pot this year

I made this on Thanksgiving morning.   It was delicious!  I didn't add the flour since many of the reviewers mentioned it wasn't necessary.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  So good!

This was great. The only changes I made was half the cheese was sharp cheddar because that is what I had.  And I left out the flour. No need for it and we don't need the added carbsnAbsolutely delicious.

I will definitely make it again, but next time I will use hotter chilies.  It is very filling and even makes tasty leftovers.

I added lightly sauteed mushrooms and a can of chopped, drained artichoke hearts. You really can use less cheese or different cheeses which I plan to do when I make it again (many times) in the future.  This really fed a crowd on Mother's Day & I'm still getting calls for the recipe!  Thank YOU!!

Delicious. I used Mexican chorizo. I changed the veggies a bit to exclude the mushrooms. I used the green onions, about half a small sweet onion, and half a red bell pepper. I used half the amount of cheese.

Definitely 5-star unless you are trying to cook gluten-free.  Have used this recipe countless times with various types of meat (sausage, bacon, ham, or some combination thereof), always delicious-- although we never use a full pound of cheese!

This has great flavor and a nice texture that is firm but still moist. For a half batch, 50 minutes in an 8x8 pan was perfect.

Just made this (times 2) for the staff at the elementary school where I work. It was gone in minutes!  After reading reviews, I made one with the flour mix and one without. The one with the flour mixture was definitely better.

I made this for a workplace brunch offering, and it was a great hit!  I personally don't  care for green chilies, so I substituted the same amount of jarred roasted red peppers, drained and chopped.  Other than that, I was faithful to the recipe-- it was SIMPLE, and DELICIOUS, and GONE!

This was somewhat disappointing and rather bland.  One could hardly tell there was sausage in it.  Even the chili peppers seemed "lost".  Although it presents very well I would have to call it average.

This was very good. Made it for Christmas morning. Prepared it the night before, popped it into the oven when I got up, heated some croissants, and when all the festivities were done everything was ready. Used sage sausage.

I made this recipe again this year for our family's Christmas Day brunch.  It is a "hit" with all age groups.  One of the best comments made this year was from our 5 year old granddaughter - " Mamaw - I really like these eggs!"  Well, that just about says it all!  And then I was so surprised - when I went to clean the kitchen - the entire casserole was "gone!"  Now, that's a great dish!  Thanks AllRecipes.com!

I made this the night before which helped with Christmas morning brunch. I did change a bit after reading comments. I used green pepper and onion; no mushrooms or green chili's available. I used a full pound of sage sausage and 12 eggs but only 1/2 the cheese.  The big kids liked it; some of the little kids, not so much.  I will probably make it again but spice it up a little with spicier  sausage, and/or spicier cheese (will use more) and may use green chili's instead of green peppers. I did not add the flour mixture and it tasted fine without it.

This was easy to assemble and very tasty .  I made a half one to try out, and will make the whole one for Christmas morning.  I really like it can be prepared the night before and baked in  the morn.  Also, the ingredients can be changed up to suit different taste buds!

I made this today and it is a definite keeper!  I used the whole 16 lb. chub of sausage and since my family likes things jazzed up a bit, I used 1/2 Monterery Jack & 1/2 Pepper Jack cheese.  I also used the whole bunch of green onions....7 and a generous tsp. of white pepper.   I will make this again and maybe substitute ground ham.

Very solid recipe. Can be adapted to many different tastebuds.
I added Italian seasoning in the flour mix and used 1lb of hot  sausage to kick it up a notch! I don't understand how one reviewer can say it's bland. Very moist and delicious. A keeper for sure

Very good - I was out of mushrooms so threw a few green peppers I for color. Delicious and easy - I'm not sure what the purpose is for chilling the egg mix overnight, so I didn't do it and it ended up just fine.

Easy to make a slimmed down version and super yummy!  I used turkey sausage, Egg Beaters, fat free spray butter, and low fat cottage cheese.  Shared some with a co worker at lunch and she was shocked when I told her what was in it.  Now I have to bring a little extra for her every time I bring it for lunch!

Made exactly as the recipe is written and it was fantastic.  I'm sure you could make it without the flour mixture but in my opinion it adds a little extra heft that makes it a perfect stand-alone dish for breakfast.

Made this as muffins using the exact recipe, using Jimmy Dean original pork sausage. They freeze well  so made a double batch. My husband really likes them, especially when he is up before me in the morning!

I made this for a brunch and everyone loved it!! I took the tips of some of the reviewers. I added ham, red and green peppers, and shredded hashbrowns. I subsituted ricotta for the cottage cheese. Instead of the montery jack I used Mexican 4 cheese and sharp cheddar. I did not make the biscuit mixture. Also I added 3 more eggs.

AWESOME!!!  This casserole is really amazing.  I am not one to stick to a recipe. In this case, I didn't follow the directions exactly. I used 1 lb of sausage, 1 small onion (sauteed) instead of the green onions and I didn't use mushrooms.  I also used full fat, large curd cottage cheese.  This recipe is wonderful.  Even my hubby who doesn't like green chilis gobbled this right up.  Will be making again for sure!

Fantastic!  I made a few changes because I had veggies that needed cooking.   Red & Green bell pepper, white onion and I didn't cook them before adding to the egg.   I also used 5 whole eggs and 5 egg whites.  Some thick cut bacon, chopped and half the amount of sausage and cheese.  yummy yum.

I cooked this in muffin tins on my gas grill.  Only took about 15-20 minutes, and they were delicious.  I did two versions, one with the sausage and one without.  Everybody loved them.

This casserole was pretty easy to make, and the southwestern flavor in it (montery jack and green chilies) was fantastic.

Great casserole! Just served it at a brunch this morning. I'm sure it would be great without any changes, but I followed reviewer Kathy's lead and used 12 eggs, 2 green onions and half of a large yellow onion added 3 minced garlic cloves (because everything is better with garlic), left out the diced green chillis, sprinkled some cajun seasoning in the egg mixture and baked for about 1 hour. It was a hit! Thanks!

I hate to change anything when I first try a recipe, but I am not a big fan of cottage cheese, so I used Riccotta. This was delicous. I also made Mike's Mushroom Bread to go along with it. Everyone loved both.

This is by far the easiest and most yummy breakfast dish. I used maple pork sausage and the results were amazing. I made it for a dish to take to work for a large meeting. The only problem was that my family was upset that they couldn't have any!

Everyone enjoyed this.  I thought it made a bit of a mess to put together but it was worth it.  It lacked a little seasoning we thought so next time I fix it I will adjust more to our tastes.

Made this for Christmas brunch and everyone loved it!! The whole dish disappeared. Will definitely make again! I omitted the flour mixture. Used bell pepper and white onion instead of green. No mushrooms. 4cheese Mexican blend along with sharp cheddar. I also added some hash browns(3 c.) since I took out the biscuit mix. Delicious!!

This was very tasty. I made it Christmas morning and everyone loved it...from the kids to the adults. I did not get the biscuit issue that some people mentioned. I just made sure that it was well mixed and everything turned out fine. I also did not let it sit overnight. I assembled and made it all at once and it was still very good. I left off the chili's because the cheese I bought had chili's in it and it had a very nice kick. There were no leftovers and requests for me to make it again the next morning.

This was easy, quick, and great tasting -all my criteria in one!  I served this at Christmas morning brunch - with the relatives, and it dissappeared before my son-in-law could even get any!  I took the advice of others; one pound of sausage; 12 eggs; 1 can of green chiles; 6 green onions; at least (probalbly more) 1/2 pound of fresh mushrooms; 8 ozs. of shredded colby mix, and 8 ozs. Italian shredded mixed cheeses. This reminds me of quiche; kind of the same texture.  Once again, Allrecipe didn't fail me.  Thanks, again.

Gets five stars for it's ease, versatility, taste, consistency and presentation. Really looks great in and out of the pan. Expected a good 3-4 star but got much better. Even leftovers are worthy of guests!

I diced and sauted 2 green bell peppers instead of using the 2 cans of chilies. Also used 1 lb of ground pork with a tablespoon of Italian Seasoning instead of the pork sausage.

This was really good. I made it for Christmas breakfast and everybody loved it. The only change I made was to thin the batter with a little chicken broth,like one reviewer suggested.

I absolutely love this dish.  It's a great dish for a holiday breakfast, but my husband likes it just to have for breakfast during the week.  It wasn't hard at all.  The only thing that I changed was to half the amount of mushrooms because I'm not a fan of them, but they cooked down enough so that I really could have used the whole amount.  I highly recommend this recipe.

YUM!! I thought this was quite good and I am so glad I tried it! I didn't have time to let it sit overnight and it's still yummy right out of the oven. I bet it'll be even better tomorrow. I diced up some poblano peppers instead of green chiles and I sauteed them with the onion and mushrooms. I also used wheat flour to try to keep it a little healthier and it's great! I mashed up the little lumps of flour as much as I could and everything turned out wonderful! Thanks for the recipe!

Great Great.  Cooked this for weekly morning managers meeting.  Got great reviews and very easy to make.  Even for a bachelor who doesn't cook much.  I added a half of a diced fresh jalapeno and some cubed ham.  Prepared the night before and was easily finished the next morning.  Great and easy recipe even for a cooking novice!!!

I prepared this the night before and popped it in the oven this morning for a Christmas breakfast.  Knowing that some family members dont care too much for mushrooms, I left out the mushrooms and replaced them with potato.  I baked one large potato, let it cool, diced it and added it to the egg mixture to sit over night.  Turned out great.

I chose this egg and sausage casserole to serve at Christmas brunch. I opted to use egg substitute and was very pleased with the result. Prepare the night before and pop it in the oven. Yummy and easy to serve too.

Yummy, very light and fluffy. Only used 1 can of green chiles, and used 6 green onions (as that was what was in the bunch that I bought, and didn't want to waste) Although I thought this needed more texture to it, maybe I'll try adding some finely shredded hashbrowns as a top layer.

HUGE HIT!  Brought this to an overnight July 4th party.  I was asked to bring it every year.  I made it with lowfat evertyhing - cheese, egg beaters, smart balance butter, microwaved the sausage for a minute to get the fat out - they had no idea.  Next time I'm using turkey sausage.

A great hit on Christmas morning. My kids want more!  I did not include mushrooms. I will make this ahead so they can warm the leftovers before heading off to school.  A nice change from the cold cereal routine. Very easy!

This is a favorite with my friends and family.  Even my non-egg-eating mom requests this casserole.  It's a different take on the breakfast casserole so many people make.  Especially good with some salsa, as the green chiles give it a different kind of flavor.

Good but dough mix doesn't really mix into egg mix and comes out with lumps of dough in places. These lumps are not very good. Next time will try without dough mix.

We really really liked this egg dish. I used one full pound of hot sausage and then cut the chillies to one can. I used a total of 8 oz cheese, half sharp cheddar and half co/jack. I like that it was made the night before. I also made one with bacon and green pepper rather than the sausage and mushroom and it turned out yummy too. The only thing I was not crazy about was that the flour mixture was a bit difficult to incorporate. I wonder if I added the flour to the eggs and then just mixed int he butter it would be easier. All in all a good egg casserole that is not runny in the middle and much easier to make than a crusted quiche.

I tried this recipe, for brunch,  on the morning after our RV Football tailgating party and everyone loved it.  I made a few changes and added a little to spice it up.  I used eggbeaters instead of eggs, I used 1/2 pound shredded Pepper Jack chesse and 1/2 pound Monterey and Chedder mixed, and I used a can of Rotelle tomatoes instead of green chilies. HMMMMM Good.

Excellent.  I added 1/2 yellow onion, chopped, to the green onion/mushroom mixture; I baked this for about an hour.  Everyone raved about it. I served it with salsa and sour cream.  I would definitely make this again and I will try it with Eggbeaters instead of eggs.

This was delicious!  Made it for Thanksgiving breakfast and everyone loved it!  I cut down on the cheese a lttle and probably could have used even less.  I used an 8 oz. package of cubed peppper jack cheese and 4 oz. of sharp cheddar.  I think the cubes would have been enough.  Was afraid there would be too many chiles but both cans were fine.  Will definitely make this again.  My flour mixture was a little lumpy but it did not seem to matter.
