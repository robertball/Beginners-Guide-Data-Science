I love the fresh flavor of this simple salad, and the ginger makes it special. I have also made it without the ginger for young children. This is one for my recipe box because  I need to be reminded to make it often. Add some nuts for a variation.

Nothing fancy here, just a simple little carrot salad that has a nice blend of ginger and OJ.  This is so low cal, low fat, and low carb that I can see keeping this on hand as a snack in between meals.

Candied ginger overpowered everything and it needed a creamier texture.  I'll stick to my standard. Maybe use a bit of ginger powder and some mayo or yogurt.
