Basic salad recipe.  Not a keeper though...see Greek Pasta Salad I which is also on allrecipes.  It is a more flavourful version of this recipe.  Exactly the same except with more tasty stuff in it.

I really enjoyed this. I had a family member over for dinner who didn't like mushrooms, so I left them out and used diced cucumber instead. I also chopped kalamata olives. I tried cutting back on the oil, because it looked like a lot, but I would use the full amount next time I make it. It might also benefit from using a little lemon juice in place of some of the vinegar, but all around really good as is. Thanks Kelly.

Very good base recipe. I read some of the other reviews and followed what they did. I made this for a corporate luncheon for 40 people. I substituted a few things. I used cheese tortelini, red onions instead of green onions, added some green peppers and reduced the amount of mushrooms and used pitted kalamata olives instead of canned black olives. It got rave reviews. People were scooping it into paper cups to take home. Definitely one to make again and try more variations.

I run a small catering business with my sister, and we've used this recipe twice now - both times we rec'd rave reviews.  The only thing I do differently is use fresh spices as opposed to dried - really kicks up the flavor!

Ok, so I changed this recipe so much that it barely looks like the original. But I had to review it because I got such great ideas from the recipe and the other reviewers. I added just about everything I could find in my fridge: artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, pepperoni, pepperoncini peppers, cucumber, red onion, diced pimentos, and a few shreds of leftover carrot. With all the additions, it made the biggest batch of pasta salad I have ever seen, but I have no doubt that we will finish it in a few days. I did stick with just 8 oz of pasta and that was enough for my huge batch. And I only added 1/3 c each of red wine vinegar and EVOO. I probably could add a touch more vinegar, but overall this is awesome! I can't get enough of this salad!

I didn't have time to make up the desssing, so instead I just used Kraft Greek With Fetta and Oregano dressing. Really tasty. Added a bunch of chopped garlic as well as a little red onion, a yellow pepper, and a cubed cucumber. Really any combo of fresh crip veggies would go though probably.

This was fabulous!  The seasonings work well together; this is so much better than any pasta salad I've ever made. The only things I changed were to reduce the amount of vinegar and oil to 1/4 cup each and the seasonings to 1 tsp each.  Otherwise it makes too much dressing.  Also, I don't like mushrooms so I used cucumber and orange bell pepper instead.  Delicious!

Amazing salad!  It's definitely one you can cater to your own personal tastes - I used balsamic vinegar, cut down on the oil and vinegar to 1/4 c. each, used artichoke hearts, and omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them raw.  It turned out fabulous!

I find that what you put in a Greek Pasta is fungible; it's the dressing that's make-or-break. And this dressing really delivers that classic Greek dressing flavor.

fantastic made it just like the recipe said and this one is a keeper!

Update: just made this again but added a can of chick peas/garbanzo beans for extra fiber. FANTASTIC! Next time I may sub sun-dried tomatoes for cherry tomatoes and add some red bell pepper and/or chopped cucumbers.

Good recipe but there's too much vinegar in the dressing, it's very sour. I used 1/4 cup vinegar the second time I made this salad and it was great! Make sure to refrigerate this for at least a couple of hours before serving.

Fabulous! Took some time chopping all the veggies, but it was a great recipe. And it makes a lot! There was a nice blend with the olive oil and the vinegar, neither one really overpowered the other. Fun, colorful pasta salad to make for the summer when it's so hot outside. I forgot to add the Feta cheese at first, and only remembered after our first helpings were eaten, however, the second helpings were even better. Looking forward to leftovers of this tomorrow. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This is a nice greek pasta salad. I subbed cucumbers for the mushrooms. I'm very sad to say that I am out of green onion and I don't have red onion to sub for it. But still very good, I just add the oil and vinegar to taste.

Great!  I cut back the oil and vinegar to 1/3 cup of each and added cucumbers, fresh spinach, and used kalamata olives and less mushrooms....but in general a tasty dressing recipe and then use the veggies you prefer/have available.

This was really tasty salad but I would not suggest chilling it for hours! I ran cold water over the noodles while straining so they weren't so hot and after mixing it all together I tried a bite and it was sooo good so I was really excited for others to try it..it was in the fridge for a little over 2 hours (not much) and all the dressing that was in the bottom got soaked up in the noodles and it changed their texture and made the salad very dry :(  but it was so good at first so next time I'm going to serve it within 20 minutes of making.

this was the exact recipe i needed for a base to start my own pasta salad. first of all, i loved that there was no mayonnaise involved, just oils and vinegars and seasoning(which made it great for summer, not everyone is a hot mayonnaise fan!) i used a 16oz. box of pasta and with just a little more here and a little more there the dressing was more than sufficient. i indeed added artichoke hearts and pepperoni and discovered that adding just a little bit of the juice from the artichoke heart can added lovely flavor. i topped it with extra dried basil and oregano which was excellent. it was so easy to just add what i wanted. A+

Excellent pasta salad!! I used 2 cups uncooked brown rice elbow pasta, added cucumber, and omitted the onion. Also as another reviewer suggested I cut the oil and vinegar in half to 1/4 cup of each and it was plenty!   I didn't have enough feta cheese so I added some soft goat cheese.  It turned out delicious!!!  thanks

This recipe is definitely a good "jumping off point."  I made the following changes:  1/4 c each olive oil and vinegar (which was PLENTY!); only 1 tsp each of garlic powder, basil, and oregano (was still pretty garlicky); no mushrooms (I don't like raw mushrooms); 1 vine-ripened tomato (instead of cherry tomatoes); 1/2 c sliced olives from my grocer's olive / antipasto bar (half seeded kalamata, half garlic green olives); added 1 green bell pepper and 1 lg marinated artichoke heart (also from the antipasto bar), both chopped.  I also used 4 oz reduced-fat feta (whether it was 3/4 cup or not, I don't know...).  Oh man was this awesome!!  It was such a great, filling - but light meal after my evening workout!  I will definitely make this again!

This was the first time I'd ever made Greek pasta salad, so I was pretty nervous about making it. There was an upcoming potluck that my friend was throwing and I wanted to try something that was tasty, quick, and not too expensive to make. After following the recipe to a T (Actually I doubled the serving size but that doesn't count as 'tweaking' the recipe). I let a friend of mines sample the finished product. She took a bite, looked at me, then snatched the bowl and walked off with it. Her exact words were, 'This *bleep* is good!". That poor pasta salad didn't stand a chance and so it has been added to my recipe box for good. Super Yummy!

I have been making this salad for a couple years.  It is my favorite pasta salad, and everyone always gobbles it up.  I don't care much for mushrooms and olives so I omit those and use cucumbers and red peppers instead.  So yummy!

Wow - this was an incredible salad!  I doubled the batch and it fed us for ages.  The dressing was especially tasty since it didn't fade as the salad stayed in the fridge.  (Usually, pasta salad seems to absorb the dressing overnight.)  I added big chunks of cucumbers and extra tomatoes.  Next time, I plan to get the good olives at the deli rather than using canned olives.  They really are tastier.

Thanks to the original poster for this awesome recipe!

This salad was a hit at a family picnic.  I made it a day ahead, but didn't add the feta cheese until right before serving. Delicious!

This recipe was FABULOUS!  The only greek food I've ever had before was a greek salad (at an italian restaurant, of all places) and I fell in love with it.  I've never attempted to make anything Greek before, and I must admit, I couldnt' even wait for it to chill before I tried it, and I *loved* it!!  I will definitely make this again.  I didn't cut the oil or the vinegar, as some suggested, because I used 13 oz. whole wheat rotini noodles (they're healthier than white, and you can't taste a difference!!), and I mixed my other ingredients together while the rotini was cooking.  All in all, this is a great dish*.  

*My hubby didn't like it, but he only likes meat and potatoes, so he doesn't count, haha

This has SO much potential! But the 1/2 c of red wine vinegar absolutely killed it.The rest of the ingredients were delightful together. I even substituted sun dried tomatoes for the fresh ones and that was really good.

This pasta salad is simply fantastic. I like it the way it is written or I like to substitute 1 Cup of Kraft Greek dressing for the liquid. I use lot's of Feta cheese and prefer red onion to green onion :)

Terrific!  I made this with orzo (that's what I had on hand) and added some fresh chopped spinach and arugula.  I cut the red wine vinegar and olive oil in hald, but that's just personal preference.  This was a big hit!

I did make this the night before. I added some additional Red wine vinegar. About another tablespoon and 1/2 teaspoon salt. I also added a cucumber. I did not add the pepperoni and feta cheese until I was about ready to serve it. We had out of town guest and they loved it.

mmmm...this salad is delicious.  My only reccomendation...do not put the mushrooms in the bowl before the other ingredients.  They will absorb the red wine vinegar.

Easy to make.  Didn't bother with the olives because I hate the taste.  I think the green onions were a bad idea, they added a bitterness to the salad that I didn't like.  Aside from that, pretty good.  Next time, I'll nix the onions.  Definitely needs to stay for more than 2 hours for the mushrooms to soften and soak up the flavor.  I would recommend overnight.

This is great for the starving college student because it easy to make, takes no reheating since its cold, and can be saved to eat everyday for a week! Plus, its somewhat healthy and low cal. It is strong on the vinegar, but I like vinegar, so I followed the recipe. I used half as many black olives and it still seemed like plenty. Thanks so much for this one!

Very good pasta!  I made this for a bridal shower and got many compliments.  I added about 1/8 c more olive oil to counter too much red wine vinegar and used garlic salt instead of garlic powder for more taste.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

I have used this recipe the past few years. It is one of my staple go-to recipes. Tonight I’ll dice a baked seasoned chicken breast to add to it. Makes a full supper with some extra protein.

I love this recipe. When it starts to get warm out I make a large amount and eat it for a quick dinner right out of the frig. The only thing I changed is I don't put any mushrooms in the dish. They don't hold up for more than a day and get old and nasty if you are making it ahead of time.

I am relatively new to cooking but after preparing this simple salad I am keen to learn more recipes.

The salad was easy to make, I actually made a few changes - I used Red Onion instead of Green and I also changed the mushroom to cucumber as I am not too keen on raw mushrooms.

As soon as I added the red wine vinegar, olive oil and spices it was a magical infusion and a delight to the senses.  Such an easy salad to prepare - but it impresses the socks off people when I take it to someone's place to go with dinner.  Great especially for Hot Weather.

This pasta salad is SO GOOD!  Even my husband likes it, and he picky. The salad is good if you follow the directions but I really like a lot of flavor so I added a little move olive oil & vinegar, extra tomatoes & bell pepper...I might add a little red onion the next time I make it.    Probably next week!! :) It is better the second and third day! Makes a great fast lunch! THANKS SO MUCH!!! ~Jill

I really didn't care for this dish, and neither did my husband. It was dry and bland.

We really enjoyed this pasta salad. I used red bell pepper instead of tomato because my family doesn't like tomato.  I also added a little extra olive oil just before serving to make it a little moister.  We will make this again!

This is a great recipe!  I was able to chop the veggies while the pasta was cooking.  I also added cooked chopped shrimp and substituted greek olives for the black olives.  This is a very easy summer-time dish.

Very easy and very delicious and impressive looking!!! Can't beat that combination. I followed the directions exactly except that I used only half of the mushrooms. A definite keeper. Thank you for the recipe!!

This was a great recipe, although a did tweak it a bit. I left out the mushrooms & added artichoke hearts & roasted red peppers. I used a 1/2 cup of Girards Greek Feta Vinegarette Dressing instead of the oil & vinegar.  I didnt have to add any salt or any of the seasonings that way. I also chopped a little bit of red onion & garlic and added it as well. It tasted great, but even better the next day!

This was good. My mistake was letting it sit too long in the fridge. Overnight probably is the limit.

this is a GREAT recipe~~ I did not add the cherry tomatoes or the mushrooms. I did add chopped red bell-peppers though. I also switched the black olives for pitted calamata olives cut in half. I also added extra feta cheese (as this IS the best part!!).... it was WONDERFUL!!! thanks for the recipe!

I think this is great - i use infornate olives and sliced em myself, tri colored rotini, probably more feta than recommened, slightly less oil/vineager than recommended, and sliced the onions longwise (??), and the 2nd time got it to my best liking.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a big hit! Several people asked for the recipe. I made a double batch without mushrooms the morning of the shower and it was delicious for the afternoon party!

Great recipe! I didn't have red wine vinegar so I just added some red wine that I had sitting around, which worked very well! I also added chopped red bell peppers.

So cool and delicious!  I liked how easy not mixing a separate dressing.  Will make this often this summer.

This recipe is sooooo easy, my son needed to bring in a Greek recipe for a school project (one that everyone would eat).. This was a hit, we put it together the night before and it was a great success.. I did increase the feta cheese by 1 cup and I also added the rest of the grape tomatoes that were in the container (10 extra)..Next time I may scale down the vinegar a bit if making for home.. In the morning, I gave it a good stir and off to school he went with his expanded to 20 servings Greek Salad..Thanks for the recipe and other tips.. :)  Have a great day!!!

This is an excellent pasta salad. The only change I made was putting in half the red wine vinegar it called for, but that's just because I'm not a huge fan of vinegar. Great recipe, thanks!
