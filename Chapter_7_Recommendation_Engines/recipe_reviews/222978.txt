I absolutely LOVED this!  I didn't have cumin but used all the other ingredients as written. Incredible and will make this spicy dish again!

I have made this twice and I didn't change a thing since my family loved it!  I was worried about cooking it in a 450 degree oven but the rub actually creates a nice crust on the outside leaving the inside extremely juicy.  So easy and delicious!

Didn't change a thing.  The rub was a perfect compliment for the pork tenderloin that was so tender and tasty.  Will have again and again.

I doubled the recipe since I had a 6# pork loin. This recipe is a winner. We barely made a dent in the pork loin, so I sliced the rest and put 3 slices in a zip lock bag. I had about 8 bags and put them in the freezer. I have been eating pork loin almost daily since. It makes a great breakfast burrito with a little salsa, shredded cedar cheese, scrambled eggs all wrapped up in a flour tortilla.

I didn't think anything this easy would taste so good. Didn't have Goya Adobo All Purpose seasining w/Pepper,so I substituted regular seasoned salt with 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Other than that kept everything else the same. Really good,really quick. I will definately get the Goya seasoning next time and see if it makes a discernable diffence.

We made this almost exactly as is except we only had golden brown sugar rather than dark, so we put about 1 1/2 teaspoons of it in instead, and we substituted half of the chili powder for paprika because we're not a big fan of spicy things. This turned out amazingly juicy and super flavorful and we would make this again for sure!

I made this recipe based on the 5 star reviews, but I was not a fan. I was expecting something sweet and smokey, but it was so spicy (and I like spice) it was overwhelming.  this was not good. On the other hand, the high cooking temp for a short period of time was fantastic. The loin really did come out perfectly, and super moist, so thanks for the wonderful cooking technique!

Just made this tonight, though I had to replace the chili powder with paprika since I have a preschooler who doesn't enjoy spicy food. This was GREAT and, get this -- my son ate it up! Everyone loved it, it was fast and delicious...do yourself a favor and make this for dinner!

This is a 10 star recipe! I made it exactly as written except my roast was 2 1/2 lbs and I cooked it uncovered for 45 minutes. Then tented it with foil as written for 10 minutes. The roast was so very moist and so perfectly flavored! I dipped each sliced piece in the pan drippings before serving! Not spicy at all and with a slight hint of cinnamon. We totally loved this! I will be making this many more times in the near future!

This was a nice recipe and we loved the seasonings! Our pork didnt come out very tender though.  I think next time I will try cooking a little longer at lower heat. Will try again though!

Just made it and it turned out fantastic! It's really easy and really fast for a pork roast! Great flavor. Great alternative to the crock pot too.

I made it as written half a dozen times and it always comes out delicious. I was nervous to roast it at such high temp but it did not dry out. I left it in the oven 45 minutes the first time thinking there was no way it would be done after 35; I was wrong. 35 minutes plus resting time is all you need unless you want to dry out the pork. It's actually reheats nicely if you slice it and let it "marinate" in the au jus. The flavors are amazing, it's quick and easy to prepare and clean up is a breeze. It's in our regular rotation, in my mom's regular rotation, and my sister's too.

After following the recipe for the rub, it didn't seem like enough to me, so I added another tablespoon of adobo. I'm glad I did, I think the balance was perfect.  I didn't use Goya brand, but made my own from "Traci's Adobo Seasoning" also on this site. Very good stuff.  I loved this, the slight hint of cinnamon and deep flavors of all those herbs and spices was warm and satisfying. The sugar and high oven temperature made for a lovely dark caramelized roast. This will be a regular around my house.

Beautiful, flavourful, moist. Best pork dish I have ever made, or eaten. The only changes I made were that I used Traci's Adobo Seasoning from this site, and grape seed oil. Oh, and I bbq'd it. Best ever!

Had a 3.5 lb loin so cooked 17 min per pound and was perfect. Increased ingredient portions. This was easy and hubby and kids ate it up.

Made recipe according to directions, except for turning the heat down to 350 for the last 15 minutes. Although the pork was tender and juicy, I found the rub extremely salty for our tastes. Would try this recipe again and reduce Adobo seasoning to ½ tablespoon to see if that helps.

This is the best pork loin I have ever had much less cooked!  It was so juicy and flavorful!  I made it exactly as the recipe read other than having to Google and make my own Adobe Seasoning. I prepared the entire dish early in the day and let it marinate in the rub. When it came time to cook supper I simply put it in the oven and prepared my sides.  It went well with the Spicy Strawberry Salad also from this site and Quinoa. Easy clean up too! Definitely a keeper!  Can hardly wait for the leftovers.

This is a great recipe, simple, quick, and really good.  The only change I made was to only put in 1 tablespoon of chili powder and then put in 1 tablespoon of a good smoky paprika.  I was pretty sure the 2 tablespoons of chili powder would be too spicy for our tastes.
was
Other than that (and maybe a bit of garlic in the mix) I made it as directed.  It cooked up just fine in 35 minutes.  I have leftovers that I sliced, put into a container and poured the remaining juices over them.  Those slices will make awesome sandwiches tomorrow.
I like this rub so much I made up a container of it (minus the olive oil) so I can have it quickly on hand for next time.  I served the roast with brown rice and curried squash, and the meal was a great hit.

When I lived in Las Vegas I would go to this Mexican Fast Food place. I would order the "Adobo Pork" plate. This is the closest I have come to that taste.

My family and I absolutely loved this recipe! The flavors all blend together so nicely and uniquely - not overly spicy, not overly sweet - and I loved the hint of cinnamon. I did turn the oven down to 350 after about 20 minutes or so, to ensure the outside didn't burn.

Perfect! I made my own Adobo seasoning (Traci's Adobo Seasoning found on this site), and it was the best pork loin I've ever had!

this was a very nice rub for my three 8 oz boneless pork chops that we were planning on grilling.. i scaled this down to 3 servings and used the following measurements: 1 tsp chili powder (since others said it overpowered everything), 2 tsp adobo seasoning, 1/2 tsp black pepper (because my seasoning was the kind w/o), 1 tsp cumin, left out the brown sugar (since we don't like sweet), and 1/16 tsp of cinnamon.. i still had about half the amount of rub leftover and didn't want to cake it onto the chops, worrying it'd make it too strong, salty, or something to that effect--especially since this was my first time cooking with adobo seasoning.. i figure i'll add more cinnamon to what's left over in my shaker and try this out again.. ty for the recipe

This was delicious! I had a six pound pork sirloin so I doubled the recipe and cooked about an hour.   Boyfriend loved it too! Will make again for sure! Think I'll try the rub on chicken next time.

I bought the pork loin and Adobo seasoning, then followed the recipe exactly. I love spicy food and I was expecting a little more heat. Instead I got an overwhelming taste of salt and chili powder. Had to scrape off the coating in order to eat the roast which was very tender. This just didn't work for me

Just made this for dinner and it was delicious!  I can't believe that something that was so easy to put together, and took very little time to cook, could turn out so tasty!  The rub formed a nice crust on the pork loin and the flavor just permeates the meat.  We will be making this again in the future, a big hit in our house!

Wow, this marinade is awesome...I almost never follow a recipe to the T, but this one I did!  I am a savory, spicy girl, so I was hesitant to add the brown sugar and cinnamon, but I am so glad I did...it was amazing...what a wonderful flavor combination!

Very quick, easy, and delicious!  I used another reviewer's suggestion to use 1 T. of chili powder and 1 T. of paprika, and that was plenty spicy for our family.  We poured the juices over the meat and mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again!

I made this pretty much exactly by the recipe (except I cooked it for 40 minutes instead). It came out amazing. My roommate doesn't like spicy food, so I was worried, but it's not spicy at all. She has been begging me to make it again. I'm not much of a cook, but this recipe is ridiculously easy, and probably fairly foolproof since mine came out well.

Wow!  This turned out moist and tender and oh, so yummy!  I don't know if this happens to every loin but mine was really two long pieces of meat not one. I didn't have any string to keep it together so I just let one half kind of fall to one side of the other.   I took 10 minutes off the cooking time and it came out perfectly.   Definitely will be making this again!

Never made pork roast before.  Needed something quick.  Loved the timing option.  My husband is Puerto Rican so he loves Adobo.  I didn't have the kind with pepper so I just added pepper.  No other "changes" made.  NOT spicy at all!  Our 1 year old son loved it as well.  Came out medium rare in the middle - husband recommended 40 min in oven next time instead of 35 min (and yes we did rest for 15 min before slicing).  Super moist and tender.  I usually over cook pork so this was quite the feat for me to accomplish it so well.  Thank you for the recipe.  I have saved it and will make again.

Tender and delicious pork following the recipe as written with the exception of brining the pork first.  Vacuum-sealed the leftovers to wait in the freezer for next time I make chili!

This recipe is so good I quadrupled it, put it in a jar to create this roast faster & to use on other meats. I did make one change; I only use 1 t Goya instead of T. as we are on a low-sodium diet. I've made it at least four times and love it.

Perfect. I cooked it at 350 for about the same time , let it rest and it was great. Make sure you tent it and let it rest for 15 minutes. Into your recipe box with this one!

This was fantastic! I am so glad I tried this since my 3 kids kept raving about it & my 8 yr old didn't even want any condiments, which was a first. I did cut down on the chili powder since my youngest can't handle too much spice and I brined the pork for 2 hours first which made it super tender. Other than that I followed the recipe. This will definitely go into the rotation. Thanks Goya!

We made it just as described and it was delicious. It had the spice of chili and cumin but wasn't so hot that it burned. The juices from the roasting pan also made a great sauce.

Very disappointed in this recipe. Directions to cook for 35 minutes at 425 didn't even begin to bring the internal temperature to the 145 degrees needed. It was charred on the outside from the high temperature burning the "rub" and from having to cook this for so long to get it to the internal temperature.

This was easy and good!  I've been having a run of over-cooking my pork; when you make it, be sure to check the temperature at the given time and remember about carry-over cooking (the meat keeps cooking after you remove it from the oven)!

Made this for the first time for company coming! It was wonderful. Perfect tenderness.Everyone had at least seconds, even my 4 little ones. I made cheesy hashbrown casserole to go along with it. Can't wait to make it again.

I made this with a 3 lb roast, so I made one and a half times the rub substituting light brown sugar for dark and half the chili powder for smoked paprika. I was afraid just using chili powder would be too hot for some of my family members.  They though it was perfect this way, with just the right amount of kick and not too hot. I also decided to soak my pork in a brine for about 2-3 hours, then drying the meat off with paper towels before adding the rub. The brine was 1 T salt dissolved per cup of water.  It took 5 cups water to cover my pork loin. Placed in a covered dish in the fridge. This was to make sure my pork stayed moist. 

As far as cooking, my 3 lb pork loin when I took it out of the package was in reality two 1.5 lb pork loins.  So I wasn't exactly sure about the cooking time.  I had read where someone had posted to cook 17 mins per pound, so I figured about 26 mins for the smaller loins.  I used a meat thermometer and left them in for 29 mins.  After resting the meat 10 mins before slicing, it was slightly pink inside.  But we decided we were fine with that.  The meat was so tender, you could cut it with your fork.  There was plenty of juice in the dish to spoon over the slices on your plate.

My daughter said it was her favorite pork she'd ever had.  We're having it again tomorrow for leftovers and I'm inviting my son and his wife to dinner.

This was very easy to make and I'll be making it again.

Excellent!  Made it just as described. My pork loin was two pieces that added up to 2 lbs. pork tenderloin. Was probably cooked a little too long at 45 minutes. Delicious, tender, not even too spicy. Just really good. Thank you for this recipe!

Tasted great! Excellent when cold and thinly sliced the next day.  The Goya Adobo is quite salty though. Will consider making my own next time. All in all, fast easy and delicious, especially considering no marinating time is necessary.

Absolutely delicious.  First time I’ve ever made a pork roast, although I love them.  Such a great flavor.  Salty, but sweet.  A definite keeper!

I had to try to make a loin that wasn’t dried out. This recipe did the trick!  I love Adobo & Sazon with pork. I rubbed these both generously & let the roast sit wrapped in the fridge overnight. I mixed olive oil, the cumin, cinnamon and brown sugar today, rubbed it over the top of the roast & followed cooking directions. Delicious, moist, tasty, not overly sweet at all. I’ve got a lot left, so I sliced it thin & it’s sitting in the juices for now. I’ll make up small packets to freeze tomorrow.  Thanks for this recipe!

Whipped this loin recipe up for dinner tonight. Loin was tender and juicy and had great flavor. Just a little bit of a kick but nothing a 4-year old couldn’t handle. Paired it with yellow rice and mixed vegetables.

This was a great mix of sweet and spice! I had to sub in curry powder instead of cumin for the adobo seasoning mixture, but it turned out great all the same. Will definitely make again and use the cumin to get the flavor. 3 people and not a slice left!

I made this exactly by the recipe.  I thought 35 minutes to bake had to be incorrect, but I pulled from the oven as directed.  When I served it my husband just sighed.  It was positively delicious!  Seasoned perfectly!  THANKS!  A REAL KEEPER!

Excellent pork loin recipe and delicious flavor in the meat—but don’t overcook it. Because it cooks at 450, it was easy to throw some roasted veggies in the oven to cook at the same time. We’ll definitely have this easy-to-make dish again.

Simply delicious!  Just enough spice to make it memorable,  be certain to save the drippings and use later after you've re-heated the sliced meat for sandwiches!  Everyone in the office wants me to make it again!!

I made this just as written and my family loved it. Even husband, who admitted he doesn't  usually like pork loin, said it was the only way he has liked it. Looking at the amount of spices I didn't think it would be enough to cover the loin, but it was perfect.

WOW WOW WOW! So easy to make, I cooked it for about 40 mins and it was perfectly juicy but the rub made such a nice little layer on the outside that was packed with unique flavor! I served it with a side of brown rice (and upon serving I used the left over juices from the meat to pour over the rice) and steamed some brussel sprouts... It was delicious!!!

This was awesome. I used pork loin I had cut into 1 inch thick slices. Didn’t get a chance to crust in thre oven due to the lack of thickness, but, woof!  It was awesome, not too spicy at all. Will definitely make again!!

I made exactly as written. Like most people, I don't see why people rate it having changed it. The meat was tender and moist but way too salty for me (and I'm a salt lover). I will make it again but reduce the Adobo seasoning a lot. I would give it a 5 with less salt.

I just made this for my family and accidentally put a full tablespoon of cumin and brown sugar, instead of teaspoons. But, it tamed the spicy a bit, which is ok with me and the family loved it and the husband ranted over how good it was!! So easy! Will make again!!

I made this wonderful recipe using every ingredient. I never measure I just mix to my own liking. It was a hit. I am making it again for my co-workers. I am a spice head and it is not that spicy to me but, the flavors are a lovely combination and the smell of it cooking will drive you crazy. Serve with home-style mashed potatoes.

This was an amazing recipe.  I followed the  directions except for one: when I preheated the oven to 450 I also placed my cast-iron skillet inside and let it preheat with the oven.  By using the cast-iron skillet instead of a roasting pan,  it  only took less then 20 min to get to the desired temperature.

I loved it. I didn't have Adobe seasoning and am on a low sodium diet so I used Mrs dash with 1/2 teas garlic and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. I had an oven thermometer and set it to 165. I don't know how long it took but when it reached 145 degrees I took it out of the oven and  tented it like the recipe said to. it came out very tender and juicy.

This was really good.  I had a giant (#7) loin I got at Costco which I cut in 1/2 or so and cooked.  This was very tasty, although it was hard to get the center cooked without overcooking the thinner edges.

I made this, and the kids loved it! I added cinnamon to the seasoning and made my own Adobo seasoning off an Internet recipe. I couldn't find the Goya or style seasoning anywhere. Turned out awesome, and will be a repeat dinner for years to come. Thank You

I will make this again. I used Traci's Adobo seasoning recipe that's on here.  I also rubbed my pork loin with honey before adding seasoning to it. I was afraid of cooking it on 450, but it turned out awesome!!! It will now be in rotation at my house.

Excellent! Even my picky eater commented it was good. The only issue I had was the cooking time. The loin I used was 2 lbs 4 oz, but it was pretty thick. I should have kept it in the oven another 10 minutes to get to the correct temp.

I made the rub exactly as described in the recipe. But I used my outdoor wood-fired grill with mesquite pellets instead of cooking it in the gas oven in the kitchen. The result was an exceptional,  moist, slightly smoky flavored pork roast. I am looking forward to making this simple recipe many more times in the future.

Excellent and very moist!! My husband said the best pork loin I've ever made.   Only change I made was I only used half of the chili powder since I do not like spicy foods.

I'm not the biggest fan of pork loin, but so far this has been the best recipe I've come across for it. I made it exactly as written. And it's good for a weeknight dinner too, easy prep and not too long cooking time. Thanks!

I used one tablespoon of paprika and one tablespoon of adobo, as some others had recommended. It was delicious! So moist and tender. I couldn't stop eating it.

Used light brown sugar and Goya Sazon instead of Adobo (what was in our cabinet since we were snowed in...) and it was still really good! Pork was really tender and flavorful.

Amazing!! So fast and easy, and came out perfectly! Very delicious and tender. My husband (who is typically not a fan of any type of roasts) raved about it until the next morning, and has already asked me to make it again soon. When serving the little kids, I cut off most of the outer crust, since it was a bit spicy for them- this didn't hurt my feelings at all because then I got to eat it! Will definitely make this again and again!

Roast Adobo Pork Loin Haiku: "My first Goya 'boooo.' Their brand never disappoints, TOO much cumin here." The most helpful 5-star review says that he or she didn't have cumin haha, and that is what killed this recipe for us. I love Goya products and have liked all of their branded recipes, but this was cumin overkill. I'd make it again with 1/2 tsp. cumin instead.

I modified this recipe some. Instead of using Goya I used my own blend of seasonings. Because I thought the loin would dry out I cooked it at 400 for 1 hr 30 mins. I should have cooked it covered up to keep the meat tender and moist.

I used a small boneless pork roast because that's what we had in the freezer.  It was about the same weight as the pork loin that was called for in the recipe.  I made it as directed except I DID swap out half the chili powder for paprika.  I thought this produced a well rounded balance of flavors.  It was delicious even reheated for lunch leftovers later in the week!

The rub kept the meat very moist but it was VERY salty. We had to scrap off the rub to not have a salt overload but after we did that it was very tasty.  I made one tweak because we don't like our food too spicy I substituted half the chili powder with paprika.

This is the best pork recipe. The meat is juicy and delicious. I will say if you aren't a big salt fan, this may be a bit salty for your tastes. I think the salt goes well with the meat and isn't too overwhelming. The high heat really keeps the pork moist. Five stars!

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except had a four pound roast.  So I doubled the sauce ingredients.  We loved it!  Only difference was the roast took much longer to cook, to my surprise since it was simply a longer roast rather than larger all over.  At any rate - went shopping especially for the adobo sauce and I am sure will use it many more times.

I love this pork recipe. It's easy and quick, and I usually have all the ingredients in my kitchen. Since I am cooking for one I use half the amount of pork loin, but  keep the same amount of rub because I love the flavour.  I also love that it cooks so quickly. Bonus - the pork makes GREAT quesadillas!  Chop the pork up and add to a tortilla with melted mozzarella and some guacamole, crema and whatever else you like. Yummy!

I put my pork loin in the crockpot with some apple cider vinegar and oil at the bottom of the pot. Turned out very yummy. We might turn some of the meat into pulled pork by adding bbq sauce, this recipe would be a good base for that too.

This is the only way I'll make my pork loin from now on! Followed the recipe exactly, The taste was amazing and the juiciest loin I've ever made. So flavorful and all with seasonings I had in my pantry. So easy to make and doesn't take forever to cook or marinate like other recipes.

This was absolutely delicious. So glad I decided to make it! I've never heard of Adobo before, but I was quite excited to see my grocery store carried it... It's sooo good. And really quick to make (which is a huge plus!)

I never use any kind of All Purpose Seasoning. Most of them are more salt than anything. I substituted with 1 tsp. garlic powder,  1/2 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. gr. blk. pepper and about an 1/8 tsp. salt.  Instead of 1 level tsp. cumin, I added a heaping tsp.  (There was cumin in the ingredients of the suggested seasoning.)
Also, I was afraid it would be too spicy, so I only used 1 Tbl. of Chili powder and 1 Tbl. Smokey Paprika. 
My roast was juicy and delicious and the outside was crusty and tasty!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used it on two pork tenderloins instead of the loin. I was going to initially leave out the cinnamon because I though for sure we'd hate it with that flavor but decided to make it as is before I modified and it turned out well. The cinnamon doesn't overpower it at all, it's very subtle. I made this with yellow rice, black beans and my homemade pickled red onions. We all enjoyed it!!

The 550 coating didn't work for me, just smoked up the kitchen. Still liked the taste though. I only used one Tbs chili powder and used 2 Tbs of brown sugar. Will definitely make again.

In general, the flavor was good but way too salty and spicy.  I made this exactly as stated and used it on a pork tenderloin that was 2.39 LBS.   I will try it again but will replace half of the chile powder with paprika and increase the brown sugar a bit.  The recommended cooking temperature and method worked well, giving the tenderloin a nice crust.

I love pork roast, but it usually doesn't turn out very well when I try to make it. This recipe looked good, so I tried it. As usual, it served more as inspiration than as gospel (why is it my roasts don't always work?)... The Adobo I had on hand was with cumin rather than with pepper, so I added pepper instead of cumin. I also added dried garlic as well as the garlic salt and used a bit of bbq sauce along with the olive oil and much less chili powder. To top it all off, I tossed it into my Showtime rotisserie instead of the oven. Took about 40 minutes plus 15 minutes on turn with no heat for the rest portion, and it came out delicious! No hesitation next time I see pork roasts on sale.

I had a 5lb pork loin so I cooked it for an hour and forty-five minutes on 350.   I put the rub on the night before and cooked it the next morning in a baking bag.  This loin was GREAT!  Tender and juicy with the right amount of flavor!..

I followed this recipe to the letter and it came out delicious. The only alteration was to the cooking time which had to be extended to just under 45 minutes to get the temperature to 145 degrees.  The key is to let the meat sit for the 10 minutes or so outside the oven under foil after cooking. The result is a juicy and flavorful dish which is definitely not too spicy if you can handle any heat at all. This will become part of my cooking rotation for sure.

WOW! Followed recipe as written. Lined pan with foil for easier clean up. Pork was tender and tasty, a nice spicy kick.  Would not feed to tender tummies.  My husband commented that it had a taco taste to it.  The next day, leftovers became a pork "taco salad".  The flavor and heat increased overnight.  The heat of the meat against the coolness of the greens was fantastic.  Will put this recipe into the rotation, with planned leftovers for a second meal.

Great taste and easy to make.  I used the Adobo spice recipe found elsewhere on this site and supplemented it with cumin (even though it's in the Adobo spice recipe) as well as the brown sugar and cinnamon. Served it with red potatoes which cook nicely in the same pan at the same temperature.  Also served it with a nice lightly-oaked chardonnay.

I have made this several times to rave reviews. I usually have to bake it a little longer than 35 minutes to achieve the 145 degree temperature. I was initially skeptical about the high temperature but it works well. The pork is very juicy and tender. I usually serve with Spanish rice and roasted vegetables in season (same 450 degree temperature while the roast is resting before slicing.

Loved this! I added just a little bit of asian chili oil to the olive oil when i mixed it together. Witch gave it a little after tingle of spice. Next time I would add more brown sugar to amp up the sweet n spicy taste experience. I made my own seasoning spices.

Awesome recipe! I didn't have Goya but I used ADOBO seasoning and added freeze dried chopped garlic, freeze dried chopped red onion and a smidge more brown sugar (I scopped out a mound instead of a flat portion).

Very juicy! Husband and toddler loved it!

I have never reviewed any recipes, but felt compelled to review this one as it is so fast, easy and GOOD! I've made for my family and company and everyone loves it, even my 2 year old! A little on the salty side but I found if you  don't use too much rub, it helps considerably as there is a ton of flavor in this.

I really loved this recipe. I would make this again but probably cut back a bit on the chili powder as it was too spicy for my 8 year old. Due to the rub being so savory, I took a can of guayaba (which is sweet), caramelized them in a saucepan, and put it to the side of the pork. I really enjoyed the flavor of the two.

It was way too spicy. Def too much chili powder. I think I would like a garlic rub or something better.

This was good, though mine ended up a little salty for I substituted regular seasoned salt for the Adobo pepper based on another reviewer.  I had a very large roast which I started at 450 degrees and then dropped it to 325 after about 10 minutes.  I was so tender this way.

This is a great recipe! When my family looked at the loin before cooking they all thought it was going to be over seasoned. But guess what they all loved it! Thanks.

I wondered about the cinnamon but made it as written, and my family loved it.  It was a little spicy for me, but I'm a wimp!  It was very juicy though-not much cooking time either.  This is now my husband's favorite pork recipe, although mine looked different than the original photo-it was much juicier than I expected, and that's a good thing!

I love this recipe! This is the first, and so far only, pork lion recipe that I can eat without bbq sauce! My husband loves it so I make it at least once a month and the left over pork makes delicious tacos!

My whole family, including kids aged 6, 9 and 13, LOVED this recipe. Pork was so flavorful and tender. Kitchen was a bit smoky, but that's a small price to pay for empty plates! Used the adobo seasoning mix recipe on this site. Kids helped me make it.  Keeper!

This was so good. My husband liked it and he is not a big fan of pork. I highly recommend trying it. It cooked up so tender in 35 minutes which was a truly pleasant surprise.

Very nice flavors. I used pork loin steaks instead of a whole roast this time. The amount covered 4 steaks just perfect. Thank you for sharing.
