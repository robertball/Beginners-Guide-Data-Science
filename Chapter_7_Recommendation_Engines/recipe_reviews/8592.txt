This was nice for something different but will stay a distant second from classic chicken salad, mostly because if you don't like Parmesan cheese (like hubs), basil or fresh, raw garlic,  you certainly won't like this. I love it all, but was glad I reduced the amounts of all three by nearly half. I loved the subtle flavors they contributed, but can't imagine using the full measurements called for! Not sure of what pureeing the celery was, but I did, but I also added some sliced celery as well for texture and crunch. I served this over Romaine lettuce leaves with hard boiled eggs and sliced tomatoes on the side and it made for a light, but satisfying lunch.

This was delicious!  I boiled 3 large bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts with some salt, garlic powder and bay leaves until nearly done.  I have a fear of overcooking chicken white meat, so I let the residual heat finish the cooking, and the meat was nice and moist.  I boned and skined the meat and cut it up small.  I chopped 2 of the celery stalks very finely and added them to the chicken, and pureed only one of the chopped stalks.  I also added chopped red onion to the puree as suggested by other reviewers, and used reduced fat mayonnaise and grated fresh Parmesana Reggiano.  I served the salad on sandwich sized croisants with sliced tomatoes, and this was nummy!  Much better than the run of the mill chicken salads with nuts and fruit.  I will definitely make this again and again.!

Sometimes the simplest recipes turn out to be some of the best! I love chicken salad and I had one leftover herb grilled chicken breast and some fresh basil in the fridge and didn't know what to make for lunch. What a pleasant surprise this little recipe turned out to be! I cut the amount of basil in half as well as the amount of celery. I put everything into the food processor along with a bit of onion powder. I used light mayo and light parmesan cheese to lighten it up and let this chill for an hour before serving. This chicken salad was creamy and delicious. It was perfect in a wrapped in a tortilla with romaine lettuce and tomato! Thanks for a really great recipe. I will definitely make this again!

Have made this several times and always get requests for the recipe.  I have added chopped red onion for texture and even bowtie pasta (for a party when I knew this wouldn't go far enough).  Even my kids (ages 4 & 2) love this.

This was so good!!  I used one-third sour cream, one-third mayo, and one-third cream cheese. I added chopped onion and roasted red pepper.  Now I'm making this for my graduation party!

YUM. I followed this recipe exactly except I skipped pureeing  (I LIKE stuff chunky). The full amounts of all the ingredients were not at all overpowering for us. I was a little worried about too much mayo, but I decided to go with my crazy idea of following the recipe and I was thrilled with the outcome. We had this on sourdough rolls with tomato and lettuce and it was lovely. Thanks for the recipe!

Just finished putting this together and it tastes wonderful!! I didn't puree the ingredients, I just mixed them all together and it's still absolutely delicious! I added an extra garlic clove for extra spice and used freshly grated romano cheese. I bet it'll taste even better once it sits in the fridge for a few hours!! Great recipe! :)

Everyone in my house loves this! I also have small kids, so I took another reviewer's suggestion of canned chicken one step further -- I bought a rotisserie chicken at the supermarket.  Good with white and dark meat.  So glad I found this.

WOW! This recipe was DELICIOUS! My kids and husband devoured what I made then asked for more.  I was nervous about the amount of mayo, but it was not an issue. Instead of using 2 whole chicken breast, I just kept adding meat to the mayo mixture until the consistency looked right. I added red onions to the puree as another member suggested and I omitted the celery (we're not big on celery). Fantastic on San Fransisco rolls, this recipe will stay in my collection.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Quick and easy to prepare. I had a leftover chicken breast from the night before and just chopped it up and added to the other ingredients. I didn't bother pureeing but next time I think I will. So nice to see a different kind of chicken salad that doesn't have the typical grapes or nuts thrown in.

This was pretty good!  I was concerned about the amount of mayo because I was afraid the salad would be too runny.  However, I used the full amount anyway, and once I pureed it with the other ingredients, it came out a great consistency.  The grated Parmesan really helps to soak up the excess moisture.  I chopped the chicken up pretty finely, and the end result was almost a paste-like consistency (but in a good way)--closer to the consistency of tuna salad than the usual chunky chicken salad.  I liked it.  My only criticism is that I really can't taste the chicken at all.  It's overwhelmingly Basil/Parmesan/Garlic.  It wasn't because I had bland chicken.  I used the breast of a rotisserie chicken, and the chicken was extremely flavorful.  It would have been nice for some of that flavor to come out in the salad, but it was totally overpowered by the other ingredients.  I think next time I'll try halving the amount of Parmesan and garlic.  I didn't even use the full amount of basil this time... just however much was in the little package I got from the store.  I may use less basil next time, too.  I think the ingredients would complement the chicken quite well, in less abundant quantities.

It was mixed reviews here and I think it always came down to the basil.  Seeing as that can be tweeked to taste, the consistancy was still good the next day, & the ease of making it...I would recomend it.

Amazing!  I love this recipe.  I completely forgot about the celery but otherwise made it as is.  It was perfect for our summer picnic.  Will definitely be making this again!

Wow! This was awesome! I didn't worry about exact measurements cuz I always improvise and it turned out fantastic! I added about a half teaspoon of dill because I like dill and I added some dried cranberries because I like the sweetness. 2 scallions I had on hand made their way into my sandwich too. MMMMMMMmmmmm...So good!

Yum-o! Made this for dinner tonight. My fiance plays softball on Fri. His games have been late in the eve. recently. When my fiance plays late, there is usually time for dinner, but it must be "light" (my fiance doesn't like to play on a full stomach). Janet's recipe fit the bill perfectly!!! My best description of this can be likened to pesto - fresh & slightly garlicky. I did make a couple of changes that may have contributed to the salad's pesto-like flavor. I added a very sm. yellow onion to my mayo (light variety / 1/2 c. worth) / celery / garlic / basil mix. and used 2 VERY large cloves of garlic (we love the stuff!). I used my little food chopper to pulse everything. This made for a slightly crunchy base (as opposed to using a fp). I set aside 2 chicken breasts earlier this wk. with the intention of making cajun chicken sandwiches (also on this site), but never got around to making them. I didn't want to waste good meat, so I seasoned both breasts with s&p and microwaved in an 850 watt oven for just a little under 10 min. I allowed everything to cool, chopped and added to my mayo mix. Perfect! Oh, and I splurged and bought fresh grated Parm (canned - yuck!). Served "sandwich-style" on artisan Tuscan herb formaggio bread (second splurge!) with a side of parmesan garlic pretzel chips and biscotti that I picked up at my local Italian market. So good! Thanks for sharing, Janet :)

I took this to school for lunches...and it was good.  I liked the combo of parmesan and basil...definately different.  I didn't puree the celery, instead I just chopped it, and I did reduce the mayo by about half because I wanted to taste the chicken not the mayo.  The second day I decided to add some red seedless grapes with white bread for a sandwich, and I really liked that sweet with the basil and parmesan.  Thanks for the post.

Loved this recipe! Didn't quite need all of the mayo mixture. The flavor was incredible and definitely the best chicken salad I've ever eaten. I too added some red onion for color and texture. Thanks Janet!!!!

Welcome to my new favourite recipe!  So easy and so good!  I did cut the basil in half as a few reviewers suggested.  And I pureed 1 1/2 stalks of celery with the mayo and basil, and finely chopped the other 1 1/2 stalks and added those to the mayo mixture at the same time as the chicken.  I also omitted the garlic, but that was just personal preference.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very good! Followed the recipe, but 2 stalks of celery pureed, one left chopped for crunch. Also added a touch of red onion as other reviewers have suggested. Yum! Restaurant quality. Will make again! May salt chicken less next time. DEFINITELY do not need to add salt to mixture.

One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Definitely the best chicken salad. So yummy! I didn't quite have a full cup of basil so added a little dried but otherwise followed exactly. Might consider slightly less mayo next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

I served this at my daughter's wedding reception on cocktail bread as a finger food. It was well received and I had several people ask for the recipe as well as requests from my husband to have it served again at home. GREAT recipe, and much better than the usual boring chicken salad!

In spite of the fact that I made changes, I think I stayed true to the main ingredients, and this salad was delicious. I used 2 cans of chunk chicken breast, reduced the mayo to about 1/2 cup & used part light mayo, omitted the celery (didn't have), used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, dry basil instead of fresh, and probably only added 1/3-1/2 cup of parmesan. I love the addition of parmesan--it really adds flavor. Served it on slices of Tasty Whole Wheat Bread from this site--a great sandwich!

This was excellent - I had leftovers from chicken vesuvio, and used fresh basil from my garden with fat free dressing. My husband loved it so much, I made another batch for lunches for the week right away!  I did chop the celery separate as recommended by others, and added some onion also.

Made this for lunch for three women friends, all asked for the recipe!  I chopped the celery and put it in the salad instead of pureeing it; added a little crunch.  It's a little different than your average salad, which is good.

A nice, fresh-tasting chicken salad, good on toasted wheat bread.  I tried reducing the amount of mayo to cut down on fat but it made the other flavors too strong, so I suggest you use the full amount.  It's good with light mayo, though.

Delicious! I'm eating it as a sandwich as I type this! I used canned chicken (quick meal with toddlers in tow) and had to sub. water chestnuts for the celery, but it is still wonderful. I will make this again!

I followed it as is, but I thought it had too much garlic, it was wonderful though, my family and neighbors loved this recipe. Next time I am only using one clove of garlic but I will make this recipe again and again!

The taste wasn't that great to me, plus there was not enough chicken.  I wouldn't make this again.

This is very yummy! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because the amount of mayo was too much. I actually used 3/4c mayo and 1/4 sour cream, however it was too creamy and I added an extra chicken breast and then it was perfect. I ended up chopping everything very finely b/c my food processor died. :-( It was delicious and will make again and again.

This was very good and different from the usual chicken salad. I used half nonfat yogurt and half light mayo to make it a little lighter sinceI was using dark meat. I slow cooked a couple of chicken legs on low for 6 hours the day before. I served it on homemade ww bread that I pulled out of the freezer. I would say grating your own parm takes this recipe from 4 stars to 5.

I didn't puree the ingredients for this and I never use full-fat mayo, but otherwise I made as directed. Ate it on a wheat bun as soon as I mixed it up and it was quite tasty...I imagine it will be even better after it chills a while. Thanks for a chicken salad that's different than my usual and one that gave me a chance to use some of my freshly-harvested basil!

This is fantastic!  We used leftover chicken from a roast chicken that we had the night before.  Our young children enjoyed it very much too.

I agree with others, do not puree. I like my celery crunchy and I did count down on the basil to 1/2 cup. I also used 2/3 cup mayo. I added a lil chopped onion, my preference. I did like the taste of cheese in it. Oh, I threw in some thyme. Thank you for sharing!

This has an excellent fresh taste to it. I substituted cucumbers for the celery, but didn't puree them, just diced them into the salad. It still had crunch but added another level of freshness.

This is such a great recipe for chicken salad! Even my picky-eater of a husband was asking for it for lunch.  I tried to save a bit of calories by halving the amount of mayo and topping it up with some plain yogurt.  It was just as creamy, but less fattening.

Very tasty. I buy my chicken for salads and appetizers at GFS where it comes fully cooked, diced and frozen.  Just thawed it out and added some Tastefully Simple Seasoned Salt to it and followed the instructions.  Served on a flaky croissant.  I taste tested a spoonful of it right after it was prepared and it wasn't great so I refrigerated it overnight and had it the next day....much better.  Definately needs to be refrigerated to make the flavors blend.  Will make again, maybe with some chopped apple or nuts added to it.

This was very good and an alternative to my classic chicken salad. I did not puree the ingredients. Added about one-half cup of toasted sliced almonds. I like a few crunchies in chicken salad. Great taste!

Packed with distinct flavors that are perfect when combined together as in this recipe. It's great in the summer. I have made it twice so far and it's always been a hit.

This is an excellent deviation from the normal chicken salad. I'm not a big fan of nuts & grapes in my chicken salad. The Parmesan is yummy, but I will add half as much garlic next time. Great Recipe!

This is delicious!  I used bone-in chicken breasts and diced the celery instead of pureeing it in the mayonnaise mixture; otherwise followed the recipe exactly!  Perfect for lunch on a hot summer day!

Delicious, but too runny and too garlic-y for us (and we are garlic lovers for the most part!). Next time, I will not put the mayo in the food processor, just stir it in and use less garlic. I added grated walnuts, tomatoes and lettuce and didn't use that much mayo. Also, I seasoned my chicken with quite a lot of spice before roasting (cayenne pepper, cumin, coriander, thyme and paprika) because we like things spicy.

Super, great, fabulous!!!  I will be making this many times. I didn't have any fresh basil but did add a splash of lemon juice. Then I got carried away and make pasta to add the chicken salad to. What a great dinner. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe, but I didn't think it was that good.  The grated Parmesan cheese made it taste very salty (and this is coming from a cheese lover!)  It wasn't overwhelmingly creamy, but I think I would have preferred if it were less creamy, and heavier on the celery and chicken.  It's a good start, but I think this recipe needs work in order to be an amazing chicken salad.

I loved this! A nice change from the classic chicken salad.Very good flavor! It was a little runny after putting it through the food processor but I mixed it with the chicken and kept it in the fridge for a few hours and it was fine. I left the celery out of the processor and just put it right in with the chicken. I also added some chopped almonds and some cranberries. Will make again for sure! Thank you for sharing.

Oh, it was good.I used everything but the 3 stalks of celery ( Personal taste ) so I sued 3 halves of a chopped red bell pepper. Then  I  felt  it  needed some liquid  in the blender to tie  it together so I added some garlic red wine vinegar, it did make it a little too strong but when I put some Italian dressing in there; it just did it!      A  good, simple recipe for a hot summer day.
Made this again on this date 5/7/ 17 and it still rocked!

Wonderful base recipe.  I altered to suit my style and tastes.  I rarely have fresh basil on hand, but always keep homemade pesto cubes in the freezer (basil, garlic and parm all in one!). So I defrosted several of those (~3 Tbsp) and added it to approx 1/4 C each of mayo and greek yogurt.  The chicken I poached, cooled, then shredded. To the mix I added one minced shallot, a couple Tbsps of finely chopped parsley, about 1/4 C toasted pine nuts, and about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for some heat.  NO celery for this gal.  I ended up adding a little more mayo and yogurt to get a nice consistency.  Served on lightly toasted ciabatta with sliced tomato and lettuce.  We LOVED this variation. Thank you for sharing :)

I didn't need the whole cup of mayo, I just added a 1/4 cup at a time until it was where I wanted it. I used lowfat mayo and fresh grated parmesan cheese. Pretty tasty. My littlest ate his sandwich and part of mine, so that was a win in itself. Great with sliced tomatoes on WW bread.

This is my chicken salad recipe for life! I buy a whole cooked chicken and tear it apart. I served it on sandwich sized croissants as a reviewer suggested and I loved it, loved it, loved it! Thank you for this recipe, I am a fan of chicken salads but most of them always have a little something OFF, something I don't like - this one is perfect the way it is.

Everybody wants the recipe!  I also boiled the chicken on medium low heat - added half the celery and half of a medium onion with 2 teaspoons lemon juice to a cup of water.  I put the cooked veggies and the cold stock into the food processor with the basil, celery and mayo.

Excellent.  I made as directed but wasn't sure if I had a full cup of basil, I just used a package of the basil that's sold in the supermarket .66 oz.  I seasoned the chicken lightly while cooking (salt, onion powder and a little garlic).  I think it's great served as a sandwich with bacon and sliced tomatoes.

OMG, this was amazing, I grew a garden this year and had a ton of basil so this recipe worked perfect! My husband loved it and told me to make a double batch next time! I did add the sliced almonds to give it a crunch!
Thx :)

We loved this recipe today! It's very forgiving on the ingredients, even if you don't have all of something, go ahead and make it! The sliced almonds are a great addition, too!

This was very good.  I used leftover baked chicken (black pepper and italian seasoning) and added slivered almonds.  I chopped the celery and basil and just mixed it together - I didn't use a blender or food processor, and I just eyeballed the amounts.  I also used light mayo.  It has a great flavor - would probably be good with red onion or roasted red peppers added too!

Delicious! I made this using breast meat from left over rotisserie chicken. I like a crunchier salad, so I finely chopped the celery and fresh basil leaves and stirred them in with the garlic and Mayo. I used a lite Mayo/plain Greek style yogurt combination instead of all Mayo to lighten up the calories. I used fresh shredded Parmesan. I used this with some green leaf lettuce in a tortilla for a wrap sandwich. Served with a fresh fruit salad, it was a winner. Thanks for sharing.

This was very good and different.  I did not have fresh basil so I used 2 Tbsp of dried.  It was plenty and added a great taste!  I pureed 2 stalks of celery and then just diced one stalk and added it to the chicken.  The recipe makes a lot of dressing, so next time I'll probably only use 1/2 a cup of mayo.  I think it would still easily cover 2 chicken breasts.

What a wonderful flavor! I can barely stop myself from remaking this week after week!  Our group at work enjoys it, and my neighbors enjoy it too! I even started growing my own basil plants to keep up with the demand and at the same time keep the cost down. Very few people even detect the large amount of celery used in this recipe. This recipe I will use for life! Thank you!

This is a really good chicken salad recipe! Instead of roasting my own chicken, I cheated and bought one of those warm rotisserie chickens at the grocery store and de-boned it when it cooled. I didn't puree the mayonnaise, celery, garlic, and basil because I like the crunch.  I decreased the Parmesan cheese to 1/4 cup, and added 1/4 cup of toasted slivered almonds. I also made the chicken salad the same as above but without the almonds.  It was great either way, and my husband loved it. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This salad had a good flavor, but it was a bit too rich for us.  I actually enjoyed it more when I tasted it before putting the parmesean in.  I wouldn't recommend against this one, just be prepared for a heavier version of chicken salad!

Delicious!  I added a small amount of red onion to the puree for some zip.  I served it on a large platter with greens, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and calamata olives and a side of garlic bread...it was a perfect summer meal. Thanks!

I felt it needed some stronger flavors when I first tasted the result, but obviously that's my personal preference. To me it was a bit bland, so I chopped up a small onion and put some cucumber in.  I also slipped a pinch of cayenne pepper just to give a little heat on the tail end. I didn't have anymore basil, otherwise I would've pureed more of that in the blender and added it.

I was skeptical of the basil and the parm but this was really quite tasty.   I actually made it vegan with faux chicken and vegenaise.   I also left everything chunky and just mixed it all up and served it up with sliced fresh tomatoes on wheat bread.

I made this for my sons party and it was a hit. I received so many compliments. I added the red onion and that gave it an even yummier taste. I made mine for a guest of 25. I also incorporated croissants and leafs of romaine hearts for wraps.The nice thing is as you prepare it you can mix everything leaving the mayo and cheese last this way you can add according to taste.

This is my 3rd time preparing this chicken salad and it's the best I ever tried. I'm a chicken salad fanatic and I've tried other recipes but this is the best! I never thought about using a food processor until I ran across this recipe and the consistency was perfect!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I did cut the portions of the herbs down to about half and just chopped and mixed everything. No food processor. And we put the salad on ciabatta bread. Didn't need lettuce or tamato, there is already so much flavor.

This was scrumptious!!  I too mixed instead of pureed, and did the following using what was left of a rotisserie chicken:
Added/substituted:
Chopped Red Onion,
Grated Parmesan-Romano & Thin sliced Parmesan, 
Lightly olive oil roasted sliced almonds,
Briefly butter sautéed the garlic with some of the onion,
4-5 Big Black Olives

Quite good with some changes. I used less mayo (roughly half to 3/4 cup), left out the celery (didn't have any unfortunately), used extra garlic and added some red onion. I also opted to use to bone-in thighs and legs (4 pieces total) that I boiled until cooked. I did everything in my food processor to make a relatively smooth, pate-like spread. I want to mention that you should make sure to use REAL parm, not that fake stuff or 'contains parm' stuff as you can taste it very much in the end result. I would likely use less basil and parm next time, and make sure to include the celery (maybe just two, and thinly sliced to add crunch). I served these on whole wheat flax & seed bread with lettuce and tomato- very delish, even my toddler loved this.

This was good, not great. I think it's a bit heavy on the celery. I don't eat mayo (yuck) so I subbed half lite sour cream and half plain yogurt. Giving it 3 star's because the leftover's have sat in the fridge for 3 days and I'm the only one touching them. Thanks for the recipe.

I follow this recipe almost to the tee the only thing I did different was I shredded my chicken instead of chunks.  It was awesome. I've made it twice now and everyone who tried it loved it also.

Delicious!  I boiled the chicken, let it cool,  then chopped it coarsely.  I put the chicken in the food processor and pulsed a couple of times to make it almost minced.  I used light mayo, only two stalks of celery, and other ingredients.  Put all in the food processor with the chicken and pulsed again until it was mixed.  I chopped the last stalk of celery very thinly and stirred it in.

The flavor was very good but it came out way too wet.  Next time I'll try blending with only a little mayo and mixing in more as needed after.

I love this recipe!  To save calories, I cut back on mayonnaise and parmesean cheese.  I also eat it with celery sticks or tomato slices.

This is very good! I used sweet thai basil, 1/2 mayo(hellman's taste better than when I made it w/ miracle whip) and 1/2 plain yogurt. The 1st time I made this I blended everything, it turned out green a little watery but still good. Now when I make it I just blend the yougurt, mayo and garlic. Made a sandwich with toasted croissant, muenster cheese and tomato!

I don't know what I did wrong.  It was like chicken soup... I ended up rinsing the chicken to get rid of the sauce and just added mayo and green onions, salt and pepper.  I wouldn't try this again.  sorry......

YUM YUM! This was very good. I too cut the garlic parmesan and basil in half and I'm glad that I did because as it was it was bordering on being too much. We will definitely be making this again, especially since school is getting ready to start.

This is a really delicious spin on chicken salad! I pureed the mayo, basil, parmesan cheese, pepper and garlic (I used powder and omitted the salt). Then added the mixture to the diced chicken and chopped celery. Allow to refrigerate overnight so the flavors really pop. Try not to over puree as the mixture began to look oily. I saw some reviewers said the mixture was too creamy. I eyeballed the amount of mayo, basil, cheese, etc. as I used less chicken. I suggest doing the same because it's always easier to increase the ingredients! A recipe that will not disappoint!

This was great for a light, low-cal lunch (I used yogurt instead of mayo).  I can't feel guilty about that!  It is probably even more tasty with mayo.

This was a good base recipe, but I had to tweek it some to make it really tasty. I did what others suggested and added some dill and yogurt and more parmesan. The measurements aren't accurate as a lot of it is done by personal taste.

I made it yesterday. And I had it right away and today as well. I absolutely loved it and definitely will cook it again. I might add a little less basil next time. But this recipe is perfect as it is as well.

I was really disappointed with this recipe after reading all the rave reviews. It wasn't terrible, but the basil was very overpowering and I didn't care much for the overall flavor. Traditional chicken salads with fruits and nuts taste much better to me than this. I did let it sit in the fridge overnight thinking the flavors might improve after given more time to set, but it got so watery (and green) that it didn't even look appetizing at that point. I ended up throwing out the whole batch. What a waste.

This recipe is AWESOME.  I had some leftover Smoked Chicken that I used and I only used 1/2 C of fresh basil.  It took everything in me to not eat it all in one sitting.  Thanks for sharing.

DELICIOUS!  I gave it 4 stars simply because I only used 1/3 cup fresh basil and that was enough.  1 cup seems really excessive and a waste of basil.  Put it on toasted hamburger buns from our local bakery.  This recipe makes 8 sandwiches!  Perfection!

This is so awesome, I've already made it twice this week. I didn't follow the measurements, just used my own personal taste. I also omitted the garlic just to save everyone's breath. :) Try this on toasted ciabatta rolls with some fancy chips.......it's to DIE for!!!

WOW! I knew reading the list of ingredients that I would like this salad, but the taste totally exceeded my expectations. I also decided to keep everything 'chunky', and also added in 2 green onions. I served this on thin everything bagels, which I toasted, with shredded lettuce and tomatoes. My hubby really enjoyed this too and called it a keeper...I couldn't agree more! Thanks for sharing. :)

I think the basil is very over powering.  I am going to try to make it agin with maybe a quarter of what the receipe calls for next time.  The puree came out almost green.

Really good chicken salad! I used dried basil because that's what I had on hand with a little italian herbs, really great! I didn't puree the celery because I like a little bit of crunch.  The garlic flavor was not that intense, but I like lots of garlic. Had this for dinner last night and will be having for lunch today too!

What a fantastic recipe.  I did make a couple of changes:  I made a pesto of basil, garlic, toasted pine nuts and walnuts, and parmesan cheese, which I combined with the mayo.  I didn't puree the celery so that the salad would have some texture and crunch.  Everyone raved over this one.  Definitely a keeper!

I don't like fruit in my chicken salad, so this was perfect for me.  I boiled the chicken breasts with onion, garlic, fresh rosemary, and basil.  To cut down on calories, I used 1/2 C. light mayo and 1/2 plain yogurt.  I loved the parmesan, but some people felt it was too overpowering.  I will probably omit next time because I think it would be just as good without it.  Thanks for a great summer recipe!

This was so faboulous.  The only changes I made was to use light miracle whip to cut back on fat and calories, I used celery salt b/c I didn't have celery and I used left over roasted chicken breast.  YUMMY, I think I'm going to try it with potatoe salad too, thanks for a great recipe.

Wow, great flavor and nice change from the traditional chicken salad.  Fresh basil is something I don't typically have on hand so I hydrated a dried pesto blend with a little EVOO and water and it turned out great.  I finely chopped everything and then added some larger chunks of cucumber for freshness and texture.  This is amazing on a buttery cracker!!  Would make a great appetizer for company.

This is very good, but it's green.  If you have any picky eaters in your family, beware.  The combination of flavors is awesome.  I reduced the amount of parmesan cheese and was happy with the result.

I love this!  I really like the basil and the bite of the garlic.  I read some reviews, and I didn't want the parmesan to overpower the basil, so I used 1/2 cup of parm and it was the perfect amount.  Used light mayo too.  I didn't have any celery, so I added about 2/3 of a large red bell pepper, diced, to the chicken/mayo mix.  Didn't puree the bell pepper.  Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

Wonderful chicken salad!  I used fat free Miracle Whip and used some sliced almonds instead of celery to add a little crunch. Served on ritz crackers and it was super!  Will make again! Thank you Janet for this great recipe!

I enjoyed this dish but it is definitely something to eat right away.  After a night in the fridge the basil oils tend to give it a strange after taste.

This is a good recipe.  It makes a lot.  Per others recommendations, I did not puree all the celery with the basil, garlic and mayo.  I also thought it needed some acidity and added a bit of lemon juice.  I added pine nuts because we like the crunch.  Served it on pitas with spring greens and fresh sliced tomato for a picnic.  It worked well.

I thought this was awesome!  I barely changed a thing, a little less basil maybe.  If you love pesto, you will love this.  Took it to a party and got lots of compliments.  I will definitely make it again.

I didn't puree the ingredients either, I found this very interesting but the fresh basil was a little overwhelming. It still was a very good spread on a roll with fresh lettuce and tomato.

I used the blender to make the dressing so it was very green. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing and have to say it's the best chicken salad I have ever eaten. I'm going to be trying the dressing on potatoes for potato salad. I wish I could give it extra stars. YUM

Yum! This was SO good. And I'm not even much of a chicken salad kind of gal. I ended up just cooking the chicken on the stove top(was too hot to warm up the oven and I live in a travel trailer!) and I didn't have a whole cup of basil on hand, maybe just a 1/2 cup. I also only put about half the celery in the food processor and chopped the rest small and added it later. The little bit of crunch was nice. OH! And my husband HATES the taste of raw garlic so I cooked it a little before I added it to the food processor. I served it on ciabatta bread with some lettuce and slices of tomato. Definitely putting this in my recipe box. MMMM!!

I loved this recipe! My husband doesn't like anything healthy in his chicken salad like grapes or celery so I thought I would give this a shot. I didn't use celery and I added minced onion and almonds. We had some lettuce and tomato on the sandwich and it was delicious!

How could these ingredients be bad.   I followed the recipe exactly as written and definitely not too much basil.  Only change that made was leaving one celery minced for some crunch. Ver nice.  Thanks for sharing.

Was looking for something different and this was very tasty for its simplicity.  I had to use chicken in a can and didn't puree. I also had to make a smaller serving, so didn't use all the mayo it asked for, but I thoroughly enjoyed it's light, yet flavorful taste. The fresh celery gave it a nice crunch, which I love.

Great base to this recipe.  I substituted celery with celery seed and used dried basil (didn't have fresh on hand).  Did not puree any ingredients. Added mayo until desired consistency was reached.

Funny that I read the herb wrong. I was looking to use up my fresh rosemary.... And used that instead of basil. lol.....well, this works too! I squeezed fresh lemon juice in there, and eye balled the mayo. And skipped the puree part.

I read one reviewer that was leery of the amount of mayo.  It sounded like a lot to me too considering the amount of chicken.  Thus said, I made up the dressing exactly as prescribed and, after pureeing,  used only the amount needed to get the salad to the consistency that I like.  Just add the Parmesan to taste after blending in the dressing. There were a couple of tbsp left over so I ate that over a couple of boiled eggs.  From experience I have found that when making recipes with basil and garlic that I usually end up adding more of those ingredients at the end to get a result that suits me.  That was not the case with this recipe.  The proportions were just right for my taste.  I enjoyed the salad.  It was a nice change of pace from the Fruity Curry Chicken Salad that I make frequently from this site.

Love this! I did make some changes though. I took the suggestions on here and used the red onion which was amazing. I also used already cooked tyson frozen grilled chicken strips to make my already hectic, stay at home mom life, easier. And i pureed it also. And I omitted the celery. Such a quick and delicious recipe.

Very good use of leftover oven baked chicken breasts.  As other reviewers mentioned, I did not puree ingredients.  Also subbed 1/4 c. sour cream for mayo.  We used flour tortillas lined with butter lettuce to make chicken wraps.  Would definitely make again.

I thought this was great.  Had a COSTCO roasted chicken that I cubed. Since the roasted chicken has lots of herbs I left out the garlic. Used celery seed because I was out of celery.  Browned a handful of pine nuts and added the juice of a lemon. Turned out very tasty.  Wonder if sugared walnuts would go with this? It is a good recipe to experiment with.

This was ok.  Next time, I won't puree the ingredients and I think I will like this better.

i made this exactly as directed. there was WAY too much mayo for the amount of chicken, so I added another breast which helped. I also immediately regretted pureeing everything. It turned a sickly green color and took the crunch out of it... i will make this again but use less mayo and definitely NOT puree--just finely chop. flavors are tasty though.

Love this!!  I also did not puree the ingredients.  I chopped basil really fine and used bottled minced garlic.  I did not have celery but like a little crunch so used coarsely chopped water chestnuts.

Really loved this recipe!  I normally try all recipes before inflicting on others, but had to take a chicken salad to a baby shower and ran out of time.  I took a leap of faith and made this the day of the shower for the first time.  It was delicious!  I did add red onions as some other reviewers suggested, to the puree mix.  I added the celery chopped instead of puree, to give some crunch.  I got lots of compliments for the salad, thanks so much for posting!

Yabba-Dabba Delicious!!!  My husband is still raving about how good this is.  I used grated cheddar because I was out of Parm.  I think it would even be better with the parm, but whatever definately a recipe worth keeping!!!

Wonderful recipe!  I followed the recipe however when I saw it was almost a 2 hour dish I changed the cooking instructions.  I cooked chicken in skillet and did not blend other ingredients in a processor, I just cut them up finely.  The crunch was great!  A two hour dish turned into a 20 minute dish.  Even better!  I didn't have enough mayo, but found 3/4 cup quite sufficent.  DELICIOUS!

What a nice, sophisticated chicken salad! I prefer Miracle Whip, which made this a bit sweeter and I also added chopped walnuts for some crunch. I will definitely make it again!

Absolutely delicious!!! I didn't have fresh basil so I used the basil seasoning I had on hand. I think it would be much better w/ the fresh basil, but it was still good. Served it up on some multi-grain bread w/ lettuce. Yummo!!!

We served this to 150 people at our wedding reception and got rave reviews. I use half mayo and half greek yogurt. I always omit the celery and add red and yellow pepper.

This was a wonderful spin on chicken salad!  It is very garlicky, which I LOVE!  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used a teaspoon of dried.  I did not puree the celery, but instead processed the celery, garlic, and chicken to small bits then added the rest of the ingredients.  Excellent recipe!

I made this for a bridal shower and substituted feta for parmesan, delicious! Many there said it was the best chickden salad they had ever tasted! Definitely my fav! I also didn't measure the mayo but I think I used about half of what's listed, the feta made a great creaminess!

This is a very fresh-tasting chicken salad perfect for a summer dinner.  Instead of pureeing the basil mixture, I chopped the basil and the celery rather coarsely and mixed it with the garlic and mayo.  Was wonderful!

Great change from chicken and fruit in a salad. I added two green onions and a chopped red pepper. I used half low fat mayo and half nonfat yogurt for the dressing and cut the cheese to about 1/2 cup to save on fat and calories. I had microwaved the chicken breasts and dumped the liquid that collected on the plate into the dressing. This was a dish to take to a friend who was home from the hospital and she raved about it. She's Italian and loves basil and garlic so it was a great match.

This is fantastic!  Can't wait to take it for lunch tomorrow!  I only used about 1/3 cup basil and 3/4 cup mayo.  Next time i may use even less mayo, but I will definitely make this over and over again - so different!!

I made this with chicken breasts that had been cooked in a curry. I used only 3 T of mayo and added 1 tablespoon cream cheese. Because onion make my husband sick, I use onion powder. My husband liked it well enough for me to make it again. Now to replicate the flavor of "cooked curry" with out making curry.

Wow! The flavors of this chicken salad are fantastic.  I used chicken tenderloins that I sauteed in olive oil and omitted the garlic but stayed true to the recipe on the remainder.  I served it on toasted english muffin with tomato.  Yummm! A perfect summer combination.

Yummo!  What a great recipe.  I had 1/2 of a rotisserie chicken left over from last nights dinner so I shredder and used that.  The only change I made was to add more diced celery after everything was mixed together for a little crunch.  When I make again I will use a little less mayo.

So good! I halved the recipe and it is seriously good if you like these flavors, which I do! Only change was that I didn't have any celery so I used celery salt and I didn't want to dirty my food processor so I did not puree. I just served on a light bun with lettuce...delicious! I've had it for lunch three days in a row! Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe, but did add a half cup of white wine like some of the reviewers suggested. I think that this recipe could use some tweeking.  I think it could use a little more salt, garlic, and lemon juice.   It was okay; I would play with the recipe a bit.

This makes a good chicken salad, but I don't think it's memorable.  I skipped pureeing one of the celery stalks for some extra crunch.

I have made this twice and while I love basil and chicken salad something is not meeting my expectations.  I always love to try new chicken salad recipes, but this as is not a favorite for me.  I think will try it again,but grill the chicken with a little seasoning.  I think it will give it the flavor it needs.  What an inspiring recipe.  Thank you!!

This was wonderful! I was in a hurry so I cooked the chicken breasts in my pressure cooker with a boullion cube, a bit of salt and a bay leaf. Made the rest while it was cooking. I added some red pepper, and just chopped the basil etc fine instead of pureeing it- which worked fine and gives it a nice texture. Did as several reviewers suggested and made it with half mayo and half sour cream - forgot the garlic but tasted great without it! Love this recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe for chicken salad. I was looking for something different that used basil and chicken. It was delicious! I did add green, red and sweet onion to the mix. I served it on croissants and my boyfriend ate three sandwiches!

I followed some suggestions from other reviewers – boiled the chicken with salt, pepper and a bay leaf, then cubed it. I let the chicken marinate in the pureed mixture for over a day. Then for a quick dinner, I boiled some pasta, and in the last five minutes added a clove of garlic and some peppers. Strained the pasta, added the cheese and mixture with the chicken, and voila, a delicious meal! Served with ‘Strawberry Onion Salad’ from this site. Will definitely make again.

amazing! I added red onions and used the previously recommended 1/3 mayo, 1/3 sour cream, & 1/3 cream cheese instead of all mayo. I also ommited celery.    very good recipe. it's like a grown up version of regular chicken salad!

I had two large chicken breast thawed out and wasn't sure what I would do with them. I just made this and WOW.  I didn't have celery, but roasted a whole red pepper and added that.  It is DELICIOUS.  Thanks for the recipe!

LOVED IT!!! This was the first thing I decided to cook using my new stove. Granted, the stove only was used for the chicken...but my excitement was the perfect ingredient! I can't wait for my family to come over and taste it tomorrow (if I haven't eaten it all already!)

This recipe was pretty tasty, but my husband didn't like it at all, so I was disappointed! He likes chicken salad for his lunches, and since all the ratings said how much the husband loved it, I was counting on it! I think the green color had something to do with it, and the strong basil flavor too. It's worth a try, but I probably won't be making it again.

This was great, hubby rated it a 4, 'just to leave room for incredible things' in case he has something better in the future.
I used this as a base and played w/it some.  I rubbed chicken w/olive oil, garlic, salt & pepper and grilled it.  While grilling I chopped up the basil and mixed w/the mayo and parmesean to taste.  Sliced the chicken and mixed it while HOT and served on grilled buns as a hot dinner rather than as a cold lunch.  Side of potato chips made for a nice, easy to prepare dinner, w/some cold salad left over for lunch the next day.  Very nice, will make again.

We had way too much on our hands after making this so we decided to mix it in with pasta sauce (homemade) and try it over pasta. I added a little extra Parmesan and it was wonderful.

Green color was a bit of a turn-off. Taste was strong and not to most of my family's liking. I would reccomend using mayonnaise and not miracle whip with this recipe.

I didn't have fresh basil, so I used a couple Tbl of dry instead. We also left out the celery. When I first mixed it together the Parmesan did seem overpowering, but after a few hours in the fridge it was perfect.

one of my first real chicken salad recipes.  my husband and i really liked it a lot and  i'd definitely make it again!  i did feel their was a little too much Parmesan cheese, i'd even consider leaving it out next time and just enjoying the basil. i also didnt puree all the celery to leave some of the crunch. i found some really great nutty whole wheat bread to put it on and it was fantastic!

This was a good recipe.  I had a left over rotisserie chicken, so I just cut it into chunks instead of doing chicken breasts.  I also added onion-- you could do without because this is a very flavorful recipe, but I hardly cook anything without it!  Nice change from the usual chicken salad.

I had to try this since I've got basil growing in the garden and had everything else on hand.  It was really good!  I had 2 cups of chopped cooked chicken and only used about 1/2 the dressing.  I buy whole chickens when they go on sale, bake them, chop up the meat, bag it up in 2 cup quantities to freeze for later use (tip from my step-mom).  I also like to do this with store bought rotisserie chickens.  Great time saver.  Thanks for this one :)

Nice change - When I make it again, I will probably only puree half of the celery & red pepper because I like it chunky, but it was still good as written.  I did reduce Parmesan to 1/2c as suggested.  Perfect use of an over-active basil plant!
