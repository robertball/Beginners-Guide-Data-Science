This was a great recipe!! My husband thought it was one of the best he had eaten. I did have to add some salt and garlic powder to it. But it was fast and easy and super yummy!

Good basic chili recipe.  I did add salt.  Used V-8 juice instead on straight tomato juice.

My husband and I loved it.  I added more chili powder and some hot sauce for a little bit more kick.  And I like my chili thicker so I crushed up some saltine crackers.  Other than that it was great and made awesome left overs.

I was looking for a flavourful, basic, no frills chili.  I made this chili following the recipe exactly as stated.  It was so BLAND.  No flavour at all.  I had to make some changes....  I saut√©ed in a 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic in with the meat.  I then increased the black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon, and added 2 tablespoons of hot sauce, 3/4 teaspoon of ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne, and 1/4 teaspoon of oregano.  DELICIOUS.   

I guess the reason for all those garnishes was to provide the chili with taste.  With my changes no need for the extra calories.

This is a very easy and delicious chili.  Before making this I considered the reviews of other readers and decided to puree half a pickled jalapeno into the tomato sauce and add a splash of worchestire sauce.  I also sauted the onion and beef mixture with minced garlic.

Quick, easy and so delicious that I almost felt a little guilty eating it with the toppings.  Substituted ground turkey, black beans for the northern and tomato sauce and canned tomatos for the juice since that was on hand.

I made this using V8. Didn't have chili powder so I threw in a pkg of chili mix & some garlic.  Put in my new electric pressure cooker for 10 minutes.  When it was done I added 1can bush's chili beans & 1 can northern beans & a little worcestershire sauce.

I made this recipe with a few changes, and this one is a winner!  I did not use any meat making this a great choice for those who choose to go meatless.  I used tomato sauce instead of the tomato juice which made for a richer, thicker soup.  Our family simply cannot get enough of this, and it tastes even better the next day!

Great recipe but for a better flavor replace the water with 2 cups of beef broth along with an extra can of organic kidney beans. Family loved it.

Easy to make.  Just needs a little more spice.
