This was surprisingly good for how simple it is!  I used 2 cans of no sugar added cherry pie filling.  Delicious warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  Thanks for the recipe :)

Going to the store to buy a premade cake is not as easy as this one is to make. A touch too sweet as is, I will add another can of "no sugar added" pie filling next time for balance. Very easy and pretty tastey too.

Well, I had the ingredients, so I tried it.  It really does work!  As you might expect, it's a very sweet dessert.  A bit too sweet for me, but I'm not a big dessert eater.  It's a quick, easy, and adequate dessert for when you're in a hurry.

Definitely make this in a square pan. It might seem a little too small at first (the soda will come to the very top) but as it cooks down, it's perfect.  I was in the mood for this, so it didn't seem too sweet (as others have mentioned).

This was a great quick dessert.  We used cherry pie filling, then pecan pieces, then the cake mix, and poured Sprite over all.  Intriguing and good.  Tasted like cobbler.  It was also good the next day.  This is fun for kids to help with.  Try it!  You'll like it.

Easy and taste wonderful!!!!  I used a small bag of frozen blueberries instead of blueberry filling.  The cobbler had a good texture, had no "tin can" after taste, had a fresh blueberry flavor, and had just the right amount of sweetness. Yum!!!

So easy and enjoyed by a bunch of teenagers.  I made it in an 8x8" pan - can't imagine there would be any substance to it in a larger pan.

It's easy enough, and my kids were amazed. Comes out like a cobbler, indeed, but with a bit of a "chemical taste", if you get my meaning. I don't think I'll do it again, a real cobbler is not so much more work after all and definitely less artificial

I just made this. I used peaches instead of blueberries. I think it probably needed 2 cans instead of just 1. It's not a very exciting dessert.
