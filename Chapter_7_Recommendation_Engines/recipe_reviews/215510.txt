I make this on a smaller scale. just use 2-3 cucumbers, preferrably a purple onion if I have it, a tomato and vinegar, salt, sugar (I usually use Splenda) & a small amount of salad oil. Have used apple cider vinegar also. You can "play" around with it until you like the proportions.

Very good, i love cucumber, tomatoe and onion salad, but never knew how to make it. No one ever told me to add sugar to the vinegar.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  The only thing I will do different next time is to add about 1/8 cup EVOO.

This is my new favorite summer cuke recipe! A nice change from the creamy mix. I used celery salt and some Mediterran salt. Also soaked the cukes in salt for about 20 mins. beforehand. 
Second time making it, I added yellow and red peppers.. yum!

This is exactly what I was looking for from my remembering my mom's tomato and cucumber salad from 40 years ago!  I didn't have the celery seed so I put in a little bit of dried dill.  So bright and fresh with that hint of sweetness.  I did cut the recipe down to 2 servings and still used 2 tomatoes and 1 whole small vidalia onion.  Thanks you for this great recipe to use up those cukes!

Not bad but very sweet. My mom has made this salad for as long as I can remember. For a more tart version cut the sugar to a pinch and the balsamic altogether.

Very good!  Love the dressing.  Only suggestion is to definitely peel off some of the skin of the cucumber to cut down on bitterness.

My mother always used to make this during the summer with vegetables fresh from her garden. I've been trying to recreate her recipe, this is very close, thank you!

My Mother-in-Law loved it.  However, my husband said it was too sweet, my son said the cucumbers were soggy, and no one liked the tomato or onions.  Good recipe...just not our cup of tea.  Also, it doesn't make very good left overs.

8 cups is alot of cucumbers especially when you only have 1 onion and 1 tomato to add in. i used 2 large cucumbers and 1 giant tomato and onion. i cut the sugar quite a bit since a cup and a half seemed like alot to me. i didnt have the celery seed and i did add a shake of garlic salt and pepper after i had let it sit and i tried it. good recipe but i think the amounts might need to be adjusted. thanks

We both love this salad, but I dont eat sugar if I can help it. The recipe calls for a lot of sugar.   I followed the instructions to the letter, save subbing splenda once and stevia  the next time for the sugar.  I like the stevia better and subbing it for the sugar saves a ton of calories. On my second salad I used halves cherry tomatoes.  I liked the texture better.

Made this a couple days ago and followed the recipe exactly, wouldn't change anything because I love it! I took some to my 81 year old mother and she too thought it was great! I plan on checking out more of MUZIC247 recipes! Really not over sweet either as some have said.

Too sweet for my family. Proportion of cucumber to tomato and onion was off. Too much cucumber, not enough onion and tomato.

We did make this and it is just a bit to sweet.  Next time I will cut down on the sugar.  The kids loved it  and the adults not as much.

This is a wonderful salad any time. I did cut way back on the sugar, peeled the cucumbers and I used purple onions. Just a great salad.

I substitute cucumber for zucchini. Still the best summer salad you can make, that will go with anything!
