Delicious! I used mini sweet red/yellow/orange peppers and stuffed them whole. I mixed the parmesan into the filling. These make great appitizers when prepared with the small peppers.

I'm a huge recipe skimmer & didn't realize this was meatless . . I know duh . . until I started getting the ingredients together. I was looking for a recipe for grilled stuffed peppers. This recipe looked great & I did use most of the ingredients & mixed into ground beef and grilled. Unbelievably good! Also used a pablano & it was even better than the bell.

Next time I would mix the cheese in with the filling.  These are very good and make a great side dish.

This was okay, but a little mushy in texture for my taste. I would probably add lots of cheese to the mixture if I made it again. :)

I substituted hot salsa for the tomato.  It was a bit too spicy, next time I will use a medium salsa instead.

There is plenty of stuffing here for three peppers, so I used Stop & Go peppers--one each of red, yellow & green.  Each added a different flavor & the whole dish looked beautiful & colorful.  This was a definite HIT!  Next time I will add more cheese on top--maybe a slice instead of grated (& I am not a cheese fan, so if I say add more, be liberal!).  Also, my husband & I agreed that cooked popcorn shrimp mixed into the stuffing would turn this into a meal.  We served with chicken & apple sausages (Emeril's).  Delicious!  A definite new rotation recipe.  OH!  And, it's a good one for kiddos, too.  My preschooler agreed it was a yummerz.  NICE.

This was edible.  I did add some hot salsa to my stuffing, as well as the Parmesan cheese. I forgot to cook the peppers beforehand so I just kept them in there for an extra 15min.

After reading the ingredients beforehand I knew that it would be too bland for my taste, so I used Grissol Italien seasoned breadcrumbs, which pepped it up a bit. I didn't bother peeling the tomato. I also mixed up the Parmesan into the stuffing, as suggested by another reviewer, and added more Parmesan on top.

me = 5, husband = 4. Since I am the cook, I win. It has an easy prep, I even used a can of diced tomatoes to make it quicker. Very little clean up since after I chopped the onions in the small cuisanart, I then put in the bread crumbs, parsley, wine and pepper in the cuisanart to mix it well and added that to finished pan of sauted onions. No bowls to clean up! Plus it was a nice change of stuffed peppers with meat and rice.

This was superb!  I didn't peel the tomato, and I added a little extra.  I used homemade breadcrumbs, and I also mixed the cheese in.  I will definitely make this again, soon.

Excellent recipe. I usually add a pound of ground beef and more wine to make it a larger meal.

Delish!  I made it with salsa instead of tomato, a little red wine instead of white, and added a little feta cheese inside those puppies.  AMAZING!!

I personally did not care for this recipe.  It was very bland to me and it had a very mushy texture.  I was skeptical to begin with but I wanted a pepper recipe without meat added so I was willing to try it.  I will not make this again.

It wasn't spectacular. But I did like that it's pretty light and simple. Per other suggestions, I mixed the cheese right in and added a little Italian seasoning.

I made these as a side dish, and my husband and friend loved them.  I don't particularly care for onions, so this was not good for me.  However, the men went back for seconds!

I love this recipe. I use apple juice instead of the white wine which gives it a little sweeter flavor and Mozzerella cheese instead of parm. I also only bake them long enough for the cheese to melt since the boiling water softens up the peppers.

Could be a bit more flavorful but a very healthy alternative to meat-stuffed peppers.

Ok i am giving this 5 stars even though i changed a couple of things. Normally i do not rate/review on someone's recipe if i change it, but today i am! I made these last night and they were delicious! Everyone loved them, i'm only sad today because there are no leftovers! I did add a pound of ground turkey to my mixture to make it go further plus i was cooking for 4 men who love meat! I also used a hot salsa in place of the tomato. The only thing i would do next time is maybe punch a few holes in the peppers to allow the juice to drain, i had to tip them all upside down once cooked. That being said the stuffing mixture was wonderfully moist and delicious! Great recipe! Can't wait to cook this again!

Okay, honestly, I substituted so many of the ingredients out of necessity that I wonder if it would even be considered the same thing anymore—but it didn’t come out bad. So actually this recipe served more as a template. I used leftover rice instead of breadcrumbs, 1/4 can of tomato paste and sundries tomatoes because I ran out of fresh tomatoes, goat cheese instead of parmigiana, and cilantro instead of parsley. Oh! And a banana instead of a pepper!! (Jk! The last parr’s a joke! Lol!)

Too mushy for my taste. I added some corn, which was good. I would make again without bread crumbs and just add an assortment of chopped up vegetables.

To my surprise, This was a hit with adults and young kids alike. I omitted the cheese on one pepper for a dairy free diet and used gluten free bread crumbs to accommodate another guest. Great to have a recipe in my back pocket that looks good on a plate, tastes great and accommodates diverse dietary needs.

I made this and it was very tasty. I would definitely make it again but not with breadcrumbs as it was gummy. I would use orzo or brown rice. I also mixed in the Parmis on as others have suggested but then put more Parmis on on the top.

I doubled the recipe because I had bought four large green peppers to make stuffed peppers and decided to try a new recipe rather than the standard rice/hamburger mix topped with tomato sauce and cheese (although since becoming vegetarian many years ago, I use veggie crumbles in place of hamburger).  This one sounded interesting as it didn't call for rice or hamburger.  I used panko bread crumbs as that's what I had on hand.  I had one large onion and used 2-1/2 medium sized tomatoes (one tomato was turning bad so I was only able to use half of it).  I simply diced the tomatoes--I didn't peel or remove the seeds .  I didn't add salt as I usually don't.  I didn't have fresh parsley so sprinkled dried into the mix.  Also, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added the cheese to the mixture.  It is NOT necessary to cook the peppers beforehand.  I stuffed the peppers, put them in a square baking pan, filled it about half up with water, covered tightly with foil, and baked at 350 for 60 minutes.  The peppers came out cooked (they probably were cooked at about 45 minutes).  The stuffing was not mushy (at least one reviewer commented hers was)--probably because I used  panko crumbs.  I will make these again.

This recipe was pretty good. I made a few changes:
1. I added a can of mushrooms because my hubby LOVES canned mushrooms with peppers. 
2. As suggested in the comments, I mixed the parmasean cheese into the filling. 
3. I left the peppers whole. 

My only complaint is that the filling was a tad on the dry side. I think that next time I prepare this, I will use less bread crumbs than what's called for in the recipe. I served the peppers as a main dish with a side of garlic and chive mashed potatoes-- YUM! Definitely a recipe worth trying again.

I actually used fire roasted tomatoes and vegan cheese. Delicious and easy to make.

Just too mushy.  I added corn, but  next time       I will add rice or meatless crumbles or both.  Definately add cheese into mixture as well as on top.  I threw it in the crockpot.  Will make again with a few changes.
