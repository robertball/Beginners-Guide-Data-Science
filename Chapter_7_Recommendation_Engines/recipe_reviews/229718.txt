Wow, these were absolutely delicious.  The whole family agreed the recipe is a keeper and I already have a request to make them again. I tried to make them a wee bit healthier by cutting back butter in the crust (only by 1 Tbsp) and exchanging half of the cream cheese for the low fat version.  Still delicious.  I only had an 8x8 pan and they seemed to bake forever, but it was worth it.

OMG! These were fabulous! I had my eye on this recipe for a while and finally got around to trying it and I'm glad I did. Very easy to make with great results that make it look like you spent hours... I lined my glass baking dish with Reynolds Wrap heavy duty non-stick foil which made getting the cheesecake out a breeze. I did add a Tbsp. of vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture but other than that I didn't change a thing. My only criticism is that the baking time is off - I left it in for an hour and 15 minutes, then turned off the oven and let it remain in there for another 15-20 minutes. Once it cooled I left it in the fridge overnight. Be sure to clean your knife in between each cut. The sea salt caramel really compliments this nicely. Next time I think I'll just make this using a 9 inch round spring form pan. Overall, a definite keeper and one I'll make again!

My curiosity was definitely peaked!. I make cheesecake fairly often and thought this would be a great change. I followed the recipe exactly as written and was very pleased. I always take my All-Recipes First-Attempts at New Recipes to work to get the opinions of my co-workers. The whole tray disappeared in an astonishing short time. I was actually embarrassed to see them as they devoured it all. I used Chef John's Salted Caramel - my personal favorite caramel sauce

Used canned homemade apple pie filling, added vanilla extract and skipped the salt on top.  Sprinkled with pecans as I drizzled the caramel on top. It did seem to take a long to bake, I wished I had put it on a lower rack so the top did not brown so much. Delicious!

These are a crowd favorite. Made it as the recipe calls for but with a little twist.  I substituted the graham crackers with pretzels.  There was enough salt in the pretzels that I didn't put any on top.

Not a fan of apples so going to use it as a base for other fruit. Strawberries sound like a good switch up with chocolate sauce.

I made this just as directed. It needed to bake longer than directed because it was much to soupy to slice in to bars and put on a plate, as pictured. It tasted good, and I may try this again with a longer cook time.

These are excellent! easy to prepare and you can use any flavor of pie filling you like. I used my 9" spring form pan and turned these bars into an awesome cheesecake that sold out of my case within an hour. Will definitely add these to my regular baking roster!
