These ribs should be renamed OhYes spareribs. Made these last night for New Years Eve dinner along with a baked potato & crab salad, just wonderful. The only thing I did different was to loosely cover the ribs with foil the first 45 minutes of cooking. I used the left over drippings to drizzle over ribs. This recipe is a KEEPER! Thank you Luz2bake

Used this recipe for chicken thighs. It is super. Had some left over that I thinned down a bit and used as a sandwich condiment.

Very good. A nice alternative to regular BBQ. Sticky, sweet and tart. The sauce is delicious. I shaved the ginger and used more than called for, because I love ginger - so good! In my oven, next time I will cook at a lower temp for longer. Cook only the amount that will be eaten. While very delicious hot and fresh, these are terrible reheated the next day.

I just have to add, and laugh, ono in Hawaii means delicious.  But yes it is a yes. These are a no brainer yummy treat.  If you want to make it for a meal, I buy whatever sparerib I have (I'm not in Hawaii and the small sizes aren't as available) and just cook a little longer if it is a larger piece.

I agree with Luv2Bake. These are definitely a great addition to any New Years Eve Party or appetizer buffet.I served extra sauce on the side. Nothing but rave reviews from my guests.

Excellent! I used 1.5 pound of pork spareribs (just the two of us tonight). Instead of garlic salt I used two fresh garlic cloves, chopped and grated the ginger as well. I heated up the sauce then poured it over the ribs to bake at 325 degrees. I covered the baking pan with foil tightly the first 45 minutes, then turned it over to the other side for another 45 minutes. There was a wonderful aroma filling up my house while the ribs were baking. I sprinkled the ribs with toasted sesame seeds before serving. The meat was tender, not tough, and full of flavor. The sauce itself has a nice balance of slight sweetness with subtle “tang” in each bite. The sauce also baked right into the meat making it so savory, juicy, sticky sweet and finger licking ONOlicious! I did not want to waste the sauce so I reserved it to pour over the ribs and rice. I served with, “Green Bean and Mushroom Medley,” also from this site.

Delicious.  Used regular baby back ribs - didn't change a thing except for cooking time of 325 for one hour each side.  A great change from the bbq ribs.  It was a hit.

Excellent. Asked the butcher to cut the spareribs twice for bite-size pieces. Perfect - definitely a keeper! So easy, too!

I only had boneless porkchops, I cut these into 1 inch squares and I substituted 1tsp ground ginger for the fresh
Cut baking time down to 20 mins each side.

These were delicious! I was confused about "bite size" spare ribs...maybe they're available in Hawaii like one reviewer mentioned. I used regular spare ribs and they were great!

My husband made these tonight & he said the sauce smelled great when preparing, but we both agree it didn't follow onto the ribs. It was real blah. I ended up putting some BBQ sauce on my meat to add flavor.

Sorry, this wasn't my favorite.  I followed directions exactly and the ribs were tough and not as tasty as I expected from the reviews.

The smell of these ribs was so enticing, I forgot the sesame seeds.  I used apple cider vinegar cause it's what I had.  Still fantastic results.
