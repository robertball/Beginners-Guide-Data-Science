It was good. Maybe add bananas and use tidbits instead of crushed pineapple, drained. Lemon yogurt did make it too tart. Maybe vanilla yogurt? I will make it again though. It was a hit at the Easter dinner I had. Everyone liked it. Those would just be my variations.

Blueberries were prohibitively expensive, so I upped the strawberries and grapes to 1.5 C each. Also used green grapes instead of red. I made it the night before I served it. It was okay, not fab. Hubby thought the lemon yogurt made it too tart.
