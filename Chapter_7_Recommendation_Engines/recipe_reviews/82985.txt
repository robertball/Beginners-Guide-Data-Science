**DO NOT ADD JALAPENO JUICE as another reviewer stated!  This will change the flavor completely.  Mexican chili powders vary in flavor and spice by brand and variety.  For more depth of flavor, MIX the chili powders.  I personally used 3 different powders with fabulous results.  This is the BEST basic chorizo recipe.

This tastes really good and makes your kitchen smell wonderful. Make as is if you like your chorizo non-spicy and low in salt. I elected to kick it up a notch, added a bit more garlic and salt, then about a teaspoon-ish of jalapeno juice to give it a little kick. Like I said, good as is, but a little bland for my taste. Add a little jalapeno and WOW! Thanks for this recipie, I've always wanted to make this on my own, instead of using the fatty mystery meat at the store!

Anne, thank you sooooooo much for your recipe. I bought chorizo yesterday and asked the clerk what spices were added to make chorizo, chorizo. Well, he said he could remember off the top of his head. Thank you for your recipe. I will happily make it from scratch with your recipe and as you say it always taste better home made. An additional ingredient that I might add is fresh chopped lemon zest.

I've lost track of the number of times I've used this recipe as a base for chorizo. Generally I use this recipe as a base for Sliders. I add an egg and (wearing gloves) grab handfuls of the mixture and squeeze it through my fingers. This is to break down the meat and meld the ingredients together. I cut down on the chili powder in order to add other spices to make the sausage hotter. The recipe is good as is but very versatile if you want to make it your own. I've used this recipe as a meatloaf and as the meat component in soups. It is tasty and versatilel.   I am the chef at a sports bar and grill in Dania Beach, Florida. My clientele consists not only of local residents but tourists from around the world. I am expected to prepare extraordinary soups and specials on a daily basis...on a limited budget with limited time. My ratings are based on customer response...so take them seriously. I have earned the reputation as the Soup Nazi (Seinfeld  lol).

This was exremely easy and very good. I added cumin, more garlic, jalapeno powder, paprika, and a little more salt. The smell was amazing. The whole family loved it. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Good! My only change was to use chicken broth in place of the wine (I just didn't have any) and use ground turkey instead of beef & pork. I formed patties out of the meat and froze them individually.  Fried some up yesterday, topped with some cheddar cheese and MMMMMM....!  Thanks!

I just want to say for those of you who put wine in chorizo, this is not "real Mexican chorizo" .  I have always made my own "real Mexican chorizo" ground beef, chicken version, and vegetarian version for the past 30 years, but I never come across one with "wine".  Well I tried it and  my culture do not put alcohol in chorizo.  I would leave out the wine, add chili flakes or cayenne to the vegetarian version.  You're getting the "real Mexican" version this way.  Good luck!

I made this recipe without any alterations and wasn't very impressed.  I made it on a Saturday, mixed it every day, and cooked some for the first time on Tuesday.  The chorizo had a pretty distinct wine flavor that I had not noticed in other chorizo I've eaten.  It was one of the dominant flavors.  Maybe it is the wine I used...  I just used a generic dry red wine.  I'm glad others like this recipe, but it's not for me.

This was a wonderful replacement for the over-fatty store bought variety.  I switched the meat ratio (2#Pork, 1#Beef)because it is what I had on hand.  I also used a variety of four different chili powders (totaling 3/4c) to get just the right amount of kick.  I'll be keeping this as a staple in my freezer!

Thanks Anne!  Great as is or step it up to your personal flavor.  I flipped the meat ratio - 2# gr pork, 1# gr beef.  I also added some additional New Mexico Chile powder (Chimayo chile) that has a roasted chile flavor w/ med heat and used 1 T of kosher salt (instead if 2t).  I have to admit....the "nasty bits"  make a chorizo as w/ any sausage.  Without them, there is definately something missing.  However this recipe does a good job as an introduction to this flavorful sausage.

Thank you Thank you Thank you!!! My husband loves it, and it actually tastes better than the store bought one. I use organic meat, and added a bunch of chilli pods (Dried New Mexican ones) as well. Wash them, and blend them together with the ingredients before adding them to the meat. We just like it hotter. ; - ) Great recipe!

Love this.  I am on a low fat, low salt diet and this is one of the best tasting things on my menu.  I use 1 LB of ground turkey 93/7 for the 4 serving recipe.  I omit the salt, omit the wine, add 2 egg whites.  I stir fry it and add an egg white .  I serve it with griddle heated corn tortillas and homemade salsa.  It's a great meal any time of day.

Sadly, I found this recipe massively bland in comparison to the chorizo I've had??  I think the base given here is a good precursor to a fabulous recipe but its def lacking flavor(s) This recipe is a far cry from 'omg yum'  I'll have to try some variations as suggested by some here.

This is a fantastic recipe!  It comes out perfect every time.  When I make chorizo, this is the recipe I use (all beef, however).  Throw it all in the stand mixer on low for a few minutes and it gets the perfect consistency.  Love it!

Haven't made this yet, so I will not rate it.  I will have to make this during this weekend.  I love chorizo and am very happy to have found a recipe that does not involve having to go out and get expensive equipment.  I will try to make it using tequilla instead of the wine because it actively kills any bacteria that may be borne during the 2-3 days needed during mixing process.  Other than that, I will try to stick to the original recipe.  I'll tell you later how this turns out.

This is really good chorizo! The key is to let it "cure" for 3 days in the fridge. This is only my second attempt at making my own sausage & because it was an absolute success, I'll be branching out & trying some other recipes. Thanks very much for sharing! :o)

This is a great Chorizo recipe. This was our first attempt at making chorizo to add to several dishes that call for it. I added 2 tsp of cumin for a nice flavor and also used a mixture of chili powders. Half of chili powder I used was the generic grocery store variety and the other half was pasilla chili powder. Next time I will add a third variety to fine tune the heat and chili pepper taste to our personal liking. I took the advice of one reviewer and reversed the volume of beef and pork so that there was twice as much ground pork as there was beef. My wife loved it and we will make this again.

Great recipe, but I use all ground pork in mine.  Also make sure you use Mexican Oregano and not the Mediterranean variety.  Great to put on lightly toasted corn tortillas with cilantro and salsa.  Also good on nachos.

Just checked the label on my store bought Chorizo  it's made with pork salivary glands and lymph nodes. This recipe will definitely be a welcome replacement. Thanks for the recipe Dylan

I loved the concept of using my own ground meat but the flavor just wasn't there.  If I try it again I will add more chile - probably from dried, red chiles, and the cumin and paprika most people recommended.

This is a good chorizo recipe but it lacked the traditional spice of Cumin.  I added 1 tsp of ground cumin (comino) and I added a few teaspoons of paprika.I will probably add a little more chili,too, next time.  Classic chorizo is made with chile pasilla (dried chili pods that are softened in water and processed until smooth.)   I will ommit the wine next time, too.  I found the proportion of meat to spice good, though.  It's an excellent recipe to start with.  Thank you.

For those who found this recipe bland, the kind of chili you use and the heat level of said chili makes a big difference. I always use at least 3 different chili powders and that gives a beautiful depth of flavor. If you like it spicy, use a hotter chili powder or add a tablespoon of ground chipotle for a wonderful smokey flavor. Also, this recipe is handed down to me from my Sonora Mexican mother-in-law, so it is authentic. Feel free to substitute a little more vinegar for some wine if you dislike wine. Of course adjust the oregano or add a little cumin if you like.

It's nice to know what's in your chorizo! This turned out great, so very easy.  I cooked the chorizo, added boiled, cubed potatoes, scrambled with some eggs, yummy!

I am delighted with this recipe which calls for normal ground meats. Ever look at the label when you buy chorizo from the store?  Pork hearts and salivary glands - yuck!  I have a few wonderful recipes that call for chorizo.  I will use this every time.  Thanks!

Followed the directions - found the basic recipe too bland.  Did not have the Kick I was inspecting.

Awesome recipe. I don't like the store bought stuff as I'm not fond of snouts and other random stuff that is typically inside (ie gristle and gross bits lol) but this chorizo is wonderful. Keeps a very long time. My husband is in seventh heaven when I take the time to make this for him (which will be again this weekend!). Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent in Burritos.  AND  Easy   Didn't have wine so I seasoned to taste and added a couple of chopped Pablano onions I happened to have.  Good with or without them.

This tasted pretty close to Chorizo, kind of like a chorizo burger, but I think it needs some cumin.  Still, it was very tasty.

This was pretty good but not outstanding. I was a bit nervous about the amount of chili powder called for but I actually wish I'd added more. I probably won't make this again, but thanks.
