I've been buying a salad like this at the supermarket, and was hoping to find the recipe. It's wonderful!I added some sliced water chestnuts for a little extra crunch, and it turned out great!

Wonderful flavor and combination of ingredients  It was very popular with my guests. I have one suggestion, however. Next time I will ADD THE CASHEWS AT THE LAST MINUTE and mix to coat with dressing, instead of mixing with other ingredients initially.  My cashews were not crisp after sitting in the dressing for several hours ahead of time.

This was good and easy.  I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup, and I am glad I did as it was plenty sweet enough with the reduced amount and the raisins.  I also added the cashews right before serving as others suggested.  I will make this again.

I wanted so bad to try this recipe, and I would hate it if I gave it a bad rating. However, I would not be sincere if I said I liked it. The main problem is that it was overly sweet - the suggested amount of sugar is too much, in my opinion. I like well balanced sweet/savory dishes, but this tasted like a dessert! Also, the sugar/mayo mixture was too thick, and the raisins added even more to the sweetness of the dish. All in all, it is an interesting idea, but the final result was a disappointment. I really wish I could rate it better.

I used 1/4 c sugar and added the cashews last. I also subbed craisins for raisins. I like that there wasn't a lot of dressing. Plenty sweet. Nice flavor.

I've made this numerous times now for parties and dinners. Everyone loves it! I use almonds instead of cashews and leave out the raisins. If I have them on hand, I've also thrown in walnuts along with almonds. If you're short on time this recipe will also work with pre-packaged bacon bits.

I don't like raw broccoli at all â€” or so I thought. I can't get enough of this salad. I had it at a catered event yesterday, and ran straight home to see if I could find a similar recipe online. This was right on the mark. My hubs thought it was too sweet, and though I like it as-is, it would certainly do fine with less sugar. I completely omitted the bacon (which wasn't in the recipe I was trying to copy and I don't eat it anyway). Delish!

Everything about this recipe is perfect except for the sugar.  I used a tablespoon sugar and it was more than enough.  That way the salad is also relatively healthy...which is good because I ate half of it in a day.

Next time I will add more dressing.  Used Spin Blend (which is like a healthy miracle whip), splenda and turkey bacon.  GREAT!

This salad is great except for the dressing. Too sweet with the cider vinegar and sugar, so I used white vinegar and cut the sugar by half. Also added shredded cheddar cheese which make it just like my favorite Broccoli Salad at Sweet Tomato. Family loved at a bbq,and taking it a friends house tomorrow who asked me to bring a salad with meat in it (they're English!).

Cut back on sugar to two scant tablespoons.  Broccoli to one pound, cut bacon to three, thick-cut diced bacon strips.  Mayo was a scant cup as well.  Just create a hint of sweetness.  Cut way back on white sugar.  To further rip off the author, to whom i am sorry, I used walnuts, not cashews.   Produced enough for four huge servings!

I liked the salad, but no one commented on it. I will make again though, I think it is more of a sumer time salad. Took advice and added cashews at the end to keep them crunchy. definetly a buffet / pot luck type of dish.

Could there be any stranger combination of ingredients?  Probably not.  Could they taste any better together?  Probably not!  Tastes just like Sweet Tomatoes/Souplantation's broccoli salad or the one you get at Costco.

I made this for a church function, and the recipe made three to four quarts worth of salad; I only brought home about 1 cup.  Everyone loved it.  The sweet and savory flavors blend well, and it's also colorful and attractive on the table--it really stands out in a sea of creamy pasta salads!

Brought this to a Christmas potluck and it was a total hit!  Completely devoured!

I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used only 1/4 cup of sugar, and it was perfect.  1/2 cup of sugar would have been too sweet.

I also used Craisins instead of raisins, like one of the other reviewers.  Since it was for Christmas, they gave the dish some nice color.

Will definitely make this again for future potlucks!

This is JUST what I was looking for when I searched for the salad like they make at Souplantation, also known as Sweet Tomatoes. After reading the reviews, I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and it is beautifully balanced. I only used 1/2 pound of bacon too, but it seems just right! I'll also be adding my cashews just before serving so they are more crunchy. It tastes SO good! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious, easy side dish. I've made it with and without the bacon, with mayo and with Miracle Whip (with a little less sugar). All variations turned out quite well but the original using bacon and mayo is probably my favorite. I mentioned the variations just in case one finds their pantry lacking. You'll still get good results without the bacon. If using Miracle Whip instead of mayo, decrease the sugar and vinegar just a bit.

I made this for Easter. I made it in the morning and added the cashews just before taking.  I made it exactly like the recipe and it was a big hit. Thank you for posting the recipe.  I am not the greatest cook and thanks to Allrecipes for making my life easier with great recipes and  ideas.

Great winter or holiday salad.  I substituted pomegranate Craisins as not everyone in my house likes raisins.   I ate all of my cashews,  LOL, so I roasted pine nuts in the bacon skillet after pouring off the grease leaving just enough to flavor and roast the pine nuts.

I leave the sugar out completely. No need to it in this recipe. sometimes I add shredded carrots and /or leave out the bacon. It's better after 24 hrs in the fridge.

I was trying to recreate a coworker's magical broccoli salad and this was the closest recipe to it! I did a bit of experimenting, do not blanch the broccoli. Even the slightest cook changes the taste and I really feel raw broccoli shines through with this salad. Toss the broccoli onion and dressing 30 mins before serving. Added the bacon and cashews at table, I don't use raisins,l. added just under 1/2 cup sugar, and kept everything else same.

I love this recipe! I made maybe one fourth of the recipe since it was just for me. So honestly I kind of eyeballed all the ingredients. It was about half a pound of broccoli, one tablespoon of mayo, less than one teaspoon vinegar, and about a teaspoon sugar. I added Cashews and Craisins and some red onion and a bit of bacon. It was amazing! I also ate about half of it as soon as it was done because I was so hungry and it was great, but I really recommend leaving in the fridge for about 2 hours as the recipe says because the flavor is intensified and the broccoli Is a bit softer. I used raw broccoli ( very well disinfected of course).  Awesome way to eat veggies!

This is the closest I could find to the salad at the local grocery store; we tried to reverse-engineer the salad, and this recipe is fairly close to our guess; fantastic as a side dish or as lunch. My husband loves this, too.

Loved it and so did every one at the luncheon that I took it to. 
Hint: I used Real Bacon Bit (not the imitation kind) instead of the pound of bacon. It was easier and feel like it was a little more healthier.
