I made this in my instant pot. I used frozen chicken pieces, and poured in the tomatoes, green chiles, rice, water, and chili powder. Cooked on high pressure for thirty minutes then added the remaining ingredients for an extra 10 minutes. Good for a cold winter evening!

Quick and easy! I doubled this for my Mexican-food-loving family. I used one large onion, two cloves garlic, left over chopped chicken, one can pinto and one can black beans, one can diced tomatoes with green chilies and spices and one can regular diced tomatoes, two cans corn, two cans diced green chilies, about a T of chilies powder and half a packet for f fajita mix. Cooked Mexican rice separately. Serve rice on the bottom, top with chicken mixture, garnish with cheese, sour cream, green onion and cilantro. Yum! Had it all done in less than 30 minutes.

I didn't have corn or Mexican rice. Instead, I made regular rice with the dish and added more salt and homemade taco seasoning with lots of shredded chicken. It was awesome!
Made for a wonderful burrito too! Will definitely make again!
