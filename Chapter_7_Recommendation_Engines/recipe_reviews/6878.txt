I too believe there is too much cardamom in this recipe, but I left countered it with 2 tsp. of cinnamon, and it helped a lot. I also added 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar to the dough as well. Very good alternative to more fattening breakfast breads, and the aroma is fabulous.

As written this recipe just does not work out, it needs extra liquid.  I have made these rolls twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, set my bread maker and came back to what looked like breadcrumbs.  So I through it out and started again.  I used the basic recipe but added Â¾ cup of orange juice.  This really was what the recipe required, I had used the pulp of a large orange but there was still not enough liquid.  I rolled out the dough and spread 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the top, then added the sugar.  I used a combination of Cardamom and cinnamon (even using just half the amount of cardamom in the recipe the taste was still quite overpowering), I then finished with raisins in place of the cranberries.  Rolled and cut following the recipe. I let rise in the covered oven before storing in the fridge over night.  The following morning I removed the rolls from the fridge and left on the counter for 45 minutes to bring to room temperature before baking.  I baked for 25 minutes.  I did finish off the rolls with the orange cream cheese frosting off this site.  Enjoyable rolls, once I had made the changes.

These would have been great but, yowza - that's a LOT of cardamom.  Cardamom is a very strong flavor and 1 teaspoon is just TOO much!  I will make these again, but I'm going to use 1/2 the amount.

I made these for my mom for Christmas and she and my dad loved them.  I tasted one for quality assurance purposes and it was pretty good even though I don't really like cranberries.  If I made them for myself I'd use another dried fruit instead.

I really like this!  I'm rating it at a 4 only bc bf wasn't wild about it and bc I do agree that 1 tsp of cardamom is too much.  I used 1/2 a tsp and it was plenty.  Made the dough last night, let it rise overnight and popped it in the oven when I got up.  Its hard for me to tell when these types of rolls are done--20 min wasn't enough, but I didn't realize until I served and they were doughy.  But thats an oven thing I just need to figure out!  I was worried they might need some frosting, but I think they are sweet enough as is, at least for me.  Had some difficulty with the dough, as it wasn't wet enough.  I used two clementines, though, and had to add about 3/4 cup OJ and milk (didn't think about OJ until I had added 1/2 c of milk--more OJ would've been better).  But I think the liquid will always depend on the amount of pulp you can get out of your orange(s).  Thanks for the recipe!

I read everyone's reviews about needing moisture and the cardamom, so I used 3 oranges and reduced the cardamom to a little less than half and added two teaspoons of cinnamon. I haven't used cardamom in cooking previously so thought I'd go with moderation. 
I also substituted  chopped dates (about 1 1/2 cups) rather than cranberries because I didn't have cranberries. 
YUM!! My husband and I both love these!!

I've been wanting to make this for a long time because I love cardamom.  They were good but unfortunately a lot of the filling came out on the bottom of the pan during baking.
