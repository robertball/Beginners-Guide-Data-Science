This was better than just 'OK' but I wouldn't say I really 'liked' it. As is, it tastes like a cookie-even with savoury toppings. I couldn't drink a beer or a glass of wine with this pizza. At first it seems really runny, like a batter. Hold tight! Let it sit a moment and you will see that it firms up in about 3 or 4 minutes. So let it rest before trying make your pizza. It stuck to the rolling pin so I just pressed it onto some parchment paper and it worked well that way. I cooked it on the oven rack with the paper only-no baking sheet. After pre-cooking for about 8 minutes, I topped it with mozzarella, artichoke hearts, capers and olives and put it back in the oven for 5 minutes. The texture was nice and performed well as a crispy crust-this is definitely its strong point.  After the first bite I added some oregano and some hot peppers. I think adding some oregano and some salt in the crust may compensate for the sweetness. The flax seeds give it a wholesome flavour and a nice texture too, so try to add those if you can. If I make this again, I will give it a more savoury edge before baking. I made a half portion thinking the "4 servings" as written in the original recipe would be too much for me and it was too small. I'd say that the original recipe is perfect for one personal sized pizza. Thank you AmiS for sharing your recipe.

This was not a good pizza crust! Not for the traditional cheese and pepperoni. Now to be fair this recipe may work well for a dessert pizza. I may try cream cheese and fruit or something like that. Thanks for sharing .
