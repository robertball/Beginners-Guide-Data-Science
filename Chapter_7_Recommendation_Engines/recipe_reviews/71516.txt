I really like this salad.  I had a friend in Cali that used to make it all the time.  If you like the fresh taste of cabbage, this is the "cole slaw" for you.  However, if you are expecting the traditional mayonnaise tasting dish, this is not for you.  Be adventurous and give it a try!  I recommend using a little garlic salt to add pizzazz.

Mix the dressing together in a separate bowl before adding to the cabbage for more even distribution. Freshly minced garlic is so much better. I didn't have cilantro so I used parsley instead. Don't forget the salt and pepper. A good base to add further vegetables to.

Good basic recipe for a lighter tasting cole slaw, but it really needs some salt and pepper. Okay, I just rated the actual recipe, not my version. I made this as a garnish for fish tacos. 
Here's what I did to help make it more interesting after tasting the posted recipe: I added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon of lemon pepper, salt to taste, and 1/2 t of Splenda to mellow things out. I'm planning to make it again and add some sliced or slivered almonds to make it more interesting. Thanks for posting this. It was an excellent place to start before adjusting it to our tastes. I don't think people get enough credit for sharing their recipes online.

I made this salad for Japanese Tonkatsu (which you can find on this site) I didn't have fresh cilantro so I omitted it, and I added lemon pepper and orange. It might be really good if I followed the recipe exactly. Thank you.

I will  make again.   I love Cilantro and loved the fresh taste, but you must let it sit for several hours and add plenty of salt and pepper, the flavors need time to meld.   Also the cabbage must be a very fine shred, I use nappa cabbage in long fine shreds. Very light and fresh.

I am always looking for something new to make for my husband and family.  This is a side dish I will probably not make again.  Wasn't good at all.  My husband didn't even eat it and I just ate it cause I had already made it and don't like to put food to waste.

I didn't really care for the dressing this salad called for. It just tasted like lemon juice to me. I ended up adding Italian dressing to the cabbage and that was pretty good.

This one is really bland, even with fresh lemon juice.  I added a finely minced serano pepper (from my garden), salt and a tsp of cumin.  Improved it but still not remarkable.
