After reading the reviews, here is what I did:  1.) Browned the chops with onion powder, garlic salt and pepper.  2.) Instead of 1 cup ketchup, I used 1/2c ketchup & 1/2c Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce(my personal favorite for all my pork recipes).  3.) Added 1Tbs Liquid Smoke.  I also decreased the cooking time to 5 hours on low.  The smell after a little while was great and the chops came out perfect.

I can't remember the last time I rated - BUT I HAD TO GIVE THIS 5 STARS.  Here are the hints I used to have great pork chops even my PICKY 4 year old loved!!  I browned the chops in onion powder, garlic salt and pepper.  I don't like mushrooms so I only have cream of chicken soup - it worked GREAT!  I used 1/2 cup bbq (Sweet Baby Ray - I think) and 1/2 cup ketchup.  I also only had the crock pot on 4 hours and just let them sit the last hour in the pot turned off.  WE LOVED THESE PORK CHOPS.

I already make a similar meal to this. Normally I use a can of Cream of Chicken soup, ketchup and the Wocestershire to make the sauce. This is a great way to go if you don't like mushrooms, which I usually don't. Since I already know how it tastes without the BBQ sauce I decided to try it the way previous reviewers suggested with half ketchup half BBQ sauce. This was a really tasty twist on a great recipe. I even used the cream of mushroom soup this time and you can't even tell there are mushrooms. I also cubed potatoes and cut up some carrots from the garden. I placed those on the bottom and seasoned with garlic salt and Italian seasoning. I sliced an onion and placed it on top of that. Next time I will do 2 onions. I placed the porkchops on top and poured my sauce over all. I had used slightly more ketchup and BBQ sauce than the recipe called for. No need to double up the sauce on this, even with the veggies on the bottom because the slow cooker will make the rest. I had plenty of yummy sauce for the meal and extra to pour over the chops once they were cut up. Thanks for sharing this recipe!
Also: I always make it with the Party Potatoes recipe from this site when I make mashed instead of cubed in the cooker.

My husband really wanted bbq porkchops so I too did the 50/50 ketchup/bbq sauce.  He said they were the best I ever made, usually I dry them out, not this time.  Made sure they were fully covered with liquid.  It's a do-over.

This was a great tasting, quick & easy recipe.  I added potatoes, carrots, sausage and the pork chops to the crockpot.  Since I was adding so much more food I doubled the liquid.  I made it with part BBQ sauce & part ketchup along with the cream of mushroom soup.  The meat turned out very tender.  Just as a side note, the pork chops do not need to be browned before placing in the crockpot.  I really wasn't sure if they needed to be or not, but since the recipe didn't call for it I didn't brown them & they came out great.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband just loved these and I have to say the title of this recipe is sooo fitting because this is definitely one of the "Easiest BBQ Pork Chop" recipes I've done on this site. Not, to mention you just throw it all in a crock pot and let it go. I seasoned the chops with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. After reading a couple of the reviews I used 1/2 c ketchup & 1/2 c BBQ sauce plus 1 Tbsp. each of worchestershire and liquid smoke along with the soup. I cut the onion into rings and layered them with the chops. These cooked perfectly on low in 6 hours. I served these with "Creamy Mashed Potatoes" from this site.

This is a great recipe.  My husband doesnt care for BBQ pork chops, but he gobbled these up and has already requested it again.  I did as other reviewers and did 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce.  I used 4 thick boneless pork chops and only cooked for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours on low.  They were very tender too, which doesnt seem to happen very often when I cook pork chops.  One of our familys favorite!

I was skeptical of this recipe but decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did!  It's easy and very tasty.  I used 1 1/2" thick boneless pork chops and I didn't even need a knife to cut them, they were so tender.  Kids loved it too.  Went great over rice.

I substituted barbeque sauce for the ketchup and combined all of the ingredients in a blender.  My husband, who insists that he hates onions and mushrooms, didn't know they were in the sauce - he went back for seconds.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

WOW!   Oh YEAH!!!  I did the 1/2 Ketchup - 1/2 BBQ sauce, as per many recommendations.  I did not fry the chops before putting them in the crock pot, I look for recipes that I don't have to do this!  I added a garlic seasoning mix to the mixture for a little added spice....  this was VERY VERY good, surprisingly good!!  and SUPER easy.  I served it over Basmati rice.  My husband loved it too!!!  I will make it again and again and again!

My husband and I are divided on the rating, thus a 3 star.  I loved it.  So flavorful, easy, etc.  I added a can of drained corn WHICH IS MY HUSBAND'S FAVORITE VEGETABLE and he still rated it "barely a 1".  He loves all of the ingredients but together, they do nothing for him.  I am happy to have the leftovers!!  Ha. Ha.

This was pretty good and definitely very easy. I did make some modifications based on what I had available and personal taste. I used cream of chicken soup since that's all I had. Also did 1/2 cup of ketchup and 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce. Also threw in some cayenne and a splash of white wine vinegar to give it an extra kick. I liked the fact that the soup seemed to temper the BBQ sauce so it wasn't overpowering. Also, I used boneless pork chops and cooked on low for 4 hrs. Chops were very tender! I will definitely keep this around. I'm only giving it 4 stars because without the mods that I made I think it would be too bland and ketchup-y sweet. Also, although the sauce was good, I would have liked it to be a bit thicker. All in all a very easy and good recipe.

This is a good basic recipe for pork chops. I made these tonight and they turned out great! I made a couple changes based on reviews and what i had on hand...i left out the Worcestershire sauce and reduced the ketchup to 1/3 cup and added 3/4 cup bbq sauce. Thanks for this recipe, I will definitely make these again!

I followed the recipe to the letter and the sauce had a very strange taste to it. The pork chops were extremely dried out also.

The recipe is really simple. The flavor is not anything spectacular, but it is pretty good. Next time I will try the half BBQ, half ketchup that other reviewers used. Thanks!

OMG...this was so good.  Ok here is what Mindy did.  In the crock pot I added about 4 cups of small carrots then about 3 cups of diced white potatoes, then I put 3 thick center pork loin chops on top.  Sliced a sweet onion and put on top of the chops.  Mixed 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup of your favorite bbQ sauce plus a dash of worcestershire sauce and a can of cream of chicken!  Spread on top of the whole mess and cook on high for 6 hours.  My mouth is still singing my praises, HA!  Good stuff, Mahalo for sharing!

I made this recipe and used half ketchup and half bbq sauce like some of the other reviews but I think it just tasted way too bland, like it was missing something.

I tried using the half ketchup half bbq sauce alternative, which I found to be a little on the sweet side for my liking.  However my especially picky 6 year old son LOVED it.  In his words it was scrumptious - this has never been said before unless a dish contained cheese, crackers and ham!!

Has a very generic taste. Be careful with the worcestershire cause it will make it way too smokey. I won't be making the recipe again.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. I followed others comments and did half ketchup, half BBQ sauce and it turned our great. The pork chops were falling apart tender and had a great flavor.

"Pork chops that melt in your mouth" was a comment from a guest when I served these.  My husband loves them, too.  I did substitute about 1/4 c of the ketchup with bbq sauce the second time, but all ketchup was fine, too.  Easy, delicious meat to serve for family or company.

I made this exactly as per the recipe. It was nice but the sauce isn't really BBQ and I'm not sure I would do it again. It was very easy to make though and that saved it only getting 2*

Overall this was good. I only gave 3 stars because I had to tinker with the sauce a bit. Here's what I did: 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup bullseye hickory bbq sauce along with all the regular ingrediants. After tasting the sauce during cooking I still thought it needed something more so I added 2 tbsp brown sugar and 1/4 package dry onion soup mix. I think next time I will add 2 tbsp chilli powder. Good luck!!!

We didn't like this at all, I ended up rinsing the sauce off the chops with water, drenching them with barbeque sauce and baking them for 15 minutes.

The chops came out really tender.  While the sauce was good, it didn't taste much like BBQ sauce.  I am going to try substituting BBQ sauce for the ketchup next time to see if that adds more BBQ flavor.

I would rate this less if I could.  Using other reviewers advice I used half ketchup and half bbq (sweet baby rays).  After about 4.5 hours in the slow cooker I went to check on it.       It tasted horrible, I can't understand how anyone would think this is good.  Needless to say, I rinsed off the chops, put them in a baking dish with Italian dressing and  finished baking in the oven for about 20 minutes.

I decided to try this recipe because I did not have all the ingredients for the one I usually use to prepare pork chops in the crock pot.  This is a very easy recipe but I agree with some of the other reviewers that it does not really have a BBQ flavor.  The meat was very tender.  My husband said he liked the recipe but I thought the tomato flavor of the sauce was a bit strange.  The ingredients are staples that I always have on hand so I might make it again.

Very nice recipe. Easily adaptable to be sugar free by sustituting tomato paste and artificial sweetener for the Ketchup. Also, I did not have any cream of mushroom on hand, so I had to use golden mushroom, and it turned out great. Contrary to what others have said, I do think that it has a BBQ flavor to it. Possibly because I used the golden mushroom. I did have to thicken it with flour. This is what we call a "do-over" in our family. Thanks!

This seemed too simple to be good. But it was great. I didn't change anything about the recipe and it was wonderful to smell cooking. Also, the meat was so tender, my fiancee said it was still tender when he reheated the next night!! We will definitely use this recipe again!! Thank you...
UPDATE: The meat is still super tender and the kids seem to enjoy well enough. My fiance has decided that he cannot eat it as it reminds him too much of MREs and therefore completely unappetizing.

I did not care for the sauce on this at all.  As others suggested, I substitued half BBQ (Sweet Baby Rays) for 1/2 of the ketchup.  The combination of ketchup/BBQ sauce and cream of mushroom soup created a sauce that had the consistency and taste of the sauce found in canned spaghetti. I use my crock pot all the time, and usually I simply brown the chops, put them in the pot and top with BBQ sauce and, sometimes, sliced onions. But creamed BBQ sauce is a whole other thing.  I'll stick with my old tried and trusted recipe from now on.

This was fantastic!  And really, really easy.  My hubby's always suspicious of recipes that use ketchup, but he loved this.  I added a little garlic, but otherwise left it alone, and it was fantastic.

very tasty. The whole family enjoyed them. I didn't find it to be very barbeque flavored though. If you are thinking bbq in a jar, it's not even close. Easy to prepare and delicious though.

I mainly tried this recipe because I want to start utilizing my slow-cooker more often.  Neither my husband or myself are big pork chop eaters, but I thought I this sounded pretty good.  I did NOT put any ketchup in it, it didn't sound good to me, but went ahead and followed the rest of it as instructed.  It was too greasy for my taste.  It was very tender, but I really doubt I'll use this again.  Sorry Janice.  Maybe if I do it next time I will try the ketchup.

The pork was great. Very tender and had a good taste to it. But I was expecting that the sauce would be thicker and more suitable for putting over rice or something from reading the other reviews.

Although my husband okay'd the recipe, neither I nor our dinner guest liked it.  I didn't even find the smell appetizing.  This recipe will be removed from my cookbook.  With so many others out there to try... pass on this one.

This was pretty good. Very quick and easy, and meat was tender--but it turned out rather greasy.   I would suggest a very good cut of pork and be sure to trim all the fat.  I thickened the sauce with flour and water and made a gravy.  It was good. OVERALL WORTH TRYING AGAIN!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I have to be honest, I was a little wierded out by the combination of ketchup & cream of mushroom soup, but it turned out great!  Next time, I think that I will make mashed potatoes, to use with the leftover "gravy."  It was just wonderful, and so easy!

We enjoyed these pork chops and I will definitley make them again.  So easy.  I used the thicker chops (around 1/2 - 3/4 inch).  I may cook them an hour longer next time because for some reason, some chops were more tender than others.  The gravy is good, but I will add some additional seasonings next time.

My husband really liked this although I copied the recipe from reviewer Kathy Kimball: I did everything except I added smashed garlic to it. I browned the chops in onion powder, garlic salt and pepper. I don't like mushrooms so I only have cream of chicken soup - it worked GREAT! I used 1/2 cup bbq (Sweet Baby Ray - I think) and 1/2 cup ketchup. I also only had the crock pot on 4 hours and just let them sit the last hour in the pot turned off. WE LOVED THESE PORK CHOPS.

This was okay. Putting it together, my husband thought it would be much more flavorful than it was. I even used the half BBQ sauce, half ketchup but it just wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Oh well, you win some, you lose some.

thanks very much for sharing this easy dinner.  We were invited to a texas bbq the day I prepared this, so I just took it along and cooked some rice when we got there and the 8 chops were eaten up and rec'd good reviews from everyone. My 2 picky kids & hard-to-please wife enjoyed also.

I wish I would have read the reviews ahead of time.    Although not a bad sauce, it is definitely heavy on the ketchup taste and doesn't taste like bbq sauce at all.  The chops were very tender and overall, had a nice flavor, just not quite what I was expecting.

The pork chops were good, but I think it would taste better if you put a different barbeque sauce in the crock pot with it; this sauce is too ketchupy.

I made this exactly  as the recipe called and it was YUMMY. I tried it a second time using 1/2 BBQ and !/2 ketchup and it was Super Yummy.
I read some other reviews about trying cream of chick or using the recipe for chicken. Let me tell you folks it didn't work out so good. I  used chicken breasts and cream of chicken  1/2 BBQ sauce 1/2 ketchup and it didn't even come close to being as good as the chops. Oh well its still a keeper.

My family loves this recipe, and I have made this for a few years now.  I always use boneless porkchops and they are so tender, it's hard to get them out of the crockpot!

This was quick and tasty. I gave it 4 stars because I followed other reviewers advice on the Sweet Baby Rays and ketchup combo and added minced garlic as well. Definitely worth making again!

Very easy to prepare, and smelled great. Pork was very tender. Sauce tasted a little odd, however. Didn't taste bad, but I will probably not be making this recipe again.

This came out quite delicious and exactly as describe with the pulling apart, it was very good, my only complaint is the smell of the food afterward is quite harsh.

These were the most tender porkchops I have ever made! Yummy! Tweaked the recipe a bit, as I had less porkchops to cook, but they were family approved. Will make again!

I did as some suggested and subbed half bbq sauce for half of the ketchup. I was very skeptical at first but my DH and I really liked this dish. The reason I gave it four stars is because DH said when he went back for seconds, it seemed to have a bitter taste to it. For me though, it was so tender. I couldn't get it out of the pot without it falling apart. I definitely will be making this again and perhaps add a little chili powder and/or a dash of curry powder.

I thought these pork chops were great, especially considering how easy they were to prepare.  The only change I made was using half ketchup and half bbq sauce as suggested.  Will definately make it again.

My family did not care for the flavor of these chops very much.  I have had better results using only chops and adding a bottle of barbecue sauce to the slow cooker.  A decent recipe, but we won't make again.

I followed this recipe to the exact instruction; I did not add, omit or tweak one thing...

Why I am dissatisfied is because by using my slow cooker, it tasted exactly like a pork roast to me & my family. We all had been smelling & therefore thinking about pork chops for 6 hours only to dish them up... And taste pork roast. 
From now on I will make my pork chops how I have made them in the past, pan fried or baked and save my slowc ooker for actual roasts.

I followed the directions nearly exactly and thought the sauce came out fairly well, though I agree it's not what I would have considered "barbecue." My complaint had to do with the dryness of the chops. They did not turn out tender at all and had no moistness to them. I cooked them for five hours in the slow cooker but I believe I may have to cut that back to four next time. Perhaps my cooker is running hot.Nevertheless, if I can solve the dryness issue, I think it'll be delicious.

We thought this was terrific!  I didnt' measure the ketchup nor the Worcestershire sauce- and just used dried onions.  I also added a can of mushrooms to it.  I agree that it doesnt' have a BBQ taste, but still, there was something appealing about it.  My kids loved it!  We will definitely be making this often!

I liked this recipe a lot!  I'm not sure why so many others didn't like the sauce, or thought it was too ketchup-ey.  I loved it!  The only thing I would change is to cook it 5 hours instead of 6.  This was so easy, and I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Based on other comments, I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  It turned out very well.  This is a quick and easy, but still tasty recipe - my favorite!!

Nice savory flavor but very salty.  Next time I will use low sodium soup and a little less ketchup.  I will also reduce the cooking time by at least an hour.  It may just be my new slow cooker, but the pork was a bit dry.  Maybe the addition of some stock a couple of hours in would also help.

"BBQ" doesn't really fit the description- didn't taste like a BBQ sauce at all.  Still tasty but I didn't like the mushroom soup in the sauce.

This was a realy good supper the only thing that I found was that I had to keep adjusting the heat setting so this would be a hard one to make in slow cooker while everyone is at work, maybe I have to ask Santa for a new cooker?!?! LOL

This is a wonderful recipe! We ate it over white rice. The pork chops are so tender. My 16 month old loves it. We just made 4 pork chops and it turned out perfect. Yummy!

Overall, not too bad...although I might try boneless chops next time (meat was so tender, that kids kept getting bones in their mouths.  Might try playing with the sauce a little as the kids weren't crazy about it.

Turned out great. The sauce was good and the chops were not dry.

My son and I enjoyed these chops, but my husband did not care for the sauce.  He did however, like the way the meat turned out....very tender!  I would make again with some modifications for my husband's taste buds!

Great recipe.  Melt in your mouth pork chops with a great sauce.  I will definitely make it again!
