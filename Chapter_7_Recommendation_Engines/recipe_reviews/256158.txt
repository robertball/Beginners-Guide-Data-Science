Used a sourdough starter recipe found on this site.  Used organic whole wheat bread flour, otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I had never made bread before and voila!

Pretty much the same as the no knead artisan bread but with sourdough starter. Excellent bread!

I was skeptical, having prior to this kneaded thoroughly and let my bread go through two 12-hour (or more) cycles of rising. I was using the "window pane test" and everything, but my whole wheat sourdough was super dense. I liked it, but couldn't serve it to family and friends. This recipe produced a less dense loaf with more sponginess, and I feel I could offer it to others, too.

I cut this back by half as I didn't have a pot large enough for the whole recipe but otherwise made as written. Mine was a little dense but that may have been my starter. Thanks for sharing. I forgot to mention that I didn't use the cornmeal, instead I used pleated parchment paper.

My starter is only 2 weeks old.  I made this for the very first time and I haven't baked/tasted my bread yet.  I made 1/2 recipe  (I live in a motor home and the oven is very tiny) and my starter is a baby starter . . .so . . .  I added 1/2 teaspoon yeast and replaced 1 1/2 Tablespoons of the flour with 1 1/2 Tablespoons of vital wheat gluten and 1 1/2 teaspoons of Diastatic Malt Powder for the same amount of bread flour.  I did NOT have a dough, I had a thick batter.  I got nervous as some of the reviewers indicated that the dough was too wet and very sticky.  So then I added more than 1 cup of extra flour to make a soft but a little bit sticky dough . . . It is resting for the first rise of 12  -  15 hours. . . I am hopeful.  Boy Howdy, did my bread rise!!!  Yikes, it almost took over the kitchen in less than 4 hours!!!  Next time I won't add the extra yeast--it absolutely didn't need it--and they tell me that a long slow rise makes a better sourdough bread.  Just pulled my bread out of the oven, let it cool and buttered up a slice and ate it---I will absolutely make this bread again -- despite my starter being so young, the 4 hour verses the 12-15 hour rise as instructed--this was VERY impressive bread and I can't wait til my baby starter grows up so that it will have a more pronounced "sour" taste!!!  I just need to work on removing my bread from my Banneton--it was a soft dough so I had trouble getting it where I wanted it--I might even add a little bit more flour--maybe

I  am a bread making beginner, and it took me a couple tries to get this bread to work out fine, but once it did, oh boy, it was so worth it. Better than any store-bought.
