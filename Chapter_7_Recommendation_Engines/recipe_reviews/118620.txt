These were really good! I like the sweet/salty thing these carrots have going on. I wouldn't use a whole packet of ranch, though. I used 3/4 of the packet and found the carrots almost too salty. I would reduce the amount of butter and sugar too. There was a lot of sauce even for a pound of carrots.

I absolutely love this recipe.   You can cook the carrots to be a bit softer for those that prefer them that way, or just long enough to keep the crunch.  You can also make it ahead of time and just heat it up.  Great for large crowds.

Didn't really like them. They were tasty but way too greasy. It called for 1/2 stick of butter....and only 16 ounces of carrots. Well, I made the who 32 ounce bag and they were still so greasy. Think I will pass on this one.
