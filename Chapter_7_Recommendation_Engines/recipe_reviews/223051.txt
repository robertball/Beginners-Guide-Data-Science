While many of us have enjoyed Chef John's recipes, I must admit that this recipe will not be repeated in my kitchen. Pureeing the kale, leek and scallions left me totally unimpressed with the overall texture and presentation of the dish. Two tbsps of butter at every step was absolute overkill of a good thing as was the scallion and butter topping. I followed the recipe as written - no tweeking. Reviews, of course, are influenced by one's personal taste, so remember that this is "just my humble opinion".

I gave this four stars because I changed a few things but the results were great.  First, I did not blend the greens.  Instead, I chopped the kale and leek to pretty small pieces before boiling.  I drained the greens and squeezed out all the excess water using paper towels.  I also sauteed the green onions plus two cloves of garlic in one tablespoon of butter.  Then I just mashed everything up with the cream.  I thought the results were great and everyone at my St. Patrick's day party liked it.

I tried this as it was healthier Colcannon recipe than I usually make. It also looked pretty with the green kale.  However, despite sauteeing the kale and leeks I thought the kale was tough. I prefer Dianne's Colannon found on this site.I did make this recipe twice as I did a test run before St. Patrick's Day.

I made the mistake of just sauteeing the greens instead of running them through the blender.  The flavor was good, but the texture would have been much better if I'd blended the ingredients according to the recipe.

These were a huge hit at my St. Patrick's Day Pot Luck Party!  Something different, fun and festive green! Kids love mashed potatoes and since the kale is put in the blender, there is nothing for the little one's to stick their nose up at. Just tell them it's food coloring! I did a triple batch to accommodate 12 people and it was just enough.

This was wicked good! We did it with Kale as called for and it was really delicious. Had it with pork chops in pork gravy and warm brown bread. It'll be on our Easter menu with Ham.

This recipe was a delightful surprise.  Mine was a bright green which was perfect for St. Patrick's day.  The leek and green onions added such a great flavor! You can't really taste the kale but you know it's there.  Nice way to get kale into your diet.  I will definitely be making this again!

used more heavy cream than the recipe called for because otherwise they seemed too dry.

Loved! with a few tweaks (based on what I had at home). Substituted Yukon potatoes and cabbage over russet and kale. Boiled leeks and cabbage 20 min. Added a little garlic.  Wa La!  Paired with some Albacore - Delish!

Made as directed except I never measure butter when I make mashed potatoes or Colcannon. I used unsalted butter softened slightly, and added a small chopped cabbage to the greens while boiling for extra green. Kids love it and my friend asks for it every year on his birthday which happens to be St. Patrick's day. If you're getting an off texture when you puree the greens, do so in small batches,. You can reduce the amount of butter while pureeing by leaving a small amount of the cooking water with the greens. I also save a bit of the pureed greens to top either corned beef or leg of lamb that I serve with the Colcannon.

Not Irish, so no idea how much of a usual colcannon this is, but it was fantastic! I think it might be my favorite mashed potato recipe. I followed this to a T to use up our garden green onions and kale, and even the picky kids loved it. They did say it was better with soy sauce sprinkled on. (Half-Asian kiddos; what to do. :) )

Awesome recipe for  mashed potatoes on st. Patrick's day. Very tasty with perfect color. I did make one addition to the mix, saw it in the fridge and thought it would add to the flavor. Pesto! Will make it again and not just for the holiday
