Very nice flavor, which I’m convinced is largely because of the dried minced onion which I made a point to use, even tho’ I did make a couple of other small changes to the recipe.  I added a dab of butter to the rice as it cooked, using beef broth rather than water and bouillon.  Because I used fresh rather than dried herbs (including oregano rather than marjoram which is an acceptable substitute) I held off adding them until just before serving to preserve their  vibrant color.  Strictly for the punch of color I also added a handful of peas at the same time. I found this needed no salt, but did give it several turns of fresh ground pepper.  As the first reviewer of this recipe I'm pleased to say we  enjoyed this simple and humble rice side dish very much.

I tweaked this recipe a lot  and it is a family favorite around here.  It is super filling and really, really tasty with a low calorie rating of only 229 cals per serving!  Not too mention it is super healthy.  I added black beans and mushrooms to my recipe to add a little bit more texture in the mix!

I tried the recipe just as-is.  It tasted great, but was kind of dry.  Any suggestions on how to moisten it?

Not bad, but next time I will omit the spices and substitute with garlic. The minced onion was a nice addition but the herbs over powered the rice and the flavours just didn't go well together.

This kind of dish can also be prepared using barley in place of rice. I, too, use low sodium beef, veggie or chicken broth instead of water and bouillon, as it's less salty. In place of butter, I add a generous dollop of garlic oil (homemade with 1/2 evoo and 1/2 canola with 3-4 crushed cloves of garlic in the bottled oil, and kept in the fridge). This oil adds a very mild hint of garlic, and helps to keep the rice (or barley) from getting sticky. If the dish is still too dry for your taste, you can add 1/8-1/4 cup of broth to the mix until it gets to the consistency you like. Just add the liquid in small increments. FYI ~ There are some very good combos (often trios) of grains packaged in the markets. I like brown rice, wild rice and barley in combo, and often add curry powder to taste for seasoning. Don't be afraid to experiment, as these grains are very forgiving!

Very easy to make with what you have on hand at home, but nothing memorable.

This is so easy and tasty. This is the second I've made this. I followed the recipe but used long grain brown rice instead of white, chicken bullion instead of beef, and added 1 tbsp butter and a 1 tsp of salt, as per rice cooking package instructions, 1 tsp refrigerated minced garlic, and Parmesan cheese to taste after cooking. The cooking time was 45 minutes with the brown rice, again as per rice package instructions, and I used 2 and 3/4 cups hot water.

The first time I made it I used minute brown rice and chicken broth instead of water and bullion. The cooking time was a lot quicker, obviously, but I needed to I add an extra 1/4 cup of broth to moisten it. I also added a tbsp or two of Kerrygold's herbed butter and Parmesan cheese after the rice was done cooking.

I usually use chicken broth, but it was very good with the beef flavor. The dried onions were a nice touch, too. Also added a little butter and a handful of peas. Just noticed I forgot the rosemary, which I'm sure would make it even better. Thanks for the delicious and very easy recipe, Tina! I'm sure I'll use it again.

am now just cooking this and it smells so good.  But of course I had to use a bit (1/4 c ish) of beef broth as I had no granules.  Minced onion...nope..used dried chives  2 tsp  why not?  Taste test revealed 1/2 tsp salt next time but seriously delish..this will freeze well to be a second meal with pork chop or fish..tonight chicken breast :)

I could not use the onion or beef broth.  I simply cooked the rice in water with the rosemary, marjoram, and thyme.  I added some olive oil after cooking so it is not so dry.  I have also added butter instead of the olive oil after cooking, and that was good too.  This is super easy and fast for me to make, so I make it often.

just okay- I found the rice a bit dry.  it might be because  I used ground thyme, I didn't have dried, and I just used onion powder, I didn't have the dried onion..

I used about 1/2 of a onion instead of the dried onion - I put a little butter in the pan and sauteed the onion until it was translucent. I also used fresh rosemary - great recipe that's more flavorful than plain ole white rice.
