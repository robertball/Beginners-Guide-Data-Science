I tried this because I love coconut and pineapple. I used fresh pineapple, so there was not much juice, so I added a little water. I also increased the butter to 9 T and doubled the brown sugar topping to fill a 9x13 pan. I also used sweetened coconut ,and the topping turned out delicious! I knew the cake would be dense, so I increased the baking powder to 1 tsp, but it still turned out dense. The crumb was not as sweet as I expected, but very coconutty, which was actually  a nice balance to the sweet topping. I would prefer it a little lighter,  but it still was good. Next time I would probably increase the flour and leavening.
