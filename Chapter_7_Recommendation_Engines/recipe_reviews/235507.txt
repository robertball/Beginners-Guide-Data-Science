8.9.18  I’ve been working on cleaning out my freezer and ran across a bag of cranberries I’d bought on sale after the Holidays.  We’re not into super sweet food these days, and cranberry sauce often is, so I reduced the sugar by 50% and then substituted Truvia®.  Even after seven months in the freezer, these cranberries had good flavor that was accented by the OJ and the Triple Sec.  Those two ingredients really style up a basic cranberry sauce.  Growing up, my family only had cranberry sauce during the traditional Holiday season, but we like it so much, I serve it as a side dish throughout the year.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is really good! I changed it just a bit- used only cranberries, orange juice and walnuts....so good!
