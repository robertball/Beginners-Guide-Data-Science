This soup was absolutely delicious! I got rave reviews from my family with requests to make it again.  I followed most of the recipe but did not have leeks so I used vidalia onions instead.  They added a lovely flavor to the soup.  I roasted the butternut squash instead of sauteing it, which always brings out a richer flavor in my experience.  I also garnished the soup with fresh , diced, green onions along with the bacon.  It was fabulous.
A few family members are trying to follow the Paleo diet and this was pretty close to what is allowed.  Next time, I may try sweet potatoes instead of carrots as carrots are not allowed.
Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I followed this recipe to a T., including sweet onions and cider. This soup was a huge hit and was requested the next night for leftovers...which was even better! I served it with goat cheese crumbles infused with cranberries, pumpkin seeds and chopped bacon.  Sooo delicious!!!! Will definitely be part of our Thanksgiving tradition for years to come!

I made it pretty much according to the recipe,  although I probably didn't have all 6 cups of squash, and I used some Fuji apples I had instead of the Granny Smith.   The apple flavor was pretty strong, and I wasn't sure I liked that combination with the thyme and sage.  Then I garnished it with a lot of cinnamon, a little nutmeg, and sunflower kernels, and I liked it pretty well.  My wife fixed grilled bacon and cheese sandwiches, with bread-n-butter pickles on them, to go with it, which was perfect.

I wanted a fall soup, and this is excellent.  I didn't have all ingredients on hand so I used Apple juice and white onions.    Still great.  Very filling and satisfying

Delicious! I made it as written and added a bit of ginger. Entire family liked this. It was very clean tasting and flavorful. I might try with vegetable broth next time to make it truly vegan as an alternative for some friends who have adopted a vegan lifestyle.

Excellent autumn soup.  Replaced the apple cider with apple juice.   Otherwise followed the recipe.

I did not use leeks, but used sweet onions and I didn't measure anything.  I eyeballed it all.  It was super easy to make.  The hardest part was getting the butternut squash ready for cooking.  Excited that we have enough to freeze for future meals.  It is extremely tasty and easy to make.  Hubby liked it better than the squash soup at Panera, which is a huge plus.  Even my son ate it and is excited that we can have it again.
