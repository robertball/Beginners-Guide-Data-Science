These are easy, quick and tasty. They are kind of like a crispy, peanutty "s'more". The only downside would be that, for as fast and easy as they were, I seemed to have a LOT of dirty dishes when I was done. I don't have a glass 9x13 pan (and if I did, I'm not sure it would fit in my microwave!) so after I put the marshmallows over the graham crackers, I put the pan under the oven broiler until the marshmallows were puffy. I'll make these again. I'm wondering how they would be with a thicker layer of marshmallows.

I made this for a group of teenagers and they all thought it was awesome! I didn't have enough marshmallows so after melting them I filled in the gaps with marshmallow fluff.  I might try just using that instead of the marshmallows next time.  This recipe  was very easy to make. I will definately make this again and again.

This was so easy to make!  I had the kids make it with practically no help from me, just a little guidance.  They were thrilled to offer their friends treats they had made that taste great!  They are a big hit around hear, sure to become a fast regular around our house.

I am a big texture person.  This treat satisfies the chewy, crunchy, soft, smooth, and rough all in one.  This was so good and I will make it again and again.  I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out perfectly!

We didn't care for these at all.  The rice krispie layer reminded me of those old-fashioned chocolate no-bake cookies except made with RK instead of oats.  Overall not very tasty.

This was a great recipe, and very quick to make.  I couldn't fit a 13x9 inch pan in my microwave, so I had to do that part in the oven, but otherwise it worked great!

I made these with white chocolate chips b/c that's what I had in the pantry, and they were yummy.  I used the conventional method and found that my bottom layers did not stick together so well, but the taste was really good.  Thanks for sharing.

I love the ease of making these.  I didn't change ingredients on this one, but I did decide to not use the microwave for the chocolate mixture (used the stove-top instead).  I'm giving these away for Christmas goodies and know they will be a hit.  Just one hint - they are VERY HARD to cut after refrigeration.  I'd advise letting them sit out for an hour before cutting.  Thanks for sharing!

These are so tasty.  The recipe is really easy, super-simple to whip up in a hurry. They are a little on the sweet side, so if you don't like really sweet desserts then they aren't for you.

Not the biggest fan of rice krispies but thought I'd give this one a try.  Glad I tried it.  Tastes good.  It's SUPER easy... but not sure it's going to make it through my kitchen again.

These were very easy to make. I brought them to a chocolate buffet, and everyone loved them. I boiled the mixture for a solid 1 min 15 seconds, and then instead of dropping the batter into cookies, I pressed them into a 9x13 pan. After they cooled, I cut them into squares. Yum!

This recipies is great, but I saw it prepared with a different cream layer.  It looked like cream cheese and marshmallow.  Any ideas?

These are very yummy. Chewy crispie chocolate. I really liked the crunch of the crackers, but I was annoyed by their crumbling. I thought I'd try a graham cracker crust next time, although the crunch is a nice contrast to the chew! I used about 3 cups mini marshmallows to get a single layer covering the crackers. I put it in a 350F oven for 2-3 minutes, until the marshmallows were puffy. I will make these again for sure.
