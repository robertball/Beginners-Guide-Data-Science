The condensed milk ratio is too high and the "sour" is too strong from the sour cream.  try adding 4oz of whipping or heavy cream to soften the sour taste for a sweet cream fruit salad dressing

2.25.19  This dressing was ideal for a fruit salad of fresh pineapple, blueberries, strawberries, and cantaloupe.  Its title tells you that it’ll be sweet, but that sweetness is offset by the sour cream. Wouldn’t change a thing, this was very good.

As usual ' I didn’t have one of the ingredients (cardamom), but I added a little pumpkin pie spice, and substituted the sour cream with a little whipping cream as another poster suggested to lighten it up. Although I prefer a fruitier sauce (which I didn’t have the ingredients for), this came out tasting pretty good. Thanks for a quick and easily tweaked recipe.
