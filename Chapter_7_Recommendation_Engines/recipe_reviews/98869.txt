This was delicious. I cooked the meat and put it in a slow oven with lemon slices on top to keep warm while I finished the rest of the meal. It was tender and very flavorful. My husband ate up all the leftovers, which is something he never does.

Yumm!!  My whole family loved this one - even my young girls!  They loved the "skin".  I tenderized the meat before dipping it.
