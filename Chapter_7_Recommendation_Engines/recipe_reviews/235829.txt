This may not be pretty to look at, but it sure does taste good! I must admit I tried this out of a sweet tooth craving and being that this makes a cake for one in under 5 minutes I figured what do I have to lose? It's simple, easy and really hits the spot when you want something sweet without a lot of effort. Perfect with a cup of hot tea!

Wow!  I've read so many bad reviews of mug cakes that I was skeptical- but I wanted to give it a try.  So glad I did!  Delicious!  I did have to use a full 3 Tbsp of apple sauce to get a batter and it took 2 1/2 minutes to cook (I checked every 20 seconds after the first minute) but it was awesome!!  Perfect for making dessert for one.

I just tried this recipe to preview it as a quick breakfast for a day that will start rather early. I substituted the applesauce for one whole egg and a splash of vegetable oil. I also added more sugar to the batter along with honey and cinnamon. It's pretty delicious.

Yum! I used a little bit less than one tablespoon of butter for the batter and it came out fine. For the applesauce I used cinnamon applesauce and I added a few teaspoons of chopped walnuts to the topping. Microwaved for 80 seconds and BAM! Instant coffee cake!

I was completely surprised by this. It really was good, and I'll make it again when in the mood. I used 2 T applesauce, and mine took 80 seconds exactly. It was thick, but not overly, and it was moist. Now, you can't rate it by comparing it to a regular coffee cake, but for how easy and fast it is, I give it 5 stars! (My prep was less than 10 min.)

Well mine didn't come out looking like the picture but I'm still licking my lips.  I didn't have brown sugar for the crumb topping mix - used white, and had to make applesauce using apples water and cinnamon. The cake was a bit dense in texture but still tasted great!  Looking forward to my next serving

We loved it!  My friend came over and I didn't want to make anything big since it was just the two of us.  I found this recipe and made it just as it says to.  We thought it was great!  I did make a powdered sugar/milk icing for it.  Fabulous!

I was craving coffee cake but did not have eggs in the house when I came accross this recipe. Unbelieveable! The consistency and taste are very close to a standard coffee cake., and the serving size is perfect. Genius!  I added extra applesauce like the others. Do be careful as it is stays hot for awhile. Thanks for a great craving fix!!!

This was a simple recipe and had I followed it exactly as written it would have been perfect I suspect.  But I expected it to rise more so I continued to cook it past the given time. So I overcooked it and it was tough.  But the flavor was still nice. I doubled the topping and it was perfect that way because  I have a sweet tooth.

I can only think that the bad reviews either are not familiar with depression era cakes, or had bad applesauce.  This cake turned out perfect in my microwave, and I have tried a lot of these.  Most of them have turned into an exploded mess, but this one came out perfect!  I did add a little pumpkin pie spice to the crumble on top because I am ready for fall!  Trying to adapt this for my bread machine as my oven is out of order at the moment, and while nice for a single serving, my kids came downstairs and wanted me to share what smelled so good last night!

This was just bad.  Texture was weird and it was kind of tasteless.  I dumped apple sauce on it and managed a couple bites before I gave up and threw it away.  I can't even think of a way to improve it.

I did not have applesauce so I used 3 tablespoons of apple butter instead. I also had some blueberries that were almost on their way out, so I put them on the bottom of the mug. The cake still turned out great. I did have to microwave for 2.5 minutes.

Delish! Followed recipe to the T and it was really good. Only change I'll make next time is to swirl the cinnamon mix throughout the batter so I get some in every bite!

Added 2 tbs of applesauce instead of one and a bit of cinnamon turned out perfect at exactly 80 seconds.

I have made this twice now, most recently on Valentine's morning.  What a nice, simple treat.  I did use more apple sauce.  And cinnamon, because I love it.  And added nuts.  I think the dryness or gooey texture might be because of the microwaves' different cooking strengths.  So play with it and enjoy the failures!

Made this for my little guy and it was ugly but tasted good!  Was boiling hot for quite a while.  They decided to top it off with some milk to cool it off. Add extra applesauce as others suggest.  Worth a try!

I followed the suggestions and added extra applesauce, I had to to make a batter. It came out with a very gummy texture. I was greatly disappointed.

So good !!! I loved it !!! It's deliciously and like real cake although it doesn't look pretty. It was easy too!! I'm eating it right now. Really calms the cravings. Thanks for the recipe. The only I changed was that I added more applesauce but that's it .

If in a desperate pinch, it would do and I see potential in the recipe, but the way it is, it just doesn't completely work.  Dough was rather gummy.  I'm going to play with the ingredients/ratio and see if I can create something along this idea.

Total fail.  Dense, not a lot of flavor.  Dough was very dry even though I added 3T applesauce (but it was homemade so maybe it wasn't runny enough).  I will try again since others' comments are so positive.
