Yummy! I made this for a church function and wanted to fill a 9 x 13" so added 2 more eggs and a 1/4 Cup more milk. I left out the dry mustard and instead of regular salt I used seasoning salt. I had to cook it about an hour. The dish was cleaned out, everyone loved it!!

Instead of white bread I added Pillsbury crescent rolls.  I put a layer on the bottom of the pan and a layer across the top.  I also added a little more cheese.  Very good!  :)

I'm supposed to give this 6 stars out of 5, to quote the kids.  Another quote: "This stuff is the bomb."  Easy, feeds a lot of teens.  I kind of doubled the recipe, except I didn't have double the cheese or sausage. Also, I diced a couple baked potatoes in there instead of some of the bread.  I also added a little red pepper flakes for some zip.  I knew my sausage was very mild so added some poultry seasoning when I was cooking it in the microwave.  Anyway, obviously not a picky recipe but very good & easy.

Very simple and quick, keeps well for a couple days covered.  I found it's not really necessary to overnight it in the fridge, a couple hours seems to do just as well (my family likes breakfast for dinner).  It was a little bland so I used hot sausage the second time and we liked it much better - perked up the flavor but not so spicy the kids couldn't/ wouldn't eat it.  Be SURE to grease the pan well.

Better than 4 stars, but not quite a perfect 5 either.  Great recipe for brunch or company since prep is done the night prior and it is put in the oven the next day.  I added bacon as well since I was short of sausage.  I would definitely make it that way again-it was a good combo of flavors.  Not hard to make and quite good too!  Also was great as a leftover.

I let it bake for 30 minutes and then gave it a quick stir and tossed some extra cheese on top.  Baked for about 10-15 minutes longer and it was just right!  I will make this again!

Yummy and easy- my husband loved this so much he wishes he had an extra stomach. I made a couple of changes- instead of the dry mustard, I added about a quarter cup of maple syrup to the milk/eggs mixture for a little sweetness, and I threw in some thyme and sage. I also added some mushrooms I had on hand. Yum! Will make this again for sure.

After making this a few times I have made the following few changes that make it turn out the way I like it:
1)  8 eggs (instead of 6)
2)  2-1/4 cup milk (instead of 2 c.)
3)  Wheat bread (instead of white)
4)  1-1/4 cup cheese (instead of 1 c.)
5)  Brown the sausage w/ chopped onion + garlic
     powder (to taste)
It takes right at around 45 minutes to cook completely.

This was so delicious and easy to prepare!  I made it for a going away part for a coworker and it received rave reviews from everyone!  I did finely chop half of a sweet onion, half of a green pepper, and half of a red pepper, and I added about 4 more eggs and a little more milk.  I also used croissants instead of bread, which made it extra yummy! I am definitely making this Christmas Eve to be enjoyed Christmas morning!

This was very tastey & easy.  I wanted to feed a few more people so, I made 1 1/2 times the recipe.  This fit perfectly in a 9x13 baking dish.  The basic recipe is a good 4 star recipe as is but, if you really want to bump it up to a 5 star... Add 1 medium onion chopped, 1 green bell pepper chopped, 1/2 lb cubed ham and some sage.  Cook this along with the sausage... the aroma is heavenly!  As recommended, I assembled this dish the night before and let it sit out 1/2 hour the next morning before cooking. It was taking longer to cook than I expected so after about 25 minutes, I bumped the temp up to 400 for 10 minutes, then to 450 for another 10 minutes and it came out fine.  It might have taken longer to cook because I increased the recipe size. Next time I'll just allow for extra cooking time in my schedule.

I did nothing different with this recipe except add pepper.  It rocks!  I didn't have time to let it set overnight and it was still good.  Could possible even increase eggs to 8 and still have a good flavor - and have it go just a bit further.

I have been making this for a few years now. The 9x13 pan is too big for this recipe.  I add 2 more slices of bread, 2 extra eggs and use 16 oz of cheese.  It comes out beautiful.  I also bake for 1 hour.  I do add onion and only use 8 oz sausage.  My office and family LOVE it.

This is definitely a keeper - one of those great recipes that uses items that you'll almost always have on hand.  I've made it exactly as written and the result was creamy and delicious.  I've also made it a number of times with minor variations (cubed ham, sliced deli ham, cubed sausage links, etc) with great success.  Other things that I've added to good effect:  pimentos, artichoke, thyme, mushrooms.  Wonderfully forgiving recipe.  Try it, you'll love it!

This is a delicious and flexible recipe. I made this in a 9 x 13 pan with two additional eggs (as another reviewer suggested), along with some extra bread and milk. I served it for brunch on Christmas day, and my family enjoyed it. Next time I plan to play with different breakfast meats and additions, like spinach and mushrooms.

I was looking for an easy breakfast recipe to use up some of my husband's venison sausage and some day old dried up bread and I chose this. Since I wanted to make this today I only let it set in the refrigerator for two hours before baking. It turned out great - so if you are on a time crunch and don't have 8 hours or overnight give this dish a try. I did omit the salt since I'm trying to watch our intake. It didn't need it at all. I think the seasoning from the sausage and the sodium in the cheese was enough to give this dish plenty of flavor without the added salt. I did use finely shredded 2% colbyjack cheese. This dish was very tasty.

This was a great, easy recipe.  I omitted the mustard because not all the family likes mustard.  I also didn't have time to let it sit overnight, so I mixed everything up in the morning and then cooked it.  It was great! The kids absolutely loved it!

This is one of my absolute favorite breakfast casseroles. I grew up with my grandmother making this for us kids when we visited. It was always a hit! However, I did make some modifications--like others, I cooked it about 10-15 mins longer than stated so the middle would cook-through and not be mushy. Like my grandmother, I used white bread but cut the crust off and placed the 6 slices whole on the bottom of the pan, layering the rest of the ingredients. I added 1 more egg and little bit more milk to the egg mixture. The next morning before it went in the oven, I added a top layer of cheese. Will definitely be making this again!

My family absolutely loved this and ate every bit!  I made it at the last minute this morning, so I actually used mozzarella cheese because that is all i had, and i didn't let it sit.  I can't wait to try it again with cheddar cheese....I plan on making it Christmas morning.

This was perfect for feeding folks after church.  Made the casserole exactly as directed Saturday night, took it out of the fridge & put it in the oven on "time bake" before we left for church Sunday morning. When we arrived home, the house smelled wonderful. The casserole was done and rested for the required time while we set out drinks and washed our hands!  While I might experiment with seasoning and ingredients, it will only be out a sense of adventure. The recipe is perfect as is.

Delicious!  I made two versions:  One vegetarian friendly, one note.  Both were a huge success.  In place of sausage I used morning star sausage links. After cooking them on the stove top I minced them and added to the dish.  The only significant different I made to both dishes was added sauteed onions and garlic.  Overall - fabulous dish that I will use many times to come.  thanks!

I like to also add a can of chopped green chilies.  Sometimes will use Texas toast, but you will have to add many more eggs.  I made this last year before I went out for New Years Eve and the next morning had friends over for breakfast.  It was a great way to begin a New Year..

Like a previous reviewer, I had a crowd to feed so I added two eggs and increased the milk to 2 1/4 cups.  It says you have to let it sit overnight, but I was only able to let it sit for 20 minutes or so, and it came out great, took about an hour to bake.  I also sauteed 1/2 onion and sliced red peppers with the sausage, so it was colorful and tasty.  Used wheat bread since I try to avoid white.  I got a ton of compliments on this one - all men, and they said it was delicious.  The pan disappeared within minutes.

Substitute turkey sausage for a different flavor.  Any type of leftover bread can be used, leave crusts on for a bit more flavor as well. My family prefers a whole wheat type of bread.

I prepared this the night before and refrigerated. I was delicious at brunch. I used a "medium" pork sausage which gave a little bit of a spicy flavor. I also added 1/2 of a red bell pepper and 1/2 of a green bell pepper both finely chopped. I sauteed them in the pork sausage drippings just a little bit and then added to the casserole mixture. Very, Very good. I will make this one again.

Perfect for a 9 X 13 dish with 8 eggs and 8 slices of bread.  Plenty flavorful without adding any veggies, but veggie lovers could certainly do so.  Top it off with a little hot sauce - delicious and crowd-pleasing!  I was unable to make it the night before the first time, and it was perfectly fine.

I love this casserole.  Great to make ahead for a crowd for breakfast.  Easy to reheat in the microwave. I use Jimmy Dean's breakfast sausage, I think it has the best flavor.  Instead of bread I add a cup of flour.  It's just like an impossible pie and creates it's own crust.  Thanks Gayle.

Great recipe as is but there are so many possibilities!  I have one in the fridge now with ham, onions, red bell pepper, wheat and rye bread, and swiss cheese.  I can't wait to take it out of the oven in the morning.  Also, I like mine with more egg and less milk.

I've made this twice now--both with FANTASTIC results!  I used some maple-flavored sausage--which added a yummy sweetness.  The second time, however, I tried it in a smaller/deeper dish. Not evenly cooked. DEFINITELY go with the size pan listed in the recipe. I will next time :)

This was a delicious breakfast that our entire family enjoyed.  We did not refrigerate it overnight, we just mixed and baked it, and it turned our perfectly.

I had to adapt the recipe to what I had on hand, simply substituted venison sausage for the pork and wheat bread for white.  I also added a splash of worcestershire sauce and about 2 tablespoons of sauteed, minced onion.  The dish was delicious and fed 12 people with no leftovers.  It's now in the rotation for Sunday School breakfasts.

This was great. It tasted great and was easy to throw together. I used a combination of meats like sausage, bacon and ham. I added a little dehydrated onion mixture. I used a little more cheese than the recipe called for. I'm not sure if it really needs to sit over night. I'm sure you could throw this together early in the morn and toss it in the oven a few hours later. The whole family liked this and I will be making it again.

It was delicious!  I also added some celery salt and seasoning salt, mushrooms.  I cooked fried potatoes on the side. Put it all inside a tortilla with sour cream and salsa and made breakfast burritos.  It was one of my family's most favorite meals!

When I tasted a bit of the the sausage I browned for this recipe, I noticed that it seemed salty.  I should have considered this when I made the dish, because it turned out to be almost too salty.  I advise others making the dish to check the saltiness of their sausage before adding salt to the recipe.

It's ok, but it's too soggy. It might be better if the bread was toasted first. Maybe less milk as well. I'll try a different recipe next time.

made this for breakfast when the family was up, but changed a few things. I sprayed a pan and rolled out a package of creasant rolls into it. Then scrambled 8 eggs, 2 cups milk, 1 tsp salt, 1 cup shredded cheese, and a cup of biscuik, then added 1 lb of cooked HOT sausage. My family doesnt do hot things very well but they all loved it. The hot sausage gives it some flavor. Great recipe. The new family fav!

Edit 10/31/10: Make sure you buy regular breakfast sausage. Hubby bought maple sausage this past time and it wasn't nearly as good. ***This is an easy and yummy recipe for Christmas morning. It gets requested every year. What I like about it other than the taste, is that it gets prepped the night before, so you can relax and enjoy the morning while it bakes.

Wonderful.  Used 8 eggs, as suggested by previous reviews for a 9x13 dish, and also used sourdough sliced bread that I cubed.  Sauteed some sliced red bell pepper in the oil left over from browning the sausage and let the sausage and pepper drain on paper towels before adding to dish.  Really easy to prepare and LOVE that it's made the night before -- great timesaver!  Absolutely delicious and can't wait to make it again!

This recipe is a keeper! Making it the night before was great because there was nothing to do but pop it in the oven the next day. Smelling it while waiting for it was torture! It was filling but so good that it was hard to stop eating it. I did add a bit of bacon, but other than that I followed the directions in full. Easy and delicious!

I made the 4 serving 8x8 Version - 4 eggs, 1 cup milk, half of everything else.  I made the mistake of using wheat bread...the wheat taste was too overpowering.  We thought sour dough bread might be a good taste and not so soggy for next time.

Made this using two 7 oz pkgs of brown and serve links; cooked in microwave, thinly sliced. The bread was a nutty oat whole grain, the mustard, a squeeze of the spicy prepared kind.  I added some frozen spinach and some nutmeg, along with red pepper flakes, and used garlic salt.   It wasn't enough for my pan, so I transferred it into an 8x8 baking dish, and baked it right away.  Puffed up like a pretty souffle.  Delicious!!

So delicious!! I planned to make my egg casserole for my husband and his 3  buddies after a morning hunt. I soon realized I only had 5 eggs, but could not get to the store without taking 3 small kiddos...no thanks, so I came across this. I lessened each ingredient since I was still lacking an egg, and used whole grain wheat bread! Not a drop remained of this, it was quite delicious. Oh, and it only soaked for maybe 20 minutes before I cooked it, so no worries for anyone doing this at the last minute.

This was a huge hit at my morning meeting and several people asked for the recipe.  I added about a 1/4 cup of chopped green onions and used season salt instead of regular.  The casserole took closer to an hour to cook but I used a deeper, but shorter, 2 quart dish.

YUM!  I love breakfast food.  I loved how the egg soaked into the bread, making the casserole light and fluffy.  I got the wrong sausage--links instead of bulk--so I just cut the links into thirds, it still was good.  We enjoyed it on christmas morning.

I used egg bread from the bakery and tore it up. I put the bread in the dish, then topped with sausage and bacon (to keep it even throughout), then poured the egg mixture over it. I liked that I could make it the night before and would certainly make it again, but it didn't WOW me.

It was really good. I added half chopped onion while I was cooking the sausage to add some flavor.I also tried a reviews recommendation of using crescent roll dough instead of bread for the bottom and top. The top was great.... but the crescent roll dough on bottom got soggy from the egg mixture :( but still tasted amazing when you pulled that part off :) I recommend this recipe with those minor tweaks, enjoy!

This is one of those yummy feel good...not good for you breakfast items:)  I'm sure you can make this low cal./low fat but seriously...what's the fun in that?  Cooked up perfectly...just make sure to let it sit for 30 minutes after taking out of fridge and before putting in a piping hot oven.

This took waaaaay longer than was stated to cook, nearly twice as long.  I'm likely to use this recipe as a base for basic egg bakes, but I would pat the sausage dry before cooking in the casserole in order to keep it from getting so greasy.  Adding in some fresh spinach was quite delicious.  This makes for an easy breakfast if prepare the night before--and if you have lots of time to wait for it to cook.

Excellent recipe for leftovers! I have made this for a very long time and my recipe is just how this is written. I cut our servings in half (4 serv in 8x8) and still have another breakfast for me and the husband. I have made it with cheddar cheese, but really prefer shredded swiss. Gives it a nice flavor. Thanks for sharing!

We really liked this recipe especially with the pork sausage. It gives it great flavor. I added a few things: sun dried tomato & basil seasoning to add taste and scallions & roasted red pepper slices for some veggie component. You could substitute many different veggies based on what you have on hand. I just thought it needed a nutritional kick. I also used focaccia bread that was going stale instead of the white bread. This will be a go to for me when I'm looking for a brunch or even dinner recipe. Thanks!

Made this recipe for church and it was gobbled up.  The kids kept coming back for more.  And a 9 yr. old girl asked her mom to get the recipe.  So, this will definately be made again.

This was pretty good.  Nothing fantastic and I probably won't make it again.  But I used 1lb of precooked breakfast sausage links from Costco.  I thawed them and then sauteed them with some green pepper & onion before mixing with the other ingredients.  I didn't use ground mustard, I used some maple syrup instead (from another reviewer --great tip!).  I toasted the bread before dicing it up.  And I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on them.  Then diced them.  My sister is not a huge fan of eggs but liked this dish because she said it didn't really taste like eggs.

We just had this for Christmas breakfast and like the presents, it was devoured in no time flat! This is my favorite egg/sausage casserole because it is less greasy than others. We use hot bulk pork sausage and pat it dry on paper towels to get rid of as much grease as possible, and just tear the bread into the egg mixture. It makes the perfect accompaniment to "clone of a Cinnabon".

We all love this.  I can make it ahead and it turns out perfect every time, even if I adjust the ingredients to whatever I have on hand.  We always use turkey sausage, noone knows the difference!

This was good.  I will add onion, bellpeppers and bacon (leaving the salt out) next time.  I may even add mushrooms.  This is a wonderful recipe that can be easily tweaked to add other ingredients that you like!  It's also very EASY.

This is a great recipe for feeding a lot of people.  I did a brunch this past weekend with some very hungry eaters. It fed everyone and was all gone.  I used regular cased breakfast sausages and just cut them up. Worked just as well as loose sausage.  I would definitely recommend this for any potluck or group breakfast .

OK, this was absolutely fabulous. Such a versatile recipe... you can choose your own ingredients or what you had on hand. I had bacon and mexican blend cheese, and italian bread leftover from dinner. I also used a 9x13; didn't have the size specified. Cooked beautifully after 35-40 mins. I only let sit 2 hrs because I was short on time... absolutely will make this again. Also I used garlic instead of mustard powder and added fried potatoes and onions to the mixture! DELISH!!

This is a delicious and easy breakfast casserole.  I followed the recipe as is and my family loved it! However, I too found it was not necessary to refrigerate overnight (as another reviewer stated). My 8 year old requested this for Christmas breakfast and my mother-in-law wanted the recipe (so you know it HAS to be good LOL).

I have been searching for a breakfast casserole recipe and stumbled upon the best with this one.  After reading the reviews, I added 2 more eggs and 1/2 cup more milk.  I also added sliced jalapenos to give it a kick.  It was wonderful and a big hit with my Memorial Day company.

There are so many breakfast casserole recipes available, I chose this based on the limited ingredients, ease and quickness of assembly and ability to make day prior.  It was delicious.  Essentially a light version of a sausage and egg sandwich, though you can barely tell there's bread in it which I liked.  Next time I will try adding spices for a southwest twist but had guests who do not like spice this time around.

Quick, easy, yummy and few ingredients which is always appreciated.

I've used different types of sausage in this recipe and each has turned out fantastic. Regular sausage is great, hot sausage adds a little kick, maple sausage gives it a little sweeter character but my favorite has to be chorizo- delicious!!

This was perfect!  I subbed a quart of fat free half-n-half for the milk and just placed the 6 slices of bread, whole, in the bottom of the dish.  I didn't measure the cheese and put in a little leftover monterey jack that I wanted to get rid of.  My guests on Christmas morning devoured it!  One last thing, I did have to cook it closer to an hour, but that could just be my oven.  Mmm!

Great recipe!  I served this for a New Year's Day breakfast.  My adult children were disappointed when they heard my menu because they said the egg casseroles are always soggy...but not this one and they loved it!  It turned out great.  I did use 2 extra eggs and I also cooked it about 50 minutes.  Enjoyed!

It turned out great! I'd probably leave it in my oven a little longer because it seemed a little wet still in the middle but at our church potluck, it all got eaten and was the ONLY casserole there to have no leftovers!

I took these to work for a birthday breakfast and everyone loved them, but me being a critic I thought they were too watery, most likely b/c I added an extra 2 eggs and 1/4 cup milk to fill the 9x13 pan.  Another 10 minutes of cook time would have been much better.    Great with Red Hot and a few chunks of potato inside!

I added 7 large eggs, 7 slices whole wheat bread, added some minced dried onion in with my sausage while it browned, and topped with more cheese and some jalepenos.  Next time I will topped with thinly sliced tomatoes near the end of cooking.  Very good.

I have made this twice.  Good base to start from.  I have made it plain and have added vegetables too.  I prefer to use a spicy sausage because otherwise I find it too bland.. I don't typically like egg bake and soggy bread and somehow this one does it for me.

This is such a great recipe.  When I have made it, I cube the bread and after browning the sausage, lay the two in the bottom of the casserole dish.  Then I pour the liquid mixture over top.  It is easier to pour into the dish without the bread and sausage.  It smells so good while baking my stomach growls.

I have made many Sausage/Egg Casseroles and this one was by far the best.  I made this in an 8 x 8 square Pyrex dish and topped with cream of mushroom soup. The others are right, it does take longer to cook--nearly an hour--but the result was amazing.  I cooked this for our Christmas morning brunch and it received rave reviews.  Look no further for a breakfast casserole...this is the one.

We really enjoyed this for dinner tonight.  I used hot Italian turkey sausage links, casings removed, 5 eggs, 1 1/2 c. milk, 4 slices bread cubed, a scant 1/2 tsp. mustard and 3/4 c. shredded cheddar.  Refrigerated for only 4 hours before baking.  Baby broccoli florets, sauteed chopped sweet bell pepper and onions and/or asparagus tips would all be great additions to this recipe.  Thanks for a keeper, love it!

I love this recipe for both the taste and the simplicity of it! It has been my go-to breakfast casserole for the past several years. I, too, add a couple extra eggs and bread to help it fill out a 9x13" pan. I also suggest cutting the salt measurement by half as the sausage provides plenty of sodium.

I just made this dish this past weekend. Me and the kids thought it was ok, but my hubby went back for seconds.  I read some of the reviews and tweaked my recipe just a little.  I did use 8 eggs as some suggested along with 2 1/4 cups milk, salt and pepper for taste, an 8 oz bag of mild cheddar cheese (will use 16 oz next time so it can be very cheesy), and I used turkey sausage (the taste was excellent).  I had to bake it for about 1 hour plus (baked it too long because the edges and bottow were a little too brown for me).  I also baked the french toast casserole in which my niece and hubby loved (next time will use less bread...could not measure the 5 cups of bread right).  Will try both receipes again around the holidays before we get our grub on for the main dishes.

This is a dish my family has for breakfast every Christmas morning when I was a kid! This Christmas I was away from my parents being they moved 18 hours in one direction and I moved 3 days in the opposite direction. My mother in law ate 3 servings which is rare for anything. Thank you for having this recipe posted! I was able to have one family tradition still going!

This is a great recipe.  It's always a hit!  I had a bunch of leftover Easter Ham in my freezer and I used that instead of the sausage, it was delicious!  My dad mentioned that with the ham it would be even better with onions and peppers, I'll try that next time!

maybe because I used brown bread instead of white it wasn't right. I found the taste of soggy bread overwhelming.I wont be making this again.

This was a really easy, good caserole.  The only suggestion I would make is to drain the sausage before mixing it all together, as it did seem a little greasy after baking.  Will definitely make it again.

Great dish! I made this Christmas morning to bring to my Mom's for brunch. I added about 5 more eggs, green onion and sweet peppers. Very easy recipe and baked up quickly which was what I needed. I looked pretty and very festive with the colors of the vegetables.

This a great basic recipe.  I actually made it with veg. sausage since my brother is a vegetarian.  It was still great and he loved it!  We added some onion, green pepper, 2 xtra eggs.  I think it needed all those things.  We also used leftover italian bread for the bread.  Very easy to make!

I also added two more eggs and 1/4 cup extra milk to fill a 9x13 pan, worked great. I may add a smidge less salt next time as I tend to like things a little less salty. I baked this for a church potluck, and I think it's perfect because it will appeal to young and old alike. It's very tasty!

I followed the basic recipe with a couple health modifications --- 100% whole wheat bread, soy cheese, skim milk, Egg Beaters.  (Drained and rinsed the sausage to eliminate as much fat as possible.)  No one was the wiser and everyone enjoyed the dish.  Like another reviewer, I added a couple extra eggs, some milk and a few more pieces of bread because I wanted to fill up a 9 x 13 pan.  This recipe will be repeated because it's EASY.  Thanks!

We loved this!  I added a SMALL dash of nutmeg and sage, and used turkey sausage and wheat bread.  After pouring it into the pan I added another small layer of cheese, a layer of pre-shredded hashbrowns, and then another small layer of cheese.  Next time I'll try it with some mushrooms too. YUMMY!

I substituted chicken sausage for pork sausage, and it turned out so tasty! I used the site to increase the servings to 10 instead of 8, and it worked perfectly. I did find that I had to keep it in the oven for 20 minutes longer than the recipe calls for, but it turned out very yummy. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seemed a tad too salty (maybe a combo of the added salt and the salt in the sausage), so next time I'll decrease the amount of added salt.

Good basic recipe!  I substituted bacon--but only 1/2 pound and reduced the milk to 1 and 1/2 cup.  Also used a spice mix we like in place of the mustard. Instead of the 7 by 11 pan I used an 8 by 8 inch pan. Made it for breakfast for guests and  they asked for the recipe.

This casserole turned out perfect!  I made it for my boyfriend and I and we both thorougly enjoyed it.  Upon reading the other reviews, I added 1 more egg, more cheese (I used a mix of Montery Jack and Chedder) and I added onion.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  It cooked in 40 minutes for me.  The egg/bread mixture was incredibly light and fluffy.  I barely added any salt and pepper to recipe, my boyfriend liked it that way, I still added a touch more salt to my slices.

Since it was just the 2 of us, we did have leftovers which were great even the next day.  We heated them up in microwave which was fine, but we both said that would probably be better warming in oven again, was almost too moist in microwave.

I will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious!  I made this for a dinner. I made the sausage the night before, and added it to the egg mixture in the morning.  It took a few extra minutes to cook, but it was perfect and gone fast!  It wasnt greasy like most sausage casseroles.  Because it doesnt rely on the grease to make the dish, I am going to try with veggie sausage next time to make it a bit healthier!

My mom and I have made this casserole for 20 years but I have a way to make it even better. In the morning, combine one can cream of mushroom soup with 1/4 cup dry white wine, and spread over casserole. Bake as directed. DELICIOUS! We know this as "Eggs Portugal" and make it every year for Christmas breakfast.

This was just great!! Everyone loved it! I did not realize till the day I was to make this that it had to chill at least for 8 hours. I cooked it anyway without chilling and it was delicious and came out wonderful! Just a couple of things I added for preference was onions to the skillet while browning the sausage. I added 3 slices of American cheese along with the cheddar, and a pinch of garlic powder to the recipe. Everyone needs to try Gayle's recipe....we Loved it!!! Next time I am going to try it with bacon or ham!

My husband liked it so much he called up his mom who is an excellent cook and told her about it!! My teenage boys and daughter also loved it.  My husband said he can't wait for me to make this again!!!

I made this tonight after reading all the reviews. I switched a few things up, I didn't use dry mustard, I used 8 eggs and salt, pepper, and seasoning salt. It took about 40 mins. in my oven, but it came out tasting great! My fiancee normally doesn't eat eggs that are whisked with milk, but he loved this! It's a keeper, I think I'll add mushrooms next time, maybe some salsa.

I made this for our Christmas morning breakfast, and it was to die for!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I used Bob Evans Original Sausage.  I imagine you can add mushrooms, onions, peppers, or anything else you like, but it was delicious just the way it was!  This would be a great meal, not only for breakfast, but for dinner or supper too...with maybe some hashbrowns or fried potatoes on the side.  Yummy!  There is no doubt, I will make this again and again!  Thank you!!!

Yum-O.  Liked by everyone in the house (even picky kids whom usually don't like eggs).  Small substitutions made....8 eggs instead of 6 so that I could bake it in a 9x13 pan, and no white bread in the house, so I cooked up 6 grands biscuits, and used them in place.  DE-LISH!

I actually use cubed english muffins and turkey sausage when preparing this.  I also put everything in the dish and refrigerate overnight.  The bread soaks up the egg mixture and bakes up nice a fluffly the next morning, and it makes the morning preparation and clean up go a lot quicker.  This recipe is delicious and one of our family's favorites.  Thanks!

This is my favorite not just for breakfast/brunch, but my family likes it for dinner as well. I add a cup of sharp cheese in addition to the cheddar. Gives it a little more flavor. I have also tried it with some sauteed onion. This is a superb recipe.

I love this recipe. When I make it I use an Italian loaf bread that I cut into cubes. I grease a 9x13 pan and put cubed bread on on bottom of pan ( generally it takes about 3/4 of the loaf). Next I put the sausage (which I cooked with onion) on top of the bread followed by the cheese. Since the bread I am using is much bulkier I usually use at least 10 eggs and more milk. I pour this over the layered casserole slowly until it soaks all the way through. If you think you need more egg and liquid you can add more. I put it in the fridge overnight and voila its a wonderful strata that everyone enjoys! Happy brunching y'all!

Great recipe! I used maple-flavored sausage and sauteed chopped onion in a tablespoon of melted butter and added to casserole.  It tasted wonderful.  I prepped this in the morning and made it for dinner.  I needed to add 10 minutes to the cook time in order for it to really firm up but I will definitely make this again.  Might add some chopped bacon since hubby LOVES it.

This is pretty much EXACTLY the go-to breakfast casserole I have made to for years!  I, personally, am not a fan of the ones that have potatoes in them.  The only difference with mine is we use ham, only because my daughter likes ham better than sausage.  And my recipe also calls for a can of mushrooms which we do use as we like mushrooms; and "dried" bread.  I usually just lay the bread out the afternoon before I put it together that evening.  I suppose that is to maybe soak up the liquids better?  Anyway, this is a good basic egg casserole you can "tweak" to your tastes if necessary.  I found my original recipe in a church cookbook--no better place to find good, tried, & true recipes in my opinion!!

The whole family loved this casserole!  It wasn't as heavy as some other egg casseroles we have tried.  I did add 2 more eggs and 2 more pieces of bread so that I could fill up a 9x13 pan.  The only request my husband made was:  More Cheese!  Of course, he thinks there can never be enough cheese in anything.  Thanks for a great recipe...we will use this one again.

Forget the mustard and add Frank's hot sauce. It does not leave your tongue burning.Start off using 1/2 teaspoon and a little additional pepper.

Great basic recipe!  Great as is, and it can be easily modified.  I've made it serval times and modified it to what I had on hand.  I've substituted the bread with lining the bottom of the dish with canned cresent roll dough.  I've also substituted the bread for shredded potatoes.  Both worked very well.  Thanks for sharing!

Never made a strata before. I was leery about mixing it all up the night before, thinking the bread would get soggy. After baking, it was perfect. Could have used a little less bread though.

I have made this a bunch and it is always delicious. People always ask for the recipe. I usually use half bacon and half sausage. I also add a few more eggs.

I used leftover homemade dinner rolls instead of bread. That worked. I froze the leftovers for a month then thawed in the fridge then microwaved it. It tasted as good as it did when it came out of the oven a month ago. I don't have to wait until I get a crowd, to make it anymore.

This recipe is fantastic!  We had this for dinner the other night and loved it.  Even my 4 year old, who is leery about new dishes, cleaned his plate and was happy to have it the following day for leftovers!    As for following the recipe.  I was only able to refrigerate this for about 20 minutes and I used whole wheat bread, because that's what we eat.

i don't usually rate recipes because I invariably change them.  This time I followed it to the letter because so many people raved about it.  It was okay and it did sllice well, but I should have follwed my instincts and added more cheese..probably another 4 to 8 ounces.  Also, I would probably leave out most of the salt......and coming from me, an admitted salt craver, that is a huge statement.  The cheese has a lot of salt, so I think that most people would want to add salt sparingly.

This is a great and simple dish. I made in on Christmas morning with some extra Italian bread that we had leftover from the day before. The kids loved it, and so did the husband. It has become a regular recipe. It's fun to try this recipe as a base with different ingredients and additions for variety. I tried this dish with maple sausage and added some tomatoes on top and it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

OK, I tried it and thought it was really good. I used precooked sausage links (it was all I had) and added some onion with cubed ham.  The pre cooked sausage was really strong. I do plan to make this again with your recipe without adding anything.

I used an 8oz block of cheese and added one one red and one green bell pepper chopped. I also used hot sausage but it wasn't hot at all when eating, not even for the kids.  Very good and pretty with the red and green peppers for Christmas.

When I made this it was very watery - probably because I used light bread (it's really airy, not as dense)... so it didn't absorb the milk.  
Next time I'll just use less milk with the light bread and it'll be better I'm sure.

Even with it a little too liquidy, we all really liked it around here.

I made it for Christmas morning.
It's a good recipe for holiday mornings since you make it the night before!

This was wonderful.  I did, however, make a couple adjustments after reading the reviews.  I cut back on the amount of sausage as I felt the full pound was going to be too much and I was happy I did cut back.  I added two more eggs and an additional 1/2 milk.  I ended up baking it for an hour.  It was not done at 30 minutes.  After reading the reviews, I felt it was better to adjust my time and not assume the 30 minutes would bake the casserole.  I thought I could always keep it warm if it got done sooner and my guests had not arrived.  The hour was perfect and everyone loved it.  I might fool around with onions and peppers next time, but this time I just went with what was suggested with the two minor additions and thought it was just great - it was the perfect accompaniment to the baked French toast casserole I also served.  I will keep this recipe handy for future breakfast parties and definitely for Christmas morning.

I made a few changes based on reviews and what I had on hand.  I used 8 eggs and 9 slices of very thin sandwich bread.  I didn't have sausage so I added a pkg of diced ham (I think it was 16 oz).    I made this the night before and baked the next morning.  My guests all loved this.  I will definitely make again!

This was the perfect Christmas morning breakfast. Instead of white bread, I cubed canned biscuit dough, baked it about 10 minutes alone, and then mixed the rest of the ingredients per the instructions. I also used "savory sage" flavored sausage and added a bit of chopped onion and green bell peppers. This made for a very flavorful and filling dish that disappeared fast!

I made this for dinner but i added ham and some leftover pork from dinner last night.  I thought it was good but I think the sausage is the way to go.  It was a bit bland with my meats....I will def try this again with the sausage and adding finely chopped peppers and onions like suggested in other reviews.

This has been a go-to recipe for me since I found it years ago! I've tried different recipes but it's our favorite and absolutely delicious!!  I stick to the recipe, but sometimes throw in 6 more eggs if we are feeding a few more - doesn't really change anything!  I love to throw some veggies in too - green peppers, onions, tomatoes... LOVE this recipe!  I usually bake for an hour so it's not mushy.  (Note: I've also made this the same morning and threw it in the oven right away - just as yummy!)

I used this recipe for the first time today, for a church mom's group meeting.  I doubled the recipe and made two 9X13 casseroles.  It was so easy to prepare, and took the stress out of the morning!  I did take some recommendations and added sauteed onions(1/3C) and mushrooms (1 small container chopped and split between the 2 casseroles)  and oodles more of cheese.  I also cooked it for an hour and it did well.  My husband and son loved the leftovers.  Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

We always had this on Christmas morning when I was growing up.  Now we make it for our own families (w/o the mustard) and it's a huge favorite!

This was good.  I made two, one with ham and the other hot sausage.  I added white pepper.  I did saute the ham chunks before adding to cook the water out.  It would have been soggy if not.  Some people said it was bland, but what do you expect from eggs, bread and cheese?  Thanks for the great recipe.  This will be my "no potatoes" recipe from now on.

I love this recipe. Would anyone or has anyone ever tried making it without the bread? I am making it for a breakfast and am already have french toast. Was wondering if it would still be good without the bread.

This was my first married Christmas.  I made this for my family's brunch.  Instead of bread I used english muffins.  I used a 9x13 pan so I used 9 eggs and 2 cups of milk.  My husband says this is a keeper!

I actually made this the night before Christmas Eve - it sat in the fridge till I baked it Christmas morning, but it turned out fine. Almost all was eaten between 5 people. I used hot sausage and will definately not change that, but  next time I think I'll add fresh mushrooms or green pepper and onions.

Make this at least twice during the holidays.  Super fast and delicious!  I especially love that I can make it the night before, pull it out of the fridge the next morning and it can be cooking a half an hour later.

I have never heard of this Sausage and Egg Casserole before.  I made it and everyone loved it.  I was chose to be the food provider for a group of 15 campers and I brought this.  I had two 9x13 in. pans that I had covered in a cooler until breakfast, then we cooked it on the grill.  Everyone loved it and we ran out.  Next time I'm bringin' 3 pans.

I've tried many versions of this casserole over the years on Christmas morning for our big family.  This is the best recipe I've tried.  Good balance... I added two more eggs and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of regular milk. I also added a little cayenne pepper for an extra zip.  It was really good.

The taste was really good with this recipe but it was soggy. We figure it would have been better if we left it in longer. It was in the oven for an hour and 15 minutes at 350 degrees but we had two in the oven.  Very good recipe!

I thought this recipe was alright, but my kids all RAVED about it, so it gets 5 stars.  We made it with gimme lean vegetarian sausage and rice milk, due to dietary neccesities. We put it together in the am before school and ate if for dinner.  I made a double batch and there were no leftovers. We will definitely make it again.

This was excellent...very tasty indeed!  I used hot Italian sausage with the casings removed to add a bit of heat, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It did take a little longer to cook...probably closer to 50 mins.  A lovely start to my family's Xmas morning washed down with champagne and orange juice!

Cooking up the sausage with chopped onion and peppers works great and adds flavor.  Not everyone in my family goes for mushrooms so I can't put too many in.  Definitely take the advice of others and be generous with the cheese.

I liked it though my husband found the bread to be too much.  I made Breakfast Sausage from this site for the bulk sausage.  It didn't quite cook through though despite cooking for at least an hour.  We were hungry so just microwaved it for the last little bit.  Will cook a bit higher next time and/or longer

This was a big hit on Christmas morning!  My family raved over this recipe.  I put this together around 1am after all our guests had left on Christmas eve and it was so simple to put together.  I ended up using a mix of 1% milk and heavy cream because that was all I had in the house.  Came out delicious.  I did have to cook it about 15 minutes more than the recommended time.  This one's definitely a keeper!

For such a simple recipe, this dish was delicious! To save time, I used pre-cooked breakfast sausage links and sliced them into 1/2 round pieces. I made the dish the night before serving and had to add about 10 minutes to the cook time. Received many compliments!

This is an awesome option to any meal. We tweaked it a bit with 8 eggs, 1/2 cup more milk, less bread, but added diced ham. Cooked for an hour and stired half way through cooking so its a little fluffy. Babies, kids and adults all love this. It's whats for dinner tonight, not just for holidays!
