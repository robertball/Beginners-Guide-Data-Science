This was great.  I followed the recipe exactly and am glad I did.  My husband said it tasted like something he had in a restaurant only better.  Even my kids who do not eat peppers and onions if they know they are there ate them.  My 10 year old commented that they did not taste like peppers.  We had it over pasta with a salad.  I can’t wait to try it again this summer with peppers and onions fresh from our garden!!!

I used this as a sandwich filling and found it great.  Just prepare as stated, then pile it on a loaf of french bread cut in half lengthwise, pile on the cheese and slip under the broiler for a few minutes.  Guys love it for great half-time lunch!

I made this for my family about a week ago and they are still talking about it!!! I followed the recipe exactly and it was just perfect. One thing I did do was use more sausage and did half mild and half hot- amazing!!!!!

AMYM20, this is a fabulous recipe. 
When I served this dish for dinner, it was over penne. I did not drain the tomatoes, and I added marsala wine to bring out the flavor of the sausage and the sweetness of the peppers. I also expanded on the recipe, adding a zucchini, mushrooms and a summer squash. The next day, I added the mozzarella chese and served on toasted garlic subs. Absolutely delicious both times! Daddy sure taught you well, and thanks for the post.

Note, There is no mention of adding pasta to this recipe. We who cook all the time know how much and when to do so, but young new cooks need to know this stuff.

My family is really reluctant to try new things.....But I did this and they loved it! I added one more can of tomatoes and served it over rice. It was a BIG hit!

This was delicious!  I didn't have green peppers on hand, so I used more red and yellow.  It is very flexible that way.  Really recommend it

This was a definate 5 star dinner here.  I used a spicy turkey sausage.  I added the onions with the peppers and used 2 small zucchini too.   I would have added mushrooms too but mother in law is allergic.  I used an extra can of tomatoes, sauce and all and about 3/4 c of Marsala wine (thanks Tay!)  After it cooked I added some whole wheat penne pasta.  This was fantastic.  I served it with a tossed salad and Roasted Garlic bread.  SO good....I can't wait to make it again!!

Where is the mention of PASTA in this recipe? My husband and I did like this. We tried it with Pasta and without. With pasta;I thought it was average, MY HUSBAND LIKED IT A LOT! My husband likes sausage and peppers more than I do though. My husband suggested cutting the ITALIAN SEASONING BY HALF! He also used mild sausage but will try it with Spicy/HOT sausage next time. WE ALSO MADE THIS AND ATE IT ON ROLLS, WITHOUT PASTA, as a sandwich and it was pretty decent. My husband will make this again. It's a great starter recipe. ~Thanks

I am not quick to hand out 5 star reviews on this site.... but this one is deserving. This recipe is delicious... and very versatile. You can do many things with this one recipe.... as it stands alone, over pasta, on pizza, in  calzone, as a sandwich... it's simple and delicious. I worked in an italian restaurant for a LONG time, this is a restaurant quality meal. My husband and I both loved it. Thank so much.

Not bad, but much improved omitting the Italian seasoning and the mozzarella.

This was a nice change of pace.  We are not real big fans of sausage & peppers, but I had a package of mild italian sausage on hand & decided to try this after reading the reviews.  I cut back considerably on the peppers: I only used 2 green bell & 1 red bell pepper(cut in bite size pieces), also added 1/2 C. of Marsala wine for flavor. I mixed with egg noodles after simmering and it was overall for my family  very good with less pepper. (I think it would have been too overpowering with six peppers)

This was mahvelous!!! I cut the recipe in half & used mild italian sausage becasue that's what I had. I infused a cup of olive oil (I made extra) w/ about 8 cloves of sliced garlic ...removing the garlic when it just started to turn brown. I doubled up on the canned tomatoes (I used organic)& I deglazed the pan after cooking the sausage w/ 1/2 cup of marsala. I added extra parmesan reggiano & at that time, I added about a tbp. of Wondra (it's an instant flour used to thicken sauces) to thicken the sauce up a bit. I also added about a tbp. of fresh chopped basil when I added the mozzarella then served this over penne pasta. We started the evening off w/ a Rossini as an aperitif, then had a sm. bowl of Roasted Garlic Soup with Thyme Croutons as an appetizer, then ate ourselves into a stupor w/ this recipe & a glass of chianti & never made it to dessert.  Thanks AMYM20...your Daddy done good w/ this one!

Amy, you've got a really great recipe here that my family loved! At first, I kept my links whole and cooked them in the oven so I wouldn't have to babysit. While they were working, I sauteed the tri-colored peppers and proceeded from there. Added more seasonings including a few red pepper flakes, used a large can of diced tomatoes and added several spashes of marsala wine. (Thanks Tay) My gang was not expecting to see all the gooey, wonderful melted cheese on top. Nice touch! Served this on Italian Sub rolls. Thanks so much!

Yum! My only complaint might be that fortunately I was only feeding three people, because one can of diced tomatoes would never have been enough liquid for the recipe if I was really making for 6.  I added a little crushed red pepper and a little less garlic, but a bit more olive oil.  Definitely a "keeper".

Hubby loved this recipe! Like some other reviewers, I added an extra can of tomatos and diced up a zucchini to throw in. I also cut down on the garlic due to personal taste and added some red pepper flakes for additional spice.

I made this for a pot luck at work and it was gone in just a few minutes. A definite repeat!

This recipe was easy and delicious!  I served it over penne pasta and it was a huge hit!  Only thing I did different is I used garlic sausage and added a little hot sauce to spice it up.  I'll definitely make this again and again!

Delicious!  Have eaten it over egg noddles and also as a sandwich and both are tasty.  Add some white wine to mix it up a little.  Thanks!

Not used to having this kind of dish at ALL, so please forgive me AMYM20 if I’ve done unthinkable things to "Daddy's" dish! First of all, used 1/2 hot sausage & 1/2 mild. Doubled quantity of diced tomatoes, using flavorful fire-roasted diced tomatoes. Did not appear to be a great deal of “gravy” w/this dish, so reserved liquid from diced tomatoes to add in later if desired, & that is what I ended up doing, thickening it (toward the end) w/about 2tsp cornstarch.  Also, early on & in a separate pot, simmered tomatoes in Italian seasoning, w/garlic & onions, to more deeply infuse those flavors; added about 1/3c marsala wine to this mixture (great!). Only used 1/2 each of green, red, & yellow bell peppers.  Quadrupled amount of parmesan, using parmesan reggiano (divine!) & doubled the mozzarella.  Toward the end, so it would not be overcooked & would still have a bit of crunch to it, added zucchini chunks.  Chose penne pasta to serve it over & really liked that a lot.  Had more reggiano on hand to sprinkle on top of each plate & accompanied w/hot crusty bread & a cabernet sauvignon. Husband was in heaven which was nice because today is our wedding anniversary, so a gift to him!  And while I am not a big fan of sausage or of green peppers, I too thought this dish had VERY good flavor.  Was glad to have the gravy to “sauce” the pasta.  Bottom line:  I'll eat the pasta, sauce & veggies, & my husband will gladly eat all of the sausage!  Good partnership! :-)

Surprisingly good. I didn't have any garlic-flavored olive oil, so I added extra garlic cloves to make up for it. I used Italian sweet sausage and peppers from my garden. I was skeptical at first, but after 45 minutes of cooking, the flavors started to really come together. My husband loved this. Like some others, I also doubled the tomatoes. The other change I made was to cook everything at a slightly higher heat than called for because I love sweet vegetables to be just a bit scorched.

FANTASTIC! My husband, neighbor and I LOOOOVED this!!! To be fair, I did make a couple of changes. Without them, I think we would have liked this much less. Simmering peppers for a half hour seemed far too long to me (I don't care for mushy peppers), so I combined two steps into one and simmered for only HALF the suggested time . I simply browned my cut (spicy) sausage, then added my peppers, tomatoes, onion, garlic and Italian seasoning. I tossed everything with my garlic infused olive oil, then topped with grated Parm, covered and simmered as directed. My peppers were slightly softened and oh so yummy!!! For a casual twist, I served this sandwich-style on toasted hoagie rolls (I brushed my rolls with a garlic butter mixture first). I topped each sandwiche with a bit of warmed pizza sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese and then popped under the broiler for a couple of minutes to melt the cheese. Mmmmmm.... Thanks SO very much for sharing your daddy's recipe, Amy! Other than omitting the tomatoes next time (I don't feel they belong here), I'll change NOTHING!!! This is absolutely perfect as is! :-)

My family loves this so much that it is now in my regular rotation of recipes.  The only change I make is to use a low-fat chicken sausage, which I remove from the pan once it is browned and replace when I put in the mozzarella cheese.  Oh, and don't make the mistake I once made of using more than 1 can of diced tomatoes.  It changed the consistency of the dish (too soupy) and it wasn't as good.  Even my non-vegi eating kids love this!  Try it!

Wonderful recipe! I cooked my peppers and onions  for a while with my sausage because I don't like my veggies too crunchy. I also used hot sausage because it was what I had on hand. Stirred hot pasta in with the mozzarella. So much flavor and we all loved it. I will cook this dish again.

This was very good and the leftovers will even be better!  I used 4 hot sausage links (that's what I had on hand) and cooked the onions & garlic with the peppers.  I didn't have Parm and mozz cheese on hand so I diced up 3 mozz cheese sticks.  Once it was done I mixed it in one large pot with a box of penne and threw the cheese on top.  Will make again!

This is AMAZING! I added more sausage but reduced the amount of peppers just because that is what I had. I used hot sausage but next time I would use sweet/mild and green bell peppers. I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with the oregano and italian seasonings in it and I am glad I did. It wouldn't have had enough tomatoes in my opinion with only 1 can. I served this over spaghetti...next time I will have italian bread on the side to soak up the juices. Will make this again and again!

I made this a little differently as I needed to use some ingredients that I had on hand.  My first step was to brown a package of Little Sizzler's sausage and cut them in thirds.  Next I sauteed red & green bell peppers, two medium yellow squash, and added garlic powder, onion powder, and the Italian seasonings.  Then I poured in a can of crushed tomatoes and let that all simmer for almost an hour.  Served it over thin spaghetti with garlic/parmesan bread.   It smelled great while simmering and made a very yummy meal.  For sure a keeper.

We loved this dish! I halved the recipe, added extra mozzarella and a little bit of chicken stock (it was all I had!) to make it "saucier". Served it with Spaghetti and it was a hit! The only comment my husband made was that it had great flavor but it was a bit too "vegetarian" for his taste. He's really not used to all the vegies!!! But I loved that. Next time, I'll add a few more sausages for him and serve most of the vegetables for myself!

We really enjoyed this. I didn’t have fresh peppers so I used frozen, added some onion, jarred garlic since I was in a hurry.  I browned sausage (kielbasa) that was all that I had.  I added the frozen peppers & more onion, garlic, tomatoes & hot pepper flakes, Italian seasoning, some wine, salt & pepper.  My husband hates pasta, so I diced up some potatoes real small, then when they were done added the cheeses. It was awesome!

I followed the recipe just about exactly.  This dish is THE BOMB!  We LOVED it.  I've been making sausage and peppers for years, but adding these few ingredients makes a world of difference, especially the cheeses.  I'll never go back to the basics.

If you don’t know much about sausage and peppers, make this. You might like it. If you’ve eaten Italian sausage and peppers the right way, this recipe will disappoint you. Adding cheese?!! Garlic infused olive oil?!! Some like tomatoes in this recipe, others don’t. This recipe should be simple. Sausage, peppers, onions, garlic, Italian herbs, and maybe a little white or red wine.

It didn’t turn out too bad. Instead of using Italian sausage, I used spicy sausage. Also, I added pasta and marinara sauce. I could have definitely used more sausages.

This was a great recipe for a different way to make sausage and peppers.

I used venison Italian sausage and this recipe turned out AWESOME! It was easy and didn't take too long. We served it over penne pasta with garlic toast. Great dish!

I added some tomato paste and red wine to the mixture to enhance the flavoring.  I also used chicken sausage and it worked just as well

Daddy's Sausage & Peppers Haiku: "I wasn't a fan, but the 'Daddy' here loved this, we ate with penne." If this isn't served in a roll or over pasta, it's kind of just a chunky sauce, which isn't a bad thing, but on its own, I wasn't terribly fond of it; good, not incredible. I made it as written (only halved all of the ingredients, and used two extra garlic cloves to make up for not having "garlic flavored olive oil") and made some penne pasta to serve it over. My husband adored every bite, so from one Daddy to another, 5 stars.

I have made this recipe many times over the past few years, it's always wonderful!! I pretty much stick to the recipe, other than adding a second can of tomatoes. Sometimes I throw in mushrooms, or up the garlic. Sometimes I serve it over pasta and sometimes on nice toasty rolls. Whatever I feel like that day, this is a great recipe and I love that it came from your Daddy!! Thank you for sharing!

I used fresh tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, onions, peppers, zucchini and basil from my garden and made it with Chicken sausage (sundried tomato). I used less garlic and served with homemade pasta. When making it again, I'd add some red pepper flakes or use a spicier sausage for a little more kick and flavor. And possibly eliminate the mozzarella. Didn't really seem to need it!

Followed recipe to a T and it was relish! Made it for my Daddy (really did!) and he can be quite picky about food. He said he loved it and it was seasoned just right. I never get that level of praise from him! Thanks for sharing!

Removed the casings before browning and added the onions and garlic with the peppers. Then added two 14.5oz cans of italian diced tomatoes. Served over farfalle pasta and thought it was phenomenal! I make a variation of this all the time with turkey kielbasa so I wasn't expecting much, but I am definitely going to change it up from time to time.

Sooo delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. I made double portion so I could have it for dinner and the leftovers for lunch the next day. But I nearly finished it all that night!

This recipe is delicious! We substitute ground sausage and add a 2nd can of tomatoes and serve it with pasta as well. It is a welcomed change from a heavy tomato sauce :)
THanks for posting!

Spectacular flavor! We eliminated the pasta for a low-carb meal and ate this more as a stew.

I almost followed the recipe. I guess I never do. The changes I made I think made it a 5 star. I used turkey Italian sausage as my husband can not eat pork. I added another 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese and about 1 cup of grated asiago cheese, blended that with all the other ingredients mixed in precooked pasta shells then topped it with the mozzarella cheese. Love it, I will make it again.

It was wonderful. Because I am unable to eat cheese, I let everyone at the dinner table add cheese to theirs individually. I also added 1 teaspoon smoked paprika.

I made this last night and it was absolutely delicious! I was originally just going to make sausage and peppers until I found this recipe. I'm so glad I did. I didn't want it "soupy" since I was serving potatoes with it so I just drained it before serving and it was perfect. The flavors were incredible! Thanks for sharing!

On eof my favorite recipes of all time.  A few changes:  Since I use this as a thick and chunky pasta sauce, I double the Italian seasoning and double the diced tomatoes.  I also don't worry about the number or color of bell peppers.  Most of the time, I use all green bell peppers, and I cut the number of them down to three or four large peppers, depending on what I have on hand, and no harm is done.  This is so delicious!  Thanks!

I really liked this recipe! I modified it some by using extra virgin olive oil (so a lighter taste w/o the garlic) and w/o green peppers (we love red, orange and yellow)! Next time I would saute the onions first other than that every yummy!
