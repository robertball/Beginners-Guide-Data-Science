We really enjoyed this dish. I read other reviews before I started cooking and I made little changes to make more sauce. Marinade was made of 3Tbl spoons soy sauce, 2Tbl spoons water and 1Tbl spoon sugar. I drained chicken and saved marinade before I fried it in 2Tbl spoons of oil. I poured marinade back to fully cooked chicken just before I added spinach. I think any other sauce would ruin the unique flavor of this very good recipe.

This is easy to make and delicious!  My husband, who doesn't even like spinach, yummed this up too.  I loved it as-is.  My husband would have liked more of a sauce to pour over the rice.  He used a bottled Thai sauce as an immediate fix.  Would love anyone's suggestions of a great, easy sauce to make to pair with this!

Excellent! I doubled the recipe. Marinated the chicken while I prepped the veggies and basil.  Used my wok, perfect for stir-frying.  Cooking order: garlic, then chicken and marinade, then veggies.  Next, spinach, then basil, without removing from pan.

This was really yummy! I echo the review of another view who would have like to have more sauce, but I also served it over sticky rice and it was delectable! Love, love, love all the basil. I didn't have enough spinach on hand as the recipe called for, but it was fine the way it was.

I have actually made this recipe on several occasions and I see a fair number of people that said the chicken was a little bland; however, I have found a way to spice the chicken up a little. 

I bypassed the marinade all together and spiced the chicken with curry, pepper, and cooked the chicken in a Thai Curry paste, Soy Sauce, and sesame oil instead of olive oil.  

I used about a teaspoon of Thai Curry paste and unless one likes their chicken really spicy, that is all I would add.

I used only a tablespoon of sesame oil because if much more is used it will have an overpowering sesame flavor. 

Thirdly, I added a tablespoon of Soy Sauce. 

Heat the sesame oil, Soy sauce, and Thai curry paste in the pan before any chicken is added as to dilute the curry paste.

I didn't have spinach so I added celery, carrots, red pepper strips, snow peas and almond slices. I needed more sauce so added additional soy sauce blended with water and corn starch.  Once it was plated, I realized additional soy sauce was needed to enhance the flavor.  The fresh basil added great flavor and I will make it again with spinach next time.  Thanks for sharing.

While we enjoyed the spinach/basil combo, the chicken was bland & boring. We'll make this again, but use a different marinade for the chicken.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. It is phenomenal. the combination of marinated chicken, basil, spinach, soy sauce and lime is an amazing flavor combination. Will definitely make this again and will put this one in the regular rotation!

The fresh basil is a must.  My picky kid and I liked it, hubby said too bland.  I like that it's not a typical stir-fry flavor of soy/ginger.  I had a fridge full of veggies to use up so made this and instead of chicken I used sprouted tofu from Trader Joe's.  I just added whatever veggies I had - eggplant, red peppers, napa cabbage, mushrooms and then the fresh basil all served over rice.  I will definitely make again.

1 bag of spinach is enough, add veggies with the onion, mushrooms, red and yellow pepper, onion, double the sauce and add sirachia to it.  Served on rice...a blast

simple, easy, yummy. Easy to customize, but the basil was key! adds a lot of depth. tried to make it saucier by adding 1/4 c of chicken broth with corn starch, but didn't get the ratio right and it stayed runny. but the rice soaked it all up. if i made it again, i think i would just double or triple the marinade.

Not bad for a quick weeknight meal. Could use a bit more flavour so don't be afraid to doctor it up a bit.

It was good and it was healthy! Still, I found the taste appeal missing the mark, and after experimenting with different ideas, I found a little drizzle of balsamic glaze did the job.

I enjoyed the sauce but was very disappointed with the chicken.  It had no flavor; it tasted like it was boiled.  I won't try it again bit will remember the idea of adding basil to a stir fry.

Awesome!  Even "never eat spinach" super, picky eater loved it!  I knew my fam would want more sauce so I des ads about 3/4 cup chicken broth with about a table spoon of corn stach.  Will definitely make again!
