I made this exactly as the recipe is written and it was wonderful.  My step-daughter, who usually doesn't care for casseroles, really liked it, as did everyone at our table. I am adding this to my collected recipes as one I will make again and again!

I love this recipe, it is so easy. I did make changes: 1 used 2 - 15 oz cans whole kernel corn, draining 1 and using the liquid from the other; omitted the green chilies; added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper; and mixed only 1 cup of sour cream in the mixture then added the cheddar cheese on top before baking. Took it to our Christmas Potluck and it disappeared!

Easy and excellent side dish to compliment any meat main dish.  Best with chicken.

Yes, did not like the idea of pinmentos. Felt would be to mushy so changed to 1/2 cup of chopped red bell peppers. Perfect! Love this dish. Will be my "take to" from now on.

This was a hit at a family party.  I left out the green pepper because of a allergy and the pimiento pepper because we couldnâ€™t find it- still great
