Great base recipe.  There were two recipes that were fairly similar.  I love the tartness of ricotta cheese and added 1/2 cup to the recipe.  I also used Arborio rice which added a bit  more creaminess and depth to the recipe.  I saut√©ed  the leeks and garlic in  2 Tablespoons butter and 2 Tablespoons olive oil.  My kids and family LOVED it!

I was AMAZED at how well this turned out.  I lowered the leek, but added a 1/3 lb feta cheese to balance it out.  I also added a little bit of marinated artichoke hearts, chopped small, and was generous with the nutmeg and pepper.  Maybe these changes were the key, because otherwise I can't understand where the complaints of blandness come.  Super flavorful and one of the more tasty things I've found on this site.  Will definitely make again!

Liked the idea of the recipe, but it did not have much flavor - even though I doubled the  salt, pepper and nutmeg.  I kept cooking bitesize portions in the microwave to test the flavor.  Finally got the inspiration to add about a tablespoon of finely chopped sundried tomatoes.  Added the punch it needed.  Will see how my guests like it for Thanksgiving

Although healthy, I felt it was too dry.  I followed the exact directions.

I made this for an easy meatless dinner. Small alterations I made included doubling the garlic, adding artichokes and adding paprika. This dish is really easy and I think it would be good if u switch out the veggies with various other combinations like asparagus and mushrooms or zucchini and peppers. I also think this could be a good appetizer recipe if you use mini muffin pans to bake the rice cakes.

I'm not a big rice fan, so it was surprising to me how much i liked this. I added about a cup of daikon, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This is a tasty, satisfying dish! I'll bet a little ground sausage would make it a nice one-pot-meal.

Made this in the early afternoon as a side for roasted salmon I was preparing for dinner.  Excellent as written.  Delicious even at room temperature.

Saw this and couldn't wait to try.  I did not have nutmeg but other wise every thing was the same. Liked it but didn't love it. I think i would like to try it with artichoke hearts. Loved the tip about putting the parm on the bottom. Loved your video though, don't usually watch them
