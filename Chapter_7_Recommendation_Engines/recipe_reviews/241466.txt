I changed it up a bit. I seared the kielbasa in a skillet first. On high for about 7 minutes with sage, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Just a dash of each. Once the kielbasa was crispy I set it aside. I drizzled melted butter over the potatoes with a dash of salt and pepper after I pored them in the baking dish. I didn't use hard boiled eggs. I also made a meat free version for my vegetarian daughter. Came out great. Barely any leftovers.

I actually made a few changes according to what I had available. I layered frozen hash browns on the bottom, topped that with shredded cabbage, then topped that with the kielbasa, chopped onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper,  a little bit of cream and then covered it with shredded cheddar. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Quite tasty.

Ok as a base recipe. I added shredded cabbage (per someone else's suggestion) and used hash browns as the bottom layer because it's what we had on hand.
Husband liked it (specifically the sour cream and cheese combo), but I felt it was missing something. I think adding some green onion or sautéed red bell pepper would have been good.

My only suggestion is to add onions. If not it's still awesome without it. We used some of the leftovers to make omelets!! Yumm!!

Great recipe. I added extra cheddar cheese but that’s all. The dis was empty at the end of the meal and that’s all that  matters. Loved it

The only changes made were doubling the recipe (I live with piggies) and adding sweet onion and sautéed the sweet onion and sausage. Absolutely fantastic! Even my picky 4 year old loved it!

I used frozen southern style hash browns and it cut the preparation in half.  Really good for a weeknight meal.

I made few changes and additions: 1st I grilled the Kielbasa until the casing was dark, after baking, I put the dish in the broiler to slightly burn the cheese.  Then I garnished the dish with green onions.  Delish.

I made this just as the recipe said. I think it needed a little salt but otherwise thought it was very good.
