Awesome!  This turned out to be the best ever pasta dish I've made.  It was fantastic.  A perfect balance of flavors.  I made this for my husband for our anniversary, and it was a hit!  I did take the advice from some of the other helpful reviewers (thanks, guys!), and added a few changes of my own.  I did add crabmeat (NOT the imitation stuff, but the real lump crabmeat in a can at the refrigerated seafood counter), and I sauteed it in butter and lemon juice.  I used Land O'Lakes Fat Free half and half, and instead of 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning, I added a packet of dry Italian dressing mix, and I doubled the amount of sauteed garlic and didn't remove the pieces from the olive oil.  Instead of salt and pepper, I used garlic salt and lemon pepper.  I served it over warm fettuccini, then added more bleu cheese crumbles and lemon pepper to the top.  Outstanding!  I served it with a baguette, and it was a very filling and scrumptious meal.  Thanks for this recipe!  It will definitely be a hit at our family's special events!

Very good recipe. Here are the alterations that I've made. I used 1 tbsp butter, 3 cloves garlic that I left in, 1 tbsp fresh parsley instead of Italian seasoning, 1/4 c white wine and while the sauce was simmering, I added 1 tsp of flour to thicken it juast a bit. I served it on top of the pasta with additional parmesan cheese. Next time I will add some fresh mushrooms. Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe - I have made it a couple times and noticed different results in 'zing'; check which blue cheese you use - if you are using a creamy blue the sauce is relatively bland.

Also, I found broccoli to be delicious in this sauce (cut into very small trees)

Throw some canned crab meat (lump) in this and you have a truly awesome dish that will impress.

I LOVE bleu cheese, so I'd add more next time. We also fried up some chicken and added that on top. I would definitely recommend this. My husband and I loved it!

Wow!  What a yummy recipe.  I made this for my bf and a good friend (who specifically requested alfredo) and they loved it!  The garlic oil really adds a lot of flavor, and I belive, makes the dish.  I suppose you could use gorgonzola in place of bleu cheese if you prefer a milder flavor (gorgonzola is milder than bleu)....  This tastes just like Stouffer's fettuccini alfredo!  I think next time, I'll experiment by using green fettuccini!Serve with an Olive Garden salad (I made my own version) and garlic breadsticks (be sure to dip them in the sauce - yum!).  This one's a keeper!

I thought this was a fantastic recipe.  Its the first fettucini I've ever made, and it turned out great.  I did make a few changes as I went along, though, including sizing it down to 2 servings.  I left the garlic in, since I love garlic, and instead of Italian seasoning I used about a half dozen fresh basil leaves, chopped.  I used half and half instead of cream, and it worked fine, might even have been better.  And last!  After I tossed the sauce and pasta together, I cut up a ripe tomato and a couple green onions and stirred them in.  Really a wonderful dish, and one I'd serve to company.

If you have read any of my previous reviews, you have learned by now that we are HUGE blue cheese lovers.  So it should be no surprise that I gave it 5 stars.  I'm going to cut back on the Italian seasonings next time.  It was just a tad too much for our taste.  And I tend to agree with the other reviewers that adding cooked chicken, ham, or veggies to this would be delicious too.  Not for those watching their calories!

So good. My daughter does not like blue cheese at all and was very reluctant to try this but she ended up going back for seconds. I added broccoli and sauteed mushrooms which were a perfect match.

Best alfredo we've had! The blue cheese just makes it something special. I sauted a few chicken tenders with the garlic, and added them back in once the sauce had thickened.  I added sauted mushrooms as well.  Subbed a can of chicken broth and about a cup of milk for the cream to lighten the dish a little. Taste before adding too much salt as the cheeses will really impart a lot of flavor.  This is a new favorite!!

Needed a quick meal and this fit the bill as I had some leftover Blue Cheese Butter from the other night. Added heavy cream and it became the perfect Alfredo blue. Will make again.

This sauce was very good the only thing I changed was I put gorgonzola cheese instead of blue cheese next time I almost might put a little less italian seasoning and more parmesan we served it over pasta mixed with spinach and mushrooms and topped with steak fillets it was excellent!

Wonderful! Made it with Gorgonzola - very mild blue cheese taste to the sauce. I also left the garlic in the oil (in the sauce). Served it on pasta, broccoli, and ham. Everyone (9 of us, aged 4-40) ate it up.

Very good and easy.  The only thing I did different was to use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the heavy cream.  The family thought it was very good.

I thought the sauce was so yummy! I ended up getting seafood stuffed mozzerella tortellini and my friend said she could smell it out in the parking lot. Next time I won't use as much blue cheese it gave it more of a zestier flavor than I care for and I added some more garlic.

My actual rating is 3.5 stars. After all the reviews, I was expecting something a lot better than it was. Don't get me wrong, it was still sort of good, but just not what I expected. My boyfriend thought it was excellent though. Maybe it was the kind of cheese I used.

This recipie sounded so good and I love Blue cheese. My favorite restaurant served a pasta with a gorgazola cream sauce and was sooo yum. This may have been a mistake on my part but I purchased Danish Blue Cheese for this and it is a way strong blue. Wow..not so good..So just be careful what kind of blue you get.

This was good but a little too blue cheesy for my tastes.  I'll probably make it again but just add a sprinkle of blue cheese to the sauce for a little flavor instead of the over powering blue cheese flavor this sauce had.  I served it over artichoke raviolis from Trader Joe's.

Really good!  At first I was nervous because the sauce was a little watery, but it thickened up on its own.  Blue cheese taste wasn't overwhelming, and I liked the amount of seasoning called for.

This was delicious. I forgot to add the Italian seasoning, but I followed the directions otherwise. I served it with the Blackened Chicken recipe from this site by Karena.

I am a feign for blue cheese so I loved this dish! I added more blue cheese than requested for personal preference and it turned out great! I added flour to thicken the sauce otherwise, it would have been too runny. I also added steak to the dish and it complimented it well! :-)

It was quite nice but a couple of points to add. when it says 115g blue cheese, make sure you dont use too strong blue cheese like stilton, otherwise the sauce will be overpowering. I reccomend not melting the parmesan, and just sprinkling it on top the pasta when serving, with some chopped fresh parsley. It was nice though, i served it with penne, some parma ham and rocket. Any leftover sauce is great mixed in with mash.

This is a very delicious recipe! It really is something you could cook on a busy night. It was so simple and delicious. I didn't take the sliced garlic out because we love garlic. It has a nice mix of cream and bleu cheese.

I loved this so so so much!! My husband and I made this dish for company.  I used galic salt and lemon pepper with the italian seasoning. I also cooked up some chicken and sauted mushrooms and mixed it right into the sausce...it was amazing.  I served it with a garlic baguette and steamed broccoli. Will make again and again and again!!

I made this recipe as written, only adding sauteed shrimp and crab meat. The blue cheese (which I love) was way too overpowering. The recipe may be better adding only a third of the blue cheese.

This was not very good at all.  I'm a big blue cheese fan, so I was expecting great things.  I made it twice, following the directions exactly the first time.  It was extremely runny, wouldnt thicken up regardless of how long I let it set, and it basically tasted like melted blue cheese with too much italian seasoning mixed in.  The second time I used less cream, switched to gorgonzola cheese, used half the italian seasoning and added some oregano and 2 more cloves of garlic.  It was a little better, but definitely not worth making again.

I am sorry - This was terrible in my opinion.  My whole family did not finish it = and I ended up apologizing and we made sandwiched instead and threw the whole thing out.

Not for me!  Sorry - maybe it is an aquired taste.  I am also a blue cheese lover - so who knows!

I made this for 8 (including myself) college students and it went off great. Not a lot of people enjoy Alfredo sauce, but this was just amazing. 

For us college students, we ran out of pasta before we ran out of sauce. I scaled this for 10 people and we still ran short.

If you're going to make this for a group of hungry people (as you should always cook for), make more pasta than you think you'll need. There will always be that one person who will eat 2-3 times the regular serving of pasta.

I'm not sure how to rate this recipe.  I am not a big alfredo fan, but this was not bad.  The bleu cheese was not overpowering, it was just enough.  I only used a 12 oz. box of fettucine noodles and I felt it was a little on the dry side.  If I used a 16 oz. box as recommended in the recipe, it would have been very dry.  I did add some grilled chicken breasts to this.  Overall, it was ok.  My husband loved it, said it tasted like something from Olive Garden.  Although, I'm not sure I'd make it again unless he specifically asks for it.

I thought this was pretty good but it definitely needs a meat or vegetable added to it.  I added sun dried tomatoes and that was good, but next time I'd probably add ham.

This was good, except I like a lot of cheese taste.  I added an extra 2 ounces of bleu cheese to my leftovers and reheated.  This was more to my liking.  Next time I will just double the amount of bleu cheese in the recipe.

I was a little worried about this one after reading some of the reviews but was very pleasantly surprised.  The bleu cheese was enough that there was a slight tang to the sauce but it wasn't overwhelming.  I added a little flour to the sauce and brought it to a low boil for a minute or two and it thickened without any problem.  I also only used 1 teaspoon of Italian Seasoning and the flavoring was perfect for our tastes.  My husband and daughter who are not big bleu cheese fans liked it and all three of us cleaned our plates.  I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe was given to me by a friend who found it here. I don't like bleu cheese so knew I'd be altering the recipe right off. The recipe as written is probably very good, but I wanted to personalize it. I drained the cooked pasta to barely al dente. Then reserved about 3/4 cup of the starchy water to mix into a cheese base of aged romano, sharp white cheddar, cream cheese, and milk. I simmered these for a while and added about 1-1/2 tsps of corn starch. I went really decadent and added lobster (about 2 lbs)that I first quickly sauted in butter and white wine and white pepper to the finished result. I then put it all into a baking dish and added buttered Rits cracker meal to the top. Served it with asparagus on the side. Yummy!

I wanted to like this but thought it was really bland.  Oddly enough, I could barely taste the blue cheese.  I used only half the italian seasoning and it was still overpowering.  Also, even after the leftovers were refrigerated, the sauce stayed liquid - it never thickened to a sauce consistency.

I was looking for a pasta side dish, and decided to try this one. My husband loves blue cheese,and it sounded interesting. I used half the amount of pasta (that's what I had on hand) and it was Penne. I also used half the amount of italian seasoning, as another person suggested. I didn't have half and half, so I used 1 1/2 cups of 1% milk. It was good, but very strong! My 3 year old liked it - much to my surprise. I also left the garlic in the oil - we are big garlic fans as well. I would like to try gorgonzola or feta next time. All in all, it was a very easy and good side dish.

Super rich and fabulous!  I don't like blue cheese, but I love the mild flavor in this dish.  It really enhances the pasta!  I'd rather make this than regular alfredo.  It's really good with chicken added as well.

This is my favorite alfredo recipe on this site, although it is not exaclty perfect. As is it is much too thin, I always double the blue cheese and triple the parmesan to thicken it up. Even then it still requires some more thickening with flour, but the blue cheese definitely adds a nice flavor to it. After that, it is really delicious served over pasta with shrimp. Don't forget to add a clove or two extra of fresh minced garlic! Yum.

I added sundried tomatoes too, but didn't have any Italian seasoning.  I live in Spain, and Italian seasoning isn't available here.  Next time I'll just add more salt, because it really did need something extra.  I also added left over grilled chicken.  It was good, but the Italian seasoning would probably make it great.

This is absolutely phenomenal!  I used feta instead of blue cheese and it turned out great.  As others said it's tough to reheat, but so is any rich alfredo.  Definitely going to make this one again soon!

This wasn't bad...I substituted LOL Fat-Free 1/2&1/2 with a little flour for thickening...I tossed with cheese tortellini.  It was a bit much for an entire meal....would be good as a first course.

I made this last night & added the crab meat like several had suggested.  All we could taste is the bleu cheese, it was a waste of good crab!  If you LOVE bleu cheese then this is the recipe for you.  I will not make it again.

This turned out very well.  I substituted soy milk thickened with flour for the heavy cream.  I also added more blue cheese than called for, and I added toasted pecans.

This is the only alfredo my husband will eat now and is great with grilled steaks.  This is about the only recipe I do not change except I mince the garlic and leave it in the oil.  Love this recipe and I don't even like blue cheese very much.

I love a recipe that my picky children will eat, and they loved this! I simplified things by sauteing the garlic and just adding the cheeses and cream into the same pan. (no need to reserve and seperate). Like other reviewers I used fresh lump crab meat from the fish counter, and also threw in a couple of tablespoons of real bacon bits. It was all very impressive and the family raved.I would serve this to special guests (maybe using lobster meat and fried crumbled pancetta instead...MMM)

I was on a mission to make 'Buffalo Wing pasta', and I thought this was a very good base recipe for my blue cheese cream sauce.  I sauted diced chicken, celery, and onion until caramelized, added a few tbsp white wine, then added 1-2 tbsp. butter and approx. 1/4c Frank's Red Hot sauce.  I opted to use gorgonzola to tone it down a just bit, and also used Herbes de Provence instead of italian seasoning (prefer thyme with chicken).  We thought it was great tossed with linguini.  Not exactly something you would expect to be served at a bar while watching football, but it definitely satisfied our craving for 'bad' finger food and great pasta at the same time.

After reading other reviews to make this I doubled the amount of cheeses and put only 1 cup of fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the heavy cream for 8 oz of dry pasta. I also put in a can of mushrooms as someone suggested and that was an excellent idea. It was still a hair runny, so I combined the pasta with the sauce and let it sit for 5-10 minutes covered before eating. Then the sauce stuck to the pasta nicely. Very good change for pasta.

Well I thought this was just 'ok-ish' - it kinda stunk (guess thats the blue cheese & parmesan effect)..my daughter hated it - took one bite and couldnt eat it.  I put the leftovers in the fridge but the dog will be eating them.

I followed this recipe exactly as it said, and found it to be thin in consistency.  I had to let it sit for a while until it seemed to thicken up at which time it was not very hot.  I'm a beginner when it comes to cooking, so perhaps more experienced people will be able to fix that.  The flavor is excellent, and I will make this again.  I think next time I will try to add some lump crab meat to this for something a little different.  But I recommend this dish!

We thought this was pretty good, though I made some alteration for what I had on hand.  I used half and half instead of cream and added fresh basil, as one reviewer suggested (instead of the italian seasoning).  It was fairly thin, but the flavor was pretty good, though not strong.

Tried this recipe because I love blue cheese.  Was worried that it would be over powering for my husband who isn't a blue cheese lover (or liker)  However, the blue cheese flavor wasn't strong at all.  From previous suggestions I halfed the Italian seasonings but I still thought it was too much. I might just try parsley next time.

My hubby and I did not like this at all!  We didn't even finish our meal.  I admit, I am not a huge fan of blue cheese, but my hubby is, so I don't think that is what it was.  It was definitely bitter.

This was very good, and very rich.  I used Bouquet Garni (Penzey's) instead of Italian seasoning, because it is a little lighter.  It turned out very well.  I also added 1lb browned chicken breasts and 3 chopped up slices of ham for extra flavor.

Very tasty, but next time I will cut back the Italian seasoning by half (for MY tastebuds).  I think the seasoning took away most of the blue cheese flavor.  All-in-all was a big hit!  I served it with grilled chicken breasts!  Will make again!!!

For someone who loves blue cheese in just about anything this was really good!  I was looking for a unique side dish for a filet mignon dinner, and this was the perfect accompaniment.  I used half and half to lighten the alfredo sauce up a little and instead of an Italian seasoning blend, I used basil, thyme, oregano, and a pinch of nutmeg.  It was delicious!

A very easy recipe however it only had a subtle flavour & was not very cheesy. It could have been because I used a mild blue cheese instead of a strong one. I also added the garlic back in rather than just using the oil but it didn't make much of an impact on the flavour.

This recipe is SO GOOD! I added chicken, which is especially good when grilled. The sauce is very rich and absolutely delicious. I also added canned, diced tomatoes (with italian seasoning) and mushrooms to this flavorful sauce. One of a kind!

I made this with crab as several others had suggested, and I found it to be blander than I expected.  The zing that was described by many was absent in my rendition.  I thought it was just OK.  The recipe makes quite a large amount, so I would recommend halving the ingredients.

I usually don't like blue cheese, but this was really delicious! EVERYONE loved it! Although it has a really rich and strong flavor, so I'm not sure it would work as a main dish, maybe with chicken. Doesn't reheat well.

One word: YUM! I am a big blue cheese fan and I loved this. It was so creamy and wasn't overpowering at all. The tang of the blue cheese was just right. I crumbled more blue cheese on top when I served it.

I thought it was a little more bland then I would have liked, but it came out very smooth. My friend loved it. It didn't reheat well. I did top it with parmesan and crumbled blue and that gave it more zing. I might have used cheap blue cheese, I got the already crumbled stuff.

Wonderful sauce, mild flavor, easy to make. Next time I make it, I believe I will add crumbled blue cheese as a topping, a suggestion I read in another review.

This was sooo delicious!! I gave it a 4 ONLY because I was expecting the blue cheese to give this sauce some sort of kick. It didn't. Honestly, though, it didn't matter, because it was really fantastic. I baked salmon and served it oven this dish--great!

My husband is a huge bleu cheese fan, so he really liked this recipe. I on the other hand am not,and didn't really care for it because of that. I added chicken to the mix also. I will give this 5 stars because my husband liked it!

my 18yr old daughter made this last week and failed miserably. She subsituted blue cheese dressing for crumbles (huh)? It had a very odd taste if you cook this do not use dressing (hahaha). I also taught to use the reviews attempting a new recipe.  Youth they amaze you every day

I am not a fan of blue cheese at all.  My boyfriend found this recipe and begged me to make it.  I did and he abolutely loved it.  I did try some- it was excellent.  But I really, really don't like blue cheese.  I couldn't even be around him when he was eating it because it smelled sooooo good.  Definely a keeper!!

I LOVED this recipe! It is soooo tasty!  My husband hates cream sauces and alfredos but likes blue cheese so I asked him to "just try this please" and he had a whole plateful!  I didn't have any italian seasoning so just used some garlic salt, oregano, and basil.  I also don't like garlic too much so just omitted the garlic and oil.  It turned out wonderful, better than at some restaurants.  It would be great with some mushrooms, but it perfect as it.  Thanks I'm sure I'll use this often.

This Alfredo was nothing short of luscious:-creamy, tantalizing, full-bodied, without being the least bit heavy. I used Land O' Lakes Fat Free Half and Half in place of the cream, and I got RAVE reviews. The new "Midnight Blue" blue Cheese from Finlandia made this a dream dish!!

This was such a delicious spin on Alfredo!  I thought the blue cheese would be overpowering, but actually it was just right.  We even thought tossing extra cheese crumbles on top was even better.  You gotta try this!

I like alfredo sauce and I like bleu cheese, but i thought this recipe was alright. It doesn't taste like alfredo sauce. I would call this recipe 'Bleu Parmesan'. Tip: Eat right after its done cooking. I waited an hr and 45 mins after and the sauce was mostly dried out. I wouldn't make this recipe again.

Not too shabby, but would sub butter for the oil next time to give it more flavor. Eat this slowly, as it's a heavy dish and will make you sick if you try to gobble it down. Would tone down the garlic and italian seasoning a bit. I wonder how it would taste with blue cheese dressing in the sauce somehow?

This rating is more about me than the recipe.  This just confirms that I am NOT a fan of Alfredo sauce . . . of any kind!

The sauce did not work the way that it was sad to.  Not sure if going to make again. My family did not like it even though we LOVE Blue Cheese

this was a very good recipe if you like a bite to your alfredo sauce. i think i just prefer a more mild, 3 cheese based sauce, as does my boyfriend.

I used a bit more cheese than it called for.  Flavor was good and it might be nice to add some meat (like chicken) to it.

WOW!  This recipe was great.  We took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added crabmeat.  It turned out so good.  We also added some flour per another reviewer.  We didn't mix the noodles with the sauce so we found that it made reheating this dish a lot better.  We served it with fresh sun dried tomato bread.  Great meal!
Thanks!

This was great!  I added crab meat to it, which was a suggestion I read in another review.  A good suggestion it was ---- we loved it!  It is VERY rich though, so we couldn't eat much.  I will be making this again.

Hard to argue with blue cheese, cream, and parmesan mixed together (except of course, caloric density)! The third time I made it I added some a few chopped walnuts and cut back the amount of Italian seasoning just slightly and it turned out great. Using half and half instead of cream was fine, as well. Mmm.

try it with mushrooms and you use Gorgonzola as well which is almost the same as Blue cheese but can be a little milder which is what olive garden does steak Alfredo Gorgonzola use and they also put spinach I do not like so asked them to use mushrooms instead and it now my favorite dish at olive garden but you will not find that version on there menu so you have ask for it

I loved this recipe, but I used it as a base.  The sauce would not have thickened if I didn't jazz it up myself.  If you love blue cheese, I recommend adding extra (I put in about 6 ounces) and I ended up tripling the parmesan cheese.  It was still a little runny, so I thickened it with a little bit of flour.  I served it over gnocchi and it was awesome.  I also added a little bit of grilled chicken.  I will definitely make this again, but will use my doctored recipe with additional cheese and thicken it again as needed. It did thicken a little on its own after I took it off the heat, but it definitely needed some help.

This came out tasting great.  I had trouble getting it to thicken up, finally added some flour.  Instead of using regular salt, I used garlic salt (in additionalt ot the garlic in the recipe), and that seemed to give it more flavor.  I sauteed shrimp and crabmeat in butter and lemon, then added to the sauce while it was simmering.  Turned out great!

This was the best alfredo sauce I have ever tasted!....Better than any resturant. I added chicken.  The sauce was a bit thin so added a small amount of a flour/water mixture.

This was the best alfredo sauce I've ever made. My family loves blue cheese and this was a big hit. It was easy to make and tasted like I had slaved all day...a definite keeper.

this was way too cheesy and creamy...i think less blue cheese should be added...there was a lot of leftovers as everyone just wanted a little.
