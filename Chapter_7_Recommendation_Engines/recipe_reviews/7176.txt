Instructions for cinnamon buns using the mixer or by hand: 
1)Combine water, yeast, sugar. Allow to proof for about 15 minutes in warm place (cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel). I leave my yeast to proof in the microwave after having turned it on for a minute to heat it up. Then I put the yeast mixture in (don't turn on while it is in!).
2)Mix remaining wet ingredients for dough in mixer (or by hand). Add yeast mixture. Mix till combined. 
3)Switch whisk attachment w/ the dough hook (or knead by hand in a large bowl to save mess of having to knead on a surface). Slowly mix in the flour w/ the dough hook, on a low speed. Once flour is more or less blended (& won't fly out of the sides), knead at a high speed till it forms a sort of ball around the dough hook. Avoid adding lots of extra flour to avoid dry buns.
4) Put in large greased and/or lightly floured bowl. Cover & let rise in warm place till doubled in size (about 30-40 minutes- don't leave longer, even not yet doubled).
5) Follow instructions for rolling out & the rest of the recipe as written.

I substituted 1/2 c. of butter w/ 1/4 c. margarine & 1/4 c. oil. It worked fine. A couple of buns that didn't get covered well in the glaze were slightly dry. It is important to use the full amount of the butter for filling so buns don't dry out. I highly recommend them & thank Tania for the wonderful recipe.

If I could give this recipe 10+ stars I would!  A few months ago I made the "clone of a Cinnabon" recipe from this web site, and at the time I said that I would only use that recipe from thereon. That is...until I discovered this recipe over the weekend.What caught my eye was the addition of the pudding mix to the dough.  Anyway, I gave it a try, and I am converted to this recipe.  I used to live near a mall that had a Cinnabon outlet, and I became a cinnabon addict (truly!) The other clone recipe, although very good, wasn't quite it.  Now that I have this one I am in heaven!!! If you closed your eyes and did a taste test with a real cinnabon and this recipe, you most definately would not be able to tell them apart! I havn't made the icing for these yet (I've run out of vanilla), but they almost don't need it.  The buttery, sugary, gooiness of the filling turns into a gorgeous glaze. My husband wants me to start selling these, and he swore he did not like cinnamon buns! Tania, you said these have a distinctive taste, and you're absolutely right!  A million thanks!

Absolutely fabulous recipe.  Very easy to follow.  I used a 16x21 inch board and rolled out the dough to fit it.  Perfect!  I did have to use a larger pan, 12x16, but the 24 rolls fit beautifully.  If you want to fit them into a 9x13 pan, cut the dough into 12 rolls rather than 24.  They need a few more minutes of baking time, but they're huge and delicious.  Better than you can get at any mall or bakery.  I agree with others who suggested more filling but I found doubling it to be a tad too much, so I now make just half again more filling (1 1/2 times the amount called for).  I also used a cream cheese frosting, just because we love it so much!  If you want to make these so they're hot and fresh first thing in the morning, you can make the dough the night before.  After you've rolled them out, spread the brown sugar mixture, rolled and cut them, put them in your prepared pan and put the pan in the fridge.  In the morning, just place a large pan of boiling water in the oven (near the bottom) and put the pan of rolls in above it.  Within 30 minutes or so, they will rise and you will be ready to bake them.  Just take them out, preheat your oven, and you'll have hot, fresh, gooey goodness in no time.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe.  It's perfect!  Thanks so much!

Incredible!  These buns are so tender and delicious!  I didn't have the pudding so I left it out and they were awesome without it-don't know how they could've been any better.

I do NOT have a bread machine but I do have a Kitchen Aid, so I adapted this recipe to reflect that. My oldest boy and I made this recipe together. We proofed the yeast with the warm milk, warm water and the sugar for ten minutes, then we added the egg, the melted butter, the vanilla pudding mix, the salt and the flour. This did need a little more flour to get it to form a ball, about a quarter cup more. Once it formed a ball, we kneaded it with the dough hook for five minutes. We let it rise in a greased bowl over a warm heating pad for an hour, rolled it out and spread on the brown sugar/butter/cinnamon mixture. We got eight biggish rolls out of one recipe (which filled one deep disposable lazagna pan), not close to the serving size that the recipe stated. (Not a huge deal for us, we like bigger rolls. But if someone is making this and wants more rolls out of it, you'll have to double it and cut them a little thinner than we did.) I covered the rolls and let them sit in the fridge overnight until this morning when I put them on the warm heating pad for the second rise. Our rolls were done at 25 minutes. The icing was perfect EXCEPT I needed a lot more milk than the recipe asked for--I want to say 8 teaspoons? These rolls turned out beautifully, you'd think that they were from Cinnabon BUT these were WAY too sweet for us. It really was overkill. If I were to make this again, I'd cut the filling by half. NOTE: Half a box of instant vanilla pudding mix is a quarter cup.

I made these cinnamon buns 3 times before posting this review. Each time I made them, they got a relatively positive reception, but I think it was because most of the people who tried them had eaten cinnamon buns maybe once or twice in their lives. There was something about them that really bothered me. I finally realized what it was: they did come out gooey, but it was because they stayed quite raw. Baking them longer than the recommended 20 minutes did cook them a little more, but the cooked parts were dry and crusty, and the gooey parts were really just raw dough. And the sugar to butter ratio was way too low such that the sauce turned into butter soup while it was baking, leaving none of the filling in the buns. Thanks to BellesAZ who posted her idea of using Grandma Van Doren's white bread recipe as the base for the bread. Using this recommendation, I made the most incredible, fluffy, moist cinnamon buns ever. And for filling I used 1/4 of a cup butter to 1 cup brown sugar (with lots of cinnamon). My husband thought it was to die for. That is what I'll stick to from now on.

These were the most delicious cinnamon buns I've ever had - even better then the store bought ones! When I first made them, they were absoluetly deeeeelicious. They melted in your mouth and the savory cinnamon flavour filled your house. A few days after, I had tried the "Clone of a Cinnabon" and I'd have to say, these were 100x better! The other recipe's cinnamon buns where very hard and not as oooey and goooey as these delicious treats. I didn't modify the recipe one bit because it was so good. A tip for making these cinnamon buns is when you flatten out the large rectangle, use a butter knife a straighten out all the sides (you can take those extra pieces for patching). This way, you won't have "end pieces" that no one will eat. 
The texture of the dough was exceptionally delicious - soft and chewy and the filling was so flavourful - not too bland and not to spicy. I was just looking through the reviews written by others and noticed they had said how these cinnamon buns became hard the next day and how they only lasted 'soft and moist' one day. What I do is pop it on a plate and stick it in the microwave for a good 20-25 seconds (depends on your microwave!!!) then it becomes chewy gooey and fresh and soft and moist all over again. Thank you very much for this recipe. Defenitely a keeper! (I've made these about 15 times and I won't stop!!) :)

These have to be some of the most wonderful cinnamon buns around!  I have made them a few times and find the recipe rather sweet for my own  tastes (not big on sweet stuff), so I usually cut the sugar and up the cinnamon in my filling.  I also don't ice them - they're great as is, and if I did ice them, this Cinnabon-raised girl would have to go for a cream cheese icing.  The dough, however, is absolutely perfect - fluffy, tender and flavorful.  So perfect that my batch has disappeared in less than 24 hours, thanks to my parents, grandmother, brother and of course, me!  Just in case anyone hasn't heard this tip before, you can use a piece of thread or dental floss to slice the buns easily: cut a piece about a foot long, hold each end and slide it under your finished log of dough.  Cross the ends of the thread over, switching hands, and pull until the thread cuts through the dough.  Works like a charm!  Thank you Tania for a wonderful recipe!

This is sooooooo good, I couldn't believe how delicious they were.  My family ate them all in about 24 hours.  This recipe is under-rated--it's much better than the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe (though I used the frosting from that recipe).  I cannot recommend it enough.  
UPDATE: To keep the cinnamon filling from seeping out, I baked the entire roll without cutting it, and then cut it into individual rolls once it came out of the oven.  I also added pecans to the filling and it tasted even better!

This was the second recipe I tried making cinnamon buns in my bread machine. I have never attempted them before because of all the work involved but boy am I glad I did!!! These were the best cinnamon buns I've ever tasted. My picky kids loved them and two friends who do not bake...ever, asked for the recipe. I used the cinnabon clone icing for them and they were simply to die for! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

So, so good!  I do think that I like these better than "clone of a cinnabon".  They are softer and have that extra something that the other recipe is missing (I think it's the vanilla pudding!)  I always make the night before (roll, slice and put in greased dish) and then in the morning, I put the oven to 200, put a hot, damp towel over the rolls then put the rolls in the oven and TURN IT OFF and leave them in there for 30 min.  Then I take out, pre-heat and bake for 20 min.  Here is the icing I use:
7 Tbs butter
2 oz cream cheese
1.5 C powdered sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp salt
Whip until fluffy and add to hot rolls!

Ok so i have been working my way thru the cinnamon roll recipes. i thought i had found good ones untill now! THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST!!!!!! i mixed it by hand and kneeded for 10mins. let rest for 35mins. rolled out. spread 1 stick of soft butter and sprinkled with a mix of 1cup brown sugar and 3TBS. of cinnamon. it only yielded 12 regular sized rolls. i let rolls rest again for 35 more mins. then baked JUST untill the edges turned golden. PERFECTION!!!!!!! please note that during both rest times the dough didnt rise very much but they exploded in the oven! I put 6 in a pan and wraped 6 in plastic to store in the freezer. iced with creamcheese frosting. THE BEST PART IS THAT THEY STAY SOFT AND GOOEY EVEN AS LEFTOVERS!!! WILL NEVER MAKE ANOTHER RECIPE AGAIN!!!!! I ALSO CUT HALF THE "LOG" AND MADE CINNAMON RAISIN PECAN BREAD!!!!

Granted,this is the first cinnamon roll recipe I've ever tried, but it did come out FABULOUS. I made it without a bread machine: sprinkle yeast over milk and allow to sit for about five minutes or until dissolved and bubbly.  Whisk in everything but the flour, then whisk in 1 cup of the flour.  Mix in the rest, eventually kneading it by hand until all the flour is incorporated.  Knead for 3-5 minutes (dough is sticky but will get more elastic). Put it in an oiled bowl and turn once, cover with a wet towel and put in a 200 degree oven. TURN THE OVEN OFF AS SOON AS THE BOWL IS IN IT.  Allow to rise for an hour, until doubled in size. Then follow the rest of the instructions per the recipe. The only thing I changed was I added an extra tsp of cinnamon to the filling and made cream cheese icing: 3 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/8 tsp salt (omit if using salted butter), 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar. Simply yumtastic!

This recipe worked out beautifully. The dough consistency out of my bread machine was perfect! I baked my cinnamon rolls in a 13 x 9 inch glass pan so I set my oven at 325 degrees and had to add about 10 or 12 minutes to the bake time to let them brown. The rolls are wonderful! Thank you for a keeper, Tania!

WOW!!!  I just inherited a regal bread machine with no manual, so I added the ingredients as listed, and it worked perfectly.  It was my very first time using a bread machine, also my first time making cinnamon buns.

I used a little bit of extra butter and brown sugar, and used lots of butter in the pan.  When I took them out of the oven I turned them out onto a plate immediately, cause I knew all that gooey sugar would turn very sticky, then I drizzled what was left in the pan over top of the buns, and soaked the pan in soapy water right away.

I think these are the best cinnamon buns ever.  I put cream cheese icing on half of them, cause my hubby likes his without.  To me, they don't really need icing, I think they are perfect the way they are, but the kids liked them both ways.  I think next time I won't even bother with icing.  They are the perfect texture, the perfect sweetness, and they are so easy!!!  

I will make these again and again, especially for Christmas treats to pass out to my hubby's single friends!

Absolutely wonderful! These cinnamon rolls were so soft and moist, with the exterior just the right firmness. There are too extremes to cinnamon rolls, the hard or soft ones. These straight dough ones have won me over hands down! I reduced the amount of brown sugar as I don't like my cinnamon rolls too sweet. The secret is definitely the pudding mix! Be warned though, the cinnamon sugar paste will seep to the bottom of the rolls while baking. It would be difficult to clean the baking pan so I think it would be good to line the pan with parchment or baking paper.

These are soooo good.  The best recipe I've found so far.  Stored them in a Ziploc baggy and there were delicious day 2 and 3 as well!

10++ stars for sure.  SO GOOD!  Much better than "clone of a cinnabon".  Moist and delicious.  I did make a day ahead of time- after the bread machine cycle I cut them up and put in the dish to rise for the hour-then I wrapped in plastic wrap and popped in the fridge. In the morning I took them out and let them sit at room temp for about 45 minutes and popped into the oven...HOLY GOODNESS!  Cook time for me was more like 25 minutes(probably cause I had them in the fridge overnight)   The only change for me was I do prefer the frosting to be cream cheese based so I made it that way( 4oz cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups conf sugar, 1/4 cup butter and a squirt of vanilla) Thanks for my new favorite recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  Used a 9x13 pan and made 12 large rolls.  (Using dental floss to cut dough works great.) Gave this recipe to all my bread baking friends and everyone loves it.

By far the best cinnamon buns I have ever had.  The dough comes out so soft and moist that I was convinced it wasnt baked through.  I was wrong!  It was just that moist.  I altered the frosting recipe to yield 50% more than suggested.

The absolute best dang cinnamon rolls I've ever made and I've made my share. Like others, the pudding caught my eye and I knew I had to try this recipe. So glad I did, as this is really the only recipe I ever need to make again. The bread itself is so tender and easy to work with. The flavor is outstanding. Because of guests, I eliminated the nuts and raisins this time around and took the suggestion of some other reviewers to up the cinnamon. I did use 1 TBSP. Other than that, made as directed except I didn't use a bread maker and instead used my KA, and I am now a fat and sassy mama....not a good start to the New Year, but at least my family loves me and appreciates this!

I used this recipe and doubled it - because, honestly, what does one do with 1/2 a pkg of instant pudding mix.

I followed the instructions in the first comment (for non-bread machine users).

I also made them a few days ahead of when I needed them - after the buns had been rolled and cut and arranged in the pan I covered them with plastic wrap and stuck them in the freezer until the night before I needed them.

I took the trays out of the freezer the night before - and put them in the fridge to thaw.  Prior to cooking I let them rise, then baked them.

I made a cream cheese frosting for them -

They are AMAZING!  Even my Husband (who is not big on "sweet stuff cinnamon bunny things") loved them.

THESE ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!
I didn't have the time to do everything at once so I made the dough the night before, filled it and rolled it and put it in the freezer. Then, in the morning I took the log out, sliced it, and let the buns thaw and rise while I went to church. Then, I came home and baked them. YUM YUM YUM!

I've never made cinammon buns before but you'd never know!  These were the biggest hit at our Christmas morning breakfast... although the icing doesn't go very far.  I suggest making doubling it and making it in two batches since sometimes the confectioners sugar can get pasty

Great recipe. I'm sure if I'd thought to read through the other reviews I would have caught the reference to kneading the lot in a greased bowl. A must, I kneaded on a floured surface and it soaked up quite a lot of extra flour which made it a bit of a trick to roll it out. It was so darned elastic, it kept wanting to suck itself back into a ball. I managed it but good grief, just knead it in a bowl, all will be well, these are tasty!!

So delicious and satisfying.  I found out I can make it into an impressive loaf by rolling the dough slightly thicker and to fit the length of a loaf pan--add the filling roll up and bake--yummy!

Wow! This is much easier, and just as good, as the cinnamon roll recipe I inherited from the women in my hometown. I used a mixer stand, following these initial steps: first heat the water, butter, and milk until it they were warm (not hot!); second, add the yeast, sugar, and pudding mix and let it all grow until spongy (10 minutes). Yum yum.

These were really good, but I think they could've used a little more cinnamon. I did use the cream cheese icing from the "Clone of a Cinnabon" recipe. I did have some trouble in making these though, which probably had to do with my technique more than the validity of the recipe. I had to mix by hand, and didn't add the vanilla pudding. My dough didn't rise much at all, and kept sticking to my counter when trying to roll it up. I did sprinkle some flour on it so I'm not sure why it was so sticky. Like I said though, they taste pretty great!

A delicious recipe if followed to the 'T' and even if you don't. 

I did it the 1st time as written with bread machine and frosting - turned out great. Didn't need parchment.

Tried it the 2nd time and did dough by hand, using: a) .25 oz package of fast rising yeast by first heating water to 110F, putting in the yeast and sugar, covering with saran wrap and proofing in the microwave, which was prewarmed 1 minute while empty; b) knead dough in a bowl when sticky, adding flour as you go, c) turn dough onto a Silpat for kneading by hand until rubbery but not dry; I did not need oil or flour to achieve this. Doubled fine in the oven with the light on. Roll out dough on the same Silpat and cut with dental floss. To preserve gooey goodness, I use half of the cinnamon/sugar/butter mixture in the rollup process and rub the other half on top and the sides after they're placed on/in the pan of choice. Proofing in oven with the light on was perfect. Using bread flour, cake flour or all purpose flour have all yielded the same wonderful results.

Whether baked individually in a rectangle pan or in a round pan as a pull apart (mine didn't leak as a pull apart), rolls turn out fully cooked don't stick to the bottom and get eaten the first hour...or at least the first day. I use the cream cheese frosting of 3 oz cream cheese, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 cup butter and 1.5 cups powdered sugar - perfect amount for me.

They are not easy, but nothing worth having or eating usually is :)

Fantastic recipe! I used buttermilk instead of plain milk and 2 tbsps of cinnamon not 2 tsps. Everyone loved them and easy dough to work with especially using the bread machine!
Later I made again with cream cheese icing as previous people had recommended, OUTSTANDING!
my neighbours were in HEAVEN!

I've made these rolls for family and coworkers many times. Everyone loves them. They are very moist, tender and flavorful and they turn out perfectly every time. I have lots of requests to make them again, and they even prompted a friend  to buy a bread machine!

I have made this several times, it is so easy and delicious, we had them Christmas morning with my extended family and got lots of rave reviews. I have tried freezing as well and it works like a charm

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  The only thing I did differently was I used a whole 4 serving size package of cheesecake flavored pudding mix - I didn't have the vanilla flavor and I neglected to read the directions where it said use 1/2 of a package.  I will use a whole package again the next time I make these as they are so wonderful the way they are!  I only ended up with a dozen too - 12 amazingly good cinnamon rolls.  Thank you!

Made these today and while they are very tasty, they did not raise well. The recipe is not as specific as it should be. For instance, I used a 9x13 inch pan and an 8x8 inch pan. The recipe just says a 9x13--no way you will get that many rolls in one pan!Also, I think the milk should be warmed before you put it in the ABM--perhaps that may be why my rolls didn't raise well. Will try again with these changes.

I've tried both this recipe and the "clone of a cinnabun" and this won unamiously... the gooey-ness was the deciding factor.
I used cinnabun's cream cheese frosting though.

absolutely delicious!  I've tried a few cinnamon bun recipes now and this one is definitely the best.  The only thing I changed is instead of 1/2 pkg of regular pudding I used a whole pkg of light and only 3/4c brown sugar for the filling.

Absolutely delicious! The first time I made these, I did not give them enough time to rise.  You will get cinnamon sugar cooked dough if you do this.  It was not good.  I decided to try again.  I made the dough the night before, refrigerated them overnight, and cooked them the next morning.  They are delicious, and as my husband says, better than cinnabon.  Try these.  Follow the recipe EXACTLY.  You won't be disappointed.  I did add cinnamon to my frosting, as I love it, but that is not a must.  Enjoy!

I did not care for these at all. They were too soft if there is such a thing. They melted in your mouth in a bad way. I'll go back to clone of a cinnabon.

This recipe makes the best cinnamon buns I've ever baked!  Too bad there was only 5 stars to rate these incredible cinnamon buns!  My family loves these!   I've used this recipe for over 8 years now, and it's never failed me.    If I don't have instant vanilla pudding mix in my pantry, the pudding mix that requires cooking also works well in this recipe.  I've made these buns with either type of pudding mix with excellent results.  I cut my buns with dental floss to help them keep their round shape.  When we want something a little different, I'll make this recipe with a glaze that goes into the bottom of the baking pan before the rolls are added.

Again, another cinnamon roll recipe using vanilla pudding.. it made the taste very "off" and not at all like a traditional cinnamon roll.  There is hardly enough brown sugar in these to get the "oozing" promised in the description.  Bread flour makes these rolls far too heavy.  For a nice, light cinnamon roll, use Grandma Van Doren's bread recipe here.. it makes three loaves.  Use 1/3 recipe to roll out some rolls and bake up two nice loaves of bread.. delish and what cinnamon rolls should be like.

I tried many cinnamon rolls recipes b4, and ended up sticking with "clone of a cinnabon" from this site for a while, until this recipe caught my eye because of the pudding mix. I tried it and it really is moist and gooey! So delish. Everyone loved it. Very comparable to clone of a cinnabon recipe though. Not better or less good. That is why I might stick to the other one, just because it is more simple and more natural(no use if pudding mix!). Thanks for sharing!

These were very good!  I did not have a bread machine so I used my KA mixer with the dough hook.  I had to add a little more flour to get the dough the right consistency (maybe a couple more tablespoons).  I let it rise for about 1-1/2 hrs., punched it down, let it rest for about 5 minutes, then rolled it out and followed the directions from there.  The only thing I did differently was to use maple flavoring instead of vanilla and I used three 9" round cake pans so I could give one of the pans away for a gift.  I think next time, I will add a little more butter and definitely more cinnamon.  It did not have as strong of a cinnamon flavor as I would have liked.  Oh yeah, I also made a little extra of the topping.  A definite keeper!

This recipe is great.  Fast, easy, and uses ingredients that I usually have around the pantry.  

The first time I made this recipe I followed another reviewer's advice and baked the cinnamon rolls as one big 'log' to be cut apart when it was done baking.  What a mistake that turned out to be (for me, anyway!).  It wound up overdone at the ends and doughy/undercooked in the middle.  YUCK!

The second time I made the recipe, I followed the regular instructions and sliced the roll into 1" sections.  It turned out perfect!  

Forget ever going to the Cinnabon again, these are 10x better than the mall standard is.  :)

Absolutely amazing! I didn't brush the sugar/butter mixture on top, but melted butter, and spread brown sugar and cinnamon on the bottom of the pan. I also added a bit more cinnamon, and some vanilla to the inner-roll mixture. This is so good!!

This is by far the BEST recipe for cinnamon rolls I have ever tried (and I have tried many) - the only thing I would change is to let your dough rest for 10-20 minutes before rolling it out - that way the ends won't be so elastic - TERRIFIC recipe :)

I must say...this is THE BEST Cinnamon Bun recipe ever.  I've made it many times for my kids (whom each must have at least 2 or 3 at a time) and made them as gifts for family and friends.  They gave rave reviews!  I've made them for my son's classroom birthday celebrations and they practically licked the pan clean.  This is a must try...definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

These were really good... I made as directly except for one thing.

When putting the ingredients in your bread machine, you should put the salt in BEFORE the flour.  If you put it in after the flour you run the risk of your yeast touching the salt, which could 'burn' the yeast, thereby causing problems for the dough to rise.  
I typically add the liquids, salt, sugar, seasoning, etc., before adding the flour, then of course the yeast.

DELICIOUS!!!! They don't last long in my house, so much so my husband asked to stop making them for a while :P  For the pudding I used 1/2 a package of Instant vanilla Jell-o 102g 4 servings... I measured out the whole package to be 1/2 cup so I used 1/4 cup.

OMG....AMAZING! Brought some to my neighbors right out of the oven. She actually asked if they could have another after they polished off the three I brought them and noted they were the best she has ever had. SO GOOD. I'm honestly not even a Cinnamon Bun fan and really liked them. Can't wait to make them again. I made the night before. Cut them up and put them in two pans. Covered tightly and put them in refrigerator. Took out about an hour before I was ready to cook them in the morning to let them rise. Made frosting while baking. AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!!!

Absolutely fantastic! My husband prefers the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe which is also wonderful, but I like this one a little better. The rolls were a little more tender and flavorful. You really can't go wrong with either recipe.

**UPDATE** These buns are HUGE..and DELICIOUS. I cant imagine anyone not liking them. I forgot to mention in my earlier post that I added 1-1/2 tbs of all purpose flour to my filling mix. Some of the other reviews said the filling melted out of the bun and into the pan. The addition of the flour worked perfect. The filling thickened up and stayed put. I cut mine 1-1/4 inch thick and honestly could have used a second pan. They got so big. I don't like skinny, flat buns like the can. I wanted them tall, fluffy, and touching so the sides would be really soft. This weekend I am making them again only this time I'm adding walnuts, and raisins and peach preserves I made from scratch several weeks ago. GREAT RECIPE FOLKS..This will be my only cinnamon bun recipe from now on. Thanks to the author for sharing, U made me a star in the eye's of my family and friends. Thank you, Berly Ann from TEXAS

These buns were very good - the vanilla pudding gave the dough an interesting flavor.  The topping was WAY too sweet.  We ended up scraping all of it off the buns.  So, be careful not to put it on all the buns until you taste it.

These are 200% better then the clone of the Cinnabon recipe. Next time I will only use 3/4 cup of brown sugar. The full cup was to sweet for me. :P  This is my new Favorite Cinnamon Bun Recipe.

Wow! These are great! I love storebought cinnamon buns but all the homemade ones i've had tasted too much like dinner rolls with cinnamon in them. These are just perfectly soft and gooey! I used the whole box of pudding mix and for the icing I used French Vanilla coffee creamer (you know the International Delight or CoffeMate kind) instead of the milk. YUM! They were all gone in 2 days! Definitely will make these again and again!!

These were very good.  I just had a couple of issues that were probably my fault.  They didn't rise as much as I would have liked, but I may have proofed the yeast for too long.  Then the brown sugar came out and ran into the bottom of the pan while they were rising.  No biggie though because they were still soft and gooey just the way I like them.  I used the cinnabon cream cheese icing and it was delicious!  I will try these again and see how they turn out next time!
***update***  These made enough for me to have 3 round pans.  The second pan I let rise overnight in a cold oven and they were perfect.  The brown sugar did not seep out either.  These are absolutely wonderful!!

They were excellent! The onbly problem was when i took the dough out of the bread machine it was too runny and soft, had to add more flour.BUt other than that it was great.I was eating one out of the oven while i typed, Thank you! So now I'll try some others, to see how they are.BUt these are a keeper.

This is a great cinnamon roll recipe - it tastes just like I expected, and the rolls are very soft and fluffy. I have another type of sweet roll recipe that also uses pudding mix in the dough, and I love it, so knew I'd love this one as well. I had no vanilla pudding mix, nor any instant mix at all for that matter. I used "cook and serve" butterscotch mix, and they turned out great.  My family loved them. I will definitely be making them again.

Holy Cow!  These were amazing...  We gobbled up half the pan and shared the rest with our neighbors.  They called a half-hour later and demanded the recipe.  The only change I made was to add 4oz cream cheese to the frosting.  I also added the optional walnuts and raisins.  GREAT RECIPE!

Diddily doo, didilydo dar day....I have been reduced to Ned Flanders bumbling after tasting these amazing tasty treats.  I am an Aussie who has just spent 4 months in the USA and was totally besotted by the cinnamon buns there (we dont have them here!)  So I endeavoured to find a recipe that I could use with my bread maker..  Wow its so easy and my kids nearly passed out when they tasted them!!!!!  my husband muttered something incomprehendable as he stuffed them into his mouth.  Thank you Tanya for a rippa of a recipe!!!!

This is one of the best cinnamon roll recipes I have ever tried and I have been trying them for more than 50 years!!  But I have always had a problem with the fact that homemade yeast goods get stale so quickly! Twenty-four hours and that is it for any recipe I have ever tried. A catalog house I have ordered from over the years introduced me to Lecithin as a solution to this. Lecithin is a soy product that  helps dough retain moisture. I bought their lecithin granules and liked the way all my yeast goods stayed fresh. But some recipes bake faster than others and the lecithin granules don't melt fast enough so I quit using them except for larger dough projects.  The I found LIQUID LECITHIN!  What a wonderful difference this makes! Even 3 days later, my cinnamon rolls as still soft and sweet. My advice is this:  after you melt the 4 tbls. of butter, thoroughly mix 1 tabls. of liquid lecithin  into it.  Liquid Lecithin is very, very thick so give it some time to get out of the bottle. The rest of this recipe goes as posted. What a great treat you will serve your family! I but liquid lecithin at my local Vitamin Shoppe but I know there are sources on the internet. I hope you will try it!

These are by far the best cinnamon rolls I've ever made.  In fact, I've been using this recipe for christmas gifts for my neighbors for over 10 years.  I make the dough in my kitchenaid mixer, place the rolls in disposable aluminum foil pans, wrap in plastic wrap and freeze.  We deliver them with a little gladware of cream cheese icing/glaze with instructions on how to thaw overnight and bake christmas morning.

Mmmm! These were delish and made the house smell sooo good! I took them to work and they were gone in no time. I got compliments on them from the staff all day. =)

When making them without the aid of a bread maker or stand mixer, I have a few key tricks that I don't see anyone had noted.

1.) Proof the yeast in the warm water with 1 tsp. of the sugar from the recipe.
2.) While yeast is doubling, *slowly* melt the butter in the milk over the stovetop on med-low heat. Beat the (room temp) egg in your mixing bowl, and then wisk in your milk/butter before adding yeast mix. 

The key is not to shock the yeast with any cold ingredients.

I did a first rise of the dough (45 min.) before rolling it out and adding the filling, etc. For the second rise of the prepared rolls, I put a hot towel under the pan and covered with plastic wrap and another warm towel. 2 rises may take longer, but it made for *perfect* cinnamon rolls.

I've been making this recipe for 10 years and it has ALWAYS turned out fantastic.  I get so many requests from friends and family to bring these buns.  I usually make it exactly as written (except using all purpose flour instead of bread machine and traditional yeast) unless I am making for my father-in-law and then I double the cinnamon :)

OMG!!! I just took these out of the oven, and covered them in Cream Cheese icing...these are by far the best Cinnamon Buns I have ever had! CinnaBon who needs you!!! LOL
I used my mix master to prepare the dough, following one reviewers instructions, and then continued with the recipe's directions. Don't need to change a thing! Perfection!!!

Is it possible to have a rating of 10 on here???  These are WONDERFUL!!!  Tried several recipes from here and there, and was about to give up till this morning.  Thought I would give it another try... one more try.  These are so fluffy it is not funny!  I used only half of the recipe for the frosting and cinnamon and sugar blend and put walnuts into it.  BRAVO!!  My tummy thanks you!

I followed as is, the only thing I had to do was add extra milk to the frosting mixture, as it was too thick for my personal preference. Otherwise, extremely delicious! Great Recipe!

These are wonderful, absolutely decadent, I love them. Both this recipe and the "clone of a Cinnabon" recipe are so delicious, I can't really pick a favorite...it depends what you are in the mood for, as both are wonderful but taste slightly different. The only thing I would change would be to possibly make 1.5x the filling next time.

This recipe was WONDERFUL! I have never made cinnamon buns before. This recipe was time consuming but well worth it. The only change I will make next time is not to add so much icing. It made it too sweet. Overall I will make this over and over. Thanks FIONASMOM!

Love this every time!!! I use my bread machine and couldn't be more pleased with the ease and taste of this recipe. My frosting came out a little chunky the first time but I use a standard buttercream or cream cheese frosting now. SOOOOO GOOD! Especially when pregnant.

These were sooo good! I used the tips for making by hand, written by another reviewer, and they worked out wonderfully. I also only had regular flour and 1 yeast packet on hand, so that's what I used. I also put a tsp of cardamon in the dough, which was a nice addition. Great recipe!

I can't believe I haven't rated these yet. I made these on Christmas morning for my family for breakfast and they were the BEST cinnamon rolls I have ever had and the ONLY recipe I will use from now on. I made them the night before and refrigerated them overnight. The only change I made was to make a cream cheese frosting instead of the one listed (which I highly recommend). Used to make "clone of a cinnabun" but I will not be making that anymore!

Yum! I had two batches...one, I placed the rolls about an inch apart in a 9x13 inch pan, and they looked squished, but baked up wonderfully...nice and soft (and gooey).  The other, I set farther apart.  They looked nicer, but baked up harder and dryer... so, as long as you're not overly-concerned about presentation, definitely set them closer together, and get yourself a washcloth!

Really fantastic.  The dough was wonderful to work with.  I'm less of a fan of the drizzle for the top, but it was still really quite good!

The absolute BEST cinnamon rolls we have ever eaten! I followed the recipe exactly, but did not frost. The suggestion of using string to "cross cut" the rolls worked VERY well!  Just use about a foot of thread and slide it under the rolled up dough then bring the strings together and cross them to cut the dough.  I also used parchment paper to line the cookie sheet and let them rise and bake on it, then I used it to wrap up the left overs and they stayed very moist!  Can't wait to make them again!!

I have tried many, many recipes for cinnamon rolls and this one is by far the best.  I put mine on a jelly roll pan instead of a 9x13 so they could rise properly and not be squished. I like nice round rolls. I also did a cream cheese frosting. I am using these for a family get together and I am sure they will be a hit.  Thank you! (followed recipe exactly..baked for 18 minutes. I'm high altitude and they worked great)

Wonderful!!  I am making them for the second time right now.  They are so tender and tasty.  The bread is not dry like so many other recipes.  I don't use the pudding mix but instead add 3T extra sugar to make up for the sweetness they would be missing.  For my frosting I mix a pkg of cream cheese, 2 tsp vanilla, powdered sugar and a little milk and beat it until fluffy, so yummy on these rolls.  I have already shared this recipe with several friends.

After making these rolls over the weekend my husband told me "these are the best things you've ever made".  I made a few minor adjustments:  I added 1/2 cup white sugar to the sugar/cinnamon center and I put about 3T of cinnamon in.  I used the clone of a cinnabon icing (minus 1/2 c. powdered sugar)These were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  Thanks for the recipe

Made these tonight and I'm still not too sure about them. A lot of the filling oozed out of the buns while cooking and left them pretty tasteless. I made more of the filling, melted it and drizzled it over the tops which seemed to make a bit of a difference. If I try them again I might either try to roll them tighter or cook it as a roll and then cut them. Very very messy. But the dough itself was quite good. I'm very impressed by that. I'll probably try this one more time to be sure, but so far I'm not convinced of this recipe.

This was a really good recipe. I did make some changes though. First, I don't have a bread machine, so I did it in my Kitchen Aid mix master instead. I just warmed the milk and added the yeast, letting it sit untill it was frothy, and then just continued how you usually would when making bread. I also added more melted butter then called for (almost a 1/2 cup) Other then that I followed the bun recipe exactly. For the filling, I added some vanilla. After the buns were formed and in the pan, I dotten them with butter, and sprinkled a little extra brwon sugar on top. For the topping, I used a cream cheese icing instead. I put it on when the buns were still warm so it REALLY soaked in to the buns. SO YUMMY!!
Thank you for this recipe. It will be added to our family favotites!

Best ever! I have had made this recipe many times now. Over the past years I have began to deveolpe my technique for bread and I feel that each time I make these, they come out better. I've tried one other recipe for cinnamon rolls: "Clone of a Cinnabon" and they were good, don't get me wrong. But this recipe just trumps that. These cinnamons are just delicious. They are so good they are often requested by my family members. Thank you for the delicious recipe.

This only gets 3 stars because I pretty much used a different recipe per other reviewers.  This recipe most of the ingredients are fine but I don't agree with the brown sugar amounts or the cinnamon for 2 dozen cinnamon rolls.  Too little.  I used a base dough from Grandma VanDoren's White Bread.  I actually do use that to make my bread and its awesome in the bread machine.  Only difference is I rounded up to 3 tablespoons of sugar instead of 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons of sugar.  Wanted to add a little more sweetness to the dough.  After rolling out I used 1/4 cup of softened butter and spread it over the dough, sprinkled cinnamon generously over the dough 2 tablespoons maybe, and sprinkled 1 cup of dark brown sugar on top of that.  You can use light brown if you want.  After cutting your rolls let rise in a greased pan for 35 minutes covered with a towel.  Note: Grandma VanDoren's recipe is yielded for 3 loaves so you have to cut it 3 ways to get 1 loaf and you can click to adjust that for you.  350 for 15 minutes, cover with foil and bake another 5.  Spread whatever frosting you like.  These were yummy and gooey but were done, not undercooked or overcooked.  Perfect!

Used this recipe as a base wth my own tweaks, and it was excellent!I didn't have vanilla pudding, so I substituted 1tbs cornflour + extra 1tbs sugar + 1/2tsp vanilla. Also didn't have a bread machine, so placed (warmed) milk, water, butter, sugar, beaten egg and yeast in measuring jug - left for a few minutes until mixture became frothy. Placed flour/s in large bowl (I substituted about half of the bread flour for a mix of wholemeal, barley and rye flour - just to add a bit more fibre), made a well in the centre, then added the milk-yeast mixture. Kneaded by hand for about 10 mins till dough was elastic. Covered and let prove for about 1hr (or until doubled in size), then followed the steps above from Step 2 onwards. I'd like to add that I think there is a typo in the icing proportions, instead of 4tbs butter and 1 tsp milk, I think it is 1tsp butter and 4tbs milk (the former makes a very yellow buttery icing). And my own tweak, a handful of toasted flaked almonds over the icing to finish! Scrumptious!

A great recipe that also works at high altitude! These changes ensure tender rolls and make a sharper filling: 
 
Rolls: 
Shape dough on surface dusted with 2 Tbsp flour; place in a large Ziploc bag. Squeeze air out of the bag, close and chill overnight. 

On surface dusted with 2 Tbsp flour, rest dough 10 minutes. Shape into 10" x 18" rectangle with your hands by pounding and pushing dough. This reduces gluten development than using a rolling pin. 

Cut 1"-thick rolls with serrated knife; divide among 3 greased 9" round cake pans. They bake more evenly than in 13" x 9" pan (center rolls underbake).

Proof Box:  
Place pans with rolls on upper oven shelf and large pan filled with boiling water on lower shelf; close door. Set temperature to 400 degrees for exactly 1 minute; turn off heat. Raise until doubled (15-20 minutes at high altitude). Bake just until edges of outer rolls are light gold (exactly 18 minutes in my oven at high altitude).

Sharper Filling: 
Beat ingredients until smooth. This is easier than trying to evenly sprinkle sugar and cinnamon over buttered dough.

I add culinary (not aromatherapy) cinnamon oil. Taste oil before using; I add 1 Tbsp of the mild Savory Spice Shop oil, but just 1 tsp of the much stronger Olive Nation oil. I buy oil online. 

More Frosting: 
8 oz. softened cream cheese
1/2 cup softened butter
2 cups powdered sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 tsp milk
1/8 tsp to 1/4 tsp lemon juice (to enhance cream cheese tang)
Beat until smooth.

I made this yesterday and I think this is going to be my favourite recipe for cinnamon rolls from now onward. It was easy, and my dough turned out perfect. The buns were soft and yummy.

I was out of pudding mix, didn't roll tight enough, cut them too big - - - and they were absolutely delicious!  Only change was to add a pinch of clover to enhance the cinnamon flavor.  Out of this world - will definately make again.  Made 16 huge rolls for us - had to bake an additional 8 or 9 minutes.

These came out great, those of you who failed are doing it wrong.  I didn't use a bread machine (don't believe in them). So I followed rubes1's suggestion for hand mixing.  I did come across a problem with the flour. The recipe called for 4 cups but I used less, the dry desert may have been a factor in that. By 2 cups it looked ready to go but I added one more cup (3 in total) and they did come out a bit dry and had trouble rising. Despite that issue they still came out moist and ooey gooey. I omitted the raisins and nuts and put TWICE the amount of smear in the middle, I think that helped with the dry air and too much flour issue.  I also omitted the pudding, many of the reviews I read said it gave the rolls an off taste.

Instructions for cinnamon buns using the mixer or by hand: 
 1)Combine water, yeast, sugar. Allow to proof for about 15 minutes in warm place (cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel). I leave my yeast to proof in the microwave after having turned it on for a minute to heat it up. Then I put the yeast mixture in (don't turn on while it is in!).
 2)Mix remaining wet ingredients for dough in mixer (or by hand). Add yeast mixture. Mix till combined. 
 3)Switch whisk attachment w/ the dough hook (or knead by hand in a large bowl to save mess of having to knead on a surface). Slowly mix in the flour w/ the dough hook, on a low speed. Once flour is more or less blended (& won't fly out of the sides), knead at a high speed till it forms a sort of ball around the dough hook. Avoid adding lots of extra flour to avoid dry buns.
 4) Put in large greased and/or lightly floured bowl. Cover & let rise in warm place till doubled in size (about 30-40 minutes- don't leave longer, even not yet doubled).
 5) Follow instructions for rolling out & the rest of the recipe as written.
 
 I substituted 1/2 c. of butter w/ 1/4 c. margarine & 1/4 c. oil. It worked fine. A couple of buns that didn't get covered well in the glaze were slightly dry. It is important to use the full amount of the butter for filling so buns don't dry out. I highly recommend them & thank Tania for the wonderful recipe.

I found this recipe and gave it too my sister inlaw since she has a bread machine( i don't but that may change) she told me she tried them and they turned out really well  she gave one to my best freind to try( I haven't tried them yet, but thet may chang as well) my friend said it tasted like a cheese danish even though no cheese was in them, she rated them a 10 out of 10!! I will betryingt them for sure, i think why they yasted like a danish is because of the pudding mix in them.

Wonderful recipe.  Very moist and delicious.  I made the dough the night before and after they had risen I put them in the fridge, covered.  The next morning I let them sit at room temperature for around 30 minutes before baking.  I had a partial container of mascarpone in the fridge that was close to expiration so I added it to the frosting but that was the only change I made.  It was so decadent and delicious.  We really loved them!

omg these are ridiculously delish. To stop the filling from coming out you need to make sure you leave about a quarter of an inch of dough with no filling so you can pinch them together properlyl. Also, once cooked flip them over onto a tray and let the sugar go back into the buns. Can't stop eating these things!!!

first time ever making cinnamon rolls and these came out so delicious! i ate two and had to walk out of the room to keep from eating the whole pan. the frosting required about two tablespoons of milk for me instead of just the one teaspoon. i also added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the frosting, but that is a personal preference. mine came out soft, but not underdone. cooked for 20 minutes exactly. i made the rolls the night before and cooked them in the morning.

These are fantastic. I have made the other top rated bun on this site and didn't care for it. I could tell the difference in the dough. It was perfect. I made the mistake of putting the glaze on and thinking it wasn't enough before tasting. Then I made another batch. Way too much glaze!

Fabulous recipie for Cinnamon Rolls!  I didn't have milk but had some dried Buttermilk on hand, so I substituted that for the milk called for in this recipie.  I also didn't have Vanilla Pudding on hand, but substituted adding 2 tbs Vanilla extract in the wet mix portion of making the dough.  Doubled the filling like another person reccommended, and used a cream cheese frosting I already had on hand.  It was incredible.. Very moist and good!

Loved this recipe! I never could quite get the other popular cinnamon bun recipe to work for me, but this one was great! I made these the night before and just refrigerated. In the morning, I took them out and let them get to room temp. I put them in the oven at 170 for 20 minutes and then cooked at the suggested temp for another 20 minutes. These were fantastic!

very yummy.  pretty easy but time intensive by the time you allow for the dough in the machine (mine took 90 minutes) plus rise time (another say hour).  But, I'd make them again!

Really good!  my bread machine went a little crazy and didn't mix everything properly so it didn't rise perfectly, but the flavor was still great.  I'm going to do it again in my brother's machine to see if it turns out even better.

They are ok but they are nothing special. They taste like the ones you buy frozen at the stores. I followed the recipe to a T and the gooey stuff overflowed all over the pan leaving the buns almost dry.  The bread was ok (I did it with a mixer because I don't have a bread machine). 
My husband asked me not to make them again... he says he rather be honest than having to eat them again.

I agree with another poster - the vanilla pudding taste is rather off putting in this recipe.  I won't make these again because of the dryness of the crumb and the odd taste.  Sorry, but these were not at all soft, moist or gooey..

First this recipe is fantastic!  I made it by hand just using a fork.  I used the mixing directions for mixer or hand.  Those directions forget to mention the salt and instant pudding.  I added them to the wet mixture before adding the flour.  I used regular yeast (not bread machine yeast) and bread flour.   I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the mixture.  The dough was so nice and manageable.  Before taking them out of the oven, I put a little margarine on each right before taking them out of the oven.  This made them golden brown.  I also added a little extract vanilla and milk to the icing.  These were soooo good!  I plan to take a batch to my mother's house for christmas morning.

i was looking for a good cinnamon bun recipe and i think i found the best - husband said it was the best thing i ever baked! i only had banana pudding mix on hand and like some, put the entire box in. i was a little worried about the banana flavor, but it turned out fine - you won't even know it was in it. i did omit the raisins and used pecans instead of walnuts. i also took heed of others and doubled the brown sugar cinnamon mix. i thought it would be sweet enough without the frosting so i omitted it completely. definitely will be one of my favorite things to bake.

Absolutely the best cinnamons I have made.  The dough came out of the bread machine just beautifully.  Easy to knead and not sticky at all - just perfect.  I used the entire box of pudding mix (forgot to halve it) with no problem.

This recipe was better than the first one I tried, but I think need some help.  They are fantastic right out of the oven, but after a couple hours, the bun becomes really dry and hard.  Ps Im kneading by hand because I have no bread mixture

One adjustment I made was instead of using 1 cup brown sugar for filling I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup butterscotch pudding mix.  Mixed together with 1/2 cup butter and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon into a paste and spread this into a thin layer over the dough.  After rolling tightly and letting the dough rise I had zero seeping.

Recently bought my breadmaker, and tried this recipe for my first cinnamon roll recipe after looking at many great and helpful reviews.  I used my large stonewear bar pan from Pampered Chef.  Recipe made 16 rolls which fit on pan, but baked tightly.  Baked 20 min.  Was amazed how they didn't stick to the pan, lose much filling, and were easy to remove and separate from the pan.  They were so soft and moist.  I used 3 teaspoons of cinnamon and tried putting a bit of icing on top.  However, I find icing on buns generally too sweet and these have plenty of sweet filling as is.  They don't need any icing.  Great recipe!

The only change I made in this recipe was to double the filling.  I didn't have any raisins, and while I always add raisins to cinnamon buns, the lack of them didn't alter this recipe.  The buns were delicious, light and fluffy.  I made them last night and my husband and I ate several of them warm.  I got 16 large ones from the recipe.  I had two this morning [put them in the microwave for a few seconds] and they were yummy. They freeze well and I froze the remainder.  I frosted them with a vanilla frosting from the can.  Thank you --  this is my new favorite cinnamon bun recipe.

Oh my goodness!!! I have tried many a cinnamon roll recipe but none like this one. It was delicious, delicious, delicious. I have finally found my new cinnamon roll recipe. True to the description they were soft, moist, and gooey. In the past, I would work and work and the rolls were very dry. I even like the filling. When I first mixed it up, it seemed too thick but it was perfect for these rolls. Even my husband had seconds and he's not a "sweets" person.

Amazing! I drizzled a 1/4 cup butter over the top of the buns before I put them into the oven to make sure that the tops stayed moist and not crunchy. They turned out amazing.

10 stars!  Absolutely the best homemade cinnamon roll I've had!  These came out perfect!  I am a cinnamon roll-holic, and I will be making these often.  They were easy and every step of the process turned out perfect.  I used whipped cream cheese frosting on them while they were hot and it put them over the top!  Thank you for the recipe!

These are awesome!!! I made these for dessert one night, and everyone kept picking at them before dinner when they came out of the oven. I don't have a bread machine-I just use my kitchen aid mixer with flat beater then dough hook for kneading. I omitted raisins and walnuts and used store-bought cream cheese frosting for a shortcut. Sooo good!!!

This recipie was delicious!  My mom said it was much better than cinnabon and my dad, sister, and best friend loved it.  I used the timer on my bread machine so it would start at 3:30 am, got up at 5 to put  them together, and then slept until 8:15 when I put them in the oven.  They were done by 8:45 and everybody loved them.  I will definately make them again, but next time I think I will take the other bakers' suggestions and make the frosting from the 'Clone of a Cinnabon' recipie. This was great Tania.  I definately reccomend it to everyone else.

These are very good, very easy and so so tastey.  I love the fact that my bread maker does most of the work.
They freeze very well too.  I cooked a batch, let them cool, then I froze them individualy on a tray and once they were all cold I placed them in a freezer bag.  
When we want to eat one they usualy defrost on the counter within 30 minutes and have stayed as moist as when I first baked them.
Thank you so much for this recipe, it is now a family favorite!

OMG!  These are wonderful!  I made them this morning and used the cream cheese icing from another recipe on this site (Clone of a Cinnabon) and they turned out great.  My entire family gave them thumbs up and came back for a second one.  Using my bread machine made it easy and I can already tell that we will be making these quite often.  I did use the entire package of pudding as others had suggested.  Perfect!

I am known for my cinnamon rolls but decided to try this recipe....I think I found a new recipe I like better! It is fantastic and so easy! I didn't have vanilla pudding mix but used cheese cake flavor with awesome success..I also always brush my cinnamon rolls with half and half before baking I tried that with half the batch...three days later my father in law was still eating them...he said they melted in your mouth...

These were so good! I made half for home and half for a club meeting. They were the only dessert that was attacked and people were sad when they were gone. I will for SURE be making these again.

Wow wow wow.  These were so good and looked beautiful.  I hope it wasn't beginners luck becasue I plan on making these again and again.  I left out the pudding mix but cannot imagine them being any sweeter, it would be lost in all the icing and cinnamon goodness.

I love this recipe! The only problem I had was that I could not cut it,it was to mushy. I put it in the freezer and then cut it. It was very easy and good. I'm planning on frosting the rest with a cream cheese frosting. I also did not let them rise much after they were cut, because I did not have time. They came out good anyway. Defiantly will make it again.

This recipe was so good I had to rate it! I made it by hand because I didn't have a bread machine, and it still turned out awesome.
To make it without a bread machine the only thing you have to do differently is activate a regular packet of yeast with 1/2 cup warm water and a tsp. of sugar. Then let it sit with plastic wrap over the bowl for 15 min. 
Mix all the wet ingredients together and then add the flour, I do it a cup at a time because I mix by hand (I'm a broke student and can't afford a blender...).
Then everything else in the recipe is the same, except I baked it at 350 degrees c. for 15 mins, though I suggest keeping an eye on the batch so all your hard work doesn't get ruined if the temp. is not right.
But otherwise delicious! My roommate is raving about them, they are sooo good!

I tried the 'Clone of a Cinnabon' recipe on this site and I like these much better.  I don't have a bread machine so I do this the 'old fashioned' way.  Sometimes I use the icing here and other times make a cream cheese frosting.  Either way, I am becoming known for my cinnamon rolls thanks to this recipe!

These were amazing.  I made the dough in the evening and let them rise in the fridge overnight.  Took them out for an hour or so in the morning before baking.  Perfect.

FABULOUS! Made 15 buns  21 hours ago with 5 people home, there is 1 LEFT!! Unanimous review - FABULOUS! Tweaked a little - used margarine instead of butter, soy milk instead of milk:eliminated nuts and raisins and increased cinnamon to 1 Tbsp:  lined a 15 x 11 pan with parchment paper instead of greasing the pan. Baked for 20 minutes and they were and still are moist (kept covered with aluminum foil overnight.)Definately try these!

I gave these double time in the oven but still the middles were raw dough - is this what's supposed to make them chewy? I didn't use the pudding mix as could not find any but had read that should not make a difference. They were swimming in the butter filling, so not at all suitable for the garden party I had baked them for. Have had to abandon and find something else.

First time I've ever made cinnamon buns. These were not only easy but absolutely awesome! They were so good on their own it wasn't nescesary to make the icing.

These were, as promised, moist and gooey.  Slightly *too* gooey in the middle, however.  They probably could have used a few more minutes in the oven.  Superb, though -- even after a couple days they weren't dry and crusty like other buns.

Used my stand mixer for the dough. It didn't rise that much, but after rolling, filling and cutting it seemed to get a 2nd wind and filled the dish beautifully. 
This was gorgeous. Will be making regularly - I scored some points with these (bf loves cinnamon buns - and I now make the best lol)

These are FANTASTIC!! I followed the recipe, exactly as written, for the rolls but instead of making the icing I used store bought buttercream frosting. My family said these are the best cinnamon rolls they have ever had!

Excellent recipe! I substituted 2cups (self-rising) cake flour & 2cups all-purpose flour for the bread maker flour. Also, I didn't have vanilla pudding so I used close to a Tbsp of pure vanilla instead. Turned out great! Would definitely make these again.

WOW!! These deserve all of the 5 stars + If your looking for a great cinnamon bun recipe look no further.. I have tried alot of recipes over the years... and they didn't even come close.. I took the suggestion of others and used the cream cheese icing from the other recipe on this site...Clone of a Cinnabon.. these stay nice and soft... I always add a little cocoa to my sugar mixture.. I cooked my in mini alum. pans so they came out looking perfectly round..

Great rolls. I did the first rising last night. I rolled them up and cut them to rolls and put them in the fridge overnight so I could bake them in the morning. I took them out this morning and let them sit and warm up in a warm oven. Baked them and had Thanksgiving breakfast with  little work.

These cinnamon buns are far superior to any others I've had. I modified the frosting slightly by adding 4 ounces of cream cheese and a squirt of lemon juice. 
thanks to whoever first posted the recipe.

Delicious!! The only thing is I would eat them fast because after a while (like a week or so) they tend to get dry.  But i don't think that will be much of a problem!! :)

I will not give this a bad review, b/c honestly think I did something wrong. They tasted great, but did not rise at all. If anyone has any tips or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate. Things I did different: used yeast for pizza crust, all I had. Used olive oil instead of butter for the dough, b/c I only had enough to make the cinnamon filling (which I did double the brown sugar, which it didnt melt away as bad). I just recently got the bread machine, so everything is an experiment for me. So Im thinking it was probably the yeast or/and olive oil. Oh one more thing. Most bread recipes use warm water/milk for the yeast to work.

Excellent!  Easy-and definitely the BEST recipe for cinnamon rolls that I have ever made or tasted.  Very similar to cinnabon rolls.  P.s. don't skip the frosting-our family couldn't get enough of it.

Best cinnamon rolls I've ever made!  After the bread machine cycle was done, I formed the rolls, covered with plastic wrap & put in the fridge.  Next morning, brought to room temp, put in a 100 degree oven to rise for 20-30 minutes, then baked.  Cut brown sugar in the filling by 1/4 cup, used half white whole wheat flour and added 2 tsp. wheat germ & 2 tsp. ground flax to help lower the glycemic index a bit.  FABULOUS!!!

My husband and I were so excited to make these Cinnamon Rolls, as all the reviews were amazing. We were very disappointed had a lot of people ecited to trys these, our dough was too hard and thick it was impossible to roll. Don't know if we will try these again, it was a lot of wasted time. Too bad.

AMAZING! I stuck to the entire recipe, except when it came to the frosting- it definately needs more milk than a teaspoon, maybe that's wrong...?? I added 1 more cup of powdered sugar to the frosting, more milk and it was the PERFECT amount, no extras!

Excellent!! I made some probably unnecessary changes, i melted the milk, sugar, butter, and salt in a saucepan before adding to flour. Also, I mixed 1/4 c brown sugar with 1/4 c butter, melted in saucepan and drizzled over cooked buns before I added frosting. Best Ever!

I've lost count how many cinnamon bun recipes I've tested (5?) but this is only 2nd one that tempted me to perform taste test.  I gave these as a Halloween treat and was still putting on the  frosting when three were gobbled up before they had chance to cool.  I added a whole box of vanilla pudding mix (107 g versus 40 g) by mistake and it was not too sweet.  However I did cut back on the cream cheese frosting and added currants.

The name describes these perfectly. I used whole wheat white flour, and they were still delicious. Liked them best with no frosting because it made them a little too sweet (and I have a huge sweet tooth). My husband told me he will never be able to eat another cinnamon roll after tasting these!
The only negative was that they don't keep well the next day, but get a little chewy and tough.

I found this recipe to be the absolute BEST for cinnamon buns!  Would give it 10 stars if I could!  Have tried many others, including the Clone to a Cinnabon and found this to be superior.  Clone was good but not exactly a clone.  I followed the recipe to a T and couldn't believe how delicious these were!  I agree that this recipe should be rated much higher.  Give it a try, I am sure you will agree that it is the absolute best around....and user  friendly too! After about 5 tries I decided to try the Cinnamon filling sold by King Arthur Flour....What heaven that was!!  No runout and strong cinnamon taste.  You may want to try it for yourself!

I made these exactly according to the directions.  They are wonderful!  They are rich, light and soft.  Do not even need frosting they are so good!  Probably in the top 5 of everything to ever come out of my bread machine.  I am already thinking of other applications for this divine dough.

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!  I have tried alot of recipes for cinnamon buns over the years and never found one worth making again. Now that I live far from a mall that has a cinnabon (which disapointed me on my last visit) I never have to be deprived again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Using the instructions that one of the other members posted for using a stand mixer, these are FANTASTIC! I put cream cheese frosting on mine instead and mmm, mmm, mmm! They got rave reviews from the guys in my household. One thing I'll probably do next time is make them bigger. Also, there's no way you could fit 24 in a 9x13 pan. I could only fit 8.

Absolutely great cinnamon buns!  Thanks to  RUBES1 for writing the instructions to make them by hand rather than a bread maker.  A little trick that my mother taught me about cutting the dough.  She uses a string to cut the dough.  Wrapping the string around the dough and crossing the string at the top, she pulls it tight until the dough is cut.

Oh my gosh!  These are to die for!!!  I made these for Sunday brunch tomorrow and I don't know how I will get my husband to leave them alone until then.  I made them exactly to the recipe, I used pecans but no raisins because I don't like them.  My only issue with this was getting them to rise.  I had them on the counter for over and hour and nothing happened.  Then I put them in a still warm oven and they began to rise.  It worked out in the end ok, except that the middles of the buns rose higher and are like a spiral now instead of a bun.  But it doesn't change the taste, and they taste unbelievable!  I'm thinking of whipping up a second batch right already.  Thanks so much for this keeper of a recipe!

These had good flavor but the dough was a bit dense and they didn't raise quite as much as I would have liked.  They dried out on my breakfast table, too.  I will try them again using less flour.  This many great reviews can't be wrong!

Don't change anything. Its perfect. These are just the best. They are easy to make; its just a lot of work, but well worth it. My husband is always pestering me for these, and when I oblige, he is sure to eat over half the pan alone.

These were pretty good.  They weren't as light of texture as I had hoped, they were a little heavy, but they were still enjoyed.  I did a cinnamon roll and a orange roll using the same dough.

This is the first recipe I've ever tried in a bread machine.  FANTASTIC!!  For a real treat, use the icing from the recipe called "Clone of a Cinnabon", also found on this website. You will need to double that topping recipe, you'll be glad you did!

I made the dough by hand and didn't need to use the full 4 cups of flour. I used a coconut cream pudding mix instead of the vanilla and replaced the vanilla extract in the frosting with almond extract, just for a different taste. The rolls were good, but they weren't perfect. Very easy and quick to make though. Thanks.

Totally love this recipe.  The best cinnamon roll recipe I've used.  Still having problems perfecting the frosting, but otherwise it is delicious, and stays soft for days if it lasts for days.

WOW!.  I made these for my neighbor and I don't even LIKE cinnamon buns, but these are hands down the best thing I've EVER tasted.  I seriously could eat the entire recipe myself.  My bread machine quit working so I followed the other member's recipe for making them by hand and doubled the filling and still dotted with butter, (VERY fattening but de-lish). You will love these, guarenteed.

OUTSTANDING!  I made a few other cinammon roll recipes that I thought were pretty good, but this one made the others pale in comparison...these were so good in fact, that my husband actually called two friends over to come try them!

I came across this recipe today, and boy am I glad I did. I have been making this recipe  for years, but I got it somewhere else, and I printed it several times in case I lost it. Now I can stick it in my recipe box here for safe keeping. This is the most fantastic recipe EVER!! These rolls are WAY better than Cinnabon in my opinion. The dough is so soft and delicious, and they just melt in your mouth. My kids are crazy over them!! You HAVE to try these!! and don't forget to SAVE IT!! :-)

These were fantastic!  They truly taste like a Cinnabon knock off.  I made them with all-purpose flour because I didn't have bread flour.  They were still very moist and chewy. YUM!!

**WOW!!**  These are just... wow!!  I left out the nuts and the raisins to suit my family's taste, though I'd really like to try this with them sometime.  They smelled like heaven baking and my husband and daughter kept hovering and asking when they'd be done until I iced them (I used the cream cheese icing).  In my opinion, this recipe was easier than the "Clone of a Cinnabon" from this site-- the dough was softer and better to work with.  After I got them iced and we started eating all you heard in our house was lots of happy "mmmmm" noises!  I've never had a "real" Cinnabon but I can't imagine they'd be any better than these!  I know I'll be making them again and again!

Excellent!!  These are by far the best cinnamon buns I have ever tasted!  The first time I made them they were too sweet for my taste so I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 3/4 cup and doubled the cinnamon to 4 teaspoons.  I also added 4 oz. cream cheese to the icing.  Pure heaven!!!

Recipe was easy to follow and they came out perfect. My mother has been begging me to make batch after batch as well as my husbands coworkers. They are best warm and reheat very easily in the microwave. They truly are soft moist and gooey liek the title states!!

Excellent cinnamon roll. I add 1 cup of sourdough starter and a smidge more flour to get a velvety texture. Then let it rise until doubled in a warm spot.  I too it with the bourbon cream cheese frosting found on AR.  What a hit on Christmas morning.

This recipe is (and I don't use this word often) AWESOME! These turned out to be MUCH better than store bought and maybe even better than Cinnabon!  My family LOVED them. This was a fairly easy recipe to make. I used a piece of dental floss to slice the buns as shown in the video which worked out great as using the knife smashed the dough. I also doubled the frosting. I am happy to say that I'm done looking for a good recipe for Cinnamon Buns....this recipe actually deserves more stars. Thank you so much FIONASMOM!

Amazing, moist, fluffy cinnamon rolls. I can't get enough of these things. 

I've made them a few times now and these are my changes: I one and a half the filling; I don't add nuts; I soak the raisins in boiling water and a splash of Grand Marnier (make sure you drain and pat dry); and my frosting is 2 bricks of softened cream cheese and 1 stick of softened butter (1/2 cup) whipped together, then add a tsp of vanilla, a splash of milk and just enough confectioners sugar to make it come together. 

These are even better the next day fried in a little butter. I fry the top, flip and frost the top while the bottom fries. Mmmm so amazing.

Rolls turned out perfect following directions (I used the bread machine). After reading reviews , I also added half to the filling ( so 1 1/2 c brown sugar, 3 t cinnamon, 3/4 c butter) and it turned out GREAT!

Absolutely delicious! Glad I took the time to make them. When I took the dough out of the bread machine, I knew they were going to be great. It was the most perfect dough I've ever made in there, it came out cleanly and was just perfect. It didn't even look like it had to be kneaded. I did anyway and followed your recipe to the letter. I will definitely make these again instead of buying store-bought cans!

Simply the best!  I tried this recipe first and then tried another and my husband said "did you change the recipe?  I liked the other ones better."  I hadn't told him what I had done, but made "his" cinnamon rolls the next day.  He doesn't say much other than this is good or not, but for him to notice, I knew these were a keeper.

I followed the recipe as it was and my cinnamon rolls turned out beautiful! I took the tip from another review saying to use dental floss to cut the rolls and let me tell you, that was the easiest time I have ever had making cinnamon rolls. This is now my go to recipe!!! Love love love it!

UPDATE: after making these many times my favorite way is to make the the rolls and then place them in the fridge over night for their final rise cycle. They rise perfectly and then just pre heat and pop them in the oven the next morning. These rolls are so good most of the time I don't even make the icing and they are still gooey and delicious.

This is most of ever soft dough that I made in my life !! Thank you so much for show to this recipe. I was very worried before make these amount of ingredients.
Because I just got new Bread Machine from Japan. It calls "GOPAN". I am not familiar with this new machine. But I tried anyways.
This recipe 24 pieces too much for our 3 family member. So I cut half amount of ingredients for 12 pieces.
New machine made dough very nicely came up with this recipe . I am so happy !! I like icing with Cream Cheese. So I changed. Everything so good and soft that I loved !!
Thank you Thank you !!!!!!!

These were super yummy. The recipe came together great. I would have liked to have a more gooey roll. Next time I will rub the butter onto the dough and then sprinkle the sugar on top. This was a great recipe!

This recipe is absolutely amazing.  It's time consuming, yes, but worth every last minute.  I added 1/2 cup of white sugar to the cinnamon and brown sugar just to give a little contrast.  This is by far, the best cinnamon roll I've ever had.

tried these today. The dough was a nightmare to handle after getting it out the breadmaker, buns were messy! and not fluffy or very nice to eat at all.  Thought they would be decent buns to try after reading all the other rave reviews - won't be doing these again!!!!

Wow! Best cinnamon bun I've ever eaten! Crispy outside, soft inside. I increased the cinnamon to 1 tbsp. I used 3/4 cup soft butter spread on the dough and 1 cup brown sugar, the cinnamon and raisins  sprinkled over the butter. I rolled the dough on an oiled surface, this stopped it from sticking to the counter. I will set the oven to 200F next time and do the second rise in the oven with a bit of heat. Mine didn't rise at first, so I turned on the oven, but it was a bit hot I think. They were seriously excellent!!!!! A keeper for sure! Easy and delicious. Thanks Tania!

Loved this recipe!! I did it in the bread maker and WOW! a lot less trouble than making by hand. I did however changed the filling by using 2 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon ( I love cinnamon!! ) instead 2 tsp. and in the icing I used 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of soft cream cheese instead of the 4 tablespoons of butter. They were a great hit with the family. thanks!

These are awesome! I followed Rubes directions for making in a mixer and they turned out perfect. I froze half of the dough after rolling and cutting before rising so I have more to enjoy this week with my coffee. YUM!

This recipe was very easy to make, and the results were fabulous.  They most definitely are better warmed, although both ways taste great.

I had said to my husband "Someone has made these three times!" Thinking that is very unhealthy. Well I am about to make them for the fourth time in 3 weeks! Everyone loves them, and my mom just asked me to make a bunch, can't say no so close to mothers day!

Excellent. I followed the instructions exactly and they were perfect. I did skip the icing and made a cream cheese cinnamon bun icing instead. These were gone in minutes! (One seven year old, two six years old, and one three year old). Mom and Dad only got a few bites in! Had to make another batch that same evening!

As a true Cinnabon lover, these blow them out of the water! Cooks perfectly and the dough is so light fluffy. Don't squish them all into one big pan though. I separated mine into several glass baking dishes due to rising.  One note - I definitely prefer about 1 1/2 times the "Clone of a Cinnabon" cream-cheese icing smothered on top.

These rolls were fabulous and got a gooey thumbs up from my kids.  I thought I had messed them up because my dough machine pan did not lock in place.  When the dough cycle had completely finished, I looked inside and nothing had mixed.  I emptied the entire contents in to my kitchen aid, mixed the dough and let it rise.  I then followed the remaining directions.  Let the rolls rise, put them  in the fridge overnight, and the next AM popped them in the oven.    Wonderful!

These are delicious, Thank you so much Fionasmom.   The only things I did different was to use Pine nuts instead of Walnuts.  I also added coconut to the brown sugar spread, and sub'd white chocolate and other puddings for the Vanilla.  What a versatile recipe this is.  If your a chocolate lover, use Cocoa instead  of the pudding but add a bit more, then add chocolate chips to the filling.  Beware, I didn't get to try these, my daughter took them to school!

This recipe was great!  I was looking for an easy, soft and sweet cinnamon roll and I found it.  To make it with extra filling, I rolled it out into a large, thin rectangle, put filling on half, folded it over, put more filling on new side, and then rolled and cut.  It was extra yummy, with the sugar/butter filling carmelizing in the pan.  I use my bread maker all the time, but have a hard time finding good, homemade bread recipes to make in the bread maker.  This serves the bill!

These are the best cinnamon buns, I made them for Christmas morning and my whole family went crazy over them!  I did double the amount of cinnamon because we love our cinnamon and I made a cream cheese icing for the top of the buns...yummy!  I felt like I was eating a real Cinnabon cinnamon roll!  Thank you for the great recipe!  A new Christmas tradition for our family!

GREAT RECIPE! 1/2 the recipe fit perfectly in a 9X9 baking pan. Used butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla. added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough and added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the filling. My husband and I inhaled the whole pan in just  a few days! Will have to try cream cheese frosting next time!

These were fantastic and super easy to make!  I have never had good luck making cinnamon roll dough in my bread machine, but this is the ticket!  They are soft, tender, and dee-lish!  They rose over the sides of the pan!  All I had was a 1 oz. box of sugar free vanilla pudding, but it worked out wonderfully!

These were the best cinnamon rolls I've made to date. It was a little hard to work with, though, because I didn't use the full 4 cups of flour. Also, I used a combination of cake and bread flour. I find that that gives it a much lighter texture.

Excellent! tasty, need I say more. The buns were very good, got some good feedback. I doubled the required amount  of cinnamon to 4tsp, cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cups and added 2tbsp white sugar to flour mixture. For the icing I mixed 3oz cream cheese, 2 tbsp milk and a few tbstsp of powder sugar. The icing is more cream cheesy than sweet. Its was a good compliment. This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe deserves a 10! No need to change recipe perfect the way it is. My bread machine did all the work except for the final rising of the rolls. Came out perfect. Will definately make again very soon, no more store bought for me.

Beware of this recipe! You'll gain weight just thinking about its wonderfulness!! I just found this recipe, and I have to say it's awesome! I didn't have to taste it to recognize how much the vanilla pudding mix would make it soft, moist and wonderful to eat.  I make the dough the night before, adding the walnuts and raisins, of course. I put it in the fridge and take it out the next morning, allowing it to rise. For the frosting, I put a little lemon zest in it.   Then I put a pot of coffee on and wait for the praise!

Wonderful....used my bread machine and they were a HIT!  They were really light.  Pretty much made as directed, but for the filling I used both brown and white sugar, butter and cinnamon.  I don't measure, just spread until I think I have enough.
I didn't use the frosting....The best frosting is the one used for the clone a cinnabon.  Will make these many times I'm sure.  May be the best recipe I've tried from this site.

These are the best!  The only changes I made was to use the entire box of instant pudding (what was I going to do with the other half, anyway?). And I used the frosting from the recipe of clone of a cinnabon like somebody else suggested.  It made enough to fill up a 9x13 pan and an 8x8 pan. The filling was delicious and what a great idea to mix everything all together before spreading it on the dough! The family loved it and it will become the new cinnamon roll recipe that I will use from now on.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made these twice now and my family LOVES them!  I didn't add the icing because my family prefers cinnamon buns without icing, but I made the dough in the bread machine and they have turned out awesome both times.  This is definitely the new family favourite.

I have been making a family favorite recipe for cinnamon rolls for years...until now.  I don't know what the secret is, probably the vanilla pudding, but these are so wonderful I can't think of anything else.  I'm restraining myself from making more, because I know I'll just eat them all myself.

I added cream cheese to my frosting, and used pecans.  YUMMY!

These are THE BEST homemade cinnamon rolls I've ever made. I like them even more than the ones my mother made for me when I was little. You HAVE to try this recipe! And I, too, didn't pay attention to the "1/2 box" part and used a whole box, and they turned out great.

So, so good. I omited the pudding mix, and as always the walnuts and raisins. Also, I made slighhhly more frosting(I know, its awful!) Other than that I followed the directions and they turned out great. So good warm, but after also they sat a while all the icing that had run to the bottom soaked into the buns and it was amazing. Made about 15-18 buns. Definatly worth the work!

FABULOUS! I made these exactly by the recipe. I thought the brown sugar mixture was hard to spread onto the dough, plus it was a bit grainy in the finished rolls. Next time, I will try cooking the brown sugar and butter until the sugar dissolves. That will make it easier to spread also. DH thought they needed more cinnamon, but he likes LOTS of cinnamon. After the rolls cooled, I wrapped them in plastic wrap and they are still soft today. I'll definitely be making these again! Thanks! Follow-up: Cooking the brown sugar and butter together definitely worked better -- created a less grainy filling. I made two batches last night for work today and they disappeared quickly!

The cinnamon buns were delicious! With their gooey center and delicious icing, they turned out perfect. I placed them in my covered pedestal cake dish, and they make a gorgeous center piece. I'll be sure to make these for guests. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe has taken over as the ONLY Cinnamon Bun recipe I now use!  Make sure not to leave out the pudding mix - it makes a difference in the flavor.  I use my bread machine to mix the dough, so it is a very easy, delicious treat.
Thank you.

We thought these were fairly average.  They weren't bad, but there are better ones out there--I will continue my quest!  The dough handled very nicley, and I ended up with 24.  It seems like they need more cinnamon.  I divided the dough in half and rolled each half into a 10x12 rectangle.  After rolling up, I cut the roll in half, then cut each half in half, then each piece into 3 rolls.  This way, you end up with 12 rolls of the same size.  Repeat with other half of dough.  They fit perfectly on a 10x15 baking sheet.

My very first time at making cinnamon buns and it was a hit!  I was a little scared by the part that said you have to knead it once it comes out of the bread machine, as I am very new to working with dough, but I set the timer while I kneaded and it turned out fine.  The only "problem" I had was that I had too many cinammon rolls to fit in the pan (I used a Pampered Chef pan).  I tried to squeeze them all in there anyway, and they were a little squished but still tasted very good.  Some of the squished ones were almost not cooked enough in the middle (and I cooked for 20 minutes since I was using stoneware).  Next time I will either make them bigger or use a bigger pan.  I also used the frosting recipe from Clone of a Cinnabon, rather than the glaze in this recipe.  That frosting is very good, but these buns are so good that they almost didn't need all that frosting, so next time I am going to stick to the entire recipe and use the glaze that comes with it.  I highly recommend this recipe, and for those of you who are scared of working with dough like I am, try this recipe, I found it very forgiving and easy to work with.  A+++++++

I made these today.  I had a hard time rolling up the dough with the soft butter and sugar mixture, it kept oozing out the ends and in front of the roll, but I managed ok.  They are great cinnamon rolls.

Definitely the ultimate cinnamon buns, sooo yummy!  The only thing I change is to use a cream cheese icing instead.  Everyone raves about these.  This was the first recipe I tried with all recipes and it got me coming back for more.  Thankyou!

This is going to become my new favorite cinnamon roll bread!  Not only is it easy--worked perfectly in my bread machine, and the dough was nice to handle--it is moist and tastes FABULOUS!  I'm going to have to be careful how often I make these--WOW!  I'm looking forward to trying the different add-ins (raisins, nuts--I may even try adding apples to the filling, or using applesauce or apple butter to make a lower fat filling).

Wonderful recipe, after enjoying a few, we covered them and they kept pretty moist in the fridge. Nuke them and they get their moisture back from being in the fridge. Very addictive treat!

These are great cinnamon rolls, better than my moms, but please don't tell her;) I don't have a bread machine, so I followed the suggestions on the back of the yeast packet, then mixied with my stand mixer.  The dry pudding mix really makes the bread moist, even the next day and the next day if they last that long.  My husband took a dozen of these to work, told 4 people, and they were gone in, like, 4 mins, litterally.  All I have left to say is THANK YOU, TANIA

This is the best cinnamon roll recipe ever!  I don't have a bread machine, however I just use the bread hook on my mixer and it does the same job!  This has become a regular request for repeat company and of coarse my family!

These are the best cinnamon buns ever!  And so easy -- when I discovered that the yeast I used had expired (over a year earlier) I thought I'd have to throw it all away. Nope! My family was fighting over these soft, melt-in-your-mouth treasures. I can't imagine what they'll taste like with fresh yeast! I used 2 tablespoons of cinnamon instead of 2 teaspoons, added 4 ounces of cream cheese to the icing and got rid of the milk. Unbelievable! Thank you so much for a recipe that is sure to become a family heirloom!

I was amazed at how easy these cinnamon buns are to make and how delicious they are.  If you want a "bakery style" cinnamon bun, this is the recipe you want to use.  My mother, who was a bread baker in a school cafeteria, says these are the best cinnamon buns she has ever tasted!

These are very good! I used the whole box of pudding mix, otherwise did not change anything. They seem to stay fresher longer than other cinnamon rools.

I made these Christmas morning and they were a big hit. I left out rasins and used pecans instead of walnuts. Now I have a new Christmas tradition.

Very yummy! I actually love these better than Cinnabon.  My family loves them. I make them once a year at Christmas time, and people rave about it every time.  I do recommend the cream cheese icing as opposed to the icing in this recipe.  It is definitely more rich, but not as sweet.  Actually the rolls taste good without the icing too.

These are great,the vanilla pudding is what makes the recipe.However each time I've made these I can't seem to incorporate all the flour into the dough,I always have a cup left over,no big deal though.I plan on making these again and again.

GREAT Recipe. Everyone loved them and wants them every Sunday for Breakfast. Pretty easy and the machine does most of the work. Tried many recipes to copy my grandmother's great cinnamon rolls. I think I have found the one recipe. They really are Yummy. Give this one a try.

These are THE BEST cinnamon buns ever.  I've made them for a few years now.  When I included this recipe in a local community cookbook, I was told, "It was worth buying the cookbook for this recipe alone."  The only changes I make are to add 4 oz of softened cream cheese and 2 Tbsp of maple syrup to the frosting.  Mmmmmmmm!!

I wasn't disappointed, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for.  The pudding in the dough threw me off a little, I think.  I tend to want a little more cinnamon flavor instead of vanilla, but I think that's just preference.  A good recipe.

This will now be my go to cinnamon bun recipe. They were easy to make and tasted fantastic. My wife made her own cream cheese that improved an already great recipe. Brought some to my daughter and son-in-law and they loved them too. Couldn't wait so they ate them before dinner.

Fabulous in every way! Followed the recipe exactly for the ingredients.  When they came out of the oven, I flipped them onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet and let all the delicious filling seep back into the rolls while I baked them for 3 minutes more.  Once done, I put them back into my 9x13, cooled them til they were warm but not hot, and then frosted them. Perfection.

Wanna little twist? ( Add 1 small tub of Cool Whip into the frosting, it'll give you a light and airy taste you just must try!

Love this recipe the key is you must use bread flour and bread machine yeast makes big difference!  I baked them about 5 minutes longer with aluminum foil this way they cook all the way without browning too much. Just made a batch today their gone now

Turned out well but needed to add a lot more milk to the icing. Without the extra milk, it was the same consistency of dough.

Fabulous, my husband is from PA and loves cinnamon and Sticky Buns. Was happy to find a bread machine recipe that made it easy to make.
It was so good that I had to freeze half so my husband wouldn’t eat it all. We had the frozen half for breakfast and they tasted just as good as fresh.??

This is the best recipe I’ve ever seen! When I made it, they were gone in ten minutes tops. Every time I bring some for my friends they ask me what brand of dough I bought, but they don’t believe me when I say I found the recipe online. Best recipe ever and I have used it a million times!

Some of the buns were still raw after baking for the full 20 minutes.  Next time, I would increase the baking time to at least 25-30 minutes.  The buns that were fully cooked, though, were really delicious.  I would give this another try, but I would definitely increase the baking time.

Perfect C'Rolls!!  I used the entire package of Vanilla pudding and I did not knead my second batch.  After kneading the first batch and they didn't rise well, I chose to skip this step on my second batch.  Both batches had amazing taste but the second batch did rise better.  Used one batch as a Dirty Santa gift and gave the other as a Christmas Gift.  Both recipients were thrilled!!

I've made these rolls so many times now I've memorized the recipe. I make it with caramel extract instead of vanilla, and give it a more salty sweet flavor I add another 1/2 teaspoon salt in the brown sugar cinnamon mixture. That way it doesn't effect the rise.  In dry months, I place a small bread dish in the bottom of the oven with about a half cup water when I start preheating and leave it there through the the bake. The steam keeps them moist.

Good Morning These are the easiest cinnamon rolls I have ever made. Not having bread flour I added 1 T gluten flour for each cup of flour in the recipe per info I looked up. Omitted the raisins added pecans  Love the way you mix the butter sugar and cinnamon together. Taking theses to fellowship this evening per request. I cook and bake quite a bit and wanted to try these out. O by the way I only had Cook N Serve pudding mix and used 3 heaping tablespoons and it work out just fine .. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe

There's a problem with this recipe. The ingredients list calls for 1 tsp. of milk but the video shows 1 cup of milk! It definitely should be a cup. I tried to make the recipe and, when I opened my bread maker, there was just a pile of dry stuff, not dough. :-(

Theses were amazing!  I didn't use the bread machine to make dough, and my yeast wasn't fast acting so it took a bit for them to rise.  But OMG are they wonderful!   Definitely will make them again.

These turned out just "ok". The icing needed a lot more than 1tsp of milk, and even at cooking for 22 minutes, they were still underdone.  Not sure if I used the right yeast. I used quick rise yeast, which is what I use in the bread maker. Would be nice to have an approximate time for "doubling in size".

I omitted the nuts but made the rest as written. I'm going to have to change the house favorite from "clone of a Cinnabon " to these. They were excellent. I mad with night before and followed a previous reviewer about placing them in the 200 degree oven after it had been turned off with the warm towel over top of the rolls for 30 minutes and then baked for 20 minutes. They were awesome and thoroughly cooked. These were awesome!

I followed  the recipe for using kitchen aid. Put 1 packet yeast, water and sugar in (heated microwave for 1 minute) for 15 minutes. Combined rest of wet ingredients and added yeast mixture. Added flour mixture (flour, salt and pudding powder) slowly using dough hook. Proofed in oven heated to 200 and shut off. I went shy on 1/2 cp butter. Next time I would add another shy tsp cinnamon and more pecans. Try to roll dough out thinner. Baked 8 rolls in 9x13 for 25 minutes...perfect. Used cream cheese and butter in frosting.

Oh my goodness! These are phenomenal. I didn't make any changes to the cinnamon rolls themselves, and the dough came out perfect. Not sticky and easy to work with. It had good elasticity and you could tell even before you cooked the cinnamon rolls that they were going to be great. I did change up the topping... I used the cream cheese topping from the Cinnabon clone recipe because we like that flavor. A hit with the whole family!

Amazing recipe. I think what sets this recipe aside others is the pudding. Makes for a very moist dough. Will def be making this every few weeks.

Fantastic!  So soft, moist and delicious.  They are definitely as the name says, and not uncooked in the middle as some people seem to think.  I baked them for the 20 minutes and they are definitely done; they're hollow sounding when you tap the tops, and when you cut through them the dough is completely baked throughout.  Soooooo good!

I've made this recipe several times, it's my favorite by far. I don't use the bread machine just mix them together by hand or with mixer. I bake the whole batch and then (If there are any left)  wrap them individually in plastic wrap and freeze them. Pop them in the fridge to thaw or just put them in the microwave for a few seconds and they are good as new. Yummy!! My only change is putting cream cheese frosting on them as it is my favorite.

Easily made without a bread machine. If you've got a stand mixer, a bread hook and time to proof, you'll be fine.

I made these without a bread machine and with a few other modifications, and they're the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! Instead of the frosting listed in the recipe, try 4 oz of softened butter, 4 oz of softened cream cheese, 8 oz of powdered sugar, 1/4 tsp of lemon juice, and 1-1/2 tsp of vanilla extract creamed together for 10 minutes. Spread that on the moment they're out of the oven, then cook them for another 2-3 minutes. Make sure to grease your pan with actual butter, too! 
These are even better if you slice the rolls, place them in the pan, cover it with plastic wrap and let them rise in the fridge overnight.

This is the perfect recipe for cinnamon buns! It can't get any flakier or softer than this I swear. The toughest part is rolling the brown sugar covered dough and cutting it because it's so soft and a bit difficult to cut evenly. It gets very messy! But besides this, every bite is so amazing. I feel like the amount of brown sugar mixture and sugar icing is a bit excessive I've never used all of it.

I'm not a huge baking expert but after some research while looking for cookie recipes I found that having all the ingredients at room temperature really does help. Also please use freshly bought packets of yeast!! I use red star yeast. Just be patient with the prep of your ingredients as they to into the mixer. You'll know it'll be a perfect batch if the dough comes out high risen in your machine :) after that it's smooth sailing!

This recipe is THE BOMB!  I follow it as written, using a Cuisinart bread machine and putting in liquid ingredients first.  As a rule when making breads, all my ingredients are room temperature.  All-purpose flour works just as well if you don't have bread flour on hand, and makes it super soft.  I cut the log into 16 pieces and use a large baking pan, just so we can all have seconds---but who am I kidding, I usually end up making two batches!  My entire family loves this recipe.

These are so amazingly soft and gooey! The only thing that was a drawback for me was the sweetness. Next time I would reduce the amount of brown sugar, and skip the icing. That's just personal taste though. These are perfect cinnamon buns if you really love a Cinnabon experience.

These are the best! I make the dough in my bread machine. No fuss. When the machine is done, I turn my oven to 'warm'. Roll the dough, fill, roll, cut &'into the pan. Turn off the oven. Insert the rolls. Proofed in about 20 min. They are a perfect late night snack when company comes to play cards
Sept 2016. I am still making these! They are so good.  Have never had a complaint only requests. Delicious. Highly worth the effort to give them a try

Sarah Jo was right about the frosting, I measured 10 teaspoons of milk to get a thick icing.  This is my 2nd batch of these buns, and I didn't have the pudding mix the first time. They came out of the oven and were devoured by my kids and husband before I could even get the icing made so I didn't bother. They said "don't change anything!!", so since I'm here alone, I'm gonna frost them. Thanks for sharing!!

I have been making cinnamon rolls for years using various sweet dough recipes,  including  a Amish recipe. This one is by far my favorite one now for the sweet dough.  I am partial to the way I make the cinnamon middle so, I cannot comment on the entire recipe. My family LOVED them! Thank you for a wonderful sweet dough recipe that I will be sharing and making often!

So good! My whole family swears that these are way better than Cinnabon. I didn't think that was possible. I made a few changes based on reviews such as not adding as much brown sugar and adding more cinnamon. I also used half regular milk half buttermilk and did not knead the dough more after the machine was done, instead I let it rest for about 10 mins before I rolled it. I also added 3 oz of softened cream cheese to the frosting. With those small changes, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This recipe was very delicious and easy to follow directions.  I used my breadmaker and prepared everything the night before.  I put the sliced buns in the pan, covered with saran wrap and put them in the refrigerator overnight.  In the morning, I pulled them out and let them rise while getting ready for work.  When putting the frosting on it was a little thick so I just added a little more milk to thin it out.  Took them to work still warm and received RAVE reviews.  Great recipe that will get made over and over again!

5 stars all the way!  I cut this recipe in half and was able to get 12 medium sized rolls that fit perfectly in a 13x9 baking dish.  I thought the amount of filling was perfect and the frosting was a nice accompaniment to the rolls.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, FIONASMOM!  It's a keeper!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I followed RUBES1 instructions for a mixer and omitted the raisins and only used walnuts and I honestly cannot believe how good they came out. Very moist and just the right amount of sweet. I am very pleased. This is the BEST cinnamon roll recipe out there.  If you are looking for a delicious moist recipe, stop here. You found it, happy baking!

Well as you can see by my picture mine did not turn out at all like the photo on this recipe, mine did not rise at all, I think because I used regular yeast and not bread machine yeast? The taste is there but they were not moist and the sugar sticks to the bottom making them crunchy I hope it was just the yeast cuz it is a lot of work so I will try them again. The icing is amazing!!! I used the thread technique to cut them it works perfectly!

It tasted great very moist flavoursome and yuuummm.
However when cutting it and placing it in the baking dish I lost lots of the fillings it kept falling off 
I'm not sure what would be the best way to avoid this. It didn't make a lot considering it was 4 cups of flour maybe it is because we have to roll it before it doubles in size.
The sauce didn't turn out to be the same as I did it with no measurements. ..

Delicious! Everyone loved these. My only problem was that the cinnamon mixture partially melted off of the dough, so it was basically a sweet bun. It was still good, I will try these again.

I made these buns according to the stand mixer recipe the first couple of times. The buns were great but there was not enough cinnamon for our taste. I tried them again but used all purpose flour (thats what I had on hand) instead of bread flour and increased the cinnamon to 1 heaping tbls. The buns where a little softer and lighter and the cinnamon was perfect for us. Im going to make a few adjustments and try making savory garlic cheese buns or maybe even pizza buns.

Successfully made this recipe without a bread machine. Used butterscotch flavored pudding mix (it was all I had in the pantry) and kneaded all ingredients by hand. I was determined not to tweak the recipe too much, but had to use half cup more flour because the dough ended up being very sticky for hand kneading. Still, five star results!!! Thank you for this recipe. Will definitely make it again in the future.

absolutely the best bread machine cinnamon rolls/buns I have ever tasted or made. I only bake for 15 min. max because they taste much better when they come out of the oven a little less baked. Makes them much more gooey.

Fabulous! I used 1/2 pack of cook and serve vanilla pudding instead of specifically instant and it worked well. I also proofed yeast 1/2 the milk and sugar for 15 minutes. Then added the other wet ingredients and mixed in dry. I kneaded until smooth then let rise for 45 minutes. I then followed the rest of the directions cut at 1 inch intervals (this made 14 buns) I wish I would hve doubled the filling to get more ooey gooiness but still great. I placed my rols in 2 rows in 8x8 pans this let them rise until nice and big. Cooked for 15 minutes and the were perfect not raw in the middle. They do taste a lot like Cinnabon (that's where I think more filling would make it closer)I made a cream cheese frosting (2 cups confectioners sugar 1 stick butter and 8oz cream cheese with a dash of vanilla) for top. These are wonderful!

Not the greatest cinnamon roll. It did not taste like the home made cinnamon rolls I remember eating as a child.  I gave it three stars because it is not inedible, but it does not taste like a cinnamon roll.  I highly doubt it was because I used cheesecake pudding mix instead. The taste reminded me of a cheese danish but the filling was horrible. There was no gooeyness at all. What filling there was cooked to the bottom and didnt stay inside the cinnamon roll, also wasn't enough cinnamon.  I had to increase the baking time as well.

I did these and they came out amazing! My husband and brother said it was like Cinnabon Rolls. And My husband said they were even good the next day cold which is practically an impossibility with cinnamon rolls. Excellent recipe. I think I will use this same basic recipe for a savory version with garlic and parmesan instead of cinnamon and sugar.

I thought these were perfect.  They turned out more soft and tender than the clone of cinnabon, just enough density and gooey perfection.

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made in my life! They are soft and gooey but not raw. They taste like something that you would buy in a bakery. I have made the clone of a cinnabon recipe and this one is defintely better. I did use cream cheese icing. To make it I just added 4 oz of cream cheese to this icing. Yum, yum, yum!!! I would give this 10 stars if I could!

Turned out excellent even though I missed the 4 tbs melted butter. I didn't even realize I had missed an ingredient until many hours later. This is by far the only cinnamon bun recipe I will ever use.

I would give this 10 stars if i could!!! I was looking for a bun that wouldnt become hard after it cooled. i used cream cheese icing instead of the butter icing and people couldnt resist eating them right out of the oven (burning their mouths in the process lol. Great recipe!!!

I just finish making these cinnamon buns and they are great.  I did make a few changes to the recipe. Instead of 4 cps of flour I used 3 cps of white flour and 3/4 cp of wheat flour and a 1/4 cp of wheat germ. I also substituted the vanilla pudding with a 1/2 cp of applesauce.  The buns came out sweet and chewy.

Great recipe.  I made 2 changes to the recipe to make it non-dairy: used vanilla soy milk in place of milk and margarine in place of butter.  Cinnamon rolls were very yummy, will definitely make again!

These were good...in fact, everyone loved them....except me.  I would like a little more cinnamon taste and maybe more filling.  I will definitely make these again but I think I'll try adding a dash of cinnamon into the bread mixture and maybe double the filling.  A great, soft and gooey bun and really worth trying!

These have a nice flavor but I personally think that they are a bit TOO gooey, kind of doughey.  I haven't tried it yet but I wonder if I'd like them better without the vanilla pudding mix.

Very easy, and delicious, however, I had to almost quadruple the amount of icing needed, and they weren't quite cinnamon-y enough or gooey enough for my taste. But still, they were pretty yummy!

I made these for my twins Sweet 16 birtday and they were amazing! I loved the ease of making them in the bread machine and the dough was so easy to work with.  I used a cream cheese frosting and cooked them only 14 minutes. I made 12 in the 8x13 pan and made 5 more in a smaller pan to freeze.  Try them!

I plan on making these buns with this Sunday's breakfast, Yesterday I went to purchase a bread machine but the sales girl assured me that it wasn't necessary that I could mix the ingredients by hand, several other reviews basically stated the same...so I can't wait to try them....

Made 6 servings to equal out 4 larger cinnamon buns. Easy and delicous. I did add water and corn syrup to the frosting. Originally, the frosting was crumbly and I wanted a glze texture that would harden once cooled. Really tasty.

I thought these cinnamon rolls tasted really good ... but I'm not sure they're worth getting up so early to put the dough on.  I plan to see if there's a good overnight cinnamon roll recipe.    I would have appreciated knowing how sticky the dough would be coming out.  I had sprinkled a bit of flour down but it needed a lot more.  Overall, a good recipe ... just time consuming.

Love them thanks. This will replace my old cinnamon roll recipe that I have been using for 11 years. These are so good. What I like the best is the bun itself is so soft. A little sweet if anything, but that can be adjusted. Thanks for a great recipe.

Turned out great! They were wonderful, I followed the recipe exactly. Here's a tip for other novice cooks though. Be careful if you roll them out on wax paper. The dough stuck to the wax paper, and I mean really STUCK! It took me forever to get all the paper off.

I followed this recipe exactly as written except I used frosting from clone of a cinnabon (wonderful frosting) this recipe was good but I dont think it is as good as cinnabon, it was soft but not very gooey, maybe next time I'll add extra brown sugar & cinnamon. An over all good recipe but doesn't have that wow factor

this is a great recipe! i've never made C-buns before, but will definitely make again. ours didn't rise (or not noticeably) but that didn't change much apparently. the goo didn't present a problem like it did w/ other reviewers either. i did deviate from the recipe a bit by using 1tbsp honey instead of sugar for dough (might have prevented substantial rising). next time i'll try some splenda instead of br. sugar and more cinnamon for the filling. also, i'll use my kitchen aid w/ dough hook since my bread machine's blade had issues kneading the dough once it got tougher. also, my sugar dressing consisted only of a bit of milk and confectioner's sugar, so that it's not too heavy and just gives a light sweetness. might try one of the cream cheese recipes in the future. definitely a keeper recipe!!!

These were really good!!!! The only problem with mine was that they didn't rise. So they were kind of dense. But they were REALLY good!!! I will make them again.  PS-The amount of milk for the icing is way off. It says 1 tsp, but you need more than that. I didn't really measure how much I put in. I just added milk til it was the right consistency.

Great recipe! I did make cream cheese frosting instead of the plain vanilla frosting.  Also, I made 1 1/2 times the filling after reading the other reviews, but it still could have used some more.  Next time, I think I will double the filling.  I felt that if you are looking for a recipe exactly like Cinnabon, the dough is not quite it, but they are still very good, just not Cinnabon good.

This recipe is great!  The dough makes rolls with perfect texture and sweetness and it seems to be a fool-proof recipe.  I make the recipe with no changes other than using part whole wheat flour in the recipe, since we do most of our baking with whole wheat.

OMG! These are sooo good! I wasn't doing so well with bread in my bread maker but these turned out great. I've already made 2 batches in a week and will be making 3 more tomorrow for my husband to take to work. You can't go wrong with this one it's too easy. I follow the recipe except for leaving out the raisins and nuts.

These are very good!! The only thing I regret-and this has nothing to do with the recipe itself-is that I read someone's comment saying to use the glaze from 'Clone of a Cinnabon' and decided to try it. I did not like them with that glaze. The cream cheese was too much. I will say that I am a bit unsure if I put the right amount of pudding mix into the dough. Is it supposed to be 3.5 oz. of mix or half of that?

Very delicious.  I did not add the nuts and I doubled the cinnamon mixture for the middle.  The icing is perfect.

I thought these were just "ok" out of the oven.  I packed them up and took them to work (still warm) and they were so much better.  I don't know if it was that they were softer from being packed up warm?  They were a hit at work everyone loved them.  I did use a cream cheese frosting instead of the one in the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellant rolls. My oldest son loved these and is requesting his own personal batch that he doesn't have to share. I have made LOTS of cinnamon rolls and these are definately the best.

Excellent buns!  The best that I have ever made!  They were very moist and by mixing the cinnamon, brown sugar and butter for the filling, it seemed to make the filling stay put.  Much better than sprinkling it as I had previously done.  Amazing results when baked in a Pampered Chef dish, too.  Highly recommended if you don't already use one.

tasty morsels! I too had to make them by hand and felt it needed more flour. Close to 5 1/2cups total. No problem with the second rising.  My kids wolfed them down! I had to tell my son one was enough.  I hope they are still good tomorrow.

OH MY GOSH!  I have been looking for a recipe like this for years but have never been able to find anything as good as this.  I doubled the cream cheese icing b/c my husband loves lots of icing.  Other than that, this recipe is perfect.  Very moist and gooey, just like the title says.  My mother in law even asked for the recipe!

Very good.  Simple, tasty, and makes just enough so you won't get totally fat :-)  Used about 1/2 cup raisins, no nuts.  Icing is very simple and tasty, sweet.  These are a lot like what you get from Cinnabon or similar food court places.  The dog stole a bun that my mother left at her (the dog's) height - and she hardly ever touches food we leave around, she knows she's not supposed to, but it must have been irresistable....

I love this recipe and so does everyone who tries it. I've made this a few times with chocolate spread filling instead of cinnamon and was great. I also joined the buns and made one cake which looks and tastes perfect.

Overall, these were very good with some minor adjustments. I recommend doubling the filling ingredients and not even frosting them. I tried them with raisins and will omit them next time. The pudding mix really adds moistness, I think. Even in Tupperware, these did not keep more than four or five days. I will be making these again-they were very good, and the dough came out perfectly in the bread machine! Thanks for sharing.

Superb recipe!!! I did this dairy-free. I just substituted vanilla soy milk for the milk and margarine for the butter. I didn't have vanilla pudding, so I used butterscotch (dairy-free) pudding mix. The result was fabulous! Would do this again anytime. The bread machine made it a breeze.

I'd love to be able to give this recipe 10 stars!! SOOO moist and delicious. I didn't have any vanilla pudding mix so I substituted caramel instead. Turned the dough a butterscotch colour and had an excellent flavour. A HUGE hit with everyone. My husband immediately wanted to take one to his mother to taste. Next time I will try a cream cheese icing....and believe me there WILL be a next time!:)

These rolls are so yummy!!  Definitly very soft and moist.  I made them twice, once with the buttercream frosting and once with cream cheese frosting.  I thought the buttercream frosting was too sweet on the rolls, but my husband loved it.  I prefered the cream cheese frosting, I thought it was a good complement to the sweetness of the rolls.  I do not have a breadmaker, so I used the instructions someone else gave for making them with my stand mixer.  I did add more cinnamon to the filling, 2 tablespoons I think.  I will definitly be making these again!

These things were huuuge. Did not yield 2 dozen. Mine made a dozen buns. I thought these were pretty good though. My husband kept making comments that I was in the kitchen a long time. So I give it four stars for being a bit time consuming, but other than that it would've been a five-star for taste, texture, etc. All-around good cinnamon rolls. We froze our batch and then defrosted them in the microwave. Even my pickiest husband in the entire world liked these and of course the kids couldn't get enough. A+!

EXCELLENT!!  I can't believe I can make these!  The bread machine made it SO easy! Used 4 oz of cream cheese in frosting.  YOU HAVE TO TRY THESE!  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!

These are so good!!!!!!! They were easy to make and fluffed up beautifully! I did not change anything to the cinnamon bun recipe, but added some creamcheese to the icing. Turned out perfectly! I will be making these over and over again!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

These are really great.  Gooey and sweet.  My family loves them - they have become a traditional birthday breakfast at our house.

These turned out really good considering it was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls.  I over-cooked them by about 7 or 8 minutes because the outside rolls were a little too brown.  I doubled the icing and got about 16 good size rolls. I did leave out the raisins and went easy on the nuts since my son isn't crazy about them.  The dough was fun to work with and I love the fact that I could make this using my bread machine.  Definitely a great "beginner" recipe.  Thanks Tania.
