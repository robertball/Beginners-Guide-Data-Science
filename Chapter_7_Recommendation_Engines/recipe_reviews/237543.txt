I did brown the sausage (kielbasa) in a separate pan, along with a finely chopped, small onion, while the beans started to cook in chicken stock and a little water.  Then added the beans to the sausage and let it finish cooking together.  Good, if a little plain.  Not as spicy as I thought it would be from the red pepper.  Easy enough and tasty.  Our family has made a similar dish for a long time, but with sauerkraut and without the red pepper.
