I hate when people say they followed a recipe but changed literally everything about it, and give a 5 star rating when the rating rates a recipe they didn't follow - at all. That being said, I actually followed the recipe, word for word and by exact measurements. It was great. Super easy.

I followed this recipe loosely because I didn’t need quite that much.  I cut the chicken into medallions to speed up the cooking process, and brined them for an hour.  I didn’t bother adding water to the egg, simply dipped the medallions in the egg, and then the bread crumb mixture.  I drizzled a little olive oil in an ovenproof pan, sautéing the chicken breasts for only a minute before flipping them over and then putting it in the oven.  It worked out perfectly.  The recipe is quick and easy and came out delicious.

This is one of the easiest recipes that I have ever made. The chicken remained so moist. The only substitution I made was fresh basil instead of dried basil because I grow it in my garden. I will definitely make this again.

It had a decent flavor, but the cook time was way too long! I checked the chicken 30 minutes into the initial 40 minute bake time and it was severely overcooked and dry.

Great chicken parm recipe. I confess to using store bought Italian bread crumbs but my own homemade sauce. Will never fry again. My husband had no idea the chicken was baked.

Very easy to make. My 10 year old daughter made it while I gave instructions. It turned out great. Best part is she didn't like chicken until eating this dish. It is so flavorful!

It turned out delicious! The only thing I might change is pounding out the chicken breast before breading them.

Made it like the recipe because I've used it before! I do pound the chicken breasts flatter and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder .

My family and I LOVED this recipe! I will definitely make this again. The only change I made was that I used milk instead of water in the egg wash and I baked it at 375° so it would be done a bit faster. The one issue I had was that when everything was done cooking, any sauce that was extra in the baking dish was rather watery and I'm not sure why. Otherwise, my family raved about this and are looking forward to leftovers tomorrow. Thanks!

So quick and easy.  Looks pretty on the plate as the cheeses melted with a slight crispy crust which I love.  The only thing I would add next time would be salt and there will be a next time.

Pounded the chicken breasts flat so cool time was much reduced (20 min, then 5 under broiler).  Otherwise, made as written - delicious, moist and easy!

I followed the recipe as written, using 1/2 panko bread crumbs and 1/2 regular.  I was very pleased with the thick, tasty crust. It was exceptionally good for a baked chicken recipe. the chicken was tender and moist. All around it was great and I will definitely make it again.

Really easy and really good. I bought store-bought thin-sliced chicken breast  (they are pretty thin) so i cooked them a little less time but besides that followed the recipe word for word. Turned out great, Super easy and a really good flavor for being baked with very little fat. Will definitely make this version again - thanks!

This was delicious and easy!  I did tenderized/pound the chicken before hand, and I think that made the meat more tender.

I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't bake the sauce over the chicken in the oven. I wanted it pretty, so I cooked it on the stove to reduce it a little and get it hot. Then I put spaghetti noodles in a dish, placed the chicken on top, added the sauce, and topped it with the mozzarella. then I put it back in the oven to melt the cheese. Tasted great and looked pretty.

I used seasoned breadcrumbs and followed the recipe--with the seasoned breadcrumbs,  I could have used less oregano. Other than that,  it was really good! I like the double dipping in the egg mixture. The breading stayed on and it was a nice flavor.

Easy to make. Used a little more chicken and bumped up the other ingredients a bit, especially the mozzarella. Served over spaghetti with garlic toast. A big hit with all but a picky six-year-old. Definitely adding to my recipe collection. Thank you! ?

I made this for my wife / finicky daughters and they absolutely loved it!  Chicken was so juicy, flavorful and convinced us to never make "fried" Chicken Parm again.  Also, if you want to spice it up a little, here are a few tips:
- Breadcrumbs - split up total measurement for bread crumbs (2/3rd Panko | 1/3rd Herb/Garlic Bread Crumbs)
- Add a few dollops of either low fat ricotta or whipped cream cheese on top of each breast for the last 15 mins

Enjoy!

Loved it!  The chicken came out very tender.  Mine was fairly thick and was done ahead of the time listed.  I used just one cup of breadcrumbs to trim calories, and used olive oil instead of cooking spray.  I loaded my pasta sauce with peppers, onions, and carrots, and used fresh mozzarella instead of pre-shredded.  Easy dish with little hands-on time.

I used chicken tenders instead of whole breasts so cut down cooking time by 15 min. I did not double dip, since that just seemed to make a mess but not add much. Otherwise followed the recipe. Tasty, moist chicken to top on some spaghetti.

great way to make a non-fried version. Brilliant to bake without the sauce and then add it at the end. Less mess, quicker and healthier.

I needed a quick meal with ingredients I had on hand. I found this recipe and I'm glad that I did. Absolutely loved it as did my family of picky eaters! I followed the recipe exactly as it was... I did however use extra sauce and mozzarella. Great taste!

The chicken was very moist but the breading was very mushy. I won't double dip next time and also add salt and pepper.

We all liked it!  Baking the chicken rather than frying it is healthier   Some things that I did differently - when I tried dipping the chicken in the egg for the second time, all of the breading fell off so I didn't do that for the rest of the chicken pieces.  Cooked the chicken for 30 minutes instead of 40 as another reviewer suggested.  Used homemade sauce.  Chicken turned out moist.  Will make this again.

Was delicious. I used Italian style bread crumbs instead of the seasonings and marinara for the sauce. Chicken was tender and flavorful.

I love this recipe, I have had it different ways but this one is quick, I slice my chicken though so it will cook faster and I used fettuccine this time in stead of spaghetti .

Delicious, used thighs as I didn't have breasts. It came out in the oven just as well as frying , and also saved time.
It was juicy and tasty, loved this recipe.

It will take less time to cook if you have thinner pieces of chicken...and a bit hard to tell if it's done b/c of being covered in the Panko break crumbs...but it's yummy!

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe as written and found this to be the best and easiest chicken parmesan that I have ever tasted. I like that you bake this chicken and thus reduce the oil and calories.

This was so easy to make and my family absolutely loved it. Other than adjusting for  a serving for 4 and giving it a couple extra minutes to back for my oven, I followed the directions and it was a total hit, especially with my mom's sauce recipe. I absolutely will be making this again.

I'm not a cook by any means, most things I make can be described best as edible. This was extremely simple and tasted great. Instead of mixing in the seasoning with the bread crumbs, I bought the Italian bread crumbs. My wife said I needed to make it again in the near future, thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for something different for dinner and I decided to try this.  There is only my husband and I and we don't eat a lot anymore.  I used 1 large chicken breast and followed the directions but decreased everything accordingly.  It seems like lately everything I cooked lately is like I'm a novice and I burn it; but this came out really good and I seriously impressed myself.  Very good.  I highly recommend you try it

Simple, easy and delicious
Big fan of simple and real
Made this for a 10 ppl dinner party
Everyone loved it 
So much better than other fancy recipes from pretentious “celebrity chefs” which calls  for too many ingredients and steps

This was outstanding! Had to re-calculate ingredients to make for two people, but after that, it was as uncomplicated to prepare and cook as a recipe can be (a blessing for a novice cook like me). The results were absolutely delicious, and we highly recommend this dish.

This recipe is an easy, family pleasing recipe.  I tried to stay as close to the original recipe as possible.   I had seasoned Italian breadcrumbs so I did not need to add the seasoning specified in the recipe.  I recommend using a baking sheet and rack  instead of a regular backing dish.  I used mine and the results were chicken breasts that were crispy on both sides.  Once my chicken was cooked thoroughly, I turned on the broiler just long enough to get a pretty brown color on both sides before soooning a little sauce over and adding the cheese to each breast.

Instead of mozzarella cheese I used Muenster and it was delish! Whole grain pasta to complement it.

I’m 59 years old and have NEVER made chicken Parmesan in my life!  This recipe was EASY, QUICK and DELICIOUS!  The only thing I changed was to make 4 really big chicken breasts, I stead of 6 smaller ones.
My family kept telling me how good it was and of course, that made this Momma so happy!
Thank you!  I’ll make this again and again!

Really delicious! I sliced my breasts in half so that they were thin. I baked them on a rack set inside a 9x13 pan which worked well. This is the first time I've made Chicken Parm without the bottom being mushy! I used a combination of traditional bread crumbs and panko crumbs and only dipped it in the egg and crumbs mixture once. I was afraid all of my crumbs would fall off in the egg for the second dip. It only needed about 20 minutes before I added the sauce and then 15 with it since the breasts were so thin. We served it over Orzo. Yummy! This will be my go-to Parm recipe.

I made the receipe as stated. It was good in flavor. The bottom was a little soggy. Could have done without that. I did put under the broiler for about a minute to brown the cheese a little more. Will make again

Not trying to be mean but I didn't like it only because I don't really like chicken but my mom loves chicken parmesan and she loved this. I made for a Home Ec project and thanks to this dish I got a 95. The only thing I messed up on was I almost put the breading into the egg mixture. Overall a good dish to make if your parents like chicken parmesan and I just like it with more cheese. The addition of the mozzarella and not just the parmesan.

Made exactly as suggested and all 7 people loved it. Although it would be nice to have a crispier crust on the chicken, it satisfied the health-conscious that it was all baked.

I followed the recipe as is, although I pounded the breasts to shorten cooking time.
   Hubs liked it, and I thought it was OK~but next time I'll use more garlic + fresh basil for more flavor.
    It is a good recipe, and I like that the chicken is baked and not fried!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there was no salt in the recipe. I added a little to the egg and water mixture. I used boneless skinless thighs and made no additional changes. The next time  will double the spaghetti sauce.

Will make again.  I dipped the chicken in panko bread crumbs only one time versus twice.  Toward the end, I put the oven on low broil and basted them with butter to help with browning.  Crowd pleaser in my house!!

I made this recipe with no changes as I like to taste the original first. I found that, for my taste, less oregano would not overwhelm the chicken flavor. It is very easy to make so thanks for posting this recipe!

I have made this many times and we love it!  Our preference is to use boneless, skinless thighs.  It works great and we enjoy it for leftovers...... Even cold.   Recipe is simple! There's no frying, and it's tasty.  I use Emerils Homestyle Marinara sauce.  I recommend this recipe.

My family loved it, but it needed salt and black pepper.  Next time, I'll definitely add at least a teaspoon of each.

This was wonderful!!!! the only difference I made was, I coated the chicken breasts in mayonnaise before dipping them in the bread crumbs and egg mixtures. it made them quite juicy

This turned out good.  Followed the recipe other than not adding thyme since we don't like it.

This recipe was great! We used crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs and that worked well. It was very moist and tasty and easy to make!
