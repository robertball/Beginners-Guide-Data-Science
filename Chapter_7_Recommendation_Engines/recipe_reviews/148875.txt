My family actually really liked the recipes. I made my own Alfredo sauce though, because we are trying to watch the calorie count. I also cut up the pork and the mixed everything together in with spiral pasta. The mushrooms in this recipe are simply divine!

Delicious and restaurant worthy.  I did mix the mushroom sauce with the Alfredo and it didn't seem to matter.   Really good.

This was very tasty. Takes a little time to prepare, but it is worth it. My hubby loved the mushroom mixture. I will make this again.

Absolutely amazing. I used a homemade alfredo sauce and left out the basil and parsley but everything else was done according to the recipe. I couldn't believe how delicious such a relatively easy meal could taste. My boyfriend licked every plate and pan clean.
