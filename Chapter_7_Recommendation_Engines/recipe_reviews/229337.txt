Made this as written. wasn't exactly sure how long to "beat" but decided to beat for about 2 minutes.  Thought it would thicken up a bit so dates and walnuts could be "folded" in. They turned out perfectly! Just delicious. ..will definitely make these again. I used my mini chopper to prepare the graham cracker crust and walnuts. Only had whole dates on hand so took a little time to chop.

To answer a question one review had: eggs have to be beaten until the yellow of the yolk dissapears, about one minute, if they are overly beated the mixture produces little bubbles and this shows when the brownies are baked.
Also, it is very helpfull to crumb the crackers in a blender or food procesor.

I just tried this recipe for the first time and it's so  easy. I cut the recipe in half just to try them. I also used figs instead of dates and almonds instead of walnuts because that's what I had In my pantry. I also used flax as an egg substitute to make them a little healthier. Everything else was as the recipe called for. They tasted delicious right out of the oven and I look forward to trying them after they have cooled down.

This was delicious!  I think I'll try it with some of my other favorite dried fruits: apricots, dates, maybe even raisins.
