This is a nice little cookie! I had to bake a little longer then the suggested twelve to fifteen minutes, but that's probably just my oven. They came out crispy, yet nice and chewy. I think the next time I bake these I'll add either chocolate, peanut butter or butterscotch chips. Thanks so much Suzanne; the kids will be happy little campers when they get home from school.

Excellent recipe.  I followed to a "t" except I used old-fashioned oats instead of quick oats.  They reminded me of coconut macaroons, but not light and airy, they are dense and crunchy, but with the same good flavor.  Will definitely make again soon! Kids loved them also!

I only got to eat one of these before my family demolished them so I would have to say it is a keeper!!  I think maybe butterscotch chips would be a nice change and it would keep with the pale color of the cookie.

Yummy cookies, my husband loved these! I think it could use a tad more salt. Next time I'll try 3/4tsp or 1tsp.

I made this recipe with a lower sugar content... so flour, baking soda, salt, shortening, brown sugar, (no white sugar), eggs, (NO vanilla extract, NO oats, NO crisp rice cereal).

The cookies are not my thing, that bar...a cookie-bar I think is my favorite dessert. The dough was baked 30 mins in a 9x9" glass baking dish.

If I had an after thought on baking the coconut bars; maybe adding 1 tsp of coconut extract would be best).
