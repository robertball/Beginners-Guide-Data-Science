I added a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter. The recipe had a great taste and the texture was right for a granola bar. My whole family liked these a lot. Thanks for the recipe! These will be a staple in my house of hungry teenage boys!

Super yummy. I stuck with the recipe. I couldn't resist having a bite when these were right out of the oven! I'm a graduate student, so I needed something for marathon library days. I used semi-sweet chocolate morsels. I don't keep instant coffee, but I do have Kona beans and a flavored bean that I like. I mixed them up keeping the Kona grounds as the base so the flavored grounds didn't have too much punch. For the dried mixed fruit, I got an anti-oxidant blend. The flavors all work really well together. I was worried that the honey and brown sugar would be too sweet, but with unsweetened apple sauce it is perfect.

My teenagers and I really liked this gluten free bar. Its no-fail for whatever modifications. I added extra milk chocolate chips, extra instant coffee and a little coconut. I drizzled them with small drizzle of glaze (1 tbsp melted butter, 4 tbsp confectioners sugar and a tbsp of chambourd (Jack Daniels works too) heated in a pan til the alcohol burned off.) It won't taste "too healthy" with my jack daniel's glaze. lol

Thanks for sharing So-Cal Girl! These fit the ticket! Great, well rounded bar. I made these just as you wrote except for almond flour(didn't have any, substituted WW) and they were delicious and filling! I might use this as a base and try adding peanut butter.

Not sure what I did wrong but these did not hold together very well. I did find them loose as I poured into the pan and pressed down even harder but it didn't help.  We also found them a little sweet and I believe you could likely cut the brown sugar in half. Perhaps more almond flour could have saved this recipe for me. All that said, they are full of "good stuff" and I did enjoy trying them.

Baked 20 mins. Really moist but sknny and tout-sweet. Used: dark choc chips (intense!), dates & walnuts (delish) and raisins(meh). Added a 1/2 c coconut and subbed a heaping Tbs pb for half the honey (great, great ideas). NextTime: Double the crispy rice. Use 9X11 pan & press mix firmly into it. Reduce b.sugar by half. Forget the raisins and replace with yummier dates. Use semi-sweet chips vs dark. Or try dried cherries, pecans & ss chips (plus pb  substitution and coconut addition). do not increase chips! Bake 20 mins?
