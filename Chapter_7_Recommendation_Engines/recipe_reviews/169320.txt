I made these last night though deviated slightly from the recipe and thought these were excellent!  The hint of brown sugar in the sauce really gave an interesting flavor.  I added a little cayenne pepper too which gave it a nice kick.

These were pretty good.  I think next time I would double the sauce recipe, because I thought they were a little dry once baked in the oven.  I also didnt think the peppers were supposed to be as crunchy as they were, I would have liked them to be softer.  I would make this again though, the flavors were very good.

Peppers were too small to stuff so I just threw it all together in a glass dish. My husband said it tasted a lot like a sloppy joe. It is a good dinner to make ahead of time and toss in the oven, the ingredients aren't too hard to come by either.

I followed this to a tee minus the brown sugar (I was out) and added maple syrup in its place. It was so delicious.  I doubled it and found that the 2 cans of sauce in the meat was too much so if you double it only use 1 1/2 cans of sauce in the meat and use the rest of the can with the sauce for the top.  I also covered mine while in the oven for the first 45 minutes and that softened the peppers up nicely and then uncovered the other 15 miytes to get the top before I added teh cheese.  We will definitley make again.

Made this mostly following the recipe.  I was out of brown sugar so used white sugar and some maple syrup.  My peppers were small so I laid them out on the bottom and just put the filling on top.  Mine weren't crunchy, but I boiled them for 5 minutes.

Excellent pepper to stuff!  The sweetness of the pepper combined with the stuffing and tomatoe sauce mixed with brown sugar was perfect.  I added the basil, oregano, and parsely to the ground beef while browning it so that the beef took on the flavor then I substituted the tomatoe sauce that gets put on the peppers after stuffing with 1 can of tomatoe paste mixed with half of a can of tomatoe soup then added the brown sugar and spooned it over the stuffed peppers.  The entire family loved this recipe and will definately be making it again!

Tried tonight and thought the taste was great. I did go a little heavy on the spices because I like a spicy dish.

OK this was delicious but only b/c I tweeked it some. Cut the salts & black pepper in half but still a little salty.  Only had 3/4 lb. of meat which was plenty.  Also added 1 extra can of tomato sauce and small tomato paste. Also cooked rice in beef stock for added flavor but 20 min. is a bit long, rice was too soft but all in all came out awesome in the end!

This was just okay, I was expecting it to taste a lot different than a stuffed pepper recipe I normally make and it didn't.

these were very good. I did add an additional can of tomato paste since it was suggested by others to double the sauce and that's all I had in my pantry. I felt it needed another can of tomato sauce...will do 3 cans for sure next time I make it.

I did make a few modifications:  I used only a smidgen of regular table salt, used garlic powder (not garlic salt), and omitted the brown sugar (Cubanelles are already sweeter than bell peppers) and it was SUPERB!   And SOOO much simpler to make because I didn't have to pre-boil or par-boil the peppers as I've previously done with the bells.  This recipe was such a hit, I don't think I'll ever go back!

I make this recipe but use ground turkey instead of beef and riced cauliflower instead of white rice, so that it's a bit healthier. It's always a hit at my house. The peppers I get tend to be irregular shapes and hard to stuff but I do my best. I often end up with an extra half pepper that won't fit in my casserole dish, so I chop it up fine and add it to the sauce.

I made these for dinner and the family loved them.  I read the receipt incorrectly and added a tablespoon of basil and a teaspoon of parsley , then since I messed with the receipt, I added a tablespoon of a Tuscan Herb blend the I had on hand and the flavor was phenomenal . We will be having this often this summer since I have the cubanelle peppers growing in my garden.

I doubled the recipe  and  used passatta  for the sauce. These were very good and will make  again but I would use a little less sauce and did cover with tin foil to get them started. I like the peppers to remain a bit crisp and the peppers had a better flavour than the usual bell peppers that  are used.

Great recipe and great flavor! I did substitute yellow rice for the white rice because it's more flavorful and I used fresh basil (I had it on hand). It was a great dish and can feed a family for sure.

Pretty good recipe.  The only issue I had was it was that amount of salt.  It was pretty salty.

I definitely have to give the recipe 5 stars simply because of the fact that I pretty much use the same methods/ingredients that you use... BUUUTTT.. Instead of using just ground beef, rice and onion, I also add in diced(fried)potatoes and diced tomatoes for extra flavor and taste. It also adds to the consistency so that it isn't mushy at all. And as far as the cheese goes.. You can definitely use either grated cheese OR cheese sauce!  I prefer cheese sauce just for it's smooth creaminess!   Thank you for sharing your recipe and I hope that my changes definitely don't offend you in any way and possibly give others an outlook at what their imagination is capable of.  :)

This was a very good recipe and had a nice "sweet" flavor on top.
