This recipe calls for 12 ounces of canned whole green chiles.  I only found the chiles in 7 oz. cans, so I used two (14 oz. total).  It wasn't enough.  Next time I will use at least four cans.  These were easy and very tasty.  I think plain monterey jack cheese would work fine.

I used fresh chiles (not canned) but recipe still worked great. I would leave in the oven longer to get the fresh chiles softer.  I also added an extra can of chopped green chiles to the sauce and it was very good that way.

I would consider these more of a cheese enchilada than a chiles rellenos.  They are however good.  I used the 10 minutes enchilada sauce recipe from this sit that I added low fat sour cream too.  I also used 50% low fat pepper jack to cut back on some of the calories and low fat tortillas.  You never would have known it was a lot fat dish.  Very easy to make and very tasty.

Made this recipe for my co-worker's birthday.  My family wanted me to leave it home for them as they were my taste testers.  Delicious!  I guess I am going to be making it again tonigth for my family.  The only change I made was to add some ground beef cooked with onions and chile powder.

I made this recipe and it is great. I only had a 10 oz can of red enchilada sauce so mixed it with a 10 oz can of green sauce. It reheats well which is good as there are only two of us and it makes a lot! Will certainly make this one again, a good company recipe too. C Hope

It really wasnt that quick to make.  I would suggest putting some enchilada sauce inside the tortilla with the pepper and cheese, as well as pouring it on top of the whole dish itself.

These were so good! I never thought about putting a whole green chile inside of my enchiladas. I used fresh green chiles, charred them over an open flame, peeled, removed seeds and veins. I also added some shredded beef I had leftover from another recipe on this site. I just melted cheese over top of the enchiladas while baking and left the sour cream and salsa to be added on the side.

I made this thought its was rally good I added string cheese with the pepper Jack my tortillas were kinda big so I also added extra fresh peppers that I broiled and pealed I did not have red enchilada sauce so I used a jar of green chile salsa I added chopped onions. After I cooked them I toped with sour cream. If your tortillas are a little stiff I put them in the microwave for  13 seconds before you add any of the peppers, that way they rolled up nice. If your are a chile rellenos fan you will love this reciepe!

Very good. Just added extra cheese to the top.  I could see it working well with chicken, too.

Tasty, but didn't really remind me of chiles rellenos. I used some roasted poblano peppers that I had in my freezer instead of the canned green chiles.
