As written, this recipe didn't work for me. I added only 10 ice cubes, and my Vitamix still couldn't make this come out milk shake consistency. Also, it was very bitter without a sweetener of some kind. Was I able to salvage it? Of course! I added a little water, a little stevia, and half a scoop of protein powder and it was fine for a quick breakfast.

I added a little chocolate milk and some more banana to make the taste of the cocoa powder a little less strong. It turned out great!

Not a fan of banana but 1/3 was just right. I also added less ice cubes (4) and added stevia for more of a sweet taste. Going to add some protein powder next time for more of a thicker consistancy. Was just ok
