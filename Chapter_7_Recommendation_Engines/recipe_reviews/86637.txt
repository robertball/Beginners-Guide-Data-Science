I made this a little differently, but my husband and I loved the taste and it was ridiculously easy!  I used olive oil and salt instead of butter and I actually just cooked the chicken breasts right in the non-stick skillet with everything else.  I made sure to keep basting as I was cooking.  The chicken itself lacked something...probably just helps to marinate it in something beforehand, but the sauce is SO good!  It tastes comparable to something you find at a Chinese buffet.  I think next time I'll cut the chicken breasts into chunk-size pieces in order to get the sauce all over it.  I think it would also be delicious with chopped or whole peanuts if you like them.  Definitely will make again!

Do not attempt to make on an indoor grill. I tried to grill this recipe on my George Forman grill and it turned out awful! Perhaps it is because you can not control the temperature on the basic George Forman grill but it made the marinade to turn black and start smoking instantly. It was the most vile smelling and tasting chicken ever.

My husband and I thought this was OK, but felt it needed something.  It had a nice subtle sweetness, but it was sorta bland.  Maybe needs one or more of these ingredients:  salt, pepper, season salt, hot sauce or other spices.  My kids liked it though.  If I make this again, I'm going to add some ingredients and maybe make kabobs instead of using the half of breast.  I think using smaller pieces would really bring out the flavor of the sauce.  This recipe has potential!

Update July 29, 2005.  OK, I tried this with kabobs, I cut boneless skinless chicken breasts into bigger than bitesize chunks, put them on skewers with red onion, red and green pepper.  I bought a 3 pound package of boneless skinless chicken from Costco.  I have a family of 4, I did have some leftovers, but not much!  I tripled the recipe, but I used two tablespoons of lemon pepper for the whole sauce recipe and omitted the lemon juice, added salt and cayenne pepper to taste.  I kept the cayenne mild for the kids.  Cooked it on the grill and basted with the sauce. Soooo good!  Thank you for the inspiration!  I would have never came up with this without this recipe posting!

Great recipe!  I really liked the flavor.  I used two cloves of garlic and a bit of extra honey.  Took no time at all to put together.  Thanks!

My husband thought the flavour was a little bland but I didn't.  I used a good quality non-stick frying pan on medium and the chicken came out really moist.  I will make this recipe again as it was so easy and works perfectly with a fresh salad.

I made this recipe and it turned out very good however there wasn't enough honey flavor in mine. If your not afraid of a lot of sugar you may want to add a little more honey. Following this recipe exactly will create a very light sauce and It was barely enough for my two chicken breasts even though it recommends using four.

I wasn't sure about the flavor when I tasted it before brushing it on the chicken but once grilled the flavors married quite nicely. It was wonderfully light tasting. I do think I may marinate the chicken in this sauce ahead of time just to give it a little more flavor but it is quite good as a glaze. I will make again.

This was insanely bland.  It really added little flavor to the chicken. Have to say I'm surprised by the high rating.

My family and I loved this recipe. I pounded my chicken out before I grilled it but that was the only difference. It was something new and I had everything on hand. Thanks a bunch

Since I lack a grill right now, I made this in my 12 inch frying pan. After I added all of the sauce ingredients, I added the chicken as well. To keep the chicken flavorful I would scoop some of the sauce over the chicken while it was cooking. Tasted GREAT!!!! It's a regular thing that I make now because it's so easy and everyone eats their share and asks for seconds.

I have made this twice.    Since the reviews indicated it might be bland, I marinated it in minced garlic, lemon juice, and worchestershire for about 12 hours.  Then, I added recipe as is.  Fantastic!  How can butter, honey, and garlic be bad???     So, prepped it for a second grilling this morning (same process) and just craved it all day.  It was fantastic again!  My husband loved it too.    We grill chicken a lot and generally rotate recipes for variey. This will be a regular in the rotation!    Love it!

After I added salt to the recipe, I loved it!  And my family enjoyed it as well.  Which is saying a lot since I have 2 very finicky eaters.

The glaze was delicious.  I added some salt and pepper to it.  Although, I think this might be better in the oven or stovetop so the chicken can sit in the glaze for more flavor.

Great recipe! However, I did kick it up a notch by stir frying jalapeno peppers(fresh/sliced)in EVOO instead of butter. The combination of the heat from the peppers and the honey was really good. If you do not like hot peppers you probably would not like my changes.

Add some Lawry's or another brand of seasoning salt to this mix. Years ago a stekhouse here used to make a great Honey glazed chicken and I found out their secret. I usually use at least a tablespoon but you can adjust to taste.

This was good, I did season with a bit of salt to bring out the flavors.  Before the salt i found it a bit bland, salt added just enough to make it interesting.

These were pretty good. Not as much flavor as I would have liked in them but still good. I use my George Foreman grill all year round so this gives us another recipe to rotate in. Thanks...

As written, I would agree that this recipe is on the bland side.  I added a dash more lemon juice than called for, heated it on the stove top until the sauce just began to bubble and removed from the heat. I then pre-basted one side of my boneless skinless chicken breasts, sprinkled that side w/ Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning then laid the sauce side down on the grill. I repeated the basting and seasoning on the other side.  I flipped my chicken back and forth on a low grill, basting each side as I turned it until they reached an internal temp of 170.  They were juicy and tender, seasoned just right for me, my hubby wanted some salt on his. I will try this one again and I think I'll add some heat w/ a dash of red pepper flakes next time.

I thought this was great.  As another reviewer suggested, I added a little cayenne pepper and sprinkled with salt and pepper.  I also cut into chunks and grilled as a kabob with zucchini and mushrooms.  It was delicious and I will be making again!

Very tasty recipe. I did as another reviewer suggested and cubed the chicken first. I then dipped each piece in about half the sauce and skewered them with onions and green and red peppers. Then I grilled them and basted during the last few minutes of cooking. They were delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is a keeper. I salt/pepper'd the chicken before I sauted them inside (no grill). The only changes I made to the ingredients were adding some red pepper flakes and soy sauce for my husband after serving it to my son (who loved it as written). Also, I doubled the sauce since other reviewers said they ran out. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very delicious. The chicken stayed so nice and moist. I did this on a grill pan and left out the lemon because I didn't have any.

The only change I made to this was to add some cayenne pepper for kick and some salt. It was awesome, loved the crunchy caramelized outside of the chicken.

I used this recipie as a base because some said it was blah. I added MakersMark sauce, and a little bit of hot sauce then let it all merinade together for a few hours rather than just throwing it on the grill. I then added honey to it as it cooked on the grill (as the recipie states). Over all it was good and I plan on making it again!

This was pretty good, although I do agree that it smelled funny when cooking. Due to comments that chicken lacked flavor I marinated in the sauce prior to cooking. I made a few changes to help increase the flavor: extra garlic (grated with micro-plane), lemon zest, a little olive oil and salt/pepper. The sauce had an oriental taste to it. I will make again using orange instead of lemon.

I ended up making the baste for this, but putting it on shrimp instead of chicken (last minute decisions!). Let me tell you- IT WAS AMAZING! Since shrimp cook so fast, I put a little on the shrip before grilling and then constantly basted them with this the whole time they were cooking. My husband said he could have eaten another 2 skewers full of shrimp with this sauce. It was better than red lobster! We'll be keeping this recipe on hand and using it again and again whenever we have grilled shrimp.

I cooked this chicken slightly different from the recipe instructions after reading all of the reviews.  I melted the butter in a frying pan and tossed in the garlic.  After 1-2 minutes I added the lemon juice and honey.  I then tossed in the chicken,cut up into bite-size pieces.  After the chicken was fully cooked, I turned the heat on low and let the chicken simmer about 5-7 minutes.  I added the chicken to our salads and reserved a little bit of the liquid to use as a light dressing.  It was fantastic!!  My family loved it and it was good the next day as a cold chicken salad as well.

I read a lot of reviews before I made this.  I was unsure of this due to the mixed reviews on the site - seems like you either change a lot about it and love it (I don't think you can change it that much and still give it 5 stars though!) or you don't like it at all.  I added salt, pepper and cayanne based on some other reviews.  I marinated it for 3-4 hours.  It had an okay flavor, not very strong.  The honey mixture was definitely more of a glaze consistency than a marinade or sauce - maybe I did something wrong.  I also made only 2 chicken breasts and we used the sauce for 4.  It wasn't horrible b/c we ate all the chicken, but we won't be making this again.

I took others advice and cut chicken into bite size pieces, floured then cooked in Canola oil, while that was cooking I used a small skillet to cook the garlic then used a bowl to combine 2 tblsp. brown sugar, 2 tblsp. teriyaki, 1 tblsp. soy, 3 tblsp. honey, 1/2 tsp. or so of tabasco, 1 tblsp. lemon juice, 1/2 tsp. of ginger, added the garlic and whisked together.  I added that to the chicken when it was cooked through and then served over Jasmine Rice.  This is a great base recipe that you can modify to suit your family's taste, I would never of thought to use lemon juice.  Thanks for submitting and to all the reviewers for giving me your tips- they were truly inspiring :-)

This recipe needed a little kick.  I added a cube of chicken bouillon to the sauce and a pinch of red pepper flakes. It was very good.

I keep trying new receipes out on my family and they use the 4 star rating system.   this was a 4 across the board, the next time i make it i might try to spice it up a bit using cajun spice and adding a little more honey.   but all in all it was a great hit with my family

Really nice recipe. Just make sure to salt and pepper the chicken before you baste it- it help the flavor come out. We've made this twice and really enjoyed it both times.

I'm trying to find new recipes to grill with, since we got a Foreman grill for Christmas.  I noted the comments for an earlier Foreman user, so I made some modifications. First, I noted that some of the users found this chicken to be bland, so I seasoned the breasts lightly before I grilled them.  I basted them with red. sodiums soy sauce, and a little garlic powder.  When the breasts were almost done, I then based them with the honey glaze, lightly, and then again as I was pulling them off the grill.  I had only one breast start to "smoke" when I wasn't paying attention, lol, but I got it quickly, and it tasted good.  My whole family, including my picky 3 year old who doesn't eat meat these days, really enjoyed this chicken.  We'll definately be eating these again!

The chicken looked absolutely mouth watering.  The flavor though was lacking some kick as to me it tasted the same as if I hadn't done anything.  A dash or two of salt in the glaze would go a long way.

Nothing terribly special.  Not bad, just not special.  Even my husband thought it needed more flavor, and usually I'm the one wanting stronger flavors. Probably won't make it again. It was easy though.

Good, with a mild flavor that isn't overwhelming.  I would serve with a strong side dish.
I used with pork chops rather than chicken.  I also used light margarine so I never had the issue of my sauce thickening up.  We will probably make again simply because this is simple and I usually have all ingredients on hand.  I however generally prefer dishes with more flavor.  I served with Pasta and Herbs (also from this site), a green salad, roast cauliflower and garlic bread.

Subtle flavor, delicious, easy, and hubby loved it.  5 stars in my book!  The sauce does get a little sticky and hard to work with as it cools but will melt when it touches the chicken.

Very easy and tasty. I should have let the briquettes burn down another 15 minutes or so, because the chicken was quite dark, although not charred.

I found out that this does NOT turn out well in the toaster oven (the sauce burns), but it's delicious on the grill!

Everybody loved it, even the kids!! I did add more Garlic salt and instead of grilling the chicken, I baked it at 400 degrees for 55min.  The chicken Browned nicely on top.

This was my first time making this recipe. I absolutely enjoyed it and will make it again in the future! I used garlic powder, fresh squeezed lemon juice and pepperika along with the called for honey. This was fabulous!

I did make a couple of changes. With the advice of another review I cut the chicken in cubes and cooked then in a skillet basting often. It was awesome and very easy. I also doubled the sauce.

Actually baked instead of grilling. Used extra clove garlic. Made double the sauce and basted the chicken occasionally during cooking. It was delicious!! Next time I will pour the leftover sauce from baking dish over the chicken and some white rice. Thanks!!

Made this tonight as written (added a pinch of salt), but as kabobs under the broiler. They were tender and moist, but they were a little lacking in the flavor department even though I marinated for 4 hours in 1/2 the glaze and used the other 1/2 to mop on during broiling. They were good, but this won't be a "go to" for me.

I just made this last night and it was "ok". I didn't marinate it due my husband thinking it would change the flavor outcome, so the chicken wasn't as tender as we would have liked. My kids liked it more since they've never had it before. I probably wont make it again.

I pre-made the chicken for a camping trip.  Made it before we left, packed it into the refrigerator in the camper, and it was so easy to plop onto the hot iron frying pan over the camper's stove.  Kids loved it!

This is mainly a response to the person who commented about the use of an indoor grill. I'd say the problem is using the George Foreman grill. If you want to grill indoors, I recommend using a small grill that's held over a gas stove. I used this for grilling and the chicken turned out great.

This was wonderful and the chicken was so tender, it just fell apart.  I'm going to try this on fish too because it think it would be just as good on it.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's 5 stars in my book.

Very bland, I added salt to the chicken breasts.  Will not be making this one again.  My old standby recipe for marinating and grilling chicken breasts beats this one by a mile.

I triple the recipe to have extra sauce (we like it over our rice, etc.)  We serve it as-is for the children, and then add a little chipotle for the grown ups.  YUM!

Decent, but like previous reviews, a little bland.  Could be easily spiced up, though, with more garlic.  Tastes better when it's marinated in advance.

Well, I made it pretty close to the recipe, just added a little garlic salt and lemon pepper, and it wasn't bad.  It came out a little tough using my george forman grill, but that may have just been me.  Our roommate loved it, I liked it, and my very picky husband wasn't impressed.  I would make again though.  Maybe just adjust how I cooked it to make it less tough.  Otherwise a decent meal, and a different way to make chicken.

i used a lot of extra butter and garlic, and i substituted lime juice for lemon juice. i just guessed on the amount of honey to use-also added some salt--and let the sauce simmer for about five minutes. i also sprinkled lemon pepper on the chicken before i grilled it...turned out pretty well, actually.

My kids loved this recipe, but my husband and I were not thrilled. Has a good honey flavor but the garlic is a little to much.

I'm a honey lover, but this recipe just fell kind of flat.  Rather bland.  Somehow, it just didn't mesh right.  Be sure to flip the chicken often!

Very easy, but not much taste. Would probably taste better if you cut the chicken into thin strips before grilling.

Like a few other reviewers, I found this chicken to be bland. I eventually cut it into strips and added it to the salad we were going to have with it. I still found myself picking it out of the salad. Sorry! Dh did eat it, but he is not very picky.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe. A little sweet, a little sour, and the garlic brings it all together without being overpowering. Next time, I'll make more sauce for dipping. Fantastic!

It looked fabulous, smelled good, but the flavor just wasn't there. I used almost all the sauce on 2 chicken breasts and still nothing to write home about.

So simple... yet so good.  This will be a regular in my grilling repertoire.  I was afraid of the amount of honey, though it had just the right amount of sweetness.  I will try it on my grilled veggie as well next time.

This was soooo simple and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and used the skinless, boneless breasts cooked on the grill.  The whole family loved this one.  My only regret was that I didn't make extra for leftovers!  Will definitely be making this one again and again.  Thanks for such a simple and quick recipe that is so good!

Very tasty!  I used chicken thighs and then just dipped them into the sauce before grilling them in my combination microwave.  I dipped them again when turning them over.  My 19 month old and 3 year old gobbled them up too.  Thanks so much for a very quick and easy way to pep up grilled chicken.

I made this recipe and the chicken turned out good and juicy. I did made some changes. I used 1Tbs of olive oil instead of the butter. I added 1Tbs of low sodium soy sauce, 1tsp of complete seasoning (badia), and 1/2 tsp of celery seeds. Whisk in all the ingredients together and  saved some of the marinade on the side for basting. I pounded the chicken breast for more tenderness. I let it marinaded for about 1 hour. I lightly oil the grill with some olive oil and place chicken on the grill..DELICIOUS!!

Very Tasty,,,I used only 3 pounds ground chuck, no sausage.  I omitted tomato paste, celery, bacon bits, beer, and bouillon.  I kept it simple.  I didn't have chili beans in spicy sauce, so omitted that, too.
Yet, it was tasty and needed more spices, such as chili powder and cayenne at the end.

It was too cold outside to grill, so I baked chicken thighs, seasoned with salt & pepper, in a 9"x13" baking dish with the other ingredients at 425 for 18 minutes, turning halfway through cooking time.  This paired well with baked sweet potatoes ( 425 for 1 hour).

This was alittle bland. I added some season salt and and little soy sauce.  After grilling it, and tasting it, I discovered that if you pour the rest of the sauce over top of it, it zips it up and has a great flavor!

The sauce turned out more of a paste than a sauce so I added more liquid and it worked fine. It tasted fine but was very easy to make.

I enjoyed it but it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. I liked the sweet / pungent mix of honey and garlic, but it needs a liitle something more to kick it up a notch.

It was a good recipe, although you should probably either let the chicken soak in the sauce like a marinade overnight, or inject the sauce directly while cooking, as the flavor only reached the outside layers of the dish. The sauce was very good and an abberation from the burnt pan and food cooking I usually make, keep up the good work.

Easy chicken recipe for a busy night! Great taste that got even better when I added just a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes! The combination of sweetness from the honey, tang from the lemon and the spice from the garlic and pepper flakes is fantastic!!

I substitute the butter for oil and marinade the chicken overnight. It has such a subtly sweet flavor and I love it. My husband isn't a fan so I make this treat just for myself.

After reading some of the reviews, I put a twist to it since some said " it came out bland".
Turned out excellent!
Your side dish is just as important, try butter & garlic spinach & angel hair pasta with the chicken.
Inject your chicken with the above ingredients, also add paprika, salt & pepper to taste. Inject till you see the chicken pump, you should have enough ingredients to pour the remaining into the skillete.
On the side ( while cooking chicken) make a saucepan of lemon juice, honey, brown sugar, pepper to taste, almond slices  and keep on low setting of stove. Make some caramelized onions with butter separate.
When the chicken is done (approx 15 min) with skillete off immediately pour the saucepan of  lemon,honey & almonds into the skillete, stir rapidly,put back into sauce pan, the higher heat will thicken the sauce creating a glaze.
Plate up!
Pasta first, caramelized onions on top of pasta, chicken on top of that, then sauce with the almonds. Spinach on side. If you do it this way nothing is bland and you might end up mixing the spinach with all of it, taste buds come to life and want seconds.
Enjoy & bon appetite!

I read the reviews first, so I made a few adjustments before making it. Doubled the recipe and used tenderloins. added a thumb size of chopped ginger, a tsp a cayenne and let the chicken marinate for 20 minutes in the mixture before grilling. It was very good. Not bland like the reviews I read!
