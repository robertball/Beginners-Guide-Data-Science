I have made this many times.  It is fantastic!  I use generic, store-brand, fat free coffee creamer and it's just as good.  I have also used low fat and fat free sweetened condensed milk with wonderful results.

THIS STUFF IS DELISH!  It is fairly potent, so I suggest cutting down on the alcohol(Iused Bushmills) and adding more chocolate flavoring.  It is very creamy and stores for several days with no noticeable decline in quality. Everybody wanted the recipe!

Been making this for years!  Closest I have ever tasted to the all-time favorite "Bailey's Irish Cream Liqueur"! You can also use cognac but my personal favorite is brandy. Only regret is that it is never enough!

It's weird....I entered this in my recipe box awhile back, & now it doesn't seem to appear anywhere in Allrecipes....I'm glad I had saved it! It's great- I think next time I will use half & half- the cream makes it a little thick. Yeah, don't mix for too long in the blender- it could turn to butter- haha! Anyway- I used vanilla rum because that's what I had on hand. VERY yummy recipe. Will be great in tomorrow's coffee, too. If you think you might like this recipe, better save it from my review!!!

Wonderful! I haven't done a side-by-side taste test, but I think this is just as good as Bailey's Irish Cream liqueur. I made it exactly as written, and it tasted great .... and I haven't even chilled it yet. I can't wait to taste it tomorrow night. Yum! By the way, I think it's a much better recipe than the ones I've seen which call for raw eggs. Not a good idea!

I made this recipe for a cheesecake and gave what was left over to my dad, who wanted to try it. He's not a big fan of Irish Cream, and was surprised by how good it is. It also made the cheescake very strong yet delicious. Thanks!!!

I make with half and half and it still tastes amazing- making my first batch of the season in just a bit.

I used 1 c. brandy instead of 1-1/4 c., a partial can of sweetened condensed milk leftover from another recipe, 1/4 c. chocolate syrup (since you can never have too much chocolate) and Cool Whip in place of whipping cream since that's what I had around the house.  I don't think I've ever had Bailey's Irish Cream, so I can't compare the two, but this recipe was oh, so yummy -- dessert in a glass!  I can't wait to make it for a hostess gift.

Not really what I was looking for. The fincee and I just thought it was ok. On the plus side, it is very good blended with ice cream, milk, and a little bit of choc syrup. I didn't measure, just made the shake to my liking. I think I will try another recipe.
