A few cooking tips to make the chicken more juicy and more tasty. I usually use garlic salt and black pepper to season the chicken before I brown it. You are going to want to press the seasoning onto the meat so that when you put it in the oil it doesnt come off. Another thing I do is that while the chicken is cooking i continually add either chicken stock or water with a chicken boulion to the meat. Add it in small amount, about 1/4 c and let it cook off until the chicken is fully cooked. Also if you dont have cream of chicken try cream of mushroom and you can even sub the mushrooms for the brocolli

So I have to agree with most people that the chicken is really bland. I even added a bunch of things to it before cooking because of the comments. I came to realize later that the seasons that I added were washed off while being browned in the oil (ah...duh!). So I recommend seasoning your chicken while it's cooking with the rice and broccoli. And when the recipe says brown the chicken in the oil, you really need to cook it a lot longer than browning it otherwise you might end up with really soggy broccoli and rice because you'll have to cook the chicken A LOT longer than 5 minutes like the recipe says :) (yes I'm talking with experience)

I used garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper (I would have used paprika too, but I was out). The key to making sure it "sticks" is that your oil is HOT. If it's not hot, only warm, the spices will "wash off"...but even with that, it still seasons the rice mixture, so that's not the end of the world!

I also used 1/2 brown rice and 1/2 white rice and I think the brown rice adds more flavor.

Coming from an inexperienced cook: This meal is simple to make but like all the others before I tweeked it a little.  Instead of browning the chicken as whole breasts I: Cut it into strips, and in a sep. bowl I combined by sight some paprika, black pepper and garlic powder and mixed with the chicken by hand.  I then browned it in the skillet and continued to cook as the recipe indicates.  My chicken did not turn out that dry and "the Man of the House" said it was a keeper!

This receipt was quick and easy...just what I need with a newborn!  I changed the recipe a bit...rather than using full chicken breasts, I cubed the chicken to help it cook faster, and made this more like a casserole.  Some things that I will do differently next time...instead of using broccoli florets, I'll use chopped broccoli instead (I hate broccoli but if it is chopped into smaller pieces I'll eat it), and add medium sharp or sharp cheddar on top to give it a bit more zing.  Otherwise, we thought it was good, and will have it again.

This recipe was ok, I topped it off with some low fat cheddar cheese.  It needs something added tho.  If I make it again, I will add more flavor - spices to it.

I really liked this recipe.  Although, the pepper was way too strong.  I will only add a dash next time.  The 15 minute claim is a bit misleading when you consider prep time, but it's still super fast.  I also use brown rice to make it more healthy.

The original Campbell's recipe calls for onion salt in addition to black pepper, which may be why some folks are saying this is bland.  It also only calls for ONE cup of rice, not two, which is definitely the reason folks are complaining about having to add additional water.

I make this recipe per the Campbell's website and it comes out tasty every time :)

Like others, we thought the chicken was bland tasting.  However, the rice tasted great.  Since this recipe is so quick and easy, I will make it again but follow some of the other suggestions to season up the chicken.

Bland. I mean really bland. I added some garlic powder to add some flavor, but I was really disappointed by this one. I'm a terrible cook and need all the help I can get. If anybody knows how to help this recipe, I'd appreciate it. It was very easy.

I heeded the others reviews and added poultry seasoning and garlic salt to the chicken, which I cut into one inch pieces before browning.  I used "Italian Mixed Veggies" instead of just broccoli.  Before serving I added just a small amount of cheddar to each plate.

This was really good, but I dont know if I am the best judge, I am just learning how to cook. Anyway, I didnt follow the recipe exactly. I used only 3 chicken, only cuz I didnt have more. And i would not recommend that. I did use less rice for a creamier dish as indicated by the tip. I didnt use the broclli, cuz all I had was frozen broclli with cheese sauce. But I will next time. And now I wonder if I should have used the broclli with cheese sauce. I think I am going to try it both ways.

I too added onion powder, paprika, garlic powder and pepper before browning the chicken and later when placing the chicken back in. Also replaced water with chicken broth and only used 1.5 cups ofinstant rice. Butterfly the chicken or you will end up having to cook a lot longer. Even with the butter flying I had to cook covered for an additional 10 minutes.  Next time I would replace the broccoli with peas (just a personal choice) and add salt, less paprika. My family lived this quick and easy recipe!

UPDATE: Made it again with the following changes - 10 chicken tenders (all I had and hoping it would cut down on cooking time), 1.5 cup of rice, chicken broth instead of water, chicken bouillon cube added, added 2 cups of frozen peas (on top of the 2 cups of broccoli), added onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper and paprika to both sides of chicken before browning and when re-adding. Added grated cheddar cheese before plating. Took about 1 hour total, not 15 minutes! Great meal though, it was easy and makes for great leftovers.

This one is perfect when you are short on time.  I butterfly cut the chicken breast so they cook even quicker.  I added some Club House Tex-Mex seasoning to give it a kick.  Great for the busy family.

The base of this meal is actually very good if you take a few extra moments to spice it up a little.  I read all of the reviews and decided to do just that.  I cubed the chicken (to cut down on the cook time and to spread a little chicken much further).  Once I placed the chicken in the pan with the oil, I then used Coriander, Basil, Garlic Salt, Paprika, and a dash or two of Pepper.  (although I still added some paprika and pepper when I added the additional ingredients)

Also, I didn't have instant rice, so when I added liquid I didn't use water, I used milk.  I wanted to maintain a creamy consistency without the watered down flavor.  Don't use the full 1 1/2 cups if you're not using instant rice as you don't have it to soak it all in.  You'll have WAY too much liquid.  Add milk until you reach the desired consistency.  

I also agree with not using the broccoli florets.  I did, and they were WAY too big.  I don't like needing to cut food in a one bowl meal like this... 

Cooking time is completely inaccurate if you're not cubing your chicken.

Delicious!  I plan on making it again and again!!

My picky daughter told me this was the best food I ever made. She ate every bite on her plate. I seasoned the heck out of the chicken with garlic and onion powder as well as pepper and extra paprika. I will absolutely be making this again!

This is very similar to a recipe that we make called Chicken Divan.  Our recipe calls for a 1/2 c. mayo & a tsp of curry powder.  It is FANTASTIC!!!

This dish was exceptionally bland. If I decide to make it again, I will definitely use some of the tips above. I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and tried seasoning the chicken and the rice, but it still was very bland. If you want softer broccoli, I advise you steam it first. The broccoli was hard and crunchy, which wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.

This was really, really bland.  I even added salt, cayenne, garlic and onion powder and chicken bouillon and it didn't stand out.  I was really disappointed, because it sounded so good when I read over the ingredients.

I used this recipe to help use up what was left on a rotissaire chicken.  Some breast meat, quite a bit of leg meat. Used 2 cups of mixed frozen vegetables. Added garlic powder, onion salt, extra black pepper and some lawrys seasoning salt. Used 1 1/2 cups long grain rice, which I cooked seperate and mixed in at the end. Topped with shredded cheddar, I think that really gave it a boost of flavor. Would make again to help use up the end of a rotissaire chicken.

Use cooked rice for this recipe of you want the meal to be completed in 15 minutes!  Otherwise it takes MUCH longer and the rice isn't completely soft.

The base and concept is solid. I made the following changes and it was pretty darn good. 

- Rinse chicken and then season generously with onion salt, garlic salt, pepper, and paprika. I didn't do extra salt because of the garlic salt. I stab the chicken with a fork several times.
- Brown chicken in very hot vegetable oil (I use my counter top skillet at 325-350) about 7 minutes per side.
- Remove chicken and continue as recipe reads. 
- Only use 1 cup of instant white rice
- Added chicken bullion cube
- Sprinkle additional pepper and paprika to rice/soup/water mixture and then add chicken back to pan. 
- Added one homemade canned beans (instead of broccoli)

Cooked another 15 minutes or so as my chicken was pretty thick. Came out moist and flavorful! All in all, about 40 minutes including prep time.

So boring. Next time, I am going to make 1.5 cups of rice, add milk to the sauce, and keep the rice, meat, and sauce separate until serving.
