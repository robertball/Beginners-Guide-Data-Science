DO THIS OVER A SINK.  If you like fresh ginger ale, this is certainly how you make it. However, it is the sugar that reacts violently. My suggestion is to add the ginger and lemon first. Allow some ginger to soak in the seltzer. Strain, and place back in bottle. Then, in one smooth motion, add the sugar and screw back on the cap. If you don't do this quickly, you will be covered in sugar water and smell like a sushi bar for the rest of your life.  Unless your counting calories, I would use normal sugar. It just tastes better.  Other then that, great recipe.

The best solution to keep from getting a bath in this mixture is to pour the amount you will drink into a pitcher and add the flavoring.  I divided this into fourths (live alone)but could be divided into half.  Pour in half of water into large pitcher and add half of mixture.  The volcano effect is then contained, as long as your pitcher is about 50% larger then volume of liquid.  Pour over ice and enjoy.  Hope this helps.

Definitely, as everyone already stated: YOU WILL HAVE A MINI VOLCANO. My recommendation, spoon the solution bit by bit into the funnel, don't poor it since you can't beat it pouring it all in, taking the funnel, and closing the bottle.  That being said, I added more of the mixture after I got a fair amount on me, and the taste just didn't do it for me. I will definitely try real sugar next time, since sweetener, no matter how natural, just has a very distinct flavour which takes away from it.

Awesome recipe! I tried using my Champion juicer to "juice" the ginger. Worked great. Not everyone has a Champion juicer, but if you do, try it for this. I juiced a couple pounds of ginger, made "ginger ice cubes" out of it, and had it handy for this and other recipes...

I could only finely chop my ginger, I couldn't squeeze out juice for lack of a garlic press.  This is one item that should be made over the sink!  When the ginger/lemon/stevia/vanilla combine with the seltzer, you will have a mini volcano!  I actually liked having small chunks of ginger in my drink!  Great recipe!

I used Truvia because I didn't have Stevia Extract in the Raw. It still turned out great! I loved it.

This was just okay for me. After I recovered from the seltzer explosion I found the taste to be just so so. I think on a super hot day this would be refreshing and I may try it again but would add the ginger more gingerly!
