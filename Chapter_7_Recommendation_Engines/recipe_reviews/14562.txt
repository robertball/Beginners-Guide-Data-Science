I cut meat for a living and just thought I should mention here that flank steak is not the same thing as a london broil.  There is a top round london broil and a shoulder cut london broil, both of which are very thick cuts (almost like roasts).... A flank steak is entirely different and very thin cut (as the muscle is naturally thin and small).

Excellent recipe!  Now, when London Broils are on sale, I buy several, make a big batch of this marinade, let them sit a day or two, then put them in individual freezer ziploc bags, with the marinade.    Then, on a busy day, I can just pull out the pre-marinated steaks, defrost, grill, and enjoy!  Great time and money saver, and so yummy!

Very good marinade with a few additions.  I read over a couple of reviews that mentioned the meat didn't come out very tender so I added about 3 Tbls of lemon juice to act as a tenderizer.  I also added about 2 tsp of worchestershire sauce..(we call it rooster sauce), 2 tsp of fish sauce, 1 tsp of ground ginger, chili sauce instead of ketchup and a tsp of garlic powder.  I broiled this instead of grilling (due to the nasty weather) and it turned out really good.  My husband had 2 large peices and my 16 month old (who doesn't have all of her teeth) was able to eat this.  Will use again. Thanks Jill.

Very good steak marinade! Since the title uses "London Broil" and the recipe uses "Flank Steak" I can see where there would be some confusion. I decided to use London Broil because it was on sale. This is definitely a thicker, tougher cut of meat and needs a longer marinating time - 48 hours. I know that seems like a bit much but trust me it will pay off in the end. I used this marinade for 1 & 1/2 pounds of steak. I used kosher salt, low sodium soy sauce, olive oil vs. veg., chili sauce vs. ketchup, and added a splash of white wine vinegar. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go, turning it every so often and rubbing the marinade into the meat. After it's grilled to your liking cut against the grain and serve with a baked potato and fresh garden salad!

Using a london broil vs flank steak (as the recipe indicates) I added 2 tsp of lemon juice to assist in the tenderizing process, then marinated the meat for three days.  Definitely more tender than a regular london broil using the marinade....  Next time I'll up the garlic and omit the oregano which overpowered the other flavors in the marinade.   Will make again with modifications.

I've never made london broil before, and this recipe worked great for me.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I added more garlic - I used 3 Tbsp of minced bottled garlic.  I think that was perfect.  I marinated the meat for almost 24 hours, and since there was snow outside on our grill ;) I broiled the steak in the broiler for approx. 8 min. per side, and sliced very thin.  Take the meat out while it still looks a little too rare, because it will keep cooking, and it definitely is better on the rare side.  Overall, excellent marinade.  Will make again.

Wow- this is fantastic! I used London Broil and marinated in a large ziploc bag instead of foil. After grilling I sliced the meat on the diagonal as typical for LB, but really didn't need to. Nice and tender, and oh so tasty! Will definately make this again and again!

Wow! I only had time to marinate the meat for two hours and it still tasted delicious! I made sure to score and pierce the meat first and then sealed it in a ziploc bag. I cut the salt in half and added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce. My kids didn't even ask for any steak sauce and they cleaned their plates. I sliced up the leftovers the next day and tossed it a salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Yum!! I'll definitely be making this again only next time I'll marinate overnight.

Since others seemed to be confused about the use of flank steak in this london broil recipe,(which by the way was wonderful!..a keeper) this is the definition from wikipedia: London broil is a North American beef dish made by broiling or grilling marinated flank steak, then cutting it across the grain into thin strips. The origin of the name is obscure; the food is unknown in London, England.
Many American butchers will label a cut of meat "London broil". This is confusing as the term does not refer to a specific cut of meat, but a method of preparation and cookery. The cut of meat traditionally used is flank steak, but in recent years butchers have erroneously labeled top round roast/steak as London Broil. Because the muscle fibers run the entire length of this cut, the meat can be tough if not tenderized via pounding or massaging. Scoring, stabbing, cutting, penetrating, or otherwise mutilating the cut before sending it into the broiler results in a tougher finished product as it allows all the desirable juices to run out of the meat into the pan.

Great recipe!!!  Would never buy london broil for the grill because it was a tough piece of meat.  Made this and had neighbors over, sliced it thin on the slant and it was wonderful!!  Went out and bought more steaks for the freezer for the summer.
A keeper recipe !!!!!

It did not tenderize the meat much.  London broil is just a very thick flank steak in my market, tough and stringy without an acid marinade.  The flavor was great.  The second time around I used a light low sodium soy sauce and add a tiny bit of worcestire and tabasco sauce.  I also substituted a meat tenderizer for the plain salt and the extra acid from the tabasco and tenderizer helped quite a bit.

Good recipe, but I have found when cooking red meat you really need to go all out with the seasonings or it just doesn't taste like much.  So to improve upon this recipe, I added 3 T of fresh lemon juice (to help tenderize) 2 T of Worcestershire sauce, added an extra clove or two of garlic, used olive instead of vegetable oil, kosher salt instead of regular, fresh ground pepper, and about an extra two teaspoons of oregano (oh, and as a previous reviewer suggested, I marinated it in a zippered baggie).  Cook only to medium rare, then wait a while before slicing very thin.  I'd give my version 5 stars--everyone at the party loved it, even my formerly vegetarian sister.

Delicious and easy!!  Plenty of flavor.  I doubled the recipe for just 1.5 lbs of meat and marinated it in a Ziploc baggie instead of using aluminum foil.  I also left out the salt because the soy sauce has enough sodium and substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.  This will be in heavy rotation at my house.

Buy "london broil" and not flank steak, the price is better and the cut is more accurate. LOVED this recipe but I changed the cooking method. My beef was a little over 1" thick. I put it on foil on a broiler pan, and used the broil setting on the oven, placing the meat 8" below the heat source. The medium-rare cooked 7 minutes on each side. The medium-well cooked 9 mins on each side. Then I wrapped the foil around it for 10 mins to cool and seal in the juices, then sliced. We devoured it, it was so yummy! Paired with asparagus.

I doubled this recipe for 4 london broils.  I had no soy sauce so I used a little extra salt and added a little more oil. (I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.)  I got many compliments on this from VERY big steak-eaters.  The meat came out very tender and flavorful.  I highly recommend this recipe.

London Broil is NOT a cut of meat but flank steak using a recipe such as this one.  And an excellent one it is!  The USA made it into a cut of meat.  If using a top round, it will take longer to cook due to the thickness.  And not near as good.

My favorite! I love this recipe. For leftover meat, slice real thin and toss in a hot skillet with butter, oil, onions, and sliced bell pepper with a tsp of chili flakes....serve with tortilla, s. cream, salsa and cheese. WONDERFUL!

A very tasty marinade thank you!  Now those of you purchasing meat labeled london broil at your grocers?  It is usually top round steak or roast.  There is no cut of meat called london broil it is a cooking method, google it.  Although there are  plenty of butchers/meat cutters out there capitalizing on the publics lack of knowledge.  They lablel top round roasts as london broil and then sell it at a marked up price.  The original recipe calls for and is designed for flank steak.

I used flank steak. London Broil has been made for years with flank steak. Relatively recently, butchers have been cutting cheap beef round about two inches thick and calling it "London Broil." The real, flavorful thing is flank steak and that's what you should use. Jill is right on with recipe.

This was an excellent marinade.  Although I do believe it's called London BROIL for a reason, you broil it not grill it.  I read someone's review about the difference between flank steak and LB and I totally agree, they are NOT the same type of meat cuts.  Anyway I let it marinate overnight and then BROILED it one both sides, just till the meat is slightly pink in the middle. It turned out sooo good and tender.  You must watch your meat because if you don't, it's real easy to ruin it and it will come out tough and chewy.  Anyway, I still give it five stars for the great tasting marinade.  Thank God I know how to cook :-)

Since I discovered this it's the only marinade I use for London Broil.  I always buy the round steak labeled london broil, about 1 to 1.5 inches thick.  Marinade for at least 5 hours, but overnight is best, broil about 7 minutes each side...mmmmmmmm tasty.

It sounded as though Rachel was putting this recipe down because you called it London Broil but you're using Flank Steak.  Apparently Rachel's never tried this recipe because using this cut of meat, marinating it over night (which is best) and slicing it very thin is ten times better than using actual London Broil.  Not to mention the fact that it's less expensive.  I worked at a high-class restaurant in Towson, Maryland and this is exactly how they fixed it!  The only difference is that...rather than wrapping it tightly in aluminum foil, I (and the chef) simply covered the bowl very tightly with Saran Wrap.  Think it marinates better that way.

I must agree with Rachel in that London broil (as marketed in supermarkets) is NOT flank steak!! The typical cut labeled and advertised as London broil is most often top round steak thickly cut. If using top round I would suggest pin tenderizing the cut prior to marinating and grilling carefully and slicing thinly across the grain to avoid overly chewy beef. I have 40 years in the grocery industry so ... Just sayin!

Great marinade! I added a tablespoon of lemon juice, a tablespoon of Worcestershire, and doubled the minced garlic. The result was tender and flavored throughout. Definitely marinate overnight for the best results! I marinated in a 1 gal plastic bag with extra air removed to keep the marinade close to the meat on all sides. Be careful with suggested cook times since they will vary based on the thickness of the meat. I had cuts less than 1" thick and only 5 minutes per side under the broiler was sufficient for cooking medium outside with a little red at the center. Don't be afraid to double the marinade recipe if you have two cuts of meat. And freezing meat & marinade in the freezer bag is a great way to enjoy a special meal later with little prep. You'll love the results!

Delicious!  I did not use flank steak, but used top round london broil.  I doubled the marinade ingredients, except the garlic which I used even more (because we love our garlic).  I also added 2 or 3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.  I let it marinade about 24 hours, then broiled for about 8 minutes per side.  I poured the leftover marinade into a small sauce pot, added about a teaspoon of cornstarch while it was still cold, then boiled and reduced it down a bit to a nice thick gravy.  Just enough to drizzle a tiny bit across the tops of the sliced meat.  It was a huge hit with my family and will definitely be made again.

This is a really great recipe.  Flank steak is actually the original London Broil and when fixed properly is a vey tender and flavorful cut of meat.  The other cuts labeled London Broil usually always have to be tenderized in some way.

Let me put it like this.  The boy comes home and says "I'm not really hungry, but I'll try a few bites."  Then he proceeds to eat his whole portion AND gives me two compliments.  TWO!!  It's a winner as far as I'm concerned.

This is a staple in my house. I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I always marinate the meat in a ziploc bag for at least 12 hours before cooking--I think overnight is even better and helps to better tenderize the meat. I always cook this in the broiler and have actually never made it on the grill. I first cook the meat on the middle rack for 5-6 minutes on each side (depending on the thickness) and then move it up to the top rack and cook it for 1-2 more minutes on each side. The middle is always nice and pink with the end sections being a little closer to medium. Very good!

I had a 2.5 lb. London Broil I wanted to try something different with so I thought I'd give this one a go.  I only had about two hours to marinate so I pierced the meat with a tenderizing tool with all those stainless steel blade things (works awesome by the way!) I used two extra cloves of garlic and kept everything else as written.  Husband BBQ'd on the grill to medium rare/medium took it off to rest for about 15 minutes and sliced thin.  My son who is 9 and had declared his hate for all things I cook unless it's cheesy,noodles or chocolate, ate all his helping of this which was 3 slices all cut up! This by far had the best flavor of any London Broil I've ever made and I thought it was even better than the marinade I use for Tri-tip but my husband didn't agree.  I'm using this easy delicious marinade much more and can't wait to taste the meat when it's been marinating for longer than just two hours.  Super Yummo, thank you!!

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  I have never made London Broil and was a little nervous!  However, this recipe made it absolutely delish!!  You don't need steak sauce.  And this meat is tender and juicy.  Everyone who tried this really raved about it.  I will make it again and again!  Thanks!

To die for.  The longer you let it soak, the better the flavor.  It turns a cheap piece of beef into a gourmet meal.  I've even served it made on an indoor grill for Christmas Eve dinner with some lobster tail.

tried this recipe last night with a very short lead time.  Only able to marinate for approx. 2 hours.  Substituted A-1 Steak Sauce in place of the Ketchup and did not use the Oregano, however, I added a few teaspoons of Lemon Juice and some Seasoning Salt.  I used a fork and poked the meat on both sides the entire length and width of the London Broil.  Flipped it several times in the marinade and spooned plenty on top while I let it sit in the fridge.  Turned on my oven's Broiler to let the tray get really hot, cooked it for 5 minutes on the first side, cooked it for 6 minutes on the second side, during the last minute I spread a thin layer of Garlic Butter on the top for last minute sizzle and flavor.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS !  So, so easy to make.  Tender, juicy and flavorful. London Broil cuts into perfect slices, beautiful presentation.  Will not hesitate to fix this again. London Broil will be my new "go-to".

This makes a very tasty marinade.  I through it together in a ziplock baggie in the morning, and left it to marinate in the fridge all day.  We cooked the meat under the broiler instead of grilling it.   The meat was tender and juicy.

This is a great recipe.  For those of you who may be confused... a "London Broil" is a cooking method... NOT a cut of meat.  Butchers adopted the name for it, because it was popular, but it's normally a top round or a flank steak marinated and grilled or broiled.  Basically, it's seared heaven to me!  And this recipe is tops!

Oh my, this was so good!  We're big ribeye fans, so we always compare other cuts of beef to that.  Both my kids enjoyed this better than a ribeye!  It was so flavorful and tender.  We followed the marinade recipe exactly and marinated overnite.  We did use a meat tenderizer prior to marinating.  Grilled it for 3 minutes on each side on high heat, then another 3 minutes on each side on lower heat.  Sliced thin cross-grain and it was a huge hit for our Father's Day lunch!

Lbugbee beat me to the punch.  London Broil is a preparation and not a specific cut of meat.  When I want to broil something (or grill) for the purpose of across the grain slicing, I like flat iron cuts.  Real tender and tasty.  The marinade was great.  Try adding a little corn syrup or honey. You won't be sorry.

This marinade was good.  I added some lemon juice,ground ginger, crushed red pepper and substituted brown sugar for ketchup.   I broiled this for 5 minutes on each side. Let the meat rest at least 10 minutes before slicing it.  I  would also recommend saving some marinade and pouring it over the cooked meat.

Excellent  non-traditional recipe with good flavor.

@Rachael
I am a professional chef, and did part of my apprenticeship under a true butcher, and there exists no cut of beef called "London Broil", check your NAMP guide. London Broil is a very classic dish made with flank steak, as called for in this recipe. The "London Broil" you refer to, is an invented supermarket cut designed to get rid of hard to sell inferior cuts of beef.

Haven't tried it yet, but am amazed at the reviewers who don't know that flank steak is the original and authentic London Broil. Those thick, top round "London Broil"s that the supermarket sells are a cheaper substitute (since there are only two flanks steaks per steer and you can cut a dozen out of a top round). The Flank steak is very lean and benefits greatly from a marinade. The other thing to remember is to carve thin slices diagonally through the steak.

Ended up marinating London broil for about 30 hours, then broiled it for 6 minutes, turned it over and broiled for another 6 minutes. Served it with baked potatoes (sour cream and chives) and a big green salad. The family verdict was it was perfect exactly as I made it from the recipe. Will definitely get used again.

I used this as a marinade for a normal, tenderloin steak. It was very good- I sort of thought it tasted too much like soy sauce and nothing else- though I suspect the BF raved about it for just that reason.
Either way, it's definitely a great way to jazz up a steak and makes for an easy dinner because you can set it all up in advance and then just throw the meat on the grill.

I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!  The marinade is outstanding...like another reviewer, I bought 3 london broils on sale, marinated them all and froze them in the marinade...thawed one out last weekend and grilled it - takes a while because they're so thick but slice it thin and you've died and gone to heaven...we like our steak pretty red around here   :)))))  Thanks for the recipe!

The first time I made this I marinated overnight and I could not believe how juicy and tender the steak was. Absolutely delicious. Even my father in law who doesn't eat much steak was coming back for seconds. The most recent time recent time I made it, the steak was pretty thick so to be on the safe side I pierced it several times and doubled up on the recipe. It marinated for only 3 hours and it was absolutely delicious. You would think it had been marinated overnight instead of just a couple of hours. Great recipe that's become a family favorite

i made this dish for a bbq we had. After following reviews i let it marinate for 36 hours.  It was definately tastey and pretty tender (even though my hubby accidently overcooked it). After being grilled it looked delicious.   Everyone agreed that it was missing something though.  It needed some sort of sauce.  A friend suggested that it be served in the future with a garlic butter, i think next time i'll boil up the marinade for a steak sauce.  I'll play around with the sauce, but i'll definately make it again.  It was good.

I used this as a starter marinade with some changes. Cut the salt/pepper and used Grill Mates Steak Seasoning instead. Rubbed it on a big juicy Costco sized steak and added a few dashes to the marinade. Then doubled the marinade recipe but cut 1 TBS of soy after doubling. Added 1 TBS of lemon juice and about 6 wrist shakes of Worcestershire sauce. VERY yummy. I can use this on just about any cut of meat. Also, the first time I made this I didn't have a garlic clove so I used crushed garlic in jar.

Absolutely the best marinate I have ever made.
I did add a few dashes of worchestire sauce and a little more garlic to the mixture and some a few drops of tobasco sauce too... And I add a really peppery seasoning like Montreal Steak House seasoning or Rib Eye Steak Seasoning in place of just plain black pepper.
People just rave at the beef taste.

This was a delicious marinade, but you can't make a tough piece of meat tender.  I added 1/4 cup of vinegar to help tenderize the meat as per a suggestion, and the flavor of the meat was excellent, but the cut was tough.  I will make this again with a better cut of meat.

The recipe is correct in being called London Broil and using the cut of flank steak.  Do some research before you accuse someone of something.  "London Broil" reffers to the cooking method.  The cut of beef call "London Broil" should be called a "Top Round Steak"   Haven't made this yet, but I will (with Flank Steak.).

Definitely a nice marinade.  The only addition I added was 2 T. of lemon juice to act as a tenderizer and marinated a full 24 hours.  I only used a 2 lb london broil but didn't cut back on the ingredients. Tender and flavorful!

We thought this was just excellent!  I used a Beef Top Round for London Broil and followed the recipe exactly as written, grilling 3 minutes per side.  It came out perfectly medium rare.  My 2 1/2 year old, who has been a pretty picky eater lately, ate 3 helpings!  My husband couldn't stop eating it!  Fabulous recipe!  This will definitely be in rotation, and am looking forward to making this the next time I have company over!!

I give this 5 stars because of its ease to make just make  the marinade and put it in a zip lock bag and forget it. You can also make it in the oven set temp to 375 insert meat thermometer. and bake to 140. cover with foil for 5 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute. Great recipe!!

The only reason I did not give this 5-stars is because I did not actually try the marinade, but let me say this is definitely the preferred method of cooking a true London Broil. I usually just make mine with salt and fresh cracked pepper. To actually do a slow cooker version of this is WRONG and would be to cook out all of the natural juices and replace them with whatever  artificial sauces, suck as canned and powdered soups... Yuck! Might as well just add a bottle of corn syrup and a whole container of salt! The cooking method here will yield one of the juiciest steaks you will have, just make sure to start with a very hot grill, cook med. rare, and cut thin slices at about a 45 degree angle... mmm, mmm, mmm... so good!

I marinated overnight and like others used olive oil instead of veg oil.  I must say this is the best london broil I have ever had.  I'm going to try the marinade on other meats also.  Awesome!!!!!

I'm beginning to feel guilty about not writing reviews since I read so many of them!  This was quite good.  I put the leftover marinade in a saucepan and boiled it down until it was a rich, thick consistency.  Then I added a splash of red wine and a tablespoon or so of butter to give it a rich and glossy finish.  My husband loved it.  In fact, I am making it again next week with a different cut of meat - on request.  With rolls made from the Amish  White Bread recipe (see this site) and garlic mashed potatoes it is a show stopper!  Thanks.

This was good but not at the top of my list. What I did enjoy was that it reminded me of when my mom grilled london broil and the flavors were very reminiscent. I should've just put some lemon or lime juice in it to add that little bang and help tenderize it but I didn't. It was definitely satisfactory though for this cut of meat. I cooked it to medium-medium well and added to my marinade 1/8 tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp honey, and 2 tsp worchestershire sauce.

Really tasty, one of my favorite dishes! My mom used to make something like this when I was kid. Only differences.. more ketchup, low sodium soy, no oregano, a jar of Saucy Susan peach apricot, no salt (soy is pretty salty), most important a cup of Brown Sugar!  Cook to internal temp of 127 degrees F

The marinade was very good. My only suggestion is check with the meat dept about the tenderest choice. Though my meat was labeled London Broil that world includes a couple different cuts of meat. Mine was a little tough but the marinade was so good there wasn't any leftovers.

The marinade smelled so good and didn't taste as salty as I thought it would. I don't eat red meat, but I always taste and this really gave the london broil a great flavor. My carnivors loved it Jill!

Good taste, but I didn't read down the ingredients far enough to see that you used flank steak and not an actual london broil cut (different things in my store).  The meat tasted good, but was a little tough even after marinating for several hours.  Good marinade.  Will use again.  Thanks for sharing.

Used almost 4 lbs. London broil. Marinated overnight, flipped london broil in the morning when I made my coffee. Exceptional taste! My hus band took it out of the fridge 10 minuets before putting it on the grill, 8 minuets on each side. Loved the taste!

Wish I had read the reviewers who educated us on the difference between london broil and flank steak before I made this.  Nevertheless, the marinade is good - I put it all in a zip-lock bag for 24 hours, massaging  each time I opened the fridge.  No doubt the flank steak would have been more tender - I'll be sure to buy that next time.

We were looking for a yummy marinade to use up a London broil. Most called for balsamic vinegar, and while be love balsamic, we were looking for something different tonight. This blew us away! We were stuffed but couldn't stop eating. 
We followed the marinade recipe but added 1 drop of liquid smoke and 2-3 drops of mexican vanilla extract. 

This is going in our permanent recipe file! Thank you!!!!!

"London Broil" is NOT a cut of meat, it is a METHOD of preparation, most commonly using a flank steak, although many supermarkets have started labeling meat (many times top round) as "London Broil".  Traditionally, the London Broil method involves marinating the meat for a few hours, a sear on high heat, resting and then cutting against the grain.  This is a very good marinate for London Broil. I don't use ketchup, but do add a little honey and splash of orange juice.

Yum! Easy to make and my kids gobbled it up.  What could be better.  I added a touch of worchester sauce.  Also, because I ran out of time I marinated for a shorter period.  It still tasted great.  We broiled.

Re: London broil being a cut of beef.  It's not a cut of beef but a way to marinade and prepare meat.  So its fine to prepare with flank, though flank, to me, is an awesome cut of beef which requires very little.  I generally think of London broil as top round steak, which is tough.  I have seen some butchers label top round steak as london broil, though, because its generally the cut used for this type of recipe.

Oh, yeah! I prepared this marinade as directed with the exception of an extra clove of garlic, because, well, I like garlic just that much. I mixed the ingredients directly into a ziploc bag. I let the meat marinade about 18 hours and cooked it low and slow over charcoal. Cut the steak against the grain and served it with roasted vegetables. I will be doing this again. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Very good traditional London Broil recipe. For thos that do not know, London Broil was originally prepared using flank steak, not top round. London Broil is NOT a cut of meat, although butchers will sometimes call it that. Butchers are also responsible for making the switch from flank to top round and calling a cut of top round 'London Broil'.

I've made this recipe as stated with london broil cut and with several variations of my own and others' recommendations on grill, in oven, or on top of stove.  Our family enjoys any variation I make.  I score meat and mix marinade in a ziploc then add meat, usually allowing 1-4 hours to marinate, longer if time allows. Thanks for sharing recipe!

A very tasty, inexpensive and quick way to tenderize beef.  The first time using this recipe, I only could marinade for 2 1/2 hours - not enough time for the full effect, but still flavorful.

I used this recipe to make a slowcooker roast, I think it turned out great.  Cooked on low for 8 hours.  Will definitely make again and will try with steak in the summer.

Not impressed!  I used a  london broil, marinated it for 24 hours.  It came out way too tangy, won't use it again, I think the bistec encebollado is a much better marinate, I will be stickin with that.

Family loved this!   Couldn't find flank steak anywhere, and the butcher recommended flat iron steak as a replacement.   It was perfect!  Followed recipe exactly, using two 2 pound flat iron steaks, and marinated for 24 hours.  Will be making this one again!

I went with all of Josie's suggestions, add worcheshine, fish sauce and sub chili sauce.  I also added a splash of orange juice and 2 tsp ginger.  I upped the garlic to 2 heaping tsp.....about half a head bc we love garlic.  Wonderful!   Remember to sprinkle with tenderizer when u remove from the fride to settle to room temp, usually a half hour, optherwise the salt draws out the moisture.  I adapted from another recipe a few splashed of tarrago vinegar...mmmmm!  And I stole the blue cheese butter from this site (2oz blue cheese, b1/2 stick of butter, fresh chives....melt together and chill then add 1/4 cup sour cream and serve cool on top) mouthwater!!!  Thanks!

Excellent marinade!  You need to be careful when cooking a London Broil but this recipe really works well.  The longer you marinate, the better.  And the hotter the grill, the better.  I love medium-rare so 5-6 minutes on each side was perfect.  Will definitely make this again!

Been searching for a great steak marinade that I can make at home..and this is wonderful! I used a sirloin steak..almost 2 pounds and marinated it and wrapped in foil for at least 8 hours. Slapped it on the grill for 7 min per side and it was perfect! Husband said it was one of the best steaks he's had in a very long time! Sliced it thin, and served it over a nice salad with blue cheese crumbles and dressing! Yum...I will use this reciped forever..Thanks!

This marinade is fabulous!  I usually cut up my meat in half, make the marinade, split it into two portions, then freeze in two plastic freezer bags.  It thaws nicely and marinades while thawing.  Then grill.  Perfect!

This was wonderful.  I think the soy sauce really tenderizes the meat.  I also used low sodium soy sauce.  I did make some cris-cross cuts in the meat before I marinated.I marinated for about 6 hours.  Very tasty.

All I can say is totally awesome! Used 2 pounds of flank steak and the ingredients for 4 pounds. Perfect!! Then followed the directions to the letter. Except I used the oven broiler. 10 min. on each side (med. rare) And let rest outside of oven covered in foil for 10 min. before slicing. Thanks!!

OK so confused. This recipe uses flank steak not London broil so why is the title london broil? This cut is better suited to braising than BBQ.

Great concept on keeping the marinade in aluminum foil vs. ziploc bag. Next time I will add 2 tsp. brown sugar, 1tsp. worcestershire sauce, use olive oil vs. vegetable oil and add 3Tbsp. of lemon juice as the steak was a little tough and maybe the acidity will help break it down a tad next time. I will also cook mine less--that was my wrongdoing. 5 minutes on both sides seems right. You can also broil ~8 min. on each side in the oven.

Wow! Wow! Wow!  The flavor in this marinate is outstanding.  I now use it on all my cuts of beef.  I've used it on expensive steaks when we had company and everyone was melting in their seats over the taste.  This recipe is by far the best "find" on Allrecipes.

This was a huge hit. I made it exactly as written. We had last minute guests come by and luckily I had it in the fridge because it fed all five people with leftovers.  Everyone raved about it!  Thanks for a great recipes.

Flank steak used is this recipe is ok, but I didn't care for the marinade. Where I live (Western Washington state) a cut of meat called London Broil is readily found in the supermarkets. They are usually cut about 1 1/2 inches to two inches thick. I purchase them once a week, and use in Swiss steak or in a stew I make. The cut does need to be slow cooked for about two or more hours (depending on thickness) so it will be tender and moist. My supermarket also sells flank steak another meat cut that usually requires slow cooking. In this recipe, marinating overnight or for several hours helps make the meat tender for cooking on the grill.

Very Tasty!!! Followed as instructed, but I added 2 T. of lemon juice (to help the meat tenderize) and 1/2 tsp. oreagno. Marinated overnight and cooked on the outdoor grill. So good, had with broccoli & corn on the cob for dinner last night. Very simple, you must give it try.

This is a great recipe.  I actually used London Broil, but added some different ingredients.  I added oyster sauce, worcesterchire sauce, and alittle bit of sugar. I also didn't put any salt in it because soy sauce has plenty. I bbq'd it until itwas medium rare and then sliced it very thin.  My family loved it!

This recipe was pretty good. i didn't have any garlic so i just used a few teaspoons of garlic powder. i used the full recipe, even though i had half the meat but there still wasn't that much of the marinade left. I loved how it didn't take too much time or too many dishes to make.

Fabulous flavor. I grilled it to med rare. Next time will make extra marinade and set aside. Warm and dip the thin sliced meat in before serving.

This marinade is a family favorite.  It is best if the london broil is marinaded overnight.  So simple and so great.  We use this on chuck eyes too.

This is terrific, the best London Broil I have ever tasted.  I had tried other marinades, but this is the best!  I had doubled the ingredients because I had a bigger piece of beef, and I marinated it for 6 hours in a 9x13 baking dish and turned it every so often, then grilled it.  It turned out so yummy!!    Thanks!!

This marinade was able to tenderize the meat really well since I didn't have the cut of meat for London Broil I used it on three sirloin steaks and they came out really good. As for taste I think it needed a little more garlic but the family really liked it.

Great marinade.  As I was mixing this up I was not very impressed.  However it is wonderful right off the grill.  I didnt have soy sauce, so I used terriaki (sp?) sauce and I did add brown sugar.  Great flavor!  First time I have ever cooked london broil and the family loved it.  Thanks!

This a superb recipe, i did add a little brown sugar to the ingredients, and scored the meat, marinated in for 24 hours and threw it on the grill. the meat was tender and tasted wonderful, everyone raved about it. I threw an extra one in the freezer with the marinate in a zip lock bag to have on hand. This is make it into me recipe binder.

Delicious.  My steak was alot smaller (1 1/2 lbs for 2 people) but i used the same amount marinade. Very flavorful and scoring the meat really helped to be more tender.

Delicious marinade! I inly had time to marinade for 3 hours, but it still tasted great, I look forward to making it again and allowing it to marinade longer. I used the whole recipe for a smaller size of meat, and it seemed like a perfect amount (we like things saucy and with lots of flavor). Also, we don't have a barbque so I just put this in the broiler.

Used this on a 2lb piece of london broil and marinated for 8hrs. Broiled it for about 13 minutes per side and it came out full of flavor, nice and crispy on the outside and pink in the middle!! Outstanding flavor and tenderness!! :)

This was my first time cooking London Broil, and let me tell you, this marinade was outstanding.  I added more garlic than the recipe called for, and also added red wine to the ingredients.  Put the steak and marinade in a Ziploc bag and let it sit in the fridge for 48 hours (turning the bag over several times).  I broiled it for 8 minutes per side for perfect medium rare.  The meat was so tender and moist.  I'm using the leftovers in a salad tonight.  Yum!

Sorry I can't join in with the majority who said what a great marinade, but it added very little taste.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The Asian Barbequed Steak recipe on this site is so much better.

Amazing! I have never had luck with this cut of meat before, since it was on sale I thought I would give it one more try with a new recipe and what do you know....IT WAS AMAZING!! Great flavor...I added extra garlic and used a 3 lb. cut of meat. Thanks for sharing!

We don't have an outdoor grill, so I used a cast iron grill pan over medium high heat, 7 minutes one side, 5 minutes the other.  It was quite rare, yet delicious.  Next time we will do 8 minutes each side.  Husbot enjoyed the marinade, and didn't add any condiments at all.  He said it was "bold".  I added some vidalia onion hot sauce to the marinade (about 2 Tbsp) after reading that someone had added Tabasco.  I would recommend this, we were very pleased.  We will make this for company.  I am usually a flop at cooking roasts, other "solid meat" dishes, but there are a few on Allrecipes that have really come through, I am learning how.  Thanks Jill and Allrecipes!

Great flavor!  I used on a very think cut of london broil and flavor just seemed to go throughout the entire cut.  Very easy to make.  I cooked mine under the broiler for 7 minutes each side for a rare.  Husband likes his medium so next time I might flip the meat a few times and cook longer.

This is the best London Broil marinade
I've found yet!  I have used it with the
cheapest London Broil you can find, score
it as recommended in the recipe, but 
I rub it before the marinade with meat
tenderizer, then the marinade.  Excellent!

The marinade was wonderful, my family really liked that.  What they didn't like was the meat I chose.  I've only been cooking for a week so I don't know how to pick meat, I did it based on looks.  I obviously did it wrong, experience will help I suppose .

This recipe was amazing. The only thing I suggest is cutting down on the salt because it calls for soy sauce,maybe even leave it out all together. Not sure why it calls for both but that's my opinion. But tasty overall and will recommend with that opinion.

I've used this marinade at least 6-7 times and it IS amazing. I'm addicted to it! The only difference is I double the garlic and use a press. I also add about an extra 1/2 tsp of the pepper.

We just finished this and WOW!  Hubby said it may have been the best meat I have ever cooked...and he wouldn't say that lightly!  I marinated for about a day and a half. Only changes I made were I added a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice and lots of minced garlic. I grilled over charcoal and my temp was a steady 300-325. I think the low and slow cooking really made it tender. I took off just at about 140 degrees and let sit for 15-20 minutes. Perfection!!

This was great, the only change is that I would cut the salt to 1/2.  I feel that there was enough salt in the soy sauce to give it flavor.  Yum!

Awesome and easy marinade.  I put all the ingredients in a gallon size freezer bag, swished them to blend, and then put the meat in.  Worked the marinade around it and tossed in the fridge, turning every now and then.  Leftover steak is great on salad with a vinaigrette dressing.

Excellent use of flank steak. Made entire marinade for 2.5 pound steak and it was delicious. Probably would double marinade for a four pound steak.

I make this all the time with the addition of crushed red pepper and a tablespoon of honey. My kids love this dish and the leftovers sliced thinly are great over a salad the next day.

Okay, I have to admit, I was skeptical.  The marinade seemed very salty when I put it together, and I'm not big on salty.  But OMG is this good!  I seared the meat on both sides for 6 minutes to get my grill lines, then in the oven at 300 for 30 minutes.  My roast was very thick, 3-4 inches, so a low temp slow cook greatly helped keep it moist.

Thanks a bunch for this.

This was really good.  I used olive oil because I didn't have vegetable but rest was as written.  I left it in fridge in marinade all day long and it was cooked on a charcoal grill.  It was so yummy I couldn't keep my 8 year old son from going back over and over again.  Will use this again.

I loved, loved, loved this marinade.  I followed recipe but did add about 1 Tbsp. Worcestershire & the juice of 1 lemon & the zest.  Yum!  I want to mention too that the confusion about flank steak vs. London Broil.  Flank steak is the cut of meat, London Broil is a method of cooking flank steak.  Most London Broil recipes call for the thin cut of steak to be rolled and cut like a pinwheel and broiled (sometimes stuffed).  This really is just a recipe for marinated flank steak, not a true London Broil.  Still Yummy whatever it's called :)

Made this yesterday and was was pleasantly surprised at how tender and juicy this turned out. I only had an almost two pound london broil but used the marinade for a four pound and marinaded for about ten hours. I grilled for nine minutes per side and it was amazing but will use more garlic next time. Thanks for a great recipe! Almost forgot. I also added three tablespoons of lemon juice and three tablespoon of worcestershire sauce.

You can grill the meat as set forth above but I usually just roast at 350 degrees for 25 minutes instead (since I don't have a grill).  Kirk

I have always shied away from flank steak, because I had no idea what to do with it.  I now know what to do!  This recipe was spot on, and I did follow it to the "T".  I was only able to marinate it for about 4 hours, but it turned out amazing.  I had guests for dinner, and grilled chicken as a backup....untouched!  We all gobbled the steak, and I sent my friends home with the recipe.  Thank you, Jill , for this delicious recipe!

Mixed the marinade as listed except omitted the veg. oil.  Poured over the top of my frozen 1.5 lb London Broil.  I cooked it in a crockpot instead of the grill.  Cooked it for 5-6 hours and it was tender and delicious.  The meat had plenty of flavor, but still added A-1 because I love it. Served with baked potatoes, yellow squash, and asparagus with a mock hollandaise sauce.  Delicious! This one is definitely a keeper.

Used a 1.5 lb London Broil roast.  Marinated overnight.  Too cold to bbq so cooked in oven at 500 for 15 minutes.  Turned off oven and let it sit til hubby got home (about 45 minutes).  Delicious!

Made the recipe exactly as is and marinated overnight (we did forget to flip the meat every few hours).  My london broil was cooked to be well done because I simply do not care for rare or medium rare and prefer medium well to well done.  My meat  was sliced fairly thin.  My husband cooked his to about medium rare, but he did not slice all of his as thin as my pieces were.  His meat seemed somewhat tough and mine seemed tender.  He did like my london broil better, but thinks if he would have sliced his thinner, it would not have seemed somewhat on the "chewy" side.  We will be making this recipe again!

I love this recipe.  I've used it many times now.  I've tweaked it to where I add some rice vinegar, some lime juice (was out of lemon, but lime seems to work great),  a healthy amount of sodium free smoke sauce, cayenne pepper and a little bit (like 1/2 tsp) of habanero sauce.  The habanero doesn't make it real spicy, but man it adds flavor.  I skip the foil and go with the ziploc bag, much less messy.  Just try to flip it now and then.  Also, probably the most important, I save a little bit of the marinade (kept separate from beef) and brush it on the top of the roast when put on the grill.  Oh...and I would do this marinade overnight.  No gravy required!

I have made this many times for company and everyone raves about it.  A little on the salty side.  I use only London Broil.  Adding lemon juice is a nice addition.  We like it very rare and use the leftovers for steak sandwiches.

This was a great marinade!  I will definately use it again!  I love garlic, so I added more!  I broiled a 2.5 lb london broil on the top rack for 7 min on each side and got a perfect medium rare.  The well done ends were great too!

I liked the taste of everything, we had it with baked potato and broccoli and I thought all the flavors went well together when eaten in the same bite. But my husband thought it was too ketchupy. The difference between us is he likes to taste the steak more than the sauce and I am the opposite.

I have always been my own biggest critic, but this was unreal.  By and far THE BEST marinade/steak I've ever put in my mouth.  Shame I can only give 5 stars.  At 5 stars, it remains highly underated.

This has a wonderful flavor and tenderizes the meat. When making london broil I always make it medium and then slice it real thin against the grain. This marinade made it so the meat was even tender when cut in more thick slices. Very flavorful!

Delish!  I added a bit of red wine vinegar as a tenderizer, and then also basted some portabellas and cut veggies to grill. Fantastic!

I thought this was a great marinade that would work well for flank steak as well as London broil.  I found it a little salty, might cut back on the salt next time since there's already soy sauce in it.  I did add a Tbs. of red wine vinegar to add some brightness, and I would do that again for sure.  Solid recipe.

Nice easy recipe.  Let marinate overnight.  Nice for a quick meal with a salad.  I would pound the steak 1st if you are using london broil.  Remember it is more tender if you cook it medium rare.

I increased the garlic, omitted the oregano and added about 2 tsp. lemon juice.  I only marinated for 24 hours and then grilled on our GF grill.  Tender and juicy, and super simple!  Love that these simple ingredients are always in my house.

I used 2 tbs low salt soy sauce and 1 tbsp teriyaki marinade.  Still way too salty for us, must be the teriyaki sauce.  Otherwise, very good.

Used chuck roast steaks, pierced with fork, put in zip lock bag and added marinade.  Turned out very tender.

Will try again.

I made the marinade following the recipe as written, and let it marinate for about 22 hours.  I grilled it over a medium flame for 7 minutes on each side.  The flavor was outstanding.  All the ingredients blended wonderfully, and nothing stood out above the rest.   I used London Broil - Top Round.  The meat came out more tender than I would have normaly expected, but I wouldn't consider it overly tender even though I sliced it as thin as possible, and across the grain.  I will definately use this marinade again, but I will probably try a different cut meat.  I highly recommend this marinade.

I made this tonight.  I marinated for almost 8 hours.  While my kids loved the flavor of the meat, I didn't care too much for it.  I think the taste resembled the homemade tomato sauce that I put on meatloaf.  I will try this again while tweaking the spices.  I hope that it will have a more pleasing taste for me.

This was a pretty tasty marinade.  I reduced the salt and it was still a bit too salty for our family.  We did not find that the meat was tender enough, but maybe we'll try a different cut of meat.

great recipe - this marinade softens and flavors the meat but doesn't overpower it.  i substituted the ketchup for chimichuri sauce, marinated the meat in a ziplock bag for a few hours, and then broiled it for 12 minutes on each side.  my husband and i loved it.  will definitely be making this again!

Rachel the top reviewer is actually mistaken (as butchers often are when they mislabel  top round roast/steak as London Broil).   London broil is not a cut of meat, it is a method of preparation and it is very traditional to use flank steak as this recipes advises.   This was absolutely delicious.   I will make it again.

I give this recipe 5 stars. It's a definite staple now in my kitchen. The first time I made this I didn't have much time to marinate the meat and whether I marinated it for a few hours or not it still was delicious!! I would definite reccomend this recipe to others to change up the normal london broil meal!!

This was awesome!  Added a little extra garlic, half and half ketchup and BBQ sauce, and also used olive oil instead of veg oil.  Had read a lot of posts about adding an acid, so I put in some rice vinegar and Sherry cooking wine.  It was a great meal.

Because we were tired of Turkey left overs we grilled this last night for dinner.  Oh my goodness it was good.  I made as is because I don't believe in rating a dish I've made changes too.  We will make this again and again.

Marinated the london broil for 48 hours. I did use olive oil and a splash of white wine vinegar as someone suggested. Great marinade. We are going to try it on a tri-tip too. I made additional sauce to use to reheat the piece we had left over. Yummy!

Ok, I'm a vegan but my husband and kids still eat meat, so I decided to make this for them. I couldn't try it, obviously, but I can tell you the reaction of my family.  They had second and third helpings, my son had four helpings!  My daughter said, "Always make this kind of steak, don't make any other kind, ever"! My husband said that he really didn't even need a steak knife.  Also, I did add lemon juice squeezed from one lemon as suggested by other reviewers.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious! I made the marinade as stated in the recipe only used an actual London Broil (1 3/4 lb). I broiled in my oven for 30 minutes until it was cooked to medium well. It was perfect...definately didn't have to use steak sauce! Will make this one again~huge hit for everyone in the family

did not have soy sauce so i used worchester, and i used a slow cooker instead. Other then that I did everything that the recipe said I added some beef broth in the crock pot (1 can) and cooked on low for about 5 hours. And yes, exactly as your thinking "it was falling off the forks". Delicious. The last 30 min. i added sliced onions and bell peppers.

Excellent!  The meat was tender and flavorful, and the marinade was very easy to prepare.  I made no changes to this recipe at all.

This recipe is awesome!  I grew up on tough, leathery, tasteless london broil so I do not like it.  This marinade makes this inexpensive cut of beef taste fabulous!  We had it twice in one week!  No leftovers either time!

My husband loves this! I used 3 Tbsp ketchup and no soy sauce due to food allergies, and I make it indoors in the broiler, which takes longer than the recipe calls for. I usually broil first and then finish a bit longer by baking at 350 degrees.

I didn't cook it as suggested, but I used the marinade. I left out the ketchup as my boyfriend thought it wouldn't add anything good to the recipe. It was a big hit with all the family over. A few asked for the recipe. I didn't know I was supposed to prepare the meat until about an hour before it was cooked so it didn't marinade long...maybe about an hour. Still very flavorful.

I have a marinade recipe for London Broil that I've used for years but this one is WAY better. Everyone who has tried it raves. Absolutely the best. Highly recommended!

Super Easy!  I didn't have soy sauce so i made the marinade with worcestershire, which made it a bit strong, but it was still delicious. I marinated 8 hours and broiled 7 mins per side, which was too much; next time i will do 6 minutes a side and i think that will be perfect. Served over spinach and tomatoes as a salad.

Sooo easy! I read my 17 year old daughter the recipe over the phone from work an hour before I came home, and she put it together herself and threw it on top, and it still came out excellent. I am always looking for a good steak marinade- I think I found my "go to" recipe!

I tried this last night and broiled the steak in the over for 15 min. on each side. I marinaded the meat over night and it was delicious. It wasn't tough like I thought it might have been. I was very surprised and the taste was out of this world. My husband who is a meat man really loved it, he ate 3 helpings and wants sandwiches tonight. He is not a left-over kind of guy, so that says alot for this recipe. Thanks for sahring a wonderful recipe.

I thought I completely runied this recipe when I started to make it for dinner when I realized I didn't marinate overnight. I prepared myself for the meat to be bland but NOPE it was soooo good. I marinated it for like 15minutes and it was amazing!!!!! This was my first time making a london broil and I want to make it again this weekend! Whole Foods has the best cuts of meat...this was DELICIOUS!

FANTASTIC MARINADE! NEX TIME I'LL USE LEMON JUICE TO HELP TENDERIZE THE LONDON BROIL, EVEN THOUGH I SUBSTITUTED ADOLPH'S FOR SALT. I'LL PROBABLY USE CHARCOAL GRILL, NOT GAS, TOO.

I don't cut meat for a living, but I DO know that London Broil is NOT a cut of meat, but a method in which you prepare a cheap cut of meat. I.E.:flank steak.

This is really a great marinade just with some minor touches. As other users stated I also added fresh squeezed lemon about 2tbs and worcestershire sauce a little less than 1 tbs. I also added about 4 cloves of garlic, we're big garlic fans here!
The taste was great. Came out perfect. I also broiled mine. Will definitely use this recipe again!

I just have to say that London Broil is not a type of meat, its the method of cooking.  Most London Broil recipes call for a Top Round cut of meat.  So those of you who can't find a London Broil cut of meat, that's why.  I just finished making the marinade and am giving this a try tonight.  The marinade smells great.  Can't wait to taste this and give it a proper rating.

Tender and tasty.  Would try a bit more garlic or lemon juice to tenderize the meat.

Family loved it though!

I must admit that I was skeptical about this recipe, but it came out WONDERFUL!  I did make a few changes as others had suggested and added about 2-3 Tbls of Lemon juice (to tenderize the meat) and 2-3 tsp of worchestershire sauce.  I let it sit for about 7 hrs and then cooked it on the grill… it was fantastic!  And Daniel is right, you don’t need the steak sauce – Thanks for the great recipe!

You have to try this, it is the best..we will look no more. I used a 3 lb London Broil, only additions I made was 2 T each of lemon juice and worsch sauce, only 1/2 t salt. Marinated overnight and grilled on low for about 40 minutes. Taste was wonderful and tender.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!!! FANTASTIC!!! I doubled the recipe b/c my steak was almost 4 inches thick but I followed the recipe exactly and my steak was even partly frozen but I sealed it up in the foil and let it soak for about 5 hours and my hubby cooked it on the grill when he got home from work. This was so good my husband was dipping his bites in the juices that were in the serving plate. LOL Did I mention this recipe is FANTASTIC?

OMG....This was so good! My husband and son just raved over it and asked for it to be made weekly! It was too cold to grill, so after marinading for 6 hours, I seared both sides and then put it in the oven for 25 minutes. It was medium which is the way we like it. I removed the meat from the pan and let it rest 15 minutes. After resting, I sliced the meat very thin. I reduced the pan drippings to make a thick glaze and poured that over the meat. Yummy!!

Excellent!  This is one of the best steak recipes I've had in a while!  The ketchup mixture is very tasty.  Since my bbq is covered with 2 feet of snow, I broiled the steak in the oven for about 5 minutes on each side and it turned out great.  I will definitely follow this recipe again.

I used Tri Tip instead of London Broil and I only got a 2lb piece but used the recipe as is for 4 lbs. I let it marinade for about 5 hours. It was horribly windy here last week when I made this so I put it in the oven on 425 uncovered for about 25 minutes. Then I pulled it out, covered it and let it sit for about ten minutes. It was amazing, the marinade only tenderized it and allowed the delicious flavor of the meat to come out. Served it with the Baked Potato Casserole from this site...thanks for sharing.

Very good flavor.  I ended up having it marinate for over 2 days due to scheduling issue and it was a little salty.  I would suggest definitely low sodium soy sauce.  But the meat was very tender.

Easy and tasted good. I used london broil, marinated for 24 hours, and broiled 12 minutes per side. It wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped but it was tender enough. Next time I will rub the meat with ground black pepper and take the advice of one of the reviewers by using 1.5 T of soy sauce and 1.5 T of Worcestershire. Maybe that will add more flavor.

This was wonderful, the flavors were great and it was a nice way to make a cut of meat that I never prepared before.  I had a larger cut so I doubled the marinade but followed the recipe as written.  My family really enjoyed it and I will make again.

well... I was pretty excited after reading the reviews but made the mistake of not taking everyone's advice on adding meat tenderizer... the meat was so tough it took an hour to become tender! so much for the grill :-) the marinade came out tasting good though.. pretty steak-saucish.. but this recipe *definitely* has the tenderizer missing!

My boyfriend and son liked more than I did, but it was good. I doubled the garlic and marinaded >24 hours, but would recommend a very fresh cut of london broil. We defrosted ours, kind of lacking the full juicy flavor. Thanks -- will be adding to my recipe box.

This is the best London broil recipe I've found, but it still isn't good enough to make all that often.  Nice for a change of pace, but not one of my treasured recipes.

This recipe is delicious, my husband loved it.  The only problem with it is that we needed to double the quantity for the marinade.  And this was for a steak that was less than 2 pounds (recipe said 4 pounds).  Otherwise, it was not fully coated.  Other than that, delicious!

This was the best marinade I've EVER tasted for beef! The meat came out a little bit tough, so I think next time I'll use a more tender cut of beef, but the taste was just AWESOME! It would be a great marinade for steaks too.

Very good marindade!  I marinated the london broil for only a short time, but the flavor was still great and it made a normally dry beef, pretty tender.  Thanks!

My family loved it!!  I have even forwarded it onto friends and they loved it!!  I did omit the salt because of the soy sauce in it and there was no lack of taste.  Also, I was a little hesitant to add the oregano but glad I did.  It added a subtle flavor that was wonderful!  Thanks Jill for a great recipe

I was never a fan of london broil but my husband loves it.  Last summer I found this recipe and I LOVE IT!!  The longer you marinate the meat, the better.  It is so tasty and the meat always turns out tender, even well done.  People who are not "beef" eaters ask for this recipe at all my BBQ's.  Try it, it's a sure hit.  I even tried this with chicken as a stirfry recipe and its great there too, just don't marinate it for longer than 1/2 hour.  Good luck and enjoy!

This was a last minute dinner so only marinated it for about 3 hours, then cooked this under the broiler instead of on the grill; 4” away from broiler for 5 to 6 minutes per side. Roasted some potatoes and carrots with rosemary to go along with it and had a delicious meal. It was amazing; definitely on our family menu!

I've made this a half a dozen times and it's always been awesome. We remember the first time we made it and we were amazed what simple ingredients could do, very cool. I've learned not to mess with the ingredient ratios either because it's not the same as the first time.

I made this marinade but doubled it for 2 London broils that were almost 5 lbs. together. I put one in each zip lock bag with half of the marinade (which is really one batch of the recipe). The only things I did differently is that I added lemon juice because I had read it in the reviews instead of meat tenderizer, and added fresh chopped garlic. FANTASTIC!

This was good, but it was a little too salty.  I was already using reduced sodium soy sauce, and if I make this again, I'll skip the extra salt.

Very good London Broil recipe. I didn't change a thing, marinated overnight and cooked on grill, high heat, 5 minutes on each side. Definitely a keeper.

This is a good marinade.  I used Worcestershire in place of Soy Sauce by accident,  I kinda of lean towards that flavor.  All though soy is good also.

I've used this recipe at least 10 times and everyone loves it! My only change was to double the garlic as we really love garlic. I won't use store-bought marinade again.

Quick easy and delicious. Used tomato paste instead if ketchup due to availability.  Marinaded overnight.  Experimented with bread crumbs on half the meat.  Will use again!

I had never done London Broil before. I probably scored it a little deeper than suggested, and marinated it in my FoodSaver marinator (it only takes an hour or so in that). We couldn't eat enough of it. No leftovers here!

I love London Broil and this recipe works great for me, with only slight changes.The salt and soy sauce together made it a little too salty for my taste, so I didn't add salt the second time I made it. I also love spice, so I added a little extra pepper and oregano.

Wow. Made this for Christmas dinner. I used 3 gorgeous sirloins instead of flank meat.  Marinaded the steaks overnight about 16 hours. Very good flavor. I would recommend the recipe.

My entire family loves this (including those that don't usually like steak). We've been making it for years and it's a hit every single time. It's easy, has great flavor, and it's just as good cold the next day as it is hot off the grill.

I prepare this dish exactly as directed albeit with a slightly smaller cut off meat, usually. Before this,  it was quite difficult to get my children to eat steak of any sort.  This recipe however is on  both of their "favourites"  lists now and we make it at least monthly. 

I usually marinate the steak for a day and a half/overnight and cook to medium rare,  letting it sit for 5 minutes after grilling before cutting and serving.

Although I wasn't prepared for marinating overnight, initially, the extra time is well worth the effort. Marinated overnight, cooked on the barbecue grill, & was absolutely amazed at the depth of flavor. This was so succulent. The meat was tender enough to tear apart by hand. Wonderful recipe! We used the leftover meat in a stir fry, which was amazing.

This turned out really good.  We liked the flavor a lot.  No steak sauce needed!  They did not have flank steak at my market so I had to settle for some kind of Beef Round Steak or something.  I halved the recipe for the amount of meat but still used one clove of garlic.  I also added some meat tenderizer instead of the salt b/c I was afraid of tough meat.  Marinated it over night in a resealable bag.  I might try adding a tsp. of lemon juice next time or at least cook it till still pink b/c it was overcooked some which makes it tougher.  Will definitely make this again!  Even my picky 7 year old daughter ate some.  2nd time everyone liked again.   Didn't add the lemon juice and made sure to take it of the grill earlier.  5-6 min per side.

This recipe didn't work for me at all. I had high hopes since everyone raved about it, but it didn't taste like anything! I started marinating it around lunch time the day before so it had plenty of time (around 30 hours!) for the flavors to come out, but they didn't. It was a total bust for me, but I'm glad it's working for other people!

Great recipe ! I lightly pounded the London Broil, cut it with the grain into 1"  strips, and dumped meat and marinade into a gallon zip lock bag and squeezed out the air. Used kosher salt instead of regular to aid in brining effect. Every piece had the crusty "end piece" taste! Charcoal grilled with Pecan Wood chip smoke. Heaven !

I would give this 10 stars if I could. Planned on using London broil cut but hubby came back with flank steak. I didn't change anything in the recipe and it was absolutely delicious. Had enough for leftovers the next day and got raves from family on both days! Will be perfect for entertaining this summer! LOVE this.

Yum!! Garlicky, salty, very flavorful!!! However, this is not a "rub", so I doubled it (and added extra garlic.  Try the frozen chopped garlic at Trader Joe's--it's excellent) and used it as a marinade.  I tried to cook my hunk of meat in the crock pot, as mentioned in a different LB recipe, and that did not turn out so well.  Still very tough.  Nothing against this recipe, just sharing my experience.  I also made another batch and put a second hunk of meat in a large ziploc and tossed it in the freezer. Loved this!

First time I have done a London broil and it turned out great.  I doubled the marinade and thick sliced on onion in the ziplock the meat and sauce.  Put in the refrig for an hour then broiled it and the onions.  Turned out wonderful.  Will make it again.  Only thing I added was a bit of red pepper flakes and a few shakes of Montreal Steak seasoning.  It's a keeper!

Used 2 flank steaks and doubled the marinate and overnight them.  Great flavor.  Scoring the steak makes a big difference.  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

I've made this twice, and both times amazing!  Once under the broiler, and once on a charcoal grill, and delicious both ways. The second time I made it I doubled the recipe, and it ended up a little salty (and normally I'm a salt lover who can't get enough).  I would recommend making the marinade with low sodium soy sauce and half the salt, then tasting it before adding it to meat.

Very flavorful Marinade. I added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to break down some of the toughness. Great on the grill. Will use this as part of my marinade rotation.

Great recipe.  As the article said, it isn't what I would consider London Broil, as I come from Canada.  Fantastic recipe none the less.  I substituted Lea & Perrins worcestershire sauce for the soya.  Also, to cut down on the marinade time I put it in a vacuum for an hour.  I have a side burner high intensity sear zone on the Barbie, and that just added to the finished product.  Definitely making this again.  

I like to buy my meat in bulk, marinate and vacuum seal, so all I have to do is defrost and cook.  Real time saver.

I like that this is such an easy marinade I use a ziplock baggie to mix my marinade in and push out the air so the meat was really being infused with all the flavors I added worsh sauce as well and kept the oil out and this was the first time I have made a steak type food and my daughter did not request steak sauce! Love it! I will definitely be using this again!

I don't do well with steaks but this was great! Can't wait to try it again.  It is January and COLD outside so I broiled this in the oven. It turned out GREAT!

Very salty ! Next time I'll cut the salt and add brown sugar. I was looking for a "London Broil" recipe that is close to the one served in IHOP restaurants but this isn't it.

This was a great way to make a blah cut of meat really moist and tasty while still having a great steak taste.

Marinated actual top sirloin london broil for about 28 hours and cooked on the grill.  Very tender, very tasty, will definitely be a keeper in our family!

A+.  I improvised knowing my family's tastes... used 3 large cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoons of ketchup, lite soy & dropped the salt, everything else the same.... big hit around the table.  I will never grill another un-scored London broil.  This will be a regular.

The flavor was great but I was a bit confused between the two cuts of meat: london broil and skirt steak (which it lists in the recipe). I used the london broil and it came out great but the cooking time was definitely longer so make sure you have a thermometer.

This is a great basic marinade. I switched out the ketchup for chili sauce for a bit more kick. Also doubled the quantity. Broiled it for eight minutes per side, basting each side with the marinade prior to broiling,  then finished it off on the grill two minutes per side. My husband thought it was too tough but everyone else loved it. Plan to make it again but using a thinner (flank steak) cut. Also I only marinaded it for about six hours. I think overnight for dinner the next day would work great.

I thought this was very good.  It was my first attempt at making a London Broil and I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The marinade was very flavorful - I might add a teeny bit more garlic (just because I LOVE garlic).  I had a little bit left over and ate it cold the next day on some greens for lunch - it was even better.

This was delicious!! I added lemon juice to the marinade and let it sit for almost 12 hours. I cooked it in the broiler, 8 minutes on each side, like another user suggested, and it turned out perfect!! Will definitely do this one again. :)

Excellent!  It was a lazy night last night, and I didn't feel like scoring the meat - so I punched a bunch of holes in it with a fork, and tossed it all in a gallon ziplock bag, mashed it around and let it do its stuff!  Tonight I jacked the heat on the BBQ to 550 degrees and seared both sides for a minute, lowered the temp to medium and cooked it for 8 minutes a side and then let it rest off the fire for another 10 minutes - it was perfect!  All in all - it was very simple, very quick and better than our local steak house!  Rock on!

This was DELICIOUS!  Tender, juicy, melt-in-your-mouth perfect.  Next time we will double the marinade because we really liked the 'sauce'.  The only substitution we made was to add jarred garlic instead of fresh garlic- no big deal.  We will certainly be having this often!

Excellent!  Doubled the marinade and marinated 24 hours in a zip lock bag. Used 2+ lb london broil. Grilled perfectly,  juicy and we loved this marinade!  No need to change a thing.  I also saved the leftover marinade and brought that to a boil and it reduced a bit so it was thicker like a sauce.  Drizzled that over the sliced meat ....so good! Served with grilled asparagus and salad. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Has potential but didn't come out great. The flavoring was good so it might just be the choice of meat cut. I think I'll try something a little more tender.

This recipe changed my mind about this cut of meat.  I've never cook it before, thinking it would be too tough to enjoy.  So with some trepidation I put the ingredients together.  The result was a cut of meat that was tender and oh so delicious!!   I used meat tenderizer in place of the salt and added Tabasco.  I rubbed the marinade into the meat that was scored into a diamond patten, put it into a zip lock plastic bag and marinaded it for 2 hours.  I grilled it to a medium rare, then sliced it against the grain into thin slices.  I like another review about making several packages and freezing them for future dinners.  This will be a regular meal of mine from now on.

Amazing!  The only change I made was to add a couple of shakes of Worchestershire sauce to the marinade.  Marinated it for ~6 hours, and grilled it to medium. It was extremely juicy and the flavor was outstanding!  This is a real keeper!

Wow! What a great marinade!   The Italian in me made a some very minor changes.  I used 4 cloves of fresh garlic and used Extra virgin olive oil in lieu of vegetable oil. Marinated it for a full day.   I couldn't bring myself to sharing much with the dogs, the poor souls, it was too good! LOL I saved the balance to bring to lunch tomorrow

Good flavor easy to prepare, makes a tough cut of meat tender and tasty. I only marrinated a couple of hours and it might be even better if the meat had more time to absord the flavors. I would however not make any changes to this recipe. Very good.

I marinated for more than 24 hours, and added 1 tbsp of lemon juice as per a suggestion from another reviewer. This smelled great cooking, and it tasted fine, but I still wanted steak sauce. I'll probably make this again but I'll have to tweak it a bit--maybe red wine as others have suggested.

Did it exactly as the recipe said, and it was very good. I might try a bit of lemon juice as a tenderizer next time, as one reviewer mentioned, but this was definitely a keeper.

This turned out GREAT! Another member had mentioned that London broil is not made with flank steak...this is not correct according to definition (listed is Merriam-Webster). I just thought I'd correct that:     Lon·don broil  Pronunciation:     \'l?n-d?n-\  Function:     noun  Etymology:     London, England Date:     1902  : a boneless cut of beef (as from the shoulder or flank) usually served sliced diagonally across the grain

This is an excellent recipe for marinated London broil. London broil is my favorite meat for grilling at home. I prefer a cut of choice top round beef that is 2.5 inches to 3.0 inches thick. If the open meat display does not have such a cut, ask the meat cutter to prepare one for you. If you do not like rare to medium rare meat, London broil is not recemmended. The addition of 0.5 to 1.0 cup of good red wine (e.g. a good pinot noir) will enhance the effect of the marinade. I usually grill the London broil for 3 minutes on each side. The end result is hopefully not  greater than rare. The cooked meat is allowed to rest for at least 5 to 10 minutes for its juices to congeal. The meat should be cut in thin slices (about 0.25in.) at 90 degrees to its grain - at times the grain can be difficult to determine. I prefer an electric knife. Left overs will make delicious sandwiches. There is virtually no waste with London Broil.

While the meat was tender I really have to say I didn't care for the taste of the marinade. It smelled great but the taste was odd. Not like any steak sauce I've had.

PS. You will see "Flank Steak" (belly meat) or "London Broil" (top or bottom round) Not the same meat or flavor.  Always serve the round at medium rare or less.  In a pinch you can use flap meat (my personal favorite).

This was excellent.  Very easy to make, I had to double up on the marinade for about 5 lbs of meat.  I was able to buy London Broil on sale for $1.99lb - it was excellent. Unbelievably good for that price.

Absolutely the best London Broil I have ever had.  I cooked it medium rare on the grill and it was juicy, flavorful and browned a very nice color.

I added a few tablespoons of worcestershire sauce & a couple teaspoons of lemon juice as per other reviews.  I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil as well.  Grilled on my grill pan about 5 mins on each side and it turned out wonderful.

This truly was a delicious steak. I usually don't care for London Broil because they are tasteless and tough. I made two additions to this recipe because of what I read here. I added 3T of lemon juice and 1T of worcestershire sauce. Perfect. I let if marinade 24 hours in the fridge. Because our steak was only about 2 pounds, it was much thinner than the one in this recipe but I found that 10 minutes on each side on the grill was perfect. Not a bite leftover. This is a permanent addition to our house. Love it!!!

this was fantastic! i used all the ingredients plus added about 3 or 4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce and instead of grilling, i cooked in crock pot all day. adding about 3c. beef stock and 1c. water (to cover my 2 lb roast) it fell apart that night for dinner, just as tender and tasty as ever! FANTASTIC!

WOW what a great tasting london broil!  I was not able to do mine on the grill (WI) weather you know.  But i did all the marinade and poed some holes so it would really get the flavor and then I wrapped it in oil to keep all the taste in and coked it 350 for about 1/2 hour! Perfect!  Love it!

Awesome marinade!  I didn't have time to marinade for the full 5-6 hours.  I can't imagine how amazing the flavor would have been if I had.  This is a definate keeper. My boys are already begging for a repeat performance.  They know I never make the same thing twice within a month's time.  I will probably break the rule on this one, though.

We had a warm spell, so I grilled this last night.  My entire family loved it and there were no leftovers, although it would be spectacular on top of salad.  I added a little bit of lemon juice and allspice as others have recommended.  Thank you for the great and economical recipe!

This is an awesome recipe!! I didn't have time to marinate it for long so I took a reviewers advice and used 3T lemon juice to help tenderize the meat. I served it with baked potatoes and a quick salad. My family thought it was soooo good. I plan on making it again only marinating it overnight.

So simple and so good! I didn't add lemon juice as many suggested because the acid in the catsup was enough to tenderize the meat.  Made recipe as is. I marinated  a little more than 24 hrs and not too salty. Good with or without dippin sauce (dipping sauce was more sauce with a bit of dry mustard and a pinch of sugar added).

Delicious - - my family loved it.  I added a LOT more garlic, doubled the amount of ketchup, and added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.  I also omitted the salt because of the soy sauce.  I made two batches of marinade for 4 lbs of meat and grilled the meat over mesquite wood chips.  It was delicious and I'll make it again, but  perhaps with a more tender cut of beef.

Okay so I didn't really measure anything, so I don't know how good this recipe really is... but the ingredients were a great marinade for a london broil!  I added some worchestershire sauce, some lemon juice to break down the meat, more garlic cloves, and some McCormick salt-free steak seasoning; I was a little worried about the ketchup, but it only gave the meat a slight sweet tang. I think scoring the meat and adding lemon juice made a HUGE difference in the tenderness.  I plan to thinly slice the leftover meat and pair with some au jus on crusty bread for a quick french dip. Thanks so much!  We will make again -- I've already got another marinating in the freezer for an easy dinner next week.  Great inexpensive steak dinner (especially when they're buy-one-get-one-free!)

After reading all these great reviews, I was expecting an AMAZING marinade...this was good, but didn't blow me out of the water. I did add a little lemon juice as per another review. The steak turned out nice and tender, but the taste was...eh. I had to add a lot of salt to the finished product to bring it up to my standards a little more. :) I prefer the Southern Living recipe for London Broil marinade.

This is a great marinade because it's easy and delicious. I used the minced garlic in a jar to make it even easier. I only had time to marinate the steak for about 3 hours or so and it tasted great!

This turned out way better than I thought it would! I followed the directions perfectly and was very happy with the results! I was worried the meat would be tough so I added some lemon juice and worcestershire sauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great!  I followed the recipe as is, and my 4-year-old took one bite and said, "Yum, this is my favorite!"  My husband and I thought it was very tasty although it could have used some kind of sauce to make it less dry.

This was wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a 2 1/2 lb london broil rather than the flank steak. I marinated it for 24 hours, then added a bit more salt and pepper and some steak seasoning before putting it on the grill. It was so tender and flavorful! Definately a keeper! Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I was very dissapointed with this. It smelt so good when I made the marinade that I couldnt wait to taste the finsh product, but it was very bland. I marinated about 8 hours, maybe it needs more time. I think I will keep looking.

I bought "london broil" steak at the store and followed the recipe exactly.  The marinade was pretty good, not enough of it, but the steak turned out very tough, so tough that I only ate a few bites.  It may have been the steak but I thought the marinade would have tenderized it more (I marinated 6 hours).  Won't try this again.

This was good. I had 2 1.25lb. pieces and I think the amount of marinade was off. I ended up using it on the first piece and had to make another batch for the second one. So, I definately recomend doubling.

Easy and very tasty.  I will double the catsup next time for a slightly sweeter taste. I used 2 smaller london broils, marinated them in a ziploc overnight, used one the next day, and threw the other in the freezer, still in the marinade.

I guess the flavors were ok, but there was so little marinade (even though I used a smaller piece of meat than called for in the recipe) that it never really did tenderize it like marinades usually do. I let it marinate for 3 days and after grilling it was tasty, but tough, tough, tough. I took the leftovers and put them in the crock pot and that worked pretty well, because otherwise noone would eat them. I think this would be better with a more tender piece of meat or as a marinade for New York steaks.

Terrific marinade. Try letting it marinade alittle longer than the recipe to get the best flavor out of it. I have made this several time and I felt that it was even better after marinating it longer. I also pierced the meat a few times too to get the marinde into the meat. Great crowd pleaser too. Thanks Jill.

This was a wonderful!  Full of flavor.... I added extra soy sauce, 2 more garlic cloves and 1 tbsp of brown sugar.  My three kids went nuts... (19-19-21 yrs old)  My 21 year old came home late from working on a college group project and make a steak salad, then he had to wake me up to tell me how great the steak was... I used 2 sirloin steaks I had in the freezer... Can't wait to try this on frozen hamburg patties and grill after a day thawing in this sauce... Also I want to try this on chicken tenders for a hoagie type grilled sandwich with onion and peppers and pepper jack cheese... Thanks so much Jill for submitting this recipe... We will enjoy for years to come!

Flavor was good. The meat was tough, I guess I need to use a better cut of meat next time.

Outstanding...if I could give this 10 stars I would.  I can't believe this tougher cut of meat could get so tender & juicy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent!!! Like everyone said, it certainly offered a twist to the cheap cut of meat and gives you plenty of opportunity to tweak the recipe to your liking. You must try it!

This was absolutely delicious!  I only marinated an hour, and the flavor was still fabulous.  My husband said "This may be one of the best peices of meat you've every cooked" (and he's a picky eater!).  I made a mushroom gravy sauce for me, the rest of my family ate it plain, and LOVED it!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Very easy to make and really good.  I found I needed closer to 15 mins. per side on the grill and that was only with a 2 lb. steak.  My 10 yr. old declared it was his favorite way to make steak.

I finally found a recipe that everyone loves! I married the world's pickiest eater, and gave birth to a close second.  My husband, and all 3 of my children LOVE this recipe, it's wonderful cooked on the grill, or in the broiler. Even the baby can't get enough!

This was really very good and surprisingly simple. Didn't have any particulary overwhelming flavor, just a wonderful blend that really brings out the best in meat. As suggested, I went a bit light on the salt and did add a few shakes of worcestershire, so easy! I used the full recipie for just a little over 3 pounds of meat and it was perfect. Had enough to drizzle over the meat while it was grilling! Husband loved it too and he's pretty picky about his steak! Can't wait to use it on other cuts such as sirloin or ribeye!

I was having a 30th birthday bash and wanted to do all the cooking myself. I really wanted to impress my guest. I used this rub on my steaks before grilling them. The taste was unbelievable!  I added meat tenderizer to mine, the meat was melting in my mouth. I had several people to ask about the flavor. No need for additional sauce, the taste is good alone.

Very tasty and very easy!  I already had all the ingredients on hand!  I doubled the recipe for a little "extra" to use after the meat was cooked.  I think next time I'll use less salt though.

Very pungent, very tasty...got rave reviews...a definite keeper!  Just leave out the extra salt...makes it way too salty especially if you don't use low-sodium soy.

Oh my gosh wonderful! Loved the marinade, cooked perfectly on the grill and will definitely make it again! Some changes I made: didn’t have oregano, sprinkled with McCormick’s Grill seasoning, marinated 2 days in a covered glass dish.  My girlfriend also made this dish and she put it in the marinade then froze it for two days.

Great  recipe everyone loved it. One suggestion for everyone is to tenderize the cut before marinading it. This makes the meat so tender and makes you think that you bought an expensive cut.

I added a little onion powder and a little extra catch-up. It was absolutely delicious!  I cook the meat into thin slices and/grilled them. I serve them with grilled peppers and onions

I bought a London broil because it was on sale. I followed the instructions to a "T" and it was wonderful! I cooked it on my  preheated gas grill on high heat for 6 minutes on the one side and 5 minutes on the other side, then left it rest under a foil tent for about ten minutes. The outside edges were medium, but the main part was a perfect rare. My husband and I really enjoyed it. I have enough left over to make sandwiches for our lunches. I will definitely be making it again.

Really amazing! Best part is I realized at soIdid do the whole tenderizing it with poking holes and meat tenderizer with water the day before I marinated   But the I’ve done this a few times now and add some lemon juice as others suggested.

This came out great. However, I do suggest adding a few tablespoons of lemon juice to the marinade to help tenderize the meat.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  I've ALWAYS used teriyaki sauce to marinate my London Broil so this was a nice change. Hubby liked it and he generally hates change. Will definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious!  The meat was so flavorful and tender.  This can be a very tough piece of meat, but marinating it for at least 5 hours made it very tender and delicious.  This was a hit with the entire family.  And they skipped the steak sauce!

I used a 2 1/2 pound Chuck roast. I added a second clove  of garlic and reduced the pepper to 1/4 teaspoon. I marinated the meat and wrapped it in tin foil and put it in the refrigerator for  6 1/2 hours. I baked in the oven instead of grilling. But I was not sure about temperature and time. I tried 450° and it wasn't done after 42 minutes. I sliced the meat and was able to get it baked through. It was good.

LOVE this recipe.  Our family's favorite meats used to be rib eyes, New York Strips, and lamb chops.  This London Broil recipe has ALMOST become our favorite now above all of those!  And, I find this cut so much easier to fix for guests.  I just double-quadruple the recipe as needed.

Here's the thing, though.  SO many reviewers on here are recommending using flank steak.  We have done both cuts (flank steak and top round) side by side several times, and our family MUCH prefers the TOP ROUND over the flank cut.  

I follow AmazingRibs.com reverse sear beef and lamb cooking instructions, so I NEVER hot grill/broil any type of beef.  I slow roast this cut (and all my beef steaks, roasts, and even lamb) on a rack over a pan at 225 degrees until the inside temp of the meat is about 115 degrees (usually takes about 30-40 minutes).  I then sear both sides on a very hot searing burner outside until the outside of the meat has the "proper-looking" sear - usually between 1-2 minutes per side.  This makes an outstanding juicy, tender cut of medium-rare meat (be it a thick steak, roast, lamb, etc.).  Cooking this recipe, using the labeled "London Broil" meat rather than flank steak, makes a really SCRUMPTIOUS meat!

Very tasty. Took some hints from other reviews because my London broil cut of meat was thick. Added 2 tblsp of lemon juice to marinade to help tenderize the meat. Allowed meat to marinate for 48 hours. I used a ziplock bag. 
Broiled my meat about 7 to 8 minute
Es per side and then wrapped in aluminum foil and allowed to set for 10 minutes before slicing. I’ve tried London broil many times and was never happy with results. This was the best. Will make again.

Thanks Jill.  Made it yesterday with Josie's additions. 3 tbls of lemon juice to 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce, 2 tsp of fish sauce, 1 tsp of ground ginger, chili sauce instead of ketchup and 2 tsp of garlic powder.  Cut the four pounds into four one pound servings.  Wife and I ate one serving.  One serving's in the refrigerator.  Two in the freezer.  Thanks to all you great cooks.  From a beginner.

My first time cooking a London Broil turned out good. I followed the directions but only added more minced garlic. I followed the suggestions of one reviewer to marinate for 48 hours. Since it started raining here, I broiled the beef in the oven on a rack. 8 minutes per side and that was perfect timing. Well done on the ends and medium in the middle. Very flavorful! But was a little tough.  I'll make this again.

Since London broil is a tougher cut of meat, I decided to add a little more acid to the recipe by putting 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of worchestershire sauce in with the rest of the marinade ingredients.  I also let it marinate for approximately 36 hours.  My husband grilled it on high on our gas grill for about 8-9 minutes per side and we let it rest for about 20 minutes.  While my son really liked the flavor, he still found it tough.  My husband and I loved the flavor so much, the toughness wasn't a huge issue for us.  This will probably be my go to recipe for this cut of meat from now on.

This is the best tasting London Broil I've ever ate. I doubled the marinade for a 2-lb cut, scored it, and put it all in a doubled zip locked bag. The meat marinated for 48 hours prior to broiling for 8 minutes on each side (medium rare).  Delicious.

It was ok. I added lemon juice to try to help tenderize the meat as suggested by other reviewers. The meat was still tougher than we prefer. The flavor didn't trip our triggers either. Not sure I'll use this again.

I made this with olive oil and omitted the oregano because my husband does not prefer that flavor.  I marinated it overnight and grilled it 3-4 minutes per side. My whole family loved it and my 19 year old daughter proclaimed it to be the best beef she has ever eaten. It will certainly be in the regular rotation. I will not make any changes the next time I make it. I also grilled some corn on the cob, placing them on the grill about 5 minutes before the meat, and the timing was perfect.

Super easy and flavorful marinade! It was a nasty rainy day outside, so I seared the meat 5mins on each side on the stovetop in a cast iron skillet then finished in the oven. I let a pat of herbed butter melt overtop it while it rested before slicing. Mmm. Will make again!

It worked great even though I didn't plan ahead enough to let it marinade. My husband said it was good and had seconds which is enough for me! I cut the meat into small strips before marinating it since we have a 2 year old. It was kind of hard for him to chew.

Super!  I like a spicy smoky flavor, so I added a dash of liquid smoke, one tsp yellow mustard, a couple of Tbsp of red wine vinegar, and increased garlic to 3 cloves.

So easy.  I used the more roast size meat labeled London broil and marinated two days.  4 min each side in the grill pan on medium, then popped in the oven for 15 minutes. Was pink in middle and done perfectly at 140 when removed.  Let it rest 5 min. We had it sliced - no steak sauce needed!  And second night as French dip.  6 plates out of a $7 piece of meat - wow. Thought was a fluke so did again - lol - just as good!  For 2nd night that time sliced thin and simmered for just a minute in saved juices.  Oh my yum.  Can't wait to fix again!

I cooked this in the broiler on high. About 14 minutes per side makes it medium rare.  It was tasty, but a little tough. We'd make it again, but will probably try another recipe before that.

Delicious! I omitted the ketchup and added lemon juice as someone else stated. I also added some Montreal steak seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, whorchestire sauce, a little bit of siracha  and a splash of  red wine vinegar. Stuck it in the sous vide for 6 - 7 he's and it came out super tender! I never thought London broil could be that tender!!! Definitely making this again!

This my absolute favorite steak marinade. It is perfect as is. When I don't have fresh garlic I use a tsp. of garlic powder. Mix all together and refrigerate over night. Soooo good!

Great taste. I added a little more ketchup and a little less soy sauce. It still made the meat nice and tender without having a ketchup-y flavor.

Made it per the recipe's specifications except I doubled the amount of marinade, as others suggested.  I had 1.71 lbs of london broil (about 1.5 inches thick) which I got on sale.  I only ended up marinating it for about an hour, because I was hungover all day, but the flavor was still amazing.  We like ours medium rare, and the four minutes on each side got us perfection.  The only issue I had (and the only reason why I'm giving it four and not five stars...maybe it was my fault) is that it was perfectly cooked but kind of cold after letting it rest for about five minutes.  I preheated the broiler for the recommended 10 minutes, and it felt sufficiently hot when I put it in.  Not sure if it's suppose to be kind of cold, but I ended up putting the sliced pieces back for another few minutes.  It was nice and hot, but was probably closer to medium at that point.  Regardless, the flavor was awesome, and it was SUPER tender.  Thank you, thank you for this recipe!

Followed the recipe, using fresh oregano finely chopped instead of dried (using x3 the dried herb amount), marinated for 8 hours.  The London Broil was surprisingly tender and had a very nice flavor, not overpowering.  Even the grandkids liked it and asked for more helpings (ages 4 and 6). I added some lemon juice, wine and Worcestershire sauce to an extra batch of the marinade, simmered til reduced, and served to be drizzled over the sliced meat at the table as desired. Served with potato/brussel sprouts and some great olive bread from a local bakery. We had some leftovers which made great sandwiches.  I will definitely make again, and will do as others suggested and freeze some London Broil in the marinade for easy future meals.

When I followed the recipe for the first time, it was DELICIOUS and even my brother loves it.  He is the most finicky eater I have ever met. I did put in some lemon juice as others suggested and I marinated it overnight. The second time I made it, I thought I would double the marinated sauce...that was an enormous mistake and we didn't like it all. Follow the recipe and you will be just fine!!!!  You will love it. If not, just hand the meat over  to me!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe with us.

Tried this exactly as written.  I marinated for over 24 hours and even though it spent longer on the grill than it should have, it still turned out very moist, tender and flavorful.  Can't wait to re-try with a more appropriate grill time - fantastic!

Difficult to tell when the cut of meat was done (I used the traditional cut for London broil, not flank steak). Nevertheless the flavor was good and I will use the marinade again.

I used 3 tabespoons of orange juice, a teaspoon of McCormack Montreal Steak Seasoning, substituted teriyaki sauce for the soy, and threw in  3 tablespoons of Italian Salad dressing.  I also used bbq sauce instead of ketchup.  It is a great recipie, and came out great.  Definitely use a jjaccard or type of piercing tool prior to marinatinf the meat.
You can also use some red wine if you have it, if not, no worries, a tablespoon or two added to the marinade will enhance the flavor.  I also omitted the oreganao in this recipie.

Double the garlic, use kosher salt instead of regular salt, use chili sauce for katsup, add dried onions and 3 TBL. of lemon juice to tenderize.  Marinate in ziplock for at least 24 hours.  Preheat broiler and broiler pan.  Broil on top rack for 5 1/2 minutes on each side.  Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.  Excellent!  UPDATE:  With leftovers, put in crock pot on high for 4 hours with full box of beef broth.  Last 20 min add noodles.  WoW.  A two'fer!

I've made London Broil with this recipe dozens of times, and it always comes out perfect!  The only change I make is that I use celery seed instead of oregano.  It's a better seasoning for red meat, in my opinion, as it has a similar taste but isn't as sharp.  Great and easy recipe, though.

Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling it and adding a tiny bit of beef "Better than Bouillon", and meat tenderizer. I marinated the meat in a zip-lock bag for 2 days. The guys absolutely loved it!!! They have requested that marinade on all meats now ;0)

This is a fantastic marinade. I usually let it soak for 2-3 days. It always comes out delicious. I added 3 T of Lemon juice and 2 t of Worcestershire sauce. Family favorite.

Super! If its a rainy day, you can also cook in a cast iron skillet stove top. I use olive oil and chili sauce instead of vegetable oil and ketchup.

I usually just put this in a ziploc bag. I don't even bother scoring the meat or rubbing the marinade in. It's sooooo good. I broil mine for 7 mins per side to get it medium rare, and it's perfect every time!

I grilled med-high for 8 min on each side. Turned out med to medium rare depending on the thickness. I added 1/2 lemon to marinate because the reviews made me nervous that it would be tough. The steak marinated for 24 hrs and it is tender and very good. This is very flavorful but not strong. Will make again.

Seriously, when I read this "The marinade is so flavorful you'll skip the steak sauce," I thought BS lol, then when I asked my husband, would you like some steak sauce, he said NOPE! & then I tried the steak and it was AMAZING!!! 
At first I was hesitant to make this recipe, because I only had 30 minutes to marinate it. I kept looking for a recipe that took less marinating time,but didn't find any that appealed to me as much as this one. Still did it!
I can't imagine how much flavorful would have been if I would have left it for hours. But I'll find out tonight or tomorrow, since I prepared the rest of the meat and has been marinating since yesterday.

We loved the taste, but even with all the advice, nothing could help the London Broil that I bought!  It was tough even after I did all the right things.  Sometimes you just can't compensate for tough meat.

Delicious. So easy. Used a ziplock to marinate. No leftovers. :)

Wonderful easy recipe that called for ingredients I always have on hand.  I used London Broil and followed the recipe exactly.  I turned the foil-wrapped meat every hour for about 7 hours.  I think the longer it's marinated, the better and more tender the meat will be.  My kids both gobbled it up, and my 5-yr old daughter kept sneaking more pieces off the platter. Will definitely make again.

This was the best steak marinade I've ever tried... So much flavor! I had a 2lb london broil rather than a 4lb, but I didn't reduce the other ingredients. It made for a very juicy, flavorful steak! Definitely going to use this recipe for all steaks!

This was pretty good, but not that memorable, so it probably won't go into the regular meal rotation at my house.

Wonderful! Marinated with moderate cuts flipping through 24 hour period.
Most tender and delicious. This tasted divine!
Will tuck away this recipe and serve again and again.

Very good, though I added some lemon juice and worcestershire and just did a pinch of oregano since its not my favorite. Most importantly and the reason for a star loss, I marinated 1 lb and it was just right, not 4 lbs.

The marinate was the first one my hunny actually told me he liked on a piece of meat but totally the wrong cut of meat as even at medium it was super tough to eat. I think I will be using this marinated on some other cuts of meat in the future but never this pairing again.

I won't normally buy a London Broil, but hubby brought one home from the store. I used this recipe and wow I was impressed how this recipe transformed what normally to me is a tough piece of meat into something much yummier! For me this is the only way I will cook it in the future; guests loved it too.

I marinated the meat overnight. I used the cut of meat that was called a London Broil. It came out very tender and flavorful. You really don't need steak sauce! I made the leftovers into steak sandwiches the next night with sauteed onions and pepper jack cheese.

Started the marinade the night before my trip to Vegas. Other dinner plans were made when I got there so the meat marinated for a few days before I was able to finally grill it. WOW, it was delicious. I was afraid that it would be too salty but it was perfect. The meat was so moist too. This recipe is a keeper!

Very good recipe.  Scoring the meat was a nice touch
but the cut of meat I bought was just too tough for me.  If I make this again, I'll use a more tender cut of beef.

I actually changed quite a bit the first time I made it, partly due to lack of access to ingredients and a grill.  I replaced the soy with Worcestershire sauce, and added about 1/4 c balsamic vinegar.  I marinated for 2 days, and then didn't have a grill so ended up putting it under the broiler for about 6 min per side (was aiming for medium rare, but it came out medium).  Tasted very flavorful, but I still did use steak sauce (however I didn't NEED it).

This was just ok.  I did add balsamic vinegar and a little lemon juice to tenderize and I was just not too crazy about the flavor. Everyone ate it but my search for the perfect london broil recipe will continue.

A little salty but really good. Following the advice of other commenters, I added just a bit of lemon juice to help break down the fibers to tenderize the meat better. Unable to grill due to snow, so we broiled it and it was fabulous. So tender!

A good marinade, just make sure you get a meat cut that is very tender. The flank steak was a little tough for us.

This was very good, however, I guess we are not big fans of the soy sauce taste (and it was very mild) in our steak--but, aside from that it was good.

We made this marinade for a London Broil, but didn't have 5-6 hours to wait so marinated for just 1/2 hour or so. We also used a Ziploc bag instead of wrapping in foil, and cooked longer than what was suggested. Reviewer Jill is right; it is so flavorful! We're making it again tonight to use on a beef brisket, but this time we're going to marinate overnight. I'm looking forward to dinner tomorrow!

I have never made London broil before and this was a simple but a delicious recipe.  I didn't marinate it for as long as it says to but even just the hour that I had done it for came out de-lish!

Even though we were only able to marinade it for a few hours, we were surprised how absolutely delicious it was. We had about 3 lbs of thick London broil so my husband cut it in half width wise to make 2 thinner steaks so it would marinade better. He used the marinade exactly as written but doubled the amount. The next night my husband and I cut some of the left overs up on our salads and our son made a steak and Swiss cheese sandwich out of the rest, using the drippings as a dipping sauce. We did leave it on the grill a little too long, so be sure to take it off before you think it is done since it continues to cook after that.  Thanks for the recipe Jill!

My 5 stars are strictly for the flavor of this marinade. It didn't do such a great job of tenderizing the meat, I suppose because of the absence of an acid. However, I would certainly use this to flavor more tender cuts of meat, and think it would be great to brush several coats on during grilling. I plan to play around with this a bit to recreate the flavor in a homemade steak sauce.

The marinate had a good flavor. May use this on another meat. But, not on this cut of meat. 

I marinated this for over 24 hours and it was still very tough after it was cooked. Not sure how this recipe got such a high rating. Will not make this again.

Wasn't a big fan only because I thought the meat was still tough even after taking all the suggested into consideration.

My mother-in-law gave me this recipe years ago, and it is pretty no-fail. As others have mentioned, flank steak is the best cut of meat. London Broil is a style of cooking, not really a cut. Many people get a "top round" cut instead of a flank, and that is what some people are calling London Broil. Anyway, this is also great made into small slider sandwiches for a casual party. Very flavorful!

Excellent flavor, we prefer it more done so we cooked it longer.  Followed recipe ingredients exactly except used low carb ketchup to lower the carb count. Definitely making this one again! YUM!

AMAZING!!!  Great flavor and the tenderest london broil I've ever had.  The only change was marinating for 2 days versus several hours.  I grilled for approx 8-10 minutes on each side for a 2lb london broil and it was perfect.

This marinade is delicious! I definitely recommend substituting the soy sauce with worcestershire sauce. Per other recommendations I did add lemon juice. I let marinade for 24 hrs. Five stars when made this way!

Very good broil, the flavors of the marinade compliment the meat nicely. I added some balsamic vinegar and a small sprig of fresh rosemary to tang it up a bit. In regards to some previous comments regarding flank not being a London broil, London broil is a method of preparation, not a cut of meat. Most common cuts are flank and top round, and either will be tender as long as you marinate and cut across the grain.

This marinade works for all cuts of red meat.  Absolutely amazing and everyone wants this recipe.  I usually marinade NY strip steaks for a couple of hours, then grill on over a charcoal BBQ.  I pour the leftover marinade into a small pot and simmer it until it reduces to a nice thick sauce (the consistency of a steak sauce).  Best meat marinade!

This was WONDERFUL! I'm finishing it up now, and it's definitely on the list as my go-to steak marinade. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I made some changes, namely: more garlic, I substituted half of the soy sauce for Worcetshire (close enough) sauce, and I used balsamic vinegar instead of ketchup (for acid with still a touch of sweetness). I didn't have an outdoor grill, so I used my cast-iron grill after marinating for probably 18 hours. Delicious!!

I decided to try this because the ingredients were so simple and available in pantry.  I didn't measure any of the ingredients, just eyeballed it, but I think I was relatively accurate.  I added more garlic, some worcestershire sauce and a few shakes of white wine vinegar to help tenderize the London Broil.  Put it all in a zip lock bag and marinated  for about 6 hours.  Worked like a charm and tasted great.  Next time I think I'll marinate even longer. More tender than London Broil usually is and more tasty than adding steak sauce after cooking.

It was ok.  The sauce turned out good.. tho i substituted some things for stuff i didn't have.  But the cook time just didn't seem right.  I had to cook it alot longer and then it seemed overdone.  I dont know maybe I didn't do it right or it should be actually grilled instead of broiled.  It turned very tough. Overall it was ok but i'll keep looking..

Loved the marinade. Marinated the meat for around 24 hours, then broiled 1.5 inch thick cut for 6.5 minutes on each side, then let it sit for 5 minutes.  I agree with the many posters who noted the meat was not great, but that's easily remedied with a nicer cut of meat. :)

I had issues with toughness, it just wasn't as tender as I was expecting, and I did add citrus to the marinade.  Really good taste.

very tastey. I added a couple tbs of worchestershire and lemon juice for some added acid to help tenderize the meat. I left out some of the salt because it seemed like a lot on top of the soy sauce but the meat didnt turn out to be too salty. Next time I'll probably add the full amount. Also I went a little heavier on the oregano and pepper.

I only had a pound and a half of london broil and I made this recipe here. Instead I added worteshire sauce instead of soy sauce. I marinated it in a ziplock bag for 6 hours and cut diamond slits into the steak to let the marinade in. It was amazzzzzing! My family couldn't get over how tender it was. Def making this again!

This is okay for a meal, but we love it sliced and served cold over a salad.

London broil tasted amazing. I actually ended up marinating this for 2-3 days and by the time we grilled it, it was so tasty! Definitely going to be making this every time I grill out!

This was ok but not exceptional. I followed the recipe and wound up with a kinda' dry, flavorless steak. I wound up busting out the A1 Sauce and it solved the problem.

Not a fan of this cut of meat prepared this way. Let me say, this is the first time I have had london broil, and if i try it again, will probably use a different method of cooking it.  Great flavor in marinade, will use that again, but with a different cut of meat!  :)

I wasn't a huge fan of this but my husband loved it.  I thought it had a little too much soy sauce, you could really taste it.  I did use some lemon juice to help tenderize it but it was still a little on the tough side.

Everyone in my family thought the meat almost had a spoiled taste to it; however, it could have been because I froze my meat and marinade together...might have been too long of a marinating time???

This recipe is adequate as is.  It was flavorful and tender.  It just did not knock my socks off!  I will likely try other recipes to find that perfect (for me) taste.

Was a litle tough but for a London Broil, that was to be expected.  Only had 2 1/2 hours to marinade but the flavor was still incredible!  I added: 2 tsp minced onion (diced as small as possible) and an egg (helped the marinade "stick").  I didn't use salt with the soy sauce, the recipe already has enough salt.

Excellent marinade! I let it sit for 6 hours and it was awesome. Next time I will however let it sit over night. Don't skip the scoring step as marinade will only seep so far into the meat even sitting overnight.

Of course you need to have a good piece of meat but this marinade is easy with ingredients I had in my pantry. I marinaded for about 7 hours and then cooked it in my broiler as I don't have a grill. I have to say it was amazing. Shortly after dinner began my guests started asking what kind of marinade I used. I had 7 adults for dinner so I doubled the recipe and used two pieces of beef. By the end of dinner my guests were more interested in getting a piece of the leftovers for their lunches in the coming week than they were in dessert. I made cold salads with thin slices of beef twice during the following week and the meat was wonderful. I will keep this recipe on the top of my list.

Tasty marinade. My london broil wasnt as thick as the typical london broil is so the flavor was able to absorb into the meat very well. Will use this again.

Really good flavor! Meat came out very tender. Like others - I tweaked the recipe - no oregano or ketchup, added lemon and a bit of tiger sauce and 3-4 garlic cloves, as well as, soy sauce.

I used my oven's broiler and probably will just grill next time. I used another recipe's instructions on what to cook it on (Hi for 7 minutes each side). I had to do this multiple times because it wasn't thorough cooked. Had it been cooked properly at 14 minutes it looked SO superbly juicy but it wasn't done....and the extra cooking time dried it out. The marinade was excellent and next time I will cut it up better to increase cooking time or either throw it on the grill.

This is the first time I made london broil. It turned out great. My husband and 2 year old both liked it as well.

I made this again for my 91 year old grandmother and she said it was better than her London Broil. It had so much flavor.

This a great recipe, the flavors in the meat were wonderful! I did change a few things though--instead of salt I added 1/2 tsp chipotle smoked Tabasco sauce, 1 tsp of worchestershire sauce and 3 tbsp of Teriyaki marinade(it has soy sauce in it) and marinated the meat in a ziploc bag for 4 hours, turning every hour. I put the meat in the broiler, 8 minutes each side. I will definitely use this again and marinate it overnight!

This method was great for London Broil. The scoring of the meat is key! We often have London Broil on sale here, so we will definately be having this again! This is so good, it is "company" good.  (I might try a little balsamic vinegar on it next time, just to experiment with the recipe a little.   The vinegar will help with the tenderness)

Really great marinade.  I was always hesitant to buy this cut of meat since I could never find a recipe to work but this does very well.  I bought two, doubled the marinade and froze one in a ziploc with the marinade.  I only marinated for 2 hours so I'm looking forward to trying the other!

I am new to using marinades in cooking.  My wife and I were looking at the grocery store one day and they had London broils on sale so we picked some up.  I searched this site and found this recipe.  I tried it and we absolutely loved it.

This was delicious and easy to prepare in a snap.  I added 2-3 tbsps of lemon juice to tenderize.  Yum!

This was delicious.  We were prepared to grill it outdoors, but the gas tank was empty.  No problem though, we put it under the broiler and it came out super!  My children, ages 5 and 7, ate it up.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I followeed the recipe, omitted the salt, but it was just waaaay too salty for our taste. The meat (london broil cut) was tender, but I would not make again because my family didn't care for.

This was a delicious marinade!!!!  I let my marinate overnight since London broil is a rather tough cut of meet.  The only change I would make next time is to cut the salt.  It turned out just a little on the too salty side for me but it was still great!

I made this the other night after letting it marinade a couple of days, I also sub the soy for "rooster " sauce and added lemon juice. Lots more garlic than it calls for, cause we just love garlic. Cooked on the grill and YUM!!

Absolutely delicious! My husband has a terrible habbit of putting BBQ sauce on all his steak. This time the open bottle sat next to his dish the whole time but he never made a move toward it. Excellent flavor - thank you!

I made the recipe exactly as directed and marinated the London broil overnight.  It was very tasty and flavorful although perhaps not enough so in the middle.  Would definitely make again!

Ho hum.  I added lemon juice and worcestire sauce to help tenderize, marinaded for probably 10 hours...  just boring tasting.  No real kick to my tastebuds.  I prefer "G's Flank Steak Marinade" from this site.

Never a fan of london broil until I tried this.  I did add a tsp. of dried rosemary.  I cook mine under broiler for 7-8 min. per side as my family preferes a little more done. great on steaks also.

I was a little skeptical, but this recipe had great flavor! I added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, per other reviewers. Turned out great! The only thing that was off was the cook time. Put it on the BBQ for 7 minutes per side on high, let it rest for 15 minutes and it was still SUPER pink in the center. Ended up throwing it in the oven @ 350 for 10 minutes to finish it off. Perfect!!

Really good and steak was tender.  Used 2T lemon juice and marinated 48 hrs.  Way too salty - would leave out the salt since using soy sauce.

What a flavourful marinade! I was a little worried at first because the smell was horrible- but during and after cooking the smell was great! I can't believe how this marinade tasted well AND how it brought out the best in the london broil. Thank you for this recipe.

This was outstanding.  I followed the recipe exactly with no changes.  I did the marinade in the am and cooked it around 7 hours later.  Perfect flavor that stayed with the meat.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

MMMMM! Amazing marinade. I followed the recommendations of others and added lemon juice, fish sauce, and garlic, and the taste was great. The meat was still on the tough side - despite piercing it all over, and marinating all day. I think London Broil is just a tough cut. I'll try this on other meats and chicken. Yum

I made this for dinner tonight and it was positively delicious, even though I only had time to marinate it for one hour.  My (extremely picky) husband declared it the best meal I've ever cooked for him.  Woo!  Even more amazing - he thinks the marinade is tastier than Stubb's!  BRAVO to the creator of this recipe!

I pan-fried, then roasted this in the oven instead of grilled this. Simply brown 2-3 minutes on each side, then put in the oven at 325 degrees for 12-15 minutes depending on your oven and thickness of the steak for medium to medium rare. The marinade was delicious. The kids love this, too!

Tried this tonight.  Took the recommendations of other cooks and added lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. I only got a 1lb of london broil and I wish that I had gotten a bigger one for my little family. It's gone and I wanted leftovers!

I have made this a "staple" of meals. We have it often now. It tastes like a great expensive cut of steak.  
Cheap (stock up when L.B is on sale) Easy, fast, Delicious!

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe and marinated for 6 hours.  I put it under the broiler on high for about 5-6 mins each side.  The end result was a juicy, flavorful and tender steak.  Thanks for the great recipe - I'll be using this marinade again.

I had 2 london broils, so I quadrupled some of the ingredients, EXCEPT the soy (used only 1/4 c), the salt (used 2 tsp), and only 1 tsp pepper.  I added 3 tbsp of lemon juice to tenderize. I also poked them all over with a fork.  I marinated for about 8 hours, and flipped the meat 1/2 way through.  Grilled on a lower heat for about 8 min's on each side (they were pretty rare this way but that's how we like it!).  They came out FABULOUS!  My kids said it beat out my sis-in-law's famous london broil which is WAY more complicated!  THANKS for our new favorite marinade!

This was really good.  I only had 2 lbs of london broil but I used the same amount of marinade for 4 lbs.  I added a tbsp of worcestshire and half a lemon's worth of juice to the marinade, and I used fresh oregano instead of dried.  My husband sliced the steak thin after we grilled it which helps because this cut of beef is a little tougher.  Very good flavor though and pretty inexpensive.  Served with garlic secret mashed potatoes from this site.

This was very flavorful. I used a tenderizer on the meat instead of adding the salt b/c I was only marinating for 2 hours. The soy was had plenty of saltiness w/o the additional salt. To help keep tender, I usually cook to a medium and microwave slices for those wanting it well done.

I marinated this for 9 hours and it came out so tender and flavorful.  Then I BBQ'd it on high heat on the BBQ.  Thinly cut the meat and it was a hit.  This marinade is a keeper!

I love this recipe!  I BBQ'ed six large London Broils for my sons travel team thinking I would have left overs for the nest day, and I didn't even come close to having enough.  The boy's loved it!  Thank you for a great recipe.

LOVED IT!! The marniade was excellent. We are definitely keeping this one! Our cut of meat was a little tough so for the next time we will try a different cut. There are very few recipes I make more than once, this will be a regular at our home!

Thought it was good but not very tender (even with the lemon juice suggestion). However, I did not grill it - i broiled it for 25 min on 350.  Perhaps I overcooked it because I needed a sauce with it. So I mixed some beef broth, red wine, butter and flour to make a dipping sauce.  Will try again on the grill.

Yum, yum, yum!!!  I would rate this more if I could.  Thanks for the excellent recipe.  We all enjoyed this recipe - even my 5, 3-1/2, and 2 year olds ate it with no complaints.  I served theirs in taco shells and ours (hubby and I) with a salad.  I marinated the London Broil for 9 hours and thought it was tender and really flavorful.  My husband and I do not normally care for London Broil, but we love it now.  I can't wait to make this again.  A really enjoyable meal!!!

This is the first time I've ever had London Broil and this marinade was terrific! It's an expensive dish so it won't become a regular on our menu but definitely once every month or two! I did add worchester sauce and shallots.

So easy to prepare, yet so tasty. I used
the marinade on pork as well as beef.
Melts in your mouth. My picky husband couldn't stop snacking on it even after dinner was done.
Thanks!

One of the best marinades I have ever had....meat was very tender and flavorful.  It was so good that we had it again just a week later.

This marinade was very good - although not my favorite for flank steak.  Unfortunately, I got a very fatty and tough piece of meat and didn't cook it long enough. Blech!  But the marinade was good :)  Thanks!

This is GREAT!!!  I am not usually a fan of marinades but couldn't get enough of this one.  We used a Flank Steak. Cooked about 8 minutes each side and it came out melt in your mouth tender.  We said we could eat this every week it was that good!  Great recipe thanks for sharing

I'll give this one a 3 because while half of our family of 6 loved it, the other half didn't - at all! First off I must've had a London Broil that was too thick because it didn't cook in the middle - at all. I ended up slicing it in strips and broiling it (we don't have a grill) til there wasn't any red left. We don't like rare or even slightly pink beef. So then, of course it was dry. Also I wasn't able to marinate it longer than 6 hours and even though I pierced the heck out of the meat, the marinade didn't soak all the way through. I didn't think there was enough flavor but my husband went wild over it! So the camp is divided but I probably won't try this again.

I liked the marinade, but I'm not sure if I would make this again. I must have cooked it wrong, because mine came out really tough. Although, I did cook it on an indoor grill...maybe I'll try my husbands Weber BBQ. But I will use the marinade again. Thanks!

I have never used this with flank steak but frequently use this recipe for other steaks. Even cheap cuts taste great with this marinade, even when I only had it marinading for one hour! Thanks Jill!

VERY Flavorful.  My husband ate on it all week.  Leftovers at our house typically get thrown out the next day due to lack of interest.  I marinated overnight.

This did not work for me. The flavor was good, it smelled good, but the texture was just what I expected from an inexpensive cut of beef. I marinated  it over twenty four hours to be prudent as well. In the future I will spend a few more dollars and get the cut of beef I really want. Thanks anyway.

This was absolutely delicious. I bought 2 London Broil steaks and had no clue what to do with them, so I searched here, my favorite site!

 I left out the oregano, and added seasoned pepper. (Just a few shakes) I let it marinate for several hours before throwing it on the BBQ. We shared with our friends and there was not a single bite left. Thanks!

I have been using this marinade for three years now and we still love it!  I like London Broil because it is an inexpensive and lean cut of meat, and this marinade makes it taste wonderful.  I usually take recipes and tweek them a little to my own taste....this does not need any tweeking in my opinion, it is one of the few recipes I follow exactly every time. Excellent!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I combine this recipe with the "London Broil I" and it becomes a 4 1/2 star.

I have been using this recipe for 2 years now and it is still the family favorite.  I always double or triple the recipe and it works great on any type of steak, not just london broil.

Had high hopes but was disappointed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as outstanding as I was expecting due to the reviews. Hubby said to give it 2 or 3 stars, I felt that it was 3. I think that this is one of those marinades that just depends on the palate.

Awesome, awesome flavor!  My 4 year son had 3 helpings of this.  This recipe is a keeper for my family.  Ingredients were all in my pantry and took only minutes to put together.  I marinated 24 hours.

Flavor is wonderful!!! I used a thick London Broil that took A LOT longer to cook. Omit salt & use meat tenderizer. I also advise to marinate overnight- especially if you use a thick cut.

This was absolutely terrific! I put it in a ziploc bag with the marinade overnight in the fridge. We grilled it for about 5 minutes a side and it was so tender. My husband raved about it - no need for steak sauce! Perfect blend of saltiness and garlic taste.

Excellent marinade - I added red wine and a capful of lemon juice. My husband was amazed at the flavor, he said it was the best steak he's ever tasted.  This will be the base for many marinades to come, thank you so much!

I bought a thick cut of meat labeled "London Broil."  I marinated it in this sauce for about 45 minutes and put it on a medium high grill for about 10 minutes per side.  It was definitely red in the middle which was fine.  Very tastey.  Will use it again.

Yum. This recipe took a cheap tough piece of meat and made it tender and o so delicious. I left out the oregano because I didn't have any and it was still great. I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe was easy and delicious, which automatically makes it one of my favorites.  I did add some lemon juice and meat tenderizer, as suggested my other reviewers, to make my inexpensive cut of eat even better.  We will definitely be making this again.  Thanks Jill!

This tenderized a very lean piece of top round.  I used a fork to pierce the steak before adding the marinade.  I only added 1/2 tsp. of salt.  Next time I'll experiment by adding some lemon juice.

This was really good. My husband is pretty picky about having lots of spices. He thought it was really flavorful. My son was not as thrilled though. It could have just been the cut of meat.

This recipe was easy but lacking something to me.  I think the soy sauce in the marinade made the meat a little tough.  Maybe try this without it?

Very flavorful and very eary to prepare, but I wasn't as overwhelmed as many others seem to be. After reading all the other reviews, though, I think my expectations were much higher than they would normally have been. I would still recommend this recipe though and will probaly use it again.

This was so easy to prepare and delicious.  My fiance was surprised how tender the meat was because flank steak is typically a tougher cut of meat.  This would be a great recipe for a dinner party because it was so hassle free.  Thanks for the great marinade.

Thanks, Jill!  I've never been very good at a London broil, but this one was excellent.  I put steak sauce on the table and nobody touched it - not even the kids!  I used Italian Seasoning because I was out of oregano.  It was wonderful.

This marinade is delicious. It did a great job marinating and tenderizing the meat. I was only able to marinate for 4 hours, but it did great on my London broil. I think it would be a delicious marinade on any grade of steak. My husband, who is a steak fanatic, loved it. We highly recommend it. It's easy, too!

What a delightful change from some of the bottled marinades on the market.  It was so full of flavor.  My teenagers even remarked about how good it was.  It definitely a keeper and going to be used quite a bit this summer!

The marinade was so quick to prepare and the meat tasted great.  The only thing I did differently was to add 3-4 dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the marinade.

This was easy to prepare ahead and barbeque the next day. I used flank steak and it was a real hit with my dinner guests.   The flavor was different and very good.
