I enjoyed this recipe, only I modified a few things. 1) I used bacon instead of ham 2) I omitted the tomatoes, they really aren't necessary. 3) I added the vinegar to the ham/onion mixture, this coated the whole product more thoroughly, and it really soaked the flavor into the greens a bit better.

This was great, tasted just like my granny used to make.

This was a very good and simple way to make turnip greens.  I bet it would be good with other types of greens as well.  I didn't have enough turnip greens, so I added some spinach I had on hand.  I think next time I might add garlic for personal preference...and maybe some chili flakes.  But it's good as-is.

This was pretty good.  I had never eaten turnip greens before and needed a recipe.  It looked colorful and healthy and tasted great!  We didn't have apple cider vinegar, so we just used white vinegar. I also had to use stewed tomatoes instead of diced.  Next time I think I will use diced.  All in all, it was quite tasty.  I would make it again.

This was pretty good, just a bit salty, but  I put more ham in than called for. Also think it would be better with fresh tomatoes or at least with one of the best brands of tomatoes (I used cheaper one). Husband and daughter loved it...

I also skipped the tomatoes entirely. I also overdid the ham. It came out quite salty as a result. Anyone who makes a similar mistake: slice in a few potatoes and re-cook until those are tender. Potatoes are great for soaking up salt, and it gives the whole dish a Germanic touch. My kids are not into greenery, but my husband and I liked it.

For such a simple recipe, this is delicious!  We had some fresh turnips from the garden and as I was washing them I thought it would be nice to use the greens as well.  So glad I did.  My only complaint is that the vinegar was a bit much for our tastes but stil good.  Would cut that in half next time.  Also, I was very tempted to add garlic as other reviewers did just because the recipe looked too simple. I'm glad I resisted.  This was great as is.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good! Didn't have ham and used a large chopped yellow tomato and it was really good regardless.

We enjoyed this.  Kids preferred it without the vinegar, adults added red pepper flakes.  In the last few minutes of cooking, I added a couple cups of cooked blackeyed peas that we needed to use up-- those went nicely with it.

This recipe was pretty good.  If I make it again I will only use 1 tbs cider vinegar though; I thought 2 tbs was too much.

Pretty good.  I added plenty of garlic and left out the tomatoes, although I'm sure they would be good.  I used turkey bacon instead of ham.

My husband and I enjoyed this, and he doesn't like greens!  I used 1 1/2 slices of bacon, chopped, instead of ham since I didn't have any.  Left out the tomatoes cause my husband doesn't like those, either.  Actually, I added a few slices of dried tomato, chopped, and a dash of creole seasoning.  We found out that turnip greens are good, and like them more than kale or mustard greens.  Thanks!

Very good and the first time I've ever cooked turnip tops.  I used a can of stewed tomatoes as I didn't have just plain diced.  Nice, ripe and juicy fresh tomatoes would definately be welcome in this dish.

I really liked it.  I did use just one tbs vinegar and didn't include the tomatoes since my hubby doesn't like them (although I think they would be good with them too).

Yum yum yummy!!  Thank you for posting this!  We usually eat turnip greens with just bacon or ham, but this is really nice and flavorful.  Sliced boiled eggs compliment the taste and look nice as a garnish too.  Thank you for posting

Really good!!  I used turkey ham, collard greens and skipped the tomatoes as well. I didn't have apple cider vinegar and don't really like the taste so I sliced up a Granny Smith apple and cooked it in and it was very tasty!

Excellent go-to recipe, easy to get creative! I skipped the tomatoes and added a little extra apple cider vinegar. Used a little powdered chicken bouillon instead of salt. Perfect!!! Fam loved it!!!

It IS a delicious recipe.  I added more ham to make it a main dish.  I didn't have turnip greens, but had some collards which worked very well.  Also, I had some cherry tomatoes that I needed to use up so they went into the skillet as well.  Sounds like I made a lot of changes, but not really.  Thank you for the recipe! - mjcarbo

Local store had large bag of turnip greens on sale for 49 cents.  Had never eaten or cooked greens before.  Used bacon (didn't have ham on hand) and turned out GREAT!  Big hit with whole family.  Will definitely watch for that sale again!!!!

This is so good! I made it as the recipe said to and I really enjoyed this. I made it once with ham and another time with a little bacon instead of ham. Great both ways! I must say, making it with turnip greens from my own garden is so much better than with store-bought greens. I will try with home-grown beet greens next time, for a new twist.
