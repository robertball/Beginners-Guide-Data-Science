Used this on brisket we smoked and it turned out pretty good. We do not care for Chines five spice or allspice so I left them out. Hindsight I wish I would have left the cinnamon out too. It wasn't too overwhelming but I just don't think it belonged. This made for a super tender brisket and it is a recipe I would use again making a few minor adjustments.
