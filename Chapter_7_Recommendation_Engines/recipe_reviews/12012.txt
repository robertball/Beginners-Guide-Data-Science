Don't let the less-than-delicious name fool you, this is really good!  The sauce is just "eh", so instead of this one, I use "world's best pasta sauce" from this site, cook the pasta, and mix with the cheeses, then pour the sauce over the top and bake.  Everyone loves it!

This is my husband's favorite!  I make this one everytime I go out of town because I know it will keep him from eating fast food everyday!  He even loved to share it with his guy friends, they all raved. Thank You.
UPDATE: I have made this a dozen times now and I make the following changes to the recipes.  First, I use a 26 oz. jar of prepared tomato sauce (sometimes more depending on how thick the sauce ends up), I use the whole 16 oz. cottage cheese (small curd) container because I have never found it in 8 oz., I omit the bell pepper (not our favorite, sometimes I substitute a red bell pepper, but it is good without), and top the whole thing with a couple cups of shredded cheese (mozzarella or Italian mixture).  This is very thick, rich and delicious.

I gave it 5 stars, because, with a little adjusting, it will be perfect.  Definately needs more sauce, and I think more hamburger, like a pound and a half.  Also, I think the green pepper needs to cooked with the hamburger and onion.  Other than that, wow!  what a great meal!  Awesome flavor.  And you can do many variations with it, adding your personal favorites....it's virtually impossible to screw this up!

My daughter recently became a vegetarian. So I substituted the beef for soy crumblers and also added shredded carrots to the garlic/onion mixture and sautéed . Added more sauce as previously stated and mixed everything together topped with parmesan and ..Viola...GREAT vegetarian dish!!

We've made this twice, the first time for a potluck where it was very well liked, and I received several compliments(actually it was gone before I even got through the line, so I didn't even get to taste it that time.)  We made it again tonight for a family dinner.  As I suspected the first time--there isn't enough sauce.  If the tomato sauce was doubled, I believe this recipe would be a 5-star.  The cheese mixture has wonderful flavor , so we will be making this often but will be doubling the sauce.

This was fantastic!  Of course, like so many others I modified the recipe.  I sliced up 1 Italian sausage link and cooked it with the hamburger.  I added 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning; I used 1/2 of 12oz can of tomato sauce and 1 12 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  I added to eggs to the cottage cheese and sour cream and I left out the cream cheese, green onions and Parmesan cheese.  My recipes makes 6 servings at 465 calories a serving.  My husband and I just raved all weekend we loved it so much.  One more thing, when you take it out of the oven (we baked it for 25 minutes) let it sit for about 10 to 15 minutes -- the flavors meld and the taste is great.

We love this.  My grandma makes it, and we always devour it.  We just mix the meat and cheese mixture together, then add it to the noodles and bake it.  Much easier!!!

We love this recipe and have made a similar version for 45 years.  I like to increase the onion, cream cheese and sour cream which makes a very creamy layer.  I also increase fresh ground black pepper.  It freezes well and is travels easily.

This is the same recipe that my mom always used when I was a kid.  It was always my favorite, and I requested it for birthday dinners.  When I make it now I always wish I could eat the whole pan. :)

omg delicious. used a reviewer's suggestion of prepared tomato sauce. I always have a bag of frozen pepper/onion mix on hand so used that with hamburger. it doesn't form a solid mass (like lasagna) so maybe everything could be mixed together instead of layering, but I layered it like recipe called for. and here's the clincher for me: my toddler loved it. thank you for this recipe, it's a welcome change from boring noddles & hamburger combo

Loved this! Took advice of others to add more sauce (using 1/2 jar of pasta sauce). I used Ricotta cheese instead of cream cheese & leeks instead of green onions (what I had in the fridge). Large shell pasta. So delicious! Didn't last long in our house!

I helped my 12 yr old make this tonight.  We followed the recipe exactly.  The family didn't think it was all that great.  Not nearly enough sauce.  Plus, I can do without the layering in a seperate dish and baking too.  Next time I make it, if there is ever a next time, I will mix everything together in the pan I make the sauce in.  I think it also needs more meat and cheese for this amount of pasta.  I also skipped the green onions...didn't have any.  Not sure if that would have added anything to the dish....probably not.  Thanks anyway.

This was better than okay, but not great, IMO.  I think I over cooked the pasta and I'm not too crazy about cottage cheese, but I try to follow a new recipe exactly as written.  I made one dish for a friend in need, and she said her whole family loved it, though.

This was good, but not great.  I did leave out the bell pepper because I did not have it on hand.  It actually tastes like a creamy hamburger helper.  My 6 and 4 yo did not like it.  My husband and I enjoyed it but it won't make our regular rotation.

Okay, I made a lot of changes to simplify and make it quicker. I used spaghetti noodles, broken in half, for the pasta. I used a 26-ounce can of spaghetti sauce, a small can of mushrooms, no cottage cheese, and I doubled up on the sour cream. I combined the meat sauce with the cheese and sour cream and layered noodles and sauce twice. It was really good! Thanks for sharing, Donna!

I made this one day after work last week,
and it was so quick and easy.  I used mini lasagna noodles for the casserole, and followed the recipe exactly, it came out so cheesey and great!  It tasted like lasgna but without the work!  I like the cream cheese and cottage cheese combo better than ricotta cheese.  Leftovers were great also.  It's a keeper!!

This was a really tasty recipe! I had to change the filling a bit though because I didn't have any cottage cheese, or green pepper. I ended up using:
1/2 cup light cream cheese
3/4 cup sour cream
1 cup grated motzza
1/2 cup yellow pepper
It turned out really yummy though! I loved the combination of the tangy filling with the almost sweet meat and tomatoe sauce. Very good! Will deffinetly have this again.

I followed the recipe as for the most part. I used a 26 ox jar of sauce instead of the two cans and I used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef. It has a nice taste but could use more of the cheese filling. Next time I will double that part or maybe triple and add an extra layer of cheese.

We really liked this and I would have given 5 stars but I made several modifications one by accident and some on purpose- didn't have green pepper,took other reviewer's advice for more sauce and added 26 oz. tomato sauce, accidentally added a 16 oz. cottage cheese instead of 8oz. I also mixed everything together based on another reviewer's suggestion. I don't think that was a good idea as the noodles that were not covered with sauce were a little dry. Next time I will make the layers. Overall a good, quick meal that I will make again!

I tinkered with the portions a bit. I used a jar of spaghetti sauce and some extra tomatoe sauce. I also used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 vegy ground round substitute. I didn't use quite as much pasta. I also added a bit of light shredded italian cheese mix. So with all those changes, everyone in my family loved it! This is an easy recipe to "make your own." Thank you.

Instead of making more sauce, I made less pasta. I used a box of Ronzoni's Healthy Harvest rotini (13.25 ounces) and it was the perfect amount for the sauce and cheese mixture.

However, even with some herbs added, the sauce had no depth or brightness. I can't remember the last time I used tomato sauce...I use diced or crushed tomatoes out of season...and that real tomato flavor and brightness was very much lacking. I added a splash of dry white wine and a few red pepper flakes, which helped.

If I make this again (doubtful) I'll use tomatoes and let the sauce cook down. Also, I left the parm off the top...it has plenty of cheese in it already.

This is very good! I used 1lb of ground chicken and 1/4lb of ground beef. Gives it the beef taste without all the beef fat. I also used a full jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce. The whole family liked it which is an unusual event. Made enough to freeze half for a quick meal next week. Loved the recipe and will be using it again. Thanks Donna!

This was a GREAT recipe! The only thing I changed was using jar spaghetti sauce rather than plain tomato sauce.  Very flavourful, and simply put, delicious! Will be making this one again.

This is very similar to the recipe I remember my family using from the back of a Hunts tomato sauce can.  The sour cream and cottage cheese blend and just make this recipe so good.  The only difference in recipes is the addition of green bell pepper which would add a nice crunch and color. Very easy to prepare.

This was a good recipie, but I've tasted better hamburger noodle bakes.  The cheese mix was great, though.  In addition to the ingredients listed, I added some mushrooms.  I think it would have been much better if it had more of that chesse mix-- the next time I make it I'll try it with 50% more cheese.

awesome!  and so easy to make.  i only made a few changes.  i added extra pepper, garlic and tomato sauce.  i also sprinkled in oregano and basil.  instead of removing the beef mixture from the heat after adding all ingredients, i simmered it for about 10-15 minutes.  it cooked down a bit and really added some flavor.  we ate on this for about 3 days!  it was great!

This is a good basic recipe but, right along with other reviewers, I made some adjustments. I used a can a Pizza sauce and a can of mild Rotel Tomatoes. I didn't have any cottage cheese on hand so I decided to throw a little mozzarella and cheddar into the cheese mixture. Lastly I layered in pepperoni with the meat mixture. I guess by the the end it was more of a pizza-ish casserole.. it was delicious!

Didn't have green onions or green pepper so omitted both. Added mozzarella cheese on top of Parmesan.  I would rate it 4 stars but my son and daughter in law both gave it 3 stars.  My daughter in law thought it tasted way too much like cream cheese.  I was starving and liked it pretty well.  If we'd had any bell pepper on hand I think I would have added it to the onion and hamburger mixture and cooked it on the stovetop before putting it in the oven.  I used to make spaghetti pie and I just remember the  pepper being cooked with the meat mixture.

Made this for a potluck. Doubled the recipe and it made two 13x9 casserole dishes. Baked at 350 for 45 mins. I followed the recipe with the exception of replacing the tomato sauce with a 26 oz can of Prego Roasted Garlic and Parmesan sauce. I also mixed everything together instead of layering and topped with both Parmesan and mozzarella cheese. It was a hit at the potluck and I came home with no leftovers. Will make this again!

I have been making this for a long time.  The first time we didn't have bell peppers in the house so used diced green chilies and it added just a little extra kick.  The only ingredient I have to buy extra for this dish is the cream cheese.  I always have the rest on hand.

I added mushrooms, garlic, ginger root, celery.  I sautéed the red pepper with the mentioned veggies, then added the spaghetti sauce.  I mixed the green onion with the cheeses. I layered noodles, spagetti sauce, cheese sauce, noodles, spagetti sauce and cheese sauce.  I topped with shredded cheddar cheese.  I also used half the noodles to fit my baking dish!!!

Really yummy! Next time I would make more sauce. Also, I used about four times the amount of garlic it called for. We love garlic! I also cooked the peppers with the beef and onion. I think they would have been too raw if I hadn't. It would also be good with some Italian sausage mixed in as well.

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was tasty, I liked the cheese filling, but thought it was a bit too much. Next time I will double meat and sauce mixture -- maybe w/italian sausage. Overall, it was really good - a big hit with the kids!

If you like cream cheese, you'll like this recipe.  Very easy to make.  Added worstershire sauce, beef boullion cube, and onions to ground beef.  Also, only used half of the pasta (8 ounces) as the bottom of the casserole.  Layered cheese and half of sauce/beef mixture then put chopped veggies on top (1 carrot, 1 zucchini, 1 cup each of steamed broccoli and cauliflower) then put other half of sauce/beef mixture.  But that's just us since we like veggies in our main meals.  Bake for about 45 min to get the veggies cooked.

This wasn't bad but not terrific either.  We found there wasn't enough meat or sauce and the sauce lacked seasoning.  The cheese mixture was good though.  I am hoping leftovers will taste better.

I made this the other night and it was delicious.  I cut the recipe in half because it's only me and my husband and used a smaller square pan.  I am vegetarian so I replaced the beef with  a 12 oz bag of MorningStar "beef" crumbles.  I put the green peppers in with the beef so that they were a bit softer.  I didn't really understand the need to bake for so long (unless it was to cook real beef) and I left mine in the oven for about 15 minutes when the cheese was melted and it was delicious.  Even my husband (non-vegetarian) loved it.  And we both had it for lunch the next day!

Reall good casserole.  I pretty much followed recipe except I added a can of beef broth to sauce for more moisture, and skipped cream cheese, but added grated cheddar instead.  We enjoyed this a lot!
