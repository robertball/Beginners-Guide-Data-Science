My review is for the idea. I marinated the steak in a good marinade which tenderized the steak and then wrapped it in bacon. I fried it on a cast iron grill pan and turned until the bacon was done. The steak was so tender and the bacon flavor was throughout. I used this for an appetizer but definitely a main dish. I put another steak in the marinade and making another batch for company in the next couple days.
