This is a great recipe. If you like thick and hearty pasta. This is for you. The only concern is that it gets a little thick. I would just add 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream to the cream cheese and it's perfect.

This was an awesome recipe, easy, quick.  I sliced up a couple cloves of garlic and instead of using cream cheese I used non-fat yogurt which took care of the thickness issue and helps with the calories.

I rated this 4 stars because I did some tweeking!  I used thin spaghetti because it was what I had on hand. I added lots of minced garlic , cause we love garlic, and parmesan cheese and just a tiny bit of salt and it made it awesome!  I also used more shrimp because we love shrimp and cooked the spinach with the sauce for just a few minutes just to get it warm!  Yummy!  I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day!  It was definitely a hit!

Tried this a couple of weeks ago, I loved it and picky hubby did it too!  I bought the heavy cream as another reviewer suggested using, but found that I didn't need it.

Excellent starter for cleaning up the holiday leftovers.   I added a few things to our taste and you can try and tweak as you like...   We love garlic, so I sauteed a couple of cloves in butter and then added the tomatoes and Light Philly cream cheese spread and added a couple of tsps of Onion soup mix, pepper, old bay seasoning, parmesan cheese and a splash of white wine to thin.  I needed to use up leftover cooked shrimp & added them - then tossed the cooked noodles and the spinach in the pan & served hot.  Would have been fantastic with some Garlic bread or Bruschetta - maybe next time!   Hope I can get into my dress for New Years Eve!   LOL!!!

The name says it all.  The perfect dish, in my opinion.  I am a pasta fanatic & I love the cream cheese taste of this...completely refreshing & unique.  This is a very romantic dish, meant to be served with wine & music.  And you will certainly be in love with this dish once you taste it!  :0)

Tasty, easy meal.  My husband loved it, I made it 2 weeks in a row!  It needed a bit of salt.

Surprisingly good! Although, I did add oregano, garlic, lemon juice and parmesan. Family really enjoyed this too.

This is good, however instead of tomatoes, I diced up a red pepper and sauted it with minced garlic. Add the spinach and then I added 1/2 cup reduced fat chicken broth and melted the cream cheese in the broth, and let it simmer. Everyone wants the recipe. My husband loves it.

It was okay. I used lower-fat cream cheese, so I suppose the full-fat version is what makes it awesome. I'd have to experiment to see how to keep the dish healthy and tasty.

AMAZING! I used sundried tomato and basil philly cream cheese spread and I used the whole tub. I added minced garlic, pepper, and a splash of lemon juice. It was nice and creamy. I also added about half a cup of parmesan cheese to the cream cheese mixture before I tossed it with the pasta. This was so good and reminded me of the bistro shrimp pasta from the cheesecake factory. With that in mind, I will probably bread the shrimp next time I make this recipe :)

Great flavor, especially if you use a flavored cream cheese such as onion and chive but definitely needs a bit of heavy cream to thin.

This was a great dish, I didn't have the spinach on hand, but needed to get rid of some shrimp.

I LOVE this recipe. I make it for my family when seafood is the major craving hehe.. Its also good if you use chicken instead of shrimp, just in case you have someone who doesn't like shrimp, or is alergic to fish.. I recommend trying it with chicken once.. it is AWESOME!

Simple and good.  I agree - a little extra seasoning would not be amiss.  Next time I will try using diced tomatoes with garlic, at least.  Possibly some balsamic or red wine vinegar would help to jazz it up, also.

It was quick, easy, and good. I modified it by adding some grocery purchased cooked lobster and probably used a little more cream cheese. I only give it three stars because I have had a similar dish because and that other dish seemed richer. It was probably higher calories. :) Don't shy away from this recipe as I said, it was good.
