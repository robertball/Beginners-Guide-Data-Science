It's more than a 'nice try'.  If you look at the list of ingredients, it doesn't have a lot of spice.  A pkg of taco seasoning goes a long way if that's what you're used to. Taste the meat mixture before you make the burrito's...add seasoning accordingly. This is a 15 minute recipe, it's not meant to be gourmet, but if you're looking for a quick, filling recipe, this is good. As the description says, it's a basic recipe.  Jalapeno cheese, salsa, and sour cream make an excellent addition in my opinion.

This is a really good idea and is a great basic recipe like the description says. I spiced mine up a lot and it turned out great. I did try it plain and it was good, too and it works well when the pantry is running low. As far as "What happened to fresh ingredients and fresh spices and herbs?" get real! fresh is awesome, but when I'm in a hurry I don't have time for all that. Not every one here has the time or skill to do those things. You have to keep in mind that less skill = more time.

I think this recipe is a great start. I gave it 4 stars because it gave me a good basis and practically everything to start with. This was my first time making burritos ever. I basically followed the recipe exactly except that I added a few things. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, used the oregano and garlic powder as well but I added my own favorite seasoning which is goya adobo all purpose seasoning with pepper to give it more flavor. As well as a cheap taco seasoning which I picked up at the local supermarket. On top of the refried beans I added canned black beans and some white rice I previously made. I think it came out great I'll definitely make it again. I also have enough to last practically all week. And instead of store bought tortillas I made my own from scratch with a recipe from this site. They came out perfect I'm really proud for it to be my first time.

Garlic powder, dried oregano, prepared salsa? What happened to fresh ingredients and fresh spices and herbs? This recipe is very bland and boring.  1 star because that is the min I could give.

Very, very good.  See notes for alterations to recipe.  To serve, after wrapping the burritos, microwave again for 30 sec. to 1 min. to heat the tortilla shells.  Serve topped with sour cream, salsa, chopped green onions, etc.

This was a great, quick, and easy recipe that will be used in the future. I did add my own twist to it. I bought just over a pound of ground beef and seasoned it with Lawry's seasoning salt, pepper, oregano, and a dash of garlic salt. Once the meat was done & drained, I added one packet of chipotle taco seasoning, about 3 tablespoons of water, the salsa, and refried beans (w/green chiles). I forgot the mexican blend cheese so I used what I had on hand. Fixed Spanish rice as a side along with the lettuce, tomato, & sour cream toppings. Mmmm, mmm, good!

I really liked this recipe.  It was quick and easy.  I did doctor it up a bit by substituting cilantro for the oregano and I also added, salt, pepper, onion powder and a dash of hot chili powder for extra flavor.  My husband loved it too.  I will definitely keep this recipe on hand for when I don't have a lot of time to cook!

I think this is a great no nonsense recipe. Anyone who has eaten at an AUTHENTIC mexican restaurant knows that you will never eat a taco or a burrito made with packaged seasonings that contain over a dozen ingredients that most of us can't even pronounce. That said, you  can doctor this up using any ingredients you would like. I added onion & garlic while browning the meat and a 1/2 tsp of cumin, salt & pepper to taste. Once you've made the basic recipe, let your imagination and your pantry be your friend. I've added as someone else suggested some whole black beans, I've used a few whole pintos & some leftover rice. Another time I added a can of green chili peppers and some chopped bell pepper while browning my beef along with the onion & garlic. Experiment with different cheeses, left over chopped chicken, etc.  Thank you for a great basic recipe that allows the cook to make it their own.

This was a simple and quick recipe to prepare.  I added 1/2 lb of mild Italian sausage, a tbs of cumin, 1 tsp cayenne,  and used italian seasoning instead of the oregano.  With no salsa on hand I used 1/2 cup of of diced tomato, 1/2 cup diced onion and 1/2 water to provide moisture and to blend seasonings after browning the seasoned meat.  I placed the rolled burritos in a 9x13" baking dish, smothered them with green enchilada sauce and a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese,  covered baking dish with foil and baked at 350% for 20 min. Serve with sour cream. We make burritos often but my wife said these were the best she's ever had!

Great little recipe for tasty burritos. I used garlic salt, Pace medium taco sauce and only half the can of beans. As it is the filling was on the mushy side and very loose and wet. Fast and easy for a quick hot meal. Thanks!

I liked this recipe. I added crushed red pepper,about 1/8 teaspoon, when I put in the other spices mentioned in the recipe.  Used a very mild salsa so the red pepper did not make it too hot.

This is easy and it is pretty darn good!  I did add some additional seasonings to the beef, but this recipe is pretty forgiving.  Thanks for sharing.  My husband actually said it was better then a lot of other meals that are time consuming.

Well... this is a good, basic recipe that can be tailored to your liking. First off- ditch the dried oregano. Unless it's Mexican oregano, and then I guess you can proceed. I used cumin, cayenne pepper, onion powder and a bit of chili powder. Then, I heated the beans separately and kept the salsa (fresh) separate as well. Once the beans were heated, I scooped that onto the tortilla, then added the meat, then the cheese and salsa (also added some sour cream and diced jarred jalapenos). I didn't like the idea of mixing the beans and salsa with the meat. It seems the flavors would all compete with each other and end up just a mushy mess. I thought the end result was just "okay" but the bf really enjoyed them. I might try it again sometime.

This recipe is a fantastic starting point, or really basic idea. Quick and easy.  I hadn't made burritos before tonight so I was looking for a quick and easy solution to hubby's request. I'm not a fancy cook. 
I changed just one thing, I used a full pound of hamburger. I added 2 things- chopped onion to the cooking meat, and a sprinkle of chili powder.  This was just personal preference from previous cooking. 
This recipe helped me figure out what to include to make burritos, and my husband and I both loved them!

Tasty. I used black beans instead of refried because I did not have refried beans.

I made a couple changes to this but it was essentially the same.  I used 3/4 lb ground beef and instead of typical salsa, I used a brand of Mexican tomato sauce called El Pato that has lots of chiles and garlic in it (the kind in the yellow can).  It's smooth like tomato sauce and pretty spicy.  Put 1/4 cup of the sauce into the filling and spooned the rest on top of the burritos, sprinkled with cheese, and microwaved.  Talk about delicious and fast!

These are yummy! :) I omitted oregano & salsa, added onion powder & nutmeg to meat seasoning (altho I used turkey meat), and added taco seasoning when I combined the beans, and wrapped in tortillas with cheese. Brushed with olive oil, and baked in oven for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees. Served with Spanish rice. Thank you for a good recipe!

Quick, go-to supper. Great for busy people that just have to get supper on the table.  Reviewers are right, it's not gourmet - but that's not what I was looking for. Used turkey & fat free beans & served with rice. Thank you for posting!

I've had a can of refried beans hanging out in the cubbard for awhile and I keep looking at it saying "how can I make these amazing?" Haven't tried this recipe yet but it sure sounds like it will do the trick and quickly!! Can't wait to try it and perfect it.

I made these burritos for the first time tonight and they were delicious! Nothing fancy, of course, but they were very simple to make and the taste was above average... of course we put alot of seasoning on it though, including oregano, pepper, garlic powder and seasoned salt.. but mm. even my 2 year old enjoyed it.

This is a great basic recipe. It's so quick and easy for a weeknight when cooking seems like too much work (and we all have those nights).  This is a go-to, busy weeknight recipe that you can doctor up with whatever you like to your own tastes.  Thanks!

This was a very basic recipe and may have great potential but I don't think that we will use it again. The meat is very bland and when mixed with the beans, even blander. I will just stick to the packaged burrito seasoning (and if I don't have any on hand I won't make burritos!) Maybe someone else will be able to spice it up more.

I was looking for something simple and fast that my picky eaters would eat. So it’s a win all around. Plus I pretty much always have these ingredients or something that will substitute so it’s great for last second ideas.

Simple and tasty. I make 30 at a time and freeze them. I eat them for lunch everyday. I add an old el paso burrito mix pouch to it.

A major hit tonight! 
I left out refried beans...didn't have any on hand.  Added a package of taco seasoning. And rather than just sprinkle cheese on top, I mixed it into the beef mixture. Put the rolled up burritos into a 9x13" pan, put some of thw saucy stuff that didn't fit into burritos on top of them along with a dollop of sour cream. Then put into 350° oven for 15 minutes.

Cheap, fast, easy, filling. Nothing fancy but you can season to your taste. I make them lower sodium because of diet restrictions. They're not bad left overs either.

really good comfort food and good for the whole family. easy to spice up a little more for those who need it but calmly flavourful enough to please the pickier eaters. it's a keeper. - serve with spanish rice. it tastes great to have both inside the burrito.

My husband and I loved these!  They are SO simple, inexpensive, and yet delicious.  I added a little extra salsa to finish off the jar and was glad that I had.  It helps the beans not be boring.  I also like my burritos to be a little crispy or stiff, so after I rolled them I placed them in a hot pan for a couple minutes (no oil, just heat).  Overall they are great and I plan on making them again soon :)

It's a great basic recipe and completely wonderful after you top it with cheese,jalapeno, and sour cream! It's like subway add whatever you want on top of it to customize it to your liking. Enjoy and happy cooking.

I made this with mild salsa because my three kids (all under 6 years old) were eating it.  It was great.  They didn't even know they were eating salsa. It was a little on the mild side over all, but there was enough flavor to make it enjoyable for Mom and Dad, and not too much to make it unbearable for the kids. I would have used medium or hot salsa if the kids weren't eating... but then, when are the kids not eating ;).  I didn't have cheese, and it was great even without cheese. I rated it a 5 because this is quick, easy, delicious, filling, and would be very easy to add to to fit various tastes.  I'll definitely be making this again, especially when I'm running late, but don't want to eat really late.

The flavor was very good and I like the fact that it uses ingredients I usually have on hand anyway.  However, I have to say the mixture is really ugly to look at!  To make it more appealing, ask your family members/guests what toppings they would like (lettuce, sour cream, etc.) then serve the burritos already assembled.

Very good starting point when you need a quick easy meal.  I added my own mix of "tex mex" spices and melted cheese on top.  Family loved it.  They said it was like eating at a tex mex resturant at home.

Used leftover ground turkey and some refried beans, of course you had to season the meat a little more and if you like onions add some onions to the ground beef or turkey while it's cooking. Made for a quick dinner tonight. Yummy!

Yummy ! This is an awesome alternative for burritos. So easy and tasty. I add extra salsa and lots of chili powder, about 2-3 tbsp. I don't add the beans.

This was so simple and not spicy!  I loved it. I can't eat spicy foods and I have little ones who don't like spicy foods so this was perfect.  I did tweek it a little tho - I added burrito seasoning instead of the garlic & oregano.  I also added some of the cheese inside the burrito itself and I added lettuce and tomatoes on top of it.

it was way to bland i have to agree when i make my burrito meat i use a little chili powder, some onion salt and regular salt, and season salt, i sometimes throw in some creole seasoning also to spice it up. that makes awsome burritos. nice try though
