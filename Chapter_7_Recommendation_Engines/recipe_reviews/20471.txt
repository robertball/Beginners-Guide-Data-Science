I was shocked at how quick and easy this recipe was!  I reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, and could have gone with 2 or 2 1/4.  At 2, it was still very creamy.  At 2 1/2, it was very thick and probably didn't need to be refridgerated to thicken.  In any case, it was so easy and SO GOOD!  We LOVE it!  I recommend it to all peanut butter fudge lovers.  (You can serve it to friends and family who are not vegan and they would NEVER guess that this fudge IS.)

I have been making pb fudge for years and this is by far the quickest and tastiest yet! Thank you for such an excellent vegan recipe. It was so creamy and smooth. I use a non-hydrogentated vegan butter and I also do not add as much sugar as it calls for, and it has turned out perfect everytime!

WAY too much sugar.  I don't see how it's possible to cram that much sugar in.  I used only 2 cups and still had difficulty getting it all mixed in and then it was so crumbly, I could not get it out of the pan.  Next time, I'll only use 1 1/2 cups.

Was not looking for a vegan recipe, so I used an equal amount of shortening instead, and dotted the top of each piece with chocolate chips.  This was very rich, but also very good.  Very easy recipe!

easy and good!  everyone liked it--I recommend NOT using vegan butter-imitation spread, though.  That is what I used, and although everyone liked it, I thought it tasted kind of funny.  Next time I will just use a regular vegan margarine.  :)

I needed a dessert for a picnic tomorrow and fortunately chose this recipe. I used natural peanut butter and Smart Balance margarine and it was just superb, to say nothing of ridiculously easy. Thank you for sharing this terrific recipe!

Very easy and very tasty--I agree with the other posts that it would be just about impossible to use the amount of sugar in the recipe. I only got 1 and 1/2 cups in mine, but it tasted good! I had non-vegan co-workers asking for the recipe.

I made these with regular margarine and natural crunchy PB and they turned out great. I had to give them away as gifts because I couldn't stop eating them! Note: light PB has much more sugar than regular so use full fat or natural PB.

Outstanding!  I was shocked to find I enjoyed this recipe more than the family peanut butter fudge recipe I'd been using since I can remember!  This recipe was so much easier and loved by everyone - vegans and non-vegans!

Tasty, easy, a little crumbly even with 2 cups of powdered sugar instead of 3 1/2 cups.

I used less sugar as recommended by others.  It tasted great coming out of the pan still warm, but once I refrigerated it the taste changed.  It tasted like a stick of the vegan butter with a peanut taste.  I probably won't make this again.

Love this recipe!  Used a store brand Natural Creamy Peanut Butter plus added a little more, because I have a love for the natural peanut butter.  Gives it a great peanut buttery flavor.  I also cut the confectioner sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  Still gives it a great sweetness.  Two thumbs way up!!! ^_^

Love this. Super easy! I have had good luck with putting the pan in the fridge until it cools, then cutting it. Before removing from the pan, I placed in freezer and the pieces came out more uniform.

I made this recipe for my teenage vegan son.  I found it very simple to make with only three ingredients.  I read reviews ahead of time and adjusted powdered sugar to 2 cups and I used natural peanut butter.  Simple, delicious, and tasty!  Sure I will be making this a lot!

A very good and super easy recipe but one important tip: Use natural peanut butter and also add a tsp. of salt. This may be why some reviewers found the recipe too sweet. The salt really helps to sug through the sugar as well. I like to soften jelly in the microwave, put half the fudge in the pan, spread on the jelly followed by the remainder of the fudge. Its soooo addictive!

I have made this so many times and it always gets rave reviews with veg and non-veg folks alike.  I've served it to fellow tail-gaters, at my wedding rehearsal dinner and all sorts of other events.  I have never reduced the sugar, though I can see where it would be easier to mix and less crumbly if one did.  The only change I always make is that I melt vegan choc chips and spread a layer of that over the top before cooling.  Sometimes I cut the chocolate in to the fudge for a swirled effect.

this was okay. it did have a LOT of sugar so i limited it to 2 cups. that still was too much sugar for me, so next time i'll only use 1 1/2. does have a nice peanut butter-y taste though.

I was not looking for a vegan recipe - just a quick and easy one.  This was perfect.  I used real butter, smooth peanut butter - and then added 1 cup chopped nuts and sprinkled 1 cup chocolate chips over the top while it was still warm.  I waited a few minutes and swirled the chocolate with a knife - very nice!

Mmmm! Sooo good and SO easy! I didn't really do a lot of measuring with this and I didn't even heat it up over the stove. I just dropped some Earth Balance in a bowl then popped it into the microwave for 10 secs. and mixed the powdered sugar and the peanut butter in, formed into a brick and sliced. It was just a lot quicker and I needed something to satiate my sugar craving. Absolutely delicious! I miss the honey in my peanut butter, and for some reason this fills that void. Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy!! I made it in 5 minutes.  I did use butter because that is all I had and it was perfect!  I used natural peanut butter with no sugar in it, so the sweetness was just right!

Not the best fudge I have ever had but still pretty darn good! I followed the directions but added a dash of vanilla extract with the peanut butter. I then added 1/2 cup of cocoa (which I can't believe hasn't been done yet!) and then about 2 cups of powdered sugar. I was worried about it being to crumbly but it ended up being too soft so next time I will add even more sugar. It ended up being pretty good and I will definately make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe. My husband was going crazy when we first became vegan, so I found this recipe and made it (I, too, can not possibly use all the sugar the recipe calls for). My hubby loved it -- and, so did I!

Yum!  My kids loved this.  My daughter asked if we could always have it in the house.  I used shortening instead of margarine.  I thought I could taste the shortening so I am going to use the margarine next time.

Smooth, creamy, delicious, and enjoyed by all (vegan or no).  You'll no doubt find it necessary to decrease the amount of powdered sugar.

i might have given this four or four and a half but the ease with which i made it combined with the fact that i almost always have the ingredients made this tasty treat even better.

So good and ever so easy! This was a hit at a Halloween party. 2 1/4 cups of sugar was the magic amount for me. The fudge set within a couple of hours in the fridge and it did NOT crumble apart. Perfectly delicious!

I made these for my daughter who is allergic to dairy and usually has to set on the sides lines at desert time, what a treat! AND the rest of the family enjoyed them as well! They are really a snap to make.. w/ very little chilling time required.  I used Willow run sticks and adams creamy peanut butter and it worked out great... thanks for shareing!

The recipe calls for too much powdered sugar, so I reduced the powdered sugar to 
2 1/4 cups. I also lined an 8"x 8" glass pan with parchment for easy removal. The fudge turned out creamy and delish!

This is fantastic!  I knocked off one star because----as noted by others--this recipe benefits from a smaller amount of sugar (2 1/4 to 2 1/2 worked for me).  Since I used all natural, salt-free pb, I added a pinch of salt, as well as a splash of vanilla extract.  Once in the pan, I spread some melted chocolate on top.  Now it's in the fridge and I have to refrain myself from picking at it-- it's for my valentine.  Thankfully I know he'll share.

this was really good! i did use less sugar tho, like the other people said, 2 and a half cups, and i added a little bit of sweetened condensed milk to it too to help thin it just a little bit. it was so quick easy and good, and i dont really like peanut butter that much.

followed directions but lowered the amount of suger to 1 1/2 cups.  it never hardened though.  i put it in the fridge for hours, then tried the freezer.  i had nothing to bring to the bake sale.  :(  it's tasty if you like thick peanut butter on a spoon, but it aint fudge.

I made a 1/3 batch and put it in the freezer. I hope it freezes OK! Used Earth Balance for the margarine. It tasted just really good, and I am not a fan of fudge. This is a gift for a cousin. Only 4 stars because the sugar needs to be reduced and you are left on your own, which may intimidate some cooks.

I started making this several years ago and just stumbled upon the recipe.  Looks like I'm not the only vegan-food loving person who's made it up!  This is very, very yummy.  My husband and I call it "Peanut Butter Sugar Butter."  Yum!

I made this non-vegan since I was just looking for a simple PB fudge recipe.  I mixed the pb with the margarine while still over heat, then cooled a couple minutes before adding sugar.  I used 3c and it was a little dry & prone to cracking, but still tasted good.  

Wonderful, super easy recipe.  I made it waiting for the kids to get dressed before school.

Made this Friday nite for Hubby's Airsoft group (a buncha guys!) and everyone absolutely loved it and never knew the diffrence! We all happen to love a bit of grit in our fudge so this was sheer perfection! You can make it creamier by lessening the sugar but we loved it as is!

I agree with everyone else that 3 2/3 cups of sugar is too much.  Next time I will use less.  Otherwise...yummmm

This was soooo easy to make & turned out excellent. My meat and dairy eating relatives loved it, and my aunt (who is the usual fudge-maker of the family was jealous of just how easy & tasty it was. I left it overnight to set, and reduced the sugar to only 3 cups.

really good.  I used regular margarine, next time will try butter.  At first it tastes like only slightly sweetened peanut butter, but then after a couple bites the flavors really blend.  My mom is allergic to almost everything (wheat, dairy, egg, garlic, corn, grape, and various spices), and she loved it!  Especially knowing that she wasn't going to react to it :).  I used about 2 1/4 cups sugar.

I may have missed something, but this did not taste like the fudge my mom used to make.  When I went to cut it into squares they did not come out in individual pieces but very much like cutting butter...  The taste was good, but I like the fudge you can leave out of the fridge and it does not melt.  Any suggestions would be great!!

Too sweet for my tastes.  I also would have liked it creamier.  I followed the ingredients listed, except I used only 2 1/4 cups powdered sugar.  The end result was overly sweet and too crumbly.
