This recipe turned out fantastic. The flavor was clean and fresh.  I doubled the shrimp and peppers for 5 people and we ate the entire thing!  I also added two huge jalepeno peppers and sauteed them with the shrimp but they weren't hot so I don't think they made much difference.  I served it with queso fresca, avocado, salsa, spelt tortillas, and sour cream.  I'm going to make this often, it'll be a great summer supper on the lanai.

Very tasty! However, I just sauteed it all in the same pan (veggies first, then added the shrimp) instead of transferring to a baking dish. Adding jalapeno is a nice touch. Served with sliced tomato and regular tortillas.

I added extra cumin & chili powder and  omitted the cilantro (not popular in our house).  Delicious & healthy!
