This recipe was really easy and really tasty too. However, instead of using water, I substitued beef broth and added potatoes!

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!  My husband was angry with me so after I made it and ate some I went to bed.  When he got home and tasted it, he woke me up to tell me how wonderful dinner was and totally forgot that he was mad at me.  He told me it was the best tasting dish that I had ever made.   
I also used 1lb of ground beef, browned it with 3 cloves of garlic and a small chopped onion.  I exchanged the water for beef broth. I chopped up a green pepper and 1/3 lg box of mushroom too (to clean out the fridge)and added that to the frozen veggies (which were also chopped into smaller bites). I added 1/3 can of kidney beans and two hand fulls of ditalini.  The 1/2c of red wine really topped off the stock. It was super easy to prepare and I will certainly be making it again! Thanks

This soup is awesome!  I made a few changes.  I used stew meat instead of  ground beef, diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  Stewed are too big and also added 1 large potato cut up.

I NEVER make this sort of thing.  The closest is chili.  My family was very scared when they saw it and asked for very small helpings.  Everyone wanted seconds and one of my daughters said "how come this is so good?"  I followed what others had suggested.  Beef broth instead of water, 1# beef instead of 1/2 and I browned the hamburger with a med onion and several cloves of garlic.  Great recipe!

I was a little apprehensive that this soup would not have much flavor, but was pressed for time, so decided to try it.  I browned the ground beef with onions and fresh garlic.  Instead of water, I used beef broth and also added a 1/4 cup of white wine.  I added frozen mixed vegetables with pasta shells.  I also didn't have any tomato sauce, but had pizza sauce, so used that instead.  This soup turned out very delicious!  Even my finicky 7-year-old and 3-year-old loved it.  Thank you for a quick, but delicious soup.

This is amazingly good! I took the suggestion and used a pound of ground beef. I also used two cans of low sodium beef broth instead of water...big difference! I threw in a handful of ditalini pasta just to make it extra hearty. Yummy!!!! The onion soup mix is a GREAT addition! Thank you SO much for sharing this fabulous recipe! We will be making this a lot this winter!!!!

Great soup! We add garlic and onion while browning beef.  Then use beef broth instead of water.  We add 2 potoatoes and 2 small carrots cubed.  Frozen peas and corn.  Very tastey!

This soup was good and very easy and quick.  I used leftover beef from roast and other leftover vegetables.  I also added a little more sugar and a little granulated beef boullion. Very good taste with little effort.

An easy and delicious way to use leftover hamburger meat. I browned my ground beef with minced garlic and onions and also added a touch of red wine to the recipe. The family loved it!

The beauty of this versatile recipe is that you can alter it to your taste.  I did as other reviewers, and used beef broth in place of water (2 cans broth, 4C water)and added onion and garlic to the beef.  I used a full pound of ground sirloin, added small elbow macaroni, cabbage, and white pepper.  For a real flavor booster, I also used about half a jar of Prego traditional pasta sauce in lieu of the tomato sauce, and petite diced tomatoes in place of the stewed tomatoes.  Served with cornbread, this is my new favorite Winter meal!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

I did not expect to like this, but I am sooo glad I tried it anyways.  The onion soup mix and dash of sugar really make it special.  I used a pound of stew meat instead of the ground beef and browned it with onion and garlic.  I threw it in the crock pot with beef broth instead of water and added a couple of diced red potatoes.  It was fabulous!

i am normally a very generous person when it comes to rating but this recipe has to be altered quite a bit to get a truly good soup. the addition of the beef broth is the most important. i also added worcestershire sauce. which i cannot believe was not included in the first place. i only had frozen corn so i used canned italian green beans and sweet peas. with the few changes that we have all made it turns out great! thanks for the base

I have to give this 5 stars although I switched it up quite a bit.  It is SUPER EASY and the greatest base for a delicious soup.  I used 2 and a half 32oz cartons of beef broth (not water), two packages of onion/beef soup mix, a package of baby carrots, canned green beans (what I had on hand), 3 yellow potatoes diced, 2 vegetable bouillon cubes and 1 pound of ground beef that I seasoned with seasoned salt, red pepper flake, cumin and worcestershire.  Browned the beef, tossed it all into a pot then brought to a boil and turned heat to low then simmered for about 35 minutes.  The soup was AWESOME.  It was filling and satisfying with lots of great beef flavor.  This also made a big pot (enough for a few days of leftovers).  Probably the best beef soup ever (though I wonder what pot roast would add?)

This was fantastic soup!!  As recommended by other users I substituted beef broth for the water and sauteed onions & garlic with the ground beef.  Instead of mixed vegetables (not a fan) I added corn, green beans & potatoes.  Also used diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  My husband suggested green chili's next time . . . and there will DEFINITELY be a next time with this recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

Martha's Vegetable Beef Soup Haiku: "So easy to make! Nice comforting bowl of soup. Simmer for longer." I pretty much stuck to Martha's recipe, only taking a hint here or there from some reviews, such as swapping water for beef broth, and adding garlic and onion to the beef as it browned. Oh, and I unintentionally used mexican-seasoned stewed tomatoes, and was happy w/ that. (I think I'd have preferred diced tomatoes instead though, since the stewed, while tasty, are just such a mouthful!) The soup is MUCH better w/ a longer simmer. I had a taste at the directed 20 min. and liked it fine, but let it sit even longer, and it was tastier. W/ a sprinkle of parm on top, we slurped up our bowls declaring it a keeper, a great soup for doubling and freezing batches for the cold nights to come.

I thought this was a good fresh tasting recipe. I used leftover steak and canned green beans with frozen peas and carrots. My husband loved it and actually ate all the leftovers (that never happens).

This soup was so easy, and probably the best veggie soup I have ever eaten.  I meant to follow the directions more closely, but the end product still came out fabulous.   I substituted tomato soup for tomato sauce, and didn't have the frozen veggie mix on hand so I subbed a can of corn, 2 diced potatoes, 1 cup each of frozen green beans and peas, and shredded carrots.  I used beef broth instead of water as well.  The key to this soup's flavor is the onion soup mix, I used two packets (because I increased veggies) of beefy onion soup mix (Kroger brand)  and added a little water as well.  The result was perfect, not too much of a tomato flavor like some soups, but more of a rich beefy onion flavored broth.  I will definitely make this again.

I do make quite a few changes to this soup. First, I use Beef Stock instead of water.  I use ground turkey instead of beef, and I add one can of  rinsed Kidney beans and  one chopped up potato. I substituted diced tomatoes for stewed. I also add indivdually my own mix of frozen veggies.  After browning the meat I put it all in a Crock Pot to cook all day on low.  Definately put it on High for 4-5 hours if you can't cook it all day.  The longer it cooks the better.

The first time I made this soup, I used leftover browned ground beef.  To make up for no drippings, I sauteed onions in bacon grease, then added the vegetables and cooked until thawed and sizzling.  Finally, I added the rest of the ingredients and followed the recipe.  Except, I didn't have tomato juice, so I added 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste. The second time, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My husband & I both agreed that the vegetables were more tender the first time.  Next time, I'll add cooking the veggies a little as a preliminary step.  Also, the tomato paste added a richer flavor.  Not a more tomatoey flavor, but more depth.

This is the first thing I made on all recipes. My mom is in hospice and is losing her ability to swallow. So, her options on what she can eat are pretty limited. This was WONDERFUL! She absolutely loved it! Making this soup is what got me hooked to this website, so thank you.

Good base for a quick soup.  Needs some doctoring though, or else it will taste fairly generic.  Beef base, red wine, fresh celery, garlic, parsley, white beans, italian seasoning and worcestershire were some of my additions.

So Good!  This cleaned my fridge out of leftovers! I added left over pot roast instead of ground beef, chopped carrots, celery, half a mayan onion and garlic. I also added 1 Tbl italian seasoning, speghetti sauce since I didn't have any tomato sauce. The diced tomatos came out of my freezer from this year's crop.  I simmered for hour and the last 20 minutes I added frozen peas.  Served with fruit salad (had to get some fruit on the table with a 2 year old!), garlic bread and a baked potato for my husband since he is not a big soup eater. Everyone in the family loved it, turned out more like stew than soup - but it tasted great!

DELISH!  I had left-over beef from last night's roast, so I chopped that in place of ground beef.  I also added Italian seasonings to taste.  I liked the addition of the sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes.  This recipe will be kept to use again and again.  Thank you dkennedy for sharing your recipe!

I do not eat meat so I altered it a bit.  I had soy ground "beef"  I used veggie broth instead of water, added two potatoes and carrots.  In addition the mixed frozen veggies, I added some frozen spinach and a bit of time and black pepper.  It was amazing, quick, and easy!!! I will definitely make it again!

Five star ease with a 3 star taste. Mostly 'cause the onion soup mix stayed too prominent. An excellent duo with Beef Noodle Shepherd's Pie -- they have similar ingredients, one with tomato, one with potato.

This was my very first time making soup, but I am SO glad I chose this recipe! I took suggestions from other reviewers and used beef broth, I also added 1/4 cup of milk and a few tablespoons of cornstarch just to make it a little thicker, and it was the perfect consistency. I'll definitely be keeping this recipe around.

I used fresh tomatoes from the garden to substitute the stewed tomato & the tomato sauce in a can.  Overall, this dish is pretty decent and something easy to prepare and good for a hot summer day.

My husband and brother loved this one.  I substituted the stewed tomatoes with tomato juice.  Turned out great.  I took other suggestions and used garlic and onion also. Will make again!

Good basic soup. Quick, easy and tasty.

I didn't have stewed tomatoes so instead I used two cans of tomato sauce. As others users suggested, I used beef broth and cooked the ground beef with onions and garlic for extra flavor. 

We loved it and I will definitely make it often.

I wasn't too sure if my hubby would like this because he's picky about veggies, but the rave reviews convinced me to give it a try.  I'm glad I did because he ended up going back for a second serving!  This is the best vegetable soup I've tasted!  As another reviewer suggested, I browned the meat with an onion and 3 pressed garlic cloves.  I took out the tomatoes (hubby doesn't like), and added a zucchini to compensate to the lack of tomato.  It's a real versatile recipe because you can use whatever veggies suit your taste. It was super quick and easy to make too.

A great recipe for a fast nourishing meal.  I do not use the onion soup mix; instead I sautee onions and garlic in olive oil and add to the browned meat.  I also prefer to use more ground beef for a heartier soup. I have used a dash of worcestershire and red pepper for more zip.  I even used spaghetti sauce when I did not have tomato sauce in the cupboard. Top finish it off, sprinkle fresh shredded parmesan cheese on top of the soup. Yum!

As some other reviewers suggested I used a pound of ground beef and sauteed with garlic and onion. Used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and just broke them up with my hands as I was adding them. I used half low sodium beef broth and water for the liquid, and added 1 tsp Italian Seasoning, 1 tsp Crushed Red Pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp. black pepper, & 1 Bay Leaf. I let it simmer for about an hour instead of the 20 mins, but it came out really, really good! A great soup and what a dollar stretcher!

This is a fast and easy recipe.  I had to use a variety of canned, frozen, and fresh veggies due to what was on hand.  Added barley that had already been cooked in beef broth.  Used a whole pound of ground beef, forgot the can of tomato sauce, and added salt and pepper and about 1 T of worcestershire sauce.  Also used beef broth instead of water.  This is a good recipe that can be tweaked to your preferences and what you have on hand.  This was my first time ever making soup with ground beef.

This was really good. I sautéed some onion with the hamburger. I was out of stewed tomatoes so I just used a can of reg old diced ones, and I completely forgot the sugar but didn't miss it at all. The soup had fantastic flavor and was a great way to use up all of those little left over bags of veggies I Had in the freezer.

This broth tasted good, but I won't make this again as I think that I am just not a fan of this kind of soup.  If you like frozen mixed veggies, however, you will probably like this as well.

I Love this recipe.  VERY VERY good soup.  The only change I made was to use beef broth instead of the water.  I read several of the reviews and several people had made this change and so did I.  It turned out great and is a super easy dinner.  I would recommend you try this.  Amanda

What a wonderful recipe!  When I make vegetable soup it usually seems a little bland, but this was not the case tonight.  Very flavorful.  I doubled the recipe, added a can of kidney beans, and cooked the beef with a whole yellow onion and 3 cloves of garlic.  I also subbed beef broth for the water.  So easy to make, was inexpensive, and healthy.  Will surely make this often all winter long.

Fast, easy, flavorful! 

Made mine with beef & diced onions, beef broth instead of water, and a frozen veggie mix of peas/carrots/corn/green beans in addition to all the other ingredients. 

Only issue was the onion soup mix I used (walmart) was very salty. Next time I will use either half the walmart variety or try a different brand.

I doubled the recipe and froze half for later.My husband who never eats leftovers ate this soup till it was all gone. I added a cup of red wine(remember I doubled the recipe)and that is what gave the flavor more depth. Great recipe,I will use it often.

This is the easiest and most delicious beef vegetable soup I have ever made.  My husband loved it, which makes it a keeper in my box.
I used beef broth instead of water, and doubled the meat like other reviewers suggested.  Delicious!

I was very pleased with this recipe.  Tasted like it had been simmering for hours.  I may go less with the onion soup mix next time if my husband lets me, he loved it just the way it was!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Not only is this soup really good & easy to prepare, but it's super cheap to make!!  I made several modifications:  1 lb gr beef, beef broth instead of water, only 1/2 tsp sugar, and added 1/2 c red wine, 2 tsp garlic powder, 1 can sliced potatoes, and some pepper.  I'll definitley make this again!  :)

This was a great soup! I did everything exactly except I used a whole pound of beef instead of 1/2. The onion soup mix just made it, gave it that unusual kick in this soup. I'll gladly make this again.

I've made this soup several times and I, too, have altered it for my family's taste and texture.  I now  use one medium onion with only 1 TBS. of onion soup mix because of the sodium content. I changed the water to low sodium beef broth and use petite diced tomatoes.  I want to thank dkennedy for posting this recipe.  It gave me a good basis for a lovely easy soup.

Really good. I gave it five stars, though I made it with some modifications.

 I also added beef broth instead of water, like so many others, and added a bit of rotini noodles in. 

I did end up with a package of meat that was close to a pound and a half, that I cooked with some sauteed onions and garlic. I added a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and a small can of paste, then added only the two cups of broth. I guess mine came out a lot thicker than intended--I think I added more veggies than recommended too, but didn't measure.  Put some ciabatta bread on the side, and it was a hit. My picky kids liked it too. (Someone else said that in their review, but I was skeptical.) I'll definitely make it again.

I made this soup today, very easy, quick and delicious. I added a few things after reading other reviews.  I used ground turkey, added some chopped onion, green pepper and garlic when browning.  Also used beef broth instead of water, and added a bay leaf and one dried chili pepper while simmering.  I will be making this often.

This was easy and you should smell my kitchen! Mmmmmm, and it tasted delicious. I used a lb. of meat and cooked it with season all and a dab of minced garlic. I used 1 and 1/2 envelopes of beefy onion soup mix and didn't measure to see if it was 1/4 c. or not. Half chicken broth and half water, and a 10 oz. can of cream of tomato soup since I didn't have sauce. I also tossed in a couple of small potatoes diced up. This did require more liquid than called for so I added more broth and more water (another cup of each) then simmered it. And because I just had to, I tossed in a bay leaf and a little fresh ground black pepper. My husband gave this 5 stars and is definitely taking the leftovers for lunch. He loves soup and really raved on this one. Thanks for such a versatile and easily adaptable recipe!

I loved this ! It was cheap and easy and delicious. I will make in the again and again. I diddnt use frozen veggies though, just carrots onions and potatoes. I also split  the onion mix with the savory herb and garlic soup mix and it rocked.. cooked for an hour and a half. In future Ill saute celery with my onions.

I thought this was just so-so. I felt like it was missing something. It was kinda bland. I made it pretty much as written, except I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used diced. And I added a couple beef bouillon cubes.

Wow.  This soup is FAN TASTIC.  All I had was a full lb of ground turkey and an old 16 oz bag of frozen veggies.  Used it all and followed the rest of the directions (used chicken broth instead of water).  Kids loved it.  Grown ups loved it too.  Super Easy.

GREAT!!  I used 1 lb ground turkey and beef broth instead of water.  I added stevia instead of sugar as my husband is diabetic.  I also added more water as I like it soupy.  So simple, thanks!

Only thing keeping me from giving this 4 stars is my mom's vegetable-beef soup (slow-cooked with stew meat, barley and just about every vegetable you care to name). Having said that, thought it was very good for a quick-cook soup option. Will definitely make this one again and play around with it a bit. Thanks for the recipe.

I also instead of water added 1 can of beef broth and doubled the meat with garlic and onion.  I'm wondering if I should have added 2 cans of beef broth instead of 1.  I like mine more like soup than stew I guess.  Also, I had to add salt and pepper for more flavor.  I did enjoy this though and next time I will try with 2 cans of beef broth.

My husband was a little leary of the hamburger meat in the soup but ended up really loving it,  I;ve made it many times since and have improvised every time.  I use a base of frozen mixed vegies but add whatever I have in the frig.  Great dinner with a loaf of french bread.

I added 2 beef bouillon cubes, some freshly ground black pepper, and a dash of garlic salt to give it just a little more flavor. I also substituted diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes.

Made a few modifications and both my husband and my toddler loved this!  I sauteed an onion and some garlic along with the beef, used spaghetti sauce (instead of plain tomato sauce), beef broth (instead of water), added 1 can of butter beans and several good dashes of Worcestershire.  Really tasty served with hot cornbread.  A very hearty meal!

I only gave this 3 stars because my husband said he liked it. I really thought it was just okay. I added garlic to the beef and used beef broth instead of water as previously suggested. The onion soup did add a nice flavor, but other than that, it was very average.

I used some suggestions from other reviewers and doubled the meat, added an onion, macaroni shells, green pepper, and a splash of red wine.  I also added about a third cup of honey, which I thought really enhanced the flavor.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

A hearty and tasty beef-veggie soup, though using 2 cups beef broth PLUS some additional water is mandatory to keep the soup from getting too thick.

(I used some mini-stars pasta and probably used a bit too much...I'll try barley or kidney beans next time.)

I seasoned the ground beef with salt & pepper during browning (use a full pound as it's been suggested!), and I doctored the soup with garlic salt and crushed red pepper near the end.

Excellent and easy!  I made a few adjustments based on comments. I added 1/2 chopped onion and 2 cloves minced garlic to the ground beef. Some ingredients I didn’t have on hand, so I substituted rotelle tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes and a can of tomato soup for the tomato sauce. I literally cleaned out my refrigerator of leftovers for this soup - potatoes, corn, purple hull peas, pico de Gallo  I also added a couple of beef bouillon cubes and a couple of bay leaves. I will definitely make this again!

This is going in the permanent rotation! I followed fellow reviewers footsteps and used broth instead of water. I also added mushrooms, onions, red pepper flakes and garlic while cooking the meat; just personal preference! This recipe is so quick, easy, and hearty! I love it!

Let me start off by saying that I am not much of a cook. That said, I was quite impressed with how this recipe turned out. I read a few of the reviews prior to making it, and I followed some of the suggestions. Namely, I cut up some potatoes and I used diced tomatoes rather than stewed tomatoes. I also used fresh carrots. This will definitely become a staple recipe in our home.

Really tastes good and a snap to make.  I added a small onion and a clove of garlic when browning the meat.  Also substituted a can of beef Broth for the water.  Tossed everything into me instapot (pressure cooker) and cooked for 10 minutes.  By the time I took the dog out, the meal was ready.  A piece of crusty bread compliments the final product.  Highly recommended.

I made this excellent recipe. Instead of tomato sauce I used 2 table spoons of thick and zesty tomato sauce dry mix. 3 beef bouillon cubes with a total of 3-4 cups of water. I used one whole lb. of hamburger. I cut up 5 potatoes, into cubes, and added them last. Once the potatoes finished  the soup was ready to devour!!! Wonderful recipe!!! Thank you All Recipe app & also a special shout out to Martha!

Although I followed another reviewer's suggestions and added onion and garlic to the meat and potatoes to the soup, I am giving this recipe five stars because it is still a great recipe on its own while it lends itself to making changes to suit one's own tastes. My husband was sick and wanted vegetable beef soup for dinner, and although I had never made homemade soup in my life, I decided to make some instead of using the usual canned stuff. I am very glad I did - both my husband and I gobbled up our bowls. Thank you for such an easy, versatile recipe!

I have debated whether to rate this 3 or 4 stars, and finally settled on 3 because as written it is rather bland.  I added chopped onion and garlic to the beef as it browned, I used beef broth in place of the water, and I added crushed red pepper flakes.  This helped, and it was a hearty and decent soup, but I feel it needs even more than these changes to make it great.  Some red wine, maybe a potato or some pasta, and some additional spices would amp it up.  I do think it is a great base recipe and it is easily adaptable- it just needs the addition of some pantry staples to make it worthwhile.

This was amazing!! Perfect base recipe and you can make it into a lot of things. I doubled the recipe, used beef broth instead of water, tomato paste instead of sauce and mixed in my own mix of veggies. Tomorrow I plan to add beans and chili mix to make it stretch further. Delish!!!

This is the best soup I've ever tasted!!  I did follow the advice of some of the other reviews and used beef broth instead of water which was an excellent suggestion.  I thought the ground beef tasted great with the soup but next time I'm going to try beef cubes that you use for stew.  I've used the recipe twice so far and the 2nd time I made it in the crock pot and it was delicious!!

This is wonderful. I added a dash of worcestershire sauce, a dash of white wine and a bay leaf. I used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes. I did not add the sugar.

I did the recipe except subbed fresh mushrooms and canned corn for frozen veggies because that is all I had.  I also used beefy onion soup mix instead of regular for the same reason.  I wasn't in the mood for cooking or ground beef and this changed my attitude.  Really good and ridiculously easy.

Closest so far to my grandmas simple recipe! She used 1 lb gr beef cooked, 2 cans tomato soup, 1 can kidney beans drained, 2 cans alphabet soup, 2 cans mixed vegetables,chopped onion and water. Have thrown together those ingredients for years but didn't have all of them on hand so I tried this recipe and enjoyed it  Thanks!

I made this soup with some left over roast I had. It was very good.  My mother came over for dinner and she even went back for seconds.  It was perfect for a cold winter day.

Highly recommend. Very good but a bit sweet for my liking.  I'm not sure if the sweetness came from the tsp. of sugar, from the canned tomatoes used, or combo.  I, too, increased the ground beef to 1 lb.  Everything else was as the recipe stated.  Will definitely make again. Next time I'll try leaving out the tsp. of sugar.

I liked this! I followed other reviewers' advice and used broth instead of water. I did use stewed tomatoes, I just stuck a kitchen shears in the can and cut them up a bit. I also used fresh veggies in stead of frozen (carrots, green beans, corn cut from the cob, zucchini, bell pepper, diced potato, and fresh tomato). I also sauteed the meat with onion and garlic as others suggested. I guess that seems like a lot of modifications, but really the base was great and it's versatile enough that you can just throw in whatever veggies you have on hand. Thanks!

Delicious soup my family loves, including kids 7 & 10. I was reluctant to use a recipe with frozen mixed vegetables but it makes the recipe so easy and the flavor is great. As most have, I added more beef broth. This recipe is also easy to alter for various flavored broths. Once I added some red wine, other times I sauteed garlic with the ground beef, and added black eyed peas. All soups were great.

This was very good. Although I did make some changes. I also used Beef broth in place of the water (as suggested by others). Instead of frozen vegetables I used a can of corn (drained) an can of lima beans (drained) and I cut a potato into small cubes. I cooked it longer than 20 minutes to allow the potatoes to cook all the way through. I will make this again, and next time I will add an extra 2 tablespoons of onion soup mix for extra flavor.

This is a great recipe.  After reading other reviews, I made a few changes.  Instead of 2 cups of water I used 2 cups of beef broth.  I also added 1/2 cup frozen corn, 2 stalks of celery (chopped), 1 tsp Worcestire sauce, and I sauteed 1/2 onion and 2 cloves of garlic while browning the ground beef.  Thanks for the great recipe- I will make this again!

I made this soup for dinner tonight and it was delicious! My husband had two helpings. I followed other reviews and added beef broth, diced tomatoes, garlic, potatoes, carrots, celery, stew meat, and two cups frozen mixed vegetables. Instead of onion soup mix, i added an envelope of vegetable soup mix. Served with a salad, and rye bread it made a perfect meal for a cold night like tonight.

This is a great recipe!!  It has become a staple in our home.  I've agreed with other reviewers and changed it a little bit. I cook garlic, onion,and one pound of meat first.  Instead of water I use beef broth.  Also, I put in alphabet pasta.  It cooks quick and is very good.

I loved this soup!  Just made it for the first time tonight and it was perfect for a rainy, windy and wet winter dinner.  I followed reviewer tips of adding an onion, crushed garlic and red wine to this dish with stunning results.  The beef stock instead of water is also a good tip.  A hearty meal in a bowl when served with crusty bread.  Definitely a keeper.

This soup is great. I have sent e-cards with this recipe to a few members of my family including my loving mother. It's quick and easy to prepare and even quicker to eat. If by chance there are leftovers, it will be better the next day. The only change that I make and that I recommend is doubling the servings. You'll be glad you did. (Also, it is the perfect dip for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich:)

This is delicious!  We will be making this again.  While I was cooking the hamburger I added onion soup mix.  Instead of potatoes I added Alphabet's pasta.  Everyone gobbled it up including my toddler boys.  Thanks

This soup is so good.  I am not big on soup, so when I eat it I want corn bread or something else to go with it.  But this stuff, I can eat by itself and be happy.  I LOVE IT!

Great flavor, good choice for a cold day. I took others advice and doubled the groud beef, used beef broth instead of water, fresh veggies, except for the peas & corn, and 1 small can of undrained kidney beans. (nice addition)  I also cooked 1 c of orzo on the side and added it to the soup when served.  Didn't want the orzo to overcook. Your choice of extra spices is always a nice touch!

I thought this was a wonderful tasting soup and was very easy to put together.  I work full-time and I'm always looking for meals that taste like you've slaved over them but only take 30 mins or less.  Great served with grilled cheese sandwiches or just some good italian or sourdough bread/rolls.  I did double the meat and also doubled the water and tomato sauce and added a can of kidney beans - also very good.

Great recipe that the whole family loved!  I added pasta and kidney beans as substitute for the meat it was just right. I will definately be making this many times throughout the winter.

Delicious and so easy!  We used beef boullion like the others suggested, and we like things spicy so added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1/2 tsp. pepper and 2 tsp. sugar.  We love to dip our bread and butter in the tasty broth.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

An elderly friend gave me this recipe years ago.  I have made it many, many times.  It is one of my favorite soup recipes.  My family loves it.  I am making it for supper tonight in my crockpot.  I can't wait to get home to eat a big bowl on this cold, cold day.

I doubled the recipe and used Instapot.  I used rotel for 1 of the cans of tomatoes, we like spicy.  I used beef cut into cubes for stew meat instead of the ground beef.  I added 2 cups of cubed potatoes, instead of a 2nd bag of vegtables.  It was amazing!!!!!  This is my new favorite soup.

I have made this twice. Once as the recipe was written and then once with the suggestions others had given. SO, my rating is as the recipe was posted. To me and my husband it was bland and not enough hamburger. BUT, thank you for the basis for the start of an easy soup.

I doubled the recipe and like others I tweaked it. I used beef stewing meat cut into 1/2 in pieces or smaller. Sauteed one chopped medium onion with a teaspoon of minced garlic in olive oil for a few minutes before adding the beef. Once the beef was browned I added the rest of the ingredients substituting beef broth for the water. I also added about a tablespoon of worcester sauce, a half tsp pepper and a couple shots of hot sauce. After a delicious sampling I zip-lock bagged the remainder in 2-portion amounts for the freezer and future enjoyment.

My mother used to make a version of this soup. And it was absolutely delicious. Ive got her recipe and I make this a lot. Excellent with a pan of cornbread or crackers. Every time I make her recipe it brings tons of memories of her. Ive made changes in the notes to match my mother’s recipe. But both versions are excellent.

Incredibly good and SO easy!  I followed the directions and several of the recommendations (doubled the ground beef, added potatoes, and substituted beef broth for the water).  My wife and I agreed to make this again immediately.

This was really good. Even better the next day after it thickened. 
After reading other reviews, I changed a few things. I used beef broth instead of water. I always cut up the stewed tomatoes when I put them in soup. I doubled the ground beef and cooked it with half an onion. I also added a cup of cooked instant brown rice when it was finished. Easy and filling!

Really delicious. I altered it a little. I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used store bought  spaghetti sauce. Instead of the frozen vegetables I used a can of peas and frozen carrots. Barley would be amazing in this, so I think I'll buy some and add it. Very good and a keeper! Thank you, dkennedy!

Good simple soup. 
I added a 15oz can of broth & 1/8c of red wine.
Substituted 2 tablespoon of sautéed onions and garlic rather than the powdered onion soup mix.
Simmered for a couple of hours.
I'm thinking of serving this with some cauliflower gnocchi (Trader Joe's carries a good frozen one) added in to mimic pasta.

This turned out great! I made a few substitutions as others recommended; I used a 1 lb. of ground beef which I sautéed with garlic cloves and onions, used pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce, replaced the water with beef broth and topped everything off with 1/2 c. of red wine

I love this because it’s so simple and perfect for a chilly night. I made it all in crock pot. I made a few adjustments,  substituted beef broth for the water and added some potatoes.  I also added barley after cooking for recommended time, I added another 20 min for that. It was so tasty and with a few oyster crackers, I was all set. Thanks for a new regular on my table.

This was really good and easy base soup! I didn't have onion soup mix, so I just used a regular onion and 1 clove of garlic. I also used half beef broth and half water. Will definitely make again.

So I will start by saying I have never made Beef Vegetable Soup before and honestly, I haven't eaten it much either. So I can into this not sure what it was really supposed to taste like. At my house, there are 6 so I always add extra meat. I started by using 2lbs of 80% ground beef and 1 large chopped onion and about 1 TBS of minced garlic with a bit of olive oil in my Ninja slow cooker on stove top setting. Browned all the meat, drain some of the grease but not all. I find that just gives soups a meaty flavor. 2 cans of diced tomatoes with juice in(because I hate stewed) I added 6 cups of beef broth, 2 bags of frozen veggies, 2 can of tomato sauces and 1 can of 8 oz tomato paste because I think I added a bit too much beef broth to tomato ratio (my family ended up liking it exactly like that so I will do that again) I also threw in a few beef bouillon cubes because I did not have onion mix and because I wanted a very beefy and tomato-ey flavor. For spices, I did add a bit more garlic powder because I think I went light on the minced garlic, sugar (doubled for the recipe), a dash of red pepper, a good bit of dried parsley( maybe a couple of TBS), some salt and black pepper to taste, and a TBS of Worcestershire sauce. I let it sit on high slow cook for 4 hours. At first I was a bit worried about the soup but over the time it really blossomed in a very hearty rich tasting soup. So I am sorry for completely changing the recipe, but I would not have had any idea where to start!

I used 1 lb of ground beef cooked with an onion and garlic.  I substituted diced tomatoes for stewed and I used one package (not one box) of dry onion soup mix.

This recipe is delicious! I doubled the recipe so I had leftovers. I used stew meat instead of groundbeef. And added some cubed potatoes. I did use Italian style stewed tomatoes & sauce. Also, instead of water I used beef broth. I definitely will be making this again!!

This was actually quite good for a fast recipe. I added 1/2 can of niblets corn and two frozen hash brown patties as I needed to use them up. It was a bit salty and if I made it again I would have cut back on the onion soup mix. If you need something hot and filling for lunch that's fast this will do the job.

This turned out exactly how I wanted it to. Instead of ground beef, I used stew beef. I think next time I am going to just cut up steak instead because I like lean meat. I also used beef stock instead of water and added garlic and red wine to meat. I could not find onion soup mix so I used beef stew mix instead. I added some celery too. Overall a great "base" recipe as others have said but the changes are easy so 5 stars still. I WILL be making this again.

I have made this so many times and it is always the BOMB!!  I love the fact that I can add things like potatoes and that I can use whatever tomatoes I have on hand and it's still great. We like to top it off with sour cream and cheddar cheese...or just plain and it still great!!  Warm cornbread or saltines take it over the top!!  Enjoy!!

This recipe was easy and the kids liked it so that says a lot!  I added garlic powder and frozen sweet onions to the meat while cooking.  Then I used beef broth instead of water.  I did not add the sugar.

I used this recipe to salvage a meatloaf that was waaayy too salty.
1. Sautéed 1/4 diced onion and minced garlic in olive oil. (Did not use the dry onion soup mix since the salty meatloaf had enough salt/seasoning.)
2. Added drained diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, sugar, diced potatoes, and 2 cups water.  After bringing to a boil, I added the crumbled meatloaf and simmered for 10 minutes. 
3. Added frozen vegetables, diced cabbage, and 1 more cup of water.  Simmered for another 10 minutes but it needed another 20 until the cabbage was soft.

Sorry that I did not follow the recipe but it was so adaptable and I was able to salvage the salty meatloaf and my family really enjoyed the soup.  Looking forward to the leftovers!

This was a great soup! I used 2 cans of low sodium beef broth instead of water, chopped up a small yellow onion to brown with 1 lb of ground beef and seasoned the beef with garlic powder and pepper. All the other ingredients I left the same except I did add a 1/2 cup of Marsala wine. It was a delicious, hearty soup! Will make again!

I've tried several vegetable beef soup recipes over the years, but this is by far my favorite!  It is super easy to make, and it tastes delicious.  It works well when doubled or tripled for a crowd.  I usually make it only for my husband and me, but I double it and freeze the leftovers for future use. I do not use the dry onion soup mix because nearly all soup mixes contain some form of MSG.  Instead, I simply use 1/4 cup of dried minced onion and onion powder combined (per batch).  I like to add 1/4 cup of pearl barley (per batch) during the last hour of cooking in the crock pot, but the recipe is just fine without the barley, too.

This soup is FANTASTIC!  It is SO easy and is now a quick "go to" meal for a cold weeknight in Chicago. I double the recipe so there is plenty to take in my little crock pot to work the next day for lunch. YUM! Thanks Martha!

This recipe is good. It's even better when you add your own personal touch. Like others, I used diced tomatoes & beef broth, then added Worcester sauce, garlic, & a small onion. I used flank steak instead of ground beef (I was cleaning out my freezer). I served corn bread on the side.

I doubled the recipe, but not the soup mix, and even still, it was definitely the predominate flavor. I added a can of corn, broth instead of water, some canned green beans, a handful of noodles, and some diced carrots, and a dash of worcestershire sauce. I also used diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  Next time, I'll not put in the soup mix and see how it goes and just play around with the basic recipe.

First I followed the recipe then taste tested it. Found it good but a little flat and not much beef flavor. Easy fixes. First I added a bouillon cube, then added a splash of worstershire and soy sauces. It gave it the body that I needed. I found this soup to be a tasty and easy not to mention inexpensive. Thanks for a great starter recipe. Andrea

This is one of our favorite family recipes. I do 1lb ground beef, 2 cans organic tomato sauce, 2 cans organic diced tomatoes, big bag of frozen veggies & a packet of soup mix. I've found that Italian dressing mix is a great substitute as well! This recipe serves my family of 5 and has leftovers.

Really enjoyed it. I would add more liquid and use a couple cups of beef broth, cook it about 10 minutes longer to get the frozen veggies nice and done (or use all canned with their juice) and try other commenters' suggestions to cook onion and fresh garlic with the meat and maybe add a teaspoon of worcestershire. Husband loves it just as it's written.

It was delicious! Worked out really well, but I used beef stock instead of water, used fresh vegetables instead of frozen ones (doing this takes longer for them to cook) such as celery carrots, peas, and potatoes.

I have made this twice now. Added potatoes both times and crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce or stewed tomatoes (not a fan of chunks of tomatoes in soup). First time used ground hamburger and dry onion soup mix, second time used beefy onion dry soup mix and leftover roast. Personally prefer the beefy onion as there was no need to add a bouillon cube or broth as others suggested. Great recipe, perfect for what I was looking for, as cans of soup have way too much sodium per serving and I was looking for a healthier alternative. Nothing ever seems to taste as good as grandma's for some reason but this was sure close!

Made this what I had on hand and agree with others the base is good with exception of using the beef broth in place of water.  I also used fresh vegetable instead of frozen (except peas) since we prefer those.  Will be making this again for sure!

The only reason I am not giving this recipe five stars is because husband thought it was "too tomatoey".  Next time I will leave out the tomato sauce.  I used beef broth instead of water, a 12 oz package of frozen soup vegetables and added extra potatoes.  Leftovers the next day were fabulous!

Taking the suggestions of you guys lol, I changed the ground beef to beef stew meat and cubed it small. Added digatini pasta, low sodium beef broth instead of water.... Browned the meat in chopped onion and garlic.... Added white wine AND Worcestershire sauce. I also added a little flour to thicken it just a little! I thought it was pretty good.... My mother who is an excellent cook..... Said it GREAT! Thanks to you guys and just finding my own way. Starting to cook more and I always combine the most common changes in the review with the original recipe.

This was good. We added extra of the frozen vegetables, but ended up having to put in a lot more water to make it 'soup'ish.

DELICIOUS and SSSOOOOO easy! I added one potato (plenty for six servings), substituted beef broth for water, and sauteed garlic and onion with the meat. Because I used onion, I omitted the onion soup mix. SSSOOO good. Low on weight watcher points also. Will DEFINATELY be making this again soon!!!

This was super easy. I used this as a base, and substituted water for beef broth. Added some pasta, and red potatoes. I also used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. Also added kidney beans.

Used 1 lb ground venison instead of beef and 1/2 beef broth 1/2 water. Very good. Will cut sugar in half next time. I cut up the stewed tomatoes before adding them. Made this for make-ahead freezer meals.

Here's my version, which woke up a man from a deep sleep it smelled so good!

1.25 pounds ground 85% Angus beef, browned in
2 tbs olive oil and 4 cloves garlic, chopped --
4 boxes of organic beef broth (32 oz. each)
3 boxes Green Giant 'Healthy Vision' frozen   veggies (carrots, green beans, zucchini in a rosemary butter sauce)
1 box chopped frozen spinach
1 small bag of frozen pearl onions
1 small can white kidney beans (rinsed)
1 small can diced tomatoes w/ green chilies
1 envelope onion soup mix
1 teaspoon honey
ground pepper, Kosher salt, dried parsley, Italian seasoning to taste
3 cups cooked penne, added after soup has simmered for an hour or so and add filtered water as need during simmering.

Took me 15 minutes to put together.  YUM! So easy and makes a nice big batch.  Serve with warm garlic bread.

This was a pretty decent recipe.  Like many of the recipes on allrecipes.com, usually it's a great place for me to start.  This recipe was just that.

I made some changes to suit my own tastes.  I omitted the tomato sauce and added 3 cloves of crushed garlic and more variety of vegetables such as diced rutabegas. 

A good soup.  Will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe however I too did a little bit of changing. To make it just a tad more healthy I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also substituted beef broth in place of the water and instead of 2 cups i put 4 cups of beef broth and 1 lb of ground turkey. Also browned the turkey with 1/2 a chopped onion as well. It was delicious. I'm eating it for lunch now!!

Wonderful! I`m a single male recovering from an illness, easy, nutritious, cost efficient meals are important, this is a real winner! I followed the suggestions to use beef broth in place of water and cooked the hamburger with garlic and onion. Think I will try adding wostershire as well. Now all I need is some jalapeno cornbread to go with it.

This soup was delicious!  I didn't have any red wine, so I used 1/4 cup of sherry.  My husband was still raving about the soup the next day.  I served it with biscuits - truly enjoyed it!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!  Definitely will make again.

Quick and yummy.  I browned the meat with onions and garlic, substituted beef broth for the water, and added 1/2 cup red wine, black beans, and pasta shells. Next time I will add more broth, to compensate for the pasta, as it ended up more stewy than soupy.  Good flavor though.

This turned out pretty good when in a pinch.  I did use diced tomatos with herbs instead of stewed.  I also added cooked garlic and onion sauted with the ground beef. I prefer homemade soup and broth due to salt and calorie intake, but this was really good when in a pinch for time.

Best vegetable soup I've ever ate! I did add some of my own character to the recipe, a pinch more of this, a pinch more of that, for example...but I was very pleased with the final result. My husband isn't a huge beef fan, so I cooked a sirloin roast in the crock pot and added that to the pot for the meat. It tasted great! I will be making this again.

Very little work and time for such great taste.  Versatile recipe too.  I used bite-sized pieces of stew beef, a 16oz bag of stew veggies, and diced tomatoes with onions, garlic and basil added, and it was yummy.

This was a great soup.  Added more ground beef and threw in garlic powder and a little wine and EVERYONE Loved it!
From start to finish this recipe takes all of 45 mins to prepare.
Will make again.

This was a good, easy soup.  I added a little Chili powder to give it extra flavor. I also doubled the hamburger, as suggested by someone else, and was pleased with the result.
