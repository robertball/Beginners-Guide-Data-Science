I used Granny Smith apples in this apple crisp recipe. I actually made this apple crisp in my cast iron skillet instead of a 9-inch square baking dish. While the oven was preheating, I melted a few tablespoons of butter in the skillet, then layered the apple mixture over the melted butter, then sprinkled the topping over the apple mixture. My apple crisp looked like something you'd see on the cover of a fancy magazine and the flavor took me back to when I was little and eating my Grandma's apple crisp. VERY good and for me, very soul-soothing dish.

No two ways about it - this was beyond excellent for a simple apple crisp, in spite of the fact that the topping had oatmeal in it, which I generally don't like (but Hubs does, which is why I made this in the first place).  Everything in this recipe was spot on; perfectly spiced and sweetened, an ideal ratio of topping to apples, and a topping so crunchy the person next to you can HEAR it when you chew!  This was quite a treat.

When working with fresh fruit you often find that the most simple of recipes really highlight the fruit's flavor.  This recipe does just that.  I did add two more ingredients and changed the method a bit but I tried to stay true to the recipe and I wasn't disappointed.  

I started by choosing six different types of baking apples.  A combination of apples gives you lots of flavor and textures.  I peeled, cored and chopped the apples and tossed them with the sugar and cinnamon.  Because many of the apples I chose have high water contents I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of dry minute tapioca.  Even if you don't care for tapioca you wouldn't even know it was in there.  It thickens up the apple's juices and ensures no soggy apple mess.  I also added some fresh ground nutmeg.  Only because I love nutmeg and apples.

For the crunch topping I changed the method.  I really enjoy a crunchy top that isn't sandy so I used softened butter rather than melted butter.  I started by mixing the dry ingredients and then used my hands to work the butter into it.  The end result is a beautiful pea shaped crumb topping.  Then I baked as directed.  

It really is a fantastic recipe and one I will make again and again.

My husband told me to toss all other apple crisp recipes - this was truly the best.  Minor modifications: added an extra teaspoon of both cinnamon and sugar to apples along with some lemon juice and 2TBS of flour.  To the topping only used 3/4 brown sugar, any more would have been too much and we like things sweet.  Cooking time took 50 minutes and since I kept the apples on the chunky side, I didn't have to worry about them being mushing.  Served with a drizzle of caramel sauce toped with whipped cream.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I added 1/4 teaspoon allspice and 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg to the apple mix before topping it with the oat mix. I also added 1 teaspoon vanilla to the oatmeal mix. Also, the topping really does stay crispy, unlike many apple crisp recipes. Just a quick tip, I mixed all of the dry ingredients in a food processor and that significantly reduced the mixing time. Put the oatmeal in last so that it does not get too chopped up. I also believe that the brown sugar could be reduced from 1 cup to 3/4 cup and the butter from 8 tablespoons to 6 tablespoons just to make it a little lighter. We got 8 servings out of this rather than 4. I highly recommend this recipe with or without my modifications! This is the tastiest apple crisp I've ever made!

This an excellent recipe. No frills, the taste of the apples comes thru nicely and there is a good balance of topping and fruit.  I did have to bake it for about an hour.  It may be my oven which is gas and I am not use to it yet.  If your fruit does not hold together as you would like, just add one tablespoon of cornstarch to the sugar and cinnamon before you mix it with the apples.  I also like nutmeg and a few grates of whole nutmeg in the apples and the crust adds to the flavor.

Excellent....my family and company loved it....I used Jona Gold, Crimson Crisp and Fuji apples picked from the local orchard. I also doubled the apples and kept the topping measurments the same. This loaded up a 9x13 pan. Served warm with vanilla bean ice cream. Just amazing...loved the crunch in the topping from the oats!

I followed the recipe 1st time and results were good.  2nd time added about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to topping.  Also added 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips to apples.  This just took the recipe to the next level.  I have made this for parties and holidays and everyone always compliments me  on how tasty it is.  This is my favorite apple crisp recipe.

Easy to make and delicious at the same time. I took another reviewer's suggestion to use a variety of apples (I went ahead and used 6 different kinds). The result was amazing! I swear it tasted like I used the 'perfect' apple. Left it in the over for longer than the recipe called for. You can smell it when it's about done: first the cinnamon smell comes out of the over, then it is followed by the apples. I left it in for 5-10 minutes after that for a more crispy crust. Everyone should try this!

This is absolutely delicious.  The first two times I made it with cold butter. Today the butter sat out for about 20 minutes before cutting it into the topping ingredients and it blended better and made a CRISPY crisp crust.  That's the only change I'd made. The measured ingredients were the same as the recipe.

As for the fruit, we have trees full of big baking pears that are ready now so I've been using them instead of apples.  Sometimes I throw in a handful of blueberries with the pears. Either way, my guests gobble it up.

Tonight's crisp was simply pears with cinnamon and a little sugar sprinkled over them, and the best crispy crust so far.  A lovely caramel developed around the fruit pieces.  My parents asked me make another one immediately for them to take home.

Can't wait to try this crisp recipe with apples, peaches, berries and whatever fruit is in season.  It is excellent.

Thanks for the recipe.  It's exactly what I was looking for.

I used granny smith apples and made 1 1/2 times the recipe to fill a 9x13" pan. The apple crisp was good, but I will make a few changes next time. The baking time was too long for my oven and the apples turned to mush. Next time i'll cut the baking time to 25-35 minutes. It also was a tad too sweet for my taste, so next time I'll use less sugar in both the topping and on the apples. And finally, I felt the topping could have used a touch of salt.

I've made a lot of apple crisps and this may have been the best one.  Super easy and I like that there isn't tons of sugar mixed in with the fruit.  Planning to make again for my husband's birthday!

Mine didn't turn out as yummy as the picture looked.  It was kind of dry and fell apart too easily.  The apples didn't cook enough in the 40 minutes and it didn't bind together.

This is very good, especially warm at breakfast time!  I will try using a 9'X13" pan next time to cook the apples more evenly and spread out the topping.  I used rice flour to make it gluten free - delicious!  Thank you!

Great Recipe! My husband and I used 6 apples as it states in the recipe, we bought pretty good sized apples and actually ended up doubling the recipe and putting it in a 12 inch pan instead of a 9 inch pan. It really turned out great though! We also used rice flour instead of all purpose flour & gluten free oats because my husband is Celiac in order to make the recipe gluten free! The recipe was quick, extremely easy and turned out awesome! Will probably be taking this to Thanksgiving dinner with the family!

Since I'm not a big fan of cooked apples, I never keep recipes for apple crisp around...so of course he wants an apple crisp for his birthday dessert tonight. I made a few minor adjustments based on reading EVERY SINGLE REVIEW. I used 3 Granny Smith, 2 Honeycrisps and a Fuji. All peeled. I added 1.5 TBSP of instant tapioca and a squirt of fresh lemon juice. I let it sit at room temp for about an hour and it made just the right around of juice. I broke my food processor so I did the topping by hand. I just chunked up my cold butter and went at it with my hands. A bit messy but very effective. I used an oval Le Creuset baking dish. It was the perfect sized dish. My topping was piled high (I knew it would sink a tad.) I had to cook mine about 15-20 minutes longer which was making me nervous and I shut the oven off and let it set in there for another 10 min. I served with a homemade caramel sauce and homemade whipped cream. My family said it was fantastic and the man loved it. He said it was rich, the apples were cooked perfectly and his mom even said it looked so rustic and delicious that it should've been on a magazine cover. I didn't partake until a few minutes ago, after everyone else is asleep. It's delightful. The caramel drizzle and homemade cream elevate it to the next level. The crunchiness of the topping is heaven against the warm apples. I might consider adding some chopped pecans next time but we'll see...This is my new go-to recipe for apple crisp!

I tried this recipe because of how little sugar was mixed in with the apples.  I was looking for a recipe that highlighted the apple taste without being too sweet.  The apple part came out fine-used granny smith's.  However the topping was way too sweet for our tastes although it did have a nice crunchy texture.  I will try again but next time usimg less brown sugar in the topping.

Wonderful! Very easy to make and tasted great. Other apple crisp recipes I've made had other stuff in the filling (water, apple juice, more sugar, etc.) so I was a bit uncertain about the total simplicity of this one, but it was great. I didn't find the filling dry or anything (though more liquidy would have been fine too). I did think 6 apples was kind of a lot for the pan size called for, but I used Gala apples which are on the big side for apples, so that could be the reason. You could stretch this to more servings too; four servings would be very generous portions. I got six servings out of my pan and we still thought the portions were quite a good size. I happened to have a bottle of caramel ice cream topping in the fridge, so I drizzled that on each serving and it was so good!

This was a super easy recipe. Preparing the apples is what takes the longest. I had a ton of apples, so I made two batches, one for home and one to bring to work. The first batch I used cold butter and it was impossible to get the mixture mixed and crumbly. Some parts of it were a nice crispy topping and other parts were just a powdery layer. It needs to be room temp and slightly softened. I used the softer butter for my second batch and it turned out great, crispy and crunchy all the way across.

CRISP! So glad I went with this recipe, four thumbs ways up! (My roommate) and I both went for seconds, this was the perfect apple crisp and it could not have been easier to make. Perfect ratio of apple/topping. Thanks so much for sharing!

First night taste was a five, but i had to cook for an extra 20 minutes to get the top golden and bubbling.  Leftover oat topping sogs up a bit.  I wouldn't make again because you need a a whole stick of butter for 4 servings!

Excellent recipe.  Before making it, I read the reviews and liked the suggestion of using different apples.  I used Honey Crisp and Granny Smith and the combination of these two is very good.  I don't use cinnamon very often but do have pumpkin pie spice so I used it instead with good results.  The apples I used were big so when they were peeled and sliced, I decided to use a larger baking dish than the 9 inch suggested.  I'm glad I did!  I made a little extra topping and baked in a 9 x 13 dish.  After sampling it hot out of the oven, I know this dessert won't last long.  It's a keeper.

This recipe is good, but the topping is missing something; it is somewhat dry despite all the liquid that bakes out of the apples.  Also, this is not a crisp, it is a crumble.  A crisp has the same streusel ingredients, without the oats.

This was so simple, yet so delicious. I was naughty and drizzled another 1/4 cup melted butter over the top. So rich! I'm not a huge fan of "foofoo food", and the apples are the star of this crisp.

We made this last night for the first time and it was fabulous!  I followed the recipe as written (I even used cinnamon from a spice shop - yum!) and it was perfect.  I do have a few suggestions that might help someone.  First, I used Granny Smith apples.  I think a sweeter apple would have made this too sweet for me.  My apples were also on the small side (2 to 3 inch diameter) so I will probably toss a few more in there the next time.  Second, I always have such a hard time with cutting in the butter, so I finally gave up last night and put the mixture in my blender/food processor and pulsed it a few times.  The crumb was so crispy and tender and consistent - best topping I've ever made.  Finally, when the timer went off, I was tempted to leave it in the oven a little longer because the top didn't look really brown, but I could see the filling bubbling on the sides, so I took it out of the oven anyhow. So glad I did!  It kept the topping from getting that really hard, crunchy texture and kept it lighter and crispier.  Great recipe and I will definitely be making this one over and over!

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly. I baked mine in a 8x8 baking pan, perfect size. I used green apples freshly picked from my moms tree the tart flavor mixed with the cinnamon and brown sugar is so good. Mine baked for exactly 40 minutes. Easy to make and goes perfect with vanilla ice cream.

Simple and delicious!  

Topping is crunchy, excellent flavor. I used Cripps pink(pink lady) apples. I cut down some sugar and drizzled a bit of agave syrup on top.

The apples were ten minutes off the tree.  Found I was mistaken about having cinnamon on hand so used the same amount of pumpkin pie spice.  That worked rather nicely.  Also layered Heath English toffee bits between the apples and topping.

Delicious - my favorite apple crisp recipe.  I am lazy and don't peel my apples and it comes out wonderfully.  Also, this definitely takes longer than the recommended cooking time.  For those people who say the apples are dry and hard, you may not be using "cooking" apples (pick apples that are recommended for apple pies) and/or cooking long enough.  Test the apples with a toothpick or knife to see if they are soft enough for your taste.  I don't like crisp apples in my apple crisp (just the topping!), so don't assume the recipe is done within the 40-minute cooking time.  I cooked for at least an hour.  I also often double this recipe, because my family gobbles it up.

A fantastic recipe! I tried it the first time as posted and then like some of you, it's fun to play with it and make it your own. 
I added a 1/8 tsp of Nutmeg to the Cinnamon for the apples. (apples cut a little thick, not too thin, not too thick)
I added a 1/8 tsp of Nutmeg & 1/8 tsp of Cloves, 1 cup of chopped Walnuts to the topping.
Holy Apple Crisp!  Doubling the recipe next time!
Thanks for sharing Realnakedchef!

Great tasting apple crisp! I left 1/2 inch of water at the bottom of the dish so when i mixed the apples, sugar and cinnamon it would make a great sauce. It worked really well! I agree that the smell is so deliciously intoxicating...i wish i could bottle it ;)

This recipe was wonderful.  I thought I had oats so forged ahead making it and discovered I had none!  I used Uncle Bob's 5 Grain Rolled Hot Cereal instead and it turned out awesome!  Delicious flavor with the apples (I used granny smith) and cinnamon.  Definitely will make again.  Thanks!

I found it difficult to mix the toppings and the end result was just okay. If I make it again I'll try a variety of apples and maybe bake for a bit longer.

This is my fourth time making this!  It was a hit at the Sunday church lunch.  The only difference I do is add chopped pecans to the crumb topping and I drizzle caramel on top.

Hubby loved it, as is - but we have a limited variety of apples in Costa Rica so I felt something was needed to make up for the lack of flavor in the apples.  Made 2 different versions: doubled the cinnamon for both.  In one version added a handful of raisins and mixed in a portion of the topping into the apples.  In the second version I added vanilla to the apples and chopped walnuts to the topping, and again mixed some of the topping in with the apples. Hubby called these 2 versions 'OUTSTANDING'.

I tried this recipe because it looked easy and tasty. You will not be disappointed. It was delicious and everyone in my family loved it! I did not have old fashioned oats but the one minute oats worked just fine. I did not have a square 9 inch pan but my square 8 inch pan worked just as good. Thanks for this great no-fail recipe!

In the past, I have always made my Apple Crisp from my own memories and it has always been super. Wanted to try this one as it uses brown sugar in the crumb topping. All in all delicious. It was a nice change.

Just popped it in the oven and all of it smelled so incredible!!!
*Edit* 
I made this both with instant oatmeal (I was eager to try the recipe!) And with regular oats as called for. Both worked great, but the oats are preferred. Just know that in a pinch, instant oatmeal can be used. The picture is the crisp made with oats. ??

Made exactly as written with the addition of a little nutmeg and a couple of tablespoons of melted butter on the bottom of the pan, per other reviewers recommendations.  This is not your average apple crisp!  My husband and I were in heaven eating this hot out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I am making again tomorrow to take to a potluck where my desserts are always legendary.  This is a great recipe, thanks for sharing it.

It was SO good!  And so easy to make!  I changed the flour to almond flour and the butter to olive oil for dietary reasons and it still turned out amazing!  The change to olive oil could also make it vegan, if anyone is interested.  This is my family's Apple Crumble from now on!  I just made it for Thanksgiving (Canada) and can't wait to make it again.  Thanks chef!  P.S.  I used MacIntosh apples ... my grandmother always used Macs for baking - soft and moist.

Used Jonamac apples, were small, so put in approx. 6 cups of apples. Made it in 9" black frying pan coated with 1 tb. butter. Excellent! (Black frying pan, took out a bit earlier as it will keep cooking in the pan, about 35 minutes)

Very easy and quite good. I found the topping to be a little dry and next time I will cut back on dry ingredients just a bit or cut in more butter. I will definitely be making it again during the apple picking season.

I made a 9x13 inch pan of this by adding in two more large apples and doubling the crust part.  It turned out really well, lasted less than 24 hours and I'll be doing it again soon :)

This is an awesome recipe... reminiscent of my mother's all those years ago. I love that there is plenty of crisp topping to go with the apples, unlike many recipes. And if you leave it uncovered the first 12 hours after baking, it'll stay nice and crisp for the duration.

Hi, I tried making this today - flavor was great but the crumble turned out powdery and a little loose. Any thoughts? I baked it for a little less than 40 minutes.

Excellent!  I now use this for my apple pie recipe.  Just added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 2 Tbsp tapioca.  Best crumb topping recipe by far!!  Look no further.

Great flavor.  We made it using some apples from our tree.  I added walnuts chopped then just crumbled on top before placing in the oven.

The topping is awesome, but the filling needs tweaking. There needs to be a thickening agent like flour or cornstarch otherwise it's way to watery.

I have made this dessert many times and it is the best. The topping is crunchy and the apples aren't too sweet.  The topping is also great on blueberries and peaches.  I make the crisp exactly as written, usually with honey crisp apples.

I have been using this recipe for years. It was the one our lunch ladies used  in our school. I add a teaspoon of apple pie spice and  grate a little fresh nutmeg on it, also. The flavor is amazing.

Made this over the weekend with fresh Macintosh apples straight from the orchard.  It did NOT last long...and was awesome both straight from the oven and cool.  Because my husband is a celiac, I substituted a gluten free flour mix for the flour...and it was perfect. The only change I might make in the future is to add some nutmeg to the sugar and cinnamon. Super simple...if it comes out of the oven a little runny...just let it sit a couple minutes. It will firm up.

Very good. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it was slightly too sweet for my taste. Just slightly. I like to eat it with ice cream so I'd prefer a bit tangy over sweet. This is probably just my personal preference as my boyfriend is chowing it down as we speak, telling me how amazing it is! Next time I want to try reducing the brown sugar to 1/2 cup or so and adding cranberries for a little more tartness... yummm!!!

Had lots of apples & wanted an easy apple crisp without having to get ingredients from the store. Found this recipe. Filled my 9x13 pan full of sliced apples. Made the crisp topping & baked. Excellent!! It turned out great. Baked longer because of all the apples. Family loved it! Served with whipped cream. Very yummy. Will make again.

I love this recipe, it was very easy. The whole family loved it too. I used more cinnamon and it was great. I will definitely use this recipe again. The only 2 changes I would do is cut the apples into smaller chunks (I used BIG chunks) and I would like more of the crisp topping- it was delicious!

This is so easy to make and delicious. I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it. I didn't have 6 apples so I used strawberries, blueberries and the one Honeycrisp apple that I had. I will make it again. This recipe is a keeper!

Added more to the oat topping because we like a lot of crispy topping. I also kept the skin on the apples.

I lost my mom's apple crisp recipe, and was looking for something similar. This was perfect! I used a little less flour and a little more cinnamon, and mixed the apples with some of the topping instead of with white sugar - it turned out exactly how I remember apple crisp as a kid. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This came out very good but, in my opinion, it could have had half the amount of topping for the amount of apples (I used 9 medium-large apples).  Also, I would increase the amount of cinnamon and add a little cornstarch to the apple mixture, because there was some juice at the bottom of the pan after it baked. I would definitely make this again with my alterations.

This recipe is great just the way it is listed.  Add some pecans to the topping mixture for added nut flavor.  Don't forget the ice cream and carmel for a truly rich dessert.

This is the easiest, most delicious apple crisp recipe. Only part of this recipe I can complain about is the part stating to use 6 apples. I like measurements. Depending on apple size this measurement could get your recipe into recipe. Just play with your own amount of apples you would like to use for this recipe. Also, I find omitting the sugar all together is ok, especially if you are using orchard fresh apples or apples from your own tress.

I thought I had oats on hand but all I had were steel cut oats - and after a google search, I discovered that the two are not exchangeable. Sigh. So I replaced the oats with equal part walnuts and it worked!!! Absolutely fabulous. So if you're looking to lower the carb count and add some crunch, try nuts! This is also 100 times better when warm. While delicious cold, it just doesn't hold a candle to how good this is when warmed up.

This is my favorite "crisp" recipe! I have used many kinds of fruit with the toppings. So easy to whip together and great served with some vanilla ice cream!

I added 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cup and used brown sugar in the apples with a tbsp. of flour. I used soft butter mixed into the oatmeal mix.  Turned out just like most other old fashioned crisps.

I had 3 apples sitting around that nobody was eating & then I stumbled across this recipe so I made it! I cut the recipe in 1/2 & made it without any changes. It was delicious (especially while it was warm)!!

I made it according to the directions and it came out a little dry on the top and not a lot of oats mixed in. It may have been my fault though so I will be fair as the family enjoyed it warm with ice cream and I didn't hear too many complaints. Will attempt to make it again soon and see what happens.

Amazing!  I cooked it about 10 minutes longer because the apples were still hard when I tested with a toothpick.  It was super easy and came out delicious!  I will definitely make this again!

Wonderful! I used granny smith apples; I cut the apples the day before and added some lemon juice to keep them fresh. Otherwise I kept the recipe the same. The crisp topping is perfect and all goes quite well with ice cream :)

I followed this as is, except added more cinnamon to the apples and topping.  I thought that the topping was way too sweet, and there was too much of it.  If I make it again, I will reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and reduce the flour to 1/2 cup.

This is good, but I messed up initially by forgetting to add in the flour, so I made the topping again (after putting the first topping on) and included flour the second time around.  Still turned out good though.

This was a BIG hit!  I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 casserole dish which worked perfectly (with leftovers) to feed 6 kids under 8 and 4 adults.  I used a mix of apples-golden delicious, a granny smith (we don't like our pies, etc tart but I had one on hand), and some red ones-don't remember what they're called but they're close to golden delicious in flavor.  I also added some nutmeg to the apples per someone else's review.  The top was totally crisp even when warming up leftovers.  Excellent recipe and I highly recommend!  The oats aren't overpowering so even people who aren't fans of oats would likely like them in this.

I made this last week and it was delicious. If I did it again, I would probably add a little bit more of the oat/sugar mixture, as that was my favorite part. i used granny smith apples and served it with vanilla ice cream and it was a big hit.

Scrumptious! I made this for breakfast at my in-laws and it was a huge hit! I didn't have my regular recipe so decided to try this one. I'm glad I did. I am throwing out all of my other apple crisp recipes.It would be tasty with ice cream, but since it was breakfast, I had it with some plain yogurt...with both helpings.

Wow, this was great!!!!! It's the heart and soul of holiday desserts, made with simple ingredients. After I mixed the topping together, I tasted it and found myself eating it by the spoonfuls. It is soooooo good!! Anyway, I added 2 tsp of vanilla extract (not that it needed it) to punch up the flavor. Once baked, the topping was sweet and crunchy and the apples were tender and sweet. Hot out the oven and topped with vanilla ice cream, just yummyliciousness!!!

So easy, yet so good!  I made this for a dinner party a month ago and it was a hit.  Making it again for Thanksgiving.  The topping and 6 large granny smiths make enough for a 9x13.  Can be served with or without cream / whipped cream / ice cream --- it's that good!

Great! I added a little more cinnamon than what was called for. When I make again I will probably increase the oats mixture so it fully covers the top but still awesome!

This was great. Light and crispy, not chewy like the others I have made. I used sour apples and next time I will use sweeter ones, but this recipie was easy and great tasting!

I like the ease of this recipe but I added more spices like nutmeg, cloves, salt and the cinnamon. I also added can of cherry pie filling. When I make this next for the holidays I will add walnuts and raisins. But will leave out the cherry pie filling.

Very good and very easy!  I used 6 large apples...it filled the pan very full.  I placed a cookie sheet under the pan as it baked and am I glad I did because it bubbled over in a most delicious way.  Also, instead of tossing the apples with cinnamon, I subbed apple pie spice.

I have this same recipe from my Mother-in-Law.  Great and easy.  I usually don't peel the apples; use even more apples; sometimes add chopped toasted pecans to the topping and like to add chopped up candied ginger to the apples.  If you do add the ginger, it helps to spray your knife with cooking spray and to slightly freeze the ginger before you try to chop it.

Incredible and simple. Not too sweet like some of the other recipes I've tried. I will however make more of the topping or use less apples next time, because I thought the ratio of apples to topping was not completely to my taste.

Just made this.  So simple and so good.  Hubby loved it too which is always a bonus.  I used 3 types of apples; Jonagold, Granny Smith and Fuji and they worked out perfectly.

My husband and I loved it. I followed the recipe with 3 exceptions. 1) Used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup in the topping, but I packed the half cup. 2) I baked it in a cast iron pan and it turned out great. 3) When I added the melted butter to the oat topping, it turned into a ball of oatmeal paste. There was no way I would have been able to “crumble” it on top of the apples. I didn’t want to add more oats, so instead I added slivered almonds I had on hand and I kept adding the almonds until I had a crumbly topping. And my apple crisp was delicious. So the oat topping is very forgiving. We ate almost all of it in one day. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

I used the food processor to speed up the preparation time for the topping since I was short on time. There wasn’t as much texture as if I hadn’t done it that way, but still was excellent. Also prebaked a crust for it as well.

Tasty!  I followed the recipe, only I cooked it for 55 minutes.  I like the topping to have a crispness to it, and I needed it to cook it longer to get it crisp.  Great with ice cream, caramel sauce, and whipped cream.

Super easy and delicious. I used gala apples, they’re already soft so they cook easy but also they’re super cheap.  I followed another reviewer and melted butter in my pan as the oven heated. I didn’t follow the measurements, I added what looked like 3/4 flour (maybe a little less), extra brown sugar, a little more than 3/4 oats and tons of cinnamon. I used my fingers to mix the topping with the butter, much much easier than fighting with a fork. I drizzled maple syrup on the top of the apples (which I had tossed in a little extra sugar and cinnamon) before putting the crumb topping on. Cooked for 40 minutes and was perfect. Will use again!

I make apple crisp fairly often but have never found the ideal recipe. This one, using some of the reviewers' suggestions, is as close to perfect as I could achieve. I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan. I made the topping first, softening rather than melting the butter and added 1 tsp nutmeg also. By incorporating the dry ingredients in with my hands it was evenly mixed. When baked, the topping was buttery, crunchy and almost toffee-like, something which I've never achieved! Doubling the recipe gave me more topping than I needed, but I plan to try a banana crisp and will use my ¨leftovers¨. For the filling I used 12 cups of apples (how vague is 6 apples??) which was nicely generous for the 9 x 13. I added a few tablespoons of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg for extra flavor. I have never reviewed a recipe before, but I am so excited about my results that I had to share my joy!

I thought that this was an excellent base recipe. However I made several changes. The apples I used were a sweeter variation- Gala, Honey Crisp, and Breburn so I only used half the sugar that was called for, for both the apples and the topping. I don't like things too sweet. I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to both the apples and topping and a little extra cinnamon to the apples. 
I also added 1/2 cup of quick oats to the topping mixture. 

My boyfriend and I loved the recipe it turned out exactly how I expected it and wanted it to even with the changes I made due to reading the reviews.  

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Excellent apple crumble. I added lemon juice to the apples to keep them from browning, plus I added a few grinds of nutmeg and 1/2tsp of ginger to the crumble mix. My sil asked for this for his birthday instead of cake and it all went. Delicious on a chilly Sunday!

I used a sweeter apple so reduced sugar somewhat.... can’t give exact measurements because I don’t precisely measure ! It was most delicious, and in fact, I have another in the oven as I write!

Mmmm! I substituted 1/4 c Brown Sugar Splenda in place of half of the brown sugar, and used about 1/4 c. brown sugar instead of the remaining 1/2 c. of brown sugar called for in the recipe.  It is so yummy and my pre-diabetic husband can have some too.

I used a combination of apples; granny smith, gala and macintosh.  I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon, instead of a 1/2 tsp., in apple mixture and 1/4 cup of Crainins.  It was delicious!!

I made mine in a large deep dish pie plate. I thought at first there was too much topping but I kept piling it on.  It was delicious.  We were having company and one person is gluten free.  I used gluten free flour mix and it turn out just fine.

Cut back half of the cinnamon and use 2 types of flour. Whole wheat and white flour 50/50.  With a pinch of salt to the crumble and a pinch of salt to the apples.
In addition add 2.5-5 ml of lemon juice to the apples, brings out the flavor nicely.

This was exactly the kind of recipe I was looking for.  The topping was crunchy (which I like) and the apples are sweet without being overly sweet. I will definitely make this again. I brought it to a Halloween potluck lunch at work and hopefully it will be a hit!

OMG this is fawesome! Super easy to make with basic ingredients already on hand. I added 7 Gala apples instead of 6 cuz they were pretty small. I used salted butter which was a fantastic addition to counteract all that sugar and made it a more balanced dessert instead of a straight sugarbomb. The 40 mins cook time was perfect. The apples were slightly crisp, not at all mushy. The oat mix crumble on top browns and adds a great crunchy texture element.

Yes, I  used turbinado sugar instead of white and brown. I didn't have all purpose flour so I used coconut flour instead. So it's the oven and smells wonderful!

I doubled the recipe because I enjoy thicker servings. It was wonderfully juicy, and I think that is because the topping was thick and slowed down dehydration.  (I see one of the reviewers said theirs was dry.)

This is my 'go to' Apple Crisp recipe.  I make it any time I want my house to smell wonderful and enjoy a great desert.  I sometimes add a sprinkle of nutmeg to the apples.  Don't be afraid to use your hands to make the topping!  You're going to press it down anyway, and it's too time consuming to use a few knives to make it into a crumble.   I've not noticed any difference in the outcome especially since it's pressed into the apples.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

I ended up using 6 mystery apples (my dad got them from co-workers) and a honey crisp. Subbed some of the cinnamon for a bit of Pumpkin Pie spice, ground ginger, and some cardamom. Was very good, served with vanilla ice cream.

Loved every bite.   Used the left over with oatmeal and toast in the am which was to die for.   I did make a praline pecan crumble though added a touch of vanilla to the oatmeal in the am and milk.   Of course the dessert part went with vanilla bean ice cream, and my husband works for Godiva so he brought home real salted caramel to drizzle over it. I don't typically eat sweets which Is funny since my name is vcandy.   But if you're going to do apple crisp' this recipe was simple and delicious. We picked way too many apple's from the orchard this year. Put two different kinds in this recipe. Now just talking about it. .....I'm gonna make more.   Enjoy!

Really good. I used Jonagold apples, medium to large in size, equaling about 5 to 6 cups sliced. This recipe is good as written.

This review is mostly for the topping. I've made it with apple pie and peach/apple pie. The problem is that the crumble, to me, has too much sugar and flour. I froze the butter, grated it into the recipe, folded it in with a fork, then re-chilled it before putting on top of the pie. Just not enough butter. I've had crumbles that are super crunchy and buttery but this wasn't it. It was only moderately crispy and there was a lot of extra flour and sugar left over (made it sort of grainy). Maybe another half stick of butter? It was certainly pretty enough (see pic) but not what I was expecting. I will try another recipe next time. Thank you anyway!

I tossed the apples with cinnamon only; omitting the sugar. I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.

Followed the recipe , family members enjoyed but  I feel it needed a little more favour and  crunch , if I make it again I would add about a cup of chopped walnuts.

I've making a very similar recipe for years.  Make a double batch of the topping to freeze so it's ready to use anytime you have apples!

It was delicious but I made some changes.  I added brown sugar to the apples instead  of white sugar.  I also  added 1/2 Tbsp of lemon juice and 3 Tbsp of Amaretto to the apple mixture.

Everyone said it was the best dessert ever and they want it the next time they come over.  I served it with a high quality caramel ice cream.

The recipe is enough for 6 people.  I increased it by 50% and have lots of leftovers.

I can only give this a four because I didn't make this as it was written.  I added one apple, and as soon as I saw how little sugar two tablespoons was against that pile of apples, I doubled it. Other than that, I followed the recipe.  This was delicious and perfect for dessert on a late summer evening.

Came out perfect!!! I added 1/2 teaspoon of allspice to mine. It was fantastic. Super easy to prepare and can also make individual servings as well.

Great way to use up apples that are past their prime!  I might add a little water or lemon juice with the apples next time.

Turned out very dry at the end. And 40 mins was not enough, sugar was not boiling even after 1 hour plus. Total disaster.

3 stars for ease and taste, minus 2 stars because it was dry and  the recipe needs some tweaking (reduce sugar, add more flavor).

Easy and delicious apple crisp! I added lemon juice, pinch of salt and a dash of nutmeg. Didn’t have any ice cream so I served it warm in a bowl with a little bit of milk. I use the apples I had (red delicious) and it was great. May try using Granny Smith next time.

This recipe was a great inspiration.  I used the ingredients as a base line to throw together my own.  I only was cutting up 2 Pazzaz apples.  The combination of the oats with the brown sugar and butter is always a win-win in my book.

Doubled the recipe though didn't use all of the topping and needed to increase the baking time by 10 minutes. Even after a big Easter dinner this was a crowd favourite for ages 7 to 70 and so easy to make. Used Courtland apples which didn't go mushy.

Everyone loved this! I followed the recipe as written and shown in the video. The only change was I had 5 Granny Smith apples instead of 6 so I added one other type of apple to it.  At 40 minutes in my oven it was not “bubbling” on the sides so I left it in longer, checking every 5 minutes to insure no burning on top and removed once I saw bubbling on sides. Served with vanilla ice cream, yum!

This was so good!! I filled a 9x13" pan with apples and made a batch and a half of topping to cover the fruit. I added lemon juice to the apples and used a little less sugar & butter in the topping - it was still awesome!! Will absolutely make again.

I upped the oats, brown sugar, butter and flour to add a bit more stuffing.  I used 4 apples.  

In short...same recipe...a little more sugar and butter...

Worked awesome!

Very good but not quite right?  It was an easy recipe to follow, produced exactly what I was expecting.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream, then finished off the leftovers right from the fridge.  Everyone liked it, and taste-wise it hit most of the notes, but was lacking something, and to me seems a bit flat or bland.  It had a very strong cinnamon flavor, so I don't think that was missing.  Maybe cloves or ginger?  We enjoyed this enough for me to try it again, maybe with some more spices!

This is a great recipe!  HOWEVER, as someone who doesn’t eat processed foods, drink soda, or add sugar to tea or coffee,  it was WAY too sweet for my taste.  I even reduced the brown sugar to 3/4c as suggested by another reviewer, and it was still way too sweet for me.  Everything else was perfect, however - just a matter of taste.  EDIT:  I finally found the right proportions for us:  3 apples, ~7 strawberries, 1/3 c butter, 1 tbsp white sugar, 1/4-1/3 c Brown sugar, same as recipe for everything else.  Still sweet, but not overpowering, and healthier.

Amazing. Perfect blend of sour and sweet. I used brown sugar in the crust, it was great, but I would use a little less then the recipe calls for.

I made this and it was the best i've had in a long time. The apples i used were getting a bit soft, but that is ok because they added more sweetness to the dish.  I also used the salad slicer machine to give a thin slices of apples and saved 1 apple for making chunks. Will be making this a lot and will be sharing it on my facebook page i.e celticpearlrecipies

I followed the recipe as written and it was wonderful!  I used some apples my neighbor gave me but wasn’t sure if they would work so I mixed two Granny Smith apples in with them.  My company said it was amazing!

I followed the instructions exactly, minus one apple because I only had 5. I used Granny Smith apples and it was absolutely perfect! So, so delicious!

We absolutely love it!! I did change it a little by adding more apples and I recommend adding the butter a 1/4 cup at a time because I never get the crumbly texture it seems to be too moist and all sticks together.  Either way, it is totally delicious!!!!

Make sure to cut your apples into small chucks. If the pieces are too big they take longer to cook. Its the worst when you go to eat it and realize that the apples aren't cooked all the way through. Best to use your hands when cutting the butter into the crumble mix to make sure its mixed thoroughly. Cooked for 45 mins.

This is my second time making this and it was a special request from my son to make again for Thanksgiving. I always use a little more cinnamon than what the recipes calls for because I love it, but otherwise made it as written.  I used a deep pie dish this time and it looks gorgeous.

Very good flavors in the apples and topping. I used Jonagold apples that ended up a bit over cooked so specificying an apple type that’s firmer would be good.

I used Stevia instead of the white sugar.  I will probably use less brown sugar next time, a little too sweet for me. It was a bit watery, but I hear you can use water and brown sugar heated in a pan to make caramel. I might try that with the left-over water.

I did put in 3/4 cup of brown sugar, a little less than called for, and I run the oats through the salad shooter to make the pieces smaller.

This is the most amazing apple crisp I have ever madeI used for 4 granny Smith and 4 spartan . The amount of sugar stayed the same. The spice in this recipe is perfect. It allows the flavours of the apples to come out without it being too sweet. Now in this case I made two and in the second one I did drizzle some caramel sauce on it after for the kids who like more sweet. Don’t get me wrong it is plenty sweet with the topping which by the way is just amazing no changes had to be made.

It smells so good, it's still in the oven cooking, so I haven't tried it yet. I had a little bit of trouble mixing the butter into the oat mixture. I think I might soften it next time. I will be making this again!

used MacIntosh apples - 7 small ones - should have used 9 as the topping was plentiful. Used coconut flour in the topping and added walnuts prior to covering the apples with topping. Omitted all the white sugar and used half the brown sugar called for and this was plenty sweet enough!  delicious.

It was too sweet and too mushy, but still edible.  Next time I will cut the apples thicker, 1/2" or more. I plan to add less brown sugar and more oats.

Delicious!  I used Newtown Pippen apples. I also only had steel cut oats, but turned out great. I thought there was a bit too much topping.

This is an easy recipe. You can take immense liberties and you'll still have a great dessert. I used prepackaged, sweetened, instant oatmeal because I didn't have the regular oats. I also used Smart Balance in place of butter. The result was great.

Made it. I added nutmeg and a little water. Taste is amazing. I broiled it for 4 minutes on high after the 40 min cooking time to add some crunch.

This was pretty good.  The first time I made it it came out really well.  The second time I must not have fully incorporated the butter into the topping mix because it was dry and didn't form the same crumbly topping. Make sure you cut the butter into the topping thoroughly.

This had good flavor, but it was very dry. To be fair, I used only 1 cup of sugar in the topping instead of 1 1/2 cups. Also, the writer must have used some pretty small apples, because when I cut up 9 apples, it didn't fit in a 9 x 9 baking dish.  I had to use a 9 x 12. I'd enjoy some suggestions as to how to make this more moist.

I pretty much followed the recipe, I just added more ingredients then what the recipe is calling for. It came out super good and juicy. My whole house loved it. Will definitely make it again. 

Ps don’t forget the scoop of vanilla ice cream for each serving. It adds to the goodness

This is a simple and delicious apple crisp recipe. I made it as instructed in the recipe and it is perfect! My favorite apple combo is half Honeycrisp and half Grannysmith.  Enjoy!

I love apple crisp this one is delicious I've used this recipe multiple times and this time I decided to rub the butter into the dry ingredients for the crumble instead of forks/a potato masher and that made it much easier.

4th time I've made this dessert and each time it's a huge hit!
It's simple and quick. Plan to make and freeze some, come closer to the holidays, to give as gifts.

Great flavor!  The topping didn’t want to seem to crisp up much, but still great.  More topping then we needed so we made a second batch of apples.

I LOVED THIS. I am 8 months pregnant and I will be making this a few times in the next couple weeks. The only thing I changed was that I added some extra cinnamon to the apples because I love cinnamon. It was so quick to make and came out perfect. Not dry and not watery, just perfect.

Really simple - REALLY delicious. I only made one change, adding corn starch to the apples to keep them from getting too soggy.  I'll be making many more times ;)

Always a favorite in our house anytime of year! We don't use white sugar in our house but just using  brown sugar is suffice and it's so good with vanilla ice cream and or whipped cream.

I made it with gluten-free flour (Bob's Red Mill) and it was very simple and yummy. The topping made me think of oatmeal cookies. I ate this for breakfast....and dessert.......it took a lot of self-control not to eat it all at once actually.

Easy Peasy with premade pie shell. We like to crossover with Chef John's Carmel Apple pie recipe, just in case you don't think 680 cals/slice is enough. If you want to try it this is how I do it; spread all purpose flour thinly over the bottom of pie crust and drizzle carmel sauce over the flour, then proceed to make pie as instructed above then drizzle carmel sauce over the oatmeal topping and bake as per instructions. Bon appetit!

My granddaughters and I made this for dessert tonight.  It was easy and fun! They even learned how to double the recipe to accommodate their large family.
Delicious!! Crispy, cinnamon, and sweet apples...the kids took to the oatmeal granola we used "vanilla and almonds".

I didn't have to add anything to the recipe. There was a perfect ratio from topping to apples and it was absolutely delicious.  I would definitely make it again for a nice dessert in the afternoon with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This recipe came out really well. I  double a dozen apples, added chai spice blend some vanilla extract and crushed Cinnamon Oat Squares cereal from Giant Food. I didn't double the other ingredients but I did add about a quarter more. It was just sweet enough but not overly sweet.

Taste: very good
Changes: both my husband and I cannot have too much sugar, so I used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar, it was perfect for us
Problems: It came out rather dry; in fact, after 40 min cooking,  some of the flour on the top and some of the oatmeal were uncooked. The apples were a bit under cooked. Here is what I did: I mixed it all up, and gave it 20 more minutes. 
Will do again: definitely. I will add some water to see if that helps with moisture. also, I may try to mix the butter really fine, to see if it will help in the cooking of the crust.

I’ve been making crisps, crumbles and cobblers for many many years, and have to say this is the absolutely best crisp, period, bar none, no contest.  I just made it while visiting family and everyone has asked for this recipe. Thanks for a real keeper!

This is a pretty good recipe for the baking newbies like me.  I have to say, The second time I made it I only mixed two tablespoons of brown sugar and half of the butter and it came out great (and significantly less calories).  Like many said, it is on the drier side, which doesn't bother me, but I'm sure for some it would cost the recipe a few stars.

Great easy recipe that tastes & smells wonderful!   A couple of personal notes after baking it, having followed the recipe EXACTLY:  I thought the topping mixture was a bit dry as I cut in the butter, but I resisted the urge to add more butter or liquid to it.  I'm glad I resisted because it turned out lovely - crispy & crunchy.  Just the way we like it!   I thought the baked crisp itself might be dry, as well, because it was not very bubbly after baking, but it was fine.  A lot of other people's complaints can be answered in the kind of apples they used.  If you use apples that don't have much juice, you may have to add a little water or apple juice before putting on the crumbs.  Also, the sweetness of the apples can affect the amount of sugar you toss them in.  I have had a favorite Apple Crisp recipe that I have used for 40+ years that doesn't have brown sugar or rolled oats.  I thought that was the only recipe I would ever use again.  I was wrong.  This recipe is a good one - really good.  The only change I will make next time is to add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the apples, along with the cinnamon.  But, that is not a criticism of this recipe - just my own personal taste.

This is an easy peasy recipe but too sweet for my teeth and palette.  I would cut both sugars by a 1/3.  I even added a dash of salt into the mix right at the end.  Overall, it suited my craving for apple crisp.

It turned out great! The only thing I’ll do differently next time is to lower the amount of brown sugar; was a bit too sweet for my taste but my mother loved it. She must have a bigger sweet tooth than I thought. ;-)

Way, way, way too much topping for 6 apples.  When I make again I will double the apples, but still maybe half the sugar.  It was plenty sweet to me.  I didn't like as written but gave me ideas for concocting my own, so thank you.

To start I have to admit I was distracted while preparing the recipe so I added the brown sugar to the apples instead of the topping!  Not wanting to start all over again, I used a slightly sweetened granola with almonds instead of the oats, added a 1/3 of a cup  of brown sugar and hoped for,the best!  
The dish made it to the counter before the "vultures " descended and claimed it was the most amazing apple crisp they'd ever eaten.

I had leftover apples from apple picking and needed a few recipes to use them up. This has been one of the most successful ones. I added more cinnamon, white sugar and a pinch of nutmeg directly to the apples and followed the recipe. It came out amazing. The morning after I baked it, there was less than half left. 
Will definitely make again.

My husband wanted apple crisp with “a ton of topping” so I set out to find a recipe that fit the bill. This was it! I used honey crisp apples and it only took about 6. I made an extra half batch of the topping and cooked it for 50 minutes based on other reviews. It was fantastic. The only thing I’d change is using less brown sugar in the topping because we both like things a little less sweet, but I’d think most folks would want it just like the recipe states.

I loved this! I only used a little more than 1/2 a cup of brown sugar because other reviews said that it was too sweet, I baked it for 45 minutes and it turned out perfect. I highly recommend this to anyone, I have never made apple crisp before and this recipe made it a piece of cake!

This was delicious. I added 1-2 tbsp of cornstarch to the apple mixture and put some nutmeg in with the topping. I also used gluten free flour and gluten free oats.

Very sweet for me but hubby loved it.  I made it with unpeeled  Gala apples.  I didn't have size pan called for so I pulled out my trusty iron braiser  pan and it turned out very well.  Sprayed the pan with butter and I will make this again but with peeled apples and less brown sugar.

This came out great!  Given the comments about it being dry I added thin slices of butter on top of the crumble about 1/2 way through the cooking time and it crisped up beautifully.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious and easy!  Used granny Smith apples for a little more of a tart flavor.

I made this and it was incredibly good.  I used Harralson apples from my friends' tree.  Crisp, tart and wonderful!
I added a sprinkling of nutmeg to the topping...

Easy and so good!

I used a casserole dish, and added a little lemon juice to the apples, for browning. Also I used margarine instead of butter. It always comes out delicious. Perfect comfort food. :)

Too sweet! I cut back on the sugar in the topping but it was still too sweet. Next time I would only use 1/4 C brown sugar. Other than that, liked the crunchy oats and the yummy cinnamon!

The recipe doesn’t tell you what to do with the flour.
When I realized this it already  had the topping on and I had to gingerly mix it in which messed up the look, but it still tasted good.
Please revise the instructions.

I added a little maple syrup to the apples and also some sliced pears and cranberries.    I added crushed almonds to the crust.  I added more cinnamon to both the crust and topping.

This is the best apple crisp I've ever made. I did read other reviews before I made it and followed a few suggestions. I only used 1/2c brown suger ,  added 1/4 t nutmeg and baked it 50 minutes. Fantastic!

Love this recipe!  Made some substitutions to make it vegan (swapped out the butter for a vegan butter and sugars to vegan sugars) otherwise followed it as directed.
I’ve made it a couple times now (whenever I have apples to use up ) and its my go to recipe for apple crisp now

I ended up using 1tsp of cinnamon and 3 tbsps of sugar to toss the apples in. Otherwise I left the rest the same. It turned out great!!

Turned out amazing! I used the apples from my crab apple tree. (They are exceptionally sour, so I just used a bit more sugar in the apples) The top is crispy and delicious, and the apples are soft and sweet.

The best Apple Crisp EVER!! I was worried the the apples would turn out mushy but they didn't!! But be careful not to make your apple slices too small or they will become mushy. Also do t worry if you don't have enough oats because I was half a cup short and it still tasted delicious.

I used some Fuji apples that were a bit mealy when we got them. I added some lemon juice for tartness and threw in a few fresh figs from my fig tree. I used my food processor dough attachment to make the crumble. It was a hit at a last minute luncheon for a friend traveling through. This will be my go to crisp recipe from now on. Oh, and I used self rising flour (only flour I had) and it added a little saltiness to the crisp which was nice when served with ice cream.

My son made it  exactly as written.  I made it with homemade canned apples.  I liked his  better with its' nice crisp topping, but I had no problem with my version. Mine produced a nice soft, chewy crust.  Both were still delicious as leftovers the next day.  Depending on which apples I had on hand, I would make it either way.  And I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is excellent as is. I made this gluten free substituting Bob's Red Mill 1:1 Flour & wheat free oats.  For variety I mixed fruit- 4 apples, 2 cups frozen wild blueberries & 1 cup strawberries. It was a big hit.

I cooked it much longer than the recipe called for - the crisp was very dry and not getting "golden brown." I also think the crust to apple ratio was pretty high.

Delicious as is but if you want the filling a little juicier toss the apples with 2 T of water and 2 T of lemon juice.
Thank you for sharing realnakedchef.

Had to improvise with a couple of ingredients.. I substituted pre-packaged granola for oats and had to use lard instead of butter. It turned out amazing  - even the kids loved it! I used all the apples wrinkling in the bottom of the fruit drawer too!

I have many family and friends with celiacs and so can't eat anything with wheat or wheat flour in it and so I made this recipe with oat bran in place of the flour and it was really good. I also usaed apple pie filling for half of the apples because I was short on apples and that really added to the flavor.

Awesome! I made it exactly according to the directions, it was delicious. A huge hit with my dinner guests. Very easy to make, I used Fuji apples. It was easier to mix the cold butter in using my hands, though. I will for sure make this again!

This is a wonderful apple crisp! I followed some of the other commenters suggestions, increasing the sugar and cinnamon by 1tsp a piece and adding 2T of flour, I also added the juice of half a lemon to the apple mix since I used some sweeter apples, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla to the crumble to round out the flavors. I also followed the suggestion to use room temp butter to get a crisper topping and accompanied it with a warm caramel sauce on the side. This recipe is a great base for any semi-experienced baker to really use their personal baking preferences to make it their own!

Delicious! Very easy to veganise. I used red delicous apples and added some pecans into the topping. I am extremely happy with how it turned out.

I followed the recommendation to use a cast iron ,  great call! When the crisp came out of the oven, I was delighted with the ready made presentation the skillet offers.

So delicious!  I used honeycrisp apples, put the oat mixture into the food processor with some brandied walnuts.  Cold butter is definitely a necessity in making apple crisp.  Before the oven I topped it all off with drizzled caramel sauce and butterscotch chips too, because I found them in the cupboard.  OMGosh, it is to die for.

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this recipe. I recently just started getting interested in baking, and he and I had a sweet tooth tonight but didn't have any ingredients to make anything. Are  so we thought. there were a few changes I made, some out of necessity some due to not having 2 of the ingredients called for, some because I felt they would help add to the dish rather then take away due to not having all the ingredients. First thing different was I took coconut oil while it was still solid and greased the casserole dish (I just hate the experience of having things stick to pans, plus it just helps with keeping everything moist). Next thing was I took a single fresh mandarin and juiced it and added the juice to the apple sugar cinnamon mix, also added only about 2 tsp of sugar and added real maple syrup, just eyeballed this. Then instead of rolled oats we only had some maple almond pecan granola.we also didn't have any all purpose flour so I used some finely milled white rice flour.Worried about the batch being to dry or burning or something on account of there not being the rolled oats I added about 2 tsp of h2I to the topping. Also I used half the butter cold and mixed it in per directions but then melted the rest and also melted a little more cocnut oil and mixed this all in with the topping. Covered with foil popped her in the oven for about 45 minutes until bubbly. I decided immediately that popping it in the freezer to let it cool would help to solidify everyt

This is a great recipe because it is so basic and can take variations.  I made the flour a mix of Amaranth, Teff and Quinoa flours.  (Quinoa is good in such mixes because it binds them better) I used only two tablespoons of unsalted butter.   The husband has to do low sodium and no processed sugar.   I used two or three little packages of NuNaturals stuvia in the cut apples instead of sugar.  I used a little more in the flour oat mix.  I sprinkled a lot of cinnamon in the apples and in the flour oat mix.  After it baked for a long time, I spooned about 1/2 cup of apple juice over the top cooked flour oat mix.  After a little more baking, I did it some more, letting the cooked apples underneath get wet, too.  The husband said it tasted fantastic, and he is very fussy not liking his no sodium and no sugar life.  Feel free to adapt this recipe, too, because it is simple basic genius.

My wife made this for me.  She used four apples , didn't have six. Used almond flour instead of white.
I prefer my topping a little less dry, but having said that this was without doubt the best apple crisp I've ever eaten.

This dish was a hit with everyone.  I changed things up a little by doubling the amount of cinnamon and eliminating the white sugar.  Next time I may try adding some nutmeg.

We thought it was terrific! I doubled the crumble part of the recipe, and kept the apple and cinnamon/sugar mix  at the original amounts. Because "too much crumble" is fiction. I thought it turned out really well like this. So very easy to make.

This was FANTASTIC! But if you really want to kick it into another gear, add 3-4 bananas, about 1/4-1/2 cup of peanut butter chips, some vanilla and when your done, drizzle caramel over the top! And of course serve with vanilla ice cream :D

I made it exactly as written and it turned out great. I did let it cook a little longer than the recipe stated to get the topping a little bit browner.  It was a little runny when it came out of the oven so I let it sit for about an hour and it thickened up perfectly. My family loved it so much that I added it to my permanent recipe box which is saying a lot!

OMG - this is the best ever.  I don't understand the reviewer who said it is too dry.  I made it per the recipe with the only addition of a pinch of nutmeg and it was amazing.  I recently made another apple crisp recipe on this website and it was good too, but nothing compared to this.  Thank you to whoever shared this one!

This is delicious!  I had a couple pecks of apples that my family picked at the apple orchard, and I was looking for recipes to use some of my apples.  I used a variety of  different apples from the orchard, including sweet and tart apples.  I made it in a baking dish, but after reading another review, I think I'll try it in my iron skillet next time.  I served it warm with ice cream.  My house smelled heavenly for a couple of days!  The flavor was out of this world!  This apple crisp will be a Fall tradition in our home!

The recipe was really easy to follow and came out just like the recipe says. It's great with Vanilla ice cream on top when it's hot right out of the oven. I will make this again. I suggest using Granny Smith apples. They have the best texture and hold their texture the best.

Added nutmeg, ginger, and all spice with the cinnamon and pinch of cloves and 1 cup of pecans chopped to the topping.  I also doubled the whole recipe to fill 9 x 13 pan.  Had to added extra stick of butter to keep topping moist.

This is the best apple crisp I've had. The only change I made was using 2 sticks of butter instead of just one. Truly makes a huge difference to make that crunchy golden topping! We make this all the time! Suggestion - if making for a small group cut your recipe in half, all except for the topping. Use what you need on an 8x8 dish and freeze the rest! I always make an 8x8 size but full amount of topping! Great to have on hand! ENJOY!!

I'm not the main cook of the household and found this recipe quick and easy. The result is amazing. I made some of the following changes...I sliced each of my apple wedges into thirds to make them thinner. Due to the extra volume of apples I doubled the sugar and cinnamon for coating the apples. I baked it at the recommended temp on bottom rack for 40 mins. And then top rack for an additional 5 mins.

I doubled this recipe and it was FANTASTIC!!! I used apples we picked this past weekend from a local farm - 4 different varieties and followed the recipe almost to a T! Only additions I made were tossing 2teaspoons of melted butter in with the apples, and 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips. This is FOR SURE a keeper and I will always use this recipe for apple crisp from now on!

I took the advice of some other and cooked it in a 9 x 13 baking dish. The apples cooked perfectly; however, you need to increase the amount of topping to accommodate the extra space.  Other than that it was delicious!

Good but too much sugar. I followed someone else's suggestion by cutting down the butter content (to 6 tbsp) and sugar content (to 1/2 cup + a little more). My oven didn't brown the top in 40 min at 350, so I had to crank it up to 400 for 10 extra minutes to brown it nicely. Perhaps it's just my oven. But overall good base recipe.

This was a big hit with anyone that tried it. It was simple and delicious. Everyone asked for the recipe or asked me to make it again.  I put a few dollops of butter on top of the apples before topping and I also doubled the topping recipe. I like the crumble to be extra thick and it seemed like everyone else did too. It has only been a week and I just made it again.  Love it!

My daughters said it was the best!! I drizzled the apples with honey and the 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and used just 1/2 cup of brown sugar with our freshly picked apples and  1/4 cup of white flour with 1/2 cup of sprouted wheat flour instead of all white flour.  Delicious!

Love this one! I always add a dash of nutmeg to the apple mixture when I make this recipe. It's a strong spice, so a dash is really all you need!

This is a fantastic and easy apple crisp! I did make some changes, one was a necessity! I only had 3 large apple's, but I also had 2 pear's on hand. I was afraid that the pear's might make it too watery so I did what another reviewer suggested and added some cornstarch to the sugar and cinnamon mixture to coat the apple's. The only other thing I did was to add a little nutmeg and to chop up some walnut's in the topping. Fantastic recipe, thank you!

Terrific recipe!  Used a mix of Cortland and Macintosh apples for a smooth/chunky texture, and they are sweet enough that you can eliminate the 2Tbsp white sugar. Also reduced the brown sugar from 1 cup to 2/3 cup and it was plenty sweet. Replaced some of the cinnamon with cardamom for a little variety.  Definitely will make this again.

I'm a  complete novice when it comes to baking, but I love apples.
I made  this exactly as the recipe stated.The results were  fabulous.
Apples were firm  but tender...not soggy or mushy.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  The oatmeal in the topping gave it the perfect texture. My wife was quite impressed. I will make it again today and will not change a thing. Thank you for sharing a great recipe.

We were having company who are gluten free, replaced regular flowers with gluten free flour and it was delicious.  I let the apples sit in the sugar and cinnamon to generate some liquid to compensate for the GF flour - worked!!!
Use Mac's from our own yard - perfect apple for this recipe.  Will probably make it for Thanksgiving!!!!

Made this as written, and it was the perfect topping for our 'crab-apples', which are more tart than sweet.  I will cook the apples just a bit before putting the topping on next time, but other than than, I won't change anything!  (Except the amount I make, which I'll have to double!)

I've made this twice and both times were AWESOME! I'm now going to add blueberries to the apples for a little change of pace. Try this with peaches, soooo delicious!

This was so delicious! For the spices, I ended up using a pumpkin spice blend (ground cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice), which fit in nicely with the overall taste. Also, if you're not into peeling apples (I think it's a pain in the ), there's nothing wrong with keeping the peel on and just using an apple corer/slicer to prep the apples. Oh, and I also squeezed a little lemon juice in there.

We ate it without any accompanying dessert topping (ice cream, whipped cream, etc.), and it stood up on its own. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe said, and it was AMAZING!  The apples I used were a little mushy/crumbly before I started cooking with them.  I think more crisp apples would have made it better.  But for what I was working with, SO GOOD!

I baked it for 40 minutes as directed, but it still looked a little dry on top. I laid a few pads of butter over the sandy areas and popped it back in for 5 more minutes. It came out superb! The apples were soft, but not mushy, the topping was delightfully textured without being gritty, and the whole thing was very sweet, but not too much. I highly recommend this warmed up with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on the side.

It was very good. I didn't have any brown sugar, so I just used white sugar. The crisp still turned out great. I also added about 1/2 cup of crumbled graham crackers since they were kicking around. It was a good addition.

I checked other recipes on the internet--some submitted by famous chefs.  One recipe called for maple syrup (who wants to taste maple?)   another called for lemon juice or orange juice (the tartness of the apples is all you need).  If you want the real thing, this one is it!  A perfect blend of sweet and tart, creamy and crunchy.  Grandma would have approved!  I served it warm with ice cream.  My fussy son-in-law LOVED it.  Don't change a thing.  Remember to use a tart apples  like granny smith.

It tasted sweeter than a usual Apple crisp, I would use less sugar next time (white and brown both) otherwise it was excellent, and super easy to make.

Perfect recipe for when I have too many apples hanging around. I replaced the butter with coconut oil (which worked perfectly!).  I wanted to make it vegan. I did, however, sub some sugar with honey (which may or may not be vegan depending on your opinion on local beekeepers). I normally was a huge supporter of butter in baking, but this came out as one of my favorite apple crumbles ever made! I don't taste the coconut oil at all. It's too delicious! (I also added lemon juice to my apples which gave the older apples I had some needed tartness! Mmm.) Thank you for this recipe!

I have baked this mouth watering dessert four times now using this recipe and it has come out perfect every time.  I have experimented a bit after the first time (when I followed the recipe exactly). I used green apples instead of red gala ones, added cranberries to the topping, added a dash of lemon and salt to the apples.... and it still tastes yum! Thank for the recipe!

This is basically the same recipe I have been using for 30 years from the "New Fannie Farmer" cookbook from 1972.  It is sweet but not too sweet so you taste the apples and not just sugar.  Good balance of topping to apples.  Add waters to the apples or not, depending on the variety of apples used.  I like the extra juice, so I always add it.

I precooked my apples to enough to soften them but not mush them out.  Texture was good but not great.  I am looking for great  apple pie texture.   I'm going to use baking apples next time to see if I can get the perfect texture.    Yes I have fought using them for some reason and yes they should work better.  But I had Gala so I used them.
I use whole wheat flour whenever possible so I used it here and  because the topping was darker I had to watch the baking closer at the end.   I also mixed the cold butter into the dry ingredients with my fingers as suggested by another reviewer .  It is somehow more satisfying but I wouldn't do it if I was in a hurry or cranky.     The art and science behind these changes have made me a believer in....wait for it....   using Cook's Illustrated  approach to cooking and thinking about my past failures.  Who knew using my brain actually works. LOL

This was amazing. Gooey then crispy, in all the right places. I substituted 1/2 almond meal + 1/2  gluten-free all-purpose baking flour for the white flour and it was delicious. I also sprinkled pecan pieces on the top, mashing them in for a nice crunchy top layer--pure bonus.  So thankful for delicious desserts like this one that are a bit redeeming with the apples and nuts!
FYI if you want to save time and healthy value, just leave the peal on, I actually prefer it! And don't forget the vanilla ice cream (or whipped cream). Enjoy!

Yasssss honey! This is an excellent recipe. If you are looking for a delicious, tasty, warrrrrm fall treat? Look no further! Ok, so here's how I modified it a wee bit...I used mostly Granny Smith Apples and a Sm gala apple (so it has the tart & sweet thing going on). In the apple coating mixture I also added a pinch of nutmeg, a splash of rum (rum extract or even bourbon would work too) just a chance that I took??
In the topping, I added pecans (finely chopped from my food processor) it really gave the topping an extra crunch and great texture. I agree w/ the other reviews: I only used 3/4 brown sugar. I was a bit nervous it'd be too sweet (I don't like mouth-numbing sweets lol) it was perfect. Oh and lastly, the recipe called for 40 min cooking time. I only cooked for 35 min as I have a new, gas oven. Its very efficient so I can normally shave off a few minutes here and there. I hope this helps!
Happy Baking!

This recipe was the closest to the one my mother used, but she made it so often I'm sure she didn't use a written one. I lightened the flavor a little by going 3/4 c brown and 1/4 c white sugar in the topping.   A key is thoroughly incorporating the cold butter into the dry ingredients.  I start with a pastry cutter and then with a gloved hand work the mixture making sure that all the dry ingredients are used up.  If you don't do a good job you'll have a pool of butter at the bottom of your pan.  
This recipe says serves 4, but it is so rich you can easily double that.  Don't forget heavy cream over the top!

This one of my favorite desserts. I use the food processor for the topping & it grinds down the oatmeal. I still think its good. I never use a specific apple. I used any apple I have on hand because I always have too much given to me.

no changes, just an addition of cut up caramel candies over the apples before the topping, as another suggested.  next time i will have to make a double batch!

I was feeling lazy so didn't want too much of a "production", but that fresh bag of Macintosh apples were calling my name. This recipe fit the bill. I tried to reduce the topping, and ended up reducing the oats too much so the topping came out more floury then it should (obviously my fault, not counting that in the rating).  Since Macintosh are quite sweet apples I didn't add any sugar to the filling. Good call. I enjoyed this crisp.

i used all brown sugar n used twice as much to make a 9x13 pyrex.  we couldnt decide if we liked it better:  

hot out of the oven, or 
warmed slightly for breakfast or 
cold the next day....

we did use extra sugar n extra cinn n made an extra batch of the oatmeal mix cuz i love lots of topping n we like super sweet desserts.  

am making it again, right now,  as i type this !!

Super awesome recipe. Nice crispy crust. Tip: I didn't have plain oats on hand so I just used an Instant Maple and Brown Sugar Oatmeal packet (~2 pkg per recipe). Since the packet already has cinnamon and brown sugar, I omitted the cinnamon from the topping and reduced the brown sugar by a touch.

This was excellent. I love that the recipe made so much topping- just the way I like it! The only thing I did differently was cut up 10 caramels and put in with the apples. To die for.

I made this recipe exactly as given and it turned out great. I will definitely make it again. The apples are tasty and the topping is crispy. The recipe does not state that the brown sugar should be packed so I didn't pack it down. It is still quite sweet so I might reduce the sugar a bit next time I make it. This is an easy, wonderful recipe.

I made this for the first time today, and it was delicious!

I followed the suggestion of others and used 6 varieties of apples, which gave a really full and satisfying apple flavour to the dish.  I added some chopped walnuts which really added to the flavour and crunch. Next time I'll try lightly toasting them before adding to the crisp mixture, or just sprinkling them on top.

I tried to fit everything into a 9x9" pan, but it was too small, but the 9x13" was perfect. The cook time seemed to be a bit on the low side. All said, I think that this was in the oven for a little over an hour, but I didn't have any time constraints, so it wasn't an issue.

Overall, fabulous recipe that i'll be making again soon. Thank you realnakedchef for sharing :)

This was one of the easiest and delicious desserts I've ever made! I used empire & macintosh apples (more than 6). I used my deep dish pie plate only because it's pretty. Even though I used more apples I didn't alter the topping ingredients - it was enough.  I did add more cinnamon & brown sugar with the apples but that's only a preference thing.   My son thought I bought it.

Came out very tasty, but I did make some changes to make it a little more figure friendly.  Used about half the amount of butter.  Also used 3/4 cup brown sugar, and it was still pretty sweet.  I think next time I'll try 1/2 cup.  Used gala apples since they were on sale.  Used a 11x7 pan.  Will definitely make it again.

This crisp was wonderful, best one I have ever made.  The only thing I did different was after spreading the apples in the baking dish I poured 1/4 cup water over them. Because my apples were real tart, for the sugar and cinnamon mixture I used 2 heaping TBSP Sugar and a little more cinnamon.
For the baking dish, I used a 12 x 8 1/2 and cooked it for exactly 40 minutes.  The crisp came out perfect!
This recipe will be my go to one when I want to make an Easy Apple Crisp.  My husband even commented saying how good it was!

The best, for sure! I chunked five apples and sliced one thin for different textures. I mixed some of the topping in with the apples (for extra goo factor) and put the rest on top. Following recommendations, I only used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of a whole cup. Plenty sweet and delicious to me!

Delicious! I leaned more towards this recipe because it called for brown sugar instead of white. Only alteration I made was adding 1/8 tsp of nutmeg & ground cloves to just the apples. The family loved it!

Made this recipe as written.  I used freshly picked Cortland apples.  It turned out super yummy! The crisp was even crispier when we reheated the leftovers in the oven the next day.  Great recipe as is, but easily modifiable based on your tastes.

SO good!  And so easy!  Every person who ate this asked for the recipe!  I used whole wheat flour, and you could not tell the difference.  Have also used white sugar and it was fine too.   I melted the butter and then just mixed I into the dry ingredients for the topping and that worked fine and was easy.   Might try a bit less sugar next time but this recipe rocks.   Twice a good with vanilla ice cream.

Teen here,  just made this in cooking class at school, it was great, so yummy! With the said cook time, apples weren't too mushy, they were just right. The crumble on top was so delicious, and not too crumbly or too hard. Doesn't quite stay in perfect slices when dished out, but that shouldn't matter because it still tastes divine. I loved it! 10/10

Made this crisp recipe without any changes. Be careful if you're dieting because you can't stay away from this dessert. Used Granny Smith apples. Next time I will make this in ramekins instead of a pan of it because I like the edges. DH had ice cream and whipped cream on top. I just ate it right out of the pan. OMG I love apple season!

We all LOVED this recipe! It was disappeared so quickly that I made it again for home but this time doubled it ;) made one that was enjoyed equally for work. The only adjustment I made was adding a bit more sugar (brown & white) and that's only because I have a sweet tooth :) can't go wrong with this, super easy & delicious!

This was good, but I thought it was a little too sweet. I don't know if cutting back on the sugar will help, but I'll try that the next time. Especially good with a scoop of vanilla frozen custard.

This is delicious! I used dark brown sugar and threw some walnuts in my food processor then added those to the topping. I did use a bit more sugar and cinnamon than called for but, a great, simple recipe to use.

Took it to a tailgate party and it was a big hit.  Received a few requests for the recipe.  I used Paula Red apples and cut into smaller size pieces and doubled the recipe and still baked it in a 9 x 13 pan still using the 40 minutes.  Easy to prepare, ingredients that most people have in the cupboards, and tastes wonderful,  what more could you want?

Added a tiny bit of lemon juice and butter to the apples to moisten them. 
The CRISP part of this recipe, however is the best I've ever had. TIP: I substitute 1/4 c of the flour with little known TEFF FLOUR. Bobs Red Mill sells it. It adds a bit of a course/crunchy texture to it that has my friends and family going gaga over the crisp topping.

Thank you very much for the recipe.  This was delicious.  My brother-in-law had three servings!  I used Honey Crisp apples and one Gala apple.  I added a little nutmeg because my sister likes it that way, and extra cinnamon because I like it that way.  Baking time was an hour.  My husband,  a master of understatement who limits high praise to "Good," said this recipe was "Excellent."

I made this exactly as posted. It tasted wonderful! I had to cook it for an extra 15 minutes for the apples to be soft. The only thing that I was missing was a scoop of vanilla ice-cream!

Nice, crunchy topping. I sprinkled my apple slices with lemon juice and tapioca, since they were really juicy ginger golds. Doubled the recipe and had a full 9x13 pan of crisp.

BF said this is the best dessert I've ever made. It's deliciously simple and so tasty. I did add a tsp of vanilla to the crumble topping and about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans. Add some caramel drizzle and homemade vanilla ice cream - perfection.

I made this recipe with my Food and Nutrition class. My students really enjoyed it. The recipe was easy to follow and tastes great.  We had to turn up the baking temperature (375) to make sure it cooked in the allotted time.

I made this the first time according to directions. For me was way to sweet.  So next time I made this I cut back on the brown sugar in the crisp.  I used 3/4ths of a cup instead of a cup.  Tasted way better and was able to tell more of the flavors.  The original was all sugar but with cutting back the brown sugar.  I was able to taste the oats, cinnamon (which I also increased a 1/2 teaspoon in the apples and in the crisp.  I love cinnamon) And could also taste the apples that time.  Hope this review helps those that dont like things quite so sweet.

Simple variation  i used on this recipe   . Used a few small wide mouth canning jars  and pressed the oat mixture  into the bottom  then put the apples on top and bake.  Or cover the oats with homeade crabapple butter and bake. When its done and cooled place the lid in the jars and send them off for school lunches . The kids love having home made goodies in thier lunch

This was much too sweet even with reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup, and the topping about double what I like.

Excellent! The only thing I would change when making it again (which I will, vety tasty) is cut back on the brown sugar. It was a little heavy on the sugar....desguised the natural flavor of the apples. Still a wonderful basic recipe!

I used Johnathon apples and sprinkled a little extra white sugar and cinnamon over the apples and dotted them with butter before covering them with the oat topping. I melted the butter and crumbled it over the apples. It was the bomb!

I love this recipe!  I added half cinnamon & half nutmeg to the apples!  Just as good as Apple pie!

For years I've been looking for an apple crisp recipe that actually gets crisp on top.  This is it!  The oats really make the difference.  Even my husband commented on the topping being crunchy.  Next time I'll cut down on the sugar a little because my apples were quite sweet.  Otherwise it's perfect and so delicious warm.

Great recipe.  I was feeling a little lazy, so I melted the butter instead of cutting it into the dry ingredients and it worked perfectly.

I made one for my Mom's group, but it got eaten before I could get there the next day!  I made another and it got gobbled up!  Taste a little like anapple cobbler.
