I read the description and decided this would be a drink best sipped slowly and while lying down!  Good drink use quality products for a quality drink!

Perfect hurricane! Just like we remember from the beach, only stronger :)
We didn't want to buy special hurricane glasses, so one-half recipe fit nicely in a standard wine glass. I'm a 150 lb woman, and after 2 wine glasses (1 recipe) I was silly drunk! I had a third wine glass, which caused a mild hangover the next morning, so I told my husband to stop me at 2 wine glasses next time. 
This recipe has a fantastic kick:alcohol-taste ratio, and for the second batch I enjoyed adding another 1/2 ounce each of the flavored liqueurs to make it even smoother. 
ATTENTION anyone who hates even the slightest taste of alcohol: this recipe is not for you!  Stick to the recipes which have a higher juice:liquor ratio, and leave this recipe for the grown-ups! ;)

I left out the gin and 151....these are really strong without them and I don't like gin, so I didn't use it.  I  used Captain Morgan for the rum, Malibu for the coconut rum and Titos Vodka. I also added an oz of Passion Fruit Juice per drink. It adds alittle more tropical flavor and is yummy.  I garnished each drink with a slice of a star fruit and a marachino cherry:) soooo good!

You weren't kidding when you said if you think you can walk away after two, you just think you can. I'm embarassed to admit I had to be practically carried to the bedroom after these wild hurricanes. The flavor of the drink was very good, just stick to one though! :)

I've tried it many times.  Enjoy it every time.  I always make doubles and drink two of them.  The 151 rum at the end gives it a great ending.  But after two doubles your day is over.

Pretty good drink but didn't use the 151 rum so it was a little sweet with a whole ounce of grenadine.  If I made this again without the 151 rum I would cut back on the grenadine.

Amazing drink! Very tropical & fruity!
I ommitted the gin and the 151 proof rum (1 because I can't stand the taste of gin & 2. I didn't have either of them), and it came out amazingly well! 
I HATE the taste of alchohol so I added a little extra orange juice (about 1-1.5 ounce) and pineapple juice (.05-1 ounce).
