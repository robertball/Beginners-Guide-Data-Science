This turned out well, but as other reviewers have stated, it does make a lot. I used mini pepperoni, grape tomatoes, and subbed mozzarella for the Parmesan cheese.

Made it as written, except that I used heart shaped pasta for Valentine's Day. We enjoyed this - but it does make a lot. Would be great for a pot luck get together. I took a bowl to my friend to share, as it was a bit much for just the four of us.

I would use less carrots--they were over-powering.
Otherwise, this was good and well-received.

I didn't use the olives (personal preference I suppose).  But this was great!

This was a great recipe - however what is the serving size?  The nutritional information use to be an option when I printed but no longer.
