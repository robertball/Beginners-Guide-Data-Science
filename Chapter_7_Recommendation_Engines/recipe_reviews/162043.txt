Made this (absent the bacon) for a Good Friday dinner. No one in my family (5 adults) was tremendously impressed. Made it again (again absent bacon) the following weekend using Tuna steak and Cannellini beans and -- while not especially embraced -- was better received. In the VERY unlikely event I ever attempt this recipe again (regardless of the fish/seafood I attempt) I think I'll attempt adding some rice and some salt to the general recipe and sprinkling either grated Parmesan and/or Cheddar Cheese over each individual serving. My family (4 adults me) did not care for this recipe.

This recipe surprised me in its greatness. My boyfirned and I cooked this up and we did add more garlic to what was suggested if any because we eat garlic in just about everything. We also added some italian spices. We would make this again.

This was a very easy fast and delicious recipe. I substituted trout for salmon and used fish broth instead of chicken broth. The bacon spinach and garbanzo beans were strong enough to balance out the fishiness. A nice light summer dinner.

This would be a great soup if the salmon didn't over cook so easily. I would add the salmon in the last 5 minutes of cooking to prevent this. I also would like to see the salmon in smaller flakes. Using precooked salmon and flaking it into the cooked soup would be a better option I believe. It is tasty.

Very easy to make and the ingredients are not usually found in one dish. Needed something more though. I would add garlic and parsley and more spinach. I used canned salmon and will never use that again-go fresh. Mushrooms would work too. Will try again as I love salmon in anything and this was healthy.
