I made this recipe for Christmas this year. I took them to my in laws and got good reviews from them. They all seemed to like it and two asked for the recipe. I added garlic and a little red pepper to the cream cheese. Also, if you get the cream cheese very hard in the refrigerator it will wrap around the olives without being messy. Just make sure you drain and dry olives first.

I'll be honest and say that I am a really lazy cook!!! I took all the ingredients and mixed them together, put it all in a bowl and used it for a chip or cracker dip. It went over VERY well! I put the room temp cream cheese, olives with juice, and the pecans in the blender and just pulsed it a couple of times to chop it all up. I didn't add the seasoned salt, (thought it might be to salty with the olive juice) but I did add a small amount of garlic powder!!! WOW what a good dip!!  I have made this three times since Thanksgiving and it all got ate up in no time. (warning...YOU MUST LOVE SALT) as this is very salty. I do love salt so it was great for me. I love to use chip with ripples in them. The cheese MUST come to room temp to do this, OR add a spoon or knife to place on crackers or chips. LOVE the recipe. Thanks so much.

EXCELLENT!  I love olives and I love these!  This was not as time consuming as I thought it would be.  The olives were easy to cover.  I did leave out the salt as I felt they would be salty enough.  I rolled them in walnuts as they are my favorite.  I refrigerated them 30 minutes before slicing with a serated knife that was wiped clean after each slice for a clean cut.   Thank you HSHELTON25 for such an EXCELLENT recipe!  These will be served for sure when the family gets together for the holidays.

Very messy. I really didn't like them but guests said they were decent. I think they were a bit bland.

I actually make these with plain cream cheese, green olives, and chopped walnuts!  Great!!  As someone else said, just make sure to dry the olives very good!

I added 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (or pimenton) to the cheese mixture.  And, I sliced the olives and added them to the cream cheese, then rolled that into little bags and coated w/ walnuts.  Very tasty.

Very Easy Appetizer
They are delicious! When making them for an event, I will drain the olives, reserving the juice. Once I roll them in cream cheese, I prefer them to be rolled in nuts just before serving with a quick chill to set them.  Otherwise, the nuts get a bit soggy if left in the fridge overnight.

I couldn’t figure out the secret to getting the cream cheese on the olives.  Was it supposed to be this messy? Was I supposed to pat the olives dry first?  Messy and a little too time consuming to coat each olive if you ask me.  I like the idea of dicing the olives and mixing into the cream cheese and the rolling into balls - I’ll try that next time

I was lazy. Didn’t want to cook. This recipe turned out to be more work than cooking something!  Cream cheese is messy to work with. The end product was too rich and cream-cheesy for my taste but guinea pigs said they liked it. Then again, guinea pigs don’t normally say “yuck! who made this....” at pot lucks.

Flavors are wonderful but I must admit, it was messy to do. Also I did not use regular cream cheese but 1/3 fat free so they were even messier. Will attempt to freeze them before I cut them.

Clever and unique recipe. Definitely not a quick and simple dish as it does take time to wrap the cream cheese on the olives even after letting it harden first. I served these on a deviled egg tray which worked really nicely.   While everyone liked them, most only had one olive worth so plan accordingly.

The only change I made was to leave out the salt.  I think the olives are salty enough.  Also, I toasted the pecans before chopping them.  Yes, this is messy to make, but worth it!

Loved this recipe. Originally struggled getting the cream cheese to stay on the olives without smearing it all over myself but figured out a great way of using 2 spoons.

This is a favorite appetizer of mine and my Mother's to make for the holidays or wine parties on the deck in summer.  Easy and delicious!
