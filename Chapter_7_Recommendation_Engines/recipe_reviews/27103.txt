Sweetened lime juice refers to something like Rose's Lime Juice, a concentrated sweetened lime juice that you can usually find in a bottle near liquor mixers.

sweetened lime juice can be bought at a liquor store or in the drink mix isle of your grocery store.  The only brand I have ever bought is "Rose's Sweetened Lime Juice."  It is used in other drinks as well and it is what its called.  Sweetened lime juice.

This is a great idea, but make it even better by adding  melon liqeur and 7-up (this is called a Shazam, served at Queen's University campus bars!)

This was pretty good. It was a little too sweet for me, next time I will add more lime juice.
