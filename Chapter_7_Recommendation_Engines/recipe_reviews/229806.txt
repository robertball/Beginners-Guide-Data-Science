I liked how simple this was to make. I had Kraft Tuscan Italian dressing so I used that. I just made up about 2 servings and quartered some brown button mushrooms and used roma tomatoes sliced. Give it time to sit, as the mushrooms need time to soften. I tried it with the parsley and liked it better without. I thought it was allright, as is, but so much better once I added some Greek pitted black kalamata olives. It made it taste like an antipasto side dish. I am giving it a 4 with the olives or adding other antipasto add-ins.

I like to use Baby Bella mushrooms in this recipe. Kraft makes a  bottled balsamic italian dressing that I like to use in this recipe. I usually don't use the whole 8 ounces of dressing only because I don't want them swimming in it, I start with a quarter cup and keep adding until it's where I want it.
