It is a great hit with the guys. I usually rinse the beef and towel dry it to remove some of the salt. Also I chop up some of the beef in the ball itself. Great for tailgate parties too. Gooooo  Dolphins!

I was surprised by the high ratings, as I did not enjoy the concoction.  Its very salty, but I forgot to rinse the beef.  If you're making it, be sure to do so.  I wondered about substituting Carl Buddig chipped beef for the dried.

I made this recipe using 8 oz of cream cheese, and no onions. I rolled the outside in sunflower seeds. It was DELICIOUS!

This was a little on the dry side for me.  The favor was ok, not exciting.  But people ate it, so it couldn't have been that bad!

I sub onion & garlic powder for the ones with salt. Then, you might not find it necessary to rinse the beef. I left celery salt, but if I make it again, I might try celery seed, as a sub.

Not enough cream cheese, too much dried beef, too much other salt. Modify that at will and taste it before you mold it together and you'll have a winner. Some people like more salt, some people like less, but it definitely needs more cheese to bind it. Thanks for sharing!
