This was very good and delicious, but I changed the recipe a little. I was a little confused with 2 cups cocoa that the recipe uses, so I used just one cup and it was perfect. I used Orange coconut cookies recipe from this site to substitute tea biscuits and I utilized all cookies. Then I used just about 1/2- 3/4 cup butter and no more. And I think the mixture was a little sticky even with this amount of butter. I added a little coconut flakes. Be sure to refrigerate the salami completely.

This turned out really good! I followed the directions on the the amounts of Coco powder and butter. A couple things I did different: 1.) I didn't have cognac so a used blackberry brandy, I had on hand.2.) Used crazins (dried cranberries) instead of raisins. 3.) Instead of tea biscuits, I used rice crispies. Also I added some flaked coconut. Tried to keep the amounts that were in the recipe. 4.) I added  1tspn.orange extract. Delicious and decadent!
It all firmed up really well. Made these for Christmas gifts.

This is awesome! I followed the directions but used vsop brandy because I could not find an inexpensive cognac I liked. It is soo pretty, a real "grown up" chocolatey confection! Very easy to make, I highly recommend this  recipe!

This is delicious. I was confused with the tea cookie ingredient  so I guessed as to what that meant. The cookie I selected wasn't very sweet so I think next time I'll purchase Lorna Dunes. I used brandy instead of cognac as that is what I had. I will make again and probably change up the raisins for another dried fruit, etc.
