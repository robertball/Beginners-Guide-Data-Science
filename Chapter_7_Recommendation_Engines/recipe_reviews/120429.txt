This chicken was phenomenal! I didn't have soy sauce so I used teriyaki. I didn't have ginger so I used cinnamon. I didn't have enough honey so I used what I had. And it still turned out fabulous! I did add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Definitely adding this one to my recipe box!

Great recipe.  The chicken stayed nice and moist.  I used two chicken breasts and halved the recipe.  It was perfect.

Yum! I haven't eaten so much chicken in one sitting in a long time! My husband and 3-yr old love it too. I did not have an onion on hand so I used some chives instead. In the middle of baking the chicken I added some corn starch to thicken up the glaze so that it stayed on the chicken instead of running off of it while trying to baste it. I served this over rice. 5 stars for taste and for how easy it is!

This chicken was soooo good.  My husband and I loved it.  I followed another person's suggestion and added corn starch at the end to thicken the sauce.  I served it with rice.  Next time I'll serve it with stir fry veggies as well.  The chicken is sweet and moist!  Probably the best recipe I've gotten from the site!

I really enjoyed this, but will probably add some brown sugar next time to step up the sweetness. I made with thinly sliced chicken breast and made some additions! I added corn, broccoli, and day old rice and turned this into a stir fry. It was great! Didn't have time to leave in the oven. It was still good and very tender!

Ingredients, meaning honey & sherry, are too expensive to make an only average dish.  Honey isn't predominant - only sweetness with soy & ginger.  I'll stick with a brown sugar based recipe.

I also cooked this in a crock pot but I didn't have any apple juice so I used apple sauce, I also added more water to the recipe.  It was moist and I used some of the sauce to make gravy for mashed potatoes and it was excellent.

This was a very very good recipe. Being a beginner cook, I can say that it was very easy. I actually used boneless chicken tenderloins and marinated them with about half of the mixture, for only about 20 minutes. I used a grilling pan to cook them. I then sliced them up and put it on a bed of lettuce on a tortilla wrap. I added a little extra honey and a little bit of the left over marinade. I wrapped it up, threw on the grill pan for another 2 min or so and it was GREAT! A quick and easy lunch that really beat going out to eat.

Great flazor and very moist, I made it for Rosh Hoshanah.  I cooked it in the crock pot for 6 hours, I was so worried that it was going to be dried out, but it was perfect.  Served over brown rice.

Very good and very easy.  My chicken breasts are small thin ones and don't seem to hold up to long cooking times, but that's just something I have to adjust.  I had a ham glaze mix I needed to use so I used that instead of the honey, and it actually worked out well (it has brown sugar and honey powder in it).  I put everything in the crockpot last night, popped it in hte fridge, and had bf put it in and turn it on this morning.  I must've been sleeping when I put everything together last night because I forgot the ginger, garlic, and onion.  So, this evening when I got home I used the liquid to make a gravy and added the ginger, garlic, and onion powder in.  It was very good, and since I cooked it in the crockpot I added carrots and potatoes.  Both were cooked perfectly and the carrots tasted like candied carrots.  Thanks for the recipe.

The chicken was juicy and delicious, but I'm not sure it lived up to the name "honey glazed".  The predominate flavor was the soy sauce and sherry I used, not the honey.  Although it was still delicous, I might try it next time with apple juice, since I like the combination of sweet with chicken.

This recipe is delicious! I used chicken thighs and baked them covered for the first 30 min, starting skin side down. I flipped them every half hour and uncovered for the last half hour (total cooking time, close to 2 hours). They came out very tender and flavorful. I used apple juice, not sherry. I'll be making this again, thanks for sharing!

So easy to make and so delicious / moist!  I loved how I could easily make a whole bunch of chicken and eat it for leftovers throughout the week.

This was good. Nothing amazing. It certainly wasn't glazed by any means and the sauce was a little thin and bland but was decent over white rice. My family ate it and seemed to enjoy it. I would make it again because it was quick and easy to throw together.

Very good ! I used orange juice in place of the apple juice. It created a honey orange chicken, very good over rice.

I cut this down to make four chicken breasts out of it.  I marinated them for 36 hours and they were so tender you merely had to touch them with a fork and they would cut open for you.  Oh...SO GOOD!!!

My two year old wouldn't touch it (but the only meat she does eat regularly is shrimp).  I cut the recipe in half and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  My husband generally hates dark meat and even he liked this recipe. They were finished baking in 45 minutes and tasted wonderful!  Served with brown rice and a mixed veggie for a complete, healthy, and very yummy meal.
