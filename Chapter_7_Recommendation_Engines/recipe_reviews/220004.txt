Wow! This is an awesome soup. This little protestant impressed her jewish neighbors with this wonderful soup :) I have to admit to being a bit too frugal to use two whole chickens, so I removed most of the meat from a warm rotisserie chicken and reserved the meat in the frig. I then threw that carcass and another frozen carcass in the pot and cooked as directed. I also added two sweet potatoes (as requested by neighbors) and I added 2 Tablespoons of grebenes (chicken cracklings) to the Matzoh ball dough. I do have to say that this makes a huge amount of matzoh balls, so next time I may cut the dough in half. These little balls expand very nicely to about double the size. I used my small spring loaded cookie scoop to make perfect 1 inch balls. This helps the problem of over handling and toughening the matzoh balls . Love this and this will be my matzoh ball soup from now on. Thanks so much for sharing JacobAngel. I know there is a special place in heaven for the grandparents who taught you this wonderful recipe!

This soup was very delicious! I followed the recipe exactly but I didn't cook the chicken in the water with the veggies. Even though I didn't do this, it still came out fantastic! However, someone made this soup and cooked the chicken with the veggies and it gave the soup a very nice flavor! In the end, it was the best matzo soup I've ever made!

I made this on a chilly, rainy day.  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the rotisserie chicken.  What a perfect comfort food.  I have also made this and strained everything out at the end so I was left with only broth and matza balls.  It's even delicious that way!  Either way this is a keeper!  Thanks to the Angel Family!

I think I didn't add enough water...it ended up being not so much of a soup...

I make at least 2 soups a week in Winter and I have been craving some new soup that I wasn't sure what that craving was. After 3 days of cruising recipes on and off, I came upon this one. I knew instantly that Matzo Ball soup was that craving!! Well, I just made it and it hit right on spot and more! Yum, yum and Yummly!
