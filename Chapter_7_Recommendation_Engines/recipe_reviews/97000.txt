Call the recipe police, I tweaked!  I had half a pkg of Smokies that needed using. My jalapeños were really big and long so instead of setting  the sausages into the cream cheese I processed the two together then filled the peppers.  I didn't have bacon but did have a pkg of real bacon bits so I turned the peppers upside down into the bits. I intended to brush with BBQ sauce before doing the bacon but forgot so I used that for dipping.  Unfortunately my jalapeños were totally without fire so that element was missing.  I will play with this again with smaller peppers and  might add green onions and cilantro to the cream cheese.

Wrapping the bacon completely around is a must as the jalapenos soften while baking and make them tough to eat as finger food.  I found the the bbq sauce you use changes this dish a lot.  My family liked a sweet and smoky bbq sauce.  Good stuff!

These were time consuming but very flavorful and worth it in the end. I used the real bacon bits to make things a little easier. Note the error in the ingredient list, 30 peppers halved would require 60 lil smokies instead of the 30 listed. Thanks for the great recipe!

these were ok to me.  It was, I think just to much flavors going on at one time.  I think I will stick to eating my bacon wrapped smokies and jalapeno poppers seperately.

Delicious.  I prefer lil' smokies browned.  This recipe was delicious with or without a lil' smokie inside.  If I use a lil' smokie I will likely brown them first before placing inside the wrap.

Party favorite, people beg me to make these.  Sometimes if I don't have cocktail wieners, or small smoked sausage, I'll just cut up some full size sausage and work with that.

Crowd pleasing recipe!!  Slightly labor intensive, but just make a bunch at a time, and you get the assembly line going, at any rate, the time spent is well worth the smiles!!

Everyone loved it. I suggest partially pre cooking the bacon to ensure it is cooked all the way around or flipping them 1/2 way through. It was exceptional matched tastes. We used sticky fingers.com bbq sauce. Memphis style. Bellissimo.

These were the hit of the party, even though I forgot to put on the barbecue sauce.  Note that the ingredient listing is a bit deceiving.  You only need 15 jalapenos split in half to make 30 halves.  I did add about 1/2-1 cup of cheddar to the cream cheese.

These were delicious! My husband has made these but on the grill before and they are always good. I did not use the bbq sauce. However, I did add a slice of cheese to each one.  Some had mozzarella and provolone. Super good! Will make them again.

There are too many competing flavors here, and they dont seem to come together.  I never could get the bacon to crisp up, even that which was not covered with bbq sauce.  Other bacon wrapped appetizera were baked at 450 degrees; that might have helped. If I made something like this again, I would cook them on a wire rack over a tray with edges so the bacon fat drained off and they didnt sit in grease. I wont make this again, though.

Always a hit, they literally finish within minutes! Only downside I would say is they take quite a bit of prep time BUT they're totally worth it! Oh and beware of spicy jalapenos, best wear some gloves if not, you'll end up with burning hands. Not a good feeling!

Easy to make and everything in a snack that a guy could ask for. I did add shredded cheddar and diced onions to the cream cheese. Next time I am going to add some of the seeds and webbing from the peppers in order to add a little heat.

These were great! I completely omitted the barbeque sauce and I'm so glad I did. This was the easiest "popper" I have ever made and the most delicious. No one could stop eating them. I will make these every chance I get.
