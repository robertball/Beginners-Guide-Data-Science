This may be deserving of a five, but only after some changes are made....what's up w/ the vinegar, walnuts, and cayenne?!  Hubby loves cilantro, and so I remade it and I chose to change the recipe. I used 2 cups cilantro, 1/4 cup of roasted pinenuts, 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, 2 tsp of salt, 2 tsp of black pepper, 1 tsp minced garlic, and 6 Tbsp olive oil.  All I can say is wow...what a kick!!!  Much better!!

Wow!  This was really good!    The only thing I substituted was pine nuts instead of the other nuts.  Also the left overs actually tasted better the next day- I think I will make the pesto again a day ahead of time so the flavors will blend better.  Also there is no need to pick the leaves off the cilantro- just wash- squeeze out the water-cut the ends off, then cut in half and add to the blender- I learned that from making Amy's Cilantro Sauce(on this site)so many times.

I used this recipe to create a quick and easy appetizer I had at a party a few years ago.  Spread one package of cream cheese on a plate and then spread it with the cilantro pesto.  Serve with tortilla chips or crackers.  I used more cilantro than called for in this recipe - almost double, I think.  Also added some lime juice which gave a great, bright burst of flavor.  Don't really remember how much, but maybe 1-2 T?

This was great! To adjust to personal taste: I use only 2 cloves of garlic, which was plenty. 1/3 c. of parmesan, 1/2 tsp. black pepper, 1 tbs. lemon juice and, 1/3 c. Brazilian nuts.  Awesome pesto!...Next time, Iâ€™d double recipe so I can freeze some in an ice-cube tray for quick meals. Thank you for sharing and for some many helpful reviews.

I was not expecting much from this, but it was very good! I often buy fresh cilantro to use a small amount for a recipe, and it's frustrating trying to find a way to use up the rest. This is a tasty and easy way to use it up. I may try some other cilantro pesto recipes as well, but the nice thing about this one is that you probably have all the ingredients on hand.

Excellent!  I added some water as a replacement for half the oil.  The flavors were definitely better the second day.  I'd recommend preparing the sauce the night before to give the flavors a chance to meld.

read previous reviews so subbed lemon juice for vinegar. Had pine nuts after making basil pesto, so toasted them & used them instead. Also, used about a 1/4t crushed red pepper instead of cayenne...I don't like really hot, just a zing.  Since I was washing the cilantro as I was adding it to the blender, putting all the liquids in to begin w/, it got a little water & mixed up very nicely.  Let it sit in fridge overnite & used on pasta w/ some feta...yum!!!

We loved this!  We used it first as a sauce with grilled chicken breasts, and used the leftovers as a pasta sauce.  My husband liked it so much, he called his mother and told her how great it was!  Victory!

This is excellent! I followed the recipe as far as the pesto goes but then decided to add chicken. I cooked the boneless chicken breast with garlic, red onions, and yellow peppers. MMMM! My guest thoroughly enjoyed it and I plan to pass this one on.

A nice change for pesto.  I wasn't sure about the combination of cilantro and parm. cheese and walnuts, but it actually works.  I used whole wheat pasta, omitted the pepper, added a few tablespoons of lime juice and used less olive oil for a chunkier pesto.  Just be careful not to use too much cilantro, or else it becomes bitter.

Well I made the mistake of following the first reviewer's advice as she changed the recipe and it came out horribly oversalted. So I tried to salvage the rest of the pesto by trying to incorporate a few of the original ingredients that the original submitter included that the first reviewer took out (cayenne pepper and vinegar), and it was much better. I will update when I've had a chance to make the recipe completely as stated.

This recipe did NOT go over at my house. My boyfriend, said "nope," and put it down. I've never had him refuse to finish a meal.  I think the problem was the garlic. I love garlic, but 5 cloves was way too much and it totally overpowered the dish. If I made this again, which is unlikely because I don't think I could tempt the bf into tasting it again, I would tone the garlic down to 2 cloves.

Like others, I changed a few things. I didn't add cheese, or pasta. I used 1/2 TBSP vinegar and 1/2 TBSP white wine. I used shelled seeds from a few butternut squashes I've used in recent weeks and saved up instead of walnuts or pecans. I also added a pinch of black pepper and used sea salt (just a pinch). I stored the finished product in an ice cube tray for individual servings/storage.

My gosh this stuff's good. I've been eating it lightly spread on unbreaded chicken burgers with grilled vegetables, and it's truly a wonderful pesto. The cayenne's lovely in the mix. I can't wait to try other applications with the pesto, thanks for the recipe!

Incredible recipe! I left out the vinegar (seemed weird) and the cheese (I'm vegan), but would HIGHLY recommend keeping the walnuts. Walnuts are one of the  Super Foods and this is a great way to get some into your diet, plus they add a wonderfully earthy taste to the sauce!

I just made this dish (with a few adjustments) and it is AWESOME.  I added some lemon juice as other reviewers have suggested and used black pepper instead of cayenne.  I didn't measure my ingredients - just added whatever amount seemed appropriate...and yum!

Very good, but the garlic is a little too intense.  I love garlic, but I just felt like it overpowered the cilantro a bit too much.  This would be a great spread for bruschetta though!  Mmmm!  I will definitely make it again, just with less garlic next time.

This came out really well though i have to say, i couldn't tell that there was cilantro in it [instead of the usual basil]. I did change it a bit. I didn't have any white wine vinegar so i used red and added a couple of squirts of lemon juice. The large [more than normal] amount of garlic made it delightfully spicy. Also, when i mixed the pesto with the pasta, i added one finely chopped tomato and 1/4 of a bell pepper and it gave the final dish a little more texture and freshness.

I'd give this 10 stars! I didn't make the pasta. Only made the pesto and left out the nuts. Then I mixed the pesto with some ricotta cheese and used to make crostini. Just spread some olive oil on some slices of French bread, toast under the broiler, top with slices of tomato, then ricotta and cilantro pesto mixture, then sprinkle parmesean cheese over all and broil for 1 minute. Yum!

This recipe was super delicious after I altered it a bit. I used about 2/3 cup of olive oil, lemon juice instead of vinegar, added about half a small can of green chile, onion powder, less than a pound of the pasta, heaping 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne and skipped the nuts. Turned out awesomely spicy! My picky eaters loved it! I even added chopped jalapeno to mine because I love spicy food. Add a little grilled or pulled rotisserie chicken to top it off!

Sooooooooo good!  I only had canola oil, used walnuts, and subbed lemon juice for the vinegar.  I admit I added maybe a 1/2 cup of parmesan, and I regret nothing.  I froze the leftovers while topping off the container with a tad of oil to preserver its freshness.

If you like cilantro, this is a very good twist on pesto. You can also serve it over spaghetti squash if you're on a low-carb diet.

This is an awesome recipe except for two things.  DO NOT use the vinegar...made it taste a little odd. And 5 cloves of garlic is way too much....I used 3 cloves and it was a little overpowering.  And I didn't have the walnuts or pecans and this tasted just as good.

This was delish!  But the garlic was really powerful.  I think it can be scaled down to three cloves.  My hubby loved this on the pasta, but I think it would be better on crusty bread.  Next time, as I have LOTS of fresh cilantro to use from my garden.

I love cilantro but have only ever used it in salsa's.  I was thrilled to find a new way to use it and this stores really well in the fridge.  Easy to make and great to pull at a later date for a quick amazing pasta dish!

With rice wine vinegar, salt & pepper and a last minute addition of a jalapeno-we had a great meal.  I took jumbo shrimp and sauteed in a little of the pre-vinegared pesto mix. Toasted pecans, some good quality pec romano and lots of olive oil made the bowties exciting with a light coating of pesto.  Plopped a few shrimp on each plate and served with a light, sweet white.  Tastyness!

Delicious!  I have been wanting to make pesto forever and was so glad to find this recipe.  I used a whole bunch of cilantro, plus about 1/2 cup loose parsley leaves and about 1/4 cup loose basil leaves I had to use up.  Also squeezed juice from 1/2 a lime in addition to vinegar.  Wonderful. I will make a double batch next time.  The amount of garlic was just right for us, as well as the cayenne.

Yum!  And so easy.  I live in Korea and cilantro is  hard to come by, but a nice Canadian knew that my Californian self would appreciate some cilantro from the big city so I had a bunch.  For my taste, I'll prob cut the garlic a bit the next time I make it, but I LOVED it.  I put it over rice noodles.  I will try it over chicken, too.  Thank you for the very good recipe.

Really good alternative to regular basil pesto.  I used lemon juice instead of the vinegar, a little less oil and a combo of walnuts and sunflower seeds.  This was terrific on sandwiches, steaks, and pasta.

This was my first experience with pesto and was very pleased.  I only wish I would have had more of an idea as to how much "one bunch" of cilantro was....I will definitely make this again.  Two cloves of garlic is more than enough!!!!

This was fabulous! I wouldn't change a thing--except I did use only 2 cloves of garlic, which was plenty. We look forward to enjoying this recipe many more times in the future.

If you like cilantro this is a recipe for you!  I made and froze it.  It has been added to tortilla soup, spread on chicken breasts before grilling, added to pasta, and mixed with sauteed peppers and onions for fajitas.  WOW!!  So versatile that I made more to experiment with!

Since the cilantro was taking over the garden, I was looking for a good way to use it. This is it. I think i like it better than basil pesto. Grow, cilantro grow!

Made this recipe exactly as its written and I LOVED it! The only thing I will do different next time is less Cayenne b/c I found it too hot. Otherwise, its a great alternative to regular basil pesto which costs so much more to make. Cilantro Pesto for me from now on! Great recipe!!!

This pesto has a bit more zip than the traditional pesto recipes.  I love using cilantro, which is much less expensive than fresh basil, and much more accessible.  I enjoyed the first serving of the sauce, but, unlike others who rated the pesto, mine did not reheat well.  It was quite flavorless the second time around.

I was looking for some way to use up a bunch of cilantro, and I decided to give this a shot. Since I didn't have white wine vinegar, I took some of the reviewers' advice and used lemon juice instead. Other than that, I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. I wasn't sure about the first few bites (I'd only had basil pesto up to this point), but eventually I decided that this pesto is amazing. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks!

I like the amount of garlic, but I'm a garlic lover (and used small cloves).  I didn't have any nuts, so I just omitted them; and it turned out fine.  Same with the Parmesan--I put in a little chicken bouillon as a substitute. I probably only put in half of the olive oil and added some water to keep the fat down, which didn't cause any problems.  I threw some ground turkey into the sauce & let it cook on the stove a little, which turned out surprisingly well (though chopped chicken would probably be best).  I added some chunks of avocado at the end, which was delicious :) A great, economic recipe...yummy!

I used chili powder instead of cayenne, lime juice instead of vinegar and walnuts then let it sit in the refrigerator for a few days.  When I mixed it in with the hot pasta I grated parmesan on top.  Delicious

OOOHHH this is soooo good!!!

I had a bumper crop of Cilantro this year and didn't know what to do with it all....well this was the perfect solution!!!  BTW- this is easy to freeze and enjoy throughout the winter months!!!

I love this on anything you usually use cilanto & oil on....I love it on fish, in dressings/vinagerettes.  On grilled steak!!!!  or even just on a good hearty bread!!

I only made the pesto as I wanted to serve it on ahi tuna.  It has a great flavor but I won't heat it up on the stove again.  Although I stirred it constantly, the mixture separated from the oil.  Tip to the reviewer who said it came out bitter:  walnuts can be bitter and I recommend using pecans instead.

This was realy good.  I used 8 oz. of pasta instead of 16 and added a couple chopped, sauteed chicken tenders to make it a main-dish meal.  I tasted the pesto before adding it to the pasta and it was somewhat bitter, so I was worried, but after being mixed into the pasta and adding the chicken, it tasted great and not bitter at all.  I used lime juice instead of vinegar, and 3 cloves of garlic.  Also used 1/4 plus 1 TBS. of quality olive oil.  I used whole wheat penne.  Served with a veggie for a simple and tasty dinner!

I would have never thought to make pesto out of cilantro, as I have only had the basil-based kind. But this was fantastic (and much cheaper than using fresh basil, as well)!! I brushed mine over some seabass steaks and stuck them in the broiler for a few minutes - it was really delicious. I can't wait to try it over pasta. Thanks for the idea!

I was honestly blown away by this recipe.  I wasn't sure if I would like the cilantro but it came out very very nicely.  I actually didn't have any nuts (something I realized only after I had put everything else together) but it still tasted great.  I also added some pan fried shrimp.  
The only change I would make is next time I think I would wait until I stirred the noodles in with the sauce to add the parmesan because when it melted the cilantro clumped all together.

We just hated this!  Followed the recipe exactly and found it inedible.  It might be improved by the suggested lemon juice instead of vinegar but I won't be trying it again to find out.

I have a ton of fresh cilantro in our garden so I was trying to find different uses for it. My 12 y.o. has already asked me to make it again! We like angel hair so I tossed it with a pound of that! Delish!!!!

I hate to throw away a partially used bunch of cilantro.  I did find a way to make it last a bit longer in the 'fridge but it'll still go bad after a short while. My wife suggested cilantro pesto; so, I tried this mix. Coupla t'ings: I thought a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne was a bit much (even though I'm a spicy/pungent aficionado ). So, try a 1/4 teaspoon during the first blend/processing (I used a processor) and then add to taste. You can always add more as you add more oil.  Suffice it to say, 1/2 teaspoon was fine by me.  Garlic: same goes with the garlic.  Yes, yes I know, pesto is supposed to have GARLIC; but, same as with the cayenne, 3-4 cloves and then adjust accordingly.  I used walnuts as the recipe called for though if you're used to making basil pesto and are used to using pine nuts, have no fear, this works fine (and a lot cheaper). Don't get me wrong, this is a keeper. Just has to be adjusted according to taste.  Thank for recipe and the suggestions that followed.

This was good.  I wasn't sure what to expect since cilantro has such a strong flavor, but I liked it and would make it again.  I used lime juice (not vinegar or lemon juice) and liked what it added to the flavor.  I did not warm it up in a saucepan; rather I just tossed it raw into the pasta.

My husband thought this was good, but I just did not care for it.  I usually really like cilantro, but when it comes to pesto, I think I'll stick with the classic basil and pinenut pesto.  The consistency and balance and everything seemed fine, it just didn't tickle my tastebuds.  Thanks for the recipe though.

I made this with macadamia nuts. Soooo good. I put it on grilled tilapia, and then ate it on tortilla chips when I ran out of fish. This will be a summer staple for sure! :)

I couldn't pass up the 3 for $1 sale on cilantro, so this was the perfect recipe to use it up.  I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except substituting lemon juice for wine vinegar, and adding a jalapeÃ±o pepper for that extra heat.  It was delicious on top of grilled chicken breast.

Excellent!  We've never made pesto before, but this turned out perfect!  We used italian dressing instead of the white wine vinegar, and pine nuts.  we also ended up using a little less than 1/2 c olive oil and thought it was the perfect consistency.  Thanks for this great and easy recipe!

This was allright. I guess I prefer classic basil pesto.... Don't get me wrong... this was good, just not great (or something I'd make again). My fiance agrees. We both felt that the end product was terribly dry (this recipe calls for waaay too much pasta, IMHO). Additionally, I felt that the cayenne was out of place. While I like the kick it imparted, I found it unnecessary and a tad odd for my liking. Tossed with whole wheat penne, this was an average, yet filling meal. I must admit, this was quite easy to prepare and economical to boot (cilantro is REALLY cheap compared to basil). I'm glad I tried this, but will stick to the "real" thing from now on. Thanks for sharing your unique idea though, Gena :)

Pretty good.  I also subbed pine nuts for the kind called for.  Next time I will use lime juice instead of vinegar.  Otherwise, somewhat bland.  Maybe I needed to add salt or something.

This is a really good pesto!  I substituted toasted pine nuts for the nuts and used a tablespoon of fresh lime juice instead of vinegar.  Definitely a keeper to make again.

Delicious! Made this with pasta to searve with chicken.  Pasta could have been served on it's own...family loved it!  Cayanne gave it a little kick and just love that this was made with cilantro.  Will definitely make again.

This is excellent, easy, and quick.  The cayenne gives it a nice bite.  I forgot the olive oil and was wondering why it was so clumpy, well, there's the answer.  Don't be like me.  Put in the olive oil.  Amazingly enough, we ran out of parmesan cheese so I subbed mozzarella and used almonds instead of pecans or walnuts.  Very good taste, with the cilantro flavor coming through nicely.  Thanks!

Well I had high hopes for this but it was WAY too hot for us.  My son wouldn't eat it and my husband just didn't like the flavors.  I thought it was OK and I liked that it had a very fresh taste to it.  We added chicken to make it a meal.  Not one I'll make again though.

So good. I have to make this all the time from now on, because I'm addicted. I was kind of teetering on the edge of cilantro acceptance, and this recipe gave me the shove I needed. The taste of the cilantro wasn't overpowering like I thought it might be. All of the proportions were perfect; it wasn't too oily, too garlicky, or too..um, cilantro-y. The only thing I tweaked was the cayenne. I didn't have any, so I stuck some crushed red pepper flakes in the magic bullet and processed until they were mostly powdery. I think that probably made it slightly spicier than it would've been if I'd used cayenne, but some reviewers said it needed extra spice anyway, so hey! It all worked out, and it was delicious.

This is a very nice recipe. I know someone commented on the use of pine nuts versus walnuts or pecans, in my home I rarely have pine nuts on hand, however I always have walnuts and or pecans. I always appreciate ease of use when it comes to a recipe.  I used an Italian dressing in place of the white wine vinegar and tossed some cooked shrimp in at the end. Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing alternative to regular basil pesto. I usually only need cilantro in small amounts so this is great way to not let the rest go to waste. I substituted regular olive oil for extra virgin and used almonds instead of walnuts or pecans (only because it was all I had at the time).

Terrific! Subbed lemon juice for the vinegar but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Good kick--nice and garlicky! I will try blending in some chipotle peppers next time for some tex-mex style.

I just finished eating this pesto for dinner tonight. My husband and I both enjoyed it! I love cilantro, so I am always game for making something new with it. Based on some of the reviews I read, I made the pesto yesterday so it would have a chance to settle. I am on a strict diet, so I omitted the olive oil and used water and extra juice instead, but it was still great. I will definately be making this one again!

Like the name implies, this is a "Fabulous" pesto.  I added some parsley and 2 tbs lime juice, and used 1/2 fresh jalepeno pepper (scraped clean--no seeds!)instead of the cayenne pepper.  Great recipe; thanks Gena.

I'm still not sure this was worth cleaning out the food processor for, but it was a good way to use up leftover cilantro.  I didn't have walnuts, so I used pine nuts.  The walnuts probably would have been better.  I also added a couple tablespoons of milk, as I prefer my pesto a little creamier.

We used this pesto on top of spaghetti. I agree that the 5 cloves of garlic was a little over the top--if I make this again, I think that I would only use 2 cloves. I also might try to use half basil or parsely, half cilantro next time, since the cilantro has such a powerful flavor.

This is amazing!  I made it using less oil and with crushed pecans because thats all I had on hand.  I used it on homemade pizza as a base sauce and it was excellent!  This is my new favourite pesto for sure!

I love this recipe, only I never use 
5 cloves of garlic, only two and even
that seems pretty strong, although I 
love garlic. Anyway, this one is great.

This pesto sauce is the best pesto Iâ€™ve ever had! Itâ€™s the perfect amount of spicy. I make a batch and eat it with everything: chicken, fish, avocado toast. My mom put some in her Indian chicken curry and it added a great flavor!

I made it today , it was delicious .  The pasta I used was rotini  and prepare the pesto based in the instructions . I didnâ€™t put almonds on it . The cilantro flavour is heaven ! My husband loved it and definitely this is  winner . I served it with grilled chicken and beets marinated in brown sugar, orange juice , salt and pepper and the combination of flavours and colours make the dish very attractive . Thanks for this wonderful recipe

Really awesome recipe. It is garlicky but I love garlic. If you don't, perhaps reduce. I put it in a pasta with chicken, mushrooms, red onions, and cherry tomatoes. Very yummy! I thinned it a bit with more olive oil as the recipe suggests and a bit of pasta water. Will definitely make it again. Thank you for the recipe!

I will make it again, but possibly a little less cayenne pepper. Was fine for me, but others thought it was spicy. I also cut up five Roma tomato's and mixed in.

I made this once following the recipe exactly (even bought walnuts just for this!). I would give it a 3 as written. I made it a second time using lemon juice instead of the vinegar, a touch of brown sugar (we're talking 1/8 tsp at most here), and subbed cashews for the walnuts. I pulsed the cashews first with a bit of water until it was almost cashew cream as well, added the rest of the ingredients and processed well, then simmered the mixture for a few minutes to take the raw edge off the garlic. My changes make it not really a pesto but still delicious!

I always make  basil pesto, especially in Spring and Summer when I grow my own basil. Today, my husband asked me to make him a pesto and Mozzarella Panini for lunch.  I had no basil in the house so I decided to make this cilantro pesto instead. This pesto was pretty good. The ingredients are usually available in most kitchens and if you're on budget, this is a cheaper option.
The only thing I changed, after reading some reviews, was reducing the amount of garlic to 4 cloves. 
My husband liked it on his Panini and I can't wait to use the rest of it on some pasta another time.

Great recipe... Way too much garlic. I will be modifying next time. I wish I had read some of the reviews before beginning. I may make a whole other batch without any garlic and combine the two. Yikes.

This was great! I'd sort of heard of having pesto as the "sauce" on pasta instead of red sauce or white (clam) sauce, but had never tried it, and was a bit skeptical. I made this exactly as written, except I didn't mince the garlic, as it seemed unnecessary. Also, I opted for walnuts for the nuts. This lasted me for 3 meals, and I even think that the leftovers were better than the fresh-cooked dish. Worth making again!

I thought it was great!  I would never have thought the combination of ingredients would blend so nicely, but they did.  Very rich, what with all the olive oil, so you don't need much more for a filling meal.  Thank you!

The idea for this recipe is great but the flavor profile of the original is a little off. I tweaked - as most folks did - by using traditional pine nuts, and by using Newman's Own Italian dressing, which has some cheese in it already, and is made with Olive Oil. I supplemented a bit of extra olive oil and used 4, not 5 cloves of garlic. It actually turned out really well! I'm looking forward to grilled chicken and some fresh red pepper with it for dinner tomorrow!

I used black walnuts instead of the regular ones I normally keep around.  Did not toast them.  They add a special flavor that was a knockout!  Did not have white wine vinegar so added Bragg's instead.  Worked fine.  Next time, I will definitely add lime juice.  This recipe has me loving cilantro since I have never been fond of it.  Will use it whenever I can on beef, chicken, pasta, or just as a dip with blue corn chips.  It is a GRAND SLAM!

I really liked it but it was a touch too spicy for the kids. Will definitely make it again, though. Subbed malt vinegar for white vinegar.

Edit: I have made this several times now. I sometimes sub any dark leafy green on hand for the cilantro. Different flavor, but still wonderful.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Since the recipe called for walnuts or pecans and I had both, I used both!  I didn't heat the pesto since it was fresh made, room temperature and going on hot pasta.  I really wonder if cilantro has a stronger taste at different times of year because I got very little cilantro taste from this.  I honestly think given a blind taste test I wouldn't have been able to identify it.  I liked the addition of the vinegar - it gave it some zip!  I'm anxious to try this again after the pesto sits for a day.  Thanks!!  ***Update:  I made this for the second time and used all walnuts and romano cheese.  I added the full amount of cayenne which was too much.  On some leftover pasta for lunch it was good but I'm still not convinced that I like pesto.

This is fabulous!  I used pecans and lemon juice instead of vinegar. The family, especially my 10 month old, loved it.

Perfect way to use up cilantro! I marinated chicken with it and it was perfect. Even worked without the parmesan (I didn't have any on hand)

We all need to go shopping for White Wine Vinegar!
 Just made this, looks great while it's marinating in the fridge. 
I used a combo of almonds and pine nuts, half a fresh jalapeno, and lemon j. also....(items I had on hand), tried to keep to the main idea. I plan to use it tomm. night with grilled shrimp and steak fajita's as a paste on the tortilla instead of Guacamole.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used a little less than one bunch of cilantro - only because I needed a few tablespoon for another dish. And I used lime juice rather than the wine vinegar and a fair bit less evoo. I'd make this for 4-6 people rather than 8 and use a little less pasta than called for. It was delicious topped with grilled chicken. Be sure to salt to taste after tossing it with the pasta. Salt brings out flavor so if the flavors just aren't singing then add a bit more and taste again. Oh yeah..i used almonds because it's what I had on hand. I enjoyed the mellow sweetness to balance out the lime and cilantro.

I used pine nuts, and lime juice instead of vinegar. I liked this recipe although 5 cloves of garlic is WAY too strong. My husband took one bite and said that the amount of garlic was burning his mouth. He wouldn't eat anymore so now I've just wasted 1 lb of pasta. I would think 2 cloves of garlic is enough, especially since you're eating it raw. This is the first time I've made pesto with cilantro though and am pleased that there are other alternatives to basil based pesto which can be more expensive. Maybe next time I'll try the walnuts or pecans since they're cheaper than pine nuts.

I love the idea of pesto made with something other than basil.  This required more oil than called for to blend all the ingredients.  Maybe I will enjoy this as a cold salad, but I was disappointed with the taste and texture when the cilantro pesto mixed with the warm pasta.

This was good while concentrated, but somehow too mild once we added it to pasta with some oil. I let it sit for 2 nights before we used it, so the flavors would meld. I added some red pepper flakes. I'm glad we tried it, and we have some left, but I don't think I'd make it again (and we're cilantro lovers!)

Ok, I made this before the way it's printed here and it was awesome. So I had cilantro and wanted to make it again but didn't have all the stuff, so I got creative. I used raw almonds and swiss instead of walnuts and parmesan, and ground red pepper instead of cayenne (subtler, to fit the subtler nuts and cheese), and lemon juice for vinegar. It was interesting. Just as good I think, and it had this unique "clean" quality to the taste. Thanks!

I love cilantro and pasta, so this sounded great.  Tasting as I blended, I added additional lime juice and cayenne.  That is because I love tartness and fire.  Very good.  Will make again.

I didn't like this a single bit! Mine turned out very bitter, and I can't figure out if it was the vinegar or the walnuts or what. Since I love cilantro, I'd give this another shot, but change it up with lime juice instead of vinegar, pine nuts instead of walnuts, and a jalapeno instead of the cayenne.

I like cilantro, but this recipe was too much for me. My husband liked it, but, well, he likes everything. I served it with whole wheat bow ties and grilled chicken. The cilantro was just too overpowering though. I will stick with other pestos.

Wow!  Finally someone who loves garlic as much as me and my boyfriend!  I add pickled jalepenos and skip the cayenne.  Use this as a pizza sauce with some fajita style onions and peppers, some yummy steak or chicken, and some fresh salsa and you have my favorite CPK pizza!  (Don't remember the name-- haven't had to go back there in a while!)

This recipe was so good!  I liked it much better than traditional pesto with basil.  The only change I made was substituting lemon juice for the vinegar and adding half a cup of milk because my blender need more liquid to blend the mix.  I would have given it a five... but my boyfriend and I both agree that  something was missing that was keeping it from being fantastic and I'm not sure what it is.

Really liked this.. very different because of the ingred.  Follow the recipe folks, even if you think it will be too much pepper or you question the combo w/nuts.  By using a food processor it makes it all into a perfect sauce.  Not a dish to eat with company because of the heavy garlic! LOL.. used a bit of water the next day, about 1/4 of a cup because of the soaking up factor. Used wheat penne noodles.

Very good, although my husband thought it was just alright. I did add water to the pesto instead of more Olive oil (just to save on calories) and still turned out nicely. And It never did come to a simmer after quite a while I turned up the heat and finally gave up and just served it.

Very refreshing!!!  I love cilantro, and had purchased quite a bit, and this was the perfect recipe to use up some of what I had.  I enjoy mixing this with 1/2 jar of alfredo sauce and serving with rice or pasta.  Also added some stir-fried chicken to it, and YUM!

I would add additional oil - mine was a little dry.  I will definately make this again!  Great on croistini.

Wasn't crazy about it, didn't hate it.  Hubby remarked it was bland.  I found it difficult to prepare, messy in food processor, tedious to pick the leaves.  Not really worth it in the end.

This recipe was pretty good. I was reluctant to try it because I don't like the pungent taste of cilantro but I made it anyway. I probably won't make it again but I wouldn't discourage others from making it.

The Cilantro Pesto was GREAT!  I took home to my parents over the holidays and they loved it!  A great compliment from my mother who is a SUPER cook!  Thanks.

I find with cilantro, you either love it
or hate it.  This pesto is such a great
variation of regular basil pesto.  
My boyfriend claims that he's not a fan 
of cilantro, so I didn't tell him he was
eating it.  I finally broke it to him 
after he raved about the dinner I had 
made!  I think he's hooked.
