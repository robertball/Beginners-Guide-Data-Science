This went over really well when we had friends over for a BBQ.  One thing I would change is that I would just use regular bacon instead of the thick cut.  I ran out of thick cut and used a few strips of regular and found them a lot easier to wrap with, and they cooked better.  Other than that small change, I will definitely do this again!

ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!! A+++.  VERY easy to make.  I mixed the marinade (which I doubled to be sure to cover all the chicken) threw in the chicken and let it marinate for 5 hours. I put some crushed garlic (just smash the garlic clove with a knife or bottom of a pan) into the marinade to give it a little kick. I also added grape tomatoes, onions and green bellpeppers to the skewers because we love grilled veggies over here.  SOOOOO easy for those who don't have a lot of time in the kitchen. Just throw together all the ingredients and marinate. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!! I am going to try it with sirloin next time. A+++ job Angie!!

This is an awesome recipe. From reading other reviewers comments, I'd like to add that if you boil your bacon for about 5 minutes before you wrap your chicken, it cooks more evenly and won't burn before the chicken is finished. Also for those who like a little kick, add a slice of pickled jalapeno inside each kabob. The sweetness of the honey and the kick of jalapeno are a great combo

I never knew Shish Kabobs could taste this good! My whole family loved it! While making it, we found it was easiest to put the chicken into a plastic bag and pour the marinade over it. (same thing with the mushrooms in a seperate bag). We actually made twice the amount of marinade- which made it incredible. TRY THIS ONE AT HOME! You won't regret it!

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe!!  It has become one of our favorites.  I would change nothing.  The only hint I might pass on is that we do the chicken on one skewer and the veg on the other so that we can get the bacom crisp;we had trouble doing that when we grilled them together.

I doubled the sauce so that I could use some of it to marinade the mushrooms seperately.  With the mushrooms - I also marinated some chopped red/green bell peppers.  This addition was not only tasty but added GREAT colors to the kabobs. As I was pulling these off the grill, I heard my roommate hollar "WHOA!" = Instantly, I thought he had burnt himself but instead - he was sneaking a cooked chicken peice off the skewer before dinner to "taste-test" (as he puts it) and it was SOOO tasty, he couldn't help but cry out! He also told half of his softball team about the kabobs and now they all want to come over to try some this weekend after their softball tournaments!! We are very pleased with this recipe and I will make this again! Thanks Angie!

excellent - I would recommend marinating it for 2 hours at least.  I added boiler onions, cherry tomatoes and squash.  The recipe says that it makes 6 servings- maybe with rice or a side dish otherwise it makes two large servings.

We loved these!  I used regular bacon, and it worked out fine.  I also marinated the chicken and green onions separately from the mushrooms, and then used the mushroom marinade to baste the kebabs.  I thought I had way too much food (I doubled the recipe), but there were no leftovers. The only thing I would do differently next time, would be to use fresh pineapple, rather than canned.

This recipe is PERFECT!  Everyone loved these kabobs.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  I also marinated the mushrooms and the chicken individually.  I marinated the chicken overnight, and the mushrooms for about 3 hours.  It was very good, and a little different.

Good recipe but next time I will marinate longer than this time (3 hours). Added cherry tomatoes but definately felt that onions were needed. Also, this was the one time that I used low sodium soy sauce and bacon and I wish that I had used regular.

Delicious! I cooked it in my oven at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes then 450 degrees for another 3 minutes. I also marinated it for seven hours before cooking which gave the meat a wonderful flavor.

Oh my gosh, this is food I can make myself sick on from eating too much! My rating is based on the recipe AS IS (big believer in that) but I do have a humble opinion for a serving suggestion: Double the sauce. Set half of it aside. Fry up some yakisoba noodles with that sauce and a little water right before the kabobs are done. May be mistaken as manna from heaven.

I added garlic to the marinade and it was GREAT!  Also, to avoid "charred toothpick" (mentioned in an earlier review), just soak your wooden skewer in water for a while before cooking.

This is a GREAT recipe! I used this as a guideline and took the other reviews into consideration - it has become a favorite of my friends. Some things to add: bell peppers and grape tomatoes. Make two batches of the marinade, meat in one batch and veggies in the other. Next time, I'm going to try it with bacon wrapped prawns!

I've made these twice since I've had the recipe and both times they have been AWESOME! They are perfect for get togethers. The second time I used a thick sliced hickory bacon and they were a hundred times better than the first batch. (I didn't think it could be possible) Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe tasted ok but needs so many modifications and takes so long to prepare that I'm afraid it only gets 2 stars.  Here are the changes I'd definitely make before making this recipe again:  1. Use fresh pineapple.  2. Marinate overnight and separate meat and veggies (if the mushrooms don't get hot enough, the bacteria from the raw chicken may not be killed.)  3. Make at least twice the sauce and save some for dipping.  4. Use small whole mushrooms.  5. I'd prefer no bacon next time.

Excellent recipe!  I chose mushrooms, vidalia onions, and red peppers to accompany the chicken and cooked them on separate skewers.  I used center cut thin sliced bacon and it was perfectly cooked, tasted great with everything, and kept the chicken nice and moist.  I would make this for company.

Good dinner party item.  As others have said, double the marinade (next time I'm going to triple it).  Putting a sliced mushroom with the chicken piece and wrapping that with bacon will keep the mushrooms from falling off/splitting.  I made the sauce verbatim.

This must be one of the tastiest kabob recipes I've ever tasted.  The marinade goes well with the bacon wrapped chicken, pinapple, and mushrooms.  The flavor is not over powering or to sweet.  I marinaded the kabobs over night which let the marinade soak into the meat and vegies, making them even mouthing watering. This truly is a great summer treat!!

I first reviewed this in 2003 as Delicious. I want to add EXCELLENT!!! I also want to add that I did not change anything on the recipe, and people that do not have the correct ingredients should not take time to do a review and give negative feedback about the taste.

These turned out amazing! I precooked the bacon in the microwave on papertowel for about 4 minutes and these cooked beautifully. I let the chicken and mushrooms marinate for about 4 hrs and we didn't bother to brush on the leftover marinade while they were grilling - but they still came out with a ton of flavour. Will def make this recipe again!

Rarely does a first time run at a new recipe score WOW with us, but...  I try to make new dishes following the recipe but of course forgot the pineapple on the shopping list, so substituted red bell pepper (on hand) to add some color.  Also, made the marinade and allowed the chicken/marinade to overnight. I used wooden skewers and forgot to soak them in water - no problem. Used large straw mushrooms cut in half. They tended to go to pieces when skewered.   This was easy and delicious. Next time I'll reduce the honey by half. It wasn't offensive, but was a bit overpowering.  Next time we're going to play with this one and try other classic kabob veggies...onion, green bell pepper, tomato etc. Also going to try a more robust mushroom - maybe Portobello's.  I served the kabobs with some steamed broccoli, brown rice and Pinot Grigio. Huge flavor ~ WOW!

First off WOW, we all LOVED!! Will make again and again and try steak next time! Now, on to the recipe. I doubled the marinade,used half for the chicken and the other half for mushrooms, squash and zucchini. I let the meat and veggies marinate for about an hour.  On half of the scewers I wrapped the chicken w/bacon and alternated with the veggies, the other half I left the bacon off.  I enjoyed the ones without bacon and dh and my daughter liked the ones with bacon. My only suggestion is to use low sodium soy sauce in this recipe.

DELICIOUS! The chicken is juicy and the bacon adds so much flavor. I made the mistake of buying sliced mushrooms, which are too small and fall apart when skewered. Whole mushrooms next time. Thanks so much!

Delicious! I forgot the pineapple but we had tropical fruit kebabs for dessert :) Next time I need to cut my chicken chunks bigger (about 2" square) as I ran out of bacon long before chicken.

We just loved it! I have made it three different ways.  First the way it was originally supposed to be, then I tried Turkey Bacon which was not as salty as the regular bacon, but just didn't have that same flavor, so I bought Low-sodium bacon and what a difference! I also used green and red peppers. It is an awesome recipe and so easy to make - a bit messy, but it wasn't terrible!!

Really good recipe as is.  Also adaptable to taste.  I kept the raw meat and veggies separate.  Use what ever veggies you have and like.  I let the kiddos choose their own kabobs items.  Great way to get them to eat their veggies.  Thanks for the post!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if possible it was that good!  I doubled the marinade to be sure that I had plenty to cover all of my chicken and let it marinade for about 4 hours.  I also left off the mushrooms and instead put green peppers, red onions, and fresh pineapple on the skewers.    I used the advice of another reviewer and boiled my bacon strips 5 minutes and that was a great tip - it took some of the fat out of the bacon and made it so the bacon didn't burn or char while on the grill.  I basted the kabobs while grilling with the marinade and near the end sprinkled them with brown sugar.  DELICIOUS!  Definitely a grilling favorite for my family!

This was excellent! I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy and it had a great flavor. Use a good quality thick cut bacon and you will have no fires/flare ups. I cannot stop thinking about how delicious this was! Thanks for a great recipe

I didn't change a thing - well, almost - I did use olive oil.  Anyway, it was GREAT!  Really, this is easy, yummy, and very flavorful.  I accidentally poured out the marinade so I was not able to baste the kabobs as they cooked, but that didn't matter much.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks! =)

Marinade was competant, but not distinctly better than many others I've tried...seems like all the marinades are more or less the same.

Bacon wrapped around chicken was yummy!  As you might imagine, the bacon wrapper kept the chicken very moist.  The pinapple and mushrooms with this were a nice compliment.  We added red onions and peppers to the skewers.  

I'd definitely make these again...loved the pinapple and bacon/chicken part the best...next time I'll add more pinapple (personal preference)

My family loves these kabobs! The only thing I do a little different is par cook the bacon in the oven. This makes the bacon crisp very nicely. Enjoy!

This was fantastic! In my marinade I added 2 cloves of garlic and a ½ cup each of pineapple juice and mango juice to the original recipe. I also used regular instead of thick cut bacon and it cooked up nice and crisp with no pre-cooking. Very delicious! Will make this again and again.

This is our go to summer recipe! We do this with shrimp as well, but we precook the bacon in the microwave for about 2-3 minutes. (Place bacon in a single layer between 5 sheets of paper towels on both sides.)  We've also just marinated whole chicken breasts and shrimp, and sandwiched the meat between the bacon and placed in a grill basket.  When prepared this way we grill the mushrooms seperately.  This is so good served w/ a rice pilaf and "That Good Salad" from this site.

Incredible! Women: There is something about grilling foods that makes men so adoring. I have five sons and a husband and the only things I heard all evening (from oldest to youngest) were, "This is the best meal I've ever had!"; "This is awesome!"; "Wow, mom. I really love you." And there is something about those pointed little sticks that seems to make the whole thing extra special. You can change this recipe up with whatever you have on hand and make it "yours"- I added rum, used brown sugar instead of honey, and added some dry mesquite seasoning used for grilling. I also added potatoe chunks (microwaved for 15 minutes with a little water) to the skewer and marinated and basted the potatoes and the mushrooms with Kraft Bacon Caesar dressing instead of the first marinade. I will probably use thinner bacon the next time. Try this recipe- you won't be disappointed!

Great combination of flavors.  Did mine on my Foreman-type grill, closed.  Next time I will try fresh pineapple in larger chunks.  I served this with asparagus cashew rice pilaf from this site.

Killer summertime recipe. I have used this marinade on shrimp and veggie kabobs since and it always is wonderful. I used fresh pineapple here so chuncks were bigger and tastier. I too separated mushrooms  from the chicken for marinading and doubled the marinade to set aside for dipping. Try pepper crusted thick bacon wrapped around slightly larger chicken chunks. Great recipe Angie-- you can substitute chicken for prawns and is too good!

I doubled the marinade and put the chicken and the mushrooms in separate bowls like others suggested.  I also added green peppers to the skewers.  My husband and I ran out of bacon, so we just grilled the remaining chicken without bacon wrapped around it.  We ended up liking the chicken without the bacon better because the bacon either took to long to cook or got burned.  The taste of the marinade is fantastic though, I definately recommend using it, but just skip the bacon part, it's not worth the effort!

The family goobled them up! This is the first time I've made kababs on the grill, the only problem I ran into was turning them over. the tend to stick to the grill/cage and they pull apart when turned. I'm going to invest in a special grate for the grill so I can just flip the grate/cage next time.

Delicious! i made this for my dad for his birthday. He loved it. i marinaded this over night and used thin bacon. i also put steak in the marinade (separate container from the chicken) and made steak kabobs and chicken kabobs. I highly recommend this. I forgot to put the pineapple on the skewer though.....

I made these for Mother's Day & everyone LOVED them! I marinated the meat for about 5 hours and they were very juicy and tender! I served them on a bed of yellow rice and with grilled onions, zuccuni & squash...yummy!

Because I am a professional AND a single mother, here are my recommendations: 1. One: Cut the chicken pieces kind of small and don't wrap too much bacon 'round them. 2. Two: If you're grilling these remember that the bacon grease will drip onto the hot hot coals and cause mega flare-ups. 3. Three: Don't overload your skewers. I made a lot of these (like 30 skewers) and didn't anticipate how much food it would be. Don't let the kabobs fool you.

I loved it! it was great,I did a few things different,I didn't have mushrooms,don't like them anyway so I used a green bell pepper and didn't have any honey for the sauce but who missed it? and I didn't have pineapple. You know,anything would work well with this recipe,chunks of onion,other bell peppers,most anything. I bet the next person who reviews on this will love it.

This was a big hit with us and our firends.  The chicken is very tender, the only thing I will do next time is have the meat on one kabob (with the marinated mushrooms) and do the vegtables on a seperate kabob as the veggie and meat cook at quite different rates. Veggie used was, red, yellow & oragne peppers, purple onion, zucchini, cherry tomatoes. Looked GREAT.

These were wonderful!  This is now our families favorite marinade for kabobs.  I followed the recipe just as stated except I left out the green onion only because my husband does not care for that flavor.  I used maple curried bacon to add a little sweetness to the chicken and it was a big hit!

This was absolutely wonderful. I wanted to follow the recipe exactly, but thought I had honey, but didn't. So, as one reviewer suggested brown sugar, I used 2 TBLS and I added one large clove of minced garlic, but I do that for just about any thing I marinate. Husband grilled them to perfection. The mushrooms were even outstanding, as I am not a mushroom fan. Thanks for the recipe, definite keeper.

Excellent flavor - meat needs to be marinated overnight to get the full flavor.  I kept the meat in the marinade for 4 hours and it was far too "bland".  I broiled the kabobs and they didn't smoke like other said they did.  They turned out perfectly at about 7 minutes on either side.

I make this recipe everytime my family comes into town--they LOVE it!  I add additional veggies for my sister-in-law the vegetarian, and I always add onions.  I've found keeping the meat and veggies on seperate skewers helps in grilling, as the meat takes longer to cook.  Put the meat on a few minutes before the veggies and then everything gets done at the same time.  Get a sweet Riesling to pair with this and enjoy!

Absolutely delicious!!!!  I made these for dinner and the only reason the recipe does not get 5 stars is because the recipe calls for canned pineapple; if fresh were used, it would be 5 stars hands down.  The only change I made to the marinade was to add 2 large cloves of garlic and I marinated the chicken/mushrooms for about 8 hours, but overnight would be better.  I did follow the advice of another reviewer and used regular bacon (as opposed to thick-cut) and I boiled it for 5 minutes first.  I then cut each slice into thirds and wrapped my chicken with it.  This was so good...we can't wait to have it again.

Wow.  Huge success.  HUGE.  Made these to bring to a 4th OF July Picnic.  I marinated the chicken the night before, and did the veggies separately that morning so that I could baste with the marinade (and we all know not to use the meat marinade, so this made sense).  Everyone ranted and raved and the hostess plans on making them again - tomorrow!  The baste did seem to make a difference, so it's a good idea to make up two separate ziploc bags - one for meat and one for vegetables.

A definite keeper and constant repeat!

These were phenominal! I add extra honey to the marinade, and drizzle more honey onto the kabobs before cooking. Also used regular bacon as suggested by other reviewers. Have made these several times and they always turn out great, thanks for this amazing recipe!

A M A Z I N G!!!!! my husband was eating them off the grill before they even made it inside!

i had all of the ingredience on hand except for the bacon - and i didn't feel like making a trip to the store.  so, i just made them w/o the bacon - and they were WONDERFUL!  fresh pineapple is a MUST.  i also marinated the chicken for all afternoon!  can't wait to try them next time with the bacon!

*****EDIT***** made them with regular bacon this time.  found the veggies to cook a lot faster than the chicken/bacon - to the point where most of the veggies charred.  Next time i will skewer the meat/veggies on diff. skewers - and pre cook the bacon for a few min before wrapping the chicken.

These were AWESOME!   I made as is, simply adding minced garlic to marinade.  I also did NOT marinade mushrooms w/the chicken, simply because I wasn't comfortable having raw meat w/the mushrooms...is that safe?  I also added green peppers and onions to the kabobs.  I used Oscar Meyer center cut bacon and DID NOT do anything to it beforehand.  I WILL be making these again w/no changes.  Excellent recipe...I can't wait til lunch tomorrow!!  I think I was able to marinate the meat for about 90 minutes before making the kabobs (which is a little time consuming....or maybe I just waited until the last minute and it seemed to take forever).

This recipe left me speechless!  Amazing flavor, juicy, perfect blend... WOW - you nailed this one!  We put the grill on M/H (if not they would have burned.  Also, I used portabello mushrooms & tossed chunks of fresh red bell pepper as well.  Please do yourself a favor and make this recipe!!

Have been making this for 5 years now- it's amazing!  I add the juice from the pineapple can into the marinade as well...helps to tenderize the chicken.  I cook on a sheet of foil on the BBQ to save the flare-ups from the dripping bacon.

Made this for a Father's Day barbeque and it was a big hit with my dad and hubby. We added red onion chunks on the skewers. My husband said he couldn't really taste much flavor in the chicken, even though we marinaded for 3+ hours, but loved the bacon wrap. One important note: leave a little room around the chicken pieces on the skewers. The areas that were bumped right up against other items had bacon that didn't get cooked. I used regular bacon, not thick cut, and boiled it for a few minutes first, per another reviewer.

OMG was this so good!  I had a small bulb of garlic so I mined 3 cloves and added it to the marinade.  I marinaded the chicken for 3 hours.  

Because it is winter in Wisconsin (10 degrees outside!) I closed up the chicken and bacon with a toothpick and grilled them on my grill pan on the stove.  DH was so happy that I found this recipe and we can't wait for it to warm up a little so we can have the charcoal flavor!

i had a meat skewer and a vegetable skewer as well, which worked out great--each was able to cook just the right amount of time. we found that parts of the bacon that weren't exposed to the flame really didn't cook much at all, so next time i'm going to pan fry the bacon for a few minutes before wrapping the chicken to be on the safe side

I have made this many times. AND LOVE IT!!! Never a complaint, only requests for more. Suggestion would be to cook the pineapple and mushrooms on their own skewer. They take less time than the chicken.

The first time I made this recipe we didn't think the bacon was completely cooked, when the rest of the kabob was done.  I tried it the second time, with this variation:  On a rack, in the oven, I partially cooked the bacon, drained it then proceeded with the recipe, as directed. We were much more satisfied.  Next winter we will be broiling this in the oven.

Such a great recipe.  I made this for my fiance's birthday dinner and he LOVED it.  The only change I made was to skip the green onions.  Instead I marinated thick slice red onions and used them on the kabobs.  Also, I made a second batch of the sauce and marinated shrimp so I could have both shrimp and chicken on the kabobs.  I ran out of bacon at then end b/c I had so much chicken and had to thread it on the kabobs alone and it was still SO good.  I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again...and again...and again...

These were sweet!  I added about 1/2 tsp of minced garlic to the marinade instead of the green onions.  I opted out of the pineapple chunks and instead skewered pieces of red pepper and vidalia onion along with the chicken and mushrooms- deelish!  A nice meal when you've got a bit of extra time for skewering etc.  We really enjoyed the marinade- very flavourful.  Will likely make these again.

I doubled the marinade, half for the chicken and the other half for the vegetables.  I added a crushed clove of garlic for some extra flavor.  The only change I will make next time will be the addition of a few more vegetables.  Great recipe!

This is a excellent recipe. I tripled it for my son's birthday party, and there wasn't a one leftover:)
I added red onion & green pepper to the skewers too.
These kabobs are requested every time there's party now.
Yummy!

This is an excellent kabob recipe. The chicken tasted wonderful with the pineapple and was very moist. I put cherry tomatoes on the kabobs and it wasn't a good idea. Most of them disintegrated before the chicken was done.

Absolutely delicious.  I actually used this as a camping recipe and pre-marinaded to chicken and then skewered it all just before placing on the campfire atop a portable grill.  Very easy and highly flavorful recipe.  Thx.

OMG!  This is by far the best kabob recipe ever!  The marinade flavors the chicken and mushrooms perfectly, and the bacon keeps the chicken moist and tender.  I made this with the addition of red peppers and vidalia onions and it was awesome. What doesn't taste better with bacon?  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

Fantastic recipe! Everyone loves it.  Easy to make and alter for special diets.  We double the recipe and substitute 1 lb of chicken for shrimp.  We always use fresh pineapple and maple smoked bacon (regular cut, not thick. It cooks better).  Everyone loves the maple flavor with the chicken!

this was great!! Only change I did was add garlic (like some suggested) and a little fresh ginger.I don't eat pork so we didn't do the bacon thing.Besides the chicken we marinated scallops. Everything was awesome and well liked by my whole family.THANKS

Wow!!  These are unbelievably delicious.  I've made them a few times now and have learned one very important thing.  Marinate them overnight.  The first time I made them the flavor was good but very weak.  I made them again and marinated the chicken overnight, then skewered and barbecued them the next day.  My parents, my husband and I as well as our two toddlers couldn't get enough.  Thank you for the wonderful and incredibly simple recipe.

Putting bacon on the chicken kabobs is the best idea!! I had a cookout, and everybody loved them. I had already gone shopping so I used a store bought marinade on the chicken, and the bacon I used was thick cut, zesty-peppercorn bacon, rotated with red and green bell peppers and fresh pineapple. Very good!!!

The only exception I made to the recipe is that I used turkey bacon. The chicken and mushrooms were very tender and juicy. Nice flavor overall but next time I think I will add a clove or two of garlic to the marinade. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were great!  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  Hubby started to worry that they would burn while cooking, but he quickly found that the key was constantly turning them on the grill until the bacon had cooked off some of its greasiness.  Next time we are adding some red pepper. Delicious!

these kebobs recieved excellent reviews at a kickball game with friends. The marinade itself is quite easy to prepare (4 ingredients), and gives the chicken almost a buttery flavor when wrapped and cooked with the bacon. i soaked the chicken, as frozen tenderloins, overnight in two separate ziploc bags in the refrigerator. Then about 1-2 hours prior to cooktime, i dumped cherry tomatoes, chopped zucchini, and chopped squash right into the ziploc bags with the marinading chicken. i cut the tenderloins into smaller pieces, wrapped them in bacon, skewed the vegetables on there and had a blast bbqing them up. 
This is one of the tastiest bbq's i've prepared in a LONG time and can't wait to do this again, maybe while camping.

Great recipe! What an interesting change from the same old grilling entrees...
One note: Cut the chicken into good size chunks, otherwise you won't have enough bacon to wrap them...This is a winner!

I was a little disappointed in this, considering the amount of time it took to assemble.  The flavor wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  I broiled it instead of grilling, maybe that's what made the difference.

I think it is safer to marinate meat & mushrooms seperatly.This is a great recipe and is easy to prepare.we loved it. Save sauce to baste with if grilling ,mushrooms can blacken quickly.GREAT_GREAT YUM_YUM

These were great.  Though next time I'll probably just marinate them in teriyaki sauce.  We also added red peppers to the skewers.  SO yummy!!  And really good the next day too.  Thanks for posting it.

They didn't look exactly like the picture because the recipe didn't call for pieces of peppers, which we happily would have added. The prep time also took a little bit longer than listed and I had my husband help so I could wrap and skewer while he worked on the reduction. Overall a great recipe though and we are saving it to use again for the future.

This recipe is AMAZING. Everyone loved it and, even made the mom in law jealous ;). I made 3 batches of marinade. 2 for 6 chicken breasts and the last one all for the mushrooms. I did boil the bacon like others said and it was perfect. I skewered chicken and veggies separate. I cut up different color peppers, and onions to go with the mushrooms and pineapple. I marinated the mushrooms for about an hour or 2 before and the chicken for a whole day. Wouldn't change a thing ! Can't wait to have guests over again to do this. I might try this with whole chicken breasts to have with rice. SUPER RECOMMEND! (UPDATE 5/5/2014 - I have now used this recipe countless times. With regular chicken breasts, turkey breasts, even tilapia. This is my go-to recipe when I need something done quick. It's always flavorful and moist every time - Today I plan to marinate just onions and mushrooms to put on top of turkey burgers).

Followed basic instructions, changed veggies up a little, added  some, used cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, pineapple and marineted the chicken and mushrooms together over night, made this a few times and it's always a show stopper!  Bad to the bone!

The mushrooms are the most delicious part!! My husband and I both agreed that these were probably the best mushrooms we've had. We marinated the mushrooms and chicken together overnight and followed the recipes exactly as written for the marinade.  Put them on skewers and grilled them. The chicken was really good too!

I added onion and marinated them separately with the mushrooms.  I also used reg bacon so it would cook faster.  It was excellent.  Wish I could find bigger chunks of pineapple.  May use fresh next time so I can cut to size.  Great recipe

Poor, great idea, bacon was flaming so it was a nightmare to BBQ and pretty bland... I must eat a lot of spicy food because it was bland.

This was delicious! I took advice from previous reviews and doubled the marinate and did the chicken and mushrooms separately.  I also grilled the meat separate from the veggies.  I added grape tomatoes, pepper and onion in addition to the pineapple and mushrooms.  Served with a side of brown rice. So yummy!

I followed this recipe exactly except to use thin cut bacon because that's what I had on hand.  I also put the pineapple and mushrooms on separate skewers (and added yellow bell pepper).  It was very good but took much longer to cook than 20 min. On high heat the bacon fat kept causing flare ups so they had to be cooked on med-low and took closer to 35 minutes for the bacon to fully cook.  I will definitely make these again but next time I will boil the bacon for 5 minutes first as another reviewer suggested. Thanks for the terrific recipe!

This was actually really good and it has such a pretty presentation. Only change i did was omit the mushrooms and green onions because i did not have any on hand. I added 1 clove crushed garlic and a 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, which gave a nice little kick!

These were a huge hit.  I made them while we were camping.  I added red and green bell peppers to give it more color and veggies.  I doubled the marinade so I would have enough for the extra veggies.  Everyone asked for the recipe.

Let me just say "WOW!". These are delicious!!! They were hit at our Sunday bbq. We will definitely be making these again. Next time I may add a few jalapeno slices to the skewers because we like some heat and I think they will work with these flavors wonderfully. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

These were very good. They bacon got beautifully crispy and the chicken had a good flavor just straight (I had a little left over).

We used green bell peppers and cherry tomatoes on our skewers and left off the green onions.  They were really good.  It would have helped if we had precooked the bacon because a few of the bacon pieces didn't get cooked all the way through.  We will definitely be making this recipe again.  It was fairly fast and easy!

One word - YUM!  Anything wrapped in bacon can't be all that bad!  I separted the veggies from the meat, but followed the recipe otherwise.  Little time to prep it all, but totally worth it.  Served with the Brown Rice recipe from this site (the one with French Onion Soup) and grilled corn on the cob.  Wonderful dinner!

So tasty! I followed the recipe exactly as written, with the addition of cherry tomatoes. I also used fresh pineapple instead of the canned stuff and I really think that made a difference. I grilled them on the gas grill on high at first but they started burning so I turned it on low and closed the lid to allow them to bake. 20 minutes later and our mouths were salivating! The bacon and pineapple are the stars of this meal!! Goodness gracious. We were in shish kabob heaven.

The family loved the bacon wrapped around the chicken.  Flavors were alright too.  I liked that the marinate time was short too but maybe next time I'll try 3-4 hours instead.  I used other veggies that I had on hand as well.

Loved them! I was skeptical about the pineapple and Hubby hates bacon on anything, but let me tell you that I wished I had used more pineapple and Hubby, (who balked at the bacon at first), loved them! He said 5 stars without hesitation. I did add red onion and red & green pepper but wished I hadn't added the peppers and just used more pineapple. Thanks for the GREAT kabobs!

Delishes!  We loved this recipe.  When making the marinade I was a little worried it wouldn't taste good, but it was great!  I grill my kabobs for only 10 minutes.  They are fully cooked and juicy that way.

WONDERFUL!  The bacon does a great job at keeping the chicken moist.  We use center cut and it was absolute melt in your mouth good.  I wouldn't change a thing with ingredients but next time we're going to separate the chicken from the pineapple & mushrooms and splite the marinade in half.  That way we can use the veggie/fruit marinade as a baste/glaze without boiling it first.  FIVE star, for sure!!!

These were awesome!!! I nixed the mushrooms as no one in my family is a fan of them. I marinated them an hour and they were awesome, I may try longer next time but I wont stress doing that since they were so flavorful. I did have a bit of a problem with the bacon burning on the grill so I popped them into the broiler to crisp them up ( I will try boiling the bacon first as others suggested). I did cut the bacon into thirds since I chopped my chicken chunks a bit to small. I love love love the grilled pineapple and how the juice gave just a hint of flavor on the bacon! I will make this again and again. I cant wait to take these to work potlucks and wow them!

We thought this was tasty, but not great.  We probably won't make it again.  We made it exactly as written, and as other reviewers have noted, we had trouble getting the bacon crispy.  We also didn't find the chicken all that flavorful, even though marinated for 7 hours.  Also, 15-20 minutes is far too long to cook these.  We cooked them for about 10, and that was plenty.

I skipped the green onions and pineapple, as I'm not a big fan.  These kabobs were still fantastic!!  I also wrapped some steak with the bacon and the taste was incredible.  All of my guests were very impressed, so thanks for a great recipe!

For taste this is 5 stars, we really enjoyed  them.  It did seem very labor intense, between skewering them, and then grilling them slowly, so you don't have burnt kabobs. I followed the marinade recipe exactly, I think garlic would be a nice addition to it.  I will definately make these again.

What a hit this recipe was at my Father's Day BBQ.  The marinade for this recipe is great! I used half soy sauce and half teriyaki instead of the 1/4 C. soy. I did not marinate the mushrooms because I was afraid of chicken bacteria.  The thick cut bacon was not very crispy.  I probably would omit bacon all together next time.

Delicious!  I served with company and was thrilled with the results ... and it looked really pretty.  I used fresh pineapple as I'm not a big fan of canned fruit.  Also, I marinated for about 3 hours, but next time wouldn't do that long.  I felt it was a bit mushy.  I would just do the recommended hour because the chicken had no trouble picking up the marinade flavor.

I had planned on making this for Father's Day, but after marinading just the chicken in the morning and letting it set all day in the fridge, we decided it was just too hot to bbq that evening. We thought we'd make it for dinner then the next night, but again, it was too hot. I didn't want the chicken to go bad, so I cut the bacon slices into 4ths & fried it up (the whole 1# pkg.) and began sauteeing the the chicken mixture in a huge skillet. After the chicken was no longer pink, I added the vegetables which I'd only marinaded in a separate bowl 1 hr before starting dinner. (I followed others' advice and changed the pineapple to a lg can, tripled the mushrooms, and added cherry tomatoes.) Toward the end of the cooking, I added the bacon and stirred it together.  I served this over sticky white rice.  I'm definitely adding this to my personal recipe book and calling it "Stir Fried Shish Kabobs".

My family really liked this.  I only had a couple of problems. Half a pound of bacon is not enough.  And an 8oz. can of Pineapple chunks isn't enough.  I would suggest 1 pound of bacon and maybe 2, 8oz cans of pineapple.  And a few more mushrooms would have been good also.

Delicious and easy to make - I used fresh sliced pinneapple that you can find in your produce section of the supermarket or vegetable store - it really is so much better than canned. I added green peppers and chunks of yellow onion.  Also used regular sliced bacon and it worked perfectly and kept the chicken moist - cooked it in the broiler for 8 min. on each side.  I did find that there was way too much sauce - I will halve it the next time.  I had so much extra that I marinated my pork chops in the excess sauce overnight and grilled them for dinner the next nite.

This was my first attempt at shish kabobs and this  recipe was awesome. I did what other recommended and seperated the mushrooms from the chicken ( was a little worried about cross contamination) the marinade was so delicious I used red wine just cuz that is what I had on hand and it made a wonderful flavor I couldn't  quit eating the mushroom marinade ! The whole family loved it thanks for the great recipe ! Sonya

I made just as the recipe goes, minus the mushrooms. As I was eating it I found myself wishing I had seasoned the chicken with dry seasoning because it didn't have much taste. I think the marinade cancelled out the bacon too, just tasted like chicken. Figured maybe my taste buds were off, I mean I marinated it for 3 hours. The neighbor wanted to try it and after her first bite asked if I had even seasoned them. Just disappointing for marinade.

Boy! I don't find this recipe a winner. I made it per directions, but added a crushed gaarlic also. Chicken & mushrooms marinated for 5 hrs.  Next time, I will make a marinate of the soy suce, and some worchesthire sauce, also will add the remainder of the pineapple juice, assumming you use canned pineapple.  Bandra Mandral had a segment, years ago, on traveling in her tour bus.  She made a marinade and added "some" worchesthire sauce for a little kick.  She made the comment you could use "inexpensive" beef.  I am going to incorparate her directions with the bacon, and add whatever vegatables I have on hand and try that.  She made her kabobs up first and then marinated them, completely, turning them everry 30+ minutes, or whenver you go by frridg.  .

These were really great and a different type of meal for us, and we didn't even have to break out the big grill!! I used our classic plate George Foreman Grill which also cut out alot of the fat from the oil used to marinate the ingredients in (even though canola oil is a good type of oil, oh but you have to clean the Foreman grill while hot because of the honey used in the recipe. I marinated the ingredients for about 6 hours. I didn't use any mushrooms since I didn't have any on hand, I used onions and sweet peppers which I placed in the marinade 30 minutes before grilling so they would be soft and mushy. Only reason I didn't give this a 5-star rating is because the soy sauce was almost over-powering everything else so next time I will use a low sodium soy sauce or a less measurement than given.

This recipe is unbelievable! I am not a griller by any stretch of the imagination, but this recipe made me look like a grilling rock star! I did as others suggested and marinated for 24 hours and doubled the sauce, and it worked out PERFECT for me! I will be making this a lot more in the future!

Amazing!!!!!  I never knew mushrooms could taste so good.  The marinade was very flavorful and the bacon hit the spot.  I skipped the onions because I don't like them and used regular bacon for cost reasons.  I also used fresh pineapple.  I'd make it exactly the same next time!  Thanks for the recipe!  This will for sure be added into my summer grilling rotation!!!!!

My family is pretty picky about most things.  I made the marinade, letting the chicken sit for about 2 hours, and then after skewering the chicken, wrapped each skewer in bacon.  The flavor of the chicken is awesome and has quickly become a favorite in our house, with the kids asking for this over and over again.  Yum!

This was really good but took alot of time to construct and cook on the small grill pan. I added red peppers and yellow onion to the kabobs.

My family really loved this recipe. I doubled the marinade amount to be sure I had enough and eliminated the pineapple (personal taste) while adding onions and bell peppers. It was great.

Almost perfect- I forgot the vinegar, but it turned out great! I used fresh pineapple and I used whole mushrooms (small) marinate in the morning and let everything but the pineapple soak up the tasty juice.

Was very good but like some of the other reviewers had trouble getting the bacon to cook.  I think next time I will either skip it all together - just too difficult to have it crisp up without burning the veggies.  I added cherry tomatoes, green peppers and pineapple and it was tasty.  Bit long on the prep time but worth it.

Excellent.  I used chicken tenderloins.  Since I was doing shrimp and steak kabobs too, along with veggies, I did not use the bacon although I am sure it too would have been awesome.  The marinade was great.  I brushed some of the reduced marinade onto the cooking veggies (on separate skewers).  This recipe has been saved.

I followed the marinade instructions plus added 1/4 cup of white cooking wine.  I also did not use the bacon to cut back on fat.  I used beef cubes, shrimp marinated in lemon garlic juice, chicken, green bell peppers, baby potatoes, mushrooms, onions, and pineapple.  I did not use the marinade listed on the onion, pineapple, or shrimp.  It was fabulous on the rest of the meat and veggies.  My husband said this was the best grilled meal he has ever eaten.  Thank you for the yummy, easy recipe!

we made these last night and I have to say...absolutely fabulous.  I wasn't too certain about the combination, but it worked, and worked perfectly.  The chicken was tender and moist, due in part I think to it having bacon wrapped around it, the mushrooms added a nice flavor/texture contrast and the pineapple added just the right amount of sweet.  We all decided that this is going to be a summer time staple.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, followed it exactly as written and thought it was perfect....when you try these, don't change a thing!

Wow, were these good.  Made them for a dinner party and they were a huge hit.  Marinated the mushrooms separately and grilled the mushrooms and fresh pineapple separately from the meat.  The chicken was yummy and juicy.  Will make this again and again!

Very good and simple to make.  I doubled the recipe since I have two grown men in the house with big appetites and there was barely any leftover for my lunch today :(  I grilled some of the chicken without the bacon (I ran out of bacon) and that allowed the flavors of the marinade to come out nicely, but with the bacon is still so much better!  I also added grape tomatoes, onion, and green bell pepper to the skewers and even when my husband charred a few of the skewers on the grill, they were still pretty yummy!  Definitely gonna give this one a try again!

We had friends over for dinner and this was a huge hit! My husband liked it but prefers a more savory marinard than the sweet. I agree with a previous reviewer about using regular sliced bacon. The bacon was not nearly cooked enough for my likely. Will most likley be using this recipe again as of the dishes at my son's first birthday party bbq.

Excellent recipe.  Beginner cook.  Followed suggestions to double the marinade.  Grilled meat and veggies separately.  Everything was perfect. Also used with filet mignon.  Everyone raved at the dinner party.  Will make again and again.

The marinade is the key...these are absolutely delicious.  I cooked them on wooden skewers, which takes awhile to put together, but totally worth the effort.  They look amazing and taste wonderful.

These were incredible. I also found it helpful to boil the bacon for a few minutes. This is my new shish kabob recipe.

Who woulda' thunk......... Chicken & Pork? Is the farmlands rendition of Surf 'n Turf? I say Heck Yeah, Y'all!  Even my picky 5 year old liked it. Delicious flavor and the bacon keeps the chicken moist, and who doesn't love grilled veggies? Then only way to get 5 a day. A Must Have in your recipe box

Awesome! I used zucchini instead of the mushrooms cause it was what I had on hand, but it turned out great. I will be making this for my husbands welcome home meal (he's coming home from Iraq in a few weeks).  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought these were very good. I grilled on the top rack and slower- but until the bacon was a little burned (i love burnt bacon), and the flavor was really good!

excellent.  Very flavorful & easy to make.  The large mushrooms needed to be cut into 4 chunks.  Marinated the chicken/mushrooms overnight.  Turned out really good!

I made this for my family over the Fourth of July. The bacon wrapped chicken was a huge hit and I will do it again. However, I personally didn't find the marinade as good as others on this site. Next time I will wrap the chicken and use a recipe on the AR that I think is called Yummy Honey Chicken kabobs. Veggie wise I added tomatoes, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, and pineapple.

This marinade was incredible! I made seperate skewers for the veggies.  I also tried just chicken breast with this marinade.  It is now my standard go to recipe when grilling chicken.  Hmmmm, wonder how this would taste on salmon... I'm not off to see what else I can use the cider vinegar for. I bought it for just this recipe and it was worth it!

I like to try out a recipe in advance of serving it to company.  I am not a big fan of chicken, and I refuse to eat mushrooms, but my husband likes both.  Boy, did these Kabobs turn out wonderful!  I even ate them, except for the mushrooms.  The chicken was so moist.  The bacon really makes a difference.  The only thing I did differently was to use fresh pineapple instead of canned.  I also added bell pepper to the skewers.  It looks like the picture shows onions and peppers, but the recipe didn't call for them.  I did them under the broiler until the bacon was brown, then based them, turned the oven off, and let them bake for an additional 10 minutes.  Served it with dirty rice.  Yum!!

I was not as impressed as I thought I was going to be with this recipe based on the great reviews it has received. I don't think I will be making it again. The flavor was just ok. I marinated the veggies and meat overnite. I'm not sure what it was about the flavor that I didn't really like, perhaps the applecider vinegar. It was a bit too tart/bitter/sour for my liking. Nevertheless, I do like the idea of wrapping chicken in bacon and then grilling. I think I may try that again with a different marinade. Lastly, great idea to boil the bacon for a few minutes first before putting it on the scewers.

This is a very, very good marinade. We had a big crowd for Sunday dinner so I more than doubled the Chicken/Veggies and then doubled the marinade needed for that (so I guess 4X the marinade) and it was the right amount.  Put Chicken in one Ziploc and Mushrooms, Red, Yellow and Orange Peppers in another and marinated all for about 5 hours. I pre-cooked the bacon for just a few minutes before wrapping due to other reviews about even doneness and it worked out perfect. Also, only wrapped half with bacon and both tasted great. Used the marinade from the vegetable to baste. We always cook vegetables in a basket on the grill. Left out the Pineapple. Everyone loved it. We will use it again. Thanks for sharing!

FANTASTIC! This is one of our favorite grilled chicken recipes!  I like to add peppers and onions too.  GR8! Thank you :)  PS ~ I microwave the bacon for about 1-2 minutes before wrapping the chicken.  Cooks up just right.

This were great!  I pre-cooked the bacon a bit.  Also, I noticed a lot of reviewers were complaining the bacon was undercooked.  A way to fix that is not to push the ingredients on tight, ie leave a tiny bit of space inbetween.

This was a nice change from the everyday dinners, and even the kids liked it. We did leave the mushrooms out, pre-cooked the bacon a bit. Made it easier to wrap around the chicken.

I made this for company this evening and everyone raved how delicious and moist the chicken was and what a great flavor the bacon added!  Along with the pineapple and mushrooms, I added some red pepper and red onion chunks.  I also let the chicken and mushrooms marinate all day and I doubled the marinade as well.  I put it all together before the guests arrived.  Will definitely be a keeper!

I made this with boneless pork chops instead of chicken because that's what I had on hand.  Also, I used yellow and red bell peppers and red onion as my vegetables (again, that's what I had in the fridge.)  My family LOVED it!  The marinade is delicious and the bacon really adds to the flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe - I will be making this again very soon!

This is great!! My first time Shish Kabob. I tripled recipe and half of marinade sauce for basting. Also I used Green Pepper and Onion to go with it. All my friends loved it and nothing left. This was hit!! I'll definitely make again.

Delicious!  I only had time to marinade them for an hour before grilling and they tasted great.  I can't wait to try them again after marinating them longer.  I used fresh pineapple and regular bacon and they were perfect.  Made the recipe exactly as it directed and me and my honey loved them.  The chicken was tender and juicy, the bacon slightly crispy, and the flavor... Oh my.  A must try recipe.  Thank you Angie.

Fan-freaking-tastic!  This is a great teriyaki-style marinade.  We also grilled the veggies separately and doubled the marinade, reserving a few tablespoons for brushing over the meat after it came off the grill.  We added some garlic & ginger powders as well.  The only change I'd make is to marinate the chicken for 3 or so hours.

Pretty good recipe. The chicken was tender, and had added flavor from the bacon. The bacon does tend to burn a little but it is still an added bonus. I love how the pineapple and mushrooms add to the dish also. Overall Recommend.

I adjusted this recipe to the ingredients I had on hand. I kept the marinade the same and used Chicken wrapped in bacon, strawberries, onions & pinapple. I marinated these over night and have to say they were the BEST kabobs we've ever had. Suggestion... when cooking them on the grill only cook on the top rack till they are almost done then put them on the bottom rack to crisp up the bacon. Will absolutely make these again!

Served this to 5 adults and 5 children and everyone agreed that it was "awesome".  The bacon keeps the chicken so moist, and the marinade was delish.  I also used regular bacon and not thick, and did add some crushed garlic to the marinade.  I was so tempted to doctor the marinade up more with ginger and spices, but refrained and I am so glad I did.  It was really delicious as it was.  I also did add red, yellow, and green peppers as well as yellow onion to the skewers for additional color and flavor.  Although this recipe was super easy, don't think that this is a quick throw together--it really takes some time to wrap the chicken and thread all of the veggies on the skewers.  Admittedly, I tripled the recipe for my big eaters, but it did take a solid half hour of skewering to get them grill ready.  Overall, fantastic recipe!  Thanks!

This was amazing!  I did the maridnade exactly as per the recipe, but made some of the kebabs with pickled jalepeno slices as another member suggested and it gave it such a beautiful kick.  By themselves, they were fantastic though - the marinade was delicious even though it was really simple.  But sooooo good.  I also used normal sliced bacon instead of thick - I think thick would have been too much - this was perfect.  I also skipped the pineapple and just used red bell pepper with some of the kebabs with jalepeno and some without and it was amazing.  Served it over a bed of rice pilaf and I was the hit of the night.  My husband said it was the best meal I'd made in a long time!  This is going to become a regular in my summer barbecue rotation!

Delicious! If I had the time, I probably would have marinated this longer because I sadly could barely taste the marinade. I made it on an indoor grill, and it still turned out really well! Also, I made it with turkey bacon, which still worked great.

This tasted exelent. Even my meat lover husband loved it. We used microwave bacon for all of you that said your bacon was limp. Also put green pepper on skewers. Will make again.

I have made these several times now.  Everyone loved them. I also did away with the Shish Kabobs and just marinaded chicken (thighs or breast) and cooked on the George Forman.  Turned out great.   I also have gone on a low carb diet, so I elimated the honey and used splendia brown sugar.  Turned out wonderful.  Will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks

These were soo good!  I didn't have canola oil so I used sesame oil.  My husband said I should have cut back on the amount since sesame oil is so flavored, but they came out great.  I also used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have regular. I marinated the chicken about 5 hours, and the veggies only about an hour (only because I had to go buy them!).  I would recommend using regular bacon because there is no need to pre-cook.  And I used the following veggies:  green pepper, white onion, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and of course pineapple.  I skewered the veggies separate from the meat since they cook for less time.  Delicious!

This was fantastic! The chicken was very moist and the bacon definitely added another layer of flavor. The first time I made this I added a quarter cup of the pineapple juice in the marinade, but left out scallions because I didn't have them. The second time I left out the pineapple juice but added finely chopped scallions. I must say, don't omit the scallions! It definitely puts a nice finishing touch on the kabobs. The pineapple juice I think just made it overly pineapple-ly. This recipe is awesome! I will make this over and over again!

Absolutely my new favorite!  Everyone from my husband, to my 4 picky boys, to the neighbor girls loved this dish!  I added a tsp of minced garlic as suggested by others and boiled my bacon before I wrapped the chicken.  I also kept half the marinade out (to prevent contamination) for basting during the grilling process.  I wish I could give more than 5 stars on this one!

My boyfriend is an excellent culinary chef and he just said "This is quite possibly the best meal I've ever had." He gives it an A++ we had another couple over for dinner and after making 12-15 and we ate every last one of them! The only suggestion I would make is to cut some more mushrooms for the chicken. I also added in green bell peppers and white onions like other members suggested! I have a feeling I will be making this on the regular for the rest of the summer!

very good, I see other cooks making kabobs & marinating raw meat w/veggies in the same bag, I wouldn't recommend this at all, if the bacon is an issue for past cooks using this recipe I would suggest using 'pre-cooked' ready to eat bacon, still flexible enough to wrap around chicken. good recipe.

I've made this twice, and it's been excellent both times.

My wife complained the first time that the bacon wasn't cooked enough for her taste.  This time we microwaved the bacon on a plate over paper towels before making the kabobs, and it came out perfect.

This is definitely on my list of favorites!

Very good- entire family enjoyed it.  I'll be making this again in the summer.  I found the amounts to be right on.  Perfect amount of marinade for the chx and mushrooms, and I literally skewered the last mushroom with the last piece of chx.  I followed the recipe exactly and then added crushed red pepper and garlic to the marinade.  The only changes I will make next time are to have more pineapple and mushrooms.  Even my super-carnivore husband wanted more.  I skewered them chx, mshrm, chx, pnapple, etc.  Next time I'll do chx, mshrm, pnapple, etc. and end up with more skewers.  Served with cilantro lime rice from this site.

Big hit camping!  Marinated everything overnight adding greenpeppers, sm onions and cherry tomatoes, did not use thick bacon, boiled bacon for 5 minutes, excellent suggestion.  
Put them together the following morning, and while others were busy setting up the campsite I was cooking these at the camp fire.  Was told the recipe was a keeper and wanted them on the menu for Mother's Day cookout. Might try pork tenderloin also.

This recipe is very very good. I marinated the chicken in the sauce for an hour, still very good. In the marinade I added a spoonful of garlic.

I cook the bacon on stove a bit first before wrapping it on the sticks.

These are tasty,tasty, tasty.  I have made several times, the only changes I make are to the veggies not the marinade.  I am not a fan of pineapple and so I use zucchini instead and marinade along with the chicken and mushrooms.  This last time I made them I used Oscar Meyer turkey bacon and it was the best I've ever made, the regular bacon drips a lot of fat into the grill causing it to flame up and char the veggies but I felt the leaner turkey bacon allowed everything to cook real well.  Also, as far as turkey bacon goes Oscar Meyer is the best I've found so far.

This is the BEST! I took advise of others, adding some garlic to marinade, and some pieces of bell pepper...my friends and family thought it was superb!
I served coconut rice with it and it made a complete meal! 1 cup jasmine rice, 2 cups coconut milk, 1 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp salt. This recipe is a keeper!

Maybe I didn't marinade long enough (about 5 hours), but I didn't think it had much flavor.  I would recommend slightly pre-cooking the bacon as I had a hard time with flare ups.  One person recommended garlic (which I did not do), but definitely add some more flavor to this.  The concept is great - the bacon, mushrooms, chicken and pineapple - but it definitely needs to be kicked up a few notches...

These kabobs were excellent!  I am always looking for new grilling recipes in the summer and this is a definate keeper.  Very easy to make and tastes incredible.  Anything wrapped in bacon is increbible.  We used thin sliced bacon and it was fine.  Highly recommend!!

These are absolutely delicious!  I noted that another reviewer used frozen fillets so I did the same thing.  I took frozen fillets, made the marinade, and threw them into the fridge for 24 hours.  The next day, I put them in a tupperware container, and then fixed separate ziplock baggies of mushrooms and cherry tomatos, and bought a jar of unsweetened pineapple.  I eliminated the onion since kids were going to be eating them, too.  I took everything to a cookout in the cooler, cut the chicken and bacon while there, and had the kids help thread the wooden skewers, and they had a blast.  (I skipped marinating the mushrooms because it was hot out and I wanted to get everything cooked asap.)  These got RAVE reviews from absolutely everyone in the crowd, and I tripled the recipe.  I also made these for myself and my husband twice before this.  We put green peppers on the sticks in addition to red onions, mushrooms, pineapple, and cherry tomato.  We also used the bacon, which I think is the real key to the great flavor aside from the charcoal (not gas grill) taste.  We used thick bacon, but it was not a problem getting done on the grill at all.  You will love this recipe-- great for kids and adults!

I made these for our Memorial Day cookout and they were absolutely wonderful.  Easy to prepare, quick to cook and makes a beautiful, eye-appealing meal.  Everyone at the cook-out loved them, including the kids.  I also used the thinner bacon as suggested in previous reviews.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe, it was fabulous!!!  I used boneless and skinless thighs instead of chicken breasts because I find them to be more moist, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  We loved it. I brought them to a BBQ and didn't bring any back.

Super good!  My only suggestion is to put the veggies on a different skewer than the meat- the bacon took quite a while (~35 to 45 minutes on a charcoal grill).

This recipe got rave reviews from everyone at the dinner party. The chicken had great flavor and I loved the grilled pineapple. I even used the leftover chicken in a salad the next day and it was fantastic there too.

Okay, I personally didn't like them.  My guests loved them.  It was a very easy recipe to make.

OK, I'm really not a bad cook, but I royally screwed this one up!! No where in the recipe does it say anything about cooking the bacon first. I should have, because after all the work of chopping, marinating, skewering, and putting on the grill, they all caught on fire from the bacon grease and burned to a crisp!! I will not try this one again without cooking the bacon slightly first. I was surprised after reading all the reviews only one other person seemed to have this problem!! Beware of grease fires!

My wife raved about this recipe!  I cooked brown rice while grilling.  I skipped the oil in the marinade, and used chunks of cut up white onions instead of green onions.  I tried the pineapple chunks, but they didn't work well on the grill, so I made a brand new batch of the marinade mixture, put the pineapple chunks in it, heated it all up in the microwave, and drizzled it over everything.  I added cherry tomatoes to the skewers, and they turned out great, as did everything else!  This recipe is now one of our favorites!

..Have the squirt bottle ready!! Of course these flamed because of the bacon, but sacrificing a few arm hairs and half an eyebrow was worth it! I marinated mine for 24hrs and put the veggies and meat on separate skewers..used regular cut bacon and made sure there was space between for even cooking. I used sm-med sized whole button mushrooms, red peppers and onion on mine and served with an onion rice pilaf.  Really good flavors happening here..Thanks Angie!

This recipe was great, my husband loved it.  Be sure to keep space between your chicken and veggies so that the bacon gets crispy all around.  I also added big chunks of onions to my skewers.

I used maple syrup instead of honey, fresh pineapple instead of canned, and added zucchini chunks plus sweet vidalia onion chunks to the skewers.  Next time I will try cooking meat and veggies/fruit on separate skewers, and leave space between the wrapped chicken pieces to allow the bacon to get crispier.  I also took my leftover fresh pineapple, cut it into rings, dipped in a bit of brown sugar, and put that directly on the grill as well.  Good stuff!!

These were sooo yummy!! Just let the chicken and mushrooms and pinapple marinate (in seperate bowls) overnight, use regular bacon cut in half lengthwise and horizontally, and make double the sauce with dipping. HTESE ARE THE BEST! Sooo juicy, tender and flavorful!

The chicken had great flavor, but the bacon we could not eat because it was not cooked enough.  I might try regular sliced bacon next time.  The chicken had so much flavor, and I will make this time and time again.

Me, being the idiot that I am sometimes, forgot to put bacon on the chicken. For the record, it's still VERY VERY good. I guess if you wanted to make it a little healthier you can forget the bacon and still have a good meal!

Made this for dinner yesterday.  I let marinate for 6 hours which I thought was plenty.  Very flavorful.  I too used regular sliced bacon and I cut each strip in half.  I wouldn't make any other changes.

I made this last night and they were great.  My boyfriend was still going on about them today. I did double the marinade and put the chicken in half and the veggies in the other half. Next time I might add some red onion to them and also like another reviewer said use fresh pineapple then you can make the pineapple chunks the size you want.

This was very good. I marinated about 8 hours, wrapped every third piece of chicken (we just wanted a little taste of bacon). Made a second batch of marinade for veggies and put the mushrooms on one skewer and the zucchini on their own...that is the way the grill master likes it around here, everything seperate ;-) Funny my kids love pinapple but would not eat it off the grill. Fresh definitely better. Thanks will use again!

These were so good! I had 20+ ppl over and made these. I marinated the meat and mushrooms overnight and added red and orange peppers. After grilling, I transferred everything to toothpicks to make mini shish kabobs. They were a hit.  I tried chicken with and without bacon and the ones with bacon were definitely better in my opinion.

I marinated the chicken/mushrooms for over 24 hours.  I also omitted the green onion since I am not a fan of any type of onion.  I also used more mushrooms just becuase I love mushrooms.  I also added green and red pepper - which I might marinade the next time.  These kabobs were wonderful!  The taste was not too much as others have said - even though I marinated them for over 24 hours.  They did get burnt a little bit.  I would suggest not cooking them on high. And I totally forgot to wrap the chicken in bacon - so I probably won't even try that next time since people complained about the bacon being too fatty and taking away from the taste of the chicken.  We will definitely have these again at our house!

YUM!  Well worth the time and effort.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed these!  I used whole, extra-large white mushrooms and zucchini.  We found these cook better when we threaded the chicken on seperate skewers than the vegetables, but the whole presentation is much nicer when you alternate them.

This is the best new recipe that we have tried in ages!!  **** As others have mentioned, definitely use more pineapple!  We used a 20 oz. can of pineapple.  One tip - if you use bamboo skewers, soak them in water for an hour to prevent them from scorching.  ** And, if you want to make this recipe even better, use fresh vs. canned pineapple... the fresh makes it out of this world.

Great recipe!  We ended up needing more bacon and pineapple. I didn't have any green onion on hand, so I added some minced garlic instead.  Also marinated the bacon & pineapple, and some yellow onion too. My husband and I both loved it! Will make this one again, thanks!!

I live in Germany and smoked these for some guests and they had never eaten such tasty chicken!  FANTASTIC- Will make it again!
I added Try Me brand Tiger Sauce to the marinade to spice it up a bit and I smoked the kebabs, it was the best chicken I have ever eaten!!!  I left the bacon un-crispy because I hate crispy bacon!
24 hours in the fridge.

The bacon and chicken combination was heavenly. The pineapple was a good addition, too. The mushrooms got a little dried out, but just use whatever veggies you like.  It's  keeper.

This was absolutely wonderful!  We tried it a few weeks ago, and with today being Memorial Day, I had to come and look it up to make it again.  We added cherry tomatoes to our skewers; the marinade was divine!  Definitely a keeper!

WONDERFUL!!! This was my first attempt at shish kabobs and WOW what a winner.  We loved it sooo much I fixed it twice in one week.  The marinade is wonderful and the chicken stays sooo juicy.  I've never liked chicken on the grill because it gets so dry, but not with this recipe.  Even my very finicky 3 year old who doesn't like chicken usually ate this one with no protests.

This recipe tastes wonderful and is very easy to prepare!  I substituted balsamic vinegar for the cider vinegar and it was very good.  The presentation is very nice!

These are great!  Pineapple and bacon are great together.  I had all ingredients on hand and added green bell peppers.  My kids had fun helping me assemble the kabobs and everyone gave them a thumbs up.  We'll definitely have these again in the future.

These were a big hit with my family. I used regular cut bacon and sweet peppers instead of pineapple chucks. I can't wait to try it with pineapple.

The Best shish kabobs EVER! Made them for a gathering of friends (24) and they all raved over them. Followed recipe exactly. We did however marinade chicken overnight which I think gave more flavor and tenderness to chicken. Grilled perfectly. Will Definitely make again. Winner Recipe in my book!

This is one of my go-to BBQ choices especially if I want to show off a little. Easy and can prep ahead of time so I can enjoy the BBQ without much work to do. The bacon makes it easier to get the chicken cooked through without getting dry or overdone on the outside.

This is the ONLY marinade recipe I use for shishkabobs! I dont know what the negative reviewers are doing wrong, but this recipe is amazing! The chicken is juicy and super flavorful. The bacon is crispy on the outside and just a little chewy where the pieces touch. I made this tonight for the neighbors and there was no dinner talk because we were all too busy stuffing our faces! I cannot say enough positive about this recipe!

We made these on a charcoal grill, using regular bacon and they were wonderful! Everyone loved them. We didn't even marinade them for the full hour. I think the charcoal grill really added flavor, too.

Amazing flavor!! My family loves kabobs, especially my boys.  Its always fun to eat with your hands.  The marinade is so yummy and the bacon keeps the chicken super moist.  I double the marinade so that i have more for basting.  I also skewer my veggies and meat seperately because I like my veggies with some crunch.  Excellent excellent recipe.  Definitely a new favorite!

My family was having a kabob contest. These were the winners. I follow the recipe, but use olive oil instead of Canola. This is my go-to recipe whenever I want to grill. The chicken is never dry because it borrows the fat from the bacon, and the veggies taste amazing! Even my kids love this recipe! I will continue to use this recipe every summer.

As a busy mother of 3 young kids, I found the bacon wrapping part too time consuming, so I skipped it and they were still very delicious without the bacon.

The family raved abt. this recipe.  Added pieces of yellow and red peppers to the Shish Kabob.
Brushed the mixture on it each time I turned them on the grill.
Guess the family will have me hitting the grill again on this one L.O.L.

I didn't  use an entire length of bacon on each piece of chicken.  I cut the bacon in half.  Ts way the bacon will cook at the same time as the chicken.  This was a nice recipe, with good flavor.  I would definitely make it again.

This was really tasty and easy.  I made it as written and it turned out wonderful.  Even my hubby who doesn't usually like white meat because it is too dry liked it.  And my 4 kiddies gobbled it up.  My only suggestion would be to double the marinade recipe to make more basting sauce.  I ran out before I was done and the unbasted kabobs weren't as nice and flavorful.  Nice recipe!  I'm saving this one.

That was the first time, I've ever tried Kabob's, and all, I have to say is terriffic. Great flavor, recipe will be used again. The only changes I made is to add, a little Season All and added a little of juice from pineapples to the marinade will cooking it for basting.

My husband absolutely loves this meal!  We do struggle sometimes with getting the bacon grilled to how we like it.  I tried boiling the bacon first as suggested and may try a few more suggestions.  We will keep trying though!  Thanks for the recipe.

I cooked these on the grill using charcoal and wood chips for Father's Day and they were enjoyable. I did cook the vegetables on a seperate scewer because I was worried about uneven cooking between the meat and the vegetables. I marinated the chicken over night and the flavor was nice. My only problem was the consistency between the bacon and the chicken getting done, maybe my bacon slices were too big. I used thinner slices of bacon but it overlapped when I wrapped it and I felt like some of the chicken was too done but the bacon was still somewhat flimsy. So I suggest using smaller pieces of bacon and not wrapping it all the way around. I also made some without the bacon and those went over well too.

Awesome. My husband raved! The only thing I added was some green pepper slices to the skewers for a little crunch. Loved it!

This is an awesome marinade.  I did not make kabobs instead I just marinated my chicken breasts overnight then wrapped them with the bacon. While I was waiting for company to arrive I thought I would put them in the oven at 350 for about a half an hr to precook before bbq'ing them.  WOW! when we finally got around to bbq'ing them they came out just perfect-so juicy and moist. Picture perfect.  Everyone loved them.  I stir fryed the mushrooms along with onions.  I also thickened the leftover marinate with cornstarch and put this over the meat. Sorry about the long post but just had to thank you for this recipe and what I did with it.

This was fantastic even though I forgot to put the pineapple chunks on ! Doubled the batch and didn't feel like remaking 12 skewers since the coals were ready! Doing it again 4th of July weekend at the beach and will review again then. This site rocks!!

I made this minus the mushrooms, used 1 tbsp of honey, that was all I had, so I used 1 tbsp of molasses to substitute. I ended up boiling the sauce mix before I put the chicken in it, after it cooled. I poured the left over sauce over all the shish kabob sticks after I had all the meat and veggies on them, then I grilled them outside. The husband would not stop complimenting the meal! My two picky boys, 11 & 12, even liked the chicken! I served them over white rice. It was a great, fast and easy recipe. Thanks allrecipes.com!

I've never loved making Shish Kabobs, but when you get results like this it's well worth it - these were terrific.  I had some left over but I had tripled the recipe and I'm glad I did.  I put the left over meat and veggies in a pan with some of the sauce and cooked it until all was done.  Now I have lunch for several days this week.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  Note:  I followed this recipe exactly and would not change a thing.  Loved it!

Quote from my picky husband: "This is one of the best things we've made!" Reminded me of grilled chicken and veggies from a Brazilian restaurant we like. In addition to the mushrooms, I also added peppers to the skewers. Yummy.

These were really good! I would definitely recommend marrinating for longer than stated in the recipe. I marinated mine for 2 hours and it had a good flavor, but I know it would've been much better if they marinated for a bit longer.

Good flavor and moist chicken!  Hubby liked it so much he wants it for Father's Day!  This recipe makes enough marinade for 2 pounds of chicken breast meat.  I did boil the bacon before grilling as suggested by a reviewer but the bacon did not crisp up.  I'm going to try using regular sliced bacon next time and hopefully get moist chicken AND crispy bacon!

Awesome meal idea.  Not sure if marinating the meat is worth it since the bacon brings so much flavor to the chicken.  But I love kabobs and this recipe got me  to make them for dinner.  Like the picture, I added red bell pepper and onion.  Highly recommend you use fresh pineapple.  Made a great protein and veg meal.  Thanks for sharing!

this was not to my liking. I don't understand the high rating. I did marinate them overnight and maybe that's where it went wrong.

Yum! I needed a marinade that didn't have to sit overnight and this one did the trick. We used different veggies and didn't marinate them, only the chicken. What a hit! My 6yo said 'that tasted better than McDonalds chicken!' Quite a compliment in my book. ;)

We just made this for Father's Day and it was incredibly good. I did change up a few things that I think made a difference. First, I omitted the mushrooms, added yellow, orange and red pepper, vidalia onion and fresh pineapple, not canned ,to my skewer. I also used red wine vinegar since it was what I had on hand and I marinated the meat and veggies seperately for 24 hours. The flavor of the marinade infused the chicken  and veggies to make it even more fantastic. I use regular bacon like a lot of people recommended here and even pre-cooked it before wrapping it on the stick but to me, I didn't see that it added anything flavor wise and was rather difficult to keep on the stick. The meal was totally delicious with it so I probably won't use bacon next time. Pairs nicely with Lipton Aisan rice as a side dish. Would definitely reccommend again!!!

First, I marinated 6 chicken breasts and 20 mushrooms in a double batch of the marinade over night. Next time I am going to marinade the veggies too(red onion and green bell pepper). Love this Marinade! I boiled the bacon for 5 minutes like a another reviewer suggested. Not all the bacon crisped but on the ones that did the chicken was delicious. This a recipe keeper and a must try.

I did a search yesterday to find something to cook on the grill other than the usual burgers, chicken or brats.  I am so glad that I found this recipe.  I doubled the marinade and added green peppers and sweet onions.  I put everything in a large ziploc and let it sit in the fridge for about 3 hours.  I used regular sliced bacon and it came out crisp and delicious.  The chicken was very moist and tender too.  I got lots of compliments on this!  I served them with parsley buttered red potatoes.  Absolutely delicious!!

i don't own a bbq so i actually cooked this in the oven.  I used chicken tenders because thats what i had on hand.  I didn't have the vinegar it called for so i used basalmic.  I did marinate them meat and veggies seperately.  Using yellow and red pepers also.  I marinated the items for about 3 hours i think it was.  I put them in the marinade while i was at the store lol.  I  also added a little bit of garlic powder because we love garlic, i also had some cherry tomatoes we needed to use so they went on as well.  The way i did cooked them was at 400degrees for 20 minutes.  I brushed them with the marinade 2 x while they cooked.  I wanted to make sure all sides cooked properly and they didnt get dry so after i put the veggies and chicken on the scewers (sp) i put them on a cooling rack i had placed in the bottom part of a broiler pan.  My husband really loved it.  Thats all i needed to hear :)  I will use this recipe again.  Honestly i didnt change much when it comes to the marinade, only added garlic powder and different vinegar.

I made this recipe for a week-end family barbecue and every just loved them.  It was sooo much better than the typical shish kabobs I usually serve.  The bacon kept the chicken really moist and the marinade just complemented the whole dish.  After reading the reviews I did double the marinade and kept the vegetables which I added red, green and yellow peppers and sweet onion chunks along with the mushrooms in separate zip lock bags.  I will definitely be making this quite often and have already received requests to make this for our big 4th of July bash.  Thank you for the exceptional recipe!

Everything turned out great.  I took the recommendations from other readers and did the following: - boiled the bacon - doubled the marinade - used regular bacon, not thick cut - marinated the mushrooms and chicken separately - marinated overnight  Also, I didnt use green peppers, instead yellow and orange peppers and sweet onion.  Used baby bella mushrooms and cherry tomatoes.  The mushrooms were excellent.   I will add more next time.  Delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious!  Will definitely make this again, and would make it for company.  I took the left overs to work and had numerous people tell me it looked and smelled wonderful :)  After reading the other reviews, I made the following adjustments: 1. Marinated the chicken and veggies seperate and used the left over veggie marinade to brush on the chicken.  2. I doubled the mushrooms, and added chunks of sweet onion and red pepper.    3. I added a little pineapple juice to the marinade.  4. I microwaved the bacon for a minute before wrapping the chicken.

I tried making this on a skillet but had difficulty getting the food to cook evenly, but we loved the flavor.  Next time, I will cook the chicken & bacon separately from the veggies and combine at the end. I also added red peppers and onions.   I think tomatoes would be good with it as well

My husband is an excellent cook, so the nights that I cook, I feel so pressured to impress him. This recipe is super easy and is EXCELLENT. We had no leftovers! I will definitely make this again when we have a cookout b/c its so simple to do. The only thing I added to the skewers was red peppers. I also marinaded it for about 2hrs prior to cooking.

Super delicious!  I marinated the chicken cut into cubes overnight. I also added chunks of red onion, and red and green pepper to the kabobs. I also precooked the bacon in a skillet so it was basically cooked but not crispy...drained and set aside. I assembled these kabobs early in the day and poured the rest of the marinade over the kabobs...covered and refrigerated until I grilled that night.  Wow....are these tasty and since the bacon was pre-cooked....it got nice and crispy on the grill....the chicken was flavorful and the veggies got a nice char to them.  I did double the marinade and amount of chicken since I was serving 8....yes there are leftovers....lol.....a must try recipe and a keeper at that. Thanks!

Angie -- Just GREAT! Like everyone else I tweaked just a little but was happily satisfied with this recipe. My husband said the wrapped chicken bites tasted like the bacon wrapped scallops that he loves. Tasty marinade and so versatile! Will have again & again! Thanks for the great recipe.

These were fabulous! The bacon really keeps the chicken moist.  I used some of the marinade while grilling which seasoned the onion and pineapple nicely.  Even my picky 6 year old liked them.  I might make a maple sauce to drizzle over when done cooking next time.

Can't really give this a proper rating because I didn't use the bacon, but I followed everything else exactly for the chicken and the cider vinegar overpowered everything else.  If I make again, I would cut down the vinegar by half, or maybe even eliminate it..  Maybe it was the bacon that would have complimented that taste.

Great flavor.  I made exactly as stated with no changes.  I took the bacon off of my chicken (did not want the fat) as it left a wonderful taste to the chicken.  Next time I will make with different veggies!

Yummy - my whole family loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated with no changes.  We thought the carmelized pineapple really made the kebobs "pop" with flavor.  Definitely will make this one again.  Only change will be to precook the bacon so that it is more crispy.

Just okay - even though I used turkey bacon and not regular, I'm not sure the regular would've made that much difference.  A little bland, however, the bacon did keep the chicken moist.

I REALLY wanted to love this recipe, and I was so excited to make it~~what a disappointment. Frankly, I'm mystified by all the rave reviews.  I followed the marinade recipe to the letter and used some of the method tips from other reviewers: doubled the marinade; marinated chicken and mushrooms separately and overnight to insure flavorful chicken (or so I'd hoped); used regular bacon for balanced barbecuing;  cooked on medium heat to avoid dryness.  My result~~delicious mushrooms, but the chicken, while tender, was totally devoid of flavor.  Even the bacon flavor was missing.  If I use this again (and at this point, that's a big "if"), I'll definitely follow the advice of others and add garlic and possibly ginger to the marinade. Also, the recipe cries out for fresh pineapple; the canned pineapple chunks ended up shriveled and puny and were practically an unnoticeable addition.  Unfortunately, my guests and I found this recipe rather forgettable.

We LOVE these!  Made them last week and again today.  I took the advice of another person and boiled the bacon for a few minutes (and I used thick bacon btw).  I didn't have a grease fire and the chicken got at the same time as the chicken on the grill.  EXCELLENT!!!!

This was good.  Added peppers and red onion to the kabobs and served over rice.  I boiled the bacon as suggested by others.

My picky husband and I both loved this. I used minced white onion and a mix of white vinegar and apple juice instead of cider vinegar.  I covered the grill grate with tin foil so the pineapples and mushrooms didn't fall off (I bet this would work well broiled as well).  Used regular bacon, and while it did not get crispy, it added a great flavor.  I ran out of bacon and had some chicken plain, and even that was fantastic.  The mushrooms and chicken were tangy and moist.  Next time I will add green peppers and onion slices and will grill the chicken on separate kabobs so the bacon will crisp.  LOVE this recipe.

The marinate was Ok, nothing to write home about - instead of wrapping the chicken, I just precooked a bit and then cut the pieces in half, folding them in half and then putting them on top of the chicken on the skewer.  Everyone loved them though. Doubled the recipe and there was none left.

This is one of my favorite kabob recipes.  The longer you marinate the better it is.  I also add green pepper and cherry tomatoes to the skewers and serve with rice.   Just delicious!!

Lovely recipe. I substituted prosciutto for the bacon and served with steamed white rice. I was only able to marinate the chicken and mushrooms for about 30 minutes and then basted with remaining marinade halfway through the cooking time. It was still delicious! Thanks, Angie!

LOVED it!  I liked the sirloin better than the chicken.  I thought the chicken got too salty wrapped in the bacon.  I also marinated for about three hours.  The sirloin also tasted delicious without the bacon.  YUM!!!

This turned out pretty good, but I didn't get to marinate it long at all.  Honestly, less than an hour! I used Olive oil instead of Canola.  Did not use bacon. Added peppers and sweet onions to this.. and it was another winner for dinner!  Next time, I'll marinate longer and use the bacon!!!!

THIS RECIPE IS GREAT!  We followed the suggestion of using regular bacon, which we parboiled for five minutes.  Used fresh pineapple instead of canned.  Marinated longer.  It really does not need any changes or additions... just posted what we did so others could consider.

Made this for New Years Day lunch and everyone (kids and adults) loved it and it's healthy! A few tips: marinated the chicken overnight and included minced garlic in the marinade; marinated the veggies 2-3 hours and skewered separately...used whole mushrooms, red/yellow bell pepper,onion,cherry tomatoes, and fresh pineapple chunks. Served with Jasmine Rice and stir fried green beans - yummy!

These were excellent and they should have been with all the time involved.  I used fresh pineapple, green and red peppers, and red and yellow onions.  I followed the advise of others and marinaded the mushrooms separetly. I also used beef with the same marinade and it turned out great too!

We loved this recipe, especially my son. But only gave it four stars because you really need to precook the bacon. It does not get cooked enough for us on the grill. We also used reduced sodium soy sauce. Otherwise the flavors were great and we thoroughly enjoyed this meal.

Absolutely wonderful! The only change I made was to use turkey bacon which came out great. I also put the chicken-bacon wraps on separate skewers and added red pepper chunks with the veggies. It might be a little work but try this recipe...you won't be disappointed.

I make this at least once a week now, it is my new favorite marinade. The only thing i do differently is add 1/2 purple onion chopped, and a few cloves of crushed garlic to the marinade for extra flavor. I'll make the kabobs if i'm feeling ambitious but i usually just throw some breasts in the marinade in the morning. The longer you marinate the better it gets!! Thanks this one is a keeper!

These were very good. I also doubled the marinade and basted the kabobs liberally and often while grilling them. I did pre-cook the bacon on the stovetop for about 5 minutes. The only problem I had was getting the bacon to stay wrapped around the chicken while grilling. Next time I won't use the thick sliced bacon and probably won't cut the slices in half.

Really enjoyed these kabobs- so did my family (which usually doesn't always happen)!  Will make some changes the next time I make them but they are good as is also...1. will take other's advice and precook the bacon a little to reduce "flare ups" and burnt bacon, 2. will add maybe a little cayenne or garlic powder to spice up the marinade a little, 3.  I like the canned pineapple, but fresh pineapple would be perfect!  I did not marinade the mushrooms with the chicken...don't do veggies and raw meat together.  Will be making these again, maybe adding some peppers or red onion next time!

Mmmmmm! WOW! Excellent recipe! Thank you so much! I added minced garlic & marinated overnight. I used red peppers, onions, chicken & baby bella mushrooms. I didn't have enough bacon to wrap the chicken, but you don't need to. I attached a piece to one side of chicken on skewer & definately microwave bacon for 2 minutes before skewering. Will make again & again!

So good!  I added zucchini and bell peppers to the skewers and served the pineapple on the side.  I skewered some chicken without bacon, but next time I will use bacon on all the chicken.  My husband doesn't care for bacon but he even liked them better with it.  I used four breasts and doubled the sauce.  Wonderful!

I would suggest putting a bit of the pineapple juice from the can in the marinade. Also separate the marinade used for basting BEFORE you add the raw chicken, reducing contamination.

First time I cooked them too much, second time I cooked them on too low of a heat but they turned out good. 

- Next time...try something different with the bacon.

This is a very good recipe. I didnt use pineapple and added a bit of garlic but otherwise made it at written. We let it sit in the fridge for about 3 hours. The bacon made this recipe in my opinion. It added so much flavor. We didnt have any flare up issues either- my husband cooked it on medium heat and kept turning them so that may have helped prevent the flare up issues some people experienced. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great flavor - I do add green/red peppers and onion to the mix and marinate. I took the advice of another reviewer and boiled the bacon for a few minutes before wrapping around chicken so it wouldn't burn on the grill. Makes the recipe even more time consuming with the bacon wrapped chicken and setting up the skewers but we really like it.

My boys loved the bacon/chicken combo...I thought the marinate could of been better...maybe add some fresh garlic like some suggested.

Man, these were good! First Shish Kabobs I ever made and they were a hit! My kids loved them, too! I did boil the bacon for 5 minutes, as others have suggested and I didn't have green onions on hand so I used what I had and they were still delish! I'll make these a lot this summer! Thanks for the recipe!

These were great!  I didn't add mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them, and I added a little extra honey to the marinade.  We cooked them on a charcoal grill at around 300 degrees and that was the perfect temperature.  I also sprinkled some brown sugar over them when they were almost done and let it melt to add a sweet flavor.  Will definitely make these again!

I let the mushrooms and chicken marinate overnight and used applewood smoked bacon, orange and green bellpeppers and red onions.  I also minced 4 cloves of garlic for the marinade.  The whole family ate it all up.

These are great!! Can't wait to make them again! I did not use the pineapple. I marinated this all day. I tried cutting the bacon into thirds instead of half--don't, just a little too small. I also precooked the bacon just until it was soft & opaque--perfect. The chicken was still moist & the bacon was crispy.  I left the mushrooms whole.  Yum-me!

This was a truly delicious recipe.  My husband said it was the best.  All the flavors work so well together - the healthiness of the chicken, the sweetness of the pineapple, the bite of the peppers and the saltiness from the marinaide.  No flavor overwhelms you.  For the record I did use lite soy sauce (with 50% less sodium).  I also added red and green peppers.  Next time we'll add some red onion.  My compliments to Angie.

I love these!  I added green and yellow peppers on mine!  I had tried these without the bacon ( I forgot) and they were no way near as good without it! As others have said they boiled there bacon and I did not and I think I am glad I didn't!  I put them on the grill and they were just perfect!  I have to say they do take a long time to prepare but worth the wait.  Thanks!

These were great!  Since everyone said they had trouble with the grill (bacon causing the fire to flame up) we used our Foreman grill.  That way we were able to grill both sides, they cooked evenly, and no flame!  I do think the mushroom needs a bit more flavor, but I'm not sure what.  The chicken is awesome in bacon.

These were amazing . My sister-in-law begs me to make these every time she visits for dinner ... the only thing I changed was we cut the bacon into 1/4 instead so there isnt so much around the chicken...

The marinade was really good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It does take a while to wrap chicken with the bacon.  I did not cook the mushrooms with the chicken.  After reading the other reviews, I was confident that the bacon would cause high flames.  It was a great Sunday night dinner. I served it with corn casserole, slice tomatos with mozarella and fresh basil.  Great summer time meal! Thanks!

These were "ok", not great.  I skewered the meat separately from the mushrooms and pineapple as I felt the cooking times would be different.  The bacon burned even without the grill being very hot and I didn't think there was enough flavour.  Probably something I did wrong?  Won't be making these again unless I think of a way to zip up the flavours and maybe cook in an oven instead.

Easy to make and tastes great. How can you beat bacon on anything? Watch out for flare ups on the grill due to the dripping bacon fat.

Very good!  I used the packaged pre-cooked bacon.  Pulled it right out of the fridge so it was still pliable, it was perfect on the kabob!  I overcooked mine some, but still, very good!

I used a store bought Teriyaki marinade instead of the sauce mentioned here because it was what I had and it turned out great!  We also added yellow peppers and white onions.  I microwaved the bacon some before grilling and instead of having the flames on high I cooked them for longer over a low-medium setting so the veggies did not burn.  My husband said that it was the best meal I have ever made for him and he really doesnt care for chicken either!  For a quicker fix I would definitely recommend the Teriyaki marinade.

Absolutely delicious!  I did not wrap the chicken in the bacon but rather put a little piece of bacon in between pieces.  I did not marinate mushrooms because I prefer to do my veggies separate from the meat.  I ran out of skewers so I didn't do the pineapple, but I will definitely do it another time.

This is incredible marinade! I took the advice of some others and added fresh minced garlic to it. About 3 cloves per batch. I did some of my chicken wrapped with the bacon, and some I did not. Both were awesome. I used grape tomatoes, zuchinni, mushrooms and pineapple on my kabobs. I made TWO double sized batches of marinade. (For marinating, basting, and dipping.) WOW!!  This is definitely a keeper. The smell from the grill was driving the neighbors crazy. They were knocking at my door asking, "What are you grilling? It smells HEAVENLY!!"

This really turned out amazing.  The only thing that we did differently was to add a little chopped garlic to the marinade.  We made it with some zucchini and yellow squash on skewers on the grill.  There was a bit of chicken left over that we didn't have enough bacon to wrap, and we just grilled that on skewers by itself.  Those pieces turned out so flavorful that I think I may use the marinade just to make plain chicken breasts on the grill sometime.

They were gobbled up as soon as they came off the grill.  I added garlic to the marinade and used fresh pineapple. Better!

Excellent flavor combination and easy preparation.  In my past shish kabob attempts I never thought to wrap bacon around the chicken pieces, but it added flavor to the chicken and kept it moist.  What a great idea!

This was really good! I didn't have any green onion so I used chives instead and also added a little oregano and crushed red pepper to the marinade. I added sweet red pepper chunks to the shishkabobs. Fresh pineapple is definitely the way to go.

These were a hit at a party we recently had.  The chicken and veggies had such great flavor!  I use the marinade now whenever we grill chicken breasts. Thanks for sharing!

We really had fun making this recipe. And it was very good. It really kept the chicken moist wrapping it in the bacon. We added cherry tomatoes, and green peppers to our Shish Kabobs, but that marinade was so awesome! We made this on Labor Day, and decided that this was going to be our dish of choice for that holiday every year. Also we served it on a bed of Saffron Rice.

This was SO VERY GOOD!  I had red pepper chunks instead of mushrooms and let the marinade do its thing for 4 hours.  Chicken was moist and flavorful.  I bought store brand pineapple chunks and had problems keeping them on the skewers - will upgrade to fresh pineapple, per other reviewers comments.  I halved the bacon slices and precooked a bit in microwave - will use whole bacon slices next time.  I definitely will make again!  If you have trouble with skewers, keep trying. Mine looked a bit off but, Boy, were they good!  I need to practice these - well worth it.  Thanks!

This is great!  I used 1 pound of boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of the breasts and marinated 24 hours.  The marinade flavor was not too strong and the chicken turned out wonderfully.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were totally awesome!!  my whole family loved them and i'll definitely be making them again.  I took the previous advice and used fresh pineapple and packaged strips of bacon.  I also used green pepper instead of mushrooms because that was all we had.  I also didn't have cider vinegar, so i used 1/2 malt and 1/2 balsamic vinegars.  As well, i added VH honey garlic seasoning to the marinade and the chicken turned out fabulous! SO moist and delicious.  A must-try! :)

Excellent!  This recipe was fantastic!  We marinated the chicken,squash, zucchini, onions and mushrooms for about 2 hours.  Then we put all the chicken/bacon and veggies on separate kabobs.  The pineapple chunks were a great addition - added just the right hint of sweetness.  We made an extra batch of marinade to put on the kabobs while they were grilling.

This is absolutely fantastic! let the chicken & mushrooms soak in the flavors of the marinade for a bit longer then 1 hour would be my only suggestion.  If i could give it more than 5 stars i would! Thanks for sharing!!

sooooooo delicious and juicy.  i added garlic to the marinade like many others suggested, and I think it came out fabulous.  The one thing I would suggest is to use light soy sauce.  I used a darker soy sauce and it was a little overpowering and salty--maybe because I marinated it for 24 hours?, but still tasty.  I did not use an oven, instead I placed it in the broiler for about 30 minutes and flipped it once when the 15 minute mark passed--delicious.  My boyfriend LOVED IT :)

I knocked off a star only because if you follow the cooking temperature, you're gonna end up with charred meat and veggie sticks!  Cook these at a medium temp., however, and you will have an awesome dinner!  We added more garlic (of course) and also marinated some orange and yellow bell peppers with everything else.  The results (after having a good laugh at the suggested cooking temperature and wisely changing it) were incredible!

Excellent recipe!! I omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any. Everyone loved this chicken. My family loves bacon, so I knew this would be a hit!! I made alot, so there were leftovers the next day and I warmed it up in the microwave and it was still very good. Thank You

Really good-I let mine marinate overnight, plus the bacon really made the chicken tender.  My only advice is to use a grill on medium-low heat-I had ours on high and the bacon fat on the kabobs made the flames very large and burnt a couple of mushrooms. It takes longer to cook on the lower flame, but it's really worth it.

This has become my favorite recipe!  My husband absolutely loves it, and me for making it.  I've been making it lately without the bacon, and it's still wonderful!

Just made this for my weekend guests. It was excellent.  Doubled the marinade, used fresh pineapple, green pepper, and purple onion slices and regular bacon.  There were none left!

The first time I made these, I marinaded the chicken for about 3 hours, and the flavor wasn't as strong as I would have liked. These need 24 hours+, in my opinion. I have also made these with a simple BBQ marinade (just regular bottled sauce), and the flavors are fantastic. I do not recommend using turkey bacon with these, however - I tried it once, and it just doesn't work. Anyway, thanks, Angie!

Very Very easy to make and great tasting. Watch the bacon drippings since they will make the coals flame. My kids are still eating the leftovers today. They loved them.

These were soooo good!  I cooked them on the grill on foil to reduce the mess from bacon grease.  When they were almost done, I transferred them to the grate and cooked fresh green beans in the bacon grease/marinade. (blanched in boiling water prior to grilling).  I will definitely be making these again.  I may try them with beef as well (instead of chicken).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good recipe.  I broiled them instead of grilling.  The pineapple was a nice balance to the saltiness of the bacon.  I had some leftover chicken, which I left in the marinade overnight.  Sauteed them the next day -- they caramelized beautifully!  Threw them on a mixed-greens salad -- delicious!!  Thanks!

Very good! I made this exactly as it states. Next time I think I'll try to marinade it overnight. I also didn't eat any of the bacon that was wrapped around the chicken it did brown, as I grilled my kabob, but it wasn't quite done enough for my taste. Other than providing a little extra flavor, I think you could omit the bacon strips and it would still turn out wonderful! Thumbs up, my very picky daughters even gave this a thumbs up. Thanks!

This was osogood.  That's all everyone could say.  And mmmmm.  Heard that alot too!  Great recipe.  We didn't vary the skewers which helped the cooking time for the veggies and pineapple.  We also did cherry tomatoes and sliced sweet onions.  

My biggest concern was that the bacon wouldn't cook, but it did.  And boy was it tasty.  The marinade was excellent and I'm going to try it with beef or pork.

This recipe will not disappoint.

TOP NOTCH GRILLING!! Really Tasty..Definite keeper. I liked to cut the stems off the mushrooms instead of slicing them in half. Made them a little more secure on the skewer. Thanks for the recipe..Awesome!!!

If I could give it 10 stars, I would!!! The marinade was incredible.  I did follow the suggestions of others (more pineapple, more mushrooms, marinated for 3 hours, and skipped the bacon).  What a hit!!!

Great flavor but it doesn't cook evenly on the grill. The bacon wrapped chicken doesn't cook as fast as the veggies.

The marinade for this recipe was really good.  I also tried substituting potatoes for the mushrooms, however, the potatoes didn't cook all the way through, even in small pieces.  When I make this again, I'll probably just start the potatoes earlier and grill them in foil separately.

This was super easy and tasted great.  Made these twice.  Both times I was asked for the recipe!  Marinated for 24hours.  Did veggies & meat separately.  Zucchini, red bell pepper, & red onion were great additions to the veggies.  Thanks!

This recipe is great!  I doubled the marinade and used fresh pineapple.  Next time I'll leave off the bacon because it was difficult to cook.  The fresh pineapple was absolutely delicious with the other flavors.

Very good and easy to make.  I doubled the marinade and separated the mushrooms and chicken, as others have suggested.  I could have used a few more mushrooms.  I used nearly a whole lb. of bacon, regular slices.  Be sure to use the best bacon with the least amt. of fat you can find.  Because I was in a hurry, I forgot to oil the grill and the pineapple did stick a little.  I also forgot to save the marinade, but it still turned out quite good and we all liked it.  Will make again.

Absolutely wonderful.  Thank you Angie!  We ate them all in one night and the next day I was craving more.  I was a little frightened as I do not like cider vinager but these were awesome.  I wouldn't do it any other way now.

My husband made these the first time and forgot the pineapple and bacon (the best parts).  I made the recipe again a few nights later and it was delicious. (He's usually a better cook than me but must have had an off night).

Very tasty!  Omitted mushrooms, and added some garlic powder and a little  crushed wild onion.  Family prefers well cooked bacon, so next time I will partial cook bacon short of crisp so it can be wrapped around chicken.  Also will add more pineapples 'cause it's so good.

This turned out really good. I didn't have mushrooms on hand so I just did bacon wrapped  around chicken chunks. I had turkey bacon and precooked it a little before wrapping.   The bacon was crispy and chicken was moist. You don't want to over cooked it. It will be dry. I'll make this again but will have to double the sauce. Thank you for sharing.

My dad was star struck after sinking his teeth into these babies! I did add cherry tomatoes along with the pineapple, but the bacon stole the show with this one! Make to cut if I bite-size pieces, however, otherwise the chicken will not cook all the way through. I found that a little extra time on the grill did the trick.

Made  some rice to go along with it.

OK, I was so excited about this recipe...took the better part of 2 hours prepping this. I was a little concerned about the high grill temperature recommended, so after preheating, I turned it down to medium. I put my kabobs on, set the timer for 5 minutes to check them and came outside to smoke billowing out of my Weber gas barbeque and a full on fire inside! I guess it doesn't handle bacon grease very well. What a waste of time and materials. The sauce is great (I did add garlic and fresh ginger). Not sure if I want to try this again though.

Overall a very good recipe. I doubled the marinade to be sure I had enough, marinaded the chicken and mushrooms in separate bowls and added crushed garlic for added flavor . I also added baby onions to the kabobs. Next time, I am going to try it with fresh pineapple chunks.

This is an excellent recipe. Will definitely make it again. The chicken was so tender and tasty. The only change I made was put a little less vinegar since my husband does not like the sour taste. I also did not have time to thicken the sauce so just poured it on top of skewers as I was cooking. So good. Grandkids loved it.

The bacon added another whole dimension to the chicken.  I used regular-cut bacon because it cooked and crisped better.  I would suggest that you don't crowd the chicken pieces otherwise the bacon stays raw in between.  Let it breathe and cook.  Using flatter shish kabob rods will help keep the chicken from rotating as you turn them.

I substituted molasses for the honey and cabbage for green onion. Can't go wrong with bacon but don't expect it to be crispy.  Next time I think I'll try partial cooking bacon before I skewer it with chicken.

Instead of using Soy sauce I used Liquid Aminos All Purpose Seasonings.  I also added a little (~1TPBL) of orange juice. The dish is very good.  Definitely will make it again.

I wound up just using the sauce to make a modified version of the kabobs for my family, since the version in this recipe didn't work for us. The sauce was DELICIOUS, though, so I'm glad I was able to find it! I also added some crushed red peppers to the sauce for some extra spice.

Great-everybody loved it.  Next time- more pineapple. I added assorted veggies ( and took the advice for adding beef too)..  Enough flavor- I'm not sure bacon is essential- lots of work to keep the bacon wrapped on the skewer.

Wow! The chicken was moist and tender. I took the advice to boil the bacon for 5 minutes and it worked great. Everyone loved them. I made these for Mothers Day. Since my guests were coming at different times these worked great. We cooked some when the first guests came and then put more on as the others came. I had 16 people and the serving adjustment on this site was a great help and accurate.  I cooked crockpot Jasmine Rice, pasta salad and cucumber salad and Kings Hawaaian rolls too. Great party meal!

Very good. Great flavor, relatively simple. I made three times as much marinade as called for; you need it for both now & later. Also, used some thighs as well as breast, for more flavor.

Will cook again!

Maybe the chicken needs to be fully wrapped? Wrapping only three sides resulted in the bacon being wiggly when the chicken was done or dried out chicken when the bacon was cooked.

My wife loves this recipe and requests it all the time.  I made a couple modifications.  First, I do not marinade the mushrooms they get too soggy and fall apart I just brush the reduced sauce on during cooking.  Second, I add fresh ground ginger to the marinade and it seems to work very well.  Finally, I add some green or red pepper skewers.

Was a Big Hit at the BBQ.  I used cherry tomatoes, pineapple, green peppers and red onion in addition to the bacon wrapped chicken and mushrooms.  It was so moist and flavorful.  Defiantly will be keeping this recipe.

I love these kabobs and have made them several dozen times.  They are always a hit.  I like to serve them with Curried Rice Pilaf from this site.  These 2 dishes pair perfectly together.

After making these so many times, I've learned the following:
-Just use regular bacon, boil for 5 minutes before wrapping chicken to reduce flare-ups on the grill.  
-Double the marinade and marinate the mushrooms separately from the chicken so you don't have to boil the marinade to baste while grilling.
-Experiment with different veggies (peppers, onions, tomatoes, etc).
-My biggest tip - use FRESH pineapple

The flavour was great, and I love the idea of cooking the marinade over the stove to use as a sauce (I thickened it up with a pinch of cornstarch while it was cooking).  However, using a marinade with that much vinegar for only an hour gave the chicken a weird pasty texture!  Next time, I will make a basic teriyaki sauce marinade without the vinegar to see if that helps preserve the chicken's texture.

I also cooked the bacon a bit before putting it on the kabobs (I don't think it would have had a hope of cooking if I hadn't done that), and I made some extra kabobs with peppers and onions and cooked them separately braising them in the same sauce as the chicken kabobs.  The veggie kabobs were delicious!

I basically did the recipe as written.  I did add sliced onion pieces to my skewers and left some of the mushrooms whole.  This was a very easy recipe and quite tasty.  The bacon grease kept the skewers from sticking to the food so bad.  I will use this again.

For experienced cooks this is no-brainer stuff.  If you're a newbie like me, some observations.  As others suggested, double up or triple up on the marinade so your mushrooms are submerged.  I didn't and all the shrooms that weren't well moistened broke up and wouldn't stay on skewers.  Don't make mistake I made in trying to use pre-cooked bacon.  Much too dry, wouldn't wrap.  Ended up pulling everything off the skewers and baking.   Edible but very dry.  Not recipes fault   Will try again the right way.

I've made this quite a few times since I found this recipe like 2 years ago. My in-laws always want to come over when we have this! So good, my wife prefers crispy bacon so I cook the bacon before hand.... This marinated mushrooms are awesome and all mine since no one else eats them at our house.

The only thing I would add to this is the fact that i was looking at the attached photo and it shows bell peppers and onions on the skewer which are not in the ingredient list... so I had to add them to my shopping list.  Otherwise tasty.

Great recipe. I've made it several times and actually haven't tried it with the bacon yet, but it still comes out great. We love the flavor of the chicken.

Fantastic!  I marinated all together for about 4 hrs. I did boil the bacon first a one user recommended, a very good idea.  I also added a crushed garlic clove.  I boiled up the marinate and basted while cooking.  What was left I mixed withe some cooked rice vermicelli and gave it a quick fry.  Ex!

Delicious modified by using no pineapple or bacon and made this to marinade veggies and chicken and steak forr several hours came out good except the chicken came out a little dry next time i will cook less time. Also I seperated veggie and meat kabobs so the veggies dont over cook.

These were phenomenal, my husband and I love them. I love to cook and try out new recipes. I used chicken and peppers, I think next time I'll add broccoli. There is no need to season your chicken because the marinade is very strong and add's plenty of flavor. I also used the pineapple juice in my remaining marinade to add another sweet element and it turned out awesome. Definitely doing these again and I'm going to try shrimp.

Very good basic recipe. Followed the directions as printed (don't believe in rating a recipe when changes have been made). I did as one rater suggested, boiled the bacon first and it cook beautifully and the chicken was not dried out. Next time I will add onions, maybe some green bell peppers and cherry tomatoes. Will definitely make again. Thanks Angie.

Definitely need to use regular sliced bacon. The thick bacon did not seem to cook all the way through (though the chicken under it did) and left this rubbery texture. Was not appealing to me or my husband. Also, we did not like the flavor of the marinade. My husband was VERY disappointed that he put all that effort into setting them up on skewers and then hated the taste. While I love the idea and look of kabobs, I would never do this recipe again.

Works well with teriyaki instead of soy in a pinch. Also tossed in some sweet chili sauce with the marinade. Juicy and delicious!

These were great for the Fathers Day grilling. I marinated overnight. I loaded 5 on the shewers and that was too tight. The bacon couldn't cook in between the pieces. Chicken was so moist !!! Pineapple was nice complement. This is a keeper.

These were just ok.  I used 40% reduced fat bacon and just 1/2 piece to each piece of chicken.  The marinade was pretty blah, there are so many better ones here.  I may try the Key West Chicken marinade and then put some bacon on it.. that part was pretty tasty.  I liked the pineapple too.  Sorry, just didn't care for the marinade.

Everybody liked this recipe.  I doubled the sauce and marinated the chicken and vegetables separately. That way we used the vegetable marinade while grilling the kabobs.  We used regular bacon and that worked really well for us.

Fantastic. This was my first kebab and it was wonderful. We aren't a huge chicken-loving family but we ate it all up. I'm allergic to mushrooms, so I switched to yellow and red grape tomatoes. Really any Kabob-friendly veggie will do, as it's the marinade that makes this dish.

GREAT RECIPE! Everyone was WOWED although I changed one thing. I used the "Iron Chef Sesame and Garlic Glaze" it's all natural and organic and very delicious. Each time I flipped the kabobs I glazed them with the glaze. I also added 2tbs to the original marinade. They came out perfect as all my friends were asking me for the recipe!!!! I also marinated the mushrooms separately and for a 1/2 shorter time than the chicken. Overall great recipe!!!!

NUMMY!  We enjoyed this dish a couple of times over this past summer.  I also add red and green pepper and red onion to the skewers.  Otherwise, we prepared as directed with great success.

These were pretty good. Left off the bacon, as my husband doesn't like it wrapped around meat. The marinade was quick to put together and the pineapple added a nice touch. Thanks!

Ok, FABULOUS!  I'm lazy though, I used a bottle of good teriyaki marinade, not cheap, probably cheaper to make it...also, I used someone's suggestion and boiled the bacon for 5 mins first...I've served this at several bbqs this summer and everyone LOVES it.  Thank you!

Delicious. Kids ate it all. Next time i'll use more mushrooms and less chicken. That marinade is perfect on those mushrooms.

These Kabobs were wonderful. The chicken was very tender; mushrooms and pineapple were great. I wanted to keep mine lean so I didn't use any bacon. I also used a Foreman grill instead of outdoor grill.

This was good.  I did not use mushrooms.  I think the only changes I would make next time would be to use fresh pineapple and to take some of the marinade prior to adding the chicken and cooking it down to make a glaze.  And then use the glaze to baste the chicken in while cooking.  I also didn't wrap the chicken with the bacon.  Instead I threaded it like a ribbon around the bacon and pineapple.  The bacon never got crispy but it was still good.

This was a very tasty recipe.  My whole family including our dinner guest really enjoyed it.  It was very easy without a whole lot of ingredients.  It was something we were able to put together in a short period of time.  We added green peppers and onions to ours and it turned out delicious. Letting it marinade for 4 or more hours helps it absorb the flavor more.

Excellent!  I marinated the mushrooms separately and used that marinade to baste the kabobs.  I omitted the bacon and used fresh pineapple, onion, green peppers and tomatoes on the skewer.  It was unbelievable!  This will be our only kabob recipe.

Yummy!!!! I marinated just the chicken breasts whole, I left them for 8 hours and they were great.  I added peppers, and onions and brushed the marinade on the kabobs before grilling.  They were a hit!

This was SOO good!  I used turkey bacon and it was still excellent for less the calories and fat!  I also used pineapples with heavy syrup which made for a to die for sweet/salty combo.  I'm not sure why everyone was marinating the meat and the mushrooms separately.   I marinated them together and it turned out just fine.

My 11 year old says this dish goes on his list of favorites (w/ mac & cheese at the head of the list, that's saying something!) ONE THING I want to suggest:  if you're like me, and don't always have honey stocked in your pantry, use some of the pineapple juice from the can of pineapple chunks you will use in this recipe.  For the 2 TB of honey, I substituted 3/8 cup pineapple juice.  It was the perfect amount of sweetness, and the acid from the juice helps tenderize the chicken in the marinating process.  This recipe is perfect for customizing-- you could use green or red peppers, cherry tomatoes, oninon, etc.-- but don't be afraid to try it out exactly as is, it's terrific!

Really great flavor! The only problem I had was that the bacon doesn't cook on all sides (where it's pressed against other pieces on the skewers).  So, I put the pieces in a hot skillet for a few minutes to crisp up.  My husband didn't mind the soft bacon on the sides.  I tried to boil the leftover marinade to make a safer basting glaze, but once it boiled I didn't appreciate the smell/taste.  So, I didn't baste them at all.  They really didn't need it - the chicken (after marinating x 4 hours) and bacon lent a nice flavor to surrounding pieces.  I added green bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, and red onions to our skewers.  Yum!

These are wonderful. I'd marinate longer and get a fresh cut pineapple instead so you have enough pineapple and larger chunks.

Awesome! Be careful to make only the amount you want to eat that meal as the bacon didn't turn out very well when reheated the next day.

These were delicious. My whole family devoured them.  I did as some suggested and I doubled the marinade recipe.  I used 1/2 to marinade the chicken cubes and 1/2 to marinade the mushrooms, which I left whole.  I marinated chicken and mushrooms overnight and used the marinade from the mushrooms to baste the kabobs as they grilled.  I also used regular bacon instead of thick cut and it crisped up nicely.

I cooked this today and everyone loved it!  Not bland at all, tons of flavor.  I doubled the marinade and added a crushed garlic clove, red pepper flakes. I marinated zucchini and cherry tomatoes with the chicken and mushrooms for about 6 hours. It was perfect!

I added cherry tomatoes, zucchini, and red onion.  Also, the thick bacon wasn't necessary, it made it difficult to cook it through the parts that overlapped.  Still, it was delicious and my family loved the marinade!

Served these at a family get-together and they went like hotcakes! I tasted the marinade before I poured it over the chicken and mushrooms and wasn't so sure but I was pleasantly surprised! I doubled the marinade and marinated the chicken and mushrooms in separate bags for 3 hours.  I also pre-baked 1/2 the bacon and left the other half raw...it made no difference in the end result (except that the raw bacon was easy to wrap). Awesome recipe, thanks!

Delicious!!  Definitely a keeper at my house.  The only thing I did different was use Balsamic Vinegar vs. Apple Cider (didn't have any), and I also added some fresh chopped garlic.  Marinated 8 hours, grilled, perfecto!!!

I was surprised to read a review saying this recipe was forgettable.  I made it just as is and my family and frinds loved it!  I ran out of time and couldn't let it marinate as long as the recipe recommended and they still said it was great!

This bbq chicken was very tasty with an asian flair.  I did make a few changes.  I used rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  I did not make kebobs but grilled chicken breasts halved.  Served it with teriyaki rice and broccoli/snow pea pod stir fried vegetables.

Wonderful!  Will definitely make again.  I didn't use bacon, but instead added sausage to the shish kabobs.  I had to make tons of extra marinade because I was feeding eight people, but still I think that the little.  Also, I marinated onions and peppers and I kept the meat and veggies separate while marinating and cooking.  This recipe is a winner!

This marinade is GREAT!  I loved the mushrooms.  The bacon wasn't as crispy as I expected, but I broiled in the oven so that may be why.

Love it, Love it, Love it! I doubled the marinade, then put half in one freezer bag and half in the other. The first bag I used for the chicken, the second for the veggies. Makes for no mess clean-up too! Made some bobs chicken and potato for hubby, made others green pepper, pineapple, mushroom and chicken for myself. Very versatile, you can use anything! I also used the regular cut bacon, not the thick as others suggested.

My wife thought this was the greatest thing ever! We cooked some of the chicken pieces without the bacon, but the bacon-wrapped pieces were MUCH better.

This was absolutely awesome!!! I marinated the chicken overnight.  Added green peppers, & 2 cloves of crushed garlic and forgot to marinate the mushrooms but it still came out great.  I used regular cut bacon and didn't have a problem some had w/it being a bit on the raw side.  THe chicken was juicy and so flavorful.  I will be making these again next weekend.  A huge hit!!!

I have used this marinade (very similar...not so much oil..the more oil, the more likelihood your meat will burn) for pork kabobs. Besides onions, mushrooms and pineapple, I add chunks of green (red and/or yellow) pepper. I have never wrapped the meat with bacon...It might be good that way...maybe too much pork? I don't think so!

FANTASTIC recipe!  A perfect way to barbeque moist chicken.  I used red wine vinegar in place of cider vinegar and skipped the mushrooms because I didn't have any.  I added green peppers and it was great!  I will definitely be making this again.

Good flavor, but definitely need to be marinated during cooking to keep from drying out.  I didn't marinate because I had had the raw chicken in the marinade. Next time, I would keep some out to use.

I'm giving 5 stars because I bet they would've been delicious if my husband didn't burn them all...he wasn't paying attention.  So into the garbage they went.  :(  I was so looking forward to consuming them.  I will try them again.

These were absoulutley delicious! I marinated my chicken and mushrooms overnight making them both very flavorful! I also added cherry tomatos to the center of the kabobs for some color and some jalapeno peppers for some spice! They were a great hit at my BBq and I will make these again for sure!

This is one of my favorite summer recipes.  The first time I made this, my husband and I were hooked.  Have passed this one on to many friends and family members.  A little bit of work, but well worth the effort.  YUMMY!!!!

This is very good, but the proportions are off a bit and I question the the caloric count. Since it was cold and wet outside, I broiled them - no problem. Just broil them at the greatest distance your oven allows, and keep a close watch for burning. No problems with substituting EVOO, and lower sodium bacon either. Add a pinch or two of salt to the marinade if desired.

This recipe turned out great! 1. I didn't have any cider vinegar, so I substituted Balsamic vinegar instead, and it worked great. 2. I added some onion powder (omitted green onion), garlic salt and pepper. 3. I wrapped a slice of jalepeno inside the bacon along with the chicken, that added an awesome extra flavor without being spicy at all. 4. I took the advice to use regular bacon and boil it for 5 minutes first. It came out perfect. 5. I broiled it instead of grilling. I broiled for around 7-10 min each side, till it was nice and crispy looking. This recipe was a hit! Especially given its relatively low calorie profile.

I've been making this recipe once in a while for 9 years now.  It is a major hit every time I bring it out.  The balance between the saltiness of the soy sauce, the sweetness of the honey, and the acidity of the cider vinegar really brings a wonderful flavour to this dish.

The one thing I do that isn't in the recipe is to add thick slices of red onion to the chicken and mushroom mix in the marinade, and then thread those onto the skewers along with everything else.  It adds a nice extra touch of extra colour and texture on the skewers and also complements the existing flavours well.

This has become a family favorite!  I added 2 crushed garlic cloves to the marinade.  I also added chunks of Vidalia onion, as well as green & red peppers to the skewers.  This recipe needs close monitoring as it cooks, but it's well worth the effort!

I marinated the chicken for a couple of days, makes it very tender.
Also added minced garlic cloves.  The sauce is also great for marinated salmon.

Really tasty kabobs. Ate leftovers through week -- mushrooms (I used crimini) definitely got better with time. No issue if you BBQ these and let them sit for awhile before serving. Took advice and microwaved the bacon a bit, which helped. My 1/2 pound of bacon was not enough to wrap every piece of chicken, though. I'd also err on the side of more pineapple. It was super tasty, but fresh instead of canned and more than 8 oz would have been better. Planning to use this marinade on just mushrooms this week again. I doubled the batch the first time and split to marinate chicken in separate container than mushrooms. Would be tasty with an onion on the skewer as well, I think. Or maybe some green pepper, which I think goes nicely with pineapple. Room to experiment.

Great recipe!  Made this for my husband and myself.  We both loved it.  Usually do not like soy sauce glazes, but the cider vinegar tones it down nicely. Will definitely make this again next time we have guests over.  Thanks Angie!

This recipe was pretty good, all the flavors were there and it really was tasty.  My only problem was that I couldn't get the bacon crispy enough for my liking.  It came out kind of soggy.  I would definitely use regular bacon and not thick cut.  Other than that it was pretty good.

This was so easy and delicious! I let marinade for 2 hours, and about 3 tablespoons of of chopped garlic. I also doubled the marinade so it would really coat all my goodies, and placed in a big ziplock bag. I covered some with turkey bacon and some with normal so that there was a lower fat version, but both were spectacular! I served with barbequed cabbage and grilled asparagus. I will certainly make this again! Just thinking of those mushrooms makes my mouth water!

So I didn't exactly follow the recipe. My mom made us kabobs growing up and we always used stew steak, mushrooms, green peppers, onion and cherry tomatoes. I loved the idea of bacon rolled chicken so we rolled half of the mushrooms and half of the beef. Excellent!!

These were absolutely AWESOME!  I think next time I will marinate for a bit longer (only marintated for 2 hrs..guests were arriving soon) and add a bit of grated garlic.  Everyone at our party asked me for the recipe!  Thanks!

Fantastic! Yumo.  Will definately make again.  We used boneless skinless turkey as that is what we had.  We may put red onion or peppers on the skewers next as well.

These were delish!!  Used whole mushrooms. Warmed the bacon in microwave before wrapping.  Marinade is also very yummy and easy.

These were very yummy, I marinated them for 3 hours! Unfortunately, I am not a skilled BBQ-er and burned most of them to a crisp :(  It was very sad but some were edible and those that were, were delicious!

OMG are these addicting!  I have made them twice so far and they keep getting better!  We added peppers and onions to our kabobs to give more veggie choices, but everything else is followed by the recipe.  It is most definitely a summer staple for us.

Absolutely delicious! The chicken had great flavor and the bacon really set it off. I also LOVED the addition of the pineapple to these kabobs. The only thing I did differently was to omit the onions and I just crushed 2 cloves of garlic and threw them in the marinade. I only marinaded these for about 1/2 hour and they were great.

FIVE STARS!!!  Very good.  I made these the night prior and let them marinate overnight.  Next time I won't marinate as long cause it started to cook my chix.  I added GREEN PEPPERS to the Kabobs and next time I will add some ONION layers.  Husband couldn't get enough of these and I plan to make them for the next time we have company.  They will be PERFECT!

WOW!  I just made this tonight, and it was sooo GOOD!  I did add garlic and pinapple juice to the marniade.  I did cook it on a reynolds wrap to keep the bacon juices from the flame, worked really well plus juices puddled making it work even better, can't wait to fix this again!!!

Yum, love cooking this one on the grill. Even though it takes some time to prepare its worth it. I've tried regular bacon and turkey bacon, regular is the best. Great recipe.

I'm sure they would have been great if they weren't blackened by the bacon catching the grill on fire........I suggest the bacon be precooked a bit and threaded on instead of being wrapped around the chicken.  Maybe next time I'll try that.....

We've made this SO many times, especially for company becasue the presentation is so nice.  I don't like mushrooms, so we substitute red peppers.  It goes nicely with the other items.

This was awesome!  Let me start by saying I had some last minute chaos before my party and in the rush to get these on the grill, I forgot the bacon.  They were still fabulous without (but I can't wait to try them again with the bacon).  I added red and yellow peppers to the skewers because I like veggies. Great marinade!

This recipe took a little time to prepare, but the results were well worth it.  We made it exactly as written, but it would also be great without the bacon (even though the bacon lends a great flavor).  My husband and I both loved it and will be making time and time again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Forgot the mushrooms, and used Kikkoman Teriyaki marinade instead of plain soy sauce.  Pretty good recipe. Surprisingly, i didnt have a problem with any grease fires from the bacon as I used thick cut bacon.  The bacon keeps the chicken moist & flavorful.  FORGOT THE GARLIC - it probably would have rocked my world if I had added garlic. I'll definately try this recipe again!

Excellant!  The marinade makes the chicken very tasty but not over powering.  Didn't have pineapple so used thick slices of zuchinni, marinated the chicken, mushrooms and zuchinni for a couple of hours before grilling.

While DH & I thought these were very good, the grease from the bacon caught fire and made a big mess on the grill.  Agree with other reviewers - bacon is not needed, but the flavor was very good.  I also added red peppers, canned whole potatoes, and onion chunks.  I also think the marinade would be good just on whole chicken breasts.  Will make again.

These were ok. I think my husband over-cooked them.  I'll try them again and keep an eye on my watch once they hit the grill.

We loved this, but all agreed the bacon is not necessary.  I added pieces of onion, and green and red bell pepper, and cooked it in a fish basket on the grill.

These are the best shish kabobs I have ever had.The chicken turns out so moist and the bacon is nice and crispy.My husband cooks the pineapple and mushrooms on the grill in a seperate grilling pan.That way they don't get over done.

this was really good!! I doubled the marinade and added garlic to it and left the chicken and mushrooms marinate for a few hours.  It was a bit of a messy assembly but the taste was fantastic!  We used metal skewers also and had no problems.  Everyone loved them - we also marinated them throught the grilling process.  Will make again as it's much tastier than the usual hot dogs and burgers!

This recipe tasted good and was a nice switch during for the summer time when grilling leads to repetition. I was a little dissapointed with the marinade which I think lacked some flavor - I would love to throw a little bourbon into it and see how that tasted.  One other point - I used metal skewers and would advise people to stick with bamboo for this recipe as the kabobs were difficult to turn and slid around the metal.  The fresh grilled pineapple was delicious.

This was FANTASTIC! My husband and I loved this! So easy to make, and sooo good! This recipe is definitely a keeper.  It seems like it could be versatile too. I want to cook the marinade  mushrooms and chicken with the pineapple and serve it over rice. Yum! I never used the bacon.

This was a decent recipe.  I used fresh pineapple, which was excellent.  Both the husband and I found the bacon to be a little overwhelming, could not taste the chicken at all (each piece was wrapped in half a slice of bacon).  I cooked another batch without the bacon and liked it better. This recipe would be great for real bacon lovers!

This is a difficult recipe for me to review.  I thought the flavor was good, but next time I would add garlic to the marinade as I felt it needed a little kick.  I did partially cook the bacon in the microwave, but we still had problems with grease fires!  The pineapple chunks were a problem as they kept falling off so I would probably elimiate them next time.  I think the addition of red or yellow peppers would be good.  I still give this recipe a 4 star rating as we did enjoy the meal once it was cooked, and I would make it again with the changes I have mentioned.

Very yummy treat for us while trying to adhere to the South Beach diet.  I think I cut my chunks of chicken too large because they took quite a while to grill.  1 in cubes would be nice.

Wow! These were yummo! I used the recipe almost to the letter except I used half the soy and half teriyaki sauce and I am a garlic fan so added lots of garlic. Next time may try salt reduced soy as the bacon also added a little to the salt level. We are new to BBQing and my hubby and MIL thought that I was a BBQ Master (don't tell anyone that I learned all I know from this site)! Love the recipe and thanks for sharing!

Very good! The bacon is important and makes the chicken taste good and stay moist on the grill.

Great marinade!  However, I would suggest letting the chicken marinate at least a few hours - I only left it in for an hour and the chicken came out a little dry.  Loved the bacon, mushrooms and pineapple though!  I will definately make this again.  Thanks.

How can you go wrong with chicken, bacon, and pineapple?  This is delicious.  It works great for a BBQ when there is standing room only.  Kids love anything on a stick as well.  Thanks for the post.

Very good marinade. I didn't rate a 5 because our bacon came out a little soggy. So at the very end we put over flame, but then some of it got burnt. Will keep the bacon off next time.

Very good. I added a few things to the marinade for our tastes, though. Wrapping the chicken in bacon wasn't as time consuming as I feared. I recommend a hickory smoked bacon. I'll definitely make this often

these are great if you like soy.  I used lite soy sauce and still thought it was too overwhelming a flavor (which explains the 4 stars).  Otherwise, they were great.

Grease fire.  I followed the instruction exactly and my entire grill went up in flames.  Everyone in the neighborhood said it smelled great.  Too bad it wasn't a recipe for blackened, charred, burnt chicken.  Absolute disaster.  The pizza tasted great though.

Wow! These were awesome. I didn't have any green onions, so I marinated white onions along with the mushrooms. As suggested, I made a double batch of marinade and did the chicken and vegetables seperate. I didn't have pineapple, but I bet it would have tasted even better with it! I also made a third batch of marinade for dipping.
Everyone in the family was impressed! Thank you!

Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It was awesome....it was my first time making this recipe for a dinner party last night.  I basically followed the recipe (marinating overnight) and also added scallops in addition to the chicken, wrapped in regular cut bacon.  It was a big hit.  I had also used fresh pineapples, and made a separate marinate for the dipping sauce.  This was so delicious...we are already looking for another occaision to try this recipe again!!!

Absolutely awesome! Followed some of the tips from previous reviewers and they were the best kabobs I've ever had.  This is well worth the extra work involved.  I highly recommend buying fresh pineapple!

I can't say enough positive things about this recipe.     I follow it exactly, and have used it also on shish kabobs using a combination of pork and chicken.    Absolutely the best.    Have already made it 3 times in 2 weeks.

This was really good.  I marinated the chicken overnight based on others' reviews and it had a good flavor. I bought 'thick cut' bacon, as directed and found it to be way too fatty to eat.  Next time I will get regular thin bacon and hope that it crisps up on the grill.

I was so dissapointed with this. Not by the recipe I think it would have been great but my husband cooked them to long on the grill and they were dry and burnt. I will try again and cook them myself. I did add fresh garlic to the marinade and seperated the chicken and mushrooms. Definatly marinade for 24h cant wait to try again.

I love this recipe!  I'm not a great cook - but I kept to the directions and everything turned out perfect!  The only mistake I made was cutting the mushrooms too small (because I didn't buy enough of them).  My friends are still raving!

This is one of my favs.  Though they are time-consuming, every time I make them, I get rave reviews.  The only thing I find is that you need more bacon, and that you have to make sure that your chicken is cut into small enough pieces to ensure that it is fully cooked by the time the bacon is cooked. Overall though - great recipe!

The strong vinegar aroma had me worried but the flavor was great, the whole family liked this and the meat was moist on the larger pieces, think it was overcooked in general but that is no fault of the recipe. Half with, half without bacon and both were devored. I did double the recipe.

Thought these were very good, although I should have left out the mushrooms, since we really don't like mushrooms. I marinated overnight and all of the next day to make sure it sat long enough. I did double the marinade, which I would recommend. Bacon takes some time to cook all the way on the grill. Would recommend cooking veggies and pineapple separate from meat to ensure the cooking rates are the same, i.e. the meat takes longer than veggies.  I also added red onions, which my husband raved about. Thanks for the great recipe.

These are really good. Got a big thumbs-up with mouths full! Didn't use mushrooms. I used regular thickness bacon because I like it crunchy. I doubled the marinade and threw a pound of shell-on shrimp in with the chicken. Grilled those separately and they tasted awesome too.

Delicious! We have a pretty high power Weber grill, so we didn't need to put the heat on so high (a few of our skewers were a bit charred). Despite that, the flavors were terrific and we will definitely make again.

That was very good.  I had to make some changes because I didn't pineapple chunks or green onions, so replaced it with yellow onions and added pinapple juice to the marinade instead.  Thank you for a yummy idea.

It was OK; I used turkey bacon and added yellow pepper and red onion to the skewers.  Otherwise, made as stated.  The mushrooms were great, the chicken was overpowered by the bacon.  May use the marinade again, but wouldn't wrap with bacon.

This is truly 5 stars!  I made this for my family on Father's Day.  It was perfect.  I did double the marinade-  half for the veggies and half for the chicken.  I also bought the even cook frozen chicken.  The pieces of chicken I threaded on the skewers were all about the same size.  The chicken turned out very moist and done to perfection and the bacon was browned nicely.  I took the advice of others and did each ingredient on its own skewer.    I will defintely use this receipe again.  Thank you for a delicious meal!!

AMAZING!  These were so tasty...I loved them, my husband loved them and we will be eating them again FOR SURE!  (I marinated for about 7 hours or so...could do more if you want more "zip")  But I thought they were fantastic marinated for that long! I did use green pepper though instead of pineapple...not a pineapple fan.

Weird review...fair warning. After making this recipe, we realized that we are not kebob lovers. By any means, not of fault of the submitter, it is just  too much of a hassle. HOWEVER, the chicken marinade and wrapped in bacon is SOOO good. I was a bit apprehensive at first, after seeing the ingredients, but it tasted so yummy. The chicken was so tender and juicy. The only change I made was adding some red pepper flakes for a bit of zip. I pre-made the marinade and I took it camping with me. The day I decided to grill them, we put the chicken in a tupperware bowl with the marinade left it to soak all day and it was excellent. I will use this again, but not for skewering. Thank you Angie.

Delish! I made this for my memorial day bbq and I loved it. I didn't have cider vinegar on hand so I used Japanese rice vinegar instead and marinated only the chicken overnight. I even accidently forgot the bacon and it was good! I loved the pineapples. Will make again and again.

These are AWESOME! I marinated everything overnight except the mushrooms and pineapples. I added those about 2-3 hours prior to cooking. These are by far the best kabobs we've cooked!

EXCELLENT!!!  My husband and I loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to use Turkey bacon but it tasted great.  Next time I will probably marinade for longer than 1 hour and used fresh pineapple chunks.  These are going to be a hit at our next BBQ!

Fantastic.  My husband selected this recipe and I intially thought it looked boring but I really enjoyed these. I seperated the marinade for the chicken & vegies and marinated overnight, the flavour was wonderful. I also used button mushroom cut in half instead of the flat ones, they held there shape nicely. The bacon that I used was the regular thickness and it didn't crisp up, but in Australia crisp crunchy bacon is considered ruined. Next time will use fresh pineapple though, canned was too mushy.

Boy now this is good.  It is a lot of work but since my picky son loves them he jumps right in to help.  He loves rolling up the chicken in the bacon and placing them on the skewers.

Awesome! The flavor was great.  I put in red and yellow peppers, and red onion into the marinate along with the chicken. The only problem I had was the bacon didn't get crispy. I used thin or regular bacon, not thick cut.  I didn't use the green onions, and I added extra honey. We will be having these again very soon.  Thanks Angie

The marinade was great and basic. My local grocery store was out of green onions so I used half of a yellow onions and minced it. I also added onion chunks and green peppers and marinaded that with the mushrooms and chicken. It all tasted great. Next time I would omit the bacon. The chicken was great but the bacon made it seem fatty. I wasn't too sure about the bacon being cooked enough so I popped it into the microwave for a minute.

I made this for a Christmas Eve party as the appetizers, broiling them rather than grilling - then kept them in a crockpot on low to keep warm.  Everybody loved them.

The marinade was great!  I used fresh pineapple, red pepper, and mushrooms.  I made these in the broiler and overcooked the chicken slightly.  Other than my mistake, everything was great!

This recipe is good... BUT...  I marinated for a day, so the flavor really penetrated.  Definitely don't marinate for that long.  Also, if I were to do it over, I wouldn't marinate the mushrooms.  The bacon I used was too thick... and way too fattening.  By the end of this meal, I had a stomach ache from all the fat!  I recommend using low fat, thin sliced bacon.   Only marinate the chicken (which wasn't terrible) for an hour or two, and use plenty of vegetables to give your stomach a rest from the fatty meat!

This was a very good recipe.  I rank it at 4 stars.   

I doubled the marniade recipe as others suggested, using 1/2 over the chicken and the other 1/2 over the veggies.  I used green and orange bell peppers as well as cherry tomatoes in addition to the mushrooms.

I found that the kabobs took longer than 20 minutes to cook.  It was closer to 35.  

Thanks for such a good kabob recipe.  I will definitely be using this again!

The flavor on these was really good. I messed up on the bacon though - I used turkey bacon and didn't read the part about cutting it in half which would have really helped! The bacon didn't quite get crispy but overall, a great recipe and I'll definitely try it again. Loved the combo of pineapple, chicken, mushroom and bacon.

This was a great summer entertaining recipe!  We had company over for a BBQ and they loved it.  I made it exactly like the recipe says and I made coconut rice and a mandarin salad as a side dishes.  Very tropical meal, would definetly recommend!

I made this recipe on the 4th of July for a picnic and everyone loved it! I marinated the bacon with the chicken and the vegetables with fresh pineapple. I cooked the meat and the vegetables seperate like suggested and they were cooked perfectly. I will make this again and probably try some different veggies, Thanks!

This was fabulous. It did take longer to cook than 20 mins. But the bacon was done. I did as another suggested and doubled the mushrooms and marinated separately. I also added vidalia onions and was glad I had a pound of bacon because I used it all. Great recipe!

We really enjoyed these shish kabobs!  I bought a whole pineapple instead of canned & it was worth the effort & price.  Can't wait to have them again!

I made this for the first time with company on Father's day and it was a hit.  The bacon doesn't get real crisp though, so next time I will probably leave it off.  I also added green bell pepper and that was great!

These shish kabobs were wonderful!  The entire crowd loved them.  I did as others recommended - marinated the veggies and chicken separately and skewered them separately also, since the veggies cook much faster than the chicken.  To do this I doubled the amounts of the marinade ingredients.  I also used fresh pineapple instead of the canned, doubled the amount of mushrooms (because we love them!), and added green bell peppers.  I marinated the chicken for 2 hours and the veggies for 1 hour.  DELICIOUS!!

I tried this for the first time and had to triple the recipe to feed my guests. I was panicking in the morning, but by the time they were off the grill and in people's mouths - they were getting rave reviews.

I only made this recipe b/c a friend of mine had made it first and loved it.  I too thought it was delicious.  I usually leave bacon out of recipes, but I'm glad I kept it b/c it added a lot of great flavor.  This was a nice change from ordinary kabobs.

WOW WOW WOW :) 
I only changed a few things, and i'm not sure that it made any difference - this is a great recipe.  I didn't have any cider vinegar.. so i used half malt, and half plain vinegar.  I also used green pepper instead of pineapple.  WOW.. just amazing.. you have to try this recipe

I made this recipe for my husband's 30th birthday dinner and all of the guests were very impressed with my 'cooking skills'!!  I found this recipe to delicious with some wild rice and salad as a side.  I also put some green, red and yellow peppers on the skewers also and turned the heat on the grill onto low, cooking for 45 minutes so as not to cause a grease fire in my grill with all of the bacon grease.  Props to Angie for the recipe!!!!

Absolutely delicious! OK, I did change something....we don't like mushrooms so I used chunks of potato instead. I marinated the potatoes for about a half hour with the chicken. The flavor was excellent! This one will be made again for sure. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. I marinated the bacon as well as the chicken and mushrooms. The chicken was tender and full of flavor. I used fresh pineapple and these pieces disappeared like candy. This is now a "go-to" for weekday dinners.

Well ..... LOL, my husband burned them! We were able to save a few and what we tasted was GREAT! I'm gonna make them again so we ALL can enjoy them. I added yellow squash and red onions to the skewers and they really were yummy ~ even if we each only got one skewer, LOL.

I was not too thrilled with the flavor of this dish.  I thought that the marinade was a little bland even though I tried to baste the skewers as often as I could.  Thanks though!

Chicken and pineapple were a tasty combination. The bacon was so-so, as it didn't really get that crispy on the grill.  I would leave it off next time, which also makes it a much healthier meal.

used this recipe with deer meat instead of chicken, it was excellent. The bacon kept the deer from drying out and the flavor was great.

These are sooo good!I think I've made them about five times now!They are my husbands favorite recipe.Everyone who has had them raves about them!They're best when made with a good smoked bacon from the grocier's deli.
