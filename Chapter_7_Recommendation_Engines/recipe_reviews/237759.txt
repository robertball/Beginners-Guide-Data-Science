Gotta confess, these were surprisingly good without baking.  I didn't want to heat up the kitchen, so it seemed like a good enough reason to try this recipe.  If you've had baked beans at Steak 'n Shake, that's what these taste like.  Nice recipe chelee.

This was just ‘all right ‘ to me. It wasn’t me favorite that I grew up and love. It was all right just because it’s so easy and quick to make, but I’ll stick with my favorite family recipe and use this one when I’m in a hurry to get supper done and on the table. Hubby love loved it, so, for him, it’s a keeper recipe.

I made no changes.   These are the way I doctor up my beans, but without having to clean up the casserole dish after baking.  I will definitely make again.

I baked it for one hour at 300.  Delicious!  Very much like Steak n Shake.
