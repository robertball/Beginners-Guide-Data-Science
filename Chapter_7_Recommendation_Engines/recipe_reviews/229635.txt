Delicious! This is a colorful salad with a great combination of flavors and textures. Plus it's a great way to use up some leftover Thanksgiving turkey! For the dressing I added a little buttermilk to thin it out. I also opted to toasted walnuts vs. pecans as that's what I had on hand. I let the dressing set in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors blend together. Perfect with warm rolls and a glass of wine!
