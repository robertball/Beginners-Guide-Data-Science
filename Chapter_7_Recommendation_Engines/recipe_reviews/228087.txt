I have not made this yet but will very soon, looks great!!  Just wanted to mention to J Wurtman, don't give a low rating to a low carb dish for having too much protein and not enough carb.  There is never a "good time of year" to carb load.  Seek recipes that are not paleo or low carb.  It sounds like you didn't make the recipe after all so you should not even review it.

This is absolutely yummo. I am tired of the same old low carb meals and thought this looked good. It was beyond good! Unfortunately for me, the low carb didn't mean much because I went back for a second huge bowl so still had way too many calories. If you like Jambalaya, you will love this. I didn't have any shrimp so had to omit them ( Did not want to go to go to the store). Also, I had no Cajun spice so I made my own using a recipe from this site. That too was really good. This is a keeper. My husband loved it too. I will use this in future even for a non low carb and will use this recipe but just add rice to the pan (brown or white) and let it cook while it's simmering. This is in my recipe box and I will definitely use it again and again. Thank you Malory.

I made this recipe twice. Once as listed above and a second batch with which I tried to obtain a more traditional type of Jambalaya flavoring. The method as written is good, but doesn't really give it that La type of flavoring.

The trick in doing so is first to preferably obviously use a real jambalaya pot. If you don't have one, at least use a cast iron dutch oven or similar. It will make a difference.

I also varied it by using the method used here in La of browning a few rashers of bacon first in the pot and using the grease as the oil to brown the vegetables and chicken in instead of olive oil and butter. And do this over medium-high heat. To give it the more brown look I also used the normal method here of splashing in 1 TBS of Worcestershire sauce after browning along with about 1 tsp of brown sugar. It made a good variation this way.

I'd also offer the suggestion for those on a low carb diet for diabetic reasons that they add some navy beans or similar to absorb the liquid's flavor. Pre-soaked and partially cooked and then added to the pot after adding the broth will allow the beans to absorb the liquid and retain even more of the flavor. If you're on a low carb diet for other reasons (e.g. weight loss) then avoid the beans until you're well along in your diet as even if they do have a low net carb content, it isn't as beneficial for you as it is for those who are diabetic and for who the beans will lower their insulin requirement.

Awesome!  Such a nice change from the same ole' low-carb dishes!  For those of you giving this recipe one star because it has no rice, and therefore is not "jambalaya".... if you want rice then don't look at a low-carb recipe, and in the future do not rate a recipe based on its name, that is not the purpose of the rating system.  The only change that I made to the recipe was that I sautéed the zucchini, sausage, and shrimp together and added at the last.  Ummmm soooo good!

Really great! Added riced cauliflower for that familiar look and texture, plus it snuck in another vegetable for the kids as they pick out the peppers. Very delicious!

Are you freaking kidding me??  This was an amazing version of a Cajun classic.  I added okra and kale just to add some texture and yumminess.  Thank you so much Morgan for sharing this fantastic recipe!

I was looking for a low carb main dish to make and ran across this recipe.  Being a fan of Cajun cuisine, I decided to give it a try.  The only straying from the recipe that I did was adding more hot sauce.  Obviously heat is a personal preference, so I spiced it up to my liking.  Other than that minor change, I did exactly what was directed.  My opinion?  Phenomenal!  The flavors are amazing and the textures are distictly jambalaya.  You will not miss the rice!  My only suggestion is to double up on the recipe.  It makes a lot as it is, but you'll be wanting more!

In consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards and our heat tolerance level of "coward," I prepared a much tamed down version of this using just 1-1/2 tsp. of the Cajun seasoning, no hot sauce and smoked kielbasa; and both of us were pleased.  It's so easy to add more heat/spice if you want it, but impossible to take it out once it's there; the point being I would recommend seasoning this to taste.  I followed the recipe loosely, using the traditional "holy trinity" of green pepper, onion and celery, sweating the vegetables in bacon fat which leant a pleasant smokiness to the dish.   I also used fresh rather than cooked shrimp, adding them at the end, just for a few minutes, before finally adding the cooked chicken until heated through.  I loved the addition of the zucchini, which in the absence of the traditional rice, gave this more substance.  For those who still want the rice, like Hubs, it is easy enough to serve it on the side.  This was excellent.  It makes a ton, so we'll be enjoying a quick and delicious repeat tomorrow!  Note: this recipe begs for advance prep work, and I'm glad I did.  I found it very helpful to have everything chopped and measured (mise en place) ready to go.

Really tasty. I cut back on the green peppers since they don't like me. I used already cooked shrimp because it was 1/2 the price of the raw..

I made this for dinner last night with just a couple of changes and it was great!  Everyone, even my 1 year olds enjoyed it (I used less hot sauce so they could have it and just added more to taste after cooking).  I had to substitute smoked sausage for the andouille, and I added a bag of frozen okra, but everything else stayed the same.  I also served it with a side of cauliflower rice.  We will definitely have this again!

This is a great dish even if those nit pickers (including my sister) say it isn't jambalaya because it has no rice.  Who cares?  It is really good.  I realized at the last minute that I didn't have any zucchini so I threw in a can of okra and I added an extra can of tomatoes.  Left out the hot sauce (DH doesn't like hot stuff) and let everyone add it to their own bowl.  I also took the suggestion of another reader and served it with spaghetti squash.  All 5 of the people eating it loved it, and there was only a little bit left.  My sister begged the rest of it from me the next day for her lunch.  This recipe will definitely become a regular here, and I think I will try making it in the slow cooker.  Thanks, Morgan, for a great dish.

I have made this on the stovetop and in my slowcooker.  Here are a few things I do to get the calorie count even lower.  Replace olive oil in butter with Butter Flavor Pam and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.  Replace andouille sausage with Hardwood Smoked Chicken Kielbasa and also add turkey sausage. I also use a mix of both white and dark meat chicken to add variety.  Also since I am not crazy for shell fish, I use about half of the shrimp just for the fish flavor it brings in.  This is so easy to make, leftovers freeze well and it tastes wonderful!

This may not be the traditional jambalaya, but it is still very good nonetheless. To all the reviewers saying that if it doesn't have rice, it's not jambalaya, there are a few people watching their carbs these days. It's nice to have options when wanting traditional carb-laden dishes.

My husband and I have enjoyed this wonderful low-carb jambalaya for several years now, so I thought it would be fitting to be my first rating! I have used multicolored peppers when that was what I had, and always add a bag of frozen cut okra which jazzes up the flavor and vegetable count. We usually have it over a half-cup of brown rice. Thanks for this excellent,  healthful, delightful and filling recipe!

I love this stuff, but with some picky eaters around here I made some changes that are worth a try if you are looking for even more kick.  I replaced the zuccini and bell peppers with a small can of diced green chilis and small can of diced jalapenos.  I also cut the garlic back to about 2 1/2 cloves and used chicken sausage for a lower fat content.  We also skip the shrimp, but its up to you.  Prepare as directed, enjoy!

An amazing way to get the flavor of jambalaya without the unneeded carbs. I did not miss the rice at all! For those of you that insist on rating something . because it doesn't have an ingredient that you feel is necessary (rice) I would ask that you don't rate a low carb recipe based on that.  For those of you looking for a low carb option, this has a lot of flavor and is very satisfying! Try it - you will love it!

There are some very good flavors that get destryoed with the cajun seasooning and hot sauce.  We don't use them.  Besides the seasoning in the sausage, all we use is salt and pepper.  A little basel and pineapple sage is also very good in this dish.  We also add onions, cut back on the bell peppers to 1 and add about 4 jalapeno peppers (seeded and devaned, get all the white out.)  We really like the flavor of the jalapeno peppers.  We are also carrot lovers, so a couple of carrots get added too.  It makes a very wonderful meal enjoyed by all of my family, and some neighbors kids too.

I loved this! I saved this recipe for times when I want an interesting low carb meal but happened to use it when I had family members over.  I made it exactly according to the recipe but threw in some rice I had cooked separately at the end of the cooking time because of my company. Everybody thought it was delicious!  The flavors were complex and balanced.  The heat level was noticeable and almost on the edge for those who aren't accustomed to spice; for those of us who are, the heat was perfect - tantalizing, yet did not compete with any other flavors in the dish.  I am looking forward to trying this again and I won't change a thing.

I made this just as instructed, and we loved it. I split half of the jambalaya up and put it in baggies and froze for lunches. Also, I mixed and used Allrecipes' "Cajun Spice Mix in A Jar" which is handy because I will be making this regularly!

I live in New Orleans where jambalaya was born. If you are on low carb diet I suggest you also put in it brown rice. All Jambalaya is cooked with rice always. sometimes pasta.

We are dieting and I found this lovely recipe. It was really, really good and gave us the flavors of Jambalaya that we love. Made exactly as written but did use chicken andouille sausage. Thank you so much for a recipe that helps us keep the weight off while keeping the taste. . . and it was quick and easy to boot.

Too much protein. During the darkening days of the fall, I like to eat carbohydrates for our evening meal. I made the recipe using long grain rice , eliminated all the protein , and added the spices and vegetables . It was real comfort food. This recipe would be better in the late spring when the need to eat carbohydrate is decreased.

My carb-loving DS said he didn't miss the rice!  This recipe is packed with protein, and I didn't find the 2 Tbs. of Cajun seasoning too much.  I omitted the hot sauce, but I'm tempted to add it next time.  I used 2 green peppers and added 3 stalks of celery.  I used a 14 oz. package of andouille, and with the other meat, it was enough.  There were only 3 other minor additions:  fire-roasted tomatoes instead of plain; the addition of about 1 1/2 cups of diced okra; and 1 can of chicken stock instead of 1 cup.  I don't think my changes affected the flavor in a major way.  For a quick soup, this is a great recipe.  Thanks!

This was an easy to make, filling, and delicious recipe.  I have 3 children (2 of which are wrestlers trying to cut weight, so balancing meals can be a chore) and all 3 said that it was a keeper with no leftovers in the pan.  The only thing I did differently was omit the green peppers because I find that they sometimes have an overpowering flavor, used the cajun spice to my family's flavor,  and really put my own twist on the serving suggestions for the quantity of meats to add.  Used smoked sausage instead.  It was delicious!!!

The flavors were all excellent, but why call it Jambalaya when there's no rice? I am watching my carbs, though, and this was pretty good, but I was VERY tempted to add some rice! LOL

Oh my - we loved this!  I rarely make a recipe without tweaking - but made this as written (except for using Italian sausage since that was all I had).  My husband, the ultimate carnivore, inhaled it.  I loved the high protein and low carbs (no rice for me, alas) and the flavor was outstanding for such a healthy dish. This will definitely be a repeat!

The recipe is great but, when I change the servings and add it to my recipe box it always comes out in the original size serving. Can I do anything about this?

I read some of the reviews before I made the recipe, so I added riced cauliflower, 2c. okra, increased the chicken broth to 3c, increased the Cajun seasoning to 3T, and increased the shrimp to 1 1/2 lb.  My chicken-hating husband had 2 large servings [I left the chicken at 1 lb], our 21-yr-old grandson who lives with us had 2 very large servings, & I had a bit more than my usual sized 1 serving.  Everyone loved it!!  I'm trying to decide if I want to make a double recipe next time & divide it before I bring our supper for that night to the table.  It's so good fresh I'll really have to thing about doubling it so I can put the saved half into a vacuum heat-sealed bag to have a delish supper in the freezer.

It was great but looked nothing like the photo when I was done. It made a lot more than I thought. We will have jambalaya-ish, for a while. The things I did change was just a little less spice because heat doesn't go well here. Added to taste later.

Thank you for this delicious recipe! I'm new to low carb eating due to pre-diabetes and I have to change everything so I appreciate low carb versions of classic meals such as this one! The flavors in this are scrumptious and I don't miss the rice!

I made this as is - and used the Cajun Spice Mix  recipe from this site and it was quite spicy - but I also just shook the hot sauce bottle quite a bit, so there's that - but oh, this is so good. I am watching my carbs but was craving andouille (one of my favorite things in the world) and this totally satisfied that craving.  Normally, I would miss the rice, but I didn't.  I highly recommend making this as is. Thank you, Morgan for this fantastic recipe.

To be nice, I liked the recipe and it's is very filling. Nevertheless, IMHO there is room for improvement. Next time, I'll choose two meats instead of using all three and to make it more traditional, will add celery and maybe okra. I love fresh ingredients, so I started with uncooked andouille, uncooked chicken and uncooked shrimp. This made prep a fairly tedious job. Unfortunately, the end result didn't match the effort.

Low Carb Jambalaya Haiku: "Didn't use the shrimp, but did the rest all the same. Husband needed rice." Made ours with a Cajun chicken sausage and some cooked, shredded chicken that I'd had frozen, along w/ the chicken broth that had been frozen from said cooked chicken. Didn't bother w/ the shrimp, so followed the recipe's other ingredients and instructions, keeping the Cajun seasoning to a little less than half called for as young tastebuds were eating it too. Despite that I had to make a side of rice to appease to carb-happy husband, I thought this recipe on its own was pretty fantastic, but if I'm not mistaken, doesn't jambalaya also need celery?

I just made this recipe tonight and loved it.  I tend to like more spicy dishes so revised this recipe by doing the following -   doubling cajun spice, added 3 t. hot sauce, and used san marzano peeled plum tomatoes, chopped, 28 oz.

Delicious! I used Italian sausage because that was what I had. I cut up a large chicken breast and cooked it right in the soup. I served it on polenta.
My husband and I loved it!  Will make it again.

This was great ! I've made it twice so far. I only used sausage because that's all I had. I didn't use all the spice since my family doesn't like it hot. I added old bay and a little Cajun seasoning and used frozen peppers and onions for quick fix. It was wonderful and even better the next day.

This was very good.  Everyone loved it.  Because we are cutting fat and calories, I used Turkey Italian sausage, which went well with the spices and hot sauce.  It gave it a nice contrast. Also, instead of the green peppers, I used orange peppers which are sweeter and more flavorful.   Because I wanted more contrast, I added a slight more hot sauce.   Awesome!

Great recipe.  Love Jambalaya, but with a diabetic in the house it hasn't been on the menu.  Tried this today and we all loved it.  Stayed pretty close to the recipe as listed. Was a bit overenthusiastic with the cajun seasoning, but it was still great. Changes for next time would be different colored peppers, and a yellow squash, just to liven up the colors a bit. Didn't miss the rice at all, but then I'm not from Louisiana.

Being from Louisiana, I agree with Chuck.  I'd omit the zucchini and add brown rice instead.  Also, it's either chicken and sausage Jambalaya or seafood Jambalaya.  The tomatoes should be optional and there should be a roux somewhere in there.

This was my first time making Jambalaya. I added brown rice(yum) and only used 1 bell pepper and 1 large zucchini. I use a little extra crushes tomatoes and chicken broth. Amazing!!!?? Enjoy!!

This was a HUGE hit! I hate rice (I may be the only person in the world that hates rice, but I can not stand the texture), but I LOVE cajun food. I used to always pick the good stuff out of jambalaya, but this recipe is waaaaay better! Plus, it's really easy! I will be making this a lot! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!

Wonderful. Used chicken legs, and fresh tail on shrimp cooked in the sauce ....used choriso because i didn't have any andouille...yum. used a cajun spice recipe from this site. Excellent meal - maybe not exactly authentic... but totally wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing this!

This was very good and even better after it sat for a day or two. Next time I will substitute chorizo in for the andouille sausage only because it was a little too spicy for my family. I also used a mix of green, yellow and red (sweet) peppers as I prefer that.  We do not eat a lot of carbs, so this was a perfect high protein delicious meal that fits our lifestyle perfectly. My family loved it!

I made this for my very traditional men (husband, son, and son in law) and served it over spaghetti squash.  They loved it!  I have made it several times since and it is even better the next day as a leftover.
Made it without onions since my son in law doesn't like them, but still yummy!

Love this recipe!  Doing the low-carb thing today and am really enjoying this as I write.  I like the combination of the adouille, chicken and shrimp and the spiciness of adding Tony's creole to the dish. 
Alterations- 
positive- added 1/3 of brown rice that only added 15 grams of carb
       added some okra which seemed fitting
       used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning
negative- added too much okra- whole bag
       added too much stock-about 2.5-3 cups
Even so, the dish was excellent!  Yummy Morgan!  Thanks!

I think I made an "operator error" on this recipe. We had plenty of left overs, but my wife told me she was not going to touch it again. The only variation was that I used spicy Italian sausages from a usually good local source. It was POW, in your face. Sorry, my fault. I don't think she will let me try again.

This was delicious. I used only about 1/4 of the recommended measurement of the hot spices, and it was still plenty spicy for us.

This was delicious.  Having become very tired of our low-carb diet, we needed something that really satisfied.  This fit the bill perfectly.  On the spicy side for some of us, but others loved the heat!  Thanks for a great recipe.

So good! I made it exactly as instructed & it was the best low-carb dinner I have tried by far! The only problem is that it may be too good, making it easy to overdo it. (low carb ? no carb).

Made this for the first time and it turned out amazing! I only used one green pepper because my husband doesn’t really like them. I also added corn, used 4 of the sausages, and more chicken broth then called for. I’ll definitely be making it again!

I have made this several times and it’s just wonderful!  Only substitution I make is adding frozen sliced okra instead of the zucchini. Wonderful flavor and so different from the usual low carb recipes!  I serve it over cauliflower rice, and cook real rice for the carb eaters in the family. Everyone loves this dish!

This is a keeper!  Made it exactly as presented using the Cajun Spice in a Jar recipe on this site.  Served it over Cauliflower rice.   Husband asked if we could have the leftovers the next night (which never happens....he's not big on leftovers) and I think it was even better.  Thank you for sharing!

This was, in a word, amazing. I was out of hot sauce so added a sprinkle of cayenne. So, so good. Might use stewed or diced tomatoes next time for a twist but would make it again as written too. Didn’t miss the rice one bit.

Very good! We are on a no carb diet and needed something new. Is a 2nd helping meal. We didn’t miss the rice. I used Kielbasa sausage & boneless skinless chicken thighs. Didn’t make any other changes.

Wow!  I thought this was a great recipe.  I cooked a chicken breast and then the shrimp, both lightly seasoned with Cajun seasoning.   Then followed the recipe,  with the exception of using 1 green, 1 red , and 1 yellow bell pepper and a can of diced tomatoes instead of the crushed (it's what I had).    LOVED it, as did my husband.  I will definitely make this again.

I usually follow All-Recipe recipes exactly. But I make a great traditional Jambalaya with rice using the recipe I got from a famed New Orleans chef, Austin Leslie. So I transposed his ingredient choices into this one and ended up with a very good low carb version.

First, real New Orleans dishes usually start with what they call the Holy Trinity. That's onion, celery and  garlic. So just add a cup of chopped celery to the onions when you sautee them.

Instead of crushed tomatoes, Austin used canned whole plum tomatoes. But for extra spice, drain 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes with chiles. Works great and  tastes better. Austin doesn't use bell peppers...I used one.

For people who can eat carbs, this is even better spooned over rice. I love having the option to eat it either way.

Tasty and hearty. In addition to carbs, I'm avoiding pork so smoked turkey sausage and extra hot sauce filled in for the Andouille. I had no zucchini but I do have a bad cold so I substituted frozen okra, which I prefer anyway, and I didn't have to run to the store. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I made this, but, cut down on the cayenne, as the hot, spicy food doesn't totall yagree with her. The recipe still turned out great and we'll make it again.

Quick and delicious. I was short 1 pepper and used celery instead.  I used raw shrimp and added just at the end to cook.   
Everything else was the same.  This will be part of our "cook often" dishes.

Very good.  I added frozen cut okra and a bag of riced cauliflower.  Used a 28oz can of tomatoes to absorb the extra ingredients.

This recipe is fantastic!  I bought raw chicken breasts and shrimp and cooked them ahead of time using the cajun seasoning for added spice.  I also added extra hot sauce (used Cholula- my favorite).  It turned out nice and spicy.  My kids loved it!  Definitely will make again.

Wonderful flavor, filling, and easy to make. Using pre-cooked shrimp and chicken speed this up and made the cooking easy. I will make again.

As someone from Louisiana, never put shrimp and tomatoes in a Jambalaya. 

For a breakfast favorite, try Gritalaya. Jambalaya with grits instead of rice!

So savory and delicious.  Prepared this with a good foody friend this evening. We left out the bell pepper and added carrots. We were wondering how the zuc would hold up and it was a nice addition to this non traditional Jambalaya recipe. this recipe will definitely be shared around with friends and family

We loved this! I was searching for something hearty and filling while doing keto as my husband gets discouraged when our dinners are a little lighter (makes you more prone to want to snack). This was very filling and excellent flavor. We had plenty of leftovers which was great for lunches. My children age 7 & 10 don't like a lot of spice so I scooped them a bowl before I added the creole seasoning!

I made this recipe for my wife and I and pretty much followed it to the tee with only a few small exceptions I can think of. The only things I changed, were the hot sauce, and chicken. I instead used 1 tablespoon of chipotle chili powder. It gave it an extra nice kick. I also used raw, unbreaded chicken tenders instead of chicken breast. But this recipe did turn out great and tastes great. Also, the directions are misleading. They do not tell you to cook the chicken and shrimp ahead of time, and instead just assume that you either have cooked the chicken and shrimp, or are using pre-cooked products. I cooked the chicken and shrimp in together on low heat using kosher salt, black pepper, and Cajun seasoning.

After making it I was questioning how it would taste...... but !!! This stuff is great!! Mine packed a punch and was sooo yummy. It’s great for all those low carb diets out there and people trying to get in a lot of protein. I added mushrooms to mine and made it with red and orange peppers instead of green. Mine made 12 cups total and a 3 cups serving only has around 400 calories and over 50 grams of protein ????

This jambalaya was incredible. You definitely don’t miss the rice! I found it took a lot longer to simmer off the liquid than the recipe suggested, but the longer is simmers the stronger the flavors so it’s definitely worth the wait. I may add celery next time but it’s not needed, this is a very hearty and filling dish.

Careful with the Cajun seasoning.  it was the perfect amount of spice for my boyfriend, but too spicy for myself and the 10 year old.  While it burned so good, it will be perfect next time for us with less spice.

I have had original Baton Rouge style jambalaya in Louisiana many times.  And although this recipe isn't nearly as complicated as the original family recipes , it's a great quick alternative!
I'm a big low to no carb cooker and look for new recipes all the time and this was perfect!
I didn't have a few of the ingredients and had to substitute the best I could.
I used mushrooms and red and green bell pepper,  instead of zucchinis.  And turkey sausage, and frozen shrimp from trader joe's.  I didn't have any chicken so just added more sausage and shrimp.
I also didn't have cajun seasoning on hand so just added my own seasonings separately:  salt, ground pepper, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, dried basil, and smoked paprika.  
It was more soupy at first, but I simmered it for a while and was just the right amount to serve with brown rice, which absorbed the liquid and made it so flavorful!

This recipe should remain untouched in regards to its ingredients. I would make it again in a nano second.

I made two mistakes while making it.  The first one was not taking off the brown paper that was on the Andouille sausage and the second was forgetting to take the shrimp out of the freezer and waiting for it to thaw out before I put it in the pot.   The jambalaya had a real good flavor and I will be making it again.  It's a keeper for us.

This is a GREAT low carb meal!  I've made this several times now and love it!  The only thing I did differently was use two cans of tomatoes and used red and yellow peppers instead.

I really like the taste so far but I'm simmering on the stove and will have for dinner tomorrow. I'm hooping the longer cooking time punches up the flavor profile!

Definitely not something to call Jambalaya but it wasn't bad.  A good bit of time and energy required to make it with all the veggies to cut up. I would call it a Cajun stew. I won't make it again.

So good!! I made it like a soup and in the crock pot added an additional 2 cups of broth and extra Cajun seasoning. Sautéed all meat and onions in pan added seasonings before transferring to crockpot. Highly for 3-4 hours

I tried it with Andouille sausage and with smoked beef sausage and I prefer the smoked beef sausage. With the Cajun spice, the Andouille is just too much flame on the tongue for me. Also, I like to add red, orange and yellow bell peppers in addition to the green bell peppers, a skimpy 1/4 cup of rice and skimpy 1/4 cup of orzo. This dish is absolutely awesome on cold winter days.  The spiciness warms you from the inside out. Love this recipe!!

This turned out great. Having just switched to a low carb diet I was looking for a good Jambalaya recipe and this worked. I did not change the recipe at all but made it as is. I also cooked some rice on the side for those in the family who were not doing low carb. It was a big hit by the whole family, what little leftovers there were were gone the next day.

Almost as good as Bubba's Jambalaya (my favorite but not low carb). Highly recommended.

This was very good.  I used only 1 TBS of cajun season, and used Smoked sausage.  I LOVE asparagus and Costco had fat ones so I thew a few in.  Otherwise, made as written! I used cauliflower bits in place of rice.  Cilantro would have been a nice addition

I have made this several times because I love it!  Once I added ham because I can't eat shrimp but usually I just use the chicken and chicken sausage.  I will also add whatever vegetables I have on hand along with the zucchini, onion and I use a red, orange or yellow pepper.  A key is the Cajun spice you use.  I found one that has 11 different spices in the mix and was organic.  I loved the flavor.

Delicious!  I changed it just a bit, due to personal taste and what I had on hand.  No shrimp, as I don't care for it.  1 1/2 lb of smoked sausage, 1 1/2 lb boneless skinless chicken breast meat, 1 large green pepper.  Everything else according to recipe.  Very very good.   Great spice.  Yes it's not really jambalaya, without rice and shrimp, but for those of us watching carb intake this is wonderful!  Thank you!

I love this recipe.  I have to admit that I take A LOT of shortcuts.  I buy the vegetables (already sliced/diced) from the grocery store freezer section....ochre often gets added too.  I buy a roaster chicken and the frozen no-tail shrimp.  All I really do is cut up the andouille sausage.  It assembles very fast and it's delicious.

Delicious exactly as written.  The heat and flavor were perfect for me and my husband.  I added an extra can of tomatoes and an extra cup of broth to it before my kids had it because they would've found it spicy.

Couldn't get andouille sausage so I used a pork breakfast sausage instead.  Used orange and red bell peppers along with the green to give some color.  I let simmer for longer than called for.   Honestly don't miss the rice so will be making again!  Delicious!

Only change was to add a little bit of okra (I like okra).  Outstanding flavor.  heats up great the next day.  Made this because my Wife is a diabetic and was put on a low carb diet.  I will make this again because it's just packed with flavor.

As the recipe is I would rate it three stars. To make it five stars I added a poblano, jalepeno and celery. What cajun recipe doesn't have celery? After the onions and sausage were done I added all the vegetables and cajun seasoning (slap yo mamma). After they browned a bit I added the liquid ingredients. I also made some cauliflower rice to put the jambalaya on. It's a little non-traditional and delicious. I'll be making this a lot.

This was really good!  I halved the recipe and instead of the crushed tomatoes and hot sauce,  I added a can of El Pato tomato sauce. My shrimp were almost prawn size and I used chicken andouille sausage from Trader Joe's.  I even added the zucchini although my DH professes to hate it.  Hmm, as he was devouring it, he said, "Look Honey, I'm even eating zucchini!"  AND, he requested the leftovers the next night, something that never happens!  When I make it again (and there will definitely be a next time!) , I'll leave the sausage in rounds and omit the chicken because it seemed to get lost  with the strong flavors of the shrimp and andouille.  Thank you Morgan, for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

Love this!!!! Make it at least once a week. Has great flavor and just the right amount of heat. If you really miss the rice try adding Green Giant Cauliflower Rice as a low carb substitute.

Stuck with recipe for the most part until I hit the Cajun seaning and I added more cause I like it when I get enough heat from a dish to make me sweat a little.  My daughter also loved and went back for second serving.  Will make again soon.

I could not rate this recipe high enough! My entire family loves it.  The only changes I make are that I add more vegetables than the recipe calls for, and I make sure to use low sodium tomatoes and chicken broth.  Also my cajun season of choice is Tony Chacherie's and it comes in a “lite” version which is less sodium than the regular version of the same.  If you can’t find it  in your store, it’s available on Amazon.

I did not follow the recipe too closely, as I also added yellow squash and asparagus, but this is the foundation of a great jambalaya. I also blanched my veggies before adding them to the sauce so they don't break down into mush. Since my family isn't big into seafood I omitted the shrimp and added more chicken. The last thing I changed was I used turkey sausage instead of the recommended andouille. The butter and olive oil helped the sauce since it lacked the fat from the sausage. Overall I love the spices and this was a great option for my dad who is on a low carb diet!

This is really one of the best recipes I have ever made off of Allrecipes. And I am a carb addict!  I am constantly looking for recipes foe my husband, who eats very few carbs. I appreciate this recipe being named "jumbalaya" to facilitate searching for low carb versions of familiar favorites. I didn't miss the rice one bit even though I was skeptical and prepared to add rice to my individual bowl!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I made this dish two ways at the same time.  One way was as the recipe was written.  The second omitted the sausage.  It took me about 30 minutes to reduce the liquid.  I did not precook the chicken or shrimp.  I cut up the chicken breasts into cubes and put it in about 20 minutes after adding all the other ingredients and put the shrimp in about 5 minutes later.   There were supposed to be 12 servings.  There were 8 of us and I was a bit surprised that there weren't any leftovers.  I must say the sausage did add a lot of flavor to the dish.  Good tasting low carb recipes are hard to find.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks for posting.

I found this recipe when I had gestational diabetes and white rice made my blood sugar rise. Now I make it about every other week even though I no longer have to worry about the blood sugar. I don't add the hot sauce, it is plenty spicy for me without. I follow the recipe exactly except I just add cubed raw chicken with the other ingredients just before simmering and I add raw shrimp just after the simmer and continue cooking just until the shrimp is cooked.  Also, my andouille comes in 13.5 oz. packages at my store and I just use that. Makes a LOT so I can have leftovers for lunch. So good!!!!

I cut the servings down to 4.  The amount of Cajun spice was too much for my liking, I even omitted the hot pepper sauce.  I would recommend decreasing the Cajun spice by at least half.  Hubby enjoyed it as I made it, even went back for seconds.

I loved this! Subbed turkey smoked sausage for andouille due to kid but, otherwise, followed it pretty closely (cooked my chicken in the pot vs pre-cooked). I was pleasantly surprised.

I deviated from the recipe in only one significant way, and that was to use Old Bay in place of the Cajun seasoning. It was very good. The leftovers froze well. This is a "keeper."

Used Old Bay seasoning for the Cajun and red and orange sweet peppers in place of green as that is what I had.  This is outstanding!  I served mine over cooked spaghetti squash "noodles" and the family had theirs over brown rice.  Really good and easy.

Loved it! Added way more hot sauce and seasoning, but that's my personal preference. Used johnsoville chicken andouille sausage. Very tasty, didn't even miss the rice.

Very tasty and I will make this again. My husband doesn't care for spicey so I cut back a little on the hot sauce and I thought it came out perfect. The only other change was that I used bratwurst as that's what I had in the freezer and also after frying the veggies according to directions, I poured everything but the shrimp into a crockpot and a few hours later added the shrimp. So good!

The flavors in this dish were great; I followed the recipe exactly. However, mine turned out REALLY salty! I'm not sure if it was the cajun seasoning or what. I served it over rice for myself just for preference but my husband at it as is and loved it. I had a hard time finishing the bowl because of the saltiness.

I love this as written! It's not true jambalaya and doesn't claim to be but it's a darn fine recipe! Dieting is hard enough. This dish makes it a whole lot easier!! Time saver: microwave the zucchini for 1:30 minutes then throw them in. I do raw shrimp and they cook perfectly in 2 minutes.

A few suggestions,  true cajun jambalaya will always start with the trinity (onion, celery, and bell pepper). So I cut back on the bell pepper and added the celery. I see where some folks said they served rice on the side but if desired, you could add 1/2 - 1 cup of rice. I love Uncle Ben's brown rice for a quick cooking brown rice.  Also, I add dice, raw chicken breast and raw shrimp the last 5 minutes of cooking  and let it simmer (you will probably want to cut back on the chicken broth to 1/4-1/2 cup since the raw meat will add extra fluid). This way the raw meat soaks up that delicious flavor and will enhance your dish!  If you can Chef Paul's Magic Seasoning  - Seafood Magic (you can purchase seasoning on-line, if you don't live in LA). This is an awesome Cajun Seasoning and low in salt. Also, we LOVE Conecuh Sausage, it comes from Alabama and you can find it here in the South.

Will be making it again! although I will be cutting the cajun in half, and leaving the hot sauce out again like I had. It was very good and seemed healthy enough, although with out rice to dilute the spice it was a little overwhelming.

I have made this twice and my husband LOVES it.  I like it a lot but he absolutely gushes over it.  I did not have cajun seasoning so I made some using a recipe from this website which turned out perfect.  The first time I made it as written but used green, yellow and red bell peppers.  The second time I used polish kielbasa and doubled the onions.  Both times it turned out delicious.  I so appreciate this recipe because it is low carb and so different from the low carb norm that I have become bored with.  Thanks for sharing!!

In our effort to eat healthier I scoured the internet for easy flavorful make ahead dishes with real food and low carbs. This recipe fit the requirements and Jambalaya is one of my husbands favorites. We have now made it several times and it's on our regular rotation. The only thing I do differently is to season the chicken with chipotle pepper spice before I cook it, just to amp up the spice. Also we add more spicy peppers, but we like things spicy!

This was delicious but extremely meaty. My husband, a serious carnivore, even thought there was a bit too much meat. The only change I made was to use 1pkg of cooked sausage as I couldn't find un-cooked in my grocery store. The flavor is fantastic and the two of us had enough leftovers for a second night of dinner.

This is a delicious meal. There is no rice because people who are following the low carb diet can't eat it. There are a lot of people out there like me who are glucose intolerant.

This was absolutely fantastic!  The store didn't have Andouille sausage so I substituted ground Chorizo.  Instead of zucchini, I used celery that was part of a mix which included the onions and green peppers too.  I also added a little Worcestershire based on other suggestions.  Other than not cooking off ALL the liquid, the rest of the recipe was followed exactly.  It was perfectly spicy (for me) and the flavors were just phenomenal.

This was the best low carb meal I have had in months! I followed the recipe almost complete (used ground breakfast sausage with hot spices instead of andouille) and served it with steamed white rice on the side for my family. Everyone loved it!! Good with a dollop of sour cream if too spicy ??

It's a great recipe that my husband and I greatly enjoyed while trying to cut down on carbs. There's a lot of delicious sauce that would benefit from something to absorb it, but tasty nonetheless.  Will definitely be making it again, with lots of extra spice...jalapenos, cayenne, and hot sauce.

The only change I made is that I added celery.  I served it over cauliflower rice. It was wonderful.  I will definitely make it again.

Used little smokies to save time. Used some butternut squash in place of some of the zucchini. Turned out great. Makes a lot, I will do half recipe next time.

Loved it!! Used extra peppers and onions, no other veggies. Also used more crushed tomatoes than recommended because I like mine very saucy.  Soooooooooooo good!! :)

Made this and did not change anything. One of the best jambalaya  recipes I've made and low carb. All the ingredients were wonderful with the perfect amount of Cajun seasoning. This is one we will definitely make again and again and again.......well you get the point.

This is a great recipe!  Like most stews, it's tastes even better the next day.  I added an additional cup of chicken broth and an extra zucchini.  The spice level is perfect!

Awesome!!!!  I left out the hot sauce, chose to have it available to those who wanted it.  It was still very spicy & delicious.  Served it over long grain brown rice.  What an outstanding meal!!

I have been going low carb and saw this recipe. I decided I had to try it after so many rave reviews, and I was not disappointed. I made it almost exactly like the recipe. I did use zucchini and yellow squash for color and also green and red peppers for the same reason. I didn't use the hot sauce, but I did use fire roasted crushed tomatoes. Oh my, it smelled heavenly cooking and the flavor was wonderful. This will definitely go into my favorites file. I will probably look over the reviews again and see if there is anything I might change due to your recommendations. I like the idea of adding a few more vegetables to the mix, the kale and okra sound great. I can't wait to share the recipe with my friends!

We tried this a couple of nights ago.  I made a double batch for four of us and my (adult) kids gobbled it all up! My 18-year-old son even asked for the recipe so he can make it himself.  I did substitute the green peppers for some red bell peppers, some jalapenos and red chiles for extra spice and because we dislike green peppers.  I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar/Splenda blend to bring out the flavors a little and cut the acidity.  I'm diabetic, so I didn't eat it with rice, but we made some white rice for the non-diabetics which was simple enough to transform it into traditional jambalaya. It was deeeelish!  We used an enameled cast iron pot on the stove top which worked really well. Yum.

this was delicious.. i scaled it down to 2 servings and served bf's over rice.. i ate mine straight up.. i forgot to add the olive oil and butter and just used the grease from the sausage (one of those breakfast links) to sautee the onion and garlic in.. didn't have canned crushed tomatoes so used the same amount of grated fresh tomatoes from our little plant.. only had yellow bell pepper so used that.. used old bay for the cajun seasoning and tapatio for the hot sauce.. had some leftover grilled chicken breast from the night before so the dish had a smokey component that we love.. ty for the recipe.. on a side note.. this is LOW CARB so of course it doesn't have rice in it

I fixed this for the family and they just loved this.  I omitted the shrimp and added pork.  I left out the sausage but the flavor still great.  The jambalaya overall had great body and flavor was all there.  I will fix this again but I will add the shrimp and the sausage and leave out the pork. Everything in the recipe was perfect.  Definitely no leftovers.

I've been on a low-carb diet for several months now and getting a little bored with my daily standards.  This recipe really spiced things up.  We made it as directed and it turned out great.  Seems like a really good base to mix up with other ingredients as others have done.  I don't really care about the critics that knock the recipe as not being true Jambalaya without rice.  Low carb and rice do not mix.  I don't care what it is called.  It is just darn good.  A plus... I finally found something good to do with a zucchini.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! So hearty & filling! I followed the recipe except I used red, yellow & orange bell peppers & 2 jalapeños. I added a little extra broth too. Thanks to whoever posted this. I don't miss carbs at all with recipes like this. I also made cilantro-lime rice for my hubby to accompany this dish since he's not eating low-carb!

I love love love this recipe.  Only thing I did was add the spicy sliced sausage which made it a lil too spicy, but my whole family ate it and loved it.  Next time (which will be next week) I will not add as much cajun spice.  Awesome recipe, very filling and very easy to make.

I used a can of Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Tomatoes and organic better than boullion chicken flavor. I'm really just putting this in here so I can remember because I think those two things make a difference in flavor. Greg LOVED it!

I made this recipe twice and it's been a hit each time! I never knew low carb could taste so good! I have a lot of picky eaters (my six year old) and she even ate everything off her plate including the vegetables. I will surely store this recipe

We've made this twice now and the only significant adjustments we made were to the serving size (to accommodate only two people) and the amount of cajun seasoning for personal taste.  Awesome both times, easy, hearty and quick!  Winning combo for a weeknight dinner.

Wow! Just the right amount of spice, made a wonderful dish!  I only had Italian sweet sausage and diced tomatoes, so I substituted for what I had in the kitchen.  Great recipe, will make again.

This was good, but WAY too salty for me. I only used half the Cajun seasoning (1 tbsp) and it was still super salty. The sausage and chicken broth adds to the salt content, so be careful when adding the Cajun seasoning. Taste as you go! I will definitely make this again using 1/4 or less of the Cajun seasoning called for. Maybe the recipe meant 2 teaspoons and not tablespoons??? I used Tony Cachere’s Cajun seasoning. I didn’t miss the rice, which was great for eating low carb.

This was wonderful. I did not miss the rice. I had to leave the spices out to make it kid friendly, and just added some frank's in my own bowl.  Will definitely do this again.

This recipe is great. I make it with a heavy load of jalapenos and habaneros. I love to make a double batch and then eat it for lunch all week. (single guy working long hours) It tastes good reheated and I have no guilty feelings about having large servings.

Awesome! A keeper for low carb. Did as one other said here by putting all in crock pot. Used  coarsely shredded cabbage rather than squash (added an hour before cook time was complete. Also added a couple of Serrano's as we love the heat!  Thank you!

I am on a low carb. diet. I did make a few changes, added about 2 Tab. of brown sugar, 1 Tab. of Kitchen Bouquet, and 2 Tab. of corn starch. It just needed a little extra flavor, and thickening. It was wonderful! Cheated just a bit on my diet, but not much!

I love this recipe! I have made it 3 times in the past month. My husband and I are following the Paleo diet and this recipe fits right in with that plan. My kids love this also. I make rice for my kids to eat with it. The chopping of the vegetables does take some time but it is well worth the effort! Thanks for sharing Morgan!

I know that this isn't TRUE jambalya but it's still really good. I made the jambalya, hubby made the rice. Instead of butter and olive oil, I used Pam, cutting the fat down even more. Next time, instead of white rice, I'm going to make quinoa. Not the same but healthier. Even the kids loved it.

Really good! I forgot to buy the Zucchinis so used Bok Choy instead. Turned out really good. Only suggestion would be to cut back on the Cajun Seasoning if you are not a fan of spicy food, I am however and loved the kick!

I was in the process of making this recipe on a cool Sunday afternoon, and some unexpected company dropped by.  I had been looking forward to eating it as I made it and was a bit disappointed because I didn't want to eat in front of my guests who had already eaten.  They both said it smelled so good they wouldn't mind a small bowl.  They loved it, I REALLY loved it and can't wait to make it again.  I followed the recipe as directed, except I did use a bit more garlic, which I prefer.  This was incredible and definitely a crowd pleaser for those who like a lot of flavor and spice!  Might be my favorite recipe off of this site ever.

I loved this, it was yummy. My husband liked it as well and I appreciate it is low card since he is diabetic. It was easy to make & flavorful! My only change was using 2 red & 1 yellow bell pepper in place of the green bell peppers. I really don't like green bell peppers.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed recipe except for using frozen squash and frozen red and green peppers.   I also added more hot sauce since my family likes heat!  My 22 year old son loved it and complimented me on it.  I will definitely make this again and again!

Very yummy, but 45 minutes my eye.  This takes forever with all the chopping and precooking.  Will make again but will have to plan way ahead.  Very tasty and diet friendly.

Just made a double recipe of this Jambalaya and we all loved it.  I've never had it before but had always wanted to try it.  Used our kids as the taste testors and it was a hit.  I didn't make it too hot because I knew the grandkids wouldn't eat it.  But my step-son said I could make this for him anytime!  Thanks Morgan...this is a keeper!

This was fantastic!!!  I am doing low carbs and I didn't miss rice one bit!  I used a bit of cornstarch to help thicken it but other than that, stuck pretty close to the recipe.

This is by far my favorite recipe! My husband and I absolutely love it!! I always make a huge pot and freeze it for easy meals. The only thing I add to it is some chopped up spinach for that extra healthiness! But this recipe is amazing. I recommend it to everyone!

Delicious!!!
I pretty much followed the recipe. Had 1 grren and one red pepper. Add whole ca of chicken broth so did not wasted 1/2 can. 
Was like thick soup. Excellent flavor. will definetely make again.
I also did not cook shrimp. I just added it in toward the end and it cooked fine.

I loved this recipe! Great low-carb alternative. I used red peppers instead of green; personal preference.  Didn't have chicken, so increased the andouille sausage. Next time I will make sure I have chicken and increase the shrimp.  Took longer to prepare and cook than listed - hence the 4 stars.  I will use this recipe througout the winter.  Thanks!

My husband and I both really liked this dish. It was great for a cold November night. The only change was that I did not add the hot sauce.  For us, the Cajun seasoning and Andouille sausage made for the perfect amount of spice. We are both trying to cut back on our simple carbs and this will be made many times throughout the winter.

Great low carb dish.  I substituted 2 cups of TSP (Textured Soy Protein) for the squash and used a healthy dollop of green tabasco as the hot sauce.
