I don't get the high review for this recipe.  If you're going to buy 3 POUNDS of beef, then you may as well buy FRESH parsley and oregano too!  I didn't really like these.  Firstly, these absolutely do not need 1 HOUR to cook.  By 45 mins mine were done, and dry at that. Also, if you're going to simmer them for 4 HOURS, there's little need to cook them in the first place, much less fully-cooked!  I tried these after they were baked and didn't like them. I've had frozen meatballs that tasted better - and are cheaper than making your own.  Secondly, and I've already mentioned this, but who simmers sauce with meatballs for 4 HOURS?  This recipe means that you have to start this at noon, so that it's ready by dinnertime.  In today's society, this doesn't work for the modern family. I'm a bachelor myself and I'm not hanging out all day babysitting my stovetop hoping that these bland things would be better after simmering for 4 hours. There are better recipes out there, and if I don't find one on here I'm going to create my own. "Italian Meatballs" indeed!!

I adapted this recipe and it turned out great!  I cut the recipe in half, reduced the spices and bread crumbs (about 2 tsp. each of the spices, 3/4 C crumbs, 1/2 package onion soup), and added 1 egg.  I then browned the meatballs on the stovetop and simmered them for about 20 minutes in two bottles of spaghetti sauce.  YUM!  I'm not sure why you would want to simmer meatballs for 4 or 5 hours - 20 minutes worked out well for me.  Whole thing took 45 minutes to make.

This recipe turned out very well and reminds me of the ones I grew up with as a child. I'm cooking a batch for my local Firefighters right now!

SingleGuyWhoCooks?  I guess your family didn't cook like this when you were little!  Good Italian meatballs are cooked first (oven or stovetop, although 1 hour is a bit long) before they're plopped into the sauce to simmer all day on the stove.  The sauce permeates the meatballs and just adds to their flavor. They can certainly be cooked quickly and served with store-bought spaghetti sauce, but meatballs just get better and better if they're allowed to simmer in the sauce for several hours.  (They're fantastic cooked a day or two ahead, too!  My meatballs will be served to the Firefighters in two days.  They've just come out of the oven and are sitting in my sauce where they will cool to room temperature and go in the fridge till Monday.  Reheating them will be fabulous!)

These were pretty good. I find using dry bread crumbs in meatballs tends to make them hard as a rock, so I moisten them with half cup of milk (stir well) before adding to the meat mixture, and they turned out very moist.  One hour in the oven was far too long, even though I make BIG meatballs.  They all burned on the bottom.   Not a bad recipe, just needs some tweaking.

I'm curious if the person who submitted this lives in high altitude as I am at sea level and the meatballs were done in 30 minutes and even then that seemed a bit excessive. I halved the recipe and changed:
Parsley to Italian Seasoning
Garlic to Garlic Salt
I also added salt and pepper pretty heavily.
Halving the recipe gave me about 15 meatballs, a pretty decent sized ones at that. I simmered them with sauce for 30 minutes and even before the simmering, the meatballs were not overly dry or crumbly, however, I will suggest you add 1 egg to the mix.
This is a good recipe simply because it is so easy to change ingredients as you go and can alter to taste. I'm keeping this one on file :)

I liked these meatballs but I feel like they're missing something!  I didn't use 3 POUNDS of beef...that's WAY TOO MUCH!  I used 2 lbs. and that made about 50 meatballs...WOW!  Maybe they need more garlic...or some onions??  I did not use the dry onion soup mix because I read that most people thought it was too strong.  DO NOT PUT THEM IN THE OVEN FOR AN HOUR!  I only had mine in the oven for about 30 minutes and they probably needed only 25 minutes.  No need to simmer for 4 hours...30 minutes is all you need.  Might try to work with this one a little.

It was EXCELLENT!! I followed the advise of AMFISCHER about cutting back on the spices, but the one thing that I changed was that I didn't brown the meatballs first. I simmered them in the sauce and I added basil, oregano, garlic salt, and crushed garlic and let it simmer for 45 minutes. IT WAS GREAT!!! The family loved it!

These meatballs were so overpowering with oregano.  Instead of 5 T. of oregano and parsley, it should only be 1 T.  Then, I would add 1 egg to help moisten the meatballs.  They ended up being really dry.  I will try them again with the modified ingredients and see if they taste better.

Like everyone else, I think this recipe needs a little tweaking.  I took cues from other reviewers and halved the recipe, added egg, reduced the oregano, omitted the parsley altogether, and cooked them for a grand total of about 30 minutes.  I thought they were a bit bland.  I'm thinking of using Italian bread crumbs instead of plain ones, and probably adding some extra garlic or maybe some garlic salt.  I think they will be Ok!
----------------------------
OK, I made these again last night with some variations and they turned out FANTASTIC!!!!  I used 1 lb 96% lean ground beef, 2/3 c. Italian seasoned bread crumbs, 2 cloves of garlic, an egg and 1/2 envelope soup mix.  Browned them in a skillet and my husband thought they looked a bit dry, so we put in about 1/2 c. water and covered the skillet for about 10 minutes.  They were completely cooked through, very moist and delicious!  No need to put them in the oven at all if you are in a hurry (we had just come home from the gym and we were starving!).  Will definitely make these again.

My meatballs turned out great, but I gave this recipe only 3 stars because I changed some things.  I cut out the garlic, used fresh oregano and added fresh thyme.  I didn't have dry bread crumbs so I used fresh.  I also threw in some parmesan.  I was afraid of dried out hard meatballs so I baked them at 400 for 25 minutes at which time they were fully cooked through.  I simmered them in the spaghetti sauce for maybe 10 minutes until my noodles were done boiling.  Turned out to be a great meal though!!

I made these today and was very sucessful with just a few additions and changes...  First off i cut the recipe in half and I use ground turkey (85/15) instead of beef.  I added, about 1/4 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, and some chopped onion (because i didnt have any soup mix on hand) to 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. I baked them at 350 for no more then 25 minutes then put them in my favorite spagetti sauce to simmer for 3 or 4 hours or so.   And yes simmering them for this long is very important for both the meatballs and the sauce.

I totally disagree with browning the meatballs first.  My Italian husband NEVER does that. If you want good, moist meatballs - it's worth the time to add them to the sauce (raw) and slow cook them about 3-4 hours. You do have to be very careful when stirring the sauce so as not to destroy the meatballs but I tell you it is SO worth it.  We also don't use the extra spices or onion soup mix - just the ground beef, 2 raw eggs and the seasoned breadcrumbs.  'Course we never use jar spaghetti sauce either...  that's blasphemy in our house!

I decided to try this recipe and it was a winner. I skipped the onion soup mix since I didn't have any and used a diced up onion and some diced celery to add to the spices for flavor and it was perfect. The main point here is like some of the other reviewers said, the point of cooking the meatballs in the sauce for four hours is FLAVOR. If you just cook this recipe without the simmering in the sauce part they are okay, but if you allow the flavor from the meatballs and sauce to blend in the slow simmering process they are show stoppers. People who would normally be full with two large meatballs would stuff themselves with three or more of these they tasted so good. A keeper.

Delicious!  I added two eggs so that the meatballs would stick together better.  The amount of seasoning is perfect. I did not make as a spaghetti but used the meatballs by themselves in calzones.

This recipe was my very first stab at meatballs, and I made them for my boyfriend's surprise 30th birthday party 4 months ago.  People are still raving about them!

I honestly have no idea why anyone would like this recipe. 1st of all, 3 lbs of meatballs is ridiculous. I paired it down to 1 lb, and reduced all the other ingredients accordingly. I cooked them for 45 minutes (1 hour would have made them really dry), and only cooked them in the spaghetti sauce for about 15 minutes, because again, 1 hour is just too long... they would have fallen apart. When they were done, the meatballs were way too herby, and the onion soup mix didn't really go with the Italian seasonings. Very mediocre recipe, and would have been awful if I'd have followed the directions.

Followed recipe, except for oregeno/parsley, used dried Italian Seasoning.  Bread crumbs did seem to be a lot, and took quite a bit of kneading to blend.
Meatballs were done in 28 min.  Took out and added 1/2 of the meatballs to sauce already simmering.
Very good recipe.  So much easier than standing over a stove and cooking.  Froze leftover meatballs for an even easier dinner next time.
Thanks!!!!

What a disaster.  I halved the recipe, used less than half of the spices (substituted a little basil, too,), and didn't use seasoned breadcrumbs.  They still appeared overly seasoned.  But that's not the worst.  The recipe says an hour in the oven at 350, so I popped them in and got my son in the tub.  After 20 minutes, the smoke alarms were going off and I had little dry balls of meat that were starting to burn on the underside.  I'm still tossing them in the crockpot with a ton of sauce, hoping that gives them some moisture back and makes them edible, but I won't try this recipe again.

This is good, just read the label on the dry onion soup before you buy it. Mine had MSG, so what I will do next time is just chop up a fresh onion or two.

I made this recipe as written.  The only thing I did differently is I only cooked them for 35 minutes.  Next time I will add more garlic.  Other than the cook time, really good recipie.  Thanks for posting it.

The recipe was very easy.  I think an egg would have helped the meatballs stay together better, especially if they are to be cooked in spaghetti sauce.  If an egg is not to be used, another suggestion is to use less bread crumbs.  The meatballs were cooked after only 40 minutes.  If cooked any longer they would have been too dry.  Soaking them in spaghetti sauce overnight helped make them more moist.

We absolutely love this recipe! I use fresh home-grown herbs and homemade tomato sauce. Being cheese lovers, I add some shredded hard cheese, like Gouda to the meat mixture. I bake my meatballs in my meatloaf pans, so they don't sit in any grease, this way I can buy whatever grade of ground beef is on sale ;) These are the only meatballs we eat now!

These are fantastic meatballs with great flavor.  I reduced the amount of bread crumbs slightly, as the amount called for sounded like they would dry them out and it was a good call.  Excellent flavor and pretty easy to make.

Yes, I tried it.  The cooking time is way too long.  An hour on the meatballs in a 350 degree oven would bake them to a crisp.  I tried 25 minutes and they were too done.  Also, it needs moisture.  Very dry and cooking four hours in the sauce is not even a little bit wise.  Whole thing was not a good recipe.

I used this recipie for our Super Bowl party in Febuary I made meatball subs with them they were excellent I used more garlic than the recipie called for and used a 1 1/2 ounce scoop to have bigger balls for the subs. Instead of simmering on the stove I placed the sauce after bring to a boil and meatballs in a crockpot on low setting for the 4 hours then switched to warm they stayed wonderful and warm and available to my guests for the entire game I frooze some of the meatballs that did not fit in the crock pot and just used them last week with spaghetti they were still wonderful after being frozen for 2 months. I will definately use this recipie again.

this recipe is awesome, made fantastic meatballs. tasted just like my grandma's meatballs. finally fully got her recipe for spaghetti down packed, thanks so much for this recipe. and i agree 4 hours of simmering is so great, when i make spaghetti i always simmer the sauce all day long slowly adding new ingredients each hour. once the sauce is ready at supper time the taste is more than words could ever express.

Pretty good. However to make these meatballs great I made a few changes.First I only used 1 1/2- 2lbs ground beef and that was plenty for alot of meatballs.Also I cut the spices,breadcrumbs, and onion mix in half.I did add another clove of chopped garlic for flavor.After baking I let simmer in homemade sauce for a couple hrs.

I tried this recipe out b/c I forgot to add the meat to the sauce and my husband won't eat anything unless there's meat in it. I had never tried meatballs b/4 but these were amazing! And they were easy too. I combined all of the dry ingredients first and then mixed in the ground beef by hand. I baked them a little long, which made them have a crunchy coating. When I took them out, they were the perfect finger-food! We were tempted to throw all the spaghetti out and just eat meatballs! 

Oh, here's a tip: I didn't have any bread crumbs at hand so instead I used some Pepperidge Farms Stuffing that comes in the bag. This worked great and gave a good consistency with a hint of extra flavor.

These were quite delicious! The only thing I recommend is to not use so much onion soup mix because there are chunks of spices in there that are potent if not mashed up into to fine grains. I followed some of the reviews instead of the actual recipe verbatim. I used onion powder, garlic powder, basil leaves, an egg, plain bread crumbs and a package of onion soup mix. Only bake for 30 mins. and simmer in sauce for 20 or so. Not bad for my first time making homemade meatballs!

This was pretty good; I made it with 6 lb meat, 2 c bread crumbs, 1/2 c each oregano & parsley, 1 ts garlic powder & I added 3 eggs. They were done, almost overdone, at 25 minutes, though.

Mrs. B, the reason you thought they were missing something is because you left out the onion soup mix.  These were wonderful.  I used one pound ground beef, oregano and fresh parsley, 3/4 cup bread crumbs, one egg, one clove pressed garlic, and some parmesan cheese.  Cooked them on a George Foreman grill and simmered in one jar of marinara sauce.  Yummy!

Dinner was good. I followed the same ingredients but i did add an egg to make it stick better and I did cute down like the other reviews. I do agree there is something that is just not right. It was very filling though and it will be great leftovers.

I think there was a little to much seasoning.  Plus I have a son who is to impatient to wait an hour for a meatball so I used Olive Oil and a Hot pan and cooked them that way.

Way to much oregano.  These could be really good meatballs if you add a couple of eggs, parmesan cheese and cut way back on the oregano, way to overpowering.  Also the cooking time is definately to long, 25-30 minutes tops.  I will make these again, they definately have potential to be great meatballs but with some adjustments.

Tries this recipe.  changed alittle though I used 1 egg and added EVOO to the meat before I put it in the sauce.  I cut out the onion mix and used 1/2 onion instead. I then cooked it in the sauce.  Came out great.  Family loves it and they ask for it when they come over.

I only use 2-3lbs ground beef but reduced the spice amounts and added PARMESAN/OREGANO CHEESE:
3tbsp oregano, 3tbsp parsley, 3 tbsp grated parmesan/oregano cheese (Kraft makes this blend), 3 cloves garlic, 1 pkg onion soup mix and 1-1/2c bread crumbs.  I took the dry ingredients and blended them in a food chopper (kids only think they hate onions!) I mixed it with the ground beef and baked...but watched the timing very carefully...it DOES NOT take 1 hour more like 1/2 hour.  I put some of them in my sauce and let them simmer. (I froze the rest...it makes a lot more than 8 servings unless this is your main dish and even then it is a lot!) They were very good and I make them once a month to grab from the freezer for a quick spaghetti and meatball dinner.

I made half with onion soup mix and half without...most prefered without. I think t he onion soup mix was too strong over the rest of the herbs as an italian dish. The recipe was almost identical to my own just the soup mix was added into the mix. Im going to make the mix as a meatball appetizer at a party next weekend with an olive red sauce in a crock pot.

This recipe was pretty good, but the meatballs would have been rock hard if I had left them in the oven for an hour.  I would check them after 25-30 minutes for done-ness.

WAY to much on the seasonings!  While it was cooking it smelled like a bad veggie burger.  I love Italian seasonings, but this was a little overboard.  I learned my lesson in trying new things.

Didn't have even close to the amount of oregano and still turned out great. did 1/3 of the recipe and added a splash of milk for moisture. Definitely only needed about 20-25 min cooking time in the oven.

I always read the reviews first but this time I did not.   Big mistake!  They just came out of the oven (1 hour as directed) and they are dry and hard as rocks.  I cut one open and tasted it and all you can taste is the parsley and oregano, even over the soup mix!  I halved the recipe and put LESS seasoning and bread crumbs then called for as I thought as written was too much, and it certainly is!  I kept thinking I should add an egg or milk or something.. but I was trying the recipe as written.  This is not a good recipe.  My meatballs were on the large size and an hour was way too long.  And the taste is terrible.  I will keep looking!

I'm never making my old recipe again!  These were approved by my picky eaters, and I loved them too, as did most all reviewers.  So, like all recipes, modify as you need.  I used everything listed, corrected for 2 lbs beef, used 2-3 cloves bottled garlic, italian seasoning, and absolutely approve of the onion soup mix.  I kept wanting to add milk or egg, but you don't need it.  I made about 50 big bite-sized meatballs, and only baked them for 15 minutes.  Drained and used paper towels to remove excess oil, then put them into spaghetti sauce for 20 minutes--PERFECT!

Like others, I'm a little puzzled by the cooking time. Mine were starting to burn in 20 minutes. But overall a good basic recipe. I halved the recipe and added an egg and 2 tablespoons of prepared basil pesto (added moisture and flavor) and tinkered with the spice amounts a bit, but was pretty pleased.

The reason you simmer them for 4 hours is FLAVOR. Baking them in the oven ensures they are cooked through and browns them which is a personal flavor preference.  I baked them and put them in the crock pot for 4 hours and left them there through a party. The only downside was that I had no leftovers. This recipe isn't meant for a weeknight "in today's society".

I think the onion soup gives this meatball a strange taste, the 2 cups of bread crumbs makes them quite dry and they only take about 35 to 40 minutes to cook, for them to take an hour to cook they would have to be HUGE meatballs.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe. I did add a few things like additional garlic and onion, but I also added 2 eggs and some parmesan cheese. It smelled so good when it was cooking.

Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were great.  I only cooked them for about 45 minutes, and simmered them in the sauce for about 30 minutes.  My husband really enjoyed them.

I thought these were great - I made them with turkey instead of ground beef, so they weren't quite the same, but still good.  Like everyone else, I didn't cook them as long as the recipe called for, especially since I was using ground turkey (which is drier).  I would halve the recipe next time because it makes an outrageous amount of food.

I tried this recipe twice and had to say it wasn't the greatest on the first attempt.  I modified the ingredients like others suggested the second time and it came out much better.  Also, I only let it simmer for 25 minutes, otherwise, they will be hard as rocks.  Sorry.

Although the recipe was easy to make, the meatballs came out crumbly. Also, I cut back on the amount of seasonings. The second time I made them, I added egg and it came out alot better. The meatballs were done well before the 1 hour cooking time. Mine were done in about 40 minutes.

I also changed this. I cut the beef in half only used 1 cup of Italian bread crumbs. Cut the Italian seasoning down to  1 1/2 tsps.  Added two eggs. Used 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp garlic powder. Left out all the other ingredients. Baked for 30 min then added to crock pot in sauce for 4 hours.  They were great!!!

Really good.  I tried another meatball recipe (using a crockpot) from this site and  think these are better.  Couple things...

1.  The meatballs most definitely do NOT need to bake first for an hour. Mine were done after about 30 min.

2.  I substituted 5 TB of ITALIAN SEASONING instead of the 5 TB of dried oregano and 5 TB of dried parsley.  

3.  Next time I might cut back on the breadcrumbs because the meatballs seemed a bit dry after baking them.  However, they got moist again after simmering them in the sauce. I stopped after 3 1/2 hours rather than  4.  

I Would definitely make them again.

Made in advance, froze for later.  Easy, 1/4 cup measured meatballs produced 30 meatballs.  Next time I'm doubling the recipe so there will be more for my freezer!

I would have rated it a 5, but I made several changes to suit our needs. I substituted ground pork for the beef and a can of  crushed tomatoes for the jar of spaghetti sauce. I used fresh parsley and basil and put it all into a loaf pan for meatloaf. Thanks for the super recipe!

My family of four loved these meatballs, served with spaghetti, I rated them a 5 star -  and yes, I made some slight changes BUT it is the basic recipe that is just so good. I added an egg, because I couldn't envision meatballs without an egg mixed with the beef.  I covered the meatballs in V-8 juice and baked them in a 9x13 glass pan for 40 minutes at 350F (I guessed at the baking time and they turned out just fine.)  I opened a jar of pasta sauce (just pick one from your grocery store shelf.) I heated the sauce and everyone just picked up the meatballs from the 9 x 13 pan with a slotted spoon and put the pasta sauce on top.  BUT make no mistake, it's the  initial combination of seasonings to the beef that make these so perfect.

I have to eat gluten free so we changed a few things. We added turkey sausage, changed the onion soup mix to diced onions, & used gluten free bread crumbs. I am Italian so we make our own sauce. I recommend this!!!!

My half version.
Half beef.
Half pork.
Used fresh Onion, Garlic, Parsley, Basel, and Oregano.
Don't forget the eggs. I used 6, maybe 1 egg per pound would be better?
And moms old trick, Ritz crackers large zip lock bag and a rolling pin.  Best bread crumbs ever! 
Seared the meatballs on all sides in a cast iron skillet,
then baked in half the time.
After 20 min's in the oven added the sauce, that I started simmering before making the meatballs.
Time to boil the water and everything is ready at the same time :).  Enjoy.

I added an egg which made the meatballs not fall apart. Didn't need to simmer long and used ground turkey instead of beef.  Family loved it!  I would suggest using a third less ingredients for the meat.

Too big of a recipe for my uses and halved everything.  Also substituted half the ground beef with ground Italian pork sausage.  1 egg was added so the meatballs handled and cooked better without falling apart.

This was a good recipe, but I made my own changes as I went.  I added two eggs, 1/2 cup of milk, decreased the breadcrumbs to 1c and left out the onion soup mix.  Turned out great and the husband loved it! :)

Good recipe.  Easy to make.  I browned the meatballs in a large pan on the stove and added fresh homemede marinara to it after they were browned and simmered until the meatballs were firm.  I was trying to save time doing that and they were still very nice even though I did not cook all day like the traditional recipe.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and I was very disappointed. The meatballs fell apart in the sauce and the flavor was not very good. I will go back to my original recipe for meatballs made the italian way.

Tried this recipe but with ground turkey.  I added an egg and baked the turkeyballs for 45 mins.  Less fattening than frying and just as tasty.  My kids and husband really enjoyed it.  This is definitely a keeper!

Good meatballs, but definitely cook much less than an hour.  I went with 45 minutes and they were still a little overdone.  I also used someone else's suggestion of adding a little milk to the bread crumbs before putting them in with the meat and think it helped keep the balls moist.

These were great! This is definately not a "quick" recipe but I use it every week or so anyway (it makes my house smell delicious!). I reduced the oregano to 3 tb and added two eggs. Like others, I only needed to bake mine for half the time. I typically let mine simmer for about 10 minutes before serving but keep the extra meatballs simmering in a separate pot for the rest of the evening. This way I can have leftovers ready for meatball grinders or I can freeze some for later. They make any store bought sauce taste amazing if you let them simmer for at least an hour! This recipe is a keeper for our family.

These were actually quite tasty but I upped the spices (I like a lot of flavour). But I agree that one hour is waaayyy too long to cook these, and I could have baked them for twenty minutes and then simmered for twenty and they would have been more tender. Good on taste, too dry; no need to cook that long. I'll make them again but will keep the baking time to a minimum.

I found these to be very good. I followed all directions except I used crushed italian croutons instead of bread crumbs. I also cut the cooking time of the meatballs to 30 minutes. Husband loved them. I was very satisfied, especially since it was my first attempt at making meatballs.  Husband was dipping them in barbeque sause and eating them faster than they could cool! I then froze them so he could enjoy anytime.

I like to make this and make extra meatballs so that I can cook them and put them in the freezer.  The use them later for a quick weeknight dinner.  They re-heat great!  They make great meatball subs.

I only cooked the meatballs for half the time but they still came out to be like rocks. They had such a wierd aftert taste. I am not sure if it was too much oregano or the onion soup. I won't use this recipe again.....

This was my first time making Meatballs and they turned out great.  I didn't add or change any of the ingredients, as some people have suggested.  However, I did cook them for substantially less time than the recipe calls for.  I cooked them in the oven for 30 minutes and then I simmered them in sauce for 30 minutes.

easy and we use it with different meats. I love all the garlic and onion soup, it's a zesty little meatball. We have this not with spaghetti but with a white sauce.

If you prefer your meatballs tender I recommend trying another recipe. The quantity of italian seasonings in this must be an attempt to make up for the rock-like texture of the meatballs. And anybody who rates this as a quick fix is crazy, it takes over 5 hours to prepare!
