Great alternative to the bbq mini sausages. Kids and adults both ate this up. I made no alterations or substitutions. I served this as a main course but it definitely is more of a snack night item. Serving it as a main course weirded my family out. This is definitely not a sophisticated flavor but for the intention of this type of food, it was tasty.
