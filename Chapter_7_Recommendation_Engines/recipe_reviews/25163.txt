This recipe was okay but certainly nothing to write home about. It seemed to be lacking in something. I found it quite bland and would spice up the chicken if I were to make it again.

We ended up marinating the chicken in italian dressing and serving with italian dressing. We liked this very much! Hubby added the tri blend of italian cheeses (asiago, romano and parmesan). We used lettuce from the bag, what an easy dinner! We served with garlic breadsticks. Thank you for the post.

Not bad but just a little bit better than average for me. A true Caesar salad does not add all the extras that this recipe called for so I couldn't see adding them. Probably won't be making again.

If you don't have the lime marinade, try using this combination:  1/2 c red wine vinegar, 1/4 c soy (low salt), 1/2 c olive oil, 1 T parsley, 1 t basil and oregano, and 1/2 t pepper.

With it being so unseasonably warm here yesterday, I didn't want to have to heat up the kitchen so a salad seemed like the perfect dinner solution. After marinating my chicken, I seasoned it before grilling and made my own dressing. Just for fun, I took a page from Rachel Rays book and made fried ravioli to go on top. Hubby and kids loved this light and tasty meal. Thanks Paula!!

What a simple MEAL this was to make. I didn't have the right marinade but I  did use one from another chicken recipe which calls for italian dressing, lime juice and honey. I cooked the chicken on the george forman grill.  I used bags of mixed  salad. I added the warm chicken to the salad and also added some thawed out frozen peas. Will def make this again.

This was a great simple but tasty meal. We didn't add the extra veggie's, since a real caesar salad doesn't usually have them. But we marinaded the chicken for only 15 minutes and it was so full of flavor. We will definately be having this again.

We absolutely loved this.  I used Newman's Own Mesquite Lime marinade because I couldn't find Lawry's.  It was delicious!

I didn't buy the marinade. I made my own with virgin olive oil, 2 squeezed limes, kosher salt, and course ground pepper. I let that sit in the fridge over night. I then made it in the skillet. I didn't add the croutons, instead i made my husband and i lite garlic toast !

This was tasty. I did toss in some spare other veggies so maybe my mix wasn't traditional. It was a very good hot weather dinner.

Lime Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad Haiku: "Unusual mix, but the lime and caesar worked. Nice summer salad." I didn't know whether the lime/mesquite would compliment Caesar dressing, but this ended up being a tasty, easy salad. Not a big fan of croutons here, so skipped those. Salad consisted of romaine, baby spinach, cucumber, red onion, bell pepper and tomato (pretty faithful to the recipe) and I used Marzetti light Caesar (one of the only low-cal Caesars that tastes good.) Didn't have Parm so skipped that as well, although I'm sure it would've been even better w/ it.

My bf and I made this the other night for dinner and we both thought it was great. Simple, quick and different than a regular caesar salad which was nice change. Will make again!

Absolutely loved this recipe! I did edit it a bit however. Instead of using lime marinade, I used Italian Dressing. I used premade chicken and didn't marinate it. I made this with Italian Bread Wedges, and it was amazing! I've already made it twice! (:

Loved it! Easy to make, and even though it says it takes a lot of time, the majority of it is hands off, so you can do other things while making it. Delicious meal, pleased my picky family. Loved it!

I made it just as is, and my husband and I both thought it was very good.  I put everything but the chicken in a large bowl and mixed the dressing in with them.  Then divided it in two and placed the cooked chicken on top.  I also used a no fat Caesar dressing as my husband has heart disease.  This was a great light summer meal!
