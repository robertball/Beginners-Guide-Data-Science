My Maman was from Belgium & taught me to make fries this way.  Only difference, she used peanut oil because it is lighter tasting & you can crisp better & quicker because you can fry with peanut oil at a higher temperature.  Peanuts originally come from India and peanut oil (a mono-saturate & therefore healthy) is the oil of choice for woks & other frying & saut√©ing in Asia & Belgium & France (don't know about other countries).  My Maman always used Planters as some of the off-brands can small/taste rancid.  While living in the South, I found the LouAna brand to be just as good.  My Maman used peanut oil to make her own mayo, salad dressings & anything else that calls for veggie oil. In Belgium you can buy paper cones of Frites from stands on the street like you can get hot dogs in NYC.  You have your choice of several sauces -- myself, I preferred Piccalillie so here at home, I usually use French's yellow mustard.

OMG - so good! A little bit of work, but totally worth it. I made the sauce in the morning, and let the flavors blend until dinner time. It is delicious! Even my husband commented on how good the sauce was, and he HATES creamy sauces. The only change I made was to fry in mixture of vegetable and corn oil, to use up what I had on hand. Fabulous recipe - thanks for sharing!

I've always wanted to make Belgian fries ever since I lived near Namur, and often visited Antwerp, in 1986. I stayed with an old retired pair who showed me their way of making fries - double dipping and flavoring the oil with garlic. This holiday I received a T-Fal deep fryer and decided to give this recipe a go and try it on my kids and invited company. Remembering to flavor vegetable oil with some garlic cloves, this recipe hit the spot! The results were delicious, especially the sauce. [Note: used veg. oil, not olive oil; my prep time was about 4 hours, and the sauce was fine].

We made baked potato wedges instead of frying, but I made the dip exactly as written, and it was delicious! It had only been in the fridge for a few hours, but the flavor was still great! I'm sure it'll be even better tomorrow. My husband loved it too and I'm sure we'll be making it again, as it's easy and tasty.
