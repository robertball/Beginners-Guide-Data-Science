Delightful and delicious.  And fun to make too! I made the job of filling the cupcake cups easier on myself by pouring the batter into a gallon ZipLoc bag and piping it in. Worked great! Also, I found I could use a little more than the 1/2 T. of filling, if that helps. I baked them for the minimum recommended baking time and they were perfectly moist. I did use the mini Oreos, after finally finding them in the fourth store I looked for them, Costco.  All I could find until then were the Oreo Cakesters! I'm glad I found them, as they do look nice to top the cupcakes, but regular sized Oreos would do just fine in a pinch. I didn't use the Cool Whip, as these will be served where refrigeration is not possible. I LOVED what I ended up frosting them with - White Cake Frosting II, also from this site. Absolutely decadent, memorable, and certainly worthy of making again!

Anything with Oreos is bound to be good and this was no exception.  These were so easy to make and so adorable that I'll definitely make them again.  I did find that I used a bit more of than 1/2 Tbsp. of cream cheese mixture per cupcake, but that's OK because the more the better.  I didn't use Cool Whip for the frosting, but opted for "White Cake Frosting II" from this site.  I've used on "Cookies 'n Cream Cake" before. It tastes just like the inside of an Oreo and it pipes beautifully. It worked great on these little beauties!

Simple and tasty.  I used about 1 T. of the cream cheese mix (instead of 1/2) and there was plenty of mixture to handle this amount.  I made sure when I topped off with the remaining batter that all of the cream cheese mixture was covered so that nothing oozed out.  I did use canned (gasp) frosting on top because they needed to travel to a school event and I didn't think the cool whip would hold up. I think I prefer them with frosting over the cool whip anyway.  A hit with the kids.

I made this recipe as a dessert for a party at my best friend's restaurant. Everyone who ate them couldn't believe that I had made them and not actually bought them from a bakery. I will say that you could probably use a full oreo cookie inside them if you wanted to. The next time I make this I am going to do just that. Also I did turn this into a cake recipe for a different friend's birthday. He doesn't like chocolate so I used the vanilla oreos and a white cake mix. I made a whole cake out of it and it tasted amazing. I will say that you should * make sure that your cream cheese either way you choose to make this recipe is soft enough to blend but no too soft to be liquid-y. It will absorb right into the cupcakes or cake and you won't even get the flavor of biting into the cream cheese.* It's not the same. Also I made my cream cheese more like frosting with powdered sugar and I just judged the sweetness to my tastes. I topped my cupcakes with cream cheese frosting as well because I don't care for whipped topping or butter-cream. I hope this helped. Have Fun!

These are my friend's new favorite cupcakes. I make them with the one bowl chocolate cake II recipe and they come out great but the Oreos kind of melt in the process. Oh well. Use an Oreo or cookies and cream butter cream and they taste great.

I enjoyed making these, and they turned out wonderfully! I found that you can use more than 1/2 tbsp of filling in each cupcake like other reviewers had mentioned. I used a chocolate cake mix, and topped with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this site, and was more than pleased with the final product. The cupcakes had just the right amount of oreo/cream cheese taste in each one. Will be making again :)

I just made these for my little brothers birthday party but I made it with vanilla cake mix since thats all I had at home. I also used whole oreos and then ripped them in half. I would also suggest using more than 1/2tsp of filling. I could barley taste it. The cookie was nice and soft but the cupcake was a little dry. Maybe it was because I didn't have enough filling. But I was expecting it to be better.

Oh my land, super yummy!  I made with regular sized Double Stuf oreos that I cut into quarters to put into the cupcakes.  Topped each cupcake with vanilla frosting and half an oreo.  YUM

So Yummy.  I made these using black magic cake from this site instead of cake mix. Also used a regular oreo instead of a mini for the oreo in the cupcake (still used the mini's for on top of the frosting). Topped with an oreo cookie frosting. My oreo cookie and the cream cheese part did rise up in my cupcakes but they still tasted awesome:)

This is a great idea and the kids loved them, but if I make these again there are a few things I'd change.  First, I wouldn't use a box mix I'd probably make the one bowl chocolate cake III from this site. I used my 1T scoop for the cake batter, 1 scoop in the bottom of the muffin cups and one scoop on top of the filling and cookie.  I'd double the cream cheese mixture and add at least 1T of that to each cupcake.  I also would make a homemade cream cheese frosting, add a few crushed cookies, then top with a mini oreo.

These were okay. Nothing special.  My little guy loved putting the cookie in the middle.  That was the best part.

Oh my goodness these are sooooooo good!  I followed the recipe exactly, but used my own topping not the cool whip.  I used Pillsbury moist supreme German chocolate cake but used apple sauce instead of the oil (never like oil in cakes).  Made in mini teacake pans so did'nt use the muffin papers and cooked for the minimum time.  These turned out just perfect.  Will certainly be making these again...

I skipped the cream cheese filling, and used vanilla frosting (topped with another mini cookie) and made these for my son's b-day party (HUGE oreo fan, that one!) He loved them and thought it was so cool that there was a cookie inside! :)

I made these for St. Patrick's Day this year and instead of using an oreo in the middle, I put a thin mint cookie.  These turned out YUMMY!  I made them to have for our dessert after dinner, but found that they were even better the next day!  I even used green food coloring for the cool whip topping.  Kids and hubby loved them!

This recipe was fantastic! I did use normal size ores and the White Frosting II recipe on this site as alterations. I got so many rave reviews about them and already gave the recipe to someone else who made them already!

These came out awesome!  The only thing I changed was using a cream cheese frosting instead of Cool Whip since I forgot to take that out of the freezer earlier in the day.  My co-workers LOVED them and have already asked for them again.  I did make the cupcakes two days before hand and iced them the night before bringing them into work.  They stayed moist and delish!

These were fun to make - my son loved that he was the one to place the Oreo in the cupcake.  I did not use the cream cheese in the filling.  I frosted these with cool whipped frosting from this site using cookies and cream pudding.  Made a great combination.

I made these because my daughter LOVES oreos but hates almost alll deserts. I thought if she saw there was oreos in the middle she would try it and be over not liking cakes and stuff, but she wouldn't touch them.... These were soooo good. I wished there was a little more of the cream cheese and maybe even two cookies. I will def. make them again. I didn't have cool whip so I made almost pro. buttercream frosting from this site. I stored them in the fridge and they are really good cold!

Good! I wish I would have used more cream cheese mixture and less cake batter in each cupcake, but everyone really seemed to love these. I decided to frost with Quick and Almost-Professional Buttercream Icing from this site instead of the Cool-Whip, but I'm sure the Cool-Whip would have been tasty too. Thanks! :)

FANTASTIC! Super easy and VERY tasty. I used Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix and they turned out perfectly moist and delicious. I am taking these to my nephews 10th birthday party tomorrow and I just know everyone will love them. This is a keeper! Thanks for posting. :)

We loved these! Fun to make and the kids loved to help with the OREO cookies. I did a dozen with the tradional OREOs and another dozen with the "Golden" OREO minis.....both were delicious. I did use lite cool-whip. It was a nice light topping in contrast to the yummy dark chocolate cake and rich cookie/cheese cake-y filling. Everyone loved these at the BBQ we went to yesterday...also added some red, white and blue sprinkles to the top for the holiday. Thanks for a fun treat!

These were so easy to make and such a huge hit. I made some for my family, my boyfriend (plus some of his friends) and they LOVED them. I followed the recipe exactly, but if i had to add my own 2 sense, which i will, i suggest putting about 1tbs of the cream cheese in the cupcake(be generous!). Also, next time ill use big oreos instead of the mini. I topped with vanilla icing&some oreo crumbs, GREAT!! :)

These are so simple to make and they come out looking like you got them at the local bakery.

Very good! My Oreo and cheesecake didn't really stand out too much when you cut into it, but it still tasted good!

I should have taken others advice to use a bigger cookie as I could hardly taste the mini oreo.  I did use more of the cream cheese mixture in each one and could taste it.  I frosted half of them and we put cool whip on the other half - I liked both.

I put these together for a party we are going to tonihgt.  I didn't have chocolate cake mix, so I used the Chocolate Cupcake recipe on here for the cake batter.  These are easy--and not really time consuming--and not hard to make at all.  I don't have mini oreos and didn't bother looking for them since I have oreos in the pantry.  I cut into quarters like other reviewers.  I don't feel like icing these, so I will bring whipped cream and cut up oreos to the party to decorate there.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy delicious! I sent these with my 6 year old to school, so we skipped the whip cream and just frosted with vanilla frosting and then sprinkled some leftover Oreo crumbs and then topped with a mini Oreo on it's end so it stood up. Super cute and the kids LOVED them!

These were very very good and a unique recipe for cupcakes..excellent...I ended up with alot of the leftover cream cheese mixture and I realized that I should have used more than the 1/2 Tbsp it says but really good will definitely make again!

They were a tad bit dry. Would have liked more cream cheese. Not horrible though.

Winner!  Made mine in a 9 x 13 pan, baked 45 min.  I put 1/2 the batter in the pan, carefully spooned cream cheese mix on, then layered (course crushed) oreos next, then added the remaining batter.  Topped with buttercream frosting.  Truly moist and delicious.

Good. My complaint is that the mini oreo's have such a little amount of the filling that once baked the filling melting away and the center was just a little bit of cheesecake and cookie. I think if I make them again I will use full size Oreo's and cut them, because you know we all love Oreo's for their center. :) I did use Vanilla Whipped frosting instead of Cool Whip. I also got 17 cupcakes out of this recipe.

These were good, but I ate one where I didn't actually taste the oreo at all.  So I would suggest using more than one mini oreo if you really want the oreo effect.  The cream cheese mixture added a nice taste that made these different from plain chocolate cupcakes.  I, like others, used frosting for fear the cool-whip wouldn't hold up, and it worked great.

Very good- I didn't think they were very time consuming. I used a canned frosting because I was bringing these to a cookout but coolwip would be great too.  Kids and parents all enjoyed! Will make again! Thanks!

Great cupcakes!  The oreo and cream cheese mixture in the middle give it a rich moist texture.  My family loves them.
