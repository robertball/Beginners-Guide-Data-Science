Lets say you're escaping from LV 426 but right before you do, a warrior steals this Creamy Blueberry Pie. He takes it down to sub level 2 in the atmospheric processor and places it in a cocoon. A nuclear explosion is about to go off and you only have 14 minutes to reach minimum safe distance all while the Queen is right behind you. DO YOU GO AFTER YOUR STOLEN PIE? Yes. You should also go after it even if the blueberries have been substituted for a mixed berries. Because that's delicious too. After you eat, you might be wondering if you can dream. My answer would be: I-Firmative.

My, oh my, I loved this pie!  I had a couple of bags of frozen blueberries that had migrated to the rear of my freezer; I hesitate to say how long they had been in there.  But after chipping them out of their frosty prison, and rinsing the ice crystals off them, they worked just fine.  I sprinkled some cinnamon over the blueberries, and I used reduced fat sour cream and added some vanilla to the filling.  Also, I used brown sugar instead of white for the topping.  This pie came out beautiful and delicious.  I imagine it would be even better with fresh blueberries.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm 16 years old and this was one of my first attempts at pie making. Not only is this recipe easy, but it also tastes great. My suggestion for those trying this recipe for the first time- easy on the sugar.It will overpower the taste of te pie. Instead use a little more sour cream(I used light sour cream for nutritional purposes) in the wet mixture. For the dry topping mixture I added a few dashes of cinnamon,2 tbs more of butter and didnt use all of the mixture.It made all the difference. Make sure you bake the pie about 10 minutes longer then the recipe calls for so the crust turns golden brown and the pie stays together when cutting it later.There are 6 people in my family and most of them picky eaters-this pie satisfied everyones taste and I am definately making this again.

I just made this the other day. (I'm testing recipes for Thanksgiving; my sister requested blueberry pie.) This has just made the menu!!!! I used 24 oz partially thawed, undrained (oops) frozen blueberries. The second I spooned the egg/sour cream mixture over the berries they finished melting and I ended up having to scoop some out and not use all of the filling (no biggee). I also didn't use all of the topping, this recipe makes a lot. I followed the advice of previous reviewers made the following changes: used 3/4 cup white sugar, 2/3 cup reduced-fat sour cream, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon in the filling; in the topping I used half white and half brown sugars (for total of 1/2 cup), and added 1 tsp. cinnamon. The results were wonderful (allowing for the non-draining mistake). I did have to cook longer than called for (about 20 minutes more). The pie holds together well when cut (after cooling a couple of hours, of course). Not too sweet, not sour creamy at all... Beware this goes fast so you might want to bake up 2 of them!!!!!

HELPFUL TIPS FOR THIS BLUEBERRY COFFEECAKE IN PIE FORM: ...yep, this is more like a nice coffee cake with a pretty presentation.  I am in total agreement with the user who said the sugar needed to be reduced to 3/4C sugar (i like sweet and this was PLENTY), add 1t vanilla, and up the sour cream to 2/3C.  Don't worry, you won't taste the sour cream!!  I also had to add 10 min to the baking time (just whenever my pie crust was nice and golden).  For the topping: I did 1/4C sugar and 1/4C brown sugar, and I CANNOT imagine using all of it.  I used enough to cover the top nicely.  I also used more like 3T of COLD butter cut in instead of the 4T (1/4C on a stick of butter).

I LOVED this pie.  During blueberry season you can't miss with this one.  I only ever use frozen pie crust (I'm lazy) and it was SOOOO good.  I agree with the following comments from others:
1.  Add vanilla to the sour cream
2.  Add pinch of cinnamon to the topping
3.  Almost tastes better the next day cold or room temp.

My next variation on this pie will to make it with strawberries or a mixed berry.  Try Trader Joe's frozen berries.

I've been using allrecipes for about 8 years now, and this is the first recipe that I have ever rated. This is seriously the best blueberry pie I have ever tasted. I ate the whole pie by myself in 2 days! It's easy to make, fast, and delicious. I did follow these recommendations for the filling: 3/4 cup sugar, 2/3 cup sour cream, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, added 1 tsp vanilla extract and zest of one lemon to the sour cream. For the topping: 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon. I didn't use all the topping because I didn't want the pie to be too sweet; just enough so that it covered the pie (about half of the topping). I also had to cook the pie for a lot longer; just cook until the topping is golden brown and crispy. I  prefer the pie chilled, straight from the refrigerator. Enjoy!

This is fantastic!  This pie completely blew away all of my American friends who have been making and eating blueberry pies all their lives! Several times, while trying to make this recipe a little more heart-friendly, I used light sour cream, light brown sugar, as well as soft baking butter with canola oil.  Turned out very good indeed!  I highly recommend this recipe as this pie is very easy to make and even seasoned and experienced pie connoisseurs will love it!

This was a simple recipe that has ample room for experimentation. While the topping is sweet, I didn't find the center too terribly sweet- maybe I could have used sweeter berries (I'd rather eat a perfect berry over making a pie with it). *I found that refrigerating this pie a day ahead brings out a much better quality to the flavor and texture.

Fantastic! I've been wanting to try this recipe for a while and I'm glad I did! "Creamy" in the recipe name might be a little misleading about the texture of the filling. It isn't at all like a cream pie and you don't taste the sour cream all that much. The result, no matter how difficult to put into words, is really good. This pie is easy and the flavor of the blueberries shines, complemented by the sweet filling and crisp topping. I didn't think it was too sweet at all when served still warm, but at room temperature it seemed sweeter. The only change I made was to add some vanilla to the sour cream mixture.

I thought this pie was good.  I was hoping for creamier.   Was a little eggy?? I made this just as recipe was written.  I can not get over how cooks can rate a recipe when they have made 3 or 4 changes.  Hello... that is a new recipe!!!!!  I will make this again trying to get a little creamier texture.  I tried this from the fridge and then at room temp.  Room temp was better for my liking.  Again, try and not rate a recipe after " I changed this and this and this"

I made this for my brother, who loves blueberry pie.  He thought it was fantastic, but that it was like eating a blueberry muffin that wasn't fully cooked.  He said it was great and he took half of it with him after our Christmas feast was over.  In my opinion, I don't think it should be called Creamy Blueberry Pie.  I would describe it as more of a cake, due to its texture.  It was definitely not what I expected, but it was good and I will be making it for my brother again.

I wonder if I did something wrong...this pie turned out way too sweet. I think I should have used just half of the topping. Just too sweet and overpowered the good filling of blueberrys. Easy on the sugar!!

This is my favorite blueberry pie recipe.  I have made it as written and also with a graham cracker crust.  We prefer the graham crust - it just gives it a richer, buttery flavor.  This last time, I actually made it in my springform pan, which made it so much easier to get nice looking pieces.  I also used fat-free sour cream, because that is what I had in the fridge.  Will continue to make this many more times.  Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful recipe. I served it over 4th of July weekend at a family reunion and it got rave reviews. I added 3/4 of sour cream instead of the 1/2 cup and for the topping used 1/4 white and 1/4 brown sugar plus a teaspoon of cinnamon. Delicious! I'll definitely be making this again!

This is one of the best pies I have ever made. I followed a couple of suggestions and added cinnamon & vanilla to the sour cream sauce. I used brown sugar for the topping.  I think I added a little cinnamon, too. I put foil over the whole pie for the first 20 minutes in the oven, then removed for the remaining 35 minutes. Helps the crust not burn.  I let it cool and put it in the refrigerator over night. I had my first slice for breakfast. :)

Excellent Blueberry Pie recipe!  I receive so many compliments on this and even get requests for it.  I make my own pie crust, which I pre-bake to avoid a soggy bottom.  Then I change the crumb topping as follows:   mix 2/3 cup packed brown sugar, 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour, & 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon then chop in 2 tablespoon butter with a pastry blender.  I like to have extra topping to make a thick crumb layer.  I've also found that with this and my apple pie, it's a nice touch to add some thinly slivered butter on top of the fruit before adding the crumb topping.  You can also add an additional sprinkling of white and brown sugar before the crumb if you have a real sweet tooth.  This, with the butter, seeps down into the fruit making it sweet and delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe that I always keep coming back to!

This is so delicious!!  I had planns to go berry picking today and wanted to use up the rest of the blueberries in my freezer from last season.  I was a little concerned when it was done as it was a little jiggly in the centre, but it set up nicely as it cooled.  I guess it was due to the frozen berries.  I decresed to 3/4 c added the vanilla to the custard and used brown sugar for the topping.  The reviews of others really help when trying out recipes from this site - Thanks! This is a recipe that I will make again and again!- so easy!

This is very good, and has a homemade, country appeal.  The filling is very nice and puffs up when it is baked through.

Fabulous!  I didn't have sour cream on hand so used vanilla yogurt.  I had no problem at all using all the sugar/flour/butter mixture on the top.  I'll definitely be making this many times!

The concept was wonderful, but I only gave 4 stars because I thought the pie was way too sweet.  The overwhelming flavor was sweetness; the  berries didn't  register.  I even reduced the sugar based upon prior postings, using 2/3 cup in the filling and 1/3 cup in the topping.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar even more and will add lemon juice and / or zest for more flavor and to cut the sweetness.  This is definitely a recipe worth trying, but keep in mind that it may need tweeking to get it to your taste.

Well, I made some changes.  I didn't have enough blueberries so I used half blueberries and half raspberries. The berries were all frozen, so I let them sit in a collander while a made the pie crust.  Then I rinsed them with some lukewarm water so that they thawed and I tossed them with some cornstarch and sugar (just sprinkled it in there... I'm not sure how much).  I used light sour cream for the cream layer and added cinnamon mixed in.  In the topping I added about 2Tbl of butter.  I was definitely just experimenting, but it turned out awesome!!!  I gave some to my brother who gave some to his friends and they said they would pay me to make this pie for them!  All-in-all, it may not be the prettiest finished pie, but it is super yummy :)

This was a hit, with modifications from the very helpful reviewers!  I doubled the recipe (2 pies) because I found a heck of a deal on fresh blueberries.  Cut back on the sugar in the mix, used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar in the topping, added fresh lemon zest and lemon juice and vanilla to the blueberry mix.  Even my non-sweet eating boyfriend thought this was great.  Not too sweet, just right.  I'll make this again for sure, thank you for sharing!

This was very creamy and moist.  I loved the flavor.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used brown sugar instead of white for the topping.

This is such an easy, no-fuss pie to make and it is outstanding!!  I used fresh blueberries and made the filling exactly as directed.  For the topping I substituted 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar for the white sugar and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon.   The pie wasn't overly sweet at all.  This recipe is definitely a "keeper" and I'm sure it will be fabulous during the winter using frozen berries when fresh are not in season.

This pie is fantastic!  The best blueberry pie I've ever had!  I made it for my hubby's birthday and everyone loved it.  I didn't change the recipe at all except for using reduced fat sour cream.  I was wondering if it would work as well with any other kinds of berries??  Going to give it a try with blackberries next time.

This was absolutely outstanding. I added 1 tsp vanilla to the custard mix and 1 tsp cinnamon to the crumb topping. I baked it for 1 hour 10 minutes and it was perfect.

Served this at a birthday dinner.  Everyone liked it and asked for the recipe.  I took the advice of others and used brown sugar for the topping, added 1 tsp of vanilla in the custard and added the zest of one lemon, as well.  I found I needed to back it around 60 minutes for the crust to brown enough, although that may be particular to my oven.  Next time I will make more topping as I felt it would be better.

This is an easy recipe and tasty.  I made once according to the original recipe and another time with some of the other recommendations. It  is in no way overly sweet.  The topping amount is completely appropriate.  I used a roll out prepared crust and cooked one time in a quiche dish and the next time in a cake pan.  Seems like a pie pan might be too small.  Also added 1 t vanilla to filling.  Second time I made I used 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c unpacked light brown sugar with 1 t cinnamon.  I thought this was better than original version.  Other than this, quantities in original recipe are perfect.  I served cold with vanilla ice cream.  Would also be good served with breakfast.  I cooked first time in oven and added a significant amount of extra cooking time.  Next time I cooked in toaster oven and added about 10 minutes extra.

This pie is SCRUMPTOUS. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because a) the topping needs a dash of cinnamon, as others suggested b) its VERY sweet (next time I think I'll cut back by 1/4 cup sugar) c)the name is sort of misleading. Its not exactly creamy. With that said, it is delicious! And it looks amazing. Definitely keeping this recipe!

Fabulous !  I doubled the recipe and made it in 9 x 13 baking dish. The sour cream/sugar/flour mixture is so yummy over the blueberries.  I did add cinnamon over the blueberries before putting the sour cream mixture in.  I think cinnamon really adds a nice touch to blueberry recipes.

YUM!!  My fiance requested a blueberry pie for his birthday, so I chose this recipe... and it was fantastic!  I ended up using about 4 cups of blueberries, so I used the full 1 cup of sugar, and slightly more sour cream and flour.  Also added vanilla extract and lemon zest to the mixture - which was really lovely and added a lot to the pie.  Used a mix of white/brown sugars for the topping, and also added about a tsp. of cinnamon.  I used the full amount of topping, but you could definitely get away with less.  My fiance loved it.  Thanks!

This was so delicious! I halved the recipe, and didn't use a crust - just baked it in a Pyrex mixing bowl. I used vanilla lowfat yogurt instead of sour cream, and added some cinnamon to the topping. It was really perfect!

This recipe is great...my husband just loved it.  I think the sour cream mixture needs a little zip, so next time I will add a little lemon juice or zest to give it some zip.  I think this recipe would also taste great with fresh peaches.

I made this last night, and it was awesome. I did make a change however, since my boyfriend is morally opposed to the mere existence of sour cream, let alone putting it into something he might eat. I was trying to think of what I could use in place of the sour cream and decided to use a container of lemon yogurt that I had on hand, plus a good squirt of lemon juice. Came out great!
I did decide to mix the cream (or in my case, yogurt)/egg mixture in with the blueberries and put a regular crust on top, instead of the crumbly mixture. The egg mixture did mostly sink to the bottom. Nonetheless, it was VERY yummy. :)

I should have written this review last year after I first tried it.  This is simply superb!  The best, and now only, blueberry pie that I make.  My MIL, who is the best pie baker I've ever met, even said that she wouldn't be able to tell it from one of her's!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Best tasting Blueberry pie I have ever made! Almost too much stuff for a 9 inch shell to hold so I added 1 C more blueberries, increased the flour in the sour cream mixture to 1/2 cup and then I put it into a 10 inch deep dish shell.
I am making my second one this week as it goes so fast I don't get seconds myself!

I liked this pie, probably better than regular blueberry pie.  I made it exactly as directed and it was good, but it could be better.  The next time I made it, I didn't think there was enough blueberries in the pie so I  doubled to 6 cups. I  cooked 3 cups and mashed and thickened on the stove to reduce to 1 1/2 cups. Cool then add remaining berries and sugar.  It was really, really sweet, so I  reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup using the doubled blueberries.  I  added a peeled grated apple squeezed dry in a towel to the blueberries to help thicken (tip from Americas test kitchen, pectin in the apple will help to thicken) and I did not use flour in the filling because that has a thick gluey taste in this pie.  I  used 2 T. quick cooking tapioca ground.  I  added 1t. vanilla to the filling and  some grated lemon  zest.  So, given that I made it as directed and then again with these changes, I hope you try it either way, but if nothing else, reduce the sugar it is really, really sweet as is so add less and taste, then add more if you want.

Very simple to make and so delicious!  I didn't have sour cream on hand so instead substituted plain greek yogurt which tastes practically the same and the texture was very nice.  I took this pie to work and it was a big hit!  (If you dislike making pie crust, yet dislike pre-made crusts even more, see if you can find Marie Callendar frozen pie crusts in your store.  They are delicious compared to any others I've tried.)

Turned out really good although next time I make it I will use less sugar (between 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup).  I used frozen blueberries and store bought pie crust.  I also cooked it for additional 20-30 minutes.

This was a huge hit with my family!  Made my own crust, but yes you'll need deep-dish.  There's a lot of stuff to put in there!

Yum yum gimme some!     This is one of those pies that evereybody creeps into the kitchen for "just a sliver"  again and again.  I liked the "eggy" quality that some reviwers mentioned - and accented it by adding freshly grated nutmeg and lemon zest to the sour cream misture, and some cinnamon to the struesel topping.

This was pretty good. The filling held together nicely (hubby claimed "I can pick it up and eat it like pizza!") and the flavor was great. I did follow the other reviewers' suggestions to decrease the sugar, etc. I never could quite figure out how to cut in butter to make crumblies, so i skipped the butter, combined sugars (brown and white) with cinnamon, and sprinkled that over the filling. It worked like a charm and looked beautiful, but without the added calories. Note: I used sugar substitutes (part Sweet N Low, part Splenda) and this pie was still great.

My favorite pie recipe since it is so easy!  I use frozen blueberries because it was simple.  Just thawed under warm running water so they were rinsed.  I used baking splenda for 1 cup of the sugar and it was great!  You need the "real" sugar for the topping though.  This pie did not last long at the party and got rave reviews!  It never hurts that it is so pretty too!

This pie is amazing! I usually only search for gluten-free recipes, but this is easy enough to modify. I used sweet rice flour and a GF Pantry crust, and let me tell you my family (who are picky) loved it. They kept asking "is it really Gluten-Free"

Yum! I wanted to try Chef Michael Smith's Whole Wheat Pastry and made this pie. I used a bag of frozen mixed berries, cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, used brown sugar for the topping and added cinnamon and vanilla extract. It was so easy and turned out wonderful. Thanks.

My first attempt at making a blueberry pie was w/ this recipe and it was phenomenal!  I made the recommended recipe changes; 3/4 c sugar and added vanilla and cinnamon.  Then also used 1/4 c. white sugar w/ 1/4 brown sugar for crumble topping.  It was so delicious.  Perfect texture, not too runny.  My children even loved it.  Only thing I would change is that I didn't take the time to make a homemade crust :)  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I followed the instructions word for word, but I added a dash of cinnamon to the topping and a dash of vanilla extract to the sour cream mixture. I made this pie effortlessly. I will definitely make this again!

very easy- a little too sweet for my taste buds. Our blueberries are naturally sweet and I should have added less sugar to the flour mix.

I followed the recipe with the following adjustments: used only 2 1/2 cups of blueberries (had a shallow pie pan), added a splash of vanilla to the pie mixture, replaced white sugar with light brown sugar in the topping, and added 1-2 tsp cinnamon to topping. Note on this recipe: the topping may take a while to make. I shaved bits of butter (~3 tbsp) into the sugar/flour/cinnamon topping mixture and mixed with a fork until it looked moist and crumbly. If it clumps too much, add a bit more flour and keep mixing til everything is moist again. Baked at 350 and it was done exactly 50 min later. As soon as it cooled, my boyfriend ate half the pie himself! He absolutely loved the crispy topping. Brown sugar makes a difference!

This was an excellent recipe! The reviews were helpful and I didn't need to change much! I used fresh blueberries, with the following changes to the filling: added 1 tsp vanilla to sour cream mixture & for the topping: I added a dash of cinnamon & also substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar, instead of a whole 1/2 cup of white sugar. I found that I also needed about 5-10 extra minutes baking time.

I used freshly picked blueberries and followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only additions I made were 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp lemon extract to the custard filling.  The lemon really livened up the flavors!  I did have to bake it an extra 10 minutes to get the top to turn golden brown and using a pie crust shield helped tremendously.  Without it I would have burned the crust for sure.  This is the first blueberry pie I've made and sure to be the only one I'll need in my recipe box!  Awesome pie!!!

I made this for a family get-together and there was almost a fight for the last piece! (My uncle and his father both love blueberries!) Made it just as  the recipe states, although I did add some cinnamon to the sour cream mixture and the topping. I might experiment with cutting back the sugar for future tries, but it tasted great to me. FYI- I used the deep-dish pie crust, and two containers of blueberries fit perfectly.

Super easy and so yummy.  I served each slice with vanilla ice cream and it was great.  I debated about whether to use all the crumb topping on the pie since it seemed like a lot, but I'm glad I did.  It wasn't crumbly at all and make a nice top crust. My four year old got the pie out of the fridge on her own and ate 1/3 of the pie right out of the pie plate when I wasn't paying attention!  I'm already planning on making it again!

Awesome! I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was the first time I ever made blueberry pie. Everyone loved it, even the people who said they usually didn't like blueberry pie! I added some cinnamin to the topping and a little vanilla extract to the sour cream filling. I will definitely be making this pie again!

This was very, very good!  Sort of a cross between a blueberry pie and cobbler.  Taste was good, texture great and an all around winner.  I will make this again for sure with no changes.  I used unsalted butter for the topping and had to cook 60 minutes to get the top brown.  Other than those 2 things I followed the recipe exactly.  Great recipe, Thanks!!

Excellent pie!  The whole crowd at work devoured it and sang praises.  I used fresh farm blueberries and made sure to cut out all stems.  I also added a hint of Nissley vanilla to the sour cream mixture and some cinnamon in the topping mixture.

This is THE best blueberry pie I have ever tasted. In fact it is probably the best pie I have ever eaten. It is dense and the slices stay together when cut. It's sweet and fruity and the crisp crumb topping is perfect with the creamy fruit inside.

This was so tasty! Loved it! So easy too. I used frozen/thawed blueberries. Not a problem. Loved the sour cream addition too. Loved this recipe and it'll be in my keeper file for sure.

I have made this blueberry pie so many times, I decided it finally deserves my review.  Every time I make this pie, it turns out beautifully.  You cannot mess it up.  I make it in the winter with frozen blueberries, and it still turns out great.  It is even better the next day!  The do not change a thing, except to bake it a little longer than the recipe calls for (closer to 60 minutes).

I would really give this 4.5 stars, because while it isn't the "best" blueberry pie I've ever had... but it certainly is quick and easy and tasty to boot! Like other reviewers, I also cut back on the sugar in the cream mixture (to 3/4 cup) and in the topping (to 1/3 cup) - this was just sweet enough for me. I like the crunch of the white sugar on top, but next time I might try a mixture of white and brown sugar, like others have suggested. I did use frozen blueberries - just thawed and rinsed - they work just fine. The cooking time is more like 60+ minutes if you really want the top to start to brown a bit. Another plus is that it cuts well and retains shape on the dessert plate!

I thought this was a great change to the traditional blueberry pie; it reminded me of an apple crisp, but with blueberries.  I used the canola pie crust on this website and used brown sugar in my topping instead of white sugar.  Out of the oven, warm with the crumbled topping and vanilla ice cream--Yum!  thanks Susan for sharing....

Very nice change for a blueberry pie.  My daughter thought she preferred it to a regular blueberry pie but my husband still likes the traditional pie.  Easy to make and will make again.

We really loved this recipe! The tang of the sour cream was great! The only thing I did differently was I added about 2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp nutmeg. SOOOO good!

What a great recipe!  I've made it twice, once with blueberries, and recently with apples (I did improvise with cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla for the latter).  This recipe brings the best of a pie and cobbler together; the flavor is great, and it is truly simple to make.  Thanks so much!

I was looking for blueberry recipes when I came across this.  I didn't have any shortening or pie crusts on hand, so I just made the filling in an 8x8 baking dish and baked it like a cobbler.  It was easy and delicious.  The only thing I would change next time is maybe add a little vanilla to the sour cream mixture, and toss the berries in a little lemon juice to bring out their brightness.  I liked this recipe so much I substituted thinly sliced nectarines (tossed in a little lemon juice) for the berries and made the "cobbler" again!

This was fabulous! I did as another suggested and cut down on the sugar, I used 1/2 cup. I also used a 1/4 cup brown sugar with a 1/4 cup white sugar for the topping and added cinnamon before baking. The family loved it! This is definitely one we will enjoy again!

OH MY!!! Absolutely delicious! I had friend over for a cook out last night, and wanted a great summer pie recipe. I thought of blueberry, but my husband doesn't like plain blueberry pie-too sweet. If this is you, you MUST try this recipe. It has a wonderful blueberry flavor without being too sweet. I did have to double the crumbly mixture for the top. Thanks for an excellent recipe I will make again and again. My sister in lae even made me print her a copy to take with her!!!!

Absolutely DELICIOUS, and very easy to make. I've made this pie several times, and everyone raves about it. I do cut back on the sugar a little (3/4 cup and 1/3 cup instead of 1 cup and 1/2 cup) and bake it longer (until it begins to turn golden brown on the top). We like it best served warm, not hot or cold. I've tried many blueberry pie recipes, and this one is the best!

Wow- this recipe is awesome!  I've never found a blueberry pie recipe that I've liked, all the recipes I've tried have been too sweet.  While this pie is sweet, it's not overpoweringly so.  I have a new favorite pie recipe.  Thank you so much!

Excellent! I decreased the amount of sugar from a cup to 3/4 cup, used egg substitute, reduced fat sour cream, and added a dash of cinnamon. Made with French pastry pie crust, also from this sight. I love this. Will definitely make again!

Per other cooks' recommendations I increased sour cream by a quarter cup and decrease sugar by quarter cup.  I put in half brown sugar in batter and topping and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to both the batter and to the topping. Also, I parbaked the piecrust and it came out perfect!

EASIEST pie to make and I get nothing but thumbs up with this wonderful pie.  I find the original recipe too sweet and find it's too much topping, so I cut the topping  in half to 1/8 butter - 1/4 flour - 1/4 sugar.  In the cream mixture I cut the sugar about 30-40% and add 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I used a frozen pie crust too when I am too busy to make my own pastry. My motto is, the less ingredients in a pie, the better the pie.

This is the  most excellent  blueberry pie.  I picked fresh  blueberries  and decided to try this recipe.  So very glad i did. I followed the recipe  using only 3/4 cup of sugar but really think i could have  used the whole cup.   Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.

I followed the lead of a couple of the other reviewers.  I cut the white sugar in half for the pie itself.  I doubled the custard because, well custard.  I also replaced the white sugar in the streusel with brown sugar.  The pie came out great, not too sweet.  The blueberries really shined without being overpowered by sweetness.  The topping was crunchy and caramelized.  Really, really good.  I'd like to make this again maybe using other berries such as blackberries or mulberries.

We made this the first time as written and it was just "okay". I tend to think of blueberry pie being sweet, and this was not sweet. The next time we made it, we added 1/2 cup of extra sugar to the filling and then sprinkled sugar over the topping as well. WAY better. 

It was a hit and has been our most requested dessert for parties.

Decided to step out box from the traditional blueberry pie and tried this recipe. The only change I did was to use margarine instead of butter in the crumble. I didn't measure how many cups I had in blueberries, and eyed 3 cups. I thought it wasn't enough blueberries for a 9" pie pan, but I'm glad that I didn't add more. The custard filled in the gaps. It did take a full 1 hour to cook and was slightly brown on top.  Let it cooled for a couple of hours and ate with vanilla ice cream. It was a nice and delicious break from your normal blueberry pie. I don't know if I would call it creamy since my visions of creamy looks like custard oozing out of a donut, but looks pretty much like the pictures posted. I think the next time I make this, I'll try to add vanilla to the custard and use brown sugar instead of white in the crumble, like the video suggested. Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone who tries this pie loves this. As soon as it is blueberry season we find any excuse to make this pie. Last night I forgot to put it in a pie crust. Honestly? I liked it much better. The simple ingredients really stood out. Because there was "less" to the pie, I would increase the filling, both custard and berry. The dish can handle more.

This was so good!  I increased the recipe by 1/2 and put it in a 9x11 pan.  I also used 1/2 frozen blueberries and 1/2 frozen strawberries.  Because of that it took an extra 20 minutes to cook.  Everybody loved it!  I plan on making it again and again!!!

11.24.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12155/creamy-blueberry-pie/ ... If I hadn't tried True Blue Custard Crunch Pie first, I would've rated this higher.  By that, I definitely don't mean this pie isn't good; it is.  I just like the other one better.  I followed a few suggestions, upping the sour cream to 2/3c (& lowered the sugar to 2/3c, too, since the berries are insanely sweet).  The streusel part didn't crunch for me.  True Blue recipe didn't either.  I'm blaming the juiciness of the berries.  No points off. ;D  The extra egg & additional flour thicken it more than the other.  It tastes egg-thickened.  ;Not a bad thing, just different.  This has a very, very slight cheese cake flavor from the sour cream.  If you can get the streusel to crunch, I'm sure it's a very pretty pie, kind of marbled-looking.  Glad I tried.

Wow!  This blueberry pie is awesome.  I think I have made 3 this week.  I had bought some michigan blueberries that were very good so I was looking for a good recipe, and something a bit different.  This was not too sweet, and the custard was fabulous on it.  After the first pie it only took me about 20 minutes to whip them together.  It's great with ice cream or whipped cream, but because of the custard you don't even need it.  Hands down best blueberry pie we have ever eaten.

This recipe was fantastic! If you have a food processor, you can use that to easily make the pie crust and streusel topping.

Highly recommended! I've made this pie and it was a hit with everyone. Super easy to make and practically effortless. White sugar works great because it gives off a clean taste and really accentuates the blueberries. However, use brown sugar if you're looking for a more home-made taste.

Blueberries are abundant and inexpensive this year and before I ran out of room in my freezer I decided to make a pie.  I was going to make a regular blueberry pie until I saw this recipe and gave it a try.  I made it as written, no substitutes, additions, or deletions, and it is FABULOUS!  I look forward to using cherries or peaches next time.

Mine came out runny. Not firm. The flavor was sensational, but runny. Like a runny cobbler. But, ice cream makes this sensational!

Made this pie instead of blueberry pie since I didn't have enough blueberries to make a regular blueberry pie.  Used frozen blueberried and it tasted awesome!!  My husband, daughter and friends loved it!!

While this recipe was very tasty and delicious, it didn't quite make the 5-star cut for me, though I still recommend it.  I made a few changes - I used frozen (thawed and drained) blueberries, and I used a traditional criss-cross pie crust. I'm sure fresh blueberries would have improved the recipe. I also topped it with whipped cream, which is recommended. I think that a deeper pie pan would also help. Overall, very tasty and easy to make!

This was great.  Reduced sugar and increased blueberries.  Next time I'm going to try blackberries.  Only used half of topping.  Great.

This pie was awesome!!! (And, I am not a big pie eater.) I took some advice from previous reviews and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup for the custard mixture and upped the sour cream to 2/3 cup. I also added a little vanilla to the custard and a little cinnamon to the topping. The pie disappeared so fast I made a 2nd one a couple of days later and used half blueberries and half strawberries. Still good! I also think the pie tastes even better cold.  I will make this again.

Simple but very sweet pie.  Followed other reviews by using 3/4 cup white sugar, 2/3 cup sour cream, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon in the filling.  For the topping I used half brown and half white sugar.  Had to bake a bit longer as well, but it turned out well.  It was very very sweet.  Will probably cut the sugar more if I make again.

This was the easiest pie to make!  I didn't use sour cream b/c I didn't have any, but I did use vanilla greek yogurt.  I thought it turned out wonderfully.  I was hoping for more of a custard type layer, but the result was very satisfying.

Just Wonderful!  Substituted 3/4 cup white sugar, 2/3 cup sour cream and added 1 tsp vanilla in the custard.  I made the streusel with 1/4 cup sugar, 1/3 cup light brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg, 1 stick melted unsalted butter, and 1+ 1/3 cups flour (A Barefoot Contessa favorite).  Make your own pie crust and people will think you're a pro! It's foolproof!  Better than most and easy.

Yummy! Loved how the sour cream sank to the bottom and created a kind of custard. I left it out overnight and by the next day the streusel wasn't  crunchy anymore; next time I would make both the pie and streusel beforehand and bake it the same day I intend to serve it. And probably add cinnamon and nutmeg to the streusel, too--I chickened out because I wasn't sure how it would go with the blueberries, but I think it would have been fine. The one adjustment I did make was add about a teaspoon of vanilla, just because, which did no harm.

Made this pie tonight for my dad's birthday. Awesome! Absolutely loved it, as did everyone else. I really liked the texture of the custard in this pie. The only things that I changed was that I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup in the custard. I also used brown sugar on the streusel topping instead of white! Will make this again soon!

SO awesomely good- realized right as I pulled the sour cream from the fridge to add it in, that it had gone bad (note to self, check ingredients before starting a recipe!) and used a little kid 'splitz' yogurt and some leftover fresh ricotta cheese.  This was AWESOME GOOD, not too sweet, but SO fab.  I think I cooked it about 50 mins total and just eyeballed how many blueberries to put into the bottom of the pie shell.  So good my little brother who a s picky pie man was SWOONING!

This pie was delicious. I don't even like blueberries all that much but this pie was absolutely to die for. It was  the perfect amount of sweetness. I made it with Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust which normally shines, but the pie and crumble itself stole the show in this pie.

The ONLY change that I made was in the crumble, where I used half white sugar and half brown sugar and it was great.

I definitely will recommend this and I definitely will be making it again.

I was a little leery when a coworker asked me to make him a blueberry pie for his birthday.  I, typically, don't like fruit pies as they tend to ooze all over once they are cut.  This pie held true to form when cut.  It was very delicious and everyone loved it.  I agree with previous reviews that the cooking time in not accurate.  I had to cook it a minimum of one hour, twenty minutes.  I also added a little vanilla to the cream portion.  

This was so good, I'm making it again the next time I host bunco at my house!  It's a keeper!

Great non runny blueberry pie.  Only thing I have changed is that I add at least 1/2 cup more blueberries than listed so that the pie is packed.  Continually is a big hit at parties and converts those that usually do not try blueberry pie

I made this for Labor day weekend, and my family loved it!  I did use 1/2 cup of Brown Sugar and 1/2 cup of regular sugar for the topping instead of all reg sugar.  Everybody really loved!  I am trying to find my next recipe to try ...any suggestions??

VERY tasty. 

I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of the full cup, and did a double pastry crust instead of the crumbly topping. I also had creme fraiche from a local dairy farm on hand, which I substituted for the sour cream. 

It came out great!! Definitely richer than a normal berry pie (probably because of my creme fraiche substitute) but soooo yummy.

This recipe is delicious as is.  I chose the creamy blueberry recipe because I wasn't sure I had enough blueberries for a standard pie.  The combination is excellent!  The only change I made was that I used whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose because it's all I had in the house.

Excellent pie, I used store bought crust and for the topping took the advice of others and used 1/4 brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and a pinch of cinnamon. Since I don't have a pastry blender for the topping, just mixed it together with my hands for a nice crumble. SO EASY AND SO GOOD.

This was really, really great. Per other member's suggestions, I used only 3/4 cup sugar for the filling as well as 2/3 cup sour cream, a tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. For the topping, I used both white and brown sugar and cut in a bit more butter as well. I think I added a dash of cinnamon to the topping as well. Towards the end of a recipe, I get a little antsy for it to just be in the oven already and just start adding everything. 
I used a Kroger brand premade refrigerated pie crust. 

I let it cool down because I really don't like warm fruit and added whipped topping. My weirdo boyfriend warmed his up and then added milk to the bowl? What? We both loved it though. Thank you for adding this recipe!

No changes except....add a little cinnamon to the topping.   FABULOUS pie!!!  We have an abundance of fresh blueberries each year and the pie is great with fresh or frozen berries.   Not necessarily "creamy" but DELICIOUS!
6/11   Made this over and over it is still the BEST blueberry pie ever!

This is excellent. I cut the sugar that goes in the sour cream mixture in half and added 1/4 cup of Agave nectar.  I also added a splash of almond extract.  Like others, I added cinnamon to the topping, and didn't use it all (another way to cut out some sugar).  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 sugar on the topping. So good.

Instead of blueberries, we used a combination of home-grown berries we had in the freezer.  Loganberries, raspberries, blackberries and wild mountain huckleberries.  Tossed the berries with about 1/3 cup sugar and let them defrost while we made the crust & filling.    The only other change we made was to use freshly ground whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and cut the 1 cup sugar down to 1/2 cup.    My 9 year old is the one who makes it most of the time.  She gets RAVE reviews at potlucks and get-togethers.  This is an awesome pie!

This pie was GREAT and I am making for Christmas to bring over to my father in laws for christmas dinner.  I did add a little heavy whipping cream and vanilla to the sourcream mixture, about 1 to 2 tablespoons of the whipping cream, and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  This pie was GREAT and I served it about 2-3 hours after it came out of the oven and it wasnt soupy at all and it cut so clean everybody was so impressed!  GREAT recipe!..oh yeah and I also added some raspberries to it:)

I've only rated a few recipes on this site, but THIS one I had to speak up about!  WOW, what an incredible recipe!  Absolutely delicious and simple to make, too.  I didn't have fresh blueberries, but frozen ones worked great.  I'll try it with fresh next time, because I'm confident it'll taste even better.  I'd also like to try this recipe with other fruits, like fresh or frozen peaches - YUM!

This was delicious using fresh, local blueberries. It looked beautiful, too. Don't forget to place something underneath the pie pan to catch the juices.

This is an amazing blueberry pie! It's sweet and tangy. Just absolutety delightful. However, if you don't like it too sweet, cut back on some sugar because there's a lot of it!

Holy cow....what a pie.  Delicious flavor and perfect texture.  Follow the recipe as written and you will not be disappointed.  Not overly sweet like some blueberry recipes.  Just right for our taste buds.  Thanks so much for offering this recipe.

I loved this pie. It tastes good warm and cold!   I didn't want the topping on it so I left it out. I think it tasted fine without it.  I added some vanilla to the batter though.

The only reason I can't give this pie a 5 is because I didn't follow the recipe as directed so I can't say that the recipe as written is worth 5 stars.  After reading some other reviews I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and increased the sour cream to 2/3 cup.    That being said, with those two changes I must say that this pie was fabulous.  My husband can't eat enough of it and he doesn't even like fruit desserts.  It's a recipe worth keeping for sure.  Next time I think I might reduce something in the streusel, either the butter or the sugar.  It makes a lot of streusel which I love since most recipes don't have enough, but it was a little too rich/sweet.  Don't pass up this recipe!!!!!!

This is a huge hit.  I combined eggs and sour cream in a bowl and then added blueberries to the bowl.  I poured this mixture into the pie shell.  I also used brown sugar (in place of the white) for the topping.

I followed the suggestion of the previous user and reduce the sugar and increase the sour cream. This pie was amazing not to sweet and not to creamy. I must suggest that you use the Pillsbury pie crust because it just came out perfect.

Not a big fan of this one. Thought the Cream Cheese Blueberry pie was way better.  Just didn't like the consistency.  Everyone else seemed pleased and thought it was great though so maybe it's just me.

This is a late review, as I made THREE of these for the 4th of July - but they were awesome. My changes were: replace 1/2 the sugar (filling and topping) with brown sugar. Add lemon zest, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the filling. Add cinnamon to the topping.   This made extra topping for me, too (which is great - so many recipes make too little) so only 2 batches' worth was enough for the three pies.   This pie was even better the 2nd day. (I'd tell you about the third day, but they were all gone....)

Wonderful change from standard blueberry pie. It's very yummy with just the right amount of sweetness. I forgot to add vanilla as others suggested, but did sprinkle brown sugar on top with some cinnamon, which gave a nice crusty, strudel like coating. Will definitely make again!

Delicious!!  I added 1/4 t cinnamon and zest from one lemon plus the juice from half a lemon to the custard and decreased the sugar to 1 cup.  Wonderful with ice cream while still warm.  Definitely will make again

This was wonderful.  As suggested, I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the sour cream mixture and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the crumb topping.  This pie sets and serves nicely also.  I will definitely make this again, as my dad and husband fought over it.

This pie is good.  Mine took 1hr. 15 min to bake.  I think I would like it better if the creamy part had a lemon flavor to it.  I will try it again adding the lemon flavoring to the cream mixture.

Made this last night, The only thing I changed was use brown surgar instead of white surgar for the topping.  Absolute keeper, tasted great.

This blueberry pie is perfect!  The only thing I changed was I doubled the strussel.  I blended it until it was almost a dough like consistency, then used a cheese grater to "shred" it on the top for a nice even look.  I've made it for 6 different people since finding the recipe, and my 4 year old can help with every step!

I had some issues with this recipe.  I thought the topping and fillings were way too sweet.  They also lacked flavor.  I guess I expected a custard like pie with blueberries.  It was mostly blueberries with a little bit of unattractive (in texture) custard.  I expected the sour cream to have a nice tang to it, but I didn't even taste it.  Maybe if there were more custard (with less sugar) and it was a lemon custard, it would have worked.

Delicious! i rated this pie on the taste. however, mine came out a bit runny (i know this is to be expected with most berry pies) but that could be through fault of my own. Anyway this is a great recipe because you can substitute and estimate and still get a delicious outcome. I also added fresh raspberries along with the blueberries.

I don't know, after glowing reviews, maybe I just didn't make this correctly.  It was a waste of time and ingredients, including my fresh organic blueberries.  This is my first "post a review" but sorry, not even a star from me

This was perfect! We are not big fans of blueberry pie, so when we had fresh picked blueberries, we weren't sure what to make! This pie is fabulous, even for those of us who don't love fruit pies. Just as an FYI, you can use reduced-fat sour cream (it doesn't change a thing..) and you can cut down on some of the sugar if you want to because it is very sweet and you need vanilla ice-cream to cut some of the sweetness. Followed directions perectly and it came out great!!! Thanks for this recipe! Will make again and again!

This was a awesome twist on a blueberry pie. I loved it. I used frozen blueberries in the recipe and I should have added flour to the blueberries. it was rather juicy with the frozen berries. Next time I will use fresh and compare. Either way This pie was fabulous. I will definitely make it again.

Love this recipe!! I've made it 3 times in 2 weeks.  Once exactly as written.  The second time, I used 1 cup raspberries and 2 cups blueberries.  The third time I used 1 cup blueberries, 1 cup raspberries and 1 cup blackberries. I've also stared adding walnuts to the topping. Each time the pie is excellent.

Delicious!  Perfect Consistency! I don't always have luck with fruit pie recipes, but this one was amazing.  I used the hot water crust recipe on this site and freshly picked blueberries.  My husband loved it so much he asked me to make it again for his poker night.  I did sprinkle a touch of cinnamon on the top of the pie just before baking.  You need to try this recipe.  (I also tried it with red raspberried...good, but nearly as good as with blueberries)!

We really like this recipe.  It isn't too sweet and has a nice texture.  I've added other berries at times as well as a touch of lemon or spice.  It is fast and easy and is always a favorite in our house.

THIS PIE ROCKS!!!! My husband ate 3 slices and he hates fruit! I am making it for the second time in one week! The only thing I did different was to use brown sugar for the topping and used frozen instead of fresh fruit! Awesome pie thanks for the recipe. I will use 'till for the end of time!

Great alternative to traditional pie! I really enjoyed it. There should be a law that you HAVE to serve this with vanilla ice cream.

This pie completely disappeared within 10 minutes. Thumbs up from everyone. I too used frozen berries and coated them with a little flour just to help with excess thawing moisture.  I forgot to compensate for extra baking time since they were frozen so it took a little longer. The topping didn't brown the way I wanted it to so I put it under the broiler for a few minutes. Excellent!

This has a nice texture to it and great blueberry flavor.  I thought it was more of a cake than a pie however.  I used frozen blueberries and because of that, it took about an hour longer to bake.  Next time, I will either defrost first or use fresh berries.  All in all, a nice dessert.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  The pies came out picture perfect (of course everyone dug into them before I had a chance to snap a picture)!  This was the first time I ever made a berry pie and I was nervous but it came out great!  I served it with fresh whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream...YUM!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved this recipe.  I didn't change anything except to substitute fat-free sour cream.  I had a cup of fresh blueberries and the rest were frozen.  I don't like sweet desserts and this didn't seem overly sweet to me.  I tossed some fresh berries on top when serving, and that added a really nice extra tang.

This is the best Blueberry Pie EVER!! I added a little vanilla extract to sour cream mixture. I also covered the pie crust so not to burn. I recommended this to my Sister-in-law after we picked blueberries. She agreed this is a keeper.

The pie was easy to prepare and looked and smelled great.  I baked it for at least one hour. We were very disappointed though, I agree with several others, WAAAYYY too sweet.  My daughter liked the topping though.  I'd much rather have plain, old-fashioned blueberry pie;  the blueberries were lost in this.

This recipe is foolproof. I've taken to calling it 'leftover pie' because I can usually make it on the spur of the moment, using whatever fruit needs to be used up, whatever creamy dairy product I've got in the fridge, any type of flour and sugar, and it always comes out tasty.

YUMMY!!  I had a quart of blueberries I needed to use before they went bad, so I tried this recipe!!  I couldn't wait for it to cool before I tasted it  - it was GREAT!!  I bake A LOT and have not come across a blueberry recipe quite this good.  The only changes I made was to add cinnamon to the berries and used brown sugar, rather then white, for the topping. It had just the right amount of sweetness!!! I plan to make again this week for my husband's company picnic!!! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! My family and friends loved it! Let me emphasize how important it is to use a deep-dish pie crust, like the recipe says. We used a regular-size pie crust, and some of the filling leaked out over the edge of the crust while it was baking. Fortunately we had baked it on top of a pan.

This pie is AWESOME.  I use huckleberries and sometimes subsitute yogurt for the sour cream.  I also use brown sugar for the topping instead of white.  To die for!!!

well my dad made the first one but we didnt get to taste because my sister had to take a pie to school thats why we made it but apparently  her school thought it was delicious and then me and my dad made it together and when it came out it was soup so we let it sit in the fridge overnight when we woke up it was a little thicker and later in the day it reached a gooey consistency but my dad swore it wasnt thick enough so he cooked for a little longer after he did it would not thicken at all now (being him) he's making some sort of cobbler with it we did take a spoon and try the soup one time and it was still pretty good but next time we're gonna cut down the sugar

I made this to bring to dinner at a friends house. It was wonderful! I cut back a bit on the sugar and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the sour cream mixture. I also added fresh lemon zest and lemon juice to the berries. I thought people were going to lick their plates!

I'm only giving this four stars because I felt like the sour cream mixture detracted from the pie.  I would definitely make this again but without the that part.  The crunchy topping was good, the berries were good and amazingly my crust was good but the sour cream part was kinda yucky.

Very good pie.  The only problem with it was that I thought it was a bit too sweet.  Next time I make it I will not add so much sugar to the egg mixture.  Otherwise it was really good.  I liked the topping because it was very crunchy and added good texture.

Very good!  Made this for the first time for Thanksgiving.  Was a hit!  I couldn't find fresh blueberries to save my soul, so I used frozen.  Thawed and drained them in a collander first so the pie wouldn't be too soupy.  And I can't stand "cutting in" dough.  Just a pet peeve of mine, so I used the food processor.  Easy and good.  Thanks for sharing!

Definitely a keeper!  I served it to six people and all six loved it.  The only change I made was to add four cups of blueberries instead of three.

This was quite good. About the only change I would make is a bit less sugar and butter, but that reflects our tastes. It should be fairly easy to swap the blueberries with another fruit too for a variety.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The only addition that I like to do is to add about a teaspoon of cinnamon in the topping.  Other than that it is perfect, not to sweet and has the right amount of body.

This pie rated 5 stars warm from the oven and served with vanilla ice cream but the next day my Mom and Aunt said that it was very good but they liked my pumpkin pie better. I did cut the sugar by half in the pie (still sweet enough) and used half brown sugar and half white sugar for the topping. Three to four little boxes of blueberries will work nicely. The french pastry pie crust recipe (reviewer recommendation) was great . Just remember  this is NOT exactly blueberry pie ... enjoy it more as a blueberry custard dessert .

This was an easy pie to make and so yummy!! Used one pint of fresh blueberries, cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup--that worked out great. Also on the topping I used 1/2 white and brown sugar with a dash of cinnamon---what a terrific idea to give it extra flavor and make the house smell wonderful!! The pie was a big hit with my husband, we enjoyed it warmed up in the microwave for 20 seconds the next day. Will certainly make this again!!!

I made this tonight and realized just at this moment that I used a 10" deep dish plate and not a 9" inch plate.  I expected the inside of the pie to be a little creamy, but it wasn't. That may have been because of the size of the pie plate I used.  Could someone who has made this pie tell me what the texture of the inside of the pie should be like?  Also, I had trouble getting the top to brown.  My crust was getting very brown, while the top of the pie remained pale.  I covered the crust with foil, and baked a little longer, but the top still did not brown enough.  Did anyone else have that trouble?

I love this pie - it was so easy.  I did use less sugar in the cream mixture (about 3/4 of a cup).  And I used half brown sugar, half white sugar in the topping - which was delicious.  Next time I might use almost all brown sugar for the topping.  Using thawed and drained frozen blueberries wasn't a problem.

This is a GREAT recipe. I use 4 cups of Blueberries in a 9" deep dish.  I have made this many times and the last time for Thanksgiving I used the French Pasty Pie Crust [from this site].  Everyone loved it and even 3 days later a piece of the left over pie crust was very flaky when taken out of the Microwave.

I give this 5 stars as a sugar free pie.  As I have a diabetic relative, I made it crustless and substituted pourable Splenda.  It had a nice taste without being too sweet.  I used sugar free frozen, unthawed blueberries right from a bag, which was fine.  I did have to cook my pie for about 1 hour and 10 minutes to get the top a little browned.  Maybe this was because I'd used the frozen blueberries. As I used a 10" pie dish (I was afraid it might bubble over) and didn't use a crust, the pie wasn't high.  I still enjoyed the taste.  I may experiment with adding more blueberries.

I thought this pie was pretty average.  The topping had too much sugar in it and was a bit "crunchy" due to the white sugar in it.  Just not my cup of tea.

I am a baker at an assisted living facility. I tried these pies recently and our residents loved them. I even made some sugar free pies. It was easy, fast and very delicious. I always read reviews and usually consider any changes if they are consistently recommended.

Absolutely blueberrylicious!! Super easy and quick to make, was a hit with my guests.  Very few ingredients and whipped it up in 15 minutes. I used about 3 cups of blueberries (simply because I didn’t want leftover berries-using 2 cups would’ve been fine)  and increased the other ingredients slightly—this recipe is impossible to mess up. It took longer than advertised to bake probably because of the increased berries, but it was worth it.  It’s now a must-do favorite for all our guest visits.

I made this with my granddaughter for Thanksgiving. It is surprising easy and very tasty. We made a few additions like a sprinkle of brown sugar and nutmeg on the top. My oven is slow so we cooked it a little longer. It set very well and is  not too sweet. This is a keeper!

This has to be the best blueberry pie I’ve ever had! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a teaspoon of vanilla to the custard and I sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on the blueberries. My family inhaled it and they are begging for more. Delicious!

Update: I picked more blueberries this weekend so tried the recipe again paying closer attention to the amount of sugar that I used vs. left out.
For the custard filling, I used 2/3 C. white sugar
For the crumble, I used 1/3 C of sugar, but I packed light brown sugar into half of the measuring cup and topped it off with white sugar.
Perfection!!

This pie was delicious! My co-workers and their husbands agreed.
I used a frozen Marie Callendar's deep-dish pie crust and blueberries that I had picked myself at a local farm the day before. 
Many reviews mentioned how sweet it is so I decreased the sugar a bit but next time I will cut the sugar in half to account for the sweetness of fresh Washington blueberries.

First time I followed other reviewers' suggestions to add vanilla to custard and cinnamon to crumble and change half the white sugar to brown sugar. Those suggestions were all good. However, I also reduced the total amount of sugar based on some reviews, but this was a mistake. To me the custard did not balance with the topping. So, second time I still used other suggestions even added a tad more vanilla, but I did not reduce the amount of sugar. In fact, I used 1/3cup white, 1/3 cup brown and 1/3 cup Splenda and it was perfect. I gave 4 stars even though we loved it because I do not believe it would be as good without the addition of vanilla, cinnamon and brown sugar.

Update: I have now made this pie 4 times in the past month... my family LOVES it.

This is the only blueberry pie I make.  This time I used fat free yogurt instead of sour cream. I can’t remember what it tasted like with the sour cream so I hesitate to say it was exactly the same but I can say that it was still delicious.  I love the crumb topping.  An excellent pie!

An easy pie to make.  I just didn't feel fruity enough.  I would add more blueberries if I were to make again.  I also decreased the sugar in the filling to 2/3 cups, and it was still plenty sweet.  As recommended by other reviews, for the topping I used 1/2 flour and 1/2 oatmeal and brown sugar.  I like very much liked the toping this way.

This pie was good, but too sweet for my taste. Maybe it was the streusel topping? Next time I’d go with 1/2 to 3/4 cups sugar in the custard, depending on the sweetness of your berries. Mine weren’t very sweet, but 1 cup of sugar was overwhelming.
I didn’t go with my instincts & made the streusel as directed with white sugar... Definitely go for brown! And add a splash of vanilla or almond extract to the custard as well.
Note: the topping gets soggy after a day, so make sure to eat it sooner than later. 
Best part of the pie was the crust! Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe from this site.  :)

Excellent!  I don't like the idea of my blueberries being on the bottom of the pie and the custard on top so I was tempted to stir the blueberries in with the custard before pouring into the deep dish.  I decided to follow the recipe to the letter and am very happy I did.  There were plenty of blueberries bubbling to the top when I pulled it out of the oven.  

Our guests, who have dined with us many times, implored us for the recipe - a first!  The woman, who would usually bring a dessert to our dinner parties, said she was going to stick to bringing appetizers as she didn't want to compete with anybody who could make desserts this tasty.

This recipe is easy and produces spectacular results.  FWIW, I used fresh blueberries from our garden.

This was just wonderful, the creaminess of the custard compliments the blueberries excellently, and the texture that the crumb crust adds makes it fun.  The entire dessert has a richness to it that is a great contrast to a traditional blueberry pie that can have a cloying sweetness.  I did make a substitution of yogurt for the sour cream (a standard substitution in our house, we always have greek yogurt on hand).  The crust I used was the Butter Flaky Pie Crust, and I highly recommend that crust with this, it adds to the overall richness.

I have made this pie several times using the recipe End it is always turned out great. This time, I did not have sour cream but used Greek yogurt instead. I also used a combo of sugar and Stevia for the sweetener. It turned out delicious. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was exceptional.  I lost power halfway through baking and it still came out excellent.  I added a pinch of cinnamon to the topping, but that was the only change I made.  If you have an abundance of blueberries, try this.  You won't be disappointed.

I’ve tried 3 blueberry recipes this summer and this is my favorite. I think the portion of the crumb topping is just right. It looks like too much at first but after baking, it’s the correct proportion for the pie. I will cut back on some of the sugar in the filling next time.

This is my new favorite pie, we all love it! I did tweak it a little bit... I added cinnamon to the custard mixture. I read other reviews that said there was too much topping but I decided to go ahead and pile it on top anyway, thinking the whole time that it was way too much. Boy, am I glad I did because it was awesome. Everything kind of compressed down and it was delicious! I've made it four times now and it is perfect. we often eat it cold out of the fridge for breakfast.

I make this pie every year for my boyfriend's birthday. Someone in the comments changed the recipe slightly and I've been using that one for the past couple years.

Great pie.  It enhanced the blueberries and intensified their flavor instead of covering them up with sugar.

I was disappointed in this pie. I did make a few changes after reading the recipe and thinking that it had a large amount of sugar.  Then I read some of the reviews where they were cutting the amount of sugar so I followed suit and used 3/4C. in  the custard.  I  also used 1tsp. of vanilla extract.   The streusel I used 1/4 white and 1/4 brown sugar.  If I ever made this again I would use just brown sugar.  The pie just didn't have enough flavor and I am going to throw the rest of it in the garbage.   Very sad.

For the top crumbs the recipe on here says to use white sugar. I tried making it for 30 minutes adding more sugar & flour wondering why how it kept coming out as a doughy mixture. Watched the video & realized the recipe is wrong & they use brown sugar not regular sugar.

Blueberry pie is my least favorite, and my husband isn’t crazy about it either. But when I ended up with more blueberries than I knew what to do with, I tried this recipe. Fantastic!  Truly the best blueberry pie I have ever had!  I followed the recipe to the letter, but did add 1 tsp of cinnamon to the topping, as one of the other reviewers recommended. I’m glad I did, but just because I like cinnamon. I’m sure it would have been just as awesome without!

This is by far one of my new favorite recipes. It's a delicious, creamy, Blueberry pie that isn't that sugary. Best yet, it is so fast. I made this in about 10 minutes, and could easily make that 5 minutes the second time around knowing the recipe.

I make a lot of great recipes from All Recipes but I rarely write a review. I made this pie as directed and I have to say it is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!  If you love blueberries or blueberry pie you will love this. Very simple to make. As a side note, took longer to bake.

It was tasty, but I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup in the custard.  I also used 1/2 cup Brown sugar in the topping in lieu of white sugar.  I may make it again, but I will try other recipes first.

This was one of the better blueberrie pies I’ve made and it drew rave reviews!  I loved it.  My family loved it!  I can’t wait to use fresh berries this summer as mine were frozen.  Still an awesome recipe I will use again. 
I mistakenly used twice the butter in the topping so I added extra flour and no one seamed to mind!

Bake time was actually longer than stated--it didn't set .  Too sweet for my taste and I won't make it again.  I would rather just have a good  [lain blueberry pie.  Waste of time for my tastes.

This was delicious as written. I did not think that it was too sweet and I’m not a big dessert fan.  My husband is and he thought that it was great. I did add 2/3 cup of sour cream as others had suggested and it was very moist. This recipe is a keeper. It is as good room temp as well as warm.

I added 1 additional egg and replaced the sour  cream with all natural yogurt, not the Greek style just good old plain yogurt. In addition I added 1/8 teaspoon pure almond extract and 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extra. The sugar I used was my 4 month old home made vanilla bean white sugar. OMG sooo delish.

I am obsessed with this pie and so is my entire family. I make it for every holiday and special occasion (birthdays included because, pie). There's never a bad time for this pie. It's not too sweet, the tartness in the fresh blueberries really creates a beautiful balance in flavors. It's buttery and crisp on top with a perfect velvety smooth center. 
Make this pie, you won't regret it.

My 10-year-old daughter chose this recipe to enter in a neighborhood pie baking challenge. She won and three people asked for the recipe! She made it just as the recipe states and used a homemade crust. This is an amazing pie!

I made this pie for my sister’s birthday and my husband was thoroughly disappointed when I sent the rest home with her. He requested it for his birthday dessert! I used frozen blueberries that I let thaw and it turned out great.

I have made this pie twice and we love it. I used frozen blueberries the first time and mixed a little flour on them and it worked great. The second time I didn't use the flour and the bottom crust got a little mushy from the blueberry juice. this is now our favorite pie! easy to make and delicious.

This was definitely easy.  Made it exactly as written & it has been declared a winner by the family.  Next time, the only change I will make is to reduce the sugar in the streusel a bit as I found it too sweet.  Other than that, it is great as is.

Made this for Thanksgiving with some  frozen blueberries I had in the freezer from 2 summers ago. Otherwise I followed the directions as written and it turned out so well! I loved that ithe slices didn’t fall all over like regular blueberry pie can sometimes. And the sugary crumble topping was so sweet and such a nice texture. I did have to bake it quite a bit longer than the recipe said, probably due to my frozen berries (I didn’t let them thaw much).

One of the best pies I've ever made. I only made one change. For the flour in the custard I used half flour and half custard powder. I cut it while still warm and it came out perfectly. I also used 10% Liberte Vanilla yoghurt. Thank you for sharing.

VERY GOOD PIE!!!! Delicious warm with ice cream, or cold. 
Note to self: 5lb box of fresh blueberries makes 4 pies. Triple the custard filling; double the strusel topping (perfect amounts). Bake convection 325 for 1-hour and 10-minutes (or longer as needed till not jiggly in the middle).
ADJUSTMENTS: Custard Filling: reduce sugar to 3/4-cup, increase sour cream to 2/3-cup, add 1/4-tsp cinnamon and 1-tsp vanilla. Topping: use brown sugar instead of white, add 1-tsp cinnamon.

SO easy and delicious! 3 cups of blueberries was enough. Did follow the suggestions for cutting sugar to 3/4C and touch of vanilla.  It is sweet enough with the crumble (did add cinnamon). I did not have any sour cream and used 2/3C of fat free Greek yogurt and it came out wonderful! Husband approved!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I make it exactly how it states.  I've added cinnamon before but the hubs doesn't like it with cinnamon.  My family and I pick blueberries every summer at a farm by our home in Maine.  We usually pick around 40 lbs a summer.  I freeze some, I make jam and then...I make blueberry pies.  After I make them (between 10-20 depending on year), I freeze them.  These freeze amazingly! I bake them a bit before freezing them as this recipe has eggs and sour cream in it.  I wrap them in cling wrap, aluminum foil, and then a freezer bag and stack these babies (labeled of course) for dessert throughout the summer, fall, winter and spring.  The pie takes a couple hours to cook once you take it out of the freezer; however, you will never know it was frozen.  Friends of mine can't believe pies that were made a year before are still so fresh, not mushy at all.  This is definitely my 'go-to' for blueberry pie for any day at all!

I agree with JasonERF, if you get to a boss battle and the boss STEALS YOUR PIE/CAKE go after it.  Fight long and hard, and vanquish your foe to win back your pie/cake.  I made two of these July 4 alone, and all had rave reviews, using the 2/3 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup sugar ratio.  You don't need the sugar, you really don't.  But I did use full sour cream, not the light, and added the zest of half a lemon, as well as lemon extract because I can't afford vanilla these days.  I also switched some other things up a little because I can't help myself, this evening I'm not using a pie crust at all but trying it as a sort of cobbler, with just the berries I picked with my 2 sons today and the afore mentioned lemon zest, juice and extract.  It's phenomenal.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was pretty good. It's easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand. Personally, the crumble topping was a tad too sweet for me so I'll probably lower the sugar content a bit the next time I make this. I think it tasted better a day old and cold from the fridge.

I'm afraid that I will eat the whole pie.  I like sweet desserts and I agree with another reviewer.  I would cut back on the sugar just a little but that's about it.  It woke me up in the middle of the night and I needed to ear anther piece. Yikes!

This was excellent !! Used  3/4 cup white sugar, 2/3 cup of nonfat plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream, added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1t vanilla extract. For the topping, I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup AP flour, 2T butter, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

Made this recipe per previous reviewer's alterations. Next time I make it I will go to 4 cups of blueberries fresh not frozen. And use the full amount of sugar in the custard. Made it for my daughter's birthday she said it was awesome so that's all that matters to me. Others said it tasted good wife wanted more blueberries. Really good and held together well thank you for the recipe .This was my first attempt at a pie.

I used yogurt instead of sour cream, went a little easy on the sugar, and rolled out some frozen (fresh-made) dough to 3/16", using a tart pan.  Absolutely wonderful, super-fruity result, which holds together and cuts well yet yields to fork-cut bites easily--look forward to making it again!

I have made this pie half a dozen times throughout the year. It has been fabulous every time.  As other reviewers have suggested, I have made it with the vanilla extract in the custard and without and I can't tell much difference. I have used the brown sugar instead of the white sugar in the topping and I do like the brown sugar better. I swear this recipe could make two pies. I always end up with extra custard and topping.

One of the best blueberry pies, especially if you don’t like too sweet desserts.  Creamy, I use fresh blueberries.

Greek yogurt pie!!  I don't keep sour cream around the house, but frozen blueberries and plain greek yogurt worked great!  I did cut the sugar back a bit,  and this is a huge hit with my family.  I will be making this again.

Absolutely the best blueberry pie ever! My family and friends rave about this pie every time! The cream filling takes this from  just all pie and really dense to a really light treat. The topping makes this a real winner. The topping is crunchy which is a nice match with the filling!

It was delicious!!  I made it in a deep dish and made a 1.5 batch to fill it. Used stevia instead of sugar for the pie and brown sugar in the topping. Like others suggested I used some cinnamon and vanilla. One of the men at dinner (who is an accomplished cook) exclaimed " Now this is my kind of pie, lots of berries, great flavor and moist!"  I will be making this again and again!

Fantastic - based on reviews I added a dash of vanilla to the custard.  I also bumped the blueberries to 4 cups for my deep dish pie plate, but did everything else as written.  Wonderful results - already made an encore. Brava!

I made this for the first time and I'm glad I read the other reviews because it was amazing! I upped the sour cream to 2/3 c. and brought the sugar down to 1/4 c. For the crumble on top I used 1/4 c. of brown sugar and 1/4 c. of coconut sugar. That made it tasty. Thanks for the recipie and I will definitely make it again :D

This is a probably a really nice pie for people who aren't crazy about fruit and prefer less intensely sweet baked goods. I made this recipe almost as written except I halved the ingredients to fit a regular-sized pie crust and I added a pinch of cinnamon. The result was the least sweet pie I've ever had and not as blueberry-flavoured as I prefer my blueberry pies. I really love blueberries, so for me the cream layer washed out the fresh, fruity punch. If I bake this recipe again I'll add with extra berries and a little more sugar.

Very easy pie to make. More delicious, fresher  and way cheaper than a store bought pie. I substituted plain nonfat Greek yogurt and it was great. I used the entire 1 cup sugar and it was very sweet but I didn't think it was TOO sweet (for a pie), though I'll probably cut it in half next time for health reasons. I mixed 3 TBSP butter, + 1/3 C each of flour and white sugar for topping and I only used about half of it.

The pie was a huge hit with everyone.  The only change I would make is to use less sugar for the topping.  A little too sweet, but nice crunchy texture is a great contrast for the pie.  Will absolutely make again.

This pie is actually as good as the reviews say. It's also beautiful and holds together, unlike other traditional fruit pies. I was nervous because it looked almost like a quiche as it was cooking, and it did take longer in my oven than the time listed, but I finally took it out when the centre looked just set and it's amazing. And I forgot the salt. Looking forward to serving it to a group tomorrow!

I have been making this pie for several years since I found it on Allrecipes.  We all love it.  I love it because of the blueberry taste that comes from fresh blueberries, it cuts clean without tearing up the pie and it is not too sweet.  I follow the directions as they are written except for adding a few more blueberries if I have them.  It is my favorite recipe for blueberry pie.

I  made the pie exactly as recipe directs except for blind baking the crust 8 minutes and cooling before adding berries and custard plus crumb topping. 
  Defititely easy to prepare,and the berries don't get crushed. The resulting pie is lovely, but so sweet I had a hard time swallowing even with unsweetened coffee.  The topping actually crunched with sugar.  That might be caused by the organic sugar I used, as I have noticed the crystal structure takes longer to disolve than the popular store brand.  I found I had more crumble than needed but put it all on the pie anyway.  Next time I will reduce the sugar in topping from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup, and from 1 cup to 2/3 cup for the sugar in custard mixture.  Meanwhile,  I include a dollop of sour cream on the plate so I can add  some to each bite  to temper the sweetness.  It's actually quite good that way!  Overall a great recipe and I will definitely be making it again!

We really enjoyed this pie. It's so delicious and only takes about 20 minutes to put together if using store bought pie crust. Leftovers were even better the next day. 
Whenever I can, I try to cut down the sugar and the fat content of recipes to keep treating my family to delicious food without guilt. So here again I did the same. Little less sugar in the filling and the topping and also used low fat sour cream and cut the butter by 1 Tablespoon in the topping.

I have used this recipe three times already! I used 1/2 of sugar where it's called because I wanted to eat it with ice cream. It's still plenty sweet to me. I used blueberries cirst, but tried blackberries, too, as they are growing everywhere. They turned out as good. Thank you for the recipe! :-).

Loved this recipe and so did everyone at the dinner party I took two pies to. I read lots of reviews and doubled the recipe to make 2 pies but I didn't double the sugar. I did about 1.5 times the sugar. Also added cinnamon and vanilla as well as fresh lemon zest per others suggestions. Have to say it was delicious and I am typically not a hugely successful baker. Thanks for the great recipe! mine were done baking in about 57 minutes I think.

This pie was exceptionally good.  My family loved it, and they are picky eaters.  I made some suggested changes by another reviewer.  For the struettel I added a little more butter and cinnamon and baked for 60 minutes.  I would make it again.

Really nice. I'd say it may be one of the best pies I've made.  I used homemade kefir cheese instead of the sour cream.

Really yummy!  My husband said it was too sweet, but I thought it was just right.  Next time I will try with less sugar.

I made this, but followed changes on Mel's Kitchen Cafe blog.  It was good, but I was expecting to love it and I did not!  Even though her revision calls for 1 egg, it still tasted eggy to me.  I further reduced sugar from the 3/4 cup to 2/3 cup, and it was still plenty sweet esp with the streusel.      Good, but not great.

Delicious recipe. I used less sugar than called for, both in the pie and for the topping and it was still great.

In one weekend, I made THREE of these pies because they kept getting devoured by us and our guests. Such an amazing pie recipe! I would wake up in the morning and find the pie place empty in the sink!

This pie is FABULOUS!!! I made a few of the changes as suggested by other reviewers. I used half white & half brown sugar for the topping & added the cinnamon. I also added the vanilla & cinnamon to the custard layer as well. Everyone loved it & I took the advice of others & went ahead & made two!!! EXCELLENT!!!!

Absolutely delicious!!! Use a Pillsbury frozen pie shell. Added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to custard portion and a dash of salt to the crumb topping, otherwise followed recipe. Everybody at the dinner party I brought it to said it was so good. Cooked mine 1 hr 15 minutes until it really looked like it was browning on top and on the sides of the crust. It puffed a bit in the center. I was worried it wasn't fully done because it was a bit jiggly in the center, but it firmed up as it cooled (it fell a little in the center) but was fully cooked.

I added a little lemon juice to the custard before baking and reduced the topping to  1/3 cup sugar and flour. Cut down on the super sweet taste!!! It was a great hit in my house!!!!

Just took this pie to a church potluck and got lots of good comments on it. I did change it up a bit as others advised, cutting back on the sugar a little (3/4c), increasing the sour cream to 2/3c, adding a tsp of vanilla, a tsp of cinnamon, and the zest of one lemon. It was not overly sweet, and in fact, although it was sweet enough with the reduced sugar amount, I don't think it would have been overly sweet as written. I used brown sugar instead of granulated in the topping as well, and cut back on that and the flour to 1/4c. I left butter as is, only because I wan't thinking, but ultimately it was pretty yummy that way! It's peach season here in the South, so I'm going to try this recipe with peaches next time.

So easy and so quick. Not too sweet. I didn't change a thing except more topping, it's so good. Served cool on a hot day makes a perfect ending to a meal.
Going to try it with other fruit as the berry season rolls around

I mostly followed the recipe, except I added 50% more blueberries and custard to split between 2 normal/shallow pie tins. I also threw a few teaspoons of cinnamon into the topping! I've made this 3 times so far (6 pies now, wowie!) And will definitely make more! All my friends loved it!

This pie is delicious and not as sweet as many blueberry pies can be. Made it in a deepdish pie pan filled with fresh, plump blueberries, but I doubled the streusel topping just because we really like streusel. I also baked the pie crust for 5+minutes before adding the berries. My picky husband (who doesn't care for blueberry pie because most are too sweet for his taste) loved it so I can't wait to make it again...and share with the neighbors!

very good pie.  I did fallow some of the other reviews and cut back to 3/4 cup of sugar in the custard I added 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk and an extra 1/4 cup sour cream with a splash of vanilla kept the custard perfect I think my husband loved it too.

This was great i did use only 1/2 cp sugar and added a tsp of vanilla and cinnamon to the filling.  I also substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar for the topping. The next time I make it I plan to ditch the pastry crust (at the very least cutting off the rim of the pie crust) and add some lemon juice to give it some tart since i used frozen but I think that the moistness and the topping was amazing.

I made this for the first time and used frozen mixed berries that I wanted to finish. I only used a small amount of crumb topping that I had left over from making an apple pie so it had a little cinnamon in it. I used two extra large eggs. It was delicious! I have been asked for the recipe it was so good!

We usually make this pie a few times every summer when blueberries are in season. It's one of our favorite pies!  We make it just as written. It always gets rave reviews!

I get so many compliments on this pie.  I suck at crusts so I use the Pilsbury ready made kind.  I add 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon to the sour cream mix.  I'd add more, but my husband thinks cinnamon in general is too overpowering.  He likes the addition though.

Yes, I made it with blackberries yesterday, and blueberries today, love this pie! The first was for a luncheon! The second for my husband! I will most definitely make this again. We grow a lot of our berries so I'm always looking for new things to make

Yum!! I made this with Ruth's Grandma's Crust from this site and I've received SO MANY compliments!! I've made it as is and with the less sugar/more sour cream suggestion (I prefer the change more). What I've actually done is put the majority of the topping on, then put on a lattice crust, and put the rest of the topping scattered on top of the crust. Delicious!!!

This is my new favorite pie!!  it's easy to make and tastes great. I did make an addition to the pie, I added 1 cup of blackberries in place of 1 cup of blueberries. It gave the pie a little bit of tartness so that It wasn't too sweet. This pie can be eaten warm as well as cold, but I think it's better after spending the night in the fridge!!

There's a reason this is a five star recipe. I made this pie using the recipe for Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust also from this site. It was absolutely amazing! My family is still talking about it. I took it out of the oven just before we sat down to dinner and by the time we finished dinner we were too impatient to wait for it to cool completely so we dug in and ate it still warm from the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This is my first time making a pie and it was out of this world. I hope that this tastes just as good with frozen blueberries because I intend to make this pie year round!

Made this pie for a BBQ with friends. It was gobbled up in less than 30 minutes. Delicious! My favorite quote " I don't usually like fruit pie but this is awesome. Is there more?" I made the original recipe exactly as directed. The only change is I would suggest covering exposed crust edges for the first 30 minutes of baking. Mine got a little too brown.

I wasn't sure what to expect in a creamy blueberry pie, but I wasn't disappointed!  I did have to increase the bake time by about 20 minutes because the center of the pie didn't set in 55 minutes.  I would recommend cooling for at least half an hour before cutting it so that the slices won't fall apart.  I will definitely make this again, and I have already shared it with a few friends since I made two of these on my first attempt.  Highly recommended!

This pie was very good.  I used 3/4 cup sugar based on the reviews but will add the whole cup next time as I did not find it that sweet.  I will make it again.

This was my first recipe I've ever made and it was very easy. I made this blueberry pie for the 4th of July and everyone loved it! I bought a 9in Graham cracker pie crust from the store and the 3 cups of blueberries seemed like a little much at first but it worked out in the end.

I always had trouble with blueberry pies that had too much liquid and didn't like trying to compensate with flour or corn starch.  No need with this one!  I use frozen blueberries, which I thaw out first.  I drain off any excess juice before I put them in.  I also use a lot more berries than the recipe calls for, but I still don't have a juice problem even so.  I also add a dash of almond extract.  Tastes delicious and it's never runny!  A hit.  Also have tried a few finely chopped walnuts added to the crumbly topping - delicious.

This was great.  The custard makes a wonderful medium to show off the blue berries.   If I redo this recipes ( the pie lasted 1 hour with four college kids here), I would treat this pie less like an apple crumb ( vanilla, cinnamon) and add lemon ( zest, juice. Powder) to the custard.   I'd cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup, or even 1/2 cup if using all the topping (which adds a lovely contrast texture, I would use all of the topping second time around).   I wonder if cranberries would work........

Just had to make this pie. Sounded good and it definitely was. A little short of blueberries, but added about a cup of frozen strawberries. Also used a shake of cinnamon in the blueberries, and the topping. Great pie, - a recipe to keep.

Mmm very good, but made some adjustments:
1. Replaced the sour cream with fage 0% Greek yogurt
2. Reduced sugar to 3/4 c in filling
3. Used brown sugar instead and reduced to little less than 1/2c in topping.
4. Also used a mixed berry frozen mix-still delicious
5. Added in some cinnamon 
*Recipe as is definitely makes more than enough topping to generously cover the whole pie.

If I could give this 10 stars I would! I used 1/3 cups coconut sugar and 2/3 white sugar for the custard. It was my first time ever using the coconut sugar in baking so I went easy. This was dreamy, creamy, delicious. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

This is a fantastic base recipe. I followed the other users suggestions regarding the changes in measurements and addition of lemon peel and cinnamon, but I also made it GLUTEN FREE. I seriously think this could be the best dessert I have ever baked! My non-GF family was raving about its goodness! I used Bob's Red Mill GF pie crust mix, subbed the flour in the filling with white rice flour and subbed the flour in the topping with almond flour. The nuttiness of the topping was excellent. I would suggest cutting back on the butter if you use almond flour because there is already fat from the nuts.

At the 4th of July BBQ it was a split house - the in-laws LOVED it (father in law had 2 pieces), but the husband and I didn't love the texture. Reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup for the custard and it was perfectly sweet.

This is perfect- much better than the starchy blueberry pie and so simple.  I added some vanilla to the custard, lessened the sugar as suggested but kept the same sour cream.  I took it to a church function and it was gone.

It was DELICIOUS!  Very pretty once cut, too.  Like a dense blueberry muffin with the strusel on top.

THIS IS A KEEPER!  This pie is fantastic.  I couldn't stop myself from eating two slices as soon as it was cooled down.  I mean seriously, this pie will blow your mind.  I endorse adding vanilla to the custard and cinnamon to the topping.  Otherwise this recipe is right on point. I also made this with fresh blueberries and it was just a perfect bite of summer.  My compliments to Susan for this recipe.

I made this recipe and it was so delicious. I am an avid pie maker and this just might be the best blueberry pie recipe ever. My kids rarely eat pie, but this one was gone in one sitting, so I made another one 2 days later. I did decrease the sugar in the custard filling to 3/4 as suggested by other reviews. Other than that I use the exact ingredients. I did have to cook it for 65 min, then turned the oven to 400 for another 5 to brown the top.

This was a good pie, but If I make it again I will cut out some of the sugar. I love sweets, but it was a little too much for me.

Oh me oh my oh!This pie is dangerous it is so good! I have made it 3 times now and it has been a huge hit. I made it for Easter and I wish I would have sent it home with my son because I am tempted to eat the last four pieces all by myself! I made it exactly like the recipe and I would not change a thing. Why tamper with perfection? Easy to make too.

This pie is extremely easy to make - too easy.  I thawed an expensive organic pie crust accidentally and I didn't want it to go to waste. I only had frozen blueberries and pineapples on hand so I decided to try this recipe and I'm so happy I did.  Frozen blueberries, Splenda blend sugar, whole wheat flour and Greek yogurt were the substitutes I had on hand and used with great success (and possibly a tad bit healthier to boot).  My husband and toddler daughter were crazy for this pie. I will no doubt be making this again and again.

Okay I changed the recipe a lot but it came out great. I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Reduced sugar to only 1/3 cup instead of 1 cup, and halved the ingredients of the crumb topping. Came out great! Not too sweet, which is the way I like my bakes. :)

This was so easy to make.  My husband had never had blueberry pie.  He said this recipe was a keeper.  I thought the sugar was just right.  I look forward to making this again and trying some of the variations that are listed from other cooks.  Thanks for such a wonderful pie recipe.

I very good pie.I used frozen blueberries and it was still great. The filling is cakey, but if you like that kind of thing like I do it is no problem. The crumb topping is delicious and I very much recommend making this!

Delicious either warm or cold! I've made this with frozen blueberries, as well as frozen mixed berries. I like the original recipe; however, cutting the sugar to 3/4 c. doesn't hurt the flavor or texture. My husband (who never willingly eats sour cream) was pleasantly surprised that the pie tasted nothing like sour cream.

We loved this recipe hot or cold it was one of the best pies I have ever made and it was so easy!! I did cahange a few things though, I used spelt flour instead of white to make it gluten free, raw suger instead of white, and yogurt instead of sour cream. I also only had frozen berries but it worked out well. I would use this recipe with peaches, blackberries, rasberries, apples... anything.

I'm not much of a pie person, but I had fresh blueberries from picking.  This pie is awesome!  I might be a pie person now.  I made it with the Pie Crust IV recipe from this site.  I will make it exactly the same next time.  Only thing I did that was different from the recipe instructions was to bake about 10 minutes longer than called for.

I made this recipe yesterday, my first blueberry pie.  At the suggestion of BunnysOven, I increased the sour cream to 2/3 cup; for the streusel topping instead of 1/2 cup white sugar, used 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  The only other change I would make is when adding the sugar for the custard, I would reduce the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  It turned out a little runny after baking, but we had it the next day and it was perfect.  Very easy to make also.

This is the ONLY blueberry pie recipe you'll ever need! I made it as dessert for a dinner party, and my husband almost had a hairy fit when he saw me putting sour cream into a blueberry pie. It was by far the BEST pie, blue berry or otherwise, we had ever had. It was a big hit with our guests and they all wanted the recipe.
I do recommend doing what other reviewers have suggested, and that is to add a teaspoon or two of vanilla to the custard and sprinkle cinnamon over the berries.

This pie was wonderful.  I used a 10 inch pie plate and added more blueberries and one extra egg. Added vanilla to the egg mixture and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. Used part brown sugar and less butter for the topping. Hard to wait for it to cool before cutting it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This pie is wonderful. It's my husband's favorite and he asks for it all the time. I have subbed in other berries and it works just as well. I like a mix of different types of berry.

I wanted to make a pie that didn't require 2 crusts.. As I wanted to use a frozen store bought pie crust.. Found this one on your site.. It was SUPER EASY to put together... And I followed the directions to a T. It turned out perfect.. And tasted even better... My family loved it... And devoured it !

This recipe is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I made it according to the recipe, and also watched the video just to get a visual. Everything was just as easy as it said it was. What I loved most is that you don't have to cook the custard over the stove before pouring it into the pie. You just mix, pour, crumble and bake! My family loved it, especially my food-critical father. I am stocking up on blueberries before fall to freeze them so I can make this fantastic pie again in the fall and winter months too. All I can say is YUMMY!!!

I halved the recipe and used a graham cracker 6inch crust.  Accidentally put 1/2 cup of sour cream when I halved it and it was still sweet. I like sweet, but maybe I would put less sugar next time! Very good and so easy to make!

This recipe is delicious and solves the problem of runny blueberry pie. A couple notes before you bake:

1) Definitely use brown sugar for the streusel. White sugar was pretty boring on mine. This pie would also work just fine with a regular pie-crust lid.

2) Depending on the kind of crust you use, baking time may need to be way more than 50 minutes at 350. My crust was all-butter, and I needed to bake the pie for about 80 minutes to get it to brown at 350. This didn't affect the filling at all... don't worry, it won't burn.

3) Depending on how ripe the blueberries are, you may not need a whole cup of sugar. If they are ripe enough to eat fresh and don't seem very tart, DON'T use a whole cup!! My berries were very ripe, and I used a little over a half-cup of sugar and the pie was definitely sweet enough.

4) Three cups of berries is VERY conservative. I used two dry pints of berries (about five cups) and there was still room for more.

Great pie and super easy. I cut the Sugar in the custard by half and added a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg. It was plenty sweet.

I was underwhelmed by this recipe. The custard wasn't really much of a custard. Maybe I did sometime wrong but it was way too thick. More like a slightly soggy pound cake than a custard as far as texture goes and it kind of drowned out the flavor of the blueberries. It was still worth eating but it didn't go nearly as quickly as the traditional blueberry pie I made last year. Will not be making this again.

I made this to celebrate with my Dad, he's a big blueberry pie guy. This was good. Slightly different texture than I was expecting. Tastes like blueberry muffins with a hint of pie. I did add the vanilla to the custard and used a mixture of brown and white sugar for the crumble.

Love this pie. And family devoured it. I already made it a second time this week. I did reduce the sugar in the custard mix so the sweet didn't overwhelm the flavor of the blueberries with great results. Added cinnamon to the crumble and vanilla to the custard and it turned out fabulous. Definitely a keeper.

We followed the recipe (didn't add vanilla or cinnamon like many suggested in the reviews) and it was pretty good. Everybody at our house seemed to like it however, I think next time for curiosity sake we will add the cinnamon and see what that is like. Not too sweet either. Would have been awesome with some ice cream.

This is so good, and really easy to make!  I used a pre-made frozen crust, and thawed it for half an hour, then baked it for about 15.  I then continued with the recipe.  I did make a few changes…..I added a spoonful of vanilla with the egg, and used brown sugar instead of white when making the topping.  I can't believe that it's made with sour cream, it's so delicious!  Everyone who has tried it has loved it.

This pie was to die for!!!  So easy, so delicious, I'm in awe.  I did make a few tiny alterations.  I added vanilla to the custard, used one whole egg and two yolks rather than 2 whole eggs and added cinnamon to the streusel.  This will be a new recipe in my rotation for sure!

This is fantastic! On my second time I pre-baked the pie shell for 10 minutes with foil on edges. I added the zest of 1/2 a lemon over the blueberries and 1 teaspoon Almond Flavoring to custard mixture. This gave it a light fresh taste. I also added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon an 1/4 cup Old Fashioned Oats ground fine to the crumble topping.

Very easy and delicious! I had a regular (non-deep dish) pie crust so I cut the servings from 8 to 6 and it was the perfect amount of everything. I also used equal parts fresh blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries, and then added a little vanilla to the filling and cinnamon to the topping as others had suggested.

Very good pie.  I made it for Christmas and it was a hit. The only change I made was I used half of the amount of sugar called for in the recipe.

Excellent!  I used frozen blueberries so I increased the flour to help with the juice.  Also sprinkled some cinnamon on the custard before putting on the topping.  It needed all of 55 minutes in the oven but the topping browned lightly in that time without overly browning the crust.

This pie was a wonderful! I have never made a blueberry pie before, in fact It's only my fifth pie, and it turned out excellent.  I did not have a deep dish pan so I used a regular pie pan and reduced the blueberries by half a cup and left out some of the custard mixture, using enough to fill the crust. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to the mix. I used a homemade butter flake crust and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the topping. My boyfriend, who doesn't normally like fruit pies, couldn't get enough so I'm making another one today. Delicious!

Excellent pie! Definitely not "blueberry coffee cake as one has warned! Warning: do not eat right out of the oven. My husband and I did and we were eating blueberry soup! Put in fridge and let cool for a few hours or overnight before eating. Tastes really good the next day warmed up and with ice cream on top. This lasted about three days in my house of two!

I made this pie after buying three lbs of blueberries and not knowing what to do with all of them. I don't eat blueberries but my husband seem to really enjoy it with ice cream. It was super easy to make. I did add a splash of Vanilla to the filling (because I add vanilla to everything).

This recipe was great. I followed others recommendations by cutting back a little on the sugar, adding some brown sugar, as well as adding a little more sour cream, adding some vanilla and sprinkling some Cinnamon and a little lemon juice on top. After cooling for two hours it was absolutely perfect. I dare anyone to challenge me to a pie making contest, I would bet the ranch on this one- this pie is that good.

4 stars only because I had to tweak it a little.

I brought this to a bbq. Overall everyone seemed to like it. Personally though, I thought it was incredibly sweet with the streusel topping. If I was to make it again, I would definitely cut down on the amount of sugar used in the topping!

Very delicious pie!  I used splenda in the pie and then splenda white and brown sugar in the topping.  Definitely agree with other reviewers that vanilla and spice need to be used, along with a little extra sour cream.  I used Chinese Five Spice in the filling and the topping.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

great recipe. A nice diviation from traditional pie when I have lots of blueberries to use. Store the leftovers in the fridge though, b/c they tend to get soggy if left on the counter

So good. I'm going to try it with peaches tonight. I will also add a tsp vanilla to the sour cream mix. It seems like it's better after it has had time to sit for several hours and has had time to set up. Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent. The only change I made was I added 1 1/2 tsp. Of cinnamon to the topping and added a little vanilla with the blueberry mixture.

I used fat free yogurt (Fage greek strained) instead of sour cream, cut the sugar in half, added vanilla and lemon, and used half blueberries and half bing cherries (leftovers from another pie).  It's very good, but the fruit tasted a bit artificial, despite everything being local and organic.  I may pull the vanilla next time and add lemon zest as well as juice to ramp up the tartness.  I also used a bit less fruit, as it was leftover fruit from another pie, and cut the sugar in the sour-cream mixture.  It has a wonderful texture, and the yogurt worked perfectly.  Will definitely make this again, and will continue to fiddle with it to get that truly farm-fresh flavor.  Since I tweaked the heck out of it I can't fairly rate it with 5 stars, and the artificial fruit flavor was a detractor, albeit one my hubby didn't notice!

This recipe caught my eye and I needed to try it. I am diabetic and shouldn't be eating this stuff, but I had a bunch of fresh blueberries from the farmer's market that needed to be used, so I had no choice, did I? :-) I did try to healthy it up a bit though. For the sour cream mixture, I used nonfat sour cream, skipped the salt, cut the the flour to 1/4 cup, and the sugar to 1/2 cup. For the topping I cut back to 1/4 cup each of flour and sugar and 3 T of cholesterol free margarine. In the end, the result was good, but the blueberry flavor was not strong even though I used 3 heaping cups of berries. I shouldn't make this again, but if I am weak again, I would definitely add more berries. :-)

I used more blueberries and less sugar in the filling. Added a squeeze of fresh lemon to the offset the sugary topping.  Never thought I'd like a struessal topped pie, but this recipe was very good.

The best blueberry pie, wouldn't change anything, followed the recipe exactly, using fresh blueberries that where not that sweet. The filling was tart and the topping was sweet, This recipe is a keeper.

It was just okay.  I used 2 cups of blackberries and 1 cup of blueberries because I was trying to use them up.  I would give my version 2.5-3 stars, but I rated this 4 because I think all blueberries would have been better.  The crumbly topping was very good.  The filling was nothing special.  I probably won't try this again, even with all blueberries.

This pie was a hit at our christmas dinner party!  I did cut back on the sugar in the filling to 3/4 cup and did 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar for the topping.  I also added vanilla to the filling and cinnamon to the top mix as suggested.  I'm glad I did!  I used fresh frozen strawberries (thawed).  I made two pies, and it was hit with everyone!

Delicious! I used canned blueberry pie filling. It was still very good. If you use pie filling, use half of the ingredients in step 1, otherwise the pie content will overflow the pie crust.

I've made this pie twice and it was excellent both times.  My co-workers could not get over how wonderful it was. For a brief moment in time I was the toast of the office and then, the pie plate was empty and it was business as usual!

Great pie! My mom loved it so much, she got the recipe from me and then entered the pie in a blueberry pie contest and won first prize!

VERY VERY GOOD! Didn't really taste creamy to me, but delicious. The only difference in the way I made it is that I used whole wheat flour, because that is all I ever use. I also used fresh blueberries, as the recipe states. Overall, an absolutely delicious pie. I will definitely make this again.

Wow, this pie is amazing! So warm and gooey and comforting. Just took it out of the oven and am enjoying a warm piece as I type this review.  I personally used frozen blueberries, added vanilla and lemon juice to the sour cream mixture, and used brown sugar and cinnamon in the topping.  To die for! I plan on making this for Thanksgiving... thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

Delicious and so easy.  Followed exactly but added a capful vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon to the sour cream mixture.  I would say it needs a solid hour to cook in the oven and I would probably use a little less of the crumble topping next time (in other words, not all of it - maybe half instead).  Wonderful blueberry pie.

Making no  changes to the recipe...I am not a fan of blueberry pie, better yet, I am not a big fan of pie, period.  Then I tasted this recipe.  Wow, what an amazing spin on a traditional pie that is normally rather plain.  I get asked to make this during the summer all the time.  I even make it as thank you gifts for friends and neighbors in the summer.  As I stated earlier, I am not a pie person to begin with and obviously, everyones taste buds are different, but I would have to say this pie is on the list of the 5 best pies I have ever eaten.

When my husband saw me take out the sour cream to make this pie he almost choked. He was sure I was going to ruin it. But I'm a little embarassed to say that at this point, this pie is about 12 hours old and more than half way gone and that's just between the two of us. Yikes! It is that good!

amazing recipe, very sweet. i cut back a little by using light sour cream and substituted brown sugar for the crumble topping. i also used 2 16oz bags of frozen blueberries defrosted and drained. my pie was oozing with berries and wonderful! 3 hours in the fridge and 1 hour in the freezer help it set up perfectly.

I have tried many different blueberry pie recipes but this is by far one of the best. I made it first for my wifes bible study group,they are a good group to judge the different deserts that I make and they also thought that is pie recipe was great.

This wasn't what I expected, and I wouldn't call it creamy. I made some changes: added a tsp of vanilla to the sour cream mixture, used frozen thawed blueberries, and used half brown and half white sugar. It does set up nicely and holds up well, so that's a plus. I'm going to make it again, but with different fruit.

Absolutely delicious!! My alterations: Added 1 tsp vanilla to sour cream mixture. Used brown sugar (instead of white) for the crumb topping and added some cinnamon to the crumb topping mixture. Served hot with ice cream and whipped cream. Company raved over it! This is definitely a keeper!

Definitely room for experimentation with this recipe. I used 1/4 c. sugar and 1/4 c. splenda granular for the filling - like other reviews, it depends how sweet your berries are and how sweet you like it. I also added tsp of vanilla and of cinnamon. For crust, I used pastry dough and pressed into bottom of dish, baked until light brown, then added filling.  For topping, I used 1/4 c. oatmeal and 1/4 c. flour, and substituted brown sugar instead of regular white. The overall consistency came out more like bread pudding (maybe I added too much flour to the sour cream mixture?), but it was still wonderful!

This was awesome. I made it during the summer for my family and everyone really enjoyed it.  I love blueberries and didn't want to make the traditional kind of pie.  The only thing that i altered was the topping, I used brown sugar as well which made it even more tastier! It's been awhile I think I need to make this again soon!

I made this pie for my friend's B-day party and everyone loves it!! :) I took some people's advice to cut some sugar(used 3/4 c) from the sour cream mixture, I also put more sour cream(2/3 c) and left about 1/4 mixture behind. It seemed to be a bit tart for me but I get comment from other people that it was just right bc it brought out the flavor of the blueberries. I don't know, the pie was gone in like 10 seconds, I just got a small bite of it. I guess how much sugar depends on how sweet the blueberry is, mine was tart. I will keep the same amount of sugar and use all the mixture the next time and see how it goes. Thanks for the recipe!!!

It was good, not the best.  I really liked how the pie wasn't runny, made a nice contrast to traditional blueberry pie.  I didn't have enough sour cream on hand so I added about an eight of a cup of vanilla low fat yogurt.  My blueberries also rose to the top and the cream sort of settled to the bottom.  Also reduced the amount of sugar, probably will reduce it more next time.  Tasty though!

This is such a yummy, easy pie!  You can use any kind of fruit.  A favorite in my house is peach/strawberry - delicious!  Also, put a little cinnamon in the crumble topping.

I am not a person who usually enjoys fruit desserts (I always go for chocolate) but OMG! This was delicious! A crowd pleaser at Christmas Eve!  I added some cinnomen to the crust, and a little extra sour cream...it was really easy, even my kids were able to help! Thankyou for making me a fruit lover! I will definitly make this again.

My nine year old daughter made this and it was fabulous!  We are trying it again with yogurt and frozen blueberries.  Awesome.  I like the way it stayed together and was not overly sweet.  Thanks so much!

We picked ten pounds of blueberries this summer. When we came home, I immediately found this recipe and made one. With all of the blueberries sitting in the freezer, it is a permanent addition to the repertoire now. My mother-in-law has even given her stamp of approval on this one.

Wow this pie turned out really good. I used low fat yogurt instead of sour cream. I baked it for about 60 minutes. I also used vanilla and I sprinkled some cinnamon on top. WOW delicious pie I have already made it three times.

I served this at a family gathering and everyone loved it. I used frozen wild blueberries (these are the small ones), which I thawed. I love how it stays together instead of spreading across the plate like so many other blueberry pies!

Just as the reviewers have stated - this was delicious! I did add just a squeeze of lemon to the blueberies (used 3 1/2 cups), reduced filling sugar to 3/4 cup, added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon to filling, and for topping did 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white sugar with 1 tsp of cinnamon. Took about 65 minutes to brown up nicely at 350 degrees. So delicious with vanilla ice cream.

This came out soo good.. I just used my regular size pie plate & crust, and didn't have any spillage problems. I used 3 cups of frozen wild blueberries (the small ones) and had to let it cook about 15 extra mins to saok up the liquid. Everyone loved it!

Best pie ever!!  This was an immediate hit, no one could believe it was a homemade pie.  Keeper!  The only additions I made was sprinkling cinnammon into the crumb mixture and added 1 tsp of vanilla to the sour cream mixture.  Can't wait to try with strawberries.

Blueberry pie is my fav, as a former chef I have had many blueberry pies and this is by far the BEST I have ever tasted, we added an extra 1/2 cup of berries to fill the deep-dish, & it worked fine

My husband asked for a blueberry pie for his birthday and I decided to try this recipe.  The recipe was wonderful despite the fact that pies are not my specialty.  I did have to cook it longer since my crust did not seem done on the bottom.  The only change I made was to add the zest and juise of one lemon since I just like that flavor combo.  Great redipe,  Thanks

This pie is divine!  I think many berry pies lack substance or anything to hold the berries together.  This pie solves that problem.  It was so good...even reheated in the microwave.  It is very sweet, but that's how I like it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This pie is delicious. I used fresh berries. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the sour cream mixture. The pie baked up nicely in about 55 minutes. Be sure to try this variation on a standard blueberry pie. Your family, like mine, will love it!

I baked this with my friends so that we could take it to our math teacher when we visited him during winter break. We used frozen blueberries, but other than that, we followed the recipe exactly as written. The pie was delicious, and we served it with vanilla ice cream. I also baked this again to give to my friend for her birthday. She absolutely loved it!

If you enjoy a very sweet blueberry pie, this is the recipe for you. My husband proclaimed this to be one of the best things that he has ever eaten, which is really saying something. He remembers not really liking his aunt's blueblerry pies, which were less sweet, more runny, and had more blueberries, so if what I just described is more the pie that you are used to, you may want to look for another recipe.

Very good pie. I've always been afraid to make blueberry pie, but this was very easy and very good. I used a frozen pie shell that was not a deep dish crust, so I used just under 3 cups of berries and didn't pour all of the filling in and though it shouldn't have mattered, I didn't use all of the topping. I started at 375 and turned it down after 20 minutes, went a total of 60 minutes probably, and should have tried to cover the edges with foil at the beginning, but it didn't get too dark. Didn't have to wait for it to cool completely either and my husband and I each had two pieces. I really liked it, although I wasn't totally astounded so didn't give 5 stars.

Fantastic dessert.  The blueberries taste fresh, not cooked.  I served it cold and wow! it was tasty.  I agree that it was just the right sweetness- not sugary, not too rich.  My only change was to bake it at 375 because my Betty Crocker book said to bake pastry at least at 375 and being new to pies, I followed her advice...it browned just fine.

This pie is OUTSTANDING.  My entire familiy loved it and thought it was amazing (and I have 3 kids who aren't big fruit pie fans). I followed the recipe exactly...except for adding a little cinnamon in the batter.  I saved back a few blueberries and placed them on the top of the topping before baking.  It looked really nice.  GREAT RECIPE...GREAT PIE!

I found this recipe to be way too sweet and you could hardly taste the blueberries. It was also still soggy in the middle after an hour so I would definately increase cooking time.
I think next time I will cut the egg/sourcream filling part in half and see if that makes a difference. I like that it's not just plain blueberries but definately needs tweaking.

This pie is fantastic! And I don't usually like pie all that much-I made this for my husband and we both loved it. I replaced the sour cream with low fat plain yogurt to cut down the cholesterol. Will definitely make this again!

LOVED THIS! Made it in a deep dish pan and used extra berries. Took it to a cookout and have had several people email me for the recipe. To keep it from running after it cools down from the cooking - put it in the fridge!  Wish I had a piece now!

I made this yesterday and it's got to be easiest pie I've ever made. I used pre-made refigerated pie crust. As others commented, it did take a bit longer to bake, about 60 minutes before the topping was slightly browned. This pie is delicous and I didn't change a thing, except I used about 3.5 cups of blueberries instead of 3. Next time I think I might try vanilla or lemon yogurt in place of the sour cream, just to see how it comes out. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing it with us!

I just wanted to review this one, even though I didn't find the recipe here.  My mom made this one for me and I love it.  So naturally when I moved out I asked for this one.  I just made it the other day, kept some for me and my boyfriend and took the rest to work.  Everyone LOVED it!  What a great pie!

I first made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit, but I didn't review it right away. Came across the recipe again and made it for my family. It was as delicious as we remembered and will keep it and make it again and again. I liked the idea of using different types of fruit.

Yummy dessert, but not spectacular. As other reviewers said, the topping was on the sweet side. If I make it again, I will either make less than 1/2 of the topping or not use it at all.

I would have given this 3 stars, but my guests really enoyed this one.  I thought the sour cream mixture masked the flavor of the blueberries.  In the future, I'll stick with traditional blueberry pie.

This is a fabulous recipe!!!  Super easy, it probably went together in 5 or 10 minutes!  I like sweet pies, so I made a few changes for my sweet tooth.  I used a deep dich pie plate, and a homemade dough that I had in the freezer.  I increased the blueberries to about 4 cups, used half white and half brown sugar in the sour cream mix, and doubled the topping.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of turbinado sugar sprinkled on top - that made it crispy and delicious.  Definitely five star!

This was good, for a change.  I think I prefer regular blueberry pie to this.  If I make this again, I would probably add a bit of lemon juice.  I like my pies a little more tart.  I would also try brown sugar instead of white to try for a richer flavor.  Maybe needs more topping too.  Don't get me wrong, this was a good pie, but it needs a little something to make it 5 star, in my opinion.

We liked this, but I'm not sure I'd make it again. (Maybe if I had only one crust, as I did this time.) It tasted good, but I'm discovering that I don't like the texture of flour as a thickener in fruit pies. The crumble topping was too crunchy/hard for me, although my husband liked it. We both found the pie to be too sweet.

This pie came out tasting like two different desserts. If I make this recipe again, I would use less of the cream/egg mixture and more blueberries. I would also mix cream/egg in with the blueberries instead of spooning it on top. I assumed the mixture would sink to the bottom and coat all the blueberries, but it must've been too thick to do so and baked on top of the blueberries. The product looked very nice. And the "two desserts" tasted good, but they probably would have tasted better combined as one.

The best blueberry pie!  I decreased sugar to 3/4 cup in the cream mixture and used combination of brown and white sugar for the topping.  It turned out great but I think I might try all brown sugar for the topping next time; it was bit crunchy.  I served it to 11 people at a dinner party with some ice cream on top and they all loved it.  Not too sweet, just perfect they said.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was not a very sweet pie, and no one raved about it. (There were three of us eating it). We each ate our individual servings, and ended up throwing out the rest of the pie. I would not make this again, and I'll keep looking for a good blueberry pie recipe.

I baked this for my family of 8 and it was complimented by all. One of my sisters even deemed it, "almost storebought" because of the professional look to it. I didnt have enough blueberries but used a bag of mixed frozen berries instead. Delicious!!!

Perfect was all I could say when I first tasted the pie. It is the best blueberry pie that I have ever eaten. It was not too sweet and held together well when cut. I did not have the sour cream so I substituted the low fat yogurt that I had instead.

Wow! This was fantastic! Made it last night and with giving out a few pieces...it is already gone. I did use a bit more sour cream than called for and glad I did. It was so yummy!

I didn't think this pie was that tasty, and it wasn't creamy.  Next time, I'll just make a regular blueberry pie.

Delicious!  This recipe will replace my ordinary blueberry pie recipe as we all loved the consistancy the "cream" made to this pie.  And it's even better the next day!

One word.....YUM! I made it exactly as written and it was delicious! I didn't find it overly sweet like others apparently did. I used the French Pastry Pie Crust recipe with good results.

My boyfriend thinks it's the best thing I've ever made.  Used brown sugar for the topping instead of white & used canned (in water) blueberries.

I must say this is one of the best pies I've ever had.  I used frozen berries, and they turned out a little harder than I liked so next time I will cook them a little first, but there will definately be a next time (which is pretty extaordinary in my house).

We have made this one many times.  Turns out GREAT every time and always a big hit. Used the "French Pastry Pie Crust" this last time and was so easy & the crust stayed very flakey even a few days later, even when reheated in the microwave.  We will never go back to "store bought cursts."

This is the best, and only, bueberry pie I make.  My husband declared it the best pie he ever had, shared with his mom, who declared it the best SHE ever had.  She shared with HER mom, who declared it the best SHE ever had.  I added a sprinkle of cinnamon, and a few drops of lemon juice.  Perfect!  And I never liked blueberry pie.  Thanks!!

This pie is delicious, regardless of whether you eat it cold, at room temperature, or warmed in the oven (our favorite).  I added an extra cup of blueberries so didn't cut back on the sugar in the filling, used 3/4 cup of sour cream, and added a bit of grated lemon peel (one lemon).  I put a bit less sugar in the topping as some people suggested, and added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  We didn't find the topping too crunchy at all...it was perfect.  I baked the pie at 400° for 20 minutes, then reduced the temperature.  It didn't require any additional baking time.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I think you could use it for raspberries and cherries as well.

This is the best blueberry pie that I have ever tasted.
Went over very well with all family members. Even with the picky eaters.

We  thought that this pie had a very good flavor except it was a little too sweet. For some reason the pie also did not set well. I let it cool completely before cutting it but it still fell apart when sliced. Directions were followed exactly.

This is a great recipe.  I used frozen blueberries and tossed 1 tsp. cinnamon with the blueberries before adding to pie shell.  My husband really enjoyed this pie.

I substituted frozen blueberrys, but let them thaw and drained the excess liquid.  I baked this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!  Guests even asked for the recipe.

What a fantastic pie! It takes very little time and yields great results. The whole family loved it, we tried it with raspberries and it was equally good!
