This was awesome and even my picky kids liked it.  I followed the recipe as well as added 2 cups of mushrooms, 2 Tbsp butter, 1.5 cups of milk and 2 Tbsp flour.  Made a creamy sauce.

Followed the recipe exactly using Farmer's Market veggies. Hubby said it was the best thing I have ever made. Granted, 90% of the work was the Buitoni ravioli :-).

This was a good recipe. I had to cook the green beans for an extra 10 minutes, and still they were really crunchy. Also I added some sliced fresh mushrooms!

Delicious!!  The veggies were so flavorful, especially the tomatoes - and using the cook time in the recipe they came out perfectly (usually I overcook or undercook them).  The one change I made was to use Buitoni meat raviolis instead of cheese.  A yummy, healthy, and very importantly QUICK & EASY dinner.

This was great.  When I went to the store to get the ravioli, the 9oz pkg just didn't seem like enough for 4 servings.  I bought the 22oz pkg.  I love pasta and vegetables in olive oil.  Added some crushed red pepper for heat.

Yum. My husband liked it, which says a lot. I just cooked the green beans separately and then added them after the squash was tender.

Outstanding! And to top it off it's actually healthy!

P.S. I added a little bit of artichoke, and topped it all of with a red sauce.
