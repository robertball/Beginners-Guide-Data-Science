I tried this recipe and it was a hit.  So simple!!  I put a small dollop of whipped cream on top of the lemon curd and the blackberry on top of that.  Include a sprig of mint leave and you have a very pretty presentation.

The puff pastry I used for this recipe needed to be completely thawed and rolled out before cutting, but turned out puffed and flakey as desired. It made about 2 dozen tartlets that I filled with lemon curd. These are very simple to make and look very fancy. Definitely a good way to make use of leftover filling.

I've been looking for something to do with my one sheet of puff pastry, and this was perfect! The technique works great although I did have to let my dough thaw longer than 2-3 minutes to get it to open up. I made these lemon berry tartlets for an early Valentine dessert, and they looked very elegant. Can't wait to try it again using pudding or mousse or even flavored whipping cream.

Followed the directions exactly and it turned out wonderful!  Just make sure you use something sharp to cut the dough.  I didn't have a cookie cutter so I just used a glass.  The pastries will puff better and more evenly if you slice through the dough instead of mashing through it.

YUM.  Stevie in particular LOVED this and wants it for her birthday!  Made napoleons and larger tarts with berries and kiwi for nicer presentation. 

EASY!

Very tart, but oh so delicious! I'd probably tone down the tartness since my wife won't eat them otherwise.

I prepared this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. The only change I had was that I replaced lemon curd with vanilla jello combined with lemon zest.

Ok, I don't make pastry dough. I haven't made curd. And I used frozen berrys. But these are crazy easy and they go like hotcakes.

I will give this a 5 star because although mine rose, they were irregular in shape.  But from reading other comments, it may have been because I used a glass and did not puncture the edges correctly.  They looked very elegant and I will be making these on Christmas Eve and hopefully will find a proper cookie cutter.

I made this and I made the lemon curd to go inside of it.  I only had strawberries on hand as my black berries aren't ripe but they work just as good.  We really enjoyed it.

I made these for Christmas to give to my neighbors.  I used a melon ball tool to make the middle cutout; it was the perfect size to use with Xmas cookie cutters.  I used sugar free vanilla Jello pudding mix and I decorated with a raspberry on each treat and slices of kiwi on the plate for red and green for Xmas.

I defrosted the pastry first, unrolled it flat and then put it in the freezer again for a few minutes so that it would cut better. But, for some reason my pastry didn't puff up, perhaps the egg wash crust prevented the pastry from puffing? I'll try it without the egg wash next time. Other than that, they're lovely bite size desert.
