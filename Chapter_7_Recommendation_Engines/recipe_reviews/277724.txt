I am missing the "Thai" flavor. This dish was basic, I added much less fish sauce. ( my previous experience with Fish Sauce is be careful) Not a low salt recipe for our house, add salt if you like. Was more flavorful after resting a while( second serving) I did add some fresh chopped cilantro when serving and that flavored it up a bit. I may try this again.
