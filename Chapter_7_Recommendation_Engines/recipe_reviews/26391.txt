This is better than pre-packaged mixes. Omit the flour in the mix. If you'd like to thicken your chili, use refried beans instead--no one will notice-I promise! Use 1/4 cup at a time until it's as thick as you'd like it. Use the seasoning mix as follows: for a small batch of chili use 2T of mix with 1 lb meat of choice, any other veg additions and 1 can of drained/rinsed beans (or about 6-8 oz dry beans, cooked), 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can reg sized can tomato sauce. For a bigger batch use about 4T of mix with 2 lbs meat, 1 pound of dry beans (cooked) or about 3 cans rinsed/drained beans, 2 cans reg sized tomato sauce, 1 (or 2) cans diced tomatoes, and some water if you'd like to thin it. This is only to give others an idea of how much mix for the beans/meat/tomato ratio. It's very forgiving. This makes a very very good plain ole fashioned no frills chili. Also, if you want this just warm...decrease pepper flakes to 1 tsp--it's still plenty warm for those who don't like it hot (like me!). I did jump up the chili powder amount to 2 level TB instead of 4 tsp. This is a well-rounded mix--I was not left with that..'there's just something missing' feeling. It was ALL there! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I will never buy a package mix again. I did make a couple wee changes though. I added a tsp seasoned salt and increased the sugar to a TBS. I also left out the minced onion since I used a whole chopped onion sauteed with the meat. I used this with my beer chili recipe and the results were amazing. My husband couldn't stop raving about it even the next day. Thank you, thank you!

This seasoning is right on! I was making a recipe that called for chili seasoning mix since I was out, I used this and it worked perfect! From now on I will use this instead of the store bought kind!

The only drawback to this recipe is that it doesn't have directions of what to add with the meat.  I pretty much followed the directions for the seasoning...I doubled it, and added it to 3 lbs. ground beef/turkey mixture with two cans diced tomatoes, a small can of tomato paste and a can of Ro-tel tomatoes.  It was delicious!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I give this two stars because the flour overpowers the mix.  I'm sure it is great leaving out the flour - but then I wouldn't be reviewing this recipe as posted.  I was going to toss it - but saved it by adding (ironically) a packet of taco seasoning - which diluted the flour.  Thanks anyway - will actually make this again - but without the flour!

So good! I love to make homemade instead of the prepackaged mixes (that I have no clue what is in them). I used a little bit less red pepper (I only had the flakes). The rest I followed the recipe. Used this with Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili from this site. Big hit tonight! I really appreciate these homemade mixes!

I never buy mix anymore. I don't add flour and I up the chili powder and cumin a little and decrease the pepper flakes a tad. I've been using this recipe for a couple years now. These changes were made after making the recipe as stated and tweaking over time to suit my family. I used the tweaked version of this in a chili cook off and won second place. First place was a white chili. :) This is good stuff! (i'm cookinmama a previous reviewer but had to sign up under a new name) I still use the amounts I reviewed in that review. This is the bomb!

I will use this from now on, and this is coming from a girl who refuses to use chili "season packets", but as a previous reviewer stated "this is right on"!  I added a tbsp. more chili powder and a can of Red Gold "picante" tomato sauce to our adult version and it was fantastic!  No need to use the jalapenos, hubby liked it just fine.  Thanks so much Sara!

Used in a pinch when ran out of packet mix.  Made entire recipe but used 1/2 tablespoon onion powder and 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder.  Used 3 tablespoons of prepared mix for 1 lb of meat chili recipe.  Tasted great!

Triple the recipe as written and it fills a pint jar nicely. Keeps well. I use 2 Tablespoons of mix to one pound of meat or beans.

I will never buy a packet of chili mix again. I was skeptical when I saw the ingredients and decided to take a chance, since it had so many great reviews. I left out the flour, sugar and salt. My chili did not need the flour or sugar, but I did season with salt to taste as I was making it.  I used the Debdoozie's chili recipe on the site, and it was the most amazing bowl of chili I have ever eaten (Hubby loved it too!) I suppose I am not really reviewing the recipe as written, but at the end of the day, it got me where I wanted to go...I am now a believer in making my own chili seasonings, it is wonderful to not worry about all the "unpronouncable" ingredients in the store bought packages. Thank you so much for posting!!!!

In my opinion this recipe as written is not good at all!  The flour is completely un neccesary and actually makes the chilli taste like flour.  There should be double the amount of chili powder, and some cayenne pepper as well

I appreciate Cookin Mama's review.  Spot on using no flour and using 2T per pound of ground beef, etc.  I also toned down the heat as she did by reducing the red pepper to 1 t.  I made double when I realized this recipe would make about 4 small batches of chili.  Now I have enough to keep on hand when I'm in a rush.  I may even try this for burritos.  Thanks, Sal, great recipe!!

I ran out of the prepackaged mix so i decided to try this.  I won't be buying chili seasoning anymore.  I did follow the suggestions to reduce the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp. for a more mild chili and also to increase the chili powder to 2 TBSP.  My kids don't like a lot of spice.  This was perfect!

I was out of packaged chili seasoning mix and found that I had all the ingredients for this recipe.  I wasn't too clear on how much chili this would make, so I ended up using it for 1.5lb turkey meat.  It was really spicy but super delicious!  I'm never going back to the packaged mix, especially when it's so easy to make myself.  I omitted the flour and used an 8oz can of tomato paste to thicken.  Next time, I'll cut down on the red peppers.

I made up a double batch of this to use in Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili. I had everything I needed on hand and it was a whiz to mix up. Now it's looking so pretty stored in a clear glass jar in my spice cabinet. Tastes great and more economical than store-bought.

With a few modifications, this is excellent!  I know it is not fair to change recipes and then critique.  However, I left out the flour and sugar, reduced the red pepper to 1 teaspoon, which was still a tad too much.  We are not wienies when it comes to heat either.
   I used 1lb, ground beef, nearly 3/4 of a #10 can of tomatoes and a lb. of kidney beans.  I used all the seasoning that the recipe makes.  
  It was seriously the best chili seasoning recipe I have ever tried....and I have tried quite a few.  This is so easy to make, there is no reason to buy the over-salted, packaged mix....

This was really good. I was hesitant about the sugar, but I made this per the directions other than omitting the flour and substituting 1 tsp/each of onion powder and garlic powder in lieu of the 1 Tbs of each minced. Some of the reviews of this recipe kinda butt-digg over the flour ingredient. If you've ever made chili from a seasoning "kit", it usually includes "MASA", which is only added as a THICKENER.  Flour is the wheat-equivalent of MASA which is made from corn. Long story short, if you don't need to thicken your chili, don't use the flour.  I made venison chili with this using 4 lbs ground Bambi, 2 cans mild Rotel, 1 can Ranch-Style beans-undrained, 1/2 can water & 4 Tbsp of this seasoning. Let it simmer uncovered for 'bout 30 minutes, then covered for 'bout an hour. Serve with cornbread, over rice/chips/crackers, or with guacamole.  I'm from Louisiana and I live in Texas, so take it for what it's worth when I say my chili turned out  good.

I made some slight changes based on other posters. I left out the onion and garlic and used Mexican oregano instead of basil.I used Ancho Chili powder Used about 2 tablespoons per pound of ground beef. I added fresh onion and garlic to the beef as it browned. Thanks for the great recipe. I won't be buying the packaged junk anymore.

Made this over the weekend when I realized I forgot to buy my usual packet at the store.  So happy with the results!  Didn't have basil so I used oregano and it was great!  My husband asked what I did different to the chili?  He loved it too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is fabulous.  My husband won't allow me to make any other chili now that I found this seasoning.  It definately has a bite to it, but we enjoy it that way.  And I leave out the flour because I usually add tomato paste to my chili and let it simmer for a few hours, so it's thick in the end.  I have found this this works best for a small pot of chili and I ususally double or triple the recipe for leftovers or company.  Thanks for the recipe.

Per other reviewers who said it did not need flour. Did not add the flour or sugar. It does not need sugar if it is slow cooked. I used 4 full rounded tsp. of chili powder, 1 level teaspoon of chili flakes & everything else was according to the recipe. I used 5 T. of this Seasoning for 1+ pound of each of the following: Ground Sirloin, Ground Chicken & Ground Pork, all mixed together in one pot! Cooked the "meats" with 2 diced onions, drained fat. Used four regular sized cans of chopped stewed tomatoes and 1 can Hunts Garlic & Herb Tomato Sauce (big). Sorry for the lack of measurements. This is great seasoning for "Family Friendly" Chili. Pouring rain outside, fire in the fire place, everyone fed! 5 stars! Everyone liked it. Will probably be in even better tomorrow!

This is my go-to recipe for chili. I use it in place of the packaged stuff in a family chili recipe, and it is absolutely wonderful, such great flavor.  I do make some adjustments based on my family's taste - I swap 2 tsp of the chili powder with ground ancho chili powder and only use 1/2-1 tsp of crushed red pepper to tame it for the little guys, but then have the red pepper on the table for the heat-lovers.  Also, I usually make that chili in a crockpot (original recipe was for stove top), so I add the flour in about the last 30 min of the cook time.

I used to buy chili seasoning kits whenever I'd want a pot of chili. Thanks to this recipe, I don't have to do that anymore. The only thing I do differently is adjust the amount of red pepper flakes depending on who's eating it.

Good recipe.... I used fresh chopped onion, the minced garlic in a jar (which I use for everything), and a fresh pepper and it turned out great!.  Oh and I skipped the flour.  It does need a little more chili powder in my opinion.

Like many other reviewers I went to make chili and discovered we were out of the chili seasoning packet. We loved this seasoning mix and won’t be buying the packaged stuff again! Because we use fresh basil, which we don’t use in chili, the basil was omitted and because we love smoked paprika I added 1 teaspoon of that, I put a note to increase it to 2 teaspoons next time I make it. I did not use the flour as our chili doesn't need thickening.  After scrolling and reading many other reviews I was a little weary of the hot spicy taste so I used the recommended 2 tablespoons (from another reviewer) to season almost 2 lbs of burger and then added another 2 tablespoons after I threw in all my other chili ingredients and allowed it to simmer. There is some spice but it does not burn, it’s a really nice blend that our two year old grandson could handle; then again he likes spicy queso.   The end result was excellent, great recipe!

Perfect! Used 1 1/2 tsp. each of garlic powder and onion powder since I didn't have either in dried, minced form.

I don't like to mess up a recipe's rating by just asking a question so I wrote 5stars, but I'm wondering how much kick this recipe has with so much red pepper added?  I used it in slow cooker recipe that called for chili seasoning packet but was afraid it would be too spicy for the kids, so I reduced the pepper flakes to a teaspoon.  Any ideas?

I thought this was just great as is!  Just a great spicy kick so if you don't like spicy you may want to cut back on the crushed red pepper.  I will use this instead of buying those seasoning packets.

I skipped the flour my chili is already thick enough. I also added one TBS of cocoa powder. My chilli recipe: 2 lg. (26 oz.) cans of tomato soup, 1 lg. (26 oz.) can of chili beans (Bush's) in chili sauce, and 1.5 lbs. ground beef (cooked), 3.5 TBS of seasoning, mix everything together  in acockpot and let this simmer and cook all day long. By dinner it is delish. The cans of soup make it easy but it still tastes great. Then I served it with Cheddar Bay Biscuits from this site. This was terrific.

This was the perfect blend of spices for red chili! I used 1 teaspoon of garlic powder instead of the minced because I use fresh garlic in my chili and used oregano instead of basil because I didn't have any. Will never use store bought ever again!

I omitted the flour and 1 tsp of parsley (I only had 1 tsp left in the jar) and added 2 TBSP of the mix to about 1.5 lb ground beef, a can of kidneys, a 16 oz can of crushed tomatoes and an 8 oz can of sauce... figured I would add the flour if needed... and I didn't.  Probably if I went with diced or whole tomatoes I would have. The taste is awesome... a little spicy... I like it and my husband likes it... let's see if the kids like it!!  May adjust season in the remaining mix to taste after dinner.  Thanks for a great & versatile recipe!!

We have actually used this several times. I will make chili at least once a month here in cold country lol. I make it exactly as its written add 2lb home grown beef, roughly 6 cans of rinsed beans any variety ( we like to mix them), 2 green/red peppers, 1-2 cans diced tomatoes, 3 cans of tomato sauce diced onion and the entire bowl of seasoning into my crockpot, then add water to the brim( its really not that much) where it sits on low for 6-8 hours.

 As for the comments on the flour made it taste like flour in order to change the chemical structure of the flour it has to be hot enough long enough then it blends nicely. Just as if you were making gravy, if it doesn't cook long enough it tastes the same. 

Hope this helps :)

I loved this! Took the advice of others: reduced flour to 2 TBLS, added additional chili powder and used garlic salt vs minced garlic.  Used apprx half the batch for homemade chili recipe I have and have the remaining half for a future use. I am so excited! Remind me why I buy seasoning when I have it all at my fingertips?? Thanks again for posting this recipe.

I love trying new chili recipes as chili is one of my winter staples.  It's very easy to whip up your own batch of seasoning mix to have on hand rather than run to the store if it's not in your pantry...ask me how I know! Plus, I like having control over the seasonings/heat/salt and don't have to worry about msg or other preservatives. I've already made several batches of this and will be keeping it "in stock" to use in my chili from now on and will not be using the pre-packaged chili seasoning mixes any more.  I definitely recommend making several recipes at once if you make a lot of chili.

Great seasoning. I made it for Debdoozie Blue Ribbon chili. I didn't have minced anything so I used powder and it came out fine. I skipped the flour and used tomato paste for my chili. It made just enough for the chili recipe so there was very little waste. I don't like it real spicy so I also skipped the rep pepper.

I guess I forgot to rate this.  Yeah I won't use store brought mixes ever again.  This is way better than them.  Even my mom loved the chili I made and she's not a chili person.  Thanks so much.  I did omit the flour as some suggested.

I have used this seasoning many times when making Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili (also on this site).  Leave the flour out, and you are left with a very good, flavorful seasoning.

The best chili I've ever had!!! I added all of these ingredients except the flour and replaced the dried onion and garlic with fresh (with an additional 1/4 tsp black pepper) to 2 lbs. ground turkey, can dice tomatoes, small can tomato sauce, and can chili beans. It was the first time I did turkey and I thought it would be bland. Wow, was I pleasantly surprised. It was so flavorful! I immediately made a second batch to store in my pantry for next time.

I never did realize there was chili seasoning at the store.  Every time we made chili, I would just use what we had in the cupboard.  This is a great flavor and it saves time for me & especially for my husband when we are making chili. Thanks!

Omg, so good!  I think I made it a bit too spicy, but it might be because I did heaping teaspoons of the chili powder? Not sure. Could be the red pepper too.  But wow was it good.  I too used it for Debdoozies Blue Ribbon Chili recipe on this site.  My husband and picky children even loved it, despite it being too spicy.  Thank you for the recipe!

I wish I had found this recipe a long time ago.  It's wonderful, and I will always keep a batch of it on hand so I don't have to use the pre-packaged stuff.  You can adjust the amount of crushed red pepper if you prefer more or less heat.  The only item I didn't have on hand was the dried, minced garlic and I'm glad I decided to pick up a bottle in the store before making this!

Hubby had poker tonight and I used this mix as the seasoning for Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili.  I got "thumbs up" and "it's a keeper" all around.  A bit spicy for me, but the men loved it.

I normally use Carrol Shelby's Chili Spice Mix, but tried this on a whim... And I have to say this is leaps and bounds better than Shelby's or any other pre-packaged chili mix I've ever tasted. You'll surely be the hit of the party with this recipe. The subtlety and nuanced spices are hot on the tongue and will warm you on a crisp winter evening. It may be a little too hot for summer, but if you are a five-alarm kinda taster, you'll definitely want this recipe in your cabinet during any season. Note: add one pound of ground beef, a can if tomoato sauce, and a can of dice, stewed tomatoes with jalapenos for the ultimate pot o'the good stuff. It'll serve about eight--or two for leftovers to take to work. It's not a hell-fire chili, but it will stand up to anything premixed and leave the competition wanting. Bon apetit.

This is the best chili seasoning.  I've always used store bought and it always seemed like there was too much salt in it.  This recipe thickened up the chili and hubby loved it.  Thank you for helping to make hubby's taste buds happy:)

Made exactly as written and it was perfect. Used 3 T. for 1 lb. meat, 1 can tomatoes, 1 can beans and 1 small can tomato sauce. A bit spicy so I will try 2 T. next time. Taste is great - just adjust to your liking.

This is very good. I have to double it when making chili for my family - I have to make a lot! I think I use a little more chili powder - 2 Tablespoons, other than that I don't change a thing!

Awesome! Used this in a chili recipe from this site & it was so good! Did not taste 'floury' to me/us. Double  so I could have some on hand premade. Next time will decrease red pepper, so that the people with senistive tongues can enjoy it too!

I should reviewed this years ago as I have been using this every since I found the recipe. It is perfect the way it is. I just have to cut back on the red pepper flakes if I want my 3 and 4 year old to eat it.

Best chili ever! Added to my usual mix of ingredients (ground turkey, crushed tomatoes, and 3 types of beans), this seasoning had my family raving about the "new chili" I made.

I made this recipe tweaking it from one review which said to double the cumin and cut down the crushed red pepper.  My husband said it needed salt, but it was fantastic.  I used fresh basil as well.

This is a very good chili.  What I like the most about it is how incredibly easy it is to make.  I've tried other chilis that have way more ingredients and prep work that didn't compare to this.  This is a keeper!

I used to buy the ready-made chili packets, but no more!  This is the best!  I didn't have crushed red pepper so I omitted it, but it still came out great!  I also don't include the flour in the recipe.  Still not sure how much seasoning to use with each batch of chili, but it's nothing that can't be "tweaked" will simmering!  Yummy!

This is very good! Made just as the recipe calls for minus the flour. The best part is not all the salt and chemicals as in the store season packets. Made a bunch and put it in Tupperware to have on hand. Thanks for sharing this. Great kick and very yummy!

This is a delicious mix! No more need to buy Carroll Shelby's or Ro-Tel Chili Fixin's! Like others, I omitted the flour; upped the chili powder (a blend of chipotle, ancho, and plain old) to 2 Tbsp.; and substituted dried Mexican oregano for the dried basil.    I cooked up some onions and garlic with my ground beef, and then added some unsweetened cocoa powder. Delicious!

My husband LOVED this seasoning and said from now on we should make this rather than buy the prepackaged stuff.    The only change we made is we added two cloves of fresh garlic to our chili since we didn't have any dried minced garlic which we omitted from the seasoning mix.

I needed a couple of tablespoons of chili mix for a recipe and found this recipe. I had everything on hand (except minced dried garlic, so I used garlic powder) and it made plenty for my needs today plus some for another time too. That will be a timesaver having it on hand. It sounded like a lot of crushed red pepper, but the recipe turned out great and wasn't too hot or spicy. So, this served the purpose and saved me a trip to the store plus a couple of dollars too. Now that I know how to make my own chili seasoning, I won't have to even buy the packets anymore. Thanks!

Instead of regular flour, use Masa Harina flour.  It is corn based and a great thickener for chili.  I've been using it for years with great results.

Best seasoning mix for chili out there. Better than anything pre-packaged. I agree, you might want to take it easy with the flour because it can over power the flavor of the mix. I used 1/8 cup instead on 1/4 and it turned out fine. Other that that, this recipe is perfect as is. We make chili a lot here, so I'll be making several batches of this and packaging it up into little baggies. Thanks for sharing with us.

Excellent stuff!!  Didn't have dried garlic so I just added fresh to the chili I was making from this website call Debdoozie's blue ribbon chili by Deb.  Excellent seasoning, won't ever buy from store again.  Thanks

After reading the reviews, I made a few adjustments (doesn't everyone?). I cut the flour back to 2 tbsp, although I don't think the full 1/4 of a cup would have made a big difference. I also didn't have dried minced garlic. I substituted 1 tsp garlic powder and 4 garlic cloves, minced. I was also a little confused as to if this made enough to equal multiple packets or just one, but when I mixed it all up it looked about the same as 1 packet that you would buy in the store. I put it all in my normal recipe instead or the store bought packet. It wasn't EXACTLY the same, just a little different. It was actually slightly better!

Good mix.  Just too salty.  Would omit salt next time and season to taste once chili is made.

I'm a convert! Will never buy packaged seasoning again! This was fantastic. I used 2 Tbs. of the spice blend per 1.5 lbs. of ground turkey. It was perfect. Also - as others suggested - I did not include flour; it's not needed. Thanks so much for posting. This is my new "go-to" chili spice blend!

I prefer the homemade seasoning packets to the packaged store bought ones in an attempt to cut back on preservatives / sodium.  Besides, I prefer knowing what goes into my food!  This is a great basic mix but a little too spicy for our tastes.  We modified by cutting crushed red pepper, onion and garlic in half.  Used onion and garlic powder in place of dried because that's what I had on hand.  Love the fact that it makes up enough for quite a few meals.  Works great with Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili from allrecipes!

Omg amazing.  Found that i had all my chili fixings with a craving for chili cheese nachos. But no little store bought packet.  Omit the flour, substitute crushed red peppers for half a teaspoon of Cayenne, and use a tablespoon of the mix per lb of ground meat (turkey, beef, deer). As for 10 min chili. .. One can of Pinto beans and two small cans of tomato sauce, one lb of meat and two table spoons of this mix. I'll never buy store bought again.

We tried this last night, at first I didn't notice the spicey/hot. Then it hit me WOW! Next time I might reduce the spice a little bit. I only added one tablespoon of flour. 
Per 2.5 pounds of hamburger we added 5 TBLS. of mix. Overall great mix.

I added this mix to canned tomatoes, 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of pinto beans.   It was too spicy and the flavor wasn't pleasant (I reduced flour to 2 TBS).  I was hoping for something similar to the grocery store seasoning packets in flavor and spiciness, this was NOT IT, it was just spicy, but not yummy. I made it as written except the flour which I reduced and I cut back on the red pepper flakes.

This is amazing stuff! I ran out of chili seasoning in the packet that I always buy from the store, and luckily had all the herbs this recipe calls for. I will NEVER use store bought seasoning again, this is a gazillion times better! I love the recipe as is, but for my husband who is not a "spicy hot" lover, I decreased the hot chili flake to 1/2 tsp and it came out perfect. I tried both with and without the flour, but the added flour just gives it a little something extra and brings it over the top! Awesome recipe, is now the only one I use for chili!!!!

This was just perfect for my beef chili and I will use this instead of the packet of chili seasoning from now on!  I did not use the flour, as my chili was already thick enough.  I did add a TBSP of cocoa powder to add some richness.  This chili was some of the best I have made

Love this recipe. I scale it up to make several servings. Bottle it to make it easier when I make chili.

If you leave the flour out, you use 2 tbsp. per pound of meat.

I always buy the package seasoning.  Ease and quality are why.
  So when I came across this recipe I gave it a try!  OMG what a mistake to be buying the packages when I can use this!
  Used 3/4 of it for a batch of chili in a crock pot, 3 qt.  Loved it!

This recipe really rocks (without the flour).  I halved the recipe, used 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper and zero added salt.  The house smelled "so good" while this was cooking my hubby came running upstairs and asked what I was making.  Since I halved the recipe, I used it all in the "Chili-ghetti" recipe from this site.  Great meal.

Wonderful, better than store bought.  I forgot to add the flour and it was completely fine without it.  I won't buy chili seasoning at the store ever again!  I did add 2 more tbsp. of chili powder, just personal preference.

Very good, better than a store bought mix.  I used about half as much flour and it still came out nice and thick.   Kids thought it a bit spicy, but I used hot beans with it.  Will use plain beans to appease them next time.

This is the only chili seasoning I use anymore. And my chili kicks butt (in my humble opinion - I mean, I like it...). I do add a tablespoon or two of unsweetened cocoa for some added depth to the chili. This is my secret ingredient, and it makes it for me!

Worked super.  I have typically relied upon a can of chili beans (the horror!) and found myself without said can, but needing to make chili.  Had almost all ingredients on hand (no parsley), and it is fabulous.  Chili is still on the stove and will never, ever again use something bought from the store.  May cut the flour next time, but it doesn't overpower the seasonings at all.

Loved it! I won't ever use a store bought mix again...omitted the flour and for the chili powder I used 1/2 ancho chili powder and 1/2 chipotle. The chili that I added this into ROCKED. (Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili from this site)

This mix is super. I used the entire mix with 1# of ground turkey (I can't eat red meat), a 29oz can of tomato puree, a 10oz can of kidney beans, about 1/2 of a can of beer, and enough water to get it to my preferred consistency (not too runny or solid). I browned the meat and then dumped everything else in and let is simmer for 20-30 minutes--delicious!! I served this with the Buttery Corn Bread recipe from this site and my kids and husband loved both!

Really good!  I did use 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes and used Mexican oregano instead of basil.  Also used an equal amount of cumin to chili powder because we love the taste of cumin.  With these substitution I used 1/4 cup of seasoning as I would one packet of seasoning mix.  It's really good!!  Just enough heat to suit us.  Will no longer buy the packet stuff!

As others did, I omitted the flour and as always cut out the salt. This was easy to scale down--for one large pot of chili I scaled it down to 1 serving. It was roughly the same amount of mix as you would get in a premade packet. Wasn't overly spicy but gave my chili a nice kick. My boyfriend noticed the difference and thought this was the best chili I've made. Will definitely be using this from now on, thank you!!!

This has a great taste, but a bit too hot to give the little kids.  My two year old took one bite and washed it down with a full cup of water.  My husband would give it 5 stars because he loves hot and spicy.  I like the blend of spices, but when I make it I adjust the following:  use 1 TBSP flour, 1/2 tsp salt, and half all the other ingredients (except the black pepper).  I also use onion and garlic powder instead of minced.  Enough to make one batch of chili in my 4 quart crockpot.

I use this all the time now.  If you don't like your chili with kick go easy on the red pepper.  I have small children that don't always like spicy so I half the amount of red pepper (1 1/2 tsp).  Thanks Sara for a great recipe.

All I can say is that I will never buy another package of Chili seasoning AGAIN! This was awesome and so convenient to have on hand. I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings and that is perfect for one batch of chili for us. That is using a pound of ground beef, 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and a 14oz can of tomato sauce and kidney beans. I also make Basic Corn Muffins recipe from this site with this.

This seasoning with Deb Doozies recipe and you'll never make chili any other way again!  I use 99% fat free ground turkey and my family loves it! This is a regular low cal/low fat fall/winter meal for us.

I usually use McCormick chili seasoning, but didn’t have any, so I tried this mix. It was a big let down. I don’t know what was missing, but this seasoning didn’t have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for. The chili was not gross, just blah.

I skipped the flour and took the pepper flakes down to 1 teaspoon. The rest of the seasonings are spot on.  I would add that next time I'll make a batch without the red pepper flakes since I'm feeding my toddler.  Thanks for the recipe!

Smells delicious cooking.  I added a little more chili powder and cumin.  I used a little less than 1/4 cup cornstarch instead of the flour to make it gluten free.  Much better than store bought , no chemicals.

This mix is much better than the pre-packaged! I like the flour in it as it adds a perfect thickness to the chili. You have to treat the mix like the pre-packaged when preparing. Sprinkle it over the meat and combine. Add a little water if you need to and create a "paste" of sorts on the meat. Then I put that mixture into my beans and diced tomatoes and it was perfect! I cooked my meat (turkey in my case) with some onion and green pepper for added flavor. I also sprinkled in more cumin and chili powder into the chili just because I like more robust flavor. I omitted the red pepper flakes since I was cooking this for my kids. 
All in all, best mix I've found thus far for chili.

I made this except I cut the red pepper back to 1 tsp.  It was still to hot for my wife (as expected).  The flour also made it too thick for my wife,, but I liked it.   The takeaway is if you like it thick and spicy, use as written.   Otherwise adjust flour and red peeper to taste.  This is now my standard chili seasoning.

I have made this several times and the only adjustment that I make to it is either using no flour or putting in half to less than half depending on how I feel. The reason for lessening  the flour is because it changes the taste of the seasonings. I love to taste of the seasoning themselves.

I didn't add flour , as I've never added a thickener to my chili. I didn't add cumin, because I hate it. That being said, this made some of the best chili I've ever tasted. It will definitely be what I use for now on.

I used 2 teaspoons of chili powder instead of 4 teaspoons because I'm quite a wimp when it comes to spice - other than that, this mix tasted really delicious. I've previously used the store bought packets, which I've never enjoyed that much and I can honestly say, I will never buy them again! This mix was far tastier! xxx

Too much crushed red pepper. It only needs 1/4 tsp. Also WAY too much salt. Omit the salt entirely from the recipe and salt to taste.

I love having these easy mixes in my spice pantry all ready to use. I made this per the recipe except I used only 2 T. flour. My chili recipe: 1 lb ground beef, browned; 1 can diced tomatoes; 1 can fire roasted diced tomatoes; 1 can tomato sauce with basil, oregano, and garlic; 1 can kidney beans, drained; 3 T chili seasoning mix.

Excellent chili seasoning!! I will never buy a premix again!! I've made this numerous times. I make a big batch and store it in an old baby food jar for quick access. After many times making the seasoning as written, I've found that by decreasing the flour to 2 Tbsp and adding 1 Tbsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne and changing the white sugar to 1 Tbsp + 1tsp brown sugar enhances this seasoning recipe! {For the chili I use 1/2 pound ground beef, 1 small onion (diced), 2 garlic cloves (minced), 1 pepper (diced), 1 tomato (seeded/diced), 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce and 3 Tbsp of seasoning. }

Terrific basic chili recipe and a great starter. I used fresh onions instead of onion powder, ditched the sugar and flour and added two diced habaneros (careful with those!)

Made it for dinner just recently, it was a big hit with everyone!!!! Definitely. Saving this one in my files!  I wasn't so sure about the flour, but as I used some beef broth for liquid, the flour helped thicken it up nicely, just a little bit, not to much, but perfectly!!!!! Awesome!!!!
Update: I have made this so many times since coming across this recipe! We love it!!! No more store bought mixes for us! 
I use one of the empty spice containers and mix up this one and have it on hand all the time now! So easy and much healthier!!!! Try it, you won't be disappointed!!!

Had no cumin last night so it lacked depth but was super tasty - I made it into a paste before adding it to the meat with the juice of from a tin of tomatoes - I like the idea of making this x 3 and storing it in a pint jar.

Thank you.  This is an easy to make and flavorful mix.  I'll never pay $2+ again for a few teaspoons of seasonings.  I cook and bake gluten free so I experiment a lot.  Because of that, I bought a one pound bucket of maltodextrin (it's inexpensive, very light and fluffy and as such, comes in a container bigger than a one gallon paint can).  I'ts just highly refined tapioca starch that completely dissolves in water without adding any taste or texture.  I substituted that for the flour.  I suppose you could also use tapioca starch as a medium or actually use nothing.  It's really not necessary at all.  It's a seasoning mix.

I added some other ideas to my blend from reviewers because his is one of those very "customizable" recipes.  Thanks again for sharing this idea.

Used this recipe and I thought my chili came out wonderful so this will be my new "go to".  Recipe is perfect quantity to make....used 4 tablespoonfuls in my chili and the rest was enough to fill a standard spice jar.

I love this seasoning combo. You can adjust for your preference whether it's spicy or not. It makes delicious chili! I sauté onions with the ground beef, add a few cans of beans and voila!

Loved this seasoning mix. I omitted the flour, because I like a brothier chili. This is the perfect amount of seasoning for a batch of chili using 1 lb of ground beef, 2 15 oz cans of diced tomatoes, 2 cans of chili beans and another can of kidney or butter beans. It definitely has a kick to it, so some may want to cut back on the red pepper. Or add cayenne if you want even more heat! It may be a little on the salty side, so you could probably omit or reduce the added salt and just season to taste.

I have NEVER tried to make chili without store bought seasoning mix but I was feeling frisky tonight. This is a good blend of spices to which you can add your own personal touches. I didn't have enough chili powder but I did have some dried Ancho chiles that I pan roasted and then reconsituted with a little water before adding to my crockpot. Gosh, was that awesome! If you can find those, use em! They add such a nice, smoky flavor and they're mild too. Other than that change, (work with what ya got), I made the recipe as written.  Tomato sauce, ground round, a little added water and NO FLOUR! If you need to thicken, use cornstarch or as another reviewer mentioned, use some refried beans. It was awesome! Sorry for the super long review. :o)

Good.  Love the ability to avoid prepackaged foods but still have convenience.  Took other reviewer suggestions to hold on the flour and go easy on the salt in the mix, but added them to taste as the chili cooked.  Used half the mix in my first batch (1lb ground beef, 4 cans drained beans, 4 fresh tomatoes and 1/2 yellow onion chopped in the blender) and it was on the sweet side, which was good.  Made 2nd batch the same way but was in the mood for a more savory taste and added 1t cocoa powder to counteract the sweet.  This was also good.  Will continue to use this recipe. Thank you for submitting!

This is a great, easy recipe that is SO much better than store bought (no MSG)!
You can skip the flour and either smush some of your beans to help thicken or you can add masa flour instead of white flour for a more authentic taste.

Made this quickly in a pinch MINUS the flour and it was delicious in my chili.  I only used two full tablespoons of it in my chili and it just was soooo good--perfect combination of spices minus the flour.  I was not making gravy so I left out four and never missed it.   The rest was superb.  Will NEVER buy packaged chili seasoning again!!!!  GREAT recipe.

Excellent start. Here is what I changed. I omitted the flour and sugar (didn't need it thicker as I use angel hair pasta noodles in mine). I only used 3 teaspoons of chili powder, doubled the dried onion to 2 tablespoons and instead of using fresh garlic and salt I put in 3 teaspoons of garlic salt. LOVED this mix.

This is a very good start for those that don't want that bold chili taste. This mix did not have enough chili powder for my taste. Instead of 4 teaspoons you should start out with 4 Tablespoons of chili powder. I also added 1 teaspoon of paprika. I also only used 2 Tablespoons of flour. When browning my 2.5 lbs ground beef I put about a tablespoon of chili powder in. Drain the grease then put about 3 to 4 tablespoons of the mix in with the ground beef to coat the meat as if you were making gravy. Add 1 large can of tomato juice, 4 cans 14.5 oz ea. of diced tomatoes. 70 oz's of undrained kidney beans, 1 large diced yellow onion, 1 diced green pepper, 1 diced red pepper, 2 stalks of diced celery. Cook until veggies are tender. Add straight chili powder to taste and you have hit a homerun. As I said, this is a very good base. just not enough chili powder for my taste.

I've used this for chili a few times. It has great flavor, but is surprisingly mild. For a spicier chili, add more chili powder and crushed red pepper. It lends a good flavor without the heat, so even my kids like chili when I use this seasoning.

I started making chili without realizing that I was out of the chili packets of seasoning you buy at the store. So I found this recipe and was very pleased with the results! I don't think I'll go back to overpaying for the packets anymore! I didn't have the dried onion and I cut back the red pepper so it wouldn't be too spicy for my kids. It was still very good!

Thought it was a very good seasoning mix. I admit that I did make one slight change (Iusually don't the first time I try a recipe). I took the advise from some reviewers and cut back on the flour, I used 2 tablespoons. The reason I used less floue is that I didn't want my chili thicken to much. I made enough to fill a large spice jar. That way I'll have it on hand when I make chili again and it won't be long. Thanks Sal.

I was making chili for a dinner that included our granddaughters (3 and 5) so left out the crushed red chili peppers as they don't like spicy. I was very surprised by how tasty the chili was without any heat at all. Very good recipe - no need to buy chili mix pre-packaged again.  I would add the crushed chili peppers if I was just making for us but if taking to a pot-luck would leave them out and let people add there own according to their own taste!  Thanks

I doubled everything except the flour. Had to use onion and garlic powders as substitutes so I didn't double. I did not quite double the salt either.  I used approx. 2 lbs ground turkey, 2 cans diced tomatoes, 2 cans tomato sauce, 2 cans pinto beans, I can kidney beans, then diluted with about 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup water. Slow cooker on low. UPDATE:  again doubled all but flour AND salt (1.5).  about 1/2 cup per single batch of chili.

I looked up this recipe because I am new to gluten free cooking (GF) and the chili seasonings in my local store all had wheat flour in them. Because I made this on the fly I did not have all of the ingredients on hand so I substituted a few. I used 2 T GF all purpose flour (King Arthurs). Since I did not have dried onion or garlic on hand, I used 1 tsp each of onion and garlic powder. I ran out of cumin so I only used 1 tsp of that. The chili came out great. I will make my own from now on. Thanks for the recipe.

Good, but I thought something was missing. Maybe it needs more chili powder. I left out the flour as others and used cornmeal as the thickener.

Awesome flavour.  I use this seasoning every time I make chili now and the family loves it.  I use the copy cat Wendy's chili recipe and make the Italian Bread Bowls from this site.  So good.
I skip the flour because I don't usually need to thicken my chili and I sub smoked paprika for the cumin since my partner has a senstivity.

I'll never buy packaged again.  I omitted the flour preferring to just cook my chili down over a long period of time to thicken.  I did double the chili powder and cumin but left everyting else alone.  I/we eat a lot of chili so I make this in big batches.  I keep this in a container by the stove ready for use.

I thought this was an excellent chili seasoning in comparison to store bought.  I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be way too salty.  I had to add extra salsa, sugar, tomato sauce, and a raw potato to counter act the saltiness.  With that being said, I will omit the salt and add to taste.  The spice had excellent flavor and my husband said that it was the best chili I have made in about ten years!

This was ok but way too spicy. I ended up using the entire thing and still had to put more chili powder and cumin in (i use two lbs of meat). I usually use hot italian sausage and love spicy food, but the 1tbsp of red pepper flakes was way too much. The flour made it unnecessary to use tomato paste. I will try it again, with modifications next time.

What a fantastic base! I omitted the flour as well, and reduced the chili powder to 2tsps (from 4) for a milder chili. It was perfect! I also reduced the salt because I have a sea salt grinder.

Good but just a bit spicy for my own personal taste but I'm sure that leaving out the red pepper or at least reducing it a little will remedy that. Otherwise I think it's a good recipe.

Loved this recipe. Of course I had to make some changes.  As some suggested, I used 2 Tbsp of flour. I used chili flakes instead of red pepper flakes and omitted minced onion because I used real onion cooked with the hamburger.

This is a pretty good place to start from with your chili seasoning.  It's very mild and worked well.  I did make a change or 2 however.  I didn't add any flour at all.  I decided I would add it after the fact if needed, but our chili didn't need any thickening at all.  We like ours a little more on the "hot" side so I did add a bit more of the chili powder, pepper flakes and tossed in some paprika for good measure.  This recipe is a great jumping off point.

I was needing a chili spice mix for a chili recipe on this site that called for store-bought seasoning and this worked great.  I cut back on the red (cayenne) pepper a little (maybe a teaspoon less) and increased the chili powder a little.  Just the right amount of kick!

I tripled this recipe and still just added the 1/4 flour and it turns out just fine. Great recipe.

Where we live there's no such thing as pre-packaged chili seasoning. Finding this recipe was awesome! We were able to finally make and eat chili! :) It was  super easy to mix from scratch with spices you have around the house. I cut the flour down to 2 tablespoons and used one teaspoon cayenne pepper because I can't find the flakes where we live. The chili we made last week came out perfect, even for my youngest son, who does not like spicy food. If I would ever want to make it spicier, I'd just add more cayenne. Thank you for a great recipe!

Thanks for getting me outta a pinch!  I had everything going for my chili and went to add in my seasoning packets and didn't have any.  This is what I'm using from now on...it was perfect!  I did add a bit more chili powder, but that only  because of MY tastes!  Thanks!!

Delicious.  It's the cumin that really makes it.  I'm with the rest of the reviewers on flour.  to thicken, I usually put the kidney beans in the pot first, then squash them with a stick blender and potato masher.  The dried spices in this mix do very well in the crock pot all day.  Fresh jalapenos add the perfect kick!

Would be 5 stars, except for I modified: I downsized recipe to 1 serving, which made 3-4 generous servings once converted into actual chili. (I'm assuming the recipe was for # of packages, not # of servings.) I added a 40.5 oz can of kidney beans, a lb. of hamburg, 1 sweet red pepper (needed to use before it spoiled). I also added 1 small white onion and about 2 tsp (maybe more) of minced jarred garlic (both cooked) to the mix. For liquid, I added V8 as needed (plus a little flour because I added a touch too much V8). I can't tell you how much I LOVED this chili. I could eat it all night...

Delicious!  I'll never buy that packaged stuff again.  I only used 2T flour and increased the chili powder to 1T.  Oh, and I didn't have minced dried garlic, so I used a teaspoon of garlic powder.  No idea if that's equivilant, but it tasted good!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really good! I didn't have a Chili seasoning packet for a coney sauce recipe (Semi-Homemade recipe) and fortunately found this recipe. I cut the recipe in half and added half as much flour as it called for and it tasted delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

Yow!! This stuff it H-O-T!!  It has a good flavor, but use it sparingly.  I made the mistake of thinking I could use it interchangeably with the pre-packaged chili seasoning mix, and my chili turned out way too hot.

my husband is the chili maker in the house and when I told him to put away his store bought mix he growled but gave this a try and he said he will never go back to store bought I must admit though it is too spicy for kids so tame it some for them, and my kids like spicy stuff but this was too much spice and we even tamed it some but will have to do more taming next time

This is very good. I took other reviewer's recommendations and cut back the flour to 2 Tbsp, 1 tsp salt and used 3/4 tsp garlic powder in place on dried minced garlic because that is what I had on hand. Everything else I kept the same. I did not reduce the red pepper flakes because mine were a little old and had lost some of the heat. My chili came out medium hot, so if you like a more mild chili cut back on the red pepper flakes. I used 2 Tbsp mix added to 1 lb of browned ground beef,1 can each tomato soup, tomato sauce, red kidney beans and 1 cup of water. I will use this recipe again.

This was good enough to rate 5 stars, but... I'd agree it is on the spicy side.  My 3 year old complained even when I'd toned it down, so keep that in mind when you mix it up.  Also, it would be nice to have something stated about how much to use per pound of meat --although one rater did give some estimates, I wonder what the original writer had in mind.  But all in all, it's definitely a keeper for my files!

Better than a store bought chili mix! I did leave out the flour, but left all other ingredients as is and doubled it! Instead of flour as a thickener, I like to use refried beans. Better for you and no one can tell!

I always knew my husband loved chili, but neither of us knew how much until I tried this recipe.  He's still raving about how good it was 3 days later and asking me when I'm making more.  

I've decided I'm going to make up batches of the mix to include in my Christmas packages this year, along with a bunch of other goodies I'm making.

Really enjoyed this. Never made my own chili spice before and will use this from now on. It was a little 'hot' for our tastes.. with so much red pepper so i halved the red pepper and it still was almost too spicy .. so I will go even a little less on the pepper next time. Also did not add the flour. Thanks for a great recipe!

I omitted the flour because I didn't need it.  This is a nice chili mild flavor.  I used more chili powder and ground cayenne powder to hotten it up.

I made this recipe once and lost it. I’m making it again today with no flour or sugar and putting it with 2 pounds of meat. I’m adding chopped jalapeño with only a few seeds and instead of garlic powder I am adding a teaspoon of roasted garlic better than bouillon. this is the base for my chili omelette with cheddar and sour cream.

It’s nice. When making this mix, I use masa flour instead of white flour. I also add a dash of smoked paprika, cayenne red pepper and more pepper. Sometimes I add a dash of cinnamon and cocoa powder (Cincinnati style).

I prefer this to store bought because I know the quality of the seasonings I put in this and I know there are no additional additives that I don't want.
The seasonings are great for our normal pot of chili which is 2 pounds of ground meat (I use a mixture of venison and beef), 2 cans of chili beans and one quart of homemade stewed tomatoes. 
To make sure the flour doesn't overpower the chili I sprinkle it over the ground meat while it's cooking so it forms a roue. Then the seasonings are added. When the meat is mixed with the beans and tomatoes, it thickens nicely without a raw flour taste.
I only gave it four stars because it was missing my favorite seasoning for chili - chipotle peppers, which give it the kick of the red pepper flake plus a smokey flavor.

Made exactly as is.  Terrible.  The chili tasted like super thick tomato sauce.  I  re-worked it and dropped the flour entirely, doubled the chili powder,  doubled the cumin, added 2 tsp no-salt seasoning mix from Costco and that made it much better.  Still not perfect but at least a decent substitute for the store-bought mix.   I gave it 2 stars because the bones were there to start working from- but if you like flavor in your chili be prepared to doctor it extensively the first time you make it.

Great as written. Suggestions: 
1) For Gluten free: Substitute 2 TB Corn Starch for the flour. 
2) Try half the chili flakes and add to taste. 
This made a "double batch" of chili:
Simmer the following on low for 15 minutes
2 lbs hamburger browned and drained
1 can dark kidney beans 15 oz
28oz chopped tomatoes
1 chili seasoning mix listed above
2 tb water

I liked the flavor of it in my Chili very much but do to personal taste did not add as much crushed red pepper or salt as called for. Also I absolutely would not at the flour at all, thus 4 stars.

So easy and tastes really good. I used it in one of the chili recipes I got off this site. Just used 1 less teaspoon of crushed red peppers as I like my chili very mild. Otherwise followed directions exactly.

I have been using this for years and it is much better than the "name brand" chili seasoning mix. 7 Tablespoons is the equivalent of one packet of seasoning mix, in case you are unsure of how much to use.

I give it 5 stars but did make some small changes. Left out flour as I dont like thick chili. Did not add onion as I had put a whole onion in with the meat however I did not have any parsley so I substituted chives. I also used Kosher Salt.

It turned out great. I cut the flour back to 1 TBS and added during the last 10 mins of cooking.  You can use 1-2 TBS of flour depending on how thick you like your chili.  I also added a can of beans and diced tomatoes.  I have three boys and they all loved it.

I made this without onion and garlic since I am Intolerant. Has a decent amount of bite to it but is very flavorful. Husband and I both find it better than the prepackaged seasoning I was buying (which I stopped buying because it made me sick)

Great recipe to be used in a variety of dishes. I use this to make another favorite, "Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili." My husband can't tolerate a lot of heat, so I used about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper instead of 1 tablespoon. I always keep a supply on hand.

You know these recipes are made the way they like it. You have to tweak to your taste. They may like to thicken with flour. Make it your own!  I will try. I think I will try the refried bean in place of flour, my choice.

Excellent alternative to packaged chili seasoning.  Several reviewers suggested omitting the flour, but I like my chili thick, so I kept the flour and doubled the chili powder.  The chili I made with it had perfect flavor and consistency.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe for knowing what goes in your seasoning. I actually made this without the flour and sugar, and it is perfect. I use chili beans from a can, tomato soup, beef, onion, stewed tomatoes - added this seasoning mix cooked in a slow cooker for about 6 hours. Mine turned out perfect!.

My husband and I love this recipe! We use it every time we wanted chili for dinner. It has a nice balance of sweet, heat, and flavor.

Loved it!! Did not add the flour as I make a thick chili to begin with and dreaded it being thicker.

I followed the other suggestions and added more chili powder and cumin.  I used WAY less red pepper and flour.   I made Debdoozie's chili on this site and started with a couple of tablespoons of the seasoning.  I added more to taste.  I also added more chili powder, cumin and red pepper.  My chili turned out really good!

This chili mix is really good, however like another cook, I too was curious how much to add as I make chili with a variety of beans (dry/soaked) and typically a pound of beef, onions, tomatoes, peppers. I think I added approx 2 1/2 Tablespoons of the mixture to my batch and placed the remaining mix in a jar for a future use.

This mix is award winning, with the following modifications
NO FLOUR! (yuck)
Half the cumin
Half the salt - add more during cooking if needed
No sugar (I use one of the following to replace the sugar, depending on what's in my kitchen: a jar of Newman's Own peach salsa, grape jelly, maple syrup, or local honey - don't know the amounts, just season to personal taste). 

I use this mix with 1.5-2lbs of beef, 1 regular size can each of black beans and dark red kidney beans - drained but not rinsed, a large can of diced tomatoes, undrained, large can of tomato sauce, and jar of peach salsa (if available, if not, I cut acidity with grape jelly, honey, or maple syrup, to taste)

This chili always gets me rave reviews!

I'm never buying a packet again!! I would cut back on the red pepper flakes next time or add to taste as it cooks. I'm also considering using a little chipotle seasoning next time. Nice compliment to the homesteader cornbread recipe.

7.22.17  I think this is one of those recipes that you need to tweak to your particular tastes.  Doesn't need a whole lot of adjustment, but for us, I used 1 Tbsp flour,  1 tsp sugar,  and 2 Tbsp chili powder which suited us fine, otherwise, followed the recipe.  I used this today for Just Like Wendy's® Chili (on this site) which calls for two 1.25 oz pkgs of chili seasoning.  After mixing together all of this recipe's ingredients, I weighed it, it was pretty close to 2.5 oz, so I put it all into today's big pot of chili (which by the way turned out GREAT!).  No need to buy expensive pkgs of chili seasoning, this mix is fine, and all of the ingredients are always in my pantry.

This is my go-to chili seasoning. Never buying a packaged mix again. My whole family loves this including my picky 6 and 4 year olds. My 6-year-old tells me I make the best chili ever. We love eating this with Tostitos scoops.

It took a lot more than I would have expected to use per pound of chili. That's the only reason for the 4 stars. Otherwise it was great!

We made this last minute when we realized we were out of store-bought seasoning packets. It was very tasty and we will use it in the future. We made a few minor adjustments. We used slightly less than 1/4 c. flour since some other reviewers felt there was too much and left out the parsley since we didn't have any in the house. We added 1/4 tsp. of extra chili powder and 1/4 tsp. cayenne. We added 3.5 Tablespoons of the mix to 1.25 lbs. browned ground turkey along with 1 can kidney beans, 1 can chili beans and 1 can of diced tomatoes. Cooked for approx. 10 minutes and it was ready to go.

This. Is. DELICIOUS. I made it according to the recipe and doubled everything. The only thing different I did is I didn't have minced garlic and onion on hand so I used powdered but I highly doubt that makes a difference, though. I DID include the flour and there's no hint that it's part of the mix. I 100% recommend this mix recipe and will continue to use it instead of the prepackaged mixes. It mixes in beautifully and the flavors are just so so good. Thank you for posting this!

Used this as inspiration for chili seasoning with these changes: No flour, used part of a corn tortilla instead to thicken chili
Will reduce cumin to 1.5 tsp next time..2tsp too strong, I used only 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of 1 Tbsp pepper flakes, no basil, used half each Mex. Oregano and Corriander.  I also left out the onion and garlic because I use fresh in my chili.
Made 2 qts chili and used about 2Tbsps of mixture.  This is the best combo of flavors I've tasted for seasoning chili!

This is the only chili seasoning I use!  It's delicious, and I've never felt the need to add flour. I do add a little more chili powder and sometimes I'll toss in a dash of smoked paprika to shake things up, but it's delish as-is. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Not a bad recipe and certainly better than a pre packaged mix. I   went against my better judgement and used the two tsps of salt. I recommend reducing the salt at least in half. I also added a teaspoon of paprika.

I left out the flour because I didn't have any, but I went ahead and quadrupled the recipe and put it in a jar.   Never buying the pre-made stuff again!

I increased the number of servings to 37 to give enough to make a large container I can grab on a regular basis. I omitted the flour and sugar and used fresh garlic (because I didn't have and couldn't find the dehydrated minced garlic). It made for a very flavorful chili, even with ground turkey instead of ground beef. I used canned beans (without draining) and it made the chili thick enough that the flour is not needed. And leftovers the next day were great poured over tortilla chips to make nachos.

Next time, I will use less salt. It is a little more salty than I would like but that is not unusual for me with most recipes, anyway.

I was looking for the correct ratios of spices to get a good balance ... after experimenting a little and failing I came across this one. it's an excellent starting point. I add one large cab of crushed tomatoes one large can of diced tomatoes and one can of dark red kidney beans (rinsed) to a pound and a half of ground beef. I leave out the flour and add a little extra of everything else. I do most of the spices by eye now (no real measuring). I also typically add some paprika (it's good without it though )

Very good seasoning mix. Much better than the store bought packages and you can modify ingredients to suit your taste.

I made as is, except I used gluten free flour blend. I used 4 lbs of beef and my usual chilli recipe. This had a good spicy flavor.

I  love this recipe. I have been using it for years now. Everyone in my house loves their chili thick so I do keep the flour but I like to use corn flour or masa. I do omit the sugar and add 1 teaspoon of oregano because I love the flavor the oregano adds.

This is my go to recipe. I omit the sugar and use coconut flour instead of regular. It really allows the spice to shine through. I always make with ground turkey two cans of beans, a can of  tomato sauce, and a can of diced tomatoes. It is an easy, delicious bowl of comfort food!

I won't change a thing if I don't have to due to not having a certain ingredient  (I'll go out and get the missing one).

Absolutely awesome mix! I only used 1/8 c of flour, but otherwise its perfect. I highly recommend Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili and using this mix in it!

At home, I substitute the red pepper flakes for a quarter teaspoon of cayenne. I also reduce the sugar to about 1/2 teaspoon, max, and leave out the flour.  

Without the flour and with only the sugar reduction, this won me a chili cook -off at work.

I didn't have a packet of chili seasoning for Debdoozies chili on this site, so I made this - and loved it!!  I used the whole recipe for Debdoozies chili recipe btw.   I did make some changes due to kids not liking spice and didn't have dried minced garlic so I used fresh.  Plus, I used a homemade salsa that had onions in it so I decreased the dried onions from this recipe.  Still great no matter!  Thx!!
What I did:
1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1/2 Tbsp minced onion, 1 tsp salt, no sugar, no flour, 2tsp minced garlic
Revised:  made again and with homemade salsa it's a bit spicy for my kids (perfect for me and hubby) but next time I will only add 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes

1.  Didn't see where it said how to use, like tomatoes and meat amount?

2.  We needed gluten free so added small amount of cornstarch to replace flour. 

3.  We did not have parsley in the house so used cilantro instead.

4.  We did not add sugar.  Trying to avoid it for the addicted in the house.  :-) (me)

We used petite canned tomatoes and chunks of browned venison which after 10 hours in the crockpot I was able to used potato masher to shred while still in crockpot.   We are freezing and will add beans and/or noodles, rice or cornbread plus we like to put on scrambled eggs.

I really liked this, however, it was a tad spicy for our household.  I would cut the red pepper in half next time.  It also calls for 1/4 cup flour, I put in one TBSP and I will be upping that to 1/8 cup next time.  All in all, I will use this recipe again, but tweak it a little to fit us!

Way too spicy and not very flavorful. Had to add lots of garlic and salt for the flavor and more beans and tomatoes to cut down the spiciness.

Didn't add flour or black pepper, used the other ingredients the same as recipe calls for. i Used 4 tbsps of this seasoning mix with 1lb turkey meat, 1 can of diced tomatoes (14.5 oz can undrained), 1 can of red kidney beans (15.5 oz can undrained). Top with plain Greek yogurt. Good!!

This was really good. I left out the flour, because I don't like to add any thickener to my chili, I like to just let it cook down. It is pretty spicy, so if you're sensitive to that, you might want to reduce the crushed red pepper a little bit, but we liked it that way.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I NO Longer buy any Chili Seasoning after using this Recipe.  I used to Buy McCormicks Chili Seasoning cause that was my Seasoning of Choice.

After this Recipe I No longer buy any other Seasoning.  Since I like a Little Extra Spice, I add more Pepper Flakes then Normal.

Great Recipe, I'd recommend this to any Chili Lovers out there.

This is an amazing recipe with a lot of flavor.  I omitted the flour but otherwise followed as directed.  I add this seasoning to other dishes to give them a little extra flavor.  For example, I added a half teaspoon to the Herb Crusted Walleye recipe posted on this site.

AMAZING !!  I've been hooked for the past 20 years on a product called "Bowl O' Red".   It's kind of pricey @ $13/lb. 1pound lasts me a couple months as I use this as a rub for smoking meats, for taco meat, Fajita rub, and of course making chili. I love TexMex cooking.
I'm retired now and in an attempt to save some money but still have a good tasting mix, I thought I would give this a try. I made this mix exactly to the recipe and ran it through my blender to powder it. 
I sampled this mix and then compared to the Bowl O' Red.  Very good, and Very close. My tongue said add 1 more Tsp of N.Mexico red chili powder, salt, and sugar.  Now it's almost identical. Looks a little different but tastes great.
I quadrupled the recipe and now I have a big batch. I'm good for the next 2 months.  It saves me 1/2 the price or more of my old favorite.  Thanks again allrecipes !!!!!

As written I don't think I'd like this recipe, but with a few changes it's amazing! I first made this when I started chili without realizing I didn't have any McCormick chili seasoning packets. Now I'll never buy them again!
First, I omitted the flour completely. I use tomato paste in my chili, so it doesn't need thickening. I used 1-2 additional teaspoons chili powder. I cut the crushed red pepper in half, and added a pinch of cayenne pepper. I left out the dried onion and garlic, instead chopping up a large fresh onion and mincing 2-3 large cloves of garlic. I did also use a half tbsp garlic powder, but I love garlic. The rest of the recipe I followed as written. I use an entire batch of this seasoning for one pot of chili and it is fantastic! My whole family loves it, they didn't even realize I had run out of seasoning packets but they did think the chili was better than usual. With some changes to suit your own tastes this is a keeper. 
I really don't recommend that anyone use the flour as called for in this recipe, however. If you need to thicken your chili, try adding a small can of tomato paste, some refried beans, or even a tbsp of corn starch mixed into a little bit of water - any amount of flour is going to overpower the flavor of your chili.

I like this very much. I prefer to make home made mixes, much better than buying the packaged ones with too much sodium.

This recipe makes it so easy to make your own chili seasoning and not rely on store bought.  Perfect!  UPDATE 1/8/16  I continue to use this recipe and I also omit the flour as other reviewers have mentioned (just a personal preference).  I use 2 lbs. Ground Sirloin, browned and drained, 1 can of whole tomatoes broken up with juice, one can Original Rotel tomatoes, 1 8 oz can tomato sauce, two cups of beef broth and 2 cans of dark red kidney beans along with 4 T of this mix.  Always good, but especially on a "chili" night!

Sub out the white sugar for dark brown, and omit the four and use refried beans to thicken as you like it.

Made it without flour, allowed chili to simmer and cook down without the thickener. All in all a decent blend but way to much heat for those that like a milder chili. I didn't like the sweetness the sugar added. And the cumin - a signature chili flavor - was overrun by the red pepper. A few tweaks, good stuff.

Great recipe. I add 1tsp of the following: hot oriental mustard, orange habanero powder and smokehouse maple seasoning. Sometimes I cut the flour in half so I can use the mix for other foods I want to spice up. I try to keep a ziplock of this always ready.

I will no longer use plain old chili powder and garlic powder.  This was really good!  I cut the recipe in half for one batch of chili, decreased the salt a bit and eliminated the flour and sugar.

I had a package of chili mix on hand and decided to blend it with most of the ingredients listed here with the exception of the sugar just to use it up so that it wouldn't get used to make a pot of chili by itself. It's very simple to make and easy I store the remainder in a  recycled glass jar. I added Paprika, Lemon pepper seasoning salt, garlic salt and buttermilk cornmeal instead of flour. This picture is the seasoning that I added to my crockpot before stirring it into the pre-cooked beef and bacon, Pinto and red beans, tomato sauce with green chiles and tomato juice to thin it.

Made for first time tonight and WILL NOT be the last. Great recipe. 2tbs per 1lb meat and what ever else you add is plenty of seasoning. For a lil twist, add ranch style beans, which ever flavor you like, adds a nice kick. I added 1tsp of chipotle pepper powder. Its a lil warm but awesome.

This seasoning smells fantastic. After putting the chili together, and while it's cooking it smells great. I followed the recipe as it is, but followed the advice of CookingMama and added extra chili powder and I omitted the flour. I have thrown it into the slow cooker for this evening's dinner. Can't wait!

After eating the chili it has a bit of heat to it so be prepared for a kick in the mouth! This stuff was fantastic thanks for sharing.

This makes a fabulous chili. For me, I used half of it (about 3 tablespoons) with a pound and a quarter of ground beef, 1 1/2 cups water, and one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. I omitted the red pepper flakes because I used a medium hot chili powder, and instead of the salt, I used 2 cubes of beef bullion. I'll be making this again for sure!

This is the best chili seasoning ever! I only add 2 TBS of the flour and it turns out wonderfully. My family likes the spice so we add extra crushed red pepper.  :)  I purposely don't buy the packet junk anymore & make my own! Terrific!

Loved the recipe. This amount of seasoning is for over 3lbs of meat. Just divide seasoning if you're using 1lb of meat. Added I can of black beans, a couple of bay leaves & one 15 oz can of tomato sauce to 1 lb of browned turkey meat with seasoning & let it cook in the slow cooker all day. Came out great! Just add whatever type of meat & beans are you're preference. You can also use crushed or whole tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. It's all about whatever your preference is.

Real good, especially if you're a chilli aficionado who has a large range of different chilli powders and want to put them to use in another way - Chipotle powder goes really well and adds a smokey element, ghost pepper adds atomic heat and nice flavour, fatalii adds an exotic taste and a similar amount of heat - Generally the milder powders need to be doubled if you have chilli tolerance, say if you use jalapeno/chipotle/serrano while the hotter powders like ghost peppers or even moruga scorpions should be halved since they have so much concentrated heat and may take over the flavour of everything else.

Remember, less is always better than more when testing the heat/flavour balance as you can always go up and not down.

Slight modifications like adding paprika and rosemary are always welcome, personally I ALWAYS omit the flour and unless using chipotle powder usually omit the sugar as it's so smokey it needs the sugar.

And finally you can always upscale this by 3 times or so as it always seems to run out due to being so addictive and so perfect.

I use this when making Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili. It is a great combination. In the Chili recipe, I substitute 1lb ground turkey and 1lb Italian Turkey Sausage for the 2lbs ground beef, for a lower calorie option. VERY delicious.

I omit the flour (and the crushed red pepper if I do not want it spicy) and use 2-3 Tbsp for a batch of chili or taco meat mix.
To thicken chili a little I use refried beans - which I had read about on here.

This was a fantastic recipe.  My husband wanted chili for dinner.  I had the hamburger and the beans but no chili mix.  Went online and found this little lifesaver!  I didn't have the dried minced garlic or onions but I used onion salt and garlic powder instead.  I also added wayyyy less flour.  Only about 1 tablespoon.  Needless to say Hubby was VERY happy with his dinner!  Thank you!

Awesome!!!! I agree with other reviewers! No more packets for me, this went right in my favorites recipe box!  I did follow others advise and only did 2T flour & a little extra chili powder! Sooooooo good, we all loved it and my hubby raved!

Really good, I made 1/2 and did not end up with 1/2 of 3/4 cup (the recipe states it should make 3/4 cup).  I used a little less red pepper and my chili is very spicy, probably because I should have used less of this spice mix. Used with Debdoozie's Chili recipe and it's DEEE-LISH! (just a wee bit too hot). So, I used 1/2 of this for the 4 tablespoon in the Debdoozie's recipe when it looks like I should have used 1/3.

I looked for a chili seasoning because I forgot to buy some and we were in the middle of a winter storm.  It was actually very good and like other reviews, it's a wrap on buying chili seasoning.  The only thing I didn't have was parsley or basil so I used Italian seasoning.  It still came out good.  This is a keeper.

It had good flavor, but way too spicy.  I think I would reduce the crushed red pepper to 1 tsp.

Added great flavor to our chili! Next time will take out the flour (made our chili a little too thick for our liking) and reduce the red pepper flakes slightly (too spicy for my boyfriend, but just right for me). I recommend making it true to recipe the first time and monkey with it on later batches to fit your tastes!

Really good blend. I use a gluten free AP flour in place of the white flour to avoid wheat for my husband. Easy to make in bulk and I use it as a taco seasoning as well.

I  make it exactly the way it is written and it's perfect. I make an enormous batch of chili so maybe that's why I don't have any problem with the flour. I love this chili seasoning and it's the one I always use.

I cut the amount of flour to 2 T. as others suggested (that made it just the right amount.) Also needed quite a bit more chili powder, with these changes made it perfect for us.

Very flavorful, we really enjoyed this seasoning mix.  Next time we'll back off the crushed red pepper a bit.  It was a tad spicy for my toddlers, although they powered through it.

Great seasoning. I used the exact measurements.  My family is not big on spice, so next time I will use less heat. But this recipe was perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

Since I prefer my alterations over the original, I can't give it a 5. But, as a base to tweak from, it's tops!!!

I, like a lot of reviewers, use 2 tablespoons of flour. I then slow cook it to really unlock the flavors.

Perfect! I omitted the flour, as one reviewer said, and thickened it with refried beans. 2Tbs per pound is just right. I did up the chili powder to 2Tbs as suggested, and used oregano in place of the basil since I was out. I only made enough for one batch to make sure I liked it. But I am now going to make up enough for several batches so it's always on hand. Thank you! Great mix!

This is very good! No more buying seasoning packets for me! I have used it 3 times now and it is perfect for anything! I just add a teaspoon of cornstarch to it to help it thicken some w/certain recipes that I use it in. Thanks for this recipe!

2 thumbs up!!....I didn't use flour in the recipe like it called for, and I adjusted the measurements to make it a bit spicier.  I will never use store bought again!

I have used this recipe twice. The first time I made it to sell at the concession stand for a friday night High school football game and the next time for a pot luck at work. Both times I was MOBBED for requests for the recipe. I mixed up several batches of the seasoning while I had all of the spices out and stored it in a sealed jar. One half cup of the seasoning makes a single batch of chili.

Excellent, but just a bit too spicy for my taste. Next time I will cut the red peppers in half.

I thought this was a really great seasoning mix, though I did tweak it to suit my family's personal tastes and accomadate what we had at the time. No red pepper (didn't have any and don't like things super spicy anyway) and garlic powder instead of minced garlic because that's what I had. I put extra cumin in because that's how we like it. It was great!

Pretty spicy, my children suffered through it. It's not bad, I do really like the flour addition.

This was very good. I used the ratios a previous reviewer wrote (2Tbl per pound of meat) Except I chose to leave out the 1\4th cup of flour and so it made it a lot spicier. My husband and I enjoyed it but it was a little too spicy for the preschoolers. .

I omit the flour, salt and sugar. I halve the red pepper flakes because I use Rotel a lot my son finds it too spicy. I added 1 tsp oregano and double the minced onion and garlic.

This makes a ton! I used onion and garlic powder instead of the dried minced. It was spicy (obviously cut back on the red pepper a bit if you are going for mild). It worked in a pinch but I prefer the package stuff better.

Excellent!  Save money by making your own 'seasoning packets' from what is already in your cupboards!

Great seasoning. I did cut back on the flour and sugar and did add more chili powder. Was great in the turkey chili I made. Thanks for a good blend of spices!

Really good.  I was a little confused on how to use.  It did say 6 servings.  I didn't change ingredients liked the flavor just the way it was and used all the flour it called for if you use stewed tomatoes it works great.

Good Stuff, I cut the flour down just a touch and added a littel more chili powder for color. I'll keep this recipe for sure.
