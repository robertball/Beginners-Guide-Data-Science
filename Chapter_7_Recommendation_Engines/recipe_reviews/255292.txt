Made as written and this turned out perfect! It is universal enough to use with many different things. I made it to put on my burger and it tasted so good I ended up using it for a dipping sauce for my fries too. This one is definitely a keeper.

Had no idea aioli was so easy to make. I cheated a little and used store-bought roasted garlic from the olive bar, other than that followed the recipe as written. So delicious!!! My husband is far less of a garlic enthusiast than I am, and even he loved it. Can't wait to try it on a burger.

Very delicious. My hubby told me I'll have to make it again and again as a spread for our Mushroom Swiss burgers!
