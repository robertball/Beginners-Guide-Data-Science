I submitted this recipe and I really want to share something valuable. In Germany, we usually add spices to the bread and they are available for purchase already ground up or as seeds. If you want, take a handful of Coriander, fennel, Anis, and/or Caraway seeds and add to the dough. I actually buy loose fennel tea seeds (cheaper) and smash it up good with a Mortar and add it. It adds a wonderful flavor and tastes so good! I now use a small coffee bean grinder to grind the seeds and I often add sunflowers seeds (salted or not) to the dough as well, which makes the bread juicier. 

The bread in the picture was done in a traditional bread basket. I put a dish towel in the basket, then sprinkle it with flour (you can see the flour on the outside of the bread in the picture), then pad the bread dough into it for the second rising. Invert onto a baking sheet (I always use a baking stone) and bake! Oh, if you decide to freeze some (it freezes very well), simply put it in a zip lock bag, then when you are ready to eat it thaw it in the CLOSED bag! It only takes a few hours to thaw. Enjoy!

I noticed mixed results from different people and would like to say that this is not uncommon with this type of bread. Even I get different results sometimes depending on the climate. It matters quite a bit if it is humid/warm or cold.  I do believe (but have no prove) that even elevation makes a difference. So if you get poor results DON'T GIVE UP. Try...temp/climate/baking time of day...changes!

I made this recipe and the bread is very good with a crunchy crust.  I only made half of the recipe and was able to knead it entirely in the mixer. I still needed to use a very large bowl for the starter because it rose up and ran over.  I lost part of the starter, but the dough still balled up in the mixer and cleared the sides of the bowl and I didn't need to add extra flour or water to the measurements.  My husband is also from Germany and remembers bread baking day when he was little.  He thinks this recipe is pretty authentic too.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I lived in Germany for a year and absolutely fell in love with the bread there.  Ever since I've returned to the States, I've been wishing that I could purchase German-style bread, but it's nearly impossible to find.  But now i don't have to find it because this recipe tastes so authentic.  

I do, however, want to share the three things that I did differently with this recipe.  First, I used my own super tasty and entirely local sourdough starter so I didn't follow the first part of the recipe about creating a starter. Second, I halved the recipe because it sounded like so much bread. To do this, I had to make an educated guess on how much to use of the sourdough starter I already have. I went with two cups, and it seems to have worked perfectly. Third,  I made the dough using the dough cycle of my breadmaker.  After the cycle ended, I shaped the bread and let it rise for an additional hour.  Even with these changes, the bread turned out amazing and like an authentic loaf of Bauernbrot.

This is a great recipe but a lot of work. I've used other, simpler recipes that are just as good. On the other hand...I did get two GIANT round loaves out of this so I guess it was worth the effort.  The starter does rise A LOT, so be sure to use a huge bowl or one of the special buckets you can buy for this type of recipe.  Also, although the dense, firm texture seemed just right, the bread I baked seemed to suffer from the "dry crumblies" - maybe next time I'll add a little potato flour as I read on kingarthurflour.com that this may help moisten it just a tad so it will hold together better. All in all a good recipe for that elusive, German flavor!

Update: I tried adding 3T. potato flour and the texture was much better. Could probably even use more. My German m-i-l tells me her neighbor actually adds a cooked, grated potato to the dough when she makes this kind of bread.

FYI ... 1 1/2 ounces fresh yesast equals 5 tsp plus a scant more of instant yeast.  This is a wonderful bread, worth the advance planning !

This the best bread I've had since leaving Germany several years ago. I took the suggestion and added a little potatoe flour.  Otherwise I followed it exactly.  I compared it to some bread we purchased from Chicago.  The Chicago bread was slightly darker but the consistency about the same.  Has anyone tried adding a cup or two of regular stone ground rye in place of some of the white rye?  White rye is not available locally so if I can get by with a little less it would good.  My German wife dreamed that I lost this recipe the first night after trying this bread.  She was really impressed.  Thank you for posting this recipe. Jerry

I absolutely love this receipe!  However, some helpful hints to include in your directions, this particular dough will double very quickly and you must put it in a large container to prevent it from overflowing!  I didn't see the spices recommended for the bread until i read through your reviews, those would have been good to know ahead of time.  Also, fresh yeast is hard to come by in my leg of the world so i used dry active yeast in converted equivalency.. works good!  I don't have an electric mixer and so I knead it myself which is more difficult but allows you to regulate how much extra flour you knead in.  IF you get the dry crumblies, you have too much flour in it, if it doesn't rise, your yeast has died or you didn't use enough. Could also be that your water was too warm or too cold when dissolving the yeast it won't rise either.  This is not intended to be condescending just helpful!!  I come from a long line of Irish and German bakers and my mom loves this bread!  It gets better every time I make it!

You did a very good job on this. The only difference is we use wheat flour in place of white. We also use sunflower seeds.

A marvelous and tasty recipe for what I think is about as genuinely German as you might get from any Bäckerei. And though this peasant bread will give you quite a workout in the kneading process,  it is well worth it given the end result. And oh...no joke on the pre-ferment prep for this sourdough. Make sure the vessel is at LEAST twice as large as the quantities you're going to mix together as this will contain the growth and prevent a over the top experience!  Thanks Petra!!

This is an exceptional recipe.  I doubled the recipe and thought my mixer was going to kick the bucket, so I ended up kneading it by hand - what a workout!  Exceptional bread!

I too have been on a quest to find good German bread here in the US. I have been to specialty stores, international food stores but none of them had the bread I was looking for. It was close sometimes but it was not what I was used to from Germany. So I tried this recipe. I have to admit I was a little bit scared since it was the first time making bread for me. Also the huge amount scared me a little too since I didn't want to throw everything away should it go wrong. So I only took a quarter of the amounts stated above, also because no one else will eat the bread since my husband is a soft white bread lover. I was not sure about the texture of the dough either but I just kept going according to the recipe and I have to say it turned out wonderful. I had to cut off a slice before it was even cool. The crust was so delicious. When the dough got too stiff while kneading I just wet my hands. That was enough to soften it up again. I also put a bunch of sunflower seeds in it since I always loved grains in bread.
I also used highly active dry yeast because I couldn't find any fresh yeast. Used the conversion that one of the users suggested in the reviews. Next time I will try and bake it in a loaf pan. I already used it to shape the bread and my mom always baked bread in one of these.

My mom is German and I spent most of my childhood there, so we know our German bread around here. This is a very good recipe for Bauernbrot. It was also quite easy to make.  I made this for the first time this weekend and my mom and I were beyond delighted. My kids were devouring it too. A few things to mention: I used dark rye, instead of light, since that was all I could find at the store. The starter I made never really rose much, though it was very active and bubbling. No problems with the bread, it rose just fine. While kneading, the dough seemed pretty sticky to me, so I added a fair amount of flour as I kneaded. During the last rise it stilled wanted to spread (I think partly just because of the size of these enormous loaves) so I think I will get some bread baskets to use in the future. I floured and scored the top of the bread before baking it on a stone. This made two very large loaves. They barely fit on my stone. I might have to make three smaller loaves next time. I think I will also add some spices and rye berries next time as well. Great recipe. Thank you Petra!

This is some of the best bread I've ever made. Excellent texture and crust. Good flavour too. I halved the recipe and it still made 2 big loaves (appx. 1.8 - 2 lbs/each).

This is the first German bread I made, for my German mother in law and her husband who loves anything German. I thought this bread was okay, but they raved about it non stop and finished the whole thing in about 3 days (they don't normally eat a lot of bread!). They order their German bread from some super expensive online place across the country, they are very picky about it. So I think it's safe to say that this recipe is authentic and tastes a lot like real German bread. They asked me make this a standing weekly order :) Their reaction is precisely why we all love to bake, so thank you for this recipe!

I made 1/2 recipe as a full one would have been way too much for the family. Read recipe wrong and made the starter a day too late to get bread baked on the weekend. So into the 'fridge it went for 4 days and it was just fine. Something to remember for next time. Need to add more white flour the next time, however, as the dough was way too soft (I KNEW this and went ahead anyways, shame on me) and lost shape on the 2nd rise. Looked like a big hockey puck!. But taste was excellent, just like I remember. I will try this again and remember next time to go with my instincts and add more flour. Its getting 4 stars because the flour was off, but I would give a 5 for taste.

My starter is kind of weak I guess - even though it's all bubbly when warm - but I have tried this bread twice and it never rose sufficiently.   I suppose I will have to try it with the starter in the recipe at one point, but the thing is, for people who already have a starter, this recipe lacks the quantity you will really need of it, and a lot of people may in fact already have a starter and are just looking for new and different recipes. Thus the 4 stars.  The taste is good though, I think if it is nicely risen and moist, it will probably be just like good old German bread - provided you add some bread spice.

I have actually made this recipe several times.  I have made it as is, and have made a significant change. The five out of five stars is for the recipe as is. But I will still give my "tweak".
This recipe worked perfectly.  For those who have complained about it being flat, there are a few reasons. One is your yeast may be dead.  Second, bear in mind that when she says 1-2 hours or until doubled in size, it is the size that matters more than the time.  It might take longer, so just go with it.  I used an existing starter, and the initial rise in my kitchen takes 18 hours.  Really.  So, please wait until it is doubled, rather than giving it exactly 2 hours.
Now, for my tweak, I have a sourdough starter that is about six months old.  I basically skipped steps 1 and 2, and went straight to step three, mixing a quart of existing starter with the flour from that point on.  It was much much tangier, and slightly denser.  Both recipes work, though.  Guten Apetit!

Excellent Bread! I had a sourdough starter so I used it. I used dark rye flour and grainy bread flour. I baked it in bread pans and it was wonderful! Thanks for the recipe.

My loafs came out huge and tasted great when they were still a bit warm.  The next day there was nothing impressive about them and you could only eat it after toasting it.  Next time I will either cut the recipe in half or make 4 loafs so that are eaten the first day they are made or given away.

This was my first attempt at making a bread that began with a starter. It came out very good.

I too have been on a quest to find the most authentic German Bauernbrot recipe. The picture looks perfect. I halved the recipe like some have done and used my own sourdough. I will have to say it turned out pretty badly. Heavy as a rock, way too sour,did not rise well. I ate half a piece and threw the rest away.
 That being said, since the overwhelming majority of reviewers think this bread is authentic and wonderful, I will give it another try. I will blame the flub on me, not on the recipe. I have a question: if I use my own starter, what is the recommended amount to use? The recipe doesn't indicate how much starter is being used. I used 2 cups for half the recipe. One cup might have been enough?
Also, the dough was so heavy and dry I could hardly knead it. I ended up adding the amount of water for the whole recipe, even though I cut the flour in half. Is the dough supposed to be so stiff?
Any suggestions from those who had success with this recipe?

The hard part is wanting the sour dough starter to be ready NOW! I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and subbed agave syrup for sugar in the starter, while using no sweetener when making the bread!  I love the texture and taste of this bread!  Thanks for the recipe!

Bread turned out great, but I made breads before which tasted about the same, but were way less time consuming. I would recommend the recipe, just because it gives you the feeling of the real bread making, but if you want to bake it quick, don't bother making this recipe.

I have a friend from Germany and it just kills her that she cannot get German bread here. I had wanted to make bread from scratch so I decided to try this for her. She said it is exactly like she gets in Germany and is so thankful that she can now get it in the states. She calls me her own personal baker. I personally do not like the bread, she says it is an acquired taste and the only American who she knows that likes it is her husband. We will be making this recipe very frequently.

I served this to my German in-laws. It's the closest I think I'll ever get to the real deal.  The firm texture is right on. The flavor is very mild, great toasted with jam. The 2lb. box of rye flour I bought was only 7 C. so I added a cup of white.  Mixing was a chore.  The two loaves were huge, though.  Now if I can only find the right kind of leberkase...

Thank you for posting this recipe.  I am from Bavaria also, and I just prepared this recipe.  It turned out perfect the first time.  My family really enjoys it and I will definitely make it again.  I own this instant success to having very fresh yeast that rose nicely each time I kneaded it and let it do its thing.  Also, I did not add too much flour when kneading it, as that would cause the bread to be dry and crumbly.  Just enough flour to keep it from sticking to the bread board.  I would also recommend cutting slits in the top after forming so that the bread has somewhere to expand while baking.  Thanks again.

It’s a good thing I lift weights because the kneading  took some effort.?? I think I could have done better job of that due to the density.  I used dark rye because that’s what I had. The crust was very hard the first day, but softened up later. I liked it a lot and will make it again.

This is an excellent base recipe for German rye bread. I have  made this many times. The key is to knead the bread very well. I use a Kitchenaid stand mixer. And after the dough comes together, I continue running the machine for another 10 minutes. The final dough should be satiny  but a little tacky, not completely dry. This makes a lot of dough (3.6 kg or 8 lbs). I have the largest mixer and it is at its capacity. If mixing by hand, make a half recipe. I use dark rye flour (whole rye flour) and substitute 2 c of buttermilk for the 2 c of water in the final dough. I usually make it into 3 loaves—leaving 1 plain, adding caraway seeds to one and deeply browned onions to the third. ( I use 3 medium onions, sliced into half rounds about 1/4 inch thick and sautéed until dark golden brown. Blot with paper towels to remove moisture and knead into dough. Add additional white flour as needed for proper consistency. )
Outstanding flavor!

I will probably not make this bread again unless I can find out why my crust was rock hard!  I could not even slice it.  The center was fine and I had no issues with the  bread rising.  I did find the taste very bland so definitely add more spices.  Not trying to be mean just stating that I has issues with this bread.  It ended up in the trash after all the hard work :(.

I had to use stone ground rye and feared it would be too heavy so I lowered the amount to 6 cups and raised the regular flour to 6 cups.  I felt it needed more salt.  I did the full recipe but cut it into 4 loaves and put black caraway in 2, anise in 1 and regular caraway in the final.  I like the texture of the bread and felt  the directions were well written.  I'd make again but with more salt.

I will make this again.  Great texture and flavoring.  Easy dough to knead.  I followed the recipe as presented.  A true German bread in my opinion.  I was at a church event today and our past pastor who is from Germany, and his wife who is from Austria were there for a church dinner.  They loved this bread.

One cautionary note:  When I was prepping for this I did not pay attention to the volume of flour required.  I had to break the dough and starter up into three batches to fit my Kitchenaid mixer.  That said, next time I will cut the recipe down by 1/3.
