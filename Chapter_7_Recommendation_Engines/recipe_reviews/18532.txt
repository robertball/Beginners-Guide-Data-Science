Been making this for years and it has never failed me (except for the time that I tried making it a little lower fat and used lo-fat sour cream ... don't do that ... it makes a mess!)  Always a huge hit no matter who I serve it to.  Whole family ADORES it - daughter has been known to hide leftovers at the back of the fridge for herself!

Used 1/2 cup ricotta and 1/2 cup sour cream instead of 1c sour cream.  Also. added a little romano w/ the parmesan.  Instant hit w/ the family- everyone had seconds!

i made this recipe (for 2 pies) so i could take one to my boyfriend's mom's house and one to my mom's house thanksgiving day. besides being very easy to make, everyone at both houses loved it. needless to say, i will be making this recipe again soon!

the only thing i would recommend when making them would be to keep out the 1/2 cup of butter - the butter used to cook the onions proved to be enough.

Tried this recipe and loved it. The only thing I did different was make a crust from ritz crackers and butter. And reserved some to sprinkle on top before baking.  Excellent

I cut the recipe in half and made 1 pie.  Delicious!  I added more onions then reduced and carmelized them for that sweet flavor.  Added chopped tomato and a few bacon bits.  Excellent recipe!

This was wonderful!  Many of my guests were hesitant about trying an onion pie but all of them raved about it! I used an unbaked pie crust since it seemed the amount of time to bake it was quite long and I feared burning a crust that was already baked.  I covered the edges of the crust with foil strips.  I also omitted the hot sauce. The pie was delicious and looked good too!  I'll definitely try this again!

Made as-written I give this 3 stars. I had higher hopes for it. I carmelized my onions and used a little more than called for. Not bad, but too eggy and "gloopy" for me. I made it better the second time by turning it into a sort of pierogie pie. I added mashed potato flakes, some milk, and shredded cheddar cheese.

Y-U-M!  My favorite thing about this recipe is that I make about 8 at a time, cook them all, and stick them in the freezer.  I always have a ready-made dish for any event that requires me to bring something....and everyone LOVES it!  Good hot or even cold!

Made a variation of this as a light meal, and everyone luved it. Included optional sweet peppers and ground beef. Cooked onions and sweet peppers using half the butter specified in recipe and a couple shots of sweet soy sauce. Mixed with the eggs and sour cream, used 1/2 cup cheddar cheese in lieu of Parmesan, and seasoned lightly with Creole seasoning from this site. Browned 3/4 lb. ground beef . . . in a separate bowl mixed beef with a few squirts of BBQ sauce. Poured onion mixture into pie shells filling both half full, followed by a layer of hamburger, and remaining onion mixture as the last layer. Omitted paprika and hot sauce. After switching to the lower oven temp, spread mozzarella cheese over top of pies, and baked until lightly brown on top. A nice change of pace, and ooh so good!

This was excellent! I even froze one of them after baking and reheated, and it was just as good. A lovely onion quiche-type dish. Thanks for sharing!

This is a winner.  Family now requests that I bring it to gatherings.  Note that the recipe makes two pies, so I either adjust for one pie or make two and throw one in the freezer to bake when I need it.  Also, a few crumbled Ritz crackers on top add a nice flavor and texture.

this was delicious!i bought the 10 lb bag of vidalias at costco and used 7 of them for the recipe.the only change i made was adding a little less than 1 tsp of cajun seasoning instead of salt and pepper, and sprinkling some real bacon bits on top of the pies before baking them.this recipe filled 2 sara lee deep dish pie shells.it was soooo yummy!i froze one pie to eat later.i made sure to really let the onions get good and soft to bring out all their sweetness.thanks so much for the recipe!

This was my first time having Vidalia Onion pie and I thought it was great!  Perfect recipe to use up those extra onions from Costco!  No changes are necessary.

I was only able to use about 3 onions. My onions were really big. But this was a declious dish. I added about a handful of shredded cheese. It was good.

I reduced this recipe in half and it did very well. Mine was done much faster than the recipe called for. This was very rich tasting. Thanks.

I live in Vidalia!  I've never had an onion pie and this is a GREAT recipe!  I added a jar of sweet red peppers and probably put in a little bit more cheese. It was beautiful and it tasted like Heaven.  Thank you so very much.

Delicious!!  Great with beef of any sort....hamburgs on the grill, steak, rib roast.  Be adventurous and add crumbled bacon and diced green pepper.  Sprinkle with Feta cheese.  So glad I tried this.

The hot sauce totally ruined this dish. Otherwise, you've basically got an onion quiche. Too bad.
--
Addendum: I lowered the hot sauce amount and got a really good dish.

I had a big bag of sweet onions I needed to use up, so I made this to accompany a roast chicken. Hubs and I agree it is just ok as written. Two things though - I did not use a crust and I used reduced fat sour cream. We found the final product quite bland and sort of eggy/curdled. If I make again, I will make the custard more rich and add more Texas Pete. I think some sharp white cheddar would be a good addition.

We are getting wonderful Vidalia onions here so I wanted to try this for dinner.  I halved the recipe and used two large softball onions as well as homemade pie crust.  It was delicious!  I didn't bother with the paprika.  I think you could add any number of things to this like broccoli, spinach, bacon and/or tomatoes.  I think you could also play with the cheese like using Swiss.  Thanks!

Delicious!  I made this with egg substitute , half the butter, 1/4 less sour cream and no crust and it was still tasty.  This cut out a lot of calories yet it turned out really well....I will definitely be making this often.

This pie is great! I make it crust free as we have a celiac member of the family and it's still great.  Even my teenager love this and she's always suspicious of onions.  Also, I sub creme fraiche for the sour cream which may make it a little thicker (I've never tried the sour cream).  Thanks for sharing!

I made a bunch of different pies for Pi Day, and this is the one we have all been reaching for the most!  I did have trouble understanding about cooking the onions for 10 minutes till clear and soft; it took a good 30 minutes before I felt they were finally ready.  But we really love the taste of this pie and wouldn't change a thing.

Having moved south a few years ago, one thing I've fallen in love with is Vidalia Onions.  They're readily available and cheap in the spring, and I'm always looking for new ways to work them into foods.  Everyone turned their noses up when I said "onion pie".  But, this disappeared fast.  Very different, but very good.  After the first bit, I wasn't sure, but the more you eat, the more you love it.  I cut the recipe in half and used a frozen pie crust (didn't cook it first, and the crust came out perfectly).  Next time, the only change I'd make would be more hot sauce.  I love the touch of heat in this pie.

My father requested that I make an onion pie.  I had NEVER heard of an onion pie and to be honest, it did not sound good at all.  After making this the first one, I did an experiment and added Italian Turkey Sausage.  That was the worst thing I could have done.  Ever since then his buddies have requested one after another and another.

I loved these! I halved the recipe and made a dozen crustless mini quiches in greased muffin cups. I used two teaspoons of hot chili flakes instead of the hot sauce. I will most definitely make these again!

So good.  I leave out the hot sauce 'cuz I'm a big ole' sissy.  But I serve this for brunch, lunch, or dinner.  I'm making two this Christmas, one for my father-in-law and one for my husband's grandfather.

Excellent. Sort of like a quiche. I put lattice work over the top to fool my kids into thinking we were having "pie" for dinner on april fools day. This would be better as a brunch meal or add maybe some chopped ham to make it a main dinner dish. Dosent work really well as a side.

Great tasting, easy to make, but was surprised at how "eggy" this dish was.  Next time, I will serve it at a brunch instead of a sidedish at dinner.  Must try!

If you do not like onions, you will not like this recipe. I hoped the ingredients would come together in some interesting way, but it just tastes like a quiche with too many onions.

This pie was great!  I did make some changes though.  I cut the recipe in half, but used 3/4 cup sour cream, instead of parmesan cheese I used about 1 1/4 cup grated swiss cheese (1 cup in the ipe and 1/4 or more sprinkled on top), and instead of hot sauce I used a sprinkle or two of nutmeg.  The changes I made were for personal preference, but the pie turned out wonderful!

I cut the recipe in half and used a deep dish pie shell.  I added about 1 teaspoon of Worchestershire sauce to the ingredients.  I put about ¼ teaspoon of Paprika into the sauce mix and used it liberally on the top.  I used freshly ground Parmesan cheese.

It was delicious!!  Even my husband (who dislikes onions) said this recipe is a keeper.

It was a good recipe but I did feel that it needed some pizzaz. I am an onion lover, but I found it rather bland. I would try it again, but spice it up a little, maybe add some zesty cheese.

Oh this is good! I made it as written and I wouldn't change anything. You can change up the cheese or add to it, but this is perfect for using up extra onions!

I purchased the 10 pound bag of onions from Costco. I was excited to make these two pies. I did enjoy the pie however  following the recipe I had a fair amount of waste. I had 2 cups of raw onions that would not fit into my sauté pan even though it was large and had 2 cups of egg onion batter that would not fit into my pie shells. I would suggest editing the recipe by  adding deep dish pie shells and provide a guidance of the number of cups of onions and change medium skillet to large.

Realized after I started it that I didn’t have any sour cream—too far to run to the store at that point, so I used Hellman’s mayo instead. Increased the amount of Parmesan by half, and this was one of the best dinners I’ve made in a long time!!!!  Had a nice salad with it as suggested—perfect!!!!!

I cooked the onion pie (on 375 degrees) for 10 mins longer than the directions stated.  It still did not have the brown color I wanted on top so I broiled it for a few minutes.     It turned out great!

Liked it very much. I cut the recipe in half, although if I had more onions, I could have frozen the second pie. Did not add hot sauce to the mix, but had it on the table in case anyone wanted to use it on their serving. I did add about a tablespoon of chopped sundried tomatoes, which was a great addition.

Will definitely make again as it was a family hit the first time.  Based on suggestions from others, made the following changes:  3 eggs instead of 4, half the hot sauce, and tried one pie with a crust and one without.  They were both great.  And the onions did take more like 30 minutes.  Ours were Walla Walla sweet onions.

This was a real hit! I did use a bit more butter to sauté the onions and have some in the pie batter. Otherwise made EXACTLY as directed and it turned out great. It will be a regular of mine from now on. Don't be afraid of it - does not taste too 'oniony' at all. I did not add hot sauce and it was great as it was.

Well, like most people, I altered the recipe a little bit - mostly based upon what I had on hand.  I halved the recipe because I only had one deep dish pie shell. A 1/2tsp of sugar was added to the onions and butter while being sauteed. I used about a quarter cup of a bagged Mexican blend of cheeses in the onion and egg mixture along with a pinch of shredded swiss and shredded garlic cheddar cheese. I then topped the pie with a generous portion probably about a cup) of a shredded swiss and shredded garlic cheddar cheeses.  It was fabulous and surprisingly not Weight Watcher's unfriendly. I loved this dish and cannot wait to make it again.

I feel a little dishonest reviewing this recipe even though I altered both the cooking method as well as the ingredients. 1st, I pre cooked the pie shells for 15 minutes at 375, as I was a bit concerned about sogginess. 2nd and 3rd were ingredient adjustments - diced ham and 1/4 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, as I had them leftover. I ended up with two amazing pies that I am sure did not need my adjustments. Absolutely delicious!! My 5 year old was arguing with me - with a mouthful of pie - that she doesn't like onions, eggs or cheese. Hehehehe. Awesome.

I had a store bought pie crust in the fridge that I needed to use - this seemed like a good way.  It was great!  Halved the recipe because I had one pie crust - but used 3 eggs.  Other than that made it as directed.  Delicious with the salmon croquettes from this site!

Very good.  I topped the pie with cooked bacon crumbled and only a bottom crust.

OMG This was absolutly amazing. I made a few additions, I added chopped red and yellow peppers and a portabella mushroom. Since I did not have enough sour cream I used a mixture of sour cream, ricotta and gorganzola cheese spread. My boyfriend and I ate half of it...now I have to make another one to take to my parents' house so much for halving the recipe.

I made this for an onion cook off at work and won 1st place! It was great and I received sooo many complements. The only thing I changed was I used 5 onions instead of six.

I loved this dish and so did my husband!  It was simple to make using a Pilsbury pie crust and was all we needed for supper.  I used fat free sour cream and it was fine.

Fixed this for Christmas dinner and all onion lovers in the family gave it 5 stars. I used asiago instead of parmesan since it's what I had in the house. I only used 5 onions and it was still too much... couldn't fit all the filling into my deep dish pie shells.

very good. My family was surprised at the mild and delicious flavor. I cut recipe in half to make 1 pie and added provolone cheese to the mix. this is a keeper (for onion lovers).

I love this pie, I add the cheese in the mixture as well as sprinkling it on top.  Everytime I make this recipe I get rave reviews!  I can't wait for Vidalia onion season just so I can make this pie!

The results are pretty good.  Lots of chopping of onions but I think since they are vidalias, there is less tears.  I had to substitute olive oil for the butter and a shredded romano for the grated parmasean.  Next time I will leave out the hot sauce; the pie needs something else, maybe sundried tomatoes or calamata olives, not hot sauce.
