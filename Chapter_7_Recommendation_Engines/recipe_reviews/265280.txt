8.23.18  I followed this recipe to the letter and wouldn’t change a thing, it turned out awesome.  I sliced the onions and  mushrooms and mixed up the meat patties (including the pork) in the morning, put them in the fridge, and then this was just a breeze to make later for dinner in the Instant Pot®.  The gravy is absolutely delicious, and that little bit of red wine adds incredible richness and depth of flavor.  Do use a good-quality beef broth/stock (the only one that I buy is Kitchen Basics® for beef, chicken, and vegetable), and it’s what has been used in every cooking class that I’ve ever taken (well, I haven’t taken that many, but they’ve always used Kitchen Basics).  Not sure what happened to my onions, as they seem to be barely visible, but their flavor contributes greatly to that crazy-good gravy.  Some might say “…hey, this is just salisbury steak,” but this turned out exceptionally well, that’s why I’m raving about it.  This one’s going into my Favorites, definitely a “make-again” recipe.

My husband made these for dinner the other night and they were so delicious.  I prepped the patties before going into work and he took care of the rest.  We made everything almost exactly the same except the parsley in the patties.  I guess I ran out of it and realized last minute but either way they were still very flavorful.  We doubled the batch and have frozen the other half for another busy weeknight.  Thanks

Definitely a keeper! Made exactly as described, but because I like salt, will probably add some salt to the meat mixture next time.

This was excellent! The only changes I made were due to dietary restrictions (omitted egg, used Ian's panko bread crumbs for Gluten Free, Dairy Free, and Egg free, and subbed the red wine for marsala wine as that's what I had on hand). The patties held together perfectly and the flavor of the sauce with the mushrooms and onions was so spot on perfect for Salisbury Steak! Even my mushroom hater just pushed aside the mushrooms and said this dish was super good...not once, but twice! Served with mashed sweet potatoes and to my surprise the sauce goes well...complimented and cut the sweetness of the potatoes nicely imo. My husband had some corn too. Perfect all around meal! Thanks for another great recipe, Bren!

This meal with soooo good! I just love the instant pot. I wanted to make a little bit more so I used 1 pd of ground pork instead of 1/2, used two eggs (because they were a little on the small size) and 1/2 cup bread crumbs. It made six larger patties. The sauce I did one and one half times the recipe just so that we would have left overs. Everyone that ate this meal said it was awesome and to def keep to make again!

Surprisingly good.  I've made it twice following the recipe precisely.  Rave reviews both times.  Easily our fav so far. 
 FWIW, our Instant Pot takes about 10 mins to build pressure and 28 for natural release.

Perfect example of why electric pressure cookers are sometimes no faster than a regular pot. This recipe calls for 15 minutes preheat, 15 minutes to cook and 10-40 minutes [?] to cool down.  I browned the patties in a frying pan and had then finished in a stove-top pressure cooker in barely 20 minutes. They tasted alright; nothing special.

Delicious and easy. Stuck to the recipe, couldn’t be better,  served it on a bed of sweet potato mash with peas and corn.

Someone posted that "normal" salisbury steak doesn't take as long as this recipe. Well, if you include letting the patties sit in the fridge for an hour, it does!

I followed the recipe exactly as printed and it came out perfect and so delicious.   I used instant buttery mashed pototoes.  This was the best salsbury steak, very tasty, and the gravy not  super thick (i hate thick gravy).  I plan on using this recipe often.

As commented on by others, the patties shrunk a lot while cooking (looked more like large meatballs than patties). I had to add twice the cornstarch/broth to thicken the gravy. In the end, the gravy did not have much flavor. I also agree that it could have been made much faster, and I could have checked the patties for shrinkage, as well as adjusted the gravy while cooking. Will not make again.

This was simply delicious. I made the patties when I got home from work and didn’t have time to chill them for an hour. They were a little loose when I sautéed them but firmed up during the pressure cooking. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I didn't have mushrooms, but still was great (Added TraderJoe's Mushroom Umami Seasoning -approx 1/2 tsp- along with 1/2 tsp beef consommé concentrate to the onion and panko mixture)  Flavorful but not salty, very tender. I've made many versions of this dish and this is our favorite.   Guess I do't need to search for this recipe anymore - thanks for sharing it!

Best  one i ever made. I think the pork made them more tender not as dense and dry as just using beef. I will def make them again. I would add a bit more stock to the pot because all my juice was pretty well gone.

Didn't stick exactly to the recipe but it came out wonderful just the same. Added a little bit of minced mushroom into the patties and a couple other minor things here and there that made it my own. Will definitely be making this again.

Needed absolutely NO adjustments but the gravy was too thick by the time we sat down to eat so I added about a cup of beef broth & mushrooms (requested by hubby) and O.M.G..... best beef gravy my husband and I EVER ate.

Didn't make any changes in this recipe. It was delicious. Used red cooking wine since that's all I had. I did cook it in a large fry pan. Even a person who was saying you know I don't like onions and mushrooms cleared his plate and raved!!

The pot is too deep to flip the burgers so I sauteed them 2 minutes per side in a skillet first, setting aside. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms in the IP, then added the sauce over the sauteed mushroom/onion and laid the partially cooked burgers on top. Followed the cooking instructions per recipe and the result was  overcooked shrunken patties, obliterated onions, practically non-existent mushrooms, excessive gravy which was oily due to the pork. Looked nothing like the photo. I won't make this again.

Followed the recipe exactly except I used soy sauce instead of W sauce since I had none in the house. This is by far the tastiest meal I ever made in an Insta pot.

I followed the recipe exactly. This was a time consuming endeavor. Although the flavor was very good, there was no reason to make it a multi-step process in an Instant Pot. Prepping the patties takes half an hour. Add another 1.5 hours if you decide to refrigerate them. The sautee steps take another half hour. The full time to pressure cook is 45 minutes, then you have to finish the gravy. I like the recipe but will look for a different was to make it next time.

VERY YUMMY!  I doubled the recipe and made 1/4 lb patties.  Caramelized the onions (I didn't use mushrooms) before adding ALL the gravy ingredients and then let simmer for a bit to meld the flavors.  Then I cooked on high pressure 15 minutes, natural release 15 minutes.  Removed patties to a plate and used sauté function to thicken sauce with cornstarch ( I used more than called for for a thicker gravy), then returned patties to simmer just before serving.  This is everything a great Salisbury steak should be; tender, tasty patties and a delicious gravy!  Thank you!

I made it exactly as the recipe says, except I did not have parsley. I think I should have added more salt to the pot before I did the pressure cooking. My husband and I loved it. I made mashed potatoes and baby Brussel sprouts.

Several steps and a bit more time consuming than I hoped, but it turned out really well.  Tasted just as I remembered Salisbury Steak to taste.  Husband loved it and had seconds.  The meat was extremely tender and moist.  I used 3 Tbsp corn starch to get a nice thick sauce.

I wasn't a fan of the finished product.  Perhaps the onion I used was too strong but it really had a strong onion taste.  I won't make this one again.

Amazing recipe! I have made it 3 times and it disappears quickly. Heats up very well and with mashed potatoes and green beans it's a top #5 recipe in my house for the instant pot.

We used all beef, as I didn’t have ground pork. I think that next time I’ll add a little liquid into the breadcrumb-beef mix, as I found the patties a little dry.  We will definitely make this again!

Awesome recipe. Don’t be fooled by the time listed. I did not use the refrigerator time . I mixed up the meat, then strait to sauté. Cooks in 5 min. The recipe is perfect. It was finished at the same time as my sides. Thank you for an awesome recipe

I liked the Salisbury steak.  The only thing I would change is the amount if onion,  Too much onion for me.  It totally masks the taste of the mushrooms.

Really good base. I left out the instant pot and did everything on the stovetop instead. It turned out super yummy. I made sure to simmer the patties in the gravy 15 - 20 minutes to make sure everything was cooked through.

This recipe is just wonderful.  It sounds a little lengthy when reading but it really isn't.  Gravy is a little thin when done but just add a little more cornstarch and water as suggested.  Next time, I will make extra patties and freeze them so I will have them prepared.  That will cut done on the prep time.  This recipe is a keeper and will be used often in my home.  My husband LOVED it!!!!!!

I made this recipe using ground venison rather than ground beef (we have a freezer full!), and the sauce does an amazing job of hiding any gamey taste, if you're sensitive to that.  Be careful when you're adding cornstarch at the end -- the sauce thickened so much that I had to add broth to thin it back out. Maybe bring it down to 1 T. rather than 2 T. of cornstarch.  Other than that, it was so tasty.  The whole family enjoyed it!

Good, not great. They ended up looking more like big meatballs.  I felt they were a little flavorless. The gravy was good, but I had to thicken it more. I’m not sure I would make them again.

New family favorite. This meal is now in our regular lineup. The first time I made it the family ate all of it so the 2nd time I doubled the batch and we had some leftovers for lunches the next day. The left overs might even be better then the first night. Followed the recipe to the “T” and wouldn’t change a thing. This is comfort food at its best.

Made it as directed except for a few cooking step changes. 1. I didn't leave the meat out for 30 minutes, that's just asking for bacteria to grow on it. I also letft the natural release for my InstantPot for 15 minutes, after that the pressure is pretty much low enough and you're just letting it stew in the sauce, which is fine if that's what you want, but it isn't necessary. I was afraid it was going to have a strong tomato taste but it came out fine. My only complaint is the meat patties were falling apart and we had to scoop them out, might add some more egg next time. All-in-all, we liked this recipe and will make it again. For those complaining about doing it in an IP or that it took too long. I only dirtied one pot to make the whole recipe, and if you cut the release time you won't be waiting around. This recipe was simple to make and worth the effort IMHO.

Just a question, avocado oil? Is that necessary instead of regular vegetable oil?

I followed this almost to the letter. What I didn’t do was use any onion. I have an onion hater in the house that wouldn’t have eater dinner had I added the onion. I did, however, add onion powder in its place. Folks, it needs the real onions! If you have a hater then shred them, grind them, make onion water, do something, but add real onion.  The flavor just wasn’t where it needed to be without. For the pork, I had a pork tenderloin I needed to use so I ground that up. I left this in the pot for the full natural release, which took nearly  40 minutes.  Next time I would probably release after 10-15 minutes since it was a little on the dry side, which the gravy helped with.
