This recipe was delicious! I baked it for a family Christmas party, and everyone loved it! The taste of the rum was not overpowering and the cake was moist.

I made this cake for our family Christmas dinner party, and it didn't last the night. It's a very moist cake, and easy to make. I'll continue to make this recipe for years to come. A+++++++.

I have been using the recipe every thanksgiving and Christmas since 1980 something. I have to make four of them at a time, my husband coworkers request this every year as well as my coworkers, then I always have request from some that they would like it as a gift from myself. I just love this recipe.   Thanks for may years of full enjoyment.

This is one of my signature baked goods that everyone in the family requests even when it's not Christmas time.  I use Bacardi Select dark rum and add a splash or two of vanilla extract to the batter.  For even more rum flavor and potency, sometimes I replace the 1/2 cup cold water with rum.  But beware, it packs quite a punch!  The men in the family love the all rum version, of course.  It is best to make this cake a day ahead to allow the glaze to absorb and make it extra moist.  As another reviewer said, don't use a cheap rum as the flavor won't be optimal.  Bacardi is the best liquor for this recipe.

This is the best rum cake recipe!  I get asked for the recipe every time I make it.  Thank you.  Just a tip, it does make a difference when you use Barcardi Gold.  If you choose a rum that isn't as good quality, the flavor will be very strong and not as good.

I made this cake and its really easy to make. It was certainly a winner in my household. The cake was super moist, the only thing I recommend is to make sure you get the glaze on very quickly it has a tendency to harden fast once its removed from the heat.

I also have been making this cake for many years and get request for it every Holiday Season and like others stated only use Bacardy Gold for best taste. Some one stated the glaze set up to fast and hardens just put it back on burner and reheat, works every time.
