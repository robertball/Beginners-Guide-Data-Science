I make this liquor with vodka not rum, I also cut the water down to 3 cups.  After a couple of weeks it's taste rivals the name brand coffee liquor.

Great! Hard to believe it's homemade! The change I made was I used brown sugar as the molasses gives it a thicker texture and a nice taste. I also used vodka because I had no rum on hand and just to be safe I used 1 cup coffee granules to make sure that the taste of coffee will be noticed. Perfect! Will make again!!!

Don't know if you ever got an answer to your question...this will keep for years (but, it's so good it won't last that long) and it doesn't have to be kept refrigerated.  I've been making coffee liqueur for about 35 years; I use 4 cups of triple-strength brewed coffee and 4 cups of sugar.  I also use decaf coffee sometimes.

I used tequila instead of rum.  The first batch was a little too sweet for my tastes but everyone else loved it.  The second batch I only used 2 1/2 cups of sugar and it turned out perfect.

I have a question: I would like to use brewed coffee instead of instant coffee and I'm wondering which type of coffee gets better results.

I brew vanilla coffee, add 1 tablespoon vanilla extract and use only rum.  I have made this for 3 consecutive years and give it as gifts at Christmas.  Everyone loves it and asks for more.  One last tip...I start putting it together around Thanksgiving.  By gift giving time...it is really good! Joyce Ann, New Jersey
