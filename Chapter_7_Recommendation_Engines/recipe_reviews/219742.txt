I made this tonight but subsituted the chicken for hamburg (may sound odd, I know but it was what I had thawed) I only added olives and peppers  and beans to half the pan cause I have a 6 and a 8 year old who can be a bit picky. NO COMPLAINTS at all! the kids loved it and said they think they liked the hamburg better than they would chicken (i am not sure of this but who knows) recipe is gonna be made at the upcoming superbowl party!

I adjusted this recipe to reflect what I had on hand. I used homemade salsa, homemade TACO seasoning (instead of fajita seasoning), all black olives (we don't care for green olives), homemade pickled jalapeno rings instead of banana peppers and added more cheese. I did pre-bake/warm the tortilla chips a little longer for crispier chips. Great fun lunch idea for the husband and I. He joked around that I was "the best wife ever".

Was a good recipe but not great. Two changes I'd make if I ever make these nachos again: 1. Omit the fajita mix because it gave the chicken mixture an odd taste. 2. Be sure to use warm chicken. Had the nachos in the oven for 15 minutes and the some of the chicken mixture was still cold.

These were great!  The lime juice really brings out the flavors.

This was such a great recipe. Everyone loved it! The only thing I changed (and only because my husband likes very spicy) was I used jalape√±os instead of banana peppers! So good!

My family and I loved it! I also added 1/4 cup of cilantro and it gave it a niece touch!  Will definitely repeat.

Delicious! Instead of baking it over nachos, I just wrap it up in burritos and bake that.  Yum!
