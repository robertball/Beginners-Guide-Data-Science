Nice and moist, but . . . there's no salt or pepper in the recipe. I divided the recipe and put salt and pepper in one half and none in the other. The unsalted loaf was insipid at best - little to no flavor at all.

Thanks for the recipe!
I was on a mission to find a meatloaf recipe with almost exactly these ingredients - so happy the search is over and I have this one forever in my collection.  I change carrots for diced green pepper and leave out the parsley, final dish cooked absolutely perfect all the way through, flavor was enhanced by tomato garlic gravy - yum yum!  This was my 1st of what will be many Italian meatloaves!  Thanks again!

I always thought meatloaf had to be the shape and weight of a brick. This recipe is very moist and flavorful and easy to prepare. Please do not try to use a regular meatloaf pan, it's much too small and you will have to end up cutting your meatlaof down the center to finish cooking.

I used this recipe as a starting point for my meatloaf. I love the meatloaf they serve at BJ's Brewery so I altered this to resemble it. I use half angus hamburger meat, and half plain ground pork. I saute the onion and garlic, but add finely chopped red and green bell pepper, celery and carrot to it as well. I also substitute the breadcrumbs with panko breading (italian seasoned if you can find it). I also throw in a heaping handful of finely grated parmesian cheese to the mix. I add a little garlic powder, salt, pepper, and oregeno to the mix too. All of these make an amazing flavored meatloaf.

AWESOME! I had a little trouble cooking it through - I think I made it too thick, and after 30 minutes when it was still fairly raw I smushed it and then it cooked fine. I used Emeril's Kicked Up Tomato Sauce and added a few mushrooms, and used stuffing mix instead of fresh breadcrumbs (the kind in a bag, not a box). My husband tried it and the first thing he said was "You could serve this for company!" Thanks for the keeper recipe!

This was a great recipe.  It was very moist.  I did not fix the tomatoe with sugar sauce.  Instead, I added some tomatillo sauce, and it was absolutely wonderful!  Thanks for sharing it!

This meal was a huge hit with my family.  They loved how much flavor it had, and how it was not too dry like most meatloaves.

This was the best meatloaf I've ever had!!  My whole family devoured it, including the kids (and my kids are the super picky kind) !!!

My alterations:  I added one grated zuccini; and I shredded my carrot & zuccini VERY finely (so the kids wouldn't notice).  You never knew they were in there!  Also, I omited the parsley, added S&P, added onion powder, and added an extra 1/2 cup tomato sauce (1 cup total) to the loaf.  That was an "oops", but it all came out so good I wouldn't change a thing.  It took 45 minutes exactly to cook.

Sauce:  I added onion powder & S&P.

My husband and I had seconds, and we RARELY do that!!!

We didn't use as much bread as this recipe calls for but the dish was quite tasty - even my 13 year old daughter thought it was the best meatloaf she'd ever had.

I tried it once before and it didn't come out very well, but I saved it to try again.  The second time I made it, it came out great.  It was so great I wanted to have it for breakfast.

I tried cutting the recipe in half, since there are just 2 of us, and, as a result, it ended up being way too soggy. (I think I needed more bread crumbs.) Also, it took much longer to bake. 

I wasn't crazy about the flavor - I think it needs more garlic, or maybe some Italian seasoning. My husband, who's not crazy about spices, liked it though.

The meatloaf is so juicy and garlicy! 
I think next time I'll put brown sugar instead of granulated in the topping mix.

This tasted AWESOME!! I will use more bread next time so it holds together better. I had to cook it much longer than this recipe called for though. I used a "chunky garden vegetable" tomato sauce. Thanks for this dinner!

I make this all the time! Ground turkey is great to sub for beef in this recipe. I've never used the tomato sauce/sugar mix at the end, just served with ketchup on the side.

this was an easy to follow recipe and very tasty. it took an hour for me to prepare and cook but the recipe is worth the try. i like the ketchup accent, it gives its "sweetside" of this delicious meatloaf.

Let me preface this by saying that I am by no means a meatloaf connoisseur and that this was my first attempt at a meatloaf.  I did like this, but I have had others that I have liked better.  I feel like it could've had a little more flavor.  The ones that I've had in the past have used sliced and crumbled bread instead of bread crumbs, and I'm leaning toward that style a little more right now.

A good meatloaf recipe, however, I thought it was a little bland.  Next time I'd add more seasonings.  And, I found that it took closer to 1 1/2 hours to fully cook.

While I appreciate a new recipe to try, this meatloaf had an overly soft texture my family didn't particularly care for; I even tried baking for a longer period of time.  And, even though I used italian seasoned bread crumbs, we found the dish on the bland side. Sorry.

My family and I loved this. Meatloaf is so versatile that you can pretty much add anything and it will turn out. I tweaked this recipe just a little with what I had available in the cupboards and it turned out great, very moist and with a ton of flavor. I used 1.17lbs (just happened to be what was in the ground beef package I choose) instead of the full 2 lbs and mine was done in 35 minutes. We loved it!

My husband and I aren't really big meatloaf fans BUT WE LOVE THIS ONE.  It is soooo tastey and makes enough for sandwiches later.  I've emailed this recipe to everyone I know!  I won't even try another meatloaf recipe now.  THIS IS THE BEST!

I used hamburger/veal/pork mixture and half parsley/half cilantro....this meatloaf not only holds up well, it is so flavorful! As there are only two of us, I made two smalls one - and will freeze one for another day. Thanks for a nice, simple meatloaf recipe

I don't know why this got such good reviews.I've made other meatloaf recipes and this one wasn't any better really.It's edible but I sure wouldn't make a special trip to the store to make this.

I was intrigued by the title (my DH is Italian). Well, he said to give it two stars (even though it was very flavorful) because he couldn't imagine his mother or grandmother using ketchup on top of their meatloafs and calling it an "Italian-Style" meatloaf. Oh, well. Everyone, including my very picky SD, thought it was very tasty. We will make again...I will, however, find an alternative to the ketchup topping. :-)

I did not use ketchup I added tomato paste to the sauce.
