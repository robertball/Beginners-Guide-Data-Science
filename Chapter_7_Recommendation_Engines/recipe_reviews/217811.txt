I eat pad thai at least once a week so thought I should finally try making it at home - it turned out really well!  Would definitely make again.

This was quite alright, husband liked it a lot, I found it a bit too ketchupy but I guess being a Heinz recipe, that's the idea. I cut back on the sugar, it would have been too sweet for my taste. My advice is not to skip on the fish sauce and use coriander leaves instead of parsley.

This was terrific! Not exactly pad Thai but it definitely has that flavor. It's easy and so much less expensive than using jarred pad Thai sauce. We added chili garlic paste to spice it up a little, but other than that, made the recipe as written. Excellent!

I'm a REAL newbie at this cooking thing, but chose this recipe because it sounded interesting. The wife & I both loved it! Prepared it pretty much the way it says, but missed the part about using rice vemicelli & used ordinary vermicelli. Of course the kitchen looked like a bomb went off after I was done

Definitely not authentic with the ketchup added. The mixture of ketchup and lime didn't work too well -- doesn't even taste like pad thai. I will have to look for another pad thai recipe to try.

Amazing flavor! I used shredded chicken breast which added a great texture to the meal.

Not sure how authentic this is but it tastes great.  Could use a little more heat so next time I will try a hotter pepper sauce.

It was tasty, though a little sweeter than anticipated. May decreased the sugar or just replace the ketchup with a tomato paste next time.

Not bad, it was edible, but the ketchup is not good!  Definitely not Pad Thai

I made this recipe and could barely get it down. It smelled so strange and unappealing because of the fish sauce. It tasted nothing like pad thai I've had in restaurants and I will not make it again.

I really don't get a Pad Thai flavor from this.  Based on other reviews, I cut the ketchup by 1/3 - and it still overpowered the other flavors.  I will be seeking other Pad Thai recipes.

This pad thai was so easy and delicious. I added sugar snap peas but didn't change the recipe at all. I made it for friends and everyone loved it.

Just not the same as the real deal. I could taste the ketchup and not mech else. Kids wouldn’t even tried it because the kitchen smelled so bad! I guess that’s fish sauce for you!

I made this dish pretty much as listed.  The only difference is that we used pork. It was delicious. We will make again.

I've made this recipe many, many times!  It's a bit different based on what I have in the fridge or based on my mood, and it's always good.  Easy, easy!  One day I'll try a more complicated Thai recipe, but for now this always satisfies.
