We liked this a lot as we ate it alongside a bison taco.  It's a nice fresh companion to a variety of dishes.  The ingredients were proportioned spot on.  Thanks for this recipe!

Quick and easy!  I used red bell pepper instead of tomato.  Good side for when you don't know when your main dish will be ready to come out of the smoker...

This was excellent as an accompinement to an entree or on its own with chips. I had grape tomatoes instead, and I was low on corn so my ratio was off, nonetheless it was delicious!

So fresh and tasty. Makes a real pretty presentation for family and guests. I made crispy fried fish tacos, the perfect compliment. Some at it on top of the tacos and some ate in on the side.

This is one of the those recipes you never forget and everybody wants it.
