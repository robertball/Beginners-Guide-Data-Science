This was a big hit tonight! Husband gave it a 9/10. Great dish for those who want to eat more fish but don't really like "fishy taste"... when I make it again I will make a bit more of the pecan/coconut. and less of the salsa...I cut the mango salsa in half and still had a half cup left.  Might try using coconut oil in lieu of the butter.  Love butter, just not the cholesterol!

Super easy to make and tasty! I did this organic and with gluten free "rye" bread crumbs and added coconut flour with the shredded coconut+pecan crust.

Also added jicama and lemon juice in the mango salsa to make it more of a salad side dish.

I had butter leftover and happened to be drinking red wine ;)  so  added lemon and made a "buerre rouge" for dipping just for the heck of it. 

All in all a great meal for the whole family. My kids can't stand fish usually... I used cod and there were no complaints of a "fishy taste"--they finished it all!
Thanks for sharing, I will be sure to use and tweak this recipe again!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We are gluten free so we left the breadcrumbs out, with no complaint.  All in all it was quick, easy, and flavorful!

I've eaten walleye in about 1000 different ways. I'm a fisherman that's married so it's my job to cook the fare I bring home. This recipe was phenomenal! A great, healthy spin on cooking fish. Best part is its baked not fried so rather than stinking up the house with fish smell, this recipe spreads the aroma of coconut and peppers and cilantro.  Really great combination.

The fish with the coating is really good in and of itself. The salsa is delicious and the combo is really great together.

Definitely a keeper! Being low carb I left out the breadcrumbs and did not make the salsa. The only other modification was to use half butter and half coconut oil. I chopped the pecans in my mini chopper, then added the unsweetened coconut and chopped some more.
This has great flavor and mouth feel. As others have noted, it made the house smell good vs. fishy.

There are many layers of flavor with this fantastic pairing of ingredients.  The sweet heat and nuttiness with the fish and a sweet and mild tartness with the pineapple-mango salsa.  The only changes I made was I lightly seasoned the fish with cayenne and salt after I coated it in butter to ensure the heat gets in the dish.  I also used a harder, less ripe mango because there are already two different sweetened ingredients with the pineapple and coconut, I wanted to add a little mild tartness to this dish.   This dish was amazing!

Made it with perch.  Didn't have mango, so just used fresh pineapple.  Didn't have red pepper, so used green.  This was wonderful!

So easy, so simple, so yummy.  I paired with La Morera Black Slate 2012 - 91% Grenache Blanc, 9% Pedro Ximenez.  Perfect wine and food pairing.

Delicious! I omitted the green onion and used red onion instead. But would try green onion if I had some on hand. Even my 18-month-old loved this dish. Will make again!

The fish was fantastic, sweet and soft with a little crunch. Not too nutty, no coconut flavor, just a nice crust it needed. The salsa is good, but I would prefer it with chips over fish. I added a broccoli onion, celery rice with minced garlic and butter on the side which paired well with the fish. I would definitely remake the fish again, it is spot on. :) I used flounder fish found in aldi.

I made this tonight and it was awesome.  I used about 1.3 lbs of cod cut into 2 inch chunks.  All of the ingredients were the same... except I added squeeze of lime juice to salsa.  Served with Jasmine rice and roasted asparagus (olive oil, sea salt and a sprinkle of parmesan) that I put on the pan with fish.. it cooked same amount of time.

This dish was delicious! I prepared it as written and wonder if it would be equally good on other fish such as salmon.
Parchment paper worked well as I ran out of foil.

This was pretty delicious, though it was a bit spicy due to the cayenne pepper.  I did make some tweaks. It didn't say what kind of fresh or frozen fish fillet in the recipe--so I did mahi mahi, the only one I had. Maybe making it a bit specific unless it would work for any fish. I didn't use cilantro for the salsa, and used frozen mango chunks to dice instead of using a whole mango. I've used a little of the green pepper. I did have trouble with the coating, perhaps I didn't make enough. Part of it did stuck and the rest fell off.  The salsa was great. I might considering making it again.

This was awesome! I will be making the salsa on it’s own for future appetizers but was fantastic with the fish. Loved the nutty pecan/unsweetened coconut flavor with the fish. A tropical recipe!

AMAZINGLY delicious !  So easy to make, and can also be done with chicken breast instead of fish filets.  
BTW  the mango salsa is a real winner, but I added some chopped jalapeno peppers for a bit of kick ! (fresh or canned in oil).  The chopped red pepper can easily be subbed with diced tomatoes .  So yummy ... made I few times :-)

This is delicious! Left off the bread crumbs in the breading though. Salsa is excellent. A new favorite at my home.

This was excellent, as is.  Well, we're gluten free so I left out the breadcrumbs. but the proportions for everything are perfect.  The salsa is a keeper & I'll be looking for other meals to make that with as well.  My family is picky and didn't so much care for the coconut on the fish, but I loved it.  It really goes well with the salsa.

Loved this meal.  I could eat this everyday!  The flavors compliment each other perfectly.  You must make the salsa to go with this dish.
