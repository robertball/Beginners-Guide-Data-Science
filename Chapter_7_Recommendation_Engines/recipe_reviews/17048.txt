I am giving this sauce four stars because it gave me the basics that I needed to create a truly gourmet sauce.  Like previous reviewers I had to add much more quantity than called for.  I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter, 3/4 cup of dry white wine, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, 4 cloves of garlic and 1/3 cup of grated Asiago cheese (be sure to use the good cheese, I tried using the cheap stuff once and instead of melting it just congealed into a big ball in the sauce - this never happened with good quality Asiago).  I also add 1 tsp. each of dried basil and oregano. I also use mushrooms too.  If you like it spicy try using a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. This makes a decadent sauce that my brother says he dreams about.

Very bland unless you add 4 TBS butter, 1/4 cup wine, 4 cloves garlic, 1-2 TBS lemon juice and do NOT put the cheese in as you are making the sauce (I added about 1/4 cup cheese). Toss it with the pasta after or you will have a congealed messy blob. I prefer basil to parsley but both are good.

I tried this recipe tonight for dinner. EVERYONE LOVED IT! I did what others suggested and increased the sauce ingredients. (sauce ingredients x6)and 1 1/2 lbs. of linguine. Only complaint was they wanted more sauce to dip their bread in. This is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful. I also doubled the ingredients to make more sauce. But WOW, my shrimp were very flavourful and lovely. I used 6 cloves of garlic as well.

I would suggest that you don't use pre cooked shrimp. Cooking the shrimp in the sauce takes only minutes and the shrimp absorb the flavour much nicer this way. We also COVERED it with fresh parm! Make this recipe, you will enjoy it!

Update: I have cooked this over 10 times now. I still use tons of garlic. And now I add a bunch of cream to it as well. Yes, even more fattening. However, it is delicious this way. The cream helps hold together all of the ingredients so they don't just sink to the bottom. Yummy!

Love Red Lobster??  This is better than anything I've ever had at Red Lobster!!  
My husband took one bite and said, "Have you tasted this yet?"  I told him no,
and kind of looked at him, he exclaimed,"This is delicious!!".  My whole family 
loved it!!  Make sure that you triple the sauce amount when feeding more than 
two people.  (and make sure you grab the large bottle of white wine as it goes
great with this dinner!!)

I've used these ingredients for MANY years for my own scampi & have saved A LOT of $ NOT ordering it in restaurants, and mine's better!  I also add chopped fresh tomatoes to mine and prefer asiago or locatelli cheese to parmesan.

Yum, Yum, Yummy!  This recipe is a keeper. The only reason that it did not get five stars is because I had to tweak the sauce, but that was easy to do.  I liked it and so did my husband. Served with Ceaser salad and Cheddar cheese garlic biscuits.  Easy and quick to fix.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a bit dry.  After seeing how dry it would be, I made an extra batch of sauce. I quadrupled (4X) the butter, wine, and parmesan.  I only doubled the garlic.  Make sure that the wine is a good table wine.  The next time I make it, I won't put the parmesan in with the sauce.  Most of it stuck to the bottom.  We all enjoyed it very much after adding additional sauce.

My husband & I absolutely loved this dish!  I did have to triple the sauce so there would be enough to cover the pasta.  This is a perfect weeknight dinner, very quick & easy!  The presentation was wonderful as well.  This is a keeper, thanks Stacey for sharing!

I cooked this dish in my large All Clad stainless steel wok.  This is a good basic recipe, but in need of some adjustments to add flavor, variety and moisture.  For flavor, I did the following:  I added olive oil and crushed peppers to the hot wok and allowed both to cook for a minute or two.  Secondly, I added the minced garlic to the olive oil.  Also, like other reviewers did, I used 4 cloves of garlic.  Third, for the sauce, I added a small amount of lemon juice, a complement to seafood.  Finally, for the Italian component of this dish, I added fresh basil and oregano from my back garden.  For variety, I included some vegetables which were diced bell peppers, zucchini and mushrooms.  For moisture, I added a whole cup of white wine and half stick of butter.  The amount of butter and white wine in the recipe is not sufficient in my view.   The reason is the loss of moisture from evaporation during cooking and the absorption of  liquid into the pasta.  That’s why I am glad I added so much more butter and wine.  Further more, the sauce is quite tasty and you'll want to drizzle this sauce over the top of your dish.  I used farm raised shrimp from Michigan.  This shrimp is gaining popularity and is excellent tasting.

I added 4 Tablespoons of butter, as well as olive oil.  With the 5 cloves of garlic, I sauteed a diced shallot, and added a pinch of red pepper flakes.  With the 1/2 cup of wine, I added the juice of one lemon......a must for seafood!  I saved a bit of the pasta water to reheat the leftovers the next night, as there were only two of us.  The leftovers were just as good the next night!

There isn't nearly enough sauce for the amount of pasta cooked (1lb?!!)  I'm going to cut the pasta in half and double up on the sauce next time.  Otherwise it tasted okay, but my husband complained that there was too much garlic.

Like others I added more butter, wine and garlic and left out the cheese until later. Instead of cooking the shrimp in the sauce, I sauteed them quickly in garlic oil first ( not until done) and added them after the sauce was ready. I also added fresh basil and asiago cheese before serving. YUM!

EXCELENTE! 
As suggested by others, I used 1 stick butter, 1 small bottle white wine, 1/2 cup grated parmesan, 7 cloves garlic, 2 cans minced clams (undrained), a pinch of oregano and basil and 1/2 sliced lemon juice and topped with fresh chopped parsley and parmesan cheese.
My husband ate a lot and my kids loved it. 
Thank you for the recipe.

I'm really glad I read the reviews and modified the recipe when I made this.  As it is, I will still make more modifications next time. On this first attempt I used 2 TBSP butter and 2 TBSP olive oil, 5 cloves of garlic, the juice and zest of 1 large lemon, about 2/3-cup white wine, and about 1/2 bunch of chopped parsley.  This was enough sauce for about 12 oz. pasta. I cooked the linguini until it was nearly done, and then added it to the sauce/shrimp for the final 2 minutes so that the pasta absorbed some of the flavor of the sauce.  I didn't add parmesan until I served it, because the cheese will congeal if you add it with the lemon juice earlier.  For an entire pound of pasta, I would use 2 lemons and a whole cup of white wine.  It was tasty, but a little bland.  I think to spice it up next time I'll add extra lemon juice and a few sprinkles of crushed red pepper--I think a bit of a kick will be good with this.

This is a keeper, but needs some tweaking from what's written.  After reading reviews I immediately doubled the volume of the sauce recipe. I used 1/4 c reduced fat margerine, 6 large garlic cloves, 1/2 c white wine, 4 tbsp parsley, 1/4 tsp salt, and a couple pinches of pepper.  I tossed the grated parm in with the individual pasta servings before topping with shrimp & sauce, then topped with more parm.  I like how light the sauce is , but will experiment turning this into a cream sauce with fat free 1/2 & 1/2 in the future, too!

I made this for dinner tonight & it was great. I put 2 crushed garlic cloves in the pasta water while it cooked and the pasta absorbed that great garlic flavor (I made sure I took those garlic cloves out before tossing the pasta with the garlic butter sauce). I didn't have any parsley and used a little more cheese than called for. I also just tossed in pre-cooked colossal sized shrimp at the same time that I started to toss the pasta and garlic butter sauce. I'll be making this again. What a great, quick, and easy meal that tastes like you got it from a restaurant! Thanks Stacey!

This is good. Used 3 T butter and 3 T EVOO. More garlic and also added a couple green onions. Try mixing some bread crumbs or panko crumbs with parm cheese. Right when shrimp turn pink add crumb mixture on top and put under broiler until brown.

Read everyones comments and used 2 sticks of butter, 12 tbsp of white wine,6 tbsp of parmesean, 6 cloves of garlic and substituted parsley for 2 tsp of fresh basil so that there would be more sauce for the pasta. Worked out well. Also used garlic roasted fettucine and added asparagus. Nice and easy and also lite. Would make again. Also if you feel it's too bland I would add garlic salt instead of salt for salt lovers. Overall delicious meal.

As is in my opinion it deserves only 1star, mainly because far too little sauce for the amount of pasta. Modified it can be a 5 star recipe. It needs more butter, more wine, more garlic, lemon juice, and please no cheese when making the sauce. Fresh grated cheese at the end with sea salt & pepper to taste, topped off with fresh basil or parsley and this recipe is a winner. I also added a bit of olive oil to the butter when frying the shrimp. I made it with modifications and friends raved about it, said it was the best pasta they ever ate.

Very tasty and easy to make. The whole family loved it. We added some bacon and bacon grease, cayanne pepper and red pepper flakes. Like most others, we doubled the sauce. We will definately make it again.

We loved this pasta dish and it was very easy to prepare.  Like everyone else, we agree that you need to quadruple the amount of sauce.  It's very garlicky, but we love it that way!  We'll definitely make this again!

This is so good!  It tastes just like the shrimp linguine I order at a local Italian restaurant.  I too increased the sauce ingredients and it was perfect.  I will make this again, will try it with spinach that has been cooked in the wine sauce.  Thanks for sharing!!

I'm glad i read the reviews before i attempted this. 1 tablespoon of butter is definately not enough. i used 100grams of butter! 1/2 cup of white wine, 7 garlic cloves. I also added a chopped tomato and a tablespoon of capers towards the end. It was restaurant quality stuff. Very cheap and very easy also!

Excellent scampi, have to make more sauce though. The only changes I made, were to add olive oil to the sauce and a little Old Bay seasoning.

This was easy and delicious!  Even my picky teenage son like it.  My husband said this is excellent!  I only used 1/2 pound of pasta and 1 pound of shrimp and I had to triple all of the ingredients.

I just made this last night and my husband and I both loved it!  I added extra garlic (a must!) and sliced up some mushrooms and onions.

wonderful start but I did change it a bit like others.  added mushrooms, 1 1/2 stick butter, 1/3 cup wine, 6 garlic cloves, 1/2 lemon squeezed.  Left the cheese off until ready to serve as it was just a mess at the bottom of the pan.,  Instead of Linguine I tossed it in penne or ziti.  Made a sauce that my family loved.  Gave it to all my friends!  Thanks!

Very nice light dish.  I doubled the garlic (because I love it), but stuck to everything else.  Quick dish to make on a busy night.

Great!  Only gave it 4 stars because I added some things.  Doubled the sauce, added broccoli and mushrooms as well as some red pepper flakes. I didn't have a problem with the cheese clumping up.    Will make again!

I quadrupled the butter and wine(as others had suggested) and was so glad I did!  There is no way the original amount called for would of been enough. I also added fresh cooked broccoli.  I felt this was overall pretty good, but was missing something.  Next time also I will reduce the amount of pasta several ounces or increase the amount of shrimp.  Not enough shrimp to go around.  I also put the parm on after it was all cooked because it always gets lumpy for me if I add it in.

I thought this recipe was extremely easy. I bought the white wine to make the sauce and ended up drinking the rest with this delicious meal.  A caesar salad is a great addition to this meal.  

On the downside though the sauce just wasn't enough for the amount of pasta.  I ended up, at least, doubling the sauce part of the recipe.  

On the upside the amount of garlic was just right.  My husband and I loved it and so did my two-year old.  My parents were equally impressed when I made it for them.

Delicious! I added 4 tbspns of butter, half a cup of white wine, and fresh (half a bunch, finely chopped) dill...it was excellent! In a separate pan, I fried up some white and yellow peppers and sun dried tomatoes with a pinch of salt, added them to the pasta. It was great. Shrimp and dill, by the way, make an excellent flavor combination!

This was very good with the following modifications: use 4 Tbsp butter, 1/4 cup wine, 1/2 tsp dried basil & parsley, and double the garlic. Also added broccoli. Yum!

I prefer to broil the shrimps in their shells, about 3 minutes a side if the oven is at optimal heat.  Marinate the shrimp for 10- 15 before broiling.  Top the pasta with the shrimp and any liquid remaining and sprinkle all over with shredded basil.

Not nearly enough sauce for the pasta. And it tasted mostly like wine. I ended up doubling the sauce, adding milk, red pepper flakes, and a lot of garlic before it tasted good.  I do think the addition of spinach at the end and celery with the shrimp is a nice way to include some vegetables.

I want to give this 5 stars because it was excellent, but will give it 4 because I had to make a couple small changes.  First of all, I halved the amount of pasta and I doubled everything else.  This recipe calls for WAY TOO LITTLE sauce for the amount of pasta it calls for.  I also added about 2tbs of lemon juice.  I mixed everything together in a bowl and when plated, topped with more fresh parsley and more freshly grated parmesean cheese.  EXTREMELY GOOD.

After carefully reading the reviews I too quadruple the butter, wine, and parmesan cheese.  And thank goodness I did.  I think the pasta soaked up a lot of the sauce because it was cooked to el dente. I used sauvignon blanc wine and it was perfect.  I also added asparagus and mushrooms.  I sliced it very think and sauteed it separately to remove any water.  I added the cooked asparagus and mushrooms when I finished cooking the shrimp in the wine sauce.  It was delicious!!! Thanks for the recipe.

A huge hit with my fam.  Even my 5 year old raved about this (she's practically a vegetarian and IMPOSSIBLE to cook for.)  My husband ate and ate and ate it...almost no leftovers!  Did make a few changes - took others' advice and doubled the sauce, added minced garlic to the boiling water for the linguine too.  Used Riesling for the white wine, a TON of garlic (7 cloves - no lie), a handful of fresh parsley and about a half cup of freshly grated parm.  Added 1/2 the parm to the linguine and tossed, the other half sprinkled on top after it was all together.  It was perfect.

This is wonderful.  Who needs Red Lobster when you have this recipe!  I pretty much followed the recipe bearing in mind previous comments regarding needing more sauce.  I increased the butter 3x and the same with the wine.  I increased the other ingredients, except the shrimp, 2x.  Wonderful...though, since I was serving a family of 5 I still need more sauce.  So will increase 1 more time in the same proportions that I used.  Even my picky 7 year old ate it. Served with garlic toast topped with cheddar cheese - melted.  Oh and I didn't have Linguine on hand so I used angel hair spaggetti.  Presentation was lovely.  A keeper for my family!

Great recipe! I didn't have fresh shrimp, only frozen so I thawed it by soaking in rounds of cold water and added after drying them off. I also sauteed the garlic in the butter before adding the wine and cheese. Delicious and easy - will definately make again!

Definitely not enough sauce as previous reviewers stated.  I tripled sauce and still found it quite bland.  I doubt I will make this again without a lot of modification.

I needed to pretty  much make the same changes as the previous posters. With only 2 of us to feed I made only 1/4# of pasta but the full amount of sauce listed and it was about right....so if making the full pound of pasta you would need 4x the sauce. I used a lot more parmesan.

I am giving this four stars because I had to 4x the recipe.  It does, however, have a wonderful flavor, is really simple to make, and makes the whole house smell amazing.  I used salad shrimp (really tiny shrimp already cooked) that  were on sale at the grocery store,  and they came out great.  If you use already cooked shrimp just put them in the rolling sauce for about one minute.

This recipe wasn't my favorite dish I've found on allrecipes... but my boyfriend loved it!  Different taste buds I suppose.  I added crimini mushrooms and broccoli to it which I am glad I did.  The sauce was a little bland in my opinion.  Probably because it is light and not a heavy alfredo sauce that I am used to, ha!  I guess when you sacrifice calories you sacrifice taste, there is no way around it.  Also, make sure to AT least double the sauce proportions.  I'm out!

Made this for dinner yesterday and my husband had three servings.  Took the advise of other ratings and made additional sauce and added mushrooms. Great recipe.  Will be making this often.

I use 7 cloves of garlic, 1 mini bottle of white wine 167ml, oregano, basil, stick of butter,lemon to taste, angel hair or vermacelli.  Make sure to cook the wine out of the sauce 15 minutes. The key to more sauce is adding 2 cans chopped clams including the juice and simmer a few minutes before lastly adding the shrimp til done. Cover with parm to taste after finishing pasta in sauce.  Got this recipe from a coworker, unbelieveable.

This was very yummy.  I used alot more butter to make extra sauce and it still wasn't enough.  If you aren't counting calories you should use 3/4 lb of butter. And extra garlic!

Very good recipe! 
But, yes, kind of dry. I doubled the butter, the wine, the cheese and garlic to make it a little bit richer. My boys loved it! Thanks for posting...

I doubled the wine and cheese in this and it was still kind of plain. I may try it again with shallots and possibly add some cream so it coats the noodles better.

This dish is Amazing! My family loved it! My daughter even said 'it tasted like a restaurant'. However, I also had to more than triple the ingredients for the sauce. I also used parsley AND basil, and about 2-3 TBSP. of fresh squeezed lemon juice. Even then it wasn't enough sauce so next time I will have to double the sauce. We really like shrimp too so I used more than 1 lb. This a new favorite,I will definitely make this again.

Great start, for my personal taste I use equal parts Smart Balance and Olive Oil (light tasting). I also add mushrooms and onions to the sauce and right before serving I add one small can of diced tomatoes to the sauce.

Excellent recipe.  I accidentally ended up using Romano cheese which was a smash!  Added some EV olive oil to create more sauce and taste to our liking.  Thank you for the post

Delicious.  I did quadriple the wet ingredients as it would have been a bit dry.  I doubled the garlic & I added chopped asparagus, spring onion, chicken broth, a squeeze of lemon & grape tomatoes (halved) to the recipe.  It was served it with garlic toast, salad & a glass of pinot grigio. Everyone loved it.

This is good!  Used less noodles, tripled the sauce, my wine was dry so I added a packet of splenda to the sauce.  The sauce reduces quickly, so have your noodles close to done before making the sauce and cooking the shrimp.

I really liked this dish, but I am giving it 4* because I think some modifications make it much better. I doubled the sauce for only 1/2 lb of pasta, and it was barely enough. Also, I added some crushed red pepper as this livens up the dish a bit. But, it was quite tasty, and a great base for your own creation.

Agree with other reviewers to increase the sauce ingredients and add some crushed red pepper.  Yum!  Believe it or not, grated Parm from a can blends a lot better than fresh cheese - no clumping.

This one's a winner!  I would have given it 5 stars but the recipe for the sauce is all wrong, in regards to the amounts of each ingredient.  I put 3 times the amount of butter and white wine, and 5 garlic cloves and also added tomatoes, which gave the sauce more texture.  All in all, a very easy and quick dinner idea.

Great!  To make this a complete meal & more colorful, we sauteed-in some asparagus tips, red bell-pepper strips, scallions + a little olive oil, lime juice, ginger & soy sauce.

What did I do wrong?  With all of these wonderful reviews, I can't believe how disappointed I was.  Maybe I did something wrong.  I even ran out and bought the white wine.  It wasn't enough sauce, even with doubling the recipe per previous reviews.  I will try this again, but next time I'll make a few changes.

I have to laugh when someone gives a recipe a 5 and then proceeds  to list all of the changes they made to it!! If you have to change it so much, don’t give it a 5!!  I usually always read the reviews before I make something but totally forgot this time, but it was pretty clear it needed more wine, more butter, some olive oil, etc.  for the amount of pasta and shrimp listed. Wish I had read reviews and added way more. Therefore, recipe as is is not a five, too dry. I hope one of the cooks who made major changes posts a new recipe!!

I totally agree on increasing the base sauce for this recipe. I have even frozen the base for a really quick meal on the nights when traffic and work has me all stressed out. The base freezes well in ice cube trays and just pop out what you need, then reheat and toss in the shrimp to finish.

Tasty and easy to make!  However, the portions are way off.  After one failed attempt, I quadrupled the sauce and made 1/4 the required pasta.  It's about equal that way, but only made three servings.

I followed reviewers advice.  1 stick butter, 1/2 c white wine, 6 cloves garlic, 2 T lemon juice, large handful of Italian parsley, added mushrooms, green onion and some 1/2 & 1/2.  I also simmered for more like 15 minutes instead of 3-5.  Added the shrimp last 3 minutes.  Overall it was fantastic!

Loved it!  I've tried other white wine-butter-garlic recipes in the past and failed miserably.  This one is so easy.  I feed a family of 5.  We need a little more than a pound of pasta.  I think multiplying the recipe x 4 is great for a pound, maybe even x5.  I briefly sautéed the shrimp and some broccoli in butter n garlic prior to adding them.  I forgot the lemon juice...Grrr...but will definitely add that next time.  I wondered if capers may add another dimension or even artichoke hearts???  This is a keeper!!

I like the basic recipe. I add fresh dice tomatoes, slice mushroom, and crush pepper.  I make it often and share with my neighbor! We love this recipe!

I gave this 4 stars because I changed the recipe. I never write reviews but this was so good i had to write about it.
I did 2 tbsp of butter with a splash of olive oil to prevent the butter from burning. I added 1 cup of  crushed frozen purple and green basil, 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes and 6 cloves of garlic minced. Instead of a couple of tablespoons of white wine, i used an entire bottle of white cooking wine (2 cups), i let it boil, then I simmered it on low heat. I added parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, crushed red peppers, then shrimp and pasta. It was a total hit.

The amount of sauce was horribly insufficient, even after using half the amount of pasta. It didn't have much flavor at all. Really dull meal despite having some potential. If making again, I'd absolutely follow suit from the top rated reviews as far as measurements go.

This recipe is a hit every time. It's the foundation recipe for lots of variations. If you want more sauce pasta, you need to adjust the liquid amounts.  Also, I did half butter/ half olive oil.  It's fast and easy.. and delicious.

Only 4 stars because the ingredients really should be quadrupled (x4). That is what I did with 8 garlic cloves, fresh basil (1/2 cup), and red pepper flakes. Ingredients are wonderful together and will make again.

I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday for my family.  Even following the recommendations from some of the other members, I found the recipe lacked something.  I found it pretty bland but with a few experiments I'm sure I could use it as a base recipe.

Soooo good, and easy!  Definitely a keeper.  My family gets tired of the same old traditional pasta recipes.  This was a refreshing change, and an excellent solution if your craving some seafood but don't want to spend a small fortune at a restaurant.  Tastes like restaurant quality dish, and comes together so easily.

I doubled the sauce and the shrimp, but there still was not enough sauce.  I will quadruple it next time.  Very tasty with a little lemon added to it.  I also saved the parmesan until the very end.

Very easy and sooooo tastey.  I read other reviews and tripled the recipe for the sauce as suggested. I was glad I did because there would not have been enough as the pasta seems to absorb alot of the juice.  It was very good.  Will definitely make again.  The fresh parsley really made the dish!

So when I decided to cook this recipe I didn't have all the ingredients but I just had to give it a try with what I had on hand. and what do you know. My shortcut version was so good!!! I used italian seasoning instead of fresh parsley, no white wine, added in some diced chicken breast, 4x the butter and wheat pasta. Yummo!

This was very good, and easy.  I made the sauce ahead of time and once my guests arrived i reheated the sauce and cooked shrimp and pasta... quick and delicious.  I added fresh spinach to the cooked pasta to make it more nutricious and delicious!  We all love spinach!

My hubby has never given anything 5 stars, but this he did.  I agree with past suggestions to add extra butter (I used real butter, not margarine), add the cheese when you serve, and the pepper flakes and basil and oregano were fabulous!  You can kick this up as much as you want.  We used shrimp, calamari and scallops.  SUPER YUM.  Thanks for sharing!

THIS IS A GOOD BASIC RECIPE.   I USE FETA RATHER THANK PARMESAN AND FRESH CILANTRO IN PLACE OF THE PARSLEY.  THE SHRIMP COOKS WHILE THE LINGUINE COOKS SO IT'S A QUICK MEAL AND SOOOOO DELICIOUS.  "TRY IT YOU'LL LIKE IT"

The only reason I wouldnt' give this 5 stars is because you definitely have to tweak this by tripling the sauce.  Double is good but triple is great.  Serve with a grating of parmesan regiano and freshly ground black pepper.  Outstanding.

When I first tried this recipe, I didn't use wine and I did what the other reviewers said and added the grated parmesan at the end. This recipe taste just like the shrimp pasta that Red Lobster serves. I love it.

Good recipe but like some others had to increase the amount of butter and wine to make enough sauce for all the pasta.  I also used 6 cloves of garlic (we love garlic).

Delicious and simple.  My modifications:   3/4 lb linguine,  1 stick unsalted butter, plus 2 T. herb butter,  1 red pepper, sliced thinly; 8 oz sliced mushrooms; 5 - 7 cloves garlic, minced; 3/4 c. white wine; 3/4 c. grated parmesan cheese.  while cooking linguine, saute mushrooms, red pepper and garlic in butter.  Add wine, add shrimp, saute about 4 minutes.  Remove from heat, add parmesan.    I didn't add lemon juice to this though I considered it. One post said not to add lemon juice until the very end because it can toughen the shrimp.

This was good, quick, and easy to make. I made the mistake of mixing in fresh grated parm cheese when I mixed sauce with pasta and it clumped up into a ball. I multiplied the sauce ingrediants by 6 because I have to have all of my pasta covered with it. Next time I will put the parm on after I have plated the pasta. I will make again for sure!

This was fantastic! I use it often and wish I could have given it more than five stars! Based on other reviews, I increased the ingredients as follows: 4T butter, 12 T white wine, 82 grated Asiago Cheese (much better flavor than Parmesan) and 12 minced garlic cloves. Everything else remained the same. This is a keeper.

I didn't like this dish at all. I wish I would have read the reviews before I started making it. The dish was very bland and I added more ingrediants that I read from the reviews but that just made it worse.  I had to throw away my food.  Will not be making this dish again.

The sauce gave the shrimp a great flavor, but I agree that it skimps on the sauce.  Next time I will add some cornstarch to thicken it and add broccoli and tomatoes to get some veggies in it.  Better than any restaraunt dish!

Very good! I mixed the sauce ingredients X 6. It was excellent but we wished the sauce was thicker. Had to keep mixing it in our bowls over & over to get the sauce on the linguine that was on top. Will make again!

Yum! This dish is just like the kind that my mom used to make. Didn't have linguine so I put the shrimp on a bed of rice instead. I also added some pea pods just to get some veggies in there. Took the advice of previous reviews and increased the amounts of white wine and butter so I would have enough sauce. I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe is OK, but needs more herb infusion!  If cooked word-for-word it is a little bland.  Add more fresh herbs to the shrimp such as basil or thyme and a little extra wine.

I loved this recipe although I did have a little trouble with the sauce. You almost have to quadruple it to get enough.  I used frozen precooked shrimp and threw them in towards the  end to heat them through. Other than that I stayed close to the recipe.

Pretty good.  It was tasty and easy and quick.  As others mentioned...you have to triple/quadruple the sauce ingredients.

This dish turned out absolutely great. I had to add a lot more butter, garlic, and about a half cup of wine. This made a fantastic sauce. What really zazzed it up was a whole tomato which I diced, and added right before serving.

You definitely have to triple or quadruple the sauce just for 2 people tho. Added some basil, otherwise by the recipe,except for the tripling part!

great recipe. Ageee with having to make atleast 4-5 times the butter/oil/wine combo. Linguine would be too dry without it.  Great taste and very elegant looking for company. Thanks Stacey!!

This was pretty good. I added frozen "California" veggies (cauliflower, broccoli and carrots) and I had to add a bit more liquid.....in retrospect I wish I had also used some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. My parmesan cheese (obviously not great quality) congealed into a big lump while cooking, so I removed that and added more cheese after I was done cooking. A really fast recipe! Very tasty, very easy. Will make again.

Like other people, I multiplied the sauce several times, but it still didn't taste like much, even with a bunch of garlic in it.  I definitely do not recommend it--not enough butter for scampi and way too much wine!

Light and lovely and even impressed my Mother who doesn't relate to pasta!  Delicious and easy to make and you can use pre-cooked shrimp that is just warmed and added at the last minute; the result is still wonderful.

When I read the recipe I knew that I needed to increase the sauce ingredients, so I did.  This was very tasty, and we all loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.  BTW, the author of this dish is a very accommodating host!  Drop-in (uninvited) guests don't get a 'gourmet-type' meal here!  Cheese & crackers w/a glass of wine, OR cake & coffee.  Sorry :-(

Some good stuff here!  It was a 5 after I tripled the sauce ingredients after reading the numerous reviews that advised tripling or quadrupling the sauce.  I did not add cream or thickeners--the garlic/white wine combo was good enough for us.  It soaked into the pasta raising its flavor up several notches.  I did use 1 pound of pasta as called for.  And I did add a carton of baby spinach as suggested by the editors to this page--the added green made it so pretty and supplied some extra nutition as well.  Wonderful presentation--restaurant quality!

I added a couple handfuls of spinach to the pot of pasta last minute of boiling, with a nice glass of Chardonnay(or two) :) Definitely would make it again

I used the zest of the full lemon in addition to the juice; I think this is key for amazing flavour. I also used 2 gigantic cloves of garlic (or use 4 regular sized cloves). The dish was outstanding!

This is a very good recipe. It takes about 15 minutes or less to make. I used frozen pre-cooked shrimp (thawed) and only had to warm them quickly in the sauce. I used minced garlic from a jar and shredded parmigiano  cheese from a jar. I only had dried parsley, so I used that.  I will make it again!

I didn´t have any Parmesan cheese, so I made a cheese sauce with plain cream cheese. 
No white wine was available, so I added some ginger wine instead.
I like my food to have a little heat, so I added a dash of cayenne pepper and a little paprika to change the color of the sauce

This was very dry. I should have known better because the ingredients seemed way off for a pound of shrimp.  Made according to this recipe it is barely edible. Only ate it because shrimp is expensive.

I added about twice as much butter, wine, Parmesan, and garlic as was called for for a 4 portion serving, added a diced and sauteed half an onion, and used basil instead of parsley. (In the future I need to remember to add the basil a little bit later.) I also only had tortellini, so that's what got used. All told, a solid base that was easy to riff on even the first time, and was quite satisfying.

Made this last evening using beautiful Argentinian Red shrimp. I tweaked it a bit as I found there was nowhere near enough sauce for a lb. of pasta. I added twice the garlic, a little more butter, extra parmesano, and white wine, a sprinkle of olive oil to the drained pasta, crushed red pepper flakes, and only about 2/3 lb. of the pasta (right into the pan with the shrimp), tossed it all together and served...it was DEELISH!!! A huge hit with my family and dinner guests. Served it with Italian bread for dipping and a big salad. I also had broccoli on the side, but in the future will try the broccoli in with the pasta. In the end this was simple, quick, and absolutely delicious without tons of butter!!! This one is a keeper! Thank you!!!

This is delicious but you definitely need to double the sauce amount.  I halved this recipe for me and my husband and I ended up doing twice as much butter/wine/ etc.  But very tasty!

It is ok but does lack some flavor. If I make again I will add seasonings to make the flavor pop and not be so bland.

This has long been a staple "go to" recipe with some adds.  Some zucchini and quartered tomatoes when there are some nice ones are great adds.

Used less shrimp, less pasta, and more white wine, butter (in my case blue bonnet) and garlic. No cheese. With tweaks, this recipe was awesome. I wasn't looking for a thick pasta sauce, and the shrimp was delicious.

This is the BEST Garlic Shrimp recipe I tasted.  Will always follow this recipe.  I did add more garlic because I Love garlic.  I didn't have white wine but I did have sweet vermouth (which is wine) so I used that.

Excellent recipe. I have so many recipes for garlic shrimp, shrimp scampi etc.. but this one was easy fast and very tasty.  
When you cook the sauce, it may dry up a little, so I added more butter and wine because I wanted extra liquid for the linguini.
I think next time I may add some chicken broth  or some olive oil to get more liquid.  You don't want to have dry pasta!  This is going into my favorites recipe book!

I made this with frozen precooked shrimp as I am too lazy to devein my own...  It was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, not only did my house smell heavenly but my family ate it up.  I used one serving spoonful of sauce from the shrimp to coat the linguine and all the flavors were awesome.  Quick, easy and painless meal!

This dish was so easy and so delicious.  I make it every year for Valentine's day and our anniversary.  I think it tastes much better than anything in a restaurant.  Our whole family can have a delicious meal for a fraction of the price of a fancy restaurant.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

DELIZIOSO!!  Like others I added more of everything than what the recipe calls for but lets give credit to the cook for posting this great recipe that allowed us to add additional ingredients to satisfy our tastebuds. THANK YOU!  I, too, like my food to be VERY flavorful so I made a lot of sauce (cup of wine, 2 sticks of butter, avocado oil, cream, a whole head of garlic, pepper flakes, oregano, thyme, a ton of basil, whole lemon, pepper, garlic powder, cherry tomatoes, and cheese) and "finished" cooking the pasta in the sauce for 5-7 minutes to absord the flavor.  Don't forget to remove the shrimp (used 2 lbs) during this process or it'll be overcooked.  It was a delicious dish but tasted even better the next day so make enough for leftovers.

Phenomenal! Eating as I type. Spot on flavors, had it with a little angel hair pasta. Only thing I did differently was I had 12oz bag of shrimp, so I cut back on white wine by 1 TBSP, and kept the other ingredients as typed in the recipe. Can't get much easier and is packed with flavor.

We both enjoyed this recipe.
I agree--as written there is not enough sauce.
I tripled the sauce (but used no where near a pound of pasta for two), which was probably too much. Next time, I'll double, and linguine for two.
Following other suggestions, I added broccoli, and my own favorite, sliced mushrooms. Was going to add diced tomatoes, but they seemed too juicy for the recipe. Maybe next time, or perhaps sundried.

I made this recipe, and did not care for the sauce, it was too thin and runny, When I refrigerated left-overs, the dish tipped, and I had sauce all over.  Would like a creamyier sauce. I did not tweak the recipe

Don't try gourmet stuff often but tried this. Took advice from reviews and changed quantities...5 Tbs Butter; Cup of Wine; added some lemon juice, EV Olive oil, 2 oz milk, used 2/3 of linguine pkg, 12 oz shrimp (can you buy a  16oz pkg anywhere anymore?) added Cheese at end, and some spices. Tasted great, but it's all about getting the sauce the right consistency. Takes practice and be careful, if Parm cheese melts much it adheres to spoons forever I think. Maybe Asiago is the answer.

Four stars for giving me a good idea and the basic recipe but I also changed it to give it more flavor and more sauce to go with all that pasta. Added more butter (just shy of a full stick)  and some olive oil (  abt 3 tablespoons). Used 1/4 cup of white wine. Also added 1 teaspoon basil and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. And lastly about a 1/2 cup of light cream. It turned out so wonderful the Olive Garden couldn't have done better. It did remind me of something I'd had there.

My kids are really picky.  Recently I have been trying to put some more real food into their diet (something other than chili or pasta with sauce).  My kids loved it!  We had raw veggies on the side (my kids don't like salad).  I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the sauce, switched to finely grated asigio cheese, and tossed the cheese with the pasta after I added the sauce and shrimp.  We coarsely grated more cheese as a garnish.  Yummy!  Next time I think I will toss some baby spinach in with the pasta. This has been added to the list of meals my kids enjoy.  Great recipe!

I've cooked this for years. My only change is during the final 3-5 minutes of cooking the pasta I add broccoli florettes to the water.
It adds color and really is delicious.

I increased the amount of ingredients to make the sauce and there was still way too much pasta left over. Other than that, this was a very tasty dish!

I just tried this recipe, I did have to alter it up a bit.  I did as suggested and tripled the sauce, used Chardonnay (only thing I had around) and used dry parsley flakes, added the juice from half a lemon.  OMG!  Even my picky husband went back for thirds!  Thank you for this great recipe.  Think I'll try it with clams next time.

I give this recipe 4 stars only because as is it does not produce enough sauce. Throughout the process I was adding more butter and more wine. The shrimp tasted delicious but to actually use this as a sauce for 1 pound of pasta you need 3-4 times the amount of sauce. I will make this again with more of everything except the shrimp and pasta.

Not enough sauce unless you take the advice of one of the other commenters really need 5 Tablespoons of butter a 1/4 cup of wine 5 garlic cloves and 1.5 tablespoons of lemon juice. And you have to use real parmesan cheese not the cheap stuff in the can. But it is a good base

Would need more sauce next time, but this time we didn't make the linguine.
Used olive oil and butter instead of white wine as I had none on hand and added oregano and red pepper flakes to the parsley. I also sprinkled the parmesan at the end instead of frying with it.
It came out great and won over someone who normally won't eat shrimp.
Super simple.

3/25/2013 This was very good! My husband said "it's delicious" and went for seconds. After reading the reviews, I tweaked it.  I used 5 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons olive oil, about 1/4 cup of chopped onion that I had left over from the day before, juice of 1/2 lemon, 5 cloves of garlic and used about 1/4 cup of wine (for extra sauce). I only made 1/2 of the pasta since dinner was for two of us (for us that is about 4 servings). My grocer sells raw, peeled deveined shrimp in 10 oz bags, so I only used 10 oz shrimp. Added pinch of red pepper flakes.  I also added the Parmesan (shaved) after plating. I served with plain garlic toast, but will buy good french bread to go with this next time - the recipe deserves it.
11/14/2015  Made as in my previous post except I used a whole pound of Shrimp this time. Sauteed 1/2 cup chopped onion and 1/4 cup of chopped green bell pepper, added a can of undrained minced clams and upped the wine to about 1/2 cup.  Added grated Parmesan and fresh parsley after plating. Served with sliced French baggette.  Only cooked half pound of  pasta - equals 4 servings for my husband and I.   It was better than the first time! Plenty of sauce for extra bread dipping.

Made this dish last night and we LOVED it.  Instead of linguine, I used Orzo. Used 3/4 cup chardonnay, fresh basil (no parsley), 1 pint grape tomatoes, 6 cloves garlic, 4 tbs butter, and didn't add the parm until the end (sprinkled over the plated dish, along with some additional fresh basil).  Can't wait to eat the leftovers today!

I made this linguine with no shrimp as a side dish. I was using fresh parm that I grated myself. If you're doing this, it does clump up when mixing the sauce. Still, it came out amazing and tasted wonderful!

Got home from work...found this recipe...made this and a salad and warmed some bread...opened a bottle of wine...and in under 30 min dinner was on the table!  On top of that my fiance loved it.  It is really really good and will make this at least once a week.  Perfect way to treat yourself to a good meal on busy Monday.

I got home to five starving kids and a very hungry husband at 6 PM today (after a full afternoon of Memorial Day shopping!).  I had thawed a bag of shrimp on the counter thinking we would have it with dinner.  I looked up "Shrimp Pasta" on allrecipes.com.  I have to say that this recipe was so simple to put together, so quick and SO SUCCESSFUL!  Everyone loved it.  My toddlers even asked for seconds. My husband I had seconds too!  I will definitely be adding this to my recipe box!

This was awesome.  I followed some of the variations by using 1 stick of butter (used SmartBalance so it wasn't as unhealthy) and about 1/2 cup of white cooking wine.  I also used whole grain pasta.  I tossed everything together at the end and it was awesome.  I made some garlic flatbread on the side....

I can't wait to go home and have it for leftover dinner.

This was really good! I only gave it 4 stars due to the inaccuracy of the quantities. Their is no way that sauce would have been enough for 8 people. I tripled the sauce ingredients and it made enough for 3 people. I used ramano cheese as wells as parmesan and didn't have any issues with it clumping. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good and very easy to make. Like one of the other reviewers said, this could pass for a dish at the Olive Garden (which I love).  HOWEVER, I had to triple the ingredients.  And as for the garlic, I would say quadruple it.  I used 8 cloves and still didn't seem enough (couldn't really taste it).  

I didn't put the parmesan cheese in the pan mixed with the butter, garlic and wine.  I tried with the first batch of shrimp and it got clumpy.  So I just sprinkled it on the pasta as soon as I drained it and was still really hot so the cheese melted evenly.

Will make this again and again.

Easy recipe, but as everyone else stated, definitely double or triple the sauce to your liking.  The recipe as is does not make enough.

This was okay, but could have used more sauce.  The linguine ended up being kind of blah, even though I added some butter to it before adding the shrimp and sauce.

Tripled the sauce.  Next time I'll thicken it as well.  Needed a little something - kind of bland.

This has become one of our favorite dishes.  I've modified the recipe based on others' suggestions, most notably not adding the cheese to the sauce.  What we do is combine all other ingredients per the recipe and then sprinkle the cheese over top.  It is delicious!

Very good but reading I realized that I needed to make more sauce. I yards little of pasta water to my sauce to help coat all pasta   A little flour to butter would make ir mire Alfredo like with milk instead of wine. Tried both and both great

Very tasty dish.  We made it as is but I think next time I would make more sauce as I found it did not have enough.

it wasn't sauce...it was just noodle flavoring.  While the flavors were alright, I would have liked something a little more.  Basically just shrimp with noodles and a hint of garlic and butter

This recipe was a hit with the whole family. I'm glad I read the reviews before serving it though. I added the extra cheese, garlic, white wine, and some lemon juice for added flavor. Next time I will even double it. I had way too many noodles leftover when the shrimp and sauce were long gone.

I was excited for this after reading other reviews, one even said it's better than anything at red lobster but I would much rather go to red lobster! It wasn't bad it just wasn't really good either ..like others said, you do have to triple or more the recipe for enough liquid to cover the noodles. I thought there was way too much garlic and I had to pile on the parmesan cheese to get through it ..might have been better with some lemon juice but I don't think I'll be making this again.

I gave this recipe five out of five stars because I did not follow the recipe exactly as to not lower the recipes rating. I really think it is unfair to a recipe when people change the recipe up and then say it was an okay or terrible recipe. My changes were basic substitutions, since I don't cook with alcohol I had to use chicken broth instead and since I did not have parsley I subbed dried tarragon instead and I also followed the other suggestions and tripled the sauce. Well with that it was good and I do plan to make again.

This recipe was awesome, however I did what most of you probably had to do and that is add 3-6x more of the ingredients for the sauce if your feeding 3 or more people.  One thing I did add with the butter is 2tbsp of olive oil.

This is a 5 star. We made this out on the houseboat last weekend. This dish is the bomb! We did use the extra butter and the basil. You have to try this dish, you will not be disappointed. Thanks STACEYO  ;)

Great as a base - I felt something was missing so I used garlic herb butter in the sauce and added some red onions, chopped mushrooms and sweet peppers to the shrimp. That was it!

I should have noticed that the amount of liquid ingredients could not possibly create a sauce. But I am a fairly recent cook and didn't notice till the shrimp were cooked and there was no sauce left for the linguine. I had to make a white sauce and add parmesan to it in the next night for the leftovers (which were considerable, considering) and that made it a much tastier dish.

This recipe is absolutely foolproof and delicious!!!  The only change I made was that I doubled the amount of the sauce, since we prefer our pasta to be a bit more moist.  When making the original recipe, I realized it wouldn't be enough sauce, so I doubled it mid-stream.  My husband just loved it and its one of those recipes that is quick and easy and great for company.  They'll think you slaved over the stove for hours!!  THANKS....this is a keeper!

I doubled the ingredients for the sauce, and substituted vegetable broth for the white wine.  A few shakes of Old Bay seasoning takes away the blandness of this recipe.  Good all-around seafood pasta dish!

I cooked this dish for two this Valentine's Day- the serving size for this recipe is so small that I had to tweak it a lot. I ended up using some milk, a whole stick of butter, and much more wine than suggested by the page. The parsley went absolutely fabulous with this dish, and in the end my date and I both loved it! I highly recommend this dish, but only if you have some experience/confidence to do some mixing and re-creating this recipe.

This was very easy!  I read other recommendations, so substituted basil for the parsley, and I cut up some artichoke hearts and put it in when the shrimp was about halfway done.  I did not add any parmesan, instead I added feta, which gave it a great twist.

This is a delicious simple recipe that I have made several times! I love how easy it is and tasty that it turns out. A squeeze of lemon at the end makes it that much better...yum!

FANTASTIC! A huge hit at home, especially after a tough workout. Yummy carbs. I also had to add a little more to the sauce, and I roasted the garlic beforehand to soften it more, but this is a five-star recipe.   Thank you so much for posting this!

Great taste, but I have to agree with most others: there is NOT enough sauce. I only used 1/2 a lb of pasta and I doubled the sauce (except for the garlic), and there was just barely enough.

Used half stick of butter, 1/3 c wine, 1tsp basil and oregano, and 1/4 lemon squeezed, 6 cloves of garlic and 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 cups of sliced mushrooms.  Sprinkled the cheese on each serving instead of mixing it in the sauce.  Really great!!

I added a bit more butter and lemon juice as other reviewers suggested, and it came out pretty well. The sauce was a bit runny, although I didn't add cheese until after plating.

I thought this was outstanding! Be careful not to overcook the shrimp and I recommend doubling the sauce for a pound of pasta. My husband thought it was one of the best shrimp dishes he has ever tasted.

Very, very good!  Increase butter to 1 stick, increase wine to 1/2 - 3/4 cup, increase garlic to 4 cloves, add tomatos & mushrooms & a dash of light olive oil before tossing with pasta - and then wait until serving to add the parm cheese.

This recipe is delicious and has become a regular meal in my home. Everyone loves it. As far as adding additional amounts and/or ingredients to the recipe, I've followed the directions precisely and I've altered it as suggested by other users. I have to say, it comes out great either way. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Husband and six-year-old are asking for this one again.  This recipe is simply good--not over the top with a lot of sauce or strong flavors.  Very good and I would not hesitate to make this for company.

just had this for dinner and it went REALLY REALLY well! only added a bit of cheese at the end, but make sure to at LEAST quadruple the sauce, or else there won't be nearly enough (becomes evident pretty quickly). Also added a bit of lemon, next time i will throw in some 1/2and1/2 to thicken the sauce. definitely a keeper, thanks for submitting!

My daughter and I just had this for dinner tonight and we made it for 2 servings. We took the advice of everyone and doubled the sauce. This pasta dish was just excellent. Instead of using the Parm, we used Asiago cheese instead because we did not have enough Parm cheese. I am not much of a shrimp eater, but I love everything about this dish. I did not miss the cream that is usually used to make this type of pasta. I would definitely recommend this to all of those who visit this site. Just remember, you can adjust any of these recipes to your liking.  
Enjoy!!!!

My husband and I loved this!  It will be a weekly meal here.  I used frozen cooked shrimp - just took a handful out of the bag.  So one 2 lb bag of shrimp will make at least 4 or 5 dinners for us.  I did triple the sauce as other posters suggested.  Definitely a good idea.  I also used dried parsley, as it was what I had on hand.  Will try to use fresh from now on, I think it would be delish. Seriously, this recipe is so fast...like 15 minutes tops.

I have made this dish twice now.  Delicious! It is a little dry so I did end up making extra sauce.  Also adding half and half to the sauce made it go further and makes it more flavorful.  Overall, excellent dish.

This dish was easy, and tasted fantastic. I tripled the sauce amount, and lightened it up by using 50% reduced fat butter and reduced fat parmesean cheese. It still tasted incredible!!

Fairly easy and hits the spot! I've tried this twice now, and the recipe is simple enough to eyeball the sauce ingredients and make adjustments to suit the amount of pasta you're using. I added frozen peas and carrots and a bit of fresh tomato, and used thin spaghetti and less butter to try and make it a bit more healthy. I am sure this affected the flavor a bit.

Very simple and delicious, just what I was looking for. I used 1/2 a cup of wine and about 5 tablespoons of cheese. Left the spices as they were and it all evened out. Loved it, thanks!

This recipe was very easy to make and was so good.  Fresh pasta is a must versus boxed.  On top of the minced garlic I added some crushed garlic cloves as well.

I made it for the first time and it's a good thing I read the reviews before I started cuz it definately would have been a dry sauce had I not tripled and quadrupled the amount of ingredients.  To make it a little more saucy I added a little bit of olive oil in with the butter.  Hope this helps!

Outstanding!  I did portions and measurements to my own taste buds and the dish came out great. I bought pre-cooked shrimp to save time.  I just simmered the sauce seperately then  tossed in the shrimp and served.

I wish I would have read the comments before making the dish. I found myself adding more of everything because the sauce started to disappear. Once it was done, it turned out great.

i thought it was pretty good... but i'm only giving it 4 stars because my family didn't seem to like it all that much until i made my revisions. after making it i realize it needs more seasonings. it's quite bland. and yes i agree on others about tripling or quadrupling the amount of sauce. plus for a family of 4....2 kids under 6...i found the noodles too much. next time i'll still triple or quadruple the sauce BUT use alot less noodles than recipe suggested. to make it taste the way we wanted...i aded ALOT of McCormick California style Garlic Salt with parsley. that bottle is awesome for this. oh and i added a bunch of shredded mozzarella on top. w/ my revisions i thought it was 5 stars!

My wife and I loved it, but the kids didn't (unusual because they generally love shrimp dishes).

This recipe is an easy and delicious way to prepare a shrimp and pasta dish that is sure to impress.  I followed the advice given by OD3 in regards to the sauce...I didn't have Asiago cheese, so I sprinkled an Italian cheese blend on the finished product, which worked beautifully.  My boyfriend loved the dish and said it was something that he could eat every week!  I'm sure I will have requests to make this again soon!  Thanks to OD3!

I tried this recipe when I cooked for friends and received raves. I did modify a little by thickening the sauce by adding cornstarch. I loved the garlic (even added a little extra).

I did not have wine on hand & was in a spur of the moment mood used chick broth. I used Prosciutto instead of shrimp. I too made 6X the sauce by adding a squeeze of lemon juice, fresh basil 6 clvs of garlic and blk pepper. The family loved it! i will try shrimp next time.

Excellent, though, I do not care for shrimp.  I added a variety of mushrooms, in mine, and shrimp in my husbands.  He actually LOVED it and told me he felt like he was eating at a five star restaurant.  Great recipe, I would definitely make it again!

I made this for my husband because he loves seafood but I don't.  He said it was ok.  I only made 1/2 a pound of pasta and I tripled the amount of sauce and it still barely covered the pasta.  I probably won't make this again.

I, like a few other cooks, made the sauce 6 times larger than what was called for and we found it simply delicious.  Will make it again for sure.

We really liked this recipe. It was just delicious.  We will definitely make it again, with a couple of modifications.  We found that there was not enough sauce to coat the pasta.  I used fresh linguine, which got sticky, so in the future, I would double the sauce and reserve some to the side to toss with the pasta before putting the shrimp on top.  My husband thought it needed more shrimp for the amount of pasta served, so I would increase the shrimp to 1 1/2 pounds.  Finally, I would serve with additional chopped parsley (guests could add their own) and grated cheese.

Don’t know how anyone could give this a 5-Star as written. Almost everyone giving it 4-Star and above  ratings describes their modifications to make it work. As written it’s essentially eating cooked noodles with dry scrimp scampi mixed in.

Very good.  I added spinach and made much more of the sauce as suggested by other reviewers.  Tossed the pasta in with the shrimp/garlic mixture for a few minutes to enhance the flavors.

I followed all the  comments and doubled the sauce (butter, wine, parm) and added 1 TBS of olive oil. I also added 1/2 pound mushrooms, a handful of cherry tomato halves, and about 3 oz fresh spinach. Seems like pretty much anything could be added for extra flavor, color, and nutrition. Like someone else said, a good starter recipe.  Have fun and be creative!

I made it and doubled the butter garlic sauce and did as the video said, mixing the linguine back into the butter, garlic and Shrimp pan to warm the linguini and it was very dry.
Next time I will mix the pasta with extra virgin olive oil and make triple the sauce and leave it on the side to spoon over as it’s plated.  I think I will also add some cherry tomatoes for a little added flavor.

This was such a quick and easy meal to make. I am by no means a great cook but this dish made me feel like I was. I didn't have garlic so I had to use garlic salt and garlic powder but still very tasty.

It was delicious I added a little more to the recipes I added more wine and extra shrimp. It was delicious and my friends loved it. It is definitely a do-over.

Yummy!! Hubby just said “don’t loose this recipe”. This one is so easy to prepare. I omitted the linguine so there was only one pot! We like to have extra sauce for dipping so I amped up the butter, Parmesan and wine and added a little olive oil to begin with and a dusting of seasoned bread crumbs and a squeeze of lemon to finish it. Along with thick slices of Ciabbata bread( it stays fresh much longer than a French loaf) and a side of Asian slaw and of course it included a glass of white wine. The entire meal for two was less than an entree at a local restaurant would have been. Medium shrimp was on sale for $9.99 a lb,  (28-30 per lb), everything else was in the pantry, wine was bogo, so was the slaw and there are leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Living on the Gulf Coast we enjoy a lot of seafood and this was a real winner!!

Wow!  What a great sauce, after adjusting the quantities on all ingredients as recommended by others, this turned out amazing!  I also added fresh spinach to the sauce at the end just after turning the shrimp.

This is a great recipe! I have made it a couple of times and tweaked it just slightly for my family. I doubled the butter and added 2 Tbsp of olive oil, used a half cup of white wine, approximately 4 tsp of parmesan cheese, 6 cloves of garlic to make it more about the garlic than the cheese. After I cooked the shrimp, I added the pasta to the pan and mixed well.  Here I increased the fresh parsley to about a quarter cup and tossed everything together and served. Next time I will add some veggies, maybe mushrooms or snow peas.

Works great both on its own and as a base with other ingredients added (I added spinach and mushrooms.) If you're cooking single as I do, this dish does the rare kindness of being well balanced with its noodles and meat and gives about two days of leftovers.

Tammy is a freak over shrimp so I made this for her tonight.  Very good.  Needed a bit more Garlic, and a bit more shrimp in it.  Overall it was a hit.

I followed this recipe exactly... the shrimp tasted plain and unseasoned. The sauce was super thin which made it run through the pasta. I was left with wet noodles and wet shrimp in a puddle of “sauce”.

I made this a few times.  Previous I did as the video and put the pasta in the sauce and attempted mixing.  It absorbed all sauce and like most said I was adding butter, adding butter.  This time I plated the pasta, shrimp on top, and drizzled the butter/garlic/wine sauce over.  Big difference and a much nicer presentation.  I did add a little extra butter and splash over on wine based on what I thought would fit the drizzle on the pasta, but nothing even close to what I was doing when mixing pasta into the sauce pan.  Drizzle is the way to go.

All the 4 and even 5 star reviews are from those who totally had to tweak the recipe.  It was okay--even with the extra butter, wine, and garlic added, and waiting to add the cheese until the end.  The initial recipe should really get 2 stars.

I made this tonight and it was very good.  I did change it up by using more butter, olive oil and wine. I also used a can of white clam sauce so technically, i guess it’s Linguine and clam sauce with shrimp but the sauce was a perfect consistency. I did not add the cheese into the sauce just sprinkled on top. Also forgot the lemon but I didn’t miss it. Tasted just like my mom’s.

Followed others suggestions about increased quantities of butter, wine, etc.  added basil and oregano (tsp) as well as red pepper flakes for a little spicy zip.  Used baby Bella mushrooms sliced thin, red large gulf shrimp and angel hair pasta cooked al dente.  Will make this again!!!  Kids absolutely loved it

This recipe was easy to make and very tasty. I agree with one of the reviewers about doubling the sauce for the  1lb. of pasta the recipe calls. I actually made 3 times the sauce for 1Lb of pasta and was perfect. I also used dry Parsley instead of fresh and the taste was still delicious.

The only downfall to this is the sauce. Not nearly enough for me and my hubby. Great flavor though. I will make again, just do a double or triple amount of sauce.

I actually doubled the amount of white wine and parmesan cheese, increasing the sauce.  Plus I did add spinach at the end.  Enjoyed the end result and will make again!

I made this as part of our Christmas dinner and then again tonight for a regular weeknight dinner. I used frozen shrimp that sells for BOGO from Winn Dixie. This recipe is super easy, but so good, and will make your family think you made something really fancy! I almost felt guilty when my 11-year-old son told me it was the best shrimp he ever had. And we live on the coast in Jacksonville, FL. Another bonus...use a little white whine in the shrimp, and then drink the rest! :) Happy cooking!

Made it exactly as written.   Very flavorful and very easy.  My husband rarely comments on new recipes, but he made it a point to tell me he thought it was one of the best.   Will definitely make it again. Thanks

If you make the sauce as is, it is really bland and there isn’t much of it. Better to follow some of the user reviews who used more of the ingredients and jazzed it up with extra seasoning.

12.23.17 As I suspected, there’s just not enough sauce for this amount of pasta and shrimp, even when I doubled the butter sauce.  There’s nothing tasty about eating dry linguini and, also, there’s just not a whole lot of flavor.  Although unlikely, if I were to make this recipe again, I’d probably quadruple the sauce and bump up the amount of garlic.  Sorry, I know this recipe has had great reviews, but it just didn’t work for me,  and was a waste of beautiful, fresh Gulf shrimp.

Doubled the recipe for the sauce, truly yummy. The key is to generously salt your water!

I am also giving it four stars because I had to add more of all the ingredients with the  exception of the shrimp and pasta.  I added Romano cheese, too.  I would agree with the other reviews that this is a good base recipe that you can build on with your preferred ingredients.

I liked it a lot.  You really need to double the sauce mixture.  (I might only double all but the butter because in doubling the recipe it was super buttery... which isn't necessarily a bad thing) Also my shrimp cooked a lot faster than the recipe estimated.  I would make this again.

Family loved it! As others have stated, you need to at least double the sauce recipe. I tripled it. I may add some cream to the sauce, next time to thicken it up, because it was actually better a day later after the sauce had thickened a little.

Since I didn’t have white wine, I used chicken broth, & thickened a bit with a teaspoon of flour & splash of milk but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was great!  Even my anti-pasta husband cleaned his plate—very quick & yummy!

First....a pound of linguini with that little of butter, parsley, cheese is ridiculous.... making this, as I suspected, way under .....same with the wine....you need to quadruple the ingredients to even out the end result with shrimp being the exception....

Loved it!!!! So quick and easy and delicious!!! As other reviewers suggested, I also increased the amount of sauce to 1.5 sticks of butter, 3/4 cup white wine, 1/3 cup parm cheese and added 1 t basil and 1t oregano. That way there was plenty of sauce to put on the pasta. I used I bag of shrimp which was 1.5lb. Everyone loved it. I find most recipes take me longer than they say but this one really was quick and delicious!!!

I found that I needed to double/triple sauce ingredients other  than garlic to play nicely with a pound each of shrimp and pasta.  The addition of spinach or my favorite, stringless sugar snap peas, gives added color, nutrition, and depth of flavor and texture to this recipe.  It's going to be in the rotation at our house for sure.  Also nice enough for guests.

It was a little bland, but has great potential. I did as the other reviews suggested, and doubled the sauce ingredients. One of the other reviews suggested adding lemon juice to the sauce. I think that would've made the flavor much better. I'll try that next time.

After reading several reviews, I decided to try the following tweaks with 12 oz. of pasta: 2/3 cup wine, 6 cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoons each of olive oil and butter. Not bad, but next time I'll try more butter, less wine, and omit the olive oil. I enjoyed my first attempt, though!

I made this last night for my family and everyone loved it.  I followed one of the reviewers comments regarding the sauce, 1 1/2 cups butter, 3/4 cup dry white wine, 6 cloves of garlic and 1/3 cup Asiago cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and a dash of red pepper flakes.   This recipe is a keeper.

Take your shrimp shells and boil in water.  You can even add wine  if you want.  Strain the liquid and add to the sauce - gives you more sauce without the calories of extra butter.  Only rated recipe 3 stars as is -  definitely needs more sauce to spoon over the pasta.  So increase butter spices, little more wine, add shrimp stock and add cheese at end.  The sauce will be thin so mix noodles on plate and have bread to soak up juice.  Can add crab and or scallops as well.   Then perfection

As other reviewers  stated, I'm giving 4 stars only because the sauce needed to be dramatically increased. I used 8 oz pasta, 4 tbsp butter, 2/3 cup wine, 5 cloves garlic, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, 1/4 cup combined fresh parsley and basil, 3 tbsp grated Parmesan and 2 tbsp sharp farmers cheese and 12 oz shrimp; we loved it.

Very good tasting sauce. I did add a small amount of half and half just to enhance the taste.

Delicious flavor. However there was not enough sauce for the pound of pasta. I did add a little broccoli for color and veggie in one pan.

As at least one other person said, there was not nearly enough sauce for the pasta. And I even used half the amount of pasta since I was cooking for two. During cooking, I realized there wouldn't be enough and quickly doubled up on everything- butter, wine (used Yellowtail Chardonnay and drank it with the meal), Parmesan.
I used whole grain linguine and pre-cooked, deveined, medium-large shrimp because it was much cheaper. I threw in the shrimp towards the end to heat them.
I served the dish with steamed broccoli, and it all turned out pretty well. The Parmesan did get a little "gloppy," if that makes sense. I would some other cheese next time.
I would definitely make this again, just with more sauce. I honestly think I should've at least tripled it because there is one serving leftover and not much sauce.

Pretty simple to make and quite flavorful.  Best part was that I had all of the ingredients in the first place.  Added some Asparagus to the recipe, gave it a bit more texture.

Made this for supper tonight and loved, loved, loved it!  Just like eating at some fancy restaurant.  Like others, I multiplied the sauce ingredients as it didn't seem like enough for the amount of pasta.  I had to tell my son to get his serving before mine was done or there wouldn't be any left for him.   Such a decadent meal in basically the time it takes to cook the pasta.

Good basic recipe but definitely needs more...added more butter, more garlic and more wine and some broth along with Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.

Also want to let people know that if you are going to change the entire recipe, please don't give it a 5 rating.  It is very misleading to people who are not "real" cooks or are just starting out.

Very good, easy and quick. Quite pleased. Will make it again.  I doubled the amount of sauce, which did prove to be a good idea. Also, started the sauce/shrimp pan while the linguini was cooking.

this is amazing for my first time cooking shrimp.
I added chopped tomatoes and substituted white wine for a mix of viniger, lemon juice, and water. 
I also used spaghetti pasta instrad of linguini and it doesnt make a different in my opinions.

Not very good. Not much flavor, just buttery rich sauce. Shrimp linguini needs a different base for max flavor. I love butter, but you need more for full flavor. And as others have said, the proportions are WAY out of whack. No way does this make enough for the shrimp OR the linguini.

My wife said put this on the "don't make again" side of the ledger. Doesn't happen often.

I read many of the reviews and multiplied the ingredients x 6. I also added mushrooms and green onions to the liquid, 1/2 tsp Old Bay Seasoning and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Towards the end before I added the prawns, I added corn starch to thicken it up. At the very end I added minced spinach, arugula, and parsley. Tossed it with the pasta and then added the parmesan cheese. It was delish!

Good basic recipe for a seafood linguini. I modified it slightly by adding 100 g smoked salmon (for two servings) for a little extra flavour.

I always make a recipe exactly as written the first time I try it.  It really is the right thinkg to do. Otherwise, the review is your recipe, not theirs.  I agree with many reviewers  who thought this recipe as written needed more of the buttery sauce. I would at least double the ingredients other than pasta if using 16 ounces of linguini.  I will try it again, using changes recommended by other readers.

A good dish. Absolutely quadruple the sauce. I added the zest and juice from one lemon(a little too much, will use juice only from half a lemon next time) spoon the sauce over the pasta THEN add the freshly grated parmesan.

Very nice - easy and quick.  My guests were amazed that I made it so quickly while we were just chatting.  Cooking the pasta is the only part that takes any time (I live at high altitude).  I use angel hair pasta.  I also leave the shrimps shell-on which I think adds a bit of flavor.  I also add wilted spinach as a bed on the pasta for the shrimp to go on.  Very pretty and delicious.  Nice recipe - thank you!

Not a lot of flavor, but ok. Did exactly as listed, except we doubled the sauce as others had suggested. A person could've tripled it to have enough sauce. I think next time I may just try coming up with my own recipe & see how I do.

As written the flavoring is bland and the sauce lacking in volume.  I wondered as I began preparing why the quantities of butter and wine were so little.  I should have read the reviews before making, then I'd have understood the recipe as written is incomplete.  It's a shame.   With a bit of a richer sauce in proper volume this dish would rate a minimum of 4 stars.

I gave this four stars but I had to add ingredients as there is not enough sauce for the linguini.  So I boiled the shrimp shells in 1 1/2 cups water with salt pepper and parsley, for about ten minutes, strained and used   this broth in the recipe with 4 tbsp of wine, 1 1/2 sticks of butter, five garlic cloves and 2 tbsp parmesan cheese.  I also cut the shrimp in half for easier serving and eating and used only half of the linguini as it was plenty for the sauce.

Simple, yet delicious recipe.  Made a gluten free, dairy free alternate with gluten free pasta, dairy free butter substitute and honey bee goat cheese instead of parmesan and it was fantastic.  I would recommend tripling the sauce to make sure there is enough to MI» with the pasta.  This will be made frequently in our house!

This was good and very easy.  I cut the pasta and shrimp and half and doubled the sauce.  It still could have used less pasta and a lot more sauce.  If I make again, with quadruple the sauce.

As is.  But once you increase wine and butter to 3/4 cup each + add 1tsp of basil and oregano and a bit of red pepper flakes this becomes a 5.    And as others said, leave the Parmesan for once plates.

Now I will say usually children love pasta, so it is hard to go wrong here, but my children loved this one all the same. Next time I will probably make just a bit more sauce though, because it was tasty, but I would like an even more garlic taste I think. I served mine with a garden salad and roasted peppers on the side. I will definitely make this again sometime.

By the way, I nearly doubled the sauce components and added 4 TBS of butter... Still a bit dry. I will increase ingredients more next time.

I added more butter, garlic, wine and then spinach. I used 1/2 of the pasta with a little butter to keep  it from sticking. And since we like it a little spicy, I added red pepper flakes.  Good basic recipe, but needs a little more oomp.

Definitely will make again. Did double recipe as there was not enough sauce to really cover pasta and as there are only two of us I had made only half of the pasta. I also added more garlic then called for in recipe. If reheating I found good idea to remove shrimp and then add back for only few minutes to heat, keeps shrimp from getting  over cooked.

Decent but I made some adjustments. Marinated the shrimp in lemon juice, olive oil and a little cayenne pepper, only used half a pound of pasta...it was more then enough for the sauce. I also added diced onions in with the garlic.

I quadrupled the sauce and it was perfect for 2 servings. The cheese got a little goopy, but after I threw my noodles in the sauce for a couple minutes, this was delicious! Maybe will try adding a squirt of lemon to finish off next time.

We liked the dish. I didn't use wine as I wanted to because my daughter had taken medication and I wasn't certain what to do. Also, I used the mozzarella cheese.  I used a little chicken broth. Otherwise,  everything was good.

I , unlike others  modify recipes.  I think it's so unfair to the chef who posted it to rate it after you have botched it and give it 2 stars.  Personally I loved this one as submitted but...I altered it ergo, I will not comment.   

I don't want to hear what you did.  Every recipe is wonderful.   NOT EVERYONE CAN COOK!  We all have our 'go to' flavours but for the newbies, it allows them to actually make a meal.

Quick, easy, delish! After reading other reviews I did quadruple ingredients for sauce other than cheese which I did not put in sauce but rather on top when served. Also did not have fresh basil and neither did store when I stopped so I just used Italian seasoning.  Kids (17,15&13) loved it as well as better half and myself.  Will certainly make again! (Btw 12 tbsp of wine is approximately 1cup!)

I'm big on seafood (shellfish) and adding garlic to it with the pasta was a dish that I could serve on a monthly basis. I truly enjoy making this dish.

This dish was easy to make, and turned out delicious. Next time I would add the parsley with the shrimp, adding it with  the cheese I found that  the cheese clumped to the parsley.
I also added a few grains crushed of red chili peppers. Not really required but I like the glow!

Our Family favourite recipe if I could give it more stars I would. I serve it with toasted garlic bread.  Absolutely love it.  I do double the sauce as others have suggested.  Sometimes to glam it up I add some Peas, or other green veggie to give it some color on the plate. But it is wonderful just as is.

amazing recipe, only one issue and it's preference .. not the recipe.  1 lb of linguine is too much for the other ingredients.  Some people in their reviews agreed with me, however this isn't a fault of the recipe, it's a matter of personal taste.  My sister would use the whole pound, me and my family prefer to either double all the other ingredients or halve the pasta amount. 
Love the sauce, but here too, it's preference.. if you want a quick and simple sauce this is the way to go.. if you want a more complex sauce then you can either add or change,  your preference, but it's still the base.  this is quick and painless recipe all about simplicity! perfect as is or a base :)

Didn't make what I would call sauce. Very little of it. I added diced tomatoes and it was good, but won't make this recipe again.

This dish was incredibly bland even after we doubled the sauce ingredients. As many other people have said there was almost no sauce to speak of. This could be used as a starter sauce but I think it's much too bland to stand on its own.

I doubled all ingredients except the pasta, and added julliened red peppers and spinach.  It's tasty but simple.  I'll definitely add more veggies if I make it again.

I'm glad I read other reviews before making. I had shrimp and linguine on had but no parsley or white wine. I used about 4 tbsp butter, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil,  3 tbsp lemon juice and 3/4 cup of the boil pasta water. I also used a dash of ground thyme and 1 tbsp crushed red pepper.

Made same changes as others, much more sauce. I used 4 tablespoons of butter, 3/4 cup white wine and also a 1/4 cup of cream to make it a bit richer. Then I boiled the pasta to almost done, set aside and cooked shrimps in sauce for 4 minutes. Once shrimps were done i removed them with a slotted spoon and then drained the pasta and put in into the sauce pan. Cooked it with sauce for about 1-2 minutes and threw parmaasan cheese on top ( not a lot) then put shrimp back in and stirred the whole thing together and served to plates . My husband really liked it and I so did I.

It was really good, but had to alter it as did the other reviewers. Half the pasta, double the sauce for 4 servings. It could also use a touch more seasoning for pop. (My side dish had more pop that the dish itself.) Otherwise it was enjoyable.

As others have said here, this recipe is a a GREAT starting point.  Taking their suggestions, I heated a little olive oil and sautéed the garlic (5 cloves), bumped the wine up to 1/4 cup, added a tsp each of dried basil and oregano, added red pepper flakes, bumped the butter up to 1/2 stick, and added about 2 tbsp of grated Parmesan to the sauce immediately before mixing with the pasta.  I can honestly say that this came out better than anything I've ever gotten a restaurant.  Highly recommended!!!

I made this, but basically changed entire recipe. I used 1 stick of butter, 1/3 cup dry white cooking wine, and about 1.25lbs extra large shrimp on sale. I salted pasta water and didn't measure out dried parsley or pepper. Oh and lots of garlic. It came out great since my husband went back for a 2nd plate of linguini, but there wasn't any sauce or shrimp left. Seems like a recipe that can be tweaked to your liking and turn out great.

Used 6 cloves of garlic for 4 servings, shrimp had very good flavor but there was not enough sauce for the pasta.  Next time I will try 4 times the sauce and will use larger shrimp.

I did add more wine and butter as the shrimp was cooking as there didn't seem to be much of a sauce to flavor the pasta.  Will definitely make again as my husband is in chemo and although he loves red sauce he can't have it at this time because of the acidity.

Great recipe STACEYO!  Just like most recipes, I use the recipe as a basis of what I want.  I made a few adjustments to this recipe:
1lb wheat linguine
1 1/2 lb small shrimp
1 lb sliced mushroom
3 Tbsp butter*
1/2 C white wine*
1/4 C finely shredded Parmesan cheese*
7 cloves garlic, 4 minced & 3 thinly sliced
3 Tbsp fresh parsley*
Hawaiian Salt & Pepper*    ( *No true measurements.  All by smell/taste )    I start the pot of water (linguine) and preheat broil oven (garlic bread)
I used only half of the cooking ingredients to cook, drain and set aside the mushrooms.  
Add the remaining cooking ingredients (keeping a little parsley for topping garnish) to above remaining sauce and slowly heat. Not allowing sauce to boil.
Linguine should already be in boiling water with sea salt.
Bread in oven.
Shrimp in sauce.
Turn in drained linguine with sauce right in pan of shrimp.
Turn in mushrooms.

The three rating is because I had to make considerable changes to the recipe. I could tell as I cooked that there would be little to no sauce, which would leave the pasta dry. I added more butter, used some of the pasta water w/ two bullion cubes and garlic seasoning, and threw in some Alfredo seasoning (dry packet) to make a more substantial sauce. With these additional changes, the dish rates *****.

I made this tonight and it was delicious. The only thing I changed was instead of butter and the Parmesan cheese I used smart balance and go veggie Parmesan cheese for a gluten and dairy free dish. My family loved it!

Delicious! I made the sauce but made some changes per the suggestions of OD32T3. My fiancé was loved it. I also made a tomato and cucumber salad with some garlic bread on the side.....perfect dish which I will definitely make again!

should have read the reviews before making...I'm one who follows recipes to a "t" and had a ton of pasta leftover due to lack of sauce...also, shrimp was extremely fishy (don't know why) so it messed up the entire dish imo...not sure I'll make it again but was super easy!

This was absolutely delicious! After reading the reviews , I knew I had to tweak it though. I used 1/2 the amount of multigrain pasta, 1 stick of butter, a med shallot, 7 cloves of garlic, fresh basil and parsley, a few red pepper flakes and  around  1/2 cup of wine (didn't really measure it though). The cheese--parmesan and asiago--I added to the pasta which went on top of the shrimp. I also added some fresh spinach and let it wilt- mixing everything in 1 pan together. Definitely a keeper and can't wait to make it again.

I tripled the ingredients and did not add the cheese to the sauce. Instead I added it and tossed with the pasta and sauce before serving. Delicious, quick and easy!  Did not have fresh parsley so I used dried parsley, basil, and oregano.

I might add some diced tomatoes at the last minute of cooking for additional color and I will halve the pasta or double the main ingredients for 4-6.

Easy and delicious.  I used 5Tbs butter and 1 Cup white wine.  Added a diced tomato.  Substituted out basil for the parsley and added just a pinch of crushed red pepper.

This was a good pasta only because I am a pasta freak. We doubled the sauce and it was fairly moist but there was no garlic taste just some faint flavoring from the wine. Add A LOT more garlic if you want it to taste like anything

OK I loved it but really....it was my mistake forgetting to read the reviews before starting the recipe hehe I read the entire recipe but the reviews. It happens..Well, this definitely needs more of the ingredients. As I was cooking I read the reviews and noticed everyone were increasing the amount of ingredients and I quickly rectified. The taste was EXCELLENT and is very quick...if you find peeled devained shrimps too! I did not have any handy so I had to peel them and devein too before even starting anything!

I grill my shrimp on bamboo sticks and grilling makes all the difference. Stir fry sauce is a good grilling taste also. But you try different spices like ginger root or garlic and it opens up a new taste every time. experiment, you will see.

This recipe is one of my favorites. It’s quick and easy to make and tastes yummy. I also think it needs more sauce so I multiply all sauce ingredients by 4. I serve it with a tossed salad and garlic bread.

The measurements are completely off - even taking in the advice of other reviewers, it still came out dry. In order to make this edible, I had to make 9x the sauce and I'd still recommend halving the amount of pasta. I'd also recommend adding the garlic into the butter as it's melting and letting it cook until slightly brown before adding the other ingredients. Then also adding a dash of garlic salt or garlic powder to up the garlic taste. The shrimp needs to be marinated or something beforehand to add taste. Would probably not make this again.

Made this for the second time - this time with mussels (pre-cooked, thawed). Followed Suzy's recommendations for increasing the amount of sauce and loved it. Invited my adult kids to share it with us, and may make even more sauce, as I am afraid that overnight the linguine will absorb all the existing sauce. In accordance with Suzy's advice, sprinkled the Parmesan over the hot plates of pasta & sauce. Yum!

I made this for my family and it was a hit.  Most of the comments on this website recommend making additional sauce and I agree.  I used two tablespoons of butter and three times the amount of wine. I can follow a recipe but I'm not great at improvising. I just knew I didn't want to add more butter (trying to keep it a little light).  The extra wine made the sauce a little runny but I mixed it with the pasta in a large bowl, so you only had to take what you wanted and could spoon extra sauce from the bottom of the bowl.  I'm sure fresh shrimp would be better, but since I was in a hurry, I used frozen, pre-cooked shrimp and it tasted fine. Just don't overcook. My daughter wants me to use clams or mussels next time, so we will be cooking this again!

Took the suggestion of another reviewer and doubled the sauce and halved the linguine. With that change their was too much shrimp and not enough linguine. Also the sauce was too thin. Need to work on the proportions and cook the sauce longer next time. Stay tuned.

Loved the flavors! I made it per the recipe, and the result was a little dry. Next time I would double the butter, or maybe add a little EVOO to coat the linguine better. But, the flavors were great. We loved it.

The ingredients are way off.  This recipe has potential but 1 T of butter for a pound of pasta is so far off.

my go to version for years includes more butter/garlic/wine and a bit of parmesen in the sauce. Never fails to delight

The recipe is amazing with the changes recommended by other reviewers. I used a 4tbsp butter, 3/4 cup of white wine, 6 garlic cloves and a dessert spoon (10 ml) of Better Than Bouillon chicken flavor instead of any other salt. Amazing!!!!

I agree that adding more sauce is a good idea as well as a little bit of lemon juice.  It's a keeper for an easy weeknight meal.  The shrimp are so tasty!

I didn't think it was bland at all, neither did my two kids ages 3 and 6. We loved the slight buttery and heavily garlicy flavor. I will say that I ended up doubling the "sauce" and even then added more wine after the shrimp were added. I was afraid that I was going to overcook the shrimp (not much experience), but they were perfect. I didn't add salt either because I used cooking white wine (that's what I had). The meal was easy to put together and had an elegant look and taste that implied much more prep had been needed. I could easily see it becoming a recipe I turn to for my family and company.

I tripled the sauce recipe and added about 1/3 of milk and 3T cream cheese while cooking. I added the parmesan after I took it off the stove. It was good will make again.

Very tasty.  We quadrupled the sauce and still could have used a little bit more for 4 servings.  Doubled shellfish by adding 3/4 lb. scallops.

I made this today. I used penne pasta (whole grain) rather than linquine. I also did not have white wine, so substituted vegetable stock. The sauce turned out very good, it was nice and light and not super greasy like a lot of sauces are on pasta dishes. The whole grain noodles definitely needed something a little stronger to mask their whole-grain taste though! I was worried about 3 cloves of garlic being too much but it definitely wasn't. I probably could have added another clove or two (mmmm, garlic!).

This is a quick easy recipe. A little too dry for us so I tripled all ingredients but only used 4 garlic cloves. If y0u dish the linguini individually and spoon shrimp and liquid over dish it is plenty and delicious!! I also use thin linguini..

Hubby and I liked this very much.  I had no white wine so I used all the cooking sherry that I had.  The sauce was delicious and as someone else said the house smelled great (if you like garlic).

One of my favorite dishes to make!! My family loves it every time I make it. I like to add lightly seasoned cooked chicken breast pieces cut up and fresh scallops to it to "Beef" up the dish. However, it tastes just as good sticking to the original recipe also!! Definitely Five stars!! :)

I doubled the sauce as previously recommended in the reviews but found there still wasn't quite enough sauce.  I can't put my finger on why I found the sauce to not taste quite right (too shrimpy, and not buttery enough?  Maybe).  My guests enjoyed it, but I was somewhat disappointed.

My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed this one!  I did, however, tweek it a bit.  I omitted the white wine and replaced it with some pineapple juice.  This might sound weird, but once it combined with the garlic it was a huge hit.  Also, we increased the amt of Parmesan cheese.  
While eating, I decided that I would've been happier if I had only used 1 clove of garlic.  
Otherwise, it was delicious!

We all loved this.  One of the best parts of the dish compared to a restaurant is that when you do it yourself the shrimp doesn't necessarily get overcooked.  It was really good.  I added mushrooms as someone in the earlier reviews suggested.  I wish the sauce was a bit thicker - perhaps will add a little flour next time.  But my husband thought it was perfect, just the way it's supposed to be.  We will be adding this to the rotation - very quick and easy to make.

I liked the recipe.  It was light, yet filling.  I would definitely make it again.  The only thing I would improve on is a way to make the sauce stick to the pasta a little more.  It fell to the bottom of the plate and if not eatten quickly it was lost.

I tripled the sauce and added 1 Tablespoon of heavy cream.  Reduced the garlic a bit due to personal preference.  Excellent recipe, very fast and easy to make.  Even the 6 year old loved it!

this recipe is fantastic. i used a little more parmesan and white wine than what the recipe calls for (like a couple of tablespoons). i even used regular grated low fat parm cheese and it turned out great. my boyfriend (who can be critical about cooking) said that this dish was better than the olive garden!

VERY EASY to make!!  I did end up simmering the broth for a while as well as adding a little lemon to it.  Added Milk near the end just to make it a little creamier..Also added Cheese as I went then doused it at the end!!  Will definitely make again!!!

I made this last night.  It was sooooo good.  I quadrupled(or a little more) this recipe in order to make enough to feed my family.  I've never cooked with wine before and was astounded at how delicious this was.  The only difference I made was to add finely diced red pepper and sprinkled asiago cheese on top instead of adding cheese to the sauce.  Will definitely be making this dish again. Thanks

This recipe was great. fast and very tasty, I too recommend that you double the ingredients for the sauce to ensure that there is enough. I also added tomatoes which the recipe did not call for.

First I have to say that I cooked this at a kitchen challenged friend's house (missing many of the spices and tools I normally consider essential (though she does have more now because I said so:). Like most I considered this a good start to a fabulous recipe. I too increased the ingredients (3 tbsp butter + 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/3 cup white wine (Riesling), 1 tbsp dry oregano and 1 tbsp dry basil (instead of parsley), 5 cloves of garlic (finely chopped and sauteed in butter/olive oil on very low heat before adding herbs), and 2 tbsp of a brand named marinade with sun dried tomatoes and herbs (because I didn't have any canned or fresh tomatoes on hand which would have been my 1st choice). I also added some (maybe 2 tbsp) freshly grated Parm to the sauce, and a bag of frozen vegetables mix (broccoli, carrots, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, red peppers) because that's all she had, threw in the raw shrimp and served over vermicelli, with more shredded parm and a drizzle of olive oil. Overall extremely happy with the results and plan to take this home and play with it some more (fresh herbs and vegetables, more Parm, tomatoes, whatever)

This dish always makes me feel like, "Why do we ever dine out, when I can cook restaurant quality food at home?" Followed other tips and used 4TBS butter, 1/4 cup white wine, 4 garlic cloves, and 2 TBS of fresh lemon juice. I usually sere over whole wheat pasta. Yum Yum.

Very yummy! My husband loved it. I put 2 tsp. of parsley and 1 tsp. basil. Added more butter and I didn't have any wine so I put in a little dry white vinegar in. I also added a small amount of lemon juice per someone elses suggestion- and didn't add the cheese until it was mixed in with the pasta. Will make this again!

This was so delicious! I cooked it with the amounts shown, and it was enough for two people for a dinner serving. If you are feeding more than two, double the sauce! Super easy, really delicious and quick to fix.

Awesome recipe! Like other reviewers, I tripled the sauce ingredients. I also omitted the Parmesan cheese because my husband doesn't like cheese - he loves this dish and had me make it twice, in one week. Thanks for posting this recipe!!

A very tasty sauce. I also had to double the butter and wine amounts. I added onions too so it soaked up alot of sauce and I had to add extra wine. But it was a good sauce. Its not heavy and it coats the pasta nicely.

Turned out great with the help of some other comments.  I added 1 cup extra butter, 1/2 cup wine, mushrooms, and asiago cheese.  This dish went over great with the family.

Definitely needs more sauce.  I made 4x more and it wasn't enough.  Instead of using steamed broccoli from a bag as a side, I included it into the sauce after the shrimp was done.  Yum!

This is not only one of the aasiest, quickest dinners you'll ever make, it is also one of the most delicious!  If you love shrimp and are careful cooking them to "just done", you can't mess up this dish.  I keep flash frozen shrimp on hand just for great, quick dishes like this one!

Definately needed to multiply the sauce by 4.  I added the cheese in the last few minutes.  It was good, but I don't think I would make it again.

Quick, easy and very good!  I am glad I read the other comments first though - you definitely need to multiple the sauce ingredients several times over.  I use the sauce to fix scallops and shrimp by themselves with no pasta as well.

I have to agree with the person that reviewed this and said they weren't sure what all the hype was.  This was just kinda vanilla.  I tripled the sauce like the reviews said, added about 1/4 C. of half and half.  The sauce was bland and needed some work.  The wine did give the shrimp a nice flavor but I won't make this again.

i made this the other night for supper and the end result was pretty good, although my DH and I both agreed that it was missing something.  I reduced the amount of pasta and shrimp  by half because it was just my DH and I eating (left the sauce measurements the same).  Next time, I will add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and fresh parsley along with some diced tomatoes.

Wonderful!  I added some red onion at the same time I cooked the garlic.  I also used a precooked shrimp ring so it was really easy to prepare.  We loved the flavour, but I will probably add more garlic.  I also used fat reduced margarine in place of the butter.  I served this with "Cheese Garlic Biscuits II" (from this site) and a ceasar salad.  I'll make this again when I have a shrimp ring sitting in the freezer!

This was a great dish. Very simple to make. I had to modify it a little, using frozen pre-cooked shrimp and dried parsley flakes because of lack of time, but it turned out great. Very flavorful. Thanks!

Pretty bland flavor...I seemed to be the only one who was unhappy with it though.  Both my parents and my boyfriend thought it was great.  It just neeeds...something...Not sure what.  I did add mushrooms but other than that followed the recipe.

Very good if you triple the sauce and follow advice of previous reviewers.

first time I have given a low rating and reason is that I  had to change alot with this recipe.I followed other suggestions in changes and still it was okay! still needed something-I wish i had some fresh mushrooms and maybe some other vegies.I rate it about 3 plus.

Great recipe. It was a big hit over the holidays, even with the kids. I followed previous suggestions, and I also used white garlic wine instead of regular. My niece who "doesn't like seafood" went back for thirds!

This recipe was average.  It was very simple to make, which I like, but it's just not for me.  I'm not a big parmesan cheese fan, but am always willing to try new recipes.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was very good.  I also increased the sauce by 3.  Although next time to make more calorie friendly I would only use enough butter to saute the vegetables (I used mushrooms and red pepper) and when they are a bit softened I would add the wine, about 1 cup.  As much as I love garlic, I think next time I will cut back a bit (I used 5 cloves and it was very good but I think I would still frighten away the vampires).  I also topped mine with green onions and it was very good.  Will definitely make again for the garlic lovers.

WOW!!! What a great recipe as "OD32T3" wrote its a GREAT basis for an outrageous sauce. My recipe: 1-1/2 sticks butter, blended in tablespoon of flour, added 6-7 mushrooms, 7 cloves garlic & about 1/3-Cup EVOO ... let this simmer for a bit... added about 1/4-cup 'Korbel' (no white wine available), then about 4-TBS fresh grated Pecarino Parm Cheese.  The cheese did clump a bit but added a great texture to the sauce.  As a final touch I added a healthy dose of oregano.  I am a 'taste' cooker.  I know the taste I am looking for and with these BASICS I was able to create a gourmet-sauce ... THANKS

I had to use what I had in the cupboard for this which the only changes I made was I used angel hair pasta and chicken broth. That being said it was a little bland I used an extra clove of garlic just cuz I am a garlic lover and it still was a little bland. Maybe like one reviewer said it is a good starter recipe. The family liked it it just was me who thought it was bland but hey I am the one who counts lol ! Thanks, Sonya

I made this recipe using 6 times the amount of sauce.  It was very good.  My husband liked it a lot.  Definitely a keeper.

Very good flavour. Had to quadruple ingredients for sauce and even added wine during cooking of shrimps. I will make this again but would add even more ingredients for sauce mixture. Is the originator of recipe sure on the contents???

This is too easy to be true.  It tastes so good.  Everyone on the table saying that it's like in the restaurant.
