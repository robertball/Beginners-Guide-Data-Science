Great vegetarian option for chicken tortilla soup! Love the addition of the hot sauce. I added a little bit of fresh squeezed lime juice. Quick and delicious!

This is a really flavorful soup. I actually made it with chicken broth and canned corn.  Light , meatless and delicious. I'll definitely make it again!

This has become a family favorite at my house! I omit the hot sauce and dice a poblano pepper and a jalapeno instead.  We serve it with tortilla chips instead of baked tortillas, and use sour cream instead of the cheese.  We look forward to soup night every time this is on the menu.  Very delicious!

I liked it, but I found such a variety of ingredients a little overwhelming. Next time I'll make it when I'm missing some ingredients to tone it down a little. I already skipped the cheese this time to keep it vegan.

Amazing soup! I've wanted something Mexican inspired with a bit of heat and hearty. This did the trick. The best part is that you can spice it up if it is to bland for your liking.

Quick tasty soup. I am not a hot sauce fan so I omitted it and put in some extra chili powder instead. The result was mild but not bland--just what I wanted. I'll definitely be making it again!
