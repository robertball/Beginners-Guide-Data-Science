Awesome recipe! My entire family begs me to make this! I have found that wrapping the meat around the mozzarella ball is easier than stuffing it in though.  Definitely a fantastic family favorite

These are really great, and they're even better the next day in a meatball sandwich!  I axed the mozzarella in the middle (watching calories), and I don't keep pesto around, so I used olive oil and a bit more garlic.  Next time I'll omit the salt; with the sodium in the marinara, I think that the addition of the salt in the recipe is unnecessary.

To cut back on calories, I used fresh basil from my garden, eggbeaters, and no olive oil.  I cubed low fat string cheese instead of fresh mozz.

Absolutely delicious.  I never commented on any recipes sofar because they are not usually all that special, or don't turn out too well, or don't taste as expected.  But these meatballs were the best ever, and moist - due to the extra cheese on the inside.  Easy to make, even though it takes a bit of time, but it's well worth it.  I'll make them again exactly the way the recipe is written.  Thankyou!

Came out good! It definitly saved dinner tonight. We have a freezer full of ground turkey and this is an awesome way to use it in a healthy way. Paired with some wheat pasta and homemade sauce it will be on the menu again at my house.

My husband and I loved these! I did make a couple changes since I didn't have all the ingredients. Instead of bread crumbs I used oats and didn't add the pesto but it was still quite tasty!

Oh my these were a pleasant surprise!  This recipe caught my eye because I'm looking for ways to use up my pesto, and I'm not gonna lie, I was also pretty excited about having an excuse to buy string cheese ;-)  I only had 1lb of ground turkey so I used a little less than half of all the other ingredients.  The oil from the pesto along with the milk and egg made for incredibly moist and flavorful meatballs.  And really, the cheese in the middle is such a playful (and tasty) touch!  I do believe this is my new favorite meatball recipe.

These are great! I whisk all of the added ingredients together before I add it to the ground turkey - it helps distribute the seasonings evenly.
Also, I used a non-stick pan and the meatballs were overdone and stuck on the bottom; when I used a regular cookie sheet/jelly roll pan they were perfect (spray with non-stick spray). The addition of the pesto makes these SO good!

I made two batches of these: one with turkey and one with beef. Let me say WOW! The cheese is perfect inside this meatball and it is flavored so wonderfully. I did use store bought minced garlic to cut down on time and sprinkled a little garlic salt on top before putting in the oven. I also used less tomato sauce than in the recipe because my husband isn't a fan of lots of sauce but THEY WERE SOOOO GOOD. It made so many that we froze half so expect a lot of leftovers unless you are making for a large party.

excellent taste and texture.  the mozzarella was a very nice touch. I used prepared pesto, not homemade.  We are a gluten-free family, so instead of bread crumbs, we used Edward & Sons instant mashed potatoes (equal substitution with the bread crumbs) and it added a luxurious garlic flavor to the meatballs.

This is an excellent recipe, very flavorful even without sauce.  As other reviewers suggested, I used string cheese rather than the fresh mozzarella. This recipe made 42 meatballs (about 1 3/4 inches each) which will help you determine how many pieces to cut your cheese into.  I used fresh mozz. when I made this dish a second time, the taste was not better and the fresh mozz. leaked out much worse than the string cheese.

This recipe is amazing!!!!!! Followed the recipe exactly except I had 3.75 lbs of turkey because they come in 1.25 lb packs at the store.  I used mozzarella string cheese to stuff in the meatballs and just cut them in fourths.  It was so delicous!  I used them for meatball subs and my husband devoured them!  He was so shocked when I told him it was turkey.  Usually he won't touch ground turkey.  I used the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe from here too instead of store bought stuff.  So delicious! Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

I happened to have pesto, mozzarella & ground turkey on hand. For crumbs, I just used crumbled up toast & added some oregano, rosemary, & basil to it. Out of eggs, so used mayo. Didn't have fresh parsley, so used dried. And it still turned out great!  The mozzarella in the middle creates the magic. It's a fun way to use turkey!

Tasty, loved the pesto in the meat mix. Texture was a good, soft type meatball. Minus a star because the balls became little volcanos of mozzarella. I baked them 30 minutes and they were done; more and there might not have been any cheese left inside. I made 44 large balls, and would limit the cheese cubes to 1/2" next time. The amount of pepper is okay, but very noticeable; my grandkids had mixed reaction to these. My husband & I liked them well enough.

I was out of ground turkey so I took the meat out of some spicey turkey sausage and went from there. I also cut up a few mozz cheese sticks to put in the middle and it worked out great! Served with a side fried okra :)

These meatballs are delicious!!! I had shredded mozzarella, which was slightly more difficult to stuff into the meatballs -- next time I will simply mix it in with everything else. I did omit the milk (for lack of it), but I didn't miss it. The other modification I made (for the sake of simplification) was to pour the marinara sauce directly in the dish I was baking in and turn the oven temp down to 200 for about 10-15 minutes while the pasta was cooking on the stove. It made for one less dish to clean after our delicious meal. I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe.  I used 1/3 of the mix for meatballs and put a chunk of Kraft tomato basil string cheese in the center of each.  The other 2/3 I mixed in shredded mozzarella and baked it as a turkey loaf.  We had the loaf for dinner and I froze the meatballs (after eating one to try it out).  I think I'll use the meatloaf mix the next time and try it as turkey burgers.

This is the first time I have ever reviewed a recipe and these meatballs deserve it!  This recipe is absolutely amazing.  I prepared it just as the recipe says, and my husband said this is the best meal I have ever made.  Thank you so much!  Definitely putting this one in the rotation.

These are fantastic!  My husband had no idea he was eating ground turkey.  I use a bit less salt, panko bread crumbs, and cubed string cheese (instead of fresh mozzarella)  Also, I make homemade marinara instead of using a jar.

Wow, I never thought turkey meatballs could be so flavorful!  I just made these tonight and was very impressed.  The mozzarella did not stay inside the meatballs, maybe because I didn't tighten the meat around the cheese enough.  However, this was not a bad thing- the cheese melted and bubbled around the bottom of the meatballs, getting bubbly and crispy.  Yum!!! I used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 turkey sausage, but didn't change anything else.  I will definitely be making these again soon!

Very, very good.  I'm on a gestational diabetic diet (30 weeks pregnant), and this recipe is one of the best:  low carbs, high protein.  I didn't stuff them with mozzarella (ran out of time), but they were delicious anyway.  I plan to make a double batch next time.  My family doesn't eat beef or pork, so I'm glad to have a reliable recipe using ground turkey.  Thank you!

Seriously the BEST turkey meatballs EVER. So flavorful. My husband normally grumbles when I substitute beef or pork with turkey but he devoured them. The only change I made was I used 1/2 the salt.  A tbsp seemed like too much. Next time I'll omit the salt completely. DELICIOUS.

Great recipe.  If you're on a low-carb diet, omit the spaghetti sauce & pasta and you're golden.

I'd like to point out one thing, though--make sure you cube your cheese to an appropriate size (like maybe 3/4" on each side or even a bit larger).  I made 1/2" cubes and ended up with 85 little meatballs about an inch in diameter.  Still good, but a lot more work than needed.

My biggest complaint was that the cheese oozed out of a lot of the meatballs, and that even without olive oil I had quite a bit of oil/grease/fat at the bottom of my baking dish.  I will definitely make these again, though, because the taste is phenomenal!

Made this for dinner last night without the mozzerella cheese filling in the middle.  I stirred in a handful of fresh parmesean instead. It was great!!  Everyone was impressed and ate their entire plate.  I will make this again tons of times, I'm sure.  Thank you!  :)

This was very, very good.  I slightly altered the recipe by adding more seasonings to the meat mixture (seasoned pepper, organic non-salt seasoning, italian seasoning, onion power, and garlic powder), which made the meat very flavorable (omitted the salt) and had to use grated mozzarella since I didn't have fresh, but it turned out great, and I will definitely be using this one again!

I don't eat beef (much to my husband's dismay), so I'm always looking for good ground turkey/chicken and meat substitute recipes. I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband said they were the best meatballs I've ever made! I thought they were pretty darn good as well. I only made 1/3 the recipe, and it made enough for a meal + leftovers for 3 of us. I didn't use 1/3 egg, just threw a whole one in, and they turned out just fine.

We loved these meatballs!  I would have never thought to put pesto in meatballs, but, they gave them amazing flavor!  I had issues with the mozzarella melting out of some of the meatballs, but, I don't know that I even missed it because we thought the meatballs were that good.   My husband even told me that he would have never guessed it was ground turkey.  That is high praise from my beef loving husband!

This is the BEST turkey meatballs recipe I've ever had! I have tried other turkey recipes and they are always either too dry or lacking real flavor. Not the case with this recipe! The meatballs were very tender & juicy and packed with flavor, even without the cheese in the middle (husband &kids snacked on the cheese the day before). My husband kept saying "I can't believe these are turkey" as he ate a few before I even got them in the sauce. Thank you for the recipe, my search for the perfect meatball is finally over!!!

I made these meatballs for dinner and loved them. They had a very smooth texture and a great flavor! I never liked to make meatballs before because of the time involved but I thought these were very easy to do. I used pieces of string cheese for the mozzarella. I did not drizzle olive oil over the meatballs before baking because I was afraid the oil would splatter in the oven. About 15 minutes into the baking time, I rolled the meatballs over so that they would brown a little more evenly. I baked them on foil-lined baking sheets sprayed with cooking spray and there was no mess to clean up!

My 3 pounds of turkey and 8 ozs of motzarella made 35 stuffed and 5 unstuffed meatballs. I made a little meat pancake and wrapped the meat around the cheese. I prepped and cooked them and froze them for later use. Handy, quick homemade meal.

These meatballs are the best!  Family and friends all love them.  I make these meatballs at least once a month.  I don't change a thing about the recipe.  I bake them and then freeze them to reheat in marinara sauce.  Works like a charm!

Delicious!  Although a smidge time consuming stuffing each meatball (it made 56 for me), it was well worth it.  These are wonderful.  I used panko instead of seasoned breadcrumbs, but I followed everything else per the recipe.  Word of caution, smaller pieces of cheese are best as it tends to ooze out of the meatball in the oven, but when they taste this good, it really doesn't matter how they look!  This will definitely go in dinner rotation at my house.

These meatballs are amazing!  As a granddaughter of an Italian restaurateur, I have to say that I this is my favorite recipe.  Sorry grandma and mom.  I never thought that turkey meatballs could have such wonderful flavor and texture. I recommend that you follow the recipe exactly.

These are awesome. My family even loved them and they only eat beef. I would suggest trying them with a different sauce because the red sauce drowned out a bit of their flavor. But this recipe is definitely a keeper, in fact I'm making them again tonight!

When I made these, I did not change a thing. And they were perfect. Tender and juicy. While I was cooking spaghetti to go with, I couldn't stop eating them. However, it made entirely too much for just me and my boyfriend. I froze half and reheated them two weeks later and they were just as good. I made them a second time and added diced up pepperoni and it really complemented the mozzarella and basil.

These have been a hit both times I've made them.  I've found it easiest to stuff the cheese cube into the meatballs and fold/form the meat around them.

I followed this recipe basically to a tee, except I revised a few things based on other reviewers, one cutting back the pepper to just 1 tsp., using non-stick cooking spray instead of extra virgin olive oil, and I cut the cooking time by 5-10 minutes so as not to overcook the meatballs. I prepared my meat mixture the night before for more flavor. I used fresh mozzarella and some did seep out, but not a lot.  Mixture yielded 33 meatballs, not too small and not too big. My family and co-workers loved them.  Best meatballs I've ever eaten.

Pretty good meatballs, but if you actually make the amount they specify it's a HUGE amount of meat! We put the chopped up string cheese in the middle and that worked out well.

BEST meatball recipe I have tried, and I've tried many!  I think the pesto gives the meatballs a great punch of flavor.  And when has cheese-stuffed anything ever been a bad idea?  :)  I cheat a little bit: I use mozzarella string cheese because it's so easy to chop & stuff, and dried parsley because I always have it on hand.  I use ground beef instead of ground turkey, also.  We eat these on meatball subs (using a loaf of Pepperidge Farm cheese garlic bread, slices of Provolone cheese, and marinara) and with spaghetti, of course. You MUST try these meatballs!  They will not disappoint.

Very tasty! Followed the recipe exactly and they came out great. My 17 year old daughter who is somewhat picky loved them! This one is a keeper, thank you for a great meatball recipe with wonderful flavor! We froze the remaining meatballs and I'm looking forward to the next pasta dish with them. As other reviewers mentioned some of the mozzarella did bubble out during baking, which I was concerned about...but they still came out amazing.

This is the best meatball recipe ever!  I didn't stuff with the mozzarella (didn't have any on hand), and they were delicious.  I used a little more pesto and a little less bread crumbs than the recipe called for. Definitely a favorite!

These meatballs are delicious!!! I only had 1lb. of turkey so I only made a third of the recipe. I fried them in olive oil, I like to simmer my meatballs in the sauce, So I put a jar of sauce over them and simmered for 20 minutes covered. Only changes was I added 1tsp garlic powder, and used dried parsley. and a tlbs of parmesan bread dip seasoning, and I used a whole egg. Thanks Foodie 77

These were excellent!  My Italian husband, whose grandmother's meatballs I hear about every time I even mention meatballs, couldn't get enough of them! I forgot the salt (I do that all the time), and based on the results, I probably will just leave it out in the future, too.  Oh yes, I WILL be making these again!

My husband calls these "little balls of joy."  I concur.  I've done them with both ground turkey and ground beef (when I was out of turkey) and both came out delicious. 

Only changes I made was to use homemade sauce and I cubed the cheese and then form the meatballs around it.  Seemed much easier that way.

A little labor intensive, but oh so worth it for the "joy."

This was so good! I used beef instead of turkey and monterey jack instead of mozzarella because that's what we had and it came out deliciously moist and flavorful. It made enough for us to freeze half the batch and still have 3-4 meals' worth to put in the fridge.

Followed the recipe exactly although I only had 1 lb of  ground turkey.  I decided to do 1/2 of all the other ingredients rather than 1/3.  Came out great!  My husband said, "these  are amazing.  Imagine if we got these at a restaurant".  Now that's a good meatball.

These meatballs are so delicious!  They make a lot of leftovers for us, so my son loves that. They're easy to make.  They're good without sauce, too. My son usually steals one or two off the sheet right out of the oven because they're so yummy!

These were delicious!  They seemed a bit salty for our taste, so I will eliminate the salt next time.

So yummy! Tons of flavor and very easy prep with pantry staple ingredients. I basically made the recipe as written with no substitutions. For ease of prep and cooking I mixed in shredded mozzarella (as desired) as opposed to stuffing each meatball. I also lined a 24 mini muffin pan with silicone liners for baking. The meatballs were about 1-1.25” and baked at 375 degrees for 20 minutes (my oven bakes a little hot). Clean up was a breeze!

Great recipe!  

We had to make some changed due to a family member with food allergies.  So, we substituted the current bread crumbs with a gluten free -allergy free Italian bread crumbs  and the current basil and pine nut pesto with a different (Barilla) sun-dried tomato pesto.  All other ingredients used were local and organic and we substituted dried organic ground onion and garlic instead of fresh for a milder taste.

I cut this recipe in thirds because I only had 1 lb of meat, but I still used a whole egg, two cloves of garlic, a half cup of onion and I used crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs. They tasted absolutely fantastic. Will be using this recipe many times!

I followed the recipe and it turned out tasting so good! Really glad I tried it. I used parchment paper to cover the baking sheet. Still the meatballs got a bit crusty charred on the bottom. I think instead of 375° I should have set the oven to 350°. Anyway, I will definitely make this again.

These were delicious in a half arribata, half marinara sauce.  Husband and I both agreed it was the best spaghetti and meatballs we’ve ever had.

These were very flavorful and moist. I used ground chicken instead of turkey (because that’s what I had) and only 1lbs so I made a smaller batch. My 11 year old son ate them up as well!

Amazing! Took another reviewer’s suggestion and used oats instead of bread crumbs (pulverized and added italian seasoning). Made half w mozzarella and half without for my lactose intolerant husband. Kids wolfed these down, a huge hit in the house.

Meatballs came out great.  I didn’t have pesto so i subbed it  with Worcester sauce and a tsp of ginger. Rather than stuff it with a cheese cube i mixed in the same amount of grated cheese at the end.  Using a tablespoon to portion out each meatball made the sizes consistent.  The kids loved it. Will definitely make it again!

This is a great and easy recipe! I stumbled upon this as I had a pound and a half of ground turkey ready to expire and some rapidly wilting basil. I had to improvise as I was missing a few key ingredients and had to half the recipe. I didn’t have mozz, so I used provolone. I hate parsley so I skipped that but seasoned breadcrumbs added a nice flavor. I accidentally overlooked a bit (40 minutes vs 30) so they were a bit dry but really good. Would absolutely make these again.

My husband and I loved these meatballs.  They were moist and tender.  Since I didn't have breadcrumbs and pesto,  I substituted buttery club crackers with a little oregano for Italian bread crumbs and the  chopped basil & a little olive oil  for pesto.

These were good.  The problem was that many melted out all over the pan, luckily I had covered the pan with tin foil.  Next time I will error toward fully encapsulating the cheese with a hefty layer of meat, instead of measuring out the meat to cover the cheese.  I will definitely make again.

I was looking for a recipe that would highlight the fresh mozzarella pearls I had and this was so perfect.  We followed the recipe exactly and promptly decided these would now be our go-to Italian style meatballs.  I don't think the mozzarella stuffed inside is needed to make these meatballs awesome, but it sure made for a nice afternoon in the kitchen with the BF and really added a bit of decadence to the meal.

Made these last night to win over my ground beef addicted hubby. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried and no pesto so I just mixed the dried parsley with olive oil instead.  These were amazing!  I served them with marinara and cheese tortellini with crusty bread! Thanks for sharing!

I do not understand the excellent rates. I hardly rate recipes, but I had to do it for this one. The taste of turkey in a meatball is not really good, even adding mozzarella or extra sharp cheddar. I tried to fry them to give it more taste and really tasted bad. 

Do not try, save yourself some time.

This recipe had a lot of flavor, but not something I want very often.  It is a great recipe if you are trying to reduce red meat from your diet.  I used mozzarella cheese sticks cut in small pieces to stuff the meatballs with.  It worked really well.

I added more pesto & Italian spices & left out the milk & most of the salt. They were fabulous! A keeper & a delicious way to make turkey for my child who doesn't like red meat. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! We really enjoyed these meatballs. I took another reviewers advice and used the mozzarella pearls and it worked out terrific. I also didn't have any parsley, so I used fresh basil. I used regular sauce from a jar and will absolutely be making these again.

I made 2 easy exchanges: ground beef (instead of turkey) and gluten-free breadcrumbs. These meatballs are amazing! My kids were thinking me for making it! I made enough to freeze some for spaghetti.  I'll always make these!

The only change I made was to use my own gravy instead of bottled marinara sauce.   The meatballs were the  tasty addition to my  gravy.  The pesto and mozzarella infused meatballs made my great meatballs even better.  It was a nice surprise.  I received a lot of praise for this meal and plan to make it again.

The fam demolished these in nothing flat. They ate outrageously good. I used meatloaf mix (meat) of veal, beef, and pork, which was delish. Same recipe otherwise. This goes to the top of our faves list.

I used lean ground beef and bulk Italian sausage (1 lb of each) instead of 3 lbs of turkey, I used all the rest of the  ingredients that the recipe calls for and I got 20 even sized meatballs (using an ice cream scoop) and reheated them by simmering in a jar of Betolli's Five Cheese marinara sauce and they were the best I've ever had! I will make these again and again! My family loved them!

These ingredients all combined  together came out delicious. In the interest of time I added grated mozzarella to the mixture rather than adding cubes at the end. It still  came out moist and tasty. The only thing I would change is I would saute the onions before combining them into the mixture. Mine came out a little crunchy,  which is not pleasing to my kids palates.

This is a great recipe. I only had 2 pounds of turkey, so I added 1 pound of ground chuck. I also added coriander and worsteshire to the mix. I didn't need the milk, so I omitted it. They turned out moist and flavorful!!!  This is a must have recipe

Excellent meatballs. I followed recipe exactly.  I made them alittle bit on the large side and I think next time I'll size down.  I  followed someone else advise and added all the ingredients and mixed before adding the turkey meat.  I also wrapped the meat around the mozzarella rather than poking a hole in the meatball.  Turned out very flavorful and I had enough that I could freeze some.

Awesome! Tastes just like from an authentic Italian restaurant. I used panko crumbs instead, and no milk. Next time will try them with home made Pesto.I paired them with the best marinara sauce on here and some baguette bread.

I followed a number of suggestions of other cooks - used oatmeal (processed in food processor) rather than bread crumbs, added 1 T each of oregano  and Italian seasoning, food processed fresh collard greens (1 c.) rather than parsley.  Did not  use mozzarella cheese in the middle. Could have reduced baking time by five minutes.  The meatballs are superb. Well seasoned. Very moist.  Highly recommend.

Use regular ground beef/veal/sausage for extra flavor...nice change of pace from my authentic meatballs.

Quick and easy.  I did not add peso as I did not have any so added a tad bit more oil.  I used mozzarella sticks cut into pieces which made it easier to wrap meat around it.    The flavor is in the sauce you choose.  Will make it again

My picky husband said this was one of the best things I have ever made. Really not that hard to make and even though it takes about a half hour to prep the meatballs, completing the meal while they're cooking worked out like clockwork. I just used Jar marinara sauce like the recipe said and it tasted amazing after the meatballs had cooked in it for a few minutes. This is a recipe I'll be passing down!

These were yummy. Only had one  lb. turkey on hand, so halved the rest of the ingredients (eyeballed S&P), used one whole egg, and no milk.

I loved this dish. I just tweaked it a little bit. I used lean ground beef and Italian sweet sausage. It tasted great and it was perfect for the occasion! Thank you!!

These were the BEST meatballs I've ever made!  Savory comfort food to be sure.  As hannahelizabeth stated, it was easier for me to flatten out a meatball-sized portion of the meat mixture and wrap it around the cheese instead of stuffing it through.  Honestly, there is nothing I would change about this recipe.  You could have the meatballs as a meal without the pasta, they're THAT good.

Delicious!!  Did a trial run which we enjoyed very much!  Preparing again tomorrow night in a teen girl cooking class at church.  Simple and very tasty.  Used an ice cream scoop to make meatballs the same size; used mozzarella "string cheese" sticks cut in short sections; served over angel hair pasta in a simple tomato basil pasta sauce, delicious.  Will hang onto this one!

My family loves this recipe, always asks me to make them.  I find that flattening the meat in the ball of your hand then putting the cheese in the center, forming the meatball around the cheese works perfect. no cheese seeps out.

I made these the first time and forgot to drizzle the olive oil at the end and they were a little dry. This time I added the olive oil and they were perfect. I only cooked them 30 minutes and then froze them. This way I could pull them out as needed to feed the kids just what they want, or a whole family get together.  This is great food to have on hand always!

DELICIOUS!!  Family loved it and had enough to bring leftovers to office - co-workers all wanted the recipe.  I don't like onions so I omitted and added additional cheese and bread crumbs.  Very simple to make, didn't really take that long at all to mix together.

These were quite good for turkey meatballs...fairly simple and fast to put together (although the assembly was slightly time consuming).  I would put in more pesto next time.  Cooking time was perfect for a crispy outside and completely done inside.

As these were baking, some of the cheese melted out, but it didn't seem to affect the appearance or taste of these delicious meatballs.  Very good with or without pasta.  I will certainly make these again.  They were a hit with my husband!

These are a staple in our house.  I didn't have pesto so I just used a handfull of fresh basil instead.  I also skip to mozza in the middle.

My picky 7 year old and my husband, who hates ground turkey, both loved it. Some tips:
- Used raw mozzarella. Fantastic and more gourmet but think mozzarella sticks would have been fine.
- Used Ians Italian gluten free bread crumbs and no one was the wiser.
- Budget tips: Used defrosted turkey I bought on sale and was actually better because it was thick/cold, also made my own 1/4 c of pesto in blender- a few basil leaves, parm cheese, lemon juice and some pine nuts. 
- My seven year old (picky) and my husband (not a turkey fan) both loved these.
- I cute the recipe to 5 servings and it made 12 medium-large sized meatballs; our family of 3 ate 9 as size was large and the cheese is filling.
- I used Newman's Own organic marinara sauce

Bon appetite!

These were great but I did have a lot of the cheese leaking out of the meatballs unfortunately. I thought I had  covered the cheese quite well. Next time I will try to cover the cheese more completely.  Tasty!

Did not stuff with mozzarella. They were just ok by themselves but when I added a coating of light alfredo and shredded mozz and parmesan, then warmed in oven they were the bomb! Add a little milk to mixture if sauce cools too much between making and reheating.

Great, but was a bit too spicy with all the pepper.  I chose to keep it lighter and eliminate the mozzarella, but it was really flavorful for turkey meatballs.  Next time, I'll cut the amount of pepper in half.

Great recipe! Everyone enjoyed these.  I did not have pesto, so just added a little oil and fresh basil.  I did the wrapping the meat around the cheese technique, worked well.  Some cheese came out during cooking, but not too much.  I made my meatballs a little bigger then the recipe and used those small/medium sized fresh mozzarella balls in the middle, which worked really well.  Will definitely make again, this recipe is a keeper!

This was AMAZING!!  I'm always looking for something different.  I only had shredded cheese, but I made it work.  I can see where the chunks would be much easier.  Was a little worried about the pesto and almost left it out due to kids, but soooo glad I didn't.  I made a quick homemade sundried tomato pesto, (I do not recommend the pre-made).  And a homemade marinara, which takes only a few minutes while the meatballs are cooking. This meal was delicious.  My kids came back for 2nds and 3rds.  Thanks so much for sharing it.

Excellent!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it was great! I did form the meatball around the mozzarella piece as others have suggested.  Yummy!

I made yesterday for a tailgate and everyone loved them. It made 50 (2 bite size) meatballs. As others suggested, I added extra pesto and Parmesan cheese. I did not add the mozzarella in the center, because others complained of oozing and I didn't want that in the crockpot. I will try it next time. I cooked the meatballs on plain parchment for 25 minutes, with no olive oil and they cooked perfectly and didn't get dark on the bottom. I served these in a crock pot with Trader Joes basil marinara and little rolls for those that wanted a sandwich. They were perfect.

These came out great, except I hate jarred sauce. So I make my own.   I also used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 ground chuck.  Because I used the beef, there was no need for oil to bake them in the oven.  And I used string cheese for the mozzarella because it's easier to cut and then the cheese won't leak out

This is a great recipe.  Easy, and we made it exactly as written. Just note that this recipe makes a LOT, so adjust proportions as needed.  Our grocery store carried Bel Gioioso brand fresh mozzarella in the deli section, including the "Pearls" which are tiny little balls just perfect for stuffing into the meatballs.  We will definitely make again.

This is my new favorite ground turkey recipe. I didn't make any changes to the recipe but did take someone's advice to assemble the meatball around the mozzarella.  I had all the ingredients on hand; turkey, mozzarella and pesto from Costco.  Inexpensive AND delicious.  This one's a winner!!!

These are excellent!  I've made these twice following the recipe exactly and they have such a restaurant quality taste! The only thing I would caution is to be aware of the salt content.  Most brands of prepared pesto, parmesan cheese, and mozzarella cheese either have salt in them or are made with salt during the cheese preserving process. This recipe calls for the *addition* of salt and can leave you with an overwhelming salty result if you don't adjust for the amount already present in these products. Other than that, these meatballs are PERFECT!

This was wonderful.  I adjusted the recipe to 2lbs of meat - used 1lb turkey and 1lb mild sausage.  It made approx 16 pretty large meatballs.  Everything else was the same.  The meat balls were super moist and most of the cheese stayed inside!  We ate half and I am freezing the other half another dinner.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

Excellent!  I changed serving to 1/3 and omitted the pesto and mozzarella but I added 2 spicy Italian sausages (casing removed) and a splash of olive oil.  I made into a meatball sub.

I'm the "italian friend" in the bunch so when I cook anything that has to do with a pasta dish I get all of the pressure to create something amazing. My friends definitely loved it and my husband voiced his praise which isn't easy to make him do! They said they didn't know turkey could be so flavorful, but I always use turkey over beef when I can. A lot of reviewers seem to be omitting the pesto but it is so worth using. I just scoop the turkey mixture with my little 1/4 cup measuring scoop and pressed the cheese right in, scooped it out with a spoon and pat them into shape. They went great with some chunky sauce and I stir-fried some green string beans with olive oil, garlic, and lemon pepper, so good.

This is a great recipe and easy to fix, even with substitutions. In place of Italian bread crumbs, we used crushed corn flakes with Italian seasoning and poultry seasoning. They still tasted delicious! And my husband loves pesto, turkey and cheese so this is a winner. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was a tasty base for a meatball and I made just as listed. I baked one batch and the cheese oozed out of all them. Next I tried larger meatballs with the same amount of cheese and the same thing happened. There really wasn't any melty cheese in the middle so it was just a regular meatball with cheese baked on to my pan. 
That being said, this was the best turkey meatball recipe I have tried so far. 5 stars if someone can tell me how to keep the cheese inside!

Love this! I was able to form meatballs even though I used ground turkey breast and thanks to the pesto mixed in and mozzarella inside, they were not dry at all. I did not drizzle with olive oil to save calories, just used cooking spray in the pan so they would not stick. I served with zucchini "noodles" and homemade marinara sauce. So delicious my hubby was not even aware they were healthy. Score! LOL

I made the recipe EXACTLY as stated above. The meatballs held together well, but I felt they were a bit bland. Great recipe otherwise! The second time I made them, I adjusted them slightly for stronger flavor. I add about 1 tbs. Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp. salt. I also like to double the pesto and garlic cloves for a stronger flavor. I fry the meatballs until brown and crisp on all sides in a pan with the olive oil instead of baking them, I like a more browned exterior per my preference. I finish the meatballs off by simmering them in my home made tomato sauce for longer than 2 mins, I like simmering them for 30 mins - 1 hour, this helps them get tender and flavorful. :-)

These meatballs are amazing.  So moist, so flavourful! Kids loved it.  Paired with Best Marinara Sauce recipe from this site.  I used Panko crumbs instead of Italian Breadcrumbs and whisked all ingredients together before mixing with turkey. Going to make these into meatball subs tomorrow night!

I have difficulty getting my boyfriend to eat anything other than red meat. My boyfriend agreed to eat this again, which isn't common if it isn't beef.  Therefore I Highly recommend this recipe! We used dried parsley and just used a little less of it, since I had it in the cupboard and it taste fine that way also.

This was my first attempt at making meatballs. It was surprisingly fun with pretty quick prep and its easy! They were delicious, moist and didn't fall apart. Everyone that tried them just last week is already asking for them again. The only change/addition I made: I also added chopped spinach to it. Yummy! Will make this many times. EDIT: Have now made several times and get asked for these constantly!

This was a big hit with the family!  Kids especially liked finding a surprise in their meatballs!  I especially liked being able to do all the work ahead of time.  I made the meatballs the night before and refridgerated them.  Baked them the next day and added to sauce.  Such and easy meal!

These were just ok for me.  I used fresh mozzarella.  The people that used the cut up string cheese might be on to something.

Loved it, only made a few minor changes but I end up tweaking every recipe problem is I don’t every right the changes down, and because I didn’t  have bread crumbs, used crackers. Choose to make it lower calorie version, it was so good I can’t wait to make it again, thanks for sharing!

Easy prep, don't be intimidated with all the ingredients and preparation steps.  They taste fantastic and really have a perfect balance of ingredients.  The recipe makes enough that you'll have a few leftover to eat the next day or freeze for a rainy day.

These meatballs are AMAZING. They are easy to make, tender, and flavorful! I made them pretty much exactly as the recipe instructed but I used cut up mozzarella string cheese sticks and wrapped the meat around the cheese as I rolled the balls rather than rolling the balls and poking a hole after. Much easier that way! Fantastic, will make these over and over again.

I didn't have any pesto or parsley on hand, and used a 3 cheese blend instead of the parmigiano, but made the recipe as is otherwise. Delicious! Truly a hit. The meatballs were moist and flavorful. We love garlic/onion so added a bit more and put some good sized pieces of mozzarella in the centers. Great recipe - will definitely be repeated in our home.

These tasted pretty good and came together faster than I anticipated.  I made some changes to suit the size of our family and the ingredients I had on hand. I used lean ground beef instead of ground turkey, and only 2 lbs. Even with reducing the meat I was still able to make 15 balls. Since I used less meat I scaled back the other ingredients and used about 2/3 of what was called for, except for the egg. I didn't have parmigiano-reggiano cheese so I substituted Parmesan. I only used 1 jar of spaghetti sauce. To save on dishes I just poured the sauce over the meatballs for the last 10 min of cooking time and it mixed well with a little grease in the pan. Cooking time was adjusted to 40 min since I made the meatballs a little larger than specified. But it turned out well and my family of 8 said it was delicious!

These are so good! I used shredded mozz to stuff, cut the recipe down to 1 lb of turkey and added additional spices - as my family prefers. Turned out terrific. I also used a bit more olive oil to top the turkey balls. They cooked perfectly. Yum!

Super-flavorful!  I cut the recipe in 1/3 for just the two of us and cheated... mozzarella "pearls" instead of cutting a ball of mozz.  Even picky hubby loved them!

These were fabulous! We cut up some string cheese and put it in the middle (that was what we had) and it still turned out yummy, although next time we will go with the fresh mozzarella! Served with plain red sauce and noodles although they were good on their own or would even make a great meatball sub!

Amazing! Add less pepper if you don't want the pepper kick. And if you don't have, or want to use, the mozzarella cheese, leave it out. The meatballs are great!!

These are absolutely delicious, easy to make, and after the first time made it to my biweekly dinner menu. I typically cook for myself, and like others mentioned these reheat very well. Moreover you can make some and store them for a day or two in the refrigerator to have them fresh later; if it's going to be longer than that, they freeze just fine. Full disclosure: I don't like pesto, so I omit it and use a little bit of basil instead. The only reason this got 4 instead of 5 stars is that after having made it 5 times, I still can't get the cheese to not explode out of the meatball, and subsequently burn on the pan.

These were fantastic - both my in-laws and kids loved them! I made fresh pesto sauce and added it to the meatballs. I also browned the meatballs after baking them and then added the marinara sauce. Terrific flavor. Will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe. I added an extra half cup of flour to thicken the mixture and used Oats instead of breadcrumbs and it came out nice.

I also used less low fat cheese to lower the calories and put the Mozzarella on top of the meatballs instead of in it.

Very delish....  Made 2 batches.  Only thing I recommend is turning them over half way through cooking. I didn't flip the first batch and they got pretty crunchy on the bottom.

This recipe was extremely delicious.  One of my kids is sending a sample in to the Guinness book for "tastiest meatball."  I normally throw my own flare on a recipe, but not today.  I did however make some for myself using vegetarian "crumbles" and they were just as good I'm sure.  Definitely a keeper!
