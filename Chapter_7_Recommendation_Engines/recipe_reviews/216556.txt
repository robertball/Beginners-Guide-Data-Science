With only 1/3 cup sugar, it's a little tart, but a very nice change from the typical cranberry sauce with three times that much sugar.  The dried cranberries add another layer of texture, and the minced orange peel brightens up the flavor.  Very nice change from the standard T-Day cranberry sauce.

I got this recipe from Bon Appetit years ago.  The only difference is the sugar is increased to 1/2 cup and use a combination of 3/4 C total of dried cranberries and dried cherries and put 1 or 2 cinnamon sticks in.  My family absolutely loves this recipe and it is a must every Thanksgiving and Christmas!!  Beautiful in a crystal serving bowl.  Keeps well for 4 weeks (I have used it even beyond 4 weeks)

This is absolutely delicious. I made it today to see if it was worthy of our Thanksgiving table and it did not disappoint. People saying it is too tart are incorrect or perhaps they substituted. The key is really the cranberry juice concentrate. It is a must in the success of this recipe because it adds a burst of  sweetness. I also diced my orange peel very small and the marmalade I used came with rind in it as well. It made for a delicious cranberry sauce. PS: don't leave out the allspice. I really think it adds a savory dimension to this delicious recipe. Enjoy folks and thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

It is delicious....I will definitely make this again!  I added a generous tablespoon of pure maple syrup and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla paste while it was cooling to sweeten it up a bit.  

I did not have cranberry juice concentrate so used one cup of the cranberry juice that we had in the fridge.  

Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I skipped the marmalade and allspice, and used all fresh-squeezed orange juice instead of concentrate for this recipe. We had a ton of home-grown oranges in the fridge, so that was what made sense for us. I just increased the amount of sugar by about 1 1/2 tablespoons to compensate. I also added some orange zest to the pot with the orange juice for extra oomph. I didn't bother mincing the orange peel, and just left them in tiny slices. I've used the other cranberry sauce recipe with just OJ, cranberries and sugar for many years now, but wanted to change things up. I also wanted to find a recipe with slightly less sugar, since my family likes their sauce very tart. It tasted much more refined and elegant, and was delicious to boot!

Excellent recipe.  I just found this to be a great fusion of cranberry flavors with the combination of the cranberries, dried cranberries, marmalade, and orange juice.  It set beautifully, and was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner.

This was fabulous! I couldn't find cranberry juice concentrate anywhere in my area, so I bought cranberry-raspberry. At another reviewer's suggestion, I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup, and a dried cranberry-cherry-blueberry mix to 3/4 cup, and threw in one cinnamon stick while cooking. I used clementine tangerine juice (because I love tangerine juice!) and honeybell tangerine marmalade.  It's the best cranberry sauce I've ever made, by far. My husband agrees, and he loves cranberry sauce. This will be my holiday recipe from now on! Thanks :)

Tart is right! I am going back to add more sugar, as bichon's review suggested. The tartness of the cranberries totally overshadows the orange flavor. It needs more balance.

I have changed the recipe and added whole cranberry sauce and cranberry juice instead of the frozen juice.  Instead of orange marmalade I use orange rind to add the citrus flavor.  My family loves this sauce.

This recipe has great flavor, but it's too tart for my liking. I would make it again and add more sugar.

I would make this again, but without the sugar, or maybe half as much brown sugar instead. This is similar to one I make just that way. I add dried cherries to it.
