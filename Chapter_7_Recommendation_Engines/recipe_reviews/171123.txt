Was pretty good, however I think it should be on something other than steak. Pork would be good.

Excellent recipe!  I used Merlot and a 14oz bag of dried, pitted cherries.

This tastes great. I added ginger garlic pimento spice blend onto the steaks. Used dried, pitted cherries re-hydrated in some red wine. The wine almost evaporated completely while simmering so I added 35% cooking cream to get some sauce out of it. It turned out pleasantly sweet, but not overpowering. The steaks needed a little more seasoning in my opinion.

Was craving cherries so I made this with my boyfriend.  He was skeptical of the fruit/vanilla with steak but we both loved it!  I used dried cherries and red Zin.  Wonderful!

My partner and I didn't care for this at all, we ended up just eating the steak without the sauce.  To those who like this... all the power to ya :D

A couple changes to suit my guests taste-

I used 1 cup fresh dark cherries (remove pits) and added 1 cup frozen peaches and 2 T organic turbinado sugar. Reduced this in 2 cups of water. At half way point of reduction I added the Worcestershire and reduced that by half. Then I added 1/4 cup of red wine and 1/2 cup Brandy and reduced to au sec. Removed from heat and pureed in blender. Deleted the corn starch and vanilla altogether. Topped a center cut pork tenderloin chop with sauce. Amazing to say the least.
