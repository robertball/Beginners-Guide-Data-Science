As soon as I read this recipe, I knew it was a winner. My husband went right out and picked up what ingredients we didn`t have.  The soup is easy and delicious. We added an onion to the hamburger to brown out of habit.

Plenty of positive reviews and I agree that this is a great easy recipe for a cold winter day. Just want folks to know I made it substituting 2 cups beef broth for the half & half and heavy cream and reduced the amount of Velveeta. It still turned out great!

Wow - this was fantastic.  My whole family loved it.  I added onions and garlic to the ground beef while cooking.  Put it all in the crock pot and let it cook all day.  Also added some pepper flakes to give it a small kick.  YUM!  will make this again and again

There's a ton I would change about this, but since I'm rating the base recipe--here we go.
The heavy cream on top of the ranch and cheese and dairy upon dairy upon dairy...ugh. It's super heavy. The flavor is pretty good, but not a recipe I can add to my go tos.

Delicious! Reminds me of a yummy dip. I made it twice in one week, but use hot italian sausage the second time. I'll definitely make both ways again. :0)

The only thing I would say is to maybe use a half of a can of the Rotel tomato and chiles because goodness it will have a kick to it. Besides that it is pretty good especially with some chips.

It really is very good and easy to make, but really heavy.  I would suggest using it as a side, rather than the main course.  I've made it for our family and for church potlucks and every time I get huge compliments.  I've never been disappointed in this recipe.

This soup was amazing!!! My family loved it!!! I didn't have a pint of heavy cream so I used 2 pints of half and half, I also only had about 4 oz. Of Velveeta so I used shredded Mexican 4 cheese blend along with the little bit of Velveeta. And instead of using ground beef I used shredded chicken breast. It was soooo good!!!! I will make this again and again!!! :-)

I have this going in the crockpot for the Iowa Hawkeyes football game tonight.  I snuck a little taste and it was DELICIOUS!!!   My house smells wonderful, too.   I am going to serve it with taco chips, jalape√±os, sour cream, and onion.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was phenomenal! Definitely 5 stars. The only thing I did differently was add in some onion and green pepper, but that was a personal preference and not a necessity. Oh and I used turkey burger instead of ground beef as I always do. This dish is packed with flavor. The texture/consistency of everything combined is excellent. The corn has a lot to do with that because it adds a little crunch to the softness of the beans and tomatoes and the creamy/cheesy consistency of the soup itself. Wonderful. Thanks for sharing.

I have tried a few different variations of taco soup, but never had much luck.  I finally found a winner.  I came across this because I had some velveeta to use up and searched by ingredient.  This soup is so flavorful.  So many of the others just tasted like tomato, but this one with the ranch and velveeta was just perfect.  My wife loved it as well stating it had a good, rich flavor.  Going to be making this one again for sure.  Thanks!

My whole family loved this recipe! I did change a couple of things-I used fat-free milk in place of the heavy cream and only used 8oz of velveeta instead of 16oz.  My version was probably not as thick as the original but it still tasted great and saved a ton of calories.
