I can't truly rate this as written because I could not find pre-made cannoli shells anywhere and didn't have time to make or order them.  However, I substituted puff pastry cups instead, and they were amazing!  This filling is absolutely fantastic.  I'm brainstorming other ways  to use it!

These are really yummy, and they taste like a pumpkin pie cannoli! I even made my own shells using the shell portion of "Cannoli" recipe by Lydia Nacawa (also on this site). These would be a great dessert for Thanksgiving. I used mini  chocolate chips on the ends, rather than sprinkles. Would make these again. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I was looking for something different to serve as dessert on Thanksgiving, in place of the pumpkin pies.   I found this recipe and did a test run over the weekend for some dinner guests and the results were awesome!  The consistency of the filling was light with just the right amount of pumpkin pie spice to compliment the pumpkin flavor.    I thought I would try filling them the night before and admittedly the shells were slightly soft, but still good.  If you have the time, I would recommend filling them the same day as you'll be serving them, otherwise the night before still produces a delicious dessert.

Wow, made this tonight.  It is the best pumpkin cannoli I've ever tasted.  I'm bringing to a party tomorrow, but hubs and I couldn't resist tasting this evening.  I didn't change a thing, no need to (unless making my own pumpkin spice could be counted).  I have made filling following traditional recipes, but the addition of mascarpone and whipped cream make this recipe a ten star.  I will use it without pumpkin, but adding traditional mini chips, etc. in the future.

Excellent variation on traditional Cannoli.  I made this for Christmas brunch and it was a huge hit with my family.  I was lucky to get a taste myself.

Awesome recipe!  I bought pre-made shells at an Italian bakery and followed recipe exactly except I added an extra tsp of pumpkin pie spice (which I made myself).  Also sprinkled tiny chocolate chips on the ends after filling.  These turned out delicious!

The cannolis were tasty but I dislike a recipe which uses part of a box of pudding, part of a can of pumpkin,  part of the smallest container of ricotta you can get and part of a container of muscarpone.  You would have to triple the recipe to use all of the ingredients.  Unfortunate.

I paired it with graham crackers and we ate it as a dip instead of in canolli shells. We had a hard time finding the pre made shells.

Sounds very nice. I want to know if can substitute arrowroot powder, or anything else, for the instant vanilla pudding in the recipe and in what amount? 
Also, can the filling be frozen? Thanks.

I, too, decided not to get pre-made shells. I considered getting some tubes and making them, but I was already making rosettes and the batter/process is similar, so I made timbale shells instead. But this filling is heavenly and the treats were a big time hit at Christmas dinner!

Turned out better than I thought it would have. The pumpkin wasn't over powering and it was less sweat than a regular cannoli , which is a good thing.

I added more spices to this recipe. Cinnamon, nutmeg, clove....all the same ones I put in my pumpkin pie. Then, they were amazing! Don't fill the shells with pastry cream until they are ready to be eaten, or else they turn soggy.

Took these to an early Thanksgiving Social and they were a big hit!!!  Will certainly be making them again.  Didn't change a thing.
