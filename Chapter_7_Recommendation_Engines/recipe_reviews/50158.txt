I made this for a baby shower and we went through two large pitchers.  For a pretty touch, I floated frozen raspberries.  It makes it looks a little fancier and helps keep it cool without diluting.

I used store brand apple juice and sparkling water, and liked this very much. I like to crush the mint leaves a little, and stir them into my drink. Thanks!
