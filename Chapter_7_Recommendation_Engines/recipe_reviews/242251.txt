I like the texture of these little muffins they are nice and moist  (I made them in small loaf type muffin pan).  I added chopped walnuts and had 3 bananas, so added them all, didn't find the banana overpowering, in fact only had a slight banana flavour,  I grated bakers chocolate on top while warm just prior to serving.  For those of you not watching cholesterol.....butter is nice while warm as well ...mmmm.

Simple and very good! I opted to make this into cupcakes and got 13 out of the recipe, which was perfect. Frosted w/ chocolate frosting, but want to try a cream cheese frosting next time. Really good flavor, maybe a touch dry, but I may have over-baked them by a minute or 2 (baked them for 20 mins.)...should've checked them sooner. All in all, I would make these again, as the family liked them! Thanks for sharing. :)
