A delicious and interesting twist on plain old cole slaw. I prepared this for two large summer parties recently and it was widely complimented. Several people went out of their way to say that they don't normally like cole slaw but loved this recipe. I did make a few changes, however. I increased the blue cheese to give it a little more bite...about 1/2 cup in the dressing with additional sprinkled on top. Also, I added salt and pepper (maybe this addition is just sort of "understood" but it wasn't in the recipe). Finally, I added about 3/4 cup of toasted, coarsely chopped pecans.

Best coleslaw I have ever tasted!  The Blue Cheese gives this recipe a nice zest, and
the grapes give it enough sweetness.  I would have never believed I would enjoy 
coleslaw this much!

Although I am not a particular "fan" of slaw, I did somewhat like this; however, I felt that it needed more blue cheese (of which I am a "fan"!); and even though I really like Dijon mustard, I felt that there was a bit of an overpowering taste of the mustard; maybe needs just a tad less.  My husband liked it, most particularly because of the grapes!  Will try it again.

This is really good!  The blue cheese kind of melts into the dressing for a pretty subtle flavor.  I halved the mustard and went light on the sugar, and we really enjoyed the results!

I made this for a friend's 4th of July party and it was a big hit. You have to like blue cheese but the flavor combinations were wonderful. I will definately make it again. Also it was wonderful the next day.

Yum!  This is the best cole slaw I have ever prepared. Very quick and easy.  Instead of a bag mix I had red and green cabbage on hand and shredded it myself. This will be going to the next pitch-in or picnic.

This is a really simple delicious cole slaw! The blue cheese adds a creamy, tangy taste. 
A few things we changed: no grapes (for diet restrictions and also too sweet for my husband's taste); I halved the recipe and used less mayo and more mustard (again for diet restrictions); didn't have cider vinegar so used white wine vinegar which was fine. Also, instead of using just a cabbage cole slaw, I used a "stir fry" mix which was basically cabbage, carrots and zucchini.  Served it with steak and it was absolutely perfect! See picture.

Great slaw which turns Carolinas into a pseudo-gourmet meal! Omitted the carrots (grapes were sweet enough), and added a pinch of salt and pepper at the end.

Since I do not like blue cheese, I omitted the grapes and blue cheese and it made an awesome plain cole slaw!  (My husband is not crazy about mayo so I only used 3/4 cup.)

I loved this but I had to double the blue cheese.  Edit:  Just for my own information next time:  This CAN be made ahead of time and sit without getting gross.

Excellent! 
Everyone loved it.  I have made this three times and always a hit.  Added some chopped pecans the last time and doubled the bleu cheese.

This is O.K. It is definitely not a vinegrette dressing. It's more like a heavy blue cheese salad
dressing over cabbage. I probably will not make again or recommend it to others.

I've made this twice.  Everyone likes it...even those of us who don't normally like blue cheese!  I've had multiple request for the recipe.  I didn't change anything except perhaps I added a bit mor cheese than the recipe calls for.  This will definitely be a repeat summer recipe.

This slaw was Wonderful.  We love Blue cheese, so I used extra; and realized after I made it that my 
Dijon mustard has horseradish in it.  Gave it a nice kick.  Will make again and hopefully take to my next gathering.

Loved this recipe.  Followed the directions except to omit the grapes as I was trying to replicate a local restaurant's cole slaw and they don't use grapes.  Also reduced mustard by 1/2.  Thanks!

This is great cole slaw!  The sweetness of the grapes pairs perfectly with the blue cheese.  I will be making this again and again.

We've been doing low carb, and both my husband and I really like this cole slaw.  I've made it several times.  If you don't like blue cheese, however - don't bother.  It gives the slaw a strong but wonderful flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was excellent but I changed it a bit to work better out of our kitchen the next time. I used crushed pineapple instead of the grapes (much easier) and used a chunky blue cheese salad dressing instead of the mayo and crumbled cheese. Tasted great on my pulled pork sandwiches.

Very Good! We enjoyed the flavor combination of the grapes and the tangy blue cheese. I added a bit more blue cheese crumbles and followed the rest exactly. We found it a bit too wet for our taste so next time I think I will decrease the amount of mayo and dijon a bit. Otherwise very tasty.

This was excellent.  We really enjoyed it, even my husband who hates bleu cheese.  I didn't use all of the dijon figuring I could add more if it needed it, but I didn't think it did.

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe.  The blue cheese dressing was too strong and heavy.  I was disappointed because I love blue cheese.  I think I would have liked it better with a vinagrette dressing with blue cheese on top.

I loved this.  My bag of slaw was only 10oz so I skimped a little on the mayo and mustard.  Otherwise, I followed to a t except for adding more blue cheese.  We love it.  I thought this was really tasty and different.  If you like blue cheese add more if not add less.  Thanks for sharing.

ABSOLUTELY PHENMOMENAL!! This slaw could be something on a restaurant menu.The grapes are the perfect sweet compliment to the tangy blue cheese! I didn't have dijon mustard on hand so I used yellow mustard instead.I also doubled the blue cheese. Turned out beautifully, absolutely perfect!!

It was OK, but I think that I would prefer a dressing without mustard for this type of cole slaw. I also blanched the cabbage prior - still crisp, but not as raw. All I did was boil water and poor it over the cabbage in a strainer.

This is one of my "go to" recipes, I've made it several times.  I will make it the day before so the flavors blend and it saves time.  I love it on Allrecipes North Carolina BBQ!  Sometimes I will toast walnuts or pecans, and set them in a bowl next to the slaw so folks can add them to the slaw if they wish... and I will put fresh blue cheese in another bowl if someone wants more cheese....

Really enjoyed this coleslaw.  Did not add carrot as my coleslaw mix had carrot in it.  Also, added more blue cheese.  Will be making this again.

My husband asked that we never have another slaw in our house. This recipe is phenomenal. I added more blue cheese and mustard than was called for, and used broccoli slaw rather than cabbage - but those were the only things I changed. Love it.

We were invited to a friends house for wings and I was looking for something that would compliment them.  This was a great choice.  It is very quick and easy to make.  Based on other reviews the only changes made were a good squirt of Dijon mustard and double the blue cheese.  This will definitely be a go to recipe from now on. Enjoy!

I have made this recipe several times and always get rave reviews!  I do not add the shredded carrot since the coleslaw mix I use already has carrot in it.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe. This is also good served as a topping on barbecue sandwiches.

Loved the slaw dressing.  Had to improvise as I didn't have dried mustard.  So, I crushed fresh mustard seeds and added yellow mustard from the squeeze jar.  Husband and 2.5 year old loved it.

This an outstanding recipe though I did adjusted the mayo to 3/4 cup and dijon mustard to 1/8 cup. The tangy dressing balances the sweetness of the grapes.

This coleslaw was delicious. Instead of grapes, I used dried cranberries. The sweetness and soft texture complimented the tangy dressing and crunch of the slaw. Excellent dressing. I'll make this cole slaw again soon.

Sometimes,we enjoy the simplicity of a blue cheese addition to our normal tasting coleslaw. Maytag blue cheese is wonderfully creamy without having to much bite. Although it is expensive. Have yet to try it with the mustard and grapes.  I have used chopped Granny Smith apples with the blue cheese instead and we really enjoyed that.

A local restaurant serves blue cheese cole slaw and it's a favorite of theirs.  I thought I would see if I could find a recipe and came up with this one.  Served it to my bunco club and everyone LOVED it!!  I didn't change a thing except added a little more blue cheese (cuz I love it!) and sprinkled a little on top.  YUMMY!

I've made this slaw a number of times for large groups and everyone loves it. The Blue Cheese gives it a great twist, however, I use a combination of Feta and Gorganzola in place of the "Blue" Cheese. It's wonderful.

I did not like this at all! sorry. the mustard was way overpowering..I even added more sugar & blue cheese. I would use less mustard..I do have to say my guests really liked it but I won't be making it again.

This was a big hit in my family and friends. What a great change from the ordinary slaw. If you enjoy blue cheese you will love this. I did add approx. 1/2 cup of blue cheese really according to your taste.

Very yummy, although I think I'll use a little less mayo next time, it came out a little too moist;  I added some toasted almonds, which I definitely recommend, and didn't use carrots.

Very good.  Only change I made was to use about 1/2 cup of crumbled blue cheese.  Some suggested using bigger chunks or cubes of blue cheese instead of crumbled but all enjoyed very much.

Excellent recipe; before making this I had reservations as to how it would taste with blue cheese and grapes?? I, along with my guests, were really suprised as to how good this was. This is a "keeper"!

Oh this was fantastic!!! I used grainy Dijon instead of regular because I didn't have any but other than that, I didn't change a thing.  I definitely will make this again.

I found this recipe on a day that I wanted a different side dish and as I'm a lover of bleu cheese I had to try it. I substitued the 1cup of mayo for 1/2 cup of mayo & 1/2 cup of plain yogurt. Instead of the crumbled bleu cheese I used 1/2 cup of bleu cheese dressing. I nixed the vinegar completely and only used 1 tablespoon of sugar. My last sub was 2 cups replumped raisins(orange or lemon juice is perfect for this) instead of grapes. My kids and their friends loved it and so did I!

I loved this!  I added about 1 C of toasted pecans, used half mayo and half sour cream, and also added a little minced shallot.  Used a tip from another review about quickly blanching the slaw mix.  Made it for Memorial Day and everyone wanted the recipe.

I liked this better than my husband. Thought it was extremely easy to prepare. I reduced the recipe to four servings and some of the measurements were off so I just eyeballed and used my own judgement. Added more blue cheese.
