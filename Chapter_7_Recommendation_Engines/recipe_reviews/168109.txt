Gee-I think I made this burger when I was 12! However, my husband, who is Mr. Plain Jane likes his burgers this way. As my 7 year old daughter says:"Boring Snoring"!

This is pretty good for a cheeseburger. Nothing fancy, just pure simple chargrilled beef. I added some A1 in the meat too and topped with sliced pickles. I just can't give this one more than 3 stars though since there is no originality or creativity involved with this recipe.

My review 'mysteriously' disapeared from this recipe. I guess they can't take a little criticism. Either way, I did not care for this burger..
