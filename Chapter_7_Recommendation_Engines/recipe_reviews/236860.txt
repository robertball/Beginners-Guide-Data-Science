Easy.  Delicious.  Decadent.

First, I should mention that I hate to cook.  The general consensus is that I'm also a terrible cook, so I almost never do it.  My friends actually encourage me to bring the paper products and the potato chips to pot luck meals.  (It is an unspoken and widely felt, "Please don't bring anything that you cooked.")

I tell you all of this, so you'll know that *I mean it* when I say that this dish is easy and delicious.  It is worth the scant amount of effort required, and it is fool-proof.  (The hardest part is paying for the leeks at my local grocer, Whole Paycheck.)  This recipe is so good and so easy that I'm tempted to take it to the next pot-luck, so I can bask in the compliments that I am sure to receive.

We ate this with Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken [recipe from this site, plus added chicken broth to the basting juice per the advice of a helpful reviewer] and Barley cooked in Chicken Broth.  The citrus in the chicken worked well with this rich leek dish.

Watch the video:  it will help!  Chef John's videos are fun to watch, and he has lots of great advice.

I made these twice and both times they turn out awesome.  And yes a nice piece or two of bread a glass of the wine you cooked with and everyone was in heaven.  The secret is the quality of the ingredients.  If you don't drink the white wine then don't cook with it.  Use more stock instead of cheap bitter tasting wine. As for the left overs I used them on a own made pizza, little olive oil some garlic, the leeks spread around in byte size nuggets bit of cheese oh so delicious.

I needed to use up some leeks I purchased for another recipe I did not use. Boy, am I glad that happened because this was great! Thanks Chef John!

Chef John,  as a complete freak of leeks this is a WONDERFUL recipe!  The way it's made and the way it turns out is spectacular.  It is the kind of dish you sit back after each bite and savor the richness (not heavy) and the complex tastes. The Pancetta is so incredibly awesome.  Wow!  A few of these and a glass of wine and some smooth jazz and you have yourself a high-end restaurant night at home.
Bravo Chef!

Oh my this was good - so good that even my kids ate some and they aren’t fans of leek. I did make two minor adjustments - no wine (I was out of white) and I cut the leeks in half as well as lengthwise to fit them nicely in my dish. Highly recommend and will be making again when I have leeks to use up.

This was sooo good!  I didn't have the cream or pancetta, so I substituted plain Greek yogurt and bacon, and it was delicious.  Next time I might cut the leeks into smaller pieces, just because they are difficult to cut, and that might make them easier to eat.

Perhaps not fair for me to give a review, since I really used this as a launching point and changed a lot... but it turned out great.  I just used what I had on hand as substitutions.  Swapped out the pancetta for a slice of bacon on top of each leek half.  I didn't have any wine, just just left that out entirely.  Crumbled up some smoked gouda instead of the parm.  Added just a splash (maybe 3-4 tablespoons of cream) for the sake of "healthy".   I'll make this again in a heartbeat.  Next time I hope to have all the correct ingredients on hand so that I can follow the recipe.  I'll also probably be making a double batch.

I only had cheap Riesling wine and parmesan in a tub and it was still delicious!  Even my husband who doesn't like veggies loved it!

A leek is a fibrous vegetable. This recipe is five star all the way! I halved the recipe and that was my supper last night. I shamelessly ate every single bite and used some French bread to wipe my plate clean. I could have gotten away without having to put it in the dishwasher, it was that good!

This recipe did not work well for me. The leeks turned out stringy and difficult to eat. I will purée the leftovers to use as a soup base. I probably won't try thi recipe again.

So very good! Made this as a side for an early Father's Day lunch.  It was a huge hit.  None of them had ever eaten a leek before but after the first bite, went back for more.  I made as directed with just a few changes.  Used prosciutto (store didn't have any pancetta), used the parmesan in the green can (don't particularly care for parmigiano-reggiano) and 1 cup of broth instead of 1/4 cup by mistake.  Even with the subs and extra liquid, it turned out great.  It's a keeper.  Thanks Chef John!!!
