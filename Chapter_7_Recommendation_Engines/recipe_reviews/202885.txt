Excellent! The only "tweaks" I made were to add a can (16oz) of black beans to the filling, and garnished with some sour cream and fresh cilantro. I served this with Mexican rice. My girlfriend and I loved them!

These were very good!  Always skeptical of trying recipes that haven't been reviewed yet...but this one I couldn't pass up, since I have a load of zucchinis from my garden!  The cheese sauce is very creamy and I would have never thought of making it that way!  Thanks for the great recipe Annabelle!!!!!!

This was delicious.  Definitely double the sauce.  You will be glad you did! This is a great way to use up the abundance of summer zucchinis and tomatoes.  I make recipes from this site all the time and this is the first time I've commented on or rated a recipe.

This was wonderful! My four year old daughter asked for seconds and she never does that! My husband was a little skeptical of meatless enchiladas because I make amazing authentic (as far as I know...) enchiladas. Even he loved them and requested I make them again when we have company next week! The only thing I changed was adding a mexican spice mix I keep handy and making an extra half batch of the cheese sauce because the amount this recipe makes did not cover the enchiladas and we prefer them soft not crispy. Overall though they were amazing!!!! Thanks:)

Excellent. I never thought to zucchini in an enchilada but it was a great idea. And the cheese sauce portion of this recipe would be great on it's own, but add it to the enchiladas and it is dynamite. I also added some leftover shredded chicken to mine just so I could use it up. I will be making these again.

Excellent! I only had one small can of diced green chiles, so I used those in the sauce and then diced up a jalapeno and added that to the zucchini mixture. The cheese sauce was delicious. I added some leftover grilled chicken (shredded) to half the enchiladas. Also added cumin. Hubby LOVED these. Thanks :)

Excellent and so different. Added a lilttle more chili powder and some cumin to the veggies. I also used 3 nice sized zuchinni diced. I loved the cheese sauce. Made 8 beautiful enchiladas and served with Mexican rice, low fat sour cream and some salsa. Thank you for a great recipe!

How does this recipe not have more reviews??!  I love it!  I have made this several times, tweaking here and there, my favorite variation is to use black beans, corn, and bell peppers in lieu of the zucchini (I do not have a garden and it's more expensive to buy at the market than the others).  But I have made this as written as well- delicious!!  Thank you Annabelle for a favorite :)

This recipe is fabulous...I made it just as written (except I added mushrooms) and it was amazing! Be careful not to leave it in the oven too long or the tortillas will become tough around the edges - they still taste good, just hard to cut with a fork.

So good- added black beans like some of the other reviewers - but it was overkill on the hot peppers- almost ruined it for me- cut way back!

I LOVE this recipe but I did change a few things just because of what I had in the pantry already. In my opinion, corn tortillas taste ALOT better than flour and dont get soggy over time. Also, I used jalapeno peppers instead of canned green chillies to up the heat factor a little bit. I added curry powder to the filling-- zucchini and black beans. As for the cheese, I used Kroger's Habanero cheese, which was awesome. I forgot to double to sauce recipe and didnt have enough to nicely coat the tray, so I added a can of pre-made enchilada verde sauce mixed in with the small amount of cheese sauce that was left-- this was GREAT for a quick fix.
The enchiladas were AMAZING-- super gooey, creamy, and chock full of healthy veggies!   
Also, my very meat loving husband loves these enchiladas as well, which is really saying something!!

According to my husband, "If this is what being a vegetarian is like, I think I could handle it!"  Based on other reviews, I doubled the sauce and added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) to the filling.  A great way to use up huge zucchinis from the garden!

The cheese sauce is fantastic!  I mostly followed the recipe, but I did add some left over ground beef to the filling and put a little salsa on the bottom to ensure that the enchiladas did not stick.  This recipe makes much more than 4 servings, it was at least 8.

Delicious! I doubled the sauce to cover the enchiladas, the sauce is by far the best i've had. I'll never buy enchilada sauce again!

I have never given a recipe this low of a rating but I found it to be pretty flat. The cheese sauce was nothing to write home about. Next time I will saute my veggies and just use a bottle of enchilada sauce, it was that unappealing.

Tasty the first night, though the enchiladas get soggy and unappetizing as leftovers.

Sauce=amazing!  I should have added other veggies, though.  Next time I will add mushrooms, peppers, and black beans as other reviewers have suggested.  That would make it perfect!

These were fantastic! Thank you for a delicious dinner recipe.  Even my meat and potato guy told me I could add these to the menu plan. :) I substituted red bell peppers for the chilies. And used 1/2 cup more milk.

These were so amazingly good!  I added a little bit of extra cheese to the cheese sauce and used a Mexican Blend instead of Monterey because that's what I had on hand.  Even my Dad really liked these, and he usually complains about anything that doesn't have meat!  I will definitely make these again.

With my modifications, 5 stars.  I don't use tomatoes but cover them in salsa instead.  Because I have the liquid from the salsa, I also don't add the milk into the sauce mixture.  It comes out very thick - but I just mix all of that into the zucchini mixture and it tastes wonderful when it comes out of the oven!

Yum, I really enjoyed these! I did omit the chiles from the cheese sauce since I didn't want the enchiladas to be too spicy for my 2 year old. I also added spinach and mushrooms to the filling. I can't wait to eat the leftovers, thanks for sharing!

Verry good.  I made this the night before and baked it before serving.  I used 1% milk and cheddar cheese.

Wow!  I seldom leave a review, but I just had to with this one!  The sauce in this is AMAZING!  The mixture of vegetables can be varied but this sauce makes the whole dish.  As others have suggested, I added cumin, mushrooms, yellow bell pepper and I decided to add italian sausage to mine.  Chicken would be good as well.  My son is making this cheese sauce to take to friends for nachos.

Wonderful recipe.  Easy to make and tastes great! Might put  black beans in the filling next time.  I have also uses cheddar cheese in the cheese sauce.  This recipe was one of the semi-finalist in our towns recipe contest.

The sauce was amazing, but we all felt these were missing something. Will try again with some modifications!

I added enchilada sauce and a can of veggie chili (since I had no black beans). Turned out well!

These were good fresh from the oven - loved the cheese sauce and definitely think that it could be doubled if you like your enchiladas cheesy; however, my leftovers did not hold up well AT ALL - so completely soggy I found it inedible and had to trash the rest.

Great enchiladas! I make extra sauce and filling, if you are concerned about the high cal.s use the same amount of sauce that the recipe calls for, but don't cook it as long. Maybe about 3 min. and it wont be as thick.

This recipe was great. I loved the cheese sauce. I added yellow squash and cauliflower to the filling, it made a great vegetarian dish that even my two year old enjoyed.

This recipe was really filling and pretty hearty dairy wise. The only thing that concerned me with this one was the amount of cheese that was used. If I make this one again, I will go lighter on the cheese. We treated this meal as a weekend “treat.” These were filled with a hearty serving of diced zucchini, onions, garlic, and black beans. A couple things I did differently from the original recipe was to add the black beans. I also had to adjust the salt and tomato amounts to suit the portion of the recipe better. The cheese sauce was delicious, but don’t forget to heat your milk first. This helps the sauce cook faster and smoother. I also garnished with a couple of sliced jalapenos for a little bit of heat.

Very good.  Add sour cram and pico de gallo--delish!  I didn't sprinkle on additional cheese at the end because the sauce is cheesy enough.  Many reviewers doubled the sauce, but I thought it was enough.  Maybe just half as much more....  The whole family liked it.

These were great. I added a yellow bell pepper, used lots of extra zucchini, corn tortillas and less butter/more milk than called for. Also used cheddar because that's what I had on hand, and sprinkled chopped cilantro on top. Inexpensive, delicious meal and a great way to use up extra zucchini!

An easy and delicious recipe, my husband loved it, and I don't even think he missed the meat. I used whole grain tortillas, and added a can of black beans to the filling. I paired it with a chicken tortilla soup and it was a great meal. I made extra cheese sauce and layered half with fresh sliced jalapenos just before serving.

I loved this recipe and will definitely make again.  I added a small bit of salsa that I love to the top of each enchilada while baking to add more zing to it, but that is all.   This is a fantastic meatless recipe!

These were pretty good but next time I'm making more sauce and adding more chilli powder and potentially adding more filling.  I added chicken to my husband's half but I think I should have marinated the chicken or something first because he wasn't in love with the enchiladas.

These enchiladas were very good!I liked the cheese sauce, next time I will double it because I didn't have enough to cover the top of the enchiladas. I added some leftover white beans and a bit of roasted jalapeno. I felt that the filling wasn't dense enough- next time maybe I will cut the zucchini in smaller pieces and/or add a little bit of rice to help bind it together.

I made this tonight for my parents and siblings....my sister said this was the best enchilada she has ever had. I did tweek the recipe a little.  I added a small can of this mexican salsa called "El pato" to the sauce mixture. It added a good kick. Also I put maybe a 1/2 tsp of tabasco. As a garnish, I added some chives, cilantro and sour cream.  So yummy. Thanks again!!!!
