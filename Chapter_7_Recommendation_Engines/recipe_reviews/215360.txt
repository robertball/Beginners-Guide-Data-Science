This was our first meal to begin a better effort to eat healthier.  Gratefully, it was really good!  The almonds provided a nice crunch to the chicken.  The salad was a nice complement to the chicken, giving a nice citrus flavor.  We gave up on using the fennel, but the meal didn't taste like it was missing anything.  Even our 2.5 year old enjoyed the chicken.  We will be making this again.

A nice combination of flavours and textures with the orange and lemon, and the crunch of the almonds. I used 3 chicken breasts, each sliced in half from the side for 6 portions, and baked them on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. I used all of the zest and the wedges from a large navel orange, but also added some additional orange wedges from a mandarin orange. Makes a nice presentation. Would make again.

I selected this recipe because I had a lot of arugula in the fridge. I was hesitant because I don't usually like fennel, but followed the recipe exactly and am glad I did. I suggest making more almond/orange zest coating - I ran out after the third breast (although in fairness, they were thick breasts). My almond coating burned to the pan, so next time I'll try another reviewer's suggestion and use parchment paper. I'm not sure if it made a difference, but I marinated the chicken in OJ while I prepared the coating.

does anybody think a marmalade glaze would be good on top of this? or maybe like some type of orange-y type chutney?

We loved this recipe! I pounded 4 chicken breast to about 1/2 inch thick. I didn't have enough almond mix so I had to make some more. I used whole almonds and pulsed them in a food processor. We loved the flavors in this. The licorice-y fennel (NOT the herb), sweet orange and spicy arugula went very well together.

This got mixed reviews in our house.  I liked it a lot, it was very refreshing and healthy.  Husband didn't care for it.

So good!!!! I suggest buying more almonds. I didnt have fresh fennel so I used dried, still good but I''m sure fresh would have been much better. I also added shallots to the salad. Delicious!

I only made the chicken. It's great that it's healthy but it does need some kind of orange sauce.

I would have given this recipe three stars, but my husband really liked it so I've given it four.  The orange zest gave the chicken a slightly bitter taste and the salad dressing was a little too lemony for my taste.  Maybe with a few modifications it would be better...I feel like the chicken needed a little bit of glaze or something.  This recipe is worth a try but not one of my favorites.

My whole family loved this recipe, even my picky husband.  When zesting the orange, be careful not to get any pith (white bitter part of the skin).  I cooked the chicken on a cooling rack placed over a cookie sheet.  The almonds and breading still stuck to the rack and peeled away when turning the chicken over.  I will try parchment next time.

Wow. The orange zest kicks it up a notch. My husband says itâ€™s one of the best chicken dishes he has ever had.

Loved this! Superb orange flavor. I found the proportions just right for four medium chicken breasts. I didn't make the salad but served it as the chicken for the salad in the Asian Chicken Salad from this site (a long-time favorite of mine) and it was perfectly delicious!

Great recipe for a hot day when you want something light! The flavors go great together, I wouldn't change a thing.
