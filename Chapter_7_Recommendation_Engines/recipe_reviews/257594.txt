4.12.17   Couldnâ€™t find the Tailgaters Gourmet Buns in my area, so I just used Ball Park hamburger buns.  Scaled down to two servings and enjoyed for lunch today.  This was good, but just a little flat for my taste.  Maybe a little more vinegar or some mustard would have given it a bit more tang??  Solid recipe but, honestly, not my favorite Sloppy Joe.

I loved this Sloppy Joe recipe, the only thing I changed was to add in about 2 tsp of mustard.  I love that you can sneak in veggies in this recipe and the kids won't know!

A good sloppy joe recipe. The slaw really complements it. We prefer to eat it open faced. These Ball Park buns are  large and substantial, so you can pick up each half and eat it without it falling apart, especially if you toast the buns.

This was a good sloppy joe recipe. I think the meat mixture would benefit from the addition of a little bit of mustard, but other than that, it was tasty. Definitely don't skip the coleslaw!

I made only two minor changes to this recipe.  Used a green pepper instead of red and, because we like our cole slaw a little sweet, added a little sugar to the ranch dressing.  I believe it's best to make the slaw a few hours early to let the flavors meld.  The large tailgaters buns held up well to this "sloppy" sandwich.  Really very good, and we both enjoyed it.

Messy and Marvelous! I could not find the Tailgater buns so I used the regular Ball Park Hamburger Buns. We really liked this recipe and I love that it has all the veggies in it too! Will make again!

I made this as described.    I didn't have it with the coleslaw, as I don't like coleslaw.    So, to me it was missing something.   Very blah.    My husband had it with coleslaw and said it made it.    He tried it both ways and said it def needed the coleslaw.
