These bars were quite tasty. They reminded me of a square form of an apple crumble pie. I am in the habit of lightening all recipes up, so I did do that to this one with good results. I made my own mock apple butter. Most have tons of sugar. Although, I have not seen the Musselman's suggested yet. I used 2 4oz cups of unsweetened organic applesauce, 2 Tblsp plus 2 tsp of maple syrup, and 1 tsp of apple pie spice. I microwaved it 2 1/2 minutes, in my small microwave, stirring half way through. When it cooled it down it was plenty thick to use. I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup lightly packed and they were still quite sweet to me. I also used half all purpose flour and half white whole wheat, and subbed half of the butter with safflower oil. I decided to use softened butter instead of melted. I think that made it hold together better. I couldn't understand why the directions would call for spraying the pan and then lining with foil. I always line with foil and then spray with Baker's Joy to avoid cleaning a pan. I put closer to 2/3 of the crumble mixture on the bottom for stability and ease of cutting. My bars took closer to the 30 minute time to bake. When done I let them near completely cooling before cutting. The foil lifted right out of the pan and off the sides of the bar making them easy to cut. This is more of a plated bar recipe as it is very crumbly. I got 12 bars at 192 each made as above.

I really loved these. I made them gluten-free. Really nice for a breakfast bar and the recipe comes together so fast. I'm going to do them again tonight with a different type of fruit filling! Thanks again.

Very good!!  I used my homemade apple butter which is very flavorful, but I think these would be good even with store bought apple butter.  I noticed that the name of these are "Cinnamon Oatmeal Bars", yet there isn't any cinnamon in the recipe?  I added a couple of shakes of cinnamon into the oatmeal mixture.  I plan to make these again and again experimenting with different fruits.

I like the original recipe, I also substituted a blueberry compote for the filling and was a hit with the family and office. I usually double recipe because it doesn't last long.

Doubled the recipe to fill a 9x12 pan. Also, I used homemade apple butter from AR. Last of all, I would try different fillings like Pear Butter from AR.

I was looking for a way to use apple butter, and these are yummy! I may try it using jam or even Nutella instead of apple butter - I think you could fill with whatever you had on hand! I tripled this and made an 8x8" square, plus a 9x13".  I baked both pans for 40 minutes. They didn't really turn "golden". Excellent recipe.

This is a simple and delicious recipe. Crunch on the top and bottom with a blast of delicious apple in every bite. Doesn't feel or taste heavy at all. Perfectly satisfying and easy to make.

Overall it was great. I didn’t have as much brown sugar so I used half brown/half white. Also didn’t have the apple butter used a honey crisp apple. Someone else on here mentioned using it so I did too. And it came out great. There didn’t seem to be enough of the oatmeal mix to go over the top to completely cover it. Even though I followed the thin crisp on the bottom directions. I would definitely add more to the mixture next time

Really good recipe! I followed as is aside from one thing... There's  no cinnamon! So I added some to half of the crumble that went on top as well as used the cinnamon apple butter from Williams Sonoma. They came out excellent!

They were really good, but a little sweet. Almost like a dessert. I would try again with something more tart as the filling-maybe cherry preserves. They held up well and I stored in the fridge  and used as a snack for several days.

I followed the directions, but it didn't get crisp, so I turned the oven to broil, forgot about it and burnt the top. I threw away the top layer and the bottom layer was delicious.

Delicious! I made a double batch and they went fast at the gathering. They were a little mushy, but I think I added too much apple butter. I will definitely make again and perhaps try raspberry or strawberry preserves.

i made these with my canned apple butter, taste was good.  needs more volume i would use either a small dish or double the recipe.  i also added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  we used them as a breakfast side.  top never did crisp up or turn but it still was good.
