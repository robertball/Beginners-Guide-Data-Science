I made a small batch as a test run to see if this is going with me to a friends house for the big game. You bet! Doubling the recipe because I have a feeling that it won't last long.

This recipe was amazing.  The flavor was full but not overwhelming.  Children and adults were both commenting on how it was the best fondue they ever had!!  One tip: Peeling & cutting the tomatoes took the longest portion of preparation.  Next time I might buy pre-diced from the store.  MAKE THIS FONDUE!!

Taste is lovely, but consistency was rubbery. Followed exactly, but couldn't get the cheese to melt smoothly.

The flavor was great, but I had real trouble getting it to be a good consistency. The cheese melted, but wouldn't combine with the cream, so I had rubbery cheese with liquid sitting on top. Not sure what went wrong... I ended up dumping some of the liquid off and putting the cheese over tortillas. My husband loved the flavor...just wished it wasn't so rubbery.
