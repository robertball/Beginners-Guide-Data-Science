Yes, Stephanie, this WAS delicious! Hubby and I both enjoyed this so much. It's clear that toasting the nuts, the orzo and the rice made all the difference in the world. This took a blend of simple ingredients over the top! Pretty and brown,with a wonderful depth of flavor. Just the right amount of seasoning too, that was neither bland nor overpowering. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

even without the nuts, this is good.  Try it with wild rice and its better.

This recipe is excellent!  The first time I made it was for a dinner party for 40 people and it turned out perfectly.  Everyone raved about it.  I added tarragon and used almonds instead of hazelnuts.  It has become mine and my family's new favorite side dish!

Thank you Stephanie for posting this great taste sensation recipe! WE LOVED IT! I didn't have any hazelnuts around (afterall, they're NOT a common grocery list item for my family) but I garnished with a couple TBLS of slivered almonds. I would love to try it with hazelnuts but I am still thrilled in finding this recipe. Thanks!!

Great recipe. Served this with & went very well with the "Anniversary Chicken I" (from this website) & broccoli/cheese. This pilaf had a wonderful flavor.  I will add a TBSP of minced garlic next time as our family loves garlic.

This rice is fabulous! It received rave reviews from the members of my last dinner party. I thought the hazelnuts were a nice touch and added some texture, however my husband didn't care for them. I've made this recipe again without the nuts and it was delicious.

I really loved the nuts in this. I did not have hazelnuts, but I toasted up some almonds and they worked great. The flavor in this reminded me a bit of a Thanksgiving stuffing. Perhaps because of the celery. I added a couple pinches of Kosher salt before bringing it to a boil and I'm glad I did. I will make this again, and also experiment with it. Using chicken broth and nuts is a great idea. In case you don't have marjoram on hand and really want to make this, oregano is a stronger flavored cousin of marjoram, so you can substitute and use oregano, but just a bit less than the called for amount of marjoram, about a 3:2 ratio marjoram:oregano.

We loved this recipe.  I used slivered almonds instead of hazelnuts, because that's what we prefer.  Otherwise made the recipe as it is submitted.  It was great!  I made it to take to another house so I actually added a little more broth, because I knew it would stay moister that way!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I agree, this is kind of like glorified instant rice dish, but it really is delicious!  I added chopped dried cranberries and they were just the sweet kick that I think it needed.  I also would not use butter next time and would simply use Olive Oil.
Lastly, I brought this dish to a party and had to work beforehand, so I made it about 4 hours prior to leaving, then warmed it in the oven, fluffed with a fork and it still served just wonderfully.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good!  Made a few changes.  Skipped the orzo and in place of long grained rice, I used 1 cup of uncooked wild rice instead.  I omitted the celery, but doubled the mushrooms (and used baby bellas).  Lastly, I stirred in fresh spinach at the end based on another review and it was a great addition.  My husband really liked it, but I think next time I'll try it without the hazelnuts to see how it compares... and I'll plan to use less butter as well to make it a bit healthier.

This was sooo yummy! Now, I hate when people rave about something even though they changed it, but I confess...I changed it a bit. However, I only did so because I didn't have some of the ingredients. I didn't have hazelnuts, so I substituted pecans...it was yummy; and I didn't have orzo, so I broke up spaghetti into aprox. 1inch pieces...worked just as well. Good recipe! Thanks for sharing :)

the first time around i thought it was kind of bland, so when i made the second batch i used 1/2 teaspoon marojoram and pepper and added a little salt, and it made all difference. once i altered the recipe it was five star.

This is a very good, flexible recipe that will work well with many different ingredients.  I used only 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil to saute.  The butter did not add any noticeable flavor improvement to the dish so next time I'll just use the olive oil, (it's healthier too!).  I had no hazelnuts on hand, so I substituted toasted pignoli nuts and they worked splendidly.  Will try incorporating finely chopped carrots and other veggies next time.  My husband enjoyed it very much and referred to it as gourmet Rice-a-Roni.  Thanks Stephanie.

2x'ed recipe and made it with brown rice and needed more time to cook.  May cut down on butter next time (half butter half olive oil?).  Was rich and delicious.  But maybe a little too rich.

This was so great! I made it for Father's Day when I had my family meet my finace's family, so I was nervous about the meal.  It was so good that my gormet cook grandma even loved it.  Everyone had seconds and thirds.  I made it with slivered almonds instead of hazelnuts as I prefer them.  This will be a regular at my house from now on.

Nice basic dish where you can change the content! I don't like nuts in my food, so I omited the hazelnuts, I also used wild rice instead of orzo pasta (in smaller proportions to the long grain rice). I used lots of mixed mushrooms (champignons, oyster, shiitake, porcini), added carrots, seasoned it up with oregano n salt. To make it a complete meal I chopped up 1/2 chicken breast which I marinated in a bit of soy sauce to give it taste, then sauteed that with onions before adding other veggies. I used olive oil istead of butter and added a package of soup mix. Delicious!

This recipe is amazing!  I have made it several times, and even though I didn't have hazelnuts, I used almonds and it was fantastic!  I doubled the mushrooms and onions because we love them!  Terrific!

Awesome recipe... I only used rice as I didn't have orzo but otherwise followed exactly.  Great the next day too!

This is a great recipe, even if I didn't have all the ingredients.  I doubled the rice in place of orzo and skipped the mushrooms because we were out, and added garlic.  Don't forget the garlic!  It was great!

Very good side dish and easy to make. I served it to company and all went back for seconds. I used roasted slivered almonds instead of hazelnuts because it was what I had on hand.

What a fabulous flavor!  You can serve this side dish with a full flavored meat course and it will hold its own.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! I used brown rice, and substituted the hazelnuts with almonds. I served it to company this weekend and it was a hit. Thanks!

I loved this side dish. I used pine nuts instead of hazelnuts (it was what I had in the pantry) and jasmine rice. Added about double the mushrooms, otherwise kept everything the same. I thought it could use a little salt but that's easy enough to add to your own serving once it's ready to eat. It might have also been because I used low-sodium chicken broth. Served this on the side of Slow Cooker Chicken BBQ from this site. I will be making this again, thanks for the recipe!

Nice subtle flavor which paired nicely with our grilled tilapia last night.  I increased the orzo to 1/2 cup because I thought the ratio of rice/orzo to broth was off a bit.  The only other change I made was to use toasted almonds.  I'll make this again!  Thank you!

This recipe is the best.  I catered a church banquet and made this as a side dish.  I made the recipe as follows wit the exception of 1 thing.  i used sliced almonds instead of hazelnuts.  This is definitely a family favorite:)

Good stuff! Though I'd love to try it without so much butter! I cooked it 10 minutes longer because it was so crunchy, but that didn't take away all the crunch. I guess pilafs are supposed to be crunchy. Didn't use any hazelnuts

This was really good!  I noticed that a lot of people were using other nuts but I really recommend the hazelnuts if you can find them.  They're delicious and add a really nice fall flavor to the dish.  My husband and I ate this as a main dish so we doubled the onions and mushrooms to make it heartier and used veggie broth instead of chicken and served it with a side of roasted squash.  Next time I'll double the recipe so we have more leftovers.  Delicious for so few ingredients!

This was really very good.  Used beef broth instead of chicken because I was serving it with beef and used toasted sliced almonds instead of hazelnuts.  Also didn't have any mushrooms so just left them out.  Husband really liked it.  Think I'd like it as written also.  Will definitely make it again!

Awesome!  I didnt have hazelnuts, so I used toasted almond slices instead.  It was great!  I'm a vegetarian, so I used veg broth instead of chicken.  I also used a mix of white and wild rice for the long-grain rice.  I'll try added 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar with the broth and reduce the butter to 3 tbsp next time.

This was sooo good. I offer a few changes out of my lack of ingredients. Used brown jasmine rice for the long grain & wild rice for the orzo, also toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts. Check your cooking time for the rice, but the flavor was really great! Nice side dish to the Citrus Tilapia. I kept getting compliments & we had some clean plates after that meal!

Ok...I absolutly LOVED this rice.  I am a big Uncle Ben's and Rice-a-Roni fan and this was the BEST!!  I made it with Chicken Cordon Bleu from this site last night and it rocked!!  The only thing i changed was that I omitted the nuts because I am allergic.  Great easy and YUMMY recipe.  Thanks Stephanie :)

Loved this!  I did tweak a little, as I wanted to make like I remembered from years ago.  I didn't use orzo, instead using 1 1/2 c. of jasmine rice.  I did follow the directions and sautéed the rice, onion, and celery in a pan.  I used a can of mushrooms, rather than fresh, and 1/2 c. of cashews instead of hazelnuts, and it was still really good.  I did add approx. 1/4 c. of soya sauce to the rice while sautéing.  Didn't add the marjoram or the parsley, but didn't miss them.  I then put the rice mixture in a pan, added 2 1/2 c. of chicken broth and baked in the oven for approx. 1 hour.  Was really delicious!  Served with the Baked Pork Chops I Recipe from this site (has a delicious mushroom sauce).

A perfect compliment to lamb, grilled chicken, fish, anything really.  I usually use pastina in place of the orzo.  If I'm out of celery I use celery salt and sometimes shallots in place of the onions.  It's pretty adaptable.  Oregano can be subbed in for the marjoram.  I have used almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, and pine nuts with the same great results.  If you really want to put this over the top, add some chunks of goat cheese right before serving.  I make this about once a week now.

Delicious, I was going to use almonds because I did not  have hazelnuts but then I forgot the almonds.  Even without them the rice was incredible.  My husband could not stop raving.  Followed the recipe as is except for my forgetfulness!

DH is a huge fan of pilaf - wants it on the side of practically EVERYTHING, & this does not disappoint! I add a clove of garlic & usually use either almonds or no nuts at all, & just a pinch of salt. Perfect served alongside our Cedar-Planked Salmon (Allrecipes). Simple, can be elegant, & just plain really good!

I didn't have hazelnuts but other than that I made it exactly as written. Delicious and the timing was close. Thanks for sharing this recipe will go into my rotation.

I enjoyed this very much, it was simple but delicious!  I used toasted pine nuts because that was the only thing I had on hand, but look forward to trying with hazelnuts.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe is worth the prep time.  I have never tasted a more delicious rice recipe in over sixty years.  It is a symphony of flavors. I used a wild rice mixture that I had on-hand and discovered it needed an extra ten minutes of simmering.

This was really good.  Definitely a keeper. Changes: I ended up halving the butter and cutting in hazelnut oil, since I had it on hand and I didn't have any hazelnuts.  Couldn't really taste the hazelnut though.  I think I might try it again with only hazelnut oil.  I also substituted the marjoram with oregano.

Good recipe but need to work with it. I will try without butter next time (too heavy) and try longer cooking time (was a lot of liquid left).

Fabulous! The hazelnuts flavored the pilaf beautifully. This goes perfectly with salmon (particularly if the salmon is seasoned with Paul Prouhomme's Magic Salmon Seasoning). I made it for my mom and my husband; my mom asked for the recipe and my husband asked me to make it again.

Wonderful rice!  I've made this 3 times.  Twice I used almonds because I can't find hazelnuts at the grocery.  It is a crunchy dish with the almonds and I like it better without.  You do need to keep the measurements for the rice, pasta, and chicken broth the same but you can be really messy with the vegetables and spices.  Its a really excellent savory dish.

I have made this several times already, this time without the hazelnuts.We prefer it without the nuts. I also like to dice or more like mince up my mushrooms,onion, celery all the same size. Very good side dish!

Fantastic.  I used pecans instead of hazelnuts, which were great, I'll try almonds next time.  This was easy and fast, great weeknight side dish.

A good quick dish.  A bit too greasy - next time I will cut the butter in half.  I added some veggie chicken strips at the end and it made a great meal!

I did not make the recipe as stated but I figured it had a lot of room to improvise if you want. I used the celery onion and butter but also added garlic.
I didn't use mushrooms or the hazelnuts, but I used chopped toasted pine nuts, and instead of marjoram I used 1 tsp tarragon, 1 tbsp freeze dried parsley, the juice of half a lemon and a bay leaf. I used 2/3c Jasmine Rice and 1/3c orzo and used the full 2 cups of chicken broth.
Really great base recipe where using whatever ingredients you have on hand will still make a tasty side dish!

This is a great sidedish!  I've made the recipe as is and also with ditalini pasta in place of the orzo.  I add green onions which really compliments these flavors.  Fyi, the butter is unnecessary.

This is absolutely delicious! I only had Jasmine rice, so I used that instead of long grain rice. Also, I didn't have any hazelnuts, but I wanted to try this recipe, so I made it without the nuts. Because I used Jasmine rice, I cut the chicken broth in half to one cup instead of two. I also added a pinch of salt once all the ingredients were in the pot. Plus, I used about double the mushrooms because I LOVE mushrooms. OUTSTANDING!!! A great blend and balance of flavors... and healthy! Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely excellent!  I made this as the side dish to serve with the lobster I had for Christmas Eve dinner.  It complimented it perfectly.  I could see adding chicken or shrimp right to this to make it a complete meal.  Thank you for this quick, easy and elegant dish.

Excellent.  I doubled the recipe for leftovers and still didn't get any.  Everyone, including the picky eaters, devoured this rice.  It went great with the salmon.

This recipe was excellent. I didn't have any marjoram, and so I used the seasoning packet from the box of long grain and wild rice that I used. I will definitely make this again.

This is really tasty and makes a great side dish!  I use 1 cup rice instead of 1/2 cup.  Perfect!  We also try a different nut every time we make this and it always turns out delicious!  I make this with the garlic butter chicken from this site!  Great match and one of our favorite meals!  Thank you!

This was a nice change from traditional rice, and while it was very tasty, I don't think I cared for the hazelnuts in it.  I would definitely make it again, but I think next time I might add in some chopped water chestnuts for a little crunch without all the competing flavours of the nuts.  I also took the advice of others and added about 14 C extra rice to the recipe.

Oh my goodness, this recipe is AWESOME! I was looking for something to make a good side dish with chicken, and I'll never make another pilaf recipe again. The hazelnuts and mushrooms are a wonderful flavor combo. It's very easy to do the food prep on this ahead of time, so you just have to assemble/cook before dinner. I was glad I made a double batch of this, because there were no leftovers of it.

This was excellent.  I used toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts, and I thought it was great.  I served it to someone who is generally not a rice lover, and even she thought it was great.  It was very flavorful and had a nice toasty nutty taste....very good.  I'll make it again.

I really wanted rice pilaf as a side.  I did not have any box mixes on hand so I looked up this recipe.  It was great!  My family loved it.  The flavors were great together.  I used shredded carrots instead of celery (I didn't have any  on hand), dried parsley, canned mushrooms, almonds and I added a garlic clove.  It was still very delicious with all these changes.  It was quick and easy. It is now a staple item in my recipe file.

Very simple and tasty. No extra salt is needed if a bullion cube is used for the broth. Doubled the amount of mushrooms and even more could be used (including other veggies).

Made this last night and used sliced almonds as I didn't have any hazelnuts handy. Served this with a grilled pork tenderloin and Chef John's "Truly Delicious Brussels Sprouts". What a great combination!! Super yum and a great dinner! Thanks for sharing!

This was great.  I prepped the day before so it was easy to cook.  The only thing I didn't have was chicken stock so I fearfully used beef stock.  I like to follow the directions as written.  It turned out fabulous.  I will try again with the chicken stock but it had a full flavor with the beef.  Thank you for sharing.

I loved this!  I left out the celery and the marjoram (didn't have any), and used slivered almonds instead of hazelnuts.  The rice was still pretty crunchy, and I'm not sure if that's supposed to happen?  Or maybe I used the wrong kind... either way it was REALLY good!  April 14th, 2009:  Made it again with a different kind of rice.. and yes I must have used the wrong kind last time.  This time I left out nuts (didn't have any) and used beef broth instead.  Again left out the celery and marjoram.  I like it better with the beef broth!

This recipe was easy to make and met with rave reviews from everyone.  I did alter it somewhat.  I used almonds instead of hazelnuts and Acini di pepe because the two grocery stores I hit up before making it didn't have orzo.  It would probably be even better with orzo, but was very good even with substitutions.

Easy to prepare and absolutely delish!  I didn't have marjoram so I used thyme. And I don't care for hazelnuts so I used pine nuts. This recipe will become a staple in my most-used repetoire. 

Thanks!

I omitted the hazelnuts because we didn't have any, added homemade chicken broth and used basmati rice. My 4 kids and hubby (and I) loved this, which was impressive (getting everyone to like the same food). Definitely a keeper.

My fiance and I whipped this recipe together last night. With her first forkful she exclaimed,"this is a keeper!" I agree. Easy, flavorful and different. I bet this dish would make a good good stuffing for poultry or pork. We will make this often,I'm sure.

What a wonderful side dish!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  I served this to guests, and they raved about how delicious it was (and asked for the recipe).  The toasted hazelnuts added a great texture and flavor.  A keeper recipe!

WOW!  We served this  to our friends and they said they thought they were at a five star restaurant.  I did make some changes...omitted celery and used pecans and brown rice instead.  Mmmmmmmmm!  I might replace the butter with olive oil next time.

This was very good, healthier than your average rice, or at least you feel healthier eating it. My roomate liked it very much, just the way it is, I added salt to mine but other than that,very good.

Wow, such fabulous flavor and texture!  I used a tad more orzo than called for just because I had a few grains left in the box and I dumped them in anyway.  I didn't adjust the liquid and was worried it would come out dry.  On the contrary, it came out a bit moister than I prefer (but that didn't stop me from helping myself to three servings!).  Next time, I will decrease the chicken broth slightly.  Also, I used toasted slivered almonds out of personal preference.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Stephanie!

This is a very yummy and attractive side dish. We used sliced 'baby portabello mushrooms' which maintained a nice texture.  The rice is easy to prepare and can sit unattended while you are preparing the rest of the meal or eating a first course. Thanks for such a good simple recipe.

I made on a week night and it was super easy and fast.  Plus it tastes great and looks professional.  I didn't find any hazelnuts at the store, but it was still really tasty, I am sure that it is even better with them. I will definately use this again for dinner parties.

Made this recipe for 40 for my brother's wedding this past weekend (and then again the next day to go with the leftover Chicken Marsala).  On the first day I made it per the recipe and it came out more like risotto but got rave reviews.  When I made it again the next day I altered the amount of Chicken broth (2 C liquid to 1 C rice) and it came out perfect.  Rave reviews again.  Had to substitute walnuts on 2nd day and didn't notice a difference.  Also served with Broccoli with Garlic and Parmesan.  Awesome combination.

This is a great recipe for rice pilaf that is thick and creamy.  Like other users, I added in wild rice to help give it a better texture.  Also, browning the hazelnuts in butter ahead of time is a definite must.  I also followed other users and used oregano instead of the marjoram (since I didn't have any).  This recipe doubled easily and I made two different versions (one with mushrooms and one without) and both were delicious.  I also added in some chopped fresh rosemary into mine and it was very tasty.  My only complaint is that the texture of the rice (making it for the first time) was very hard to read...the liquid didn't boil off and the rice never got "dry" or that fluffy.  Instead, this is a slightly saucy/creamy pilaf, so don't be worried about this when you're cooking yours and you keep waiting for all the liquid to go away.  I just let mine sit for about 15 minutes and it thickened up to a nice texture.  Delicious!

Great recipe! Nice mix of earthy, savory flavor. I toasted the hazelnuts in the toaster oven for about 8 minutes while I prepared the other ingredients. I didn't bother chopping or crushing the nuts, but it was fine. I used homemade vegetable broth, so I ended up adding salt because there wasn't enough without it. I used some finely chopped celery and red bell pepper i had left over from making tuna salad the day before, perfect use in this, and I think the pepper added a nice color and flavor, i think i'll keep that addition for the future. That 10 minute stand time at the end IS important,  if nobody's mentioned it yet. Anyway, delicious! Thanks for sharing this!

Marvelously easy and delicious recipe.  Why buy boxed pilaf ever again? The only change I made was to use toasted slivered almonds instead of hazelnuts because I'm not a hazelnut fan.  I've made this dish many times--we all love it!

This recipe is very simple and fast. I adapted the recipe by using only brown rice and adding chicken into the mix. I also eliminated the celery and added half a cup of canned low sodium low fat mushroom soup. I did this because I found the chicken was a touch dry. I will pre-marinate the chicken next time to avoid this. Great dinner!

I have made this a few times. It is great with or without the nuts...or with or without the mushrooms. Thank you for a great recipe.

Didn't add the celery because I didn't have any; and swapped the orzo for dittalini, again, because I didn't have any; swapped beef broth for the chicken; used Italian seasonings instead of the different ones called for; and lastly: didn't add the hazelnuts! So, my version was completely different, but we really enjoyed it just the same. Thanks!

I made this for Easter and what a hit!  I didn't have hazelnuts so I toasted pecans.  Great! Have since made it with hazelnuts and again with walnuts.  What a wonderful, easy, scrumptious side dish!  Thanks a lot S. Moon for sharing!

I had never made pilaf before, and this recipe was exeptionally good the very first time I made it. I now double the mushrooms and halve the hazelnuts, to better suit my husband's tastes, and it's one of his favorite side dishes. This is a really great recipe!

This recipe is amazing!  I've never made pilaf before, but I will definitely make it again after trying this one. I did not have any hazelnuts, so I toasted pine nuts-awesome!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

This was very good, relatively easy to make (all of the work was prep work).  Our 2 friends really liked the dish, and I don't think it would have fed 6 of us!  Used toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts.  Yum!
