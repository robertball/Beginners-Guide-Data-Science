I followed the recipe to a T and the pastry was awful,what a mess.But when I went back to the original tassie pastry recipe and used margarine instead of the butter flavored shortening they were really yummy!

I recently attended a wedding where 
there were tassies such as these.....
or at least that is what I thought. I 
followed the directions to a T, and they
were dreadful. I was thoroughly 
dissapointed with the results. A total
waste of time and money.  I am an avid
baker and found this to be a joke recipe,
that someone submitted to play a prank. 
Very upsetting.

I thought these were wonderful. I made them for a friend's wedding and not only were they delicious they were beautiful too.  To the person who said she was an experienced baker, maybe you had a bad baking day.  They are challenging but worth the work.  Also the shells may not taste good alone but they are a great base for the sweet filling.

I made these last X-mas for a cookie exchange at work.  Everyone raved.  I am making them again this year with the exception that I'll be making dozens more.  Thanks for this wonderfully sinful treat!!

The caramel filling was very runny. (Caramel apples use 2 T milk for a 14 oz bag of caramels.)   I doubled the topping recipe and added half of it to the runny caramel mix.  I also had to double the number of cups to hold all the filling.  (A definite perk, since these are so yummy!) Used real butter rather than crisco in the crust.  Excellent.

What a disappointment!  I don't mind spending the time that this recipe requires, but would like to see a more rewarding result.  The caramel filling and topping were good, but the cookie shells were quite tasteless and bland.

i just made these, but i made a mistake the first time around i added real butter instead of butter flavored shorting and then i made it the recipe way and added the butter flavored shorting and i must say i think i like the real butter better it made a much better dough to work with and instead of pushing it down with my fingers i got the bright idea of taking a clean cork from a wine bottle and rubbing it with crisco at the end and just dunking it flour and pressing down the dough that way,  much better than the fingers and they bake up much better don't puff as much and remember it is (5 ounces)! of evaporated milk i put the whole can in when i did the caramel (read the directions) lol..over all with some adjustments this is a great recipe :) thank you
