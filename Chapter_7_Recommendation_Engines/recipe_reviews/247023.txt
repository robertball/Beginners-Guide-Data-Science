We normally make it sans peas as we often forget then at the store. It's a simple and quick dish that is very tasty over pasta!

Surprisingly really good. Had all the ingredients in the house already. I added capers and used a frozen pack of mixed vegetables because that s what I had. Oh and a little lemon juice.
