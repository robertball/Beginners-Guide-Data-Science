This was tasty. I  cooked it in the microwave for 5 minutes, stirring every minute. I decreased the almond milk to 3/4 cup and replaced 1/4 cup with I.D. Sugar Free Pumpkin Coffee Creamer. I then topped it with minced walnuts. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

My co-worker said, "It is good."  So, I guess that means that she likes it.  And, she went back to the kitchen for more because she said it was good.
