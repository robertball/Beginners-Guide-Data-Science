I have become famous for making this lasagna. It really is a fabulous recipe. One thing to note, though, is that cottage cheese will not work for lasagna -- you need to get the 15-oz. container of WHOLE MILK ricotta. Also, a good idea is to bake it for the 30 minutes the night before, keep it in the refrigerator, and the next day, sprinkle the 1/2 pound of mozz on top and then bake for 15 minutes before serving. That way, the flavors gel overnight, but you still get the feeling of eating the lasagna "fresh".

This is the one! I love lasagna so I've tried many recipes looking for that special one and this is it. The only change I made was that I added fresh mushrooms and a bit more water to the sauce. STICK WITH THE COTTAGE CHEESE! I decided to try the cottage cheese instead of the ricotta like many others changed and I'm glad I stayed with cottage cheese. I did blend the cottage cheese up with a hand mixer however so it came out to the same consistancy as ricotta and so there wouldn't be any noticable curds in the lasagna. I've used ricotta on many other recipes and the cottage cheese beats it in flavor and creaminess by far!!! I will never use ricotta again. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made this for a crowd Christmas Eve. I thought it was terrible even after trying to kick it up a knotch  with additional spices and meat. I used top of the line ingredigents. Very disappointing. I should know by experience not to trust ratings esp on a holiday! Some one said it tasted like Stouffers Lasagna---and it did! Save your self the trouble and buy Stouffers. I am sorry but stouffers is not my idea of good lasagne---just a quick cheap substitute in a pinch.

This was excellent!  I've only made lasagna one other time and this was so much better.  I did use Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese only because of what I remember about eating cottage and peaches as a snack as a kid (ARGH).  Never want cottage cheese again.  Instead of no-bake noodle or boiling the noodles, I placed them in room temperature water for about 40 minutes and that worked great.  (got this from someone else on AllRecipes)

I added about 1 teaspoon of basil and a bay leaf to the sauce while it simmered.  Be sure to remove the bay leaf!  
Since it's only me and my 21 year old son at home, I have a lot of leftovers and it was exceptional the next day.  I also shared with my niece and her 2 year old and they loved it!!

Excellent lasagna.  I added riccotta cheese instead of cottage like everyone else did...GOOD idea!  
also, added:  white wine, italian seasoning, fresh-chopped parsley, and mushrooms to the sauce.  It really adds flavor to it.  In addition, instead of cooking the sauce, I put it in the slow-cooker for an hour on high, then on low all day which really makes the sauce shine.  Just remember to add a bit of water and/or wine to it throughout the day.  Best stuff you'll ever taste!

Excellent!  I used cottage cheese and no-boil noodles.  This lasagna is different how you don't layer everything like other lasagnas.  I think this helps it stay together.  Very tasty!  We split it into 10 servings and each serving was a perfect portion.

I have tried several different lasagnas now and this is mine & my husband's favorite so far.  I added 1 (10-oz) package frozen spinach with the parmesan & egg, only used 4 oz cottage cheese, and used 1 cup shredded mozzarella and 1 cup shredded cheddar in place of the 1 lb mozzarella.  The sauce had a wonderful flavor and I would use it again for pasta (but the Slow Cooker Spinach Marinara from this site is my favorite).  My husband commented that it was a little too saucy and could've used the addition of mushrooms and more cheese.

I made 6 9x13 pans of this for a dinner of about 30 people.  I got so many compliments!  It was easy to assemble and with the basic ingredients, it appealed to everyone. I did substitute ground turkey for the beef since we don't eat red meat but it did not affect the taste - obviously because no one else knew about the switch!!  I'll make this for my family next time it's lasagna night!!

I made this for a family that I work for, tried it, and was blown away. VERY VERY GOOD. I might have put more seasonings in it, as I like my food very flavorful. It was perfect, am making it again tonight!

Like everyone else, I'm giving this recipe 5 stars.  Both my husband and I loved this lasagna.  It is by far the best lasagna we've had.  The sauce isn't difficult to make but it's very tasty.   The only thing I changed was substituting the cottage cheese with ricotta because I didn't have any cottage cheese on hand.  This is my new lasagna recipe!

This recipe is amazing!! Usually I use ricotta cheese but I went with my gut and decided to try the cottage cheese and I'm so glad I did! It definitely gives it a creamier texture. I did take another users advice and added some basil, bay leaf, and fresh mushrooms it really adds to the flavor. Also I used Sargento artisan Parmesan and Romano for the cottage cheese mixture and the noodle layer and used Sargento mozzarella & asiago cheese for the top layer. Delicious!!  Also, I soaked the noodles in room temp water for about an hour and what a difference it makes in the texture, no more boiling again!!  Thank you for such a yummy recipe!

This lasagna is so good! It's one of the simplest recipes I've seen, but that does not mean it's not one of the tastiest. The only change I made was I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. The cheese mixture of ricotta, parmesan, and egg seemed a little dry for spreading, so I added about 1/4 cup of milk to soften it up. My husband and I love this lasagna! It's one of his favorite dinners that I have made for him, so I'll be making it again.

I having been experimenting with different lasagna recipes over many years.  Some have been complicated and very expensive.  Not only is this recipe easy and inexpensive, it is one of the best!  I was very surprised to learn how wonderful creamy cottage cheese worked in this recipe.  My only complaint is there were no leftovers!

Awesome!! Great recipe, the meat sauce makes the dish.  I find it amusing that people on here seem upset that cottage cheese is used instead of ricotta.  Please get over it, it's about taste and some people don't like ricotta...move on people, this is great lasagna

We could not stop eating this! I substituted the cottage cheese for ricotta, and also used 1/2 lb. ground pork and 1/2 lb. ground beef (instead of just beef). I also added a layer of fresh spinach to try and get something green in there... it was delicioso!! Thanks.

My son made this lasagna last evening for dinner using the no-boil lasagna noodles.  I enjoyed the tomato sauce made from the crushed tomatoes. Just the right amount sauce so the lasagna wasn't dry but not soupy.  Very good lasagna!

I think this is a great base recipe. I add a lot of garlic and onion as well as fresh basil to the meat. I keep the meat separate from the red sauce to create more layering effect. I also use a combo of ground turkey and chicken italian sausage instead of ground beef to heighten the flavor. I also use part cottage cheese and part ricotta for additional creaminess. The last change I do is no-cook lasagna noodles. Less work and pots dirty. So basically I modified this recipe with the original as sort of a framework for all my changes. A good starting point.

mmmmmm, what a luscious recipe this is!! i followed the directions as written with the minor exceptions of substituting barilla's "no boil" lasagna noodles for the regular kind & using a mozzarella/provolone blend of cheese (what i had on hand). remember to let your lasagna rest  after baking so it sets up for easy serving. thank you linda!

This is my favorite lasagna. I've tried other people's homemade lasagne and this stays my favorite. You can add spinach, or different cheeses or stay classic. I usually substitute the "sauce" with Catelli's Garden Select pasta sauce (all Real ingredients) and extra garlic it up for my husband.

My Fiancee loved your Linda'a Lasagna!  When I made lasagna with Ricotta Cheese he didn't like it. He doesn't like cottage cheese. So I didn't tell him.  And I have a problem with tomato paste and tomatoes so I added 2 tsp of soda to cut the acid.  It turned out beautiful!!!  Hey, Thanks!!!

I am an Italian girl and while this is NOT traditional Italian lasagna, it is saucy and delicious and honestly my favorite of any I have eaten.  I am famous for this lasagna!  I usually substitute soy crumbles to make it vegetarian, and no one knows the difference.

There are two foods that I love to try all kinds of recipes when making:  lasagna and chili.  This recipe for lasagna is a no fail recipe.  It is delicious!  I have tried many and this one is one of the best.  I did make a couple of adjustments, although, they don't really alter the recipe enough to make a huge difference.  One, I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and left out the water.  Secondly, I did not boil the noodles, I layered them dry.  I baked it for 45 minutes, covered.  Then uncovered it and added the remaining mozzarella and baked it for about 15 more minutes.  I have tried ricotta in lasagna before, but I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with the cottage cheese.  I also think adding a half pound of italian sausage would be divine.  Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed!

I'm not a big fan of oregano so I cut it back to just a half a teaspoon.  I doubled the salt and the sugar and also added some season salt.

So so good. I used 1/2 lb of spicy sausage and 1/2 lb lean ground beef to add some extra zing. Great recipe!

This lasagna is phenomenal.  I have made it about 4 times in the last 3 months!  My only minor suggestion would be to add more sauce to avoid the upper layer of noodles from getting dry.  Excellent and well loved by everyone who's tried it - even better reheated!

Very good. Added fresh garlic and substituded one can of tomato paste with tomato sauce. Ricotta cheese here is costly and doesn't taste good so I wouldn't even consider buying it.  The late great Julia Child used cottage cheese in my all time favorite Chicken Lasagna recipe.  Don't use 1% fat not enough flavor.

I grew up using cottage cheese in lasagna and I think it works/tastes fine. No need to use ricotta cheese like some people insist on doing.  But then again, I'm not Italian. I am only giving this 4 stars because I feel it tasted sweet and I don't care for sweet tasting lasagna. Next time, I would cut the sugar in half.  Other then that, I really enjoyed this recipe.

I made this last night and was quite pleased with it....I used diced tomatos instead of crushed and only simmered tha sauce for 30 min. Oh and I added extra pepper for my husband! I will make this again for sure!

This was INCREDIBLE! My boyfriend and 9 year old twin daughters absolutely loved it. I made a few adjustments to this due to what I had on hand at home. I used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb Italian sausage. I added 3 cloves minced fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and used Italian seasoning instead of just the dried oregano. I added a can of diced tomatoes as well for texture. I followed other reviews and used half cottage cheese and half ricotta which was perfect and instead of just adding that to the top layer I added a little between the other layers as well. LASTLY, I put a layer of mozzarella/parmesan blend on top. Nothing really drastic done or added just tweaked it a bit to my taste. SO DELICIOUS! Thank you for the amazing recipe RBLAIR!

Here is the deal: I've eaten a TON of people's lasanga recipes and this is by far the best. I must admit, this is my first time making one, but this one takes the cake, and I'm not really sure what makes it stand out from every other lasanga.  Even better than store bought.  I used 12 ounces ricotta, but also mixed in about 4 ounces of cottage cheese that I had leftover from another recipe.  So it was probably extra cheesy.  I also used half mozzerlla and half monterey/colby jack cheese.  AMAZING!!  Sprinkle parsley on top before serving.

All I have to say is YUM! I made this exactly as written. Lasagna sounds so scary to make, but this was way easy. I used no-boil noodles, too. Next time I would add a bit more cheese (I'm a cheese lover) but really I have no complaints at all. When I smelled the sauce after it simmered, I panicked because it smelled so strongly of oregano, but I trusted the reviews and went on. I'm happy I did, and will totally make this a regular thing.  EDIT: I made this a second time with ricotta cheese, because I was curious, and to my surprise I liked the cottage cheese MUCH better!

Just the lasagna I was looking for!  This was perfect in taste and consistancy.  I too used the Barilla no-cook noodles, and adjusted the baking time & temp to match the instructions on the Barilla box (50-60 minutes, covered at 375, then uncovered for about 10 minutes) The lasagna "rested" out of the oven for about 15 minutes while I baked some quick breadsticks, and it set very nicely:  firm layers...not slip-slidn' away as usual!  I subbed 1/2 pork for 1/2 of the ground beef because that was what I had leftover from another recipe, used fresh garlic (2 cloves)instead of garlic powder, and added a tablespoon or so of basil to both the sauce and the cottage cheese mixture.  The sauce was a little sweet, but just the way I like it!  Next time I'll use 1/2 beef, 1/2 Italian sausage.  We ate 1/3 of the pan tonight, we'll eat another 1/3 as leftovers in a day or so, and I'll freeze the rest for an easy meal another time.  Thank you Linda so much for sharing!!!

Pretty much loved it. With that said, there wasn't really anything *super special* about it, but a very good basic lasagna recipe. Also, everything held together really well, and it wasn't too soupy and not at all dry. I took another review's advice and put it in the fridge overnight and baked it the next day. This seemed to be the trick of helping all the ingredients blend well. Otherwise I think it would have tasted too separate, if that makes sense.

Yummy!  My husband was skeptical about the cottage cheese, so I used ricotta instead.   Next time I will try the cottage cheese.  Meat sauce was excellent and I didn't think the lasagna was too "cheesy".

This was really good. Even my 16 month old son liked this (and he is a picky eater). I followed some other reviewers advise to use a blender to mix the cottage cheese and it made it a nice smooth mixture.

I like the creaminess of cottage cheese over the dry of ricotta.  This is a good recipe and I appreciate the sauce made from scratch, and not being limited to a jar.  You can spice it up with onion or red pepper and always add more garlic and black pepper.

I was very pleased with this recipe. I baked 10 lasagnas for a banquet and got so many compliments. Since I live in a foreign country I did have to make some adjustments...maybe this will help someone else. I used tomato sauce (personal preference) instead of chopped, added about 1/3 cup red wine per batch, added a few shakes of italian seasoning, used a mixture of cottage and ricotta and used the no cook noodles. When I was ready to layer I put all noodles in a pan of warm water to make pliable then I did sauce, noodles, cottage cheese, mozz cheese, noodle, sauce, cheeses, etc. On top I put sauce then mozz. Four layers. I baked covered with foil for 30 mins at 370 and uncovered for 20 mins a bit higher. These were a HUGE HIT! Thanks!

I made this dish for my husband and his two Marine friends.   They LOVED it!  I got so many compliments, including one of his friends asking if he could bottle up the sauce I made and take it home with him. lol.  I made it with ground turkey instead of ground beef, and you couldn't even tell the difference.  I also made the lasagna and put it in the fridge for half an hour prior to baking it, and I think it made the flavors mix together very well.   I blended the cottage cheese, Parmesan and egg in the blender, which made the consistency very smooth.   Also, instead of using water in the sauce, I used 1 1/2 cups of white wine and 1/2 cup water.  The next time I make it, I don't think I'll add the extra 1/2 cup of water because it was pretty runny.

I thought this was a very good traditional lasagna. The only things I changed were: 1/2 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb of ground pork, and I added about 3 leaves of fresh chopped basil. I used cottage cheese and blended it with the parm and the egg using an immersion blended to get the right texture. It was perfect, I prefer it with cottage cheese over ricotta:) Thanks for the great easy recipe.

This is the best lasagna recipe that I have ever made.  I used ground turkey, low-fat cottage cheese, reduced fat moz and parm cheeses and everyone loved it.  I also used the sauce over spaghetti squash and it was delicious.  I highly recommend giving it a try!

The recipe is OK but using ricotta cheese is essential to making a good lasagna.  Using cottage cheese is revolting.  It would definitely not be Italian without the use of ricotta cheese.  Cottage cheese has a tangy taste, ricotta is smooth and mellow tasting making for an excellent lasagna. If you think that ricotta is too thick, then you could buy the part-skim ricotta. Also as an Italian-American I add to my ricotta cheese Parmesan cheese and Mozzarella cheese, salt & pepper.  You can add other spices to the sauce if you wish along with the ground beef. You could also ground sausage alone, or mix it with the ground beef.  If your market has italian meatball mix ground meat, that would be great to brown up to add to the sauce.  It is a mix of ground beef, pork & veal and gives a nice flavor to the sauce. Other than my dispute with the choice of cheese, the recipe is good.

Excellent.  I am married to an Italian, so know the Italians use ricotta cheese.  However,not everyone has access to it, and cottage cheese is a very acceptable alternative.  I moved from San Diego, CA to Wyoming and I definitely do not have access to the variety of foods I am used to cooking with.

Delicious! Ricotta is nice if you want to add it to the mix but does not make it any less Italian if you don't. I cream all the above cheeses in the food processor and add coarse ground pepper & fresh parsley.

Very, very good!  I'm giving this lasagna a 4+ rating.  I followed other's sugestions and used fresh garlic in place of powder and used Italian sausage along with ground beef.  Since I was making this for a large gathering, I doubled the ingredientsand used 2lbs Italian sausage with 1lb grounc beef. We like a meaty lasagna.  The only suggestion I will make is hold off on the salt until you have put the sauce together. Then salt to taste. Other than these small variations I followed exact recipe.

This is a great recipe. I add some basil and a bay leaf to the sauce. I use this sauce for spaghetti as well. The sauce alone does great in the slow cooker.

I have this dish baking in the oven as I type. I'm so excited since this is my first homemade lasagna. I stuck to the recipe except that I didn't have the cottage cheese on hand so omitted it. I cooked the sauce in the crockpot for an hour after I browned my meat and carmelized the onions. The sause tastes great!! It is a tiny bit sweeter than I would have prefered, but I think as it simmers it melds the taste and is wonderful. It should be coming out of the oven in about 20 minutes and I can't wait. Also, I added a few veggies... mushrooms, celery... etc. Thanks Linda for sharing such a great recipe!!! UPDATE:: I make this about once a month or more... I add hot Italian sausage to it sometimes and often add veggetables to it as well. It's a great, easy dish and I usually make two 8X13 pans and freeze one for later. I used to always boil the pasta before layering the dish but not anymore. Now I just layer the dish... let it sit at least over night and then bake. The trick to avoiding that gummy texture is to bake it a good hour. If it is underbaked (30 minutes or so) the pasta is gummy. Give it a good hour to bake. I've made it with both ricotta and with cottage cheese. I prefer the cottage cheese... besides it's cheaper. Cover the dish for most of the baking time... then uncover the last 10 minutes to avoid burned cheese.

Great sauce! - My suggestion to those of you that will try this recipe would be to add one more layer of noodles. I prefer a taller and thicker lasagna. (I also mixed some cheddar with the mozzerela). BUT, 5 stars for sure. That sauce ruled!

This was my first attempt at making lasagna, and it turned out great!  The sauce is so good.  I followed the recipe exactly as it's written, except I used Barilla no boil noodles, and I used ground sirloin.  This recipe is really great.  I love cheese, so next time I might add some extra mozzarella and use a little more of the cottage cheese mixture.  This was really easy and fun to make... a little time consuming, but worth the wait!

This is better than the hall of fame American Lasagna and so MUCH easier too! I would suggest letting the lasagna sit for 5-10 minutes before cutting and serving (so it's not soupy). This is excellent! Next time I'll decrease the salt a tiny bit but other than that this is a PERFECT recipe!

I've made this several times now.  Excellent recipe!!!  I use the tomato based sauce for spaghetti as well.  I leave the onion in quarters while simmering and then remove before serving because I don't like onion pieces but agree it needs the flavor.

This was WAY too salty. I can't believe that no one else seemed to comment on the saltiness.  It could be cut to 1 tsp of salt and still be fine.  Other than that, it was good.

I love this recipe! I personally do not like sugar in my sauce so I omit it, but I follow everything else to the T. I live in Army barracks and I never have an empty seat at our dinner table with this recipe. Thank you for sharing it.

This lasagna is awesome! I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and blended up the cottage cheese mixture with a hand mixer so it had a more ricotta-like texture. That made it perfect! I also used the trick to stick the noodles in room temperature water for about 40 mins. of the time while the sauce was simmering. I even used the baking dish to have them soak in the water for that part. Less dishes to do- wahoo! Thanks for a great recipe!

YUMMM. This was very good and am replacing my old recipe with this one.
 I did make some changes I use 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese as I do not boil noodles and I feel the "juice" of the cottage cheese helps cook the noodles,I added an extra egg and I didnt have crushed tomatoes so I used hunt's diced fire roasted tomatoes and that added an extra layer of yummness and I always use sweet bulk sausage in my lasagna. This was excellent and Im fussy! Good Luck!

First time making with cottage cheese and it's actually really good. I did however blend the cottage cheese, parm, and egg in my food processor so it wouldn't be "curdy" but it may be fine with out this step as well. I also used my homemade meat sauce that I had in the freezer which has a lot more ingredients than the sauce on here, so not sure how good the meat sauce is on this recipe but looks like a decent basic meat sauce. I added a layer of fresh mushrooms that I cooked in Italian dressing, really made this lasagna pop! Everyone said it was better than our local Italian Restaurant, which is really good.

I combine a can of cream of mushroom soup and freshly grated parmesan cheese with the cottage cheese and egg which results in a creamy layer of goodness. Instead of the canned tomatoes, I use pasta sauce, homemade is the best however store bought works well too.

everything was great except...... you guessed it - cottage cheese has no business in an Italian recipe. get some ricotta from the deli, not the dairy isle. it makes so much difference.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I did make a few changes to suit my tastes: I like a meatier lasagna, so added 1 lb of ground italien sausage.  Also used real minced garlic instead of garlic powder and added about a tbsp of italien seasoning to the sauce.  Took another reviewers advice and used 1 1/2 cups white wine and only one cup water.  Always use ricotta instead of cottage cheese. No cook lasagna noodles will work just fine for this recipe with the extra 1/2 cup of liquid.  This got RAVE reviews including "this is the best lasagna I've ever eaten..." SD

This recipe is awesome! It took me longer than I thought because when I first read through the directions I didn't realize the sauce had to be simmered an hour. It was worth it though. I did use a whole cup of parmesan because I love cheese though. I will definitely make again.

I had been searching for quite some time for a recipe like the one I used to use in the 70s. I was in high school and actually threw dinner parties for my friends and my specialty was lasagna - made from a fab recipe I got, I think, off the box of lasagna noodles. After trying several different recipes from this site, this is the WINNER. If it is not the exact same recipe I used 'back then,' it is very close. Very flavorful, cheesy and gets rave reviews every time. None of the other lasagna recipes I tried (and I tried several in advance of a big dinner party I was having) came even close -they were either bland or runny or both. This is the most like a lasagna you would get if you went to a good Italian restaurant.

This was my first attempt at lasagna and it was pretty easy to do. It was pretty good just have to remember LESS SALT next time. Too salty for my taste.

Very yummy Lasagna, I didn't have any tomato paste so I used one can of crushed tomatoes and one jar of pasta sauce.  I also omitted the water and added some extra garlic and red hot pepper flakes for some kick.  I also added some green pepper and mushrooms.

I made this exactly as stated in the recipe, and it is the best lasagna I have ever had.  It is also the first lasagna I have ever made, and it is so easy.  Don't hesitate to try this recipe; it is fabulous!

Wonderful lasagna.  I've made this a few times with great success each time.  Just remember to let the lasagna 'rest' for about 15 when you remove it from the oven.  You will be able to cut nice, clean servings.

I thought this was a very good recipe. The sauce part of the recipe was simple and delicious and I plan to use it in the future for other pasta dishes. I made it using the cottage cheese and loved the creaminess of it. The way it was layered was different than I am use to. I think next time I will make enough of the cheese mixture to add some to the first layer of noodles. And, I may mix in some ricotta with the cottage cheese, too. I think Italian sausage would be good in it, too. Overall, a very good recipe and I will be using it again! Thanks RBLAIR!!

Made this tons of times...you may need a little more sauce then the recipe calls for.  I sometimes use the cottage cheese, sometimes ricotta, sometimes a blend of both!  A family favourite.

This is excellent lasagne! I'd never used cottage cheese before, but since hubby doesn't care for ricotta, I was very pleased at how well it turned out. I did add about a tsp of basil. It makes a lot for two people but it freezes very well.

I love the ease and the simple layering instead of mixing up every layer, like some use.  I used the cottage cheese but used my potato masher to get it to a creamier consisitancy.  My husband doesn't like ricotta, and I have to admit it's not my favorite.  Now I know what I'm making for Thanksgiving Eve!  As many have said they add certain seasonings to taste, but most of the members of my family like bland - this is a great medium and I can always add my red pepper flakes to my portion on my plate.
Thank you.

This is far and away the absolute best lasagna I have ever made or eaten, anywhere, ever. I didn't change a thing except to leave out the onions because no one in my house likes them. I HATE ricotta cheese and I have been on the hunt for a recipe that didn't use it. Well this is it, I will never use another lasagna recipe again. Even my picky husband had THIRDS. Thank you!!

Just what I was looking for!  However I did not bake it!  I made it in a large stew pot and simmered it for an hour or so.  I ate some of it for dinner and then froze the rest in glass jars.  Microwave to thaw, and then heat it to proper temperature and then (LOL) I just eat it out of the jar.  No dishes mussed up! Live alone so I can get away with this!

my son was not crazy about lasagna, but he loves this one.  I used 12 noodles instead of 9 - we don't like a lot of cheese and it turned out great. I also add a little bit more salt and suger.   My husband and sons loved it.  it's a keeper!

Excellent! My first lasagna ever --- and it tasted like MOM made it! I used ground turkey instead of hamburger to make it a bit less fattening. I also layered 4 noodles across on each layer instead of 3. I thought I couldn't cook! I was wrong!

I agree with another rating, this is wonderful.  If a very fussy two year old finished his plate and asked for more what more can you ask for. Stayed with the cottage cheese and whipped it to break up curds(be sure to use large curd).  Now one of our favorites for sure.  Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely loved it.  I halfened the recipe, just for a try because I've tried several different recipes.  I love the substitute of cottage cheese over the ricotta.  I added a little bit more sugar and not as much of the salt.  I also used the italian flavor crushed tomatoes, and I made a little more sauce.  I like my lasagna saucy.  I will definitely make this again, a keeper - thanks for sharing.

I love it! My Husband likes it with Ricotta also so when he makes it he uses that. I use Cottage Cheese always bcuz I think it has more flavor. I also add about 1 Tbsp chives.

This is the best lasagna I have ever tasted--bar none. I added fresh spinach to it, because I wanted more nutrition. I will use this recipe again and again.

Very easy and delicious! I didn't have some of the spices needed, and I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. My husband loved it, but I felt like it would have been much better if I'd used the cottage cheese and proper spices. Next time I will definitely stick to the recipe and use cottage cheese!! The ricotta lacked in taste ...

This is an awesome lasagna.  I like how the dish is assembled and I also prefer the taste of cottage cheese to ricotta. I found this recipe on this site a few years ago and it is the only lasagna recipe I've used since.

Excellent basic lasagna recipe.  I made it "almost" as written and it came out beautifully.  Used ricotta instead of the cottage cheese (as just about everyone else has)- a personal preference.  Also, tried the trick that someone recommended of soaking the noodles for 40 minutes rather than boiling.  Easy to soak them while the sauce was simmering. This seemed to keep the noodles from becoming too soggy and worked great.  Oh, and I sauteed two large cloves of minced garlic with the onion rather than using garlic powder. Family is fighting over the leftovers.  Next time I would perhaps use some Italian sausage along with the ground beef, but otherwise would change very little about this recipe.  Thanks Linda!

I'm a college student and being the first real meal I've ever made, this was extremely easy & tasty.  My boyfriend who loves lasagna went back three times! My advice would be to like others use ricotta cheese instead of cottage, other than that there is nothing to change about this great recipe.

This is an excellent recipe as is! No need to change anything. A few tips I have are: Mix the tomato paste with water before adding in. Use fresh garlic 2 cloves/tbs and saute them for a minute or two in onions. Try it with the cottage cheese even if you don't like cottage cheese. *I* used 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta. I also added fresh mushrooms to onions and garlic. I steam spinage and chop it and add it into cheese mixture to get some veggies in. This recipe is one of my favorites and I LOVE lasagna!

What I love about this recipe is how straight-forward it is. I didn't have to break out the measuring cups or spoons! Mixed cottage cheese and ricotta, as others here suggested, and tossed a generous amount of oregano and some Italian seasoning into the sauce, along with some mushrooms I had on hand. I also added 2 cloves minced garlic (next time more), in addition to the garlic powder. I doubled the sauce recipe so that I could have leftovers to freeze for spaghetti, and since I had so much, I made four layers of lasagna - 3 noodles bottom layer, 4 noodles each layer after, and alternated ricotta/cottage cheese and mozzerella layers. It was so easy and simple, but it came out fantastic, much better than fancier, more "complex" lasagna recipes with a zillion sauce ingredients.

This came out awesome. I did add peppers, mushrooms and onions to the sauce. Also added spinach to the cottage cheese mixture. Using the no-cook noodles, this came out great. I can never do lasagna and now I have a great recipe. I even had left over sauce. Will definitely make again.

I used this recipe as a base and it turned out fantastic. My only gripe would be that it needs more meat sauce (I like it messy). I used a pound of ground beef, a large onion, two jars of pasta sauce, lots of Italian mixed herbs and spices, and a can of mushrooms for the meat sauce. 1.5 (350g) containers of cottage cheese, two eggs, 1.5 cups of shredded cheese, and two packages of frozen spinach for the cheese sauce. Soaked the pasta in hot water while I was making the above so they were soft enough to use but not stuck together. Put some meat sauce in the bottom of the pan, added a layer of pasta, then meat sauce, then pasta, then cheese sauce, then cheese, then repeated until everything was used up and the pan was full. Let it sit in the refrigerator overnight so the flavours could mingle. Then baked it at 350F for 1 hour covered with foil and for 30 minutes uncovered. Beautiful!

After eating this last night my husband said, "We won't have to eat out ever again if you keep making things like that. It was SO good!"

One downside was that I thought there wasn't enough sauce... luckily I had a jar of sauce and I added it to the top layer.  It gave it just enough flavor and I thought it actually was nice to have a layer without meat. 

Oh, I also made the sauce and then put it in the crock pot for an hour + while I ran some errands.  

I WILL be making this again!

I followed the recipe and added a few things.  I added Italian seasoning, fresh garlic, basil and spinach.  Even with the extra flavors it turned out to be bland.  Bummer :(

I was looking for recommendations to make my lasagna better and this recipe was IT!! I did not change anything. I like to at least make the recipe the way it is written before making changes. The only thing I did was add a little more of all the cheeses!! This was perfect in my book!!

My mom has used cottage cheese in her lasagna for years, and it is awesome! For those who hate cottage cheese (like me), try it anyway. It tastes nothing like cold cottage cheese. If you are still skeptical, or just like cheesy lasagna, I like to use both the small curd cottage cheese AND the ricotta. SO good!

Even my picky children liked this! I thought it was a little dry -- but that is probably because I used no boil noodles (was much easier to make) -- Will definitly make again! Thanks!

This was DELICIOUS.  Truly excellent.  The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the sauce just wasn't enough.  I added wine and mushrooms to it so I thought there would be extra, but it actually wasn't enough and I had to make more.  I'd recommend doubling the sauce portion.  But it tasted great! :)

I was looking for a less labor intensive recipe than my own for a quick meal for family. I didn't use cottage cheese (forgot to buy it) and used ricotta instead...excellent dish. Would recommend and will make again.

As I always do, I made it exactly as offered for the first time, (wish everyone would do this)  Found the oregano a little overpowering.  Next time will cut the oregano by about 1/2.  Otherwise very good.  On weight watchers...made 8 portions, and each was 12 points.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was wonderful. My dinner guests even asked for the recipe to take with them. I will always make this lasagna.  I guess I added more layers than what it called for. So that was the only difference.

We've used this recipe several times, and it wows me each time. Consistency, ingredients, and flavor are the best I've ever had, anywhere. Last time I used no-cook lasagna noodles and it was still perfect (yet faster to make).

I have made this lasagna a few times now and it is by far the best I have ever had. I use italian sausage in place of hamburger and I also use the cottage cheese and its superb its lots more cheesier then ricotta stick with the recipe and the sauce makes the dish! I do however not use the full amount of water in the sauce recipe and I only simmer till my noodles are cooked and its still the best.

Best lasagna!! I HATE cottage cheese but LOVE it in this recipe!! I've tried ricotta cheese also and didn't like the texture of it. I like the creamy texture from blending the cottage cheese. Also, I prepared this the night before. I pulled it out of the fridge and put it in the preheated oven and baked 40 mins covered with foil and 20 mins uncovered.

Excellent-only change I made was I used 1 clove of fresh garlic chopped instead of garlic powder and blended the cottage cheese with store brought shredded Italian blend of cheeses (Romano, parm, & fontina) instead of just parm.  Delicious and a lower calorie option! Thanks for posting this recipe!!!

Excellent!! - never made lasagna with cottage cheese before, always used ricotta - well never again!  Cottage cheese is so much creamier - I used a mixer to smooth out the cottage cheese - used jarred sauce & ground beef/sausage mix - this is a new family favorite!

WOW!  This lasagna is great!  I have made it 3 times since discovering the recipe a few months ago!  Definately add frozen spinach to the cottage cheese mixture (gotta have a little green).  I also change up the spices in the sauce each time depending on who the lucky eaters are!

Awesome lasagna recipe the whole family loved.  I followed the recipe exactly, even down to the layering process. I have used cottage cheese in lasagna before, but never creamed it. It works so well doing it this way.  A keeper!

Made without any changes/substitutions, my husband and 4 year old son hated it, 2 year old daughter liked it and I thought it wasn't bad.  Am still looking for a mind blowing Lasagna recipe, haven't found one yet.

It was excellent! I did add more garlic and more seasoning, but otherwise proportions and taste were great. I followed the advice in one of the reviews about cooking it half way the night before and finishing off with cheese and 15 (more like 30) minutes in the oven and would do it again, it's always better the next day :-)

I thought this was a very yummy lasagna dish.  I used both Ricotta and cottage cheese, about 1/2 and 1/2 proportion-wise and I used Kraft parmesan/romano grated cheese from the can.  A splash of red wine in the sauce and like I said....a very yummy lasagna dish.  Even better the next day when the flavors had a chance to 'marry'.

This is an excellent recipe. I highly recommend it. Opening up the cans of tomato paste and tomatoes is not that much more work than opening up a jar of spag. sauce. I cut down on the salt and kept the 1T sugar amount.  I added 2 eggs and put down 3 rows of 4 noodles in the pan.  Next time, I think I will add some zucchini and spinach to the ground turkey for added flavor!

This is now my new lasagna recipe!!!  It was easy to make and delicious and i LOVED it with the cottage cheese!!! USE THE COTTAGE CHEESE!!!  My boyfriend hates cottage cheese, nonetheless he LOVED it in this lasagna recipe.  I am a cheese lover but i did think it was a bit much mozzerella, but nobody else did, so if i did change anything it would be to just use a tad less mozzerella,  but other then that i wouldn't change a thing!!!  EXCELLENT AND EASY :)

I did not care for this recipe. It could be spiced up with herbs and veggies...and take away the meat which  makes it feel greasy in your mouth.

I followed the recipe to a t with the only change being using raw noodles.  Having said that, next time I will not simmer the sauce so look and keep it wetter so that the lasagna is a little more moist after cooking.  I LOVE the sauce may use it for pasta some time in the future.  Thanks for sharing.

SO GOOD! The only thing I changed was using ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Also, I used the oregano, basil, garlic (i think) tomato paste and didn't use onion powder. I did everything else exactly and the sauce was amazing!! I'll definitely make this again

A huge hit at my football party- I did adapt it a little: half lb. beef/half lb. sausage, used 10 noodles, added extra garlic powder, added a Tbl of basil, and I ran out of sauce for the top layer, so I had to use a jar of Sweet Tomato Basil Classico sauce. Not too much cheese at all, in fact, I used extra! While the sauce took a while to simmer, it was extremely easy to make, & it made my house smell divine when company walked in. This will be added to my rotation. YUM! Don't hesitate- make this dish tonight!

Best lasagna I have ever eaten!  I followed recipe exactly.  I can't believe how great the cottage cheese tasted in the lasagna.  So much better than ricotta.

I really liked this recipe - this is my first attempt at a "from scratch" lasagna - I usually use bottled sauce.  I did feel that it was a bit salty.  Next time, I'm going to cut the salt way back - maybe only 1/2-3/4 tsp.

Love this lasagna! So easy to make. I like the blending of the cottage cheese with the parmesan, it really makes a nice texture - you truly do not need to substitute ricotta in this recipe.

I made this recipe last night and it was a hit....I pretty much follow the recipe.  I just added a little more spices.  I added some Italian seasoning, dried basil and fresh garlic.  The dinner turn out wonderful.  Oh yeah I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  Thanks Linda for sharing your recipe, it was GREAT!!!!

Amazing, my name is Linda and this recipe is almost like the one I have used for 30 years. Why then did I give it a low rating? I never, never, put water in my sauce because it tends to make the recipe runny.  I also add pepperoni to my sauce.

I was excited about this recipe because I love lasagna, but it was a little too tangy for our family.  I am not a picky eater! :) My house did smell wonderful while the sauce was simmering.

This was my first time making lasagna, and I did enjoy it!  I will make the recipe again, but I think I will use ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese, and maybe a little less oregano (personal taste).

While I thought this lasagna was just "alright" my boyfriend absolutly LOVED this lasagna.. I did add a few modifications to the recipe though...

I added about 1/8 tsp of fennel seeds to the sauce, about a tsp of italian seasoning. I also added 1.5 cups of water the the sauce  (rather than 2 cups) and added 1/2 a cup of red wine (a cabernet that I had on hand). Like everyone else I used ricotta cheese and I added a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture. I think next time I will add some garlic powder to the ricotta mixture as well. For the mozzerella rather than buying preshreded mozeralla, I bought 2 lbs of "fresh" mozzeralla and shreded it myself (this made it SO much better) To the final layer of shredded mozeralla I also added some shredded cheddar which made it extra cheesy and yummy. Thanks for this recipe! It is AWESOME!

This is my first time to rate anything on allrecipes, though I have been using it for years.  My husband raved and raved about this recipe--so much that I felt obligated to rate it.  I think one reason he loved it so much not only was the ingredients, but also even the assembly method which is different than the other recipes I have used in the past (i.e. sauce and cottage cheese were put together.)  IN THIS RECIPE, they are kept separate by layers of noodles--making it more moist.  Definitely a keeper!  FABULOUS!

I didn't simmer for the full hour, and it turned out just fine! ;)

Well I always come to this site for new recipe's and like the high rating's usually.  However, making this exactly the way it states I found this to be a very salty lasagna, also not enough sauce and the sauce to be thin.  So if I were to try this recipe again I would eliminate the salt & pepper and also double the sauce ingredients and cook maybe add more paste to it.  But my friend and I did clear our plates so I give it a 3.

I have been making this recipe for years and love it.  I don't understand people that are rating THIS recipe saying they used Ricotta Cheese.  It doesn't even call for that.  Try the Cottage Cheese.  It's good!  This is the only way I will eat cottage cheese. I don't like it usually.  Give it to try and you can't even tell it's cottage cheese.

Used ricotta in place of cottage cheese, otherwise followed recipe as is.  Very easy to make, this is my first lasagna.  Turned out great!  Whole family loved it!  Will make again & again.

I made this recipe exactly 'as is' and I'm disappointed that all the four and five star ratings didn't meet my family's expectations of this.  In our opinion, this recipe was lacking in the sauce and could have used an extra 6 oz can or two of tomato paste (with added water), or perhaps tomato sauce.  I also would exclude the sugar and add a few other seasonings instead.  Overall, it was too dry for our taste, as we prefer a bright 'red look' to our lasagna, thus a lot of more sauce than what this recipe offers.  Just our personal preference.

This is a great dish Rhonda, I would make some slight changes but will not post that because this recipe as is, is great and should only be changed to suit personal taste.  I give it a 5 and recommend this recipe highly as is.

My husband loved this. I did do alot to the recipe, dropped the salt like other said to do. I added 2 cloves garlic chopped, and uesd diced tomatoes with the basil, oregano, and garlic already in it. I added italian seasoning to the trukey that i uead in pleace of beef. so I have to give it 3 becues I had to add alot to it. I will make this again the same way I just did.

Being from the South I was always told "If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all".  That's why I never rate a recipe unless it's 5 stars.  Linda, this is a wonderful recipe and we loved it just like it's written. Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband made this lasagna recently when I was working late a lot.  It was just what I needed when I got home.  The flavors were fantastic and since I am not a big ricotta cheese fan, the cottage cheese was perfect.  Also, he added a pinch of rosemary, red pepper, and basil to the sauce before simmering.

I made this tonight, and it was great! I Love the sauce and I think the next time I make spaghetti I will use this recipe for my sauce!

 I did add some mushrooms in with the onion to simmer and some fresh garlic as well. 

 I also added 6 slices of provolone cheese, Im a big fan of cheese.

 This recipe was by far the best I have tasted I will make it again, and again and again. Thank you SO much for sharing it!

I made this exactly as stated and it was wonderful! Just the best! So easy and with minimal ingredients. That being said, after reading some reviews , I may add a bay leaf to the simmering sauce next time, but that would be it :) I like that there is adequate sauce that the edges of the noodles don't try out as usually happens. This one is a keeper!

My grocery store was out of Ricotta so I figured it was a good time to try a Lasagna with Cottage Cheese, I'm not a fan of Ricotta anyway.  Followed the recipe exactly except for some added basil and fresh garlic.  I do believe I found a new favorite!

This is The BEST lasagna I have ever made! I followed the recipe almost exactly as written, the only changes I made was to put the cottage cheese in the food processor to get it the consistency of ricotta, and added some fresh garlic to the pan with the onion. You have to try this recipe, and don't switch the ricotta, you can't tell the difference in flavor but the price between ricotta and cottage cheese is all reason for me to use it! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good and even better the next day!  I soaked the noodles in water for about 45 minutes instead of cooking them.  I also used a jar of Ragu sauce, 1 can of crushed tomatoes, and 1 can of tomato paste. I doubled up on the oregano, also.  It was good the first day, but the leftovers were even better!

My father in law is from ny and hasn't had great lasagna in years. I prepared it for him with ricotta and 4 cloves of fresh garlic minced in the meat sauce.Also addedparsley flakesand used diced tomatoes. It was the best he had in "forever". This is my lasagne recipe from now on. Also made a doudle batch of sauce to cook meatballs and sausage in. This is the sauce I use for most of my pasta recipes now...love it

This is great lasagna and I did use the cottage cheese.  I put the sauce in the crock pot for about 3 hours on high and I used the no bake noodles to save a step.  Tasted even better the next day.

Added 15 oz of ricotta cheese with the cottage cheese mixture. Husband approved of it but I thought it was bland. The rest of the family liked it so 5 stars since I had the minority vote.

This recipe is the same recipe for lasagna that I have been making for 44 years.  The only difference is that I use bulk Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  This makes a HUGE difference - much better.  It would be a 5 star if you used the Italian sausage.  I also use more mozzarella cheese with a layer of slices on top.

I did not care for this lasagna.  I followed the directions exactly, except that I used a 16 oz container of cottage cheese, and it's a good thing I did.  I could barely taste the cheese.  I thought the sauce was too acidic.  I really prefer my other recipe that uses jarred sauce and a lot more cheese.  Sorry, Linda!  Fortunately, my company liked it...or maybe they were just being polite.

Good lasagna. My changes were to add 1 TBSP sugar to counter the acidity. I also added 1 tsp basil and 1 bay leaf and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Yum.

Excellent!!  Very similar to the recipe I have used for years except that when I make spagetti sauce, I always make lots and freeze some and I use it in place of your tomato sauce.  My sauce also has lots of garlic, but that is to my taste.  My daughter always asks for my recipe, but I had nothing in writing - I will be giving her this one!

My husband and I did a double take when the recipe said 2 cups water... I trusted the reviews and added 1/2 cup wine, and 1 1/2 water, the oregano, italian seasoning, minced garlic,  omitted the salt and sugar. My canned veggies were all no added salt - due to my being on a low sodium gluten free diet. I couldn't find my mixer cord so I ended up stirring the cottage  cheese and egg mixture. I also substituted chopped feta for the parmesan. I used gluten free (rice) uncooked lasagna noodles  and just layered them like the other reviewers suggested. This turned out really well. We didn't miss the sodium (probably because of the sodium in the cheese. My husband was not sure he cared for the wine added to the sauce... My husband's rating was 4.5. The only thing he would have done differently was add heat to it. My IL's loved it and had seconds. Thanks for sharing!

omg! This is my new Lasagna recipe.. So easy to make and delicious! I added 2lbs of ground beef and upped the oz's of crushed tomatoes to 28 for more sauce...I also tweaked the amount of spices and salt, sugar, etc to accomodate more sauce.

We loved it! We doubled the mozzarella. I only simmered the meat sauce 20 minutes because we do not like it thick. We did not have enough to layer as directed so we will double that also next time.     (94)

The sauce was so delicious!  We all enjoyed this lasagna greatly.  I did cut back on the mozzarella cheese (used 1/2 lb) and thought it still was cheesy enough.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I mixed up this recipe exactly as written but baked it with foil on top to keep it from drying out (as suggested by another reviewer).  Tasty but WAY too salty.  I was suspicious of 2 teaspoons of salt but added it anyway.  Would be better with 1 teaspoon.

I have looked for a good lasagna recipe for years.  I've tried all kinds of recipes, ones that use cottage cheese and ones that use ricotta.  I love this lasagna recipe.  But most importantly my kids love it.  My kids are very picky.  I usually have to keep reminding them to eat their food during dinner time.  I was very surprised to see how fast they ate this lasagna and I didn't have to remind them once to eat it.   I really liked the sauce.  I think it has a really good flavor.  For me the sauce is what makes a good lasagna.  I thought that the lasagna held together really well when I cut pieces and scooped it out of the pan.  I'm guessing that is because withought it being covered with foil during cooking it dries out a little.  Altough it was good this way I tend to like a lasagna that is a little juicier. Next time I may sprinkle the cheese on top of the lasagna and cover it with foil before baking it for 30 minutes.  Then remove the foil and bake uncovered for the last 15 minutes. Thank you for ending my long search for the perfect lasagna recipe.  I've now found it!

This was my first attempt at making lasagna and it did not disappoint.  My husband and I are lactose intolerant so I used lactaid cottage cheese and veggie shredded mozzarella.  Most recipes call for ricotta so I was happy to come across this one and finally make a lasagna we can eat.  Thanks Linda!

Everyone loved this! I used Italian-spiced tomatoes and added basil and a bay leaf to the sauce. I also added some fresh garlic cloves when cooking the onion. I followed the recipe, using cottage cheese, and blended it up to make it smooth. It was awesome! I also used whole wheat, no-pre-cooking lasagna noodles, and no one could tell; it came out perfect :)

All I can say is that if you don't like this lasagna, YOU are doing something wrong! This turned out AMAZING! I doubled the recipe and added an extra tablespoon of sugar (because I like my tomato base things sweet) but besides that I didn't change a thing. I loved this so much that even the next day (when I had no leftovers because it was such a hit everyone ate seconds) I was tempted to make another batch. This is for sure my favorite lasagna I have EVER had!! Thanks Linda, you are a great cook!!

I don't like to rate a recipe if I change much, but I had to work with items I had on hand.  Hoepfully this will help someone else.  I made two pans (needed to use up some ingredients), but I used one 15 oz. container of WHOLE MILK ricotta combined with a 6 oz. container of plain Greek yogurt.  Only used 1/2 cup parm total, even though I doubled the recipe.  I used tomato puree, not paste (about 42 ounces, or a 28 oz can and half of another), and added water until I had enough sauce for both pans (about 5 or 6 cups of water)- keeping in mind that it would reduce some after simmering.  Skipped the crushed tomatoes (didn't have any), but stuck with the proportions for the seasonings.  I also added chopped mushrooms, chopped black olives, and a minced half of a bell pepper for flavor.  For the noodles, I used regular lasagna (NOT no boil) but let them soak in HOT water for about 45 minutes while the sauce was simmering until they were soft and pliable.  I assembled the lasagnas, let them sit for almost 30 minutes before baking (to enhance flavors), and then placed them in the oven at 375 degrees UNCOVERED for 40 minutes.  I then removed them, added the layer of mozzarella, and baked COVERED for another 25 minutes.  This way, it is not soupy, but the cheese doesn't brown or get crunchy at the end.  Another tip, let it rest for about 10 minutes before cutting and you will get a cleaner slice. Perfection!

Great! Minor adjustments only... added garlic while browning the beef, added a few additional seasonings to the sauce, and only used 1/2 the water. I made the sauce the night before, simmered it for an hour, then refrigerated. The next day I warmed the sauce on the stove and assembled as directed. Excellent lasagna! Thanks :)

This was an excellent Lasagna base!  I was very skeptical of the cottage cheese, but it worked brilliantly.  It melted right in and the whole dish was not the least sloppy--very easy to dish.  I did make some adjustments: I added a finely chopped carrot and celery to the onion to make a proper mirepoix.  I also used real garlic.  I used a 24 ounce can of tomatoes (the stuff in the larger can is usually higher quality in my opnion).  In a large pan, I brought the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and some olive oil to a high temperature--almost scorching them so as to caramelize some of the sugars.  Hindsight I should have also added the sugar as well.  Alton Brown does this step under the broiler in your oven--either way, caramelizing the tomato sauce really gives it a deeper flavor.  Once I was done browning the tomato sauce, I added white wine to the tomatoes instead of water, and scraped in the brown bits.    Then I mixed in the meat & vegetable mixture and let it simmer in a crockpot for an hour.  Lastly, I cheated and used no-boil noodles.  Next time I'll try a suggestion read in the comments and soak regular noodles in cold water while I'm doing the other steps.  All and all I'll be using this as the base for future lasagnas.  I had to knock off a star because I dont think it would have been as good had I used water--all tomato sauce should have wine.

I consider myself a great cook but have never found a lasagna that was just right.  Most have too much sauce or just when baked the texture of how the noodles are place just doesn't make it chewy and good.  THIS WAS THE BEST I HAVE MADE.  The only substitute I mae was using a regular size jar of Ragu Marinara flavor sauce to which I added the cooked ground beef. I usually think I HAVE to have the ricotta, but wanted to try the cottage cheese as I had it on hand and it was TRULY GREAT!  I used the "powdered" Kraft parmesan for the parmesan cheese and used about 50% MORE mozarella.   I think what made it so good was -- a bit of sauce on the bottom followed by noodles, then more sauce (JUST LIKE THE RECIPE SAYS FOR LAYERS) then mozzarella then noodles, then ALL the cottage cheese (no sauce in this layer) then noodles then the rest of the sauce.  I usually have put a little of everything in every layer but this way of layering seemed to make it SO much better!

This is my new lasagna recipe!  My only changes were that I used ricotta cheese rather than cottage cheese and I probably only cooked my sauce for 30 minutes.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Really close to my Mother's recipe.  Gee, I don't have the option to give this recipe more than 5 stars.

I'm not a big fan of lasagna, but my husband is.  I made this with the cottage cheese.  I put the cottage cheese mixture through the food processor and pulsed a few times.  It was wonderful and I will be making this little jewel again.  Thanks tons!

I made this today, only doing half ground beef and half sausage. I only made a half batch because making a whole batch would take us a couple days to power through. Simple enough to put together. I'll update how it was after dinner. EDITED: Very similar to Pioneer Woman's. Hers just has a bit more flavor.

Excellent recipe. The sauce must be simmered for one hour. I added basil and a bay leaf and some extra Italian seasoning and oregano to mine. I also used ricotta because I had it one hand. It turned out really well. I got compliments on the sauce.

I've made hundreds of lasagnas all from different recipes because I have never found a recipe that I wanted to make twice. They usually end up with that acidic taste you get from using jarred sauce. An Italian chef told me that only meat, onion, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, and some dried herbs should be used for a traditional meat sauce. So I came across this recipe which met this advice. I would say this recipe is very close to a 5*. I think all it needs is a little more taste. This might be achieved by following Meg Champagne's advice, which is to cook the lasagna the night before and then, on the day of, covering with mozza and cooking another 15 min. I also followed Andrea F's advice and used a hand blender on the cottage cheese mixture to get it to the same consistency as ricotta. Definitely do this because cottage cheese tastes better (and is cheaper) but the consistency of ricotta is better for lasagna.

This lasagna was fantastic! I switched cottage cheese for Ricotta, and used about 3/4 lb hamburger and 1/4 pound spicy Italian sausage. It was fantastic and my fiance and father raved about it!

It is hard for me to find a good recipe for lasagna because I am allergic to garlic and onion.  I left those out of this dish, and it was still delicious!! -definitely not bland like a lot of recipes (when I leave out the garlic/onion).  My husband loved it so much that I even made the sauce for spaghetti night too.  I had never used cottage cheese for lasagna before, but it tasted great... the only big different I made was using ground turkey and low fat cheeses to make it slightly less fattening.  Also, used the no boil noodles to save time.  Will continue to make this often, thanks!

This recipe was great! I usually make chicken & spinach lasagna, so this was a nice change. I was looking for a recipe with homemde sauce & cottage cheese and this was perfect. I used fat free cheeses to eliminate some calories and added fresh mushrooms & a bit of hot italian sausage to the beef for a kick. Yummy! Thanks Linda!

AWESOME! everyone loved it! 
i just slightly changed the recipe: instead of just beef i used equal portions of beef, veal and pork, like my italian grandmother uses for her meatballs. also, i added some italian seasonings and i used ricotta cheese. and i had to add another cup of water to the sauce. 
the lasagna had REALLY GREAT FLAVOR! will make this again, for sure!

I've made this recipe several times now and everyone loves it.  I make it with ground turkey and whole wheat lasagna.  I've tried some different versions now and they all come out wonderful, such as: adding fresh spinach leaves(sauteed first and mixed in with the cottage cheese mixture) or adding fresh cut up mushrooms to the sauce mix or adding fresh cut up red bell peppers and zucchini to the sauce mix.  The great thing about this recipe is that you can modify it very easily by adding ingredients to change up the type of lasagna you make.

very yummy recipe.. easy to make.

was my first time making my own home made lasagna and it turned out beautifully.  this is definitely a keeper... loved it

i did cut down the sugar to one teaspoon though as other users said it was a little too sweet for their liking, and i thought it turned out perfect.. everything else i left as is.

please try this with the cottage cheese, it's not what you think it would be!! the cheese melts, and has great consistency... no curds. i prefer it's consistency over ricotta, and it's cheaper. the flavor is also amazing. try it both ways if you like, but don't knock it til you try it.  i won't switch back to ricotta!

I disagree with the other reviews indicating that cottage cheese shouldn't be used - I've been making a recipe much like this one for about 20 yrs, always use cottage cheese and always get rave reviews.  The only difference is I use about half the water (or none at all if I'm in a hurry and don't have time to simmer for a long time), no sugar & I now cheat and use Italian seasoning instead of individual spices.

For a healthier version replace the ground beef with thinly sliced mushrooms and chopped sweet peppers - it's awesome!

This was a very good meat lasagna recipe - my whole family loved it even my little picky eater. I did make a few changes just based on saving time and ingredients I had on hand and it was still delicious. I used a can of tomato sauce instead of the chopped tomatoes, instead of 2 cups of water I filled the tomato sauce can with water and added that (aprox 14 oz. so just about 2 cups), I cooked the meat and onion together with garlic italian herb seasoning - once it was browned I added it to the sauce and let it simmer while my noodles cooked until just soft enough to bend. Once the noodles where pliable I prepared the lasagna according to the directions. I will definetly make this again. - Thanks!

I loved this!  I usually make lasagna with ricotta, but I stuck with cottage cheese for this one and I'm glad I did.  This had an excellent flavor and was not dry at all, as some lasagnas tend to be.  I did add a little basil and I think next time I will reduce the salt.  Other than that, it was perfect!

I love this recipe, and have been making it for years (with a few changes). Frozen spinach makes a great bottom layer and cottage cheese without the egg and Parmesan works perfectly. This recipe is a great way to use up your left over spaghetti sauce. (I often make a double or triple batch of this lasagna, cook it and then freeze it for another time.)

This is one fantastic recipe.  My husband doesn't like lasagna, but agreed to try this one and he's absolutely SOLD on it.  I made two small changes.  I swapped in ricotta for the cottage cheese as so many others have done.  But I also smashed, diced, and threw in 3 cloves of garlic at the "saute the onion" stage.  I'm grateful that Linda had such a great recipe, and I'm thankful her daughter Rhonda is kind enough to share it with the world.

Yum!  This was great!  I made it for a 20-person family gathering and it got rave reviews.  The sauce seemed a little salty before I assembled the lasagna, so I added some more sugar and it turned out perfectly.  I can't wait to make it again and add in some fresh veggies, extra Parmesan cheese, etc.

I loved the ease of this recipe! It was good and a snap to put together. My whole family loved it, too. I will make this again, but will add more garlic.

I've made this several times in the past 6 months--thank you for a delicious recipe!  It is AWESOME!  My husband loves it and everyone I have made it for raves about it.  I usually make two pans so we can either freeze one or eat the other pan the next night.
Thanks again!

I have made this twice now, and everyone loves it. I made it the night before and refrigerated. In the morning I put it in the oven at 170 for 4 hours with foil over it, while we were at church. Once home, I brought the temp up to 350 and put the layer of moz on top. Worked out perfectly.

Until this recipe, I always felt like Goldilocks when it came to lasagna recipes - none was "just right." Now I don't have to search any longer.  This recipe is it for me.  The only change I make is to substitute tomato puree for the crushed tomatoes (I like my tomatoes smooth).  For variety, I sometimes substitute sausage for the ground beef.  The recipe also freezes and reheats well.  Individual servings go from freezer to plate after about 6-7 minutes in the microwave.

I made extra sauce like previous posters suggested.  Also replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta since I like it better.  The sauce was bland in taste.  I had to add a LOT of seasoning to make it edible.  It tasted to tomato-y.  Just using the ones in the reciple lacked flavor and would have ruined the lasagna.  It wasn't bad but I had to make many adjustments to make it worth eating.  Sorry Linda.  It just wasn't tasty the way it is posted.

No wonder this recipe has so many 4 and 5 star ratings!  This was delicious!  For years, I had simply gone by the instructions off the box of lasagna noodles, but the small changes in this recipe make it a winner.  I especially enjoyed making the sauce myself.

I did thaw some frozen spinach and squeezed the water out and added it to the ricotta/cottage cheese mixture.  It gave it very nice coloring.  And that's another thing -- I did half ricotta, half cottage cheese blends with the shredded parmesan.  I also used italian blends for the shredded cheese in the layers it was called for.  Lastly, another change was I browned nearly 1 lb of lean ground beef, but added 3 links of hot italian turkey sausage (removed from skins).  It added a robust flavor!

I found the cooking time and temperature to be appropriate as well.

I can't wait to tweak some spices and herbs on my next attempt just to see what kind of spin-offs of the recipe I can get.

Delicious... mine was not very saucy at all, but plenty of cheese and was absolutely fantastic.
Made according to recipe.... people were pleased with the cottage cheese instead of ricotta-- try it that way before you just say it doesn't work!

Next time I will make more sauce, however.

I made this for my fiance’s family they are still taking about it.
I made it exactly as directed and assembled it in the morning, threw it in the fridge, removed it about 30 minutes before cooking.  I think I baked it for about 45min then added the cheese threw it back in the oven.
I am so excited to have a great lasagna/sauce recipe!

I have made many lasagne in my day but always looking for something better. I like the idea of not using jarred sauce. I must note however that I used the 28 ounce crushed tomatoes instead of the 14 ounces and the sauce was still pretty thick. I like it a little less thick for lasagne as I personally don't like it dry. Next time I'll add some more water as others have mentioned. Overall good recipe.

Use cottage cheese! It's makes a huge difference so creamy and delicious (don't worry it all melts into an ooey gooey yummines.  To the cottage cheese layer I often add fresh chopped basil and up to a cup of fresh cut baby spinach.  Instead of ground beef, I use Italian sausage.  To the sauce I add a pinch of baking soda, cuts down on the acidity.  Even without my alterations this would be a 5 star recipe, I just like making it more to my personal taste.

Absolutely delicious! I was hesistant to try with the cottage cheese but I prefer this flavor over ricotta cheese.  I inadvertently used 1 TB Italian seasoning and 2 TB sugar but flavor was still fantastic.  This is a keeper! When combining the cottage cheese, egg & Parmesan, I used a potato masher to get the lumps out of the cheese (so the kids/husband wouldn't figure out the different ingredient!).  I also tossed in some parsley for color to that mixture. Thank you RBLAIR for the great recipe!

Like many others, I've become famous for making this recipe. I even switch it up sometimes with ground turkey! Not sure you want to try lasagna with cottage cheese? If you have ever had Stouffer's lasagna, then you have had lasagna with cottage cheese! It's delicious and despite what some other say, it works really well!!!

This is my go-to lasagna recipe now, I started using it about 2 years ago and we LOVE it. If I want to go easy on myself, I just put HUNT'S spaghetti sauce in place of the way Linda suggests. It always turns out great!

I used this recipe instead of the other one with high ratings because it was easy. And it was easy and delicious. My mom used to make her lasagna with cottage cheese and when I found out it weirded me out. Now that I'm all grown up it seemed like the healthier option. I also substituted ground turkey for the beef. PS.. I think the person who said it was way to salty may have used garlic salt instead of garlic powder.

I love it!  It is delicious and holds together well. I like the orginal recipe and sometimes I like to use turkey and italian sausage.  My family likes basil and parsley parsley so I add them to the meat mixture and I add parsley to the cheese mixture.

This is great but I use oven ready noodles and add some parmesan to the sauce and meat.  Also use shredded moza & pamesan in between layers with the cottae cheese.

If you have kids, (or  not so small kids) that don't like chunks of onion in anything, put the tomato sauce in the blender.  Add the onion, and while you're at it add some celery and sweet peppers, (any color) and blend.  They'll never know.

I made this for our family Christmas party and they loved it.  My dad said everything was perfect..and they even used cottage cheese when we were little...I added a few extra spices and let the noddles sit in hot water to cook instead of boiling..it was perfect!

I added basil and a cut the water down to 1.5 cups and added 1/2 cup of red wine.  It still came out a little bland and not enough sauce to cover the last layer of pasta.  I would add Italian sausage, more of the cottage cheese mixture, and Italian seasoning next time.

Very very good! Loved by my family too! When I was blending the cottage cheese and egg mixture together I threw about a 1/3 of a bag of fresh spinach in. Excellent! Kids loved it and were getting there veggies!

This was only my second attempt at homemade lasagna and it was so much more successful than the first!  It wasn't too dry and everything stayed together nicely when cut.  I used a 15 oz package of ricotta instead of the cottage cheese and an extra clove or two of fresh minced garlic.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  My boyfriend and his roommate both loved it and went back for extra helpings.

My 11 yr old daughter said "thank you, Linda!" and my picky 15 yr old ate 2 helpings--last time I made a lasagna recipe she wouldn't touch it.  We used ricotta instead of the cottage cheese, diced tomatoes and tomato sauce in place of the tomato products and water here and reduced the mozzarella by half. Next time we make it I am going to try the idea of prebaking it and finishing it the next day.  And we will be making this again--it's a real keeper!

Well, I thought I already had the best lasagna recipe....but my hubby just informed me that this is THE one!  I have to admit, it is very good.  Made it exactly like the recipe except baked about 10-15 minutes longer than directed as I had to make it this morning before work and then refrigerate till I got home.  Thanks for the NEW BEST recipe!

This was my first lasagna it was fabulous! Made my own Lasagna noodles using the recipe "A farewell to basil fettucine" for my first attempt at pasta.   I used turkey meat instead of ground beef since we're not a red meat family.  Plus I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage, but I think next time I'll try the cottage cheese since my mom makes lasagna with a cottage/ricotta cheese mix.  I LOVE garlic so I also chopped up 5 cloves of garlic and sauteed them with the onions instead of doing garlic powder & it didn't come out wicked garlicky.  With the basil noodles in this recipe all my family could say was 'YUM'!!

I have to say I was not thrilled with this recipe. My mother makes a better lasagna. This one was bland and VERY dry. Looking at other recipes, I noticed this one had a lot less sauce, so I used two cans of tomatoes, making more sauce, and still that wasn't enough. I also didn't like that the cheese was in one layer; eating the lasagna, I would get these huge globs of cheese, and the flavors just didn't  mix well. The lasagna was better the next day reheated, but, overall, this recipe was just ok, and I cannot understand the rave reviews. If you want to try it, I strongly suggest doubling the liquid in the sauce.

Wow!  I have made several recipes, including other lasagna's from this site and this is the first recipe I decided to review.  This lasagna is AMAZING!  I made it as directed and the cottage cheese works perfectly if you use a blender.  It is so creamy and delicious.  I have found the only lasagna recipe I will ever use.  My husband gets lasagna at any italian restaurant we go to and he was blown away.  He went back for 3rd's.  He was also stunned to find out it had cottage cheese and no ricotta.  If you want the best lasagna ever, stick with the cottage cheese.

This lasagne was phenomenal. I have 3 older boys and usually a house full of their friends...they all absolutely loved it. The friends said it was the best lasagne they had ever had. It's become one of my favorite dinners to make plus having the leftovers is wonderful. You could use the meat sauce alone over pasta for a tasty Bolognese sauce.   Before putting the lasagne pan in the oven, place it on a cookie tray so any spill-over will be easy to clean up.

We loved this!!!  The onions added enough sweetness to the sauce so I did not include the extra sugar, and I used half turkey instead of all beef to be healthier.  Why would anyone use ricotta instead! Cottage cheese is waaaay healthier (high in protien, low in fat), and once you blend it, the texture is exactly the same.  After reducing the sauce, the flavors got pretty intense, so I may use more water next time, as I needed some extra sauce to help the no-boil noodles reconstitute.  Really great!

Super easy and excellent next day too! Definitely use the cottage cheese for this recipe instead of ricotta. I used lowfat cottage cheese & it tasted great. Very good flavor!

The best lasagna I ever had was from a little Italian restaurant in NYC. One of the things that distinguished it was that it wasn't seasoned in a way that was overwhelming - you could enjoy the separate flavors of tomato, pasta, cheese and herbs.  This is very similar to that recipe. It's delicious-not at all like Stouffers, but also not super spicy.  I added 1TB of mixed Italian spices- not just oregano- and real minced garlic instead of garlic powder, but those were my only changes.  My husband and I both loved this recipe. We both enjoy super spicy foods- but we appreciated the subtler flavors of this lasagna. Update: the one thing I would have to add is that you may find that you need more sauce or you will have a dry lasagna- so adding a little more water, a jar of tomato sauce- or just having some prepared spaghetti sauce on the side when it comes time to layer would be helpful. 
And maybe its just me, but the layering instructions could be more clear - like sauce, noodles, sauce, cheese, noodles- etcetera.

My husband thought this was wonderful I thought it was ok. It taste like a homemade lasagna. I like more of a traditional Italian lasagna.The part that I did like was that I had all of the ingredients on hand and did not have to go to the grocery store to buy anything!

For the purpose of total disclosure: I would have made this exactly as written except the store was out of crushed tomatoes, so I used a 15-ounce can of tomato sauce instead. Also, I used 8 ounces mozzarella cheese and 8 ounces of sharp cheddar cheese (family preference) instead of using only mozzarella.  My family loved it. For picky eaters, such as my son, except for the flavor it adds, you can't even tell the onions are in there, as they cook down so well. My son doesn't like the 'crunch' of onions.  I'm not sure why so many people are anti-cottage cheese. I've always made lasagna with cottage cheese. The way this recipe calls for it to be mixed with Parmesan cheese really adds a nice flavor and makes it easier to spread out over the noodles.

This is the best lasagna I've ever had!!!! I used 14 ounces of ricotta cheese instead of the 12 ounces of cottage cheese.  I've made it with the crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes and both work well!

This lasagna is wonderful and so easy to make.  Everything fit perfectly in the pan.  It cut nicely and tasted like heaven and I had all the ingredients in my pantry.  I did use an extra half pound of ground beef because I like a little more meat in my lasagna.  This recipe won't disappoint.

This is the ideal classic lasagna.  The Bride of Mobark has simplistic culinary tastes and this does not exceed any of them.  It's fantastic left over too and super easy to make.  Highly Recommended by Mobark himself

Tried it - loved it! The sauce was a bit sweeter than I would usually make, but that's minor. I followed the directions exactly, even using cottage cheese, and thought the result was yummy.   Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This recipe was great & easy to follow!  I never made lasagna with cottage cheese, but it was great! Everyone loved it and went back for seconds! Oh, I don't eat beef or pork, so I used ground turkey instead!  It was perfect and made for less grease than cooking with ground beef!  Thanks!

I'm not really sure why someone would ever say you "can't" make lasagna with cottage cheese, I grew up with that kind of lasagna, which is why I chose this recipe for dinner tonight.  My mother-in-law had dinner with us and said that's what everyone (including her) used to use "back in the day," but now they use Ricotta instead.  In any case, I made it exactly as it was written, and my whole family loved it.  Even my oldest daughter, who really doesn't like lasagna (I keep trying different recipes to see if I can find one she likes) said she thought it was the best lasagna yet.  And I  have also made the "World's Best Lasagna" from AllRecipes, so I guess that's saying a lot.  It felt a little strange, not layering the cheese/egg mixture, but in the end, it tasted just fine.  I am anxious to try the leftovers tomorrow.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe Linda!  It's a keeper!

I prepped this a couple of nights ago and, WOW. Instead of using beef I used ground deer instead. I did up the seasonings a little bit though, and added some minced garlic to the meat mixture. For the cheese filling, I used a mixture of ricotta and cottage cheese, and it was out of this world. I let it sit for two days in the fridge before cooking so the flavors could really sink in. Overall, a really good recipe.

I am only half Italian, so I made this recipe twice. The first time because I had cottage cheese that I needed to use up and was curious as to why half the lasagna recipes on this website say to use this type of cheese. I blended it with a hand mixer like a previous review had suggested. The end result is lasagna that tastes like it was made with cottage cheese. No one would eat it. But I wanted to give it another try, so the second time I used a mixture of good quality ricotta cheese and marscapone cheese instead and it was excellent! I think people who don't like ricotta use the stuff in the grocery store that is next to the cottage cheese. That stuff is grainy and gross. Use real 'rigott' people!

I made some modifications, but it was very good. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough sauce, but I'm someone that likes lots and lots of sauce.  I mixed the cheese mixture with a hand mixer to make sure there weren't any cottage cheese curds, and I used shredded parmesan in addition to grated parmesan. Very yummy though!

I made this for the first time last week for a dinner party.  It turned out great and my guests devoured it!  When I make it again I may take some of the other suggestions to add additional seasonings to the sauce.

I can't believe someone thought this tasted like Stouffers!!!! This recipe also came from my mother and I've been making it for twenty years.  It is a superb recipe.  Don't let the "Stouffer" review keep you from making this awesome lasagne!

This is very good lagasna. I cooked the sauce for a few hours in a small crock pot. My husband is a vegetarian so I made another small pan and used zuchinni in place of the meat. Also really good.  I also used fresh basil in the cottage cheese mixture. Very yummy.

Obviously Stouffers has some bangin lasagna because I loved this recipe. I wanted a recipe that was easy to make and tasted good because it was my first time making lasagna; this recipe did just that. I thought it was fun and easy to make and I didn't have to go spend an arm and a leg for the ingredients like one recipe I saw. My whole family loved this recipe and I will use it over and over again!

An easy, tasty basic lasagna recipe.  My daughter loved it!  The sauce recipe was a special hit--I think she would have been happy to sit and eat a bowlful of the sauce alone, which is a thick chili-like consistency.  I doubled the amount of crushed tomatoes and used fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder, plus ricotta instead of cottage cheese.

Being from Florence...I was amazed that someone would even think of making lasagna with cottage cheese!  I certainly would not be doing it again. I wanted to give it a try and followed others...RICOTTA, and lots more cheese!  Other than that it was alright.  Good luck!

Great recipe! My husband loved it (I don't eat meat)! As the other reviewers stated I also found it short on the cottage cheese mixture and would probably double it next time.

Very good lasagna.  Takes a long time to make.  I didn't let the sauce simmer for an hour as that was just way too long to wait for me.  My husband really likes it and it wasn't very hard, just time-consuming.

This was my first time making lasagna, and I had to make it for 10 people! This was pretty good. I doubled the recipe and used half cottage cheese and half ricotta (and still with the parmesian cheese called for) and it tasted great. I just mixed it up real good w/ a fork to get a creamier consistancy. Since I doubled it I ended up just buying a bulk of 3lb motz. cheese and ended up using the whole thing! I didn't boil the noodles; instead I soaked them in the same 9x13 pan I planned on cooking the lasagna in with VERY HOT water for 30 minutes. Worked perfectly! The one thing that kinda turned me off was the "sweetness" of the oregano. Maybe I'll use a little less next time. I made this on Sunday and had leftovers the next night and it was sooo much better! It's so weird how that is! Next time also I will make it a day ahead of time so all the flavors soak and mesh together. Give this one a try, you won't be disappointed!!

This tastes exactly like I remember my mother's lasagna tasting.  I have been using ricotta my whole adult life as I thought that it was how lasagna should be made.  But this is way better.  I served for company tonight and most of them had three helpings.  This is my lasagna from now on.  Thank's so much for the recipe.  I put it together the night before, by the way, and then baked as directed the night of the party.  I think that helped the cheese layer to set up a bit.  Yummy!

If you use ricotta you are not following this recipe.  USE THE COTTAGE CHEESE!!! Don't let it scare ya.  If you want a recipe using ricotta, there are several of those on this site.  But I highly advise giving the cottage cheese a try; it is the ONLY way my mother ever made it growing up, and it could not have been better. ?

We loved this!  I used whole wheat lasagna, 1% cottage cheese, mixed a big handful of frozen (squeezed out the water) Spinach in the cheese mixture and used less mozzarella to make 1/8 worth only about 8 points for weight watchers.  It was really filling and delicious!

This was such a delicious dish!!! It tasted good, it smelled good...what more could I ask? My mom smelled the tomato/meat sauce and thought it was a really yummy spaghetti sauce, so I did another separate batch and we ate it as a spaghetti dish as well. Definitely a 5-star recipe! Thanks, Linda!

This turned out wonderful & was SO easy!  I changed it a bit, using ground turkey, ricotta instead of cottage cheese, 2% mozzarella, whole wheat pasta and added mushrooms.  This one will be made frequently!

Yummy.  I followed the recipe to a "t" and really really liked it.  I also tried it with ground turkey and it was still delicious.

Just the recipe I was looking for.  Only alterations were I added mushrooms, green pepper and celery all finely chopped.  I also used cheddar instead of mozzarella as I didn't have any.  Will make a point of buying some mozzarella next time though.

Excellent!  I am coming off a popular diet that helped me lose 27 lbs, and I needed a healthy lasagna recipe.  I used whole wheat noodles, ricotta instead of cottage cheese, Italian flavored turkey sausage, and low fat mozarella.  I halved the cheese.  I used the slow cooker idea from another reviewer for the sauce.  FANTASTIC.  My husband was thrilled.  He never takes left-overs to work, but a big chunk was missing from the left-overs this morning.  This one is a keeper!

This is the best lasagna I have made, and I have tried a lot of recipes. Some changes I made were using two cloves of fresh minced garlic, in place of the garlic powder. Instead of a small can of crushed tomatoes, I used a large 28 oz can.  I also add one teaspoon of dried basil to the sauce while it is simmering.

I LOVED this lasagna, I rate things at my house on a scale of 1-10 and I gave it an 8.5 (which is very, very high) my husband gave it a 7--he said it needed something. I loved the subtle taste. It was wonderful. I did use ricotta cheese this time, since I am not a huge fan of cottage but I am going to make it with cottage cheese next time. This is going in my recipe book. :)

I am very new to making lasagna, but after making this one I have found my recipe.  I used cottage chees like the recipe says, and it was delicious! My famil loved it.  Sometimes I use a half burger and half italian sausage to spice it up a bit, and am a huge garlic user, so more is added.  I always make a double batch and freeze one, and I think the second one is always better.  This is a keeper.

Easy to follow and a great base recipe for lasagne. I don't care much for ricotta cheese and thought the cottage cheese was great. My husband is a BIG lasagne lover and said he would have preferred the ricotta. Either way, I encourage people to give the cottage cheese a try. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the same recipe that my husband has always done and taught me to do as well. The only difference is we leave out the onions and use Presto Sauce cuz it's easier. But it's really good. Don't change it to ricotta cheese unless you've actually tried it with cottage cheese. It's very good with the cottage cheese, and it's not lumpy like some people have worried it is. Great recipe!

My husband stated in horror, "Lasagna with COTTAGE CHEESE...yuck!" I told him to try it and if he didn't like it, he never had to eat it again. One taste and he was hooked! I have made this for guests as well, and they all think I am quite the "gormet italian cook". Thank you so much for this recipe! I proudly tell them where to find it so they can pass it on as well.

This was really tasty.  It reminded me of Stouffer's lasagna, only this was better because it was fresher.  A very good basic lasagne to make and easy to put together!  I especially liked the cottage cheese because I don't care for ricotta at all.  My husband gobbled up 2 big pieces, so it must have been good.  Definitely worth making at least once!

I changed a few things for the tomato sauce.
1. I used two pounds ground beef.
2. Instead of dried oregano I used fresh with quite a bit of fresh basil and parsley. I also threw in a good amount of cayenne pepper.
3. I changed out the two cups of water with two cups of red wine.
4. Instead of cottage cheese I used whole milk ricotta.
5. Next time I'll skip the sugar, even though it's a smal amount. The sauce seemed oddly sweet and didn't have a very good tomato flavor. So, I added can of tomato sauce which helped a lot. Then cooked the sauce down half an hour more.
However, if you add the extra beef and tomato sauce you'll need a bigger baking dish and more noodles unless you don't use all the sauce.
I served this with a creamed corn casserole, spinach salad, toasted garlic bread and rhubarb pie. It was fabulous. One of the best lasagna recipes I've ever tasted!

This recipe was a hit!  I modified it (as per other posters) to suit my tastes:  added a package of breakfast sausage, can of mushrooms, and a few extra spices.  I've tried other versions and this was, by far, the best.

My Husband and I just finished eating this...YUMMMMMMEEEE.  I, unlike a lot of reviewers, used cottage cheese, just like the recipe calls.  It's delicious.  I followed some tips from other reviewers and cooked the meat, etc... in a slow cooker, then i cheated and used oven ready pasta.  It turned out to be a delicious "No Fuss" meal.  Will definitely make it again.  BTW, playing Mario Lanza while enjoying this meal really sets the mood.  ;o)
Enjoy!

My wife made this recipe, after a botched attempt by me to make it. Instead of cottage cheese she used ricotta cheese, and it turned out fantastic. I'm not a huge lasagna fan and even I liked it.

Made this the other night, and I thought it was just o.k.  I used the no boil noodles like someone else suggested and they worked wonderful without the step of boiling the noodles.  I prefer the American Lasagne that I found on this site. Thanks for the recipe.

This was good, I use hot italian sausage rather than ground beef.  It requires less draining of the meat, gave the lasagna a little kick.

I am giving this five stars because it's an excellent recipe.  It's not 100% to my liking but part of it is definitely my fault.
I will definitely try it again but I will make changes: 1) Less than 2 tsp salt  2) Ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Cottage cheese was fine but I REALLY like ricotta. 3) I like mushrooms so I will add a can of that.

I agree with the person who said it tastes like Stouffer's.  Not necessarily a bad thing but I can see myself looking for another recipe on occasion for a more homemade taste.

Delicious restaurant quality lasagne. I was very happy with the result, both the taste and the finish. The only change I made was Ricotta instead of Cottage Cheese. I am going to try Cottage Cheese the next round.

This is the first lasagna I ever made and my mom, sister, boyfriend, and friends all loved it. I used skim milk ricotta instead of cottage cheese but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was completely devoured in a matter of minutes.

Awesome Lasagna! Decided to use the cottage cheese and was pleasantly surprised. Used no boil noodles so added some extra water for the noodles to absorb, it worked out great. Drooling thinking about how good this was!!!!

This recipe was so simple to make and turned out perfectly. I made it with 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef just b/c I like my lasagna to be on the meatier side and also used 1 1/2 lbs of mozzarella b/c my husband loves cheesy lasagna. I didn't boil the lasagna noodles, I just soaked them in hot water for 20 minutes before layering and they came out perfectly after I baked everything. I'm happy to have found a recipe that has such simple ingredients and that comes out so deliciously!!! Definitely a keeper.

Yummy! I see another reviewer said you can't use cottage cheese in lasagna and to use ricotta instead. Not true. I've been making it with cottage cheese for 30 years and always get rave reviews. The Stouffer's frozen lasagna (which is quite good) also has cottage cheese in it.

Excellent!  I was worried about it getting too "soupy," (which it wasn't) so I decreased the water slightly.  I shouldn't have done that because the leftovers were slightly dry, but still very tasty.  And I recommend using the cottage cheese, no substitutions.  Stick to the recipe, it's great as is!

I am getting ready to make this for the 4th time, it has become our staple lasagna recipe.  The only change I made is only used one can of tomato paste, and added one 14.5 ounce can tomato sauce.

Delicious recipe - thank you!  I made this recipe for my family for Valentine's Day and they LOVED IT!  I used ground Turkey instead of beef and 1/8 tsp. Sweet Stevia powder instead of the sugar.  I pureed the cottage cheese mixture in my food processor and added fresh snipped parsley to it.  I also added 1/2 c. of water to the sauce because I don't care for dry lasagna.

This recipe is AMAZING! :)

I made it for my boyfriend. I had seconds, he had thirds. Then he took the leftovers home to his family, and they gobbled the rest up.

The only amendment that I made to the recipe was that I used half of the cottage cheese, and used ricotta cheese for the other half.

When I make this lasagna again (and I *will* make it again), I'll make more sauce. I ran out of sauce, and had to improvise with a jar of spaghetti sauce that I had on hand. It still came out good, but I would've preferred to only use the sauce that I made especially for the lasagna.

Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

My entire family loved this lasagna, agreeing that it was the best we had eaten. I did wish I had a bit more sauce, but everyone else disagreed with me and said it was perfect as it was. 
We'll be using the recipe often!

I never even tried lasagna b/c my husband hated ricotta chesse so I was alittle scared to make this but I decided to give it a try.. I followed the recipe exactly and OMG.. it was a HUGE hit! Everyone who tries it loves it and I now make it for my husband when he goes tailgating to the nascar races and all the guys rave about it and demand I make it the following year. I've even made it and put it in 2 smaller dishes so I could make one for dinner that night and freeze the other one to eat at a later date. Since I've never tried a traditional lasagna I can't compare the two but this one is DEFINATLY a keeper and I make it often! Thanks Linda!

Cottage cheese all the way for me! Growing up my mom always made lasagna with cottage cheese, when I started making it myself, I thought I would be "fancy" and use the ricotta, I have since gone back to cottage cheese. I prefer the extra flavour, and the smoother texture that it gives. I think this is a delicious lasagna. thanks for posting this recipe... ps, I add red chili flakes for a bit of spice, and lots of frech garlic, tastes perfect

Doubled the meat because I like mine meatier.  Used ricotta cheese and sauteed 1 onion, 1 green pepper and a cup of mushrooms to add to the sauce.  Recommend doubling the garlic as well.  Great recipe.  The household enjoyed it.

Excellent recipe!!!  I actually DID use the cottage cheese to see how it worked and it was awesome...had never tried it before. I Blended it and it gave great texture and flavor.  I actually don't eat cottage cheese but it was a great filler.  Next time I think I'll try half ricotta and half cottage cheese to see how it goes.  Don't knock the cottage cheese unless you try it :)

Great recipe. I used minced garlic instead of powder, ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and a 3 cheese Italian blend instead of mozza. I also didn't have time to simmer the sauce for an hour, just for a few minutes but it still turned out great. Will make again.

My husband is not a fan of lasagna but I made it anyways. He loved it! He said it is better than any lasagna he has ever had!  I too used Ricotta cheese per other suggestions and it was great! The kids loved it too, make it, you won't be disapointed.

This is a great lasagna recipe.  I did modify a bit; I used 8 oz. ricotta and 4 oz. cottage cheese, to get the best of both.  I blended all the cheeses (except the mozzarella) and the egg in the food processor, and it came out great. I also added a tsp. of basil and a tsp. of italian seasoning to the sauce, while cutting the salt in half.
I should've made more sauce, I ended up using part of a jar of spaghetti sauce to complete the recipe.  But I like my lasagna with a lot of sauce.

Unlike the other reviews, I went ahead and used cottage cheese as I think ricotta is too rich.  Wonderful recipe!

I am so in debt to you for this recipe. My husband is italian and loves his pasta. I made this recipe a few nights ago and he already wants more.  It was absolutly perfect. The only thing I added was a little shredded sharp cheddar along with the mozzerella and I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. and then along with my 1 pound of hamburger I added one pound mild italian sausage.  THANK YOU!

used Ricotta cheese, Italian seasoning, garlic powder. 
Next time: 1.5xsauce, a 1/2 lb Italian sausage, a bit more Italian seasoning.  It seems once you add the noodles, the seasoning disappears so make the sause a bit strong. 
I just can't seem to purchase the correct Mozzarella for pizza or lasagna, it just seems to be a hunk of cheese on top rather than melted gooey wonderful cheese.  Any suggestions?

This is handsdown the best lasagna receipe I have ever used!   I even used the no-boil noodles and it tuned out perfectly! 

My husband and I don't eat beef so we substituted italian pork sausage.   Other than that we followed the receipe perfectly and ended up with a lasagna that "stood" on it's own (it didn't fall apart and oooze all over our plates)  YUMMY!

This lasagna was INCREDIBLE!  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and I used ground turkey instead of beef - other than that I followed it to the letter.  There was enough sauce, it was cheesy and my husband loved it.  I've been looking for a great lasagna recipe and I have found it.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.

This was awesome!!! I followed the recipe exactly.   It was very moist, flavorful, and filling...wonderful!
Thanks so much...
I do recommend the "pre-cooked" lasagna noodles by Barilla...save time and hassle...

Delicious!  I made this for supper one night and there were no left overs!  I also add a little spinach to the cottage cheese for a little more color and flavor.

Excellent recipe!  Made 3 lasagna's for my son's birthday party and everyone loved it.  I did substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese.

This lasagna was a big hit! I made it for lunch on Sunday, when the whole family gets together. I thought one would be enough, but then I realized it was too little, I made a ham & cheese lasagna on the side, but no one wanted!!! They all wanted more of this one! Will definitely do it again!!!!!!

I tried this out a few days ago, and it turned out perfectly! The only things I changed was to bake for the 30 minutes covered, and I also added a package of chopped spinach. Will definitely make this again!

I, of course, did not follow this recipe 100%.  I sauteed onions until browned then added sweet italian turkey sausage and sauteed until all the pink was gone.  Then added a spicy italian pre-cooked sausage and a few fresh minced garlic cloves.  Let that simmer a bit until all the liquid was simmered out.  Added a little stock (I used veggie but I would use whatever is open in the fridge) to get up all the browned pan bits and threw a bag of fresh spinach with slivered carrots on top then covered to steam the spinach--about 5-7 minutes.  Cooked over low heat until the moisture was gone--again.  I added organic Bertolli "olive oil, basil and garlic" flavored jarred sauce to the mix. Used no cook lasagna noodles and fresh mozzarella--not shredded so I just sliced it.  I also did not have an egg so just mixed the ricotta with half asiago and half parmesan.  Wonderful!!!

I made this for my mom, sisters and kiddos on Mothers Day and it was a HUGE hit!!  Everyone loved it, so much so that they even divided up the leftovers to take home and my sister requested I make it again for her birthday dinner this year.  

I added some sauted onion, mushroom and green peppers, and an extra large can of tomato sauce to the meat mixture, as others have suggested and adjusted the spices accordingly.  I substituted oven ready noodles for boiled ones, increased the water in the meat sauce by about 1/2-3/4 a cup and baked for around an hour with the foil on and 15 minutes after adding mozzerella to the top.  I also used a 15oz container of Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and increased the amount of garlic (I used fresh minced) in the dish quite a bit (all adjustments were just to accomodate personal and family preferences, the dish is wonderful as the recipe is written).  

It was a lovely, hearty dish, thank you so much for the recipe!

I really enjoyed making this lasagna. I'm not crazy about ricotta cheese so I was glad that there wasn't any included in the recipe. Overall, it was delicious although the top layer was a little too crunchy. Perhaps cooking it over a slightly shorter period or at a lower temp would help.

Turned out fantastic, only changes I made were just using ricotta cheese and I added chopped zucchini and about 1 cup sliced mushrooms to the simmering sauce before baking. Will definitely make again!

Awesome!  I used Barilla's No Boil Lasagna noodles - worked out great!  Used a mix of italian cheeses and some monterey jack rather than just mozzarella.  Was even better the next day left over.

This was a really good and easy dish.  I am one to modify everything though. Here's what I did. Doubled the crushed tomatoes, added chopped baby carrots (this sweetens it in addition to the sugar), added one small can of mushrooms, added sliced sun-dried tomatoes; used 1.5pd beef, used 1.5pd mozzarella cheese. Finally, I did not boil the noodles but instead baked for 45 min, then 15 more with cheese on top.
Enjoy!!

This came out perfect.  I used regular Ricotta instead of the cottage cheese and just added a sprinkling of italian spices to the sauce.  I love the layering with the ricotta all by itself.  This will be our mainstay lasagne recipe now!

I baked this last night as my first ever attempt at lasagna.  It was so easy I was able to complete it while home alone with my 2 girls under age 5.  My husband ate 3 huge pieces & he doesn't even like Italian food.  It was awesome.  The only thing I changed was to use ricotta instead of cottage cheese simply because that's what I bought before I found this recipe.

I liked this recipe a lot.  I only added a small can of mushrooms to it.  It tasted better than "Bob's Awesome Lasagna" which I made a couple weeks ago (because of its number of 5-star reviews).  Although, this one did take a little more time to prepare.

This is a great basic lasagna recipe. The sauce is easy to make, and you can mostly ignore it while it simmers on the stove. My husband said it was lacking "verve," which I think meant he wanted more fresh vegetables included, and probably some hot pepper. So I'll make those changes next time for him, but I loved it as it was!

My husband said this was the best lasagne he had ever had in his life!  It was wonderful!!  Would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a good lasagne recipe. We like ours with alot of sauce, so I added 2 cans of crushed tomatoes and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  Also used no bake noodles and they worked great.

Very Good Recipe! I had to quadtriple this for the amount I needed for our visitors and they all loved it. The only things I did different which I do with any lazagna is I put 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 italian sausage. It adds so much flavor. I also use fresh garlic instead of powder. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my go to lasagna recipe. The simmered sauce is hearty and flavorful.  I use no bake noodles and assemble the day before, refrigerate overnight then let sit on the counter to come to room temperature before cooking. You will never be disappointed with this choice.

I don't normally like lasagna but this was absolutely excellent!! Three of us ate the whole thing supper lunch and even breakfast! I added mushrooms that was a huge hit. I used cottage cheese too!! Oh I also added some ketchup to meat mixture. That's a mainstay in our home with red meat. Awesome!! Thanks for sharing.

The recipe is very good. However I did add more Parmesan cheese for more flavour.  Salt and pepper. And more oregano and basil.

Love this recipe!  I make a pan of this for my 10 year old and me and we eat it for 3 days.  The only change I made was using quorn mince instead of meat for the vegetarian option.

I've been making this recipe for about 10 years now.  I'm in love!  It's my favorite meal, and everyone who tastes it thinks it's phenomenal.  

I have always made it with cottage cheese, and it is divine.  I don't waste time blending it until smooth because the texture will be perfect once it's baked.

A couple other time savers I always do:
1. Use one cup of water instead of two so I can cook the sauce for 30 minutes instead of an hour. 
2. I always just soak the noodles in hot water while the sauce cooks. 

Side note: I used to make this with regular noodles until about two years ago when I figured out I am sensitive to gluten.  Now I use rice lasagna noodles, and no one can tell the difference.

I'm a bit bummed because I put a lot of time into this recipe and it was pretty much just a giant cheese fest.  Super bland. I did add some red wine, sweet italian sausage and worcestershire hoping to add something to it. I think the meat sauce was good for a spaghetti sauce (adding in the wine, sausage, and worcestershire) but when all was said and done it was not good. Way too much cheese which overtook everything. My kids wouldn't even eat it.

Loved it! Used half cottage cheese, half ricotta and added cayenne pepper because I like spicy food. Not soupy at all! Will definitely make again.

I've made lots of lasagna in my day.   The first recipe I made was from the back of my mom's Mueller's lasagna noodle box.  It was awesome and normally that is the one I use OR I use this one.  However, with this one (and other one too) I always  tweak the recipes.  I add extra seasoning (oregano and basil)  and I always add more cheese.   This time I added extra moz.  and added a few slices of Gouda.  It was delicious and to me, tastes better warmed up the next day.    But this is a good go to recipe.   Thanks

This was my first time ever making lasagna and it was simple to follow and delicious !! Next time I think I will use 1 and 1/2 cans of tomato paste instead of 2 cans, I used a 12 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of a 14 oz can and it still seemed too saucy. I used mozzarella cheese, cottage cheese and Parmesan cheese, the cottage cheese made the cheese really creamy it was really good! I will deff make this again !

This is a very yummy lasagna. I personally love the flavor of the sauce. I added a bit more of the spices just because I like the sauce to have a boldest taste. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is awesome!!  as much as I dislike everyone changing the recipes in the comment section, I actually made a couple of changes.  I cannot have wheat so I substituted the noodles with Tinkyada brand brown rice lasagna noodles.  They worked great!  everyone in my family loved it!  I'm making it again tonight. I spiced up the sauce a bit with bay leaves and other seasonings.  Lots of people substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. Not necessary!! The cottage cheese worked great with this recipe.

My family enjoyed this meal and it is quickly rising to be one of our favorites. I will comment that adding the 2-cups of water was a bit too much in our opinion; we like the lasagna to have more body.  The second time and third time we made the recipe I reduced the water; I found that (for our personal taste) between 1 and 1&1/4 cup of water works best.  The flavor is fantastic from the beginning - however - it matures and blooms the next day (if you have any leftovers)!

I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out great!  I think it has to do with the layering technique. Also, don't be afraid to make some substitutions/additions, like spaghetti sauce instead of paste or adding mushrooms, etc. It will still be good.

Loved this!  Like any lasagna it is slightly time consuming, but worth it.  The only changes I made was used my food processor for the cottage cheese, cheese, and egg combo.  I also put the mozzarella on before the beginning of cooking.   I let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before cutting.

This was really good!  Great lasagna is definitely all about the sauce!  I made it from scratch, though I didn't use the recipe that was provided in this recipe.  This was a great base for me.  I didn't think I would enjoy the cottage cheese, but I did run it through my food processor with shredded mozzarella versus parmesan.  My husband loved it!

This is a good recipe for first timers like me...I added some Italian sausage and followed the recipe faithfully step by step..My husband loved it (especially the sauce) and next time requested I make MORE sauce and use less ricotta...Hearty and rich, this one is a keeper...And I plan on using this sauce on other pasta dishes as well!

Took a little time to make, perfect for weekends where time is available. Loved the recipe and will keep as a lasagna recipe - beats others that we've tried. When pulled out of the pan, it wasn't runny and messy.

This turned out fantastic! And quick too! Start to finish, we were eating in 1.5 hours. Even managed to walk the dog while it baked. We used only half the amount of cheese and it was perfect.. we like cheesy and it was plenty cheesy with just half. We also added half of a left over green pepper that needed to be used, finely diced. We also forgot to add the sugar, but it tasted delicious to us, so not sure what difference sugar would have done.

I've made this 20 times and I've added 1/2 lbs of italian sausage and 1/2 lbs less of beef. Also changed the cottage cheese for ricotta. I say why make this healthy with the cottage cheese when it should taste better.

This lasagna is great. I've made some more complicated lasagnas and I think this one is just as good with cheaper ingredients and less dishes.  I added 4 cloves of garlic to the onions and some mushrooms to the sauce cause I had them on hand. I stirred in about 1/3 cup of fresh basil to the sauce right before I started putting the lasagna together.  I used ricotta cause it was on sale, but cottage cheese is usually what I use-I think they taste exactly the same. Great recipe!

this was really good!!! i used italian seasoning instead of oregano, because i didnt have any. and i added some garlic to the onion when it was cooking. i sauteed some mushrooms and added it to the sauce, as well as some fresh parsley. SO not much different, just added some personal touches. we froze half of it and have leftovers in the fridge still!

SO good- i've made this a few times, using Morning Star meatless ground beef because I'm vegetarian, and I've also added a layer of ricotta cheese, and used crushed tomatoes with green chilies for a little extra flavor, and it's always a big hit- aside from my slight alterations I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out perfectly every time!!

I haven't actually tasted it; I've just put it in the oven.  I have just uploaded a picture: this is what "Linda's Lasagna" looks like when you get to the top layer and don't have enough sauce to finish it.  I dread to think that all this work is going to go to waste when my husband sees it and won't touch it because of how it looks!!  I will do my best to cover it with cheese but my hopes are low.  I followed the recipe exactly and used a 9 x 13 in pan.  What the heck????

So I'm only giving 4 stars because I just did not have enough of the sauce. I followed everything perfectly and just didn't have enough sauce. I'm not sure what happened. Regardless, it was good and I'd make it again - but would probably have to double to make enough sauce.

I accidentally used a larger can of crushed tomatoes--I believe it was 28 ounces--but the recipe worked out fine. Used the same amount of water as originally called for and got a rather thicker sauce, which still worked out nicely. I also used the "a little of this, a little of that" method with my spices and omitted the sugar. Great recipe. Simple enough to make, and everyone enjoyed it.

OMG, I thought my daughter sent this in! It's SO similar to my lasagna(and my name is Linda) which I got from an older Polish woman who was married to an Italian! I don't use the sugar and the cheeses I have changed to mostly parmeson but I also put in some Romano and I use two eggs and some parsley.

This was my first attempt at making lasagna ever and I wanted to impress my new husband and his friends.  It worked!  They all loved it and he said he even likes it better than his mom's!  It's delicious, not spicy, but not too boring either.  Just good.  Being a beginner, I didn't quite time the simmering of the sauce with boiling the noodles right so I did cut the simmer time down to 40 min or so and it turned out great anyway.

Made this for the church today and it was a hit! Adjusted for 12, it was messy to make but fun and the end result was worth it! The cottage cheese mixed with egg, some salt and Italian seasoning made it a great substitute for ricotta cheese.

Delicious!  My very picky 8 year old has eaten every bite of this when it was put on his plate....a rarity I assure you!  And , he has also said it tastes even better the second day!    Thanks for the recipe!  I used no bake lasagna noodles, and as another reviewer suggested I used an immersion blender with the cottage cheese mixture to take out any lumps.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely wonderful.... I switched cottage for ricotta cheese and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  My first shot at lasagna and I nailed it because of this recipe.  I can't stop making it.  Thanks for sharing, me and my wife love it.

I made this for my wife on Mother's Day and I have to say it was the best Lasagna I have ever had!  I omitted the salt, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Funny thing happened while making it though.  I realized too late that I did not have any shredded cheese so I had to quickly freeze the kids' cheesesticks and then grate those.  Still turned out great!

I used ground chicken.  Kept the cottage cheese, I would add another layer of the cottage cheese mixture.  It was delicious, but the extra layer of cottage cheese would be perfect.

I made this w/out using the cottage cheese and subbed ricotta only b/c BF would not eat if I made w/CC, I think that scared him. With that being said, I found this to be another basic cheese lasagna. It was good, don't get me wrong, just a normal, basic comfort meal. I had plenty left over & froze in squares for quick meals during the weekday- I guess I was looking for a little more pizzaz out of this recipe. It's a keeper to continue having on hand for cold NY nights. I think next time I'll sub the CC for ricotta & see if BF can even tell the difference.
UPDATE: 10/13/10 made this last night- as boyfriend was chowing down he said "gosh, I could eat this entire pan of lasagna" will keep in the books!

Very tasty, simple lasagna.  This was kid-friendly which is great, but I think if I were making it for a more adult palate, I would add some veggies.  Wonderful use of cottage cheese in place of the regular ricotta- just don't forget to blend it with the egg and parmesan so that you get a nice smooth texture more like ricotta.  This is now my go-to lasagna recipe! Thank you!

This is great.  The only change I would recommend is to taste the sauce before you add the salt...I don't think it needs any additional salt with all the salt in the canned tomatoes and tomato paste.

Love! didn't change a thing (ingredients wise!). Love making the sauce from scratch. I did use cottage cheese- i just put it in the blender to make it a smoother consistency. However, I didn't notice a huge difference from ricotta- even tho it has been awhile since i've had lasagna. I also might try crushing up fresh tomatoes next time.   per other reviewers suggestions, I just let the dry noodles soak in some water while the sause cooked, and that definitely made them easier to work with.

This is my new master recipe for lasagna. I made it last week only changing it by adding a pound of mushrooms to the sauce and I assembled it in the morning without cooking the noodles and let is set in the refrigerator all day until baking it for dinner. Very good! My husband requested it for his birthday!

Thank you for the great recipe!  My advice is to follow the layering aspect of the recipe.  This is also a VERY budget friendly version of lasagna.  Don't replace the cottage cheese with ricotta, but I do recommend blending the cheese with a hand blender.  This was wonderful!  Thanks.

Pretty good!!! The sauce was decent (that's why I gave 4 instead of 5... added more herbs and spices). VERY SIMPLE!!!

Amazing!!! This was the first lasagna I have ever made by myself before.  Very simple and easy to make.  The 2nd time I made it I replaced 1/2 cup of the water with 1/2 cup of cabernet merlot which I think added more depth to the sauce.Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe and weekly staple to my kitchen! :-)

I used turkey sausage instead of beef and ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Also, cooked a half hour and let sit overnight then cooked the 15 minutes. This recipe was amazing!

I made this recipe for our family Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! As far as the ricotta vs cottage cheese debate goes, I went with whole milk cottage cheese. I used an egg beater to mix it up into a creamy texture, and it tasted great. I also chopped up tome fresh parsley and sprinkled over the top after completion. I felt this really added to the lasagna's presentation. DELICIOUS!

Fabulous lasagna.  Rather than boil the noodles (I used 12, not 9), I placed them in my lasagna pan and let them soak in warm water while I prepared the sauce - it worked perfectly.  I substituted 2 generous tablespoons of jarred minced garlic for the garlic powder.  When my onions were nearly finished, I added the garlic to them.  Everyone in my family loved this recipe - my son even told me the lasagna was better than his grandfather's - a huge complement, since his grandfather prides himself on his sauce!

Within 3 months I've made this 6 times and absolutely loved it. I like to add cut spinach and mushrooms to the sauce, and to decrease the calories I would use sugar substitute, fat free cottage cheese, omit the parmesan (you won't miss it, it's already really cheesy), use egg whites, and fat free mozzarella. Personally I like adding cayenne pepper for a kick along with a little more salt.

I have always had a "tried and true" recipe for lasagne, but was always on the lookout for one that would beat it out of the park, and I have found it in this one.  It is absolutely delicious and easy to make.  My family all agree that this version is way better than the one I was using.  I am using this recipe from now on!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

This recipe is great. I did make a few changes just because of what I had and didn't have on hand.  I used a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes and only one 6 ounce can of tomato paste.  I also added 1/4 of a green pepper and a couple fresh mushrooms.  Other than that I followed the directions exactly.  My hubby said this was the best lasagna that he ever had.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.

This was a hit with my 2.5 year old and husband...even my mother-in-law loved it! Recipe was quite easy to follwo. I did change a few things: I used ricotta because I already had it on hand, fresh garlic instead of powder because I love it, and since I was short on time I only let the sauce simmer about 15 minutes but the lasagna came out very tasty and had wonderful flavor anyway. We're all talking about how much we can't wait to try it tomorrow after the flavors meld even more. Mmmm!!

I made this sauce for my own take on lasagna so I did the filling a bit differently, but the sauce was excellent!  Very flavorful and easy to make.  I did slightly decrease the amount of oregano and added a bay leaf while the sauce simmered for an hour.  My hubby was very impressed by this meat sauce.

Great recipe!  The whole family loved it, from my two-year-old to my husband.  I actually did not make any changes, which is very rare for me.  I did, however, add spinach to the meat sauce.  I love that it blends in well, does not change the overall flavor and adds lots of extra nutrients.  Fresh or frozen works equally well.

This recipe is great! Everyone who ever tasted this loved it. There is one thing I've changed though. Some other old reviews were right. Use ricotta instead of cottage.

I made this recipe with a friend of mine and I make it about once a month now. I love it. Everyone I've made it for raves about it. I added a lot more cheese however.

I'd like to give this a 5-star rating, but other than the cottage cheese and a slight difference in layering, how is this different from the classic Mueller's recipe I've been making for 30 years?  I could eat cottage cheese for 3 meals a day, but I can't imagine using it in lasagna, so I used ricotta instead.

I went the cottage cheese route and it was excellent, not the same as ricotta, subtly different and very tasty.

Made for Easter in 2009' 2010' and plan again for 2011 - Very good!
This is the BEST - make it along with "White Cheese Chicken Lasagna" every year for Easter - they get the best of both worlds! Serve a salad and garlic bread - just change up the deserts and the whole family is happy!! I make both of these and freeze them so I have time to make a great dessert to finish off the meal.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I still make and love this recipe.  I grew up w/ only ricotta in lasagna, so this was different.  The cottage cheese is great. I've been making this recipe for about a year now and have not felt the need to look any further for a good lasagna.  The sauce in this lasagna has become my standard recipe for any pasta.

I make this recipe every couple of months as a treat for my boyfriend or whoever might be coming over. It's delicious! In a pinch don't worry about using the pre-cooked lasagna noodles, they work fine in this recipe. I always add a few cloves of fresh garlic to the meat though and replace the cottage cheese with ricotta. I also add dried thyme to the ricotta/egg mix to give it some extra flavor. It always comes out fantastic and friends and family think I have some secret family recipe up my sleeve

Call me crazy but I think that the cottage cheese makes this dish so unique and delicious. Although this is not my default lasagna recipe, I use it often and I am always satisafied with the results. I final sprinkling of chopped fresh parsely and shredded basil are a nice and tasty touch to the dish once it has completed baking.

I incorporated many of the reviewer's suggestions as well as a few of my own and have to say I finally made a better lasagna than my mother-in-law!  This is what I ended up with: 1. I sauteed the onion with 2 cloves garlic (in addition to adding the garlic powder) and also threw in 1/2 a green pepper since it had seen better days 2. I had about a lb. of Italian ground sausage in the freezer that I combined with the ground beef 3. I used 2 cans of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and reduced the water to about a cup.  I also threw in basil and a bay leaf per one review. 4. In rummaging through my freezer I found a half bag (about 8 oz.) of froz. spinach that I threw into the sauce. You really couldn't taste it, but I like to think it made it healthier. 5.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and slow-cooked the sauce - but on the wood stove since it's still a bit chilly in Maine. 6.  Lastly, since I couldn't decide between ricotta and cottage cheese after reading the reviews, I used mostly cottage, but did mix in some ricotta Molto bene!

Sooo easy and delicious!  I used 15oz whole milk ricotta cheese instead of cottage. I baked it for 20 minutes the night I made it, then the next night I put it in the oven for 10-15 minutes, and then another 15 minutes with the added mozzarella cheese. (Don't go straight from fridge to oven though. Let it sit out for an hour or so, or else the middle will still be cold).  I was worried that I didn't make extra sauce, but it was perfectly delicious as-is!

First time I ever made lasagna and it turned out great.  I made it for large group of my family and they all thought it was wonderful.  Very simple to make even though the sauce has to simmer for an hour.  I actually needed that hour as I was putting together an entire meal and it allowed me time to prepare everything else.  Absolutely no changes necessary!

This was my first time making lasagna and I was extremely pleased. The only thing I left out was the onions [not a huge fan] but other than that, I followed the recipe to the T and it was delicious. Even my boyfriend, who swore no one could beat his mom's lasagna, has changed his tune. Great recipe!

Average at best.  A big disappointment considering the reviews.  Might have been better if I had used the Ricotta.  Still looking for a great lasagna recipe.

I made this quite some time ago, but I never did rate it.  Like many, I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  The noodles don’t need to be cooked in the pot of water all the way; they’ll cook some in the oven too.  Remember to let the lasagna “rest” for 10-20 minutes after cooking; this will allow the ingredients to bond together and will help keep the lasagna from falling apart when it is cut into.  One reviewer suggested that this lasagna be baked for 30 minutes the day before serving and on the next day, topped with the suggested mozzarella and baked for an additional 15 minutes.  I did this and the lasagna ended up being lukewarm in the middle and was not as hot as it should have been.  Although I think this was good advice, I believe the lasagna needs to come to room temperature prior to baking for the remaining 15 minutes; otherwise, the amount of time it will spend in the oven won’t be sufficient to raise the temperature from cold to piping hot.  Still, the lasagna got wonderful reviews from everyone who ate it.  My fiancé suggested cooking the boxed store-bought lasagna since he thought that the taste of the store-bought stuff would not be easily beaten (he wasn’t attempting to insult my cooking or anything :).  I am happy to say that this lasagna proved him wrong!  Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

I don't know what everyone is talking about. USE COTTAGE CHEESE! It does not get runny or any of that other stuff, it is delicious and much lighter than Ricotta which I never liked THAT much anyways. This recipe is delicious! I have made it with both ground beef and ground Turkey for a healthier option and both were great. The Turkey really doesn't taste that different in it (for all you beef lovers) and I would recommend it! I will make it again and again and again!

Made this for our family and it was awesome!  The only thing that I did differently was to add a few garlic cloves and one green bell pepper to the meat sauce.  Also, I didn't have enough oregano, so I used half oregano and half basil in the sauce.  I also added a little salt and pepper to the the cottage cheese mixture then blended it smooth in my food processor!  It was so yummy--my whole family was raving!

I was so thrilled on how good this turned out.  My whole family loved it which is a small miracle.  I now make this recipe to send over to new moms.

Thank you for a great recipe! My husband loved it (and he's picky about lasagna). I used ricotta cheese and added a lot of seasoning in the beef and added in some basil, fresh garlic (instead of garlic powder) and a bay leaf in the sauce. I was very pleased with the results!!

I make this with ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Sometimes I throw a handful or two of well chopped spinach into the sauce in the last 15 minutes of its simmer.  Definitely use the cottage cheese - at least once - before making the decision to replace it with ricotta... I've made it both ways and with this particular recipe my family likes the cottage cheese better.

I've won the lasagna war thanks to your recipe! My husband and I are just amazed how good this lasagna is! It's also easy and inexpensive to make. Thank you!

PS- the reviewer who said this recipe tasted like Stouffer's must have done something really wrong!

Loved this!  I added 2 large minced garlic cloves as well as the powdered garlic.  Additionally, I used sweet Italian turkey sausage instead of the beef.  It's awesome; however, I would bake it the day before you serve it, since the sauce is runny straight from the oven.  To me, lasagna is always better the next day -- the flavors meld & the sauce thickens.  YUM!

YUMMM!
I did use ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese/egg mixture. I also added shredded parmesan cheese on top along with the mozzarella. Very minor changes. But let me tell you this lasagna was amazing!

My 1st time making lasagna & it got rave reviews from everyone! I used 1/2 lb ground turkey & 1/2 lb of spicy sausage instead and followed everyone's suggestion to use ricotta cheese. So delicious!!! Everyone said it was the perfect amount of seasoning & flavor.

Amazing.  I added mushrooms, but left everything else the same.  Very yummy and not too difficult (but, like most lasagnas, a bit time intensive).

This was a good lasagna.  It didn't quite beat out the usual recipe, but I wanted to try another, so this was it.  It was good.  The sauce was decent, the lasagna was cheesy, and the instructions were easy to follow.  However, it was not quite up there with the one we usually use (World's Best Lasagna from this site).  This one is good, however, so I recommend it.  Thanks for posting!

Delicious! The only change we make is instead of using cottage cheese we use ricotta cheese. We made it many times and turns out wonderful all the time! A great dish to make on Sunday to have as a meal during the week!

Another 5-star review ! I made this lasagne with home-made pasta, a simple white sauce and a mix of cheddar and parmesan for the cheese. It was excellent. Also kept well in the fridge for 5 days.

I am not sure about the cottage cheese layer, but the sauce is to die for!  All in all delicious lasagna.  I didn't use boil noodles, but oven ready wheat pasta.  I also subbed ground turkey which was really good.

Excellent, easy recipe!  I didn't bother with mixing the cottage cheese, parm cheese, and egg in a processer or with a blender and it still came out great!  I do like the idea of skipping the simmer part and just using 1 cup less of water.  I might try that next time so the recipe takes less time.

This recipe diverted from what my boyfriend is used to in a Lasagna. But when he tasted it, after I told him this is the first home made lasagna I have made, he went "Wow," and I tried it and went "Whoa."
Very easy to make, especially when time can be an issue and it lasted us a whole week of lunches for the 2 of us.
Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

I am not a huge lasagna fan, but my husband enjoyed this recipe. I did not have crushed tomatoes, so I substituted in tomato sauce. I also blended the cottage cheese, egg, and parmesan in the food processor like some other reviews mentioned. It was good, but I am sure there are better recipes out there.

Sooooo flavorful!  The absolute BEST lasagna I've ever had, by far.  And pretty easy to make.  I skipped the 'simmer for 1 hr' of the beef/onions/sauce and only used 1c of water instead of 2c.  Cut my time in half almost - it took only about an 1 hr 15 min from start to finish.
Definitely will make again and again!

I am blessed to be in the prison ministry for incarcerated youth.  I tried this recipe to feed 100 people and it was so easy and has a fantastic taste!!  I marked it as a favorite!  I have tried the "oven ready" noodles and the "regular" noodles, and see no difference in them.  I also tried this recipe with yellow and zucchini squash.  It is great! This is a fantastic recipe!  Thank you for sharing!

I enjoyed this lasagne, but found it way too salty. I will make again, but will definitely decrease the salt. I will also make more sauce. There wasn't enough for the suggested number of layers.

Very good recipe.  I changed a few things like adding a can of mushrooms, used ground turkey instead and reduced fat cheese.  It was great though!  My husband and I both really liked it.  And if you are feeling weird about using cottage cheese, don't be!  You won't even really be able to tell much of a difference.  My husband actually prefers it over ricotta cheese.

2 picky kids truly enjoyed this.  it isn't too saucy or tangy - really pretty and perfect.  follow recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed!  updated:  made again using no boil noodles - just make sure your sauce covers all noodles and cook as directed!  fantastic.

My family really enjoyed this. The cottage cheese with parmesan and an egg blended is brilliant! It truly mimics the texture of ricotta! Next time I will use 1/3 less garlic powder. It was very noticable with 2 full tablespoons.

This was a really great recipe. I was in a hurry tonight so I started my sauce base as a can of prego. I added one can of paste and one can of sauce, then the seasoning and extra minced garlic. It turned out great, everyone loved it in my house

This lasagna is by far the best I've ever made/eaten! The last time I made this my husband couldn't stop talking about it. Made a couple of changes - bought the large can of crushed tomatoes and used 1 c of water versus 2 because of that and used ground italian sausage for the meat. Love this recipe!

This is honestly the best lasagna I have EVER tasted.  I have made it once with cottage cheese, as the recipe suggests, and once substituting ricotta instead.  I actually much prefer the cottage cheese...I think Linda knows what she's talking about!  Follow this recipe to the letter, and you're in for a religious lasagna experience.  I promise.  :)

This recipe was WONDERFUL!  It came together very easy.  Also, the sauce was delicious.  You could probably put the sauce on some pasta and forget the rest of the recipe!  I thought the cottage cheese would be awkward, but it was fine.  I tried to grind up the bigger curds, but when it was all together, you couldn't even tell.  Very delicious dish!

This is an excellent lasagna recipe.  I've tried a few and this is a keeper.  My husband loves it.  I was able to use Dreamfield's lasagna noodles (a healthier pasta choice similar to Barilla Plus), ground turkey and low-fat cottage cheese and mozzeralla and it still came out tasting fantastic!  My husband loves it.  To cut down on prep time I made the sauce the night before.  I may try the suggestion of baking 30 min night before and 15 the next day.  Also, I think the sauce does taste better when simmered for the hour.  Oh and I use several cloves of fresh garlic cuz that's just what I have on hand and we love garlic.

Turned out fantastic! I followed recipe exact & made this for a buffet style dinner party for 12!  I doubled the recipe so everyone got plenty & it was a huge hit! I used small curd cottage cheese & the most lean ground beef I could find. I served it with Ceasar Salad & Garlic Sourdough Bread.

I made this yesterday and it was easy to make and it is very good. I used to make lasagna a lot, using different recipes,  but quit making it because I got tired of it. This is the best recipe I've tried and probably the only one I will use from now on. Thank you Linda

I don't think I'll ever use a different lasagna recipe!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and I split the cottage cheese with ricotta.  This was so delicious!  I barely had leftovers, and even the leftovers tasted great.  Next time, I will double the recipe so that I can have more leftovers for the rest of the week.

This was great! I've been looking for an easy yet great tasting lasagna recipe. The only thing I change was the amount of ground beef. I used 2lbs because my husband and I love a lot of meat in our lasagna and not just a meat sauce. This was great recipe. I felt like a true cook!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Love this recipe! We've always used ricotta in it, after reading some reviews might try cottage cheese next time. Plenty for the 3 of us and tons left for the next day too.

This lasagna reminded me of the Stouffer's lasagna that you get in the frozen aisle of your grocery store.  It has a good flavor, was very easy to make, however, I felt it lacked that "wow".

I made this recipe with a little onion powder instead of fresh onion, and ground turkey instead of ground beef. I did use cottage cheese and that worked just fine (despite other reviews claims that it will not work).  I did feel the oregano was a bit excessive; I might replace the oregano with italian seasoning next time instead.  The leftovers were more amazing than when it was cooked fresh, so I would also suggest a partial cook the night before and refrigerating overnight, then cooking and serving the next evening.

I am a baker, not a cook, so this was a challenge.  I made this in advance and let it sit (unbaked) in the fridge overnight.  While the flavors were terrific, I thought letting it sit like that made it a tad dry, so next time I might add some tomato juice or another can of diced tomatoes.  Also, I again took the advice of the other reviewers (which I always need!) and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  My family couldn't believe I actually made this myself.

I made this tonight for my boyfriend's family, and it was my first time making a lasagna ever. Like others I switched to ricotta and also made it the night before. I covered it with plastic wrap, then with foil, and stuck it in the fridge. Then tonight I took off the plastic wrap and baked it with the foil on until 10 minutes until the end. The spices really sat well overnight and the sauce was even better than when I tested it last night. Everyone loved it, someone even had three large pieces of it! That indicates to me that this is a keeper!

This was good, not great.  I made a few changes to suit my diet: turkey meat & ricotta.  This lasagna could have used more red sauce.  I like mine a little juicier.  Next time I'll try adding more crushed tomatoes and/or water.

Love it!  I do advise to make more of the meat/sause mixture though.  I did the second time I made it and it was absolutely perfect.  Also adding italian sausage and/or pepperoni is always a plus.

This lasagna held up well.  The sauce had a wonderful flavor, however I wish I had made just a bit more for the top layer.  One item I would change, three noodles per layer was not enough, should be four.

Like others before me I use ricotta instead of cottage cheese. 

Not only is this my FAVORITE lasagna...the tomato sauce is fantastic on its own.

This sounds exactly like my mother's recipe that she inherited! The only thing not on my copy is the sugar, and I only let the sauce simmer for 30 min. but that's mainly because I'm impatient. I love lasagna with cottage cheese, that's how I always had it as a kid and it tastes wrong to me without. Thanks :D

Found this a bit runny and bland. Will go back to using ricotta for lasagna.

Yum! Everyone loved it!  The only thing I changed was to add red pepper flakes to the sauce for some zing and had used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  Don't forget to spice up the ricotta cheese so it has flavor!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe. I just can across it and made this for supper along w/ garlic bread and salad and it was excellent.. Was not hard to make and was so flavorful. I did add a pinch of garlic powder and minced garlic to the cheese mixture for added zest. My husband loved it.

Top notch lasagna recipe.  But I agree with other reviewers that ricotta cheese is a better fit here than cottage cheese.  

Another option is to use Italian sausage instead of the ground beef.  Or, make your own "quick Italian sausage" by browning a 1 lb roll of regular sausage with 1 Tbs of cracked/crushed fennel seeds, then substituting it for the beef in this recipe.  Mmm, good.

Be sure to actually put the cottage cheese mixture into the blender.  The smooth texture is what makes it work!  I'm glad I didn't just go out and buy Ricotta!  The flavor just gets better -- so leftovers are great, too! eta: made this again with Ricotta I'd bought for a different recipe I decided not to make.  I must say... YUM.  I simmered the sauce for probably 1.5hrs (I forgot to start boiling noodles during that first hour!).  The sauce certainly had a better flavor this time.  Really good -- and pretty darn easy recipe.

This is very good Lasagna.  The recipe is a thick lasagna recipe.  I would recommend going easy on the sauce for the 1st and 2nd layer so you make sure you have enough for your top layer.  The flavor is wonderful.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone who is looking for some good lasagna.

I use this recipe ALL the time.  My family loves it, and although it takes a little bit of time to make, it's extremely easy and we always have leftovers for the next day!  The only things I do differently are:  I use Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and I only use about 1/2 of the onion instead of the whole thing.  I'm sure cottage cheese would be great in the recipe, I just have a love for Ricotta!  The first time I made the lasagna, I used the whole onion, and it turned out to be too much, so I simply reduced the amount I was using and it has turned out amazing every time since.  LOVE IT!!!

My husband enjoyed this lasagna very much.  I used an Italian sausage/beef combination and added some extra seasonings (Italian seasoning, Creole seasoning and crushed red pepper flakes).  I included a package of chopped spinach with the cottage cheese mixture.  As recommended by another reviewer, I put the sauce in the crock pot and let it simmer for several hours.

This was awesome! I fed it to my toughest customers, my dad and my husband, and they both agreed it was the best lasagna they had ever had. I did substitute the cottage cheese with ricotta cheese. I used italian seasoned tomato paste and brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also added ground sage to the hamburger, about a teaspoon full. Definately make this one! I will make this again and again.

This was the best lasagna I have ever made.  I did use no boil noodles, which is a lot easier and just as yummy.  I've never heard of using cottage cheese instead of ricotta, but it was delicous, maybe better.  Try it with the cottage cheese, you'll be surprised.

This was VERY GOOD. Soaked the noodle in the baking dish while making the sauce like others suggested, then after assembling lasagna in the same baking dish (to save on the dishes to wash) refrigerated it overnight for the next day.  I did use bigger can of crushed tomato (the whole can), one of tomato paste, and teaspoon full of minced garlic from jar.  I was little worried that it might not have enough liquid, especially since the pasta wasn't pre-cooked, but it turned out so delicious, and PERFECT.  My husband really liked it, and he doesn't even like cottage cheese.  He said he liked this so much better than the other lasagnas I've cooked before. A definite keeper, we'll be having this again. Thank you, Rhonda!

This was great!!  My picky son had 2 large servings.  I must say that I did use the whole 16 oz container of cottage cheese and threw in a couple extra Tbl of Parmesan to compensate.  It was delicious as is but might do 1/2 italian sausage 1/2 ground beef next time for some extra kick!!!  Thanks for sharing.  This is a keeper im my recipe box.

I made this 2 days ago and cannot wait to have the leftovers tonight!  I loved the fact that you made your own sauce.  It was simple and easy.  I did add an extra can of diced tomatoes w/ italian spices to make a bit more sauce, used 1lb ground turkey and 1/2lb ground italian sausage, a mix of 8oz ricotta and 8oz cottage cheese and upped the spices a bit.  I also made every layer the same: sauce, ricotta mix and mozz cheese and repeat.  It worked perfectly with 3 layers of 4 noodles each.  I also baked for 30 minutes covered and then 15 minutes uncovered like other reviewers.  I will be making this again!!

I'm not sure if I should be rating this recipe or submitting what I created based upon this recipe. I gave it 5 stars because I did not try it as is, but what I ended up with was delicious. I DID do the cottage cheese mixture instead of ricotta because it sounded like a yummy idea, but I even changed that a bit by not putting plain parmesan and adding a 4 cheese blend (parmesan, asiago, romano, and provolone) in that.  Also, for the sauce I sauteed a chopped onion, italian parsley (1/2 bunch), salt, pepper, with ground beef and mushrooms, and then added 1 can of tomato paste (6oz, standard), 1 can of tomato sauce (15oz, standard), and 1 can of crushed tomatoes (28oz, standard).Needless to say, my lasagna wasn't dry. OH! and I also added one more layer of noodles because I, too, like some other reviewers, like a taller lasagna. I also realized something... if you layer each noodle with a little overlap, the whole thing sticks together quite nicely in the oven. Definitely try the cheese mixture though, you will not be disappointed!

This was a hit with all  eaters-  I read others reviews and made a bit more sauce, added fresh basil and garlic.  i also doubled the cheese mix and used 12 noodles as it seemed too low-  those who prefer drier lasagna will like it this way, more is absorbed in the noodles- It was not dry, but came out in nice squares, very moist.  I tucked all the noodle edges under the sauce to make sure they didn't get crispy.

I made this for my friends and they were SO impressed (they were making yummy noises as they were eating) I will definitely make this again. Only change was adding a few fresh cloves of gralic and some red pepper flakes to make it a little more spicy :)

absolutely delicious!  every time I make this I get rave reviews.  I use ricotta instead of the cottage cheese (personal preference).  I find that I usually don't have enough of the sauce mixture to place on top which might be my fault so I usually just add some extra canned tomatoes on top.  thanks for the recipe!

Good base recipe. I liked that it uses homemade sauce instead of the jar kind. A little bland for my personal tastes, but overall a decent starter recipe. I didn't have cottage cheese so I used ricotta instead. I didn't precook the pasta, just increased water in sauce by about 1/2 cup. I only used 2 cups (8 oz) mozarella as that's all I had.

I have made this numerous times and each time I do something different. this time I used a pound of ground sweet Italian sausage with the beef (I always double the recipe).It was awesome! I even had someone who hates sausage loving it and wanting more.

ExcelIent! I didn't read the reviews prior to making this recipe. If I had would have made more sauce.  I came up short, so the last layer of sauce was "Prego" Italian sauce.  I'll definitely make
this again.

This was absolutely delicious! I followed the advice of other reviews and I used riccota instead of the cottage cheese. I also used the crushed tomotes with italian seasoning already in it, instead of the regular crushed tomatoes. I made extra tomato sauce simply because when I added the numbers I felt I would be lacking, which I am glad I did. I felt that had I made the original amount I would not of had enough. Plus, I used it on all three layers, besides the one on the bottom. We are cheese freaks, so I added more cheese than the recipe called for.

I made this recipe and it was "the bomb".  My husband almost ate it all by himself!  The only thing different I did was add more meat and chesse (I love cheese).  I was wonderful & delicious.  I've made it twice already!

Great sauce, but a little runny. I may not have simmered it long enough. I will substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese next time for a little more flavor. I also used italian sausage instead of ground beef and that turned out pretty good.

My family decided to have a non-traditional Christmas dinner this year.  So, I chose lasagna and this recipe seemed to be the best I found.  I had two unofficial food critics at the table this year in my older sister and my oldest sister's boyfriend.  I got rave reviews from both of them.  I didn't include the onion and unlike other reviewers, I went ahead and used cottage chesse and not ricotta.  So, you can change the recipe a bit and it will still be good.  I highly recommend this one!

This is amazing!!  One thing I did was cover it with foil while baking for 20 minutes and then uncover and bake until cheese bubbles and gets browned.  This really makes a difference.  But I don't think there's any way you could mess this recipe up.  It was the best lasagna I have ever had!

Great lasagna! I also substituted the cottage cheese for ricotta and it turned out beautifully. Everyone at my dinner party gobbled it up and thought it was delish! Make sure you let the sauce simmer for the full hour to maximize flavor!

This was an excellent lasagna.  We used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, since my friend is a lasagna purist.  And turkey instead of beef.  We used more garlic and spices too.  The end result was awesome though.

I made this for dinner tonight, and my fiance and I gobbled it right up... we still have left overs of course!   I cannot imagine anyone rating this recipe anything less than a 5, it is absolutely the best lasagna ever!!!  Well this is my first attempt at making lasagna, but I have tried many different varieties of lasagna!  This is the best yet!  This one is definitely a keeper!!!  Thank you for the recipe!

fantastic - I added some fresh basil to the sauce, used fresh garlic, and substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese. I also used some italian sausage for the meat since I had it on hand. Tasted great.

Very good lasagna. I liked using beef instead of ground pork sausage. It made alot for just three people, so I was able to freeze the remaining two-thirds into two future dinners. I used the basil/olive oil flavored 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, and I added a couple of teaspons of dried basil. I also used fresh minced garlic (two). Instead of three strips of lasagna noodles for each layer, I used four. And, I substituted Ricotta for the cottage cheese. Putting the mozzarella on top during the last 15 minutes of cooking was perfect! Thanks for a great family recipe!

Very delicious Lasagna.  I made this for company and his favorite thing was lasagna and he said mine was the best.  It turned out perfect.  I used stewed tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes and I just pureed them in the blender.  I also used half cottage cheese and have ricotta cheese.

This lasagna turned out pretty well. I used no boil lasagna noodles to cut down on preparation time. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Next time I don't think I will let the sauce simmer for a whole hour (maybe only 30 mins) because it seemed like it got a little too thick. But, I was satisfied, and think I will try this one again! (Be prepared for lots of dirty dishes!)

Absolutely delicious!!! This was my first time making lasagna and my husband just loved it!! The sauce was great- the only thing altered was that ricotta cheese was used in place of the cottage cheese! Will definitely make again! =)

My family & I really liked this recipe.  The only changes I made was to substitute italian seasoning for the other seasonings.  Also, my lasagna did not take quite as long to bake as the recipe stated but then again I have a super oven!

Best lasagna recipe I've ever used.  Very easy and my family said it was the best I had ever made.  The only thing I did different was to use an Italian blend of shredded cheese on the top.  This is definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good, since I lost my lasagna recipe years ago, this has a lot of potential.  First off we don't like riccota cheese which this does not use. I did cut back on the salt and used about 1/2 tsp. of basil and about 1/2 tsp. of thyme. Family liked it, but still not the recipe I'm looking for.  Thanks for the post, I'll keep tweaking to our liking.

This was a really good basic recipe. I don't like a lot of vegetables in my lasagna so I really enjoyed it, however if I made it for company I might add some chopped spinach to the cottage cheese mixture. I didn't have any tomato paste so just used the crushed tomatoes and only added 1/2 cup of water. I also didn't add the sugar because I didn't find it necessary. I can't imagine it being any better but I can't wait to try it the next time as the recipe is written.

I just made this today and it was okay.  I added a few spices (basil, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes).  If I were to make it again, I may add sausage.

Awesome Lasagna. The sauce was awesome, I think I'll make it again and use it on stuffed shells. I used 1/2 lb sweet Italian sausage and 1/2 lb hot sausage and simmered it for 2 hrs and didn't add sugar. The acidity mellows the longer you smimmer it and I had to add 1/2 cup more water after an hour.

I followed the directions exactly, and so far this is the best homemade lasagna recipe I have found! My Husband loved it, but we both think it needs a little more sauce.

I enjoyed this lasagna, but I guess I prefer one made with sausage and more spices in the sauce.  I also thought there was too much sauce and not enough cheese, but that's just me! :)  Thanks!

I would recommend the following changes to make this taste EVEN BETTER (because it’s awesome as is but is strikingly similar to Stouffer’s... in which case you should just get Stouffer’s and save yourself an hour of work)... 1) Sub cottage cheese for 15oz whole milk Ricotta; 1) add a little extra of all seasonings except the salt; 3) add in some Thyme and Rosemary for more depth of flavor (I just sprinkled it into the sauce until it “looked right”)

I’ve made this basic same recipe and it was my grandma’s preference. I used cottage cheese because we forgot ricotta (which I like that taste) however if you blend it, as in a food processor, with the egg and cheese, it’s creamy and ricotta texture. So I’m not sure if the other reviewers actually blended it in this manner. Delicious ! 
I add parsley to my cheese/egg mixture.

Okay. Yummy. I was hesitant about the recipe due to everyone changing it back to ricotta. I kept to the original recipe and absolutely LOVE that the tang from the cottage cheese, which I don’t eat normally, was smoother than ricotta. I will be making this again! Thanks!

This was really easy to make and completely delicious!  I tweaked the recipe a bit and used asiago instead of parmesan, added mushrooms and sauteed, diced, red pepper to the sauce, and used "very smooth," ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and it turned out PERFECT.  It seemed a little too saucy when I was putting it in the baking dish, but after baking at 350 for 30 minutes, I left it to set for about 10 minutes and it held perfectly when I dished it out.
THANKS LINDA!

It was ok. I thought there was too much tomato paste and the cottage cheese seemed like it just melted and got lost. For the amount of dirty dishes and lack of "wow" factor when I ate it, I won't make this version of lasagna again. It wasn't bad, just not "wow". If I am not wowed, then I don't make it again. Followed recipe as written.

This was the best! My hubby went back for seconds and that rarely happens when I cook lol. I changed a few things, I used the ready to bake noodles and did spices instead of whole items, i.e. garlic powder basil paste etc. it was super easy and really yummy!

This turned out pretty good. I like the flavor but I think I need to cover it when simmering. Lost too much water and didn't really have enough sauce. I think I'll try adding a ghost pepper next time to add some heat!

I made it per the recipe with two changes: I added three crushed garlic cloves (because more is better with regard to garlic) and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Delish!!! Absolutely will be my go-to.

The 1st time, It was good but cottage cheese makes it very watery.  The 2nd time I made it, I used Ricotta cheese, fresh rosemary, basil, oregano, and Italian Seasoning.  It was AWESOME! You're welcome everyone!

Excellent recipe. I put the cottage cheese, Parmesan, and egg in the blender and it blended to a nice creamy consistency but what we liked the best was the way it baked. I had two egg whites leftover from something else so I threw them in. Made for a nice almost fluffy texture. We are also fennel fans in our house so I chopped up real fennel to cook with the onions and threw fennel seeds in with the tomato mixture. Used regular lasagna noodles, boiled to al dente, they baked perfectly. This is a keeper.

This was perfect!  I love the smoothness of the cottage cheese.  I’ve always used ricotta and. Never really liked the consistency.  Made with no boil noodles. Super good.

Excellent!  I had company coming over who requested lasagna with cottage cheese inside and my MIL’s recipe was ho-hum.  I found this one and my whole family loved it so much that my husband asked me to keep the recipe!  I did add a tablespoon of minced garlic to the meat sauce and sprinkled shredded Parmesan on top of the mozzarella.

This was excellent!  Made it as written except used no boil noodles.  Will definitely make it again except will try with less salt.  I thought it was salty and I normally have to add extra salt to everything.  Thanks for the recipe!  This one’s a keeper!

Used no-bake noodles and added an extra cup of water to the sauce. Also kept the sauce overnight before making up the lasagna - my mother's trick to develop the flavours. Great recipe - will make it again!

This is excellent.  So delicious.  I have made this several times. 
As I am a vegetarian, I did have to use a vegetarian ground round (Yves) instead of the beef.  I reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon.  Absolute favorite.

I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and oven-ready noodles (no boiling required).  I should have paid more attention to how many servings the recipe makes.  Too much for a family of three, even with our love of leftover pasta dishes.  Great dish!  I will make again, halved.  :-)

I followed the offered advice and switched cottage cheese with ricotta.  I also used the pre-cooked Barilla lasagna noodles.  *Note to those who are grain free now-there are grain free lasagna noodles made by Cappello's.  They make grain free pizza crusts as well.  Also, I used Montreal Steak spice to the mixture of grass feed beef & buffalo meat, cumin and a copious amount of Herbs de Provence.  I used an excellent Cabarnet Sauvignon instead of water.  And lastly, I also used organic raw sugar while it simmered for an hour.  Don't Skimp On The One Hour Simmer Time!  Regrettable if one does...and a pity to waste all the effort to save a few minutes that are well worth the end result!

Took other's suggestions to add Italian spices and 1/4 cup white wine.  Also added minced garlic while cooking ground beef and onions; Mrs. Dash Garlic blend and Vegeta for more seasoning.

Made huge pan. Very very good!

Great recipe! I didn't change a thing.  I made it for a friend who had just come home from the hospital and she asked if I would make it again for her husband's birthday since she was having chemo and couldn't do it.  He loved it both times!

Five stars by far. I ran out of time so I used our favorite go-to marinara in a jar. I browned the meat - set aside. sautéed onions and fresh garlic and added the meat. Once all was well combined I added the jar of marinara and a whole can of crushed tomatoes (14.5oz). I added a dash of sugar and salted to taste. simmered while pasta was boiling and then was done. the cooking time was considerably less but the taste was still amazing. Also, I went with the ricotta because it's delicious but it's a matter of preference. 
Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Overall, I really like this lasagna. The only change I made was I used a large can of crushed tomatoes and 1 cup of water. I only did this because I bought the wrong size can of tomatoes. The oregano was strong, so the next time I make it, I will probably use half the amount of oregano and add some dried basil.

The layering in this recipe really helps it stay together better. I've made this subbing in my own homemade pasta sauce and it comes out perfect. Will make this again!

I have used this recipe for several years and this is the best. Dont try to alter it by adding more spices like Monica did  and ruined a good thing. 
Thank-you for the best tasting lasagna I've ever eaten.

Very tasty, I'll absolutely do this again. I used a 4% large curd cottage cheese and substituted sweet Italian sausage for the ground beef. Held up very well coming out of the pan with no runny juices which can happen with some recipes. I'll probably dial back the milkfat to 2% cottage cheese next time (probably not readily available in large curd but it shouldn't make any difference).

Perfection! Moist and juicy. The diced or crushed tomatoes give this recipe a great texture. The only change I made was to sauté a thinly sliced clove of garlic along with the onions and added 1tsp of basil to the sauce. Delicious! I will make this again and again. My family LOVED IT!

This lasagna was great! I had no problems with the original recipe - cottage cheese and all. I did add some cheddar to the top layer of cheese for colour and flavour. And if you make way more of it than you need like I did, it actually tastes as good or better the next day!

Very good recipe. Although like others, I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. It gives it a more rich creamy texture. Also, Sautee a clove of garlic with the onion. Added 50% of season suggested, little fresh parsley and 2 tbls of cream to cheese mixture. Tasted awesome!!! ... Little hint, don't over boil your pasta. Boil it only for about 5 -6 minutes  max.  Start with 3 wait about 2 minutes, add  another three and wait 2 minutes for the remaining .  Your last ones to put in should be your first row,  second layer  and last one should be your first layer. on top.

Made crushed tomatoes and tomato paste from scratch, bought mozz balls, used dry fresh cottage cheese. This turned out extremely well. I don't know why the other reviewer complained. Perhaps her high quality ingredients were just too commercially bland, as this was a terrific recipe.

Please tell your mother that her lasagna recipe is excellent. I only made two minor changes. #1 I used sausage instead of ground beef, because it's what I had available.  #2 I used a full 16 oz container of cottage cheese (your recipe doesn't specify, but I used small curd) because I was feeling too lazy to measure out 12 oz. HAHA! :D I was a little concerned that the sauce might end up being too sweet, but it was perfect. I definitely recommend using the cottage cheese. I've used both cottage cheese and ricotta. I like both. There is nothing wrong with either option, and cottage cheese is cheaper, so is great when money is tight. I also, in no way, thought this tasted like Stouffers. Only other change I'll make in the future is to add mushrooms to the sauce.

Great for a large family gathering. Used Barilla no-bake lasagna noodles. Made four 9x13 pans, with one pan being vegetarian.  For the vegetarian, I added frozen (thawed) spinach to the sauce, as well as a bag of frozen (thawed) red, green, yellow pepper/onion mix.  The vegetarian sauce was great!

I add a bit more sugar to the sauce than the recipe calls for because we prefer a slightly sweeter sauce than this recipe creates.

Delicious.

I accidentally purchased a chive flavored cottage cheese. I noticed the flavor in the lasagna and loved it. Will intentionally use that variety next time.

Overall the recipe is great.

Best lasagna I've ever made! All ingredients I keep on hand and amazing!! I don't like using the pre made jarred sauce varieties in lasagna...and why would you if you can just use this recipe?! My kids and I ate the leftovers every day till it was gone...and lots of moaning and groaning when it was! Only things different were because of what I had on hand and a mistake: accidentally left off top layer of noodles and subbed partial mild cheddar for cheese. Still great. My new go to recipe.

I have served this lasagna many times and everyone wants the recipe.  I also use the sauce when I make stuffed shells, spaghetti or anything that I need a sauce for. Thank you Linda - best recipe for lasagna I have ever tried.

This is a fantastic recipe! Even my picky step son ate it.....(Of course I didn't tell him about the cottage cheese). I did make a few very small changes and I'm not sure they really altered the flavor at all......I added 1 tsp Basil and 1 Bay Leaf to the sauce and I used a hand mixer to blend the cottage cheese portion to make it smooth.....Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe!

I haven't tried it yet but to other first time lasagna makers out there. The initial one cup that they tell you is really just one cup. I thought it looked too scarce so I piled on the sauce and didn't have any for the top then realized that lasagna isn't supposed to have a lot of sauce at the bottom

This is a great recipe!  I did it slightly differently. I browned a pound of sweet Italian sausage and instead of crushed tomatoes, I used a 28 oz can of stewed tomatoes and a little less water. The stewed tomatoes have a bright fresh flavor. I mashed up the big chunks but some bites still have a chunk of tomato but I like that.

This recipe is my current go-to recipe for making lasagna.  I’ve made it both ways, with cottage cheese and with ricotta cheese and both versions are great.  To keep with having an accurate review, the review is for the cottage cheese version.  Don’t be afraid of using it; it is delicious.  I took the instructions literally and blended the cottage cheese, egg and Parmesan mixture in a personal-sized blender. I think this gets rid of the lumpiness that other reviews are worried about / experienced.  Once you blend it, the texture is reminiscent of ricotta cheese, which may be the grand secret of the recipe.  The only change that I made, because I was lazy and I didn’t think it changed the integrity of the recipe, is that I used oven-ready lasagna.  If you are looking to save a little time by not having to boil the noodles first, I suggest you do it too.  The recipe is also on the cheesy side so you can cut back on the amount of mozzarella if you think it is getting a bit much. However, the amount of cheese worked for me.

This is great! Used cottage cheese but  threw it in the food processor to get the lumps out and mix with the parmesan and added some fresh parsley.  Also used thin slices of zucchini in place of the noodles.  In the future I may sub in jar sauce to make it faster.

It was pretty good.  Next time I will try adding some spinach and/or zucchini.  Like any lasagne, it needs to sit for a while before cutting.  Good the next day.  The cottage cheese mixture works well as a single layer as the recipe directs.

I really liked this recipe, but I did make a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I browned the ground beef with the onion, because why not? One less pan and the beef gets the onion flavor. I also used 3 - 6 oz cans of plain tomato sauce in place of the tomato paste and omitted the water. I didn't have any plain oregano so I used 1 tbsp of Italian seasoning in its place. Even with the changes, I think it turned out great. I don't like ricotta because of the grainy texture, so I liked being able to use cottage cheese. I put the cottage cheese, Parmesan and egg into my Ninja and pulsed it a few times to get a smoother texture, which helped it integrate just like ricotta would.  The husband already wants me to make this again and he is very picky!

Added fresh mushrooms, garlic and crushed red pepper to the sauce. Also subbed ricotta for the cottage cheese because that's what I had on hand.  Came out amazing, will be using this recipe again and again!!

I make it again, and again and again!  We really enjoy this recipe over any other I've tried.  I always make two pans (so double the recipe) and I skip the sugar.  I also place the cottage cheese, egg(s), and parmesan in a food processor and blend until smooth.  (The kids would be put off by curds).  A nice meal that kids and adults love.

This is great! I was looking for a classic lasagna recipe, and this is it. And it's so easy to adapt for veggie lasagna, just substituted a pound of veggies for the pound of meat. I even upped it to a pound and a half since the veggies cooked down so much. And I didn't add the two cups of water since there was water from the veggies and I have happy with the sauce's consistency. I used two cups of sauce for each layer. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and I add parsley to the ricotta since that's what I remember our family always doing. And I think next time I will use a pound and half of mozzarella. I came up a little short with only a pound. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was good, but I used Italian sausage instead of beef and it was way too flavorful. Next time I make it I'm probably going to stop use Italian sausage but not add the spices, since Italian sausage is already seasoned. My husband loved it though!

Hope it's OK to rate since I used Hunts sauce instead of using the scratch ingredients. All else was as directed. Turned out great, husband and I like it with cottage cheese, ricotta makes it taste like frozen store-bought (JMHO).

I made this last night and it was a hit with everyone in my family! My 10 year old daughter who started out eating the noodles only ended up eating every bite! I didn't change anything only added a package of frozen thawed spinach to sneak in some veggies. I doubled this and put one in the freezer.

NEVER HAD COTTAGE CHEESE TIL TODAY!!! Use cottage cheese you will be surprise how good it taste. I hate ricotta but I'm glad I gave this a try. As for the meat sauce I just did my own thing. I added button mushrooms.

I've made this lasagna several times, and it's my husband's favorite! It's good as written, but it's even better if you add 1 T fresh basil and a bay leaf to the sauce (remove bay leaf before serving). It's fine to place a cocked lid over the sauce while simmering to reduce the mess.

I made this recipe. Following exactly what is listed. But I froze it and then warmed it up later. I love this lasagna. This is the third recipe I tried. I can stop looking absolutely delish!

Delicious recipe. Worth the time and money. Cost me about $20 and 3 hours to prepare and cook. Things I changed: added fresh, chopped basil to each layer. Mixed mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and six cheese Italian cheese in between layers. The whole fish was devoured! So yum! I used the cottage cheese as the recipe stated and everyone thought it was ricotta.

First off thank you for taking the time to post your recipe. Every now and then we like to try new lasagna recipes we find on here and although this was a hit with our friends, it did not fit our taste pallets. I have made this recipe twice the first time was exact and the second time I substituted the garlic powder, crushed tomatoes, and dried oregano for fresh ingredients and added some fresh basil. In the end we felt the addition of the fresh ingredients helped the dish become a bit more to our liking, but all in all I am happy e came across this recipe.

This is the only recipe I ever use for lasagna, and my family likes it even better than the lasagna from Olive Garden or our local Italian restaurant.  I only make a couple of minor changes - I use Ricotta instead of Cottage Cheese, and I add about a half pound of Italian sausage in with the ground beef. I cook the onions in with the meat. Once I get that started, I go ahead and heat the other ingredients for the sauce, then add the meat and onions as soon as they are done.  I usually make a double batch of the sauce, and freeze the other half to use later as spaghetti sauce, or for a quick batch of lasagna.  I have used regular lasagna noodles as well as oven-ready noodles, and my family couldn't decide which they like better. That made the decision easy for me - oven ready is SO much easier!  Sometimes I make this the night before (steps 1-5) and bake it just in time to eat. I think it is even more flavorful that way.  If I am taking this dish somehere like my mom's house, I will bake it for 30 minutes before I leave home, then, after I get there, I will sprinke the remaining mozzarella cheese on top and bake the final 15 minutes. That works great too!

Made this for my father-in-law's bday last night and it was delicious! Made double the recipe for a total of 11 adults and 2 kids, only had about 5 pieces left over (cut each lasagna into 15 servings). Definitely making this again!!

I made this and shared some of the leftovers and everyone loves it! I, of course, have modified it and made it my own, but the structure of this recipe is very sound. For those that say that is taste like a Stouffer's lasagna may need to do as I did and choose some different cheeses and/or change up the sauce. I am making two of these for Sunday dinner at my grandmother's tomorrow, (the entire family traditionally gathers there every Sunday) and I am confident that it will be just as delicious to everyone else. Thanks Linda for the recipe and thanks Linda's daughter for sharing it!

I don’t know why I waited so long to review this. His lasagna is INCREDIBLE!!!!  Sooooooooo good!  I make it as written, but sort of “heap” the spices. I also have trouble finding a small can of the tomatoes, so I use most of a big can, as well as no-boil noodles. Although this is easy to make, it’s sort of a special occasion meal in my house. My boyfriend flips for it :). I always feel proud when I make this one, and don’t think I’ll ever change it up!  MAKE IT.

I really liked this lasagna. I used steamed zucchini in place of the noodles, and it was so good! The whole family enjoyed it. Simple and flavorful: a definite save.

I made this exactly as written, except with fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  My family really enjoyed it.  I really don't understand the strong insistence upon ricotta that some have stated.  If you blend the cottage cheese, parmesan and egg until smooth (I used my food processor) it's difficult to tell the difference.  I've used both and enjoyed both, very similar.

This recipe was delicious! We swapped the beef for Italian sausage which adds a little more flavor. We also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and it turned out excellent!

I have made this recipe numerous times and everyone loves it. I use 'oven ready' noodles so I add some extra water to the sauce. I have used this sauce for meatballs too - great. I have also added ricotta cheese on occasion along with the cottage cheese.

My favorite lasagna. I use Italian sausage instead of hamburger and use Italian style tomatoes instead of plain, always so yummy! I always purée the cottage cheese, egg, and Parmesan until it's really smooth. So good! It's in the oven right now. :)

I made this on Sunday, it was my daughter's request for dinner. The only change I  made was to use 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese. I made two pans and she took one home, the leftovers I had were gone on day two! Very Good!!!

I have been making this lasagna for a few years now and it is, by far, the BEST lasagna recipe I've ever made!  I have never altered a single ingredient or step and LOVE how it turns out.  I, too, use a mixer when mixing the cottage cheese, egg, and Parmesan until it's very smooth.  Again, every time I've made this it's raved about...so glad I found it!

Made this several times over the last few years. I use ground turkey and have tried ricotta and cottage cheese. Both are great, but I prefer the recipe as is. Have always received rave reviews from everyone who tries it, and never seem to have any leftover.

When the whole table is making yummy sounds, everyone goes back for seconds and my 10yr old asks for it for lunch the next day. It's five star in my book. I used whole wheat noodles, followed everything else exactly. B4 this I was apprehensive about attempting lasagna. No more. Yum!  I'm sure making authentic with fresh herbs and ricotta ect would be awesome too but this is a winner.

As many before me, I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, and used no boil lasagna. Pretty good recipe, but the sauce was too sweet - I'll be tasting the sauce before adding sugar next time.

Awesome lasagna. I used the cottage cheese and loved how it turned out. I did make the sauce the night before so the flavors could blend. I made this for my family and to take to two other families. I got raves from all of them. I will definitely be making this one again. Thank you!

Awesome recipe! Made it exactly as stated, came out perfect! Great taste, great aroma, good texture, perfect cheesy-ness! I don't miss the ricotta cheese at all. Might try it with some italian sausage next time. Thumbs up from me and my friends.

This lasagne is wonderful.  I used my own canned tomato juice instead of store bought crushed tomatoes, so I dont use any extra water.  I also stir in 2 envelopes of spaghetti mix with the tomatoes to thicken it up and add some extra falvor.  I also double the meat and sauce amount.

Too bad I can only give this recipe 5 stars. :( I followed the recipe and used small curd cottage cheese, then used my mixer whip to "de-curd" it for a bit smoother texture. I also used tomatoes and paste with garlic, oregano and basil and added minced garlic to the meat while it was browning. This will be my "go to" lasagna recipe from now on. Thank you for sharing your Mother's awesome recipe, RBLAIR!!

It was very good. I took the advice from others and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Next time I'll make it with regular jar of pasta sauce to cut back the time.

Love this recipe. I do agree with everyone and suggest adding more seasoning to the sauce. I didn't and it did taste a little plain. Maybe some mushrooms would liven it up. I assembled the lasagna the night before and cooked it the next day. I think it really let the flavors gel together and seemed like less work. I will make this again for sure!

Best recipe for lasagna out there. Be sure to simmer the sauce for the full hour, it makes a difference. Also, add spices to your taste as with any recipe. I spice it up with a little crushed red pepper, basil, and red wine.

This turned out great! I adjusted the recipe to make more sauce since I had bought 1.5 lbs of ground turkey (yes, I made it with turkey).  I also made this with homemade lasagna noodles.  Since I made extra sauce, I had enough to make a 9x13 and a 9x9.  I used Knudsen cottage cheese because it is generally creamier than other brands and I thought it tasted really great in the lasagna.  I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

This was delicious! I used seasoned tomatoe paste, for more flavor (italian), and also seasoned tomatoes, and in addition included the seasonings specified in the recipe. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, only because I didn't have cottage cheese. I doubled the mozzarella cheese, just because I LOVE mozzarella! Added extra water to the sauce, and I'm really glad I did because the noodles soaked it up, and if I hadn't it would have been a little dry. My husband took leftovers to work for his lunch, and still wanted more when he got home for dinner!! Yummy! Thank you, Linda, this one's a keeper!

I like this recipe because it is a great starter point for a good lasagna.  I found that with the addition of sliced and cooked mushrooms, and chopped spinach with the cottage cheese mix, it bumped this up to the next level.  Good recipe!

This was very good, but the DH and I prefer 'Bob's lasagna' This had almost a too cheesy taste.

In all fairness, I am giving this rating for a concept, alone because I did change some things. My rating is based on the use of the cottage cheese in the recipe. Let me just say yum!

delicious, easy recipe!  I have made this several times now and tried it with ricotta and cottage cheese.  I prefer it with cottage cheese.  Small curd, kind of mashed a little first.

This is the best lasagne recipe I've come across so far.  The cottage cheese is key!  I used low fat/2% everything and it still tasted rich.  The cottage cheese gave it a real fresh and cheesy flavor.

This is a good basic lasagna recipe. It tasted fine but seemed to missing something. Maybe some more vegetables or cheese would have done the trick.

I loved this lasagna. It was easy to make, but man, it a long time (as one should expect).   Changes: I used half the salt and would make more sauce next time as we ran out before the last layers of noodle was placed. Also, 3 noodles do not fit into a 9 x 13 pan, which was annoying, so we did 4 plus one along the top (which had to be trimmed to fit).  Delicious and highly recommended! My partner even said it was "more than half" as good as his mom's, which is a HUGE feat.

This was a good recipe for lasagna. But also not wow. Pretty standard, and good for a beginner. Spinach or something to jazz it up is always nice.

This recipe was soupy, it probably would have been better and stayed together more if there was another layer of the cheese mixture.

This was excellent. The only change I made was to use whole milk ricotta cheese. It is a labor of love, but my husband had been dying for homemade lasagna and this fit the bill!

This lasagna is good. I tried it and switched a couple of things. I mean afterall everyone has their own cooking methods and style. However it was a basic recipe for me to go by in trying my first lasagna. I think the sauce is a bit basic as well, I do agree that those are the main ingrediants but with a little more humph of your own flavor makes it GREAT!! Thanks Linda.

Wonderful lasagna recipe.. I find though that its a little bit short on the cottage cheese mixture? not sure.. but all in all, it tasted great! The 2nd time I made it, I sweetened the sauce a bit by reducing the tomato sauce and using Filipino-style spaghetti sauce which is sweeter.. turned out great!

Excellent recipe!  I used ricotta cheese instead of cream cheese and followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it was magnificent!  I'll probably simmer the sauce in the crock pot for couple hours next time.

I did change this recipe slightly to accommodate for my husband's tastes. He likes a lasagna with MEAT :)! I used 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of turkey sausage. I browned them in two different pans in order to really brown the meat and not just cook it. I added the onion and some minced garlic to the sausage and cooked it til soft. When I made the sauce, I upped the crushed tomatoes to 29 oz. and only used one cup of water. I did as another reviewer suggested and pureed the cottage cheese, egg, and parmesan cheese in the blender. I added a little fresh parsley to that and refrigerated until layering the lasagna. The "cheeses" firmed up nicely. Followed the recipe for layering but added about 1/2 cup parmigiana reggiano cheese to the top. Made this in two square pans, and froze one before baking. Husband declared this his new favorite. I used to make Ina Garten's recipe, but this is one is really that good! (and cheaper to make)

I just made this recipe for an "in-home" date night, it was amazing! I did use ricotta cheese instead and no-boil noodles. I wish there had been a little more sauce but thats easy to remedy. Overall a great and fairly easy lasagna recipe, in fact...I'm making another one right now!

Oh my!  This was soooo good.  I've never made lasagna but the recipe was easy to follow and it turned out great!  I did add crushed garlic to the meat and onion but that was the only change.  It's going right in my recipe box and I can't wait to make it for guests!

Made it for the first time last night for a dinner party. Added a layer of spinach on top of the sauce, and used fresh mozarella for the top layer instead of shredded. Turned out fabulous!Will definitely replace my old lasagna recipe with this one.

Not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  The boyfriend loved it.  I made it exactly as stated (except no oregano).  I used twice the amount of crushed tomatoes though, simple because after the sauce simmered down it was just a meat/tomato paste and needed A LOT of moisture to make it spread over the noodles.

"The best lasagna you ever made", said my husband.  We love this recipe since the sauce is not very sweet.  Only thing I changed was to use 1.5 lbs of ground beef.

This is my staple lasagna recipe.  The cottage cheese is what makes it so good, so don't follow other reviews and change to ricotta.  I have never had a negative comment about it.  Great job Linda!

This lasagna recipe turned out great for my first time. It was a little salty for me so I would suggest to those who are watching their salt intake to use the "No Salt Added" tomato paste and control the amount of salt you add in from there.

This is a really great recipe! All of my children love it. I didn't have to change a thing. It takes a while to fix. I have to plan ahead if I want to make it, I can't wait til the last minute to whip this up. It is worth it though. You can use the sauce for noodles or other italian recipes.

Overall it was a delicious lasagna recipe. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I found the recipe ended up making a little too much sauce for our taste. Next time, I will just adjust it slightly so that we get a little less sauce. Other than that, it was absolutely delicious!

FABULOUS!  Next time I will reserve more sauce for the top, the edges of my noodles got a little dry when it was time for reheating in the microwave.  Everyone loved it!

This was a great recipe.  I used the cottage cheese, and it was really wonderful...  please at least try it this way before you substitue.  I made extra sauce, and it didn't need it, made it harder to cut nicely, so be careful about making extra sauce.  I did add some grated zucchini and yellow peppers diced very small into the sauce (sauted with the onions) to get some extra veggies in the for the kids and nobody noticed.  Overall, got rave reviews from kids and adults alike at our house!  Will definately make this again. Thanks Linda!

This Lasangna was a hit for my family dinner.  I changed it up some by sauteing red, yellow & green peppers. I used Turkey Italian Sausage, ground beef and Italian Seasoning and mushrooms.  The top layer of the Lasagna, I added Cheddar cheese and the Mozzarella Cheese.  My kids didn't like it as much as the adults; but overal it was um, um, good!  I will definitely try it again.

This was a really good recipe.  I added a couple of things to it though--I added some bell peppers and mushrooms to the sauce.  It really added to the flavor and added more textures.  I may add some carrots next time as I remember my mom doing it in her lasagna.  I also may double the cottage cheese portion too as I ran out of it at the top of the layer. Oh I also added a bit of sour cream too which rounded everything out.

Great recipe, and very easy. I used beef breakfast sausage instead of ground beef (because that's all I had). The only problem with the result was my own fault; my toddler dumped out my garlic powder and I only had garlic salt, so I used that, but it was too much salt. Ooops. Still delightful, in spite of my judgment error. I also added chopped spinach to the sauce mixture, which was wonderful. Can't wait to try the recipe again with the right amount of spices!

A delicious Lasagna, I too was skeptical of the cottage cheese but I stuck with it and it was delicious. The curds melt while cooking provided you mix the cheese and egg together with it properly and it makes a delicious sauce.

This recipe is great just as it is.  However, to bulk it up a little I added ground italian turkey sausage to the sauce and thawed/drained frozen spinach to the cottage cheese blend.  Definately a keeper.  Will remake soon!

This is truley a keeper. The sauce is so versatile. Do add in red wine, not white for a full flavor sauce. I use this sauce for everything Italian, forget the jar! It makes so much you can freeze it for future, easy to prepare meals!

My husband and I didn't dislike this lasagna, though we both would have liked it a little more "tomatoey".  I didn't have any parmesan cheese so I added a little sour cream to make up the space, and I didn't find it made it too soupy like I was worried it might.  I made sure to beat the cottage cheese with a mixer real well and it turned out great.  I also added a diced green pepper and an 8 oz. can of mushrooms, which were a nice addition.

I thought this recipe was awesome.  We had it for New Years Day and my kids and husband all loved it.  It was gone by the end of the day.  I did not have all of the ingredients to make my own sause, so I used Ragu and added some of the spices to it (and the onion) and it turned out really good.  Will definitely have again.

Really good, I followed the recipe except that I cooked the onion with the ground beef (less dishes) and I added fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I used cottage cheese like the recipe called for and I mixed it with the parmesean and egg with an emersion blender.  It took away any chunkyness associated with the cottage cheese.  Really good.  A hit with my husband!

This recipe was fantastic! I made a double batch - one 9x13 pan and two 9x9 pans. Froze one of the 9x9's and it was fantastic out of the freezer too. The other two were in the refrigerator the night before and cooked up perfectly.

I used the cottage cheese, per other reviews. The sauce in this is the best ever. And the different way of layering the ingredients makes for a nice lasagna. 

This was the first time I made a simple dish - and received SO many compliments.

This lasagna was really good. I liked the cottage cheese way better than the ricotta and it didnt even taste like cottage cheese, no one knew the difference. The only thing that i would mention is that i think it needed more sauce. so next time i will make more sauce, other that that fantastic! and im still giving it five starts because i couldnt stop eating and thinking about it.

I love this. I used ricotta cheese. It was so good. The ony thing i change would be not cooking the full time they said. The cheese was little crispy. I added tasbco sauce and chili pepper.

I agree, keep the cottage cheese! I make a lasagna very close to this with the addition of some vegetables and a few minor changes. I find using the dry curd cottage cheese blended a bit and mixed with an egg is great. (reduces the "sloppiness" sometimes assosiated with using cottage cheese) Beats the heck out of the nasty texture and bland taste of ricotta.

GREAT recipe. I fixed it for the first time with family in town but felt confident enough after reading the reviews to 'try it out' on our guests. Almost everyone had seconds and one person had thirds! 
I added more crushed tomatoes and cottage cheese than were called for because my grocery store didn't carry the exact sizes called for in the recipe, but it just gave the dish a heartier sauce, which I prefer anyway!

This was a big hit.  I improvised by adding some turkey italian sausage.  The lowfat cottage cheese & grated parm blend was excellent.

I love this lasagna! I use a mix of ricotta and cottage cheese and probably more cheese than the recipe calls for.  My boyfriend ate thirds! I made the sauce the night before to save time and to make it taste better. Yum.

Completely amazing! It was the first time in preparing lasagna. And my two friends loved it! I used cottage cheese and it came out just fine. I did take the advice of putting red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning. Mmm, definitely making this again.

I was looking for a lasagna recipe this morning and how could I pass this up with such great reviews? I was a little anxious becuse of the homemade sauce but it was definitely worth it! This is the best! The only change I made was to add a can of sliced mushrooms. The flavor was wonderful. My family really enjoyed this. I can't wait to have the leftovers!

this was great! my husband and i have tried several different lasagna recipes and this is our favorite thus far. it was not dry or too meaty or anything. 

i despise cottage cheese, so the only change we made was using ricotta instead.

we will make this again.

This lasagna was amazing.  My husband asked for extras. The only thing that I did wrong, was that I didn't have time to simmer for an hour.  My sauce was a bit runny.  But, the flavor was there, and I am sure that it will taste amazing tomorrow as well.

This was good but I think I expected more with the reviews it got. It was a good meal but probably will not make it again.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe! This was my first attempt at making lasagna and I was so so pleased with the outcome of this lasagna. SO SO easy! I used 500g chicken mince, 375g jar tomato paste, 800g diced tomatoes, subbed minced garlic for the fresh garlic, added some chopped zucchini and lastly I subbed 250g light ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese and this was DELICIOUS! I baked it at 155 degrees for the stated time and it was Perfect when I pulled it out of the oven! My husband and I loved it. It smelled wonderful cooking and well it tasted just as good. Definately a KEEPER recipe for me! Can't wait to have our leftovers today and I am sure the kids will love it. THANKS for the great recipe!

Oooh my goodness, I usually prefer a spicy Italian sausage lasagna, but this one competes! It was so delicious I ate more than I should have. I also used ricotta cheese like other reviewers, and I added mushrooms and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also added extra Parmesan...let's face it, there's no such thing as too much cheese.

This was very good. My husband loves cheese and this was very cheesy. I did substitute the cottage cheese for the ricotta. I think next time I will try half ground meat and half italian sausage to add some spice. And I also made the sauce the night before and let the sauce sit in the fridge overnight. Sauce always tastes better that way.

This is the first recipe I got from allrecipes.com and made it for my friends.  Whenever we feel like Italian, they all beg me to make "my" lasagna.  Fantastic recipe.

I love lasagna! I personally don't think this is that great of a recipe but my boyfriend and friends loved it! I followed the recipe exactly except I used ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese. What I would have done differetly would be to layer the lasagna with a layer of cheese mixture everytime. It just wasn't 'cheesy' enough.

This was a good, basic recipe, but not really anything special. I switched out the cottage cheese for ricotta, as recommended by several reviewers. Also, I seasoned the ground beef before adding it to the sauce - without that, it would have been fairly bland. Overall, good recipe, but I'll be trying something different next time.

Was ok - but not for those who don't care much for the overpowering flavor of Oregano.  Texture was good but there was no balance in flavor.  My husband felt the exact same way about this dish.

Everyone loved this one except me.  I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed w/ the lack of flavor.  If I make this again, I'll use ricotta instead of cottage cheese.

I made this for my bf and two of his friends, one of which is a great cook, and they loved it.  My bf continues to beg me to make it again claiming it is better than any restaurant lasagna he has ever had.  For future I would switch out the cottage cheese with ricotta.

Very Very good! I made this during the beef recall scare so I used ground turkey instead. I love the flavor and health benefits of eating turkey. I was concerned the flavor wouldn't be as good but it was. I added yellow squash, spinach and used ricotta and cottage cheese. Yum yum yum. I am happy that I made so much because this dish is going fast.

This turned out pretty good, even though I wasn't paying attention and added all the cheese before I put it in the oven. It was a bit crispy on top, but that was my fault. I didn't read the recipe carefully on the cooking times/directions. I like a bit more cheese, so next time i'll be more generous. Other than that, it was really good.

Very good, and worth the effort.  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese.  I liked the thicker layer of cheese mixture towards the top.  I would make this again.

My first time making lasagna and it was a big hit! I used ricotta as others suggested, but think I will use cottage cheese next time as ricotta doesn't offer enough flavor. Will definitely be making this again!

I made this recipe as written except I substituted riccota for the cottage cheese. I thought it was bland. Not as good as other lasagna recipes on this site.

This was a very good and flavorful dish.  I did everything as stated the only change I made was I added a green pepper.  I used the cottage cheese and BLENDED it with the egg and parmesan like the recipe states and it was great in taste and texture.  THis was my first time making lasagna (though my cousin makes an AWESOME one) and my husband now states that I make the best lasagna ever!!!!

This is a great recipe!  The only thing i did differently was use italian sausage, ricotta cheese and baby leaf spinach instead of the ground beef and cottage cheese.  I make this all the time.

This lasagna was the best I have ever had.  I did add some real tomatos to it, as well as some ricotta cheese.

I made this with light ricotta instead of cottage cheese, added mushrooms to the sauce, and used a little sharp cheddar in addition to the mozarella.  I also made a little more sauce than the recipe calls for.  It was delicious!

Again, like everyone else said, ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I put mushrooms in the sauce and added basil just to spice it up a bit, but other than that, absolutely perfect lasagna!

I am a beginner cook.  I made this recipe this past weekend with my husband.  Followed the recipe and made substitutions and additions as recommended by other reviewers: made a little more sauce, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, added fresh garlic when sauteeing the onions, added red pepper flakes for extra spice. 

I couldn't believe how great it tasted.  And it still tastes great after reheating in the microwave.  We are already planning on making this again in a few days for our family.  This is a fantastic recipe that is easy to follow.

Just made this recipe a couple nights ago.  Followed it almost to a T, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Also, half way through the layering process, I was quickly running low on cheese and sauce.. Grabbed some random cheeses and sauce from the fridge to make due and I used a bit more salt pepper and garlic powder than called for.  It turned out great!  Boyfriend loved it!  It was my first time ever making lasagna and he said it was even better than many people's so called 'famous' lasagnas that he's had.  Will definitely make this one again! :)

Best lasagna I've ever made! Used all the same ingredients but tweaked the amounts because I only had a 21 oz can of tomatoes- I just used a little less water. Family all loved it, even my picky 7 yr old.

My family enjoyed this recipe very much.  I have never added egg to Ricotta Cheese for baking and I loved the consistency.  I did not have all the ingredients for the sauce on hand so I used sauce from the store, and I felt it cut out extra work and still left us with a great dinner.  Thanks Linda!

I thought that this was pretty dry. I should have added more sauce. Very filling. Didnt have much flavor but was good. I like the cottage cheese. I would not have changed that at all. Next time i wont be cooking this as long. It drys it out even more.

This has been the end of my search for the perfect lasagna recipe, as deemed by my husband. :)  I, too, used ricotta.  Spicy sausage makes a great substitution for the burger if you want to notch the spice up a bit.  Thanks, Linda!

This was the first time that I've made lasagna and let me tell you it was AMAZING.  I followed it to the letter and it turned out perfectly.  Takes a little time to prepare but absolutely worth it.  My husband, who has had a lot of lasagna in his days, thought that I bought this from a restaurant.  He said it was the best he's ever had.   100 stars!!

This is very similar to my Mom's recipe. I don't like ricotta and neither does my family, so we prefer cottage cheese in any lasagna recipe.

Perfect!  My 11yr old daughter made this with little help from me and it turned out great.  Everybody ate it up and what little leftovers we had were gone early the next morning.  I'm told it was great the next day, too.  Only change made was using ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Excellent!  Thank you.

After reading many of the other reviews I used this recipe with only minor changes (I added one can of tomato sauce, used Ricotta for the cottage cheese and added two layers of Provolone Cheese). It turned out fantastic! My guests were raving about it and even preferred to eat the left over Lasagna the next day than the fresh fixed meal for lunch. And it tasted heated up even better. One of the best recipes I have tried so far from allrecipes.com. And, by the way, most of my guests are Italians (here in US only on vacation) – they should be able to tell a good Lasagna! Highly recommended recipe – Thanks for sharing :)

Delicious.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and added mushrooms.  Had to take this one off the table before my husband and kid devoured the whole thing!

Thank you for a great lasagna recipe.... I have been trying to find a good "classic" of all the recipes we like to have to put in my recipe box (and to hand down to my kids) and after trying a few that weren't that special  this one will definitely make the cut!!  Thank you so much!!

Amazing lasagna.  I make it once or twice a month from memory, and toss in some little extras like a ton more garlic.

This was absolutely delicious, however I had to fix it up a bit to my liking! I added a jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce. I suggest something tangy & smooth. Also, I doubled the lasagna noodles which gave it a thicker texture! After sprinkling extra garlic powder & sugar, the mixture was wonderful! The lasagna tasted delicious!!!

This is an excellent base recipe though I changed it to our liking.  I added two stalks of minced celery, three cloves of minced garlic, portobella mushrooms, fresh basil(to taste), two teaspoons of sugar and one large bay leaf which I took out before pouring the sauce into the casserole dish. What transpired was a great tasting lasagna! I think that the extra teaspoon of sugar makes all the difference. My husband and I used to order 'take out lasagna' at least twice a month- never again!

I absolutly adored it. I made it for my whole family and they were impressed. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese because I hate cottage cheese...lol. However it was still amazing and we gobled it all up. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!

I was nervous - this was my first lasagna.  Very easy.  Since I don't care for the consistency of ricotta, I really like this recipe that calls for cottage cheese.  I cut down on the mozz, though, but all is is terrific!

I thought the flavor of this lasagna was really good.  I loved the sauce.  The only thing I noticed was that there wasn't enough of it.  I had to add some jar sauce to make up for the lack.  But all-in-all, it was a really good recipe.

This recipe was fabulous! I used whole wheat "no boil" noodles and ground turkey, and it still tasted like lasagna from an Italian restaurant.  I also cut the salt from 2 tsp. to 1 tsp. Everyone loved it - thanks for the recipe!

Great lasagna. I made it with ground turkey instead of beef. And next time I think I will add some vegetables. But it has a great flavor.

I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.

I definitely thought this was good, but not outstanding.  I think I made a mistake on the seasoning.  I substituted Italian Seasoning for all the listed seasonings (including salt) and I think it needed the salt.  To get in more veggies, I added spinach and sliced mushrooms.  To make my life easier, I used the Barilla no cook noodles.

This is a great recipe... worth the wait!  Instead of cottage cheese I used riccotta and I used about 1/2 lb. more mozarrella than called for.  I also added a package of spinach to the sauce.  It was a hit with everyone.

Just the recipe I've been looking for! I've tried a bunch and something was always a little off - this one rocks! I didn't bother doing the sprinkling with cheese near the end, just put it all on and just took off the tinfoil for the last 15 minutes.

One word - YUM! :) I added some fresh basil into the sauce and if you want to dress it up a bit (and get sneaky with the kids), you can add some spinach into the filling. Really easy and quick. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe makes a delicious pan of lasagna; we all enjoyed it!  I made this exactly as it was written, and I can't think of anything that I'd want to change. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an awesome recipe!  I substitute extra-lean ground turkey for beef, and use fat-free cottage cheese for a lower-fat version, and it turns out yummy every single time.  Thanks so much!
