Kind of greasy and salty. Also, the directions don't really seem complete. Don't you use butter or cooking spray in the pan when you cook french toast?

This recipe is amazingly delicious!  I love French toast, and I love Spam, and when the two of them are put together, it's like a little piece of heaven on earth.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who likes Spam (and who doesn't?).  I eat this dish at least once a week.

I eat this probably, like, 4 times a week now. It's probably terrible for me, but it's soooo good. And the maple-syrup dip is perfect. I don't know what eating was all about before I made this sandwich.

The spam made the toast all soggy and greasy, not to mention super salty. You would do good to use real french bread to be able to pick up the sandwich. Spend the extra dollar and use real ham, works far better than spam in every aspect.

I rolled these up like Pigs in Blankets and poured syrup over them instead of dipping.  It was good but I think sausage is still better.  My BF enjoyed it much more because he really likes SpamÂ®, so this was a treat for him.

Ok. I couldn't get over the appearance of Spam in the can, it didn't look so good (never had it before) but I ignored that and fried it up anyway. I was pleasantly surprised! The saltiness of the ham and the sweetness of the french toast and syrup mixed well together. I might make this again, but next time I may just use a cut up ham steak.

I gave this four stars because I find it good, even though it's Spam (as another poster said, Spam is NOT cool in the Pacific Northwest!)  However my son, age 13, absolutely loved it, and he was skeptical in trying it. It is the only way he wants french toast now.

I made this for a family brunch at the lake.  When I told them what I would be making, they thought I was joking!  But when they sat down to eat, everyone was pleasantly surprised!  It was really good - a great recipe to mix things up!  - AND very easy to make!

This was an awesome brunch menu that is very easy to prepare. I actually turned it into a sandwich with two slices of luncheon meat between two slices of French Toast, with maple syrup on top of it all. Delicious!

Didn't like it, but I have realized I don't care for spam, so maybe it would be good if you like spam.

Again, we're not big Spam people, but we all love ~Taylor Ham~. This was an interesting sandwich that was surprisingly good. Sweet and salty always does the trick. Thanks!

My family loved this! I used my own recipe for french toast which uses only 2 eggs to 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 tsp vanilla extract (about 4 slices of bread)  Added the fried spam, folded and dipped in syrup! Delicious!  Thanks for sharing another tasty way to use good ole fried spam!

We're not big on spam, either. Went with Linda McLean's advice as to  the ~TAYLOR HAM~ instead. We love sweet and salty!   Thanks, Patti!

We like Spam once in a while, and I decided to try this.  It's got the sweet/salty combo that's good, but overall I thought it was heavy.  Dipped the sandwich in some pancake syrup as I ate it.

I gave this a five star because I didn't follow directions. I added sugar to the milk and eggs. Sprayed pan with cooking spray and browned on both sides.  Took a piece of french toast and placed a piece of crispy spam on one side, added some ketchup and fold.  Sweet, salty and yummy.  No need for syrup.

This is a pretty easy recipe to make. I will make it again as I like the sweet and salty mix.

I made this for a late brunch. I have to say it was very quick and easy for some non-cooks like me and my family. I made it with PAM non-stick cooking spray because it was what was convenient for me, better for me, and the recipe was quiet versatile. At the end I also put a tomato at the end to make it much more healthier and taste a little fresher. Also a word of the wise, you should make sure it's really fried and put it into the egg mixture QUICKLY because you do NOT want soggy egg bread.

This was surprisingly good. I was very concerned about my french toast being too eggy but that was not the case. It was especially good dipped in the syrup. I did spray the skillet for the french toast but that was the only change I made.

Spamalicious!!! I added a little cinnamon to the egg batter, dusted with powdered sugar, and dipped in Maple syrup. Everyone LOVED it! Thanks so much for the idea! I will be making this often.
