This is a very "simple and light" apple topping, and I liked it! I used orange juice instead of lemon juice because it's what I had, and it worked just fine. I cooked my apples on low heat for 10 minutes without adding any water and they still had a little crunch to them, which I liked. If you want them soft, you might need to add the water and cook longer. I used these to top my Ultimate French Toast. A delicious and filling breakfast.

I have made this several times, but I used Splenda brown sugar blend and left out the raisins.  It's good with pork roast
