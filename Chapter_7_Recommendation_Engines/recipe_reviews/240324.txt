I'm not sure why the flour and baking powder are necessary (some lemon bar recipes call for it, other don't), but no matter - these are delicious.  As I always do with lemon bars, be it a 2-egg recipe in an 8" square pan (as I made), or a 4-egg recipe for a 9x13" pan, I used 1-1/2 times the filling, as I prefer a  higher filling to crust ratio.

Made for Recipe Group. Outstanding! I used 1 1/2 times the filling, cause I'm like Naples, like the extra lemon hit! It did get very brown on the top before the filling was done enough, but with powdered sugar on the top, it covers all that up. Thanks for the recipe, they were a hit at a surprise 30th birthday party!

Made this for the Buzz Recipe Group.  I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8" x 8" pan. I used freshly squeezed lemon juice and freshly laid eggs.  These lemon triangles smelled delicious while baking and tasted even better.  According to the directions, I was supposed to allow the baked lemon bars to cool before cutting, well forget that - we couldn't wait, thus the surface of the bars cracked as I cut them into triangles.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Lori we loved these luscious delights!

Lemon bars have always been my favorite dessert. My husband and granddaughter liked the sweeter crust. You will also need to use the aluminum foil, so the lemon bars do not stick to the pan.

EXCELLENT!  I wanted to participate in the recipe group this week but had no lemons, yes I used lemon juice knowing that it would make a big difference as stated in the recipe.  I read the reviews and followed Naples' suggestion of making 1 1/2 times the filling for a higher filling to crust ratio.  The end result was outstanding.  Next time I will use real lemons and see how much difference there is.  The recipe group sure made a great choice this week!  Thank you Lori for sharing this EXCELLENT recipe!

Nice lemon flavor. I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 glass pan lined with parchment. Glad I used the parchment. Nice lemon flavor with a crisp crust. The crust took about 18 minutes in my oven. I poked holes in it before baking. The filling bake did take 25 minutes. The parchment made it nice and easy to remove the bars from the pan to a cutting board. The next day they tasted even better

Great lemon flavor.  Made just as written no need for change(s).  Made them for my brother's birthday as he is mad about lemon merange pie and a self professed expert on 'lemon'  - he loved it.  Definitely a keeper.

Recipe Group Selection:  30, May 2015 ~ Wonderful!  I halved the recipe and baked it in my stoneware pan.  My DH tried them and said, "wow, they are very lemony".  That is exactly what I was hoping for.  I only had one lemon, so I had to use bottled lemon juice to equal the 2.5 oz.  Nice flavor, simple to make, enjoyed by all.  Thanks Lori, for sharing your recipe.

I have my traditional go-to lemon bar recipe, but I was looking for something a little different. I made exactly to recipe. I just made a half batch in 8"x8" pan and lined with parchment instead of foil. My friends and family raved about them. I would add a photo, but it would just be a plate with a few crumbs.  I now have a new go-to dessert recipe. Thank you for sharing this.

I made the LLTs exactly as outlined, including with the foil (which I did spray with PAM), even though I was a bit unsure why it wasn't parchment paper.  The foil worked - just a bit of crust adhered on one side. My cooking times were a tad longer too.  The LLTs  were really good.  I actually froze them a week ahead of serving, and sprinkled the icing sugar on at the last minute.  Delicious; I'll make these again next time I want lemon squares.  Personally I wouldn't double the filling or halve the crust -- they're already soft and gooey enough.

One of the best things about going to Arizona each winter is the abundance of fresh lemons.  Of all the "lemon" recipes I have tried, we much prefer this one!  I also make it in Manitoba with frozen lemon juice I have squeezed from my AZ lemons.  Even without the zest, the lemon flavour is full on.  I agree with Naples, using 1 1/2 times the filling is a good crust to filling ratio.  Thanks to Lori, I have found my favourite lemon recipe.

Very good! I used real lemons and added extra lemon peel but these weren't super tart or lemony, but they are super yummy! I will make these again, and will add more lemon next time!
