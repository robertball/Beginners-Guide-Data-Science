I use simple recipes as I find where they are complicated they are not that much better.  I just made this pie and I will be making this one again and again!  It is so flavorful!  The only changes I made were using less sugar, (3/4 C of sugar) and 5 oz of Evaporated Milk 
(rather than 1/2 C milk).  This is all I had in the house.  

It truly came out like a Sweet Potato Pie as opposed to the taste of a Pumpkin Pie.  I noticed that amazingly enough, the recipe is identical to Sweet Potato Pie 1, my next recipe choice.  My Fiance' loved the pie as well, so no need to fancy it up!

Fantastic!  I'll never make pumpkin pie again.  Only modification I made was to eliminate the nutmeg. I didn't have any, but I thought it would make it taste too much like pumpkin. Increased cinnamon a bit (just rounded the measuring spoon). Also used half Splenda & half sugar. Family loved it and I also took to a work pot luck lunch and they all loved it too.  I also used a frozen pie shell, but after thawing, I put it in the oven for 10 minutes. Kept the bottom from being soggy.

I followed the recipe to the letter. Great texture and taste. Will be making this during the holidays and beyond. It is so much better than pumpkin pie.

Was not sweet enough or dense enough. It was good just not "I'll make it again" good.

This was the second time I made the pie.  It was delicious.  Easy to make.  Next time I will make homemade crust, but other than that; I followed the recipe to the T.

I have an 21 year old grandson who loves pumpkin pie. I tricked him by making this sweet potato pie. I took pictures as  I prepared it as proof of what was used. He says he now has a new favorite pie.

Added flour to thicken the filling, a touch a fresh ginger,  3/4 c white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar.   One of the best pies I've made.

Everyone loved it. I used 3 large sweet potatoes and  I was able to make (2) 9in pies. The only adjustment I made was to replace the milk with Carnation evaporated milk because it is sweeter and thicker. Great recipe!

Turned out wonderful. Only thing I added was bourbon. If you're a novice baker start with this wonderful pie.

I used canned sweet potatoes (about 2/3 of a 40oz can -the large can).  I baked it for about 1hr and 20 min.  Everyone said it was much better than the standard pumpkin for Christmas dinner! Very easy.
