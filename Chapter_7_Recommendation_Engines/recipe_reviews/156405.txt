Some suggestion. Since you are using only the outer skin of the lemon, look for organic lemons that have not been treated with nasty stuff. Look for lemon varieties that have a thick skin and are high in essential oils. Try peeling thin strips with a potato peeler. A zester will prematurely release the oils in the skin. Try to avoid the pith (white part) as this is what causes bitterness. Also try an alternative sweetener such as agave instead of refined sugar for a warmer palate feel. This recipe will create a Limoncello that is a little low in alcohol over traditional Limoncello. If you are using Vodka (40% 80 proof) the final alcohol will be less that 20% instead of 30-35%. It will freeze at this proof. A higher proof alcohol will extract out the oils and color faster. We love Limoncello so much we started a company in Sonoma to produce it commercially. Salute!

I used vodka instead of water, and the zest of 18 lemons.  It was incredible!

This recipe makes: limoncello, or a lemon flavored vodka. Don't be expecting a mixed drink or something sweet, because it is not. It should be used just like any liqueur to basically make mixed drinks. Allrecipes, has 5-6 recipes to use limoncello in under the advanced search button. It tried a couple and it was fine that way. I made it just as is, but cut the recipe in half. It ended up as 4 lemons peeled. I used a potato peeler, as suggested by the first reviewer. That same person is also right (make sure to not get any of the white part of the rind. It is bitter). The rest, or half the recipe, equaled to 17.5 oz of vodka, 17.5 oz water, and 2 1/4 cups of sugar. I let it sit 3 days as suggested. I only had vanilla vodka, so I used that. I also found, today, it tastes good mixed in some 100% cranberry-pomengranite juice. I may also try it in some sparkling lemonade, as someone suggested. I just wish I would have known in advance that this was not sweet. It was a lot of work, to just make a lemon infused vodka. Interesting to learn though.

This is a beautifully simple recipe that produced a wonderful aperitif. I used the Meyer lemons from my tree and grain alcohol, as the recipe advised. I let the lemon/alcohol steep for a week or two. Just wonderful!

This is delicious! The few changes I made were use a 1.75 litre of Vodka. I couldn't get very nice slices of the Lemon peel without the white part,so I zested the rest. I also added the juice from the lemons(I didn't want to waste it) And thought it would add even more lemon flavor. Instead of just adding the water & sugar to the Lemon/Vodka mixture, I added about 4 cups sugar to 4 cups water and made simple syrup(equal parts water and sugar, cooked to dissolve the sugar, cooled it & added it to the lemon/Vodka mixture. I plan on bottling this in mason jars and giving to a few friends for Christmas! Thank you for a easy recipe!!
