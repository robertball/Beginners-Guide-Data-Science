Cut the cream down to 2 pints, double the cheese (we used half Romano/half Parm), sub white pepper for black, up the pinch of nutmeg to about 1/4 tsp., add a clove of crushed garlic to the sauce, garnish with flat leaf Italian parsley and you've got a "To Die For Fettuccini Alfredo" goin' on here! Served with grilled chicken, asparagus and garlic toast last night... everyone was in heaven. Thanks Michelle!

OMG!!!!!!!  MMMMMM.  I changed it a little.  I cooked 5 boneless, skinless ckn breasts and cut into small pieces. 
I cut the cream to 2 pints, but used 1 cube butter. I also added 1 TBSP minced garlic. I used 6 oz romano and 6 oz parmesan instead. I stirred in the ckn when the sauce was about done, added some salt and lots of pepper.  This is soooooo good.

It's a good base to start with, but if you make the dish exactly as the recipe says, it is extremely bland. The amount of cheese needs to be DOUBLED and it needs salt. I add shrimp to it which helps as well. It's just alright. I certainly wouldn't "die" for it!

You weren't kidding when you said VERY RICH. Delicious recipe. Just a note . . . the sauce takes quite awhile to get its thickness, so plan ahead!

We absolutely loved this recipe!  I am a Fettuccini Alfredo lover and this was the best I've ever tasted.  Very rich and very fattening!  It was wonderful.  Can't wait to make it again!

All I had was 1/2 & 1/2, it didn't thicken up so I just tossed it all together once the pasta was done, brought the whole thing up to a boil then took it off the heat & let it cool so the sauce would thicken.  I'm pregnant & was looking for something bland & creamy - this hit the spot.  If I weren't pregnant I probably would have added some garlic.

This turned out really tasty.  I changed it up a bit.  I cooked some chopped garlic in butter and olive oil before I added the cream.  I used 1 quart of heavy cream and 1 pint of fat free half and half, a mixture of shredded parmesan and Romano cheeses, cooked chicken and some fresh parsley to finish it off.  The finished dish definitely needs a bit of salt.  Overall a decent alfredo recipe.

As written, I am giving this a 3 stars.  I used 1 quart of whipping cream, a T chopped garlic and almost 1 1/2 cups Parmesan/Romano cheese. I also added salt to taste and it was really good! I would say 4 stars with the changes.  Doubt I will make very often though because of the fat and calories.  Thanks for sharing!

The flavor was nice but I didn't think it was worth the time and effort when you can just add a dash of "nutmeg" to any pre-made Alfredo sauce to achive the same flavor.

Delicious!! The only thing I changed was I melted the first tablespoon of butter & fried some garlic in it & tossed that with the hot pasta.  My boyfriend & I loved this, will definitely make it again!

I used yellow cheese and cut the cream and butter, subbing some olive oil. This dish really needs to be served fresh and the party I was bringing it to was a few hours later so....

This fettuccini has a good flavour once the adjustments are made (garlic and extra cheese + salt) but the consistency was off and it didn't thicken the way I would have liked.

Def. not for those watching their waistlines!! I don't make fettuccini alfredo often but when I do I like to make it this way.  I didn't want to store 3 pints of heavy cream so I bought a pint and used a cup of it in a different recipe so mine was a little butterey but that was ok. Kids loved it as well as me!!!

I just eyeballed the amount of ingredients, which I would recommend. I don't like mine soaked in sauce, so I just add enough cream to make it work like about a fourth of a cup, and half the cheese too.

I decided to try this dish as i was out of eggs an i was really suprised. yes i agree that following the recipe makes it come out very bland however this could be because i only had grated Parmesan instead of Remano.

I added Chilli and Garlic Black pepper seasoning into the recipe and it gave it the kick that it was missing

Overall:
Very easy and quiite nice if you are in a hurry but i think there are better recipes out there than this one

I love Fettuccini Alfredo, I havent tried too many different recipe's for the sauce, as I stick to the one I really enjoy.  I saw this recipe and was a bit reluctant to try it as it seems to be a very creamy sauce, but I had some Romano cheese and thought I'd try it out.
Right off the get-go I could tell that it would be too creamy for my taste, so cut back a little bit on the whipping cream, but not enough it seems.  In the end, all I ended up with was fettuccini in a soup of whipping cream.  I dont really think i was able to taste the cheese that was in the sauce.  The sauce ended about the same taste as the prepared bottles of alfredo sauce that you can get at most grocery stores.

A great cream sauce!! I'm usually not a very big Alfredo fan (it's my husband's and child's fave, so I made it anyways) but this sauce was great! I'd definately make it again! Thank you!

I was SO excited to make this and kind of disappointed.  The taste was ok, but the texture was grainy...I couldn't get the cheese to melt.  I followed the other reviewers advice and reduced the cream to 2 c. and added 1 c. milk.  The cream started bubbling quickly (oh, also added clove of minced garlic), but once I added the cheese, it just remained in little shreds.  Not sure if it was the cheese quality (pre-shredded, not fresh, but not in the green can, either) or the recipe, but it ended up being thick and grainy instead of smooth and velvety.  Seemed, like another reviewer stated, an awful lot of work when I could have gotten the same (if not better) taste/texture from a jar!

OMG! This is fabulous.  I had to make changes based on what I had available otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I melted only 3T butter and then added the dry Italian Seasonings dressing mix and garlic powder.  I reduced the whipping cream to 1 pint and used grated Romano, Parmesan and Asiago.  I also added some chicken.  The only thing I would do different is use some milk and not as much whipping cream as it was very RICH.

This was very good. It was simple and required nothing fancy, but wow did this ever take a long time! The sauce alone took an hour and a half and I didn't reduce it any, just cooked it until the cheese was melted and no longer gritty. I turned the heat up to lo-med as well, as low heat wasn't doing much and I didn't have all day. I did use a  blend of parmesan, romano cheese and added another half cup. The nutmeg was a nice addition and I added another pinch. We sprinkled this with crushed red pepper and the only suggestion my family had was to add some shrimp to this. I would suggest maybe adding a bit of garlic powder as well, but everything I make starts with butter and garlic. Very good dish, I will make this again!

I followed some of the comments and added garlic and it was good.  Very filling and it makes enough for 4 adults with a bit of leftovers.

This was awesome! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars, is because on the 2nd time I made it I jazzed it up a little and it tastes so much better jazzed up. I added chicken breast seasoned with salt/pepper, onion powder and italian seasoning. I sauted up some garlic in butter first and then added the chiken until it was cooked through. I made the alfredo sauce exactly as mentioned and added an additional cup of parmesan cheese and then tossed all the ingredients together with the pasta and added monterey/colby cheese and parsley. This is a good base Alfredo recipe that is easy to prepare and cheap...it allows you to add what you want to make it fit your tastes. Thanks for this AWESOME recipe!

Pretty good.  Unfortunatly Wal-Mart here didn't sell any romano cheese!!!  So I just used an itallian mixture of shredded cheese.  It had Romano, parmesan, and asagio cheeses in it.  This recipe tasted like it was missing something.  But it came out really smooth, which is great compared to other recipes.  Oh, and it took a really long time for the cream to start simmering.  After about 40 minutes of stirring I got impatient, and turned the heat up to med-high.  I'm thinking about using straight parmesan and some garlic next time.  I wonder if that will work....

I think I'm missing something here. Is it really 3 pints of cream? That seems like an awful lot. I tried it and it took forever to thicken. I finally had to get rid of 3/4 of the cream and then it thickened. What gives?

Heavenly!!  My husband, like reviewer, SANDRAFOWLER's fiance, scrapped our plates!  Fettuccini Alfredo is one of our favorite dishes.  I totally craved this when I was pregnant (and believe it or not I only gained 8 lbs. with my pregnancy!)  Never again will we order this in a restaurant because I can make it better thanks to Michelle Barr!!

This was the best! It took a long time for the cream to bubble, I had to keep turning up the heat, but when it was finally done it was awesome! I added previously cooked shrimp and garlic. My husband loved it!

delicious! i made some to serve with chicken parmigian i made. it was the best accompanying dish everr!   the sauce does take some patience to thicken, but if you just keep stirring until it thickens up it is sooo worth iT!

I was excited when I read all the great reviews but...I didn't find this to die for. The sauce never got thick, way too much butter.I did use less pasta.
It was ok but lacked something maybe more cheese? And it didn't heat up with cream the next day either just butter oozed out. Sorry

I wish I would have followed my instincts on cutting back the amount of cream since there was only 1 cup of cheese required. I ended up using 3 cups of cheese, and the sauce was still not thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Even with the nutmeg, pepper, and the bit of garlic I added, the flavor just wasn't what I was hoping for.

I don't like fettuccini alfredo usually......but I LOVED this recipe.  My fiance loved it so much he was scraping his bowl, my bowl, and our roommate's bowl for leftover sauce.  I added nearly twice the amount of cheese and used fresh garlic.  The only thing I really added salt to was a light s&p sprinkle on the chicken I added when it was cooking.

I made this sauce to go with the Lasagne Rollup recipe from this website(pasta) and it was very good.  I had some problem thought getting the sauce thick enough, it still wasn't reduced after 15 minutes so I had to use some thickener tothicken it up.

This was so tasty.  I added seasoned, cooked shrimp and some cut-up grilled chicken just before serving.  The recipe was easy to make - the only thing that was unclear was how long it took to reduce the sauce.  It took longer than I anticipated - about 15 minutes.  But the results were well worth it.  My family was impressed!

This recipe is so easy and fast to make. It can be used as a side dish or a main dish by adding some meat and veggies for a laborless meal that tastes like you spent  hours in the kitchen. Adding some rotisserie chicken makes it a main dish in short order. I cooked and drained my fettuccini in a medium sauce pan and added the butter, cream and cheese right on top of the hot noodles and placed back on stove until all was melted then blended in the seasonings. It was ready in minutes and was delicious!

Substitute a mix of pepper jack cheese and provolone with some mashed capers and oven roasted garlic and you will BEGIN to realize what culinary excellence means.  Add minced bacon and whole medium crawfish tails and you will be in culinary heaven!

We loved it!  I made it for guests and followed a couple of other reviews which added nutmeg and garlic to the sauce, plus doubled the cheese.  I also grilled 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and added those to the sauce.  I felt a little guilty since it is so loaded with calories, but it's good enough to splurge on once in a awhile!

As written it is blah.  Takes way to long to reduce all the liquid.  So I replace the butter with cream cheese, eliminated the cream and used 1 1/2 cups half and half and added mushrooms to the sauce along with some garlic powder and dried shallots.

Cook the pasta very el dente and put it in the sauce for 3 to 4 minutes to finish cooking and help the sauce thicken.

Top with chopped rotisserie or smoked chicken (our preference) and macadamia nut pesto.

I make this dish all the time. This recipe ratio is off. It needs more cheese and i add grated greyer cheese too. ALso black pepper is a must. I don't add garlic.

I make it all the time. To give it a little kick use white pepper.You.cannot tell the difference if you use half and half instead of heavy cream.It's not so heavy and a bit healthier. I also add a quarter pound of prochutto chopped. now, that's awesome.

I've made Alfredo this way for years, but with a few adjustments.  I melt the butter with a little bit of garlic.  I then add the cream cheese and instead of cream, I use fat free half and half.  Saves a bunch of calories and with the parm and cream cheese, you'll never miss it!

WAAAY too much cream!! If you save a cup of the pasta water, and add it gradually to the pan with the buttered pasta and cheese, you can then adjust to your own taste how much cream to add. You need the nutmeg! But if you look at true Italian recipes to make this dish, some have no cream at all. The starch in the pasta water may be all you need to get a nice, creamy sauce.

Mine turned out AMAZING!!! I made some changes though. I added more pepper than called for, but also garlic powder, onion powder, & salt. I also added chicken & broccoli to mine. It was SO good! There was a lot of sauce though for the amount of noodles. It did "soak" in some once it cooled. I may not use 3 pints of cream next time. Maybe just 2.

I sauteed fresh garlic and added the cream.  I used 2 pints of cream and about 2 cups of cheese.  I used the cheeses I had on hand (Parm, romano, and sharp provolone) The family loved it!!

I think this recipe has transformed my family for generations to come, lol.  We are a family of fettucine alfredo lovers, and this dish can be very pricey in restaurants.  I took the advice of those who said to cut the cream down from 3 pints to 2 and to double the cheese.  I don't have a large variety of high quality hard cheeses where I live, so I substituted a lovely Asiago for about 2/3 of the cheese, and another 1/3 of grated parmesan.  It is important, I think, to stress that by parmesan we do not mean the stuff that comes in the plastic container in the supermarket.  I used some aged parmesan that I almost didn't have to grate - we had frozen it and it was crumbly around the edges.  Both cheeses, however, I grated using the largest holes on the grater - I don't know if that made a difference or not.

The amazing thing about this recipe is, to me, how basically simple it is.  Of course, sometimes simple recipes can be ruined if one doesn't treat the recipe and the ingredients with respect.

Thank you Michelle, and thank you, other reviewers.

I was in the mood for some dietary indulgence, so I thought I'd give this recipe a shot.  It turned out great with no changes to the recipe.  The only thing I had a little trouble with is getting all the cheese to melt.  But all in all, this is a winner...unfortunately due to the decadence, it will have to be saved for special occasions. Thanks! :-)

I made a chicken fettucini alfredo with this recipe and it turned out wonderfully. I made a bit too much, and tried to save some for leftovers, and it definitely does not keep, so be careful not to over do it.

I don't normally like fettuccini, but this one was good.  It might be better with extra ingredients like peppers or veggies.  It's good cold like a noodle salad...add broccoli and serve cold!

This was easy and really good.  I added cut up chicken breast just before serving.  Everyone liked it! :-)

What's not to like?  Rich cream sauce with real butter and romano cheese.  Definitely not for the diet conscious but great for a mother-daughter no husbands at home meal served with fresh Greek salad!!
