Boy, were my parents surprised to come home to find fresh, homemade egg tarts!  We're a Chinese family living in San Francisco who go out to Chinatown every weekend, so we know our Chinese dim sum!  After starting the crust, I realized I didn't have any evaporated milk, so I substituted instant skim milk powder reconstituted in water (we don't keep milk around the house).  It still turned out great!  The custard is perfect - just like the ones from Chinatown!  Next time, I'll reduce the sugar in the crust because it reminded me of a sugar cookie.  I also used a mini muffin tin because I didnt' have any tart shells.  I would recommend rolling the dough into balls and rolling them out with a rolling pin because the crust was uneven and a little too thick in some of them.  I would also lower the oven temperature next time because the crust was brown before the custard was set, though it may be because I used the mini muffin tin.  The house smelled wonderful while these were baking!

These are absolutely delicious! I hesitated after seeing the mix reviews but decided to go ahead anyway.The recipe is easy to follow, and yes, the tarts taste like bought-from-store. I've reduced the sugar for the dough to 90gm and 100 gm for the custard as I do not like them too sweet. And yes, there is too much custard for the dough - you'll need 1.5 times of the dough to use up the custard. I've substituted evaporated milk with fresh milk and they still turn out great. I've tried replacing butter with margarine and regretted it - the tarts were bland. So just stick to butter. Will definitely make this again. My dad and husband were totally impressed! Thanks for the recipe :}

the egg custard was good, taste just like the ones from the chinese bakery shop.  however, the pastry is somewhat flat - suggest using cake flour instead of plain flour for added fluffiness.

I halved the recipe. There was indeed too much custard for the amount of dough. I derived 10 medium sized tarts from this recipe, though the leftover custard could have filled 5 more tart shells.

I baked the tarts in 2 batches, the first batch was baked at 200 degrees celsius for 13 minutes. The tart shells came out perfect and golden, but the custard was overcooked on the top- there was a thick gel-like layer instead of wobbly custard goodness.

I baked my second batch at 190 degrees celsius for 17 minutes; they turned out fantastically!

I tried using this recipe but face some problems from the start when I went to purchase the INGREDIENTS. I couldn't find CONFECTIONER'S SUGAR OR ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR. Maybe it's because the ingredients are different here.
I had to use Self Raising Flour which didn't turn out the way it should, like the picture.
I also have plenty of eggs left from the 9 eggs that were beaten.
I thought it would be easy but it wasn't as easy as I thought.

Could you tell me if its ok to use SELF RAISING FLOUR and should I purchase foil styled baking cases? As I found the paper baking cases weren't as good as the egg pours out of the tart.

The tart also raise to high that it burns so fast at the top but that's because I've been using SELF RAISING FLOUR because I couldn't find ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR.

Anyway, I hope you can help as I love Chinese Egg Tarts and want to learn how to make it so I can share with my friends and family.

It cost 80p each for a Chinese Egg Tart here in Scotland and that's very expensive.

My family loved it! The filling was perfect. Except it was just a tad too sweet, i would use a different crust (no sugar added preferably) Just like from the bakeries and shops! would make again for sure. btw, i used a fork and made marks along the edges of the crust for a pretty effect.

The custard tasted okay and the crust is more like a sugar cookie.  It'd be good just as a regular custard tart (maybe a 9 inch tart pan), and not Hong Kong Style.  The Hong Kong egg tarts I've had in SF and in Hong Kong always had a puff pastry kind of crust, so next time I'll use puff pastry. I used a muffin (12), mini muffin (24), and 2 four-inch tart pans and still had enough dough to make more.  There was also a lot of the filling left maybe about 2 cups.  I had to use almost an extra stick of butter for the dough to hold together, and instead of using a fork I used a pastry blender.  Itâ€™d probably be easier to use a food processor. My first batch the crust browned too much before the custard was set, so I lowered the temp and baked until the middle jiggled, then took it out of the oven. The middle of the tart should be more like a flan.  I thought it tasted a bit eggy, I might just use less eggs next time.

I used the store bought frozen tart shells (in the section where the frozen pie crusts are), which makes this recipe easy and quick to make.  I gave it four stars only because I have yet to make the shell myself and the store bought ones doesn't match the egg filling as well.

This recipe yields 24 of the store bought  frozen tart shells.

Great recipe for the custard. For the crust I used a butter pastry tart crust recipe instead:   1 1/2 sifted all purpose flour 1/8 tsp salt 1/2 cup butter 1 egg yolk 2-3 tbsp cold water.   Cut the butter into the flour and salt, then mix iwth the egg yolk. Gradually add water, then shape into a ball, roll out, and fit into tart pan.  Very easy and much, much better crust.

This recipe has the right ingredients, but the proportions are way off.
I already know how to make egg tarts, so I just wanted to see what this creates. This came out worse than I expected. Crust was more like a cookie, and the custard lacks any taste (other than the taste of egg).

Just to warn everyone: it's obvious this recipe uses too many eggs in the custard (9 eggs!! while you only use 1.5 cups of water and 1 cup of evap. milk?).the amount of custard left over was more than 2.5 cups.

I was not impressed at all with the crust - but the filling tasted as good as the bakery shops in San Francisco!  I used Trader Joe's puffed pastry as the crust and it tasted fantastic (it was quicker to use, too!)

Highly recommended recipe, although would substitute the crust

Most men donot bake, but I decided to try this recipe.  The filling yielded twice the amount needed.  The recipe for the dough is wrong unless I missed something.  It calls for 1 egg beaten to 1 cup confectioners' sugar & 3 cups all-purpose flour.  That did not make dough.  What did I do wrong?

The egg custard filling is excellent!!  I used it to fill some pre-crisped wonton shells & they were really good & fast.  Sorry I didn't try the shortbread crust this time--next time....

I only made the filling because I prefer using a crust recipe that includes lard which makes for a more flaky crust. I had previously tried another egg custard recipe where presentation wise the crust and filling looked exactly like the ones in the bakeries. The taste of the filling wasn't as tender as I would like it so I thought I would try this recipe. I was disappointed because this filling was worse than the other recipe. It was too stiff and eggy. I had baked the custard at first for 10 mins at 450F and then lowered it to 350 for additional time and the custard puffed up way too much and then collapsed when I took it out of the oven. A food expert online said baking egg custards at too high a temperature will cause the filling to bubble up and burst so next time I'm going to stick to the other recipe that calls for baking at 325F for 35 mins.

These turned out very good. I just used a muffin pan. I did have a little more egg mixture left over. But not that much. I cooked on the high heat as stated, then turned my oven off to let the custard set for about 10 or 15 min. I've never had egg tarts before so I thought the whole thing turned out very nicely. You diffently can taste egg.

I have had egg tarts both in San Francisco and here in Portland, OR.  These compare very well, though to be honest, I am only comparing the filling.  I was lazy and used prepared pie crust, as I was making them in mini muffin tins for a Chinese New Year potluck and needed a bunch (I would have finished with over 6 dozen had the dog not eaten some).  The filling is a shade sweeter than the restaurant's tarts, but that's ok with me.  FYI, use 4 pie crusts for the amount of filling shown.  I like a high filling to crust ratio, so I rolled the crusts out a couple of inches to make them a little thinner.  I had success with both the "roll it in a ball and press it in the tin" technique and the "roll it out and cut it with a biscuit cutter" technique.  The biscuit cutter I have is fluted, so it made for pretty edges.  I used a 2 1/2" cutter for the mini muffin tins, and baked 12 minutes at 425 degrees F.  I also tried some of the pre-baked phyllo shells, but I did not like that the filling ran down under them.  Hubby liked those best, though!

The custard was dead on!  The crust, definitely more dense and buttery like a cookie crust than the flaky, crusty top, moist shell of the bakery/restaurant.  More work than i expected however.  If you care about the presentation at all, making each individual crust does take a lot of time and care to roll and flatten.  Tasty enough that i'd try making it again, but i would definitely make the balls no larger than 1 inch in size, then flatten each with a rolling pin so that the crust is de-emphasized and the taste of the custard comes out more.

Tried making it a second time.  Used Prepackaged Pillsboury pie crust.  Used a glass flipped upside down to cut out perfectly shaped round doughs and placed them directly into muffin trays.  Make sure to use nonstick spray.  The crust was flaky, and light, just like in a Chinese bakery.  Because the crust bakes much faster, be careful not to bake too long, however.  I overbaked them at 15 minutes, and i'm thinking 10-12 minutes would be appropriate. The crust came out much better this way, and it took A LOT less prep time.

Very good. The custard is creamy and the crust is a lot like a cookie. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to cover the edges of the crust in tinfoil the last few minutes of baking to prevent over browning.

This was a good, easy recipe. Reading the other reviews about how there was too much filling, I altered my recipe a bit. And instead of making the crust myself, I used a box of Pillsbury pie crust. I used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 cup water, 6 eggs and 1/2 cup evaporated milk. This was enough for 20-22 egg tarts.

I tried this recipe several days ago and it was delicious. I reduced the sugar in the dough and i should have increased the amount of sugar in the custard as the custard itself wasn't very sweet. Also, i only used 8 eggs (not 9 as the recipe suggested). Be prepared to have too much leftover custard and having to make a second batch of dough. Additional to that, i made about 20 tarts from this recipe - not 12 like the recipe said (maybe my shells were smaller). I would suggest cutting down the ingredients to the custard down to half (if you don't want to end up having to make 40 egg tarts - like i did! Now, everyone in the house is afraid of egg tarts).

Not to my liking, but you have to like egg custard.  The dough for the crust was okay nothing special.  I probably won't be making again.

The custard was perfect...not too sweet like the way I like it, however, the pastry was a little tough.  Me and my boyfriend put  less dough and more butter but the pastry was still tough (although the extra butter did give it a very nice flavour!)  I decreased the temperature to 375 F and if the crust begins to brown too quickly, I suggest loosely wrapping aluminum foil over the tarts to prevent the crust from overbrowning.  According to other reviewers, the dough was also too sweet so I decreased the confectioner's sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup, which still made it sweet enough.  The recipe also produced too much custard mixture (which I didn't mind) so I just put the excess custard in 3 ramekins and baked it at 350 F for about 25 - 30 minutes and it made delicious egg custards!  In conclusion, I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the dough (I'm use to the soft, flaky ones they serve at chinese bakeries) but everything is was great!

Of course most importantly, the filling is quite authentic and was perfect as directed.  The pastry recipe makes a firm butter shell.  I ended up having to add an extra tablespoon of margarine.

I tried this recipe today & it got down quite well. However, several things require changes. I tried mixing butter & sugar together first, it was easier that way, to add the flour later. 190-200oC, the tarts turn out just right. Adding a little water, about a table spoon does help in making the dough. Using a forks to press the sides also helps in making it physical appealing. The egg tart filling is way too much, halving it would be fantastic.

I made a few modifications to the recipe and my tarts came out nearly perfect!  First, I lowered the heat to 400 degrees, which extended the cooking time by 5-10 min.  They tarts are ready when the center puffs up.  Second, I substituted extra virgin coconut oil for the butter to lower the cholesterol impact.  Make sure to use the pure stuff that is in solid state at room temp.  Third, after I pressed the dough into the tart pans, I poke a few holes in the bottom with a fork to prevent the crust from puffing up under the egg....which is what happened when I didn't poke holes.  
While I did find that the recipe yielded more dough than egg mixture, my proportions weren't that far off.  I used 2 3/4" egg tart tins (which I finally found on eBay being sold directly by Chinese manufacturers after I had scoured internet retailers and couldn't find them).

While the cookie base would make a great cookie, it is most definitely NOT great for the crust of an egg tart.
The egg custard center is anything but.  I was looking for smooth and velvety custard, but this recipe (followed to a T) resulted in scrambled egg tasting custard that was clumpy when cut into.
I will search elsewhere for a truely authentic egg tart recipe.

From reading the reviews, I reduced the eggs to 5 eggs and increased the crust ingredients by another half. I made 24 tarts using aluminum muffin pans. Results, mm mm good. I will try this recipe again, but completely substituting the water, vanilla extract, and evaporated milk with coconut milk and coconut extract to create a coconut custard tart.

These were delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and used one store bought pie crust (cut into rounds with a glass and put into a greased muffin tin) to make 12 little tarts. I still had some filling leftover, so I think next time I will make 1/3 of the original recipe. I baked them for 13 minutes at 400 degrees, and they came out perfect.  The custard was silky smooth and light, and the crust was flaky and just barely golden brown.

I used 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar for the crust instead, and it turned out fine. This recipe is pretty time-consuming, especially during the process of making the crust. To save time, I heated the water and sugar before making the crust so that the sugar mixture can cool while I'm working on the crust. Make sure you make the crust thinner because it expands while baking.

The custard is really good, almost like those you buy from Dim Sum restaurants. I know this because I am Chinese. :)

This recipe makes more than 12 tarts. Enjoy the recipe!

I haven't made these, but in response to the review about the tarts falling appart: you're supposed make these tarts in mini aluminium pie shells! (reread the recipe: it says to use 'tart molds') Some restaurants also use paper muffin cups in muffin pans, which makes it easier to eat.

I am from Hong Kong, and these egg tarts do remind me of those in Hong Kong! The filing was good but I didn't like the crust. I recommend making the crust by using the recipe of kukadog's lemon pie bars. I used skim milk instead since I didn't have evaporated milk. I also reduced the amount of sugar and the oven's temperature to 350. Will definitely make it again!

Hi! I'm 11 and I made this. It is GREAT! I actually only made the filling; My crust was store-bought. The color was a teensy bit light, but the taste and texture was great. At first, I thought there had been like a typo-9 eggs??? But it was good! :D My mom's students loved these. Right before baking, I like to put some blueberries and/or raisins inside. I will probably make this again!!!!

The dough was too dry for me.. It was hard to shape them as they were crumbling and falling apart. The custard could be a little sweeter, add more if you are using brown sugar.

Love these!  Very close to the "dan tat's" sold at the chinese bakeries and it reminds me of when I was little and my parents would come home with them!!  The house smells wonderful while they're baking.  I used 7 eggs and the only sugar I had in the house was organic cane sugar, they still turned out great!  Temperature wise, I baked them at 400 degrees for about 14 min and then lowered to 350 degrees for another 10.

A nice recipe, but as other discovered, there was much more custard filling than tart dough (about twice as much). On the other hand, I think my tart dough that I used in the regular sized muffin pan (12 tarts in all) had dough that was too thick. The ones I made in  the mini-muffin pan were much better. If i had stretched out the dough a bit more, I probably could have made more tarts.   I initially started with a mini-muffin tin that made 12, and these came out well. My oven finished these in about 12 minutes, and they came out pretty much as described (the filling puffs up a bit). My second batch was a bigger mini-muffin tin that made 24, so it took closer to 16 minutes to make, but these ended up being nicer. At this point, I ran out of dough, but had plenty of filling, so I made another batch of dough as described and pressed them into the regular sized muffin tin that makes 12. With the thicker dough and deeper fillings, the tart took much longer to cook, but the crust started to brown before the filling was ready. In my case I ended up baking them for 22 minutes, but near the end I started turning the temp down to avoid burning the crust. In the future, I'll have to thin out the dough and reduce the temp, while cooking a bit longer to make sure these come out as nicely as I like them.   I started with cutting the butter into the sugar-flour mixture, but ended up using my hands, which were much better at making the small crumbs described. All in all, tasty recipe.

The custard filling had little to no egg taste in it. Im guessing there was too much water. Did not taste like HK style egg tarts. There was also too much filling. Made a larger egg tart with an additional one third of the dough mixture. Substituted the egg potion with 1/3 of the filling. Crust turned out good.

This took a lot longer to make than expected. I made about 3 dozen mini egg tarts. I followed everything in the recipe except instead of baking at 450 degrees (which I gathered from previous reviews burnt the tarts), I baked different batches in varying temps starting with 375 (too low) and then settling with baking at 425 for the first 10 minutes and then lowering to 375 for 5 minutes and then turning it off and letting the egg custard rest in the oven for another 5 minutes. The crust doesn't have that flaky quality as in Chinatown or Hong Kong style tarts so I was disappointed. The egg custard wasn't bad though.

Temperature was way too high because my tart shells burned before the filling was puffed up. I do agree with others that the crust is a bit off in taste/texture, but still very good. The filling is spot on in flavor and texture. We did reduce the recipe by 1/3 for the filling because other comments saying there was more filling than crust. We were able to make 20. Making the tart shells does take some time, I will try this recipe again with pre-made tart shells.

I live in Australia and tasted a Hong Kong Egg Tart last week while stopping over in Sinapore.  I loved it so much that tonight I decided to make my own for a dinner party simple desert.  They turned out really well and everyone loved them.  I did reduce the sugar a little in both the filling and the base which was still pretty sweet but delicious.  Plus we have about 13 left over to take to work tomorrow.

I took the previous reviews seriously when using this recipe. Here is what I did, and how it turned out:
-I made the full amount of dough.  Yes it was very much like a sugar cookie, but my guests and I liked it
-I halved the filling, and it was the perfect amount for the dough.
-I made enough tarts for 12 regular muffin tins and 1 small/medium  ramekin
-I used 2% evaporated milk
-The tarts needed more than 20 minutes (possibly because I used deeper muffin tins) but the crust was getting dark, so I lowered the temp to 350 and covered them.  I left them in for 10 more minutes.  Some of the filling still seemed a bit liquidy but I took them out anyway.
-Even after an overnight in the fridge, most of the tarts had about a teaspoon full of liquid on top, but it didn't matter at all.
-I served these to 4 other women and three of them went for seconds!

i'm so glad i stumbled upon this recipe!  egg tarts are one of my favorite dishes of dim sum and now i can make them at home!  i didnt have tart pans so i put the dough into a cupcake tin.  it worked well except i made the crust too thick so there was too much of the crust and not enough eggy goodness.  can't wait to make these again.

Tastes very authentic! - at least for the filling. I made this twice and both times the pastry turned out very hard (I dropped one on the floor by accident and it didn't even CRACK). I noticed that it baked faster than the filling - which made it difficult to gauge time. The first time I actually burned the pastry...in comparison to the other reviews, I feel like I might have made a mistake, but I followed the instructions as faithfully as possible. Maybe I'll try using premade tart shells C:

The recipe as a whole doesn't get too many stars.  I would give the "tart" part 5 stars, but the "egg" part only got 1, resulting in an average of 3.  I used the traditional egg tart molds and there is 1/4 to a 1/3 leftover of both the egg mixture and the dough.  I baked it at 450 degrees for 10, then 3, then 2, then 3 minutes.  It turned out WAY too burnt, but the egg was still semi-liquidy.  I then turned off the oven and let the residual heat bake the egg.  Baking the egg at the high heat created a quiche-like layer at the top of the egg tart.  The egg part was a little too dense, more like the egg in an American egg pie.  The tart, however, was what I LOVED!!  Although baking it in the high temperature caused it to burn, but i could tell that it would've been delicious if it weren't burnt.  I've tried another recipe where the egg was delicious, but the tart was bland.  I will try using this tart and that egg next time.  That baking part of that recipe also suggested to bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes, then reduce temperature to 250 degrees for another 10 minutes.  The first part is to cook the tart, and the last part is the cook the eggs without burning the tart.

I looked for another egg tart recipe after my previous attempt came out with a rather unpastry-like crust. This one came out better, but unfortunately the temperature was far too high and the egg custard was cooked too much. It came out rather tough and not the jelly-like texture it was supposed to have. Also, several crusts burned, but that may have been due to the fan bake mode I was using on my oven. I'll have to experiment a bit more with this recipe. For all those looking to try it, you might want to lower the temp a little.

I used a muffin tin to do it and I halved the recipe.  I baked it for around 18 minutes.  The filling initially rose but eventually collapsed.  I also added in some milk for the crust, it was just too crumbly.  The filling has a strong egg taste and not sweet enough (I was eating a store bought one to compare) The next time I'll make it I'll add in more sugar for the custard and one less egg.  But definitely better than some other recipe that I tried.

Our egg tarts did not come out very well - heavy crust, thick filling and very sweet.   The kitchen smelled great though! Try using a rolling pin to roll out the dough and use a mug to cut out and then put in the molds (from another recipe) for an even crust.  Some of the filling over flowed and made cleaning difficult.

My mom and I tried this yesterday, and we thought the filling looked very watery, but it turned out great! other than the fact that we were short on the dough and used a dish to make a very large egg tart.

These were pretty good, and easy to make.  I cheated a little and used a glass to make round crusts from a pre-made pie crust.  Warning though, I made 36 egg tarts and threw away some of the egg filling, this recipe makes a lot!

I love this recipe.  This comes closest to the egg tarts that I buy in Chinatown, or Flushing, New York.  I shortened the time of the recipe by using Pillsbury Pie Crusts too.

Well, this is my first attempt in making a homemade dessert of sorts. As always, I misread the recipe and put a whole can of evaporated milk.  I also wasn't sure if I was supposed to melt the butter before I added it to the dough mixture or not, so I did part of it.  I also had the Philsboury premade dough too.   The homemade dough is kind of like the sandies shortbread cookie.  It's good on it's own (had a bit left over) and youc an tell which dough is which by the taste of it.  Somehow, the 12oz can of milk actually didn't make it the custard very sweet.  In fact, none of it is very sweet.  I'm  not sure what I did, but I like it very much.  I also lowered the temperature to 350F because I felt the inital temperature was too high.  I had to settle for muffin tins and ended up making 30 tart things.  All in all, I will be making this again and hopefully...I will read the directions right the first time around.

Very delicious!!! For a very authentic Chinese taste, I cut down the confectioners' sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup. I also cut down the white sugar just a tad. I also did not use canned evaporated, but skim milk for a more delicious and low-fat taste!

These tasted right, but I had a problem with the filling boiling over while baking.  It quickly burned on the baking sheet and set off my smoke detector.  Can anyone suggest a way to prevent the boiling over?  I would love to make this again, because what did come out tasted good.

I'm a novice cook, so maybe I did this recipe wrong (that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1).  But it turned out terrible for me.  The dough was hard and kept cracking.  I had to make the tart thicker so that it wouldn't fall apart.  But it did anyways during baking (what a mess!).  There was way too much egg mixture too.

I used top flour instead of all purpose for a finer texture to the crust. Also replaced and reduced the amount of white sugar with brown sugar (tasted less sweet) for both crust and filling. Baked my tarts at 200C for 20 minutes. Used whole milk instead of evaporated because we didn't quite like the taste and smell of evaporated. Turned out perfect!

It burnt the top of my tarts and would've burnt everything had I not cooled down the temperature immediately. Moreover, I used the frozen bought tart shells so I got twice as much as what the recipe was meant for. But the tart tasted amazing.

This was way yum. I totally cheated though, and just used the filling with canned croissants. Also subbed the evaporated milk for half&half which I had on hand.
The eggs were so fluffy and tasty- the hubs was def surprised by this treat.
Anyone using these subs, brush the pastry with the eggs to prevent top crust burning. (Perforations in croissant dough allow eggs to fall to bottom in cooking, crust rises to top like a strip of puff pastry) Cook exactly 15 min on 450, adjust for alt.

I should have read the reviews before attempting this. There was way too much egg custard left over and the 450 was too high. The crust came out a bit dry and hard. However, the taste is just right. I will retry this again and maybe post an updated review. Next time, I would half the filling recipe and lower the oven temperature.

Tried these in my bakery and they were so good that I had to take it a step further! I put a whole pecan in the bottom of each tart and then added a tsp of maple extract to the mix before pouring into the tarts...Oh My! :)

Excellent recipe. Word of advice, if the egg part is still runny, but the cookie outside is done, take it out. The egg will become more solid when it cools or else it won't be as silky.

I wished I read the other reviews b4 I started on this recipe. The quantity for the egg custard is really too much for a dozen tarts, I could have made easily another 7 or 8 tarts with the leftover custard mix.

Do half the quantity for the egg custard if you don't wanna waste the eggs!

I used soy milk instead of evaporated milk.
I added a touch of yellow food coloring to make the custard a deeper shade of yellow.

The tarts came out great and I love the texture of the custard, just nice! The tart case texture is not as soft as I thought, it's a little on the crispy side but still tasted great!

This recipe was really straight forward however I altered the recipe abit and used  1/2 the amount of sugar and confectioners sugar. Also I used 5 eggs instead of 9 and my dad thought the egg tarts were good but still slightly sweet even after altering it :) Luckily it wasn't so bad however I think the temperature was still too high but I guess that depends on your own oven. I put mine to 180 instead and half way through I had to turn my tray I used. However, this was probably since I used a muffic tray instead of a proper shell things. but they still turned out well overall :)

It's really easy to make and I thought it wasn't bad.
 For the crust, everyone needs to alternate things to their own taste. What I did to achieve the PERFECT dough was to add more water to make the dough firmer. I then adjusted it to my taste and texture. I haven't done the custard yet, due to lack of eggs. (Hehe) However, I'm going to try following everyone's suggestion and halve the custard recipe. I'll also pretty up the tart texture and use a fork the design it. :) Overall, I'm pretty excited though because I tried a new recipe for these yummy HK egg tarts!

perfect. i baked the tarts in pie pans, after a hankering for egg pie. found that making a wash over the edge of the crust made it nice and crunchy texture. hits the spot for a midnight snack :)

I made this for the first time today, and I must say that it turned out the way it did because of the help I got with the reviews. Because several of them noted that there would be too much leftover filling, I decided to make more of the crust. I ended up changing the serving size to 14 custard tarts instead of 12.. which ultimately yielded TWENTY FOUR. Instead of adding the recommended amount of sugar for 14 tarts, I ended up just adding 1 cup since I read that it was too sweet, anyway, for 12 tarts. With the filling, I added 1/2 cups of sugar, which turned out really well! I also turned the oven temperature down to 400F and set the timer for 25 minutes. I think I might try setting it higher (less than 450F, still) and bake it for less time. Overall, this is a great recipe.. but with a few tweaks. :)

This recipe was okay.  I found it very time consuming to make the pastry shells.  I made them in muffin tins as suggested.  The taste was okay, but I won't be making this again.

its good but it doesnt taste the way the restaurants do w/ their flakey dough. make sure you dont put too much or too little dough, i accidentally made my first batch too thick. i found that the filling recipe made a lot more filling that i actually needed. i also tried the egg tarts II recipe and found that it tastes alike.

Four stars as it was way too "eggy'. I used eight eggs [heh] and it was too eggy. But once chilled, it is pretty good, but I'd still only use seven eggs

This recipe is excellent! It was my first time making egg tarts, and they turned out wonderfully =). I used 1/2 cup of sugar and unsalted butter for the crust as some other users had suggested, and it was the perfect level of sweetness/saltiness - although I'm sure that differs depending on taste. I also found that setting the oven to 180 degrees C (356 degrees F) was enough for both the crust and filling to cook properly. Thank you for such a lovely recipe!=)

This was delicious! I read the other ratings beforehand and many people agreed that the sugar should be cut down as it makes the crust to sweet.. I don't think this is neccessarily correct; it depends on your tastes for me I thought there was a perfect amount of sugar. It rlly was like eatting shortbread (:! I think this crust will be my shortbread recipe for nao on Haha ^-^ it quite delicious~ The only problem I encounterred was that the crust seemed to finish backing before the egg so I ended up with a few egg tarts that had brown, brunt crusts. Other than that this was rlly easy to put together! I'd also like to stay that when I read the other reviews I expected the egg tarts to taste like the bakery ones. The egg filling tastes a bit different, the egg flavour has been to diluted, in the future for the egg filling I would recommend using 12 egg yolks rather than 9 eggs, 1 1/2 cup of milk rather than 1 1/2 cups of water, and 3/4 cups of condensed milk rather than 1 cup of evaporated milk. I don't know why none of the other reviewers noticed the egg filling tasted different but my family sure did! Thanks for the recipe :) ; easy and delicious!

I used the muffin pan and it worked well. I can't leave it in for 15 minutes tho. Just 13 and the filling needs more sugar for sure. It's just what I'm used to after eating egg tarts from all over Chicago and LA.

Very tasty and easy to make! There was more crust than custard, though, so I suggest making the crust thinner and when you run out of egg mixture, make more of just the mixture to fill the extra shells.

This makes a LOT of tarts. I got 40 muffin-tin sized tarts. The filling was awesome - spot on - but the crust could be substituted with a different crust recipe or mayve a puff pastry shell. Don't skip the straining step. You could alternatively skim off the foam using a spoon. The taste of these gets better after they rest a while.

Tried this recipe yesterday and it tasted great! Just like the real thing back home!  Hubby and kids loved them!   I only used half the recipe and managed to baked 16 tarts on my muffin tray.   I replaced evaporated milk with full cream milk, yummie! :)

good stuff!! yeah, you kinda have to make double the batches of dough for all the filling if you're gonna use muffin tins like we did, and y'might wanna add a little more sugar into the filling, if you like sweeter egg tarts. the sweetness is there in the original, it's just very subtle. also, we put dashes of brown sugar on top of the mixture before we popped it into the oven like they do in the philippines, and it turned out great! thanks

We used prepared tart shells in the frozen section of the grocery store. we're just lazy. We used 8 eggs instead of 9 eggs for the filling. We also use 3/4 cups of sugar instead of the 2/3 cups of sugar asked in the recipe. The filling never browned, we took them out when the shells started browning. I think next time we'll use less eggs. When it's freshly warm from the oven, it's not very sweet...disappointing. But I put them in a fridge over night and warmed them in the microwave and it seemed sweet enough, but not too much. The fillings was a bit firmer than the ones i've had in Chinatown. Not the best egg tarts i've had and not at all close to Chinatown egg tarts.

The crust tasted nothing like the crust of an egg tart but was yummy nonetheless. I would have to say that while this recipe was okay tasting, it did not resemble my idea of a traditional egg tart.

Pretty good recipe!  I modded the crust recipe according to the reviews and used less icing sugar and used cake & pastry flour instead of all-purpose.  I liked that the crust was slightly sweet, almost like a soft cookie, and not typical of those from the bakery/dim sum restaurant.  
Also, 450F was too hot for these tarts, so I baked them at 425F for around 15 min.  I will definitely make these egg tarts again!

These taste similar but not quite exactly like the ones you buy at the asian store. After reading several reviews I cut back on the sugar for the dough and it turned out good.  Not as flaky as the ones from the store but still good. I didn't have any evaporated milk on hand so substituted whole milk instead.  The custard still turned out tasty.  Very light and not dense.  Cooked it 3 different temps: 1st one at 400 for 13min, 2nd at 375 for 20min and 4th at 400 for 13 min but on a lower rack.  They all turned out basically the same.  will make again.

The custard came out perfect.  Tasted exactly like the ones you buy in Chinatown.  Although, the crust wasn't flaky and came out more like a cookie...it was still delicious.

I made this today and I think I added too much evaporated milk because the custard didn't taste very eggy at all. I'll try reducing the milk next time. The crust however was perfect! Although I made it too thick and like another reviewer said, if my crusts were thinner, it would've burned in the high heat. There were too much custard filling as well! I'm going to have to make more crust to use up the rest.

My boyfriend is from Taiwan and came across this recipe for me to make him :).  I did and he absolutely loves them!  The dough is great, the filling is good, and together they are fabulous!  I also had too much egg mixture for the shells, but my mom loves them with more of the custard.  I made six in 3.5" tart shells and one 9" pie and it turned out great.   This is a great recipe to keep on hand.

It tasted really good! I was impressed. I had to add more butter than the recipe said. I used cupcake pans because I didnâ€™t have a mold. I had a lot more filling left over probably because I used cupcake pans instead of the mold. I couldâ€™ve halved my recipe for the filling.

Super easy recipe to follow that produces yummy egg tarts! I thought the crust was a bit sweet the first time I made it so I added slightly less powdered sugar and a pinch of saltâ€”it made a world of difference!

I made this recipe in the form of a pie instead of individual tarts. I divided all the ingredients in half which was the perfect amount for my nine inch pan. After putting it in the oven at 450 degrees for 10-15mins, I noticed the crust was cooking much faster than the custard inside, so I lowered the temperature to 350 degrees and cooked it for an additional 20mins. The taste and consistency was just like the ones Iâ€™ve had from Chinatown. Be sure to strain the eggs to avoid any lumps.

As others have said, you want to cut back by like 25% on the quantity of filling. The obvious error in this recipe is the 1 cup of sugar in the crust, almost certain they meant tbsp there. Even half a cup and you have yourself a sugar cookie

People were impressed that i was able make this! Looks great and very easy to make, i cut the recipe in half as i didnt want to make a lot the first time. Also i used muffin pan instead of the tart tins, it may be beacuse of the size i was still able to make a dozen still with half the ingredients. The crust came out great but the filling we feel could be a bit sweeter, so probablynin the enxt try ill b adding more sugar maybe, but overall great recipe to try!

The egg filling is perfect. I use this recipe for filling whenever I make egg tarts. But the shortcuts pastry has too much dough to butter ratio. If anyone had a hard dough, try again with only 2 cups of flour. And a little less sugar.

Following the comments from others, I made some changes and they turned out delicious!! I ended up making 23 tarts after increasing the flour amount by 1.5 times. If you want less, just halve the filling recipe. I also used So Delicious coconut milk instead of evaporated milk, they have about the same amount of fat content, so it turned out fine.           

1. Reduced sugar by 10% for both dough and filling. 20% reduction is possible.       
2. Make the water/sugar mixture for the filling first. It takes a while to cool down to room temp. Make the dough, while the water/sugar solution is cooling.       
3. Use cake flour instead of all purpose.       
4. Form the dough with a pastry cutter. After dough looks raggedy, use hands to press everything together. Lightly knead, just to combine and hydrate the flour.        
5. Roll out dough until 1/8 inch thick with a rolling pin. Use a overturned small rice bowl to make indentations, then cut four little triangles out around each circle, so that there would be no overlap of dough when placing it in the muffin pan. Press dough into the muffin pan using scraps to cover any holes. Ensure an even layer.       
6. Cover with saran wrap and refrigerate muffin pan with dough pressed in.       
7. While the shells are cooling, make the custard. Preheat oven to 400F.       
8. Use a small soup ladle to spoon in the custard into the shells.        
9. Bake at in a preheated oven at 400F for 30-35 minutes, or until the egg part is puffed.

This is a very time consuming recipe and hard to follow, but the end product is pretty good. This was my first time making dan ta and I was pretty happy with it. I decided to make mine in a mini muffin tin because I wanted a smaller tart, so I reduced the baking time to about 15-17 minutes and I also turned the  temperature down to 400 degrees F. I also reduced the sugar in the crust based on other reviews and it was still pretty sweet at 3/4 of a cup. I made sure to grease the oven tin because I cooked mine without muffin cups. Also, I ended up with about 2 1/2 cups leftover custard filling and had to make more dough, with half proportions. Hope this was helpful!!

I followed the directions and it came out over done. I even lowered the temperature from 450 to 400 and took it out a few minutes early. I'll have to try it again with an even lower tempurature to see what actually works. The top has become all crusty and dried and the crust rim has burnt.

And a lot of other reviews had mentioned that you end up with leftover batter. I used frozen tarts. A package had 30 shells and I still had left over batter for maybe another 5 tarts.

The taste is alright. Not too sweet, which is how most asian desserts are. Next time, I will try it with a few less egg whites and see what happens. It does come out a rather pale yellow.

it's super tasty and easy. 
but I think there's something wrong with the recipe. i follow the recipe thoroughly and precisely, which said for 12 servings only. I'm not kidding, I made 128 egg tarts. and the filling is still left. 128 egg tarts, I'm not kidding.

Really yummy! I tried both with silicone muffin baking cups and aluminum baking cups. The muffin cups resulted in slightly burnt shell at the edges, but the aluminum cups came out perfect. 
I substituted the water and evaporated milk with full cream milk, and reduced sugar in dough to 4 tea spoons and in filling to 100 g. 
The dough/filling ratio was s just nice for me. Probably because I made the shell quite thin  (using a tortilla press)-- about 2mm. I think if you roll out the shell in between two sheets of baking paper it should work too.

I used frozen tart shells dipped instead of the dough. And yes the custard is enough for at least 2 dozen tarts.

I wanted to try these egg tarts but didnt want to make that many tarts, so I only made 4. I prefer my dough like puff pastry so I used store bought pastry, it makes the recipe really easy and tasty!! Just cut it in the shape you want it to be and press it into the baking thing.

I used 2 large eggs, 3 tablespoons of regular full fat milk, 1/4 cup of water, 1.5 tablespoons of sugar and a splash of vanilla extract for the custard. I think the custard was fine, but it didnt turn out wobbly like I expected. Next time I will try to use the evaporated milk, maybe that will change things. I dont like them too sweet, but next time id also use 2 tablespoons of sugar.

I put it in the oven for 15 minutes on 200C.

The temperature is too high...I change it to 190Â°c for my gas oven. The custard and dough is excellent! I cut down the confectionery sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup. Over all, Taste nice and delicious!

This recipe is great, egg tarts came out delicious, but it does need some adjustments. 

Like many other reviewers, the recipe gave me too much filling for the dough, so I decreased the ingredients for the filling. Yes, the crust came out tasting like a sugar cookie (not so much like a flaky pastry), which I liked, so I was quite happy with it. 

I also had lowered the oven temperature slightly (440 rather than 450) because at 450 the crust started to burn before the filling was fully cooked.  Also, in order to prevent burning, I cooked the tarts uncovered for 6 minutes at 440, then placed a piece of aluminum foil on top of them, and cooked for an additional 10-14 minutes (Sometimes I just had to add small increments and watch to see if it was cooked or not).  

Also according to the recipe listed, the dough came out very dry and brittle. I had to add a lot of additional butter, and added some milk. After adding milk it became a lot stickier and easier to shape into the tins.

I'm Chinese.  Now while it was good, it's not as rich as what we're used to from the Chinese bakeries.  I have other recipes which are richer and more authentic which calls for extra yolks and that makes the difference.  I decided to try this recipe anyway since with the other recipes, I always end up throwing away the whites (despite plans to make meringues or whatever with them) and decided to give this a try. While the family liked it as a custard pie, it doesn't really quite qualify as a Chinese "don tot" recipe.  After reading other reviews that the filling and crust are too sweet, I decreased the sugar to 1/2 c, and used a ready-made flaky crust.  It was just sweet enough - although may not be sweet enough for others as I always try to make recipes healthier e.g., by reducing sugar and replacing oil with apple sauce, so we don't like very sweet desserts.  I also made it into one large pie instead of small tarts.  The temperature was too high, and was burning the crust and top, so I lowered it to 350 F / 175 C (convection oven). This photo is of the tart made on a whim so would've presented it better had we had guests :-).

can't believe this got so many good reviews, the instructions are very hard to follow as it doesn't say how many egg to add in which of the egg adding steps, similar with the vanilla but that had less of an impact.

Just made these for Chinese New Years dinner with my family.  This was our first attempt making these and everyone approved - even Grandma!  

My suggestion would be to roll out the dough.  We did just as the recipe and if the dough is too thick it's not as good.  And this makes way more than 12 FYI!!  I also prefer the filling to be a slight bit sweeter so I'll be adding more evaporated milk next time around.  

(we are Chinese by the way if that helps solidify my review!)

The egg tarts turned out really good, we had way too much custard though, we had to make more dough for the crust about 3 more times.  My friend and I originally wanted to make 24 egg tarts and we changed the servings from 12 to 24 but for some reason we had way too many, we ended up making about 80+ but it's also because we had small egg tarts so just be careful when you're adjusting the servings.  For smaller ones you can bake them for about 11 min so they don't burn, overall they turned out great, next time I'll try and make the crust thinner and have more custard.

First, the sugar is way too low. Second, the proportion is for way more than 12, maybe 24 or more. Third, the temperature is a bit high.*I did not use the recipe for the crust, only the filling. Maybe the crust is good..

Proportions are all wrong. I had so much left over batter for filling. I used 9 eggs for that, which I had to later just dump in the sink since I didn't need it anymore! Very disappointed. The only thing that is redeemable is that the ones I were able to make were okay. Crust is definitely not as it should be. Overall.. go find a different recipe that doesn't waste your ingredients.

First time I made it, I received a compliment from friends, all too familiar with superb foods in Hong Kong and Taiwan. They said it was by far the best egg tart they've eaten anywhere! I was flattered!! I, however, modified the recipe some (more because I was short on some items). 
I used about 7 eggs (v. 9 eggs), added ~5tbsp more water into the sugar-water syrup.. Prior to filling the designing the edges of the crust, I put them into the cooler to keep the dough firm and easier to work with (I made it in the heat/humidity of mid-summer). I think I decreased the temperature some to 440 (v. 450) and let it bake for 15 - 20min. I say watch your egg tarts and be careful to not let it overcook. If the center egg portion is firm when you pull it out, it will taste a little over-eggy. If it is barely jiggly, I think that's ideal. 

The second time I made this recipe (1 year after my first time!), I forgot I did not have evaporated milk so I used dehydrated milk powder -- Bad Idea. I did not modify the egg and water amount so this produced over-firm egg tarts. It was definitely edible (and perhaps enjoyable in its own way) but not worthy of more compliment than "Ya, it's good." 

** Other reviews said the egg mix is more than what you need, and they are Correct.. ~4 medium-sized egg tarts more. I forgot to experiment reducing the amount this time, but I suggest you keep that in mind (: If you'd rather have more than not enough, you are golden.. no worries! Overall, Great Recipe!!

Made this today and it was delicious! I made a few minor changes to the recipe though.

- I substituted the evaporated milk with Lactaid Reduced Fat 2% milk.
- Cut the recipe in half to make 6 instead of 12 but there were still way too much dough and filling left. I wrapped everything up and left it in the fridge.
- I used a muffin pan instead of tart molds.
- Started at 400 degrees cause 450 was too hot and would burn the crust in no time then reduced to 350. It took about 25 mins to finish cooking these.
- Also when I cut the tart in half, only the top was yellow but the bottom was white. It was kind of cool looking actually!

For the dough: I used 3 sticks of butter and only 3/4 cup of confectioners sugar for the dough....still did not come out flakey enough for my taste.  I should have used the original 1 cup of confectioners sugar because 3/4 was seemed bland.  For the custard: i followed another reviewers advice and I used 6 whole eggs plus 3 yolks....seemed to not be too eggy like others complained of.  I would love to try with store bought pastry dough and see if that makes a difference.  It was very difficult to form the dough to the muffin pan ( I used paper liners too).

The dough is goood but it actually makes more than twenty portions!! And to the custard, I used low fat milk instead of evaporated milk, it works.... And I didn't melt the sugar before making the custard, I just blended all ingredients with my blender. But if you choose to do so, once u finish blending, remember to remove the bubbles that forms, like a white foam. That will keep the custard nice and yellow.... But over all the recipe tastes great, and it's not too sweet. And I even put a little less than a cup of sugar in the custard and dough recipes.... That you can adjust to your taste....

I used frozen puff pastry instead because I like flaky pastry rather than flat tart shells. Plus, it takes much less time. I halved the recipe and made 8 tarts. Next time I would add more sugar or even honey since the puff pastry is not sweet. My friend said the tarts are more like Portuguese style you normally find in Macau. I don't really care. They are yummy anyway!

I only made the filling from this recipe (hence the four stars) and decided to go with frozen puff pastry for the shell, but the filling was perfect.  It tasted just like the ones from the bakery.  The recipe called for 9 eggs, but I only used 8 since one reviewer said they were too egg-y, but I could have gone with 9... Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Delicious treats.  Very easy to make.  I always end up with leftover egg filling mixture.  I guess a lot depends on the type and size of tart molds you use and also desired thickness of crust.

make the crust thin, it bakes and tastes better. also, i suggest cutting the recipe for the egg custard in half, the recipe asks for way too many eggs. other than that, its mighty fun to make and to eat. :P

This amount does make a lot of egg tarts. So the first time I made a lot of them. And I used too much dough per tart which resulted into a very thick dough. (I didn't have that many cups and didn't want to waste the dough, my fault, hehe) The second time I tried this recipe it was much better. (I toke half the amount of the recipe) Comparable to the real egg tart you buy in HK. (My bro says the most important difference is the environment, he likes the shops in HK where you can buy fresh ones just coming of the big plate, and where you can see the people working hard. PS: They actually have two egg tart styles, one with "cookie dough" and the other with puff pastry. As I am a fan of the cookie dough I am very happy with this recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us!

This recipe is always a big hit at the parties. I always use mini-muffin tins- this way I can make more, and everybody can have a couple bites! I lowered the temperature to 400 F and didn't heat the sugar and water. It tasted the same, if not better. Also, I used half and half the first time. I loved it, and when I used evaporated milk the second time, it just didn't taste as good. This is definitely one of my favorite recipes!

These tasted great, but similar to other reviewers, I definitely had too much egg custard filling leftover in the end. Also, I found it hard to make the crust thin enough and look pretty/uniform. Next time I make it, I will definitely use a rolling pin to make the crust thinner (instead of forming the crust with my fingers as I did this first time).

Like the other review I've read the wrong amount for the evaporated canned milk, I added the entire can instead of only one cup. This was a bit tricky of how it was worded, but the egg tart still came out good. Overall, it tasted good. The shell was kind of time consuming and messy to make. It was hard to make it look pretty and even. I will try store bought philo dough next time. As for the egg custard it was tasty, I've substitute 4 whole eggs with 6 egg yolks instead to give it a more golden yellow custard color. Will definitely make again.

Very authentic to what you would get at a Chinese bakery. The flavor of the custard was right on. I didn't have a strainer but the texture was perfect. As per other's suggestions I didn't as much sugar. It turned out very well, I'm very pleased :) and I had people asking me for the recipe! It made my Chinese New Year feast extra spectacular. Thank you!

My first attempt at making my own Egg Tarts. I read the reviews about more filling than the dough for the crust so I halved the filling. But guess what, I ended up with too much dough for the crust. I made 12 tarts using a muffin pan, using up all the filling but had dough left over. I agree that 425 degrees is too high a temperature so I baked it at 375 degrees instead. Perfect! Jello-like custard filling with a crust that's not too sweet. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe was perfect for me.  I substituted shortening for butter and used aluminum papered muffin cups.  There was a lot of dough, but I used it all any way.  The result is that at 450, it browns perfectly after 20 min. for a flaky crust. If you use less dough or make the shell thinner, I suspect the crust will be too brown.  There is also too much filling.  I only needed a little more than half of what the recipe calls for.

Not sweet enough! I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar. However, the texture is absolutely great, and authentically Hong Kong style.

To get 12 tarts I used 2 large muffin pans lined with aluminum foil baking cups (left the paper liner in too). The dough fit perfectly to mold to the cups, but not enough to allow me to form a circular crust on top like the picture has. End result, superly loaded egg filling and minimal crust (which I looove!) 
  If you're looking for puff pastry crust, this is not the recipe to get it. But it's a nice variation on the traditional flaky crust.
   I think 425 is too high of a temperature. I lowered mine to 400 after about 10 minutes. Then shut off the oven after 20 minutes and left them in there for another 20 minutes. Was I supposed to take it out when the center still jiggles?
   Egg filling was a bit denser than I expected (like another reviewer, I was looking for more of a flan consistency), though still great overall. Thanks Wildcat~
