A few things to note:  1. Traditional (and in my opinion, more flavorful) daal is made with chhana daal, this can be found in the ethnic section. 2. cherry tomatoes are never used in bengali cooking, I recommend 1 small tomato, diced. 3. I recommend using 1 large onion in the whole dish, 3/4 in the lentils and the remainder when frying up at the end. 4. The heat level for this dish is not high with serrano peppers. I would recommend using the small hot peppers found at an Indian store. 5. 1/2 tsp of turmeric is very mild to me. I would use 1-2 tsp myself, as it's very healthy for you and doesn't have a strong flavor.

This is delicious!  I had never cooked anything Indian before and was a little skeptical but it turned out great.  Advice to others...do not buy the turmeric from the spice aisle like I almost did.  Buy it from the Oriental food section.  The difference?  One 3 oz. bottle for $9 or one 14oz. bag for $3.

This was really easy to throw together. I made it on a whim and I had all of the ingredients at home already. It seems like quite a simple dish, but the caramelized onions and fresh coriander really give the dish something extra so don't leave those out! I will probably double the caramelized onions next time. I increased the turmeric, as per another reviewer's suggestion. And... I had to use up some butternut squash in the fridge, so I grated about a cup of that and threw it into the pot with the tomatoes. I don't think it really affected the flavour or texture of the dish at all. Not 'authentic,' I know, but it DID make this dish even healthier. I still prefer spicier curries to dhal, but this recipe is still a keeper due to it's simplicity. Thanks for sharing!

The real thing is great (but no tomatoes) but here is my non-authentic shortcut for this dish.  Pour a can of lentils, liquid & all into a saucepan and warm gently. Fry 1 cup chopped onions in a little veg oil and add to lentils. Sprinkly 1 tablespoon (more or less) curry powder on top and stir. Add salt & pepper to taste. With a hand- blender mix until smooth and pour over cooked rice - real comfort nursery food!  Reminds me of my childhood in India

It had beautiful color and a wonderful smell.  For some reason there was a bit too much bitterness.  I'm not sure if it was the turmeric or what, but it was in every bite and I couldn't shake it!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this for dinner tonight. I misread the instructions and put the garlic in the fry pan at the same time as the onion. Still had a nice flavor, after I scooped out the burnt garlic. ?? The dish is so flavorful and easy to make. I actually had everything in my kitchen for the meal tonight! I served it over rice and alongside tandoori chicken- Yum!

Not as flavorful as I had hoped, even though I used extra Tumeric and bay leaves. I want to try again but with more Serrano chilis,  I was expecting a little more spice. Still a good, easy recipe and I loved the garlic taste.

I used canned cubed tomatoes. It was very good but I let it cook maybe 1 hr. The lentils have to be very cooked. Served it with rice and coconut curry chicken. Heaven

This needed a healthy dose of salt, but the flavors were actually quite nice.

Good recipe! I think it needed more salt but other than that it was delicious.

I really loved the flavor of this Dhal. I added a bit more garlic (2 cloves), 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp ground coriander seeds, in addition to the fresh. We enjoyed this.
