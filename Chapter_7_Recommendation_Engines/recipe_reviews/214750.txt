I made my own almond meal using raw almonds and coarse polenta instead of fine cornmeal, but otherwise followed the cake recipe exactly, and baked it in a 10" springform pan. The result was a deliciously rich, gluten-free cake with a heavy crumb. A few sprigs of rosemary tossed into the lemon syrup as it simmered (and then strained out) added a little extra dimension.   I'll definitely make this again soon, but with just a tad less butter (some melted through the springform). The cake could easily serve 12 and would be fabulous paired with some ricotta and berries, or perhaps Greek yogurt and apricots.

Great recipe, great cake! It is super simple to make and delicious to eat. Instead of 8 servings, I followed the recipe for 2 servings baked in an 8" round pan. This amount will easily serve 6 people. The flavour of the cake is actually quite delicate with no hint of a cornbread taste. The lemon glaze gives it a gooey texture and the almond meal accents that. I kept mine in the fridge and served cool with warm toasted almond shavings on top. A nice, light cake that just happens to be gluten free, can't beat that! Thank you for the recipe.

It came out great. Used meyer lemons and 3.5 stick of butter since other reviewers said 4 was too much. I would use 3 sticks next time because some of the butter seeped out of the bottom of my springform pan.

I made this and we enjoyed it. For next time, I wonder the quantity of squeezed lemon juice (rather than "6 lemons", since lemons are a variety of sizes.) Will also try it again with less butter. I agree the name is deceptive... "polenta" is not "cornmeal."

This cake was delicious!  I made half the recipe in an 8x8 pan and it turned out great. Fantastic lemon flavor and the almond meal and cornmeal gave it a very interesting texture.

I made it for a concert picnic.  In my haste to get out the door, grabbed the cake from the oven and forgot the syrup.  It was still SOOOO delish and a hit with our crowd.  Served with slightly sweetened sour cream and berries.

USE THE SPRING FORM PAN! And do not cook for 2 hours, too long! It was good, perfect for my daughter who needs gluten free and I grabbed a quick taste before I dropped it off, but I was not happy when it was all over the bottom of my oven and I had to switch pans 20 mins into It! Lesson learned. Always read the Reviews!!!
