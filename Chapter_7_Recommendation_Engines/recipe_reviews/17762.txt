Excellent recipe. I like to cook it in my slow cooker. It is great to take to pot luck meals. You can use pretty much any kind of canned beans you like, too (I'm not real fond of limas).

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. My boyfriend and the boys at work (it made heaps of leftovers!) really liked it but I had to make A LOT of changes. 
I added just 2 tablespoons of ketchup and a sprinkling of brown sugar as they are both very sweet. The sauce in the can of baked beans is also sweet so you can imagine how sickly it tasted. I then added some garlic, tomato paste. tobascco sauce, chili powder & thyme which took some of the sweetness away. It sure did need all this extra flavour. I also just let it simmer on the stove top rather than finish it off in the over. With these changes it makes nice Sunday 'mince on toast' but that's about it.

Make these even better by adding a ring of klielbasa, sliced, and a splash of dry white wine.  Why?  I don't know, just because I had some.  We call these "hillbilly beans" and when we all get together I'm asked to make these.  By the way, throw them in the crockpot for a few hours instead of heating up the kitchen.

I have made this several times since 
I first had the dish at a picnic. These are so much better than plain old baked beans! When I make them, there are never leftovers. The only difference that I make is that I use sausage, hame, ground beefm and bacon! 
Very hearty!!\

We really enjoyed these beans. They were a little on the sweet side for my taste so next time I will cut back on the brown sugar to maybe 1/4 cup. My family had no complaints though!

I doubled the meats etc. and used 6 cans of beans including baked, lima, black, butter beans, red beans and white beans.   I also through in some Worcestershire sauce.  Amazing.

This is a great recipe love the different textures. The second time I made it I substituted a 1/4 cup of ketchup for 1/4 cup of sweet baby ray's bbq. This gave them a great flavor.

In my recipe bok these are named "baked beans for people who don't like baked beans"  They're fantastic!  You can add any other type of beans too to make it go a bit further or substitute also.  Just make sure you drain and rinse all other types of beans except the baked beans.  Never thought I'd EVER like baked beans but I was wrong!

Great recipe. I did hold off on adding the cooked bacon until closer to the end so it holds its shape better and substituted the brown sugar with an equivalent. Still works well.

My husband and 5 yr old liked it. My 3 yr old took one look and decided he'd skip lunch. I thought it was ok but a bit too sweet.
