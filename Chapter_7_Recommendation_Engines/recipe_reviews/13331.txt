I just finished making this recipe and it is very good. I didn't have any spicy chili beans on hand only mild ones so I used them and it really does need the "kick" of the spicy beans. I added some cumin to give it a little extra flavor. I think also next time I might add a half of a can more of the sloppy joe mix so it won't be so thick. This recipe is easy and is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

I made this recipe substituting ground turkey. Super fast super easy recipe when you don't want to wait for a slow-cooked chili. I added cumin chili powder and some ground pepper to taste to kick up the spiciness and served it over some egg noodles. Yum! My whole family enjoyed it!

This was tastier than it looked! I had to use frozen corn and fresh mushrooms since we don't buy canned veggies but it was great. I added onion powder cumin and chili powder to my hamburger while cooking. I also added some Velveeta cheese at the end- it was delicious!

Yummy perfect with corn bread. The only thing I did different was add half a chopped onion and I use Manwich Bold sauce. Very easy to throw together in a hurry and you can't really mess it up.

This is pretty good. Not spectacular but definitely works in a pinch. I had a can of sloppy joe sauce that i didn't know what to do with and this recipe worked perfectly. i just made it and it tasted pretty good so I'm sure tomorrow it will taste even better as leftovers!
