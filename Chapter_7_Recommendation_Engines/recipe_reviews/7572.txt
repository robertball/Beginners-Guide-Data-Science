I have made this cake 4 times now, and it has been consistently good.  I use it for fancier birthday cakes.

Good, basic cake recipe.  It turns out perfectly well if you follow the recipe as is.  The important thing to remember is that the flour must be measured after being sifted.  If not, you'll end up including too much flour.  The only thing I didn't like is that the flavor could be better.  At the moment, it's merely satisfactory.

This recipe was stellar. I baked a bridal shower cake for a friend and got so many compliments it was unreal. You have to give it a try!

This was a great recipe!  I used this to make a 9 in and 8 cupcakes.  The 9 in is for a Neapolitan cake for my daughters golden birthday.  The texture is wonderful, a little too sweet for me, but the girls all loved it! I did use almond instead of vanilla to keep it as white as possible.  Great recipe!!!

This is a wonderful vanilla cake. Tasty and not too heavy. It holds together really well and is great for decorating.  My young boys loved it too.
