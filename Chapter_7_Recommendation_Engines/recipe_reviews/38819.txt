After reading the other reviews I had low expectations but I was happily surprised when these turned out GREAT!  The texture was a little spongy, but the flavor was very nice.  I might add more lemon next time but they were still really tasty.  I will definitely make these again!

These muffins were super easy and they turned out great.  I used lemon chiffon flavored yogurt instead of plain, and added some oats and almonds on top to make them pretty and crunchy.

We loved these muffins!  I took them to a ladies' function and everyone enjoyed them and was surprised that they were sugarfree.  Very moist and stayed that way for a couple of days (don't know past that, they were all eaten up). Extra yummy with a bit of real butter spread on them.

Very spongy and light, but the flavor isn't all that great. Definitely needs butter or some kind of spread to make it edible.

These aren't very flavorful but I loved how light and spongy they were. We were out of milk and my kids had requested "some kind of honey muffin". This recipe was just the ticket! The kids slathered them with butter & honey and ate 3 apiece.   :)

Very Good recipe! I like things that are light, not too sweet and with a kick of flavour, and these were perfect!

I used ww flour instead of the ww pastry flour, and a tiny bit of orange zest (didn't have a lemon) with my "fake lemon" juice.  The muffins are good, not too sweet.  I think it could use a bit more lemon flavor (probably from not using real lemon juice/zest).  My son thinks they could use some sugar.

They were not sweet enough or flavorful enough for me.

Great texture but no flavour. Used muffin liners and they stuck horribly. Won't try this recipe again

After reading others reviews I did add a bit more lemon juice and sugar, but we still thought these weren't very interesting.
