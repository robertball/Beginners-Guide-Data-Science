This is a delicious keeper. First time I made it exactly. The amount of stuffing was enormous, easily enough for 8 squash. I baked the extra in a casserole. Most of the cheese fell off the zucchini and burned on the pan. Second time I was in a hurry, so I sauteed the veggies, including the zucchini pulp, in all 4 Tbsp butter. Then I mixed the Parmesan cheese in with the stuffing ingredients. Turned out I was out of white wine, so I used white wine vinegar. Then I microwaved the stuffed zucchini for 4 minutes. The result was just as yummy as the original recipe. The vinegar added an interesting tang. Next time I may try it with balsamic vinegar.

Very tasty meal!  The recipe easily serves 4, this is a very filling meal.  Don't overload the parmesan, as it's a very strong cheese and will take away from the crab flavor.  I served this with a pino grigio wine and it was a huge hit!

This filling is excellent. I used it to stuff mushrooms. It makes a lot. I will definitely make this again in mushrooms, maybe the next cocktail party I have.

This was pretty good. I think cream cheese would have been better than mayo though.

The family loved this dish. Next time I will use a little less bread crumbs though.

Delish! Definitely a keeper. I added chopped zucchini flesh to the onions, garlic and pepper when frying.  Since some reviews mentioned that it was bland, I added old bay to the bread crumbs. Good company meal!

This was surprisingly delicious!  Changed the serving size to 1 and followed those measurements.  I didn't have breadcrumbs (trying to be low carb) so I used Almond Meal, I omitted the pepper because I don't really like them and I didn't have white wine so I didn't use any substitution, and I used Mozzarella since I didn't have Parmesan.  It would have probably been more flavorful had I used everything, but it was still delicious.

I used a 4.something can of fancy lump crab meat and I really liked it. I think this is something I'll make on a regular basis.

I have been making this for a couple of years. Fantastic recipe! I sometimes use frozen peas instead of the green peppers I also put a layer of cheese in the middle.

I was wondering if you could swap out the mayo and use cream cheese instead ? 
This sounds so could and can't wait to try. Thanks.

My family did not enjoy this.  Not sure how to improve it.  Better to make plain crab cakes with expensive crab.

Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. I did add a few ingredients, I added mushrooms to the onion and pepper mixture, also I followed other recommendations and creamed together mayo with some cream cheese. When it was all assembled, I topped it with BÃ©arnaise sauce,and just before I put it in the oven I sprinkled a mixture of mozzarella and white cheddar. I have made this recipe for two dinner parties, and everyone LOVED it. Great way to use up all the zucchini in the garden.

This was wonderful!! We actually didn't have any crab meat, but we did have fresh shrimp. We cut up the shrimp (raw) and threw it in the mix and baked it just the same and then broiled it at the very end to bubble and brown the cheese just a bit. It was awesome and filling. I can see why it would be so good with crab too. Plan on using it for our next dinner party. Used a Chardonnay for our wine. Oh yeah, instead of italian bread crumbs we used panko and italian seasoning (it's what we had on hand :) ). Lovely, balanced layer of flavors. You can really make this recipe to your taste without messing anything up. And it's pretty healthy (we left out the butter and used veggie oil for sauteing and didn't put any butter in the stuffing mix either. We did use the mayo though. We're French so mayo is a staple in our home anyway. I love recipes like this. They are very amenable to one's taste and diet concerns. Can't wait to see what other ways we can tweak it. Bravo!

A great dish.  Followed the recipe as is, this time around.  Would make a great appetizer,if you use smaller zucchini.
Will definitely make again.  Made a great deal of filling, enough to stuff a green pepper as a secondary dish for later.
