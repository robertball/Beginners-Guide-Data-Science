This is a great meatloaf as is. Thanks for sharing! I just don't understand why people "review" these recipes when they are actually reinventing their own. If they have a great recipe, why not just enter it for all to see! Some even cut out the meat!

This was absolutely delicious. I prepared the recipe exactly as noted. I feel that it is best to try it precisely as written before making judgments, substitutions, or adjusting to personal preferences. The ingredients are few, simple, and inexpensive. The flavors blend in beautifully together and complement each other quite nicely. I will make this again exactly the same way.

i was really surprised how well this turned out, i wasn't sure about putting this mixture over meatloaf but for the first time in a long time there was no meatloaf left over to throw out...i made the basic meatloaf recipe provided, with 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 cup of diced onion. for the pineapple mixture, i used 1/3 cup ketchup, a little less than 1/4 cup of brown sugar (not packing it) and 1/2 cup of DOLE crushed pineapple. beat it with a mixer..heated it in a stove and into the fridge for a few hours..poked some holes in the meat when i put it in the baking dish (so the mixture could run inside the meat)  i poured the mixture over the meat half way thru cooking (like the recipe says)and i'll never go back to my old meatloaf again. it was not too sweet at all...we had it a few hours ago... and we cant wait to have it again!!

Wow!  This is kind of a chinese take on meatloaf.  Very, very good. But, I added a packet of Onion soup mix to the meatloaf, which I always do.  Also, couldn't find the pineapple perserves-do they exist?  I used Apricot jam and it was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!  I highly recommend this easy and yummy recipe. The meatloaf has a sweet flavor, which some might not like, but I couldn't stop eating it!!!  I would have rated it 6 stars!!

Super recipe!  I substitute crushed pineapple in place of preserves and that keeps it from being too sweet.  This is my new meatloaf recipe.  :-)

The sauce for this meatloaf is excellent... But the meat itself was lacking a little so I added onions and green peppers to it and it came out excellent...

This was very good. My boyfriend and I actually just got done eating, and I liked it so much I wanted to come on here and review it before I forgot! I made it a little differently on accident, just because I wasn't reading close enough, I ended up adding the ketchup to the meat and it was still really really good. I think i'll add it to the meat from now on actually. The topping was great too, I used crushed canned pineapple in it's own juice and that turned out fine. I'll make this again for sure. It was really quick to make also, no more than 10min prep really. This is also very flexable, so if you want to add or change ingrediants, it will still be very good.

My family found the topping to be far too sweet for their taste. My mother said, "It's not that it is a bad taste, just not a meatloaf taste. It's too sweet and gives it a weird flavor." My sister said it was good but extremely sweet. Nobody went for seconds and my father was at a meeting so I had a lot left over. Since the texture of the meat was very good, I tried to correct the problem. The next night, I rinsed the topping off the chilled leftovers. Made a standard topping (ketchup, brown sugar, Dale's marinade). I placed the loaves (I made individual meatloaves) in a dish with 1/8 cup of water (to prevent drying during reheating) and used the new topping. My family was very happy said that this time it was great.

Mmmmmm, everyone loved this meatloaf!  I also added some garlic powder and chopped onions to my meat mixture.  I made double the sauce mixture and poured half of it on the last 20 minutes of cooking.  I put the other half on the stove to get warm and then served it with the meatloaf.

This was fantastic!!! I was a little hesitant when I read the ingredients, but I tried it anyway and I'm so glad I did. Next time, I will season the meatloaf a bit more w/some onion and more garlic powder, but the sauce was wonderful and this is a definite keeper!!!

I think I came across this recipe about 2 or 3 years ago and since then it's pretty much the only way I make meatloaf now. I have tweeked it just a little for my own taste, but overall I don't change much. First, I use two eggs instead of one. I just feel it binds the meat together better and keeps it from getting too dry. I usually end up omitting the Worcestershire sauce simply because I keep forgetting to buy it. If I happen to have it though I include it. I do use more seasonings than just garlic powder. Basically, you just need to season it the way you like. I usually add something like season salt or all-purpose seasoning or maybe even some minced onions. Just whatever I feel like at the time. I also don't really measure the bread crumbs. I just sprinkle in however much I think looks right. Then I separate the meat into three small loaves in a baking dish, rather than one large loaf. I saw this in a different meatloaf recipe and I've found it works great for me. Then I bake the loaves for 30 minutes. Then I put the topping on and bake for another 15-20 minutes. The first time I made this I wasn't sure if I would like sweetness with meat, but I absolutely love it. Also, once I accidentally purchased apricot preserves instead of pineapple and it turned out to taste just as delicious. If you are one who has always preferred the classic meatloaf with more of a tomato and onion flavor, this might not be your thing. But if you're tired of the same ol', then give this a try!

Sometimes its best not to mess with success.  I have a terrific meatloaf recipe, but have been making it so often, I figured it was time for something new.  I made this recipe as is and I found it very very bland.  My husband said it was like eating a big hamburger patty.  The sauce on top was really delicious, but improvements must be made to the meat to give it more flavor.  Some suggestions from my other recipe would be to add some spice to the meat mixture (1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and 1 tsp chili powder), use store bought croutons (6 oz)  and puree them to a fine powder instead of the dry bread crumbs.  Additionally I would add one finely chopped carrot, 1/2 an onion and 1/2 bell pepper to the meat mixture to give it some variation of flavor and texture.   I think I may try a marriage of this topping with my meatloaf "meat" recipe and see if it is better.  Or I might just go back to my standby!

My mother makes a delicious traditional meatloaf with cheddar cheese.  My brother freaked out when he heard I wanted to make this "weird pineapple recipe." Tonight we had a throw down, this one vs hers.  Everyone went for this one, the cheddar one is in the freezer! I doubled the recipe and added half an onion.  Also made extra sauce for dipping using crushed pineapple.  Brother liked both and said for next time to make which ever is easier-guess that means it measures up to the cheddar one.

This meatloaf was delicious! I followed the other reviews and added crushed pineapple instead of pineapple preserves. Also, I added green peppers and onions just because I thought they'd give extra flavor. I would say that you should double this recipe to feed a family of four or more. There is no way this recipe written as is would serve 8. We have five members in our family and all of us loved the dish, but were left still hungry.

Used ground white turkey meat instead of ground beef, but otherwise made recipe exactly as it appears. It got rave reviews at the dinner table. Using the ground turkey changes the nutrition as follows: Calories: 183 Carbs: 22 fat: 3 Protein: 18 Cholesterol: 70 and sodium 264 per serving.

I have made this recipe SEVERAL times now...I will never make meatloaf any other way!!! Everyone that I cook this for RAVES about it! The only difference in my recipe is I use apricot-pineapple preserves because I have NEVER been able to find pineapple but it is AMAZING!!! Even my mom agreed this is better than her meatloaf!

Great recipe. I've made it multiple times. Like some others, I used pineapple chunks instead of the preserves, to make it less sweet. I also prefer ground turkey instead of beef.

Okay, this is a nice recipe, but it definitely needs some help.
First, add salt and pepper to the ground meat. There's none indicated in the orig. recipe.
Also, season the beef appropriately, it needs a little  ( 1/4 cup) fresh minced onion, plus a dash paprika, some minced fresh parsley, and if you're game, add your own spice blend to the beef. I added 1/2 ground chicken, 1/2 ground beef for the protein. Then I seasoned it as I desired. 

The saving grace for this recipe is the glaze. DO puree a 14oz can of pineapple tidbits, add the ketchup, add the sugar, add the wortcheshire and blend it up til it's still a bit chunky. season to taste with SnP. Coat as prescibed at about 20 min before you remove from the oven. with these corrections, this recipe is a hit for your hungry husband. enjoy.

I followed the advice from another reviewer and used crushed pineapple instead of preserves, only because I didn't have pineapple preserves in the pantry. I also poked holes in it to allow the sauce to soak through, and wow! This is one great meatloaf! My 15 year-old son thought he hated meatloaf until he had this, and now I've had to double the recipe when I make it or else there's not enough for me :)   Thank you for sharing a different and delicious variation on meatloaf!!

Good basic meatloaf.  I added a few more spices. And I made this into individual servings and wrapped them in bacon.  Then I froze them on a cookie sheet and then put them in a baggie to pull out and bake...add topping at the last.  Made these for a women's conference 150 women, and it was a hit.

Disappointing.  I like creative cuisine and thought this might be yummy based on some of the reviews.  However, the sauce was weird tasting and just didn't work with the meat.  Neither my daughter nor I cared for it. The meat mix itself was fine with the addition of some sea salt.  In the future, I will use the meat mix as a base and top the loaf with the traditional Heinz ketchup and nothing else.

I don't like meatloaf, or I should say I didn't like meatloaf before this recipe. Now this meatloaf is one of our favorites & there are never enough leftovers!

This is by far my FAVORITE meatloaf! It is SO good and I love the sauce (I always make extra). I usually serve this with egg noodles and a veggie. My grocery stores don't have pineapple preserves so I use Smuckers pineapple/apricot jam.

I love this meatloaf!!  I use garlic cloves instead of garlic powder, and end up using crackers because we never have bread crumbs on hand.  This is easy and the best meatloaf.  The sauce on top works very well.  I like sweetness, and do not like ketchup on my meatloaf...this sauce satisfies!  I use crushed pineapple..mmmm good.

Outstanding recipe and super easy. I followed others by using crushed pineapple instead of preserve for the topping. I also added some extra ketchup to the meat mixture to keep it super moist. The perfect twist on the basic meatloaf.

FABULOUS!  My husband is not a fan of meatloaf, and I finally found a meatloaf he likes!  To add more nutrition, I add a shredded zucchini to the meat. A great way to sneak in some veggies without anyone knowing...my two boys never knew!  Pineapple preserves are impossible to find.  I use crushed pineapple instead.  I just divide the can of pineapple into portion sizes, put them into baggies and then freeze them until I make this recipe again.

This is definitely my go-to meatloaf recipe. Sometimes I make it with ground turkey or ground beef (depends on how guilty I'm feeling about my eating habits at that moment) and sub apricot preserves for the pineapple (which I swear is how it was originally written many years ago). I also like to add a bit of Sriracha to the sauce for a slightly sweet and spicy kick but still a keeper in my home.

This review is really for the sauce. If you like a sweet sauce this one is excellent! I make a pretty good meat loaf with red/ green pepper, onion and garlic and other things so I did that and used this sauce. In fact I doubled it for dipping and was glad I did. A nice change to the routine fare and OMG, delicious! I'm going use this again and again. I can see it on ham loaf, pork, chicken... well you get the idea. Our Wal Mart carries pineapple preserves.

Based on taste alone, I give this recipe five-stars. Very yummy! I followed the recipe exactly (even down to the apparently hard to find pineapple preserves- my Wal-Mart sells Smuckers brand) and I was SURE the topping would be sicky sweet and crunchy with sugar. It was not! However, based on my personal standards for meals, this is rather lacking in the healthful department, so I'd give it a 3-4 star rating. I will definitely be making it again, but adding onion, carrot, zucchini or whatever other vegetable I have that I can shred and add in. But again, that's just my opinion and has nothing to do with taste. This recipe as is has amazing flavor! My husband and I ate more than half in one meal. :)

I tweaked it per some of the other reviews .. crushed pineapple instead of preserves, panko instead of bread crumbs, added a packet of Lipton's onion soup mix -- plus I also added about a half pound of ground pork to the pound of ground beef.  The meatloaf was great and the topping was delicious -- will definitely make again.

Excellent!  I could've eaten the whole thing.  Per others comments that the meat itself was a little boring, I added some red onion, red pepper, extra garlic powder, and a spoonful of the apricot preserves.  Also used panko breadcrumbs.  Poked holes in the meatloaf before pouring sauce over.

Followed the recipe almost exactly but used canned crushed pineapple instead of the preserves. It was okay, not great. Sauce was pretty good though. Maybe I'll try it one more time, possibly adding onion soup mix like others have suggested.

Wow this recipe was awesome. I used apricot pineapple preserves (bought at Wal-Mart)which turned out great. I used extra lean ground beef because I really did not want all the fat. My mother in law (tiny person) had two huge pieces, which really surprised us. She loved it. My husband wants me to make this more often. Next time I will double the sauce as it was so good eating it with the meat. I have passed this recipe on to many friends and family. Thanks again. This is a 5 star rating for us.

First I used Gimme Lean Beef Sub instead of ground beef.  Because of this I omitted the egg.  Gimme Lean doesn't need a binder.  I also used Garlic Bread crumbs and chopped fresh garlic instead of using powder.

The ketchup was Rocky Mountain Organic which has a much nicer taste than regular  off the shelf ketchup. It has a heavy note of nutmeg in it. 

I also couldn't find my worchestershire sauce so I used Braggs [extremely low sodium soy sauce] to taste and added some Hickory liquid smoke. 

The result was still excellent.  It works just fine with Gimme Lean and tastes exactly like a meatloaf.  And I avoided the cholesterol and fat of the egg and the meat.  It's a keeper for us.

All the reviews were right about the sauce!  It seems to soak into the meat very well, and gives a nice flavor to it.  You could even make the sauce separately and use it to top your own favorite meatloaf recipe.  I could not find pineapple preserves, so I used pineapple topping for ice cream!  It is practically the same thing.  I cooked the meatloaf for 40 minutes and put the topping on it 20 minutes through the cooking process.  It was great!  Thanx for a great recipe!

Awesome meatloaf! For those of you who cannot find pineapple preserves try the pineapple topping in the "ice cream sundae" section- which is basically the same thing and readily available.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I used apricot-pineapply preserves b/c I couldn't find pineapple.  Also, this makes a very small meatloaf.  I highly recommend doubling the recipe, because you're gonna want leftovers!

A very nice change to the typical meatloaf!  Loved the sauce, it is not too sweet, just right.  I added half a pack of Lipton Onion Soup Mix to the hamburger mix and used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and used crushed pineapples.  Yummy!

This was absolutely fantastic. Like a couple others, I did not have preserves so I used juice from canned pineapple and I doubled the amount of sauce. It was SOOO good...just really, really good. Thanks so much, Stacy!

This is the best meatloaf recipe ever!  My husband has never liked meatloaf, but has said this is the only one he'll eat.  The leftovers, if there are any, are awesome as a sandwich.  I absolutely love the pineapple and brown sugar glaze.  It makes this meatloaf a 5-star recipe.

I also added onions plus adding 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.  It gives it an even more tangy, sweet and sour flavor.

I would definitely use this recipe again. The only changes I made were to add onion into the meat mixture (I add onion to everything!) and because I could not find pineapple preserves I just used canned crushed pineapple (the kind preserved in it's own juice, not syrup). Yummy!

I must say I really enjoyed this.  The sauce is what makes it.  I needed to double the recipe and tried a little barbecue sauce with the ketchup because I had just enough on hand and I think I read it somewhere in these reviews.  The barbecue sauce did have a tendency to overpower the other flavors so I'm glad I didn't use too much.  I'll definately try this again.  Maybe I'll try apricot preserves instead of pineapple.  These were all items I had on hand, that's another plus and my husband loved it.  That's says enough for me.

Used my own meatloaf recipe (same but with 1 1/2 lb beef, a bit of onion, celery, grated carrot, bbq sauce, and Frank's red hot), then topped with ketchup, brown sugar, mustard and drained crushed pineapple, then 2 strips of bacon on the very top.  Baked for an hour and the last 5 minutes under the broiler to crisp the bacon. Seven of us licked our plates and the meatloaf pan clean. A+++ Everyone said that it was BEST they'd ever eaten. Thank you Stacy, the pineapple was a great idea!  I bet the sauce would be yummy on stuffed bell peppers, too.

This is very good, even if you use your own meatloaf recipe.  The pineapple toppping is such a great change.  I have used the crushed pineapple instead of the preserves.

it seems too little to be 8 servings. next time will make 2 pounds, and just double everything. Sauce is sooooo good!!! Definitely making again. Substituted 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple for pineapple preserves which were nowhere to be found. DELICIOUS! Ate with a side of mashed potatoes and stuffing.

Loved the glaze!  So good.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I will definitely add more seasoning to the meat next time as it was a little bland.  Even some salt and pepper would have helped.  I made extra glaze and used some on ham.  It was delicious!

i actually made this recipe with ground chicken & it was delicious! i used apricot pineapple preserves in the topping and used a little more bread crumbs and one more egg. Everything else was exact. This is a tasty meatloaf recipe & can't wait to make it with different ground meats. oh and my 4 1/2 yr old devoured it!!!

My Husband LOVED this meatloaf... and so did I!  Instead of the pineapple preserves, I actually just added the pineapple juice from a tin of pineapples (and saved the pieces for dessert).  The sauce infiltrated the meatloaf.  It was a saucy, delicious loaf of goodness.  Will definitely become a weekly dinner!

Great recipe, I have made this many times and I always get compliments and requests for the recipe.  I have made it with fresh pineapple and it is excellent.  Another time I was out of pineapple preserves and used blueberry preserves instead, just as good.  Versatile recipe and very easy to make.

This was awesome! I used kumquat ginger jam instead of the pineapple preserves and added ground mustard to the topping sauce. Also, I used 1 cup rice milk in place of the regular dairy milk.  It was so good! Thanks for a great recipe!

DEE-LISH! Trick I read somewhere: put meat on top of a couple of pieces of bread, to sop up fat as it cooks. The pineapple preserves really added a wonderful flavor. Not too sweet! Great sandwiches later!

Grocery store didn't have extra lean ground beef so I needed to blot the fat off of this.  However, this was really good and easy!  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added a packet of onion soup mix to the ground beef.  We agreed this was a keeper!

AWESOME!!! We added some onions and celery to give the meatloaf a crunchy taste, but the sauce is what makes it.
The sauce is unbelievable. I bet if you subsitiuted BBQ sauce instead of ketchup in the sauce recipes and put it on Ribs it would be great as well, I'm going to try that.  I would have never in a million years thought of pineapple preserves?!

This recipe was the BOMB!  My mom requested meatloaf for her 45th birthday and I found this recipe and made two big loafs.  I thought I had made way to much, until my brother in law asked for more and I turned around and both loafs were already eaten. It was a huge hit.  Everyone LOVED it.

This is very similar to the Brown Sugar Meatloaf on this site.  I like this one just as much as the other one.  I still have to convince my family that a sweetened meatloaf is tasty.  I liked it very much.  I added some green onions to the mixture to give it less of an onion taste.

Excellent Meatloaf!!!!   I followed the recipe as
written except that I had no dry bread crumbs so
ground up some specialty french bread I had on hand and my preserves were a combo. of fruits that included pineapple.   I've been making meatloaf for Years.. and THIS is one of the VERY best I've ever made.  We'll be making it
again and again.  BTW.. I doubled it and made two
so we'd have one left for sandwiches. It doubled
beautifully and I am so GLAD there's some leftover for tomorrow!!!  Thanks for posting your recipe.

If you like a sweet glaze over savory ground beef..it doesn't get any better than this!!! Never any leftovers...I am glad I didn't let the pineapple turn me off! This is almost like having sweet and sour meatballs in a loaf...just be sure to DRAIN the meatloaf before glazing.

pineapple meatloaf.... whodathunkit
awesome recipe the fam absolutely loves it I have to make it at least once a week...
A few little tweaks I do.. double the recipe right down to the last ingredient, but put half the pineapple sauce in the meatloaf cook for 40 mins then top it with the rest of the sauce and cook it another 20 mins
the pineapple taste is awesome but not overpowering.

The glaze is really sweet, but I liked it and the meatloaf itself needs more flavor so some extra sauce helps that. I think I would modify to jazz up the meat a bit next time. I did like it as it was a nice change from my regular recipe.

This is a great recipe!!  I didn't change much other than using meatloaf mix (beef/ veal/ pork) instead of just plain ground beef and used crushed pineapple instead of preserves because I couldn't find them.. still was wonderful.  Made several times and never have leftovers.  Making it tonight and trying real minced garlic cloves instead of powder!!

A delicious, unusual sauce for meatloaf. A really nice change! We are only a family of 3 so I used a large muffin tin to create 6 individual portions that could be frozen - but there were no leftovers! I spooned some ketchup on the bottom of the muffin cups so they wouldn't stick. For added flavour I mixed in a packet of dry onion soup to the beef. I also used 2 eggs instead of one so the meat wouldn't be too dry. For the dry bread crumbs I used garlic/butter croutons, that I finely crumbled in a chopper, to add extra flavour. As with other reviewers, I couldn't find pineapple preserves. So I used 1/4 cup of crushed pineapple and pureed it with the other sauce ingredients. I served it with mashed potatoes and green peas. Simple, delicious, and kid friendly. If you like the taste of sweet and sour meatballs you're likely to enjoy this recipe.

Love this recipe.  I usually make it without the pineapple because it's just not something I usually buy.  Someday I will try it.  I also use quick oats instead of bread crumbs and poke holes in the meatloaf with a fork before pouring the sauce over it.  Helps the sauce to penetrate the meatloaf a little bit.  Yummy goodness!!!!!

Although tasty, this falls short of making my "favorites" list. Surprisingly, this tasted REALLY good considering the very few (and unique!) ingredients that went into making it. What I didn't care for was the texture. My hubs comment about this being "dense" (and he not liking the texture either) was spot on. We both also agree that the sauce should be applied IMMEDIATELY rather than half way thru baking. Since my loaf was done at the 40 minute mark, I did not have the opportunity to continue cooking so that the sauce would thicken / glaze (bummer!). :( NOTE: "To taste" is a VERY subjective measurement. Because my hubs and I both LOVE garlic, I added 1 t powder to my meatloaf. I also added a t of onion powder because we are used to onion in our meatloaf (what's a meatloaf without onion???). This was spot on for us. Mashed potatoes and a veggie medley in cheese sauce completed our meal. I'll definitely tinker with this a bit, but for now I think I'm going to stick with tangastar's brown sugar meatloaf. It's my all-time favorite! Thanks anyways, Stacy. :-)

My family LOVED it!! I even LOVED it and I usually do not like Meatloaf. Instead of just a dash of Worcestershire sauce, I used something like 1 1/2 TBS. I didn't have pineapple preserves, but I did have pineapple juice I used instead. Great favor!!

When I told my family we were having meatloaf for supper, they all groaned in dismay.  They changed their minds after eating this.  There was none left and they all raved about how good it was.  I made it just as it was written; so simple and so good!

This is excellent but be warned, it's addictive. The first time I made this I naturally didn't read the recipe properly and added the brown sugar to the meat mixture. (I've used brown sugar in beef mince before so was just used to throwing it in). Well, it was still magnificent.  I didn't have preserves so used a small tin of crushed pineapple, worked just fine.
I just made it again with chicken mince and it was just as scrumptious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Super Easy and yummy! I am not a fan of traditional meat loaf but this was very good.  I did change it up a tad; I used crushed pineapple instead of preserves as a few others did, but I also added a bit of soy sauce.  Both myself and my man had seconds. There were no left overs. :)

Very Good, if fact better then expected! I used crushed pineapple instead of the preserves as I could not find pineapple preserves in my store. I thought it may be very sweet with the brown surgar, but it was not; actually it was perfect. This is a keeper. Also, thanks for sharing this excellent recipe

The sauce was a 10 but the meat needed more seasoning.  Either way, my husband gave it a 9 so I will be making it again but will definitely add more seasoning to the meat next time.

This was delicious as is!! It was probably the best meatloaf I've had. Use the pineapple preserves. The reason it was so sweet for most people was the apricot. Much sweeter. Ours wasn't too sweet, though. It was perfect. I got the preserves from windixie. most grocery stores actually carry it if you look hard enough.

I used canned chopped pineapple in a pinch and it was an absolute home run!!!!!  Great meatloaf.  I used oats to substitute for the crackers and egg substitute for the eggs and it came out  perfect. It is healthier that way, and we have food allergies to contend with.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I did not like meatloaf growing up so I only made it for my husband once or twice a year, trying all new recipes. This is a terrific recipe. I too used Ritz crackers instead of boring bread crumbs.I mixed apricot and pineapple preserves together, reduced the brown sugar and added some spicy mustard to the beef mix. Outstanding flavors. I am going to copy this recipe for a daughter-in-law who is crazy about meatloaf.

This is our favorite meatloaf recipe and I serve it about twice a month.  Even my mother, who made her own meatloaf recipe for years, makes this version now.  I've used both pineapple preserves and apricot preserves.  We like them both.

My whole family loves this recipe. Rarely are there any leftovers. My son calls it, "Really good meat." The only adjustment I make to the recipe is adding a 6 oz can of tomato sauce to the meat mixture. Yummy!

I love this meatloaf, but the directions- bake for 30-50 minutes! Huge window. Bake it for 30 mins, pull it out **and soak up the grease with a few paper towels because it will pool on top of your loaf**. Then add the topping mixture afetr you've poked in a few holes and bake for another 20 minutes.

It seems that apricot was the favorite alternative to pineapple, but I used banana. It was delicious. I'm not really too into pineapple and I didn't have any apricot preserves so I just mushed up some banana. I also used natural maple syrup instead of brown sugar. This was THE best meat load I have EVER had. I will NEVER make a different meatloaf ever again. Try it with banana instead of pineapple, its great. And if you are looking to go just a lil lighter try the maple instead of sugar. It really turned out wonderfully.

5 stars for the topping onlyl. The meat loaf to me would be only 3 stars unless you add additional ingredients. I added bell peppers, mushrooms, shredded carrots, tomato sauce, onion powder, oregano, basil. On my topping, I used crushed can pinapple and added alittle cornstarch and cooked until thick and bubbly..then I added in the ketchup and brown sugar. This was really outstanding! My whole family loved this recipe and all of us wanted second helpings, and no one went to the refrigerator looking for the ketchup.

Yum!! Had to change the recipe as I couldn't get pineapple conserve ( don't think it's available in Australia) so I used marmalade, I also used 1/2 tomato & 1/2 b.b.q sauce. Just so tasty, thanx.

I fixed it my other half who doesn't like meatloaf and he was telling me wanted seconds before he finished the first piece.  The only thing I did different was use oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs and omit the egg.

Well, we have been making this recipe for over a year now - and it's a smash hit.  I'm making it tonight, in fact, and I can't wait.  This is an awesome meatloaf recipe - and I have served it to my husband and to friends - I highly recommend it!  

I have never found pineapple preserves - so I use whatever is at the store - apricot, etc.  Turns out terrific!

The topping was absolutely wonderful, but the meatloaf left something to be desired. 

It was very bland without much flavor. I would suggest putting some ketchup and/or onion soup mix into the meatloaf to help it along.

Delicious! I could not find Pineapple preserves, but found Apricot & Pineapple preseves and it was still great! UPDATE: I now add 1 packet of dry onion soup mix and about 2-3 tbs of Worcestershire sauce  to the meat mixture. I also poke some holes in the meat to let the sauce drip through.

DELICIOUS! What a way to deliver on taste! Absolutely wonderful! I made exactly as stated, and used Smuckers Pineapple Topping (found with the ice-cream toppings at any grocery store) in place of the preserves because I couldn't find any! I was skeptical I admit, that such few ingredients could be worthy of such rave reviews, but I'm here to tell you, this is great! My husband would like me to "kick it up a notch" next time by using hot and spicy BBQ sauce for the ketchup portion. Will do! Thanks for the post!  

BTW - I'm not sure how this would serve 8 - that would be 1/8 pound of hamburger per person! Hardly enough for a bite! There was just 2 of us and we had 1/2 left over, so it really makes 4 modest servings.

My boyfriend commented this was the best meatloaf he has ever had and I have to agree!  It was very simple to make.  I had to make a few substitutions due to what I had on hand.  Ground Turkey, crushed pineapple and Italian flavored Shake and Bake for the bread crumbs.  I added chopped onions and minced garlic.  This recipe is now on my list of favorites.  Thank you Stacy.

I was searching for a recipe for dinner one night about a month ago and although meatloaf has never been a favorite for me or my family, this one sounded tempting..well it is more than tempting, it is simply wonderful! I have made it 3 times since, doubling each time, and plan to make it regularly.  I did use seasoned bread crumbs and used drained crushed pineapple in place of the pineapple preserves and it is just perfect.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

very good!! a nice from a regular meatloaf i substituted pineapple sundae topping for the preserves. everyone liked it including my 4 year old who insisted she wasn't going to touch it because it looked like brains before it was cooked. it is a little on the sweet side so if ya aren't into sweet tasting food dont bother trying it. i will be making this again!!

THis meatloaf was excellent.  Instead of using pineapple preserves, I used crushed pineapple (as a request of my boyfriend).  It was excellent.

Deliciously different.  It is incredibly easy to prepare and the tangy sauce makes it a huge hit with the family.

Recipe was very tasty and easy to make!  I used Italian style breadcrumbs.  I didn't find that the sauce was too sweet.  You won't want to eat tomato sauce meatloaf any longer after tasting this recipe.  Contrary to what it says, this recipe makes about 4 servings so I would double the ingredients if you want to make 8 servings.

Delicious and really easy to make, although kids weren't really keen on it.  They aren't big fans of meatloaf anyway.  I would say this recipe will actually feed about 4 people, not 8 as stated.  Will definitely make again.

I really like this recipe.  I also added chopped onion and fresh garlic and substituted ground pork sausage for half of the ground beef.  I prepared it the night before and added the sauce before baking.  It was moist and delicious.

Just made this tonight and it was a success.  I used organic peach , apricot preserves and cut the sodium down by using panko instead of bread crumbs.  My 3yr old had 2 servings.  No leftovers at all.

Dee-Lish!The fam loved it too! My moms new favorite dish! We r big eaters so I doubled the recipe, added chopped onion and cooked a bit longer. Made the purfect full size meatloaf. The sauce was not too sweet, i tasted it to make sure there was enough katsup to offset. I only used half the sugar and had only a 1/4 cup preserve and added a little fresh minced pineapple i had on hand to make the difference. (Although I thought about using the orange marmalade as well...next time).

I have to give this recipe 4 stars because I didn't read it properly and I added all the ingredients together ...substituted crushed pineapple for the pineapple preserves. However...this error resulted in the most amazing meatloaf ever !

Wow! That was really good. A sweet and tangy meatloaf served with a slightly bitter Bella's Brussels Sprouts with Bacon and slightly sweet Red Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Comfort food at its finest.

This meatloaf is great! I did add some minced onion and a little A1 to the meat, but it's the sauce that makes this dish. One suggestion; after a taste test, I found that I needed about twice as much of the pineapple preserves as the ketchup. Otherwise, it tasted like chunky ketchup. Also, the next time I make this, I'll heat the sauce on the stovetop, pour half over the loaf as suggested, then spoon the rest over the slices. Trust me, this sauce is THAT good! Thank you Stacy for a GREAT recipe!

There was a bit too much sauce for our preference but this cooked up nicely and everyone loved it. However, it is so similar to a recipe I already have that is somewhat easier to make so I doubt I will use it again.

This was delicious.  Next time I will double the sauce and use half to put on the loaf during cooking and the other half to serve on the side.  Also, I would add a little seasoning salt to the meat mixture for a little more flavor.

I tried this recipe, based on the reviews of others.  I too had my reservations about it, since it seemed like with the preserves and the brown sugar it would be too sweet.  I followed another person's advice and used crushed pineapples and loosely packed brown sugar.  Still, I thought this meatloaf was way too sweet.  My kids did not like it, my husband said it was "so so", and I know I will never make meatloaf this way again.  If you like sweet meatloaf, I suppose you will like this.  Otherwise, try a different  recipe. Sorry, this one is not for my family.

This was my first time making meatloaf. I also used a packet of onion powder and 1/4 can of crushed pineapple instead of pineapple preserves as others have suggested. It tastes delicious! The only thing I would change next time is I would double the recipe because it only filled up half the 9x5 inch loaf pan. I thought that it would rise to fill up the whole plan but it didn't, so the meatloaf wasn't as tall as I expected. It only ended up being about 2 inches tall.

I doubled the recipe.  This is FABULOUS!  The pineapple and Ketchup give it the "tangy".  I didn't use preserves.  I used crushed pineapple, the same measurement suggested for preserves.  Quite a treat!

I couldn't find pineapple preserves so I used apricot preserves and it was delicious.  The meat was very moist and the sauce added great flavor.  Very easy and quick to make.

Wow!!! I followed it exactly except I replace the preserves with crushed pineapple.  I tripled the recipe and there are no left overs at all.  Made with redskin mashed potatoes with dill, chives and garlic.

I made this last night and my husband raved about it.  I used peach preserves, but other than that, the ingredients were exact.  I would note however, that I formed 3 nice size patties out of the mixture before baking and that cut the bake time down to only 30 minutes as a little hint for those who want to save time.  Try this one, it is a keeper.

Just saw the recipe today and had to try it.  Love the sauce but the meatloaf itself left something to be desired.  I prefer my own recipe for that.  I don't measure, just throw in a lot of fresh chopped onions and garlic, garlic powder, oregano, basil, a couple of tablespoons of A-1 and 4 tbs of melted butter, salt and pepper.  From now on I'll use the sauce on that.

I personally enjoyed this recipe very much. I made it like it says and it was the perfect amount for my boyfriend and I. My boyfriend didn't prefer the glaze as he felt it was too sweet and meat should be just as it is. Which means more for me next time. :) Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was delicious!  The only changes I made was to add a packet of dry onion soup mix, like others have suggested, and then for the topping, I could not find pineapple preserves, so I used crushed pineapple and added some Tabasco sauce for a sweet and spicy mix , which still was delicious!

Oh my goodness! I followed the recipe exactly (I did make a little extra sauce for dipping) and it was WONDERFUL! I was never a big meatloaf fan but this is too good not to eat! Plus, it is so simple and in expensive!

Good Recipe, the glaze was a hit but next time I might add a little vinegar to give it a tang, I found it was more sweet then tangy. The meatloaf needed a little more zip to it as well, next time I will probably season it more with salt and pepper and maybe some garlic.  We enjoyed it but I will tweak it!

This recipe was pretty good.  I cooked it the longer end of the range (around 45 min) and it was a little dry.  Also, I wanted to write this review for those of you who can't find pineapple preserves.  I couldn't either and used apricot instead.  I have never had apricots before and after making this I know I don't like them.  They taste more like peaches than pineapples.  I would try grape if I did this again.  Or I would try the pineapple ice cream topping that I saw in the ice cream section.... the closest thing to pineapple preserves in my supermarket!  Overall, (despite me not liking apricots) it was still very good!  I will be making this again!

This is a winner! Having tried and loved the "Brown Sugar Meatloaf" recipe on this site, I wanted to try a similar recipe. Unfortunately, I realize mid-way that I did not have any brown sugar. I needed to substitute white sugar with a dash of soy sauce. It was still good but not as ideal as the brown sugar. I also used pureed pineapple (rather than preserves) and added garlic powder, garlic salt, & pepper to the meat as others had suggested.

Very good and very easy meatloaf.  This is one meatloaf that never fails me and always comes out perfect!!  I add some crushed pepper and some garlic to the meat mixture.  Yummy!  I've had many people ask me for this recipe after eating it.  I also use apricot preserves on the top rather than the pineapple because that's all I initially had in the house.  Since it came out so good the first time, I didn't want to change a thing!  That's all I continue to use.

To reviewers who don't understand why the recipe doesn't state to drain the fat often throughout the cooking...I don't have that problem at all.  Maybe they should try a leaner cut of ground beef for their recipe.

This recipe is delish. Sometimes I can't find the pineapple preserves so I just substitue with either pineapple-apricot preserves or just apricot preserves and it still turns out great. Both my sons love this recipe and have since I began and they are picky eaters.

I made this once a while back, and recently found the printout again.  I made them tonight for hubby and me, and they were just as fantastic as last time!  I just use canned pineapple (crushed) instead of preserves though.  The best'est', easiest meatloaf recipe EVER!!!

With the ketchup, pineapple & brown sugar, this was very much like a sweet and sour meatloaf. I also added half a chopped onion, some fresh garlic & some diced bell peppers. My family enjoyed it very much, I will definately make it again - however, like others, I would say it wasn't quite enough for 8 servings unles they were quite small. I doubled the recipe & found that made enough for our family of 4 to have seconds.

We all loved it! This is the first time I made meatloaf and someone didn't run for the ketchup. This will be added as a regular in our home. Only problem was that the recipe said 8 servings and it definitly wasn't enough. Next time I will double it.

I used 1/4 cup of crushed pineapple and did add Lipton Onion Soup Mix to the meat mixture.  It was pretty sweet for me but my mom came by for dinner and had 3 helpings so it had to be good!  Maybe next time I'll cut down on the brown sugar.

I'm sorry, this one just didn't do it for me. The meat was a bit bland. The sauce was too sweet. Needs a little jazzing up. Probably good for folks on a medical diet or with a sweet tooth.

Excellent meatloaf recipe!  I added chopped onion and extra Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and it turned out great.  Made the topping exactly as shown, including the pineapple preserves that I found at our local grocery store.  The sweetness is definitely unique and very delicious.  Leftovers were even better the next day!  This recipe has replaced my favorite "old fashioned" ketchup-style meatloaf!

I suggest adding some tomato sauce to the meatloaf to moisten it up a bit.  Also some salt and pepper.  A lot of reviewers mentioned it was too sweet and it may be that you just need less of the topping if you are only using 1 lb. of meat (that's a really tiny meatloaf).  I used 3 lbs. of ground beef and did not increase the topping measurements and it was plenty.  I used Safeway brand pineapple jam and followed the recipe as written.  I tried this again substituting tomato sauce for the ketchup and the result was fantastic!

The sauce was what made this meatloaf truly tantalizing. I used straight pineapple (crushed) and even put about a 1.4 cup of the pineapple right into the meatloaf. The sauce was sweet but not too sweet as some of the other reviewers mentioned. A good recipe that I will make again. Then leftovers were good too just reheated in a skillet.

Being an Aussie, meatloaf isn't part of our everyday cuisine, but I'm married to a Yank and try to make him American style meals when I can find the ingredients. This was a HUGE success with him. I used rolled oats (is that oatmeal?) instead of breadcrumbs (were they supposed to be fresh?) and as I didn't know what pineapple preserves were I used crushed pineapple. I added finely chopped onion to the meatloaf and sprinkled in a packet of French onion soup. I also doubled the whole receipe, should have just doubled the sauce. My daughters, 11 and 14, didn't like it, they thought it was weird but San Diegan hubby loved it!! Thankyou for all the helpfull tips. Cheers form OZ !!

This meatloaf was delicious!  I had added chopped onion and minced garlic, salt & pepper to the meat......then doubled the recipe for the tasty sauce to be sure to have enough for mashed or baked potatoes to absorb.  We loved it and will make it again!  This recipe as written would not feed 8 people who like meatloaf!

I tripled this recipe, added 1/4 cup minced green peppers, 1/2 medium onion, omitted the garlic powder, and 1/4 cup evaporated milk, and it was GREAT! I made it the day before and I had to check on it in the middle of the night to keep my husband from sneaking and eating it before church! Everyone loved the sweet taste it had, and the milk made it more moist!

This fabulous meatloaf was easy as well! I doubled the recipe and in doing so added an additional 1/3 c. ketchup (1 c. total) to the sauce because I like my meatloaf saucy! I also couldn't find pineapple preserves, but used apricot-pineapple and got a great result. I had italian breadcrumbs on hand and used them in place of the plain. I will make this again and again!!! Served over mashed onion potatos, delish!!!

The glaze on this meatloaf is great, but the meatloaf itself is bo-ring!  No onion?  It kind of tastes like just a big blob of hamburger.  I made it a second time adding my usual ingredients for meatloaf, onion, salt, pepper, a little green pepper, and increased the breadcrumbs a bit. I topped it off with the glaze just as written, and my whole family loved it.

Very good meatloaf. I'll definitely make this one again, especially because it was so easy to prepare. I would just suggest adding salt and pepper to the meat, and also some horseradish (about 1 T.) to the pineapple preserves mixture... it gives it a little extra zip.

Better than your average meatloaf, but we aren't really meatloaf eaters. Thought I'd try it anyway since it got 5 stars. Not bad. I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, added some onion powder, and cooked in an 8x8 pan to have more sauce per bite (also helped cook a little faster).

I made 2 pans of this for a group that really loved it! I did a lot of what the otehr reviewers did, I added onion and this recipie is scaled for half of what it yeilds so keep that in mind when shopping. I added something to the sauce to give it a tad for zip, some Dijon Mustard did the trick. I also wanted to repeat what the others have said.....DRAIN BEFORE YOU GLAZE or it will be runny. Great reipe though big hit with the guys!

My husband and I loved this meatloaf recipe. He says that one of the things that he likes about meatloaf the best is that it never comes out the same way twice. This is true even with this recipe. It is definitely a keeper.
Thanks for sharing it with us Stacy.

Mmm, Mmmm, Mmmm.  I am a big fan of sweet and salty antd this meatloaf is great - much different than the traditional meatloaf (which I really don't like).  I made my meatloaf with low-fat ground turkey and it came out great.  When I was short on time, I also formed the meatloaf mixture into patties and cooked them in my grill pan.  To finish, I put the glaze on top and popped them under the broiler for a couple of minutes until bubbly - FANTASTIC!

hm.... not bad. I think i made the mistake of not packing the meat close enough together though so I had issues trying to get a whole slice vs bits and pieces of slices. It was a really watery though. That might be because I used crushed pineapples and kept the juices. I think I would double to topping next time. It's really good. Oh yeah, I also added onions to the meatloaf.

This recipe is great. If it's ground beef you want this is the recipe for you it's not full of unwanted ingredients. I could not find pineapple preserves so I used three fruit marmalade and it was great.

I messed up and put the ketchup in with the beef and it was still delicious..very moist,but just a little too sweet. My husband loved it so I'll try it again and cut the sugar in half (i may or may not correct my ketchup mistake).

I used apple butter like someone suggested, it was really sweet but good. I had to use this because pineapple preserves are not available in my area. The meat was not as tasty I though it would be, I've had better. There really was not that much to eat. You should double the recipe to make a good amount.

Meat...loaf! For extra flavor I added 1/3 cup chopped onions, fresh white bread crumbs and 1/3 lb. ground pork to the meatloaf. Next time I'll make more of the sauce for dipping!

Did not turn out well at all. Fell apart and was not cooked thoroughly. Felt that it needed more ground beef. Could not get past the texture to enjoy flavor.

This recipe sat in my Recipe Box for over 2 years and I finally got around to trying it.  I had been craving meatloaf lately , for some reason, even though I'm not that big of a fan.  This was really good, though.  Meaty, juicy, sweet, and flavorful!  The boy only gave it a 3 but he needs to get over it.  This is NOT his father's (my ex's) DRY meatloaf.  Glad I finally tried it....I will make again!

This recipe was delicious! My very picky nine year old daughter loved it. Mouth watering! I could not find pineapple preserves anywhere, so instead used apricot preserves and it was perfect:)

My kids absolutely LOVE this meatloaf recipe.   I used crushed pineapples (drained) instead of the preserves because I had difficulty finding them at my bush league grocer.  Turned out fabulous and everybody goes for 2nds.

I tried this recipe last night I doubled it because my husband loves meatloaf. I took a a lot longer to bake (1 1/2 hours) but it was worth it. The only thing I did different was use crushed pineapple. It was very good.

I gave this meatloaf five stars because there was no ten !!  The incredible glaze makes the meal.  I have used it since on pork tenderloins and may even try it on ribs.  My only modification was to use apricot/pineapple preserves.  Do NOT pass this one over.  Its easy, fast and absolutely delicious.

I couldn't find pineapple preserves so I used crushed Dole pineapple (maybe around 1/3 cup). I added the glaze half way through cooking and poked holes in the meat like someone suggested. This turned out great! I wasn't a meatloaf fan until I made this one. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I loved the sauce, I too had to use crushed pineapple.  I also added onion soup mix to the ground beef.  Every one loved this ,but as much sauce as  this recipe made next time I would increase it.

Very nice recipe, although the sauce never glazed with the timings specified (perhaps the consistency wasn't right). Next time I shall try adding some spinach or other leafy vegetable to give the meal added nutritional value.

This was really easy to prepare and was yum!  I added the onion soup mix and didn't have any pineapple so swapped for Apricot Jam as per other review comments.  Worked well and would definately make this again.

We weren't thrilled with this at all. In fairness, I am not a meatloaf fan, but my husband had been bugging me to make some. I thought this one sounded ok, but it just wasn't for us. If you like meatloaf and sweet saucy things try this recipe.

I enjoyed this meatloaf...I did add a few things to the inside because, hey! It's a meatloaf! And it's mine and I do what I want! Anyway...the only slight issue I had was the sauce which I made exactly as the recipe says. It honestly was tasty but a bit too sweet, so I didn't love it. I may adjust it if I choose to make this again.

Great recipe, cooked it real similar to the instructions except I added ketchup to the meat along with salt and pepper, egg and bread crumbs Even found the pineapple preserves at Walmart on the bottom shelve in the jelly section. My family loved it!

Excellent recipe! I made the meatloaf the night before and put it into a pampered chef loaf pan; delivered it to my mother-in-laws house the following morning for her to put into the oven.  I think there must have been something wrong with her oven because after one hour and 45 minutes it was still red. I did double the recipe, but I wouldn't think that should have much of an impact on the cooking time.  It ended up being in the oven for two hours and 45 minutes!  That being said, my family has decided that this is the new recipe to use. They absolutely loved it.
I couldn't find just pineapple preserves either so I used the apricot pineapple and loved it!
Thank you for sharing this recipe!!  It's in my recipe box!

So moist, so flavorful! This is my first time making meatloaf and I must say I'm pretty proud of myself right now! :) I made it as it except I had to double the ingredients so get about 5 servings. No way does the recipe feed 8 as listed. I will definitely be repeating this recipe again and again!

This was a very good recipe. My 2 1/2 year old even liked it, and he is a very picky eater. I added about half an onion and a zucchini, threw them in the Cuisinart, and blended them until smooth. My toddler wont eat food with "chunks" in them. It ended up creating a beautiful, smooth flavor and texture for the meatloaf. I also added some italian seasoning, adobo, more garlic powder, and about a tablespoon of ketchup to the meat. For the glaze, I cut down on the brown sugar, since the pineapple preserves had more than enough sugar. I added the glaze to the meat and let everything cook together for an hour. It tasted amazing, and it was very tender. The only thing I would change next time would be to use fresh pineapple, instead of the preserves b/c it was just too sweet for my taste, and it would drastically cut down the sugar content of the meatloaf. Otherwise fantastic, served with white rice.

This is so delicious and at the same time so easy to make. Instead of Pineapple preserves I bought pineapple and apricot preserve is all for flavoring and Boiiiiii....it was finger licking good.. and instead of ground beef I used ground Turkey..very moist even when I had it the next day for left overs...thank you

I was worried with the recipes ingredients, but all the reviews convinced me to give it a try.  I made the recipe as written, without the pineapple preserves.  The giant eagle near me doesn't carry them.  I used crushed pineapple instead and mashed them up as much as I could. As a result, we had the best meatloaf I've ever made.  I will definitely be using this recipe as my go to meal.

My husband tried this recipe yesterday (yup, he's the cook in our house, and I love it!!). He had seconds; I saved my seconds for lunch today (only two of us, so we don't make huge amounts). Very tasty - I never would have thought of putting brown sugar and pineapple preserves in meatloaf.

Sounds fairly good. Try it with half mixture ground pork/beef or get very creative and third beef, pork & veal for a proper zing! Add some good quality ground parmesan and a few splashes brown sauce [to taste] and you'll be home-free!

My boyfriend and roommate love this recipe!  And they are food snobs!  The topping is what makes the meatloaf.  Very good idea!  I did use fresh garlic instead of the powdered, and I used some Cajun spicing and a Monterrey steak seasoning in the meat to give it a bit of a spice bite, that complimented the sweet topping nicely. 

I paired the meat loaf with some beer bread, a veggie salad, and some scalloped potatoes.  Perfect meal!

This meatloaf is awesome. I've made it a couple times already and everyone loves it. You can use any ground meat of your choice. My only two suggestions would be to double the sauce mix and to use tomato sauce instead of ketcup, much richer flavor.

This was good; the meat was a bit bland and i would add more garlic powder, onions and pepper next time I make it. I used peach preserves instead of pineapple and the sauce was very good.

I have decided to start reviewing the recipes I use, because I should give input.  I have made this meatloaf three times with no leftovers.  I really enjoy it, and the only difference I make is that I use crushed pineapple and mixin some onion aswell in the sauce, using a food processor.  thanks!

Ive been making this recipe for quite some time now and if you cannot find the pineapple preserves, a great substitue is pineapple dessert topping near all the hot fudge etc.

This is now our absolute favorite meatloaf recipe.  The only changes that I have made is I puree my own pineapple (fresh or canned-it just depends on what I have on hand) instead of using preserves.  I also cook it longer than the recipes says.  I shape it into a mini loaf and it takes almost an hour in my convection oven to be cooked all the way through.

I had to substitute orange marmalade for the pineapple preserves, since my grocery store didn't have the pineapple, but I assume the sweetness was fairly comparable. It was too sweet for us, although perfectly serviceable as meatloaf. I just don't think I would make it again.

Delicious.  I made one change.  I added a chopped onion because I couldn't imagine a meat loaf without onion.  I was tempted to spice it up even more just because that's the way we like our food, but I thought perhaps it was purposefully lacking in spices because it would be a better complement to the glaze.  Two things I will do differently next time.  I will leave out the onions because I don't think they added that much to the end effect.  And I will double the glaze recipe . . . half to pour on the top during cooking as the recipe calls for, and half to use to pour over the meat loaf at the table.  I don't think this recipe will take the place of a regular meat loaf in our house, but it is a delightful change.

I gave this 4 stars because my husband loved it! It thought it was good but I found the sauce too sweet.  Next time I will use canned pineapple instead of preserves to cut the sweetness a little.

What a great way to get kids to eat their meatloaf! This dish tastes just like sweet and sour meatballs, without all the time and mess. I have found that adding a chopped onion, a dash or two of worchestershire sauce, garlic salt and subbing with italian style breadcrumbs makes for a more savory meat to pair with the sweeter sauce. (For a more tangy sauce, I add prepared brown mustard to taste.) I always double the glaze, and like to DRAIN the meatloaf before glazing, to ensure that the glaze doesnt get diluted in the loafs cooking juices. Served with rice, steamed carrots and salad, and I never have leftovers.

This is delicious meatloaf!  I pureed fresh pineapple instead of the preserves and I also used half of the amount of brown sugar called for.  It turned out great and it was so easy!

Delicious!!!  used crushed pineapple instead of preserves.  Baked 30 min then put on sauce and did another 20 min.  Only thing I'll change next time is make more sauce to serve some on the side.  My 3 year old ate 2 whole slices and even my non-meatloaf loving husband enjoyed it!

I didn't change anything about the recipe except I doubled it, shaped the meat into a loaf and baked in a rectangular baking dish.  Our whole family thought the meatloaf was amazing. My husband made meatloaf sandwiches for the following two days and raved about it how good it was. The glaze was the perfect amount of sweetness. I am so glad to have finally found a meatloaf recipe that I like. I think this would also make a good recipe for a meatball appetizer dish.

This meatloaf was absolutely delicious! While the recipe as listed sounded great, I decided to incorporate some of the other reviewers' suggestions: I added about 1/4 cup onion and a bit of salt and pepper to the meat mixture. I also used 4-cheese cracker crumbs in place of the bread crumbs. For the glaze, I added about a tablespoon of mustard (and doubled the glaze recipe). I cooked the meatloaf for 40 minutes and it was wonderfully moist, even after sitting out for a bit. The only negative? I only got one small piece, because my teenage son devoured the rest! Next time I will double the recipe, because my guess is that it makes great next-day sandwiches.

This is something you will make over and over again, because it is so easy, delicious and healthy if you make minor changes.  I use ground turkey rather than beef.  I also use Best Marinara Sauce Yet from this site instead of ketchup and it really takes it to another level.  I also put a couple of spoonfuls of sauce into the beef mixture because I like a fairly loose consistency.  This is the kind of thing you can leave as is or add a few personal touches and it's great either way!  I recommend making a little extra sauce too, because it's so good!

I thought this was good, the meatloaf had a good flavor and held together well. I didnt love the topping, I used apricot preserves instead of pineapple and it was really sweet. I would leave out the preserves next time and only use ketchup and brown sugar.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I just blended a can of cubed pineapple instead of using preserves, and baked it with the ketchup and brown sugar as stated in a different review. I put 6 table spoons of sauce into the actual meat loaf but I think next time I am going to add a cup. it was really good as is though. my new fav.

I made it a point to let my husband comment about the meatloaf - completely unprompted.  He loved it!  I've been making a different meatloaf for years with tons of ingredients, but this simple, 5 ingredient base was tasty and dense.  (I think I overcooked it just a bit because it was slightly dry.)  The sauce ... YUMMY!  I had to puree pineapple chunks but it was still super tasty.

My husband said that this is the best meatloaf he's ever had.  The only reason it's a 4 star is because we don't LOVE meatloaf.  I followed others' advice and added onion, more W sauce and doubled the sauce.  I also just blended up some pineapple instead of preserves.

My husband LOVED this meatloaf (I'm vegetarian, so I didnt try it).  It's the best meatloaf he's had and its probably the simplest one I've ever made.  I doubled the sauce, cooked the meatloaf 30 min, took out and poured sauce on and cooked 25 more min.  The only drawback is that it didnt make much...8 servings?  Minus a small piece for my boys, my husband ate the whole thing in one sitting :-)

Good idea for meatloaf topping!  I adjusted a little - used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs and used fresh pineapple instead of the preserves.  And I cut down on the brown sugar a bit, it's plenty sweet.  Great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe that my wife and I have included in our meal cycle.  It goes really well with Steve's Garlic Home Fries as well.  I would recommend making more sauce.  The pineapple preserves can not be found easily, but they really work well if you use them!

This meatloaf is really good.  I was worried since some of the reviews said the meat was bland so I added chopped onions.  The GLAZE is AWESOME!  I would even recommend putting more so you don't take a bite without it!!!

Will definitely make this again and again!

OK this is great my whole family ate including my 4 yr. old who swore she'd never eat meatloaf. I think next time I'd just add onion soup to the meat part for a little more flavor, sauce was yummy, couldn't find pinapple perserve so I heated up some of the heavy juice in the can and added that.

Absolutely Amazing!  I even tried the sauce for the meatloaf (brown sugar, pineapple preserves & ketchup) over chicken and everyone couldn't get enough.  This is always a crowd pleaser.

We've been looking for a good recipe for a glazed meatloaf as opposed to just putting ketchup on the top and this is it!  It has excellent flavor and our family won't eat meatloaf any other way now!

Used crushed pineapple instead of the preserves.  In the interest of ease, I served it with Glory canned seasoned corn and Stouffer's spinach souffle.  Really easy, and a reasonably good meatloaf.  The sauce was better than the meatloaf itself, but mixed together in one bite it was good, and I would make it again.  Have since made the Rempels Family Meatloaf recipe on this site and prefer that one.

Bake for minimum time.  I use crushed pineapple in the sauce and it is amazing.  It is good with and without chopped onion in the beef.

I thought this Meatloaf was great. Unlike any meatloaf I've ever tried.. I followed the recipe but changed up a few things.. Instead of using pineapple preserves, I used chopped pineapple in a can and added it and the brown sugar to the meat mixture. Then I topped it with the pineapple, ketchup and brown sugar mixture.. It was delicious! I think next time I will add some ketchup to the meat mixture as well to make it more juicy..Definitely will make this again!!

This was okay. We didn't have any left, but hubby and I both thought it was way too sweet for our tastes. I didn't have pineapple preserves, so I used apricot preserves instead as other reviewers suggested. My teenaged son devoured this.

Definitely a keeper. I was a bit concerned because there wasn't much seasoning in the meat but it was excellent and I loved the topping. I cooked it for about an hour total. I did manage to find pineapple preserves but I'm sure it would have been good with apricot too. I think the preserves make it a bit thick as opposed to using crushed pineapple.
All round great recipe

I loved this!  I think having the meatloaf kind of on the plain side makes a really nice contrast to the sweet topping.  My kids both loved it, and hubby was glad I'd doubled it to make a two lb loaf (I used one lb ground beef, one lb ground turkey...I don't like the texture of all turkey, the combination of the two was perfect!)  This will be a regular!

I have never been a big fan of meatloaf, but I deceided to try this one b/c of the reviews. It was still meatloaf. I added chopped onion, chopped green bell pepper, Liption onion soup mix, more garlic and decreased the amount of brown sugar. I also doubled the recipe. If you love meatloaf, then this is a good one. It is just not my favorite thing to eat. My husband loved it.

As this recipe is it only gets a three star from me. I always make double and fix one the exact way the recipe says and one that is tweaked. Once I tweaked it I will give it a five. The things I did to the meat... added allspice, onion soup mix, garlic, green pepper, onion, celery, salt and italian bread crumbs. The way I did it came out alot better. THE SAUCE IS WONDERFULL!that gets five stars from me. This will be made over and over the way I fixed it. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent.  I doubled the sauce and put half in the pan with the meat, then added the rest for the remaining 20 minutes of cook time.  Also good with Apricot jam.  Tasty!

WOW!  I love meat loaf, but was afraid to try it without insulting my wife's family recipe.  It left her speechless too!  Now I love hers and this one.  They are both very different, so they are not competing against each other.

My husband and I love this recipe. He has me make it as often as I can stand. I added a medley of bell peppers. 1/2 of each: green yellow red and orange. Finely chopped. And I've looked at every grocery store that we shop at an have never been able to find pineapple preserves so I use a small can of pineapple juice. Works just as well if you prefer a smoother sauce compared to a chunky  sauce. I never have left overs!

Maybe a bit too sweet for some, but definitely a hit with my family!  This is the first meatloaf I have been able to get my choosy five-year-old to eat, and he now asks for it and takes second or third helpings!  My husband likes it also, and I have learned to not think of all meatloaf as boring and bland.  Thank you, we love it!!

I tripled the meat in this recipe and doubled the ingredients. I added an envelope of Lipton's Ranch powder. As with others, I couldn't find pineapple preserves so I used Smucker's Sugar Free Orange Marmalade. You could use almost any kind of preserves. This was very delicious. I will make again and again as everyone loved it.  Thank you Stacey.

My husband and I both loved this recipe! I doubled all of the ingredients and added a package of onion soup mix to give the meatloaf itself more taste. I also used apricot preserves because my husband is not a huge pineapple fan. I ended up cooking it for about an hour and then let it broil for a couple of minutes to carmelize the topping a little bit and it was delicious. Definite addition to my recipe collection!

Very good Stacy! I opted for plain tomato sauce from a large can, of which I used most. (my gang likes a lot of sauce) I also threw in some dijon mustard and some vinegar to really give it more tang. Onions and lots of seasonings were added to the meat. In answer to "Aussie Mum"; a preserve is similar to marmalade. I always make my meatloaf with ground turkey and my family doesn't complain. Strange, but I find it comes out much more tender than beef. I'm not a big meat eater but I did take a taste and found it delicious. Kids and hubby devoured this!! Nothing left for sandwiches!! Thanks so much Stacy!

Very good recipe. I did change it up a bit by adding 1 pkg of lipton onion soup mix and 1/3 C of water. It turned out moist and delicious, the glaze is the best. This recipe is a keeper for our family.

Thanks for sharing this recipe, Stacy.  I changed it a bit by using ground turkey instead of beef and crushed saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs.  But it was the sauce that really made this so delicious!  I have always like meatloaf but this one is really superb!  I would highly recommend it to others looking for a new slant on meatloaf.

Excellent sauce for the meatloaf.  I did add ketchup to my meatloaf like I normally do, as well as a bit of onion, but otherwise made the recipe as stated.  It made a lot of sauce for my meatloaf, but that was a good thing!  Thanks for sharing.

Good recipe. Changed it due to lack of ingredients: Ketchup instead of Worcestershire Sauce; Ground Turkey instead of Beef; Ketchup and Grated Parmesan for coating instead of pineapple preserves. This gave it a distinct italian flavor to it. Yummy!

This is really good. I'm always looking for a different way to fix meatloaf, so that's its just not the same old thing and this was perfect. I used seasoned bread crumbs and added garlic to the mix, and I also had to use pineapple topping because I didn't see preserves so I figured it couldn't be that much of a difference if any. But everything else I kept the same and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this! I made it for my mom's birthday and my fiance' loved it so much he ate half of the pan.  My mom loved it too. I've made it for him several times since, substituting apricot preserves for pineapple when we run out.

My husband HATES meatloaf and loved this dish.  The only change I made to the recipe was I used ground turkey instead of beef to be a bit healthier.

This is wonderful meatloaf.  The only thing I did differently was I used orange marmalade as I didn't have pineapple preserves on hand.  It didn't make it too tangy, but added a nice hint of orange which made it a little asian tasting.  I will definitly use this recipe again!  Thanks!

My husband loves this recipe.  It's a little rich for my tummy, so I can't eat too much, but the taste is just wonderful.  Growing up I always dreaded meatloaf, but this recipe definitely has made me a fan again!

This recipe was really good--I was kind of surprised that the recipe was supposed to be 8 servings!  The meatloaf was a lot "shallower" than I expected.  Above all--a great recipe.

Without a doubt the best meatloaf I've ever had!  And I've tried many recipes over the years.  This was so good, everybody had seconds.  I too had trouble locating pineapple preserves but used an apricot/pineapple blend and the results were fantastic.  This meatloaf comes out of the oven looking great, with a beautiful red glaze, and tastes delicious.  And it held together better than any other meatloaf I've tried.  I will be serving this on a regular basis from now on.

Absolutely fabulous meatloaf! So much better than the more traditional recipe. My husband who does not normally like meatloaf and my one year old both liked it and have eaten it time and again.
Thanks!

I thought this was very tasty however I am not one for exactly following recipes thus I fudged with some of the ingredients. Like the pineapple preserves, I used apricot pineapple. Instead of bread crumbs I used oatmeal. Definately a good recipe!

I really liked this meatloaf recipe.  It was very easy to prepare.  The topping is what does it...it gives it such a good flavor, that you don't need to add any extra condiments.  My husband always added chili sauce or ketchup to my other meatloaf recipes!!  Would definitely make it again!!!

My FIRST meatloaf-and it was awesome, and SO EASY.  I did use 1.4 lbs of ground beef, 2 eggs, 1 tsp garlic powder.  This will DEF be my traditional meatloaf recipe-- and contrary to others saying it was too sweet-- for me and my husband, it was PERFECT.  Will try w/ raisins and curry next time!!

This meatloaf was incredible. My family enjoys meatloaf- and said that recipe was a great change of pace from the ketchup-based meatloaf. We loved this recipe and I'll will probably make this one my staple meatloaf recipe in the house.

I have never liked meatloaf before. I figured I would try something new for my family and I am the one who ended up really enjoying it. I will definately make this again, next time I need to use more meat. One pound was not enough.

Oops I made a mistake that still tasted good.  I poured the brown sugar in the the bread crumb mixture by mistake.  It actually came out great. I had to get more brown sugar for the glaze and instead of pineapple I used with apricot preserves.  I will make this way again.

this meatloaf was fairly good.  I'm just used to my typical meatloaf.  I made one change I used apricot jam instead of a pineapple.

This recipe is alright. I also had to use pineapple tidbits in place of the preserves. I added an extra egg when I realized there was no liquid called for & the meatloaf wouldn't hold its shape. Probably wouldn't make it again. There are meatloaf recipes on this site that I enjoy more then this one. But, hey, to each his own! :)

I love this meatloaf.  I added some onion to the meat to liven it up a bit.  My boyfriend didn't like the topping, so that is why I didn't give it 5 stars.

Sorry...my family just didn't like this.  They thought it too slimy.  The flavor was good, much like the sauce I use on my pineapple chicken, but the combination was not a hit.

Delicious! I had seconds, which is incredible since I am not much of a ground beef eater. My meatloaf recipe is similar, but with just ketchup on top. This has definitely jazzed it up! My husband didn't even dip it in ketchup, which is a first!

This was the best meatloaf I have ever had. However, I did use seasoned breadcrumbs, some chopped onions and chilli sauce instead of ketchup.  My four year old told me she wanted it everynight and she only has about fifteen things on her approved food list!

Excellent meatloaf.  I've used ground turkey & added chopped celery & green onions.  My husband loves it.  He's OTR trucker & I fix up his meals a week at a time & freeze them.  With a potato & veges...yum!!

Made it the night before, including the sauce.  Actually put the Worcestershire sauce in the sauce instead of in the meat and it was delicious.  I will definitely be making it again.

As another member suggested, I didn't have any pineapple preserves on hand.  Instead, I used crushed pineapple (along with the juice) and it came out great!  This is probably the easiest meatloaf I've ever made, if not also the best!

I used crushed pineapple and 1/4 cup pineapple juice instead of the preserves.  It was excellent. The meat was very moist and didn't dry out like ordinary meatloaf.

The meatloaf was a success.  Because I was unable to find pineapple preserves, I substituted apricot preserves.  The sauce was very sweet.  The meatloaf might have been better with a little less sauce.  Overall, it was a delicious recipe.  We ate leftovers the next night, which didn’t seem quite so sweet.  My husband puts ketchup on EVERYTHING, but he passed this time.  He said this meatloaf doesn’t need it.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I'm not a huge fan of meatloaf, but this was just great!  I especially liked the glaze, which I didn't think would turn out since I had to throw out my packed brown sugar (it was as hard as a rock- I tried to soften it but that didn't work- I ended up using a 1/4 cup of brown sugar granules instead).  This recipe is a real winner.  Thanks, Stacy!

This was soooo good! I did make a few substitutions - I didn't have bread crumbs so I used whole oatmeal that I chopped up real fine, didn't have garlic powder so I used garlic salt, also didn't have pineapple preserves so I used BBQ sauce. The sauce wasn't so sweet with the BBQ as per previous reviews, but it was definently delicious!! Thanks Stacy for a great recipe!!

I THOUGHT THIS WAS REALLY GOOD. I DID NOT HAVE BREAD CRUMBS SO I USED QUICK COOKING OATS INSTEAD. PLUS I ADDED A LITTLE BIT OF KETCHUP AND SOME ONION TO THE MEAT MIXTURE. ALOT OF MEATLOAVES I HAVE MADE FALL APART. THIS ONE DID NOT. I WILL USE THIS RECIPE AGAIN BUT MAY LEAVE OUT THE PINEAPPLES AND USE BBQ SAUCE ONCE IN AWHILE TO CHANGE IT UP A BIT, DEPENDING ON WHAT I AM IN THE MOOD FOR.

Make sure you use LEAN ground beef - I couldn't find pineapple preserves so I used crushed pineapple instead  - I make with mashed potatoes - The sauce goes great with the potatoes - FABULOUS recipe!

What a great recipe! The glaze on this meatloaf was out of this world! I only had apricot-pineapple preserves so I used that instead of just pineapple and it was soooo good! The whole family loved it and we all fought for the last piece, LOL!

I made this on a work day and the preparation was quick and easy.  When I served this, the whole family loved it. I served it with egg noodles and my son asked for seconds!!

The whole family loved it!  My husband who doesn't like meatloaf even liked it!  I didn't have any pinapple preserves but I did have hawaiian marinade (pinapple/teriyaki flavors) that I added instead.  Made sweet and tangy moist meatloaf!  I can finally fix meatloaf that everyone will eat!!! a new family favorite!

I substituted crushed pineapple because I couldn't find the pineapple preserves in the store.  It was still pretty good though.

I really didn't care for this one at all, I ended up drowning it in ketchup to make it edible. It was really watery and the meatloaf was dry with not much taste.

My wife hardly ever likes a sweet tast with meats, and she hates meatloaf - HOWEVER, she thought THIS dish was great!  That's right.  If my wife will eat sweet meatloaf, you better make this recipe right now.  I used crushed pineapples in heavy syrup instead of preserves like someone suggested - it was great!

Like a previous post I could not find the Pineapple Preserves in the Dallas area. Hubby and I used Apricot/Pineapple Preserves. Still had a very good flavor. Will definately make again. Adds an exciting twist to plain ole meatloaf.

Very nice twist on the traditional meat loaf. I couldn't find pineapple preserves, but used pineapple juice instead and it still came out yummy. I'll definitely be making this again!

This is really good.  The sauce is EXCELLANT.  (I think it would be good w/pork chops too!)  The meat itself was a little bland.  I think next time I will add more garlic and some salt and pepper.  I did make extra sauce, and it is great.  And this is so easy to make, I will def. do it again and again!

This was great!  My husband, a meatloaf fan, loved this and so did I... and I've
never much liked meatloaf because it always tasted like there were too many 
spices or it was overmixed before cooking.  The only changes I made to this
were I added a sprinkling of onion powder to the meat mixture, and I used a 
can of crushed pineapple in heavy syrup instead of the preserves (I was afraid 
that would be too sweet).  I made this twice in one week at my husband's 
request, and this will be a regular item on our menu-- I won't be looking for any 
other meatloaf recipe now!

I couldn't find any Pineapple preserves the first time I made this recipe so I substituted with Duck sauce. It came out so good, I've never tried anything else! I've also added cheese to the mixture by my spouse's request a few times, that comes out great as well.

EXCELLENT!  We had guests, so I needed to stretch
the recipe.  I doubled everything, and I did 1 lb.
of ground beef, and a 16 oz tube of ground pork.  I
also added 1 chopped onion, and 1 chopped bell pepper.

The only preserves we had in our area was apricot-
pineapple preserves, and it came out very yummy!  We 
all loved the way the sauce really "stuck" to the
meatloaf like a glaze.  

Our guests took the recipe home, and it will be the
first time the wife ever makes a meatloaf.  My oven
cooks a little on the slow side, so it took about
an hour and a half to cook!  Well worth the wait!

Would rate this a 4.5 for a basic meatloaf if it were an option.  I followed other reviews and added some Worcestershire sauce. Also, I didn’t have bread crumbs so I used crushed soda crackers. Easy and delicious meal the whole family liked, including a picky 5 year old.

I made it with crushed pineapple because I couldnt find preserves.   The recipe had just enough sweetness.    I will make it again although I may spice up the meat a little more.  I may add some onions and more spices.   It was a yummy dinner for sure.

I made this exactly as written. The sauce was delicious and the only saving grace of the meal. The meat itself was bland. If I make this again there will definitely be additions to the meat, such as onions and green peppers.

Didn't think this was too sweet at all! The only thing I would say I would change next time was I would add in some onions, peas and carrots and heavily season the meat. The ground beef didn't have much flavour if it wasn't covered in the sauce. But over all I thought it was good. Will make again. Forgot to take a picture, next time!

I will make it again.  My kids even liked it and sometimes they are picky on meatloaf.  I've made it so many different ways, and this is one of the better ones. I didn't have pinneapple preserves so I used Orange marmalade to get the sweet preserve affect.  I also added about 4 extra dashes of worchestershire , however I was making a double batch anyways.

Great meatloaf! I added diced bell pepper & onion to the mix and couldn't find the pineapple preserve either so I used crushed pineapple in the place. Enjoyed the leftovers for lunch the next day , meatloaf sandwiches!

I usually top my meatloaf with A1 steak sauce or I do a brown sugar glaze. I was really excited to try this recipe and do something different. Made this for dinner last night. I followed the recipe exact except I used apricot jam. Couldn't find pineapple. It tasted good, I enjoyed my dinner. But it wasn't anything special. It didn't wow me. I'll just stick with the way I normally make my meatloaf. Again it tasted good but I can't explain it. Like it wasn't nasty but I just didn't care about it.

This meatloaf is the best I've ever had it will always be my number 1 pick when I feel like meatloaf, I even made it for my mom who is a very picky eater and doesn't care much for meat.

Make exactly as directed! It's perfect! My only recommendation is using lean ground beef -- I prefer at least a 95%/5% ratio.

I've made this recipe twice now. The meat is incredibly moist and the sauce is very flavorful. I added Green Peppers. I think next time I'll add pepper to the meat. With the sauce on the meat, leftovers freeze really well.

Loved this recipe.  I put the brown sugar IN the meatloaf by mistake and it still tasted great!  I did use crushed pineapple (because it was on hand)  Definitely a keeper!

I tried this recipe a couple months ago but never rated it. I made it because for some reason my Mom likes meatloaf and I was curious as to why because I hardly ever eat it or order it when I'm out. I decided to try this recipe mainly because of the ingredients and it was so tasty! It was a nice blend of flavors and my roommate and I devoured the whole loaf within a half hour (we were hungry and it was good)!

Great recipe.  I added green pepper and onions to the meatloaf mixture; and I always use oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs.  Not a problem with the bread in this recipe--just a choice I make, regardless.

This is awesome, and my husband and toddler think so too! The only thing I adjusted was to use barbecue sauce instead of ketchup, and a little less brown sugar (basically just scooped it up loosely in the measuring cup instead of packing it in.) So delicious, thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This would be just an ordinary meatloaf but once the glaze is added it turns in to an incredibly tasty meatloaf.  Definately the best meatloaf I've ever had!

The Meatloaf itself was nothing special, but the sauce was excellent. I topped the loaf with crispy bacon before I poured the sauce over.

I made this last week to mix reviews. I loved it, but boyfriend liked it, but thought that it was too sweet. I may try to make it for him again, but use crushed pineapple, rather than preserves to cut down on the sweetness. I thought the leftovers made great meatloaf sandwiches and was okay that he didn't love it, because that left more for me!

Improvised both ingredients & cooking method, still turned out amazing!

Raided my pantry for meatloaf ingredients, still resulted with a winning combination! I had no breadcrumbs, subbed croutons (crushed); instead of onion soup mix, I used dried onion flakes; instead of egg, I added BBQ sauce (Lucille's BBQ) & cup of cheese (white cheddar/gruyere).

Turned slow cooker on while I prepared ingredients & lined it with foil. Cooked high in slow cooker, high (4-hrs). Added the amazing pineapple glaze on last 20 min. Made this with 2-lbs ground beef, would make again 4-lbs next time! Thank you for a versatile & super tasty meatloaf ~ absolute keeper!!

My husband said he would never eat meatloaf, but he sure does eat this one. I could never find pineapple reserves so I have tried sweet orange reserves, and also loved it with my grandmothers homemade white grape jam. My kids and husband enjoy it so much I double the batch and make sandwiches the next day!

I didn't have pineapple preserves but had a jar of homemade jalapeno pepper jelly. I used just a tiny bit less brown sugar than called for. Also took others' suggestions and added onions to the meat. Used "eggbeater" in place of egg. DELISH!

Following the recipe to the letter but for the pineapple (I only had Apricot), the sauce was great.  Taste was delish.  Only problem was texture.  It crumbled a lot while serving.  I prefer the texture on the Lipton Onion Soup packet but I have to say, the sauce was so simple and yet so delish.  Had a Hawaiian feel.

Used ground white turkey meat instead of ground beef, and added chopped bell peppers and onions, and a little salt and pepper. Pretty tasty.

Hands down best meatloaf I've ever made.  Even fed it to my mother (who NEVER veers from her recipes) and she loved it.  And the best part is, the kids LOVE it!!!  Try and get a 2 and 3 year old to eat all of their meatloaf and ask for seconds!

I added some chopped onion and green pepper to the mix, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  This was definitely one of the better meatloaves I have ever made.  This recipe is a keeper.  I happened to have some spicy pineapple preserves on hand from a gourmet store, and I think that may have made the difference.  Others mentioned the sauce being too sweet, but mine turned out perfect!

I am not generally a meatloaf fan, but this is one of my favorite dinners! 
I made a couple easy changes - I actually double the meat and mix-ins and I quadruple the topping. Not all the sauce can fit in when you double the meat, but I just heat the rest up on the stove. 
**No matter what, I would STRONGLY suggest to double the topping, even if you do everything else the same!

My husband and I love meatloaf so I'm trying many different recipes to find the perfect one. This one is pretty close to it...meat came out moist and lots of sweetness with the brown sugar.

The whole family loved this meatloaf, even my husband who does like things to sweet! I too used onion soup mix and spices to jazz up the meat. Also, I multiplied the sauce recipe by 1.5 to get extra sauce. We all loved it!

This is a great meatloaf recipe, both my family and I loved it! I try not to rate making substitutions, but I couldn't find the pineapple preserves and used crushed pineapple instead.  This was an easy, make ahead recipe, and will definitely do again!

This meatloaf is AMAZING!!!  I am a single parent with four boys and they HATE meatloaf.  I fixed this recipe and they ate every bite off their plates and wanted seconds!!!  After they got through eating I told them it was meatloaf.  They themselves couldn't believe it!  This is the only meatloaf recipe I will ever cook!  Thanks Stacy B. you have the perfect meatloaf recipe!!!

I did quite like this however I used 75/25 ground beef and would do this again but with a better meat.  I did add a envelope of union soup to the mix and I used apricot preserves.  I will try this again because it is the only meatloaf my daughter said was pretty good and she hates meatloaf.

this is wonderful as is.  the only thing i don't do is the pineapple sauce over the top as i generally don't have the preserves on hand, but would definately love to try it that way. i generally just use the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar glaze and it still tastes awesome.

Very good! I used an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple and combined it with the ketchup & brown sugar in a food processor.  I also added a medium sauteed shallot to the meat mixture.

The meatloaf itself had very little flavor ( I used 93% lean beef so that was probably part of the problem). The sauce was ok but kind of reminded me of something that I would have made in a home ec class. It was too sweet and sticky.

After making this a dozen times I am finally taking the time to rate this recipe.  My family absolutely loves this meatloaf.  My husband of 20+ years refused to eat meatloaf ever until I made this recipe he loves it too.  I usually use apricot preserves instead of pineapple.  Thanks so much for this one.  I make it at least once a month.

I added one shredded carrot. Doubled the topping.  Didn't have bread crumbs so used 4 slices bread, dried and torn in pieces.  Also used steak sauce and 3 cloves minced garlic instead of worsterchire.

This review is for the sauce only, since I made my usual turkey/tofu meatloaf.  The sauce was excellent!  I used canned crushed pineapple and it came out perfect--not too sweet.  Will be using this sauce from now on instead of just plain old ketchup.

We absolutely loved this recipe. I couldn't find pineapple preserves, but we used apricot - delicious! I doubled the sauce to pour over the meatloaf and a wild rice mixture we served alongside the meatloaf. Fabulous! Thanks.

MMMMMMMMM - what a yummy, yummy change from meatloaf made with dry onion soup mix topped with ketchup!  I had to substitute canned crushed pineapple with about 1 tablespoon of my grandma's homemade guava jelly for the pineapple preserves because I didn't have time to stop by the store.  Oh, and I added a splash of vinegar because it was a bit on the sweet side and I tell you it had my husband and I licking our plates.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  I'm really not sure if my kids will like this (they hate change) but I'll certainly make it this way when it's just me and the hubby from now on!!!

YUMMY!! I didn't have any pineapple preserves so substituted tomato/jalapeno preserves I had on hand. What a kicker. I will definately try this again, and use the pineapple preserves.  So quick to make too.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Oh my, this was so great.  Didn't have plain bread crumbs so used seasoned.  Used more Wochestershire and garlic powder than called for.  Couldn't find pineapple preserves so used peach.  YUM!  The meatloaf is so good you really do not need to sauce.

This review is only for the Tantalizing topping on this meatloaf.  I make my regular meatloaf, I do make a good meatloaf and add this topping towards the end of the baking time.  I followed the recipe for the topping exactly the 1st time and found it too sweet.  Next time I added only 1 TBLS of brown sugar and added 1 tsp of ground mustard to the ketchup and pineapple ice cream topping (can not find pineapple preserves).  Plenty sweet.  Not everyone cares for the topping (they can scrape it off) but, my youngest grandangel loves his meatloaf made this way.  So now I make my meatloaf for him and the others can adapt.  Thanks for a great topping suggestion.

I'm not sure if it was the canned crushed pineapple, but it was way too tangy and it didn't taste right. I won't be making this again!

Loved it....and so did my family (my kids are very hard to please) The only thing I did different is used apricot preserves because I could not find pineapple preserves in the grocery store, but when I do, I will try it!!!

I had thought this recipe would be somewhat of a gamble when I first made it.  My husband has told me before that he usually doesn't like meatloaf; however, the recipe sounded intriguing.  I liked the idea of sweet/tangy meatloaf.  I am really glad that I made it.  My husband was really thrilled by this dish; we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  The only major change that I made was to use ground turkey instead of ground beef.  That doesn't seem to alter the desired outcome.  The meatloaf part itself is kinda bland when going by the recipe; however the sauce that you pour over it really perks it up to make this something special.  I enjoyed the sauce so much that after the meatloaf was gone, I used the leftover sauce to finish of the steamed vegetables I had cooked to serve along side this dish.  Yum!  I definitely will make this again.

Great recipe...however I did use ground turkey in place of the ground beef which went very well with the pineapple flavor. I also doubled the sauce and added some to the ground meat mixture to moisten it up. I think I will try it with crushed pineapple next time to cut back on some of the sugar. Served it with corn and sweet potato wedges for a healthier yet still incredibly tasty version of meatloaf and potatos!

This was absolutely DELICIOUS! My family, who hates meatloaf, loved it. However, I couldn't find pineapple preserves so I used pineapple ice cream topping and it worked just as well. Thank you for sharing this recipe, I will definately be making this again.

Very good.  My first attempt at meatloaf.  Had to use pineapple+apricot preserves, as that is all I could find here.  The sweet/tangy-ness of it was a nice touch, and far better than meatloaf we tend to pick up at the store.

I was on the 50 minute side of things to ensure it was fully cooked.

This is such a quick & easy recipe - and a definite keeper. Only made a couple small changes to the original recipe: I substituted ground turkey (as healthier alternative to ground beef) and added a handful of chopped onions to the loaf. Baked for 25 minutes, then added the sauce & baked for another 20 minutes. Had to use apricot/pineapple preserves since I couldn't find just pineapple preserves. And, based on some other commets, I doubled the sauce - and so glad I did. I've been on the search for the perfect meatloaf recipe & this is a definite contender. My boyfriend said this is the best yet!

Only change was to use apricot preserves (jam) instead of pineapple (couldn't find it). Easy to make and oh so flavorful. Great dish! Love the saucing on it. Made individual miniature loaves.

I must agree with the other comments.  This dish was definitely excellent.  As my family size is big, I had to double the recipe.  I did use the Crushed pineapples and scaled back on the brown sugar.  Perfect...simply delightful. Thanks for sharing.

Yum!  5 stars for ease of preparation and such a great flavor.  I used ground turkey and apricot jam and it still came out very tasty.  I did have to increase my cooking time, though.

I couldn't find pineapple perserves, but I did find apricot-pineapple, so I used that. It was far to sweet instead of tangy. Will not make this again.

Yummo!! I made a couple of changes in that I added fine chopped onion and bacon to the meat. I couldn't get the pineapple preserves so did what others had suggested and used apricot jam and couple tbspn of crushed pineapple. This is the first meatloaf I have made that my whole family enjoyed. I will probably make this every week now!!

I followed the recipe pretty much as written (I used Italian bread crumbs and mixed light and dark brown sugar) and it was excellent! My family of 4 boys and my husband LOVED the meal. My 11 month old baby and my picky 5 year old went crazy for it. It had an excellent flavor, wasn't dry and very easy to make. For some of the people who could not find pineapple preserves, I was able to find them at a Super Wal-Mart. I will definately be making this again for my family!!!

It just doesn't get any better than this.
Sweet, Tangy and moist. But, there is always a but. The recipes reads one pound
of meat for eight people. Apparently, this must be a typo that should be corrected. Not unless eight people are eating one piece super thin. Thanks will make again. A definite keeper.

Excellent recipe.  I added 1 tsp garlic powder to the meatloaf and used Dole's crushed pineapple in 100% juice instead of the preserves.  Delicious!  Next time I'll use less brown sugar - the pineapple is sweet enough!!!

This is a keeper -- Some meatloaves turn out too "soft" or moist for me.  This was nicely firm, and I loved the sauce for the top.  Thx, Stacy, for the great post.

This was simply good!  I did add salt and pepper to the mix and baked it in a 9x13 pan.  It took about 25 minutes on the convection setting and I added the topping when the internal temp reached 140 then baked it to 160.  The best part is the size of the meatloaf: it was perfect for a small family.

I couldn't take a picture because it DID NOT LAST that long!

I forgot to put the Worcestershire sauce in the meat so I added it to the glaze.  I used pineapple toppping (leftover from ice cream)and this was the BEST MEATLOAF EVER.

I did change the base becuase I just made my own typical meatloaf.

I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS WAS

That was good but probably will stick to my other recipe that I found in Tast of Home.  Just like the tast of the Tast of home recipe..though nothing wrong with this one.

Absolutely fantastic and so simple.  The ingredients sound odd together, but take the risk, it is worth it!

Used apricot-pineapple preserves and added some green onion.  I can't stand meatloaf but this was not too bad, except that it did not cook evenly - outsides were too done, middle was still pink.  Hubby thought it was pretty good but he didn't like it as leftovers so some got thrown away.

This is very good!  I changed a couple of things (because of lack of supplies), but I really liked it this way.  In the meatloaf, we used crushed croutons instead of breadcrumbs.  In the sauce we used Rich and Sassy BBQ instead of ketchup and apricot preserves instead of the pineapple.
Yum, Thanks!

I don't understand why everyone adored this recipe, for one it does not tell you to drain the fat OFTEN throughout the baking. I found the loaf needed the full 50 minutes and the glaze just slid off the top with the fat, maybe add the glaze in the last 5 minutes rather than the last 20. The meatloaf itself had very little flavor and I added mustard powder, basil and oregano yet it was still bland. I should have stuck to my mothers old recipe.

decent meal - certainly nothing to go crazy over  as others have stated, the meat itself is not well seasoned so would make significant changes - adding worcestire, onions, ketchup, peppers, bread crumbs, italian seasonings etc. but the topping is what makes this a recipe worth keeping.

I like this recipe, but my boyfriend doesn't. It's too sweet for his taste. I'm going to try to substitute the ketchup for some Heinz sweet chilli sauce the next time.

I added some minced onion and green pepper to the meatloaf but the glaze was delicious!! It took me forever to find the pineapple preserves but it was worth the effort of finding it.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes to make!  Growing up I hated meatloaf and as an adult I very rarely made it...until I found this recipe!  My husband and I have been using this recipe for over a year now and can't get enough of it!  My 3 year old loves it as well!  The perfect flavor for our tastes!  Thanks for sharing!

This is the best meatloaf receipe I have ever come across.  My family loves it and it is so easy.  I could not find any pineapple preserves, so I have used apricot and pineapple and also Mango and Pineapple and it turned out great.  Thank you

My first review.... My husband loves this meatloaf and asked for it for his birthday dinner.  I like it also, and so does our 16 year old who "doesn't like meatloaf".  I used peach preserves (I could not find pineapple either) but other than that, I just really like this recipe and it is so easy!

I enjoyed this recipe, as it was an interesting change of pace from standard meatloaf. It was just a little too sweet for my taste, so next time I will probably use less crushed pineapple and a little more garlic powder.

I have always hated meatloaf until now!!  This recipe is wonderful.  I couldn"t find pineapple preserves so I used apricot pineapple preserve instead, it was DELICIOUS. Will make again and again. Thank you.

I've always looked for a "really good" meatloaf recipe and never found one until this.  We all loved it.

i didn't follow this recipe to the tee. i couldn't find pineapple preserves so i bought papaya and pineapple jam and maybe because of that it didn't suit my taste.  i didn't even add the brown sugar cause i didn't want it supersweet.  i knew i should of used just plain 'ole ketchup.

Differnt but definitely good. My husband thought is was wonderful and wants me to make it this way from now on. The kids ate every bite too. I didn't have preserves so I used about a 1/4 cup or more of crushed pineapples minus the juice. I also made mini loaves, which worked out well.

This meatloaf is super yummy.  I usually reduce the amount of brown sugar since the preserves are sweet also.  I've given the recipe to others and they adore it too.

I was skeptical considering how little ingredients the actual meatloaf contained.  But it was excellent as written.  It reminded everyone who ate it of really good cocktail meatballs in the form of a loaf.  I would definitely make this again.  It's much easier and much quicker to prepare than my usual meatloaf, which my husband said couldn't be beat.  Well actually, it can't, but the speediness of this recipe makes it worth it.

This turned out well. I thought this meatloaf was very dense. I would probaly add some milk  next time. I added onion soup mix as others have suggested, though I wasn't too fond of it. I might just add onion powder next time. For the topping I used bbq sauce instead of ketchup in it. I couldn't find the pineapple perserves so I used crused pineapple.

This is a great recipe! My husband and I loved it. Since neither one of us like pineapple, we used apricot preserves instead and it was delicious!

When you get a thumbs up from my husband, you know it's good.  He commented on how good the sauce was.  I used homemade peach preserve instead of pineapple and doubled the sauce.  I must say that it took quite a bit longer to cook but so worth it.

This was great!  It made a very sweet tasting sauce.  The only change I made was to the meatloaf itself - used a few more spices like I usually make it.  Thanks for sharing!

That was a very nice change from regular meatloaf.  A nice sweet kick but not enough to make me feel like I'm eating dessert.  Great!

I personally really liked this recipe and my children loved it (but of course they would...lots of sugar.)  My hubby, on the other hand, thought it was way too sweet and he has a sweet tooth.  I think if I make it again I will use half the sugar and maybe crushed pineapple rather than the preserves to cut out sugar there as well.

This was excellent.  I made it with ground turkey and used seasoned bread crumbs.  I couldn't find pineapple preserves so I just used a half cup of crushed pineapples instead.  Perfectly cooked in 40 minutes.

Not to our liking. It turned out too sweet for our taste; and that's before adding the glaze.  No repeat for sure.

Excellent! I added salt, pepper, parsley & some chopped onions to the meatloaf and a squirt of honey to the sauce. Very good! My boyfriend loved it and he's not a huge meatloaf fan... Next time I'll be doubling the recipe because there wasn't enough left over after left over night for sandwhiches!

Very good and easy to make.  My first try at making meatloaf.  After reading some of the reviews I tried it with the Italian Bread crumbs.  Meatloaf was nice and moist.  Only thing I did not like was the pineapple chunks, I was not able to fine pineapple preserves, just pineapple ice cream topping.  My husband also thought the sauce was a little sweet but the meat was very good.

Believe it or not - we had a meatloaf contest.  Each memeber in my family made one recipe.  Two came from this site - and this was the overall winner!   I did find the pineapple
preserves in a regular store after searching 3 others.  I finally went home and called around - so I would suggest doing that first.  I used the meatloaf base from the meatloaf recipe under the HALL OF FAME recipes on this site and used the sauce from this recipe.  HEAVENLY!!!!  You have to try it!

I made this last night and it was really good!  I don't make meatloaf that often but this sounded good.  I used about 1.2 lbs meatloaf mix (veal, beef, pork) and didn't use the full 1/4 cup pineapple preserves or brown sugar, because I didn't want it to be too sweet.  I only had Italian breadcrumbs.  I didn't use a loaf pan either, just a small foil covered cookie sheet.  Thanks!

this is a delicious and easy recipe. i would advise using at least the 93% lean ground beef, otherwise it is a greasy mess! the topping is original and fab...thanks!

This recipe was a hit in my house!  I halved the ketchup with BBQ sauce.  I think this 8 serving recipe would suit only a 4 person crowd though.  My husbands plate was licked clean...this will become my only meatloaf recipe!

This meatloaf was ok but to me tasted like a desert-meat.  It was edible, but  I felt kind of sick afterwards because it was so sweet. it was very easy to make though and my husband thought it tasted exactly like sweedish meatballs and said he liked it.

My husband is *extremely* picky, but said this was the best meatloaf he'd ever had! I didn't have pineapple preserves, but apricot sauce worked just as well. I had 1.5 lbs of beef, and just increased the meat part of the recipe to 12 servings and baked 50 minutes.

Good recipe, the pinapple preserves gave an interesting flavor. My only negative comment is that becuase of the extra sweetness, it was hard to get through leftovers.

Very yummy! I actually screwed up and mixed all the ingredients into the meat except the pineapple preserves. I ended up using just the preserves for the glaze and  it still came out really good.

I have to say, this recipe just didn't live up to all the rave reviews for me. The glaze was so sweet (not tangy) it made the meatloaf taste like one giant Swedish meatball! Don't get me wrong, I like Swedish meatballs but I don't think a meatloaf should taste that way.

Great sauce- I was shocked at how much I liked it as I was a little skeptical when making it.  I agree with other reviews that said the meatloaf itself was boring- I made it a second time adding onion powder and seasoned salt and that really helped.  A friend suggested adding a little ketchup or bbq sauce to the meat itself for some extra flavor which I think I'll try next time.

This was my first effort at meatloaf and I made it for my "soon-to-be" and his mom.  I stuck to the recipe, although increased i proportionally to go with 1.7 lbs of ground beef.  Let's just say there was NO leftovers, it was delicious.  I just served it with some sauteed baby spinach.  The pineapple preserves really added something special--the glaze was out of sight; being a "sauce lover", I kept spooning from the edges of the pan for more.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks Stacy B.

I thought this was the best recipe I have tried.  I changed a couple of things about it though.  I used croutons instead of breadcrumbs, it gives it a few extra spices.  I added 2 tablespoons of onion, but I don't think this was really necessary.  I also used barbeque sauce instead of ketchup.  I couldn't find pinapple preserves, so I just used peach.  It really was yummy and now when my boyfriend asks for meatloaf I can actually enjoy what I am eating.  Thanks!!!

I recently decided to start cooking things out of scratch versus the usual boxxed dinners. So I used this web site to plan a menu for the week ahead of me and this was one of the recipes I chose and boy am I glad!! Not only was it easy to prepare we at the whoe loaf-- my boyfriend and I ALONE! Although I couldnt find pineapple preserves the grocery store only had apricot-pineapple but It was till amazing. This will definatly be a new favorite I use for years to come!!

Awesome recipe!  I used a jar of apricot/pineapple preserves because I could not find pineapple.  It came out very tangy.  It barely fed 4 adults, though, so next time I will double it and make it in a larger pan.

This recipe was the first meatloaf that I've ever cooked!  I was so moist and delicious!  Downright tasty!  I shared it with my boyfriend, and he raved about it.  I did increase the recipe size to 10 servings (1.25 lbs) and used seasoned bread crumbs.  When the recipe was scaled up, I omitted 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. I also used 2 eggs.

This recipe was very good.  I used the advise of another person by combining apricot preserves with pineapple.  I'm not too big on pineapples, but this came out just right.  My kids loved it as well.  I will be doing this recipe again.

This is excellent! I hated meatloaf growing up but this isn't your mother's meatloaf! The secret is the sauce-I've used both orange and pinapple marmalade and both have turned great!

This is my boyfriend's favourite meal! I am not a big meatloaf fan, but he loves this recipe and always askes that I make extra sauce. I use crushed pineapple rather than preserves.It is so easy! Great recipe, thanks! It will be my meatloaf recipe for years to come.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had in my life.  I usually make a double recipie and freeze the leftovers for my husband to have for lunchs during the week.  He requests this often.  This recipie doesn't need to be changed at all, and I usually tweek recipies.  This is great just the way it is.  Highly recommend!!!

I really enjoyed making this meatloaf.
I used oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs and doubled the recipe & ground beef.
I used splenda and used the liquid in canned chunks pineapple. Although I sprinkled more worcestershire sause, about 2tlbs. and used galic salt. Over all my very picky eaters at home loved it, and asked me to make again soon.
When making the last sauce I just poured it buy what I needed, not measuring, just by tasting it:) was great w/a salad & buttered frozen corn.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  From all of the reviews, it sounded like it would be really sweet but it wasn't bad.  In fact, I think that's what my husband really liked about it.  I don't think he's a huge meatloaf fan, but he really enjoyed this sweeter version.  My only problem with making meatloaf (any recipe) is getting it out of the pan.  Any tips for that one??

This recipe was delicious!  I doubled it and cooked in a 9 x 5 loaf pan for 1 hour, 10 minutes.  It was so juicy, and the glaze was sweet and tangy.  Served with rice and was a big hit with the entire family.  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!!

This was a very easy recipe to prepare.  I was wondering where I would find the pinapple preserves but it was found at my local super Wal-mart. My family loved it and there was no left-overs.

I made this hoping to have leftovers for meatloaf sandwiches but no such luck.  The two of us devoured the entire meatloaf in one sitting it was so good.  I also could not find pineapple preserves so I substituted 1/4 cup of crushed pineapples and it worked just fine.
Next time I make 2 loafs!

This was my first time making meatloaf (I have only ever had it in the highschool's cafeteria...yuck!!) and it was GREAT!  I served it with steamed veggies (zucchini, squash and red pepper) and my boyfried and I loved it.  Next time, I will add a chopped onion to the meat.  Thanks!!

I didn't use the pineapple preserves b/c I didn't have it on hand, and substituted instead honey.  It was really good, but as the pineapple may've been the secret ingredient, maybe I didn't get the true flavor of this recipe.  The honey worked well though if you don't have preserves on hand.

This was a huge surprise!  My boyfriend picked it out of the cookbook and I was less than thrilled about it but it was delicious.  People I've told stick their tongue out and say ew (same as I had) but I've convinced them to TRY it and be sure to use the pineapple.  Yummy!

This was a huge hit in my house.  Even my 3 year old cleaned his plate.  I normally do not eat pineapple but this blended in so well that I hardly noticed it.  My husband's only complaint was that I didn't double the recipe because there were no leftovers!

This was excellent. I used lb.ground and 1lb.unseasoned pork sausage. I also used half apricot preserves and half pineapple preserves. Yummy!  Great as a sandwich the next day also. My whole family loved it including mother-in-law. Thanks!   VAE

I am a newly married woman without the necessary ability to cook without a recipe.  I made this for my (very spoiled by his mother's great cooking ability) husband, and though he doesn't care too much for a sweet sauce, he loved it!  I will find another recipe with aless sweet taste, and compare, but I do believe this will be my main recipe.  Thank you

YUMMY!!! My 2 year old and very picky 4 year old loved it! Also made extra sauce and froze it for the next time I make this.  Used pineapple ice cream topping and it worked just fine!  Loved how fast and easy this recipe was!

If your family enjoys extra sauce on their meatloaf, I would suggest tripling the sauce ingrediants.  My family fought for the last ounce of sauce!

This recipe was awesome.  Meatloaf has never been a favorite, but it is now.  I also had to use apricot-pineapple preserves for the glaze.  It turned out wonderful.  This is a meatloaf for everyone to enjoy!  I recommend doubling the recipe for a two night meal (or for sandwiches, whichever you prefer).

My husband, who automatically puts ketchup on EVERY meatloaf, says that would spoil this one.  Excellent!

Turned out pretty well, although it seemed a bit red after only 50 minutes.  I could not find pineapple preserves so also ended up using apple butter also.
