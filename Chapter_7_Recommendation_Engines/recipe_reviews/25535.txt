Not too spicey for my "Ash-ba-gash"! Her asbestos mouth really loved this after school snack. We decided to use cayenne instead of the pepper flakes. Ty thought it was a little too much for her, but she ate quite a bit anyway. Gotta go before my PC bids me farewell again and one of my favorite "I Love Lucy" episodes is on anyway. Hope you had a good trip Mick! Sara, my daughter thanks you so much for this special little treat!

I tried to make it healthy with fat-free butter spray, I don't recommend this method.  It tasted bland even with all the spices and cheese.

I made it as directed and it was ok... T cheese made it a little clumpy. Then i made another batch with the taco seasoning as suggested by another reviewer and it was fantastic!... Without the cheese it was much easier to eat... but thanks for the basic recipe!

Not bad at all...pretty spicy, the cheese does clump together but not one big ball.  Just you get little blobs of it ocasionally.  I added cheese to the warm popcorn (right out of popper) and then poured the butter mixture overtop, maybe the order helped mix the cheese in?  If you want less bite, reduce the paprika.  Also I used maybe 1/3 or 1/4 cup of butter, 1/2 cup would be drowning it imo.

Yum! I added a dash of cayenne pepper and it was perfect. A nice change from regular popcorn. Thanks Sara.

I omitted the red pepper because I don't like spicy and it turned out good. A quick, tasty snack.

The warmth of the popcorn basically made all the cheese clump together. No matter how much I tossed.  I used taco seasoning mix which I thought would not be as spicy for kids. They loved it. And I agree it did have good flavor. But, if I made this again I would not even bother with the cheese.

This was great!  Popcorn is one of my favorite snacks - it is nice to find different ways of making it.  I personally love spicy foods, but I'd suggest cutting back if you are one that does not...this stuff has a nice amount of "bite" to it.  Thanks, Sara, I'll make it often!

Nice change from regular popcorn. Love the cheese in it!  I added a bit of Tabasco to my second batch. Awesome with green onions.

I made popcorn in my air popper while I melted the butter with the spices. I did only make a half batch but I kept the cheese the same amount. Because I was feeding little ones, I cut the crushed red pepper back to a quarter teaspoon (back from a half teaspoon for a half batch) and I added a half teaspoon or so of california ground chili powder. It gives the same flavor as normal chili powder but it's not as spicy. Next time, I'd like to try this idea with homemade taco seasoning and see if that's even better. The kids didn't care either way, I mean CHEESE ON POPCORN.....WHOA. Both my husband and I thought it needed a little more somethin' somethin'.

Really good and tasty snack without much extra effort.  Used Mexican style cheddar pepper jack cheese so omitted the red pepper but added some garlic powder.

Very good and husband ate it up.  Used 1 tsp chili powder instead of red pepper flakes, and added a little garlic salt.  Soggy the next day, I think because of the cheese.  Good without the cheese, too.  Will make it again.

This is pretty tasty!  I used a powdered cheese (made by Kraft) instead of regular cheese, and that gave it the flavor without the sogginess from the cheese.  I took this to a party, so I used the butter sparingly so that it wouldn't get soggy either.  The kids loved it!

I used this recipe as a base for my own version of Nacho Popcorn. Since this was for kids I cut out the pepper, used butter flavored powder, and also powdered cheese flavoring, I let it cool a bit then mixed all together in a large zip-lock. Very easy and tasty. Also tried another batch with some cinnamon, different - but good.

This was good. I used cheese flavored popcorn, and extra-sharp Cheddar. A little bit messy to eat, but so tasty. Thanks, Sara!

The kids liked this a lot. We put each bowl of popcorn in the microwave for a few seconds to melt the cheese and make it stick to the popcorn. Will definitely make again.

No, I could not eat it, I simply had to shove it done my throat and had stomach trouble for the rest of the day. All the cheese clumped up and the spices were not well chosen. I'll probably not make this again, nice idea, but not a good recipe. :)

I didn't have most of the spices, so I just made it without the spices. Still turned out good, but I think the cheese should be melted like nacho cheese.

Not too spicy, at all. I halved the recipe, melting the butter, and stirring in the spices. I poured the spiced butter over the popcorn, and tossed it to coat - THEN I added the cheese, a little at a time, tossing after each addition. Then I microwaved it ~30 seconds to get the cheese melty - and sticking to the popcorn. I rarely eat buttered popcorn, anymore, so this felt a bit greasy to me. Forty years ago, it would have been normal. I will probably try it, again, cutting back the butter, or using my spray butter [to give the spices something to stick to].
