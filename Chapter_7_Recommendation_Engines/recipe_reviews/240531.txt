Super easy and delicious. Used the bacon bits and pre-packaged hard boiled eggs from Costco (heated up the bacon bits in the microwave first) to cut down on prep time and mess.  Fantastic dressing that we’ll use on lots of other salads now, as well.

I came for the onion vinegarette & ended up making the salad. It was quick & good.  I’ll make this again.  Very easy directions using ingredients that are in your kitchen

STOP reading reviews  and make this dressing! 
Loved this! I made the dressing as directed but used 2 tsp boars head deli mustard and 1tsp Dijon in place of mustard called for (not in addition) I also added a few shakes of curry powder and added extra chopped onion but used Maui sweet onion,  for my family's taste. Dressed salad of romaine hearts, chopped tomato and basil with croutons and bacon bits (premade hormel). 
I literally made an all recipes account  to rate this after reading recipes on the site for 5+ years, this is that good!

I scaled this down for a large salad for myself but kept the dressing amounts the same. Now I'll have some on hand for another salad, whether this or something else. I did not have stone-ground mustard, so I tried using spicy brown mustard, and it was still very good. I also added a cucumber. Nice lunch on a summer day!

Just made the dressing so far- it's awesome!  I used an immersion blender and so it's smooth and delicious!  I used about half as much olive oil as it asked for.

In a pinch for time (and realizing that the only onions I had were yellow cooking onions and a red onion that was much too strong) I used Braswell's of Georgia Vidalia and Peppercorn bottled dressing.  I hate to admit it, but it was better than my home made.

This was delicious; both the salad mix and the dressing; my husband also loved it as well.   We will make it again for sure.

This salad is great for a fresh summertime lunch. I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and farm fresh eggs. It was delicious wouldn't change a thing!

I made a few changes which I don't think affect the quality of the salad. I used spinach for the greens and added cucumbers and sliced red onion. I didn't alter the dressing at all and it was fantastic. I had a little left over and used it on another salad. I will continue to make the dressing for other salads. I didn't use any eggs and I don't think they were missed.

This dressing is the bomb.  I put all dressing ingredients in my blender and it made a beautiful creamy dressing that was delicious.  I prepped everything a day before so it was an easy salad to throw together when we were ready to eat.  I made this for a luncheon and this salad was the favorite of everyone.
