I am the queen of starting recipes w/o making sure I have all the supplies. ha ha. No chives so skipped. No fresh basil, used dry. I had a mutsu apple. The cilantro and lime cut down the sweetness of the jicama and mutsu apple. This salsa would be great on many  things, ie bruschetta, tortilla chips, maybe a fajita.

This has a great blend of flavors and is a good alternative to those spicy salsas although I wouldn't hesitate to add diced jalapeno.
