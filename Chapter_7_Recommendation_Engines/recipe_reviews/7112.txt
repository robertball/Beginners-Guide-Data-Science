I really liked these muffins, though I made a few changes. I used whole-wheat flour and omitted the anise seeds and ginger, which I don't like. I halved the recipe and it made 6 small muffins that tasted really good! I'll make these again, but next time with baking soda to make them a little less dense.

The anise seed is very strong and my first try came out tasting like black licorice muffins.  The second time I replaced the anise seed with nutmeg and it tasted better.  The texture is a little too chewy for my taste.

MMMM, MMMM, YUMMY!  These are the most scrumptious apple muffins I've ever tasted!  They're so yummy and moist, I love the texture!  They puffed up so nicely!  I doubled the recipe and still only made 12, they're better this way.  The more apples the better.  Yum Yum.

Although they tasted okay, I found them more like a pound cake then a muffin.  I tried making them twice and they came out the same.  I don't think I will use this recipe again.

I looked up tis recipe on all recipes after going apple picking.  Recipe was easy and was a great way to get my kids to eat apples.  They freeze well also.

I tried this recipe to see how nonfat muffins would turn out. Well it wasn't a big success. The texture isn't muffin-like at all. I won't make this again.

These muffins were awful.  They were dense and the outside was chewy.  They were also lacking flavor (which I don't believe was due to my leaving out the anise seed).  I should have read the reviews first, but was in a hurry to make something to go with dinner and now I'm sorry.

I used whole wheat flour in this recipe. I also added a 1/4 cup of egg substitue (equiv. of one egg) to make them a bit lighter. I did not have any anise but put in the same measurement of apple pie spice. Next time I will add more spices!

Wow! These are fantastic! They came out moist and delicious. Very much like pound cake as some other reviewers said. That's what I was hoping for though! I was worried they'd be rubbery but they came out wonderfully. I left out the star anise since I detest it and subbed nutmeg. I think I'll add a little more spice next time though. That's just cause I like things really spicy! Thank you for an amazing recipe!

I substituted in Whole Wheat flour, nonfat milk, and sugar substitute to fit my dietary needs and they still turned out very tasty! A great breakfast on the run.

I read through the reviews before I made this recipe. I used whole wheat white flour, "soured" milk, I used my own homemade organic applesauce and added one egg, as I was worried about them being a little dry. (The batter was a lot firmer and drier than I'm used to--I make at least three new muffin recipes a week so I'm quite good at spotting a good muffin recipe just by the batter.) I used a full teaspoon of apple pie spice instead of the individual spices only because I did not have anise seed on hand. These did turn out okay but they were a touch dry and I missed some kind of fat in the muffin. The buttermilk helped but I think this would be perfect with a bit of melted butter or vegetable oil and maybe a bit more applesauce. It's close--just not quite there for me.

I used 1/4 cup honey instead of sugar,  soy milk in place of cow's milk, and whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  Anise is a flavor surprise that tastes great! These are heavy, dense muffins, the kind we like!

I made this as a loaf of bread instead of muffins.  Pretty good, just a little bland, but I liked the texture.

Terrible muffins. Followed the recipe perfectly and they came out awful. Bad kind of chewy and stuck to the paper cups.

These were pretty good, very moist. I left out the diced apple since it didn't appeal to me and the anise seed. The texture was a bit chewy and there wasn't very much flavor, but that might have been partially due to leaving out the diced apple. Next time I'll be sure to add more spices and maybe an egg. Other than that, these were terrific!

These turned out quite tough. Maybe the problem was my using a homemade unsweetened applesauce that was chunky, thus giving less liquid than was needed. They were popular with my guy housemate though.

I haven't made these yet (thus the middle-of-the-road rating), but it's going in my recipe box since it looks good.  My son is allergic to eggs and milk, so we have a lot of experience in eggless baking -- when they come out that dense, which is often the case, I up the baking powder and reduce the applesauce and it usually works like a charm.  I'll probably try 3 tbsp applesauce and 2 tsp baking powder (and let you know how it turns out!).

I'm all about these muffins - but I also changed them... I added a bit more cinnamon, and didn't have their spices, so I added cloves and nutmeg instead and mmmmm.  So good.  They were a bit chewy on the outside, but not noticeably.  Super yummy.

I used half white flour, half whole wheat flour.  These muffins turned out way too dense, and incredibly bland.  I will NOT make these again, and would suggest that others looking for a good apple muffin recipie, pass this one up.

I don't think this recipe is even worth ONE star.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they didn't turn out at all.   The bottoms of the muffins burned, and the inside was still mush. Maybe if it was baked at a lower temp, or if you just used a completely different recipe, it would work out. Don't use it.

Good muffins, desner than your average muffin, and more of a thick, almost gooey pound cake consistency.  Good though.  I would add more spices next time.  I only got 10.

Not bad for low fat muffins, but I have made better before. The texture wasnt that of normal muffins, which i personally prefer. Instead of anise seed (not something i have on hand) I used mixed spice
