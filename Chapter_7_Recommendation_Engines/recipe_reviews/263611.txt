Best Pizza ever! 
I'm from Chicago and after one bite of this pizza, my husband and I both agreed this is the BEST PIZZA WE'VE EVER HAD! I watched the video which was very helpful Thank you to the reviewer who reminded to cook the sausage first!  I used 1 tsp of salt and with all that cheese it was still a touch too salty for my taste, so I'll use a little less salt next time. I'd also increase the corn meal to about 3/4 C for starters and use 5 cups of sauce. After reducing the 4 cups, it seemed like barely enough. Thank you!!

Chef John does it again! WITH ONE IMPORTANT CHANGE: I followed this recipe exactly and watched the video, but the sausage was not even close to being done cooking when the rest of the pizza was finished, it was still completely raw. I now precook the sausage before putting it on the pizza. This dough is the best pizza crust I've ever had. I used Chef John's pizza sauce recipe and simmer an extra 30 minutes or so until very thick. TIP: If you opt to cut off the excess dough instead of folding it over, roll the extra dough and place it on top of the layered cheese and sausage, poke holes all over to allow steam to escape, then spoon pizza sauce over the dough with parmesan. Turns this (already fabulous) recipe into a Chicago style stuffed pizza like you’d find at Giordano’s!

I have been making pizza daily for almost 25 years, and I give you 1 piece of advice, pre-cook the sausage, it will release A LOT of grease and will come out better in the pie.

This was delicious! I made chef John’s Pizza sauce and it was awesome. Worth the extra step to make your own. We used ground beef seasoned with Italian seasoning, mushrooms and pepperoni. Will definitely make again.

I made this with whole wheat flour & it turned out good except I would add more sugar to balance out the heavy whole wheat I used. I also used a can of tomato sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, onion powder, and minced garlic for my sauce & it turned out really great.

This pizza dough is amazing. Since we prefer a thin crust I cut the dough in half and froze it. The other half I rolled out and used in the cast iron skillet to make the deep dish pizza. In this way, we had a deep dish without excessive dough. Will make again. I also made it in bread machine on dough cycle instead of by hand.

Very easy to make. I browned the sausage before cooking as other commenters have mentioned, and it turned out great!

It’s is yummy!  We cut the amount of the red pepper flakes in half and added more salt. So far so good.  It’s still simmering but tastey!  Making the Chicago style pizza from Chef John today.......
Chef, can this be made without the cornmeal?  I don’t like that grittiness of it and wish to take it out. Also how many minutes should it be kneaded in the mixer.  My dough was tough.  Thank you!  The pizza was still awesome!

Since the recipe did not call for pre-cooking the sausage, I baked the pizza for 40 minutes and left it rest for 15 after it came out. Sausage was done, but I can see where pre-cooking and draining off excess grease would be a plus to the final product. I also used a canned pizza sauce which, although thick, could have benefited from a spoonful or two of tomato paste for consistency. Very good flavor.

Amazing! I added more corn meal and did not have the same cast iron skillet, so I used two smaller pans - one cast iron, one metal. Both turned out great and so flavorful! Definitely cook the sausage before!

I made this last minute last week. I movie I’ve been wanting to see came out on blu ray so I wanted a meal while I watched. I don’t own a cast iron skillet so I used a round cake pan. The dough was just a tad undercooked in the center but other than that it was delicious. I added pepperoni to mine. I did get myself a cast iron skillet and will be trying this again in a few days.
