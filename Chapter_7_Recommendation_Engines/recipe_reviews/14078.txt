This dish has a great flavor.  I love shiitakes and bok choy!  But it's way too many rice noodles.  They were a huge sticky mess.  I'd recommend using fewer, and adding a little oil to the water you boil/soak them in.

We loved this!. I cooked the rice noodles first, with a drop or two of sesame oil, then added only about 1/3 to the wok. The rest I set aside for placing the vegetable mixture atop. I used fresh chiles and reconstituted, dried shitakes, but followed the time and cooking instructions, otherwise. I have already alerted our produce manager that I will be ordering the chile peppers frequently, as I plan on making this often.

I halved the recipe and I think the proportion of sesonings should have changed. The peppers came on pretty strong (which is a good thing to me!) but it needed a little more sugar, ginger and garlic to balance the pepper.

I somehow missed the reviews before making this and I wish I hadn't. Thank goodness I jotted down the ingredients wrong and only bought 1 package of rice noodles instead of the 2 it called for because there wasn't even enough sauce to cover the one package. I hate it when people change up all kinds of things and then give a recipe a poor rating but my 2 minimal changes were in favor to my tastes and only improved it for me and is nothing personal against the original. I love me some shrooms but shiitake are pricey here right now, they are hard to come by, AND they are probably my least favorite out of all the mushrooms I have tried. With that being said, I used straw mushrooms. My other change was that I replaced 3 of the dried red chile peppers with 3 ripe red fresh jalapenos for the flavor and crunch of it. I agree with the majority of the other reviews and felt it lacked flavor in the end. I love all of the individual ingredients but something was missing. I added rice vinegar and more heat to mine and that wasn't it. I added more soy to hubbys and that wasn't it. I even tried to turn the leftover into a soup and added more seasoning/sesame oil  but the lack of came through in that as well. It is a good concept and makes a very pretty dish but I think it needs too much tweaking for me to attempt again.

This was a great recipe.  I did add a couple hands full of cherry tomatos from our garden and sweezed 1/4 of a lime over all.  I substituted the chiles with one chopped jalapeno seeded.  I could see this recipe with chicken or shrimp and a bit of fresh mint or basil.  Yum.  I will make this again.

This didn't have nearly enough sauce for the amount of noodles called for.  Pretty tasteless as is.

My husband had his boss over for dinner and he is a vegan. Worked great for the dinner party. I would make it again but I would cut the soy sauce in half.

Nothing special.  I love all the ingredients but the flavor just wasn't there.  I doubled the sauce recipe too, and there still wasn't enough flavor.  If I ever make it again, maybe I'll add more peppers.

This was great!! I felt like I was in Korea for a moment. This is a great pasta dish and would go well with kimchee. Just eating the pasta reminded me of the time I was station in Korea and would go all over the country trying this dish!! Thank very much and I am looking forward to making this dish again!!

The Sauce for this recipe was wonderful.   I did add many more types of vegetables.   It was very good and got a lot of compliments from my family.

I loved this recipe.  I did take a few of the recommendations and doubled the sauce and used one package of rice noodles.  The rice noodles will soak up all the sauce so depending on how you like it you may want to reserve some of the noodles and add them to your plate when you are ready to eat it instead of putting them all into the dish.  I added sugar in the raw, just a tiny bit to balance the flavor. I will make this again.  Thank you for sharing.
