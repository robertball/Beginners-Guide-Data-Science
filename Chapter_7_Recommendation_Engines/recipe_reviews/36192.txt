4 stars as written, 5 stars with a couple minor alterations!  I doubled the amount of white chocolate called for.  I used a whole 10 oz bag of white chocolate chips, and melted about 6 oz to mix into the cream cheese & whipped topping mixture.  I also used a whole 8 oz package of cream cheese instead of the 3oz called for and sprinkled in a little more confectioners sugar.  I sliced the berries, & drizzled the remaining 4oz of melted white chocolate on top.  The more strawberries you can fit in your pie, the better it turns out!  A word to the wise though!  Make sure you use the freshest berries you can, and try to eat the pie in as timely as a fashion as you are able to.  Otherwise, you will have a runny strawberry juicy mess!

This was cheesecake heaven.  I used an 8 oz package of cream cheese (was 3 oz. a typo?... I didn't know they made those).  And instead of white chocolate I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips... sooooo yummy!

WOW. Very good.  I decided to make this for Easter and bring to the family gathering.  I did make some minor changes though.  I used low fat ingredients whenever possible, including the grahmn cracker crust and cream cheese.  I also sliced the strawberries into rounds and layered them on top.  When I was mixing it, the batter was quite stiff and hard to mix.  But after chilling for a few hours I think the berry juice softend it a bit & was a bit jiggly.

Very good pie. I did not have my chocolate hot enough so when I added the whipped cream I wound up with huge pieces of chocolate floating around. I ended up rewhipping the entire mix. The pie still was firm when cut into pieces. Wash and dry strawberries,  then dip stawberries into melted milk chocolate or dark chocolate and stick into bottom of pie instead of drizzling chocolate over berries. My method was chocolate covered strawberries sticking out from the pie surface.

If you make this recipe I think the strawberries should be cut into slices and place them flat on top of filling. Good Recipe!

Very good recipe, it was so easy to make. I added some fresh raspberries to the mix for a little tartness. The base was very smooth and not to sweet. Loved it!!!!

This pie is yummy and something different from the usual fruit pies.  We made a few for a cooking project with a group of kids and tried a couple of different variations on the recipe; the favorite was a chocolate crumb crust with both white and milk chocolate drizzled over the top of the berries.

I made this for the second time, for Christmas dinner dessert, and it went down very well!

On my first attempt I didn't think the filling was sufficient, so I used about 1 and 1/2 of the larger (300g) packs of cream cheese, 1 1/4 cups of whipping cream, and added more white chocolate. I didn't increase the sugar, as it was sweet enough. I used a Digestive biscuit base (no Graham cracker crusts in the UK). The result was a very creamy cheesecake-type dessert.

Absolutely luscious!  The recipe is perfect as is-except for the 3 oz of cream cheese I'm sure should be 8 oz.  Other than that I didn't and wouldn't change a thing.  I can't wait to make this for my friends when they come over for football this sunday

This pie was absolutely phenomenal. It was the perfect amount of sweetness to be enjoyable, and the berries contribute a fruity taste. Plus, it was very easy to make--just follow the recipe as is on this site. Adding white chocolate drizzle to the top  greatly helps with the presentation aspect of the pie.

I used a butter pecan crust instead of the standard graham cracker crust, and followed the suggestions for increasing the cream cheese and white chocolate, and drizzling with ss chocolate.  Definitely use sweeter milk choc instead.  Tasty but not worth making again in my book.

This recipe was very easy, fresh and not too sweet.  I cut the berries in half lengthwise as it makes the pie easier to cut and eat.  Also, make sure they are well dried.  I might increase the amount of cream a bit as it didn't quite fill my crust - just to 1 1/4 cup.  A winner!

I rated this four instead of five stars because I made adjustments.  It's a great basic recipe, but if you have  the extra time you can truly make a five star pie!  I used a regular pie crust (refrigerated Pillsbury type) and only 1/3 c. confectioners sugar in the filling.  I also added 2tbsp. milk to the white chocolate to make it melt better.  I think what made all the difference in the world though, is the teaspoon of grated orange zest I added to the cream cheese mixture.  Oh, and I used real fresh whipped cream.   Berries were in season, so I used raspberries, blueberries and strawberries to go with the Independence Day theme I wanted.  Drizzled the white chocolate on top and it looked totally pro.

I made this so many times last summer using strawberries from my garden. It is fairly quick and easy to make but looks so impressive. I usually slice the strawberries rather than leaving them whole. I served this the first time I met my brother's girlfriend and she now requests it whenever they come to dinner. Thankyou for a true family favourite Elizabeth.

After 11 years of cooking/baking for my husband, I made this pie and he declared it was his new favorite.  My whole family loves it.

Though I add a bit more confectioners sugar than recommended.  Still, this is a wonderful pie.

This is a very good, rich pie.  It doesn't make that much filling, so I thought I might double it next time but I'm told by my guests that it would be too much and it's perfect as is!  The white chocolate flavor really comes through.

Made 2 of these for family reunion. They were super! My changes were low fat cream cheese and I sliced my strawberries up as others suggested. I wasnt sure you would taste the white chocolate but you really can. Yummy!

I love this recipe. I make it all the time. I just made some minor changes. I added more white chocolate to the filling the second time I made this. I also tried raspberries instead of strawberries but were great. This pie taste like a very creamy cheesecake. My work loves this and ask me to make it all the time. This one is worth keeping!

This pie is wonderful.  I made it last weekend for a cook out and it was a hit.  I did up the amount of cream cheese, whip cream and white chocolate just so we would have some left over for dipping the extra stawberrys!!!!!  Will definitely make again and again.

I came across my copy of the 1996 Pillsbury version using 4 oz. cream cheese, and a speck of orange rind accent. I like that it is a small recipe for a lighter dessert.

The pie looked awesome!  Unfortunately, I added too much whip cream, based on other reviews.  Although people said it tasted good, it had too much of a whipped cream taste for me.  Next time I'll stick to the recipe first.

This was a really fun and pretty recipe! I did up the filling amounts to fill my crust and I ended up having to blend the whip topping with the beaters becauces things got a little clumpy when I folded. I also sliced my strawberries and added a little shortening to the rest of the chocolate to help it drizzle better. Happy with the looks and the taste! Thanks!

Yum!  This is a great light dessert for the spring/summer time!  The more strawberries the better!  I didn't change a thing in the ingredients.

I made this recipe for friends last weekend.  They absolutely loved it.  It is so easy to make!  They raved all night about this one.
