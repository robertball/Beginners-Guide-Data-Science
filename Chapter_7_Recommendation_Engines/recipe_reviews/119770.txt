We're all getting over colds and needed some "comfort food!"  This was good, but needed a little zip to make it less bland. I made as-is, but added a head of broccoli florets (do not cook beforehand, they get quite mushy during the baking). After baking for 45 minutes, I sprinkled 1/2 cup Mexican cheese over the top, then  covered and returned to the oven for 5 more minutes.  Although I greased the baking dish, this did burn onto the pan a little on the bottom.  Next time I'd bake at 350 degrees rather than 375.

This chicken dish is so very easy to make and toddler friendly!  I used chicken broth instead of water and seasoned the chicken before cooking it with garlic salt, onion powder and pepper.  I also added a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic to the onion/chicken saute (left out the green pepper because I don't like them).

Really good!  Very creamy and comforting.  I didn't plan my day very well, and realized I didn't have much time to cook dinner, so I made this dish entirely on the stovetop.  I simmered 1 cup rice in 2 cups water (covered) for 15 minutes.  While the rice cooked, I sauteed the chicken, onion and green pepper with the spices until the chicken was done.  Then I added the soup (Amy's organic semi-condensed cream of mushroom), but did not add any extra water.  When the rice was done I added it to the chicken mixture and let it all simmer together for about 5 minutes.  I then topped it all off with shredded cheddar and cooked until melted.  A terrific dish in less than half the time!

This is a great weeknight recipe.  Doesn't take long to make, and really is a great amount for 2 people.  We've used a number of cream soups for the base: cream of broccoli, cream of wild mushroom and garlic, etc.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted red for green peppers and didn't saute the broccoli ahead of time.  We made this twice in one week and will definitely make again.  The second time I used almost 1 cup of onion instead of 1/2 - definitely too much, so don't try that! :)

This was a snap to prepare and turned out nicely! I only baked mine for 50 minutes and the rice was perfect. Instead of green peppers I used broccoli... it turned out much too soft, so I wouldn't reccommend sauteing it before baking. Thanks for the recipe!

The title of this recipe fits! Very comforting and exactly what we needed this evening. Doubled the recipe and used a mix of red/yellow/orange peppers in place of green (personal pref) and low sodium chicken stock instead of water. The cooking time was perfect and we really enjoyed the chili powder and paprika. Everyone commented that this is definately a "do again". I'm sure it will be on the rotation often in the cooler months ahead. Thanks for sharing!

I doubled the recipe & had to use 1 can cream mushroom & 1 can cream of chicken. Also threw in 2 small cans of mushrooms. Served with steamed broccoli. Delish!!

Very good for a quick meal! I followed Dianne's stove top cooking method which made preparation very fast and easy. Put chicken in a garlic/lemon marinade all day for more flavor. Decreased rice because we like a more meaty dish, and used 1/4 c. brown and 1/4 c. wild rice. Omitted butter and chili powder and used 98% fat free soup. Served with steamed broccoli. Hubby said it's definitely a make again dish!

Great, easy, fast recipe!  Perfect for a cold night.  Used red pepper as I didn't have any green ones.  Sprinkled garlic powder since we LOVE garlic.  Baked for only 50 minutes since the top was becoming crunchy hard.  My family loved it and will definitely make again.

My family loved, loved this.  I followed another reviewer's suggestions and made it stove top, cooking the rice in my rice cooker and then combining everything together into one pan of creamy goodness.  I used 2 lbs of chicken thighs, b/c it's what I had on hand, and no green pepper b/c we're not huge fans.  A generous helping of good quality paprika and chili pepper were perfect.  This goes into the, "cold winter night" rotation!

If you're thinking that this is just another chicken and rice casserole, you should try this one.  The spices and green pepper make this one differently delicious.  Everyone in the family loved this, and when my daughter went back for more (and it was already gone), she said - you should have made more.  Great meal!

DELICIOUS!  Comforting is the perfect name for this.  I made this last night.  I was in the mood for a chicken and rice dish, and this hit the spot!  I had everything on hand except for the green peppers (neither my husband or I care for them much), and I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup.  Like others, I sprinkled some cheese on the top for the last 10 minutes.  It was good, but I think it would be just as good without it.  The flavor is right up my alley.  Will definitely be making this again.

I made this on a day I was sick and had a sore throat.  This was sooo comforting and felt great on my throat as I was eating it.  Will defiantly be making this again!  I made the recipe exactly as stated.

I baked it in my convection oven instead of the regular oven and it was done in 45min.  I did add mexican cheese on it as one poster did and my cheese didn't come out hard as she wrote & I put broccoli in & it didn't come out mushy.  I find that my convection oven bakes things a bit faster and we enjoy the flavor/texture of whatever we use it for, much better.  This dish is great when I'm in a hurry and is filling.

I made this last night for dinner. Both my husand and I LOVE THIS RECIPE. The spices were perfect, it was creamy, the chicken was tender. Easy, and fairly healthy. Can't wait for leftovers tonight :-)

Great comfort food!  Being from the Southwest I just had to add my touch to it.  I precooked a cup of brown rice in 2 cups of chicken broth, added onion and garlic powder and a 7 oz. can of diced green chilies instead of the green pepper.  Topped it all with shredded colby-jack cheese. Yum!  This is for those that like a little kick and great flavor

sorry - this isn't a review, but a question!  This looks so good and I want to make it - but I really don't care for the cream-based soups because of the sodium content.  Is there anything I can use to substitute for cream of mushroom soup?  Perhaps, though, that takes away from the comfort aspect!  thanks for any advice....

A good, solid comfort-food dish.  I had a little less chicken than called for, so I added a small can of mushrooms to make up for it.  My only issue was getting the rice (I used white, long grain rice) fully cooked.  I stirred the dish once halfway through the cooking time and cooked the dish for an additional 10 minutes and I still had a few crunchy pieces.  I think this would be a good dish to use leftover turkey in, too.

I adjusted the temp to 350 based on comments and will probably still drop the cook time a bit the next time I make it.  My chicken was a little dry, but perhaps I sauteed it too long, or cut it too small.  Still a keeper though, and I will make it again.  Great flavor, perfect for a cold winter night!

I would rate this 4.5 stars if I could.  I did have to make some changes to this for personal taste.  It was bland as is so I had to add in garlic with the onion and pepper and added in garlic and onion powder.  With the additions it turned out great.

This is a tasty recipe, but the rice was still a bit crunchy. Next time I'll cook the rice ahead of time, and maybe add dry onion soup mix for extra flavor.

My husband raved over this dish. It was a little different from my usual cream of mushroom soup, chicken and rice casserole with the green pepper and chili powder giving this a little heat and lots of flavor. It wasn't spicy at all. This made 4 servings. This is a keeper, thanks for sharing your recipe!

I found this to be very average... I added garlic like some suggested and used some broccoli, but to me, the flavors all blended together and made it kind of boring. It didn't taste BAD, but it kind of reminded me of cafeteria slop! Ended up topping it with cheese which helped.  I'll definitely eat the leftovers, but I don't think I'll be making it again.
UPDATE: So since I made a double recipe and had a lot left over, my husband and I thought maybe we should use them to make a chicken pot pie type thing. I decided to add some curry and cayenne to the mixture and then made a basic crust and baked.  It turned out delicious and I topped it with some sambal oelek.  Totally saved the recipe!

This recipes is AMAZING.... IF you tweak it a bit :) Now, Im not the type to tweak it AND than rate. I always follow the recipe as is.The first time I made this recipe I did it exactly what it said. It had GREAT flavor, but for some reason my rice did not cook all the way.Going through the reviews this was the same problem for others.So,the 2nd time I followed ANOTHER review and made everything in the skillet instead of baking it and THAT WAS IT! BUT instead of cooking my rice in the skillet I also had rice prev made. I used about 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (it depends how much I make that night)After my chicken is lightly brown(I saute chicken with butter,veg oil and chopped onions) I add the mushroom soup,cup of water, brocolli, chopped zuchinni,chopped green bell pepper,pre made rice and all the spices.Stir.Sprinkle with shredded cheese, cover and let it simmer for a few minutes... it is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!I hope this helps :)

I added fresh broccoli right before putting in the oven  because so many reviewers did so - but I wish I hadn't.  The broccoli got really mushy.  I think this would have been better as written so shame on me.   I did add cheese because no casserole is comforting without cheese, and would probably add even more next time.  Otherwise stick to the original recipe!

Not comforting!  Dry and mealy.  Did not like the green pepper and the chili powder.  Followed directions except I substituted chicken broth for water thinking it would add flavor.  Will not make again.

Super easy very tasty dish.  I honestly did not expect it to be as good as it was, but I had all the ingredients on hand so decided to try it. Very pleasant surprise!  Thanks for a very easy, inexpensive recipe to add to my collection.

This was a hit with the hubbie and kids!  It is a new regular at our house.  Just what it says, a comforting one dish meal. Pefect just the way it is.  We actually use a bag of "Quorn" brand frozen "chiken" pieces which are meat free and no one can tell!

I made this for dinner last night because it was exactly what I was in the mood for, though I didn't expect my fiance to love it (casseroles aren't really his thing). As it turned out, he loved it so much that he wanted to bring the leftovers to work for lunch today, saying that it was really, really good! The color and warmth from the chili powder and paprika added a lot to this dish.  Only changes: left out the green pepper (didn't have any) and sprinkled on some shredded cheese in the last 15 minutes.  We also appreciated the amount that this made - when you're not serving 8 people, it's a little silly to make enough for an army. The amount that this recipes made was good, allowing for leftovers without filling our whole freezer.   I will definitely make this again.

This was a very tasty comfort food.  Like others I made some adjustments and substituted red peppers for the green peppers, added a can of mushrooms and some minced garlic.  I didn't have time to wait an hour, so I cooked the rice separate and just combined in the pan with the other ingredients.  Very good!

I did not especially care for this.  I made it exactly as written, but my rice did not all get tender.  The overall flavor was like a lot of condensed soup recipes.

I did make some changes but this turned out fantastic!  I quickly prepared this on the stovetop using instant rice.  Homemade chicken stock replaced the water and using a poblano pepper for the green pepper gave this a mexican flare.  Yum!

Made this last night & after cooking for an hour the rice was still completely uncooked! ugh! The flavors were nice & I'll probably try this again with adding cooked rice at the end. Also additions were roasted chopped mushrooms, added broccoli instead of green pepper, cream of chicken & mushroom soup, & garlic powder

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The flavors work very well together and is very "comforting" as said.  I have a couple things I did/would do:  1) I used all ready cooked chicken that I had left over and saved and it still turned out great!  2) Add extra water to the  chicken before baking.  Didn't quite have enough in there to cook my rice all the way.  I used brown rice so that could be why.  Other then than... wonderful!

My hubs made this for dinner last night and the end result was really good/fast/comfort food for a weeknight. The only change we made was to omit the pepper because didn't have any on hand. The next time we make this dish, I will cover it during cooking because for us, the top of the dish became a bit crispy. Ours also cooked in less time - 45 minutes. The only other change I would make is to ensure the chicken is not overcooked on the stovetop. Because it is baked in the oven the chicken has a tendancy to dry out.

Made this tonight, it was delicious!  Since I had no fresh green peppers, I used a can of diced green chiles (we like it hot).  And also had to use broccoli cheddar condensed soup instead of cream of mushroom.  Thank you to previous reviewers; pre-cooked the (brown) rice and made sure to bake the dish at 350.  Wonderful comfort food, thank you Edna!

Delicious! I sauteed a clove of garlic along with the onions and peppers; used cream of chicken instead of mushroom soup; added mushrooms to the mixture and a tbsp of sambal oelek along with the other spices for a little bit of warmth. Yummy.

I love how simple this recipe is to make! The only change I made is to substitute the cream of mushroom soup for cream of broccoli instead; I though it added an interesting flavor to the dish. 
I also once accidentally made it without adding the cup of water and realized that I liked the way it came out just as much, if not more. With the water the rice is definitely fluffier but I found it almost overwhelmingly fluffy, as I like a slightly crunchy texture, so I think I'll only use half a cup of water instead of the full cup. Though any way you decide to make it, this recipe is a winner!

5 stars for the ease of making and the great taste!  Very well seasoned and not your normal chicken casserole flavor.  I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil and omitted the butter when browning the chicken cubes (I used a little over 1 lb of chicken), and used onion powder instead of the onions.  I also omitted the green peppers due to an allergy in the family.  I used cream of potato soup and this worked well (we also have a soy allergy in the family and cream of potato is the only canned cream soup I can find without soy protein, so I use this for all cream soups in my cooking).  Next time I might try to just throw everything together and then bake it without first browning the chicken...hopefully that will work!

This dish was okay - nothing special. I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer because the rice was only about halfway cooked after 55 minutes. This dish takes way too long to cook in the oven for something that is just so-so. Next time I will probably make it over the stovetop as others had suggested, but this recipe will not be used regularly.

Nice easy recipe for beginning cooks like me. Took suggestion from previous reviewer and used cream of broccoli soup. Also, used brown rice instead of long grain white. If you use brown rice, make sure you add extra chicken broth/water. Substituted garlic salt for regular salt.

Not my favorite chicken dish, but the kids enjoyed it.  The leftovers are great for making chicken fried rice.

Good and not overly creamy as most soup based concoctions are.

This dish is really easy to make and is perfect for nights that you want a yummy, no-hassle dinner.  I made the recipe as-is without any substitutions.  It is definitely going to become one of the dishes in my regular rotation.

Excellent recipe. Easy to make. I always make the recipe as written the first time. In the future I will probably double the recipe. My family loved this, wanting seconds!

I used leftover chicken, chicken broth instead of water (a whole can, rather than a cup's worth), and threw in some raw broccoli. baked it an hour, added some cheddar, back in for another 5 minutes. It was okay, I thought it was salty. I wouldn't make it again, but hubby really liked it, so maybe I'll alter it on the next try.

This was a great meal. I recommend seasoning the chicken before cooking. Was out of cream of mushroom so I made cream of chicken. I also threw in some frozen mixed veggies and some shredded cheese before baking.

i really enjoyed this recipe.  I used Chicken broth instead of water and asian "Jasmin" rice which is very sticky.  In the future, I will not use chili powder as the kids and wife thought the rice turned out too spicy.  Good Though!
