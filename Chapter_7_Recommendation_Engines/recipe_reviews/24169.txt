I've been making this for years and it's GREAT!  It's one of those recipes that sound strange and no one can guess the ingred.  It's easy too. It's probably the most requested recipe I ever made.  Double for parties and you can also serve with cut up pita bread. I chop the pepperoni very small in my food processor and I also bake it so the juices get cooked though.  I do re-heat it in the microwave.

This was a great recipe. I have been making pepperoni dip for a few years,but I use cream of celery soup instead.

Mmmm!  So easy & yummy & always a hit at parties.  I also always double this recipe & use the pre-sliced pepperoni & put it all in the food processor, too.  Strange recipe but w/ great results!  "Everything", Onion, Garlic, & Poppy bagels seem to be the faves for dipping choices.  Also so easy to make a reduced-fat version w/ the turkey pepperoni, reduced-fat soup, & reduced-fat cream cheese.  Even boys can't tell the difference!

Hands-down, this is a favorite party food!  Easy and a huge crowd-pleaser!  I like to make this ahead and store in a Tupperware bowl with a lid.  Then I can just spoon about 1/2 into a serving dish and microwave for about 5 minutes.  Once that is gobbled up, I'll put out the other half - otherwise too much grease collects on top.  This is one of my top 5 entertaining recipes - love it, love it, love it!

I made this for a party at work, so I doubled the cream cheese and pepperoni, and added a can of cream of chicken soup along with the mushroom, and served it with fresh bagel wedges. It was a tremendous hit. I was asked for the recipe many times.

I found this recipe to be very salty.  Next time I would try low sodium mushroom soup and unsalted crackers.
However, some of my guests couldn't get enough of it and even took home the leftovers.

This recipe is worthy of TEN STARS!!!  Wow, was this ever good stuff.  Addictive!  Who would ever believe that there was cream of mushroom soup in this dip?  Thanks for sharing, Teejaye72.  This is a real keeper, for sure!

I made it the night before and let it sit, which I would recommend to anyone eating this, because it pretty much just tastes like chunky cream of mushroom soup.  The next day you could actually taste the pepperonis.  However, it still tasted just like cream of mushroom soup.  SO... I threw in cheddar, mozarella, and parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes.  After that, it was good, but even then I wouldn't make it again.  I tried to make it similar to a pizza-taste, and served it with garlic-parmesan pita chips.  Even though there was no other spices added, people complained that it was too salty, and I'm guessing that was from the pepperoni.  I noticed this in a lot of other reviews.  I would not recommend this, especially since there are so many 5-star dip recipes on this site to choose from.

Amazing!  A friend made this for a party and I could not believe how good it was.  I kept asking, "are you SURE that's all that's in it?"  It tastes like there are so many more flavors.  But this will be my new go to party recipe.  Delicious!

I used pepperoni slices and cooked them before adding to the mix.  Then I put it all in the crockpot.  Yummy! And SO very easy to make!

This was great but a little bland for my taste.  (This could be due to mild pepperoni.)   I added a clove of garlic and a tablespoon of mince onion, blended it in the food processor.  Then it was EXCELLENT and very easy.  Definitely a keeper.

Prepared this Dip for our 8-member gourmet group and before too long the members were standing in line to get more.   Served with crackers and slices of garlic/Italian bread.  Will keep this at the top of "favorite appetizers" listing.  RWP

This is one of my favorite treats. I sometimes use reduced fat/sodium cream cheese and soup, can't taste the difference. I don't think you need all the extra fat/sodium since I think the pepperoni pretty much covers it! I also blot it with paper towels once or twice while it's cooking. I'd have to say pita bread is my favorite to eat with this out of all the bread combos I've tried.

I have been making this for years, and every time I go to a party, this is what I am asked to bring.  I make mine in a slow cooker, you can keep it warm for hours on the "warm" setting.  I also use sliced pepperoni and serve with crackers.

Decent, but a bit bland. I don't care for mushrooms, so using cream of mushroom soup may have turned me off to this recipe to begin with. A good start, but you really need some sort of spices to enhance this dip.

I wasn't too excited about the taste of this.  I thought it was rather plain but the guests at my party said it was good, so I give it 4 stars.  I served it with breadsticks.

I made this years ago.  I got the recipe from a former co-worker.  It was a big hit.  I had lost the recipe and forgot about it.  I am glad I found it again.  Everyone always loved this dip. But to make it even easier, we microwave it until the is hot and creamy!!!  Delicious!!!

My coworker brought this in and let me just say, I couldn't stop walking back for more. It goes well with tortilla chips or sliced veggies.  She used Cream of Celery soup instead, which gave it a little "greenness" to the savory pepperoni taste.  She also put the pepperoni in a food processor and mixed all the ingredients over a stove until well combined, which seems so simple! I am definitely going to bring this in to any future potlucks or parties I have.

It was yummy!  Hubby didn't like it.  I think because it was too cream cheesy.  I used the food processor.  Kids wanted seconds!!

I've always loved this dip! I buy a large pepperoni stick and shred it on a cheese grater for more even distribution of the pepperoni. Sometimes I add a little shredded cheddar to the top, too. It's also good as a cold dip (after it's been baked).

Excellent - I ran pepperoni AND mushroom soup through the food processor because I don't care for the texture of mushrooms but I think the taste is essential for this recipe. On the second try I also added finely minced vidalia onions and finely chopped black olives.  Excellent pizza flavor! Thanks!

I made this for our holiday snack bar at work.  All us nurses gobbled it up.  I put all the ingredients in my mini slow cooker to keep it warm all shift.  I I also served pretzel rods and ritz crackers instead of the bagels.

This recipe was so easy to fix!  It tasted great.  I served it with cut up pita squares.  The dip is real filling and I felt the pita squares were too much.  They were dry.  I think I will try this stuffed inside celery the next time I make it.

I love this dip! To save time, I buy the pre-sliced pepperoni and throw it in my mini-chopper. I also prefer for this to be baked a bit longer - 25 - 30 minutes and browned on top. Delicious! Everyone always asks for the recipe!

I was looking for something quick to make to take to a football party and ran across this.  I thought it sounded a bit odd but I was in a hurry and this sounded so easy.

I had a 6oz package of pepperoni so that's what I used and because I was taking this into work for a potluck I cooked it on the stove and thinned with a little milk so it would have the right consistency at room temp.  After tasting I thought the mushroom soup was a little to prominent so I added a clove of grated garlic and 1/4 tsp each oregano, thyme, and marjoram.  It was perfect served with bite size pieces of onion bagels for dipping.

I made this using fat free cream cheese, 98% fat free cream of mushroom and a store bought natural casing pepperoni stick. I think when I make it again I will drop to 1.5 cans of the soup though! It's delicious!!

Great dip. I made a few enhancements though. I added garlic powder, oregano, parsley, and sharp cheddar. Then I covered the dip in sharp cheddar before cooking it. It was delicious.

I fixed this for Super bowl Sunday and it was too salty. We do not use salt at all in our home and add the chips to it and toooo muchy.

This is the best.  I've been making it just this way for about 5 years now.  Thanks to a friend.  It's always a hit and perfect for watching football on the weekend.

I've been making this dip for years! It's so simple but absolutely everybody loves it. Only thing I do different is I use warmed italian or french bread chunks instead of bagels. Never fails to shock and awe!

This is absolutely one of the best dishes ever! I make this for every get-together and it's everyone's favorite. When people hear what the ingredients are, they are so surprised how good they go together.

I just made this for a get together at my home, something quick and easy.  While I was preparing it, my friend looked at it and was grossed right out. But the next day while I had it in the crock, she tried it, then couldn't stop eating it.  If SHE liked it that much, then it 5 stars all the way.  Just be careful in the crock.  I had to keep switching it on and off so it wouldn't burn.  AWESOME!!!!! This will be my new signature dish.

This was a huge hit.  I got pepperoni from the deli counter and chopped it up in the food processor.

This was something I tried just because I had all the ingredients on hand and need something to put together for a last minute get together!  I thought it would be 'good'....but everyone thought it was GREAT!  Who doesn't like pepperoni??  I baked some Tastefully Simple Beer Bread, let it cool and then cut it into small chunks - delicious combination!!!

I have been making this recipe for a few years.  It is always a hit at functions.  Everyone always asks for the recipe.  I serve this dip with tortilla chips.
