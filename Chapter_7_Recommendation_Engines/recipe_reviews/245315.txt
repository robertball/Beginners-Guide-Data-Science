When we made it we didn't have enough lime juice so we used one lemon but otherwise followed the directions. Super good! Amazing for anyone who likes a sweet and tart dessert. But if you only leave it in the refrigerator for only 20 minutes it is still sort of soft.

I made this to the recipe. Was delicious. Tart and sweet. I love that it's dairy free. My family loved it.
