FANTASTIC! I just made this for dinner tonight, and wow was it tasty!  I like a little extra lime flavor, so I juiced 2 limes instead of one.  I mixed the lime juice, garlic, basil, salt, and pepper together all at once, then put them in a ziplock type freezer bag.  I trimmed the pork, then added it to the marinade.  I let it marinade for about 5-6 hours.
What a tasty dinner!  Thank you for posting it!

I can't wait to try this since we grill pork chops a lot.  The one thing I can add is that I never grill chops over direct heat.  It can make them tough.  I always turn on the gas grill and heat it up but when I put the chops on the grill I turn off the burners on the side where I place the meat.  Just keep the lid closed and the internal temp will cook the chops without making the meat dry or tough.  It will take a bit longer but it's well worth the wait.

Made this recipe for dinner last night and it was really good. I didn't have a lime so I used a lemon and it was still the acidity that was needed. I grilled on gas BBQ and my husband loved it. He doesn't usually like basil but I went for it and he really liked it. Yeah! A new staple for my household. Thank you!

Wow!  This was great.  Had a lemon, so I used that instead of the lime.  Marinated three hours in a ziplock bag.  I turned the bag every half an hour or so.  My family just kept moaning while they ate!  Maybe next time I will use a lime.  Maybe I'll try this marinade with chicken breasts.

I marinated overnight and really enjoyed this, although it's difficult to keep the pork from getting a little tough.  I wasn't sure about basil with pork, but was pleasantly surprised.

Basil Garlic Pork Chop Haiku: "Not my favorite. I'd have preferred cilantro, over the basil." I followed the recipe exactly, (marinated for about 4 hrs.) and wasn't blown away by the grilled results. I noticed that several of the reviewers said that they replaced the lime juice w/ lemon, which, maybe it something that I would've liked better. (Either that, or swapping basil for cilantro.)  But as the recipe's written,  I just didn't feel that the lime jived w/ the basil for my tastebuds.

These are great! I used Lemon juice instead of the lime cause it is what I had on hand. I put them in a ziplock bag and let them marinate for appx an hour. They came out juicy, moist and delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I marinated 7 chops, so used 1/2 cup chopped basil, 4 cloves of garlic and 2 limes. It was plenty of garlic for me, and I like garlic. Mixed everything together and marinated in a zip lock bag for three hours, turning frequently. So good, made for company and they were a big hit. Served with twice baked potatoes, also in allrecipes.

Fixed exactly as written, except marinated for about 2 hours before putting on the grill. Great flavor! Chops were tender and moist. Will keep in my Favorites file and put in the rotation. Hard to find a good grilled pork chop recipe that comes out moist. Thanks!

Pretty good. I used 2 tbsp of lime juice and 1 tbsp of dried basil to approximate what the recipe called for, but I only used 1 clove garlic. I grilled them for 4 min each side on the BBQ, and finished them off in a 400 F oven because they were thick cuts, until the centers reached 160 F.

This is a wonderful marinde. My wife is from Brazil, so the limes were used as directed. The chops browned well on the grill and stayed nice and moist!
She did add some fresh rosemaryas a compliment and that worked nicely.

Came out great! Replaced basil with oregano, used mojo (sour orange) and added more lemon juice.  Marinated over night instead  When it was almost done cooking, added some A1 sauce and put it to broil for the last few minutes.  That gave it a tingly taste to it. Thanks for the Recipe!

Great recipe simple and delicious. I  modified it a bit by using lemon juice instead of lime and also added olive oil and used as a marinade. I marinated it for 4 hours and grilled it up and was super delicious. I would highly recommend this recipe.

It was missing something! I used 1 1/2" boneless pork tenderloin, added some oil and doubled the lime juice, as someone suggested, and let them marinate for about 8 hours in a Ziploc in the fridge. Next time, I'll double the basil and add salt and...something else, not sure what.

This recipe is amazing and SIMPLE.  I marinated my chops with the garlic and basil for 24 hours and then added the lime juice an hour before grilling.  An additional hour or two with the lime would be outstanding.  Regardless, the flavors are amazing!!!!

This recipe just didn't have enough flavor for our taste. It needed fresh basil on top to get the taste of basil, and the garlic was light. The lime flavor with the garlic and basil was an interesting idea, just not enough punch with these quantities. I might try this again with more basil and garlic, and shake it up together with the lime juice prior to basting.

It was totally awesome. I did have to change things around a bit though since I didn't have lime, I used bottled lemon juice and I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried and no fresh garlic, so I used crushed from a jar. I put the chops into the marinade still frozen and left them overnight. The smell of the garlic was awesome. I turnd the chops in the marinade ever so often. 

I brushed some BBQ sauce on 2 of the 4 chops  just befor they were done cooking, so we could compare the flavors. Don't know which one I liked best.

Thank you so much for the recipe - this one is a keeper.

This tasted very good but I didn't have enough time to marinate for more then 30 minutes.  Next time, I will definately marinate for much longer.

Loved the flavour, but they came out a bit dry.  Probably I should have used a thicker chop.

This was delicious!  I used pork loin chops, which took a little longer to cook on the grill, but they still came out juicy and delicious.  Husband and 6yo son approved.  Very simple and easy to make. Great alternative to fried pork chops!  Will definitely make again!

This was very tasty and simple to make. Always looking for a way to use that extra basil from the garden and the flavor comes out perfectly. We actually marinated it overnight and it was perfect!

Simple and delicious but I decided to use cilantro instead of the basil (as another reviewer suggested). I also added 1 tbsp. of vinegar. It turned out amazing!!!! The cilantro paired with the lemon was simply delicious!

I put in more lime (because I really like the flavor) and the pork chops were FANTASTICALLY tender. This was a great meal!

Just okay flavor wise. I marinated for 24 hours so the pork was very juicy and tender. Will probably not make again.

Super fantastic recipe!  My family LOVED these pork chops.  I made the recipe as stated.  I am making it again today . . . plan on doubling the lime as others have suggested.  Just don't overcook the pork.  :)

This marinade was AMAZING! We didn't have pork chops on hand, just some grocery store frozen chicken, and it even made those tasty and tender! It was simple, ready in a flash, and tasted great.

These were ok.  I have lots of pork chop recipes that are family faves so I probably won't make again but I am glad I tried them.  Easy to make.  I did marinate all day and added some oil like another reviewer said. Thanks for sharing Gina-Li

I made this exactly as written the other night for dinner, it was so refreshing!  Different from other recipes and so easy!  I always do my pork chops medium on the grill so they come out very tender, my husband and I both enjoyed the flavor!

This was pretty good, but very mild for flavor.  Used extra basil even.  Since we ony have fresh basil during the summer months (grocery store stuff isn't as good as just picked), I probably won't keep this recipe.

Wow, I would have never thought to try the combination of lime and fresh basil, so I am very glad I found this.  It is great for grilling chicken breats too.  I just add a tablespoon of olive oil.

These pork chops are so moist and flavorful!I followed the recipe except used bottled lime juice as that was all I had. You can taste each ingredient,and it all blends in so nice. They tasted terrific as left overs,too! Just warmed them up in the oven.  Thanks for sharing as I will be making this recipe again and again!

Marinated for approximately 2 hours. No changes to the recipe. Found it still a bit on the plain side. Tastes like a greek style pork.

totally awesome recipe.. unfortunately i didn't have any limes.. so i had to use bottled lemon juice :( but it was still very tasty.. i used about 1 tsp of season salt for the salt and pepper.. on a side note.. some ppl should stick to writing haikus.. cooking isn't for everyone

Super easy and dee-lish! Thanks for a wonderful recipe. I gave 4 stars because cooking them to 145 degrees overcooks them a bit. I cook pork to 138-140 and let them rest 5-10 minutes for best results. Thanks again!

I resisted the basil with all my heart! I've made pork chops with the same ingredients except for cilantro for years. When I saw basil, I thought, "no way"! Then I discovered I had no cilantro, so I couldn't wuss out. I used dried basil (lots of it) for the marinade, ramped up the limed juice (four limes) and put fresh-snipped basil on top as a garnish.
This is a fantastic combination of flavors! As much as I love the lime-cilantro combination I may favor the lime-basil even more. It's SO unusual and really really good!

Really delicious, thanks for the recipe. Since it is not grill time here yet, I made them on a skillet. My husband likes meat to go with a sauce or gravy, so I used 20g tomato concentrate and 2dl of cream (18%fat, much lighter than half and half) to use the rest of garlic, basil and meat taste from the pan. It was a hit.

These were very refreshing! I used a little more two limes but, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Don't overcook. They cook up fast. Thanks for sharing!

We had company over and served these - they were  a big hit. The lime juice soaked in enough to make the meat tender, not sour. Definitely a keeper!

This was ok. Meat was nice and juicy. I didn't think basil went to well with pork until I put some tomatoes on top. That was an improvement. I'd make this again but leave out the basil.

I wasn't that impressed with these.  The lime flavor was too strong.  I would try them with lemon next time and see if that helped.

Finally had a chance to make this recipe.  Used fresh pork chops and marinated overnight; using 1 extra clove of garlic (5 total) using up what I had on hand.  Cooked the chops indoors with my grill pan since it is raining out side and I think it kept the meat juicier.  Everyone loved it; very flavorful, will definitely make this again.

Wow. Simple recipe that wow’d the crowd!  I marinated it in 30 min too and it turned out amazing. I brined the chops 30 min before putting the life, garlic, basil on to marinate. I think the brine really is essential.

This is an excellent recipe. The flavor combination is delicious.  I had 1 inch thick pork chops and I marinated them for approximately 6 hours in a glass bowl turning them several time. They grilled beautifully. I cooked them until  just barely pink in the center and they were very tender. This will definitely be in my recipe rotation file.

These were juicy and tasty pork chops., and I’m a new cook on a grill. It’s easy to dry pork chops out but I think the lime tenderized the meat. All the flavors were great. I added a few extra shakes of garlic powder and olive oil so chops wouldn’t stick. I let it sit overnight. It was excellent.

Followed ingredients and instructions fully. It was tender and had a great basil flavor but the lime was a little overpowering. It was a great marinade and I will do again but with only half a lime and I’ll add onion.

I pan fried this due to temperatures outside.  It was fabulous and juicy!  Added some capellini noodles on the side to it.

I added olive oil along with the lime juice. The pork chops grilled just perfect. I had the grill on the lower flame and did the indirect approach, slower grilling. Good flavor, family liked them, will make again.

This is the best pork chop marinade ever. I bought 2 of the bone in chops - about 14 ounces each - used the juice of 2 limes, added a 1/4 cup of vegetable oil as another user suggested, a dash of red pepper flakes, and marinated for 2+ hours in fridge. The pork was most tender - much like a tenderloin. Will definitely make again

Very moist and nice lime flavor. I used 2 limes as another person suggested. I even overcooked it and it was still great. I marinated for about 2 hours then "grilled" them on a grill pan on the stove getting nice grill marks on both sides. Then I popped the pan in the oven at 350 degrees til it registered 160. I. Will definitely make it again since I love basil and my basil plant is prolific!

This recipe was delicious. I did not make it on the outdoor grille, though. I cooked it in  my oven on the BROIL setting for about 12 minutes in total. I used fresh basil from my herb garden.

I used 9 boneless chops.  I used 1/2 cup fresh basil, 4 cloves of garlic, 4 Tablespoons of lime juice, salt and pepper. I added 1/4 c olive oil to the marinade as it seemed dry and I thought would have had to add oil while grilling anyway.  They came out so appealing off the grill with the basil and small pieced of garlic on each one.  Very simple but flavorful recipe.

How fun is it when your AllRecipes e-mail knows you have an ingredient that needs to be used?  I was trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my fresh basil, and this was just the thing!  So delicious!  This is going on the summer rotation for sure!

I made  this way, it was good, but not a huge lime fan.  Substituted the lime with EV Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar. Place all flat on a dish, ziplock, or, I prefer a large tupperware because I can bring stuff back in the house with it.First put a little EVOL on the chops, then salt and pepper, garlic, basil, flip, repeat.  Drizzle each side with Balsamic, spread with a spoon or finger, just cover each side, a little goes a long way.  Let it sit in the fridge or counter covered for at least 30 minute, longer is better.  Take it out of the fridge and let it hit room temp, 15 minutes or more while the grill heats to high for thick (greater than 3/4 inch) chops.  One minute on high covered, flip, one minute on the other side on high.  Then, lower to medium, turn each chop a half turn for grill marks, 3 minutes.  Then lower a bit more or stay at medium if preferred, grill opposing side with complimentary grill marks 4 minutes...remove from heat, place in tupperware, cover, let sit at least 5 minutes, longer better, let the juices run.  A little longer for super thick chops at the lower settings is OK, but not really necessary, they continue to cook while they rest covered.  I make chops with anything though, beer, Coke, Root Beer, Ginger Ale, coffee, any juice, hot peppers (Ghost peppers almost killed me in a goodish way and peppers were fully removed,  used only to marinade), brown sugar, rubs, etc...but as this recipe stands, it is good on chops if you like lime.

This wasn't as flavorful as I expected, but I used dried basil and broiled instead of grilling. I'll try again with fresh basil.

I made this last night. I cut up a pork roast into 8 pork chops and this recipe was great for chops on the grill. It had a lot of flavor and everyone in my family loved it. I marinated it for 2 hours and it turned out well. The fresh basil was surprisingly good with the lime and garlic. This recipe is a midweek meal keeper!

Made this tonight for dinner,  I also juiced 2 limes for 4 bone-in chops. I combined 1 1/2 tabs of olive oil, with the rest of the ingredients. Put all of it in a resealable storage bag and marinaded for about 35-40 mins. They were really yummy!  Great recipe!

I found this to be very bland, and the basil didn't really fit.
