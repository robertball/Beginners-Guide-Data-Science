I used the basic recipe as inspiration, though I'm sure, for a quick sandwich, this recipe is great (and why I gave it 5 stars).

Here are my adds/changes:  Used sliced challah instead of English muffin, buttered the slices and browned both sides in a saute pan.  Remove the slices and browned up a couple more for side toast (for the eggs).  Spread a thin layer of mayo on two toast pieces, topped with thinly sliced avocado, topped that with thinly sliced Swiss cheese, returned these to the saute pan and put under the broiler until cheese just melts (don't want hot avocado).  Removed from broiler and dabbed cheese with dijon mustard, then topped with thinly sliced ham and two soft poached eggs. Sprinkled with salt, ground pepper and a sprinkling of chopped parsley.  Very pretty on the plate and yummy to eat.  Nice flavors.
