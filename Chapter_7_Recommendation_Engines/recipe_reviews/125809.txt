As moose isn't a big thing here in PA, I used this recipe on a rump roast.  It is great!  Taste is good and meat is tender from the slow cooker.  Will definitely make again!

Very easy and tasty! I soaked the roast in buttermilk overnight just in case it tasted gamey (my roast had been sitting in the freezer for several months). I only had a two pound roast so I halved the recipe but next time, I would use the entire jar of pepperoncini peppers, not half.  I also did not have beef bouillon cubes so I sprinkled bouillon inside the cuts before inserting the garlic. I would also decrease the bouillon next time; my roast was salty enough with the Worcestershire sauce  and italian dressing mix. In summary, increase the pepperoncini peppers (not juice) and decrease the bouillon (salt).  Will definitely make again!!!!

This is an excellent recipe for moose that I will be sure to use over and over again! I am not a big fan of moose so I wasn't really looking forward to it but this was really delicious. I didn't have any bouillon cubes so I just sprinkled some of the powder over top and I loved the pepperoncini flavour!

This is not for the faint of taste buds.  The pepperoncini give it quite a kick, but it is very good.  I made with vension.  Reheats well, too.  In fact, my boyfriend is taking leftovers with him hunting this weekend!

Excellent flavor, everyone loved it.  Leftovers were even better the next day.  Always looking for good recipes for moose and will use this one again.

This is amazing! Say goodbye to the traditional assortment of appetizers...This year it was our turn to host the annual neighbourhood New Year's Eve Party and I just couldn't look those appetizers in the eye after countless Christmas Parties so I served this recipe with sliced baguettes, shredded cheeses such as Cheddar, Jarlsburg, Swiss and assorted mustards.  

I served Cinnamon Whiskey (Fireball) and homemade Almond Cream Whiskey to change the palate for the other dishes on the table and what a hit.  "Totally Awesome" and "Freakin Amazing" were frequent comments!

Used half the amount of bullion cubes and only 2/3 of the jar of peppers. Also removed the garlic cloves as I was shredding the meat. Used the recipe on a tough moose brisket, turned out great! Even my Canadian friends loved it. Froze what was left, and it was even better upon reheating.
