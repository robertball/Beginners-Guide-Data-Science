Two words for this cake. Yum Yum. It was delicious and since i am not a fan of whipped cream I opted for a cream cheese glaze and sprinkled with chopped pecans. The recipie for the glaze is
1 ounce cream cheese
1/2 cup of confectioners sugar
2 to 3 tsp of milk
1 tsp of vanilla extract

Blend all together until smooth. drizzle over top of warm cake.


***** UPDATE *****
My best friend and her fiance love this cake so much that next month i will be attempting to make this cake into a 3 tier stacked wedding cake to serve 75 people! Wish me luck!

This is moist and delicious.  I used French Vanilla cake mix and Jell-o Pumpkin Spice pudding mix and it was awesome!  For a glaze I mixed 5oz softened cream cheese, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla with ~3 tbs orange juice.  YUMMY.

a snap to prepare, presents well, and very moist without being heavy dense.  I subbed applesauce for the oil, and added more pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, clove, allspice, and nutmeg.  Couldnt taste the butterscotch pudding; I think it just helped with the texture and moistness.  Rose very high.  My oven usually bakes either slightly slower or spot on, and the time would have been too long in my oven.  It was done in 45 min.  Used a 10x sugar glaze w/grated orange zest.  Complimented the cake well and tasted like a homemade spice cake.  This did not leave any trace of cake mix taste behind.  Thanks for the recipe. If you like a bit more spice, I would suggest at the very least, doubling the spice.

As I expected from a pudding-enhanced cake mix, this was a very moist cake - no surprise. What I didn't expect was how well this recipe was able to mask that tell-tale cake mix taste! (Maybe it was the butter recipe cake mix I used?)  I doubled the amount of pumpkin pie spice and it turned out to be the perfect amount. This is not as sweet as most cake mix cakes, most likely because of the pumpkin, so I'm glad I chose a substantial cream cheese glaze which was the perfect complement - 4 ozs. cream cheese, 1 T. butter, 2 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 2-3 T. milk - enough to make it thick yet still pourable.  This is a  pretty, pleasantly spiced, and unmistakably pumpkin cake, and one that cries out for a cream cheese frosting or glaze. Note: Be cautious on the baking time - I set my oven for 45 minutes and it was done!

Great cake, although I would like even more pumpkin taste. It might have been enhanced if I had butterscotch pudding, but all I had was white chocolate. I added 2/3 cup cinnamon chips. I baked it a little too long (a little dry) but that was my error. I dusted the pan with white sugar, and it made a nice crunchy crust. Great idea, and I will make again!

This cake was delicious.  I added 1/2 cup of walnuts and baked for only 47 minutes.  I also microwaved a 1/2 cup of cream cheese frosting(any brand) for 30 seconds and poured on top of cooled cake.  Good alternative to pumpkin pie.  Will make again!!

I'm glad I found this receipe at this site. I originally got the recipe from a BJ's magazine but somehow lost it. I will make this cake again for Christmas it's great and the butterscotch pudding makes it extra moist.

Very moist cake!  Made this last night for dessert and got lots of compliments.  Followed the directions for the cake, baking for 50 min.  Then drizzled cream cheese frosting (store bought) over the top.

My husband and daughter both give this a two thumbs up.  I did use a reduced sugar yellow cake mix and sugar free pudding, and my husband said he thought it was awesome.  The cake was moist and flavorful.

Yummy! I didn't have a two-layer mix, but I did have two single layer Jiffy mixes so I used those. I used 4 TBS applesauce and 1 TBS oil, just over the cup of pumpkin, and the Pumpkin Pie Spice II recipe off this site. I forgot to flour the pan, but it barely stuck at all after being sprayed liberally. It took just over an hour to bake (next time, I'll raise my oven to 375), and I drizzled it with the frosting from Pumpkin Cookies with Penuche Frosting (using less icing sugar so it's more of a glaze). Fabulous and moist! Thanks so much, Lucille!

"Probably one of the best cakes you've ever made" said Hubby.  :))
I was looking for a spice cake recipe using a cake mix and this was it.  I used Spice Cake Mix instead of Yellow Cake Mix.  I put in one Tbs Pumpkin Spice instead of two teasp.  For the icing I mixed a dollop of cream cheese with powdered sugar, vanilla, almond extract and milk.  I also added sprinkle of Chai Spice to it.  The icing was the weak link in that I had lumps of cream cheese in it but obviously that's not the recipe's fault.  
This cake has a solid texture that I love without being heavy.  It's a little fluffier than I'd like right now - I like a pound cake texture - but I bet the second day it'll firm up even more.

I'm looking forward to making it again real soon.

Update: I've made it again this time following the recipe with the Yellow Cake Mix and the Butterscotch Pudding.  I still put in 1 Tbs Pumpkin Pie Spice though since we like our spices.  And I was generous with the pumpkin puree too - about 1/4 cup more than the 1 cup in the recipe.  I followed another reviewer with the modified penuche icing and it was amazing!  I am addicted to this cake now with the new icing.
Bring to boil 1.5 Tbs butter and 1/4 cup brown sugar packed, stirring.  Cool slighly and mix in 2 Tbs milk.  Then mix in gradually until you have the consistency you want, up to 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar.  Pour over cake.  Delicious!!!!!

Excellent cake! It was incredibly moist and came together very quickly. I accidently picked up a golden butter recipe cake mix but I think that just added to the goodness. I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice so i just used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon of ginger (mixed it in a little bowl before I added it to the batter).  I also drizzled a can of cream cheese icing on top (after mixing in a teaspoon of vanilla to help get rid of that ready-made taste) and everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again. Now I just need to find out what to do with the rest of the can of pumpkin. 1 cup of pumpkin only used a little less than 1/2 the can.

Just what I was looking for!  I did use the pumpkin pudding not butterscotch and it was a hit for my crafters weekend.  Good for breakfast, lunch AND dinner!

The only thing I did differently was double the amount of pumpkin pie spice-I like the taste of pumpkin pie spices. This is very easy to put together and baked up nicely, rising up to a nice height. I loved the wonderful pumpkin pie spices and “pumpkin” aroma filling up my house while baking. The cake baked a nice brown even color and was done in 45 minutes. I cooled it for 30 minutes before removing from the pan. It was moist and tasty, spiced just right. The cake itself is light, not dense and almost “fluffy” like. What really surprises me is that it actually takes like a homemade spice cake. It must have been the pumpkin spices and butterscotch pudding that helped to mask that “cake-box” mix taste or a combination of all these ingredients. Right before serving I dusted this off with some powedered sugar which compliemnted the cake well and made for a nice presentation (see my picture in the gallery). My family gobbled this up especially hubs who said, ”Very good.  Make 'em just like this from now on!”

I made this cake twice last fall...there was nary a crumb left either time!  I frosted it with cream cheese frosting once and glazed it another time.  For potluck at work this week I'll be making cupcake versions!  I do sub apple sauce for the oil with no issues and i pump up the spices to 3 tablespoons total.

Excellent! Followed the cake recipe exactly as written (with butterscotch pudding instead of the pumpkin spice kind) and it turned out wonderfully. I also topped it with a glaze posted by one of the other reviewers -- 5 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 3 tbs orange juice -- and it complimented the cake very nicely.

I made this recipe as cupcakes. They were good, but I wasn't impressed with the pumpkin flavor. I thought the pumpkin was over-powered by the butterscotch, and I even added 1/2 Cup more pumpkin. I served the cupcakes with cream cheese icing, and it made them taste much, much better. Good recipe, just not the best if you want something with a lot of pumpkin flavor.

One of the reviews I read said that they added more than 2 tsp. pumpkin spice and it was perfect. Taking that as a guide, I added about 1 tsp more pumpkin spice but it still was too bland for my taste. My husband thought it was ok but "not worth getting fat on".  I don't think I will be making this again.

This cake is DELICIOUS! I used the cream cheese icing (the recipe is in one of the reviews). I could not find canned pumpkin (I am hearing that there is a shortage due to bad crops last year), so I used yams. I mashed candied yams by hand until they had the same consistancy of canned pumpkin. I then added 1t. ground cloves, 1t. nutmeg, 1t. pumpkin pie spice, and 2t. ground cinnamon. I used this mixture in the recipe as a substitute for the canned pumpkin. The cake tastes amazing! The only thing I will do different next time is wait to cut it until my guests arrive. This cake is very moist, and crumbles- so presentation is not as nice. Thank you Lucille for this wonderful recipe!

I made this cake with a reduced-sugar white mix and sugar-free vanilla pudding mix; I left out the oil and water, and just used a whole 15oz can of pumpkin (I figured this would be fine because I've tried another recipe somewhat similar to this one, which just used cake mix and pumpkin puree - nothing else!) I used four egg whites, and added a cup of chopped pecans. The batter was very thick, and I had to increase the baking time to a little over an hour. This made the most moist and delicious cake, and probably as nutritious as cake can get, although you wouldn't know that from tasting it. I highly recommend trying this. Pumpkin really holds moisture and pecans make a great match.

This is a great recipe.  Very easy and a crowd pleaser.  I added a whole can of pumpkin, instead of just one cup.  I also added about 1/2 cup egg nog.

The pumpkin flavor I have been looking for! I used instant vanilla pudding because that's what I had and doubled the pumpkin pie spices and it came out moist with a delicious pumpkin flavor! Perfect cake for autumn, I'm enjoying it now with some hot tea for breakfast. It was done after exactly 55 min for me in a silicone bundt pan. I love how easy it was to throw together. This will be making an appearance at my Thanksgiving table!

Oh my goodness, this was so delicious! I'm a huge fan of pumpkin, and this just made my day!  I used a French Vanilla Cake Mix, and vanilla fat free pudding. I used applesauce and eggwhites to make the cake fat free, and used free cool whip for frosting. Will definitely be making this again!!

Very good and easy. I had some extra pumpkin from the soup I made last night so I decided to make this to use it up. I used just nutmeg and cinnamon in place of pie spice because I prefer it. This a a great recipe for people who like the taste or idea of pumkin pie, but aren't too fond of the texture I served this with Easy Whipped Cream from this site, which was very good on it. Thanks!

This was nice!  I used regular cooking pudding mix because I did not have instant, I don't know what the difference is but it seemed to work.  I used applesauce instead of oil, probably could have used orange juice instead of water but I didn't.  I did not have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of nutmeg, 1/2  tsp of clove, and 1/2 tsp of ginger.  It was not very spicy, so if you like spice you could increase from there.  Mine cooked in 47 mins.  This would be nice with some kind of frosting as it is not very sweet cake.  Delish!

This cake was a hit!  Super moist and delicious.  I could not find the regular instant butterscotch pudding mix, but I did find the sugar free version, so I used that.  I baked for 45 minutes and it was perfect.  I also used the cream cheese frosting instead of whipped cream.  I will definitely be making this cake again and again for the holidays.

This turned out Awesome!  I made a couple of changes though. 1: I used a 1/4cup of melted butter instead of vegetable oil. Only because i bought a butter yellow cake. 2: I used another recipe to create a cream cheese filling for it. I simply put half the batter in the pan, then put in a strip of the cream cheese and then the rest of the batter.  Turned out fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out very dry.  1/4 cup of water doesn't seem like enough for all the dry ingredients.  The batter was very stiff.

Super moist & yummy!  Based on other reviews I used Pumpkin Spice Jello instead of Butterscotch, used cinnamon applesauce in place of the oil and added additional cinnamon.  Very good!  I did not even add a glaze.  I will definitely make this again.

I just won a prize at work for this bundt cake!  We live at 4500ft elevation, so I did make a few changes for the high-altitude: I used 3 eggs + 1Tb oil instead of 4 eggs; added a 15oz can of pureed pumpkin instead of 1 cup; baked at 350' for 45 minutes exactly.  What really made the cake shine was the citrus whipped cream on top: 1 cup heavy cream + 2 Tbs powdered sugar + 1tsp orange zest + 1 Tbs orange juice; beat until whipped.  Everyone loved it!!

UPDATE: TOOK 4 CUPCAKES WITH ME ON THE TRAIN AND GAVE THE REST TO MY FIANCE TO SHARE WITH HIS CO-WORKERS. I NEVER SAW MY GIRLFRIENDS (THEIR LOSS LOL!), BUT THE REPORT CARD FROM THE OFFICE WAS A+++. NOT ONLY DID EVERYONE LOVE THESE, THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY MY FIANCE WORKS FOR COULDN'T STOP EATING THEM! :-) Soooo good! Although very similar to no fuss pumpkin cake (Nancy Heider), the pumpkin flavor here is slightly more subtle (but in a good way!). Because of this, Lucille's recipe is a perfect match for a heavier frosting. I chose maple cream cheese frosting (Caitlin). If I were making Nancy's recipe, I'd pair it with a basic cream cheese frosting since her cake has a very strong pumpkin flavor. Instead of making a bundt cake, I wanted yet another excuse to use my new cupcake carrier / mechanical pastry bag, so I made 24 cupcakes. I frosted each with just a hint of maple frosting and a sprinkling of maple sugar (purchased at my local spice shop!). CAUTION: THESE ARE DIVINE. You WILL want to eat more than one lol! :) NOTE: I mistakenly purchased butterscotch cook and serve pudding, but it didn't matter (cook 'n serve adds richness - think pudding vs. gelatin or whipped cream vs. Cool-whip). I can't wait to share these with my group of lady friends tomorrow morning (we ride the commuter train to / from Chicago together every week). They will be SO impressed! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Lucille! :-)

I made this cake yesterday and followed the ingredients exactly.  I lowered the baking temp to 325 as I used a dark metal crysanthemum bundt pan and baked it for 55 min. It turned out perfect. After it cooled, I topped it off with a powdered sugar glaze and everyone from hubby to grandkids loved it!

Very tasty! I used butterscotch COOK & SERVE pudding instead of instant on accident but it still came out wonderful!  I doubled the pumpkin pie spice & subbed cinnamon applesauce for the oil.  I also added about a cup of chopped walnuts.  I haven't topped it yet -still figuring out what to put on it but it's very good as is! .... so I never ended up frosting this & it was like a light pumpkin bread -yum!

Wonderful cake. ALSO--I put this cake batter into greased/floured muffin tins and cooked them for about 25 minutes.  Wonderful with a little of the icing/glaze on top or served hot with butter. They do RISE HIGH, fill the muffin tins half full and get about 12 muffins.

Most people really loved this. And so easy. I would like to say that I make everything by scratch (but that would be a lie). It's not because of the time involved in making a scratch cake (I mean, really, it's only about 10 more minutes at most) It's more because, while I typically find the flavor greatly improved in homemade cakes, it is sadly hard to beat the texture in box mixes.

I didn't really care for this cake. I love pumpkin bread and I guess I expected it to have the same flavor but it didn't. Maybe add more seasoning if you try it. I won't be making this again.

I made this recipe (as written) in muffin cups and added a streusel topping.  Eat your heart out Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts.  These were great.  I did use fresh pumpkin puree, rather than canned.

Absolutely fabulous. I added some crushed pineapple and substituted 1/2 of the water with the pineapple juice.  Moist and definitively an autumn/ holiday keeper!!!

This was a yummy cake. My daughter loves pumpkin pie so this was a hit with her. I did use a yellow butter cake mix and extra spice as suggested in other post. I will be making this again.

Excellent and delicious! I used a reduced calorie Jello Butterscotch pudding mix but followed the rest of the recipe as listed. Using a coated bundt pan, it only required 40-45 minutes cook time. Any more than that would have made the cake very, very dry.

Oh this cake is so easy and so good.  I used instant Vanilla pudding, cause thats what I had, and used a little over 3 tsps of Pumpkin Pie Spice.  It only took about 45 minutes to bake in my oven, so watch closely.  Topped with Cool Whip, this made a great T-day dessert!!  This one is a keeper, thanks !!

This is delicious and SO simple. I made it even easier by using spice cake mix rather than yellow, and omitting the pumpkin pie spice (since the spices were already in the cake mix). I'm sure the other way would work, too, though. Very moist and dense (in a good way). Basically, tastes like pumpkin bread. Made it for a Halloween party, and everyone raved about it!

I only had vanilla instant pudding on hand, so I added that instead of butterscotch.  I also added cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves to this.  Let the cake sit overnight to soak up the flavors, AMAZING!

so, so good.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using sugar-free pudding instead of regular and sugaring my pan (I know, it seems counter-intuitive, but hey, save your calories where you can, lol) like another member suggested.  Really, I can't say enough...  I'll never make a different pumpkin cake!

Delicious! Like another reviewer suggested, I dusted the Bundt pan with granulated sugar and added pecans to the bottom of the pan. I also added about 1 tsp. of maple extract to the batter. After the cake cooled, I drizzled the top with cream cheese frosting. Really fantastic and easy!

Darn easy to make... would have gotten a 5 star but my husband and I both felt that it need a little more kick (followed the recipe exactly)... more pumpkin spice is needed.  I'll have to play around with it a bit more.

Made two of these this weekend.  One for my mom's bday and one for work.  It was a hit at both places.  I've been asked to make this for Thanksgiving desert!  I couldn't find butterscotch instant pudding so used butterscotch regular pudding and I didn't have pumpkin spice so I used ground cinnamon.  This cake was so moist and delicious.  I  used the cream cheese glaze from the "Holiday Pumpkin Cake with Rum-Cream Cheese Glaze" recipe on this site but instead of Rum extract I used vanilla.  This is a keeper and I will be making this many, many more times.  Thanks for the recipe!

Ohhh so delicious! A hit at the party last night....very moist and pumpkin-y. You could also taste the butterscotch, but it wasnt overwhelming. I only had two 1oz. pks of sugar free/fat free butterscotch pudding and it was just fine. Everyone loved how moist the cake was. Will make again...thanks!

This cake is really a winner.  It got rave reviews at a recent party, and I will be making it again this week.  I added chopped pecans and used vanilla pudding instead of the butterscotch.  It was so moist and tasty, and loaded with autumn flavor.

Great easy recipe.  I topped it with a spiced glaze (icing sugar, milk, bit of vanilla and pumpkin pie spice) which was great, but I think it would be even better with the cream cheese glaze with some spice added in.  I'll try that next time.

Very good,very easy.  I made a mistake and accidently purchased Spice Cake mix and didn't have time to go out and buy the yellow mix, soooo I used Spice and it turned out delecious.  I then used an orange glaze to make it look more festive since it was for a birthday cake and everyone loved it.  So then my mistake turned out a brand new flavored cake, will try it again with the yellow mix to see the difference.

I have made this recipe many times precisely as it is written with wonderful results and many a rave from friends and family. I have also on occasion substituted homemade apple butter, pumpkin butter for the canned pumpkin and not added any additional spices as they were already present in the homemade apple butter and pumpkin butter. Today is the first time trying in glass loaf pans. I have set timer for 30 minutes and oven at 325°. At  30 minutes loaf not fully risen added another 10 minutes to timer checked with tooth pick and was wet added another 10 minutes and loaves were risen and tooth pick came out clean. Now the real test will be in taste and texture. I hope this turns out as well as the bundt   pan always has. Thank you again for this  never failed me before recipe, always seems to please.

Great recipe -- followed the suggestions of others and only baked for 45 minutes -- done perfectly.  I substituted pumpkin spice pudding for the butterscotch pudding and also doubled the pumpkin pie spice.  Used the suggested glaze for the cake.  Had company for dinner and everyone loved the cake.

I too used the Pumpkin pudding, although I can see how the brown sugar taste of the butterscotch might have been good too. And I used a spice cake mix- seemed like a natural to me. Great easy recipe!

Yummy! Added a nut/streusel topping (bottom of bundt pan), and after 1/2 batter in pan, added topping.  Followed by rest of batter.  Delicious!!!  The nut streusel addition made it perfect!

Very easy to prepare, yet tastes great (not like cake mix) and is very moist. Substituted most of the oil for apple sauce and we couldn't tell it was reduced fat. Great recipe:)

This was excellent!  The perfect amount of pumpkin flavor!  I used sugar-free pudding mix, a funfetti cake mix, 4 egg whites, & subbed applesauce for the oil.  I topped with a cream cheese frosting (4 oz lite cream cheese, 8 oz powdered sugar, 4 T butter, 1 tsp vanilla) and it was raved about when I brought into work for my birthday!  DELICIOUS!

This cake is very easy to whip up & doesn’t have an overpowering pumpkin flavor. My husband and co-workers thought it was quite good. The only thing I felt was disappointing was that it wasn’t as moist as I was expecting. I will make again though. I think since I used a dark bunt pan, I’ll take it out of the oven sooner than the 55 minutes the recipe suggests. I also made a cream cheese glaze for it rather than Cool Whip. This for me, made it feel more like a “cake” and not a “bread”

This was a wonderful, moist cake! I used french vanilla pudding because that it was I had and substituted the vegetable oil with canola. I didn't add any icing or use whip cream. I would make this to take to a brunch or eat along with a hot cup of coffee. So good!!

This cake is so easy and incredibly moist!  I cooked it for the full 55 minutes and it was perfectly done.  I substituted flaxseed oil for the suggested vegetable oil and I couldn't be happier.  This is a relatively healthy sweet and it's perfect for fall.

This is a very nice cake.  I followed another reviewer's tip and used a cream cheese frosting/glaze and also baked the cake for 45 minutes.  Oh, and I doubled the pie spice too, again from the other reviewer's tip.  It was a delicious cake.  I brought it to a party and it was completely devoured with many compliments.  I made it a second time, using the entire can of pie filling which a couple of reviewers mentioned.  I don't recommend this, the second cake was a little too moist/gooey at the bottom.    I will make this again using 1 cup of pie filling as directed.  It was easy, nice looking and very flavorful.

I have been using this recipe for 2 years now.  I also use sugar-free pudding, but I do add 1 cup of chocolate chips.  Also, instead of frosting I sift powdered sugar over it.  The cake is so moist you really don't need frosting.  We like to warm it up for 15-20 seconds in the microwave before eating.  Love it!

I made this cake last night and followed the directions to the letter, I was not that impressed with anything about it. It is only so so, tasted ok, baked up ok, nothing amazing about it. Also tried it both with whipped cream and a cream cheese glaze suggested by one of the other reviews. No one in the house was impressed.

I made this cake as written and baked it in a bundt pan that looks like a ring of Christmas trees.  The stated cooking time was too long.  The second time I baked it for 40 minutes and it was perfect. I sifted some powdered sugar over it to look like snow and it was a big hit at the Christmas party.  I think it is great with a squirt of Cool Whip.

This was a hit!  I made it a few days early and kept it in the fridge and it was still moist and delicious.  I made an icing using some cream cheese, confectioners sugar, a little milk and some of the leftover pumpkin.  It was perfect!

This is delicious, moist and flavorful. I added a mixture of chopped walnuts, brown sugar and cinnamon to the center of the cake. I then drizzled a cream cheese frosting glaze over the cake and added a sprinkling of more chopped walnuts.  Everyone loved it!

This is such a great recipe! I served this at my sister's wedding shower along with a lemon poppyseed cake made with essentially the same recipe. I was in a rush when I made it and used too much pumpkin and it still turned out great. I melted cream cheese icing and poured it over the top and everyone just loved it!! I made 2 at the same time and put one in the freezer that I'm planning on serving at Thanksgiving.

This recipe was easy, super tasty and fed a crowd.  I will make this again.  I actually found pumpkin spice flavored pudding mix (instead of butterscotch) and that worked great.  I mixed some pumpkin pie spice into the icing before I drizzled it on.  It was a hit with my supper club.

Baked in a loaf pan (so baking time was closer to 70min) and sprinkled with chopped walnuts.  I would sift the cake mix next time - it took a long time to stir out all the lumps of cake mix flour - or mix the wet ingredients first and then gradually add the dry.  But the taste: unbelievable!

This cake is so good and incredibly easy.  I always have extra cans of pumpkin and don't know what to do with it.  This was a great way to use some up.  Didn't change a thing on the recipe.  Brought it to work and everyone loved it!

Wow!! This is a really delicious, moist, spiced pumpkin cake! I will definately be making this for Thanksgiving! I frosted it with Cream Cheese frosting and it was scrumptious! I also added just a tad bit more extra pumpkin pie spice!

This is a wonderful recipe! It's like yummy pumpkin pie in a cake. The recipe couldn't be easier, and it's a great take on cake for the fall. It made the house smell great, the color and appearance is beautiful, and tastes awesome. Rave reviews from husband, inlaws, and the birthday girl herself. Thanks for the recipe!
