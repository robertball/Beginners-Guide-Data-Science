My youngest child and I made this quick dessert together. We used fat free evaporated milk, sugar free pudding, light pie filling whipped topping. I did not use the cinnamon as I felt it would have been out of place. The kids and I really liked this. This serves four, not three. Great pantry dessert.

Good basic recipe...however I will say, I didn't  like the flavor of the evaporated milk mixed with the pudding mix. It really in it's self, not that good. But having said that, when layered the way the recipe was layered. The taste was way better mixed with the other flavors and not notice the weird back taste that the pudding mix gave off in the beginning. I will make again, but won't be using evaporated milk, will use regular milk in it's place. The whole idea and the ease of the recipe was great. Just not so much with the evaporated milk in this.

This was a rather simple dessert but nothing I got excited about.  I don't know that I'm a fan of the evaporated milk.  I chose to use whipping cream and sweetened ground chocolate instead of the cool whip & cinnamon called for.

I didn't have instant pudding, so I cooked mine. But, it made a nice thick pudding with the evaporated milk. Yummy.

This was really easy! I did it exactly as described and didn't have an issue with the cherries falling through the pudding layers.
