Husband and I loved it! Super easy to make- basically throw everything in the pan and let it simmer for an hour. Next time I make it, I'll try it with tofu. This seems like it would make an excellent vegetarian dish also!

I thought the tomato coconut milk broth would be great with the fish, but after following the directions exactly we found the "stew" to be very thin and lacking in flavor.  Stew just doesn't thicken when cooked for an hour on low with the lid on.  Second time around I added some red curry paste to the onions and peppers and then let it simmer for 30 mins uncovered before added the cubed fish and cooked covered for the remaining time.  It had a better mouth feel the second time around but just lacked a lot in the flavor department.

I will definitely make this again but, I will not put a lid on it. The sauce was too thin! I took the left over sauce and reduced it. Wow! It really brought out the flavor and made it creamy. Next time, I think I will broil the fish and make the sauce separately. Great combo of flavors. It did need more salt.

This was so super easy and everyone, even the kids, enjoyed. I made a couple substitutions only because I was trying to make this work with what I had on hand.  I used Tilapia in place of Cod, & Rotel in place of the diced tomatoes. I served the Sriracha at the table so our family could add according to their preference.  Next time I will try serving over Basmati rice to make it more of a meal. I'm attaching a picture of the beginning step, & just before covering it to simmer. Try it!!

Loved this stew.  I used tomatoes with chili peppers and it had a nice warmth.
The next day I threw some shrimp in the leftover stew and it was a delicious lunch.

We absolutely love this exotic and flavorful stew! I used a mixed bag of frozen bell peppers and onions and frozen cod from sams, I served it with warm corn tortillas. This is delicious. I and am happy to now have an amazing dish that can be whipped up with ease at a moments notice, nothing beats a recipe that can be made solely on pantry staples :)

I tried reducing it for a while before adding the fish and covering, as another reviewer suggested. The fish ended up a bit tough and overcooked, but I really liked the flavor. I added salt, pepper, paprika, thyme, chili paste, and extra scallion chips other reviewers said it was bland, and it paid off.

The flavor is there with the sriracha, but I added hot curry the second time and it was also excellent! This is a new staple in our house, especially since we are trying to eat more fish.  I used mahi mahi the second time and it was great!

Totally adding this to my regular repertoire. It's so easy and delicious! You'll impress your friends if you make it for a group. I substituted cod for ling fish which held up really well.

Not the best looking thing I've made, but reasonably tasty.  Not sure if I would make it again.

This was just excellent! My daughter and I enjoyed this very much. A little salt and some more Sriracha to finish it in our bowls and we were going back for seconds.

Solid taste bones, but I did feel the need to make it my own at the end.      I felt much missing otherwise.

This was an alright dish. Very easy to make but it was missing something but not sure what. I served it with tortillas and sliced avocado which was good. This was not a bad dish by any means but I just don't imagine myself making it again. Sorry.

I thought this was very good. I did not have fresh cod, rather the flash frozen. I think this added more liquid to the stew and it wasn't getting thick. I added corn starch at the end to thicken it up. I didn't have Sriracha so used a buffalo sauce I had and added about 4 splashes. it gave it a very nice kick yet not overly spicy. The red peppers kind of disintegrated during the cooking process. They provided a good flavor but I think next time after sautéing the veggies I will work out a way to add them about half way through. Will make this again :)
