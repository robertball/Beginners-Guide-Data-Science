I have been searching for this recipe for the longest time.  My husband's family is from Italy.  His aunt makes rice balls for him every time we visit...but I have yet to get the recipe.  This one is very close.  I changed it quite a bit.  I use the "Italian Meatballs" recipe by JoAnn usually the night before I make the rice balls.  The next day I divide the leftover meatballs and divide them in 4ths.  When I form the rice ball, I put a bit of mozzarella cheese and the 1/4 of the meatball in the center.  The meatball is already flavored so I don't need to mess with ground beef prep on this recipe.  Sometimes I fry the rice balls but, for the most part, I usually just bake them.  They are artery clogging good fried.  But baked they are still good without adding even more oil to the mix.

Close to my own recipe I use.  I got mine from an Italian website that I translated.  I love arancini.  I like the earlier review bake them now instead of frying, but the frying makes them more authentic like the ones I tasted in Sicily.

Really liked this recipe.  My only change was adding an additional beaten egg with some water to the rice mixture to help bind it together better.  It also reheats great in the oven for leftovers.

Rice balls were underseasoned... Fried well, but very very bland.
