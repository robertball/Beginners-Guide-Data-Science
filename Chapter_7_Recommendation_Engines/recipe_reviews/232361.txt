Hello, when I made this I used a 1 1/2 pounds of scallops. The only think I did different was add two more tbls of olive oil and 3 more tbls of salt free butter. These came out perfect with a delicious flavor, my family was I love with them. This was for the 6 servings. Probably don't need  extra oil and butter for the original 4 serving portions.

Following the recipe to a tee I thought it was quite good. I would make this again. Be sure and have the sauce mixed and ready for action. Once you introduce the scallops to the skillet things heat up quickly.
The sauce makes the dish what it is so don't skimp on any of the ingredients.  
Thank you Tanaquil for posting this fun, easy and tasty recipe.

Excellent!  Make sure your timers are running.  The breadcrumb coating  makes it a little more difficult to to tell when the scallops are done since you can't see the opaqueness of them.  Great Recipe!

Followed the recipe but did add a little more butter and olive oil to the skillet with the wine and other things.
Better than a restaurant!
I think it’s important to rinse them first in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.

I can’t remember the last time I cooked scallops, that’s how infrequent it is, but these came out superbly. The cooking time was right on, so the scallops were tender and not one bit chewy. I didn’t have fresh parsley in hand so I used dried, and mixed in some dried tarragon. The sauce was delicious, but I would make more because I loooove sauce. I served it on top of imported zebra farfalle (a holiday gift from a gourmet Italian market in Pismo Beach), and garnished with arugula because I wanted some green. I made this for my husband who adores scallops, and he loved it.

Excellent recipe. Used a pound and a half of large frozen sea scallops. I thawed them out. I also double the sauce and made it on the side. Once the scallops were on my plate I just spooned over some of the sauce. Delicious. Would definitely make again.

This was very good.  The breading added additional texture that does not exist in sautéed scallops without it.  The only change I made was to add a bit of butter to the finished sauce because it remained thin.

I used previously frozen scallops that were basically fresh.  The recipe was easy to do, and the cooked scallops tasted good.  Only drawback was the lingering seafood smell in the kitchen.  Leftovers reheated OK and tasted about as good as when first cooked.

Delicious!!! Everyone loved them and mopped up the sauce! Highly recommend for easy, light dinner. We had brown rice and fresh tomatoes with mozzarella as sides. Perfect summer dinner.

This recipe is delicious and will be in my rotation for scallop recipes.  One change I made was to substitute Old Bay Seasoning for the salt mixed in with the bread crumbs.  I had Holland House white cooking wine with lemon juice already in it so I just increased the white wine amount to reflect the amount of lemon juice in the recipe.  I was surprised that the bread crumb mixture was able to adhere to the scallops without egg or milk but simple the natural moisture of the scallops.  Don't forget to remove the strip of muscle sometimes on the side of the scallop, rinse in cold water and pat dry.

Really good.  I cooked up shrimp and salmon using the same recipe, and loved it all.  Used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain.

Great recipe.  I did as other suggested and made the sauce in a separate pan first and then poured it over the scallops after cooking.

These were wonderful.  I would reduce the amount of lemon juice.  That being said,  it often depends on the lemons themselves as some are more "lemony".  Meyer lemons would be milder and sweeter.   It's sort of trial and error, so taste it first.  Certainly would make these again....so easy, too.

OMG! Followed the directions exactly except used avocado oil. My wife, who doesn’t typically love scallops, said I could make this for her every week. She felt it was “restaurant quality.” Thank you so much for a wonderful dining experience.

This was an absolute with my husband! He loves scallops and I surprised him with this one. It was super easy to make and I just added some Parmesan cheese at the end.

Made the recipe as the directions states. I made two separate skillets of it; one using GF breadcrumbs for my husband and one using non GF for the rest of us!  Delicious.
