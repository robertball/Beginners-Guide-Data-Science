Good basic recipe, but after reading reviews decided to season it up on first making.  In glass measure cup mixed 1 egg, 1/4 c onion & chive cream cheese and enough milk to bring liquid to 2/3 c.  Added liquid to 4 c hash brown, 2 T chives, 4 green onion sliced thin, 1t minced garlic and used 7x11 glass baking dish.  Added dash of onion powder & garlic powder to veggies - used equal amounts fresh sliced carrots, celery and frozen green beans, peas, corn & broccoli (total of 16 oz) and lastly about 1/4 c finely chopped frozen spinach.  Didn't use bread crumb topping, put extra diced chicken (seasoned well when cooked) on top.  Next time will probably added a bit of evaporated milk to the condensed soup just to make it a bit creamier.  Family loved it!

This was a great recipe for my family! We all love pot pies and this will definitely top our monthly menu a few times a year! I did make a couple of minor changes based on the reviews I read. I used a 9x13" dish and added hash brown mix to make up the difference. Also added onion to the mix and a pinch of garlic salt. Added a pinch of rosemary to the chicken while I cooked it. And my fiancé would have been awfully disappointed not to have that flaky crust she loves so much in a pot pie! I omit the breadcrumbs and made a pie crust to top it.

My husband emailed me this recipe. I took the "hint" and made it. We all really liked this dish and had seconds! Due to our personal preference I added minced garlic and onion.

After reading the reviews I definitely made this my own and it turned out pretty tasty! I only had a 13x9 pan and plenty of hash browns so I needed to adjust. I added a fourth cup of potatoes to the crust with the two eggs and salt/pepper, baked for about 25 minutes then added the filling. Instead of the Cream of Mushroom, I did one can of Cheddar Cheese soup and one can of Cream of Chicken, a whole bag of mixed veggies and two chicken breasts diced, cooked and seasoned with salt/pepper.  Mixed it all together added some garlic powder, Italian seasoning and fresh onion. Covered the top with more hash browns back in the oven for 40 min (lightly browned taters). BAM!! Dinner is served and enjoy.

I  thought the recipe was missing something. I decided to add some sour cream to the soup and some cheddar cheese. If I make this again, I probably would not use cream of mushroom, I would add cheddar cheese soup. With the pototoe crust, that would definately make a big differance. Instead of breadcrumbs, I used buttered crackers chopped up with the butter. I will make it again with my changes one day.

This is a decent base recipe but needed a lot of tweaking to work for us. Make sure to season based on what you like. I used cream of chicken soup instead and added probably a cup of milk or more, we like it creamy. I also took into account that the potatoes on the bottom would soak up some liquid.  I wasnt crazy about the eggs mixed with the potatoes but I liked the top crust. I will change the bottom crust next time. I added garlic salt, onion powder and black pepper to the soup mixture.  I also only used a 12 oz bag of mixed veggies and it was alot of veggies. My hubby doesn't like veggies and it was too much for him. I'll adjust the veggies next time too. I'm glad I found this for a starting point though.  I gave 3 stars because without my tweeks it would have been dry and bland, also beacuase if the potato egg mix. Happy cooking y'all!

Have been reading comments.  Have an idea!  Try mixing the hash browns and eggs and then bake a little to form a true "crust".  MORE flavor is added, less dense, and it will not wick all the moisture as quickly!!!  :)

This looked like something right up Mr. LTH's alley, and it needed a "face", so I decided to give it a whirl.  It came together easily, but it was quite bland.  I was REALLY hungry and ended up heating up leftovers to eat after trying a serving of this.  It was just ok; quite bland for my tastes, but Mr. LTH deemed it "fine".  THANKS for the recipe!

Instead of using hash browns I used tater tots since I bought the wrong thing. I also added onion and garlic powder. I substituted the cream of mushroom with cream of chicken. This turned out amazing! So good even my roomate who hates veggies loved it!

I did use cream of chicken instead of mushroom and added some garlic pepper. and I think a regular crust instead of the bread crumbs would be better as well as adding some evaporated milk to make it creamier.

Made it for dinner tonight and nothing left but the empty pan.  Very easy and used ingredients in cupboard.
I cooked veg first before placing in pan. Used frozen vegs but any kind would do
Make sure you grease pan when cooking potatoes.
Will make this again

Very quick and easy!  I read the reviews and spiced mine up.  I cut the chicken and drizzled it with margarine...then seasoned it with blackend seasoning  in a hot skillet.  I used cream of mushroom & garlic soup and added fresh garlic to the veggies.....I also sprinkled the top with breadcrumbs prev drizzled with butter and grated cheese.....yummy

This was well received. The guys ate it but they weren't wowed. I won't make it again but I am glad I tried it.  My bake time was doubled for the crust and total time.

Really enjoyed this recipe with modifications.  Added garlic powder, Rosemary and Greek yogurt to Cream of Chicken Soup.  Also used hashbrown patties broken into smaller pieces mixed with egg.  Will be making again and looking forward to the leftovers

Very good recipe for a retired guy cooking for one. I read all of the reviews and many said it was bland so I added diced onion, red and green pepper along with a few shakes of parsley, oregano, and rosemary. I didn't have bread crumbs so I used more hash browns for the topping. Turned out very tasty but I should have baked the bottom crust a bit longer.

This is a good recipe for leftover chicken but it needs more liquid. Next time I will add a half cup of milk and some garlic powder.

FAST VERY GOOD. I followed recipe and doubled. 2 cans of soup does not need a bit of milk or water at all. Potatoes a little crispy on bottom. No reason not to cook potatoes first, but 
not sure necesssary.  Top panko and butter nice and crispy.
I used all fresh vegetables and I think they need a little more cooking time. I did add a few red pepper flakes. Quite nice.

I tweaked it because I had read the previous reviews about it being bland.  I only had a 13x9 dish so I also added a fourth cup of potatoes, 2 eggs and a good sized amount of salt and pepper for the crust placed in oven for 25 minutes.  While that was cooking I cooked my chicken in canola oil, garlic powder, ground oregano and poultry seasoning.   I used mixed vegetables but I think next time I will use broccoli.  I added a can of cheddar cheese soup and substituted the cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken, added more garlic powder and some pepper, a spoonful of sour cream and a little milk to thin the mixture out just a bit.  I poured that on top of the crust covered it all with more hash browns and melted butter with pepper.  I baked in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes, I covered it all with shredded cheese the last 5 minutes until it was melted.  It tasted great but I still feel it's missing something, maybe some salsa I don't know but my husband devoured it!

I just made this casserole with a couple of changes after reading other reviews.  I baked the hash browns for 20 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I too added about a cup of mixed vegetables and that was plenty.  I also added about 1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese.  This is really delicious but doesn't reheat as well as I anticipated.  M
