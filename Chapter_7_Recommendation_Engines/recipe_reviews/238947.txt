This recipe has very good flavor and easy to make.  I made it exactly as it was stated.  I have an 4,8,11 year old and they devoured it! Serves over rice with a dollop of sour cream.

I used Cannellini beans, didn't have black beans. But I did not taste the chocolate chips or peanut butter. Will make again.

This is good. You could probably just do 2 cans of the tomatoes...I like mine less soupy. I also used half breasts on the bone which was more meat and shredded just fine. I will probably leave out the peanut butter next time

Very good, but I followed a previous cooks recommendation & used just two cans of tomatoes & it was still a bit sloppy. Good though.

Used Kroger roasted diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead. Also substituted semi sweet chocolate chips and a handful. Topped off with a tablespoon of ricotta cheese mixed in, and it was awesome! Will definitely have it again.

Not bad but I didn't enjoy the flavour of the sauce.  Will try it without the chocolate and peanut butter next time.
