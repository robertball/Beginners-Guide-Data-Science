This is a fantastic recipe.  I didn't have "fajita seasoning" so I just added pinches of cayenne, salt, paprika, cumin, chili, and black pepper.  It turned out great!  And I agree, I baked it for more like 30 minutes instead of the stated 17.

Hmmmm. What to say.  This is like a corn bread recipe. If I did make this again (which I am not) I would add around 1/4 cup jalapenos for more flavor. This recipe also makes well over 8 servings. ALSO it does not cook in 17 minutes.  Have to keep baking and watching, my guess it that it was about 25-20 minutes. I gave it a three star based on my husband and daughter opinion (who are corn bread fans). Just not a repeat. Sorry.

I used Honey greek yogurt for extra protein, and 2 tbl. of sugar ( because of what other reviews said. I also used cheddar cheese instead of monterey. TASTY! Served it with Asparagus Soup.

I used Hot Pepper Monterey Jack Cheese for a little more spice and baked for 20 min. Muffins taste their best right from the oven :)

I like to try new things, but this recipe just didn't taste good to me.  Maybe it would be good if I spent some time tweaking it to my tastes, since I love avocado, cheese, and cornbread all individually.

I'm sorry but I really did not like this bread. It just had such an unusual taste that I couldn't eat very much of it. It was like an illusion, at first it tasted pretty good and then as I took more bites it got weirder and weirder. I'm normally a pretty adventurous eater, but this just didn't do it for me. Some of our guests thought it was decent though.

I did not have any lemon yogurt, so I used Honey flavored Greek yogurt.  After pouring the batter into a 9X13 pan, it was obvious that a smaller pan would be better, so I dumped it into an 8" square.  Delicious!  One would never guess there were avocados or yogurt in there....if one could explain why it's kind of green.  Sneaky nutrition at its best.
Oh.  And I didn't have a cornbread mix, so I made my own.
