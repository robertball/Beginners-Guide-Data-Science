Tastes great...looks horrible after the apple juice drains out of the apples and mixes with the caramel. If you don't care what your food looks like, You will like this quick and easy recipe. But as for those of us that like to show off our baked goods, this is not the one!

After reading everyone's reviews I took a crack at salvaging this recipe.  I used the refrigerator case cookie dough and slightly microwaved it just to soften up for pressing into ungreased 9X13 foil ovenware pan (rolling it out sounded like too much work).  I did not sprinkle dough with sugar prior to baking (it will be sweet enough after the caramel goes on).  I sliced and sauteed Granny Smith apples in butter then sprinkled with 1 tsp. of  brown sugar and cinnamon each.  Then I spread out 1/4 cup melted caramel onto baked cookie, arranged apple slices then spoon-drizzled with another 1/4 cup melted caramel.  I gave it a BAM! of powdered sugar just for show.  It cuts like a dream into 24 bars.  The ovenware I used came with a plastic lid - perfect for traveling to picnics or potlucks, but it's easier to serve if you cut into bars before traveling.

I hate refrigerated cookie dough - and I ended up cooking the apples in a little butter with cinnamon sugar....I didn't care for this too much

If the apples look gross with apple juice, perhaps you could try caramelizing them. (You know, fried apples). Those don't really ooze very much if you clear off any of the sauce before putting them on the cookie.

Or make very very thin slices of apple and don't soak them in anything: let the caramel cover the uber tastiness part.

Didn't turn out very well. Too sticky and unwieldy, and not appetizing looking.
