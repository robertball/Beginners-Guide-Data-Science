By far the best marinade recipe that I've found!! I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could.   The meat was so incredibly tender it melted in one's mouth.  I had a bit of teriaki sauce left over which I used to make up part of the soy sauce amount.   I also dabbed in a bit of worcestershire sauce.   Used the "lite" soy to decrease the sodium content of the recipe.  Will maybe give some minced, fresh garlic and/or a bit of freshly grated ginger a try the next time.  Made a large batch--enough for 15--and it was so easy to divide between two large resealable bags.  No fuss, no muss.  All those who were in attendance at the family gathering just loved the flavor and tenderness of the chicken.  This will be my first choice from now on.

This was great!  I was browsing the site looking for a new marinate for some variety from the one I have been using for years.  This one was SO simple and almost as good (OK, it's better!!)  I did use more horseradish than the recipe called for, not quite double.  Plus I used double the garlic & used fresh garlic.  Also added a little fresh minced ginger, about 1/2 tsp.  Let it marinate about 8 hrs as that was all the time I had until dinner.  They were so flavorful and tender.  I will definitely be making this again & again!  I cooked the chicken on my George Forman grill but can't wait for spring to try them on the BBQ.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Good flavor and nice color, I used 7-up and let the breast marinate for about 8 hours. That was long enough because it had a strong flavor, I think I would cut back just a little on the soy sauce. I couldn't even tell that it had the horseradish in the mix.

This is by far the best tasting chicken ever. It was wonderful on the grill, I followed same directions but added fresh garlic and probably 1 1/2 tablespoon of hot horseradish. ( I love the stuff), it did not make it hot just zesty.  So many complements, I actually used a large bag from Costco (Sams club) of frozen chicken breasts, this was enough to marinate the entire bag. Just open the bag and pour in the marinate after you mixed it. Then close the bag and put it overnight in the fridge, the breast defrost and suck in all the marinate at the same time. Yummy!

I was in charge of a dinner for 80 people and we used this marinade. We used it on chicken tenders and fried them on the stovetop. I reduced the soy sauce to 1/2 cup and eliminated the horseradish sauce. Everyone raved about the chicken and wanted the recipe

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was F A N T A S T I C!!!  Both my husband and my 3-year-old daughter loved it, and they are very hard to please.  Prep time is under 5 minutes, and then all you do is drain and grill.  Probably one of the easiest meals I've made lately, and also one of the most delicious.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  I don't usually like to grill chicken because it tends to dry out, but not this time!  This is my new favorite way of preparing chicken, and I will be getting a lot of use out of this recipe.

This was probably the moistest, juiciest, most flavorful grilled chicken I've made. I used Diet Squirt for the pop, shorted the amount of soy sauce a bit, and increased garlic and horseradish as recommended by other reviewers. Great the next day sliced over a salad, too!

Good, and very tender.  I did think the soy sauce was a tad too strong.

This is the best chicken marinade I have found yet.  I used 7 up, as that was all I had, and did not use horseradish and it was excellent.  My kids loved it!  Will for sure make over and over again.

I don't have a lot of experience with marinades. That's my disclaimer. If not for an adventuresome spirit, I would probably not try another marinade for chicken after using this one. It was spectacular. We grilled the chicken breasts (bone-in for about 12 or 13 minutes per side), after marinading for two hours. The chicken held up well. I'm told marinading chicken longer can result in mushy meat. As is, the flavor and texture were perfect. We served grilled asparagus and green peppers with the chicken, brushed with olive oil and kosher salt. What a meal!

Were the chicken breasts tender after following this recipe exactly?  Yes.  Were they tasty? So so.  I expected a bit more flavor or zing to this marinade (I marinated the breasts for 10 hrs) but the flavor was rather bland.  I will try it again altering the recipe by adding more and fresh garlic and by adding more horseradish and see what that does.  This recipe is worth keeping and using, but not a spectacular one like so many others have rated it.

First of all, I would like to say we try recipes 'as written' before adding/changing, etc.  I did this recipe to the letter and it was extraordinary!  Nonie, you did a good thing, thank you.  I will/would serve this to comany, family, anyone.  
I will try something a bit different next time, I will cut the chicken in half 'the hard way', making filets out of them.  I will use the same marinade, the same amount of time, etc.  I will grill them (shorter time since half as thick).  I split the cook time per side in half and rotate 90 degrees for the second half to ge the right 'grill mark visual'.  I'm thinking sandwiches.  The 'bark' (darker surface) will be a bit deeper.  Granted, I will lose some of the moisture, but I think the marinade will hold up fine.

I'll let you know!

Sooooooo good. I used double the amount of horseradish since my whole family loves the zest it gives cooked meats.  I only marinated the chicken 2 hours and it was very flavorful.  Also, left over chicken made for an excellent chicken salad sandwich!

The breasts came out incredibly tender after marinating for 8 hours. It was a very good recipe but I can't give it 5 stars because the flavor needed more of a kick. I will enjoy messing around with this recipe.

I have never rated anything but I felt this one was more than worthy!  I marinated this over night (and a day) and served it to my husband and friends.  They all went on and on how great the taste was, how tenter it was!!!  I used 7up and used Japanese soy sauce (less salt).   Not to mention how easy it was. I will be using this recipe on a regular basis!! thanks for a great recipe!!

I used only 3/4 cup soy sauce and still a bit salty.  Used garlic from the jar instead of powder.  It was ok.

So moist and tasty! Really delicious! I didn't have the horseradish so I left it out. I used fresca (b/c that's what I had. It was a big hit for both adults and kids!

Very, very good!  I didn't have horseradish, but I used a little vinegar.  Also minced garlic instead of powder.  I made two boneless skinless breasts and six big legs and there was plenty of marinade...could've probably gotten by with less.  Kids liked this too!

Wonderful marinade. Tonight will be the second time I am making it. I only marinated for about 4-5 hours, using high quality, thick chicken breasts and they came out perfect. Very tender and flavorful. I used minced garlic, and extra horseradish because we love those favors. Had no problem with a salty taste, as others have said, using regular soy sauce. However, we are not salt sensitive. Wonderful!!!

These were so simple to make and really good! I don't have a BBQ so I baked mine in the oven at 425F for 35 minutes. I used regular soy sauce instead of low sodium and they turned out really salty, which is why this is only getting 4 stars... I'll try with either low sodium or diluted regular soy sauce next time...

Fabulous!  My family loved it.  I will use this again and again.  The only thing I changed by necessity was that I used less soy sauce and added fresh minced garlic.  Great recipe!

This was very good and made VERY tender chicken. We used chicken breast tenders because that's what we had on hand. I also used half the amount of soy sauce because of my kids' taste. 

We cooked these on the gas grill and they were done in no time. And did I mention how tender the chicken was lol? I only marinated for about an hour and a half and it still turned out great for me. 

Thanks a bunch for this recipe we will be using this a bunch!

The chicken was very juicy, but not as flavorful as I expected.

I tried this marinade for the first time this past weekend and it was awesome. I added a little black pepper and some red pepper flakes for taste. I didn't add salt as I figured the soy sauce had plenty and I was right. In fact a little too much salt for my taste. When I make it again I'll cut the soy sauce in half. No matter, this is still a great marinade. Will definitely use again. Thanks a bunch.

This marinade makes the most tender chicken you will ever eat.  To die for.  I will never make BBQ chicken any other way.

Nice and simple. Fairly tasty. Next time I will be experimenting with ways to increase the intesity of the flavor.

I saved this recipe to my favorites 3 months ago.  Wasn''t for sure about it even though I know it had great reviews.  This is by far the best marinade I have ever tried for chicken.  I will always use this from now on.  It gives the chicken such good flavor.  Wished I hadn't waited so long to try this.

Made this for dinner tonight, for Father's Day.  It was a huge success...so tender and flavourful.  I'll never bbq chicken any other way. Super easy to make and delicious - it doesn't get any better than that. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Super easy, very tasty and extra moist. My son ate it and so did my guest. They both love it. This will now be a staple meal in our house.

My new favorite chicken marinade!! This was sooo easy to make, I followed the recipe pretty much as is but added extra horseradish and used minced garlic instead of powder. My family really loved the tenderness and flavor.

This recipe did not work for me.  I think sometimes people confuse "tender" with "mushy" when dealing with marinated meats.  The chicken was so broken down that I felt it was just mush, maybe marinating it for less time would help, but I won't make this again to try it.

I followed the recipe exactly, even added a bit of minced garlic, marinated for 8 hours and while my family all liked it, I thought it had an overpowering soy flavor.  I'm going to try this again, but next time will only use half the soy. Other than that, vey moist, and I love a recipe that calls for things I already have on hand!

This made melt-in-your-mouth chicken. I increased the galic powder to 1tsp. and the horseradish to 1tsp. and used lite soy and diet soda. It was fabulous. My family wanted more. I will definitly be keeping this recipe.

By far the best marinade I've found so far. This time I subbed wasabi powder for the horseradish. Both times I've used tonic with a Tbsp of lemon juice. Excellent!

The best marinade for tender meat.  The flavor is good - very easy to add other spices to adjust for your taste buds.  I never understood why my chicken breasts always taste so dry but no more!

I have made this a couple times for company and received rave reviews.  Today I made it using boneless pork loin chops instead of chicken.  Delicious with either one.  I also cut back on the soy sauce and quadrupled the horseradish.  Great go-to recipe for company and nice that it has to marinate a while giving you plenty of time to do other things.  6-8 hours is plenty.

I made this as written, and the chicken turned out so-so.  I didn't taste any other flavor, really, than soy sauce.  The chicken was tender, but I was hoping for a better flavor combination, not just overwhelming soy sauce.

This was the best.  I used chicken breast with the bone and they were so big I had a hard time getting them done, can't wait to use it again with boneless.  I usually buy the seasoned ones at the meat market, never again.  This is better than 5 stars.  Right now my New York strips are marinating in it.  Had leftover because I had such a big package for only 4 of us, and as I said they were big ones.  Chopped up the leftover and made chicken enchiladas....yum.

This was absolutely amazing! I used chicken cutlets, marinated them for about an hour and a half. I also added just a little bit of fresh grated ginger to the marinade, and then cooked them up on the stove with a little bit of olive oil. Served over fresh greens this makes a great light meal.

I used less soy sauce than called for cause I didn't want the chicken to just taste like soy sauce.  Couldn't taste the horseradish at all, will add more next time.  Good marinade but I think needs some tweaking to be better.

This is a fabulous, flavorful marinade!  At the advice of another reviewer, I grated a bit of fresh ginger in the mix, added a tad more horseradish (which we still couldn't taste), forgot to add the oil, and it was delicious!  I had it soaking for nearly 9 hours, tossed the chicken pieces on the grill for just the right amount of time, and the end result was a tender delicious piece of meat.  My hubby couldn't believe that the main marinade ingredient was soda (Mountain Dew, in our case).   Yum!!

I cut down the soy sauce to 1/2 cup, eliminated the horseradish, and baked the chicken rather than grilling. It wasn't bad, but it might be better if I actually followed the recipe.

Easy to put together and tasted pretty good.  I used 1 1/2 TBSP. of minced garlic instead of garlic powder and marinated it overnight.
