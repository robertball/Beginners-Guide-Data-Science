A few additional notes on this recipe, which I submitted: Make sure the bacon is cooked until crisp; tugging on a piece of chewy, chocolate covered bacon is messy and not very appetizing! Also, the melted chocolate is sometimes a little on the thick side. If that happens to you, just use your fork to paint the chocolate onto the bacon. I hope you enjoy it!

I've been buying chocolate covered bacon at Marini's Candy Shops in Santa Cruz California, OMG it's a decadent treat so completely delicious and completely wicked, but worth a try now and then. I've made it at home too, it's relatively easy and the main trick is to have REALLY crispy bacon, blot it well after frying and before dipping or brushing on chocolate, and I've found thin-sliced bacon works best, thick-sliced tends to get tough after cooling.  At Marini's they make it with both milk chocolate and also DARK chocolate, WOW! Now THAT'S a party in your mouth!

These were different from any dessert I have ever tried, I like the salty and sweet flavors together.  The chocolate was way to thick, so I added 2-4 tablespoons of milk to it to help it melt and make it easier to dip the bacon in.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I thought because I adore chocolate AND bacon that I would love this savory/sweet treat but it was not the recipe I hoped it would be. A variation on savory/sweet bacon in to fry your bacon very slow and before it's done, drain the fat and then add (approx. 1/2 cup per lb bacon) honey and continue cooking until the bacon is well done. You want to cook this slow so the bacon doesn't crisp up but stays chewy. Great for breakfast or on top of salads.

Addictingly good! I actually snapped the bacon into bite-size pieces before throwing them into the bowl of melted chocolate. If the chocolate is too thick, add a splash of milk.

I also baked my bacon over a rack placed over a foil lined baking sheet until really crispy. I put them onto a paper towel to soak up the rest of the grease & waited for them to cool before throwing them into the bowl of melted chocolate.

Though it was tasty it was a bit much. And you have to eat them fresh or the bacon looses its crisp and it is soggy bacon dipped in chocolate.

These were a HIT at our Christmas morning brunch...what a great conversation piece!! They were also very tasty too...despite what you may think.  I liken them to the preztel/chocolate combo...Excellent though...really yummy salty chocolate combo!! I used semi sweet choc chips...
