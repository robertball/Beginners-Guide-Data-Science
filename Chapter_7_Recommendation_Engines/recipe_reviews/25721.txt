This was great! I substituted 3/4 lb of ground beef for the chicken livers (not too keen on them, sorry!) - I also added 1/2 cup chopped celery and 1/4 lb chopped bell pepper. I will definitely make this again. Be careful with the cayenne pepper, if you can't handle spicy food!
Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this several times.  I swithced to only using chicken livers (no gizzards) for pure convenience - and I couldn't tell much difference in the final taste.  At first I chopped the livers but that resulted in strong tastes of liver every once in a while.  I went to using the blender and that made all the difference in the taste.  I got over how the pureed livers looked in the blender.  I make a big batch now.  It seems to get better and better the second and third day.  This is a great recipe.

Wow.  I've spent a lot of time in Louisiana around the coastal areas and have eaten more than my fair share of dirty rice without believing it was as simple as this recipe.  The flavors seem so complex!  When my husband requested dirty rice to be served alongside my shrimp etouffe, I tried this basic recipe, thinking I would later make changes and create my own using this recipe as the structure. Wow. Completely unnecessary!  The ONLY thing I added was a 1/4 t of white pepper and 1/2 t of salt. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

WOW this is so YUMMY!  I changed a thing or 2, due to I didnt have all the ingriedents listed.  I used a pound of chicken livers and 2 small vidalia onions sauteed with the chicken livers.  I sauteed them in bacon grease too.  I added Mrs. dash spicy pepper blend, it has cayenne in it.  I also added a decent dash of garlic salt.  My husband ate 3 servings of it, "jethro bodine servings"!. My kids even ate it and they hate chicken livers and wont eat rice, but they liked this.  I didnt tell them it was livers in it though.  Hats off to you Kathleen and your elders, who invented this recipe!  It is delicious!!!!!

Traditional dirty rice is a beautiful (ugly!) thing, and this is IT.  So good, be prepared to give out your recipe.  I do add celery and bell pepper with the onion (aka The Trinity of Cajun & Creole cooking).  I would say that if you are squeamish about the gizzards and livers, try it once this traditional way and see if it changes your mind.  You might find that dem bayou folks know their food better than you thought! ;-)

I used a pound of spicy sausage instead of the livers and gizzards and cut back on the cayenne just a little.  Turned out great!  My husband loved this recipe.

This is by far the worst recipe that I have ever made.  I followed this recipe exactly and would not recommend it to ANYBODY!!    It might be better with something other than the liver and gizzards (both of which I generally like).

I like many, substituted the liver and gizzards with ground beef since its what I had handy. It turned out delicious and my husband raved about it. I will try it next time with chicken livers. Hubby said it was better than Popeyes.

This is okay, but true dirty rice doesn't use green onion.  Green onion is for salads or decoration.  It should also have celery.  That is one of the MAIN ingredients.  It's cooked with the livers.  Gizzards should not be in this, it makes it gritty.  Deep fry the gizzards as a side, much better as side dish.

Very nice, Sha!! Excellent flavor, LOVED IT!!! Will make again and again!!  Rated 4 stars b/c the Trinity (onion, bell pepper & celery) was not used. Why no celery, Sha?  For those that want to sub sausage, I highly recommend using ANDOUILLE Sausage; it's a Louisiana sausage, most large supermarkets will carry it. If y'all find the gizzards too tough, boil them first. I pulse livers (and gizzards if I use them) in the food processor, as I like finer pieces rather than a rough chop. Bacon drippings (or butter if no drippings) are soooo good, Sha, instead of oil!!!

Great! I don't like rice, but loved this. I made it with pork sausage since no one in the house likes those particular chicken parts. I came out amazing! It's so good, we are having it again tomorrow so the kids can have it! Definitely a keeper!!

GREAT recipe!!!! This was a wonderful & easy recipe all in one! The only thing I added different was Jimmy Deans hot breakfast sausage and cut up jalapeno's. I cooked the sausage and broke it up into the cooked meat. My family and I will be saying GOODBYE to Tony Chachere's forever! Thanks a million!

My people come from New Iberia, La., and we have dirty rice at all dinners.  The combination of ground chuck and chicken livers, browned to perfection make this the perfect rice for any dinner.  White pepper gives it that 'hint of heat' witout the flames, but we like it hot, so we get free with the pepper hand.

It was a bit spicy but I adjusted it and used all chicken livers. It was easy and perfect and way less than takeout, which is how I normally get dirty rice.

Very good base recipe to add extra incredients to suite your taste.  Instead of putting the chicken livers in a blender, I sauteed them and then just used a potato masher in the skillet to break up but not smash.  This is a keeper.

This is great dirty rice!  I couldn't find the gizzards or livers this time so I used turkey meat and also turkey broth.  The flavor reminds me of some of my favorite cajun restaurants in Texas.

This was really good!  I had dirty rice in a cajun restaurant at Bricktown in Oklahoma City and wanted a reciped that tasted like theirs.  This one came very close.  I followed others suggestions and made a substitute for the livers & gizzards using ground turkey and added a little ground pork sausage.  I also added some Tony Chachere's creole seasoning.  I didn't top with the green onion, as I had none.  I will make this again.

Very good, but the gizzards get a bit chewy when they're cooked so long.  Also, be very careful with the cayenne pepper--this rice has an awesome flavor but we could hardly stand to eat it, and we're spicy food junkies!

I've made this several times now and love it. I use 1 lb of liver and 1/2 lb of spicy sausage for the meat (to please my tastes.) I also up the cayenne to a teaspoon and leave out the green onions. Turns out just the way I like it. EDIT: I have now FINALLY figured out how to not make this dish wet. I cook my sausage and liver and then drain them well, and set aside. I then add 2 tablespoons of oil to the pan and add rice that has been washed in hot water and drained in cold until the water runs clear, into the pan. I toast the rice until it's golden brown, then add onions and toast some more. Then I add the meat, spices, and hot broth to the pan. Super fluffy rice!

We too wanted to like this dish better (it has so many high ratings.) I found it not enough broth to cook the rice...I think the other ingredients absorbed too much of the liquid. I had to add more broth. Anyway, we've had better dirty rice, but thought we'd try this one for a change. Won't make again. Sorry.

I'm from North Dakota and 40 years old. ONE TIME I had the pleasure of eating Southern Soul Food at a Baptist Church Fundraiser. For $10 I had one of the most memorable, delicious, "HEAVENLY" meals. With my birthday coming up I've decided that I will recreate my meal and I turned here to find the recipes. Although the thought of liver makes my mouth water [in a bad way] I decided after much deliberation to go for it-ALL IN, BABY!!! Well, I used just half pound of livers, I've tasted chicken gizzards and couldn't do it. Suprise, surprise, if I hadn't made it I wouldn't have guessed it, chicken livers pureed in the food processor are nothing like the beef liver and onions my mother has made for years! Unfortunately I only had Cajun seasoning on hand so I used a half teaspoon of that thinking it would equal the 1/4 teaspoon plus the seasonings. I just ate my first bowlful. Oh, one more thing...I could not resist the tempation to fry up one thick slice of bacon and add one green pepper and some celery. Final judgment? It's good. Not salty enough. And I have to say there's not enough heat. But I don't have the complete meal either. My next attempt will be greens and I am serving it with chicken-fried pork chops and cornbread as well. Do not be afraid to try chicken livers, I am glad I did. I really want authenticity, though I"m sure nothing I ever turn out will come close to the delicacies those wonderful church ladies shared. God bless mamas who cook!!!!

Added onion and diced green pepper. A few extra seasonings because it was too bland beforehand. Made a nice sidedish for my Mardi Gras dinner.

Yesterday, I was looking for a side dish to go with grilled shish kabob, so I tried this recipe, and it was very good.  I agree, though, that the cayenne pepper should be used sparingly.  I omitted the gizzard and liver because my boyfriend is watching his cholesterol and, anyway, we didn't need additional meat in that dinner.  This recipe is actually very much like the version of northern Italian risotto my mother always made.  Thanks, Kathleen.

A-one recipe. I'm a Southern girl and have found that several recipes add beef, beans and corn.  Since when does dirty rice have these ingredients?!
This is good ole comfort food for me.
Thx, DD

I made this the other night for dinner. Followed basic recipe but used all chicken livers (pulsed in food processer) and added my own homemade cajun seasoning mix. Was quite good. Even my husband and daughter liked it and they turn their nose up at anything with liver in it. Score!

I only made minor changes.  I did not have the livers so I used a pack of hearts and gizzards I had on hand. I pressure cooked these prior to using for the recipe and ground them up cooked.  I added half a jalapeno for added spice and a few stalks of celery.  This has amazing flavor and makes me feel like I have overcome another southern favorite. Great recipe!

This was sooo good. My fiance' is from Louisiana and said this recipe was the best dirty rice he has ever had. He wants me to make it for everyone the next time we make it down there from NY to visit. I used 1.25 pounds of livers because the tub I bought came in that weight and I just threw it all in my food processor. I did not have gizzards this time and based on dirty rice I have had in the past I didn't really miss it. I will try it with both and see what I like best. The only problem I had was that the liquid absorbed too fast and I had to add more so the rice would cook all the way. I think that was my fault though...I had it on low but, it was on my power burner and probably still a bit too high. Definitely will be making again and again!!!!

This the closest to the real stuff ever. I was taught to cook gizzards in broth till done, toss in the livers cook till no longer pink(as written from old recipe)Then chop till fine pieces, then really brown them add the trinity and rice. Cook till rice starts turning white, add broth gizzards cooked in to cover rice by an at least 1/2". Bring to a boil , cover turn down heat to a simmer, cook rice till done. Must let sit for 5-10 minutes then fluff with a fork. Per the recipe you were supposed to know to add salt and pepper, no cayenne or such. This was used as a side dish or in case that's all there was to feed your family. I said this was an old recipe Mary

I am so glad I tried this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was totally delicious. Next time I make it I will leave out the gizzards (too much trouble). When I reheated it I drizzled about 1 tsp of oil from a jar of hot giardinara. Wow, just plain delicious. Thank you Kathleen for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is a keeper! I've been looking for creative things to do with leftover chicken giblets when I roast a chicken, and I think this will be my "go-to" recipe. I halved the recipe, and there was enough liver/gizzard/etc. to "dirty" the rice.

Wanted to love this....I really, really did. Followed it to the letter. Got brave and went for the liver. Mistake. Liver just is NOT for me. 

Don't let the die-hard liver reviews fool you (like they did me). This may be good....with ground beef. But liver?

I tried this recipe, the only difference that I made was that I used butter instead of oil and added some shredded carrot to it and used the serving converter to make it for 2 servings. It turned out delicious, not too spicey, and will definitely be doing this recipe again in the future.

Wonderful, authentic recipe. Served to our minister who is from Baton Rouge... he thought it was like his Mom's.  Omitted the gizzards, and it was just fine. None of the northerners knew what the meat bits were, and were shocked that they liked it when we told them :-). I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is an awesome recipe.  I used ground spicy italian sausage in place of livers and gizzards (didn't have any on hand).  I browned the sausage and then ground it fine with the food processor.  This was so good..... It is way better than Bojangles dirty rice which is my favorite.  I am so pleased I can now make a better version at home.  Oh, I didn't add all the cayenne pepper and mine was very spicy.

I've made this recipe 3 times now and I LOVE IT!  It reminds me of boudin...without the casing. It's very very easy to make.
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This is it!  This is sholey it!  Don't change a thing!  Y'all have got remember that down here we know how to make gizzards and livers taste delicious, because that's what we have left after the chicken is eat.  Use the freshest ingredients you can get your hands on, and use plenty of cayenne pepper!

I grew up in the Mississippi Delta region, and this is pretty familiar "good stuff" to me. If you want to be more authentic and less healthy, use a big spoonful of bacon grease instead of the vegetable oil. Remember most folks will salt and pepper at the table, so the amounts listed here are fine . . . and if you're not used to Cajun spices, take it easy on the cayenne. Otherwise, this is it.  Good, delicious, homestyle comfort food--and easy!

For what it's worth, I LOVE your idea of using the food processor to pre-mash the meat. You took the work out! :)

This was good and easy. To add nutrients I threw in some minced carrots, celery and parsley when I added the broth. I felt like it needed a bit more seasoning for my taste so I also added some Cajun seasoning.

True to cajun cooking! Loved the recipe. I had only chicken livers so that's what I used. I added celery and green bell pepper to have that trinity with the onions. This recipe makes a huge amount. It would have been fine with half of the recipe, making enough for my family of four with some leftovers. My only suggestion is to make sure you use short grain rice for this. I only had basmati rice and the texture just wasn't right. That's my fault, not the recipe.

This dish turn out perfect. I only used a bit less liver, because the prepackaged container had a lesser amount then called for in the recipe.

What an amazing recipe....DON'T use salted chicken broth....and then add salt....I made that mistake after hunting down chicken livers for 3 days.  Don't think I didn't eat it though.

I will definitely make it again. The gizzards need to be trimmed prior to processing,  I added more cayenne and added 1 cup of green onions prior to simmering and topped with an additional cup before serving.

I liked this recipe very much - it was tasty and very easy to make. My family was not as keen on it, but I'm writing the review (so there!)
After reading the reviews, I added chopped green peppers and a little celery (leaves & maybe a small stalk that I had blanched & frozen) to give it that Louisiana taste. I also threw in a large chopped leek that I had on hand. My package of chicken livers included what were called stomachs, which I presumed meant gizzards, but what turned out to be hearts. I was a bit worried about this, but the result was very good. My package had about 1.5 pounds (750 grams), so the result was a little heavier on the meat. Instead of cayenne powder (couldn't find it on the shelf!), I added 2 tsp. of my homemade Cajun seasoning mix. Next time I will certainly add a little cayenne powder as well, to give the dish a little more bite.  I did not add salt while cooking, as I thought the broth probably was salty enough, but it turned out to need a little more. Fortunately this is easy to fix at the table. I omitted the green onions, following recommendations that they were "not traditional" - besides, I didn't have any:) 
It may seem as if I made a lot of changes, but I think they were well in line with the spirit of the recipe.  I would make this again, reducing the amount next time, as this made a lot of food.

Let's just say that this wasn't quite for me with as much liver as it asked for. The rice and everything else was cooked very nicely but next time I'll adjust the meat used.

This was gorgeous,  sans onions. Unfortunately,  the knowledge of what was in it was so off putting, with the help of a critical teen who'd walked in while I was cooking, it was spoiled for me! Neighbours & friends who didn't know the ingredients,  adored it too. Next time I'll use ground chicken because the flavour is truly outstanding for those with less squeamish stomachs & fewer graphic teens who love to ruin dinner for everybody. Thanks for the recipe. I'll use it again & again with straight ground chicken.

Needs bell pepper!  I added bell pepper and omitted the gizzards (don't like the texture), and it was excellent. Also, the addition of green onion was too much.  I do appreciate, however, that this recipe uses chicken livers,

I have been making dirty rice for years! The recipe I make usually takes about an hour to prepare alone.  I was looking for something quick and simple. This recipe is just that. Not as flavorful as the dirty rice I make but none-the-less it is good. I did however, use a little over a 1/2 lb of gizzards I LOVE GIZZARDS!! (boil them first!  rinse them off then put in a food processor to finely mince.) I used 1/2 group turkey instead of liver (yuck). I used equal amounts of green bell pepper, yellow onion and celery. (these are a few of the ingredients I use in my own recipe). The kids love it so that's all tht matters. It's easy and quick enough for me to make for dinner regularly vs. my own. Thanks for sharing.

Small correction to my review.  Thaw the frozen meat/veg mixture, heat in skillet, add rice, proceed from there.  (I wish allrecipes.com would (1) let us see the recipe we're reviewing as we write the review, (2) make it a little easier to read and edit our reviews before submission.)

Always like to look at others and bring ideas together. While I don't use gizzards, I would had never thought of pre-pulsing in a food processor. Doesn't look good, but is the best way yet to get a little meat in every bite.

We regularly crave this! I don't use gizzards but sometimes add bacon and left over chicken or a few peas. Simple, fast and easily adapted to leftovers.

I have also used the Dirty Rice left overs to make fried rice cakes for a side dish the next night.

I boiled my chicken to get broth, then I drained the broth off of the chicken then added my rice, oil and garlic. No livers or gizzards. Used chicken instead...a real southern classic. No onions....no cayenne pepper...just season salt

I boiled the gizzards first to get homemade chicken broth, then chopped them and added to the rice when cooked.  Skipped the liver.  I also sauteed celery and green bell pepper with the onion.  Used Cajun seasoning instead of straight cayenne.

I make this recipe a lot. I like to use mirepoix (carrots, onion, and celery) instead of just onion, and sometimes I add a little extra cayenne. Very tasty.

This is the best one yet. I added a stalk of celery and 2 tbsp. of cilantro and it came out really good. My 5 year old even asked for more and of course she didn't know that there were gizzards and livers in it. Thanks for sharing.

I grew up in New Orleans and dirty rice was always a staple dish that was comforting and filling. It is good to finally find a recipe that gets it. I did make a few changes so that this would more closely mimic the rice I grew up with and loved. The rice my mom, aunts, and grandmother made always had bits of chicken in it, ground beef, and more seasonings. So here is what I did: I seasoned 1 bone-in chicken breast and 1 chicken thigh with Old Bay seasoning and then baked them, shredded them and added to the cooked gizzard/liver mixture. I added some browned ground beef. I also added some sauteed green peppers and diced celery. I did everything else the same and this was a winner. Thanks for posting this recipe.

I really liked this recipe and it wasn't hard to do. I used chicken gizzards and hearts instead of livers and diced the meat instead of using a food processor. I also used brown rice so I had to simmer it about 45 minutes or more. The flavor with this recipe was excellent and the dish ended up being popular.

FANTASTIC! Im from southeast Texas & miss my cajun food....this was pure comfort for me..the real deal sha. I used gizzards & hearts since thats the only way they sold it in the store, then ground beef instead of the liver since the liver were frozen solid. Also, had to add some Tony's seasoning & bell pepper,(that's the cajun way anyway..toss in a little this & that) SO GOOD!! Thank you!

I have never had dirty rice before and it's great. Only, is the rice suppose to be mushy? I followed the recipes exactly and the rice ended up really soft, more like a porridge. Next time, I will use 1 cup of broth to 1 cup of white rice - of course, the amount of liquid should depend on the type of white so I would go by the rice cooking instruction and not by how much liquid is called for in this recipes.

Like some other people, I also added celery and bell pepper. Instead of livers or gizzard I added Spicy Italian Sausage and a little hamburger. I did not add cayenne since I am using Spicy Sausage. I also am sauteing the veggies in the fat from the meat instead of oil.

My husband and I are not big fans of liver or gizzards so I added 1 lb of spicy sausage and chicken breasts cubed.  So delicious!  Just the right amount of spice and really hearty with brown rice. Thanks for the recipe.

I love this dish.  I have never been in the south, am not familiar with southern cooking, but this rice is amazing.  Serve with lots of pickled everything (pickled cucumbers, marinated tomatoes, green and black olives, giardiniera salad, pepperoncini peppers)...

This recipe is GREAT. I'm not sure where the idea of adding ground beef comes from but I'm sure it tastes ok. BUT, if you want authentic southern (Gullah) rice, this is it with no changes.

This was easy and surprisingly quite a hit with my rather picky 3 year old.  My only problem is that although I am a confirmed carnivore, I found the blending of the chicken livers (I only used livers) disgusting and it spoiled my appetite.

LOVE this recipe!  super simple but very tasty.  i substituted the gizzards and livers for 1 lb. ground beef (i'm a wuss, i know)...used beef drippings in place of oil and red pepper flakes and a bit of chili powder in place of the cayenne.  it was delicious, and it smelled wonderful while it was cooking.  microwaved leftovers for 2 1/2 mins. for a quick and easy lunch at the office.  thank you for sharing this recipe, i will definitely make it again!

We raise our own chickens, so this recipe was a natural for us. So I risked some of our home butchered (light years better than from the store!) livers on this. We didn't save the gizzards last year, so had to skip that part. Other than that, made as submitted. Wow! I had no idea dirty rice could be this good. I had always had with hamburger before. Very simple also. MAKE THIS RECIPE....thank you Kathleen!

I used some thinly sliced chicken breast meat.  Instead of the Cayenne pepper I used Franks Hot Sauce - a full tbsp of it (we like it hot).  Great tasting recipe.

This was a great recipe with a few modifications.  I did use sausage slices instead of the chicken parts.  I also used petite rice.  I tried it again with Risotto rice, but that wasn't nearly as good.  All in all an excellent recipe with a couple of substitutions since I didn't have everything called for.  The spices really made the dish!

I love dirty rice but had never attempted to make it.  This was easy and excellent.  I made it for Easter Dinner and all 17 attendees loved it - but dish served.
