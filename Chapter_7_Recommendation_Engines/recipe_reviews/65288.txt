Loved this! I am familiar with making zucchini this way but I've always used olive oil. Sauteeing the squash in butter, however, really aided in the browning factor and gave this a wonderful, rich color. I used a combo of zucchini and yellow squash, fresh garlic rather than garlic powder, and just used the soy sauce and toasted sesame seeds to taste. Very nice presentation and great flavor.

It seemed it was missing something. After reading all the reviews I did as another member had suggested and drizzled honey over it and BAM! that was the flavor this needed. Sounded strange enough to try and I'm glad I did. The honey worked the sesame seeds too. Will make again this way.

I think people should make the changes they wish and not pan the recipe.  If you want changes, just make them.  Aseleener need not have bothered to state ALL the changes she would have made.  It was obviously not for her; so just don't make it, for Heaven's sake!  Food is a personal thing; cooks have their own preferences.  Constructive suggestions are fine, but this review was over the top... or should I say below the belt?

Sorry, I have multiple issues with this recipe. I don't think 1 zucchini is enough to make 4 servings. I guess it depends on the size, but I would use 2 medium instead. Secondly, why does the ingredient list say to divide the soy sauce? The directions have you put it in all at once. Thirdly, that's too much soy sauce. I would use 1 tbsp. Instead of using garlic powder, I would use 1 clove fresh garlic and also some fresh grated ginger. I would also use olive oil instead of the butter. Also, I think 2 tbsp sesame seeds is too much; 1 tbsp would suffice.  As written, this ends up way too salty and is not enough for 4 adults.

Excellent recipe!  I have made this with a mixture of zucchini, squash, onions & carrots.  They all tasted great, but be careful to not overcook!  Have used this recipe several times & it is a favorite

Overall a good recipe - not great, but good. I quartered the zucchini lengthwise, and cooked it as directed (made an interesting presentation). I used fresh garlic and added 2 tsp of honey when adding the soy sauce as others suggested.

I think this would taste better with olive oil or peanut oil instead of butter, the butter was a bit heavy. And you don't need to use that many sesame seeds. Otherwise it was alright, I'll make it again with these changes.

Other than the sesame seeds, which I replaced with sesame oil, I followed this recipe exactly.  It was good but it needed a little oomph.  I'd recommend a little honey, minced garlic rather than powdered, and a little General Tso's or Hoisin sauce for flavor.

3.2.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/65288/asian-style-zucchini/ ... If I'd learn to read recipes & write neatly, I'd probably do better at cooking in general ... I didn't write down directions only ingredients & a couple brackets to contain groups.  I cooked the zucchini till it was nearly ready, not lightly browned; but I guess if you like yours notsodone, that'd be fine.  I like browned slices; browned as in the grilled look.  Then added 1T sesame seeds.  'Played with them a while to somewhat toast them & added 1T soy sauce.  'Removed from heat.  You really don't want to cook soy sauce straight (without being an addition to an already wet sauce).  I stirred that just a bit - till it stopped sizzling - & added the 1T sesame oil I thought I read.  Right there it was a three star.  With a little crushed red pepper, four easy.  Adding ginger might be good, too; but I got scared.  :o  :)  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I don't know about other places; but, here, in the South, our zucchini doesn't come in sizes.  It's picked at about six inches or less = I used two.  It wasn't overly saucey, but a little strong so I added a cup or more of heated, cooked bowtie pasta.  Pretty cute.

I usually hate zucchini, but this was pretty good. Just to get a variety of veggies I will probably make this again. Just don't put too much soy sauce in it or they will be too soggy.

Not bad.  I used regular green zucchini and yellow pattypan squash for this, which worked well.  I only added a bit of soy sauce and sesame seeds; it really doesnt require a huge amount.  Very easy, and quick too.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, but I felt like I needed to 1/2 the whole thing except add more zucchini.  Maybe I just needed a larger zucchini, but it seemed alittle overpowering with all the sesame seeds and soy sauce.  Next time I'll use less and it will have a better flavor and still taste like zucchini

Great base dish to play with. Added a bit of onion and half the sesame seeds. Dash of salt was necessary. At end of cooking zucchini, added 1/2 lb chicken breasts cooked in soy sauce with salt/pepper to taste that had been cut in long strips. Served over rice noodles. Delicious!

I love this, I use yellow squash with zucchini,onion,slivered carrots and green bellpepper and red if I have it. Bell pepper makes a difference too. I'll have to try pouring on the honey as another did. We're big on veggies.

We made several minor changes (more geared towards our taste).  We replaced the butter w/ olive oil, used lite soy sauce, 1 clove minced garlic (instead of garlic powder) & cut back (less than 1/4c, toasted) of sesame seeds.  Overall, easy & good.

Without giving a weight to the zucchini it was had to estimate.  I used 1 1/2pounds zuke and using 1/2 cup would have been way to much sesame seeds.  I only used 2 tablespoons and was content with that.

Overall, this recipe is quick and easy.  We tried it with some grilled ribs and a pasta/cheese side dish.  I found by adding some drizzled honey on the zucchini just prior to serving, it helped balance out the soy a bit.

I don't know if it was a misprint, but 1/2 cup of sesame seeds for the amount of zuchini (and I added extra zuchini) was excessive.  It was just okay.

Excellent!   My wife and I love zucchini and we are always looking for new recipes.   Even my son liked this one!   I did follow some of the suggestions from others (added fresh garlic instead of powder, cut the sesame seeds in half, and added honey).   I did keep the 2 tablespoons of soy sauce as I like that flavor, but I put in one tablespoon early in the frying of the zucchini and another later on.  I also used an olive oil cooking spray instead of the butter, to help cut down on the saturated fats.   They browned nicely dispite that change.  It was great!  We will make this again soon.   Thanks for sharing!

I used onions and yellow bell pepper along with the zucchini and served this with white rice to make a very satisfying & quick light meal.  The only change in the seasoning I made was to use a few drops of sesame oil (instead of seeds) and about a tsp of white sugar mixed with the soy sauce.

Overall, a pretty good recipe.  The ingredients take a little "eyeballing" as every zucchini is a different size.  We used poppyseeds because we didn't have sesame.  We also used olive oil to make it more healthy.

Great recipe TrinityJae!  My hubby & I like zucchini but the kids don't-but it didn't matter we wolfed down the 4 servings all by ourselves!  This is a good way to quickly fix zucchini.

I didn't really care for these, they were a little soggy for my taste. I think the Zucchini are fine just in a little butter and garlic.

This was great paired with a butter-herb rice. The soy sauce gives this zucchini a bold flavor. I added minced real garlic in with the butter before adding the zucchini. Also I only used one tablespoon of sesame seeds.

This is a great way to use zucchini. I have made it a dozen times and the only change I made was to use sesame oil instead of sesame seeds. This will definitely stay in the rotation.

It was delicious!  It takes A LOT like the hibachi restaurant style veggies!  I think it called for way too much sesame seeds unless one uses at least 2 large zucchini. The next time I make this (tomorrow night!), I’m going to add in some mushrooms & sweet onion. I can’t wait!

Another way of having zucchini. Only gave it a 3 because it was ok, but next time we'll fry garlic in the butter first for more flavor instead of using garlic powder. Also, you can't really "brown" zucchini because it has so much moisture in it. My biggest problem was with the soy sauce because it says to divide it. In the instructions I didn't see anything about using only part of the soy sauce at different times. Will make again, but with cloves of garlic & maybe some fried onion & mushroom also.

Really wasn't anything special or amazing. It's zuicchini with soy sauce and that's what it tastes like. I think it could really use some additional spices or flavorings.

Just reading this and the reviews, certain things come to mind.  First, Asian cooking rarely ( if at all) uses butter in cooking. I would substitute peanut oil or other tasteless oil.  Then I might add a scant teaspoon of sesame oil for flavor. 
Second, there was a remark that one zucchini is not enough for 4 servings.  The recipe calls for a large Zucchini; the ones I find in most western groceries is quite small.

Very good, I substituted sesame oil in place of the butter - used yellow squash, vidalia onions and a sweet red bell pepper. It was delicious. Making it again tonight with zucchini, yellow squash, vidalia onions and sweet bell peppers. So quick and simple but very tasty.

SO good! Truth be told I didn't even like zuchinni before I tried it this way. I'd originally picked this recipe because everyone else in my household was so tired of the same old veggies, and I wanted to cook them something totally different. By the time the dish was done, it smelled so I good I just had to try it. Probably my favorite vegetable dish now. The zuchinni was still a bit crunchy and had just the right amout of flavor. I also made some restaurant-style ginger sauce to dip it in and it was wonderful.

I didn't care for this recipe.  I thought the soy sauce overpowered the zucchini.

I am in love!!  This is the most delicious zucchini I've ever tasted & I make zucchini a lot.  Be sure to brown the zucchini before adding the soy sauce.  Total cooking time was 30 minutes for me.   Super tender & sooo tasty!

very good way to use zucchini.  Drizzling honey on it was a very good tip...will use this recipe often.

This was delicious. I followed an earlier review and added some honey. Another said to reduce the sesame seeds which I also did. My husband and I both loved it.

Don't overdo the soy and spices, unless it's going with something plain like white rice.
