I love salsa, so waiting 8 hours to eat this was out of the question. I compromised by putting most in the fridge, and left a small sample to try out. And wow, is this stuff good! Being a huge cilantro fan, this recipe was right up my alley. I can only imagine how great this will taste tomorrow. I'm tempted to eat this with a spoon, it's that good. Great recipe!

I made this pretty much as listed, but I used organic petite diced tomatoes (juice drained of course).  I also used whole cumin that I toasted and ground before adding to salsa.  This added great flavor!
This was easy to make,and even the kidos gobbled it up.  Thanks!

Very nice recipe. I added a can of corn(drained), and black beans(rinsed & drained). Everyone that ate it loved it.

This recipe is great.  I followed it exactly.  Lots of flavor and color and it is even better the next day. I would not change a thing but, if you want, its a great base to play with.

Fresh and the Best!  I made this yesterday for a Derby party and unfortunatley came home with none left over.  You can adjust the spice to your likeness and although it calls for 8 hrs of refrigeration, it was very tasty the day it was made.  I guess I will need to make it again and regrig so that I can report on the taste the day after!

This was SO NOT a salsa.  This was a pico de gallo.  With that said, it was excellent for what it was.  I love cilantro and I love salsa.  But given that we made this for a salsa that was to be used in multiple recipes as well as a disk on it's own, it was a letdown at the time...

Wow!! This is so fresh and zesty. I love that you can modify the level of heat with the jalape√±o and even the siracha  sauce. I made this for a Labor Day BBQ and it was gone in an hour!!  Our family loves cilantro so this hit the spot. My BF even said this was better than his salsa and he makes very tasty salsa. I have a feeling this will be on the top of the bring to a BBQ list for me. I didn't change one thing from the recipe either. Thank you!!

This was fantastic! I didn't have tomatillos but I added chopped advocado because I thought  it fit all of the flavors! It worked perfectly...but...it didn't keep for leftovers so next time I'll leave out the advocado!
