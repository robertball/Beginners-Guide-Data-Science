If you want something spicier, use Busha Brown's Jamaican Jerk (it's in a jar) instead of McCormick.  I tried it with that, and it was the best recipe I've found on this website.

This recipe was easy and very tasty.  It was a big hit for Sunday dinner.

I substituted frozen mango chunks for the pineapple because I felt that was more authentically Jamaican. I also increased the jerk seasoning to give it more kick as well as more cider vinegar and some water to give a more liquidy sauce (and to replace the liquid from the pineapple). Finally I used a green bell pepper (much cheaper than the red ones).  This was delicious and easy-definitely worth a try.

I loved this recipe, it was perfect for the first dinner on our deck this year!  I did change/add a few things.  First of all I used a white meaty fish, Sea bass.  I pan seared it then finished it off on the grill.  Very tasty.  I also added a jalapeno and some red onion with the red pepper.  I used crushed pineapple but I think next time I will use 1/2 crushed 1/2 tidbits.  This would be a great dinner to make for company.  And I agree with what someone wrote earlier...double the pineapple, I am having it over chicken tonight!

Great recipe! It sounds odd to put black beans and pineapple together, but just wait till you try it! The second time I made this I doubled the "salsa" because we couldn't get enough of it the first time. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

This was a great dish.  I always get a litte nervous about trying new dishes out on my husband but he really liked it and said I should make it again.  I used pork chop on the bone so I had to triple the flour and seasoning mix in order to have enough for the sauce for them to simmer in.

YUM!  I have made this recipe twice now, and my guests both times raved about it.  I premixed the peppers, pineapple, and beans and let sit in the fridge for a couple of hours so that the flavors would meld.  I have tried this with both chicken and pork chops and both ways were great.  Serve over white rice.  Make sure you have plenty of milk handy because the jerk seasoning provides quite a kick!

I've always been wary about mixing fruit with meat, it just sounds wierd. This is the first recipe I've tried with that combo and I have to say it is DELICIOUS! The only change I made is that I grill the chops, then simmer in the salsa. Also, adding orange peppers accentuates the beautiful array of colors. I will definitely make this a regular dish!

This was amazing! I made it the early part of this week. I used Chicken instead of pork and we all loved it. I did double the amount of flour/seasoning mixture but when adding the remainder as indicated at the end...I only used half into the pan. There was not enough liquid for me so I added water to it. With the flour mixture...seasonings...etc...it made the perfect sauce. I will definitely be making this one again!

The pork chops came out great! Though, I think more spice is needed, maybe some bread crumbs too.  The salsa was great, but there was too many black beans.  Perhaps half the amount next time would make it better. Otherwise it was great!  Chunks of pineapple worked with this recipe too!

This recipe was excellent.  Would not change a thing.  The kids and my husband loved it.  Had to triple the ingredients (very large family).

We were sent the Jamaican Jerk seasoning from
the islands -- found this recipe and were we
pleased!!  Absolutely delicious and very different
Just the right amount of "jerk" !! Would not change anything.  Thanks to the other reviews --
I find them so helpful.   Claudette

This was awesome....my husband raved over it. I couldn't find the McCormack jerk spice, so I used some jerk paste that I had. I rubbed the chops and marinated them, then floured them before cooking. I also added in some cooked black eyed peas to make it go a bit further. It was a bit sweet, next time might omit the sugar as the pineapple is sweet enough, but otherwise just right. Very tasty!

Very good!  Has a nice kick, but it was a bit much for my younger kids.  I served it over pasta, but it would probably be even better over brown rice.

I love this recipe!  It's sweet and spicy and tastes great over rice.  Some variations I've tried: instead of pork chops, I use fresh, cubed chicken breast and stir it all together like stir-fry.  Instead of pineapple, I used canned mangoes.  It's delicious no matter how I make it!

Wasn't that crazy about this recipe, but since have adapted the salsa ingredients and mixed them with rice as a nice side dish with grilled chicken or pork tenderloin. We love it!Sometimes add chopped mango to the rice too.

This was pretty good.  I used chicken instead of pork.  My fiance liked it well enough he just likes some of the other things I've made better.  It was easy to make and I will probably make it again with the pork.

I followed the recipe just like it said. The pork chops were tender but the flavor was terrible. What a waste of time and money! The only good thing I can say about this recipe is that it was very colorful.

No one in my house liked this recipe.  I ate some of it, but of course at that point it was simply so I didn't waste the food.

Overall, this was good.  I was expecting more spice somehow - the flour/seasoning doesn't do much.  Even though I'm not a pineapple fan, it gave a huge boost to the flavor plus adds a nice sauce.  I also left out the brown sugar as suggested and it was fine.
