The sausage pancakes were good, but what really makes this recipe 5 star is the apple cider syrup.  I used Honeycrisp apple cider as the base and fresh squeezed lemon juice to cut the sweetness of the cider.  Definitely will stay in the "go to" recipe box!  Thanks Kathy for a great twist on a breakfast staple!

This recipe was great for me in two ways. I got to use up a half pound of pork sausage and the remaining dregs of a bottle of caramel apple cider. I used my own homemade pancake mix, used apple pie spice in the syrup and soured milk in the pancakes. I did let the batter sit for a bit before spooning it on the griddle. My kids and I thought this was a winner. I love how it combines two breakfast foods to make one. This one's a keeper.

These are delicious and we loved the Cider Syrup. I thought the batter was a bit thin, so I increased the pancake mix to 1 1/4 cups, which was perfect. I also finely minced an entire apple, peel and all, which was a great addition. Next time I will try replacing 1/4 cup of the pancake mix with stone ground cornmeal for more texture and fiber.

We use this syrup recipe ALL the time. I double or triple it and put some in the freezer for those times I can't get fresh apple cider. Yummy on any pancake!
I don't have pumpkin pie spice (and have always found they have too much cinnamon for us) so I use a combination of nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and ginger.

I thoroughly loved this recipe. My partner hated it because it "reminds me of egg foo young," which he detests. He wanted the apples cooked in the syrup served over pancakes with the sausage on the side. GO FIGURE? The syrup was especially great, even though I substitute 100% apple juice for the cider. Can't wait to get our cider pressed and try it again. I used Stayman Winesap apples that held their crunch and it was great. Thank you.

My family enjoyed these pancakes and will make them again.  I thought the cider syrup was too sweet though.

Using what we had on hand, substituted 1/2C of unsweetened applesauce for the apples, melted shortening for the oil, maple syrup, and fat-free half and half for the milk.  The batter was a little thick but the pancakes were great.  I would also like to try this recipe as written with the cider syrup.

These were soooo good!  My 16 yr old son just asked me to make them again today, but I'm out of sausage :0(  I'll be making a trip to the store to make them tomorrow though.  Thank you!

Boy these are a lot thicker than that picture!  I love thick pancakes though so no complaining here ;)  That syrup was SO GOOD!  The savory sausage goes so well with the sweetness of the syrup and tartness of the apple!  Thanks!

I really liked the pancakes, but I loved the syrup.  I'll make these again! I got six pancakes out of the original recipe.

I can't say enough good about this recipe.  My fiance is NOT a pancake person, so I was digging for recipes he might like, and he LOVED this one.  I made them again for my sister, who is also not a pancake person, and SHE loved 'em!  They are filling and flavorful, even without syrup, which I don't care for.  I wanted to make the Cider syrup, but couldn't find any cider.  That'll wait til fall.  WELL DONE!  Incidentally, I used the homemade pancake mix from elsewhere on the site, so that may make a difference for some of you.  Also, bulk sausage breaks up a little easier for this recipe than the rolled prepackaged stuff, which is cheaper.  :)  5 Stars for you, Kathy!

These pancakes are wonderful but the syrup is even better!  I doubled the recipe and my husband ate the leftovers for lunch.  He said they were just as good warmed up.

OMG, what a great surprise!  We loved these pancakes and I usually don't care for specialty pancakes.  The syrup really made them taste great.  I did use apple juice in the syrup because I had no cider but everything else was done as written.  Thanks for a great autumn pancake recipe!

My family enjoyed these.  They are a perfect dinner pancake.  I had to make them pretty small so they cooked all the way through, but they were very tasty.
