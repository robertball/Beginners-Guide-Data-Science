Nice and easy accompaniment to a meal.  Since I don't like too much chili powder, I cut the amount in half.  My husband thought it had a tad too much cilantro, but I love cilantro so it was fine for me.  (Fresh, not dried, cilantro is a must!) Definitely let this chill for at least 2 hrs. for the flavors to blend.

awesome, awesome, awesome. for those of you who like flavor!!! i read the other reviews and put less chili powder like people suggested... big mistake. i made it again & doubled the chili powder & it knocked my socks off! definitely let it marinate long though. i recommend at least 4 hours. good when it's hot outside!

You know what? I have to ammend my earlier comment - give this salad a day to marinate, and it is GREAT! I took my leftovers for lunch today, and I enjoyed it much more than last night. Make it a day ahead.

This was good, but it was lacking a little something.  Next time I will try a little more cilantro, onion, and a splash of vinegar.  I did add a little extra salt, and let it set over night.  I think both of those things helped.  I will try this again adding the above ideas.

I thought that this salad was very quick and easy to make.  That is a plus.  I thought that it tasted a lot better the second day.  It really should sit for at least 4-5 hours I would say.  My sister didn't really like it but, my teachers really liked the salad.  I had to make it for school.  I would give the salad a 3 or 4.

My husband and I liked this pretty well.  Reading the reviews I let is sit overnight.  then had it a day later and it soaked the flavors even more.  I added more chili powder and cilantro becase my husband adores both.

This was really uninteresting.  I tried adding oil and more seasoning and it didn't help.  I will not make this again, it just wasn't special.

This was AWESOME! I served it with grilled chicken and rice. I only had one cucumber in the house, so I added 1/2 of a firm tomato and some red onion.  I also added a little fresh mint and some black pepper.  Delicious!  My 4 year old son asked that I make it for dinner tomorrow night!

Great light dish!!!  I put sliced tomatoes and pieces of sliced fresh mozzarella cheese on a plate and then put this cucumber salad on top. It was awesome!! Next time I'll slice red onions for the top. Reminded me of an italian ensalata capresse (I hope I spelled that right).

I am not a spicy food fan at all and I lowered the amount of chili powder in this recipe.  While it was a good way to use the extra cucumbers I had, I'm sorry I didn't use the amount suggested.  There is no need cut the spice and in fact I'm going to try it again with more.

We made this salad 2 ways.  The first time we used dried Cilantro and it was "ok" but not great.  The difference is definitely fresh Cilantro.  We had it as a side with grilled Swordfish and the tangy lime flavor was perfect with it.  You definitely want to let this marinate for atleast 2 hours before serving it so the flavors have a chance to combine.  This salad will be a staple this summer in our house.

I followed the recipe to the letter but found it lacked taste.  I tweaked it and added hot peppers, and a drizzle of olive oil.......yummy now!  I will make this again

The people that I served it to liked it.  It has a different taste which is nice but I still feel something is missing.  I would make it again.

This was great.  To make it more kid friendly for my 4 year old (and my picky husband), I decreased the chili powder by about 3/4. It still left the flavor,but not the spiciness.  Also, my husband said next time to only use 3/4 of the cilantro, but I thought it was fine.  We served it with the grilled tuna recipe I also found here, with lime also, and it was perfect!

I made this for a tennis round robin during the 4th of July weekend and it was a hit for those that were health aware.  I had some squash that I needed to get rid of & added those too.  Muy delish & SO easy!  TY CHRISTYJ!

Rather dull.  Added a couple green onions some more chili powder and infused about 2TBS of olive oil with a couple cloves of minced garlic, let it cool down then mixed it in with the cukes and a little extra lime juice. Helped a little...

Really enjoyed this.  Got some cucumbers and cilantro at the produce stand very cheap, and this filled the bill!  I also chopped a couple of tomatoes in and added just a smidge of garlic powder.  So cool and refreshing, yet tasty!

This salad was fantastic!  I added some hothouse tomatoes, used a little less pepper than was called for, and the recipe was perfect!  Easy, quick, and tasty...I will definately be making this salad again and again and again.

Yuck!  This had no flavor.  Glad I had a ton of cukes and some cilantro that needed using so this was not a total waste.  Even my husband, who will eat anything, did not like it.

WOW! I love this salad! I just squeezed 1 1/2 half limes on it and cut up some cilantro. I did not measure those two things other wise I did it as the recipe called for. I did not even let is sit that long and it was amazing! Will make this again!!

This was pretty good but it was surprisingly bland. I think a dash of cayenne would add a lot of flavor.

Really like it, although I used a chili spice blend.  Easy.  I'd only use half the powder as well.  I suppose it depends on the size of your cucumbers.

My hubby and I both thought this was terrible. We both at two slices of cucumber and we rinsed what was left off and re-engineered with vinegar!

Love this! So simple it's not even funny. By itself - maybe not too impressive - but the possibilities are endless. My favorite way to serve it is with grilled boneless skinless chicken breasts and feta cheese. Yummy and healthy!

Yum!  Satisfied my craving for cold cucumbers!  I couldn't stop myself from adding more seasonings, tomatoes, onion, and olive oil.  I did refrain from adding feta crumbles and ripe olives, but that would make it more Greek.  I would have put the jalapenos in if I'd had them handy.   If anyone thinks this is bland, why don't they add a little more seasonings????

What a great...and different...side dish!  I went a little easy on the chili powder, as I was worried about it overpowering the flavor of the cucumbers.  It turns out that this is not a concern at all, especially due to the water being released from the cukes combined with the lime juice make a big puddle, that washes the cukes clean.  Next time I'll up the spice.

Easy, super fast to prepare...and perfect for summer BBQs or just for days when it is too hot to cook anything. I added some minced fresh ginger to mine for extra flavour and sweetness. Delicious thank you!

I love most cucumber salads and I could almost eat cilantro in a bowl by itself but I did not like this recipe.  Too bland. I tried to jazz it by adding a splash of white vinegar, but that didn't help.

Authentic thai or not, I liked it. I cut this in half and let it "soak" in the marinade while I did my exercize and errands this morning. Pretty good, I'd make it again. Low in calories and carbs, yes!

This was a refreshing salad to take to a potluck.  People who showed up who had limiting diets, but this was something they could enjoy.  It was different from what they were accustomed to.

This tastes okay, but it needed more flavor. I added red onion and some red pepper flakes. That really helped. I think it could have used some vinegar too.

I made my own chili powder which was very bland, after marinating foe about 30 minutes the whole dish was tasteless. I did add some rice wine vinegar, garlic and a little sugar.

The concept sounded great - we had both cilantro and cucumbers fresh from our garden.  It's an interesting combination, and the house smelled terrific, but overall, the taste just didn't seem to blend right for us.  We ended up tossing most of it out several days later.

This salad is incredibly delicious, and quick and easy to make. Make sure to let it chill for a few hours, preferably overnite. I made it for a quick meal, but now I can't wait to try it with a grilled steak, or any other meat.

I paid attention to the reviews that said this salad definitely needs marinating . . .hmm, not sure, but maybe we don't need it to marinate as long.  We marinated about 24 hours I guess.  I thought it was good, but the lime was almost overpowering.  Bf was a bit put off by the lime too--it was too much for him.  I'm thinking a little less marinating time and maybe some oil or water to tone down the lime.  Thanks for the recipe!

This didn't work for us. The chili powder completely overpowered every other flavor. I love a good cucumber salad, but I'd rather eat plain cucumbers than this. Thanks, anyway.

I love cucumber salad but did not like this.  The cilantro was entirely too strong a flavor and choked out the cucumber.  Thanks for sharing but will not make this again.
