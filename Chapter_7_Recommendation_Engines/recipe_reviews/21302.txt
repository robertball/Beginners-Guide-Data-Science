This was very good.  However I made a few changes: rather than tomato sauce and a fresh tomato I used canned diced tomatoes; I substituted the broth with 1/4 to 1/2 cup white wine and I used green beans instead of okra.

You know, I really think this is D-lish. I am not a big okra fan so I just left it out. The flavors are awesome and I added a few more raisins than what the recipe called for. For those other reviewers that didn't like the taste, you have to remember, this is MEDITERRANEAN stew, not AMERICAN stew. If you don't like ethnic foods- you won't like this but for those who can appreciate the flavors, it's awesome. I would definitely make this again.

I have, what I think is, an avg size crock pot. I ended up leaving out 1/3 of the squash, 1/2 the okra and some eggplant to fit it all in! Definitely different. A good way to cook eggplant. I served it w/gnocci (potato pasta). My husband liked it, I thought the seasonings were off - and I love all those in the receipe. We had left overs, so the next day made Couscous and made a veggi burrito w/the stew, cheese, couscous and Louisiana hot sauce - Now THAT was GOOD!!!! A good, very healthy receipe, but you'll probably need to make little changes for it to suit your taste.

I served this for my vegetarian guests for Thanksgiving.  It was a perfect companion for other fall dishes.  The color and aroma are great.  I'll only cook it for 8 hours next time and will add more garlic.

I actually followed the recipe exactly and really liked it.  I brought some in to work and three people asked me for the recipe.  I agree, though, that the cooking time should be reduced.  I wouldn't recommend omitting the squash, the cumin, or the tumeric, since that is what gives the recipe its unique sweet/spicy mediterranean taste.

Love the smell. I used an carrots, butternut squash & spag. squash and increased all the spices with a touch of salt. Also, served over brown rice with garbonzo beans. Next time I'll only do 4 hours on high. Thanks.

This was incredibly tasty and easy. Just a lot of chopping the night before, then coming home to a yummy smelling apartment. Sadly, this can only really be made in the Fall. I'll definitely make it at least one more time before the season is through. My boyfriend and I both thought this dish was wonderfully full of Fall veggie flavor with the raisins being a great touch. I cooked it for 9 hours, and I would probably try to cook it a little less (8 1/2) next time.

I only gave this recipe a 4 star rating because my hubby really liked it. I did not.  10 Hours in my slow cooker was way too long and 8 might have been more like it.  I'll only make this again if hubby requests it which is unlikely unless I mention it to him. ;-)

yummy!    first of all, 8 hours on low is WAY TOO LONG. i cooked mine on low for 3.5 hours & i think it's perfect. i made only a couple small changes to the recipe. first, i used an entire can of stewed tomatoes & 1/3 can of tomato sauce in place of the entire can of sauce & fresh tomato. and i definitely recommend using more tumeric, cinnamon and especially cumin.

This recipe didn't really work for me as it was.  I used all of the vegetables in the recipe, but exchanged the tomato/sauce for a can of petite diced tomatoes.  The consistency was fine (cooked on low 5-6 hours), but the seasoning was SO BLAND.  I came home from work to my roommates complaining about the boring crock-pot dinner I'd left them with. After about doubling all of the seasoning and adding some sugar, it was much better.  It's also been better as leftovers.  Would make again, but definitely need to adjust the seasoning.

With a few modifications, this recipe was DELICIOUS. The main three changes I made:   1. I used a lot more cumin, turmeric, and paprika (at least a couple of tablespoons of cumin, which MADE the recipe in my opinion).   2. Instead of making it in the crockpot, I simmered it on the stove for about an hour. Texture was perfect; vegetables weren't too mushy at all.  3. I browned some chicken breast and put it in halfway through cooking. Nice addition, especially for my non-vegetarian husband!  I changed up the vegetables because of what I had on hand (e.g., I added some organic delicata squash and some quartered red potatoes -- the red potatoes are a MUST for this recipe!). Overall, the flavors blended perfectly and my mouth is watering at the thought of eating leftovers for lunch today!

Ah man, I was looking forward to making this (only saw a few reviews initially - didn't know there were more).  While it had a nice flavor, something was definitely missing.  It needs some more excitement!  I would add toasted almonds and feta cheese and perhaps some coconut.  My husband hated it - thought it tasted like cardboard, but I don't want to waste it, so I'm going to try to add some stuff to it.  Chick peas, as someone mentioned would be nice.  I used green beans instead of okra (and of course added salt) and cooked over the stove top (1-2 hours).  Any other ideas, people? Something is definitely missing here, though it's extremely healthy!

I made this recipe to the T and found the stew to be too sweet for my taste.  I generally love squash and eggplant but the spices did not blend well with my palate.

Wonderful!  Forced to make alterations as per ingredients I had versus what the recipe had.  Eliminated: -Eggplant, okra, ripe tomato, turmeric  Replaced: - cubed zucchini for shredded, 8 oz of water mixed with tomato paste for tomato sauce, 1/2 cup beef broth instead of vegetable  Added: - 1 cup of black beans for additional protein  Cooked for 1 hour on high in the slow cooker then flipped it to low for an additional 5 hours. Was more mushy than I like it. Next time I will cook for less time or leave it on low the entire cooking time.

10 hours=mushy dinner! I should have known better. The flavor is really interesting--the raisins and cinnamon lend a slightly sweet quality to the meal.

We love this stew - you don't miss the meat at all!  8 hours was too long in the crock pot - maybe I just cut my veggies too small, so keep that in mind when you're cutting/cooking.  Next time I'm adding in a can of chick peas, and beans.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome dish.  Like others I made some changes... I used celery root instead of squash and asparagas in place of okra, which I believe kept my veggies from going mushy.  It was so great we never got to serve it over rice.  We all went back for 2nds and the pot was empty.

Thank you so much to the person who sent in this recipe.  My husband went back 3 times.  I followed it to a tee because I had to be gone from home all day so I did add a whole can of vegetable broth.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it was great.  Thank you soooooo much. It will be family regular.

Healthy meal.  I added salt and pepper, for sure. It's not pretty looking though.  It's easy, tasty, and leftovers disappeared.

I love this stew! I like making it ahead of time and bagging it in a disposable slow cooker liner then, freezing. The night before I can defrost in the fridge and pop it in the crock pot the next morning! Awesome served over rice.

DELICIOUS! Made a few changes...doubled all of the spices for some more "bite" and I thought the flavors tasted perfect - sweet and then a little bit of spice.  I also nixed the squash and added extra raisins.  Only cooked for 8 hours as suggested by others.  Perfection! Love it and will definitely make again and again.

I didn't have squash, zucchini, turemic, or raisins. But I did add green pepper, potato, broccoli. I only added 1/4 teaspoon of cumin but I didn't like the taste and it also tasted spicy from the red pepper flakes and bitter from the eggplant. I wouldn't make it again.

My mom and I had this for our "vegeatarian night". My dad is Greek and we are used to eating very exotic and flavorful foods. This deffinatly was extraodinary for us and the whole family loved it. The flavors were so unique with a bit of a spice. However, at the end I did pu tin a 1/2 cup olive oil because it was a bit wattery. Also, THIS DISH DOES **NOT*** NEED 10 WHOLE OURS!!!!!! It would turn to mush if tyou did that! It needs about 7 hours on low..(don't worry everything will be fully cooked). Other than that, this recipe was a deffinate 5 stars. Served over hot grainy brown rice!!

I used a roaster oven instead of a slow cooker. This way I was able to cook the onion and garlic a little while peeling and dicing the squash, that was the hardest part. I kind of eyeballed most of the ingredients rather than really measuring them out. For instance I diced up and threw in an entire eggplant, two small zucchini, and I added a can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomato. I have to recommend using golden raisins.  Than I dbl. all the spices and included salt. So I didn't follow this recipe exactly but it turned out grate. A bit sweet and just a little spicy hot. Good for Vegetarian kids.

I didn't have butternut squash so I used a whole eggplant and 2 zucchinis. I served it over couscous. It was very good and I will definately make this again.

I make this every other Monday -- I call it Mediterranean Stew Monday.  I increased the eggplant to one whole eggplant, and eliminated the zucchini and okra.  I also increased the carrots to three, substituted cherry tomatoes for the whole tomato, and add a can of garbanzo beans about an hour before it's done.  The combination of spices is perfect.

I made this and really enjoyed it!  I made a few changes as I went along as I felt they were appropriate:
-Omitted the okra (because I forgot to add it)
-Doubled all spices except cinnamon
-Doubled the tomato sauce and vegetable broth to give it a little more liquid.  Even with those additions, it was still very thick.
-Cooked on low for 4 hours because I was worried about over-cooking and the squashes breaking down.

I will certainly plan to make this again.

Yum(: Since I love soft cooked vegetables, I was very happy with the outcome of this dish, along with the spices paired with them. I do agree with other raters by cutting the cooking time, it all depends on your crock pot and how you like your vegies cooked. Oh and don't forget to add SALT!

I probably should have read all of the other reviews before I tried this recipe.  Unfortunately, this recipe is going to have to receive my first negative review.  I don't know if it was my slow cooker or what, but this just did not turn out good at all.  The vegetables were completely mushy (and I didn't even cook it 8 hours... it was more like 6) and the flavor was very bland and tasteless.  I'm sorry, but I won't be making this again.

This turned out well. I doubled all the spices and the raisins. I added a few mushrooms because I had them in the fridge, about 4 oz. of red wine for depth, some salt and a can of chick peas in the last hour. The dish was well received when served over basmati rice and garnished with toasted almond sliver. I would definitely make this again.

From the name "Mediterranean Stew," I was excited for a soup/stew bursting with great flavors. What I got was little more than an average, basic vegetable soup. I followed every step of the recipe, except I swapped out green beans instead of the okra. My husband and I were both disappointed with the results. It is definitely edible. And an awesomely low calory meal. Just completely lacking in ethnic tones. Maybe if I male it again, I'll increase the spices in volume and variety...

Great and easy recipe.  I used 1/2 teaspoon all of all the spices.  Also added chicken breasts.  Laid the chicken on top of the veggies to cook then shredded it before serving.

This is a delicious stew. I did double the spices as suggested. Instead of squash, I used sweet potatoes. Used green beans instead of okra as suggested. Used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Cooked on low for 4.5 hrs and wasn't done so let it cook while I was out. It cooked for 10 hrs or so on low and was delicious.

Wow! What a great use of the crock pot. I didn't think I'd like it, but I LOVE it. I only make one-dish meals in the slow cooker, and that limits you to soups and stews, pretty much. This is definitely a different flavor in stews! I admit, my 8-yr-old wouldn't eat it - she only picked out the squash and carrots. But she's going through a picky phase. My 2-yr-old gobbled it all down.

I left out the okra (didn't have) and swapped in a can of diced tomatoes for the tomato and sauce. I pretty much scaled back the recipe to about 3/4, to fit in my crock pot. Loved the spices, subtle but exotic. Served over basmati rice. This would have been fantastic with some good feta cheese, but I'm pregnant so that will have to wait a few more months.

I really didn't like this recipe - and it's not because i anticipated an "American Stew" as one of the reviewers suggested.  the flavor was bad and the vegetables got very soggy.  it was a waste of lots of good veggies :(

This is fantastic!  Probably one of the best vegan recipes I've had. I didn't do anything different to the recipe except I added about a half cup of chopped walnuts and added extra raisins.

I thought it definitely needed salt, and would have preferred more spices.  In general, it was good, but I probably wouldn't make it again.  It is really easy, though!

I thought it was okay, but my husband and kids didn't go for it at all.  I gave some to my neighbor -it makes a TON- and it was the same story with her family. It has a distinct flavor that isn't for everyone.

I doubled all the spices and used string beans instead of ocra. It's really flavorful and yummy. I plan to serve it with basmati rice and/or quinoa. Only cooked it for 6 hours on low and that was plenty long enough.

I made this dish just as the recipe said, and was so excited to try this new dish.  But the flavors were not to our liking.  No one in my family liked this dish, and I will NOT be making it again!  I wish we could give 0 stars instead of being made to give 1 or more.

I picked out the smallest butternut squash (4lbs) I could find at the store. After cubing 1/2 of the squash, it was enough to fill the crockpot half way and everything else just fit under the lid. The only thing I added to the recipe was a Jalapeno instead of the red pepper. It turned out great! We really liked it and will make this again. We served it with a loaf of French bread and a salad - YUM!

This was good. I added extra garlic(because we like). I didn't have  tomato sauce so I used 'spicy red pepper spaghetti sauce. I also had left over deer loin and added it as my guys won't eat much without meat. I needed to add extra liquid 1/2 way thru. I only cooked four hours and yes some of the vegies were mushy but that only thickened up the stew. I cut my vegies larger so they wouldn't be too overcooked and didn't thaw the okra.

I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked this about 7 hours.  The vegetables were too soft for our taste; other than the butternut squash, it was hard to discern what we were eating.  I also expected a bit more flavor from the spices used.  I'll not make this again.

I had such high hopes for this recipe. i followed it exactly - except I used a tin of tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Is this where I went wrong? 

I cut the veg into large diced pieces and cooked for 8 hours but it turned out very mushy and had a strange taste - quite sour. 

My husband is refusing to eat any more of this, even though I used up half our weekly veggies in it! I'm really not looking forward to taking it to work for lunch tomorrow. 

Sorry but I will not be making this again.

I loved this stew. It was full flavored and not at all bland or "strange". Even my daughter, who hates almost everything, enjoyed this stew. I will definitely make it again.

We just had this for dinner and it was yummy but only after I played a little. I would give the original recipe 4 stars. I did leave the raisins out just because I don't really like them. When I first tried it I liked it but was not in love. So I decided to put some goat cheese on top and bake it at 350 for a few min. just to get some color on the cheese and serve over brown rice. Definitly a keeper!

Not bad. Kind of bland at first - I had to add salt & extra seasoning.  But once I did that, it was good.  I also skipped the butternut squash (didn't have) and the okra (didn't want).  A very healthy meal though, so for that, I'll keep it around.

We didn't like this much.  Even with more spices, garlic, and a touch of butter, the okra and zucchini did not do well with the squash.  If I were to do this again, I'd put in potatoes and leave out the zucchini and raisins.  Also, it cooked on slow in about 6 hours.

So many other reviewers said it lacked flavor, so I tripled the amounts of spices, except for the crushed red pepper. It came out loaded with great flavor, although a tiny bit too hot for my palate.  I added bite-sized cubes of lamb at the start to make it a complete one-dish meal. I skipped the carrots and didn't miss them. Also because so many other reviewers said it didn't need to cook as long as indicated in the original recipe, I set my crock pot on high for just 4 hours and stopped it after 3.5 hours. It came out great and I'll make it again.

I left out the okra (we can't stand it) and used sweet potato instead of butternut followed the rest of the directions and left to cook on low for 7.5 hours.  We had small bowls for lunch the following day and threw the rest in the trash.  We found the taste bad enough but the consistency of the mush was worse.

This was really good. I had to make some minor changes. First off, I took what other reviewers said and only cooked it seven hours. I used peas, not okra. Didn't have cumin or turmeric or red pepper flakes so used dried basil and Cheyenne pepper instead. Followed all else but since I had to scale down the recipe quite a bit, the liquid seemed not enough so I used two cups of chicken stock and added some water as well. Turned out very soupy, but the taste was wonderful and I agree with the reviewer who said the grape tomatoes added pop as I used those as well. Will use again for sure.

very good stew...very different also.  Great flavors..who would ever think of putting raisins in a stew!
I used frozen green beans instead of the okra.  I also chose to simmer on the stove for a few hours instead of slow cooking it.
Delicious!

Very good Greek flavor. 10 hours is too long for this dish. I subtituted peas for okra, and cranberries for raisins--it was sweet--but very good over rice or cousous.

I enjoyed this one. I cheated a little bit because I did not have all of the ingredients. I left out the eggplant and the okra. I did use the butternut squash,onions,garlic,carrots,fire roasted diced tomatoes, and I added fresh cauliflower. The flavors of the spices were really good and different. I also added golden raisens and used fat free/low sodium chix broth. Loved the chick peas. This was a nice change of pace. Thanks!

I thought it was pretty good, but not my favorite.  I think I will try it again and just switch around what vegetables I use.  The only hard part is since all the vegetables got so mushy you couldn't tell what you were eating when ... it just kind of turned into a glob.  But at least it was a tasty glob.

I enjoyed this recipe after adding a dollop of plain yogurt.  Unfortunately, my family didn't like this stew at all.  My husband did concede that adding the yogurt made it "more palatable".  The flavors are somewhat unusual for those of us with very "american" tastes- which the family has.  It was definitely worth a try though.

Everything I hoped it would be! Like most, I changed it up a bit. Rutabaga instead of squash. Doubled spices. A little salt. Stuck the whole eggplant in there. 28oz can of diced tomatoes and a tomato (had one laying around). 5 cloves of garlic. Did it in my Ninja Foodi on high for 7 hours. Came out perfect! Probably did not need the salt in retrospect (trying to be low salt these days).

I absolutely love this stew. I did make a few changes. I made in on a stove top. I sauted the onions, added cumin while the pan was hot and then all the vegies for a quick 2 min sautee before adding in the can of tomatoes.

I also separately boiled lentil and added strained lentils towards the end. I agree with all comments. Please double the spices. I substituted dried cranberries for dates. 

Finined the dish with fresh cilantro and lemon juice.

Made it to the recipe, but increased the spices to taste. It’s tasty! I also didn’t have any raisins, so those were skipped and I added cured black olives to the top. Served with quinoa, and also put on pita with cheese. YUM!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was extraordinarily weird. It was unpleasantly sweet, and the texture was mushy. It also smelled strange, like tomatoey pop tarts. I followed the recipe exactly (unlike other reviewers). We are not picky, and we eat pretty much everything, but we could not eat this. I know what this recipe WANTED to be with its Mediterranean spices and ingredients, but it just couldn't meet its goals.

I made this on the stove top as I was heeding others' experience that 8-10 hours is too much. I skipped the okra. I would definitely cube the butternut squash into smaller pieces. I also used a can of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce. I think I'd add another can of diced tomatoes. I didn't have raisins, but found the stew sweet anyway! Family loved it. Served with rice, but I'd use egg noodles. Cooked about 1-1/2 hours on stove top (the squash needed it).

Made this for the hubby, who LOVES veggies and loves cooking from all over the globe. This stew was not a hit at all...this stew was EEEW. His main complaint: no salt and no flavor, which I found quite odd because there are quite a few spices in this recipe and I followed the recipe exactly. So...not a hit for our family, but it looks like others love it!

next time I will definitely leave out the cinnamon.  I replaced the  red pepper flakes with  Mae Ploy International Sweet Chilli Sauce   - it turned out really good.

Strange taste! I'm not sure what spice caused it maybe it was the cinnamon. My slow cooker was set on low and after 6 hours it was boiling and kind of glunky. I would recommend checking tenderness after 4 hours.

This is a pretty good dish, but I agree with a few others: it needs some adjusting. It needs salt, so please add that, to your taste liking. I would triple or quadruple the amount of garlic cloves it calls for, and I increased the turmeric and cumin to my liking. I would also like to try more fresh tomatoes (maybe three instead of 1), fresh okra instead of frozen, and diced canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. It's great over brown rice, and our 3-year-old LOVES it!! I would make it again for sure (with my preferred adjustments)!!

This stew was especially good sprinkled with some feta cheese. I doubled the spices (cumin) and used more tomatoes than the recipe called for. It seems something else was missing. Overall, pretty good.

This was an interesting dish.  Reading the recipe I knew it would need some salt.  It was easy and depending on how your crock pot cooks, you might need to keep an eye on it so it doesn't get mushy.  I added some hot curry powder and served with a dollop of Greek yogurt and cilantro.

I changed some of the ingredients as I didn't have them  but stuck to the spice combo and this is a winner. Mt wife, who is the real cook here, loves it.  Perfect base to add all sorts of ingredients. I shall be doing this again.

I am definitely keeping this recipe close by for vegetarian company. The flavours were fantastic and even my two year old ate it. I missed out on the okra as it is nearly impossible to find where I live and I used sun dried tomatoes in place of the raisins as I'm not a fan of cooked raisins. Other than that I followed the recipe and was not disappointed.

I omitted the okra and pretty much doubled the spices.  I also added a handful of grape tomatoes instead of a chopped tomato.  I thought they made nice little flavor bombs.  This dish had such a nice aroma and it reheated very well.

Delicious.  I substituted peas for okra, sweet potatoes for eggplant.  I had to add a can of tomatoes as it was a little dry.  I did not put my zucchini and frozen peas in until the last 30-40 minutes.  My husband loved it.

Even my husband who likes very heardy meals liked this one.  He did eat considerably more than what is considered one serving, but with such a healthy low cal meal that is fine.
