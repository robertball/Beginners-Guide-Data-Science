This is very delicious and so quick and easy to put together.  Ham is very tasty and you avoid having to brown sausage instead.  Love skipping a step!  I added extra cheese and extra ham to ours.

Made this on Christmas Eve and baked in the morning.  The only thing I'd change is using less bread next time.  I used 3 large, firm steak rolls and it was too much.

This is a very good recipe!  I did double the egg as 12 slices was too much bread, but it turned out great!

This is a very tasty and easy recipe. Make it the night before and pop it in the oven the next morning. I made this for a brunch and everyone loved it, there were no extras! Even kids will love this one because there is no onion or "yucky" stuff.

This is quick and easy. I wanted a little spice so I added a can of rotel ,a little salsa. Perfect by the fire.
