There are so many awesome reviews of this recipe that you may never even bother to read mine but . . . we have this at EVERY single family gathering. We have to plan the rest of the food around this recipe because the entire extended family insists upon this particular recipe. Others have brought different versions but they just don't cut it with the "fam." You cannot go wrong if you try this recipe. Don't subsitute cream of chicken or celery soup for the cream of potato. It's a key ingredient and worth the trip to the market to get it if you don't have it on hand.

This is a wonderful casserole.  The first time I made this dish my boyfriend thought it was too rich.  He decided to give it one more try.  I made it this past weekend.  He loved it.  Instead of using the sharp cheddar, I used medium cheddar.  I also added 1/4c red bell peppers, 1/4c green bell peppers, and 1/4c onions, and 1/4c mushrooms.  Also after I serve this onto a plate, I grate some fresh parmesean cheese to give it a little kick.  The peppers added such a wonderful flavor to this dish.  This is going to be a favorite for a long time.  Enjoy.  Thank you Melissa!

I followed the recipe precisely, and this was yummy.  I did cover loosely with foil after about 20 minutes when it looked like the edges were browning too early, but next time I'm just going to let it go.  I didn't think a cup of ham would be enough or that this would actually serve 12, but it was just right.  I used diced hash browns instead of the shreds, and shredded parmesan from a bag instead of the shaker can.  Next time I might throw in some chopped jalapenos or green chiles for more zip -- bacon crumbles would be good too -- and the earlier reviewer's breakfast burrito idea for leftovers also sounds fabulous!  This was super-easy to make up the night before.  Thanks!

I made this for a church group and got rave reviews, and many recipe requests. I agreed with other reviewers that it was very salty, if you can use any low sodium ingredients do so. To the reviewer whose results were soupy, I wonder if you might have used ready to serve, rather than condensed soup. Thanks for sharing this recipe! 
This is an addition to my original review. I recently made this again, I omitted the Parmesan cheese, instead topping it with an additional handful of cheddar. This eliminated the salt problem! Wonderful stuff, try it you will be pleased!

For my son's First Holy Communion I had the whole family over for brunch after Church. Everyone raved about this recipe and I had to give the recipe to several people, I did make some changes that came out wonderful. I used 1 can of cheddar cheese soup and 1 can of potato soup, I also added bacon and used Oreda potatos O'brien, I can't tell you enough how easy and tasty this recipe is.

I have made Hashbrown Casserole for many years and I have never had a recipe this good!
I made it for twenty one employees for a meeting we had and it was a hit! I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe and this is going to me my main one I use from now on.

Oh this is good!!!  I added green onions and salt and pepper because I can't live without those things in my hashbrowns but even without those this is a great recipe.  I took it to my mother's group brunch and while we were cleaning up women were eating the last little bits with their fingers.  It was pretty funny.  This recipe is also very easy to throw together and I love it with the potato soup instead of cream of chicken which is a variation I have tried in the past.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Loved it! I had it for Christmas brunch along with Belgiun waffles and it was a hit. I did make some changes though. I used shredded hash browns,  2 cans of cream of celery soup - healthy request instead of cream of potato. I sauted green pepper and onion and added that. Instead of grated parmesan, I used shredded parmesan. The rest I kept the same. Everyone asked for the recipe!! It's a keeper!

Excellent! I made this for a department breakfast at work and it was a hit. The only thing I changed is I did add 16oz of ham and one chopped green pepper.  Also, one major thing I would recommend is when you buy the frozen hash browns - make sure to *thaw them out and DRAIN THEM* before putting them in the pan.  Squeeze all the excess liquid out. That made a huge difference.  I am going to cook this for breakfast on Thanksgiving morning. Great recipe!

I would highly suggest mixing the soup,sour cream, & cheese all together first before adding the hash browns, otherwise way too hard to get mixed well.  Also, I left the ham out, added chopped green onion, & used only about 1/2 cup parmesan cheese.  Served with fried chicken instead of mashed potatoes & gravy.  We loved it!!!

Good base recipe- but made quite a few additions.  I used potatoes O’ Brian, with the peppers and onions already in it. Instead of dicing the ham, I layered 4 thick cut, sliced, smoked pork chops on top. Added cheese and French fried onions on the top. This recipe needs seasoning for sure- pepper, paprika, a dash of cayenne, garlic power, and half of the cheese I used was pepper jack as well. This made it really flavorful and gave it more of a southwestern kick. Really, really good. **Update**- I have started making this with light sour cream, the "Healthy Request" version of soup, and 2% cheddar cheese and it turns out exactly the same.

I am just starting to learn to cook and tried this recipe for Christmas Brunch.  Of course there was much hooting and laughing prior to brunch by my friends who know me as "the world's worst cook".....you should have seen the look on their faces when I produced this fab casserole.........No more laughing at Joan Rickerby!  :-)  It was excellent and not a drop left over!

I made this last night after it was prepared the day before (change of dinner plans at last minute) It was great, and I plan on making it many times.  If you don't follow the recipe don't review with low stars, because you just reviewed your recipe not this one!

This Recipie was a hit at the monthly brunch at my school.  The teachers all asked for the recipie and it was so easy to make.  I followed the directions, but added 1/4 cup cooked onion cut up very small to the mixture.  After about 50 minutes of baking uncovered I sprinkled 1 cup of French Fried Onions on top for extra crunch.  It was so yummy!  This is a good recipe to experiment with, next time I may add some crumbled bacon or veggies.

ILOVE this casserole and we also have it at every family brunch. Often I prepare it the evening before and either slow cook it in a crock pot or store it in the fridge until the next morning. Once I didn't have sour cream but I had 'HellavaGood' chip dip so I added that. It was great. We have also experiment with the cheeses using Swiss, Jarlsbery, Sargento's Italian blend. This casserole is very flexible and lends itself to experimentation. For the ham, I usually use leftovers from a spiral ham - it's more flavourful. I don't like using those little football hams -yuck. If you don't have a 'good' cooked ham, try substituting large diced chunks of peameal bacon that have been lightly sauteed. Sauteed onions are also an excellent addition. Customize this recipe to your family's and friend's taste!

I may get kicked to the curb for saying this, but it was ok. I was a little surprised that there were no eggs in a breakfast casserole! It was good though, just not fantastic.

NO EGGS!  I am so happy to have found a delicious egg-free breakfast-type casserole.  An egg allergy really changes the way one cooks and bakes.

I made this for a church brunch, and it disappeared pretty quickly.  I got so many compliments on it, and I thought it was delicious, too.  When I make the dish, I omit the Parmesan and top with Cheddar or Colby Jack.  It's less pungent and I don't have a problem with saltiness.

This is a wonderful recipe!  It is great to make ahead and serve for breakfast on holidays or when you have company.  The only changes I made to this was to add more sour cream (if you follow the recipe it comes out too dry), season the hashbrowns, and use turkey sausage instead of plain ham.

Oh my God, this is AWESOME!  And SO easy to make!  I've made it for a couple parties and also for my family.  It is comfort food at it's finest.  One note though that I learned on my own-don't use honey ham.  The sweetness conflicts with the creamy cheesy flavor.

Awesome!! Even my husband who doesn't really like casseroles, ham or potatoes really liked it a lot!  I cut the recipe in half and used it as our main dish so I added a little bit of ham (used about 6 oz for a half recipe) and a handful more cheese.  I also added 1/4 cup chopped onions.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it rocked!! I used Ore-Ida hashbrowns and carfefully broke them up while frozen which really helped the mixing process. So good, I could eat it everday if my waistline would allow, haha!  I will definitely use it many times again! I can't wait for a family gathering so I can try it out on them :)

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  I put it together and put it in the refrigerator overnight.  I baked it the next morning, and it was all eaten.  My family even asked that I double the recipe next time. Thanks so much!

This is wonderful.  I've been making similar casseroles for 40 years but never used potato soup, always mushroom or chicken.  I also had never used parmesan to top this dish until now.  I restrained myself & did not change one thing!!!  My Bridge Club loved it!!!

Turned out delicious!  I used OBrien hash browns (that had onions and green peppers) - left out the ham because I didn't have any.  Oh yeah, and I added a packet of "Onion Soup Mix" ... the secret ingredient!  Also in the last 10 minutes of baking, I added a few crunched up french fried onions to top it off.  Took this dish to a family event... they scraped it clean.

Made this for our Easter church social.  I doubled the recipe and added a sauteed chopped onion.  There was a lot of the other dishes left over but not a bite of the Casserole.  I heard one lady say that it was the best thing on the table. ( I didn't get any) I'm rating it on performance  :^).

I meant to rate this a long time ago. Fantastic as written, but I do add 1/8 tsp of onion powder and 1/8 tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp of pepper. I don't use the shaker parmesan, but I buy the Kraft shredded parmesan over with the other shredded cheeses and it makes all the difference in the world. Amazing flavor. Don't use any other soup besides the potato...it is the exact right soup for this casserole.

I prepared this recipe for today's brunch with the women of my bible study group and not a drop was returned home!  I made a few changes to spice it up a bit, etc.  Used 8 oz versus 16 oz of sour cream.  Used 1 can crm/potato + 1 can crm/celery.  I omitted the ham.  I added 1/2 c diced onions + a 4oz can mild green chilies.  I also seasoned with white pepper, garlic powder, and topped it off with hot sauce.  I substituted pepper jack cheese for the parmesan cheese - and only baked the cheese topping for the last 30 minutes.  Will definitely make this again and everyone asked for the recipe.

I needed something quick and easy for a breakfast we throw for the Graduates in our Student Ministry at my church.  I made a double-batch of this and it was DEMOLISHED!  Everyone raved about it.  So simple and super good!  This will be a staple for our annual breakfast.  
Also - I accidentally bough 2 kinds of hashbrowns, shredded and cubed.  I think the cubed came out MUCH nicer than the shredded as far as consistency goes -- both tasted great.  
YUM!  Thanks so much!

Pretty good, rave reviews from the husband. Because there were no eggs in the recipe, I make it feel more breafasty. After 45 minutes in the oven, I removed the casserole and created nine craters with the back of a spoon and cracked eggs into the craters. Then I put it back in the oven for the rest of the time. The result is soft, runny eggs, so you might have to leave it in the oven a little longer if you try this to make sure the eggs are cooked enough.

All I can say is "Yum Yum Yum"!! I made this with a little more ham than the recipe called for and served it along with scrambled eggs and toast. Both my husband and I thought it was fantastic! I didn't add the parmesan cheese on top, but instead I added some more shredded cheddar to top it off -- Delicious! The only thing I didn't really care for was the cubes of potato in the cream of potato soup I used (Campbell's) -- I thought it kinda took away from the shredded hash brown potatoes -- so next time I think I'll use a different soup, possibly cream of mushroom or cream of celery. Also, I added about 1/2 cup chopped onion as an earlier reviewer suggested, but in all honesty I think it would have been better without the onions -- next time I'll leave them out and try it that way. This recipe is a definite keeper and truly rivals my favorite hash brown casserole -- Cracker Barrel's!! Thanks Melissa! :)

Delicious and comforting :) I used cream of onion soup, amazing! Reminds me of Cracker Barrel's hash brown casserole. Update: Served this at Sunday brunch, minus the ham, and it was a hit! The only subbing I did was to use one can of cream of potato soup, and for the other can, a half recipe of Cream Soup Base (from this site) with added sauteed onion. Everyone loved it and how could you go wrong with this much cheese and sour cream with potatoes?! I mixed this up the night before and baked in the morning with no issues. So easy and so delicious.

I have made this many times. It's an absolute favorite of mine. It's one of those feel good dishes. Simply stated, DELICIOUS! And I make it as-is. I'm sure you can change it up, but I don't. I absolutely hate when people give a dish 5 stars and than say how much they changed it. Great AS-IS! =)

YUM!  I added a can of chopped green chili peppers, an onion, and some mushrooms.  Casseroles this good usually involve several steps- this one was really quick- just dump everything in a bowl and bake.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Melissa!

After the amount of reviews on here I'm probably not going to say anything new but - SERIOUSLY, YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN BEFORE SWITCHING IT UP!!!  The Cream of Potato Soup really makes a big difference, members of my family have been making this for years but always with different kinds of soup (mushroom or chicken)and I liked it then and certainly wouldn't turn it down BUT the potatoe soup makes the difference, I don't know why and I don't care, from now on when I'm at family gatherings all I will think of is the fact that I've had better.  The next time I made it I added more ham, left out the parm and sprinkled bread crumbs on top and it was also amazing.  You can certainly do whatever you please for this recipe to meet your taste but DO NOT substitute out the soup!!
I really can't stress this enough... Don't do it!

Mmm comfort food ... this hit the cheese-y spot. I made as directed, only thing I did different was add 1/2C. chopped onion and 1/2C. chopped red pepper, sauteed them and then mixed into the bowl with everything else.... I would stick to the potato soup, it comes out so creamy and the taste is like scalloped potatoes... I wouldn't change a thing. great alternative for a breakfast, would be great with some bacon and toast on the side.... keeper.

I made this for New Year's Day breakfast for our family and our overnight guests; putting it together the night before then baking it in the morning worked perfectly.  Had finicky teens not been in attendance I would have spiced it up with green pepper, mushroom, and onion and will surely make it again for my husband and myself with those additions.  Parmesan cheese is quite salty so I opted to use much less than the recipe calls for and topped the casserole with a mixture of parmesan and more cheddar.  Served with poached eggs this was an easy and tasty breakfast.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  I have 3 teenagers and they love this recipe.  It freezes very well, which is good because it makes a lot.  My co workers love it as well.  I don't change a single thing, except adding some onion because my whole family loves them.

I've made this recipe so many times, and it's *always* a crowd pleaser! My first foray was (boldly) to a work event, and it was one of the first dishes to go empty! i don't know how many people I've had ask me for the recipe over the years, and it's so easy!  I've mixed it up minimally, depending on mood and memory (I'm an improv artist at heart) but it's always the same concept.  Sometimes I go for cubed potatoes for a chunkier outcome; a little cayenne to heat it up; bread crumbs & pepper for a crispy top. And occasionally I eat too many cubes of ham before they make it into the dish (whoopsie!) but it always turns out *wonderfully!*      I hope your family enjoys it as well :)

Tastes like something Grandma would make!!  Very easy to prepare as well.  Just mix everything in a big bowl, put it in the pan and you're done.  Followed the recipe to a "T" except I used two 8 oz packs of diced ham and added chopped onion.  If you choose to add onion, bell pepper or garlic, I'd advise you to saute 'em first before mixing them with the other ingredients to avoid them being slightly crunchy in the finished product.

Delicious as is.   I did take the advice not to substitute the potato soup (had to run to the store) and didn't need 12 servings so I halved the recipe.  I wanted a more complete breakfast dish so I shorted the sour cream by about a 1/2 cup and added 3 beaten eggs to the mixture.  Turned out really well with good texture.  May try adding some sauteed onion or jalapeno.  I think you could probably use sausage or ground beef for a lunch or dinner dish.  Very filling. Good job.  I will be making this again.

Update: Used mushroom soup, eggs and Greek yogurt/sour cream and browned the potatoes with onion and orange bell pepper before mixing together.  Great versatility in this recipe.  Lends itself well to whatever meat, seasoning and soup combination you wish to use.  Just be sure to maintain the liquid ratios.  Adding eggs will make the casserole light and fluffy.  Just beat them slightly before mixing with sour cream and soup. Husband thought this was really good and, as usual, topped his with Mexican hot sauce.

This casserole was delicious.  Added a few items: After I mixed the ingredients and poured it into the dish, I covered it with a can of Durkees French Fried Onions, then lightly sprinkled it with the Parmesan cheese, then covered that with a bottle of Hormels Real Bacon Pieces.  This was very good.  I served it as a dinner.  Next time, I will replace the ham with sausage and server it for breakfast.  Definately a keeper!!

This is a good starter recipe, and it is on the right track, but it needs some adjustments.  It was WAY too salty.  I attributed the salt to the massive amount of grated Parmesan cheese. Honestly, I think it would be much better left out since the bold flavor of the cheddar cheese was already there. The overall consistency was too potato/ cheese based; it would have been so much better with some chopped onions and peppers, a hint of ground pepper, and maybe even double the amount of ham.  I'll make this again, but next time, it will be with some modifications.

Excellent!  I made this for an evening meal having a friend over & we all loved it.  The changes I made were: I used frozen O'Brien potatoes, 2 cream of mushroom soup(s), 1 green pepper cubed, 1/2 cup dried onion, 1 cup Parmesean cheese & 12 ounces cubed Velvetta instead of Cheddar.  Of course I still used the 8 ounces of ham & 16 ounce container of lite sour cream.

Every single person who ate this, raved about it.  Took the advise of another commenter, and added salt and pepper and about 4 chopped up green onions.  I thought it was very, very good...not magical, but very good.  Everyone else seemed to think it was magically delicious.  Will make this for brunches from now on.  Great share.  Thanks

Potatoes were not done enough in 1 hour, took out of oven to have with other dishes. Think it was because the hash browns need to be defrosted first.

I just made this for my office Thanksgiving potluck ... and it was the topic of conversation!
I made several adaptations.  My recipe included 2 pkgs of hashbrowns from the refrigerator section, 1 can cheese soup, 1 can cream of inion soup, 1 fresh diced onion as well as the listed amount of sour cream, parmesan and cheddar (but I used four cups of cheddar).  Everyone loved it!

Excellent!  Made this for two of my kids' classroom Christmas parties...wow.  I couldn't find the amount of shredded parm. needed, so I just sprinkled the "Casserole" shredded cheese mixture on the top of the finished product.  Made them ahead of time and popped them in the oven an hour before I had to deliver them to school.  Will definitely make this again!

I made a few changes: I added one cooked, chopped onion, left out the ham, and thawed the hash browns before hand and only had to bake it for about 30 minutes. It was delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly as written, made no changes. It had a strong sour cream taste. Will not make this again.

To make this yummy dish even more delish, take 1 small box corn flakes(crushed), 1 stick melted butter, add parm. cheese and spread on top of casserole and then bake.  Watch topping so it doesn't get too brown.

I used low salt ham, O'Brien potatoes, pepper, 1 can cream of potato and 1 can of cheese soup; lowfat sour cream and lowfat sharp cheddar; only enough Parmesan to lightly coat the surface.  Sprinkled lightly with real bacon bits, and 10 min. before it was done baking, I added a can of french fried onions on top.  The bag of O'Brien potatoes was only 28 oz. so it was a little soupy when hot, but perfect consistency after it cooled a little. The onion rings really added flavor and it wasn't too salty.

I substituted 1 can of Cheddar Cheese soup for 1 can of Cream of Potato; I shredded my ham in the food processor rather than dicing it; and I used colby jack in the casserole and monterey cheddar on top.  The casserole came out well, and is good - however, I found it a little lacking in flavor.  (My 14 year old son thought it was "plain".) I will make again, but I think next time I'll add some onion powder and possibly garlic powder to the mix.

After reading many of the reviews, I made some changes, which made this was just okay/edible.  It would have been better without the changes.  I used 1 low-fat cream of mushroom, and 1 low-sodium cream of celery instead of cream of potato.  I added more cheese (1 cup more) and used about 8 oz. low-fat sour cream and about 4 oz. non-fat plain yogurt.  Also, I didn't use the parmesan.  I really did not care for it this way, so make your changes wisely!  If I had it to do over, I would use full-fat everything with extra cheese and 1 cream of mushroom & 1 cream of potato, plus pepper.  I'm sure it would be better this way.

I don't know why I never thought to do this before.  My daughter loves this type of baked hash brown casserole, so not surprisingly this was a big hit last night for supper.  I will have to try it with other meats as well.  I didn't change anything other than to halve the recipe.  It turned out great.

This was sooo tasty and went fast!  Rivals Cracker Barrel's hashbrown casserole, which is my favorite!  I made this for dinner and we had the leftovers for breakfast the following morning.  I made absolutely no substitutions or changes, and I won't...  perfect just as it is!  Thanks!

This is delicious!  I found it to be very salty though.  
After reading previous reviews about bland and/or soupy, I combined several previous suggestions:   I used half cheese soup, half potato, I  sauteed some green onions and added a little bacon and black pepper - it was full of flavor!  

This is also a great recipe for throwing in the microwave for part of the cooking time if you're running late like me.

I made a half recipe, left out the ham to make it vegetarian, used cream of mushroom soup, and added some chopped onion and black pepper. I baked the half recipe in a 8 by 8 pan for 45 minutes, instead of topping it with parmesan cheese I topped it off with cheddar cheese. I served this for breakfast with vegetarian bacon strips on the side. Next time i'm going to let the casserole cool for about 10 minutes before eating it, because it's much to hot and runny straight out of the oven. Also, I think something on top to add some crunch would be a nice addition to this. Thanks for the great recipe!

Just made this recipe for 2 hungry older teenage boys.  Too rich, too salty, no flavor. Basic question, why add cream of potato soup when the recipe already has hash potato (cream of mushroom would add new flavor). There was no request for more, their plates hardly touched with the first serving. 3 Tips: Read reviews by rating and start with no stars first, never test a new recipe on company no matter how good the reviews say it is, Best of Bridge Schwarties Hash Browns is a way better recipe that disappears fast. Very Disappointing, will never make again and can not recommend this to anyone. This is my first and last review on the net, I felt I had to share this feedback.

This recipe is EXTREMELY salt. Other than that the only other flavor you're going to get is the cheese.

This is soooo good - the hubby said he was sad to get to the end of his piece. The cream of potato and sour cream combine to give this a rich creamy background for the shredded hashed browns.  I think this recipe could use more ham, I'll add more to taste next time.  Grated Crackerbarrel cheddar by hand - totally worth the good quality cheese (though it makes it really greasy so might stick with regular shredded cheese next time)!  Didn't need all the parmesan though threw on a good bit. Freezes well, reheats well in the microwave, and tastes great - that's the triple crown right there!

I left out the ham and made this for a side dish at a church dinner, and while the group loved it and some requested the recipe, I found it to be a little dry. If I make it again, I might add some milk.

This is a very very very good recipe.  I only use shredded hashbrowns for this.  I also use one can of cheddar soup and one can of cream of potato soup for even more cheesy taste.  I also sautee up some green onions to add too.  I think one could add in a variety of things depending on individual taste.  Re-heats well in the microwave.  My husband doesn't care for leftovers, but ate this for 3 days in a row!

I altered the recipe as suggested and used o'brien potatoes instead.  I also used cream of mushroom soup and maple sausage instead of ham. I did not use the parmesan cheese.  I made this for Christmas morning breakfast and everyone ate seconds and complimented immensely.  Thanks!

OMG this was soo awsome!  I thought that it would make too much for 2 people so I halfed the recipe, I'm sorry I did that.  There were only 2 servings left after we'd had ours, lol.  The only comment I got from my husband was he wasn't sure that he liked the parmesan cheese on top.  I thought it was good but next time will try shredded cheese on top 5 minutes before its done and see how that turns out.

I cut this recipe in half for the two of us and it was very tasty.  I still used the 8 oz. of ham and I also used the potatoes O'Brien that has the green and red peppers and onions.  I cut the parmesan down to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup (for a halved recipe) and it was plenty enough parmesan.  The half recipe still made too much for 2 people so we ate it again!

This dish is absolutely fabulous!  Everyone at my brunch raved and wanted the recipe--even the guys..Will 
definitely make this one again.  I omitted the ham and added sauteed red and green peppers and scallions.  Next
time I will try it with the ham.

I thought this was a great basic recipe for hash brown casserole, although a little on the bland side for me (which is probably good if you are cooking for different ages).  Add your own favorite flavors (I like granulated garlic and smoked paprika) to kick up the flavor. I've added in cooked broccoli, asparagus and scrambled eggs, and they've all worked out well.

I made this for dinner tonight with some slow cooker ribs. The only change I made was to use light sour cream, in an attempt to cut the calories.  The recipe makes a lot...I was initially made fun of for the huge quantity but at this point the leftovers in the fridge have already been divided and claimed.  If you have some teenagers in your life that you want to win over, this is the dish.  Basic, yummy comfort food.  Good with for breakfast, good for dinner, good as a bedtime snack according to this household.

I give it a 4 as written, but a 5 with some modifications. It is too dry and salty as is for me so I add about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of milk and omit the parmesan. I sprinkle some more shredded cheddar on top, bake about 50 minutes, then put some french fried onions on top and bake the last 10 minutes. Delicious!

I looked up this recipe because I had leftover ham and boiled potatoes, so I diced the cooked potatoes and substituted them for the packaged hash brown. It was still one of the best casseroles ever! Thanks for the recipe.

Very good, we've made this a couple of times, each with some variations, but still good. A solid recipe that you can play with to fit your tastes

Super easy & quick recipe.  I added 16oz of ham, garlic & onion powder, black pepper, and chopped onions to the mix.  I also only had 1 can cream of potato so I used that plus 1 can of cream of mushroom.  SInce so many were saying it was too salty, I used a thin layer of shredded cheddar on top plus a little sprinkle of real parmesan on top (about 4 T) instead of all parmesan.  I covered mine with aluminium and rempoved it for the last 20 mins to get  brown on top.  This is truly a great dish.

Excellent. I halved the recipe, used lite sour cream and cheese, and reduced the parm a bit. Half the recipe fits a 8x8 baking dish perfectly. BTW, Ore-Ida frozen hash brown come in 28 oz bags now, not 32. Will definitely make again . . . next time maybe adding some lightly sautéed onion and green pepper.

This was excellent! My husband couldn't quit eating it and was disappointed when it was gone. Only change I made was to use more cheese...actually double. I also bought the Ore Ida Hash Browns that had onions and peppers in them. Gave it a great zing and just a little extra flavor. This will be a favorite for a long time I do believe! Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good. I used diced potato hashbrowns because it didn't specify, but went by the picture. To lighten it I used all low fat dairy products, cut the parmesan and cheddar cheese back, and even subbed some with cottage cheese. It was still creamy from the potato soup alone anyway. I am sure the regular version though is super cheesy and delicious.

Have made this for years, if you want to cut down on fat and calories this casserole is just as good with light sour cream and 98% fat free cream soup.  YUMMMMY and the leftovers are delicious (that is if you have any left).  Enjoy!

I use pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar and add a small onion finely chopped.  I top with rice crispies for a wonderful crunchy topping.  Great recipe!

This is absolutely delicious. The only thing I do different is add seasoning salt, pepper and garlic. And then on top of the parm cheese I sprinkle paprika. I always get asked for this recipe whenever I bring it somewhere.

Excellent recipe! My family loved it...very creamy and rich. Perhaps next time I will add a crunchy topping though it was great just the way it was! This dish was also very easy to make and totally satisfying...a definate make again.

This was a delicious recipe but I'm not sure that it was worth the trip to the store for the cream of potatoe soup. I think it would have been delicious with cream of chicken and cream of celery soup. I took this to a sunday school brunch and everyone loved it.

I recently made this recipe on Thanksgiving; my boyfriend and I were attending his family's big dinner as well as my own family's, and wanted a recipe that could feed and please a lot of different people.  Although his family can be a bit persnickety, they LOVED this dish!  Everyone had brought along their own contribution, but this was the only dish that was completely eaten by the end of the evening.  My family loved the recipe as well... although we were all stuffed, there were no leftovers!  We followed the recipe loosely, using a bit more ham and cheese than the recipe called for, but it worked wonderfully.  I recently made the recipe again, per my family's request, and followed the recipe more exactly and it was still fantastic.  This is so simple and so delicious!  It's a new family favorite.... I've gotten lots of requests for the recipe, and even more requests to bring this along to potlucks and holiday dinners!

I think this might become a new favorite after a little tweaking! We unfortunately had to skip the ham (didn't have any on hand), but I did substitute some crumbled bacon in my half (my husband doesn't like bacon--can you imagine?).  We also added in about 3/4 cup freshly chopped Vidalia onion and 1/2 cup freshly chopped yellow bell pepper (b/c it was available). We sauteed the onion, pepper, and a bag of frozen Ore-Ida diced ("southern style") hash browns in a large pan for a few minutes (just until some of the potatoes began to brown) before mixing them in a large bowl with the rest of the ingredients.  After spooning the mixture into the baking dish, I used a fork to mix the bacon to my half. Then we sprinkled the Parmesan and a little extra cheddar on top.  Everything came out fine, but we both thought it needed more salt; we'll probably add extra Parmesan and season the potatoes in the saute pan next time. This kept well in the fridge for several days, and personally, I felt it got better each time I ate it! It was very easy to heat up in the microwave but took forever in the big oven.  I think next time we'll try substituting one can of cheese soup for one of the cans of cream of potato soup (as several have recommended). I also look forward to making this in the future with the cubed ham, and maybe I'll play with some other types of peppers and cheeses as well! Someone mentioned cooking this in a slow cooker, which I think would work well with this recipe!

I've made this dish several times and have gotten RAVE reviews! Instead of ham, I used crisp crumbled bacon (personal preference).  I also used 1 can cream of potato soup and 1 can of cheddar cheese soup. YUMMM!! :~)

Cooked this for a teachers' brunch and was asked for the recipe by almost everyone.   I found diced ham at Walmart.   I've cooked this at least 25 times.  It freezes well (both before & after cooking.) We have a beach house so we have plenty of overnight guests.   I try to keep a few small tins of it (6 serving size) in our freezer to serve with eggs for breakfast.   Yummy dish.   Tastes even better the 2nd day :)

I like this dish.  I added in a whole chopped bell pepper.  Mine came out a little runny, I didn't have the problem of it being dry.  I think it might be better if you layered the ingredients rather than mixed them all together

I made this for Christmas morning.  It was fabulous.  Everyone really liked it.  The only change I made was substituting fat-free sour cream for the regular.  I intend to make this a regular part of our holiday tradition.

I usually don't find things salty that other people do, but to me this was very, very salty.  I'll probably try to make this again using low sodium soup.  It was easy and fast to make and I thought it was really good except for how salty it was.  I added a small diced onion but otherwise left the recipe as written.

This recipe is great. I made it for some out of town guests and they loved it. The recipe made a lot so I made breakfast burritos with the left overs. I just added some salsa and avocados and threw it all in a tortilla. It was sooooo good.

I've made this several times since I first tried it in 2004. I use just one can of potato soup and the frozen o'brien hashbrowns with the peppers mixed in. I find that the peppers give it a much better taste. Thawing out the hashbrowns in the microwave also cuts down cooking time.

I served this for brunch and everyone went back for seconds. I didn't use as much Parmesan as the recipe called for. Only sprinkling on 1-cup was enough. Would recommend for a large grouping.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I wouldn't serve it for breakfast but certainly will any other time. This one is a keeper for my recipe collection. Great job Melissa.

Well my 13 almost 14 year old sister said it was better than a similar dish that my mom makes that is one of our family favorites, so I have to give it 5 starts.  No, this isn't healthy but it's nice for something special (I made for Easter brunch).

I did make some minor changes...
- I mixed in the parmesan cheese (because I didn't read the directions close enough. In its place I put a bit of cheddar cheese on top.
- Instead of ham, I used 1 lb of ground pork (that I crumbled / fried first).  Really you can use a variety of meat here.  I think a spicy sausage would be excellent.
- Baked for the first 40 min covered w/ foil so the top wouldn't get to brown.

Wonderful recipe! Made it for lunch and added a few items, as other suggested. A few slices of chopped green and red peppers, diced onion, garlic, pepper, and I substituted the soup for condensed mushroom soup. I also broiled for the last minute or two to make the cheese crispy and brown. Incredible!!

Absolute YUM!! Comfort food at it's best. The only thing I did differently was to make my own hash browns (I chose this recipe in part to use some potatoes I wasn't using quickly enough!) My husband URGED me to be sure and add it to my recipe box and rate it highly.

I've had this recipe twice now. First time was for guests during breakfast and we loved it. Second time was Thanksgiving and everyone made statements to the effect of wow this is good. Best yet it's really easy to make.

I have made this many times! It is my 15 yr olds favorite dish!  I do not add the parm because my family does not like it. The key to this recipe is the cream of potato soup, do NOT substitute it or you will change the entire flavor of the dish! Good with crumbled bacon on the top as well! Definately not healthy and has a rich flavor, but noone should be surprised by that based on the ingredients list alone! Try it.....it is delicious!!!

By virtue of the high ratings and liking the ingredients listed I gave it a try.  Can't say it was all that wonderful. Perhaps I just prefer my hashbrowns crisp and this recipe of course doesn't facilitate that kind of dish. The amount of sour cream seemed high and taste stood out.
I would only try again with modification of cutting back on the sour cream a little bit and turning the mix towards the end to actually brown some of the potatoes.  It's a preference thing.  If you don't like your hashbrowns not brown then I would avoid this one unless you were going to turn the mixture at the end of cooking. Perhaps frequent turning under the broil setting.  It might be super for those who love sour cream and enjoy eating their hashbrowns without being crisp (the coating of cheese you put on the top hinders the ability to actually brown the potato part.   Perhaps I just like mine more done.  Another alternative one might try if they like a more cooked taste is set the temp to 400 and cook for 1:15.   It's probably not a bad one if you play with it a bit.  But as the directions are understand you will likely get what I just described. If you like it that way, great.  Obviously many people here did.   Don't expect this to have crisp potatoes and do expect a heavy sense of sour cream.  I mean 1lb of sour cream is hitting it a tad heavy in my opinion.  Good luck!

I tried the recipe as is first it was OK but bland. I made it again using O'Brien hashbrowns with onion and bell pepper, added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and black pepper then used cream of mushroom soup. I saved a half cup of cheese and sprinkled it on top with the Parmesan cheese. I liked this version better.

I had a bit of a difficult time with this recipe. I pretty much know what I am doing in the kitchen but when I mixed the recipe up as written it just looked like it would be too dry soooo.... I added another tin of soup and more Greek yougert.. ummm no..... it would not set. I improvised by adding corn starch and returning to the oven  I left it there until it did set.My improvisation saved the dish and corrected my own error. So iI would say if it looks a bit dry going into the oven its meant too. It will be fine as written I think. It was good but I can't say it was the best thing in the world as some reviews suggest. I would make this again as we tend to have plenty of leftover ham I never know what to do with and this really is very tasty and easy to toss together. Thanks for the recipe. My bad.

I make this almost the same way except I am gluten intolerant so instead of using cream of soup (& sour cream), I make a white sauce (in a saucepan melt butter, add GF all purpose flour and slowly add milk add a bit of dry mustard and S&P to taste.  If I don't have any left over ham on hand I will brown ground turkey or ground beef and add that to it instead.  this is a huge hit with our family and with the toddlers & preschool kids at the daycare that I cook for as well. I've also used mozzarella cheese when I was short on cheddar or marble - its an all around great recipe - easy to substitute your fave ingredients with

Yum!  I made this exactly as shown except that I substituted 1 cup of dry creamy potato soup mix (Bear Creek), with 1 cup water and 1 cup 2% milk, for the condensed, canned soup.  It was even better left-over than it was fresh, and I froze several servings, which were fine reheated in the microwave.

Excellent.  I cut recipe in half to serve 3, left amount of ham the same, added black pepper, and fresh parmesan on top.  I let hashbrowns thaw for about an hour before mixing.  Baked in a 9 X 9 glass pan and was done in 45 minutes.  My husband really liked this and he can be hard to please.  I will definately make again.

Thank you sooo much for sharing this recipe! I had seen this recipe here, wrote it down, tried it, and forgot to save it. So I hadn't been back to review it, but I had to make the effort.

This is THE best cheesy potato casserole ever! I use this recipe at least once a month, if not more. I especially like to make it when I'm trying to impress someone :D I make it with or without ham, with shredded hashbrowns or with southern (cube) hashbrowns, and with Cheddar or velveeta cheese. Whichever way I make it, it comes out delicious! The only change I made is I sprinkle cheddar cheese or crushed corn flakes on top in place of the parmesan cheese. And I've actually never made it for breakfast.

All around, fantastic recipe that I will use regularly for years to come!

This was really easy to make! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because my husband and I thought it was a little bland. However, all 4 of my kids asked for seconds! That never happens! I will make again since my kids loved it. Thanks!

Entire family gave this two thumbs down, and we're not particularly picky eaters. Sour cream taste is too strong and flavours don't meld together -- tastes exactly like each of the components. Disappointing, that's for sure, with all the rave reviews. Diff'rent strokes, I guess.

I thought it was really salty, way too rich, and kind of bland.  I made it for a weekend with all the brothers and sisters in laws and no one said it was good.  No one asked for the recipe.  I even made it a 2nd time thinking I did something wrong.  Nope.  Still the same.  Never making this again.

Yup, not sure what I did wrong compared to everyone else, but I found this recipe way to gooey, too much soup and sour cream, very blaa taste.

I made this casserole to share with my mom's group at church, and it was delicious!  By mistake, I bought seasoned hash browns (which I think are a tad salty), but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

I have been making this version of casserole given to me by my sister for years. You can use it as a side dish to any meal without the ham and with eggs for breakfast if desired. Others I know put a crunchy topping on top with potato chips crunched up. Either way you use it...its a no mail go to recipe...I love using during bbq grill cookouts for a side dish to any steaks, brats, burgers, etc. A great recipe.

I made the recipe as instructed but with a bag of Potatoes O'Brien instead.  I brought it to a teacher appreciation breakfast.  Bottom line?  I have no idea what it tasted like because it was GONE before any other dish, and at least 10 teachers BEGGED for the recipe.

All I can say is AWESOME this recipe came out wonderful. I used the hash brown potatoes that came with the chopped onions and peppers in it and did not use the parmesan cheese at all. I also diced the ham into very small pieces. I brought this to work and it was gone with in 45 minutes. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I did not like this--I can't believe how high it's rated! It come out more like a soup than a casserole, and is too salty. I had to soak my dish overnight to be able to scrape everything off the inside. I do not recommend this dish.

This is a very good recipe. I used 16 oz. of sausage instead of ham/bacon and it turned out very tasty. I did throw a bit of sage into the sausage when cooking it, just because I like sage in my sausage. I also used onion and cheddar cheese soup as others had suggested (1 can cream of potato and 1 can cheddar cheese). One person commented that it was a bit dry and suggested more sour cream. I used about 1/2 cup of milk and that worked fine. I used "Simply Potatos" for my hashbrowns which is a refrigerated brand - not frozen. They worked well. This is a very rich dish and people who are willing to go off their low fat diets love it!  Big hit at a brunch!

This recipe is GREAT! I made it in a disposable tin for a camping trip, froze it and cooked it the morning after we arrived.  I made the following changes: 1 can cheese soup, 1 can potato soup, used Obrien hashbrowns, bacon and added sliced mushrooms.  I put in 1/2 the sour cream called for and then added the second 1/2 while cooking to keep it moist.  THANK YOU - This is definitely a must have!

This dish is simply marvelous!  I followed previous comments and used the Ore Ida O'Brien potatoes for a little extra flavor.  I served it at a brunch I had and everyone wanted the recipe.  It was very easy to prepare, my 3 1/2 year old son had fun dumping everything in the bowl for me to mix together.  I prepared it several hours before my event and kept it covered in the fridge until I was ready to cook it.

I made this with leftover Christmas Ham, it was very good.  My husband loved it.  There are only 3 of us, so I cut it in half and they cleaned it up.  He requested that I keep that receipe and kame again soon.

We did not enjoy this recipe very much.  It was too dry and there was way too much parmesan cheese.  A1/2 cup would have been plenty.

This was VERY good and VERY easy!  A great way to use leftover ham.  Was even
good leftover-- I heated it in a non-stick skillet and it got wonderfully brown & 
crunchy on the bottom.  My mom has asked for the recipe and I know I'll be 
making it again & again.

Loved it! In consideration of what sounded very rich and high in fat I used the ham and potatoes but skipped the parm, cut sour cream and soup in half, added about 1/3 cup low fat milk and used about 12 ozs of shredded cheese blend. I was nervous that I might have ruined it but it was excellent. It was moist and had delicious flavor even the next day as left overs. Thank you for sharing it!!

I tried this recipe for a breakfast potluck at work and everyone loved it! I was so pleased.  I needed something simple that could bake while I slept or got ready.  So, I tested a small casserole of it the night before for dinner, but it took well over one hour to bake properly. Not sure why :( So, I prepped my larger casserole dish that same night, put it in the fridge, then the following day, I got up at 5am to bake it. It took almost 1hr 45 minutes to 2 hours to bake! At 375.  Still, it tasted amazing and was a crowd pleaser.  Can't beat how simple it was too.

SO easy and delicious! Took it to work for a holiday breakfast, and then made it for our family Christmas brunch, too. Was a huge hit for both groups. I did make some changes--the recipe is very forgiving, so you can easily make adjustments each time you make it, to change it up a bit. This time, I added spicy Italian sausage (crumbled and cooked before adding to casserole), about 1/2 tsp dry mustard, and 2 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce. Also used freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano--makes a huge difference in flavor compared to the canned or any pre-grated Parmesan (even though seemingly expensive for a block, it goes a long way and is worth the difference). Also listened to previous reviewers recommendations to be sure to use the Cream of Potato soup, not another flavor--definitely agree that this makes a big difference, too. Could certainly use other creamed soups in a pinch (have used both celery and chicken in the past), but potato is the best.

This recipe is a keeper! I had been assigned to make one of the  breakfasts at a weekend quilting retreat so I decided to make this. When I found out another person was making something similar with ham, I decided to change it a bit and put in Jimmy Dean pre-cooked sausage crumbles instead of the ham. It was wonderful! And so easy. I felt a little guilty when everyone raved over my dish and not so much for the other persons similar recipe. Hubby loved it, too!

I made it a point to read as many reviews as possible and took them all into consideration. If you're on a low sodium diet, this meal is not for you, however with my altercations, my family devoured it. I have an incredibly picky family to feed. Husband is a cook (but hates cooking at home), son 10 picky and never hungry, my 2 year old won't eat anything unless he watches me cook it.

1 can potato soup
1 C low fat sour cream
thawed hashbrowns
sharp cheddar 1 C (save some for top)
monteray/chedder mix 1 C
Mrs. Dash (original- I use this alot)
Garlic powder to taste
Freshly cracked Pepper
Sprinkle of Cumin

Mix it all up, top with sharp chedar and sprinkle with parmesan 375 for 1 hour. The boys were all incredibly happy and all had second and third helpings. My job was done

Until I had to prep the turkey spaghetti sauce for the veggie lasagna tonight.

I made a few changes to this and everyone loves it. Instead of ham I use andoile sausage and I use pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar. One family sized potato soup works. This recipe rocks Never grows old!It turns the flavor up  just enough, but not hot. Trust me!

Very tasty!  I took it to my office and it disappeared.  Highly recommended.  Having said that, while I intended to make no changes, I was overcome by events!  I went to the store and forgot to get ham.  So I ended up using some andouille sausage I had in the freezer.  I cut up two sausages (Johnsonville) and it wasn't enough. You couldn't really taste the meat.  I find this recipe to be incredibly versatile - I think you could use bacon, ham, sausage or even ground beef.  I'm guessing you really do need 8 oz. - I went light on the andouille since I didn't know how spicy it would be.  I also used O'Brien potatoes instead of regular hashbrowns.  An excellent change!  I used the cream of potato soup and all cheddar cheese.  Two cups in the mix and a then a cup spread on top instead of the parmesan.  I've also decided that if you take out the meat, the recipe would make a fantastic potato side dish.  Either way, a total keeper!

Excellent!  A huge hit every time I make it!  I have substitued light sour cream and low fat cheese before and it was just fine if you are looking to make it a little healthier.  And it's just as good the next day reheated!

I made this casserole for a church fellowship and it was gone in 10 minutes.  Our members loved it and I will be giving out the recipe.  Two things ... I thawed the hash browns before mixing the casserole and I put 3/4 cup of grated Parmesan Cheese instead of 1-1/2 cups.  It was delicious!  I will be using this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing.

Served to a group without trying out on my own crew and it was raved about by all!! I messed up and bought tater tots instead of hash browns and it turned out great. I prep ahead of time and it sat overnight- just let it set at room temp 30 min prior to popping in oven. I do not like ham and I loved this-a nice trade up from the egg and sausage monkeys we are used to.

Made it last night for a quick and easy dinner and it's a keeper for sure. Added onion and used just a bit more sour cream like some reviews suggested. it sparked a 30 min discussion of all the stuff you could do to this casserole and all the ingredients you could use...I can see how this is going to be so much fun to play with, but loved it as is also.

This recipe was easy and tasty. I followed instructions except: 1) I did not have hashbrowns so I used tater tots  2)I used a little less cheddar cheese than called for  3)used less Parmesan Cheese than called for. Served to my hubby and 2 grandchildren and they really liked it. Sweet Peas on the side and rolls. Keeper for us. Thanks!

This was creamy and delicious! Potatoes, cheese, and ham - what's not to love? I made it once as written but found it too salty. The second time, I followed reviewers' suggestions to use cheddar cheese on top instead of parmesan and it cut down the saltiness perfectly. I received lots of compliments when serving this to guests. Very tasty.

Absolutely wonderful!  I served it with roasted asparagus (drizzled with olive oil and garlic salt) on the side.  The only thing I will do differently next time is double the amount of ham to 2 cups.  My husband and son just loved this casserole - great comfort food!

This is a keeper--a real keeper! My hub said it was "Super! Super! Super!" I like to review the recipes just as they are written, but I did not have frozen hash browns and so, I had to improvise on that. The winter storm made us house bound and we wanted a wonderful morning breakfast; so I baked 5 large Russet potatoes the night before and cooled them in the refrig overnight. The next morning, I peeled the skins off and then grated them on my largest grater into a big bowl. I mixed all the other ingredients so they were well combined(oh, I did saute in 1 tsp butter the ham and added 1c finely chopped onions, just until the onions were translucent)and then gently folded into the grated potatoes.  I topped it with a combination of sharp cheddar cheese and freshly grated Parmesan.  (We think that the "Parmesan shaker can kind" makes things way too salty!)I was unsure how the potatoes would come out, but I am here to tell you, they were amazingly fluffy and light. I scrambled eggs on the side and we were off to the races. The result was a scraped clean, nothing, nada, the big goose egg--- pan with no leftovers in sight! It appears this will be the 'go-to' recipe for other events--church, school and work.

Sometimes messing with the recipe too much is not a good idea, and this is one of those times.  The only thing I did really is saute mushrooms, onions and green peppers instead of ham and added salt pepper and ground thyme and it was outstanding. I used it as a steak side dish.

Love this recipe! It's a huge quantity... half was plenty for our family. I grated two md-lg russet potatoes instead of using frozen and it worked well. Also note though this recipe is much more like a scalloped potato casserole than hash browns, so it would be fine for a dinner. The texture is creamy and soft inside.

Awesome! Added 1 green bell pepper and 1 medium white onion diced. I only use 1 can cream of mushroom, gluten free, instead of two cans of soup.  This is on the regular rotation for years now, one of my husbands favorites.

WoW! My family loved this! Like others, I used Ore Ida's Potatoes O'Brien. We did cut back the parmesean as well. We were thinking about making as a main dish casserole next time, by adding diced chicken, and broccoli, then maybe adding a tossed salad and garlic bread to complete the meal. We also discussed stirring in Mrs. Dash's Southwest seasoning, diced jalepeno's, and black beans for a different spin. The casserole stands on its own without any changes, but it also allows for alot of simple creativity when using the recipe as a base casserole. Thanks POOBOO for sharing!

Made this casserole this morning.  It's good, but considering the reviews were nothing short of stellar, I was a bit disappointed.  I will not be making again.

Easy to make. I used low fat sour cream, no qty changes. I thought it was a bit tangy and that less sour cream would be optimal. my husband ate all the leftovers so since he liked it so much i still rate this 5 stars :)

I made this AS IS.   Only, I got ahead of myself and added the parmesan cheese to the mix, instead of using it as a topping.   It is still amazingly delicious.  I would not change a thing.  I was tempted to add milk when I saw the consistency of the mixture, I thought it was going to be too dry, but it all came out perfectly.  Thanks for introducing me to Cream of Potato Soup.  I just may try it with other things too!!   Great recipe!!

This was very easy to make. Mix it up and throw it in the oven. we could only find a 30oz bag of hash browns and the ham we only found in a 5oz package. We used the same amount of the rest of the stuff and it turned out great.

Made this recipe as listed and my family loved it!  It went especially well made from our leftover baked ham from Christmas/Thanksgiving.  I tried it next time with mild cheddar but wasn't as good...definitely use sharp.

This was delicious and so simple to make during the busy Christmas morning.  Combined all the ingredients, though I added mushrooms, and popped in the oven.  An hour later, a delicious and easy breakfast that was enjoyed by everyone.  Next time, I may add some spinach for color.  A definite keeper recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

Ours was really salty, too!  

Awesome! Served at x-mas dinner and it was delish! Store was out of hash brown potatoes, so I used hash brown patties and it came out wonderful. I layered mine instead of mixed it altogether and used bacon bits instead of ham (since we were having ham as the main dish) and it was delicious. Oh, and I swapped out plain yogurt for sour cream since I hate sour cream. Also added hot red pepper flakes. :)

I've been making this since I found the recipe here in 2005 or  2006.  I love it and get lots of compliments.  I make it w/o the ham as a side dish when serving ham as the main meat and with sausage instead of cubed ham for a breakfast casserole.  It is great to take to potluck brunches.

This is really good.  I decided to make a meal out of it and added green peas, green onions, sauted mushroom and sauted onion and garlic.  Served it with a salad and the husband loved it.

Yummy. Added some sauted peppers for nutrition's sake, used fat free sour cream, and reduced fat cheddar and it was still creamy and yummy (I bet with all the fat it would be to die for).  Just a word of warning- no bowl in my house was large enough to mix this!! And cold it has the consistency of mortar- bring your trowel.

Not bad, but not my favorite either.  It was a little gritty, for lack of better term.  I think it might be the cream of potato soup - something about it seemed too heavy?  Can't quite put my finger on it, and don't have any useful suggestions - I think I need to fool around with it a bit and see if I can tweak it to my tastes.

Thought the casserole turned out well using the provided ingredients/directions.  I added frozen peas and substituted the sour cream with greek yogurt to cut the calories.  My husband and I both agreed that the end result was pretty salty so I'm hoping to find a lower sodium cream of potato (wasn't at the store lasted I checked) to help cut the salt content.

My potatoes were still very crunchy. Was I supposed to let the hash browns thaw first? Also, I had the opposite problem with salt. My husband made it while I was out so I asked if he added any salt or not and he said no. It desperately needed it.
I will probably make this again and let the hash browns thaw first so they aren't so crunchy and I will definitely add some salt. Maybe a little pepper too. I think with those changes, it will be a lot better.

Turned out great.  I doubled the meat, and followed other reviewers.  I added pepper, garlic powder and parsley.  So glad I did, it would have been bland otherwise.  Not even close to too salty, not sure what those reviewers were thinking.

My husband and I loved this one.  My husband's only complaint the first time I made it was that there was not enough ham, so the next time I just added more and we loved it!  I really think that some people tolerate salt a lot more than others, but just from the title if I didn't like a lot of salt I think I would have passed it up.

This recipes was fast and easy to make but very bland.  Definately needs something to spice it up.  I think next time I will make the bear creek brand cream of potato soup on the thick side and make it with that instead of campbells soup.  Then I will add some parsley and onions and pepper.  Good basic recipes though especially easy in that would could make it ahead of time!

I made this recipe just as written and my family really liked it!  Plus it was nice to find a recipe that was not full of cooked veggies, which my hubby hates.  It was not too salty like others have said.  Next time I will add some garlic powder, but that is all.  Can't wait to take this to a big family reunion this summer.  Thanks!

This recipe is SO good and SO easy, it is a staple for potlucks or big family dinners.  It makes A LOT so it's great if you're serving a group or if you like leftovers for lunch the next day.  Plus, it could easily be used for a breakfast casserole.

I made this while camping, so used dried hashbrowns in a box and just added hot water to reconstitute them. Forgot the parmesan, but had all other ingredients. Made in a cast iron dutch oven over really low heat. Stirred often.  It turned out super terrific!!!! Everyone raved and there were no leftovers.

This was really salty tasting and some-what bland. The cheese sauce would be nice for homemade au gratin potatoes I think. My daughter would only eat the crispy cheese that was on top, my son picked at it, but I'm not sure he really ate any of it. My husband ate his portion but would not get seconds. He ALWAYS gets seconds! My husband and two children absolutely refuse to eat this again and there were TONS of leftovers. I've eaten several servings worth for the past four days and again for lunch today... And there's STILL one more serving left!

Followed the recipe except for 1 mistake on my part that turned out ok.  I only used 1 can of cream of potato soup.  I also added half again as much ham.  Came out great!  Thinking about topping with chopped bacon, and something to add to the parmesean cheese to make it a bit crunchy, maybe a little Panko?

I made this exactly according to the recipe, except that I baked it the night before without the parmesan cheese, then put it back in the oven in the morning for about 25 minutes with the parmesan sprinkled on top.  Delicious!

This is fantastic. We had it for the first time last night, and mdh and daughter raved over it. I thought so much parmesan cheese would be a bit much, but it gives it a nice kick. I've used the same recipe, minus ham and parmesan, since the 70s, and that makes an unbeatable side dish. We usually bring it out for holiday cooking; no one tires of it. So happy to see this version with the ham and parmy added. Thanks for the recipe! Going into my permanent files. :0) *FWIW, it seemed a bit short on ham; my particular (generous) serving was almost completely lacking in ham. For the future I am upping the amount to 1 1/2 to 2 cups ham.

I wanted to cut back on the calories so I only used half a cup of shredded cheese, didn't use any Parmesan and used light sour cream. It was delicious!

This was yummy!  My husband, daughter and I loved it. I made it exactly as stated, no changes needed.  But I did see some ideas that would be fun to change it up a bit.  Instead of ham - Bacon and green onions or chives could make it a loaded baked potato casserole.  Green peppers and onions would be awesome as well.  I appreciate you sharing this recipe.  I know many more will enjoy it as I plan on using this for future gatherings.  Thanks!!!

I served this wonderful casserole at a birthday dinner for my Mom's 87th birthday.  It was a total success and everyone absolutely loved it.  I did do a couple things differently.  I cooked the chicken in a crock--pot until tender and I also substituted fresh spinach for the canned.  I love spinach but not canned.   This will certainly be on the  menu again in the near future.

I made this dish this morning for a bunch of hungry airmen and it turned out great.  I did substitute one of the cans of potato soup for cheese soup and I added a little more ham to make it meatier.  I too thought it tasted a little like scalloped potatoes and wondered what I could do to incorporate more of a breakfast flair (I was thinking of baking without the cheese for 45 mins then adding eggs and cheese at the end), but the boys said not to change a thing.  So I'll let the recipe stand on it's own merits.  If you do want to spice it up a bit with different flavors, you could add salsa for a Mexican flare.  I think I'll offer that on the side next time.

I really expected to love this and I'm not sure why I didn't.  Potatoes, cheese, ham... what's not to love?  Unfortunately, despite the sharp cheddar and the sour cream, it seemed a bit bland to me.  I really wanted to like this one but for some reason it didn't do it for me.  On the plus side, it was a snap to put together and pop in the oven (even on a work day).

This is delish!  I half the recipe for my husband and me and serve it as a main dish at supper.  I usually use mild or medium cheddar and a mix of cheddar and mozzarella on the top rather than the parmesan.  Next time I make it, I'm going to add some onion.  It's the only thing lacking.

Cheesy, hammy, potato goodness... what else can you say?  Good stuff, everyone always likes these.  When in a pinch I've used Real Bacon Bits when ham is not on hand, tasty.  Also, I don't know why but it seems like the recipe is a bit tastier and creamier when using fresh peeled potatoes BUT much more work!

I made this for teacher appreciation week at my daughters' school. I left the ham out since most of the teachers are vegetarian and I forgot the Parmesan and topped it with Cheddar. They LOVED it. When I picked up my dish after school it was ALL gone (I'd made a batch and a half). Will definitely make again!!!

This was pretty good, but it was a little bland. Next time I make it I will add onion to the mix. I think onion would have given it the kick it needed.

This is a wonderful casserole. I served it New Years Day, and everyone loved it. I think it's great as it is. However, I can see where it can easily accommodate additional ingredients. I will try adding onions and red and/or green peppers next time. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

Super easy and kid friendly!  I only put the parmesan cheese on half of the casserole, and both sides were delish.  Also easy to make a half-recipe in an 8x8 pan.  Just add a veggie and you're a hero!

This is the first breakfast casserole that I have made, and it was a huge hit! I made it for a surprise birthday party at work, and everyone was really impressed by my cooking skills! My boss is allergic to gluten, so I had to find a recipe that did not have any bread/flour in it.  I went exactly by the directions, and it came out perfect! I will definitely use this recipe again!

Great dish! Didn't seem as rich as some cheesy hash brown casseroles I've had. I did add some minced onion flakes and pepper. Will make again!

I scaled this recipe down to 6 and it turned out great. I made it ahead and baked it off in the evening. Tasted great. I served for dinner.

Excellent! I make this for a big crowd around the holidays for part of our brunch. Since we have a few vegetarians, I make this without the ham.

Yummmmmm!  I made this one year for Thanksgiving and now I'm not allowed to show up without it!  We have some vegetarians in the family so I eliminate the ham and add one chopped up red pepper for color and flavor.  SO good.

Just made this for Easter and it was a huge hit.  Since we were having ham as a main dish, I did not add the ham to the casserole...that said it tastes great with ham!  I took the other reviewers' advice: I used one can cheddar soup and one can potato, I used the light sour cream, I added half a pack of French onion soup mix, and if you use the cubed hashbrowns you really do need to defrost them and lightly brown them first.  Plate lickin' good!!

I have now made this (upon request) three times. the first two times we made it with ham sandwich meat since I could not find diced ham at the store. It was a huge hit! The third time I made it I was actually able to find diced ham at Food For Less. It was agreed that it ended up being to much ham at once. Next time we will use ham sandwich meat again. I will however try to make this next time I make a ham and use the leftovers.   Other then changing the diced ham to sliced ham I did every thing as the recipe says and it was amazing. Also so easy by the second time I made it I didn't even need to pull up the recipe!

This was exactly what I was looking for! I made this on a Saturday afternoon, put it in a timed oven during church, and served it about an hour later. Perhaps a combination of cheese sprinkled on the top would have given the casserole a better presentation than just the Parmesan cheese. Something to play with but definitely worth making.

I was really disappointed in the consistency of this dish.  It was not creamy and saucy like I had hoped.  It almost seemed "curdled".  I followed directions exactly but think it needed some 1/2 and 1/2 or milk to thin out the sauce and provide a better texture.  None of the kids (ages 8, 10 and 15) would eat it.

Love this recipe. It was the first time I've ever tried a casserole like this, and for the first time ever, my husband was excited to eat it over the next few days. I've made it 1 time exactly per the recipe, 3 times with tweaks, and the last one I made, the changes were perfect. This is a great base for getting things rolling and tweaking things around to suit your families tastes.

I halved the recipe and baked in 9x9 square pan on the eve of Hurricane Ike. Kids LOVED this, even hubby had seconds, which is rare since he's watching his weight! Used Cream of Mushroom soup and it was wonderful, added 4oz can drained mushrooms, and used shredded mozzarella plus 2 slices Velveeta. Served with peas, and everyone loved it. Thanks for the post, I'll add this to my keeper box!

Wow! I made this for my Easter brunch along with two other dishes which are major crowd pleasers (blueberry french toast bake and denver omlette bake), and this was devoured! Everyone-even a guest who rarely eats-couldn't stop raving about it. It was a total hit and my other crowd pleasers weren't even finished, while this was almost licked clean.

I made this exactly as called for in the original recipe. 

Will definitely make again and again.

I made only a half portion, this recipe is really easy to scale. There are two of us, and we ate most of it, with a small serving left over. Also, I used tater tots instead of hash browns. Delicious! Just needed a little bit of salt and pepper. My boyfriend is already asking when I will make it again.

Made this as a main dish for Sunday dinner today with rave comments by all. Tweaked a bit for a healthier, somewhat more flavorful version as follows: Hash brown potatoes with peppers and onion; 1 can cream of potato soup, 1 can cream of onion soup; 1/2 can low fat milk;
8 oz. reduced fat sour cream; 1 small onion sliced; freshly ground pepper; 1/4 tsp. garlic powder; 1/2 c. sharp cheddar cheese; and sprinkled only about 1/4 c. grated Parmeson cheese on top before baking. As changed, Results superb! I'll be using this as a "signature" dish for future dinners and potlucks. Side dishes included All Recipes Pan-Fried Asparagus, Maple Dill Carrots, and Rhubarb Strawberry Crunch (again tweaked for a healthier version),served with vanilla ice cream for dessert.

Wow! Deffinite keeper. I made with the cream of potato soup and was wonderful, will try next time with half fat cream of chix and see how that tastes. I only used about 1/2 cup of parmesan on the top and that was plenty! I also added about 1 C. of mixed veggies because thats all I had left and wanted to use them up. They were awesome in there! I will use a bit more in there next time. Even my kids commented on how good the veggies were. The whole family gives this recipe 5 stars!

Superb! Made with a combination of colby and Monterey jack cheese in place of cheddar, only because it was dinner time and I found that the cheddar had been eaten. Still, no problem with the substitution. No doubt this recipe is very adaptable to whatever kind of cheese you have around. I've also made this with Campbell's Cream of Chicken With Herbs, and it was even more flavorful than with the Cream of Potato.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I think it has potential - I made exactly as written and it was very bland (for me); however, my husband and kids (including a one year old) loved it!!!  I would defintiely add some onions and peppers and perhaps spinach, tomatoes, and muchrooms with some spices...

This recipe is WONDERFUL!!! It went over very well in my house the first time I made it (years ago now), So I continue to make it every time we have left over ham. Since the first time I made it I've used sour cream with chives, and it tastes great that way. My whole household loves it, and everyone else that tries it demands that I give them the recipe (my parents, grandparents, in-laws, friends, co-workers, literally everyone who tries it). You should definately try this recipe if you haven't already. It's so easy, and sooo good :)

I halved this recipe since I was only preparing it for 2 people, but next time I'll make it as written because we ate a ton, and I like having leftovers for later.  I think the cream of potato soup is great with it, use at least one can.  I also just sprinkled a little bit of parm on top.  Use the sour cream. Really yummy and easy to make!

Although the recipe would be a bit bland without addtions, I think this is great! The creamy consistency is so good!

Here's what I added:
*a bit of extra ham because I wanted to use it up
*garlic and onion powders
*cayenne pepper for a bit of zing
*black pepper
*mix of chedder and parm on top added at the last 20 minutes to prevent burning

Here's what I changed:
*substituted cream of celery and cream of chicken soups (low sodium)
*lite sour cream and only about 8oz since people said it was liquidy with all of it added.

Things I would recommend:
Crumbled sausage, green onions, other sauteed onions, parsley, zucchini, etc.

I've made this a zillion times and love it every time!  I add some diced chili as well and use either cream of mushroom, chicken, or potato depending on what I have.  I use a little less of the soup or sour cream than it calls for because otherwise I find it too liquidy.  I make this for dinner as well as breakfast and it tastes better the next day!

This was an average recipe. I think it was quite salty. Next time I might try low sodium soups, which I added 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of celery, added chopped onion, and omitted the parmasean cheese.

I made this for a Boss's Day brunch.  Mixed it together, put it in the oven & it was ready to go 
to work when I was!  Thought the 13x9 pan was going
to be too much food but there wasn't a crumb left.
Had many requests for the recipe including a couple
of guys that never cook!  I did make a couple of 
changes - used breakfast sausage instead of ham;
added a 4 oz can of diced green chiles & used 
pepper jack cheese instead of parmesan.  If you 
really wanted to spice it up you could use jalapenos
instead of green chiles.  One of my co-workers had
a great suggestion if you have leftovers - put it
in a tortilla for a tasty breakfast burrito!

I followed this recipe to the letter and the casserole turned out very runny.  To try to salvage the dinner, my husband and I had it over mashed potatoes.  Then we threw out the rest.  Also was way too rich for my taste.  I will never make this again.

This casserole is so easy to make which is always a plus!  I used a can of cheddar cheese soup in place of one of the cans of potato.  I also used 3 cups of shredded cheese and I'd recommend more ham.  This was a big hit!

This was a bit too rich and saucy for us, but tasty.  We heated up the leftovers and liked the dish better then, as it was drier.  I'd make it for a brunch with lots of other, less rich, things, like mixed fruit with no dressing and fresh juice.

I made this tonight, it was great! My husband ate three helpings and then commented that he thought the sour cream needed to be reduced some. I just loved it.  If I was making it just for me and other people that like green pepper I would take finely diced green pepper and saute in butter then add it to this but even without it I know this is something I will make again and again! Great potluck dish too!

I love each of the ingredients included in this recipe.  That, coupled with the rave reviews, had me making this recipe right away.  Yes, it did smell absolutely wonderful while it was baking, but I found that it was soooooo salty.  Guess it's the soup, ham AND 1-1/2 cups of parmesan cheese.  If I make it again, I will definitely use less parmesan and see if I can find a low-salt soup.

I thought this was quite tasty.  It was quick and easy and I already had most of the ingredients.  To me, it even tasted good the second day which is a bonus since I made a 9x13 for only two people.

I made this last night to test out on my family before serving it for an upcoming party.  It was really easy to make and it tasted great!  My husband loved it and he is very "honest" about my cooking.  I substituted swiss cheese for cheddar.  I will try cheddar for the party and more ham.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a great recipe. I did alter it just a wee bit. I added one can of cheddar cheese soup and cut the sour cream down to half. The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the t and it was too sour and dry. The second time with my alterations it was much better! This is a keeper! :)

I recently made this casserole (quick and easy!!) for an RVing trip with friends.  To reduce the fat content, I used fat-free sour cream and reduced-fat Cheddar cheese and substituted one can of reduced-fat cream of mushroom sour for one of the cans of potato soup.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe, Melissa.

Easy and delicious.  My only comment is that I expected a more solid consistency, but it isn't a casserole that can be cut in squares and served.  Instead, you need a spoon.

This is the first ever recipe I've tried making from this site. I used fresh potatoes instead of frozen, but wasn't sure how to hash them, so I diced them. Used less Parmesan than specified because I feared it might get too salty. Didn't substitute anything for the cream of potato like some others though. What I ended up with tasted great, even if it was technically no longer a hash brown casserole. >_>

Update 9/14: Full disclosure, I just found out for the first time today that 2 cups of shredded cheese is eight ounces, not sixteen. That means all three times I have made this casserole, it was double cheesed. >_> I do use barely any Parmesan though. It's been delicious every time, but now I wanna try it the correct way with one bag of cheddar and all the Parmesan to see what I've been missing.

Have been making this recipe for years now. I wanted to change it and spice it up a little. Instead of the 2 cups of cheddar cheese I used 2 cups of Pepper Jack Cheese. Instead of the parmesian cheese I used Colby Monterey Cheese and added two table spoons of diced jalapeños. Had a great flavor.

I agree with the others.. this is better than other recipies recipes and I think it is due to the potatoe soup.  I used frozen O'brien potatoes (with the peppers chopped in it) 1 1/2 bags, 3 cans of soup, shredded cheese from Costco... and everything else it called for... NO EXTRA SALT (the ham was enough). Cut ham into big pieces (not little tiny ones).  Everyone LOVED it... really.  They ate for breakfast and lunch. THANK YOU!

It was good but we think that we like this kind of dish better with sausage, instead of ham. If I make again I will use some of my own cooked ham instead of the chopped packaged ham that I used this time. I will say that I did like the potato soup and sour cream flavor though.*****So I made it again and I had to change my 3 from before to a 5.  I used my own cooked ham and wow what a difference it made.  This time I also used diced potatoes w/onions (what I had on had).

I'll never put a can of soup in anything as a general thickener, and I don't use processed potatoes when my own fresh are so much better, but I still recommend the recipe.  Instead of using 2 cans of processed condensed soup, just cook 6 medium potatoes, cubed into about 1cm cubes, in boiling water for 10 minutes or until the potato is still intact at the edges but is tender to the point of a sharp knife.  Withhold 1/2 of water, drain the potatoes, and use the withheld 1/2 water, combined with 1C milk and 1C sour cream, for the sauce.  Of course I pan fried the ham with an onion and fresh herbs (1 sprig of chopped thyme, 1 sprig of chopped rosemary and 3 cloves of garlic) until brown first.  Delish!  Because you cooked the potatoes first in boiled water, the oven time of the recipe is cut by 1/2.  You can also finish the dish by broiling it for 5 minutes to give it a lovely brown crust.

My family really liked it. I did it one time exactly like the recipe says and husband says it tasted too cheesy so the second time around I skipped the sour cream and added 1/4 cup of green bell peppers, red bell peppers and onions. It's somuch better

This is GREAT for crockpots also! I take this to potluck events. I just double the recipe. The recipe is perfect!, I substitute the the cheddar cheese for mild cheddar. Other than that I follow the recipe. It's a hit wherever I take it, and I never have left overs.

It's ok and easy enough. Wish I had read variations before making because I would have used cheddar cheese soup. I only used 1 cup of the grated parm and I think it's still too much. I may do 1/2 c of the grated parm mixed with more shredded cheddar and love the idea of the French fried onions on top (or maybe some Ritz cracker crumbs).

It was almost too salty with the salt from the ham and canned soup. I did make one substitution, I used fat free plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  That was for added protein, however, it may be what fixed some of the complaints about it being runny as greek yogurt does set up well when cooked.  But this was good enough that I may have to prepare some cream of potato soup from scratch and freeze to make this casserole.  Note, I didn't pay that much attention when I added this to my meal plan and made it thinking the eggs on the list were for this.  The lack of eggs makes this a better side than main dish.  I may try making it with broccoli instead of ham and serving as a side or take to pot lucks for vegetarian friends.

This is a very tasty and easy recipe. I did a few things different. I added green onions and used oreIda potatoes o'brien with onions & peppers. Also i cut the recipe in half. This is going to be one of the great recipe dish i make for the holidays so that the family can have a taste. Great job. It is very good.

I liked this recipe with my modifications.  I used approximately 8 oz of diced ham and cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of potato soup.  I thought the cream of potato soup would just be to much potato with all the hash browns.

Made this for a noon game tailgate party this weekend. It was a hit! Went great with sausage balls, beer, and mimosas! Super easy to make. Made it the night before and put it in the fridge. Baked it the next morning covered in foil for 30 minutes then removed foil for last 30. Came out perfect! Traveled 2 hours with it in a Pyrex "keep warm" carrier. Still perfect on arrival to the tailgate party. Family renamed it a "GameDay Kickasserole!"

This is a great casserole!  I use it in my café a couple weekends a month and it gets rave reviews over and over!  I use a little less cheese all the way around, and instead of parm I use some pepper jack, which gives it a little kick.  YUM!

I thought this was a very tasty and super easy recipe to put together! I forgot the hash browns and ended up using tater tots instead. It was good! And I also used half the amount of sour cream it called for and used ricotta cheese to substitute the rest! Overall I would definitely make it again!

Excellent casserole...easy and delicious. I added a 1/4 cup onion and a 1/4 cup red bell pepper (both finely chopped). I served this as a side dish for dinner.

I can't say I love it, sorry.  I think it may have been the ham I used.  So salty, it overtook everything.

I recently made this without the ham and it was fantastic. Another reviewer said to stick with cream of potato and not to substitute. I followed those instructions but didn't think it would make that much of a difference. It did. I made this again and tried substituting potato soup. Not good. If you stick with the recipe the results are delicious.

Delicious!  I was looking for a good breakfast casserole for a ladies' brunch at church, and came across this recipe and based on the plethora of wonderful reviews, decided to give it a try.  We made several of these, and they received rave reviews from everyone.  It was absolutely perfect for a large event, because the recipe is simple and inexpensive, but absolutely delicious! It has the added benefit of appealing to those who do not like eggs. I have served it to my family, and am making it for a teachers' brunch at our school.  This is a great recipe, and I plan to have it on hand for Christmas this year, and use it as a go-to breakfast casserole.

Fantastic! I made this for Easter brunch and did a meat and vegetarian version with onions, mushrooms and red bell peppers and both got rave reviews. Pretty much followed the recipe but cut the sour cream in half and used 30 oz. bag of hash browns. Will make again.

Whew, all I could taste in this was salt. My husband thought the flavor was good, so we differed on that. The biggest thing to try and alter is the consistency. It came out extremely soupy, did not firm up at all. Maybe next time I will only use one can of soup.

Definitely 5 stars!  I split the recipe into two parts, and made one with ham and one without.  Both were very good - some members of family preferred with and some preferred without.  Strong sour cream taste, which we all loved!  Will make again and again.  DO NOT SUBSTITUTE THE POTATO SOUP - it will result in a very different taste.  I used cubed hash browns, and I liked it that way.

A+ and then some! Great recipe! 
After reading many reviews, here are my comments. 
I increased the recipe by half as I had five young men coming to dinner (total of nine guests). NO leftovers. Amount was just right at 1.5. For that size, I added 1/2 cup frozen peas, 1 cup finely chopped onion, 1 tsp smoked paprika and 1/2 tsp black pepper. I also used O'Brien (cubed) potatoes and 2 cups of ham. I mixed parmesan with cheddar 50/50 for the topping. I used reduced fat sour cream. I did cook it for about 20 minutes longer due to the increased amount. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It definitely was NOT too salty. 
It was BEYOND delicious! GREAT way to use leftover ham! This recipe with the above personal adjustments is definitely 100% a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was pretty good!  Made as directed with the exception of adding a small bit of minced onion.  My half batch was still a little undercooked after 1 hour (and I started with half-thawed potatoes), so I'll add maybe an extra 15 mins next time and cover for the first half of the baking time.  Think I'll reduce the sour cream a little too.

We loved this but I think next time I might add some green chilies.  I used only 1 cup of parmesan cheese which was more than enough. A nice way to switch up a standard potluck dish.

I made it exactly as written and it was way too salty and too much sour cream taste for my family.  It may have been better with some of the changes others recommended but as written, this one wasn't good to us.

Everything is pretty much the same. Even ALL that sour cream. Whew. I had squash and cubed that up along with some potatoes I had. Mixed veggies added. Yummy. Very good. Very simple. LOTS! Loving it. I left off the Parmesan and just put cheddar and green onions on top. WU HOOO

This was a yummy casserole! It is fairly easy to put together as well. My husband liked it better as leftovers - the thought after the flavors had sat overnight everything tasted better.

Excellent recipe.  This will be my go to holiday breakfast!  Do not substitute the parmesan cheese -- it adds sooo much flavor.  You can use whatever kind of meat you prefer and even add veggies if you like.  It reminds me of Cracker Barrel's hash brown casserole, except it's better.

Made this for a women's bible Study group.....there was only one spoonful left which I gladly brought home and devoured for lunch!  Had several people to comment on how good it was and asked for the recipe.  I pretty much made it as the recipe stated except for adding some sauteed onion to the mix and additional cheddar on top along with the shredded Parmesan.  I enjoyed it very much and will be making this again!

I can think of better things to do with these ingredients, but it was good - almost a meal by itself. It is easy, but the hour in the oven makes it not very quick. I had to make it up the day before and bake it the next day.

Added ground pepper.  used obrien potatoes. Used a bag of pre shredded 3cheese cheddar mix.   Used a little less Parmesan cheese. (Not box parmesan!). Otherwise the same.  Was a hit and none was left.

Loved this casserole!! The only thing I would change is maybe use low sodium cream of potato(if there is such a thing) to help with the salty taste. This will become a staple in my household for now on!!

Great recipe! I did have to make some changes though. They were out of shredded hashbrowns at my grocery store so I used diced potatoes instead. I also bought a small bag of "stir fry vegetables" and added it in so it was less breakfast-y but then there wasn't enough sauce so I added a can of cream of mushroom I had in my cupboard. Definitely recommend adding the vegetables, but that's just how I like my casseroles. Family agreed, 4/5

I don't know how 32oz of hash browns would fit in a 9X13 - I used 26oz and it was VERY full, almost to overflowing.  It also took well over 1 hour to bake and when I did serve it, it was not hot. Very disappointed in this recipe.  I found it bland.

This is delicious!! I did add some sauteed onions (1/4 cup) and some garlic powder and used just enough fresh parmesan to cover the top (probably about 1/2 cup) because I have to watch salt intake. I used all the other ingredients as listed. I took it to a prayer brunch and everyone loved it. I'll keep this in my often used recipes because it doesn't have egg and you can eat it any time. I think it would be good with burgers or hotdogs and baked beans!! Thanks for the recipe POOBOO!!

I have been making one similar to this for years..Usually add pepper and garlic powder and cooked and crumbled ground sausage.  It makes a great side dish without the sausage and we usually use cream of chicken soup.

This was such a great recipe I did change just a couple things first I omitted the parmesan cheese. I sautéed onions with a stick of butter and threw in a little garlic powder and some pepper. I used half bag of shredded colby in the casserole and half bag of shredded sharp cheddar on top about 10 mins before it was done. It was so creamy and smooth I will make this again soon so easy to make my kids made this for father's day breakfast.

Wow - unbelievably simple recipe yields a scrumptious dish!  Being the ding-a-ling that I am, I forgot the shredded cheese until about 30min into the cook - it still came out fantastic!!  I kinda thought the recipe sounded a little bland so I added scallions and chopped red/yellow peppers.  It was so incredible good I had to immediately freeze 3/4 of it so I wouldn't just eat the whole darn pan!  Not for those seeking a low cal or cholesterol meal - but a great treat once in a while.  Had it with a salad and was full for the rest of the day.

I doubled this recipe for a school teacher breakfast.  It had to be baked the night before, and then reheated the next morning.  Instead of using only cream of potato, I substituted cream of celery, cream of asparagus, and cream of mushroom for 3 cans of potato.  Everyone  was crazy about it.  I even had teachers offer to pay me for the ingredients if I would make it again.

Very rich and creamy.  Definitely not low cal but one of the best of the ham and potato casseroles I've tried.  I'm not a huge fan of potatoes and luckily this was a good recipe that I couldn't overly taste potatoes.

I made this for a banquet, and although I got good comments on it, I thought it was bland.  I think this recipe lives and dies on the flavor of the brand of the cream of potato soup.  I added onions and I wish I had added garlic. The reviews said it was salty, so I didn't add salt (and the recipe didn't call for any).  It needed some salt (and pepper).

this was a good base recipe.  but it tasted very potatoey.  i used fresh hash browns instead of frozen and used ground breakfast sausage since i didn't have any ham.  i also doubled the meat to 2 cups but it still didn't seem meaty enough.  and 2 cups of cheese also just wasn't enough for my taste.  you could barely taste the cheese. next time i'll probably reduce the hash browns to just 20 oz and add more meat and cheese.

This dish is simple comfort food.  I followed the directions exactly as stated and it turned out great.  I loved the shredded parm on top, it gave it a nice crunchy texture.  Definitely recommend.

This was really good, I used breakfast sausage instead of ham, but apart from that - I didn't deviate.  It has a lot of flavor, but it's heavy.  I'ts true comfort food"- good ol'stick to your ribs eatin at it's finest!  I served it with some fruit and that provided the balance this dish needed.

I just made this today for our Easter brunch & LOVED it.  I didn't deviate from the recipe at all and thought it was better than some of my other similar recipes.  I've never used Cream of Potato soup and I love the flavor it added to this dish. I will definitely be making this one again.  Super easy & delicious!!!

Very good.  The only thing I changed was cutting the recipe down to two servings.  Just the hubs and I, and both of us really liked it.  It was a nice change from the other potato casserole that I make.

made this last night to go with burgers on the grill;  turned out pretty good.  Was definitely creamy (almost too soupy when it first came out of the oven, but set up a little bit after about 10min).  Mine was greasy on top, though!  Ugh!  I laid a couple of strong, absorbent paper towels across the top to blot up most of the grease & it looked a lot more appetizing after that.   *Final conclusion:  although this recipe was good, I think I like my old hashbrown casserole better (only 1 can of "Cream of ..." soup) and I might add diced ham to mine in the future. **   Oh yeah, I think it needs several shakes of Hot Sauce to give it a little zing!

I love casseroles and this is one of the best!! I used shredded Velveeta cheese instead of cheddar (it has fewer calories), only 1 cup of the parmesan on top and that was plenty and double the ham.  We love our meat! I served it with steamed brocolli.  Putting everything together was so fast and easy and you could easily add some veggies to the casserole.  I would just saute them first.  The whole family loved it. Great comfort food.

Absolutely delicious. My husband loved it and said we need to put it in rotation. I love how easy it was to make! Don't forget to thaw out the hash browns beforehand, I didn't and it was one solid block... microwaving the block for a couple of minutes thawed it enough to make it mixable. I'll definitely be making this again for dinner/breakfast as well as for pot lucks. Thanks for sharing this!

I am a new cook, and this was super easy to make, and very tasty!  Even though I really liked it, after my first plate, I decided it could use some onions. I added a small one to the leftovers, and then it was perfect!  I'll make this again for sure.

Guess I'm in the "I may get kicked to the curb" group.  Easy, yes.  Versatile, yes. Too rich, yes. Followed the directions exactly and  added mushrooms and green onions.  It needs a lot more veggies, in my opinion, to make it tastier and healthier.  Always surprised when there are so many raving reviews and I have a different response.  Probably a good thing I'm not in the restaurant business....

I make this a lot and everyone loves it.  I cut the recipe in half and still use a 9 X 13 pan.  I prefer the fresh hash browns...not frozen.  I add 1/4 cup milk and 2 T melted butter.  I first mix the soup, sour cream, butter and milk together and add ground pepper.  I then add the cheese.  Mix and then the hash browns and ham.  I also top this with 1 cup crushed Lays potato chips. I don't always add the ham.  I let it rest for 15 minutes before serving.

I decided to try this recipe for the first time couple of months ago. Well since than my wife has suggested a couple of add ins and well it helped make it even better. We add 2-3 eggs, half onion (diced), and bacon bits (personal fav of mine...the real deal non imitation). We even make it for dinner. This is a must have for any recipe box.

I traded one can of potato soup for 1 can of cream of chicken...added red onions and a little garlic powder...oh, and avoided the parmesan cheese. Lastly, I cooked it a bit longer to brown more! This is a FABULOUS recipe and am now making it again, one week later!

This is KILLER YUMMY comfort food!! I added chopped sautéed onion to mine cause I needed the onion with the other flavors. Also omitted the parmesan , but WOW, sooo good!! I've made a few times now and the first time I went into it thinking I might need to change the soup, but the cream of potato is perfect!

I made this recipe for my family and they LOVED it. I made it for supper and it was perfect. I did make some minor alterations just based on taste and what I had in the house. I used one can of cream of potato and one can of cheddar cheese soup. I also used about 4 oz. of jack cheese (shredded) and the rest was sharp cheddar. I topped it with french fried onion rings and some additional cheddar cheese. I also added one small can of green chilis since my husband likes a little zip in these kinds of recipes. It was wonderful!

I did what everyone is saying not to do with this recipe...I added two cans of cream of chicken because that's all I had on hand (plus, I did not want to drag 4 children to the grocery store...haha). I also had crisp, crumbled bacon ready for when it was served. It came out pretty yummy!

Very good recipe.  Was super hard to mix, so next time I would mix the sour cream, soup & cheese together before mixing it in with the hasbrowns.  Flavor was very good though.

I rated it four stars because i still had to add additional seasonings to make it a five. and its just a reminder for me when I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN. I just had to add extras... Onions of course and garlic powder, salt and fresh ground pepper, for the man... Seriously what is wrong with the men these days and the amount of pepper they require!

I thought this recipe was great and will definately make again because it was very simple. However, the recipe says 1 package of frozen hashbrowns. It should mention that the hashbrowns should be thawed first. I went to make the recipe and when I went to dump in the hashbrowns they were all stuck together. I ended up having to cook them to get them seperated, so I could stir all the ingredients together. Also, I used lowfat sour cream and lowfat cheese to reduce some fat/calories. I only used 1 cup o fthe parmesan cheese and found that to be more than enough, the recipe came out great.

This is great.  I cut the recipes in 1/2 and baked in a square 8 X 8 pan.  Definatly worth using the cream of potato soup.  I made exactly as written.  Next time Im going to add in some onions and green chiles.

Very good, made it with thawed tator tots (which was a little salty). I'll try it next time with regular hashbrowns.

This tasted great, was easy to make, and you didn't have to change a thing. It makes it way less confusing and overwhelming when you have reviews saying you can just follow the recipe exactly and have a fantastic end result! Will be making again- thanks for the keeper!

Very good and a great comfort food!  I used cream of chicken soup and it tasted wonderful.  Next time, I plan to try sausage or bacon instead of ham for a change.  Thanks PooBoo for a yummy recipe!

Mmmmm, good! The only thing I changed was to add more ham. I probably cut up about 1/2 pound. We both enjoyed this very much. Had lots of leftovers and they reheated very nicely in the microwave. Will be doing this again! Thanks POOBOO!

I tend to shy away from recipes that have canned soup etc. as ingredients, but this one was really good. I added some chopped onion and freshly cracked black pepper - we thought it was great, very filling - nice comfort food. We'll definitely make it again. My husband loved it.

I made this recipe for Christmas breakfast this year and everyone LOVED it! I'm pretty sure it will now be the yearly ritual :) Even the picky eaters came back for seconds. It's great because it's so easy for the cook to make and tastes delicious! I recommend everyone to try this!

I am not a big egg lover and I was looking for a breakfast casserole that I could make for Christmas morning.  I found this recipe in 2009 and I really thought my kids would be upset becasue it did not have eggs in it but they LOVED it, in fact since 09 they have asked me to cook it every Christmas morning

This recipe is fabulous. I made a few minor changes after reading reviews. I added 1 diced red bell pepper and replaced the sharp cheddar cheese with mild cheddar. My only problem is that I can't stop eating it.

This is a great-different-breakfast casserole.  I used more ham than called for (I think the ham that I had was 16oz) but it was easy.  I put the casserole together the night before and put in the oven while pre-heating and cooked for the same time.

If I could give this 10 stars I would. I just made a double batch of this(have two events tomorrow involving food). Used Ore-Ida o'brian hashbrowns. Was so good I was actually eating it raw. Can't wait to try a few variations. Using sausage or keilbasa in place of ham. Want to try Italian sausage and mix seasoned bread crumbs in with the parm. AMMMMAZING!

I love how versatile this recipe is. The author makes it for breakfast but if you add a few veggies like peas, carrots and onions, you've got a great dinner casserole!!

We really liked this, my husband and 11yr old son both want me to make it again.  This was very simple to make.  I made this as written but did not add all the parmesan cheese because I was afraid it would be to salty.  I think next time I will use a ham that has more of a smokey flavor.  This time I just bought what was on sale.  This cooked much longer than an hour.  The recipe didnt say to defrost the hash browns so I just mixed them in frozen with the rest of the ingredients.  I can't wait to have the left overs for lunch tomorrow.

This was really good, even my picky kids liked it. I made a half batch, and used 2 cups of diced ham. Also added french fried onion rings in last 5 minutes of cooking.

I followed the recipe.  Because I was cooking for dinner, I used cubed/diced frozen potatoes.  I had a leftover ham, which I diced and probably put in more than 8 oz.  My family loved this dish!  The leftovers the next day were great!  My oldest son ate some for breakfast before school and my husband had some for lunch!  It's a winner!

This is now one of our favorite breakfast casseroles.  This is a great alternative to the traditional eggy breakfast casseroles.  I serve scrambled eggs on the side for those of us who like the eggs.

Freakin' amazing! Made this with simply 2 eggs over easy as a breakfast for dinner last night and it was a hit! Plan to incorporate this into our Xmas menu. It can easily be cut in half but note that I did double the meat. May sprinkle with some green onions as added color and flavor next time. SUPER YUM!

Very good! I purchased a ham steak some time ago (I was going to make a ham & potato chowder), but never got around to using it. While cleaning my freezer this weekend, I came across the ham I froze a couple months ago, so I decided to thaw it for this recipe. Although nearly perfect as is, I do think the ham / potato ratio was a bit off. You could easily double the ham and not have too much of it, IMHO. I pretty much followed POOBOO's directions to the letter except for halving everything (just serving my hubs and I) and subbing a 20 oz. bag of refrigerated Simply Potatoes brand diced potatoes with onions (I used 16 oz. worth of it) for frozen hash brown potatoes. Served with buttered corn and brown 'n serve dinner rolls on the side. If you're in need of a quick, inexpensive way to use up leftovers in your fridge, this is it. :) Thanks for sharing your recipe, POOBOO. I see myself making this for Easter brunch! :-)

A fair casserole.  I would not use but one can of the cream of potatoe soup and definitely add onion.  I have a better recipe that is the CrackerBarrel recipe that tastes better.  I will keep that one and just add some ham to it next time.

This is a great recipe, incredibly easy and delicious. It is heavy on the fat and calories, though, so I usually forgo the ham and add mushrooms and onions instead.

I have not met a person yet that doesn't love this casserole. I first made it for a board meeting for my work and when people were going back for thirds I knew it was a winner. I used only 1 can of cream of potato soup and added a can of cheddar cheese soup to amp up the cheese flavor, otherwise the recipe remained the same!

Soooo yummy!  This is not just a breakfast recipe.  I added more ham (we have a bunch of carnivores here) and cheese.  I also waited to put the Parmesan on until the last 15 minutes of baking so it would not burn or harden.  I also mashed cans of potatoes with milk and seasonings because we are gluten free family and can't have the canned soup...so I made my own! The family loved it.!

We have had better cheesy potato casserole's for brunch; however, I will consider adding ham to them now that I've had this one.
I did add crushed corn flakes to the top of the casserole before baking for a little crunch.

This was delicious! I made it one Sunday morning before church and my whole family ate it up! My brother didn't even get any because he was too slow getting to the kitchen. My sister begged for it all day long and was willing to do anything for it. I cut the recipe in half, but I cooked it at the same temp. for 30-35 minutes. Thanks for this recipe!

This was simple to make and tasted very rich. I didn't add nearly all of the sour cream, just a few big spoonfuls, or all of the cheese. I also added chopped onions and pepper for more flavor. Very good!

I was looking for cheesy potatoes to take to our family Christmas party and found this recipe. I made it tonight with some changes to suit my tastes. It was wonderful and got raves from my wife! :) I left out the ham, used 1 can cream of potato and 1 can of cream of chicken (I like the flavor it adds).

Let's see, I only used 8oz of sour cream and used a total of 3 cups of cheddar cheese and no Parmesan. I want to try the Parmesan next time. Our oven required 1.5 hours to cook through.

This is really good and SO easy to make. I love dishes like this, huge reward with hardly any work! I did everything as written, only I used about a cup of parmesan cheese, i thought 1.5 seemed like too much.

I have been making this once a week now,
It's awesome and simple. My whole picky family eats it.....
If I don't have cream of potato soup I se cream of mushroom, and cream of cheddar....With the cream of cheddar soup you don't need to add more then 1/2 cup of shredded cheese.....Recently I have not used ham, but bacon.....

Came out Fantastic!  I followed everything except I added : 2 (20oz each) shredded (thawed) potatoes, ½ red pepper diced, ½ green pepper diced, 1 medium diced onion, added ½ can of cream of mushroom and ½ can of condensed chicken (along w/ the 2 cans of condensed cream of potato), ½ tsp. of pepper, and a cup extra of cheddar cheese.  Not salty, and not over powered by the sour cream! Delicious!

I would have loved this recipe, if not for the overwhelming sour cream flavor. Next time I will cut the amount of sour cream in half.

My family loves this. I sometimes change up the soup and use cream of broccoli or cream of wild mushroom. It adds great flavor! I've also substituted sausages for the ham. Very versatile recipe!

My husband hates sour cream in everything si I didn't use any and it still turned out great. Also, I used cream of mushroom instead because it was all I had and everyone gobbled it up!

Husband made this using halved recipe in a 7 x 11 pan.  Pretty good but definitely needed more ham if using for a main course for people who expect a serving of meat in their portion.

I came across this last week and decided to make it over the weekend since I happeneded to have all the ingredients on hand.  My son had a last minute sleepover  and this came in handy with all the extra hungry teens.  There wasn't any left.  I substituted diced ham for black forest ham lunch meat. It was awesome. I will be making this a regular in my house for sunday brunch. I thought this would be great christmas morning since it can be made ahead.

Loved this.  Made half a recipe, and that was  plenty for the two of us for two days.  Just made it again, and split the half recipe into two containers, one to cook and one to freeze.

This was AMAZING! It was easy to make and very rich and creamy! I had to adjust the ingrediant amounts and cooking time due to the fact that we have no oven, so I bake things in a toaster oven. I did not add any ham and I mixed the parmesan in with everything else instead of sprinkling it on top. It didn't get soupy, or 'curdle'. I noticed in the reviews that a lot of people didn't care for the sour cream taste but I didn't find it overwhelming, perhaps because I really like sour cream. To get a nice cheesy crust on top I just broiled it for a few minutes after it had cooked through. We had the leftovers the next day and, as is usually the case, they were even better!

Super-easy to make and very tasty. Next time I might add some veggies and let it cook a little longer. I cooked an hour, but it seemed a little runny and didn't really get brown on the top. The flavor was great though and I'll make it again.

I luuuuv this recipe! Tip: Make it, freeze it and bake it when you want it. I hate waking up mornings to cook when family is over and this is a great way to be ready to serve 12 with very little work in the am! Do not change a thing (unless you want to add some onions, bell peppers, mushrooms ect). It's a perfect base recipe or great as it is.

I only gave this 4 stars even, though I loved it. My husband gave 2 stars and the little one with a hearty appetite took one bite and refused to eat. I guess if I make it again I better cut the recipe. Thanks for the Recipe!

I served this casserole at a MOPS meeting for the first time and it was a big hit.  The only thing I changed was instead of using 1 1/2 cups of Parmesan cheese I used 3/4 cup so it wasn't so salty.  Great recipe!

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch today along with two other dishes. I have to say that this recipe was my favorite out of the ones that I made! It's super simple to make, basically just dumping things out of packages, mixing them together, throwing them in a pan, and then putting them in the oven. And it turns out delicious! I made the recipe as-is and I can see even the pickiest eater out of the bunch gobbling it up. I definitely name this recipe a keeper and will probably make it again many times in the future!

FYI: When it says to use a "large bowl", it means it! I used my standard mixing bowl which I consider large, and it wasn't big enough. I kept flipping the hashbrowns out!

Made this recipe for Easter for the family.. followed exactly except the amount of ham, I added extra.  I thought it was really good and cheesy.  Im going to try another topping on it next time, maybe smashed up crackers and butter. I dont love ham, but I really liked this recipe, I think the only thing that may make it 5 stars is changing the topping. I received a lot of compliments on it.

Adding chopped onion, red and green peppers to this gives it what it is lacking. Saute veggies before adding. Make sure you bake for 1 hour at least, otherwise everything comes out undercooked. I am only giving this three because my husband and I thought it tasted soupy. And yes, we did use condense soup. I am also not a huge fan of the diced ham, I would have preferred it without just as a cheesy hash and veggie casserole. I am a meat eater, so I mean it when I say this.

Incredibly easy, amazingly delicious. Made this Superbowl Sunday and for a morning business meeting - every single inch was consumed both times. Thinking of using white cheese, onions, mushrooms, and sausage on the next go around.

This is HAMtastic!  I made half the recipe and put it in a 8x8" dish.  It turned out perfect!  I was worried about making this for breakfast without any eggs....but, the eggs were not needed.  This stands alone.  I used hash browns with diced peppers for color.  Maybe a dash of pepper when served is all I can recommend.

This recipe is seriously amazing. I make this dish as my "go to" casserole to bring to mom groups or other events. It is always a hit that everyone in the room is raving over. I'm serious. And everyone is asking for the recipe. The other reviewers are correct, I believe, when they say that the cream of potato is the secret ingredient that should not be altered. I agree. Also, the sour cream is a big part of the taste that otherwise you wouldn't even know it's there. But all the ingredients in this dish, though there are not many, do that magical thing in cooking, where they come together in the most perfect way. It happens here in this dish. And that's a nice thing when that happens. The ham is a great addition. In the video, they put the crumbled sort of parmesan cheese. I have never used that type in this dish. I use the pack of grated parmesan cheese which I think is a higher quality, like you would receive on top a dish in an Italian restaurant. But there is one thing I do that I think makes this dish even better.. I don't use the typical bag of frozen shredded hashbrowns. I use the Trader Joes  frozen Hash browns which are the type that come in little patties that you can pop in the toaster or bake in the oven and hold one in your hand. I use one and a half containers of that, which comes out to 32 ounces, as the recipe calls for. All I do is place the frozen hash brown patties/cakes onto a plate and microwave them for one minute. Then I put them on a cutting board and c

My daughter (10) really loved helping me with this one. I was kinda surprised there wasn't pepper added to the ingredients, we added it anyways. it wasn't cheesy or hammy enough fo my clan so next time I will add more and it was kinda not creamy enough either so I think I will add a little milk maybe 1/2 of a can just to soup it up a bit. I see people thought it was soupy and the only thing I can think of is they used the wrong soup. Over all this was super simple and after just having surgery it was perfect and I see all kinds of possiblities with this. Thank you so much for the recipe. It is kid friendly that is for sure. :)

I'm not a big hash brown casserole fan, but it was good. My company on the other hand LOVED it. Will definitely make again.

UPDATE: This has become one of our "go to" recipes for breakfasts when we have company overnight. It is a great accompanying egg bakes. We make this just as it is, over and over again and it never gets tiring

I am rating this recipe 3 stars for now.  I have not served it yet but I am excited to hear what everyone has to say.  I used a frozen bag of Potatoes O’Brien.  After I mixed everything together I realized it would have looked and probably tasted better if I browned the potatoes first.  I also added 2 pounds, yes I said 2 pounds of bacon.  I made this for my husband to take to work and he works with a bunch of men who are bacon lovers.  I used about 1.5 pounds of the bacon crumpled up in the mixture and used the remaining .5 pound of bacon to sprinkle on top of the casserole.  I also had 3 cups of cheese on hand so I threw all of that in.  I did not have shredded parmesan cheese so I used the cheap canned stuff.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as listed.  Overall this was a pretty simple recipe to throw together. I think my version needs to be renamed Heart Attack Casserole.  I hope the guys like it.  If I remember, I will update this once I get some feedback on how it tastes.

Really good! I found the cream of potato soup to be a little too much potato considering the 32oz bag of hash browns used. If you substitute for another cream base like cream of mushroom for example it still gives the creaminess and zip with a little more taste variety. When used for a dinner throw in your favorite veggies... I used chopped onion and peas. YUM!

My husband (who is by no means a cook) actually succeeded at this recipe! We found it just SLIGHTLY bland but nothing just a little dash of salt and pepper couldn't remedy. When and if I ever cook it I would maybe add some peppers to give it just a little zing. Also, the potatoes in the potato soup seemed to be a little overly crunchy. With a little "doctoring" we would def do this dish again - VERY easy!

I thought this was fine but nothing spectacular.  I wouldn't make it again as a breakfast dish.  It felt like more of a side dish that might go with dinner.  It wasn't as creamy as I thought either.  Overall, an okay casserole.

My daughter made this dish for mother's day brunch, it was great, tasty, creamy and everyone loved it even the kids.  I have made it several times since then, changing the ham for spicy sausages or bacon.  This has become my favorite brunch recipe.

I would cut the parmesan cheese down to about 1/2 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups. I omitted the ham since I didn't have it and still had requests for the recipe.

I have a very adventurous family.  They are always willing to at least TRY a new dish.  This time they were not so willing.  It came out soupy, a sickly white and lumpy.  It literally looked awful on the plate.  (I have teenage boys, you can imagine the comments.)   I couldn't find cream of potato soup, so I ended up using mushroom soup instead.  I also added a can each of corn and mushrooms.    Also, be forewarned, two cups of sour cream along with the condensed soup makes this RICH.  I gave this two stars because also it TASTED good it didn't look appetizing at all.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

My boyfriend loved this recipe.  It was a great way to use up the leftover Easter ham and didn't cost much at all!

I made this for the office and everyone liked it. I added chopped onion and a little salt & pepper to the mixture. I also put a bit of cheddar cheese on top under the grated parmesan cheese.

Very yummy!  I did replace the parmesan with shredded cheddar on top and I added a can of diced chilies, which really gave the casserole a little contrasting flavor, which was nice.  Thanks!

I made this for my family for dinner tonight to the tune of rave reviews!  Even my picky almost 3 year old ate it up!  I, however, was mixed on how I felt about it (hence the 4 stars).  On the pro side, it came together very quickly and easily, was very cheesy, and made enough to really feed up to 12 people.  Cons though, I just really felt like something was missing flavor wise...It just needed that extra "something."  Maybe next time I will add onions and peppers as others have suggested.  I also thought that for being in the oven an hour, it didn't seem hot enough...perhaps because of the frozen/cold ingredients.  I didn't think it was too salty as others thought, but I did reduce the amount of parmesan so that may have helped.  Like I said, the family loved this, but I do think heeding some of the other's advice might add a little extra needed flavor and really make this a mainstay recipe!

Wow yum! Thanks for sharing. This was a total hit with leftover Honeybaked Ham, which added sweetness, 1 can of cream of potato and 1 can of cream of mushroom, added 1/4c onion, fat free sour cream, and 4oz of diced jalapeno's from a can -- added some fresh sour cream and sliced avacado on top when serving -- to add that 'California' feel =)

I loved this receipe!  I made this for our Christmas morning brunch, super easy!  I had to use a different soup even though the other reviews said the cream of potato made the dish.  Two stores I went to were totally out of cream of potato so I had to use cream of chicken with herbs. (I never knew cream of potato was so popular). It was out of this world with the cream of chicken and herbs!  I did have to cook it about 5 minutes longer then the recipe suggested and I totally forgot the parmesan cheese.  It made no difference, this was excellent.  All you had to do is mix everthing in a bowl and bake it, simple and awesome! I am making this one again for sure.

Fantastic.  I doubled the recipe for Christmas breakfast today and put it in a roasting pan with the lid on it.  The store was out of frozen hash browns so I used the refridgerated ones.  Came out great.

Good as is, my family liked it on Christmas morning, but definitely needs to be kicked up a notch. I added sun dried tomatoes and garlic sauteed bell peppers. Next time I will add even more veggies, like mushrooms or zucchini. Some herbs or spices would be good too, paprika and thyme, maybe. The cream of potato soup and the hash browns are a great base. I doubled the amount of ham (I used canadian bacon because I like the texture) and added more cheddar, omitting the more expensive parmesan. Although the recipe doesn't indicate, the dish can be made the night before and brought to room temperature before baking.

Sooo good!!! Pretty easy to make, but kind of spendy if you don't have the ingredents on hand. Cost about $10 which isn't too bad to feed 12.   Brought it in to work and my co-workers gobbled it up!! It was creamy, cheesy, and I'm SO glad I tried it. Definately something to try!

Not the best I've ever had - but not bad.  Next time I'd use skim milk or 2% milk instead of the sour cream.  Just a little too thick and rich for me.

This was VERY GOOD and easy!!  I actually put mine in the crock pot and ran a few errands. It was delicious after 4 hours on low. I will make this again I think next time I will add a chopped onion.

I've made this at least 4 times.  I always use a can of cheddar and a can of potato soup when I make it as the others suggested. Also, the first time I made it, I crumbled freshly cooked bacon over it before baking. Oooh...so delicious.  Very unhealthy though...you definitely can't have this everyday. So I advise you to get it out of the house if you happen to have leftovers, which I doubt but can happen if you don't have a lot of people eating.  I had that situation once and regreted making it because I kept going back again and again to eat it..out of the fridge mind you. This is one recipe that you can't go wrong with. Thanks for posting!!

Defrosted the hasbrowns.  Added a diced & sauteed onion, a defrosted & squeezed block of spinach, and some freshly ground pepper.  Used light sour cream.  Delicious. My husband and 22month old loved it.  My 5 yr old did not but I expected as much. We ate it for dinner (and have enough for at least one more meal).  Thanks!

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Instead of cream of potato soup, I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom because that's what I had.  I also used a pound of cubed ham.  It was excellent!  It will definitely be a repeat recipe at my house!

I have never eaten better potatoes in my entire life. Really! I tweaked mine a bit to make it my own by adding some mushrooms, and lowering the Sour Cream to 8oz so that it wasnt too overwhelming. I also omitted the parmesan cheese and instead of ham we used Bacon flavored spam, which gave it a nice smokey flavor. But my gosh, this recipe is so amazing, my husband and I ate the whole mess of it in literally one day (breakfast, lunch and supper). I will definitely be making this again and again, and will be sharing your wonderful recipe with family! Kudos to you!

I made this twice. The first time I made it exactly as written, that's why it gets 3, maybe 4 stars. I thought it was missing a bit of depth and dynamic. For a 5 star recipe substitute one of the cans of potato soup for mushroom, add chopped onion, more ham (or ham and back bacon/peameal bacon since I had some left over from another recipe), and crumble some real bacon on top, make sure the bacon is fairly crispy first, then put on top for the last 10 minutes. I promise great results, and to wow your guests! Also, the second time, I made this the night before. Which made made it super easy in the morning to just pop it in the oven.

Like many of the reviewers, I made a few changes that are just a matter of taste.  I added onions to Southern style frozen hashbrowns & lightly browned them in olive oil with a bit of pepper.  I also fried about 16 ounces of diced ham before adding this to the potatoes.  I used one can of cream of onion & one can of cream of potato, however, I think next time I'll try just the potato.  I also topped the dish with a sprinkling of french fried onions.  This is a keeper & will be added to my cooking rotation.  It's filling & a great way to stretch your meat budget.  I served this with a Ramen Noodle Salad & it was a wonderful combination of flavors and textures.

I'd never used cream of potato soup and was a little hesitant to do so, but this dish turned out so yummy I'm glad I did!  I added some chopped onion, garlic, paprika, pepper, and cayenne (we like things with spice in our house!)  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Was gone in 10 minutes at Easter Sunday brunch. I only had hashbrowns with green and red peppers and onions in them, but I think the tastes worked rather well. Anyway it was a big hit, and would be perfect without my forced add-ins, too.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes.  I had a bed and breakfast for 8 years and this was the most requested recipe I had.  I made it without ham most of the time....its delicious.  I also halved the recipe and put it in an 8 x 8 inch pan and its perfect if you don't want to make such a big pan.  I loved the parmesan "crust"

It was ok.  I didn't like the cream of potato soup flavor.  I might try with just sour cream.

I enjoyed this, but I'm giving it 5 stars for my husband's reaction.  I made it for Christmas breakfast, and he had polished off the entire tray by the next afternoon.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  He has already asked me to make it again.

Very rich. I used Potatoes O'Brian like everyone suggested. It was good, don't get me wrong. I think next time I will crumble up bacon instead of using ham. It was so easy to make!

This was delish!  I didn't have any ham (my husband ate it without knowing I was saving it for this recipe!) so I used cooked bacon instead.  It was so creamy and wonderful, I plan on adding it to my brunch menu.  It would be really good with sausage in it, too.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great recipe, I have used it for a few years now, I make it every Christmas and Easter for brunch. I use the Obrien potatoes which have potatoes and onions in them to add a little more flavor. DELICIOUS!!!

I'd planned on making this recipe a month ago, but kept putting it off for no reason.  Tonight, I was in a HUGE hurry to make dinner.  All ingredients were on hand, so I literally threw them together in a bowl, tossed 'em into a prepared casserole dish, threw it in the oven and told my family when the timer went off in an hour, it would be ready.  I came home to rave reviews from the kids (oldest daughter declared it to be "OMG good") so I tried it myself.  Very yummy!  Very easy to make, and as soon as I'm done typing this review, I'm going to go back upstairs and have another bowl.  Next time I'll probably mix together the wet ingredients first just so it's easier to distribute evenly throughout, but this was good stuff no matter what.

This was an awesome recipe, (i made it for people at work so i made for 36-40 servings and only thing i did is add a little milk to my soup to make sure it stayed moist.)  i also sauteed mushrooms, onions with garlic and rosemary and thyme, for a little something extra, still very good!

I made this with turkey sausage instead of ham and it was very good.  I added extra cheese because I am a cheese lover.  Will make again.

Very delicious!  I prepared it a few hours a head of time and put it in the fridge before I cooked it, and it turned out great.  I did have to cook it 15 minutes longer than recommended, but that could just be my oven.  I will definitely make it again, very easy to make and everyone loved it.

I made this recipe for 120 people for a church dinner. It was very well recieved! I did alter it just a smidge, by doubling the amount of ham and using mushroom soup instead of potato. I served it with warm spicy applesauce and biscuits. I've already gotten requests to make it again next month. Definitely a keeper. Very yummy and good comfort food on a cold night.

The only changes I made were I added more ham, onions & black pepper because it sounded a little bland.  We did not like this--it was very blah.  Even my husband--who loves anything w/ potatoes, did not like it.  Sorry.

Good Stuff!  I used cream of mushroom, and I added some frozen veggies, and the french fried onions on top.  Very good.  My boyfriend loved it!  I couldn't help wondering how good it would be without all those veggies though.  But it forced me to eat the vegetables, when I otherwise wouldn't.  Will use this again and again.  Thank you!

Would add more cheddar cheese, otherwise great recipe.  Make sure if you use the parmesan (can make with or without- your preference), use the fresh grated in the cheese isle, not the Kraft.  Also per one reviewer, I added canned french fried onions to half of the casserole 5 minutes before was done- also delicious

This was great!  I made it for Christmas brunch and it was the only dish that was completely gone at the end of the meal.  I mixed it up the day before and left it in the fridge overnight and it still came out great. We did not find it too salty as some other reviewers did.  I made it exactly as directed except I might have used more ham that I had leftover.  This is a must have recipe!

I love this recipe!  I put bacon and summer sausage instead of ham and it is so good.  This is so easy to make on a Saturday night before company comes into town and then just throw it in the oven Sunday morning.  I highly recommend!

The first time that I made this, it didn't go over well due to the overpowering flavor of the Parmesan chesse.  I tried it again without any of the Parmesan cheese, and it was fantastic!  Everyone has said it was incredible!  I have added parsley, salt and pepper to flavor it a little bit.  Great dish!!!

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch and everybody loved it. Instead of using ham, I added 8 oz. of chopped onions. It turned out great.

My husband and I love this recipe!  He talks about it all the time.  I made some modifications.  I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom (Campbell's Low Sodium), an 8 oz 'no fat' sour cream instead of the 16 oz, and seasoned it with a little salt and tons of black pepper and garlic powder.  I omitted the ham and the parmesan cheese on top.  I may crush potato chips on it next time to give it some extra crunch.  I think Hormel's Real Bacon Bits would be good in it too.  I am going to try this out for Thanksgiving and Xmas to replace my mashed potatoes.

I think that this is a 4 star recipes but with changes is a 5. I only used 1 can of soup and think I could have reduced the amount of sour cream also. I used 1/2 tsp of salt and one tsp each of pepper and garlic powder. I first sauteed an onion in  butter and added this in. I used about 1/2 cup total of parmesan cheese on top. I covered the top with foil toward the end of baking to prevent the cheese from becoming hard. This could have had another 8oz package of diced ham easily. All in all, the family really liked this and it was a hit. I wouldn't hesitate to make this without the ham for a delicious side dish to a ham dinner.

I made this for our staff Christmas breakfast and it was gone before the line was. I made it the night before, poppe it in the oven when I was in the shower, put french fried onions on top for the last 10 minutes. Then I wrapped it in aluminum foil and it was still warm when I got to school 40 minutes later. I used the 32 oz. diced hashbrowns (frozen), 1 can cream of celery, 1 can cream of chicken with mushroom, almost the whole 16 oz. container of sour cream, 10 oz. shredded sharp cheddar (some of that went on top, I skipped the parmesean cheese and ham). Fun to hear people compliment it when they don't know that you made it! It was delicious!

This recipe is a huge hit and is requested very often.  I add a little salt, pepper, and diced onion to it for a little more flavor, and I usually wait to add the parmesan until 20 minutes before taking the casserole out of the oven.  Coworkers ask for it every time we have a breakfast potluck (which is very frequent).

Made this for company this morning and it was hit!  I left out the ham as I didn't have any. My husband commented that he thought it was bit too cheesy (is there such a thing as too much cheese? Nah..) I did throw in a handful of leftover chopped onion. Easy dish to experiment with and have fun!

Well, the 4 kids, ages 3 through 12, ATE it, but didn't want me to make it again.  It was too MUSHY!  And there was way too much sour cream.  Kind of expensive mistake.  I would modify by putting only one can of soup in and maybe a few tablespoons of sour cream.

I used yogert instead of sour cream, and cream of mashroom instead of cream of potato, it tastes just as good. My family loves it however I found it a bit salty..

I loved this. I had to scale it down because there were only two of us. I made the following changes: I used an 8.5 inch loaf pan, 4 hashbrowns, 1/2 cup ham, 1/2 can soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, 3/4 cup old cheddar, and just sprinkled the parmesan on top without measuring it. I used all low fat ingredients and I don't think it could have tasted better. Don't forget to thaw the hashbrowns before putting them in the bowl with all the other ingredients.

I thought this dish was a little bland the first time I made it so the second time I substituted a can of cream of celery soup for one of the cans of cream of potato soup.  It tastes great without the ham making it a great side dish for supper.  Thank you!!

I thought this recipe was great, but if you like onions, mushrooms, etc., definitely add them because it makes the dish even better. My husband who hates all the vegetables that I love likes this recipe just the way it is so I always make two, one for the vegetable lovers and one for the pickier eaters!

I made this with leftover Easter ham and it was yummmmmmmy! I couldn't get the family to eat it though, because they felt it was TOO rich, but I don't care...I want it all for myself anyway! Lol.  I topped it with French's onion rings, which added some crunch.  Next time I'll cut the recipe in half and make it just for me and my co-workers.  The family will have to have burgers!

Loved this breakfast dish! Could use some color from a variety of bell peppers (if you like bell peppers) or use those O'Brien hashbrowns. Still, taste was great and my boyfriend and I both agree this will be repeated!

This recipe was just what I'd been looking for.   It is easy to put together the night before and got raves from my five overnight guests when it appeared at the breakfast table.  Served with fresh fruit and toast.  I used 2 cups of chopped ham, hashbrown o'brien and baked the casserole an extra fifteen minutes.  Daughter asked for the recipe which is always a good sign. 
I'll be making it again

This recipe was very good although be warned - it's very rich!  I did make a few modifications.  I didn't have any Parmesan cheese so used Asiago cheese instead.  Also added some dried onion flakes, and a few shakes of Beau Monde seasoning and cracked black pepper.  My picky son had 3 helpings!  I will make this again the next time I have leftover ham.

We didn't like this recipe, however I did change it, so maybe that was why.  I used a can of cheddar soup with the potato soup as suggested and it was way to cheesy.  Also I used very crisp bacon, but it still came out limp.  I might make again using original recipe.

VERY good, Extremely easy, relatively inexpensive and makes plenty although I doubled the recipe for a family gathering and there wasn't a scrap left in the pan. Great for a potluck. I will DEFINETELY fix again and again. Could even leave out the ham and it would be great.  Thanks Melissa 
note: I have made this about 12 times now and am  always asked for the recipe by someone and I have never received anything but rave reviews.
THIS IS NOT FOR THE DIETER and I would say you should only eat this ocassionally.
I might suggest that if you have never made this before then start the first time you make it with low-fat or fat-free cheese and sour cream then you won't miss the extra flavor from the regular (with extra fat and calories). I am sure it would still be terrific ;)

Made this as a side dish on Christmas morning - I tried to halve the recipe to an 8x8 but forgot to halve the potatoes and it still turned out great!
TIP: I used Ore Ida's frozen Potatoes O'Brien, which are tiny cubed potatoes (vs. shredded) which has a little onion and green pepper already in the bag - adds flavor and saves chopping!  Great recipe.

This recipe was wonderful!  I made it for a party recently and it was gone in no time.  I did add 1 can potato soup and 1 can cheddar cheese soup and omitted the parmesan cheese...Very verstile recipe!  Thanks, looking forward to making it again for Xmas Eve dinner :)

Unbelieveably good.  First time I made this was for a group of Amish men who were replacing our roof.  They gobbled up the entire casserole - I've made it numerous times since then - ALWAYS to rave reviews!!  Thanks!

I don't like to cook at all, but when I have to I like it to be fairly simple but extremely impressive.  This was a tremendous success with my co-workers.  Everyone asked for the recipe and were extremely surprised that I had never cooked for them before, but voila!!!!

This was absolutely wonderful. I couldn't believe something so easy would taste so great. Just when I forgot to fix it for work(main dish) I got it ready and was barely late for work that morning. That how quick it was. Not only did my coworkers want the recipe but they ate it all except for the piece they saved for my begging husband who couldn't understand why I couldn't cut him a corner of that good smelling breasfast stuff prior to leaving for work. Thanks --------- A must keep !!!!!!!!!

Very quick and easy.  I was excited to find a recipe using hashbrowns, my family love them.  This casserole smelled wonderful baking but I have to say it was a bit bland, all of us thought so.  Also, this recipe made a huge amount of food, now I have leftovers from the leftovers!

I've prepared this recipe at least four times since finding it.  Every time I've made it, I've received rave reviews.  A great recipe for potlucks.  Can be baked in advance.  I sometimes use 1/2 French Onion Dip and 1/2 sour cream for an added kick. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!

Have been making since first seeing it on this site.  One thought: Use O'Brien frozen hashbrowns that have the onions and peppers.  Nice addition and so easy.  Wonderful, wonderful recipe.  Thank you.

Really delicious and insanely easy. I doubled the ham...OK, I have no idea how much ham I really put in. I just know it was more than the recipe called for. I also put it together the night before & kept it in the fridge and baked it this morning. I give it 5 sporks.

Made this basic recipe pretty much as is, to share with friends this weekend and we all loved it! My small changes were; about a cup more ham, sliced fresh mushrooms, chopped parsley, black pepper and Penzey's roasted garlic. I did not put as much cheese on the top as recipe calls for, but instead just sprinkled a little combo of shredded Parmesan and cheddar in the last 10 minutes of cooking.  It was cooked the night before, refrigerated over night and simply reheated it in the oven the next day and it turned out great. Have now frozen a small left over portion to see how that does. Thank you for this very delicious egg less recipe, it is definitely a keeper.

I needed to use up some ingredients that were taking up real estate in my fridge so I changed it up a bit to use them up. I had used part of my 30 oz. bag of hash browns so I probably only had about 20 oz. left. I left them to dry out in the fridge overnight the day before I used them. I used regular slices of ham (off a real ham) and chunked them  up and sauteed them to get a bit of color. I put the ham and the fat into the potato dish. I added about a tsp.  each of garlic and onion powder, and I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken soup instead of cream of potato. I added an entire bag of red/green bell peppers and onions, salt and pepper to taste. I was a little short on the sour cream- probably only about 10 oz. left. Finally, I was out of parm and cheddar but I did have half a brick of Velveeta to use up so I melted that  with a little half and half and butter and added that. I topped off with some homemade Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and a bit of olive oil and it turned out creamy and rich and really yummy!

Nice flavor, resisted the urge to add corn to the mix and make it according to the recipe first time out... I didn't expect the hash browns to cook up to a mash potato consistency. Maybe I'll try diced potatoes next time.Thanks for sharing. :-)

We made 2 small changes. 1. We cooked in a Dutch oven at a Boy Scout gathering. 2. We used O'Brian hash browns. Everyone loved it. We might add a can of green chilies next time for a little flavor kick.

This was okay, not bad at all but not great like some of the other recipes I have found on here. I think I was missing a crunch with the casserole, but honestly not positive. I did add peppers to the casserole and some extra meat but I think that if I added bacon that may do it or possibly some bread crumbs like some reviewers suggested. Hmmm will have to experiment.

Made this for our monthly clubhouse breakfast.  There are at least 35 people there.  I made two large pans and there was none left.  Followed the recipe all the way.  It was very good

Love this recipe. Have cooked twice for the family and they can't get enough. I think I only got one helping, because they ate it all the next day. The second time I added real bacon bits with the diced ham and it really made a great difference. Try this, you won't be disappointed.

Pretty good but it needs some texture like a crunchy topping. Made as directed except added a small chopped onion.

I made this exactly as written and it was WONDERFUL.  I served it with for dinner with fresh English peas. Unfortunately, my husband wants to add this to the "do not make again" list because he loved it so much that he ate too much. This is a rich dish so serve with a salad or a light veggie side. The leftovers, if there are any, are great for lunches the next day. I will make this again.

I made this exactly as written and found it to be kinda bland. My husband liked it. I took it to a potluck and people didn't want it once they knew there was sour cream in it. Weird. It was very creamy even after baking for an hour. Super easy to assemble. I don't think I'll make this again.

It was VERY rich. I would recommend to use low fat dairy products. I followed the recipe to the T but used full fat dairy as I usually do but this was just WAY too rich.

Oh wow!! This recipe is amazing! Followed it almost as directed but used a bigger pan (11x15). Made it today (actually my 12 year old twins did with some direction) and OMG!! we didn't have ham so we used bacon andams instead of cheddar used Colby jack, it was perfect! Will be making it again possibly on a weekly basis! Thank you!!

I followed the recipe just as it is, very good I am making this for my big family next time and the kids love this dish so cheesy and flavorful I wouldn't change  it, it's very good the way it is and I like to add on the side with bacon and eggs.

I replaced the potato soup cans with cheddar soup cans instead for a more cheesy taste. And at my supermarket, they only had the "patty" hash-browns. I just cut them up in smaller pieces and mixed it in with like the recipe suggested. Everyone loved it. I now invite the boys over for sunday breakfast and always prepare this dish. It is easy to make, delicious, original and filling!

So easy because I was in a pinch and just had leftover ham to start with. I had a container of onion chip dip (no sour cream)and 1/2 cup of cup of cottage cheese and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also threw in a cup of leftover chopped cooked broccoli and added bread crumbs for the top.  It was amazing and quick for dinner.  I just finished using the leftovers for some lovely crisp potato pancakes...not a bit of this went to waste!

This is good heated up to take to work for breakfast in the morning. It lasted us a couple of days after we ate the first time and it was just as good or better the next couple days. I have made it with breakfast sausage and bacon as well. Great recipe

At 74, I cannot eat like I did at 24 or even at 54. And I'm cooking for just one. I cut this recipe in half. Added chopped parsley, diced onion and garlic. It was supposed to be six servings. I ate one serving and had two servings to freeze. Don't know how well it will freeze but it should be OK. Could have added frozen peas or jalapenos.

Made this dish for a large pot-luck party because it seemed easy.  It was probably one of the easiest recipes ever.  I know the directions say to eat right away, but the nature of the pot-luck (came at the end of an awards ceremony), we had to wait almost an hour before eating.  I doubled the recipe, so it was huge.  It was gone in a flash.  Most people were coming up to me and telling that it smelled so good it was hard to wait until the ceremony was over.  It was a big hit!

My family really enjoyed this! The only changes I made was I used 1 can of cream of potato soup and one can of cream of mushroom soup (because we love the mushroom soup). I will continue to make it this way. I also used shredded parm rather than grated. Oh I also used a bag and a half of frozen hashbrowns, since my hashbrowns come in 28 oz rather than 32oz. I thought a little extra would be good, and it was. Excellent and will make again!

Decided to take a chance and make this for an office event based solely on the reviews here. I can't eat gluten so couldn't even taste it ahead of time for proper seasoning. It was a huge hit! Everyone kept looking for more, but unfortunately I'd only made two trays of it. Thanks for a great recipe!

The changes I made: Doubled the recipe, and doubled the ham on top of that. Added yellow pepper,  onion, garlic, and pepper.

Very easy. Was a little bland, but I did not use the Parmesan - that might add the zip we were missing with this dish.

Agree-the cream of potato soup is a must.  I also sautéed a diced onion with the ham to release ham juices so the end product was not runny.  I topped with a few crumbled Townhouse crackers unstead if parm -not too rich or salty.

I tried this for Christmas brunch with my family. They loved it! I had no left overs and a couple requests to make more. I did do a couple of things different. I made homemade hashbrowns and I had cooked a whole ham so I used some of it as well. I also did not top with any more cheese. It had so much I did not want to add more.

I use bacon instead of ham, but other that that I make it as directed. This is excellent and a very easy Holliday breakfast. This has a lot of calories but sooo worth it. Lol

I made this for Christmas brunch a couple years ago, and every year now this dish is specifically requested.  This Christmas is no different.  Absolutely love it! I make it without the ham, and use it as a side dish. Still amazingly yummy. Thank you for the recipe.  Merry Christmas to the all recipe family.

WOW!  My 13 year old made this for his big brothers when they came home from college. What a hit.  He added mild green chiles and garlic. When it was done he topped it with fresh green onions.  He did use low sodium potato soup and shredded parmesan, not grated.  I cut the left overs into squares then froze them for a quick breakfast for the kids.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is soooo good! I like to use the ore ida shredded hashbrowns with onions and peppers as it adds great flavor however I have also made it with plain ore ida hashbrowns and I love it either way. Awesome recipe!

Tried this recipe last evening I cut the recipe in half and added some diced onions also used less Parmesan, great. I have leftovers for two.It has a lovely creamy texture I didn't expect. It was a hit with all and I definitely will make it again. Next time I 'll try it with diced cooked chicken.
   Definitely recommend this easy to make dish

Made as directed but threw some pre-made bacon bits in as well. It was good....I think next time I will leave the Parmesean cheese off the top and add more cheese. very creamy and had a good taste, just need to reduce a little salt that way.

This recipe was amazing.  I made 1/2 the serving and it was delis.  Hubby and 2 kids loved and we will be having left overs for dinner.  I did and onion powder and white and yellow cheese to the mixture.  I was nervous to try cream of potatoe because I've never had it before but it was so good.  Def making again.

I think I've made this before but I changed it a little this time. 
I used 3 cans of potatoe soup, 1/2 can of milk, also an extra 8oz of cubed ham,  added 1/2 cup mild cheddar cheese and added a little garlic salt, and parsley. Topped with Italian bread crumbs.  I suggest placing a cookie sheet underneath it to catch any spillover and it also will help keep the bottom from burning. My wife and I love this as do our 5 children. It also works good wrapped in a tortilla.

I've had this recipe in my family for years! We love it so much! To make it a bit lighter though, use light sour cream. And to mix it up, try cream of mushroom soup rather than cream of potato! Also, my brother lose to put ketchup on his.... He loves it, though I've never tried it!

I changed it up a bit. I had 4 leftover baked potatoes and used those with just one can of cream of mushroom soup (I didn't have potato), 8 oz of fat free sour cream and I added brown sugar and stone ground mustard.  I also used velvetta sharp cheddar.  It was really good.  A keeper!

Delicious!  Used diced potatoes instead of hash browns and forgot the parmesan, but otherwise, made no other changes.  A really good recipe.  Next time I will add crumbled bacon and perhaps serve with a fried egg on top.

My family loved this.  I made it with sausage instead of ham, and cream of mushroom soup instead of potato.  Excellent.

I've made this recipe several time but today I changed it up a bit.  I sautéed onion, bell peppers, and ham together until lightly brown and added it the mixture. It was a huge hit. I even tripled the recipe for a Senior Class Breakfast today and those kids loved it.

This is so good. Even my hubby liked it. And he hates sour cream. Everyone else loved it. I will be making it again.

I made this for a brunch and my friends loved it. Then I brought it for a work party and it was gone in 10 minutes. Super easy to make and so cheesy and yummy right out of the oven. I would recommend adding a little bit of salt and pepper. Next time I'll add green peppers and onions and see how that goes. Makes an excellent dish at a buffet.

Great breakfast casserole that is simple to execute, fabulous tasting and brings many compliments(and requests for recipe). It is not a healthy recipe and I was tempted to buy healthier alternative ingredients but decided to keep recipe as is...just don't try to figure out weight watcher points w/ this one;)

Made this for a brunch at church and it was a huge hit. People kept bragging about how good it was. They couldn't believe that it was so easy. I also left off the Parmesan cheese and added more cheddar.

I have made this dish twice and it is soooooo good. Boyfriend noted that it is a salty dish so we always have toast w/ jelly so the sweetness counter acts the salty. All in all really good, and easy to make.

Easy to prepare. I made using the recipe without changes. I cooked almost two hours for the bubbling and golden crust to appear. I will make again by using this as a good base breakfast casserole.

Nice Easy meal. I used southern hash browns defrosted
in microwave.
 
used a little less sour cream
because it was all i had, 1 large family size can
campbells condensed cream of potato soup. 2 cups of
mild cheddar/montery jack cheese. 3/4 cup of parmesan
and 1/2 cup bread crumbs mixed for topping. baked for 
1 hr and 15 minutes,
comfort food Yum!

This was great!  You can mix it up too and do chicken and green chilis or anything else you can come up with.  I used Pacifica brand "organic cream of mushroom soup" and it came out beautifully.  There is a little more soup in those containers than a Campbell's soup can, but the extra moisture did not matter.  I did add more ham than it called for to make it heartier.  My daughter who does not like ham, loved this so I am making it for a second time in 5 days:)

Delish!!! Made thIs recipe as is but topped it with cheese too and it turned out great, my opinion: you can never have too much cheese to a casserole like this. Made it for a breakfast potluck for work and everyone loved it. Had receipe requests also another request to make it for our next potluck.

I made this dish for a holiday brunch and it was a hit.  I used everything the recipe called for, however, I left off the Parm cheese. Prior to making the dish I put a little of the mix with the Parm cheese in the oven and didn't like the taste.  So I just used cheddar and it was delicious.

I make this every year for Bosses Day at the law firm I work for (so you know it has to be good because they're picky).  Every year it is almost GONE by the time the staff gets to eat!  It tastes AWESOME!  Plus, I am the world's laziest cook - the easier, the BETTER.  It literally takes 10 minutes to chuck everything in the bowl, a couple of minutes to mash it all together, and then just an hour to bake.  Gourmet on the run!  Absolutely the best hashbrown casserole recipe I've ever tried!

We made this recipe for dinner one night. Who doesn't love breakfast for dinner?  We liked the overall taste, but we found it very rich. I think it was the combination of potato soup and sour cream with no liquid to cut the heaviness. I think people who reviewed they  added onions, pepper, mushrooms and other veggies have it spot on. This recipe needs something to make it less rich. We will certainly try again because the overall taste was very tasty! Plus, it was such a simple, throw together meal after a long day of work!

I made this to serve when my siblings were over for breakfast. My only change was to top with more cheddar instead of parmesan due to some other reviews. I think next time, I will add some cayenne and some chopped green chilies just to give it some heat. Very good to eat the leftovers late that night!

Thank you!  I have a super picky husband, but this dish went over very well.  We were chopping clover the day I made it and had to deliver lunch to all of the guys.  Word about the dish got around before I did!  One improvisation that I made was that I had lots of leftover pulled pork.  I substituted that for the ham, and everyone loved it!  Oh, and because we are dairy farmers, I added about 2 extra cups of cheese!  This dish was also really easy to make, so this is definitely a keeper!

Fantastic and very easy to make! Live in NZ and couldn't find the cream potato soup. I used potato and leak soup instead...very nice. I also added 3 eggs.

Delicious & easy! I would've given this a 5, but here's my issue... My hash browns still aren't cooked through (its in the oven as I type) & it's been an hour and 15 minutes. I took it out to taste it @ 1 hr & the flavor was great! I followed the recipe except I omitted parmasean and topped with mozzarella instead, except my potatoes were kind of raw so I put it back in the oven. I thought about thawing the potatoes prior to making but thought surely this step would've been included if it was necessary. So, delicious but be aware if you are in a time crunch such as myself - the parent teacher brunch will have to wait!

This is a great tasting, super quick recipe that can be made in a few minutes. Great for a Sunday School or pot luck event. It received excellent reviews. Will make again and do note that for a family there is a ton of servings if treated as a side dish instead of a main dish. Only modification I want to try is cream cheese instead of sour cream. Price alert! The ingredients for this cost me $18. Here's why; used only premium brands and of course, no generics or store brands. The ham was around $8 for an 8-9 ounce ham steak. Parmesan cheese, not the stuff in the green plastic jar, was a bit pricey.

Makes way more than I expected, but it was delicious. Next time I will add a little more flavor like caramelized onions and peppers. This recipes was lightening fast to assemble and then the oven does the rest, I loved that.

Best. Recipe. Ever.  I made nearly as written.  I used southern style (the square cut) potatoes and used Mexican blend cheese because it is what I had on hand.  Other than that, I used the cream of potato soups, the diced ham, and the sour cream.  I did forget the parm cheese until after I had baked it but I did top it afterward.   I am not sure it mattered though!

I made this for a church breakfast and everyone loved it.  I used two 20 ounce packages of shredded potatoes (which I had on hand) and kept all the other amounts the same.  It was still creamy and not at all dry. I did use cream of onion and cream of celery instead of potato soup and the flavor was very good.  I also added some parm into the mix, as well as on top, but no where near the amount called for.  Very easy to make and not too expensive, this will be a go to recipe for everyday and for special events too.

This is a very easy recipe. I added red peppers flakes and chopped onions and used the Southern style hash browns. I did not have enough sour cream so I added plain Greek yogurt. I also added more ham. I split the recipe into to pans; eating one and freezing the other after it was baked. It was very moist. This is a great recipe for large groups and can be made in advance to free up your time. I will make this again.

AMAZING! I used shredded Romano cheese as that is what I had in place of the Parmesan.  Fed 10 people at the lake breakfast! So much easier than standing over the stove to cook breakfast for an hour.  Mix in one bowl and bake in another.  This will be a new standard for us!

Although I used a bit more ham and cojack instead of cheddar and also omitted the parmesan, my family demolished this dish.  We ate it for brinner (breakfast at dinner), and it will definitely be made many more times.

Very good and simple casserole. If using Southern-style hashbowns, defrost them in the microwave before baking otherwise they will still be hard after an hour of cooking.

I made this recipe for a group of March Madness basketball watching men.  They licked the pan clean!  The only change I made to the recipe was to add an entire 12 oz. ham steak that I diced up.  It was a huge hit.

I made this for a Women's Club meeting last week and everyone seemed to like it a lot.  In fact, I was asked to share the recipe.  It is so creamy and tastes just as great as it smells.  I made it just as it was and didn't change anything.   YUMMMMMM

I don't generally like it when people review, and say that they didn't follow the recipe, but here I am... doing exactly that. I'm single, so I didn't need a huge breakfast casserole, so I modified. I didn't have sour cream, and wanted to increase the protein, so I swapped it out for about half a carton of egg beaters. I also used cream of celery instead of cream of potato. AND I baked it in a mini-muffin tin instead of a casserole, so it'll be easy for weekday mornings. I forgot about the Parmesan cheese, but used about 2-3 cups of a cheddar/jack blend.

This is a definate keeper....I had to cook mine a little longer that given. But that could just be my oven. I added green onions and 16ounces of ham instead of 8. Perfecto!!!! Do not make any changes to the recipe It is wonderful as written. It literally only takes minutes to throw together.

This recipe is simply to die for.  I read some of the reviews and improvised a little (added red onions, green peppers, colby and monterey jack cheese, mushrooms, and cream of mushroom soup).  I am taking some to my co-workers on tomorrow because I am so pleased with the results.

Made this over New Year's for a family gathering and it got rave reviews.  My dad went back for seconds and thirds!  Paired it with some scrambled eggs and topped it with a bit of tabasco.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was fine.  It really didn't have a ton of flavor.  Just too creamy, and turned out mush.  No one raved, and it took much longer too cook than expected.  Next time, maybe I'll add onion or peppers.  Something to make it not so one-dimensional.

This was very good - Sharp Cheddar Cheese is a must for bringing out the "cheese" flavor - unfortunately...our frozen hash browns come in only 28oz bags...I went with that and found it really needed those additional 4oz - Nonetheless...I'll be making this again !!

Wicked Yummy... I made this Christmas morning, along with some French Toast, this was gone first. Since then my husband has me make this all the time. Recently I have been making this with bacon and my kids go nuts over it.

This is so good.  Made it as a side dish for a steak dinner.  I used both ham and bacon and I also added onion that I fried to soften. This has a really nice flavor and was something different as a side.  Thanks for sharing.

I usually have to make a main dish for church, and this dish goes faster than quick. I don't have left overs to bring home.  Depending on what I want to taste that day, I modify the recipe to give it a little kick: exchange 1 can of mushroom for can of cream of onion.  I have added green and red bell peppers.  If I don't have ham I've used sausage or gone with out.   I think it's the cheese that does the trick.  I add just a little more.  Also, if I don't have enough sour cream, I've added heavy whipping cream.  Either way, this dish seems to go before all the other dishes. I've had people ask me for the recipe.  It's so easy to prepare. Thanks for sharing.

I just finished making this recipe.  It's easy and delicious.  Looking at earlier reviews, common concerns were saltiness and lack of robust flavor.  I decreased the Parmesan cheese to 1/2 cup, used honey glazed ham increasing to 1 pound and added 2 teaspoons of Penzey's Cajun seasoning.  My husband has just finished his 2nd helping.

Started with the basic recipe and tweaked.  Added red peppers, scallions, baby bellas, Mrs. Dash and Jane's Mixed up Salt.  Baked for the recommended amount of time and did not cover. Used faux Canadian bacon instead of ham.

This is a wonderful recipe - Everyone I've made it for just loves it. I have begun a tradition of making it when we are up in the mountains at our cabin - makes the whole place smell so good!!

I do have my own little twist to this recipe to make it a bit more savory/smokey - I add chopped yellow onion (about 1 cup) and a little crumbled bacon in addition to the ham.  I also allow the mixture sit overnight before baking so that the flavors have time to really blend and saturate.  In the past I've also added a tiny bit of liquid smoke, which works well too.

So fast and easy that i had it fully assembled by the time the oven was done preheating, which is a first for me!

I halved the soup, sour cream and cheddar jack  cheese. I used one thick slice of Nueske's ham from the deli, with the weird parts cut out. I used about a half of a bag of potatoes o'briens. After mixing everything together, I put in greased, square casserole dish. I sprinkled parm on top (not any particular amount) and then sprinkled additional cheddar jack on top of that. Yum! And the husband enjoyed it too!

I doubled the amount of ham and it was one of my favorite recipes I have ever made.   So incredibly easy to throw together and it tasted so good.  Very inexpensive also.

This is one of my favorites!  I use shaved ham from the deli and chop it up.  Similarly, I put Frosted Flakes on the casserole about the last 15 minutes of cooking.  My entire family thoroughly enjoys this recipe!

Good, but not very nutritious. If you're going to splurge and eat breakfast casserole, at least put some egg and veggies in it.

There was too much of the creamy potato soup taste. I had even added some onions and some green chilies and it still was just too much. I suggest not using grated parm cheese you should you shredded parm cheese.

This was great, I didn't change anything...I loved that all you had to do was mix it all together then bake.  Too to small group and it was gone. Will be making this again.

Just had this last weekend for 12 people, everyone loved it.  I added some jalepeno and orange bell pepper to half to spice things up.  I will make again.

Delicious!  Made exactly as written, but I think you could use any breakfast meat you have on hand.  The only thing I'd do different next time is add pepper.

Used swiss cheese instead of cheddar and was excellent.  Made for Jake's confirmation.

As always, I make a recipe exactly as the person submitting it states. That said, when I make this again I will add more ham or a little cooked and chopped bacon. But will omit the parmesan cheese. It overwhelmed the other ingredients.  Can't be too bad though...I brought home an empty casserole dish!!  :D

This was really good, but I did do a few adjustments. I added one fresh diced jalapeño, and used fresh Parmesan cheese. I didn't cook it at 350 because the bottom started to burn, so I turned it down to 340 and it turned out perfect! Thanks for this delish recipe. Took it to a potluck and it was gone. Next time, I might add some green onions for more color and flavor.

This is delicious as written!  It's quite salty, so I'll use reduced sodium soup next time.  Sauteed onions and fresh ground pepper would go very nice in this dish as well.

This is very good, just needs a little more flavor. I think exchanging one can of potato for cream of mushroom taste great, and it needs onion. Very easy and everyone loves it.

This was simply delicious!  And it was soo quick.  Quick, easy and hearty is a very good thing around my house.  This is the second time I've made this and it went over just as well as the first time which is very hard to achieve with my kids.  Typically, at least one of them doesn't like whatever recipe I'm making that night.  But with this, it's a win win ALL the way around.  I just know this is going to turn into a family favorite! :D

This recipe is excellent, tasty and rich. I have made it exactly as is and with homemade hash brown potatoes, cooked cubed taters, sliced taters, etc. It always came out wonderful! My children are not fans of sour cream but loved this for dinner!

The Parmesan cheese made it griddy and overpowering. Not enough ham or any meat for that matter. Makes a good base for a more deluexe main dish.

This is the perfect recipe!  I often make this as a hashbrown side dish without the meat.  Everyone asks for the recipe!  I added sauted onion and I used one can of cream of potato and one can of cream of chicken soup. I also did not use the parmesan cheese.  Sooooo great!

The taste was very good.  The smell, up until I put the parm on for the last 15 minutes or so, was very good.  The smell while the parm was melting?  Not so great.  But it was easy to make (the only thing I did differently other than put the parm on at the end was use refrigerated hash browns instead of frozen and deli ham chopped up because that was all I had) and well received.

Very good. My family absolutely love this. We had it for dinner, and everyone went back for second. I used shredded hash brown instead of the cube and it was perfect.

This was a wonderful recipe.   I honestly thought just reading it, it sounded kind of bland and probably would not have even tried it were it not for the reviews.  So glad I tried it.  I used "Simply Potatoes", refrigerated hash browns rather than frozen.  I used the Southwest style with some peppers and onions in it.  I doubled the ham as I thought only 8 oz of ham for a 9x13 pan was kinda slim.  Only other change was I baked for 45 minutes before adding the Parmesan.  Had I put it on before baking, it would have burnt to a crisp.  15 minutes in the oven is plenty for the Parmesan.

I hate it when people totally change the recipe then rate it, that being said, I have learned to substitute from this site and usually it turns out good.  Made this recipe last minute this morning, subbed cottage cheese for 2/3 of the sour cream and used 1 can each of potato soup and cream of chicken.  Also forgot to put the cheese in it so through it on top.  It was still awesome and ate up by 4 teenage boys.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is always a hit!!! I use any cheese I have on hand (have used co-jack, mild cheddar, velveeta) and it's still awesome. I will purchase a large ham when it's on sale and dice up part of it and freeze it. That way I have a quick prep meal since there are few ingredients and comes together quickly. I do like to cook it for a little longer than recipe calls for to give it a crispy edging. All together, AWESOME! Highly recommended.

I made this recipe for my MOPS group and everyone loved it!!! I made a few adjustments by using Cream of Mushroom soup as well as Cream of Potato to add it more flavor.  I also used bacon instead of ham and I added green onion and bell pepper.  This recipe is a keeper and will probably become a staple in this house and my MOPS group!

I just made this for dinner tonight. Although very quick and easy, I have to say this was entirely too rich due to the combination of cream of potato, sour cream, and cheddar cheese.

This was a big hit at our last family gathering. I did add some onions and green pepper and a can of diced chiles after reading some of the reviews and I definitely think those made it outstanding instead of just great. This will be a stand by for us from now on!

A huge hit.  I wasn't sure if the recipe called for the shredded or cubed hash browns, and I had the shredded on hand so that's what I used.  Followed the recipe exactly, except for the addition of a little black pepper and reducing the amount of grated Parm on top.  My husband and sons LOVED this and it's going into the rotation.  Good served with a green salad and some fruit.

Very tasty recipe!  Since I was only cooking for 3 I trimmed the recipe down by half, and I didn't have a full cup of sour cream, but regardless it was DELICOUS!  Pretty rich though.  I think I'll make this on special occasions for family and such.  But it's easy to prepare, has a great taste, and keeps you full until lunch/dinner!

Brought this in for a work brunch and it was the first and only thing to disappear.  I heard comments like 'this is the best thing I have ever eaten' and "you are such a great cook" to 'I have to have this recipe".  It was so good!  I will be making this again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe. :)

This meal got rave reviews at my Christmas party brunch, every person there went back for seconds or thirds! The only thing I did different was I added 4-5 eggs to the mixture. Next time I think I'm going to substitute the two cans of cream of potato soup for a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of broccoli. Regardless, there were no complaints!

We love this creamy breakfast casserole.  I have made it for multiple meals and used for a few entertaining brunches.  It's an easy favorite with everyone and keeps well for leftovers.

Made the casserole this morning (Thanksgiving Day) for the first time. I usually don't serve guests an "experimental" recipe, but this one sounded good and had good reviews so I bit the bullet and made it. AWESOME!!! Made a couple of small changes: used light sour cream, added black pepper and a dash of red pepper when mixing. Greased baking dish with butter. This one is a keeper.... guests are asking for the recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This is my absolute favorite breakfast casserole ever. I don't add meat becuase I'm vegetarian, but otherwise make it 'as is' and it's delicious :)  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Delicious. Used refrigerated hash browns instead of frozen. Used 2 8x8 dishes. Baked one and froze the other. Perfect with scrambled eggs and toast.

I made this quick and easy casserole for a sunday brunch and it was delicious.  The condensed cream of potato soup really helps to elevate the dish.  I did however, cut back on the parmesan cheese, and replace with an extra handful of cheddar cheese.  Yum!

"This is excellent!" Was my husbands only comment.  I followed the recipe exactly, but in the end I added more ham (3 cups total) as I had so much leftover from a spiral ham.....great way to use up leftover ham.  Thanks.

Yum!  What a great recipe for leftover ham!  I made as written, but using low-fat versions (low-fat sour cream and cheddar cheese).  Maybe a tad bit salty, do they make low-sodium cream of potato soup?  Couldn't find it in local stores...

Really easy to make, and love that you toss it in the oven for an hour and youre free to do other stuff.  I would have given a full 5 stars, but a little on the salty side for me.  Trying to decide how to modify taste slightly...will experiment.  Over all, decent treat!

Absolutely delicious and easy to make but did anyone else have problem's with their potatoes not being done enough? I have tried diced potatoes and shredded.  The shredded takes the cake as they are more done after the casserole is cooked.  The recipe calls for "frozen potatoes" however I think they should be thawed first.

Thank you for the receipie it was very good and easy, everyone loved it. It is great as it is and will make again. My husband suggested trying bacon, so for a get together I used the Mexican cheese blend and the hormel real bacon pieces and it ws very good also. Still reciepie is great as it is and also gives room to change up. I do not like when someone gives a review and it changes the whole thing, that is their own recipie. I loved that it did not have eggs in it.

I tried this recipe and while it wasn't bad or horrible, I definitely felt like I had wasted my ingredients. I feel the sour cream hurt his dish and gave it an overly bitter taste, to be honest, I'm not sure why it's even in the dish at all.

Made this tonight.... was not impressed. It wasn't terrible, but I didn't care for the frozen hashbrowns. It seemed like it needed to be cooked longer, but the top was BROWN, so it would have burned if cooked longer than 1 hr unless covered. To much sour cream flavor.

This is now my go-to cheesy potato recipe! I get rave reviews every time I make it for potlucks. I don't add the ham when using as a side dish, otherwise I don't change a thing. I also use the southern hash browns (small squares). I don't know why I didn't think to use cream of potato soup for a potato casserole before. Seems so obvious. And the Parmesan cheese is a nice addition. Delicious and easy... you HAVE to make this!!!

I have made this for years with mushroom soup but will try the potato soup. I have also used nacho cheddar or plain cheddar soup, very versatile!

This was OK. I didn’t have cream of potato soup so I used cream of mushroom. With all the cheese I had grease on top of my dish which I didn’t like! I didn’t grease my dish! So it was from all the cheeses. I don’t think I will make this again, I have similar recipes that I like better.

really yummy! Of course I can never follow a recipe, I will definitly make this again. I used the diced potatoes instead of hash browns. I sauteed the diced ham with some onion, diced celery, and minced garlic (I love garlic, I put it in just about everything!) I added that to broccoli and cheese soup and cream of potato soup with the sour cream, and added some chopped broccoli. Of course lots of cheese, and then I also added some french fried onions to give it some crunch on the top. My boyfriend and roomate loved it, especially with some siracha on top! Thank you all recipies!

I made this as a side dish without the ham...turned out great and everybody raved about it.  My sister made the comment that if it had bacon in it, you would have had a twice baked potato casserole.  We are going to try that next time.

It is a super simple recipe, took me something like 5 minutes to throw together which is great! I halved the recipe because there's just 2 of us and it was enough for 2 meals.  Didn't have sharp Cheddar Cheese so had to use whatever was in the refrigerator (think it was Colby/Cheddar). I added some garlic salt and a dash of minced onion along with a generous amount of fresh ground pepper and it was done and waiting in about 40 minutes using my convection/bake feature.  Actually could have pulled it out a little sooner as the top got pretty brown.  I will definitely be making it again because of ease of preparation plus it's not terribly expensive to make and most generally I have all the ingredients on hand.

This was really great!  Prepared it exactly as written.  We ate it as a dinner casserole and next time I may add more ham and possibly some onions.  Used leftover Easter ham.  Good, easy recipe.

I didn't have frozen hash browns so I shredded potatoes. I also added sauted mushrooms, bell peppers and green onions. I also used cream of mushroom cause I can't get cream of potato where I live. The potatoes didn't really cook but I think thats my fault for not using frozen hasbrowns. I will try it agai nand review using frozen has browns.

If I were single, I am pretty sure I could have scored a date or two after showing up at an early St Pattys Day party with this dish. AMAZING.  I added chopped green pepper and onion to add texture and served topped with a shake of black pepper. SO good.

I've tried many different recipes for Ham & Potatoes and they've always been "so-so"...this was great!  Very cheesy and potatoey!  Husband loved it and he's VERY hard to please!  This will be in our menu rotation for sure :o)

I had some leftover ham and this was a perfect way to use it up.  My husband preferred this to scalloped potatoes.  I took advice of others and added onion and green pepper.  I think next time I will saute them so they aren't crunchy.  It also needed lots of salt and pepper for our taste.  Will add with mixing so that it cooks in.  I also added mozzerella cheese with the parmesan cheese on top.  Will definately make every time I have leftover ham!

Wonderful dish! I made as a side for a baked ham along with sauteed spinach, so I didn't add any diced ham to it. I garnished it with chopped scallions and everyone agreed that the scallions made it perfect. Without the scallions it seems to lack something. Other possible additions I might try are rosemary and/ or sauteed onions and bell pepper or perhaps some crumbled crisp bacon on top (along with the scallions).

This makes a huge amount.  I froze the leftovers, and they are good reheated in the oven straight from the freezer at 300 degrees covered in foil for about an hour.  It has a perfect contrast of potatoey, cheesy, sour cream goodness, with ham throw in for extra.  Add salt and pepper at the table, and you have a perfect savory breakfast.

This was absolutely delicious for our Christmas morning breakfast, and equally delicious leftover!  I added more ham and used defrosted tater tots, which cut down on the baking time - as suggested by another reviewer, otherwise, didn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Used what I had on hand, including cream of chicken soup, less sour cream than what was called for and 'generic' grated cheese.  As I did not have quality Parmesan, I topped the casserole with melted butter, Panko and Parmesan combined.  After all of this...it STILL came out wonderful.  Can't wait to try it as written!!

I've been making this recipe for years now, it's our special holiday breakfast. My kids and even my husband LOVE this recipe. They always ask for it on birthdays, or holidays. You have to give this one a shot!

This recipe probably would have been good as-is but I did double the meat which I think made it great.  We had it for dinner with a salad and it was warm and filling.  Super quick and easy!!!

This recipe was very tasty I made it just like the recipe called for except I used turkey bacon(I dont eat ham) It went over really well. I think this is a recipe you could play with as well. If I hadnt been in a rush to make it I would have tried it with onions,red and green peppers added as well. I think this one is a keeper

My husband and son didn't like it.  I thought it was ok.  The one good thing it does taste just as good as leftovers as it does when you first make it.

I added onions and mushrooms, which made it a little better I think.  Do not add extra salt!  This recipe is very salty already.  Overall, I thought the recipe was only okay.  Because of all the great reviews, I was expecting much better.  I will not be re-making this recipe.

This is an awesome dish!  It is not too rich.  Anything less and the dish would not be worth eating, unless your one of those odd people who like to eat just leaves for dinner.  It gets better as leftovers.  I recommend this dish!  I did use Cream of Celery and Cream of Chicken as the soup because that is all I had.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!

Awesome!  Everyone asked for the recipe:)  I mixed everything (except hashbrowns) the day ahead; in the morning I added hashbrowns, transferred to casserole dish and baked for an hour.  Easy!  Loved it, thanks!

Creamy, comfort...I followed this recipe to a "T". When I asked my husband what he would change my son yelled out "Nothing"! I think next time I’ll add chives to half of the dish for the adults but I’m not complaining. This would be a great dish for a potluck. It really makes a huge amount in a 9x13 pan. I switched the oven to Broil for the last 2 minutes.

So yummy!!! I was a little scared that it wouldn't be all that flavorful since there weren't any seasonings added...I was wrong! It was delicious! Well actually I did add a little of fresh black pepper but that was it, and I'm not sure that it really added anything to the dish. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! We don't eat sour cream so I replaced with plain yogurt that I let drain in a coffee filter to get rid of all the water.  I also added in some shredded mozzarella cheese, cayenne, garlic pdr and a little italian seasoning. So good!

I made this a one-dish supper by adding some peas and onions to it, and black pepper to taste.  I also lightened it up a tad by using heart healthy soup and light sour cream.  It was very good and filling.  Everyone enjoyed it!  Unfortunately, I forgot to photograph it before it all disappeared.  Thanks for a great recipe - I will make it again!

I loved this as did my family.  I then made it for an event and everyone commented on how wonderful it was.   The only change I make is I do not add parm. cheese as I cannot stand the smell.

I made this for the men in my family, they loved it and had seconds. I used 1 can of cheddar and one can of potato soup. I also used all cheddar cheese, including the topping. It was very good.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some ingredients I had on hand.  I used a 24 oz package of frozen cubed potatoes so I had to make some adjustments.  I used 1 can of potato soup, 1 cup of sour cream and about 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar.  Reading a previous review, I thawed and browned my taters a little before putting it all together.  I added onion and garlic too.  I used about 2 cups of cubed ham instead of dicing it.  I love to find recipes that I can use like this - adjusting to what I have in the cubbard.  Simple, easy and tasty!  Thanks!  The whole family loved it!

Great recipe!!! Made this for a friend's christmas brunch and it was a hit! I added 1/2 a green bell pepper and 1/2 an onion, and instead of only using regular sour cream i used 1/2 regular and 1/2 french onion sour cream. It gave it a nice kick! i also topped it with french fried onions and it gave it a nice crunch. This recipe can be used for any meal. Makes a great side dish for Thanksgiving! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was sooooo good. My husband said it tasted like a breakfast he had at a resturant. My teenage daughters loved it. I loved it! It was easy to put together and I didn't feel a need to change a single then. I did add bacon crumbs to teh top but only because I had them left over from a meal I made the night before. This was YUMMY! I will cook again and again and again.

I wanted to make this for breakfast so I omitted the sour cream and added 12 eggs. I only used 1 can of potato soup and added a half cup of milk. I also used a full pound of the tiny diced ham cubes. It was a winner, everyone loved it and it is our new favorite!

This is a great recipe for those pot luck events.  It's easy to double the recipe and everyone loves it.  I have added an envelope of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing (powdered version) to the sour cream and always use cream of mushroom soup versus cream of potato soup and also add real bacon bits.  The added flavor of the ranch dressing and bacon bits works well

This recipe was delicious and perfect for my picky family!  My 6 year old is EXTREMELY picky and she loved it.  Also got rave reviews from the teenagers.  The only changes I made was putting in some garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt and pepper (just personal choices - probabaly would have been just great without them) and adding cheddar cheese to the top about 5 minutes before baking was done (which I did because my family are cheese lovers).  I will definitely add this to my rotation!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Yummy! Nice change from the noodle casseroles. Tangy and cheesy. I added steamed brocolli since I made it for a supper meal. I used cream of mushroom soup since I couldn't find cream of potato. I only used a bit of parmesan on top but next time I think I will add the extra amount because it tasted so good.

These were so good!  Had ham left over from Thanksgiving and needed to find so ham recipes.  Made this for breakfast and it was a huge hit with my husband, in-laws, and the kids.  These are very rich, but oh so good.  Served them with eggs.

This was WONDERFUL!  In fact I made a lot and hubby and I had it three nights in a row with dinner rolls.  I used two packages of O'Briens hashbrowns, 2 cans cream of potato soup and one can cheddar cheese soup.  Then used half the container plain sour cream and half a container of french onion sour cream.  Also doubled the amount of diced ham and a little more shredded cheese.  What a great dish!

Yummy. My aunt made this the last time I went to visit, but I didn't get the recipe from her, and I was hoping this was the same one. From the wonderful taste, I think I found it. I made this for dinner tonight and the kids loved it. I did add some pepper to the recipe, replaced the parmesan cheese with some extra cheddar and I didn't measure the hash browns but used over half of a 64 oz. bag. This will definately be added to our normal menu!

nom nom nom...this was very, very good and very, very easy to prepare.  I added a small chopped onion, but other then that, followed the recipe exactly as it was written.  Similar to "cheesy potato casserole", but the cream of potato soup instead of the cream of chicken soup actually bumps this casserole up a few notches!  Delish, will make this one again and again and again...

OMG Soooooo good!!  I made this for dinner one night with tossed salad and breadsticks. My family of five almost ate ourselves stupid!!  We thoroughly enjoyed the leftovers for breakfast too!! The ONLY thing I changed was to use shredded parmesan on top just because that's what I keep on hand.  Can't wait to make this for Thanksgiving brunch!! Thanks so much for the recipe!!

My family LOVED this recipe.  Believe me, as the mom of 3 very picky boys, it is really amazing to find a recipe they ALL like!  I made this almost exactly as the recipe called for, except for adding diced green pepper and onion, which I sauteed first so it was somewhat cooked.  This recipe is a keeper!  I can't wait to take this dish to my next potluck.

This was good - very easy, very yummy and very comforting. I used the already thawed hashbrown, and added some pepper, garlic and dill to them before everything else. Very filling! Definitely for the very hungry.

I used 3 cups of creamy potato leek soup. I added some salt, pepper and creole seasoning. Next time I will try 1 cup of sour cream like some others have suggested. I also omitted the grated cheese. I am glad we'll have some leftovers to enjoy tomorrow!

This went over well for a brunch but I made lots of changes after reading the reviews.  First I used O'brien potatoes cubed not shredded, added more spices (garlic and onion powder, paprika and pepper) and quickly browned the hash browns prior to adding them into the casserole mixture.  I think this helped the texture and prevented them from becoming mushy after cooking.  I substituted cream of mushroom with garlic for one can of the cream of potato (still used one can of the cream of potato, too).  I used one large Ham Steak and I browned it well, cubed it into pieces and added to the mix.  I used less cheese than stated and once the casserole was almost done, I added a bit more cheese and some french fried onions to the top of the dish and allowed to melt and brown a bit.  Every loved it, it was flavorful and the texture was nice without being mushy.  While my changes did add a bit of prep time, it was worth it for the final result.

It was only okay. I thought the taste of the sourcream was over powering, I would rather taste more cheese than sourcream. I will keep looking for a better tasting hashbrown casserole.

I had such high hopes for this dish.  The consistency was great and the only thing I added was a tablespoon minced onions. My problem is I just don't like the taste of "Cream of Anything" soups.  I have nothing against using them on occasion but they give a certain taste to dishes that you can always pick out.  I'm going to try this again by making a roux instead and see how it comes out.

Sorry...it tasted like baked Potato Soup.  Did it exactly like the recipe.  I'll keep looking.

We've made this recipe many times now because we LOVE it, it's easy and delicious! My 4 year old says "Mmmmh this gravy is SO good!" in regards to the casserole sauce :) We do double the ham amount, using a package of 16 ounces of chopped ham. Otherwise there's not enough meat flavor for us. Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I was afraid it would not have alot of taste because the ingredients sounded rather bland.  I added some garlic powder and seasoning salt to the mixture.  I also added some french fried onions to the top of the casserole to give it some crunch.  Hubby really enjoyed this.

Considering all the rave reviews, I was sorely disappointed.  The end result tasted like something out of box, perhaps because of the manufactured taste of the soup?  My husband liked it, however.  Might taste better with a roux made with butter, rather than the condensed soup.

Ah, comfort food at its finest!  I made this casserole for supper.  It's very rich, filling and delicious!  A change I made was to add the parmesan cheese during the last 20 minutes of cooking, otherwise I knew it would get too brown.  I also added a lot more ham than the recipe said.  This make a lot, which I like because I can freeze the leftovers and have some quick and tastey dinners in the future.

This recipe is good.  Very rich, very cheesy, very salty...all the not-so-healthy things we love.  The ham gets lost in the huge amount of hashbrowns.  I would use 16 oz (1 lb) next time.  I also used Bob Evans Seasoned (Shredded) Hashbrowns that you can find in the refrigerator section of the grocery store near the ready-to-eat items such as pre-packaged meatloaf, pot roast, mashed potatoes, etc.  I skipped the parmesan all together...that's a weird flavor to add to this recipe if you ask me.  The top of the casserole got nice and bubbly brown and so did the edge pieces (the best part in my opinion!!).  I also used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken since they make "healthy request" versions of these and they don't for cream of potato.  The point is...great recipe, and it's flexible so you can make alterations and it will still come out just fine.  Thanks!!! :)

This was really good, and so easy to prepare. I substituted mild cheddar for the parm cheese.  I made this for a brunch "at" my house and I didn't want the whole house to smell like stinky feet while this was baking. I added the mild cheddarabout 15-20 minutes before the casserole was ready to be pulled out of the oven.

It was okay.  I made it according to the recipe, although I wondered that there was no salt added.  It doesn't really need extra salt.  However, with all the reviews, I thought the flavor would be really outstanding.  I thought it was a bit bland.  I'll stick with other cheesy potato recipes.

So Yummy!  I didn't change a thing except I put about half of the parmesan cheese in the casserole and the other half on top.  I think the cream of potato soup is essential.

So yummy! I can definitely see how you could make additions and it would be even better. I only used 8 oz sour cream. Mine wasn't soupy but creamy enough. Everyone mentioned it as a breakfast casserole but I made it for dinner.

This was soooo easy and delicious. I made this Christmas morning and my family has asked to have it many times since. I did add some bell peppers and onions. I also added crushed corn flakes to the top for some added crunch. My mother would have liked mushrooms and some salt. Even without those it was still wonderful. This is a definite keeper!!!

My family LOVED this casserole.  At first, I thought it might be too dry, but the hashbrowns cook down, and make quite a creamy sauce.  If you have kids that don't like "weird" stuff in their food, this is the casserole for them.  I recommend mixing the soup & sour cream separately from the rest, the adding in the cream mixture. It's alot to mix. My favorite part is the crunchy parmesan topping! My only modifications were to the cheeses.  Didn't have enough sharp cheddar, so I made up the difference with whatever was in my fridge.  Also, 1-1/2 cups of parmesan seemed like too much, so I used less.  Turned out perfect!

This was amazing!  Very delicious but next time I think I will put half sharp cheddar and half medium cheddar.  There was a bit of a tangy taste from too much sharp cheddar but this was a winner.

This was so good! Can be used for a side dish or a main dish. I used western style cubed hashbrowns with green and red peppers. I also would recommend a topping I use on another simular recipie. Crushed butter crackers and melted margarine to moisten. Sprinkle ontop and allow to brown. Yummy.

This was tasty. My husband said it really stuck to his ribs.I think next time I'll use less sour cream, as I found the called for amount a bit much for my taste. I used diced ham plus a little crumbled bacon (4 slices) - but I think next time I'll use browned crumbled sausage for a better taste (again, just personal taste). I'll also add some sauteed peppers and onions. I'm also trying to think about how to make this a less costly recipe: it's not very budget friendly right now. The soups are expensive (there wasn't a store brand available), and the other ingredients are also all pretty costly. In all, yummy and I'm glad to have the recipe!

Tasty!  I didn't end up having cream of potato soup, so I made due with 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cheddar soup.  I will certainly be making this again and will try it as written.  I did also double the ham since it was being served as supper.

I probably wouldn't make this one again. i followed the recipe almost exactly - just added some sauteed onions and green peppers and left out the ham. It was ok but definitely nothing special. I think the cooking time needs to be upped - I baked mine for an hour as suggested and my hash browns didn't taste cooked all the way through. Also, I love sour cream, but this recipe really had too much. It was all I could taste!

So easy! I made a half recipe and omitted the ham for a holiday meeting at work. The caserole dish was empty and there were only five of us! It tastes just like the hash brown casserole you get at a certain big chain country restaurant. Definitely a repeat dish!

I have made this casserole in the past, minus the ham.  I tried this over the weekend with the ham and it was good.  My husband wasn't a huge fan but my 2 year old and I enjoyed it.

I took this to a potluck, left out the ham, used the O'Brien potatoes and followed this recipe to a T. I think it does taste like something out of a box. It tasted really heavy/thick. It may taste better with just one can of soup? Also, if I were to make this again I would add cornflakes to the top since I'm not too keen on it's presentation in a casserole dish. I'm giving 5 stars since everyone nearly cleaned the dish empty and had a few compliments on how it tasted.

I just made this for a church breakfast and was really disappointed with it as was my husband. I added 1 cup of chopped onion and 1 cup of chopped green pepper to the recipe. It really tasted more like something out of a box.  Just didn't like the taste of it.

This was a little to rich for my taste.  Will try again though and add some onion, and green peppers and bacon.

Good, but too ordinary to be great.  I will probably make this again though.  Even adding some bread crumbs on top?  It was a tad salty, but nothing I would have written about had I not already read the previous reviews regarding the saltiness.  It tasted great and I usually salt my food anyway.  I recommend using the diced hashbrowns - they will cook to the correct consistency.  Ive also tried this with julienned fresh potatoes and the potatoes never fully cooked correctly.

This was very good. I normally shy away from recipes with condensed soup and processed foods, but this was very easy and those I served it to enjoyed it. I loved that I could just throw everything into a dish without any extra cooking. I did check the calories and sodium on the potato soup can, and found them acceptable.  Not great, but acceptable for what I was looking for in this recipe.

A great breakfast dish. I prepared the dish the night before and just tossed it in the oven in the morning. I used only half the sour cream, 12 oz of cheddar cheese, cubed thick cut Black Forest Ham, and frozen O'Brien cubed potatoes that contained peppers and onions. I think next time I could go with 8 oz of cheddar for less cheesiness and residual oil. A simple recipe that tasted great.

My husband and I love this recipe.  We brown sausage and crumble it up in place of the ham (we don't like ham as much) and other then that follow the recipe exactly.  We make it for dinners and special mornings (Christmas, etc.).  Awesome recipe!

I made this dish to use up some leftover Easter ham.  I didn't need 12 servings so I used half the ingredients and baked it in a smaller dish.  It was delicious- as my daughter said, "It's a keeper."

I tried this because of all the great reviews. It was excellent!! I made it today for Easter brunch. My family raved!

My changes: I added 2 eggs, green peppers, tomatoes, and some seasoning (onion powder, salt, pepper) to the mixture. I waited until the last 15 minutes to add the parmesan cheese. 

Make sure you let the hash browns thaw out completely.

I made a double recipe for about 40 people at my husband's birthday party. Thought I was going to have lots of leftovers, boy was I wrong! Only had enough for a meal for the 2 of us. These were such a hit. I didn't change anything.

Fab-u-lous!  I loved this....SOOOOOO easy! 1 bowl!  That's it! (Better listen when they say to mix it in a BIG bowl, though!) Next time may add some salt, sauteed onions, and green chiles! Great comfort food, and we had it for dinner!

I made this for work and everyone loved it! I was told that this is what I have to bring from now on. A few adjustments were made though, I used frozen hash with onions and peppers and omitted the ham. I also agree with another review that it is important that you use cream of potato soup . I made this once with cream of celery and it just wasn't as good.

I used the frozen hashbrowns with the diced peppers and onions as others suggested.  I also realized after I started adding ingredients that I didn't have any sour cream.  I softened a block of cream cheese in the microwave and mixed in some heavy whipping cream.  The casserole had good flavor and was very creamy and rich.  It might be interesting to add a crunchy topping like crushed crackers or potato chips too.  My husband and I enjoyed it, but didn't think it was anything special.

This is a Great recipe and I make it for dinner all the time. The only 'extra' I add is some dried minced onion. I also bake this for 1 hour and 10-15 minutes just to make sure the potatoes get done. The first time I made it I baked for 1 hour and the potatoes were still a little hard. I'm getting groceries tonight and the ingredients are on my list!

This was very good. I took the advice from another reviewer and topped it with Durkee onion's (THAT WAS A MISTAKE) it made it way too salty. Next time I will reduce the amount of Parmie but follow the recipe exactly. It was full of flavor.

I followed the recipe to a T and no one in my family liked it.  It reminded me of scalloped potatoes and ham more than a breakfast type food.  Sorry, I wish I did like it because Im not sure what to do with the leftovers now.

The first time I tried this recipe I did exactly as recipe stated - I thought it was very blah - No flavor. I made it tonight and it was so much better! This is what I did - In a bowl mix soup,sour cream, Cheese, and 1 thinly sliced/chopped onion. Spray pan with Pam spray and put a layer of half of the hashbrowns - then half of the ham chunks - then half of the Soup/sourcream mixture. Then repeat layers. 10 minutes before it was ready I stirred everything together and baked for 10 more minutes. It was a huge difference - Definitely add extra ham and chopped onion in it for flavor.

I loved this recipe.  The kids had mixed reviews.  Two said it was to cheesey and one said the potatoes were to mushy.  I did change a few things.  I doubled the ham because I was serving it for dinner.  Also I used one can crm. of mushroom  and one of crm. of potato.  Changed the cheese to colby insteady of cheddar.  Very quick to whip up and throw in the oven on busy days.  Total comfort food for cool autumn days!

Tasty and easy.  I sprinkled some french fried onions on the top to add a little crunch, left off the parmesan (didn't miss it)and substituted cream of mushroom for the cream of potato (we don't like cream of potato).  I think this will be a tasty addition for Christmas morning.

I thought it was a great dish but MUCH too creamy and salty... and I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  When I reheated the leftovers I added an entire thing of frozen green beans and it was AWESOME!  I think frozen chopped spinach would be really good with it also!  I will probably be making this again, but I'll be sure to add the veggies with it!

I made this a for brunch and left out the ham since I already had a meat dish. Everyone loved it.  It was so easy!  I used the cubed-style hash bronws not the shredded style. Not sure if that mattered.  Anyway, this is a winner!

This is by far one of the best recipes I have tried from this website. Anytime I bring it to brunches or potlucks, I always get tons of requests for the recipe. You can't go wrong with this one.

Tried this today for the first time to take to a breakfast at bowling league. Everybody loved it..I made one change as others did...I did not use swiss cheese on top...instead I used about one cup of shredded cheddar and it was fine!! This would be an easy recipe to half and make a smaller portion if needed.Will make again!!

I made this for a faculty breakfast and it won rave reviews.  Very easy to prepare!  I added some thawed diced peppers and drained black olive slices before baking.  Many requests for this recipe.  Thanks for the great dish.

So great and easy for weekend breakfast for guests!  I use reduced fat soup and sour cream, and it's still very creamy and tasty!  I have never been able to find cream of potato, so I use one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom and that works just fine for me!  I also take this for Friday breakfasts at work--I never take any home!!

Very good, but so fattening I can't give it 5 stars.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom/onion and 1 can garlic chicken instead of the potato soup.  I also used only 1/2 the sour cream, but next time I would use the whole amount (I'll try non-fat).  I used the fresh parmesan as suggested, and also appreciated the advice to mix the potatoes in last. My family loved it though - we devoured it in 2 days.

This is also excellent as a potato side dish with ham--just omit the ham from recipe.  My whole family loves it and people ALWAYS request the recipe. I'm making it for Christmas!

This was really good, it was a bit salty probably from the ham and the soup.  It was a hearty meal.

I cut this recipe in half when I make it. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and found that the sour cream over-powered the dish. I made it again and substituted 1 can of cream of mushroom and onion soup for the sour cream.  We liked it much better this way.

Well,  I've tried many breakfast casserole recipes.  And this is the keeper.  I took it to a brunch meeting and it was delicous and tastey looking with the golden crusted top.  I used fresh parmesean, which I highly recommend.  I agree with a previous member who thought you need to keep it uncovered the full hour.  The top gets so golden and good.     I really didn't alter anything in the recipe except I used one cream of onion and one cream of potato.  I probably used a little more ham than 8 oz. (used what I had frozen).  I don't know if I'd make it for dinner, since it is so rich.  But for a potluck where people tend to like the creamy, salty, gooey, rich stuff...this is perfect. It disappeared.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was sooo good! Easy too! I made this for our weekly Sun family brunch. Everyone thought it was great. I can't believe anyone would say this was bland. You could add broccoli and this would be a whole meal.

We had this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! Quite rich and creamy.  I followed the recipe except for using canned corned beef instead of ham (like it better), cream of chicken soup, and way less parmesan (didn't have that much).  I'm not sure what the people who said it was bland were talking about as this recipe had tons of flavor.  The only changes I'll make to it in the future is use maybe half the cheddar and only about 1/4 a cup parmesan for an 8x8 casserole (I cut the recipe in half).  Thanks so much and this is going into my recipe book!  We're looking forward for an excellent breakfast of leftovers tomorrow (and the next day).

An awesome recipe!  The only change I made was adding one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of onion to replace the cream of potato.  (I made it with the potato soup the first time and I didn't think it had as much flavor.)  This is always a huge hit and people ask for the recipe all the time!  Thanks!

We love this recipe! I made it twice in one week, the first time I made it just as the directions say and the second time I added some fresh broccoli to try and add some veggies to the meal. Both times it was great, not one bite was leftover.

Yum!  Comfort food at its best!  I didn't have any sharp Cheddar on hand so I used a bag of already shredded Tex Mex style cheese but it still tasted wonderful!  I wasn't sure if my kids would eat this or not but they did and they really liked it.  Very comforting dish!  Thanks!

This is terrific.  I added chopped celery and onions to give extra crunch and lighten up the potentially over-powering cheese flavor.  This is one of my family favorites.

Loved it.  Even my picky 9yo ate it happily.  The only variation I made was I only used 1c fresh parmesan.  I used lo fat sour cream and I also used the *cubed* hash browns, not the shredded ones.  It came out perfectly at 1hr exactly.

I was very pleased with how this recipe turned out. Instead of ham I cut up some Hilshire Farms Lit'l Smokies and threw those in. I used a pre-packaged blend of cheddar and monterey jack for the cheese and in the last 5 minutes of baking I threw some french fried onions on the top instead of parmesan. I also turned the oven up to 400 for the last 20-25 minutes because I wanted the top to be a little more brown. Came out very tasty.

I made this for my husbands Christmas Party carry-in at work. I doubled the recipe and made an extra dish to serve with dinner. I deleted the ham and added half a can of cream of onion soup. Everyone, including my kids loved it. I overcooked the one I served at home a little. When my husband brought back left-overs from the carry-in I had some of those leftovers. It was better than the one I served at home because it had a creamier consistancy. It was very, very good either way.
Thanks for sharing it!

It was okay...you need to add a tsp. of sugar to cut the tartness of the sourcream though.

Great recipe!  The whole family enjoyed it.  I used turkey ham and doubled the amount, southern-style hash browns (diced potatoes), and also used just 1 cup of fresh-shredded parmesan on the top instead of 1-1/2.  I will definitely make this again, maybe with some green peppers and onions as others have suggested, and experiment with some spices.  I also loved how quick this recipe was.  I am a busy mom of 3, so this is a great quick meal (we had it for dinner!) Thanks Melissa!

Good recipe, mix the ham, cheese, sour cream and soup together first, then mix in the hash browns when they are still frozen if possible, makes for easier mixing.

I made this for my 1-year anniversary and my husband LOVED it!  I did make a few changes to our tastes.  I used sausagae instead of ham, 1 can of potato soup and added fat free evaporated milk and 1 egg beater egg to make up for the 2nd can of potato soup.  I baked at 400 degree for an hour and it came out perfect!  Such a yummy recipe!  Thanks so much Melissa!

I made this without the ham, used fat-free sour cream and added more cheddar cheese.  I thought this recipe tasted too "sour" so next time I will cut the sour cream by AT LEAST 50%.  I will also cook it longer than 1 hour, as the cheese wasn't as melted as I hoped it would be.

This was fabulous! I put in an extra 1/2 lb of ham to make a full pound and my husband and I loved it. Next time I'll add onions to give it a little more flavor. Will make again!

Great and EASY recipe!  I made this for my daughter's brunch, and did everything other than baking it the night before.  Popped it in the oven an hour before it was to be served, and it was one of the most popular dishes!  Every bit of it was gone!  Great recipe.  (I did leave out the ham because I had guests who don't eat pork, but I know it would have been great with it as well!)

This was really tasty!! All 6 of my kids and my son's friend LOVED this dish. This one's a keeper! Thank you!
(I did have to bake it 20 minutes longer to get the potatoes soft enough because they were still frozen when I put it in the oven)

Delicious!  Still smells great in the house!  My only complaint is that it came out a _bit_ too salty...but I'm sure I can adjust for that next time.  Like other reviewers, I used 8 oz. low fat sour cream, low sodium cream of celery and cream of mushroom soups, mixed in 2 eggs for binding, and added some onion, cayenne pepper and garlic powder to kick it up a bit.  I did use the ham, as I had a few ham steaks on hand, but it would be delicious without, I'm sure.  Although good, I don't think you sacrifice anything by leaving off the parmesan on top (which I added in the last 20 minutes of cooking).  Thanks for a wonderful new recipe!

Served as a side dish with pulled pork. Made the night before and baked day of. Worked out well and made getting the meal together much easier. Everyone loved it. Kids had seconds. May not go back to my old family recipe.?? would be good without the ham too. Surprised there was no butter in it but it didn't need it with everything else. Used cream of potato soup as written.

I halved the recipe, and it turned out pretty good.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt it was a little salty.  When making it again I would only use 1 can of soup total and add some milk.  Also, it does take the entire time to bake.  Very creamy and cheesy though!

I have made this casserole dozens of times and it is a hit every time! I usually use ham I get from the deli (chipped) and then I cut it up. Whenever I make it for company or a large crowd, I am asked for the recipe. Very easy and tastes great!

Yummy!!  I've tried several versions of hash brown casserole and this is the best.  I added diced onion to mine, as did many others, and just a little less sour cream.

This was a super easy recipe to make! Use your largest mixing bowl when making this - I had to switch to a larger one once I realized how much it made!

I tossed the entire pack of ham (it came in 12 oz portions only at my store) in the casserole and it turned out fine.

I guess I didn't read the directions carefully and mixed the parmesan right into the casserole instead of topping the casserole with it. Again, this didn't seem to make a big difference. It made so much - I ended up freezing some of it for later.

This was good, but nothing to write home about (and believe me, if I find something to write home about, I do...my Mom is a gourmet cook.) It definitely WAS better the next day. Quite salty, even though I used pork sausage instead of ham. If I make it again, I would do as other have suggested and use reduced-sodium soup. Definitely a high-fat and high-carb food for when you want that kind of thing.

This delicious casserole without the ham was part of our Thanksgiving dinner for the vegetarians in the family. It got rave reviews and tasted even better the day after!

Excellent! Served it at our Father's Day Brunch. I used 16 oz. breakfast sausage instead of ham and used 3 cups of cheddar and no parmesean. If you use obriean potatos you won't have problems with the potato lumps from the soup. I think adding the cheddar soup as others suggested would make it too cheesy. I would consider this more of a breakfast side dish than a main dish because theres not that much meat in it compared to the potatoes. I had to cook it an extra 10 minutes and it was slightly soupy when I removed it from the oven, but it set up beautifully within 5 minutes. Highly recommend as a side dish for breakfasts/brunches over 8 people.

I made this for a brunch and it was a hit (and my husband devoured the leftovers). I cut the recipe in half, and based on the reviews of others, used cream of mushroom soup instead of potato. I also used sausage instead of ham and added some cajun spices and salt to add some zip. Very easy and very yummy!

YUM, YUM, YUM!  Tried this out today in advance of a potluck brunch on Saturday.  Halved recipe and used one can of cheese soup.  Did not add ham or top with parmesan cheese.  It was simply delicious.  Next time, will add the ham and sprinkly lightly with parmesan.    Without the meat it would be an excellent side dish with bacon and eggs for a hearty breakfast

I took this dish to a brunch at church today and everyone thought it was wonderful. It was super easy and even though I cooked it a couple of hours before serving and it was still warm and didn't need reheating.  Travels well. I made it exactly as recipe calls for, although next time, I may add green chiles.

This recipe was one of a few new Allrecipes I tried for a Mother's Day brunch.  I liked this recipe...when I made it, it reminded me of the standard "Cheesey Hashbrown" recipe with cream of mushroom soup in it.  But it had a very different flavor from the old standard recipe.  I did not attempt to prepare the recipe the night before, but I will the next time I make it.  yummy!

This is probably the best hashbrown cassarole I have ever had.  I think the key is the "sharp cheddar" as opposed to other cheeses.  Easy to make.  I prepared it two days in advance, then on the morning of my luncheon, I removed it from the refrigerator to get it back to room temp before baking....

So rish, but GOOD!  Used up some of the ham from Easter and made a simple supper with some asparagus.  I didn't have cream of potato soup, so used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken.  Also ran out of parmesan so subbed more grated cheddar on top.  Everyone raved.  Would like to try it with some chopped, steamed  vegies sometime.

Excellent and easy.  I added more ham to the recipe.  Popped it into the oven, went to soccer practice and came home to a nice warm meal.  I set the temperature a little lower on the oven to compensate for the additional cooking time.  The kids loved it.

My husband said a definite two thumbs up!  I only had hashbrowns with some onions and green peppers in them.  I was worried it wouldn't taste very good but it was incredible with our leftover easter ham!

I made this for an Easter weekend brunch, and everyone loved it! I decided to use Virgina baked ham, and the flavor from that really came through in the casserole. This is a super easy recipe, and I'll be making it again soon for our Memorial Day crowd at the beach!

I know Melissa & she kept bringing in this dish for our pot-lucks @ work.  I'm not a huge potato fan for breakfasts & did not try it for a long time.  One day, I did....and was upset that I didn't get back to the pan for seconds before it was all gone!  I LOVE this recipe & it is so versatile to adapt to any situation. I am making this for a pot luck whith my "cook" relatives ( I'm not much of a cook!) and anticipate great reviews!  Thanx Melissa!!!!!!!!!

This was a great dish!  I made this for a brunch that my friends and I had for a baby shower and it was completely gone at the end of the shower.  I added sausage to it and it was fantastic.  Will definately make again.

Doesn't taste like Cracker Barrel's, which I guess I was expecting/hoping for.  But it was still REALLY good.  If I remember correctly, Campbell's has a cheddar cheese soup or something that I may try next time instead of the cream of mushroom that I used this time.  Or I may add some Cheese Whiz instead of one of the cans of soup.  Either way, a wonderful comfort food to add to my plans for Christmas breakfast this year.  Thanks so much!

I wish I could give this recipe more stars. This recipe is so very gooood ! I make it about every 
other week.This is one of the very few dishes that I fix that will please the whole family and
no one has a problem with it, that makes me REALLY GLAD !
The only thing that I do different is not use the parm-cheese. It is wonderful without it. 
Thank you Melissa! ********************************************* !

My sons loved this. I used the southern style hash browns (diced) since the recipe didn't specify whether to use shredded or not. Also I used a parmesan/romano prepackaged combination. Except for the shredded cheese, this recipe was cheap, easy and I will make it again.

Made this as a side dish without the ham and it was a hit.  I decided to use cream of celery and cream of cheese soups instead.  For a crunchy topping, I crushed up some potato chips.  I knew someone who did this with a similar recipe.  My sister in-law likes to use plain bread crumbs to top it off.  Recipe was very helpful..thanks.

Loved it!  It was so simple to make!  This took less than 10 minutes to prepare and it was fantastic!  Next time I think I'll add the French's Onion Rings as suggested in earlier reviews for a bit of crunch and it was a tad salty so next time I think I'll omit the parm cheese totally and use a ham that I'm sure is less salty.  Other than those modifications I plan on making next time my husband absolutely LOVED it and I'll be sure to make this one again and again!

Very easy to make.  I had this for breakfast with eggs and my son thought it was very good.  He is picky about things mixed together.  I do think you need something else with it other than by itself.  We had some re-heated for dinner and it was even better.  I also used Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese instead of plain Cheddar.

Found this recipe yesterday afternoon and cooked it for our evening meal.  Used Cream of Mushroom Soup, rather than Cream of Potato Soup , it was fast and easy to prepare.  Cut the recipe in half for three adults and it was great!!  We have given this recipe to three friend, so far.

I made this for Easter brunch and it was a huge hit! The store was out of regular hashbrowns so I used O'Brien instead. I think I'll make that a permanent change! They added a little more flavor and color to the dish. I also used less parmesan cheese than the recipe calls for. This is definately a keeper!

Very yummy! I didn't use ham or parmesean cheese, substituted low fat sour cream (instead of regular), cream of chicken (instead of mushroom) and used 2% cheddar cheese (instead of whole) and it came out wonderful. I have made this recipe several times and my boyfriend and I love it!

I am involved in a 4-family cooperative cooking group.  I fixed this the other night and got rave reviews from everyone, especially the men!  This is a very hearty casserole, and a quite different from the "usual" breakfast casserole!!!

A wee bit salty but I use salt very sparingly.  I used ham that was available at  my grocery store already cut into cubes, and I used shredded cheese, which enables me to have the ingredients mixed up and into the oven in *no* time after work.  This dish reheats very well.

I found this a little salty.  While the dish was good - it wasn't great.  Everyone ate it and liked it...but it's not a keeper for us.  My mother found it unimaginative (which might be a good thing).

The whole family loved this recipe. I cut it in half since there are only 4 of us and it was the perfect amount. My man just raved about it all day, so I know I'll be making it on a lot of weekends from now on. Perfect just as the recipe is, but next time I might add a few slices of crumbled bacon.

Let me add my voice to the chorus of praises! This recipe was yummy comfort food that was ridiculously easy and quick to prepare.  I probably won't make very often because of its high fat content, but it's a great recipe to have for special occasions when you just don't care. ( I also added chopped onion, substituted bacon for ham, and used reduced fat sour cream, which I cut in half.)  Really delicious recipe!

I took this to a party and it was a big HIT!  Everyone loved it, and several people asked me for the recipe.  I took out the ham, but added 1/2 tsp. of salt to add a bit of flavor.  The type of frozen hashbrowns I used had no salt, so it may not be the best choice for everyone.  The second time I made it, I added some bacon to the mix.  It was definitely a good suggestion.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I added chopped onion and used Romano cheese on top instead of Parmesan (that's what I had on hand).  Everyone loved it except for my 6 year old (but he won't eat anything!).  Definitely a keeper!

My husband had to change his pants after eating almost the whole casserole himself.  My 5 year old didn't like it, my 3 year old ate it but it wasn't her favorite.  This is more of a side dish than anything...I probably would only make this again if I was taking it too a brunch potluck or if I was having family over. It IS really easy to make.

This recipe was WONDERFUL! We all loved it! Quick, easy and smells great in the oven. Gotta watch the top the last 15 minutes so Parmesan on top doesn't burn. It was creamy and cheesy but not too cheesy. This is MAJOR comfort food! Great on a cold night.

This recipe tasted very good although it seemed a bit mushy. Next time I am going to cut the sour cream in half and substitute a can of cream of chicken for one of the cream of potato. Loved the crunch of the cornflake topping. I have a similar recipe I have used before and am trying to perfect it to my family's taste. Quickly becoming one of my favorites. I especially like the convenience of mixing it up the night before. Thanks!

I made this recipe but eliminated the ham because I was looking for a dish to compliment a ham dinner. It was amazing! I would make this dish again and again with ham, without ham. Don't substitute the cream of potato soup. It's the golden ticket. Bonus...if there are leftovers (big IF) it freezes really well. That's right folks IT FREEZES REALLY WELL! I froze individual portions of this great comfort food that I could reheat for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Go ahead. Make it. You won't be sorry. Rich, comforting, delicious food. Straight up.

This is an Awesome dish. My husband and neighbors and I absolutely devoured this dish. I did omit the Parmesan and added more of the cheddar per others recommendations. I will definitely make this again

I will definitely make this again. Great the way it is, but can be amended to use what is in the pantry. I substituted 1 can of cream of mushroom for the potato soup. I also sauteed an onion and celery and added those to the dish.

Changed the ham over to bacon, and it was still great. We cooked the bacon first, just to make sure it wouldn't still be raw.

HANDS DOWN BEST BREAKFAST CASSEROLE. I have made this for a few years now and for every work potluck. It would go so fast and people were sad so I started doubling it and it still all gets eaten. I make it as is but I also have added more ham (love ham!) and added a little mozzarella cheese. This is so simple yet so good and versatile. Thank you for the recipe!! :)

Made it as a main dish with a couple of veggies on the side and a hearty hot roll.  I did add a medium onion as we love onions. 
 Was wonderful!!!  House smells heavenly and everyone loved it.  We will make this version again!!

I make this all the time. I always use double the ham. Rarely use the Parmesan. Crumble potato chips onto each portion after dishing it out. I share the food I cook as often as I possibly can and this is easily the crowd favorite of all my regular recipes.

The only thing I did was put tin foil on top and take it off the last 20min. It was a HIT with my fiance. The only thing we'd change next time is adding a little more ham and he wants corn flakes on top.

This is an amazing recipe. Have made it precisely and loved it! Have also made with O'Brien taters and a few shots of mild hot sauce like Tapatio to kick it up a notch for a dinner. 10/10 will make again.

I've made it the way the recipe calls for but prefer it with o'Brien hashbrowns, spicy breakfast sausage and different cheeses. I mix in one bag of cheddar jack and top with a bag of mild cheddar. I loosely covered for the first 20 minutes so the cheese wouldn't burn.

'Followed the recipe enough to share a very valuable tip:  Brown the hashbrowns or you're essentially having mashed potatoes with added ingredients.  Maybe I'll stir it up & reheat to serve with meatloaf tomorrow.  I'm not kidding.

This recipe is awesome! My toddler even liked it, so it's a keeper. I don't usually make a lot of potluck-style dishes, but after this, I'm gonna try more. Made the recipe as-written, except I cut down on the parmesan.

This is definitely a keeper! I used thick cut hash browns, doubled the potatoes and eggs. I used one 12oz can of evaporated milk and one can of Campbell’s fiesta Nacho Cheese soup.. I used 3  8-oz pks of diced ham,  probably a cup of extra sharp cheddar cheese , about 4-6 oz of peppermint jack and spread Mexican cheese over the top. I had a 9x13 pan plus a deep dish pie plate. It was really good! I will probably brown the potatoes some next time.  Very versatile recipe! As you see, I tweak everything!

okay, so this is obviously delicious per the flavorful ingredients (cheese, sour cream, cream of potato, more cheese). It's oh-so-creamy and cheese is gooey throughout. I used mild cheddar, but I wish I had used sharp instead (flavor would pop a bit more). With all that plain, white potato, stronger flavors can't hurt. One thing missing from the recipe that I think is essential is salt/pepper. I added some, but could have used a bit more (I guess I was relying on the parm to work on its own.) By the way, the parm was good, but maybe could use a little less (and more time for it to brown, perhaps?) I think a nice layer of cheddar on top would be good as well, instead of parmesan, but it was good either way.

This is always at our holiday breakfast. Sometimes with meat and sometimes without. I often use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream just because it’s always in my fridge. I do usually let mine cook a bit longer than suggested though.

as a huge fan of cheese, even for me there was way too much parm on the top. It was just too heavy handed. Next time I will try adding some veg. Maybe mushrooms, cooked up onions, red peppers etc.. Could use a little more ham too.

Yes I added corn, cream of chicken, no flower, sour cream, and baked it at 425 for 30 min than 375 for 15 minutes or until bubbling and golden brown on top.

This is a great base recipe for a cheesy hash brown casserole. I substituted a 16 oz. kielbasa cut into small pieces for the ham and cream of chicken soup (instead of potato). I also added two teaspoons of dried onion flakes and one and a half teaspoons of powdered ranch dressing mix (like Uncle Dan's) to the potato mixture before baking. To top it off, I sprinkled one and a half cups crushed butter crackers (Ritz) over the casserole and added the parmesan cheese on top of that. Despite thawing the hash browns before using, this recipe needs at least 70-75 minutes to cook potatoes and meld flavors. My family enjoyed this dish, and my teenage kids said the crunchy top tasted like Cheese-it crackers; I will be making this again.

I made it as directed and it was good, but I think it could have used a little more flavor.  I'm going to switch up the recipe just a bit next time and try cream of bacon instead of cream of potato

Really easy dish and tasty too.  Since there are only two of us, I cut all ingredients in half except the ham.  Cooked in ceramic pie dish.  Enough for two meals for two people.

This was delicious.  The only changes I made were because of lack of supplies.  I used a little less sour cream.  And I exchanged 1 cup of the cheddar for walmart's fiesta mix,  because that's what I had.  Still turned out wonderful.

We made this for a church event.  It disappeared so fast I didn't get any.  I did taste it after cooking it to make sure it was good.  Everyone loved it and tried to come back for more, but it was gone.  Going to make it again, just for us this time.

Made this for a huge family gathering. Everyone loved it, even my 1 year old Grandson.
The only thing I changed was I swapped bacon bits for ham.
The only thing I would do differently next time, I would not put shredded parmesan on top. I would use grated parmesan.  The reason for this is the grated parmesan formed a thick crust that you couldn't cut through. Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

This recipe is one of the best breakfast casserole recipes because it’s simple and easy. Since I am vegetarian I didn’t add the ham and it still tasted like heaven. I made it for Father’s Day and my dad loved it.

This dish was eaten so quickly I don't think there were any leftovers.  I subbed ham for bacon but it was still delicious!  Definitely in my top 10

I made this for a work potluck and it was pretty well received.  I modified the recipe slightly to include some sautéed diced onion and tri color peppers, subbed bacon for ham.  Without the veggies, this would have been too one note for my group.  I give high remarks because it is a super fast dish to put together and tastes good!

Love this recipe.  There are only two people in my house so it's easy to cut this recipe in half. When the grocery store has ham slices on sale I go for this recipe.

It’s a keeper!!! This was absolutely delicious! I used 2 20 oz pkgs of hash browns since I couldn’t find a 32 oz pkg, increased the ham cubes to 2 cups (that’s what came in the packaged bag) and decreased the Parmesan cheese to 3/4 cup. Other then that, I followed the recipe exactly,  it was so easy to make and was a super hit with older teenage eating machines!

I have made this 1000 times and every time it comes out perfect and awesome!! I make it the way it says BUT sometimes I don't add the ham. I also add a little 1/2 and 1/2 to thin it out. it get a little too thick at the end if baking. the 1/2 and 1/2 makes it creamy cheesy good

I'd rather have this with eggs than all of the potato. It ends up pretty tangy from the parmesan and sour cream, but was surprisingly still a little runny. I may try it again adding eggs to see if I like it better.

Super rich, super creamy! Next time I make it, I might add more potatoes or even a vegetable like peas. A nice way to use leftover holiday ham.

Delicious and easy. The only change I made was adding a half cup of chopped onion, which rounded out the delicious blend of flavors. I made only half this recipe and still it was enough for three meals for two people. I will definitely make this again!

This casserole tasted great following the recipe as is. The one less star was due to the texture of the parm cheese topping, which came out as a leathery crust. This recipe is a keeper, but will top with more cheddar or Colby jack as suggested by another reviewer.

Made just as is.  But this recipe is HUGE.  We had five people and this will really feed a large group at a gathering.  Very rich, tasty and comfortlike, with the texture of a mac n' cheese dish.  Anyone will love it, especially if group includes children who don't like green vegetables :)

I made this. My wife loved it so I will make it again.  I used no salt.  Between the ham and the soup there was plenty.  I add a can of mushrooms.  Next time I think I will saute onions and fresh mushrooms.  It is easy and it is a keeper.

Every time I make this casserole, it is a HUGE hit!  Family gatherings and pot lucks - it doesn’t matter.  It doesn’t last more than a day at our house and it’s always gone, gone, GONE at potlucks.  It’s also one of the EASIEST recipes I’ve ever followed.  Dump everything in a huge bowl, mix, pour into a casserole dish and bake!  You’re done!  The only bad thing is you have to wait an hour for it.  But BOY is it worth the wait!  Love, love, LOVE this dish!

I doubled the recipe for a church function and cooked it in my slow cooker (with a slow cooker liner for easier clean-up) overnight on low. I had started it at 9:30 pm and switched it to warm at 5:00 am. It turned out great and it was a hit.

This is a family favorite comfort food since discovering it a few years ago. We don't actually make it that often, but when we do... it's nearly impossible to stop eating (probably why we don't do it that often). Also made it cabin-camping with friends and they loved it too! There are a few tweaks we make sometimes (liking adding extra cheese - YUM - adding onions or making with cream of mushroom soup - both tweaks my mom and brother like, but not me), but this recipe is awesome the way it is!

This is my go to breakfast casserole. It’s always a hit. I followed two different user suggestions. I use 1 can of potato soup and 1 can of cheddar cheese soup and the must have ingredient for us... green onions!!!! You can sub the ham for whatever you like. I usually use jimmy dean or owens pork sausage.  I’ve added real bacon bits before and I found that too salty. If adding bacon, I like it better when I cook it myself and crumble.

Made this today for NYE brunch. My only alteration was the addition of a layer of spinach (approx. 15 oz can, drained) between two layers of the ham/potato mixture. Hey, I happen to love spinach, especially with ham! It added a nice touch of color and flavor, and provided a little veggie in the dish. Sides were fresh mixed fruit chunks and buttermilk biscuits. 'Twas a hit! Oh, and the Mimosas went down well, too.

Delicious and SO easy! My in-laws say this is better than Cracker Barrel's hash brown casserole. I made it without the parmesan cheese on top by accident (forgot to buy), but I'll sure it's good both ways.

I made this for my husband for deer camp and I have had to make it for the last 3 years plus a trout fishing trip.  My father in law loves it.  It was easy.  I did alter this by making it with 2 pounds of pork sausage.  Browned it and then used that in place of the ham.  Perfect!

This dish was awesome.  I just halved the ingredients and used beef Polska Kielbasa instead of ham.  I baked it in a 9" pie pan and fit perfect.

Love this recipe. My family loves this recipe. My tailgating friends love this recipe.  I have made this probably 25 times in the last 18 months. It is so easy to make and it tastes so delicious. I have substituted the ham with ground sausage and with bacon before, just to change it up, any way I make this it turns out great. This dish is also great for a side dish at the holidays or anytime.

I did not have cream of potato soup, so I used one can cream of  chicken and one can cream of mushroom soup, and 2/3 cup sour cream instead of a full cup.  I layered the cubed frozen hash browns on the bottom since there wasn't enough liquid to mix in, and then mixed the creamy stuff, and then mixed everything in, including a small package of California mixed vegetables, and baked it at 350 for an hour.  It was underdone, so 375 would have been better.  I would definitely make it again.  Super easy and filling casserole.

I made this recipe as written (though halved) as a breakfast-for-dinner casserole.  My husband loved it and ate it 3 times later during the next few days.  Five star rating.  Before I made it again I thought to try and add a bit more.  I finely chopped half an onion, half a red pepper and most of a seeded (that means the membranes gone, too) jalapeño pepper and sweat them all.  Mixed all the wet ingredients, cheese and extra veg and then added the hash browns.  Also, VERY IMPORTANT!!...I hand shredded the cheddar and parmesan cheese...NO pre-shredded packages of cheese for ME.  Made a great recipe EVEN better.

This is a pretty tasty hash brown casserole.  I used cubed hash browns instead of the shredded and I think it needed to bake 15 to 20 minutes longer than the recipe states because some of them didn't taste like they got quite fully cooked.  Otherwise the cheesy taste with the ham was really good.  My 7 year old absolutely loved it.  Will make again, but I'll leave it in the oven a little longer next time.

Tried it last year at Christmas.  Its now a requested staple at family functions and its super tasty! 

I sometimes make half with ham, half without, depending on the crowd. 

I pre-make it, put in dish night before into refrigerator.
 In the morning, I just put it in the oven. Easy!

I've made this twice now, the first time as it was written and the second time making modifications. The second time, I used o'brien style hashbrowns, ham, 1 can of cream of potato soup, 8oz sour cream, 1 cup medium cheddar cheese and salt and pepper. Baked for 1 hour. Before serving, I grated fresh parmesan cheese over it and topped it with a fried over medium egg.  So good!! My super picky child had seconds. The egg yolk makes it! We've finally found our Christmas morning meal. This recipe would also be awesome using sausage instead of ham. Had to give 5* for the inspiration and for finally ending my recipe search!

I made it this morning for brunch for my family. I didn’t use quite as much sour cream. I also added some bread crumbs, cheddar cheese, and Parmesan on top to help it brown. It was amazing!!!

This was so good! We made our own creamy potato soup. I'm allergic to MSG and we couldn't find any canned variety that didn't include it in the ingredients. We also chopped up a few green onions and added to the mix. Our grand son was over and he just couldn't get enough of it!  We will make this again soon.

What a killer breakfast casserole! Honestly, if I weren't such a stickler for grating my own cheese, this could have been in the oven in under 5 minutes. Looking forward to living on the leftovers for a few days!

Made this following the recipe to a tee.  Next time, I will put sharp cheddar on top.  We didn’t like the parmesan cheese on too as much.  Other than that, this is a really good potato casserole.

I made this yesterday using the hash brown chunks not strings.  I also used one can of cheese soup and 1 can of cream of potato soup as another reviewer suggested.  This was so good!  I had leftover ham, so I put that in.  This recipe would still be great without any meat as just a potato recipe.  This is a keeper.  We are having the leftovers, reheated tonight.

This was delightfully delicious and the only reason I'm giving it a star less is because the texture was a bit mushier that I would have liked - it had the consistency of mashed potatoes!
Maybe it was the potatoes - I'll definitely try it again !
I served with asparagus and fruit salad for a brunch.

Really good. Followed the recipe to the letter. It was a hit. The next day I shaped the leftovers into patty’s and fried them so they were browned and served some over easy eggs over it and that was really good too.

Everyone just loved this...  I did use O'Brien hash browns the last time and it did go over well.  I did brown them a little first.  My guys in the office request this a lot!!!

This is a great recipe! It is creamy and delish. I made it for a family brunch and everyone loved it. I did follow the recommendation of another reviewer and substituted one can of potato soup for cheddar cheese soup. Very easy to throw together the night before and bake in the morning.

Doubled the ham. Subbed 1 can of potato soup for cream of chicken. 2.25 cup cheddar. Only 1/4 cup Parmesan probably. Better for breakfast than dinner. Reheats easy.

I made this and it was amazing.  I did tweek it a little though, I also put in a can of cheese soup as well as the potato soup. I also topped the dish with the cheddar along with the parmesan.   My husband loved it, this will be my cheesy hashbrown go to dish.

Delicious casserole! I only make one substitution and that’s because I have to cook gluten free. I used a homemade cream-of-anything substitute for the cans of cream of potato soup. Everyone in the family loves this including the kids!

I LOVE this casserole and have made it many times.  To me it's a classic comfort food dish.  I usually omit the ham and Parmesan (using extra cheddar instead).  I also prefer to substitute potato soup with cream of mushroom which makes it a bit richer.  I don't limit eating this to breakfast, it's just too good.

Great recipe.  thanks.  I wasn't really thinking but there are no eggs in this dish and I should have made some type of eggs to serve along side it.  thanks for the great recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Made this for a work breakfast. Everyone devoured it! It was one of the easiest recipes I’ve ever made. I’ll be making it as aside dish for Easter dinner and I’ll leave the ham out so that it doesn’t compete with the main dish.

Good recipe. It was pretty heavy and I would’ve put onions in it as well. With the left overs I ended up throwing into water and chicken broth and made a chowder! I prefer the soup over the casserole but great ingredients

This was so easy to prep and have ready.   I used a package of cubed ham to save time.  I also added some onion flakes for flavor. Family liked a lot.

I did use cream of celery and added onion. Also because I adjust to 6 servings I felt two oz of ham was not enough so I put in 4 oz.  Since I cut it in half I put it in a 8x8 pan and cooked on 350 degrees for one hour worked out perfect! I really liked this  dish and will make it again.

My husband hates breakfast casseroles. This is the only one he will eat and it has become a Christmas Morning Staple with our family. I do double the ham but keep the rest of the recipe the same. So easy!

Really good recipe.  Very easy and everyone loves it!  I do add salt and pepper to taste and increase the ham to 12oz.  Lastly, from time to time I will add a can of diced green chili just to give it some heat.

Turned out great but I added more cheese than called for, garlic powder, Tony Chaceres seasoning and a small container plain Greek yogurt. If you don't do that it will be too dry I think. With these additions it was perfect

I made this today for my niece, who can not eat eggs. It went over well with everyone. I did have to make one change though, the grocery store was out of cream of potato soup. I decided to add cheese soup (who doesn’t like more cheese?).

I made this because I needed a quick and easy dinner. Everyone liked it, including myself. I read the comments before making it, because there are always a lot of good tips in there! I bought all of my ingredients at Walmart. I found diced ham in their meat department, so I used 8 oz of that. I used frozen, diced Potatoes O’Brien because I love the onions and bell peppers in it for extra flavor. I didn’t want my recipe to be too salty, so I only put just over 1/4 cup of bagged shredded Parmesan cheese on top. I also used some black pepper and some garlic powder to taste. Then I sprinkled paprika on top before putting it into the oven, just for a touch of color & flavor. Everything else, I followed the recipe! It was quite flavorful and was so QUICK to toss together in 10 minutes and that’s only because I had to shred the block of Tillamook Sharp Cheddar Cheese I had. It all mixed together easily. If you just want a side dish, you could leave out the ham & people would gobble it up!! I served this with a tossed green salad and crusty garlic bread. My husband and 18 yr old grandson were very happy!

Since there were so many positive reviews for this recipe, I tried it. And like many others, I tweeked it to my taste. I added a small diced onion (sautéed) and a small diced green pepper.  As much as I love sour cream, I didn't think it would work, but I added it in.  I thought the casserole was very good, but don't think I'll add the sour cream next time as it gave a bit of an odd flavor.  It's a great dish for any meal of the day.  However, since it's just the two of us at home (and my husband doesn't care for casserole dishes), I'll probably half the recipe to make it just for myself.  This is a wonderful dish for a potluck or maybe even treating the office staff to breakfast!!

It was a good recipe. I added green peppers and onions as some other reviewers suggested. I sautéed them before adding. I also used shredded Parmesan instead of grated. It was a good way to use up some leftover ham after Christmas. We had it as a main dish for dinner and then the next morning I made some eggs and served as a breakfast hash brown dish with them.

Was a huge hit for brunch on New Year's Eve.  Left out the ham since we had a vegetarian in the group.

This was a very simple dish to make for my family of 5 tonight.
Easy to follow directions and fast to throw together. I received nothing but compliments. I will definitely be making this again in the very near future!

Tasty and easy for Christmas morning. 
Make night before. 
2 ham steaks, 2 cans soup, omitted sour cream and Parmesan. Used extra cheddar instead, used medium cheddar. McCain frozen hash browns.

This was incredibly easy and well received for a Christmas breakfast dish.  I accidentally bought shoestring potatoes instead of hash browns, but it worked out great.  I par boiled the potatoes first to make sure they would be tender. I’d make it with 10-12 more oz. of ham next time to add a bit more protein to the dish.  The cheese was melty and delicious!

I did add a couple of small pats of butter (no more than 1/4 a stick ) to the original recipe.  Family loved this.  I also added some bacon bits to the Parmesan topping.  I would perhaps add about 1/2 cup of half n half or milk to the recipe to make it creamier in the future.  Other than the butter and bacon bits, I made as original recipe----very, very good!  Definitely keeping this one!

I've made this twice in the past week for group breakfast buffets.  Everyone liked it, but several people suggested reducing the amount of sour cream used and increasing the amount of ham.  I'll try it again with these suggestions and see how it compares.

This recipe is very easy and everyone loved it.  Its a very versatile base recipe.  The last time I made it I used spicy chilies, and substituted half of the jack cheese for Sharp cheddar.

Very tasty and so easy! I made it Christmas morning for an easy breakfast and it fit the bill. I added and handful of chopped green onions to the top because I’m southern.

One of my favorite casseroles! I have made this numerous times. Made it as written and it’s delicious! After making it so many times I like to use 2 cups of ham and I use cream of chicken because I usually have it in my cupboard. I also have been shredding up 4 cups of fresh potatoes in my ninja food processor instead of the frozen hash browns. Every time I bake a large ham I save the leftover ham, dice it up and use it in this casserole.

turned out really good, although a little to much cream cheese for me. Next time I will add crispy bacon to  the top and reserve some of the hash browns to place on top for a more crispy texture.

Great starter recipe.  I made it as is the first time.   It was lacking some flavor so next time I will be adding more ham, sausage and bacon to the recipe.  Possibly also onions and garlic.

I made three small changes: I cut the amounts in half so it would serve two people and have leftovers, omitted the Parmesan and added a can of chopped green chilies. Put it together the night before and put it in the fridge. Cooked it uncovered for an hour then topped it with cheddar. LOVED it! Cooked a couple of eggs over easy and put them on top. Hubby ate his with some Frank’s hot sauce.  Also, I thought it could be cooked a little longer, but not much. Excellent breakfast!

I felt that there wasn't enough egg to the recipe. Going to try putting in less potatoes, add more egg and try ham instead of sausage.

I made this today. It was really good. I used diced ham that is sold like that. It was a pretty big package but I used all of it. I used one bag of diced potatoes with the onion and peppers already added. One can of cream of potato soup, 8oz of sour cream and a 2 cup package of shredded mild cheddar cheese. I added salt and pepper. It was good. I would make again. :-)

My family of five scarfed this down like their's no tomorrow. Seriously, it's really delicious x5! I added garlic powder and cracked black pepper to taste before baking.  Make this- it's easy to put together and a crowd pleaser!

I'm a little conflicted over the rating since I made a half of a batch. I made it AS-IS, just less of it. I saw all the rave reviews which lured me in. However, all I could taste was sour cream and if that's not the flavor that is expected, (NOT a fan of it) then this ended up a disappointment. Others liked it. I was sort of mentally expecting something like potatoes au gratin with ham and this wasn't "it." Will not be making again.

Pretty good. I added some leftover diced tomatoes and some peas to up the healthiness. Also, I added some more spices like cumin, oregano and quite a bit of freshly ground black pepper, along with my own personal all-purpose spice mix. Served with a handful of pita chips.

Made this last night, it was very good. I used one can of cream of celery because it's what I had, and based on other reviews the other can was cheese soup. Also covered with more cheddar as well as the Parmesan. This ended up super cheesy, just what I like! I used shredded hash browns, but next time I will try the O'Brien potatoes.  Overall a tasty total meal in one dish, looking forward to the leftovers.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband and my son who doesn't like things that are too cheesy. I did use the southern style potatoes O'Brien which add a little flavor and I mixed the soup, cheese and sour cream together before adding the potatoes and ham (as someone else suggested). My husband also thought that using the small smoky links sausages instead of ham would be good so I will try that sometime.  I was afraid that I would need to cover this with foil to keep the top from browning too much but it ended up ok without it.  This could be used as a breakfast casserole but this is my new recipe for when I want to take cheesy potatoes to family get togethers.

Incredibly salty. Like seriously, wow. Not a bad concept, but I'd need to find a way to cut half the salt to ever make it again.

Made to the recipe exactly.  Served this St Patrick's day as the alternate to boiled potatoes.  Good comfort food:  my 15-YO grandson asked for the leftovers to take home.  Everybody else enjoyed it as well.

This is by far one of my favorite recipes on this site, this casserole is so much better when you use cream potato soup instead of cream of chicken!  Cracker barrell needs to take some notes!

I've made many recipes off this sight and most are ok, few have been fabulous and THIS is FABULOUS! I always make as it reads the first time around to know what changes are needed, this was so amazing and it's what 5 ingredients, total of $13!. The only thing I would add is more ham, this makes a ton of food and I am going to double the ham next time. Creamy, cheesy, simple and delicious, I have to say this might be my favorite recipe that I've found online, if you don't like this then there's definitely something wrong with you lol

Absolutely delicious. I made this recipe as written and everyone loved it. I was cautious initially because I hate canned potato soup. But mixed with the sour cream and cheese it transforms into something special. I will replace my old cheesy potato casserole with this one!

I use this as a base recipe for a few different meals. It's great as written, but I also change it up depending on how I'm feeling. I've made it with ground beef as well as shredded chicken, but my favorite is to make it with Potatoes O'Brien, leaving the rest of the recipe as written.

I mostly halved the recipe for 4 for dinner, except used 8 oz diced ham, half bag potatoes O'Brien, added 2 cups chopped broccoli and 3/4 tsp onion powder. Baked for 1 hr.  Served with rolls and fruit. It was fabulous!

Not for us. I added sautéed onions and peppers, but it was still just a massive amount of cheese and sour cream gooeyness.  Will keep looking for the right combo, even altering this one. It's a good base...

Very easy to make and turned out great.  My baking dish was a little larger than 9x13, so the casserole was more spread out and I was able to cook it successfully in less time.  Will definitely make it again.

I am not sure exactly why, but my kids won't try this. But I absolutely love it! It is addictive. So I end up eating the entire pan.  It reheats well in the microwave.  So kids? You snooze, you lose! It's all mine!

Recipe is perfect the way it is!  One tip from me, I thaw out the potatoes in a strainer, running hot water over it beforehand.  Might be a duplicate tip, but important. Sometimes I double this recipe and bake in a very large dish. When doing so I wait 45 min before putting the Parmesan cheese on top so that it doesn't burn.  

You can substitute the type of soup you use in the recipe for a different taste and it comes out tasting great regardless. I take this to work potlucks and I always get asked for the recipe. Great recipe, thanks!

This was delicious and everybody in my family enjoyed it. They are all picky (I'll eat anything) and this is one of the few meals I don't have to alter or have a different dish for anybody who snubs their nose! Thank you for sharing, I will be making this a lot!

Kids raved about it and asked for the recipe (grown kids).  Everyone loved it.  Bake the night before then just heat in microwave for breakfast, the top stays crunchy.  Perfect side dish for scrambled eggs and bacon.

This recipe caught my eye for an easy Christmas morning breakfast. Then I realized I didn't have all the ingredients so I made do with what I did have. Also, I have very picky eaters in my home so I kept it simple.......I shredded fresh potatoes, used canned cheddar cheese soup, shredded cheddar cheese and diced ham. Added garlic powder, salt and pepper. It turned out good and it was so easy. I should of cooked the casserole maybe another 10 minutes to ensure all pieces of potatoes were done. Next time I will cook it for 35 minutes at 375. The variations to this recipe is endless!

Awesome.  Made half a batch for my hubby and I for dinner with a side salad then had left overs with a fried egg for brunch a couple days later.  I have been looking for good left over ham recipes and this one fit the bill to a tee.  I did follow the recipe pretty closely but did take the suggestions from several previous reviews and added 1/2 a chopped onion and a teaspoon of diced garlic and reduced the parm cheese to less than 1/2 cup (for the half batch).  Wonderful both times.

I made this for my family and they loved it!  It was great as leftovers too.  I did tweak the recipe just a bit by adding 1/2 cup of milk, a 1/2 onion (my hubby stated I could have added a whole small white onion), pinch of chili powder and garlic powder while minimizing the salt.  Turned out great!  It's quickly becoming a family favorite.

This recipe was very simple and turned out well enough. It was a bit on the salty side for me and I think the amount of Parmesan needed to be cut in half. I will make this again and change it a touch to satisfy my family's palate.

I didn't have Parmesan cheese on hand, so I put a layer of  the hash brown mixture on the bottom covered by a layer of Swiss cheese slices, then another layer of the potato mix.  Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers.

I made it for breakfast at our church some of the members don't eat eggs.  I wasn't sure how a breakfast casserole would taste without eggs. I read several of the reviews and decided to give it a try. I added onions, red and green bell peppers mainly for color but it added great flavor.  Everyone loved it! And it as become the most requested breakfast item.

I love this casserole.  I didn't have cream of potato soup, so I used cheddar cheese soup.  So hearty and comforting!  Tastes just as yummy reheated.

This is a fantastic recipe. I've made it 3 times in two weeks. I've mixed it up by melting a stick of butter and omitting sour cream, but even as the recipe is written it's excellent.

Really simple to make, Tastes great too. Next time I will cut the parmesan cheese topping to 3/4 cup. 1 1/2 cups of cheese makes it too salty.

This was a great change up for breakfast. I followed the directions and it seemed to much for my largest pyrex mixing bowl so I switched to my industrial sized mixing bowl lol and to be safe I used the casserole dish bigger than the 13x9, but I can be a messy cook. It was very simple to put together and very tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good casserole. I love that it doesn't include eggs. I like to use the frozen bag of hash browns that have green peppers.

I make two of these for a crowd of Army young men every four weeks. It is always a hit.  Two feeds about 15 - never any leftovers!  I add a little splash of hot sauce and sometimes a small can of chopped jalapenos.

Very delicious and very cheesy! This needs salt and pepper though. It severely lacks in salt. But a good, quick meal nonetheless.

My daughter is a very picky eater and she loves this so it is definitely a keeper!! My husband and nephew raves about this dish, I make it every. The first time I made I followed the recipe to the letter but they all said too cheesy. so now I use mild cheddar instead of sharp.

First...this recipe is great as written.  Loved it!

As we all try substituitions, so did I! Some worked and some did not.

Other kinds of cheese: mixed reviews but sharp and parm work best. I do mix both in with the hashbrowns and save a little to sprinkle on top.

Other kinds of soup: nope! Cream of Potato is a must!

No meat or different meats: these all seem fine depending on what I've got on hand and what else is being served.  I've used sausage, bacon, and hamburger. Meatless is my most common variation here.

Sour cream sub: French onion sour cream dip adds some amazing flavor to this with no extra work since you can buy this right next to the sour cream. I do this all the time now.

Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish was devine.  I added Tumeric, garlic, pepper, and nutritional yeast. My kids couldn't get enough of it. I grated the potatoes by hand eliminated the sour cream and added eggs instead. I also only needed one can of cream of anything soup.

This was OK, but the hash brown potatoes were 1/2 raw inside.  I think this recipe would be good, but cook the potatoes FIRST before assembling the casserole.  Added 1 egg, beaten, to liquid ingrediantes.

I checked out this recipe and other similar ones. I decided to add some canned mushrooms, green onions, and 3 eggs. Made only half the recipe because there are only 2 of us. I mixed it all up, covered it and put in the fridge til this morning and baked it for 50 min at 325 and it was really good. Hubby had 3 helpings, its a keeper.

It was excellent. Both  husband  and myself loved it and even my son who isn't easy to please said It was good.
We keep Kashrus so I used soy bacon instead of ham and since I couldn't find a kosher cream of potato soup, I used cream of spinach. Even with all the changes, it was great. I think it would do well on the blech and since we have milchig on Friday night, I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe

It was okay but I felt it was way too much sour cream. I read the recipe and the reviews several times to make sure I was really supposed to use a whole 16oz tub. It seemed to be a hit so I went against my judgement and used all 16oz. If I make it again, I'll half the sour cream. It wasn't extremely overpowering but it was definitely the main flavor to the dish.

I  also added bacon & used Oreda potatos O'Brien, 1 can each cream of potato soup & 1can cream of chicken soup.  Used 2 cups crushed corn flakes with 1/4 cup melted butter, mixed together & sprinkled on top instead of the Parmesan cheese.

It's a gooey casserole that you kind of dump on your plate, but tastes GREAT!  This went over well at a season ending tennis brunch.

This is such a versatile recipe!  I used a mixture of swiss, cheddar, mozz, and provolone for cheeses and also added an onion and some diced bell pepper for veg/color.  I've made a number of variations of this recipe before, but I really like the cream of potato in this one.  We served it at a Mother's Day brunch and it was well received; it would also work as a side dish at an evening meal.  THANKS, for the recipe!

The first time I made this, I made as instructed.  For the many, many other times I've made this, I omit the parm cheese on top.  It's just a bit much for my taste.  It's certainly one of my favorites that I can bake up and take for lunches to work.  YUM!

OMG! These were good. Made them for my husband's birthday party and they were a hit. I didn't add any salt they definitely does not need it, and I used some cheese I had leftover from another recipe that was combined with Sharp cheddar, Cheddar, Munster, Coby jack and Mozzarella. I left the Parmesan cheese off.

This was very tasty. I scaled by half and added fried onion bits to the top as suggested. Wasn't clear if you needed 8 oz shredded cheese or one cup -- the 8 oz package says it contains two cups shredded. I went with half a package; I think the whole package may have been intended. Cooked in 13x9 at half recipe, and it took a good 45 min to cook (started w frozen potato squares, not thawed.)

Great recipe.  A good way to use up the leftover Easter ham. Next time I'd add a few chopped hard boiled eggs, too.  I make a similar recipe like that and it's amazing.

Yes it was cheesy but it was just ok.  Lacked something.  Maybe needs some Jalapeño or bacon instead of ham.

Very yummy. Little salty. Maybe because I used Spam instead of ham. Or Romano  cheese instead of Parmesan. I will do this again but I'll probably add bell peppers or something.

Made early this morn at 7am & put in fridge until 10:45 am when we got back from church. Put in oven 45 mins. covered with foil. Then uncovered and baked another 10 mins. to brown the top a little. Since I could not get the"O'Brien"(Ore-Ida) hashbrowns, sauteed 1/2 sweet yellow onion and added 1/2 small can mild green chili's. Mixed the sour cream, potato soup, cheese and onion/chili's together first, then added hashbrowns & ham, then mixed. Also put Kraft Mexican Shredded cheese on top as the parmesan as others said would be too salty. (Do NOT add salt to this recipe as the condensed soup is already salty enough). Sprayed 13X9 glass dish with PAM and poured in mixture. I do think I could have made this the night before and put in fridge but reduced the cooking time the next morning to only 30 mins. as the hashbrowns would have thawed out by then. Note: my family all went back for 2nd helpings! Hooray!  A member of my family suggested adding PANKO bread crumbs on top next time which would have to be browned in butter first before putting on top.

The changes I made was used cream o cheddar and cream o mushroom soup not cream o potato. Instead of ham I used 1 smoked sausage. I also added a little seasoning since other reviews said it came out bland. Keep in mind it is a casserole so don't be scared to twist things up and add different things.

I used a 36 oz bag of hash browns, 8 oz chopped ham, 1 lb cooked sausage, and family size can of the cream of potato soup, the same sour cream and cheeses and topped it with 1 lb thick cut bacon (okay minus the few slices I ate first ...) to crumble on top.  Absolutely delicious.

It was good! Pretty much made it out of what I had in the fridge. Used Hot smoked Italian Sausage, smoked Chicken and some pork. I also added chopped red onion and 3 smoked chopped Jalapenos and topped it off with some Slap Ya Momma Seasoning!! I also used 1 can of Cream of Chicken and 1 can of Cream of Chicken with Herbs instead of cream of Potato.

Wonderful meal and the family loved it! The only change I made was to add an additional 8 ounces of the ham. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was great. I will be making this one again.

I usually make one-half recipe because there are only two of us.  I also use an iron skillet (mine is square) and heat it up before I add the potato mix and put it in the oven.  It gets a great bottom crust that way as well.  I love this cut into squares with a side of scrambled eggs.  Heats up well also.

I made this recipe as is the first time and it was really good, but I always like adding my own spin to things. Instead of using frozen potatoes, I saw Bob Evans shredded potatoes and season them to my liking and Brook them in the oven just until they start to brown (for and added texture). I also sautee onion, green bell pepper, and mushrooms. I only use one can of cream of potato soup and substitute the other for cheddar cheese soup. The last thing I do differently, is use sharp cheddar as well as swiss cheese, it's the perfect combination and it's fantastic!

I have made this several times now.....just as written first (still 5 stars), and THEN with my personal modifications - made only for our preferences. These changes included doubling the diced ham to 2 cups, adding minced garlic & garlic powder, half a diced onion,  ground pepper and 'home fries' in place of hash browns, just because we prefer it. Cut the cheddar cheese to about 1 1/2 cups and the Parmesan on top (fresh) to about 1/2 cup - in attempt to make it a little less unhealthy! Also used light sour cream. This recipe is fabulous just as is too!

This is a very good dish, especially for leftover ham!  I used more ham than called for and less parmesan cheese (only because my boyfriend is not a big fan of parmesan cheese) and it turned out delicious.  I got a lot of compliments on this dish.  Thank you!

This is a great alternative when regular Tator Tot Casserole was getting old...and so much easier! It got rave reviews from everyone I served it to. In just a few days, I ended up making it twice, once for dinner and once for a potluck. The first time I had leftover ham that I used, and I accidentally left off the parmesan cheese. It tasted awesome! The second time, I only had ham lunch meat on hand, and I included the parmesan. Using lunch meat was fine, although I prefer it with the thicker pieces of ham. I did NOT like the addition of the parmesan cheese. It toasted too much on the top, and didn't really add anything. This will definitely become a regular in my meal plan cycle!

This is delicious straight out of the oven and leftover.  I prepped it Christmas Eve and baked it Christmas morning for brunch.  It was a hit with everyone.  It makes a lot, and we ate on it for days.  I plan to keep it on my brunch menus.

I made this but took some tips about reviews and didn't add the parmesan.  I think next time I will add garlic salt as it seemed to be missing some flavor.  Also I think chopped onions would have been good.  We did like it.

This was a delightful surprise.  I didn't have Cream of Potato so I used Cream of Cheddar and Cream of Celery.  I made one batch with onions and peppers (sautéed) and one batch without. I preferred the batch without but there are people in the world that must add onion to everything.  Ah well.  Lots of good options with this recipe in the reviews.  I skipped the parmesan as others indicated it increased the salt content.  Everyone raved and I referred them to this recipe.  Thank you for the easy peasy cheesy wonderful quick and easy dish!

Wow - these potatoes are so good and are very easy to make.  I made them for Christmas brunch and everyone loved them. I did not add ham.  I did add a small can of green chiles.  I baked the casserole covered loosely with foil.  During the last 5 - 10 minutes of baking, I removed the foil and topped the casserole with some finely crushed corn flakes that had been mixed with a small amount of melted butter.    Lastly, I inadvertently mixed the parmesan cheese into the potato mixture.  It was very good!

I accidentally put a Romano/Parmesan blend on top and now I’m freaking out. It doesn’t smell right. Will it still taste okay? I know my husband hates goat cheese and so does my step mom. I’m so disappointed. It’s usually amazing but this time I’m not sure.

This recipe is so quick and simple to make.  I brought it to a family Christmas brunch and it was a huge hit!  I was concerned about whether or not to thaw the hash browns. worrying that if frozen, the casserole might be watery.  It was not, and tasted delicious!  I'd like to play around with this, and try some of the suggestions that others have tried.  Thinking of bacon instead of ham?  At any rate, this recipe was super easy and very popular!

This was absolutely amazing! The only thing I did different was I stir fried my potatoes and ham together added half an onion and then put everything in a casserole dish and added the rest of the ingredients, Everyone loved it! They even wanted the recipe. This is now a family fav, and I will definitely bring this to any potluck dinners!!!!   Forget any other cheesy potatoes recipes ,this is the one and only

This is my favorite breakfast casserole when we have guests. I mix it up the night before and put it in the oven in the morning. Wonderful!

Five stars with modifications. I used thick cut bacon, fried and then chopped up, instead of ham. Also I reduced the recipe by quite a bit and found it cooked better. If you do make the full recipe, make sure you put it in two baking dishes or one very large one so that it is not too thick (about 2 inches). If it's too thick it doesn't cook properly. This time I used about 1-2 cups hashbrowns, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 cup cheddar cheese, half an onion and some cloves of garlic diced and sautéed, and one can of cream of mushroom soup.

I made two of these last night, one exactly as written to take to work today, the other with sausage and bacon instead of ham for eating at home.  I wondered if it would need salt and pepper or other spices because of the potatoes, but the other ingredients are salty enough so it all works!  Everyone at worked really liked it.  Next time I might add diced peppers and onions.  I diced the ham pretty small so it kind of disappears in the casserole.  Next time I might dice it a little bigger and add more ham.  Definitely a keeper!

I love this casserole! Only substitution is 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of potato. Adds a little more flavor.

I made this for a family gathering as a dish for brunch and it was a huge hit!  The only change I made was I used colby-jack cheese on the top rather than parmesan.  I will definitely make this one again!

Delicious. Best served fresh out of the oven. I'm reheating for multiple breakfasts as a college student. Sick of cooking every meal, every day. Microwaving for 1:30 does the trick and tastes pretty darn good. Will be making again!
May add some onions and peppers to the next batch and see how its turns out. But his recipe is golden on its own.

SCRUMPTIOUS!!! This recipe was so easy and delicious. However, I come from a family who can't eat without an onion..lol. So, I added  one (1) large diced and sautéed until tender yellow onion, plus 2 Tbs. onion powder, 1 Tbs. black pepper, and 1 Tbs. dried parsley flakes.  I also, used Kroger brand 'country style' (diced) hash browns.  My family couldn't get enough.  They said it tasted like sour cream and onions potato chips. YUMMY! A keeper for sure.

I made this just as written and it was delicious. 
The kids initially frowned at it - (since it was new to them) 
and the were asking for something else. But there wasn't any left when dinner was done and they all loved it. 
Will definitely be making this again!

This was pretty good.  Made as written.  I think it needed a little more seasoning.   A little mushy texture.  I had a fair amount left over so a couple nights later I threw it in a bowl, added salt, pepper and garlic and a handful of cheddar cheese.  Made in to patties and put in a pan with butter.  Cooked until browned on both sides.  Yum!  The two people who didn't like it as a casserole were fighting over who got the last one!!

Easy, simple, and so adaptable.  I decided to use this for a dinner when hubby had to put something in the oven as I was coming home later than usual.  I made it up the night before so he only had to preheat the oven and put it in.  Unfortunately, I didn't have hash browns and rather than think of another recipe, I opted to use the mini tater tots I had on hand.  Also saw a bag of frozen peas and carrots, so I added part of that as well. but waited to add the Parmesan cheese until the casserole.  The hardest part was mixing it together as even using my largest bowl, the ingredients were heavy and it filled the bowl.  Decided to wait to add the Parmesan cheese until  I came home the next day and could see the casseroles just starting to bubble.  When the cheese was melted and just beginning to brown I removed it but waited about 10 minutes for the sauce to thicken, but garnished with just a little crumbled bacon.  I sent some over to a neighbor who lives alone and explained to her why It had mini tater tots.  She called later to say she loved that chunky texture and encouraged using them again rather than the hash browns the recipe listed.  So I the mistake turned out very well!

The recipe uses Cream of Potato Soup in 10.75 ounce cans. My Safeway doesn't carry Cream of Potato,  so, I used Cream of Chicken. Campbell 's Cream soups are now in 10.5 ounce cans.  The recipe uses a 32 ounce package of hashbrowns. The hash browns I purchased come in 28 ounce packages. I bought two packages,  one regular diced hashbrowns and the other O'Brien Hashbrowns with peppers and onions. I used two cups of each ..to add more flavor. My husband loved this casserole. .

This was outrageous.  I didn't make it for a brunch, made it as a side dish.  Halved the recipe, just for the fact was the first time making it, was afraid not all would like it.   Only thing I did different, I used fresh crumbled bacon.  Was a big hit here.

Always a hit.  Make it for Christmas morning.  Make it for brunches.  Make it for side dish with ham.  Always get requests for the recipe.  Yum!

I added some green onions to add some color, flavour  and texture. I found it hard to mix everything together evenly. Next time I will mix the wet ingredients together first; maybe add some 1/2 + 1/2 to make it mix easier.

I used diced hash browns but followed the rest of the recipe as is. We really enjoyed this meal. Very easy to make and I would make it again.

the only things I changed on this recipe is I used mild cheddar instead of sharp as we prefer mild & instead of parmesan cheese we used more mild cheddar & I used 2 packages of the simply fresh shredded potatoes. this is a family favorite.  we make it every year for Christmas breakfast.  we love it.

Very tasty!  My family loved it.  I did make an adjustment because my boys don't like sour cream so I used 8 oz of sour cream and 8 oz of heavy cream.  I took everyone's advice and pre-cooked the potatoes slightly.  I already have requests to make it again.  I might try it with breakfast sausage next time.

This was SO good!! I used a fresher shredded parm on top instead of the usual powdery grated parm like for on top of spaghetti; it made such an incredibly cheesy crust on top. It's very rich and filling, I had to talk myself out of running back for seconds...YUMMERS!!

Oh my, Yum!  Made this for my nephew and we both loved it, easy to throw together, I am one to always tweak a recipe with extra seasoning and stuff, not needed here only thing I added was black pepper, and a handful of green onion. We had the leftovers with eggs for breakfast in the morning. The shredded parm on top made a nice crispy layer.

This was really quick and easy. I mixed and popped it in the oven in the morning to cook before the family was up. It was really to make, serve, eat and clean up before we went to church on Sunday. The only thing I would do different is half the recipe - it makes a lot.

We call this Shwartze and use sautéed onion and cream of mushroom soup is best. No ham and lots of grated white extra aged cheddar. A family favorite.

I used ranch flavored sour cream, 8 oz. and regular sour cream. I used healthy request cream of mushroom and healthy request cream of onion. I skipped the parm but used 2 % grated cheddar.

This was really good.  However, package sizes have changed on some items, like hash browns.  So used two packages (20oz each). Added little more ham and sour cream.  It was great.

I have made this at least 5 times in the last couple years and each time it is a huge hit! I made it last year for our family Christmas party and it was gone before everyone got through the line! They couldnt get enough of it. It is also very easy to make.

Fantastic - I didn't have cream of, so I have to use heavy cream, sour cream, and a little cream cheese. I used freshly shredded marble cheese and chunk ham from my local farmer. This was great, kid and husband loved it.

Had some leftover ham and no idea what to do with it.  Found this recipe and had almost all the ingredients on hand.  I cut the recipe in half; used cream of jalapeno soup (found at my local HEB store) and crumbled thawed tater tots to complete the recipe.   My husband and I really liked it and we will certainly try this again.

This was a good recipe but the potato soup didn't do it for me. So I changed it up a bit the second time and used cream of mushroom instead and added One bunch of chopped green onions. Salt and pepper to taste and 1/4 cup of melted butter. Added much more flavor.

Quick and easy and oh so good!  I halved the recipe and used cooked, crumbled and drained hot sausage instead of ham because that's what I had on hand.  I also used low fat cheese and  fat free sour cream and it was still yummy!  It's a keeper for sure!  I can see all kinds of variations and add ins with just the items I usually have on hand.  When I plated mine today I served with a sunny side up egg right on top.  Awesome brunch!

 Thanks for the recipe!

I make this dish often. It is quite simple, and my family loves it. I add different cheeses here and there, to give it a different flavor.  Also add parsly, onion, garlic powder.  You can't over, or under do it changing it up.  bacon instead of ham, fresh sliced, diced potatos.  Make it your way, can't go wrong..applause for this basic!

I have had multiple variations of this over the years. This version is very good. The ham turns it into a hearty dinner. Definetly a keeper recipe.

Won't make it again. Has a funny taste to it. I guess it's an aquired taste, my family just didn't like it.

I have used this recipe for several years now and love it as is! However, this year I decided to make one ingredient change and found it too be awesome as well.  Instead of putting ham in the recipe I put in Stone Crab Claw meat.  Because I reduce the recipe by half (there are only two of us) I kept the amount of crab meat the same as the original recipe.  It was awesome.  I may not use ham anymore. I will definitely use this recipe for many years to come!

Just wasn't for me. It was quick, easy to make and filling.  But it lacked taste in my opinion.  I don't know if some seasoning would help, or not.  I tried it plain, with Cholula hot sauce, and even adding some Ms. Dash afterwards.  Don't think I will make again.

I made this for Christmas breakfast and it was hit with kids and adults!  I added crumbled bacon on top and omitted ham on half since my husband is not a fan.  It is easy to make (and modify if desired). Excellent recipe!

We Loved it! I doubled the ham to 16oz, added Black and Cayenne pepper, added 2-3 tbs chopped up butter and used shredded Italian Parmisian Blend instead of Grated.

I cooked it as directed. Some of the hash browns were a bit crunchy, so i cooked for another half hour. I added a considerable amount of ham, as the 8 oz. just didn't seem enough... maybe this was the reason why the hash browns didn't cook through. Anyway, an additional half hour was what it needed. I also like that the recipe allows for seasoning to taste. It's not bland, but my daughters and I added a bit of salt and pepper. I'd rather add spices than find that the original recipe was over-salted, etc. I gave this recipe 4 stars because after cooking it longer, my daughters loved it! Thanks!

It smells amazing, only tastes average.  It needs seasoning, too bland on its own.  I am going to try the tips from RLHERMAN next time.

Followed recipe exactly. It looked nice coming out of the oven, but this was so heavy and rich a dish, you can't eat but a small amount. I don't think I'll make it again for that reason. A bite or two,  flavor was great.

Delicious...now to be fair, i didnt follow the recipe exactly, but after trying it with my modifications, i know it would be just as delicious either way :)
i used one can of crm of pot and one of crm of nacho chs (that was all i had)...i added a small bag of bacon pieces (as well as the ham), didnt have parm. chs, so i added just a 1/2 cup of pepper jack with the reg. amt of cheddar chs.  and i also added some pepper.  i sprinkled french fried onions on the top for the last 10 minutes.  it was delicious!  i loved the little chunks of potato from the soup, so two cans would have been good, but i do like things a bit spicier, so i think the nacho chs substitute was a nice touch.  i also love parm chs, so i think that would be a nice addition, however, again, i like things spicier, so hence the pepper jack.  as for the bacon...need i explain?  everything goes good with bacon  :)   Thank you for a wonderful recipe!  it would make a great dish at any BBQ or party.

Nothing to write home about, except how easy it is to make. Thought this might work as a substitute for scalloped potatoes and ham, but didnt come close for us.

I tried the recipe and sounded excellent but very disappointed.  Read the reviews and everyone raved about it. I did not care for it at all.  For all the ingredients you are buying and the outcome it is definitely not worth itfor me. 

 I never wrote a review before but this was just so unpleasant.  Buy a quiche or make your own- fry some already cooked sausages and you have dinner or breakfast. 

 If going to a luncheon check your grocery store for redi made quiches already prepared and serve with antipasta bread which  can be vegetarian or with meat.  Yes, men will eat quiche(grin). Christina

I'm really surprised I didn't like this since I like every ingredient on it's own. I stuck to the recipe with one exception - the cheese (instead of sharp, I used mild). In the end, the only flavor that stood out was the condensed cream of potato soup. Maybe one can would do? Not sure - but I won't be making it again.

Don't know if it was the potato soup or what, but seemed a little bland.

We really enjoyed this.  There are a lot of ways to make the recipe your own by switching out & adding new ingredients.  I look forward to trying this again.

Yum!!! It's tough for me to find a recipe that's a hit with the kids and my husband, but this did the trick.  I used 2 cups of ham (had leftovers from Christmas) and it turned out great.  I might try shredded parmesan next time, but the grated gives it almost a bread crumb texture on top.  Still as good the next day.  I will definitely make this again!

This was awesome! I made this for Christmas breakfast along with a french toast casserole from this site. It was so easy to prepare. I put everything together the night before and baked in the morning and it turned out fabulously. I did add cooked turkey bacon instead of ham, half cheddar soup and half potato soup (per the recommendation of other reviewers), chopped green onion, garlic, and mushrooms! The flavor was wonderful!

All of my children, husband and grandchildren liked this. It's a take on scalloped potatoes and ham, but a much easier version with the shredded potatoes I used. I didn't change a thing and I'm still amazed it doesn't need any additional ingredients...like salt and pepper. You won't go wrong if you put this in your recipe box. Christmas brunch was a success with this as one of the main stays. My picky eaters even liked it.

I usually make this without ham as a side dish to almost any meat. It tastes so much better using potato soup than the other cream soups other recipes use. Take these to gatherings, they go fast and I requests for them all the time.

I make this for my family for almost every holiday breakfast. I also make it for our annual family breakfast before walking in the "Breast Cancer Awareness" walk. I always have people ask me for the recipe. It is so easy, but it looks like it took all day to make.

This is my favorite casserole for leftover ham. It's easy, it's flavorful, and it feeds a lot of people. I sometimes add a can of green chilis and/or some mushrooms.

I am always on the lookout for breakfast foods that my 1 1/2 year old will eat other than eggs and pancakes and she DEVOURED this. It was quick and delicious and it made a lot so I was able to freeze some for later. This is a great recipe for a picky eater and will definitely become part of our regular rotation. Would be really yummy with eggs, too!

I made this today and it was excellent!  Changed just a few things.  I left the Parm. Cheese out, I thought this would make it too salty.  I also used a pound of ground sausage instead of the ham.  Other than that I followed the recipe. Cooked it for 40 minutes covered with foil and then 20 minutes uncovered! New family favorite! I think next time I might add some crushed red pepper to give it a little zip. I also think this would be good topped with a little salsa when serving it.

The taste was very good, but the consistency was very liquid. I followed the ingredients and directions precisely, so I'm not sure why.  Perhaps it's because our family prefers a slightly crunchier consistency on casseroles.  I will try it again with either less condensed soup and/or sour cream, or halve the recipe and spread it out more in the same size pan to get a bit drier and crunchier casserole.

Made this last night for dinner and my family loved it. I used the O'Brien hash browns that had onion and peppers. I also didn't use sharp cheddar because I had a Costco sized mixed bag of cheddar/monterey jack. It turned out great. My family requested that it go onto the list of make again meals.

On its own, this is a great starter recipe. I make several adjustments, but this has good fundamentals. It's bland, so season well. Experiment with different cheeses and meats. Bacon, Sausage, Eggs, Cheddar, Colby Jack, etc. The key to the flavor is the Cream of Potato soup, it is unique from the other cream of soups (chicken, mushroom, etc.). Gives it a nice tang when mixed with the sour cream. Great for breakfast or dinner.

I like it actually as a side. As a main dish this is lacking some protein. I agree with another reviewer, egg is missing.

This recipe was defintely tasty.  The only change I made was I used fresh potatoes that I grated.  Now, that seems silly because frozen is so much easier, but I had potatoes I was trying to use up.  I grated them, soaked them, drained them, and wrung them out in a towel.  I did not precook them.  I mixed everything together and baked just like the recipe said. (I did add a little thyme, too, which was yummy).  The end result was yum!  I left off a star because I was hoping the hashbrowns would get brown and crispy on top - which may have happened if I had used frozen potatoes, I don't know.  But it was a little on the mushy side.  But the flavor was fantastic!!!  Will definitely try this again!

Delicious!  I was looking for a breakfast casserole that didn't include eggs and this was just perfect.  I used tater tots for kid appeal and it was a big hit.

It was delicious! Not exactly the healthiest, but delicious! I had a group of moms ask for the recipe! The only thing I did differently was to add a little bit of milk to the mixture because it looked too clumpy. And it tasted just fantastic. Thanks!

Outrageously good. I'm considering this for an office potluck. I used hash brown patties, chopped into quarters. No ham or parmesan, but used chopped green pepper instead. Fantastic.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe...we got tons of leftovers for lunch!
I did make one small adjustment that may solve the salty problem. Neither one of us eat ham, so I used cooked chicken and some turkey sausage. Turned out great!

Instead of topping with the parmesan I used a little of the cheddar cheese that the recipe called for.  Otherwise, I find dishes like this become too salty and rich.  Big hit.

I made this recipe yesterday for a family who lost someone, and they loved it. I made an extra one for my family, who also really enjoyed it. The only thing that I would probably do different the next time is add a little more ham, and use a different brand of hashbrowns. I used OreIda, and the potatoes were diced a little too large, so it didn't soften up as much as I would have liked. Also, I used a little colby jack and Montery Jack on top before adding shredded parmesan, because I didn't quite have enough parmesan, and everyone loved the top crust.

very good recipe. as mentioned is good for a breakfast or brunch casserole, but also great as a side dish.  the only change I made was to not put as much parmesan cheese on top (just sprinkled a little on it), mainly because I thought 1 1/2 cups would be too much.  Receives great reviews wherever I take it.

Used 1 condensed cheddar and 1 cream of potato soup.  I also used pork sausage instead of bacon.  It was good.  A usual comfort food creamy casserole.  The whole family liked.

Yeah, this is amazing! I added yellow squash and onion to help me not feel too guilty about the sour cream and cream of potato. I still feel the guilt, but it was totally worth it.

This is a great casserole.  The soup and sour cream make it creamier than most.  It was delicious.  When I served it I nestled some poached eggs on the top and served it with home made biscuits.  Yummy.

I gave it four stars as it sounds very nice. My only problem is that in South Africa we don't get frozen hash browns, would it work if I made and cooked my own first and then combined it with all the ingredients. Do the frozen hash browns in the US come already cooked or do you fry them first before adding to the ingredients.

We did this dish for breakfast for 260 (scaled up of course) hungry girl campers.  Needless to say, it was a HUGE hit!  Was done exactly as recipe called for except cutting back on the cheese a little.  Even better as left overs the next day.

I tried to make this recipe multiple times.  No matter what I did the end result was not smooth.  I don't like crunch to the potatoes.  Probably more my error than from the recipe but it just didn't work.

I have had this recipe on hand for about 3 years now, and it is a STAPLE in family brunch gatherings!!! DO NOT substitute any other ingredients!!! It is perfect the way it is. I do, however, add a little bit more cheese, because who doesn't love cheese!? Such a great recipe. If I can give it 10 stars, I would!

This was delicious. I added extra ham and cut down on the sour cream solely for preference. This was a great recipe to use up leftover ham.

Far too rich for breakfast...would work much better as a side for dinner.  I added a can of mushrooms and a tsp of garlic powder.  I also scaled it down to 6.  I may make this again, but only for dinner.

I ate this all week and still enjoy it! My grocery store was out of hashbrowns so I used Tater Tots instead. They disintegrated but the flavor was still great!

I have made this twice.  the first time, I made it without making any changes. The 2nd time I used diced, not shredded hash browns, and mixed it with 1 can of cream of potato shop, and 1 can of cheddar cheese shop.   I also mixed in 3/4 of the cheddar cheese, and put the rest of the cheese on top about 10 mins before it was done.  I like it both times, my husband likes the 2nd one best, but he is a major cheese lover.

Thought this was pretty good.  Made mostly as written, but a few alterations.  My pkg of shredded hash browns was only 30 oz.  Let it thaw in the fridge for a few hours before mixing.  Used a bit more ham to make up for the missing potatoes and since I was using this as a main dish.  I used the real parmesian - not the stuff in the can.  It was expensive and I didn't feel that it added much to the dish.  Next time I will either leave it out completely or replace with a different cheese.  I served this with turkey sausage links on the side.  I can see how this would be good without the ham as a potato side dish.  Would go well with bbq.

My husband and daughter loved this recipe. I thought it could use some salt and pepper, but they liked it as it. We did all agree that I should add some onion, green pepper, and tomato next time, but this is an excellent starter recipe, and I plan to prepare it with minor alterations again and again!

Hoooooly cow!  This is the tastiest, easiest thing I've ever eaten!!!!  It's so easy and makes for great leftovers!  I add a couple of tablespoons of Cajun Seasoning to make it less bland, but that's just because I use cajun seasoning in almost everything, lol.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!!!!

I used one can of cream of potato and one can of cream of chedder cheese. I also put all of the shredded cheese on top since I put the can of cheese in it. Also topped with some shredded onion and garlic salt. It was ok, but not spectacular. It somehow seemed like too bland and too strong of a flavor all at the same time.

This is a FAVORITE in my family and I have made it several times!!  My kids are picky eaters, but they cheer when they see that I am cooking it.  I follow the recipe as it is except I use one can cheddar cheese soup and one can potato soup.  Also, I add chives and chopped onions.  Absolutely DELICIOUS!! My husband says it is better than cracker barrel's hashbrown casserole which has been his all time favorite for years.  Try it! You won't be dissappointed.

YUMMY! I followed this recipe to a T! We loved it and so did my inlaws! This is a family fave! Not too salty or runny at all! I would bake it in a bigger dish than 9x13, this makes a lot!

This was way to rich for my taste.  I made the recipe precisely except I use cream of mushroom.  I couldn't find cream of potato.  It was too salty and too bland, all at the same time.  I didn't care for it, though my sister did.  I won't be making it again.  Thank you though for posting it.

I use the cheaper store brands and follow the recipe exactly. It is always delicious as is and everyone loves it. I made it with sausage once, but it was not as good so I will only use ham in this recipe from now on.

WONDERFUL!!  I made this casserole for a Mother's Day brunch and it was a hit!  I didn't add the ham because some my guests don't eat meat. However I add the Durkie canned onions for extra flavor. This recipe is a keeper!!

Made this tonight and the family loved it.  My husband said it was a new favorite--a real keeper!  I added about a 1/4 diced onion for flavor and 2 very small diced orange peppers (trying to sneak some veggies in for the kids).  They didn't notice the peppers and I don't think it changed the flavor at all.  I used a little less parm than called for based on other reviews.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

This was good, but not as a main dish.  Per my husband and I both thought it was more of a side dish (maybe due to so much potatoes).

This is a great and easy recipe, but I'm giving this 4 stars b/c I think it needs to be spiced up a bit.  Next time, I will add jalopenos, onions, and probably bacon and this will be GREAT.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The parmesan really gives it a different flavor.  Yum.  I just added pepper.

My fiancee has a potluck breakfast at work every Friday.  I make this every time that his department is responsible for bringing food, and there has NEVER been a single bite left over for him to bring home for me!  It is requested every time, and completely wiped clean!  We follow the recipe as written, but use the shredded Parmesan in a glass jar instead of the powdered stuff.

This review is coming from a bachelor whose idea of cooking is putting something in the micro for two minutes and consuming.  However, I am trying to expand my abilities and this was a GREAT start.  So good!  And so easy.  (That last part was for my fellow bachelors!!!)

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was real easy to put together. I didn't change the recipe except a little less Parmesan cheese, just a personal preference.

Edit 1/27/09

Made this with cream of mushroom soup. Also delicious that way.

Plate lickin' good! I had a few substitutes to clean out the fridge but this is a great base recipe. I added a bag of frozen veggie medley, which I definately recommend to give it more substance. Also, next time I will top with cracker crumbs for a nice crunch. There were NO leftovers!

I would highly suggest mixing the ham, soup, sour cream, & cheese all together first and then incorporating the hash browns in halves,  otherwise way too hard to get mixed well.   Easy to make and can be made the night before.  This fills a 9x13 dish.  I made this and it filled a 9x13 and a 8x8 dish which I am freezing to see if it will still be good made at a later date.

I made this exactly by the recipe and I was a little disappointed.  This recipe takes a lot of ingredients and therefore it is costly. We ate it as soon as it came out of the oven and it was good....but not worth the effort and cost in my opinion.  It was actually better the next day when we reheated it.  I will make something like this again in the future but will not use all these ingredients.

This is delicious. Turns out really rich... I'd like to try adding eggs to it next time. I didn't have any cream of potato soup so I substituted it with cream of mushroom instead and it was delicious.

This was delicious! Although, I could only find the cubed hash brown potatoes, and they weren't as tender as I would have liked. Next time I would thaw them a little bit before I put it in the oven. Over all this is amazing recipe! I made this for Christmas brunch, and it was a big hit!

We liked this. My husband is allergic to eggs and this is one of the first eggless breakfast casseroles that we've come across that we liked ... would probably add ham next time around and skip the parmesan.

I made this for a Christmas weekend breakfast and it was a hit all around, especially for me in the "ease of preparation" department.  I did use the Ore-Ida O'Brien potatoes for the onion and peppers and in the future may experiment with breakfast sausage instead of ham.  I've been asked (conscripted) to make this dish for a family gathering in the summer!

This was so easy to make!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  This recipe can easily be changed up by using bacon/sausage instead of ham, adding peppers, and other different ingrediants.  Thanks for the easy go-to breakfast dish.

Would give this 10 stars if I could!  Just took this casserole to work for our annual Christmas breakfast, and it was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it, and it was the first thing to go!  Lots of recipe requests.  Everybody said, is this a "clone" of Cracker Barrel's" recipe?  They loved it!  VERY simple to put together before work.  I love making people think I slaved....hehehe!  Thanks for this recipe PooBoo!  Goes into the "keeper" file for sure!

pretty good but next time i think i'll combine the sour cream, cheese, and soup separately, and throw in a cup of milk just to make it creamier.  also, i'm not sure the grated cheese is necessary at all.  next time i think i'll put more chedder cheese on the top.

This recipe is SO good exactly as written.  Do not change a thing.  It doesn't even need salt or pepper.  I didn't use the traditional string hashbrowns.  I used the hashbrown chunks and a maple ham.  Everyone raved about this casserole.  I will be making it for my husband's family on Christmas morning.  I can't wait until Christmas to eat it again.  You won't be sorry you made it.  Enjoy.

Delish!  I made this for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it.  I made it with fat-free sour cream and reduced fat parm cheese to cut down on the calories a bit.  Also skipped the ham.  I will definitely make this again soon!

I liked the addition of ham in this. My hash brown were thawed out and I only used one can of cream of mushroom soup with a little more than 16 oz sour cream. My 19 mo. old daughter loved this, but my 4 yr old won't touch anything with cream of ** soup in it. Thanks for the great recipe.

Really good! Didn't have cream of potato soup, used cream of mushroom instead. Also, I browned the hashbrowns a bit before mixing with the other ingredients. My family devoured it! Thank you for the recipe.

I am a broke college student that can not cook, but even I can make this! I can finally go to my family's Thanksgiving/Christmas dinners and have something to offer :)  Oh, for those of you that like adding the onions and peppers...OreIda has frozen hashbrowns with those peppers already in the bag.  BUT make sure you get 2 of them because they only have 20oz. not 30.

This was a good recipe. I like that you can really play around with the ingredients in this dish and use different cheese, meats and veggies. I will def make this again and play around with it a little.

I used fat-free sour cream and 2% milk sharp cheddar and it was still awesome.  No one could tell the difference.  I added some Panko bread crumbs on top of the parmesean for a nice crunchy top.

Great recipe!  Made exactly as shown, and comes out great every time.  May turn off some people who aren't fond of parmesean cheese, but you can't please everyone!  It adds just the right kick to enhance the flavor of the potatoes.  Make sure you get a good quality parmesean, or even better, grate it yourself!

This was yummy. I've been making a casserole very similar to this for years, minus the ham. Adding ham turns it from a side dish to a main dish, which is great! I served this with biscuits. Yummy!

This is a great recipe for leftover ham and doesn't necessarily have to be for breakfast.   I used a 4 ounce can of green chilies and added a ton of taste to this dish.     Great quick meal.

I rated this before but wanted to add something. I noticed someone commented that she didn't like the potato soup flavor in this recipe. I totally agree! It has a really funny taste. That was what was messing it up for me. So I substituted split pea soup and it is delicious! Plus, the kids (who love this stuff) get more veggies snuck in.

YUM!  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used 16oz of chopped ham and I also put this together the night before I needed it and let it come to room temperature for 30 minutes before baking it.  Delicious and easy!

Nice, but next time I might try sausage instead of the ham.  9x13 pan makes a lot.  My kids and I will get two meals out of it but I am going to have to freeze quite a bit.

I let my 2 boys rate this one since they have huge appetites - they both said 5 stars. I thought it was a little salty, but good otherwise. I sauted chopped onion and added it, tasty recipe.

I have to say that this recipe was tasty and simple to make. My husband and a neighbor thought it was also quite delicious. I did cut back on the parmesan topping since 1 cup looked adequate.

This is good.  I prepared this using o'brien hashbrowns to get the added flavor from the peppers and onions.  My husband wants more meat of course!  Using the o'brien mix did require additional cooking time, so next time I'll dice and cook my own until they are tender and then add them to the plain hashbrowns.  Will definitely be making this one again.

I really screwed this up and it was still good!  I used what I had instead of using measurements - I was pretty close.  I didn't have any soup - so I skipped it and I forgot the parmesan.  I gave this 5 stars because even when I messed it up, my family raved about it.  I was GREAT!

This is really, really good. I made a mistake and incorporated the parmesan instead of sprinkling it on top so I sprinkled some more cheddar on top. It turned out great. It is a DO OVER. :)

Greattt dish, i added finely chopped broccoli & used obrien hashbrowns (it has bellpepper & onion)and i also reduced the parmesan cheese to 1 cup & added 1/2 cup bread crumbs,gives the topping a more crustier top (the topping was my favorite) went well with the ham, potatoes & broccoli

Did nothing to change the recipe and it came out delicious and perfectly cooked.  Even my 15 month old ate it!  We used a smaller casserole dish and it fit perfectly and there were no leftovers because it was just that good!

Great dish!  Made this for a work potluck and came home with an empty dish and a couple requests for the recipe!  I will make this dish again but will increase the amount of ham.

The dish tasted very good. I followed the recipe, but adding 20oz of ham. However, the potatoes were not fully cooked after 1hr and both my fiance and I felt there still wasn't enough meat in the dish. I will cook this again but I will add even more ham and cook dish longer.

This is comfort food at its best! I love to make this when we have company over, its so easy to throw together. I double up on the hash browns & ham, and use 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of potato. I also like to add about 1/2 onion finely chopped. The casserole freezes nicely as well.

I made this recipe tonight. I had some leftover ham and didn't want it to go to waste. I found this recipe and it was a hit. No leftovers after an hour. Mind you, I have two teenagers and a few of their friends. Everyone loved this. I did use Cream of Mushroom instead of potato soup (it was what I had on hand), cut the sour cream down to 8 oz,used 4 cups of cheddar instead of parmasan cheese(again, what I had on hand). Next time I will follow the recipe to the letter and decide which I like best. Rave reviews from everyone at our house!

I added diced peppers, chopped onions and 2 cloves of garlic. Also topped with grated asiago cheese. Was very tasty but a bit too mushy for my liking. I think the next time that I make this I will brown up the hash browns first to toast up the dish. Reheates real well. Would be a 5 star if it was a bit more crunchy.

This turned out better then I thought. I used one bag of hash browns with onions and one bag of south western hash browns just to add some depth of flavor.

I make a very similar casserole w/o ham but with leftover holiday ham, I decided to make this.  I was tempted to use the cream of celery that I had on hand, but took another reviewers advice and went out for the cream of tator soup and am positive it make all the difference.  My recipe w/o ham calls for cream of chix and with the cream of tator it was way creamier!!!  SOOOOOOO good!!  We're going to crack a few eggs over the leftovers in the morning!!

Pretty good, but maybe a little too creamy.  I used some leftover ham, and also used hash browns with onions and peppers to give it some kick. Will definitely make this again.

The recipe is a little salty as is, but if you cut back on the cheese and add in some red bell pepper, mushrooms and onions, it's perfect!

This dish was fantastic! I made it to go with eggs on Christmas morning and it was a huge hit. We ate the leftovers with dinner. The only change I made was to use half sharp white cheddar with regular cheddar. Adding more ham would make this a good winter entree. I will be using this recipe A LOT!

This was a very good hash brown casserole. I won't say the ham added much, but we bought pre-packaged cubed ham that was cut up more. The green peppers are a great addition, and the cheese could be cut down some since the casserole was VERY cheesy. I used potato soup and a can of cream of mushroom because that is all I had. Very good on Christmas morning.

I thought this casserole was okay, but  nothing special.  The taste was quite bland as was the texture. I served it for Christmas brunch and no one took seconds.  When I consider the high fat content and the number of calories, I don't plan to make it again.  I will stick with the Spicy Sausage Quiche from this site.

Great recipe!

We used this for Christmas morning breakfast for three adults.  

We made some minor changes...

-cut the recipe down to three servings
-used mozzarella instead of sharp cheddar cheese
-baked in individual baking dishes (still for one hour)
-added one egg to each baking dish and mixed well

I had some problems with this recipe, I will try it again but make some changes.   My hash browns were not cooked through by the time the top was brown and the sides were bubbling.   It was very hard to mix up frozen hash browns and shredded cheese in a bowl, (was I doing something wrong?) once the cheese became cold it just formed a big ball, that I had to break apart with my fingers and try to spread out.  Also, the Parmesan cheese gave it a "funkie"  taste, per my roommate.  (too much?).
I gave it a 3 stars instead of a 2 stars because despite the parmesan cheese taste I did like the flavor and would try it again but I might thaw my hash browns for a bit before mixing, add more cheddar and leave off the Parmesan.  I also think it would be improved with pepper and onions.

This was good. I really enjoyed it, but my husband kept telling me ways to improve it, so for that reason I am only giving it a 4 instead of a 5. I was "advised" to add some seasoned bread crumbs to the top for more crusty/crunchiness to the top.

Everyone loved this - I made it exactly as stated.  You could eat this anytime of the day:  as a hearty breakfast - or as the main course at a casual dinner.
Don't sub the potato soup for another kind of soup - I think that is what makes it!

Wow, I was surprised to find out how much food this recipe made.  It lasted SEVERAL meals.  We used some diced up ham from the deli counter.  It would also be good with any other breakfast meat (sausage, bacon).  I put a little less sour cream and cheese than called for.  My husband accidentally got only 1 can of cream of potato soup, so I used one can of that, and one can of cream of mushroom soup, and it was perfect.  Next time I would make the whole recipe but split it into 2 dishes.

My family loves this dish. I will often make it ahead of time for them for dinner when I will be at work. Then my husband just pops it in the oven. I usually throw in some frozen green beans or green onions.

This is so good! I asked my hubby how he liked it, and all he said (with a mouthful of food) was "love it." I used sausage, as we are not huge fans of ham.

Not overly impressed - only change to the recipe was in using cream of celery because I couldn't find cream of potato. Flavor-wise, not very impressive.

This is very good and easy to make.  It is a good base recipe and great as it is, but you could add onions, peppers or bacon to spice it up further.  The kids and hubby love it, too!

I made some revisions as I went along.  I added an onion chopped, one stalk of celery choppped and on the top of the casserole I put crushed Ritz crackers and then topped with the Parmesan Cheese.  I also added salt and pepper in the mix.  This Recipe is GREAT!  My children liked it as well.

The family loved this recipe! I used 1 can cr of pot & 1 can cr. of celery b/c that is what had on hand. I was afraid of the parm cheese burning on top b/c of a dif review, but it turned out brown and crunchy. Delicious & cheesy!

Very good!  I substituted 1 can cream of celery soup for 1 can of cream of potato and liked that flavor.  Most cream soups would be good substitutes.  A bit too creamy texture when served the first day.  I liked the texture better as leftovers!  However, my bro-in-law raved and thought it was PERFECT!  Great recipe!  Will make again, but perhaps skimp a bit on the sour cream to firm it up a bit.

Wow! This was a BIG hit for Easter Brunch.  The ONLY thing I changed was the type of ham.  I used Tasso, which is a Canjun ham...slightly spicy...gave it a nice kick...Everyone asked for the recipe...and it turned out perfect...I even had it in my warming drawer for a while and it didn't dry out...it was perfect!

Not bad. I added a lot more ham than the recipe called for. I would not use it as a main dish but it would work well for a side dish at a brunch potluck type situation. Flavors were good/average - nothing spectacular though.

I made this for brunch this morning and it was a hit! I got lots of compliments and was told it is definitely a keeper! The only thing I did differently is I didn't use a ton of Parmesan Cheese on top...I just sprinkled it lightly. I used Ore Ida Potatoes O'Brien which has onions, green and red peppers. Very very good!

This was a tad creamy for my taste - too soupy. Next time I will use a bit less soup/sour cream for a firmer consistancy. Other than that it cooked beautifully and we all loved it - and did not miss all that butter that is in most recipes like this. I used the O'brien potatoes with the peppers and onions and was glad I did for more flavor. Will definately make again - in fact there is a pan in the fridge ready to go for brunch in the am!

I took these to my MOPS mtg and I have to say, they weren't a big hit.  I myself on the other hand thought they were good; although I don't know if I would serve them up for breakfast if the fam came in town.  I do absolutely recommend DOUBLING THE HAM...I used 16 oz diced ham and I think it could have used a bit more.  I also used the hash browns with onions and green/red peppers.  Did not add the Parmesan on top as I did not have any. Good creamy consistency, but I think it's more of a side dish than a main dish.

This was nice but a wee bit on the dry side for me.  I will make again but will probably try to make it a bit saucier!

I didn't have cream of potato soup so I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of celery soup. It turned out excellent. My family all had second helpings.

Got rave reviews for this at our last brunch. We try to reduce our fat intake, so I used fat free sour cream and 2% milk cheddar. I also omitted the parmesan cheese, and it was still a complete crowd pleaser. Not a bite was left.

I made this for a group of friends & family on a snowboarding trip. I was looking for a hearty breakfast to get us pumped for a great day. I had forgotten to refrigerate the rest of the casserole as we were in a hurry to hit the slopes. However to my surprise when returning to our cabin, the casserole was all gone! Everyone loved it! I will for sure make again!

This was good but very rich and very cheesy.  I will make it again but next time only use half of the parmesan cheese.

Naturally, I didn't follow the recipe exactly because my small town didn't carry the cream of potato soup.  I used cream of chicken soup and cooked, chopped country ham.  It made the casserole very salty so the second time I made it I eliminated the parm cheese.  It has been a huge hit every time!  It's also good in the slow cooker for a holiday meal.

I took this to a family holiday party recently and everyone RAVED about it - even an uncle who is extremely picky about what he eats.  I made two batches - one with the ham, and one with bacon. Both were yummy.  I also wanted to saute some onions to put in but didn't have the time, so just put a dash on onion powder.  I think it added to it nicely.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great recipe.  I took this to my boyfriends Christmas party at his work, and the pan was empty within 20 minutes!  Wonderful comfort food.  Rich, warm, creamy and cheesy.  The only thing I changed was the amount of parm that went on top.  I used only about 3/4 of a cup, and I think it was plenty.  All in all, easy to make and a pleasure to eat.

This was very good and got good reviews when I served it. However, I thought it was too creamy. Next time I make it I will probably only use 1/2 the sour cream. The other changes I made were to use 1 can of cheddar soup and 1 can of potato. I also omitted the parmesan and topped the casserole instead with more cheddar. Also, I added a red pepper and an onion. It was very good!

This recipe was pretty good - I wasn't jumping up and down over it...but it was cheesy and a warm, comforting dish. My husband mentioned that he thought it was missing something - like a crunchy topping. And, I agree. We love our hash brown casserole recipe with a cornflake topping - and adding some ham to it would (in our opinion) make a better casserole than this one.

This recipe is a fantastic base for all kinds of dishes. We really liked it, but we ended up adding ranch, chiles, and extra ground pepper after it was cooked to add flavor. It was a little bland. Overall, it gave us a ton of new ideas for next time. We will make it agian. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was wonderful! I have been making a ham and hash brown casserole for years that was one of my husband's favorite dishes. After I made this, he said "throw the other recipe away."
My other recipe uses a stick of butter (ugh) and is not nearly as moist and creamy. Will be our regular ham and hash brown casserole from now on!! Thanks!

Ican't say this was to die for but it was good and I will probably make it again. I only used 1/4 - 1/2 cup parm on top bbut other than that i followed the recipe.

I love potato recipes & this one was so good! I used 2% milk mild cheddar & only 1/2 cup parmesan cheese - otherwise, it was delicious as written! I didn't measure my ham & probably added more than written - but I served it for dinner and wanted it to have enough substance. Add some green onions & some fresh ground pepper...Great comfort food!

Very good.  The only thing I might try next time is to use one can of the potato soup and one can of cream of mushroom soup.  Everyone in my house cleaned their plates.  I also had enough leftover to freeze for another meal!

I must say that this recipe is fast and easy, but I wasn't crazy about the flavor.  It just seemed bit bland to me. Like others, I added sauteed onions and sprinkled the top with seasoned bread crumbs prior to baking. I don't think this one was worth the fat and calories.  Thanks anyway, Melissa!

Excellent recipe!  Used one can of Potato Soup and one can of Cream of Mushroom Soup.  Will definitely make this again but will follow some of the other reviewers suggestions and only use 8 ounces of sour cream and one one cup of grated Parmesan.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing Melissa.

I only gave this recipe 3* because the sauce was cloying, too heavy & too over powering.  I like bold flavors but this was way over the top.  I was thinking that I could add more potato next time but since it makes so much I think one can of soup & only 8oz of sour cream would be better.  Also 1 1/2c of parm was too much for us.  It made it too salty.  Buttered bread crumbs mixed with half the parm might be better.  I was thinking that spinach, asparagus or broccoli added would lighten this heavy cheesey casserole.

I halved this recipe since it was just for me, hubby, and little one this morning. I sauteed a bit of onion and added it (next time will also ad sauteed green pepper). I left out the ham (we had bacon on the side). I think I might try cream of mushroom soup next time, just for variety. Hubby put ketchup on his (yuck!) and gobbled it up. Very good.

This is a very good casserole and incredibly easy to make.  We used our leftover Christmas ham.  Because my 9 X 13 baking pan was still containing other leftovers, I split up the mixture to two different casserole pans.  Because the one was slightly smaller I had it in the over for about 10 minutes less.  The other pan was an 9 X 9 and I put it in the freezer for one of those nights when we don't feel like going through much effort for dinner.  Great recipe!

We loved this recipe!  I substituted the cream of potato for cream of mushroom, left the parmesian on top and did not cover.  It was crunchy and soooo good.  Lots of compliments, I will make this one over and over!

This was disappointing. Bland, heavy, and boring, and too rich to be a main course dish. I added black pepper and broccolli, if not for those additions I would not have eaten any of it.

This was just ok for us - way way way too much parmesan cheese which made it very salty.  I think 1/2 a cup would be plenty.  I don't think I'd make this again, but thanks!

I made this with left over chopped pot roast -- not the best choice, as this recipe definitely needs the ham for flavor.  I will try this again with ham.  The only other addition I made was adding asiago to top, which was delicious.

Easy and delicious. Was immediately devoured at the brunch I took it to.  Next time I will probably use a little less sour cream and more cheddar, but it was great as is.

This was on of the best casseroles!!! Keeper!!!  I took it to work the first time I made it and it was a hit.  I used low fat cheese, sour cream, soup and turkey-ham.  The next time I will add some green and yellow peppers for color!

Though too cheesy and mushy for us, I thought it was ok. But husband said don't make it again. The appearance did our son in, he wouldn't try it. Perhaps adding some color to the top, maybe parsley.

Made this for Christmas brunch and it turned out wonderful. I used the southern style hashbrowns (the little cubes) Everyone loved it! Very cheesy. I like things a little salty so I thought it was just right on the salt. Might try this with cream of mushroom soup next time.

I make this often, we love it. If I am more broke than usual I use turkey ham, it is not as good as the regular ham, but still very tasty.

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe but my family said it was ok.  I more than doubled the ham and my husband said it could have used more.

This was very good. I had a giant bag of potatoes and have been trying to use them up so I made my own cubed hash browns, it can out wonderfully. Next time I will try the frozen hash browns to save a whole lot of time, and maybe some onion.

I make a lot of brunch casseroles for playgroups that i'm in and i made this one today.  it was a huge hit!  i cut it in half for my small group of 6 ladies and i should've made the whole thing!  i used the tiny cubed potatoes since that was all i could find last night, and it was great.  will make again!

I hate to be in the minority here, but no one at my house liked this, but that could have been because of the ham.  It was one of the saltiest dishes I've ever tried.  I'm not sure how I could eliminate that.  Maybe cooking the ham prior to assembling?  I also didn't use all the parmesan cheese.  It seemed like way too much.  Only used 3/4 cup.  May try it again without the ham.

Delicious.  A hearty warm brunch dish.  I made this while entertaining friends one weekend and everyone devoured it.  I have been asked to share the recipe, and it was a definite hit! This is one of the best breakfast casseroles I have made.  I used regular sliced deli ham and cubed it up.  I would definitely make this one again.  It is easy to make and made the house smell all warm and yummy!

This recipe was great. A few changes I made were: added extra cheese and ham, actually used turkey ham. I also used low fat yogurt instead of the sour cream. It smelled great baking and tasted great when it was done. My son didn't like it, but I loved it. This will be my next pot luck dish.

I substituted one 12 oz. box of sausage links (I'm not crazy about ham) and 2 lbs. of tater tots for the hash browns. They worked just as well.

What a Gem of a recipe!! Thank You Melissa!! My newly wedded husband asked me to make something for a potluck at work...Engineers and they say their wives hate to cook. Not only did they LOVE it ( made as recipe is- no substitutions ) but, every potluck someone from his job will call me and Beg for it!! Last week one of them even detailed my car for taking some over to his wife at her job. This recipe is "Heaven Sent" for  potato lovin' people. Thanks again so Very much.

Excellent! Served at brunch and was a huge hit.  Used cheese soup and cream of onion. Put grated sharp chedder on top instead of parmesan.

I used southern style hasbrowns, and two cans of cream of chicken soup. I omitted the sour cream. 
I served this as a side dish with ham steaks. 
My family loved it. I will be making it again!

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch and it was great.  I couldn't find cream of potato soup so I used cream of mushroom and cream of broccoli.  It was delicious and got rave reviews.

Thank you, Melissa!  I needed a recipe that would please both my husband and my mother-in-law this past Mother's Day and this did it.  Everyone was very impressed and came back for seconds.

Made one pan for vegetarian daughter.   Omitted ham and doubled sour cream.   Second followed recipe as written.  Outstanding brunch item for Christmas decorating.

I took this dish to an after church social and everyone loved it.  I will definately make it again and again.  The only thing I changed was substituting a can of cheese soup for the potato and I added green onions.  It was super yummy.

This was okay, but not fabulous.  The boys liked it (do boys ever say no to meat and potatoes?) but I probably won't make it again.

I actually didn't even get to taste it because it was gone before I knew it!  Judging from that, I'd say it was pretty good.  I used cheddar on top.

Very good, but came out extremely salty - not sure which ingredient (or combo of ingredients) made it so salty, so I'm not sure how to fix it.  Next time, I'm going to add fresh diced onion as well.
