Tried this recipe and LOVED IT!!!  I always have to make "my own variation" of a recipe--so--
I reduced the butter to 2 tbs and also sprayed the entire baking sheet with butter flavored Pam, added Italian seasoned bread crumbs to the "taters" and sprayed butter flavored Pam on the tops before baking.  Then, I cooked it for 15 minutes each side---it was wonderful!! Crispy too!

I will never bread eggplant any other way!  I KNEW potato flakes were good for something aside from mashed potatoes!!  I added some parmesan, basil and no-salt seasoning to the mix and ommitted the salt, but next time I WILL add a little salt b/c I feel it was needed...  Also, make sure you use the full amount of butter or coat the slices with it before baking, b/c I cut the amount and some of my slices would not brown on both sides after I flipped them.  You could also spray these with nonfat Pam or an olive oil spray for a healthier version...  In any case, these are delicious and I will use potato flake breading for EVERYTHING!  Can't wait to try it on fish!!!

To be honest I am not to crazy about eggplant, but I did try this recipe and change the regular instant potatoes to Idahoan Loaded Baked (Blended with butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon, onion & chives) and used 1 tsp of cayenne pepper.  Served them with some homemade salsa...and my friends could not keep from raving about the new appetizers I served.

Very good!  My husband who "normally doesn't like eggplant" had two slices and my 8 year old son ate three slices.  Admittedly, I did doctor the recipe a bit by adding some Italian seasoning and fresh grated parmesan cheese to the potato flakes.  I will serve this again.

This recipe is a great one to 'build' on!  I modified by adding ground parmesan, Italian bread crumbs, and powdered garlic to the potato flakes.  My potatoes were low sodium so I had to add some salt.  Also, I used half the butter and added some olive oil and sprayed tops with canola nonstick spray.  I didn't flip'em, they really didn't need it, but next time I may do that because they were a 'little' crunchier on the bottom.  This was my sons (12 yo) first go at eggplant, needless to say he intitially said "ain't gonna do it"  but he tried a bite and then ate 3 slices!  Imagine that... ;-)

Be sure to cut the eggplant in thick slices - mine were too thin and tasted disturbingly like potato chips!

I made these as an appetizer the other day but used zucchini instead of eggplant and red-skinned (rather than plain) instant potatoes.  I also used only about 3 tablespoons of butter because that's all I had and they came out great.  My friend and I devoured the whole pan and she had warned me ahead of time that she didn't like zucchini at all.  They came out great -- very flavourful, not too buttery or greasy.  I'm definitely looking forward to trying this again with the eggplant!

We have fresh thin eggplant from our garden. I use "butter and herb" potato flakes. To simplify I use small plastic sandwich bags for the egg and for the potato flakes. Shake the eggplant slices and follow recipe. Yum !

I tried this for supper tonight. Hubby was skeptical at the idea, but is now raving about it - and wants more!  

I added parmesan and garlic pepper to the potato flakes, did NOT add the salt, and used only as much butter as I needed for the amount of eggplant I was cooking.  The eggplant came out crispy  and very tasty.

Delicious!  To lower fat and calories, I used 2 Tbsp. of light margarine instead of butter.  I also sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top of each slice before serving.  This dish reminded me of fried eggplant, but without the guilt.

Gotta love a versatile recipe like this!  But I couldn't leave well enough alone, of course.  My modifications: Omitted the butter and used parchment paper on a sheet pan. Used one egg plus about two tablespoons of Italian dressing and two tablespoons of creamy Caesar dressing then dipped in the potato flakes with some additional parm and cracked black pepper.  Sprayed the tops with a little Pam and baked them at 350 for about thirty minutes and did not turn them.  They were delicious and disappeared at dinner!

This was very tasty, just like fried eggplant!  It's a great way to get the fried taste without stinking up your kitchen with a pot of grease.

I followed the recipe and then after I turned them I topped each with a dollop of pizza sauce and shredded cheese.  Doing this made it possible for me to fool my 3 year old into thinking they were little pizzas!  Worked like a charm and tasted great!

We LOVED this dish!  I made it with 2 eggplants and there was almost none left and just the 2 of us eating!  MMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM good!  I did add parmesean cheese on top and when I flipped them I added more potato flakes as some fell off when I flipped them.  We love this!

What a time saver!  Frying in batches takes forever, I will probably always use this method now.  I added some seasoning to the tatos, garlic and onion powder, pepper. I used olive oil instead and it worked great, maybe add a bit more when you flip them. thank you for the recipe, we will have eggplant more often now!

This was out of this world!  My hubby loves eggplant but I've never had it.  I grew it this year in the garden and was ready to try it.  I have the white eggplant.  I used 2 small/med sized and it made about 12 slices.  I used garlic flavored potato and added a small heap of marinara then a mozzarella/parm mix to the tops for the last 5 minutes.  Will be making this until all the eggplant is gone!  ps...hubby and I ate it ALL!

This is fabulous! I added panko (Japanese breadcrumbs - flaky, sweet and crunchy) to the potato mix and used a little olive oil in the baking pan as well as spraying olive oil on top of the eggplant before flipping over.  No need for butter and olive oil is healthier.  Love parmesan cheese in the mix, too!

DELICIOUS!  I used 2 TBSP of butter and about 3 or  TBSP of canola oil instead 1/4 cup of butter to cut down on the saturated fat.    Try using flavored (garlic or cheese) potato flakes.  This is going to be a regular for me.

This one went over pretty well. I'm pretty sure no one in my house was eager to eat eggplant but they did agree that they would eat it again. No leftovers.

i give it 3 stars 'cause frankly the bad outcome might have been my fault. i didn't measure the pepper and added way too much, the same w/ the salt so it came out inedible. it was a large eggplant too and i was excited to try it 'cause all the rave reviews. i tried 1 peice, it looked appetizing enough and smelled good, but due to the salt/pepper i couldn't really enjoy the taste. had to throw out. it's the first time i've thrown out anything. ever. :(

My husband is not a fan of eggplant, but loved this.  I only used 2 T butter and it was still a little greasy for my taste.  I will try again next time with olive oil.  Also, added some breadcrumbs and garlic powder to mashed potato flakes.

This was AWESOME!!!!  I added some onion & garlic powder and parmesan cheese to my flakes.  Turned out crispy on outside and perfectly cooked eggplant on inside.  I ate mine with a little bit of warmed up spaghetti sauce (I didn't have marinara :)).

Fantastic!  Really tastes like battered deep-fried eggplant, with a soft inside
and fairly crispy outside.  I found it hard not to eat all four servings
myself in one sitting.  Despite not adding any salt, I found these a
tad salty simply from all the salt in the mashed potato flakes I used.  So
don't add salt! Like other reviewers, I only used two
tablespoons of butter because that seemed like plenty (and would make the
recipe healthier).  (Remember, all the butter gets soaked up by the
eggplant, and the recipe calls for a lot of butter!)  As an experiment, I
once added a little more butter when I flipped the eggplant, and those pieces
ended up a little too buttery/greasy for me, though others may like them
that way.  Incidentally, I found I needed two eggs.

I'm always looking for different ways to serve veggies, and this recipe was very good!  I would cut back on the butter next time and also try some of the other suggestions for added seasonings (just for variety -- it's quite tasty the way it is).

An ok way to prepare eggplant, with the added benefit that it's gluten-free.  I coated both sides of the eggplant.  The coating stayed on nicely, but didn't brown as much as I would have liked, even after leaving in the oven for an extra 10 minutes.  I think it would be better with a little more flavor, so I might try adding some spices and maybe some parmesan cheese to the potato flakes before dredging next time.  My son, who normally loves eggplant, did not like this recipe at all because of the potato taste.

My wife and I really love this recipe.  We spice it up a little with more black pepper and cayenne pepper.  Also added some parmesan cheese to the potato flakes. I also added beer to the egg mixture. This is a keeper and we have been blessed with more eggplant this summer than we knew what to do with.

This would have gotten five stars, but I did have to cook it a lot longer than 20 minutes and I had to use an extra egg.  Otherwise: fantastic!!!  I sliced the eggplant more like 1/2" thick, so I had about five slices leftover that I couldn't fit on the pan (saving those for later!).  I used the cheap instant mashed potatoes that are flavored, in buttery homestyle flavor, and added 1/4 t. garlic.  The eggplant was cooked until the slices were brown and the potato flakes were crispy.  Not the least bit soggy and, actually, only a hint of the eggplant flavor given the thinness of the slices.  Next time I might try slicing the eggplant a little thicker but the thinness is great for people who don't necessarily love eggplant as much as others.

This rivals a classic hors d'oeuvres offered for sometime in a local high-end restaurant.
4-12-13:  Second time was as good as the first.

Delicious, quick & easy. I ammended it a little, I used 4 cheese potato flakes & added 1/2 tsp onion powder to egg mixture. My 7 yr old does not like vegetables, she gobbled this down & was asking for more!

I would give this recipe 4 stars for easy and simplicity, but I found the taste to be just a tad bland.  I like my eggplant cooked a little spicier.  Nice recipe though.

It was OK, both 15 year old and 11 year old girls liked it better than I did. My 15 year old gave it 4 stars. I tweaked it a bit. First off, used olive oil to coat the pan, why use butter? Olive oil made so much more sense. Then added Creamy Italian dressing to TWO eggs, and then added a great garlic seasoning that has Parmesan cheese in it to the instant potato's. Cut at a bit larger than an inch, and two slices per person were enough. Will slice it thinner next time. Finishing another small batch in the oven as I type this. We also added Parmesan cheese when we took it out of the oven. Served it with pasta, and it was a great meal, and very filling. Was very fast and easy to make. I look forward to trying it with zucchini this summer.

I really liked these, my husband just looks at me when I try to give him eggplant [not one of his favorites] So I'm not adding his or my sons reveiw. Any way I had 'Butter and Herb' potatoe flakes; Just alittle salt afterwards. YUM. I have a spray bottle of " I Can't Beleive It's Not Butter," No calories, I used that to spray on them.

the tastiest, easiest, and fastest "oven-fried" eggplant i've found.  i added garlic salt and black pepper to the tater flakes and left the egg wash plain, i then used unsalted butter. the simple, clean flavors are perfect with your favorite marinara, tzatziki, curried yogurt, or even ranch :)

My neighbor gave me several eggplants the other day and I found this recipe. I have haunting memories of my mom "hiding" eggplant in everything as a kid- so I wanted something good! lol  My 10 yr old daughter and I LOVED this recipe! The only thing different I did was put a pinch of shredded colby jack cheese on top and let it melt. Yummo! Very good dipped with BBQ sauce too. I told my mom and that I'd made an eggplant dish and she laughed and said "Your kidding!" We've actually made this about 3 times so far. Now I've got to get some more from my neighbor!

This was o.k. It tasted more like potato than eggplant. I parmed what I had left and it was really good. I will probably stick with my regular recipe for parm though because of time.

DH has grown eggplant for 3 years and this is the first time I have liked this veggie. I used no butter - just PAM - and added cayenne and Italian seasoning with Parmesan on top. It took more potatoes than the recipe called for.

I tried some peeled and unpeeled and liked the unpeeled ones better.  Overall very good although the microwaved leftovers tasted better the next day--more time for the flakes to get mushy I guess!   It sure is hard to get clumpy mashed potato flakes off your fingers!!

First, I peeled and sliced the eggplant. Laid out on a paper towel and salted. Let it sit for about 10 minutes. Rinse and continue. After reading reviews, I only used 2T butter which seemed like plenty. I added about 1/2 cup italian bread crumbs and a teaspoon of italian seasoning to my potato flakes and NO salt. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll try some parmesan cheese in the flakes and more seasoning. They were very good but I feel like they need a little kick of something.

I enjoy eggplant, but haven't found a fried eggplant recipe that doesn't use oil on top of the stove.  I didn't taste like a grease pattie.
I have shared this recipe with friends and they have enjoyed it as much as myself.

Needs to have a bit more flavor so I added garlic powder, parmesan cheese, basil, and oregano to the potato flakes.  Also, cooked them in a skillet and that works out very well.

Fabulous! I cut mine into thick chunks and only used a tablespoon or two of butter to cut fat and calories and it still came out nice and crispy. I'm going to save this recipe because it would be a great way to prepare the eggplant for Eggplant Parmesan without having to fry it first.

Sliced the eggplant in 1/2" slices. Put cayenne, chili powder, and garlic in the egg (used 4 eggs for a large eggplant) wash...  Also seasoned the potato flakes with cayenne, garlic, salt, pepper and grated Parmesan.  Spray pam in pan and the butter in half way through preheat process. Fantastic!

This is now my favorite way to make eggplant. I have also used this to make moussaka and shepard's pie (using the eggplant on the bottom)  I tried it with green tomatoe's and since that was so good, I'm going to try zucchini!

I have made this with eggplant and zucchini.   Both come out just delicious!   I find that I don't have to use as much butter as recommended, but otherwise, I follow the recipe.   Really yummy and my kids love them!

Great idea. The mashed potatoes got crispy - it was close to fried eggplant. But, it did need a good bit of seasoning in the mashed potatoes - they were bland by themselves. A good bit of salt and pepper helps, from there, go with Italian, Greek, herbs d' provence, etc.  Thanks for posting -

Thank you!! I needed a new recipe for eggplant and found this one to be great. I did add some parmesan, italian seasoning and basil to the potato flakes.

This recipe was delicious. My husband also was complaining about eggplant for dinner but ended up eating more than half of the eggplant. I used the rest of the mashed potato flakes to bread pork chops the next night and it was awesome. It was like having mashed potatoes with our pork! Maybe I'll try chicken next...

I had some Japanese eggplant from my garden that needed to be used up. This was perfect. Because of the long, thin shape, I cut the eggplant into wedges about 4" long. I also had a zucchini from the garden that I cut into rounds. I'm always suspicious of a recipe that calls for a 450 degree oven (easy to burn and dry out ingredients). Thanks to my digital oven controls I was able to cook the vegetables at 420-435(I started out at 420, then upped to 435 after turning.)The results were wonderful. What a nice recipe. We will make this again and again. Served it with marinated steak tips and chicken breasts from our local market. An easy and delicious late summer mid-week dinner.

my husband looked pretty disappointed at dinner when i said we were having eggplant... but he loved it and ate it up - yay! I used margarine instead of butter and added some extra spices like other reviewers said... I had a lot leftover and saved the potato flakes for another time... I think this would be a great way to dip zucchini rounds as well... I will make this again - it's easy and tastes great... though a bit on the salty side - i'd use 1/2 teaspoon salt instead.

This was pretty good, not my favorite way to prepare eggplant but a nice alternative. I think next time I might mix this with a bit of cornmeal to get more of a crunch.

I haven't made this recipe yet so I can't review it.  I just wanted to tell you all to check the sodium content of the potato flakes.  Some brands are higher than others and that will effect the outome of the recipe.

The texture's awesome--golden brown and crispy on the outside, smooth and creamy on the inside. 

I made the recipe a wee bit more heart-friendly by using olive oil instead of butter, but otherwise followed the directions as given. 

The results were VERY salty, with little other flavor. I love eggplant, so I wasn't unhappy, but if I were to prepare this again I'd add onion powder and maybe a hint of garlic powder to the egg mixture, and probably cut out the salt altogether (it's as easy to salt something like this on the plate, to taste).

Very tasty! Fried taste, without the greasy, heaviness.
Made as directed, but added in some extra spices: oregeno and basil.

Good, but I thought the breaded eggplant cutlets were way too salty. No other reviewers had mentioned this, so I thought that maybe I'd accidentally used too much salt.  That wasn't the case.  I used 1 tsp as the recipe calls for.  I will make this again, but only use maybe a 1/4 tsp next time.

These were good, reminiscent of fried zucchini...which would probably work too. I added Italian panko breadcrumbs, salt & pepper and some dried Italian parsley to the taters. Upon serving, I topped them with Parmesan cheese and served with French onion dip, which worked great. I also think these would work well topped with a little mozzarella and marinara.

2nd Time: Made these again and OMG, these are so good...low-cal too! One of my new favs for sure.

This is the first time I have ever had eggplant and I think it was ok.  It was a little mushy and not much flavor to me.  I think if I try it again I will make that casserole with the spaghetti sauce.  My husband has had eggplant before in a Greek dish and I told him he could make it for me.  I did just what it was called for.

This is my favorite eggplant recipe.  I  grow one plant in my garden (they are prolific!) and pick the eggplant just before
making this.  They frequently don`t make it to the table as we just eat them off off the pan.  They are even good cold from the frig  (leftovers).  I mix plain potatoes with some flavored and it is perfect..

I typically bread my eggplant in flour and breadcrumbs and fry, but this was a lovely change. The potato flakes crisp up nicely and add a different flavour to the eggplant. I will likely try this again.

I usually make the same recipe but with deep-frying instead of using the oven, and using breadcrumbs instead of the potato flakes. This time, I made it in the oven and loved it. I also added some shredded cheese right after I took the eggplants from the oven. One more thing I do differently is that I dip the eggplants lightly in flour. Thanks for sharing.

If you stick to the recipe, I'd have to give it a 3 because of it's blandness.   However, it is a great base.  I will say that I used the footnote method and used the frying pan since I didn't have a baking dish that would hold all the eggplant.  I fried a couple to taste, then I had to make some changes.   To improve, just add your own spices.  I subbed garlic salt for reg to the egg mixture.  I also added garlic powder and parm cheese to the potato mixture. This helped. I will make again, but I will have to add to the recipe.

Excellent!  I love eggplant but hate that it's like a sponge when you fry it and it absorbs all the oil.  This was a quick healthy alternative to previous attempts and I actually got my husband to do a "taste test"....he went back for seconds.  Now that I have a good base to work with, the sky is the limit!   Great input with all the reviews and, truthfully, I thought it tasted like a potato patty!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I just got done making this dish. Have to remind myself not to use salted butter. I got double bombed with salt. Had some trouble getting the instant mashed potato to stick. So what I had left I threw all of it together and mixed it. Then poured it in a pan. Other than that, I loved it. I will make it again. I also added some sharp shredded cheese after it was baked.

substitued red potatoes chopped finely instead of fake potatoes.

This recipe looks great and I can't wait to try it!  Do you know if I can substitute potato flour instead of the mashed potato flakes?  I have some in the cabinet that I need to use up.

I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was good, but I like my food with a little more spice. I absolutely loved the texture. I will certainly make it again, but with a little more flavor.

Ok, this sounds interesting, however the butter burnt before the oven preheated, so perhaps melting another way or perhaps a lower temp.  I will try a couple different "oil" solutions, especially to cut down on fat calories and still see if this works. Am always looking for ways to "create" the fried thing, without the calories!

These were good, except it took forever to cook because you can't fit very many slices on a cookie sheet at one time. So I had several batches to make. Other than that, this recipe got my kids to eat eggplant, which I thought would never happen :)

My husband and I thought this recipe was very good. I inadvertantly cut some slices 1/2 inch and some 3/4 inch. We preferred the 1/2 slices. That is the only thing I would do differently next time and there will definately be a next time.

Followed recipe exactly. Rather bland. May be OK if you punch it up a bit w/ more spices. Didn't brown up as nicely as shown in the photo so I had to slide them under the broiler to make them less sickly looking. Would of been nice if the flavors blended more but was 2 distinct flavors of crispy mashed potato and eggplant. I stick w/ eggplant parm.

These were sooo good. I was skeptical when I saw "potato flakes" but I tried it anyway. They were so good that we ate them like potato chips. They never did make it to the dinner table as an eggplant parmesan dinner. Be sure not to scimp on the butter and brown them well. They will come out cripsy and addicting.

Really good. Also threw a few cauliflower florets in there done in the same manner and they were also very good. Can't wait to try green tomatoes this way but thanks to our drought, I don't have any. Maybe next year.

Made this tonight and my husband and I thought it was overwhelmingly tasteless and dry even though I added spices to the potato flakes.  Instead of butter I sprayed the cookie sheet with olive oil Pam.  I love eggplant and this dish made me not like it at all.......

This was a pretty good way to use eggplant. I would give 5 stars but felt that as written it would have been oily and very bland. I used about 2/3 of the butter called for, added garlic pepper to the egg and used roasted garlic mashed potato flakes instead of plain in addition to adding salt and pepper. With those changes there weren't any leftovers. Thanks for a great starter.

Unfortunately, this one wasn't a hit with the family. It definetely needs more seasoning, where eggplant is such a bland veggie. I love eggplant, but wouldn't make this again. Sorry!

Though this was edible, the crust tasted a bit like overcooked potato chips. (And I didn't over cook) I won't be making this again.

I like this reciped cooked in the oven better than on the stovetop. Crispy outside. Sprinkled parmesan cheese on after turning. After reading other reviews, I decided to add salt after they were cooked rather than into the egg mixture. I will use this recipe again.
