It was delicious!  I refrigerated the avocado before making this.  I used almond milk and I did add some ice cubes.  I added some cocoa powder to make it more chocolate and added a banana.  My kids loved it and didn't even know there was an avocado in it (until they were done and I told them).

I am not a big avocado fan but based on reviews decided to try this recipe when my mother-in-law brought an avocado to my house. Recipe did not describe the size avocado. Mine was large and I found I needed to add more milk and sugar. After these revisions it still seemed to lack something so I plucked some fresh mint from the garden and added a handful. That improved it tremendously, but I am still not sure I would make it again.

You can barely taste the avocado which I like. Tastes like a milkshake! So so good.

I used a very small avocado, soy milk instead of regular milk and Splenda instead of sugar. I like my beverages super cold but since my shake came out extremely thick I did not dare add ice and thicken it more.   It does have good flavor but the draw back that I found this shake to have....it is not cold.

It tastes like an ice cream milk shake! I used agave syrup instead of sugar but kept the amounts the same. I might lessen the sugar next time, but think it is a great drink as written. Thank you for the recipe.

Taste was okay- it did not set up well- so it was more avacado milk, not milkshake.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. Yes, I made a little change by using two cups of coconut milk, one tablespoon of peanut butter, half of an avocado and one banana. Boy it was delicious! Thank you for introducing the avocado smoothie.I am doing one tomorrow morning. A yes on my smoothies list for sure!
