This was satisfying...but.  I feel like it's missing that oooomph.  Maybe adding some onions to the mushrooms as they cook would do it, I don't know.  It's good as stated, but I will play around with it the more I make it.  I would also try stirring in some sour cream at the end as I think it would give it an added something.  As a side note, I didn't see the relevance to cooking the peas seperately...so, I simply threw them into the mushroom soup/milk mixture when it was time to add my rice.  They cooked up just fine that way.  Thanks, this is a decent side dish and I will make it again!

I am not really a fan of using cream of mushroom soup in alot of recipes. I feel it seems to be used way too often. However, I took a chance on this one and I really liked it. Next time, I may try with Cream of Chicken.

Good recipe.  I altered it bit due to what I had on hand.  First, I just had the boil'n'bag rice, so I precooked it about 8 mins before I put it in the soup mixture. Next, I had some red, orange, and yellow bell peppers on hand so I diced those up, sauteed them a bit and stirred them in, and I also add a pinch of cayenne pepper to brighten up the flavors.  It made lots.  I can also see that this would make a great chicken or turkey casserole.  If I make this again and have some slivered almonds on hand I'd probably add those too.  Very verstile recipe.  Thanks for sharing with us.

YUM!  It came out great.  I sauteed and added onion and garlic. I also used canned mushrooms and saved the juice to add a bit at the end to make the rice more creamy.  Good flavor!

Didn't care for this at all.  It was pasty.  Maybe made with "regular" and not instant rice, would make it better.

This made a great pot full of comfort food, sort of a nice, down-home, tasty casserole type of thing.

This recipe was a disaster. The rice refused to cook, and I had to keep on adding water. it still ended up uncooked. I won't be making this recipe again.

My family enjoyed this.  I did add some light soy sauce, minced garlic and onion while sauteing the mushrooms for a little more flavor.  The soy sauce really gave it the right kick. This has become a keeper in my house

This was bland to me as well.  I expected the soup to give it more flavor.  Maybe some cream of chicken would add a little more salt and savor to it?

Sounded really good - was okay.  I used part precooked wild rice and part instant rice - I am sure this picked it up if anything.

This turned out way too soupy for me.   Blah flavor even when I tried to add things to kick it up a notch like minced onion and garlic powder.   I will not make again.

This was a great quick and easy side dish. I recommend it for those days when your main dish is done and you are searching for sides, you get your carbs and veggie in one POT!!

This is a tasty side dish.  I made a few little changes. I added some chopped onion to the mushrooms.  I used 1/2c. partially cooked Nishiki rice, drained (don't care for for instant). Used a whole box of peas.  And otherwise followed recipe as is.  Will make again!

The kids and husband loved it. The 4 year old ate all of it. I wasn't a big fan. Next time I'll add more salt and make sure to use the fresh mushrooms.  *Only had can mushrooms.. had to make due*

We actually thought this was good........but......it did come out too thick. I will be making this again, but use less rice.......maybe 1 1/4 cup instead of 1 3/4 cup. Or maybe instead of soup & milk.......try soup & water. It's definitely worth playing with, so I'll try again!

I found myself with an abundance of canned peas and was looking for a way to reduce their population in my pantry. This is pretty good. The guests I served it to really liked it. It's a good homestyle side dish. I will be making this one again.
