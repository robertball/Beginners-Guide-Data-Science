This pie is as good cold as it is warm. Instead of a two crust pie, I made it a single crust and made a tent of foil for over the top. Half way through the baking I removed it. It is a good thing I made two, my family of men enjoyed them both. Perfect summer pie.

This pie was good, but what really impressed me and everyone else was the pastry itself. I have NEVER been able to make good flakey crusts, and this one was excellent! Made according to direction, the crust was very wet, but when I rolled it out on lots of flour, it turned out perfectly! I have kept this crust recipe and now use it for all of my pies.

I had misplaced my recipe, which was my grandmother's, from the 1930s. How delighted to find it here, as my daughter just asked for it. I often just make the filling as a pudding, and we all really have enjoyed it for decades.

I used this crust recipe for anothe pie.  Pie tasted delish, crust did stick to the bottom of the pie plate but that could be my error in greasing the plate I suppose.  Had no complaints on the pie or the crust so it's a thumbs up from us!

Fantastic! I used half sour cream and half plain yogurt to cut the fat down. I served this cold out of the fridge with sweetened heavy cream. My husband hates rhubarb. But he really liked this pie!

I only used the recipe for making a pie crust for a different sort of pie - it was wonderful! I had no experience making pies, but it turned out lovely.

This pie is awesome. What really makes it is the crust. I have been trying for years to make my grandma's pie crust... Now, I think I've got it! I made a blueberry and mixed berry pie with this crust and they were awesome too.

This pie tastes very orange juicy.  Even though you only use 1/4 cup, the flavor is powerful.  I would use less next time.  However, this is THEE best pie crust EVER!!!  I will use this pie crust recipe over and over and over!!  Soooo good!

I have been making this pie for years.  It is my family's favorite pie. The only problem is finding the rhubarb on the market. I finally planted my own and freeze the rhubarb so I have it available all year long.

Good recipe!  I had about 5 cups of rhubarb so I added a splash (about 1/4 C) milk and an extra egg, I also added 1 tsp vanilla.  Fantastic dessert.  I served it cold and it was a hit, even to those with a bad idea of what rhubarb tastes like.  Also I already had 2 refrigerated pie crusts so I used those instead.

overall result was OK, The taste was a little off after baking and ended up slightly burnt. My problems may just be user error but maybe a revision in recipe

This pie is the best pie I've ever made!  The crust was difficult to work with but was so nice and flakey when all done! Next time may try refrigerating dough for a while before rolling out. Even though the rhubarb and custard was mixed together,  it separated into two layers and made a beautiful presentation. The ONLY critique I would have is to use a little less sugar. The sweet custard and tart rhubarb compliment each other perfectly but the custard was just a tad bit on the sweet side. Other than that minor tweak it was perfect!
