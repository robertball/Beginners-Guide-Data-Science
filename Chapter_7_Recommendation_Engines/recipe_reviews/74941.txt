I have not had Kugel before so I made this per the recipe but used wide noodles instead of fine and it was really good.   The noodles were tender and the dish had just the right amount of sweetness.

Outstanding. Just do add a half a teaspoon of rum extract for perfection!

This was really tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used 1 cup of coconut and mixed it with the butter before sprinkling it on top.  Mine took less than an hour to bake.

Tasty and super easy to make.  Instead of egg noodles I had a ton of leftover spaghetti that I used. Will definitely make again.

Yum.  My family enjoyed this as dessert after our Shabbos meal.  It is very rich, but delightful.  I did make one change as recommended by a previous reviewer and added a splash of rum extract.

It tasted indescribable. I am sure that it is a family fave for some, but we did not enjoy this at all. Perhaps using more sugar will help. I will try again.

I used wide noodles instead of fine noodles and sweetened coconut instead of shredded coconut. Also I mixed in some of the sweetened coconut into the mix before I poured it into the pan. Then I put the rest of the coconut on top.

I used honey instead of  sugar  I also added raisins and craisins about A handful of each. Mainly because my husband likes anything with raisins.

I know its not traditional but I had boiled the pasta to make this and realised I was out of milk...looking in the cupboard for a suitable subsitution I came across a can of coconut milk. I figured, coconut milk, coconut kugel - should work. And boy did it ever!! It was so yummy the only thing that kept me from eating half of it in one go was the fact I got too full lol..I will def be making this again!
