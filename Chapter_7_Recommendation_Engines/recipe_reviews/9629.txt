I have been making this since 2002 and it is one of my family & friend's favorites. Have no problem with too much or too little flour and freeze half for later! Make them at Easter Christmas and now Halloween! Yum!

The cookies were delicious- exceptionally sweet and just the right combination of crispiness and gooeyness. I used cookie cutters to punch out shapes in the dough and that worked out very easily. However I would suggest either halving or scaling the recipe because it became an all-day event with never-ending leftovers!

I followed the recipe exactly and could not believe how sticky the dough was. I was very skeptical that it could actually be rolled out but hoped refrigerating would help it set. After refrigerating overnight the dough was still too wet. I added flour until it could be rolled. I cut and baked the cookies but they came out more like biscuits and very bland. The sprinkled sugar burns between batches so you have to clean the sheets. Ended up baking only half the batch and throwing most of the cookies out.

Cookies were very tasty. At first I thought that it would be too much flour but then it ended up being not enough. I had to add a lot when my 2 year old and I rolled them out and cut them with the cookie cutters. We gave them to our neighbors and they just loved them. It made about 50 cookies so next time I will half the recipe. It is a keeper though!

I followed the recipe verbatim. I had no problems with my dough being too dry/wet. However they lacked a sugar cookie texture and taste after baked they were more like biscuits that were somewhat sweet (similar to strawberry shortcake bread). Maybe this is what 'old fashioned' sugar cookies are supposed to taste like?

I am not an experienced cookie maker but I followed the recipe and I too had to add flour before rolling out. The final product turned out to be very bland. Not horrible but not real great either.

This dough was way sticky. My children and I couldn't even cut out any shapes as the dough was sticking everywhere even with tons of flour. And the cinnamon flavor was too strong for a traditional sugar cookie taste--I would leave that out.

I make these cookies every year and they are wonderful! You definitely have to follow directions exactly. (That's how baking usually is!) However I did flake out one year and forgot the vanilla. They still tasted great thanks to the cinnamon!

Oh boy the dough was sticky as other reviews stated. I added more flour but the result was cookies that baked up hard. I tried under baking but that did not work well. Flavor is a bit bland as well. Would not make again unfortunately.

I ve been making this sugar cookie recipe for over 13 years now. It is the BEST sugar cookie recipe you will find. Friends and family love these cookies and look forward to them every year. They re light and fluffy and the cinnamon gives them a great flavor as opposed to the regular bland sugar cookie. I don t sprinkle with sugar as the recipe suggests. I cut them out in fun shapes frost them with a buttercream frosting and decorate them with sprinkles. Yum!!

My 11 year old daughter made these and they turned out perfect. Crispy outside soft inside and a great taste! Highly recommend.
