I made this cake with instant lemon pudding instead of the gelatin and it turned out wonderfully! I poked holes every 1" -2" and let the watery glaze run in so the cake has glaze in it when cut it. Delicious!! Everyone ate it up at my father's 80th birthday party!

This exceeded my expectations for a cake mix. No artificial cake mix flavor!  I made the cake, just as written, in a Bundt pan. I left out the water in the glaze, which I brushed on with a pastry brush. This is moist, lemony and delicious. My only criticism is the bright yellow color, which advertises "artificial."

I have been searching for this recipe for quite some time, now.  VERY similar to one of my aunt's recipes.  DELICIOUS!!

Only changes I would make is that my cake took only 35 minutes to bake, and don't add the tablespoon of water to the glaze unless absolutely necessary.  My glaze was very runny, and pooled around the edges and ran down the sides of the cake, too.  Although the outer pieces that got the extra glaze were very tasty, too!  :o)

This is a good summery dessert. It is very fresh-tasting and seems light, although a glance at the ingredients will reveal that impression to be misleading. The cake was great and people enjoyed it, but there was one thing that bothered me a bit, which was the color of the cake. It screams YELLOW. I wish there was a way to reduce that fakey bright yellow. Maybe use a pudding rather than a gelatin, as another reviewer said that worked fine. Here are the changes I made based on other reviews: 
1. Omitted water from glaze
2. Used a bundt pan
3. Reduced baking time by 4ish minutes
4. Poked holes in the top to allow glaze to penetrate. 
5. Added the zest of 1 lemon & 1 tsp. pure vanilla to the icing.
Other than that, texture, recipe-ease and taste were all 5 of 5 stars. Thanks!

If you're looking for tangy lemon flavor, choose this recipe!  A tip:  If using a bundt pan, poke holes in the crevices (as opposed to the crowns) and pour half the glaze.  Then, add another cup of confectioners' sugar and a drop of food coloring and pour the rest.  This gives a thicker, more colorful glaze.  Since my young daughter requested this for her b-day, I topped with multi-colored sprinkles.  You could add something a bit more sophisticated (lemon wedges?)if serving adults.  A keeper!

This is very good, the lemon flavor is just right.  Only changes I made were using 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup oil (instead of 3/4) to reduce the fat a bit.  Also used yogurt butter and no water for the glaze.  It came out so moist and delicious, my hubby had thirds!  Will become the new birthday cake, I'm sure!

This review is for the GLAZE ONLY. This is a 5-star glaze if you replace that last tablespoon of water with more lemon juice or butter. I really love what adding butter to glazes does for them -- so decadent! I used this glaze on AR's "Lemon Gold Cake" and they were very very good together. Thanks for sharing!

Really good and lemony.  I made it in a Bundt pan instead of the 9X13 and it came out fine.

Awesome! Super easy, incredibly moist and tangy! I put the glaze on when the cakes were still warm. I also made 2 loaf size cakes instead of one large one. This recipe is a definite keeper!

I am going to do something I totally hate that is change the recipe and rate it b/c then it really isn't the posted recipe you are rating but your recipe anyway I never have luck baking homemade cakes especially bundt cakes so I used a lemon cake mix and made the glaze as posted.  I let the cake cool for about 10 minutes in the pan than turned it onto a wire rack I put serving plate under the rack to catch the drips and spooned the glaze over top there is way too much glaze but that could be b/c I used a cake mix anyway I just kept respooning the dripped glaze over the cake.  Served it at a family bbq and got rave reviews the cake is so good thanks for the recipe.

I followed many who tried this recipe using a bundt pan but did not alter the bake time.  This came out very good in flavor but the glaze was too thin.  I omitted the water and had cooled the cake, but glaze was still too runny. Will make again but will try adding more confectioner's sugar.

So easy and tasted great!  Perfect color and flavor for spring or summer.  I like a really tart lemon flavor so I substituted lemon juice for water.  Also used the advice of others and checked at 30 minutes, which was perfect timing.

So what if it's neon yellow lol this cake is so yummy! I used a 3.5oz box of lemon pudding mix instead of gelatin and cooked it in a bundt pan for 40-45 min, until the toothpick came out clean.  I let it cool in the pan for about 10 min the flipped it out onto my wire rack. I mixed up the glaze minus the water and tried spooning it in the holes & ontop but it still ran off. The plate under the wire rack caught it and I let it set up for about 5 min then it didnt run off so easily. Then I took a soft plastic brush( for bbq sauce) and brushed the remaining glaze onto the cake. Nice thick, glaze. Awesome!!!

This tastes just like the lemon cake Grandma used to make when I was a kid. It might sound strange, but we used to put a hunk of cake in a bowl, pour milk over it and eat it with a spoon. Yum! LOL. Thanks for posting this recipe.

i made this cake over the weekend and while i loved it and everyone else seemed to like it, i thought it was a little overwhelming.  i think next time i'm going to try using a regular yellow cake mix instead of the lemon cake mix.

My son asked for a lemon lime cake for his 5th birthday. Not your typical request for birthday cake, so I turned up this recipe and substituted lime jello for the lime. I also added both lemon and lime zest to the cake and icing. It was so yummy. Even my brother and his wife who are die-hard chocoholics were converted with this recipe. (My SIL actually asked me to bring it to their July 4th BBQ, so I'm bakc to print out the recipe again.) This is a keeper. Also, I make it in a Bundt pan sprayed with Bakers Jo spray. Perfect!!!

Easy, quick glaze.  Didn't make the cake, but used the glaze on Chocolate Cake.  Hubby doesn't like lemon so I excluded the lemon juice and increased the water.  Added a splash of almond extract for a kick...turned out fantastic!

The cake was good but just Several differant things that I think will make it more moist next time is to use Pillsbury cake instead of Duncan Hines. Also, I didn't use all of the glaze, only about half and next time I will use most of it if not all of it. I made the cake with lemon pudding instead as was recommended and only needed to bake it for 39-40 minutes instead of 45 minutes. The glaze was very good. As one member recommended, I added 1 TSP of pure vanilla extract and a little lemon zest to the glaze. At first I kept out the water (as so many recommended) but the glaze was super thick (I didn't measure how much powdered sugar I put in but more than the recipe called for) so I ended up adding a little water so the glaze would run in the holes. The cake was delicious and I think with those few changes to make next time, it will be perfect!

Loved this cake!  I only had lime jello on hand and it tasted great.  I added extra zest and juice to the glaze (I love tangy citrus) and first poked some holes in the bottom of my bundt cake and poured over, then flipped the cake over and poured the rest on top-super yummy!

I made this cake tonight and it is really delicious. I used pudding instead of gelatin this time because when I went to the store that's what I got. But other then that made the recipe as stated and made in 2 loaf pans. Turned out great, give one to my sister for one of her birthday cakes. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe ANNETTER

I baked it in a Bundt pan, and it came out beautiful, but it was dry. Don't think I'll try this one again.

This cake is dangerously delicious. So good we had a hard time stopping as everyone wanted "just one more bite". The glaze was really thin and I wasn't quite sure what consistency it was supposed to be. The cake was delicate and I think it would have been better if it was more like a pound cake.

Very moist. Very Easy. Also used pudding instead of jello. Really loved the lemon glaze!  TIP:  I made only half of the glaze recipe. I spread the glaze on with a pastry brush. It cooled into a NICE glaze.

I too used a bundt pan, and I used orange jello.  I also added in about 1.5 cups of cranberries.  For the glaze, I ran out of lemon juice, so I used up some lime juice.  That added a nice tang to it.  I get rave comments on this.

It's so easy to experiment with different flavors with this recipe.

Easy to make and tasty but too dry for my taste. I took another reviewer's suggestion and baked the cake for less time than the recipe calls for. I used a glass baking pan and it was done in 30 minutes.

Though I haven't tried the cake, the glaze is delicious.  I used it on a butternut pound cake with great success.  The two tastes complemented each wonderfully.

I did not make this cake bc I don't like box cake but I did make the lemon glaze and it was DELICIOUS.  I made a homemade Lemon Cake from allrecipes.com  and then use this lemon glaze in this recipe and it was delicious.  When you taste the lemon glaze it may come off sour but when you put it on the lemon cake and when it cools and all the flavors come together is taste delicious esp with some vanilla ice cream.  5 stars!!!

I made this cake and it was so easy to throw together and the clean up was minimal. The cake is a keeper and I will make again.  Used the glaze shown but added a couple of drops of lemon extract to enhance the flavor of the cake.  Yum!

This cake overall was delicious, but the glaze was a little too tart for me at first. Since you poke holes in the cake and pour the glaze over I would bite into a delicious piece of cake and then the next bite would be a sour tart piece where the glaze was. I would make this cake again but using less lemon juice in the glaze or using a whole different glaze. Just too tart for my taste. It does taste better after being refrigerated. Cool and refreshing.

Very tastey cake.  Had trouble with the glaze staying on the cake.  I did add some lemon zest to the glaze mix for added lemon flavour, which gave it that extra little zip!  Everyone at the table enjoyed it!

GREAT cake!  I made this to include in my Christmas cookie trays for the neighbors (I felt like something lemony) and this was perfect.  It made a lot of glaze, but I kept scooping it up with a spatula and spreading it back on top and into the holes.  A definite keeper.  It'll be great in the summer with whipped cream on top!

This is a great cake...just finished eating a piece still warm from the oven.  I did add lemon zest as well as a teaspoon of vanilla to the icing.  For the cake, I included 1 tsp. real lemon extract in place of part of the water.   It's a wonderful cake. I may try experimenting with the icing the next time I make this because there WILL be a next time!  Thanks for a great recipe.

i love this cake. it seemed to get moister and more lemony with each day. i cut the oil to 1/3 cup and next time will try it with egg beaters to make it even lower in fat and calories. also skipped the butter in the glaze. i used a bundt pan but next time will use 9x13 for better distribution of glaze.

This cake turned out very light and the glaze added a tangy lemon taste. It does have a little bit of boxed taste so next time I'll make it from scratch. I made some changes to the original recipe above. I altered this recipe to the one on the Duncan Hines box. I used instant vanilla pudding instead of jello. I used a dark bundt cake pan instead of the 9x13 and baked on 350 for 60 minutes. I only added 1/3 cup oil but 1 cup of water.  I replaced the water in the recipe with additional lemon juice. Can anyone tell me why it calls for the butter in the frosting?

Made this for a friends birthday because chocolate is too rich for her.  Everyone at work loved it.  45 minutes and the whole thing was gone. Few changes made were-lemon pudding mix instead of jello and the glaze I just used lemon zest, juice and the powdered sugar.  I am personally not a fan of lemon but loved it.

very nice but as always i tweaked it a bit,,,used lemon pudding instead gelatin and in the glaze no water poked holes while in pan and drizzled glaze so it would soak in as well.

The perfect summer lemon cake.  Baked this one in a bundt pan--it was pretty and delicious. We loved it with vanilla ice cream for father's day luncheon.

Delicious.  The only change I make is to use only about half of the glaze.  I find the full amount to be overpowering.  The taste of the glaze is excellent, and the cake is very easy to make.

I made this cake for Easter, and it was a big hit. The only changes I made were that I used a bundt pan and omitted the water from the icing. If you use a bundt pan, the icing will pool around the cake - it was still delicious though, and I got lots of compliments on the tart lemony flavor. We will make this one again.

I didn’t have lemon cake mix, so I added an extra package of jello to yellow cake mix. I also added the grated rind of one lemon. Very lemony! It was a hit with my students and family.

Excellent recipe. We cooked in a Bundt pan and probably could have cut the glaze in half. We also used the pudding instead of jello. It was excellent!!

I've made this cake now twice, the second I made two and took then to work.  By the end of the day both cakes were all gone.

This was an easy cake to make and is now my favorite, I would change a thing about it.

I am not a lemon cake lover, but made it TWICE this weekend for two friends who are lemon cake fans, and they LOVED it.  I enjoyed reading the tips from others who have made it, and was able to integrate those tips in my second bundt cake.  This is my new "go to" Lemon cake when people in my office want something "lemon" for their birthdays!  Thank you!

This cake turned out great.  I made it for a birthday celebration and everyone liked it very much. I did substitute the small package of instant lemon pudding for the lemon jello.  This cake had a tangy lemon taste and was easy to make

The cake was delicious. The glaze was too thin, even though I left out the suggested water. I would make it again but may try a fluffy white icing instead.

I made a variation of this recipe. White chocolate pudding instead of lemon gelatin.  I cut the glaze in half and left out the water as recommended,   added lemon zest as well. It made a prettier presentation with the drizzles and was plenty sweet!

There is a big problem with the instructions, they say to bake in a 9x13 and bake 40-45 min.  Sorry you would have cinders.  If you bake in a 9x13 25-28 min.
The picture shows a bunt pan and the baking time would be in keeping with that.
I think a bunt  would be best, because the cake in a 9x13 is uneven on top

The recipe is great, it would of been better if the lemon glaze was a little less lemony. I also used the recipe on the back of the cake mix instead of the normal recipe. I would recommend this recipe for people who like lots of lemon flavor.

I made the glaze not the cake. I used lemon juice only, no butter. It was still runny enough and had a huge lemon flavor. Cant see the point of the butter.

I didnt make the cake as it is fake cake with stuff coming out of a box. I made a lemon pound cake with fresh lemon juice and zest. it was awesome. The two together were phenomenal.

Lovely! Added sour cream in lieu of most of the oil; folded in blueberries (floured first) to batter; made a glaze of melted butter, confectioner's sugar and lemon juice. Family just keeps eating it up! Thank you.

Since its just me and my husband, it never seems like a good idea to make a whole cake just for us, so I cut in half and freeze it. Well, after 3 days we're ready to take out the frozen half!! It was easy to make and delicious. ????

I was looking for a simple yet yummy glaze to replace the artificial tasting glaze that came with the box of lemon cake mix.

This is a great glaze!

Good cake nice and moist, I had a bit more lemon juice (about 3/4 cup) added to the confectioner's sugar.  Other than that, the recipie is as published.  I would bake it a bit less than the minimum 40-42 minutes the box recommended.

Absolutely DELICIOUS. I used to make this cake all the time years ago and searched the recipe as I could not remember how many eggs.   

Changes I made:

I used just a yellow cake mix opposed to the lemon. 

I did not add water to the batter instead I mixed the jello in a separate bowl with one cup of hot water then let cool. Blend cake mix and jello. I then added the eggs,  oil and a cap size of lemon extract. Baked at 350 for 35 min.  

This recipe has always been a crowd pleaser!!!

My family loves this recipe. We like it a little tarter and I will usually add additional lemon juice to taste. Also lemon zest I'd delicious too!

I made this using Duncan Hines Lemon Supreme cake mix, following the recipe on the box, but adding an extra egg which totals four. I also used Jello Instant lemon pudding instead of Jello Mix. The time it takes to cook, really depends on your ovens latitude, but to be sure and not overcook your cake, you can always use the toothpick test after about 30 minutes, making sure it comes out clean. This is about what my cake was finished at, cooking it on convection. As far as the icing for those who said it was to thin, you can always add confection sugar to thicken or use less lemon juice. This is my family's favorite recipe and comes out perfect every time. I gave 5 stars because the recipe I am responding to, is this persons original recipe and you just have to make it your own if you feel something didn't fit your liking.

The glaze is great!  If you want a cake that isn't overpowering with sugar, this would be the one.  Excellent lemon flavor.

I actually made this cake twice within 24 hours because it was for my Dad's bday & the first one (Dunkin Hines mix) was really overdone when baked for only 36 mins.  The second (Betty C mix) I baked for 30 mins & it wasn't burnt but it was pretty dry & tasted absolutely no different from the cake mix when made by itself without the jello. I even poked many more holes & used more glaze to try to make it moister.

This was my favorite cake growing up...my Mom has made 30+ years...it was called Lemon Velvet Cake. The glaze is thin because it is supposed to be made as a sheet cake...larger surface and more chance to permeate the cake. While the Bundt pan makes a prettier cake, the glaze does not get a chance to settle into the cake, so some of the flavor is lost. Might want to poke the bottom of the cake and then quickly turn onto cake plate to glaze the top? I like to serve this with raspberries or strawberries and whipped cream....sort of shortcake style. DO NOT substitute pudding mix for the jello....it totally changes the recipe and texture. Adding lemon zest to the batter is nice too.
Note...I couldn't get lemon cake mix on my last round, so I used Key Lime cake mix...still used lemon jello and glaze. Lemon and Lime Zest...nice change & interesting color!

I made this recipe as directed, using a Bundt pan. However, I used real lemons (instead of lemon juice) and also grated the lemons and added that to glaze. This is the Bomb for a Lemon Cake :)

This is a wonderful cake, except I did not add the two tablespoons of butter to the glaze and it is very light and summery.  I thought the butter made the glaze two greasy and heavy.  Turned out great!

I've been making this cake for years.  It's the only cake mix cake I still make because everyone loves it.  I use a yellow cake mix, increase the water to 3/4 cup, add 1 tsp of the lemon zest (from the lemon for the glaze) and dissolve the jello in the water instead of combining it with the cake mix.  The cake gets a slightly more natural flavor using the zest rather than using the lemon cake mix.  I also save 1 tsp of the jello powder to use in the glaze.  I mix the glaze while the cake is baking so the jello can dissolve in the lemon juice and thicken it slightly.

This cake was so-so. I made it with the pudding and used the bundt cake pan and it was a little dry. The glaze was horrible! It was like pouring water all over my cake, it was so runny and I even omitted the water. I made a new batch of glaze, added 2 1/12 to 2 3/4 cup powdered sugar to the batch, a few drops of yellow food coloring and then poured it back and forth over the top of my cake. The glaze turned out wonderful the 2nd time! Not sure I would make this one again, but thank you for sharing!

I really like this cake.  I decided to switch things up and make this recipe with strawberry cake mix and gelatin.  It turned out amazing.  For the glaze, I took fresh strawberries and pureed them along with the confectioner's sugar, butter, and water.

Excellent.  I loved the tang of the real lemon used in the glaze.  A thin slice is very satisfying.  I left out the food coloring.  Even though the glaze was runny I preferred it to a thick sugary shell-like glaze.

YUM!  I love lemons and this was a HIT!  I did use a package of lemon pudding.  I also only made 1/2 the icing (No water, extra sugar for a thicker glaze), and brushed it on with a pastry brush.  MUCH better than a whole smear of thick frosting.  It was really pretty on my cakestand and was a welcome adition to our Easter Lunch.  I will be making this one for years to come!!  Thank you!

I did not make the cake part I only made the glaze. I made another cake from this site with Poppy seeds and let me tell you the only thing that saved that cake was the lemon glaze that was the best. I also omited the water and it turned out excellent. I will make this cake next time!! Thanks for a great recipie

My 17 year old son made this for his cousin since I was away.  The glaze even without the water was too runny so he added more icing sugar.  We both suggest a spring form pan if you want a round cake as the bundt did not absorb thin or thicker glaze.  I decorated it with lemon and lime zest for a prettier look.

The cake was very moist, but not as sweet as I would have liked.  I also used a different recipe for the glaze. Over all it was pretty good.  I cooke it at 350F amd for 40 minutes.

This cake didn't turn out especially well. It was tough and spongey and too dense. I followed the recipe exactly, so I'm not too sure what happened there.
