This is one of my oldest boy's favorite treats. It's not only good for breakfast, but as a quick lunch or snack and it's an excellent way to use up ripe bananas when your child is all "ew--bruised banana". If it's covered with peanut butter and rolled in a tortilla, you can't see the bruises. ;) NOTE: This also works with Nutella or almond butter.

Peanut Butter and bananas are a great combination in my book, but sandwich them between some tortillas and well....you have yourself a really nice little treat! I love the "crunch" from the granola. These are great for breakfast or just about anytime of day when you're looking for a snack. Next time I might heat it up a bit in the microwave to get the peanut butter a little "melty".  I also might add in some chocolate chips or sub a little jelly or jam for the honey. Overall, very tasty yet simple recipe and a great way to for a peanut butter addict like me to get her "fix"! Thanks Mohawkmae!

I used chocolate chips instead of the coconut.  When making the tortillas, I flipped them, and placed chocolate chips on.  By the time I had pulled it off of the pan, the chips had begun to melt, so I sprinkled the peanut butter mixture on, placed the banana on that, and rolled it up.  Great treat!  These might be really good with coconut and chocolate chips--that will have to be another day!

Excellent snack, brings back some good memories of banana and PB sandiwches.  I like the coconut in this, its something I had not tried before and I enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!

The honey added to the peanut butter is good - though it makes it a bit sweeter than I like.  I think the banana is sweet enough.  I generally use plain peanut butter and then toss any number of things on top - nuts, granola, coconut, mini chocolate chips, craisins - depending upon what's on hand.  I use the whole banana and a plain flour wrap.  This is a great on-the-go breakfast or lunch.  It's healthy, very filling and it sticks with you for hours.  (And I'm not even a kid!)

Oh, my! This takes a peanut butter and banana sandwich to a whole new level! I used a low carb/high fiber tortilla instead of whole wheat, and I made my own granola using Stovetop Granola from this site. Best lunch I've had in quite a while.

These are a great breakfast treat or as a snack. I cut them into pinwheels and not only did I like them the grand-kids went crazy over them and gave a ten star rating.

Made these with multigrain "Flat Out" flatbread.
My husband raved about it! I made it for myself to eat on the way to the golf course.  Wonderful and fast!

I really enjoyed it but my 3 yr old was not crazy about it. He doesn't like wraps that much or even banana peanut butter sandwiches but I was hoping he would still like this.  My 1 yr old seem to enjoy it. I used rice krispies instead of granola and I think I would probably enjoy this better then granola.  I'll probably make this again if I have kids coming over as a snack option. I thought it was a bit too sweet for a lunch option.  I only rated 4 stars because my son didn't really like it.  I thought the spread itself would have made really yummy energy balls if rolled up instead of used for this sandwich.

Made these simply with a chocolate flavored peanut butter spread on the tortilla, generously sprinkled with a good granola mix and stuck the whole banana in it. Wonderful, thanks for this idea!

I really liked this recipe, but if I were you, I would take my review with a grain of salt.  I love bananas and peanut butter but I also did not have all of the ingredients and had to substitute. For peanut butter, I used cashew butter and for honey I used caramel pecan/apple butter for the farmer's market.  I loved the recipe, and my sister (who isn't a fan of cashew butter or pb & bananas) liked it.

Super simple and the kids loved it. I have followed the advice of another reviewer to just leave the banana whole. Good idea.  Not as substantial, but a well received variation we tried (due to ingredients on hand) peanut butter, banana, cinnamon, a very small thready drizzle of honey, and a few raisins. Whatever we use, I always add cinnamon and we layer the ingredients right onto the tortillas. We slice the entire roll into 1/2" pieces. Used chop sticks to eat them once. I wont suggest this again. It was close to dinner by the time they got them eaten. A good way to get rid of leftover drying out (frozen) sprouted grain tortillas, which btw, are usually comparably priced to whole wheat counterparts, unlike most sprouted goods :)

I've made this twice, but I really didn't enjoy it. It's weird because I love banana with peanut butter. I won't make it again.

Great, easy breakfast. I did add flaxseed and crushed almonds. After making it, I threw it in the microwave for 20 seconds to eat it warm.

My kids really enjoyed this healthy treat. Using a healthy granola with acai berries in it also helps. Will make again ;-)
