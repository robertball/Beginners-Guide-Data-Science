Tony!  This is an awesome recipe!  Thanks!  For anyone thinking of making this, here's a few suggestions:  1) Don't skip making the pico de gallo. . . that's what makes this recipe so good.  The flavor is wonderful!  2) Reading through the reviews, it appears some of you are having problems flipping the 12" tortilla.  Here's a quick and easy way to flip it.  When the tortilla is ready to flip, take a dinner plate and lay it upside down in the pan on top of the tortilla.  Put your hand on top of the plate and flip the entire pan over so that the plate and tortilla are now in your hand.  Now, simply slide the tortilla back into the pan and "voila" your flipped without the mess!

Senor Cortez--This is the best, by far, recipe I have ever tasted for Pico de Gallo.  Combining it in a chicken quesadilla was a work of genius, or family background.  Using fresh cilantro is imperitive to the overall good taste, as are fresh ripened tomatoes.  I followed your recipe to a T, but did prepare the pico de gallo about 3 hours prior to cooking to let the flavors completely meld.  I also did mine in the oven, lightly coating the lower tortilla with canola oil, then adding the cheese and ingredients, and coating the top tortilla lightly with oil, and baked in a 375 degree oven for about 20 to 25 minutes.  Again, mucho gracios for this delicious recipe.  I will quadruple the recipe the next time in order to feed a few friends.  GordonGoodGuy, and Chef Extrordinaire.

You CAN go back home again!  I'm from Texas and sorely missed Tex-Mex food.  This recipe is perfect and outperforms most restaurants easily. The pico de gallo stands alone and can be made as dip for tortilla chips..outstanding!  I would recommend NOT boiling/stewing the chicken as another reviewer suggests, because so much of the flavor comes from the chicken pan drippings created by cooking it in the olive oil.  It provides that essential grilled-type taste like fajitas.  Also, DO use the plate and slide method another reviewer suggests...absolutely no problems with turning them over or messiness.  One final tip: don't load up the centermost part of the quesadilla because when you cut it like a pie to eat, the tip is overweighted and makes for a messy meal with  filling falling out too easily.  Muchas gracias, Senor Cortez. Era lo mejor!

This was quick and easy to make. I don't know what the people were talking about when they said it took too long to chop everything. It was no longer than to fix a typical evening meal. I will say that I did use the pre-cooked and sliced southwestern chicken slices (I'm sure that saved quite a bit of time - other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was soooo good - especially the pico de gallo. The grocery store didn't have any jalapeno peppers - just anaheim - still turned out excellent. My husband and I are on a low carb diet - we just used low-carb tortillas, gave the kids flour tortillas and it was great. (I followed the advice of another reviewer - I sprayed olive oil in a pan, placed a tortilla on the bottom, placed all the ingredients on, put another torilla on top, sprayed it with olive oil and baked in a 350Â° oven for about 10 minutes and it turned out perfect.

Fabulous taste - worth the chopping effort - I eat mine with sour cream on top - also I had trouble flipping and finally decided to only put filling on half the tortilla and then fold the non filled cheese covered half over the top of the filling - then I could heat each side just right - plus when I cut it to serve it didn't goo out the folded side so it was easier to cut and eat !! Awesome recipe you've got to try this one.

Pico de Gallo was great!  We marinated the chicken in a chicken taco seasoning and then grilled the chicken rather than cooking on the stovetop.  In addition, we heated the quesadillas on the George Foreman grill instead of the stovetop.

Wonderful! My husband asks for these all the time now! I added mushrooms and used mozarella cheese. Also, as an alternative, try baking your quesadillas in the oven on 350 for about 10 minutes instead of heating in a skillet. If you like yours crunchy, broil for about 2 minutes after baking.

Very easy and delicious!!!! Only thing I changed was to grill the whole chicken breast (with salt and freshly ground black pepper) and then cut it into 2 inch strips. I found that cutting 2 inch pieces from a raw chicken breast causes the pieces to "puff" while cooking which was a little cumbersome to place into the quesadilla. Thanks Tony for a refreshing way to eat chicken!!!!!

The best quesadilla recipe on this site so far! I didn't have any fresh tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes, drained and also used half a 4.5 oz can of diced jalapeno peppers and due to lack of lime, I used 1/2 TBLS lime juice...VERY GOOD and will remember this pico de gallo part for tacos and other dishes, plus I saved on some chopping time.  In addition, after filling the tortillas with the cheese and chicken mix, I just heated them in the oven for a few minutes (rather than heating over the stove steps). We topped them with all our favorites!  Served with "Best Spanish Rice" on this site...great meal and will make again!! Thanks Tony!!!

This was excellent!!!!  Wonderful flavor!  It does take some time with the chopping but is worth it.  I put boneless chicken breasts in the crockpot with a little broth and let them cook all day; they shredded effortlessly and saved some time.  I made 2 small quesadillas instead of one large one.  The secret to flipping...nonstick pan, Pam and a big spatula!!  Will definitely make these again!!

Amazing!!  Followed recipe with the exception of different shredded cheese (just our preference), a tiny bit less onion, more tomato...again, personal preference and we use wheat tortillas.  Nothing was left.  HIGHLY recommend!!  An absolute keeper!

This recipe is just okay.  First off, when I think of Pico de Gallo, I think of spicy and flavorful.  This pico is totally missing the heat by only using one jalapeno (and this is coming from someone who doesn't like things too spicy.)  If I make this again, I would up it to at least 1 1/2 jalapenos. I also noticed no spices were used on the chicken.  I wanted these to be tasty, so a few minutes before I threw my chicken in the grill pan I sprinkled lime juice, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper over them.  Next time I will let the chicken marinate in it for at least a few hours.  The actual quesadillas were okay, but they still weren't packing the punch I was looking for.  I did not cook these in the oven or on the stove, but instead used my Quesadilla Maker.  I served them with chips and guacamole or salsa.  I'm not quite sure where the almost 5 star rating is coming from, these are average quesadillas that could be improved by using a lot more seasonings.  The recipe as written is a 3, and even with my adding of extra ingredients into them I still would only give them a 4.

Excellent!  For the person who wanted a suggestion on flipping - use the largest tortillas available.  Put the ingredients on one half of the tortilla then fold it in half.  Put it in the skillet and flip it by putting your spatula under the open end and flip towards the folded side.  Nothing falls out.

I make this all of the time, only change is to use the George Foreman Grill.  2 minutes and done.  You can use big tortillas, or little ones.  Super easy.

This is THE quesadilla!  There is no other!  Man, is this ever delicious- exactly what I have been looking for!  I did do two things differently.  First, it seemed to me the chicken itself would benefit from some seasoning.  So, I rubbed it thoroughly with a chile lime rub.  Then, because I have a big aversion to handling raw meat (it grosses me out so much, I can't eat it later!), I cooked it in the oven and then sliced it.  Also, I brushed the tortillas lightly with olive oil, assembled the quesadillas as directed, and baked them in the oven until crispy and lightly browned.  Oh.  My.  Gosh!  Just exactly what I wanted- perfectly seasoned, perfectly spicy, perfectly cheesy!  Thank you so much for this recipe Mr. Cortez- I will be making this one a LOT  :)

Although I haven't had a chance to try this recipe (I make my own salsa and we do simple quesadillas, chicken and cheese or pork and cheese because of my picky eater) I read a note about some people having trouble flipping the quesadilla.  I read the plate suggestion, excellent idea that I'll have to try (if I can handle it with my clumsiness!). ;)

Another way to do it is to don't use two tortillas for each quesadilla.  Use one tortilla and put the filling on half of it then flip the other half over so that the quesadilla is closed.  When it's ready to flip you can slide the flipper under the straight side of the quesadilla which is in the middle of the pan (making it easier to get the flipper under it) and then turn it.

You can do this with two per pan if you wish because it's still easy to turn them because each has the straight side in the center of the pan so you just slide the flipper under each. :)

Hope that helps!

The pico de gallo is to die for.  I crave it like I crave deserts.  Every pico de gallo I've had since pales in comparison to this one's flavor and freshness.  The rest of the recipe is nothing too remarkable, but isn't bad either.

Here are some tips.  

1) If the pico de gallo flavors seem "off" at all, I've found that I usually need a little more salt.  Strange, but true.  

2) Just use one tortilla at a time.  Put toppings on one half of it and fold it over.  This will prevent alot of leakage during cooking.  

3) If you have a George Foreman grill gathering dust in your closet, dig it out now and use it for these quesadillas.  It works great and cooks in about half the time.  

4) I like to add about 1 T of olive oil and about 1 t of sugar to my pico de gallo.

When making this, I decided the chicken needed some seasoning, so I added a packed of fajita seasoning. Then followed the recipe as is. This was amazing!

I loved the Pico de Gallo mixture. I would make it on its own to serve with nachos or any other Mexican dish. Try cooking them in the oven at about 350 for 10 or 15 minutes. It is much less work than the frying. (This was a tip from my friends from Columbia). Make sure you spray the cookie sheets, or else you will have a sticky mess!!

I made this last night, and absolutely loved it! Did not change anything about the recipe and was originally worried that there was no spice on the chicken...but it didn't need it. The pico de gallo is beyond delicious and certainly worth the effort. I didn't want to worry about flipping, so I used one tortilla folded in half, and grilled it on my George Foreman Grill. Worked perfect. Saving this recipe!

Excellent! I marinated the chicken in lime juice and chili spice before cooking. The pico de gallo is the best. Will definitely make again and will add scallions to the sour cream next time.

Great recipe and you can vary the amount of ingredients as you go along and it'll still taste great.  I get the bottled lime juice to cut the time of squeezing limes, I also use whole wheat tortillas to make it a little healthier and season the chicken with salt and pepper before pan fying it. I also used a tip I got from this site for flipping these suckers since my frying pan is about the size of the tortilla shells (about 10"): I put down one tortilla, sprinkle with cheese, put 1/2 to 1/3 of the veggie/chicken filling in, top with another layer of cheese and top with a tortilla. I do this with the heat a little lower than med. When it's ready to flip (I lift an edge to check), I stick a large 10" round plate on top and flip the quesadilla so that the pan ends up on top and the quesadilla on the plate. I then slide the quesadilla back into the pan (of course with the uncooked side down). When that side is ready, I just flip again onto the round plate and cut with a pizza/round cutting knife while the quesadilla is on the plate. So easy!

This is a great mexican-ish staple.  Everyone in my home devours this when we make it.  We have made some simple changes and these should not create insurmountable issues.  Our first change and it is religion in this house is that we do not ever use flour tortillas, no exceptions. Grilling this recipe with authentic corn tortillas makes this shine!  I substitute a green chili (or two) for bell pepper.  Roast the pepper (I grill it) and go to it with everything, except salt.  So fun to make and even more fun to eat!  Do not skip the quac.

No seasoning at all on the chicken? *boggle* And the pico de gallo needs a bit of beefing up. I can't give this recipe high marks because of those. You have to do too much tweaking it to bring it up to a reasonable flavor level, but it does have possibilities if you do tweak it. I added garlic, green onion and a dash of vinegar to the Pico de Gallo which it really needed and used a marinade for the chicken of lime juice, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper.  Also you can use corn tortillas to avoid gluten.

One of the few recipes I have no modifications for! I'm Mexican and I can tell you these are deliciously authentic (well, you know minus the Monterey Jack cheese, but that's okay). The pico de gallo can seem tiresome to make but it's so perfect in the quesadillas. I've made these more times than I can count!

First of all wow. The pico was excellent. And the combination of flavor is so complimentary to the whole. I didn't add the extra green pepper or onion to cook after the meat. I just put the pico in with the meat and kept some to the side for garnishing. It was a hit and I'll definately be making this again. Now if I could just figure out how to flip them without making a big mess...any suggestions?

When I asked my boyfriend how many stars to rate this recipe, he said, "The Big Dipper". This was awesome. I did everything as stated, except I doubled it (2 chicken breast halves, 1 whole green pepper, 1 whole onion, 2 garlic cloves, etc...) I also used a bit more Monterey Jack cheese for one quesadilla. With the leftovers we will make burritos! The pico de gallo was restaurant quality. One suggestion: slice the green peppers very thin. Mine were thicker and didn't keep up with the onions in terms of softness. I also sort of shredded the chicken at the end. Delish!

Very delicious recipe! The pico de gallo is excellent with or without the jalapeno; I eat it with chips and add it to my guacamole dip. My family loved the quesadillas. I shredded my chicken and used orange pepper instead of green which gave it a sweet taste. Yum Yum Yum!! I definetely recommend using a plate to flip it or else you'll wind up with a big fat mess. I also serve mine with guacamole (Best Never Forgotten Guacamole).

This recipe is wonderful. I didn't have fresh garlic, but found that minced garlic in a jar worked just fine. Tastes much like a famous fast-food chain's version of a chicken fajita.  My boyfriend loved them, the only complaint was, there wasn't another one left over, but that can be easily remedied.  Worth the time it takes to make.  I used pre cut stir-fry chicken.  I would suggest to the next person going that route to cut the chicken up even more in to bite-sized pieces.  Thank you for the recipe!

Edit: I'll making the filling for these and just serving it as a chicken soft shell taco, in homemade tortillas w/sour cream spread on them and cheese sprinkled over all. Very good! Also, try it with chicken thigh meat instead of chicken breast, you can omit the 2nd tbs of oil. Heavenly!

These were pretty good.  Nothing that knocked my socks off.  Did have a little trouble with  the "flipping" thing, but that didn't compromise the taste any.  My husband really didn't care for this as he is not fond of southwestern food.  Mexican is one of my favorite types and I'm glad I gave this one a try.

This dish was excellent but I'm only giving it 4 stars for the incredible amount of time and effort that goes into making it for not a lot of food in the end.  The Pico de Gallo is wonderful and stands on it's own.  I will make that portion again to use with tacos and nachos.  I added extra chicken and cheese and made 2 large quesadillas, although next time I will cut or shred the chicken into smaller pieces as I, like so many others, had trouble flipping them without the ingredients falling out.  I will use other reviewers' suggestions for flipping next time or will make them with small tortillas.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe for a party and everyone loved it.  I made a few batches of just the pico de gallo and ate it wrapped in a warm tortilla with a small bit of sour cream and sometimes a little cheese.  My husband was out of town so I ate the wraps almost daily for a couple of weeks.  The were quick, easy and tasty, and I was able to lose the 10 pounds I needed to lose.  What a bonus!  Thanks for the recipe, it's rare that I don't have this made and ready in the refrigerator.

made this a few times and it came out great. restaurant quality. Sometimes, to save time, I've used some pre made pico de gallo that can be found in the produce section of your grocery store. (not the salsa kind)

this recipe is just perfect, the combination of the pico de gallo and the quesadillas is just wonderful, at times its a bit difficult to flip the tortillas but just try to place all the filling in the middle so it doesnt fall off, and do it fast. This recipe takes a little but of work but its well worth it!!! everyone loves it!! make it all the time its always a hit

Fantastic! The only thing I did different was add a packet of fajita seasoning mix to the chicken. The chicken was a little bland so it gave it a nice kick! The pico de gallo was amazing! My family loved it and suggested it's a do over. :)

I took a look at this recipe and said, WOW!  That's  just about how I make mine!  I love Pico de Gallo - and it gives the Quesadilla that extra KICK!!  I DO make sure I season my chicken how I like it, (in this case, Cumin, Galic powder, and a bit of Emeril Essence Seasoning).

I haven't tried the recipe for the quesadillas themselves, only the Pico (so my rating is for the Pico only).  The Pico de Gallo is outstanding!  I've made it numerous times, and everyone raves about it. The first time I made it, I followed the directions to a 'T'; the second time, I added another half jalapeno (to give it more 'kick'), and more cilantro (about a handful).  I now always use my mini chopper to chop, and blend everything together.  This is a keeper!!

Everyone loved this quesadilla recipe, it was really good.  The only thing I did was to bake the quesadillas, they were way too hard to flip.  The pico de gallo was great, I let it sit for an hour before we used it.  The only problem was something seemed to be missing, and I have no idea what that was, maybe more chili

Make it easier on yourself!  I make quesadillas in the frying pan all the time, and this tip will make them easier: put your filling on one half of the tortilla, then using a spatula, fold the "empty" half of the tortilla over onto the filled half.  Let cook, cheese melt, etc. then simply slide the quesadilla off onto a plate. Cut into thirds, and enjoy!

Yum! This is a really delicious recipe! I've made it many times and my family can't get enough of it!  *****Here are a few changes I've made: 1) add 2 cloves of minced garlic to the pico de gallo for some extra oomph; 2) make the pico de gallo ahead of time so the flavors can develop (I normally quadruple the amount); 3) use the pico de gallo liquid to marinate the uncooked chicken strips; 4) after the onions and bell peppers are tender, I stir fry the chicken until it's cooked, turn off the heat and then add in the pico de gallo 5) drain the mix or you'll end up with drippy quesodillas; 6) use pepper jack cheese for a really nice kick.

This recipe is an awesome starting point! I just have a few extra tips. The chicken is a little bland, but if you look up Lime Chicken Soft Tacos this is a perfect marinade!! Also, when making the pico make sure to scoop out all of the insides of the tomatoes, the seeds and juice make it extremely watery. Finally, an easy way to avoid the mess is to get a quesadilla maker! They're really inexpensive and you can pick one up at target. My family and friends rave about this every time I make it! With these quick changes yours will too!

I made these quesadillas for dinner tonight and I have to say they are Outstanding! This is quite possibly my favorite recipe on this website thus far. I did borrow another reviewer's suggestion and marinated the chicken similar to that of the "lime chicken soft tacos", which really enhanced the flavor of the meal. This will definitely be a regular in my menu rotation!!

Update: I made these again tonight and threw in some chopped mushrooms that I needed to use up. Great flavor! I would consider subbing the mushrooms for chicken to go completely veggie. Yum!

Everyone thought this recipe was great. This is not a super spicy dish so if you really want to kick it up a notch add some pepper jack cheese with the monterey jack cheese. I myself like plain monterey but the men like it super hot. Turning it was tricky so I tried the trick of placing another pan on top of the other and flipping it. That worked out easier than a spatula.

Delicious!  I baked them in the oven, (I sprayed one side of each shell with pam to get a "crisper" shell) for about 10-12 minutes.  I had a friend in college who made pico de gallo exactly like this, oh how I missed it & now I don't have too (fresh cilantro is key).  My only complaint is that it could use a little more heat other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks Tony!

Awesome quesadillas!  May I suggest, though, that instead of cooking them in a pan place them on a baking sheet and brush a bit of oil on the top tortilla.  Bake in a 425 oven for about 10 minutes or until crisp and melty!  Easy!!

My husband and children LOVED this recipe! It took some time to make the salsa, but it's the exact recipe I use anyway, so I was used to it. Roma tomatoes are very good for this. I paired this with the Best Ever Jalapeno Poppers. Yum!

Nah - recipe must include half extra sharp cheddar plus a white cheese (Monterey Jack or Mozzarella)  You can use a roasted chicken you get from grocery to make it easier.  And you HAVE to have guacamole for a topping as well as sour cream.  You should use roasted red, yellow or orange bell peppers - not green.   Garlic was a good idea, but would also recommend using corn tortillas as they are tastier.

Excellent! These were so good. The only thing I did different was shred my chicken breast, I think it lays better in the tortilla. I do believe it takes practice flipping them over. I will try that plate method someone mentioned next time. Thanyou.

These were delicious!  I used the one tortilla folded over method and made 3 of them.  They weren't spicy, but had a great flavor.  The fresh Pico de Gallo is the key to this one!!

Very Good!!! Will make again. next though I'll double the cheese. Maybe use cheddar with the monteray jack. other than that It uses a lot of fresh cut ingredients so prep as much ahead of time that you can. You wont be dissapointed in this recipe!!

Very good!  I love Pico de Gallo and it gave these quesadillas a nice zip!  On a personal note (which has no relevance to the recipe or it's rating!): the onion I bought was HUGE!  And the smallest I could get!  I really had to eyeball the onion I was putting in!

Add me to the happy club!  I made this tonight and the family gave it a thumbs up!  The chopping for the pico was quite intensive for a slow-bee like me, but it was worth it!  Do follow the wise folks who said get fresh cilantro.

The pico de gallo was delicious. I look forward to having this again but next time I'll either use 8 inch tortillas or get a quesadilla maker. Flipping a 12 inch tortilla was quite a chore. The chopping takes some time. Next time I'll try doing it in the morning before I go to work or the night before.
Update: The 8" tortillas were easier to flip. I put a small plate on top, flipped the pan then slid the tortilla back into the pan. I made the pico the night before and it was still great.

I love the combination of spicy chicken, gooey cheese, and the flavorful kick of the pico de gallo.  I wanted the chicken to have more flavor so I made these using leftover shredded chicken from the Slow Cooker Cilantro Lime Chicken recipe from this site.  It added even more flavor and made this recipe so easy to put together.  I will be making this recipe again and again.

We loved this recipe.  I prepared about double the pico de gallo prior and used some for the fajita topping.  I followed the other recommendations and placed the ingredients on one half of the tortilla to make it easier to flip.  After the quesadilla was done I placed them in the oven around 250-300 to keep warm until the guests arrived.

This was delicious!  I made a few modifications outside of halving the recipe: Used green chilies instead of jalapenos, used ground beef instead of chicken, omitted the 1/2 sliced onion and used mozzarella cheese instead of Monterey Jack.  I used all the pico de gallo filling inside the quesadillas instead of serving it on the side.  This was wonderful, rave reviews from my husband as well :)

I thought this was great.  Simple, easy but all the flavors together were delish.  I omitted green peppers and jalapenos (3 picky kids)- I also used frozen grilled chicken strips.  Easy, basic, but spot on!

LOL, imagine finding my own recipe (almost!) here.  I use leftover fajitas to make my quesadillas!  I came to find out how long ppl might bake their quesadillas and saw this recipe on top!!  read it and ~ wow!!  that's what we're having for dinner.  But, I use my own fajita recipe (here on allrecipes) with marinated chicken breast, onions and peppers.  and ALWAYS make my pico de gallo fresh, at least weekly, if not more often!

I made this last night for my fiance and I. I followed the recipe exactly, except 1) I used two Jalapeno peppers 2) I cut up 3 Chicken breasts instead of 2 Chicken breast halves. My fiance said I could sell them they were so good. We had just enough leftovers for him to make one for his lunch. Thank you for the wonderful recipe Tony!

Made this twice so far - really great flavor both times. Used the oven method both times (375 for 20 minus. per other reviewers.) The lime juice makes the dish - as the second time used commercial fresh salsa with cut up chunks of tomato, green pepper, onion... and just added the juice of one lime to onions peppers and chicken - still really great!

I just had this for dinner and it was really good. I used a jar of salsa I picked up in a grocery store but still, it was very good. My first Quesadilla I've ever made? Huge Success! :)

These are pretty good. The pico de gallo really helps make the dish. I finished the quesadillas in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes like another reviewer suggested and it was perfect. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it was good but it didn't blow me away. I will make these again for sure.

Excellent recipe.  I use my George Foreman to make quesadillas.  I spray one side of each tortilla and start stacking the ingredients.  There is no need to flip.

Delicious!  only suggestions are that bite size chicken seems better in the quesidilla.  1 lime is enough and can always use a little more cilantro.  also guacomole is a good edition.

this was really good, especially the pico de gallo, which i'll be making on its own for a healthy dipping sauce!  i decreased the amount of lime just to get more out of the other flavours.

Most impressive.  A few suggestions:  1. The lime flavor was a bit too much.  I might scale it back to half a lime next time.  2. I spread refried beans onto the bottom tortilla before layer on the chicken mixture, and it was a FANTASTIC addition.  Very much like our local authentic Mexican restaurant.  3.  I used the plate method to flip the quesadilla (offered by another user).  It worked perfectly.  I'll definitely be making these again!  THANKS!

Great recipie.  My wife has asked for it over and over.  Kids also really like it.

Edit:  Coming up on three years ago that I first made this recipe.  Still make it once every couple of weeks.   A couple tips I've learned...  first, for the pico dice your ingredients small it really helps with the flavor.  I also add salt.  Also with the pico I tend to strain the tomatoes if they are juicy.  I don't like the pico too mushy.  

On the grilling... I always keep a small bowl of oil on the side and coat the outsides of the quesadillas with oil as I fry.  It makes things a little easier.  To flip I just use a big spatula and get most of the tortilla on it then using my hand I tuck the far end of the tortilla over (since thats where the stuff always falls out) and then flip onto the tucked part.

I sometimes use cheddar mixed with the monterey jack as well.   

This is an absolutely great recipe.  A life-time keeper for my family.

Very good recipe.  My only suggestion is...make sure to quickly saute the onion and green pepper.  I made the mistake of leaving it on the burner for too long.  By the time I added the chicken, the vegetables lost its color and wasn't crisp.  Overall though, the quesadillas were excellent, it had the right amount of heat and spices.  It was also the perfect amount for a serving for myself, a serving for my husband, and an extra serving to eat as a snack the next day.

I recently received a new Salton Quesadilla Baker. Wow! What fun to try these for the first time. The thing that sets these quesadillas apart from the rest is the OUTSTANDING Pico de Gallo. My family loved these, and are already begging for more. This is a keeper, and the Pico de Gallo recipe will come in handy for lots of other Mexican dishes we like. Muchas gracias, Tony!

We scaled this recipe for 12 serving for a big party and it didn't turn out well at all.  There was WAY TO MUCH LIME in it!!  Very over bearing.  And with the 12 inch quesidillas you couldn't flip them- it was impossible!  Everything would fall out.  Hope you have better luck with it.  THe chicken mixture with the sauce was good- but too much lime!!

My family LOVED this dish!  Hard to find something that all five people like.  I agree, the pico de gallo was great!  To help move this recipe along quickly I purchased a roast chicken from Sam's Wholesale Club deli (they're much bigger than the grocery store deli's) and deboned it and just heated it up with the other ingredients that were sauteed.  Fabulous!

What a great recipe!  the Pico de Gallo was very tasty.  I served these quesadillas to friends on the weekend, and they thoroughly enjoyed them, as did my four kids!  Made quite a bit, too!  Great as leftovers.  Thanks for sharing!

I skipped over the part in making the sauce and used a medium garlic salsa instead; it saved me a lot of time.  I made some with chicken and some with shrimp and my husband was most impressed!  I think the key to making the quesadilla stay together in the skillet is to keep the insides small and compact.  I cut the food into very small pieces and everything stayed inside.  I also cooked very evenly over a gas flame.  Thanks for sharing!

A bit of chopping and cooking will make you the best quesadilla I have ever eaten! The fresh-made pico de gallo is wonderful- we ate the leftovers with a spoon. You can also prepare this with refried beans for a vegetarian option. Loved it!

I found this recipe good for a quick meal.  I didn't have any tomatoes so I used 1 can of Hatches tomatoes and jalapeno medium heat that was just the right amount of heat.  Next time I'm going to marinate the chicken the day before and do it on the grill and not on the stove.  yummylishus

After reading some reviews, I cut back on the lime and only used one which turned out to be a good choice.  I also added more of the pico sauce to the chicken mixture about 2/3.  If you are unsure of how to flip this, it is best to hold a plate on top of the quesadilla then flip the whole pan over then slide the quesadilla back onto the pan.  
It turned out very well and I will make this again.

Amazing Quesadillas!
Prep time was the only downside to this, but making everything from scratch really gives the dish the full flavor of all the ingredients. As many have already stated, it is missing the usual spicy kick that most Mexican food has, so I would suggest adding in more peppers/spice (like more jalapenos or chili powder) to give it the spice it needs. As for my own tastes, I would also cut out half the garlic (since the flavor was a bit pungent)and add in more saute'd onions because I don't think there was enough in there. All in all, will defiantly do again!

I pounded the chicken fairly thin before sprinkling it with taco seasoning and then grilling it.  I also used a good quality store bought pico de gallo instead of making my own just to save time.  I then cut the chicken into strips and added the pico and onion and pepper combo.  It was very good but seemed to be lacking a little salt even after the taco seasoning but that's an easy fix. I felt like I was at my favorite Mexican restaurant!

Absolutely delicious.  Next time would use eight 6" tortillas rather than four 12"...just makes it easier to cook and eat.  Yummy!

I have made this recipe three times in the last 3 weeks.  It is such a great combination of flavors.  When I made it last night, I used the chicken and pico to make burritos instead.  I served them with black beans.  Yummy!

Loved it! Thanks so much for this recipe.  I had some roasted Hatch chiles and used them instead of jalapeÃ±os.  Also, I pulled my bell pepper out of the fridge and it was unfotunately covered with mold.  I had some coconut lime roasted corn left over from last night (Parents magazine recipe at recipe.com) so I sprinkled that on top of the filling right before the cheese to make up for the missing bell pepper. My husband said it was restaurant quality. My 5 y.o. son, who hates Mexican food, said it was his favorite thing he has ever eaten besides pizza. (I made him a chile-free version.)  Thanks again! You made me a hero!

Simple and fantastic! I make this at least once a month! (I use mushrooms instead of bell peppers, and you could easy vary the recipe depending on what vegetables/meat you have on hand.) As someone else mentioned, the Pico de Gallo really makes the recipe (I make mine without cilantro or chilis and add hot sauce to the quesadilla instead).

Really awesome!  The Pic de Gallo added a nice extra element to a dish that our family is all ready very fond of.  We like to saute the chicken and/or peppers and onions in Mojo, really adds some zip!

I used smaller tortillas, easier to flip! --- also had some leftover orange bell pepper so added that to the mix. Used shredded chicken (leftover as well) and pepper jack cheese. I also cheated and bought some store pre-made (fresh) pico de gallo salsa. THAT could have used a little less jalapeno!

GREAT CONCEPT!   we tweaked things a little.  some people are complaining about the use of 2 limes and i knew from reading the recipe that it would be too much.  use only one!  i used about a 1/4 cup of cilantro, we used jarred jalapenos that we had in the fridge, we forgot about the green pepper at the store so it didn't make it in, totally didn't notice the sliced onion you're supposed to add, didn't use fresh garlic because it makes my husband sick and we changed up the cheese a bit.  we used mild cheddar (leftover in fridge), mexican blend and mozzarella.  and i took one look at that tortilla, knew it would be trouble flipping it so we put it in the oven for 18 minutes at 350.  turned out very good.  topped with sour cream and salsa.  my husband said they were restaurant quality and we were very pleased with the final product.

We love these!  Be careful, though, they can be a bit messy. We sometimes make ours with shredded chicken so they lie a little flatterâmakes them easier to flip.

My family loved these quesadillas. The only thing i had to change was the sliced onion and sliced green pepper mixture. My husband is not a fan of onions lol. Next time i will omit that part and just make it with the rest. A definite recipe that will be seen more often at my house =)

Followed to the T.  My advice is to cook one day and eat it the next for this one.    A lot of work for one person to do and then put it together and eat right away.   I mean as a quesadilla, you have to.  The flavors really are better after sitting overnight.    Make very small slices of the chicken.  And try not to put a lot of juice into the quesadilla as it will sog up pretty fast.  So chop and cook away ( and make two recipes) one night and you could have a quick good meal in a snap for at least two days.  I have three men in my house and they all thought is was an excellent FAST meal.  They obviousely did not see me in the kitchen for the prep part:)

These we pretty labor intensive for the finished result and flavor.  I doubled the recipe and I liked the pico but husband said it had too much lime in it.  Perhaps that was due to the size of tomatoes I used.  The quesadillas fell apart after flipping onto a plate and trying to slide back into the pan, even after greasing the plate I was using to slide them.  The quesadilla flavor was okay but this would've been so much easier to have made as fajitas instead.

This was super!!!! I doubled the onion and green pepper mix along with the garlic just because my wife like alot of veggies. The pico de gallo needed to be doubled also. All in all the best. Oh, I also subbed the cheese with chedder. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

These were excellent. I followed the directions exactly, although I omitted the cilantro and jalapeno because I didn't have those on hand - just used a tiny green chilli instead. Made these with the Tortillas II recipe from this site and wowie! Pico de gallo rocks!

Very good!  I used precooked chicken to cut down on the prep time.  And I always butter the tortillas before heating them.

Can I add 2 more stars to this rating? Ive tried a lot of home-made quesadilla recipes, but this one is the best by far. SO fresh, flavorful and HEALTHY! I substituted wheat tortillas, reduced fat cheese and used olive oil Pam to cut even more calories. I also cut one quesadilla in half and serve it with brown rice and fat free re-fried beans to make it a little Mexican feast!

I mardinated the chicken (for about 4 hours) in half the Pico de Gallo, and used the remaining Pico de Gallo as a topping (along with sour cream and guacamole).  I used drained/fire-roasted canned tomatoes in lieu of fresh, and omitted the green bell pepper.  Yum :-)

i have made a lot of mexican dishes from this site and this is one of my favorites. The pico de gallo is fantastic(if you can let it rest for a while, its best). I use precooked rotisserie chicken to save time. I highly recommend this recipe.

These are fantastic!  The pico de gallo is excellent - very nice and citrusy.  I followed the recipe exactly except used some leftover chicken instead of making new.  Monterey Jack is the perfect cheese for Mexican food in my opinion.  I love the combination of the grilled onions and peppers with the pico!

I made these for some friends at school, and they begged me not to leave the state! Just a few suggestions...the most important being - don't put the pico de gallo inside the quesadilla! The pico de gallo makes everything too slippery, and the quesadilla's filling falls out when cooking. The pico de gallo tastes much better when separate and used as a sauce. Other than that - I regularly substitute a red bell pepper for green, occasionally omit the jalepeno, and usually go vegetarian by omitting the chicken as well. This recipe is versatile!

Just what I needed for a Mexican fix!  I seasoned the chicken with chili seasoning, cumin and cayenne before cooking it.  I also omitted the jalapeno simply because my kids wouldn't eat it.  I made the pico but I also chopped up the green pepper small and added it.  I didn't use the second onion either.  I also cooked all of the pico simply because I don't like raw onion.  These were soooooooo yummy!  Tortilla in pan, cheese, pico and chicken.  I think the key to flipping them is not overfilling.  We added avocado and sour cream after and OMG, to die for!  My youngest devoured her 3 triangles without any hesitation and we are always waiting for her to eat!  Definitely going to make again!  I also added extra chili sauce to mine cause I like a bit more bite ;)

This recipe has become a staple at my house.  It's amazing as is, but I make these changes to suit my family's taste.  I add black beans to the chicken mixture and I use corn tortillas instead of flour.  I also add lettuce, advocodo and black olives to the top of the quesadillas along with the pico de gallo and sour cream.  This is so delish!

Delicious. I seasoned the chicken with a little taco seasoning. Also, I saved a little time on this one by doing the following: I cooked the chicken about halfway over medium high heat, and then added the garlic, onion, and green pepper to finish cooking WITH the chicken. Of course, if you do it this way, go ahead and add the 2T of olive oil at the beginning. Once the chicken was done and the veggies were tender, I turned the stove off and stirred in the pico de gallo. Another reviewer mentioned that this doesn't make very much, and I agree. I got 3 8in tortillas out of mine, so I will probably double the recipe next time. I enjoyed this very much!... a nice, delicious twist on quesadillas. The fresh pico INSIDE the quesadilla gave it a wonderful, unique burst of flavor. This will be my go to chicken quesadilla recipe from now on. Senor Cortez, I tip my hat... er, sombrero to you!

Delicious!! I did add my own changes here and there but followed the recipe for the most part, and these came out so good! My in-laws are Hispanic and don't even know how to make these, I whipped up some for them and THEY were begging me for the recipe and to make more!! You can easily tweak this to your preference. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were really good, needed more cheese though. I used shredded white meat from a rotisserie chicken, and followed the recipe exactly otherwise. It was really tasty but not quite what I was expecting based on the reviews.

delicious!  the pico de gallo is best when it sits overnight.  It is also best to drain the pico sauce before putting it in the quesadilla so they arent soggy.  These were a hit at my card party last night... even with the kids.

DELICIOUS quesadillas . . . I used half red/half green peppers, for color, salted the chicken and added just a little more cheese - the filling easily stuffed 3 full quesadillas (6 tortillas).  Served w/ fresh guac and the pico and sour cream, it's better than a restaurant!

Joined just to rate this recipe. This is
fantastic-better than any restaurant! I
loved the Pico. (Added 2 cloves garlic,2
green onions, 1/2 plain onion, used 1 lime and added celery flakes.) The Quesadillas were divine! Tony, thanks so much for a definite keeper!!!

These are super good!!!  I added lots of extra veggies and left out the jalapeno, but the pico de gallo is what really makes the difference in this recipe.  It's really simple and so, so good.  Tastes just like it does at our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I will make it often.

this was awesome - my boyfriend requests it all the time, because he loves flavorful foods with a kick. and i love it because it is still fairly healthy (we use olive oil to brown up the quesadillas).

Very good even my 4 year old liked it!! I was trying to get rid of some old hen meat,so I used stewed and shredded chicken meat.  The rest of the recipe, I followed as is.  Will make again, maybe as taco filler or burritos.  Thanks.

Absolutely delicious, and very easy to make.  I might cut back on the onion a bit but otherwise tasted wonderful.  I had this with the easy guacomole recipe from this site.

My family enjoyed.  We had three different types of cheeses that were used.  I tried mine with Monterey Jack but would use a different cheese next time.  (Personal preference)  The family also added refried beans to their
Quesadillas.  Would make again.  Thanks

I only made the pico de gallo, but it was fabulous.  My boyfriend and I ate it with chips..he even set aside his jar of store bought to eat my "homemade concoction" instead.  The only change was I used lemon juice because I didn't have lime juice.

Best Quesadillas.  I sauteed the chicken in oil/butter with chili powder, cumin and pepper.  I omitted the jalapenos in the pico de gallo and added red pepper.  For those who are curious what temp and how long, I heated the tortillas on med-high for about 2 - 3 minutes per side until golden brown and a little crunchy.  So goooooooood.

The pico de gallo is excellent.  I didn't know it was so easy to make.  I cheated and bought the pre seasoned already cooked chicken cuts.  This is a good and quick dinner.

My son said these were the best chicken quesadillas he's had and several hours later wanted to know if I made them with or without a recipe. My husband thought they were great.  Myself I'm not a quesadilla fan.  Tony thank you so much for submitting. I will definitely keep this recipe and make again.  Oh, I used monterrey/cheddar blend and also one with provalone.

Overall good recipe. Tastes good.  Would have been helpful to know size of tomato, onion, gr. pepper (sm, med, lg). I had too much onion for my pico so had to add more tomato....Hubby said was good but would've been better if Chicken had more "flavor".  Lots of prep work would probably taste just as good with store bought "fresh" deli salsa. Definitely use MORE cheese!

Oh My, this is absolutely the best quesadilla recipe I've ever tried (actually the only one I've ever tried).  Let me elaborate in saying that I've been to dozens of restaurants and have ordered quesadillas (in search of the "perfect" quesadilla) but have only come close once.  I hit the jackpot tonight on my own.  This is an explosion of flavour with the pico de gallo, and enhanced only by the mellowness of sour cream and salsa, should you choose to use it on the side.  My first slice had neither, and I was hooked.  Flavourful, easy, and I highly recommend it as an appetizer to your next Mexican-themed dinner. Try it without chicken, for a vegetarian hit!!

These, by far, are the best quesadillas I've ever had!  My only recommendation is to make the Pico de Gallo ahead of time to cut down on the prep work at dinnertime.

Fabulous!! I substituted red peppers for green and I agree with the other user that you should only saute them for about 5 minutes or so or they will lose that crunchiness. Also, I added a bit of cumin , chilli powder and corriander powder to the chicken while it was sauteing because I need my spice!!! I would recommend seasoning the chicken while sauteing, but Im not sure what its like w/o spice. 
I also used jack with jalepenos for the cheese.. YUM .. served with guac, pico and its even good with a dallop of  yogurt  instead of sour cream if you are trying to cut cals. My first time making quesadillas and my hubby and I loved it , thanks tony:)

Quesadillas are pretty hard to mess up - it's really all up to you and what you have on hand.  I generally make my quesadillas with chicken, red onion, bacon and cheese....served with pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and lettuce on the side.

Yum! We actually didn't have any jack cheese, so we used a combination of mozzerella and cheddar, 'cause they were in the fridge! It was still wonderful. And the plate trick saved us!

I absolutely ADORE quesadillas, but I have never fixed them before.  Tried this recipe and I'm hooked!  I'd fix them every day if I could.  Fixed them in a skillet on top of the stove, but I wish I had a quesadilla machine.  I had a little bit of a hard time turning it, but then I'm not the most graceful person in the world either!  To anyone viewing this recipe, all I can say is FIX THESE, THEY'RE FANTASTIC!

By the time it got to putting the quesadillas together I was sick of cooking, so we ate all the ingredients like tacos, still very good.  The BEST part though was the Pico de Gallo sauce.  SOOOOOOOO good, I added some to an avacado for guacamole, it was incredible!  I am making the pico de gallo again tonight for chips and cheese!  Thanks

Definately a keeper.  I have always tried to capture the taste of a delicious quesadilla, but have no luck until now.  I didn't eat them because I cannot eat onions, but I served them to my husband and he loved them.  Try serving them with some spanish rice.  We even put the rice in the quesadilla.  Yum, Yum.

I made this recipe exactly the way it calls for, but omitted the green peppers and just used more onions.  I used red onion which gave it a nice flavor.  I also served it with fresh homemade guacomole (recipe also from the site), sour cream and salsa.  I also used the smaller flour tortilla and cut it into quarters.  It seemed easier to manager the smaller tortillas.  Thanks for the recipe - It was great!

Wonderful.  We have eaten this at twice a month for several months now.  It is even good if you are missing the lime juice and cilantro like I often am.  We add more cheese to our tastes and I use smaller 6 or 8 inch tortillas.

I will never order quesadillas at a restaurant again because these were better than any I have ordered out!  The pico de gallo is even good for just dipping with chips.  In fact, I made extra pico (at the request of my fiance) to dip tortilla chips in.

This was delicious! My husband and I couldn't help making 'yummy' noises during dinner. I wouldn't say it's good for kids, though. My 3 year old wasn't too keen on this, but we thought it was great. I used a white (Spanish) onion for the Pico de Gallo; it's sweeter than a yellow onion and gave it a great flavor.

Made this a few weeks ago and can't wait to make again! THE best quesadillas I have ever had (hubby loved them too). Takes some time but so worth it - yummy!

Loved these.  I make Pico de gallo all the time since I have fresh tomatoes and jalapenos in my garden.  I did cheat a little with this though.  I hate flipping tortillas in a pan, so I assembled everything and baked them in the oven.  It worked out much easier for me.

Excellant!  We loved it!!  I added green chilis instead of jalapeno-came out delicious.  This will be a staple in our home and added to my book of favorite recipes.  Highly recommended.

These were really good (I passed the recipe on to my sister, too!) but my kids didn't eat it. I think I need to leave out the bell pepper and onions for them. I will use this recipe often to cook for company, though, and don't be afraid to try it w/ your kids - mine are just not into veggies as much as they should be. :)

These were absolutely delicious! Tastes so much like Taco Cabana chicken quesadillas. I put pico inside with the cheese and chicken and served with chipotle salsa on the side and added fajita seasoning to the chicken.

This is a great recipe.  The pico de gallo sauce is easy to make and taste great.  My husband said it was better than the quesadillas in restaurants.

So good and easily customized for different tastes! We used grated pepper jack cheese instead of Monterey jack, and cooked our (generously salted and peppered) chicken breasts on the grill before cutting them up for the quesadillas. I was suspicious of using 2 entire limes for the pico de gallo, so I squeezed to taste and discovered I only really wanted about 1/2 a lime in there. The result was perfect for my taste, but like I said this is a very easy recipe to customize.

Tasted pretty good. The only thing I did was baked it instead of frying it on skillet. It came out great, but I think it would've tasted better if it was made on the skillet. I didn't make the sauce, but I topped it with homemade guacamole, sour cream & salsa. Yum

It was so simple, and tasted AMAZING, reminded me of my Abuelita's(Grandmother's) cooking! My husband really loved it! I did not mix the chicken with the sauteed pico de gallo/pepper = less watery still great!

I ended up with a different meal than what the recipe makes but everyone loved it anyway.  I made the pico de gallo as the directions stated.  For the chicken we made a mix of chili powder, cumin and oregano and cooked the chicken with the spices and some olive oil.  I left out the onion, bell pepper and garlic mix and used cheddar cheese instead of Monterey jack cheese.  We put cheese, chicken, and the pico de gallo on the tortilla and ate it like a soft taco.  We also had "Black Bean and Corn Salad II" as a side dish.

These were really good!  I'm not a huge fan of jalepeno, so I may try omiting or decreasing these next time.  Best quesadilla recipe I've tried.  And very filling.  My husband loved them.  I couldn't find 12" tortillas, so I used 6" and made 4 quesadillas.

Made this the night before last and it was very filling. Family loved it. The only thing that I changed was that I finished it using my quesadilla maker. I'm not a huge bell pepper fan so for future reference I would add less of those and more lime in the pico de gallo because I like an extra kick. Will definitely make again. :)

I loved these.  Making Quesadillas this way made them seem more like a dinner than just a snack.  There was a little more substance than the way I usually just throw some together.  Delicious and definitely a keeper!

This is by far the BEST Quesadillas I have ever had, and the Pico de Gallo is like no other. This is now a family favorite! However, it is a bit spicy for the kids so I will probably make it for company instead or reduce the amount of jalapeno. I do wish I would have read the reviews ahead of time, because it is a very time consuming recipe, but well worth it. I will do as suggested and do all the prep the day before. The Pico de Gallo is so good we are going to take the leftovers and blend it to make a salsa like dip for chips. I can see already that the Pico de Gallo is going to get used quite a lot at our house, it may replace salsa all together! Thanks so much for a great recipe!!!

Excellent recipe! We used whole wheat wraps and venison instead of chicken, omitted the olive oil and instead used a mist of olive oil cooking spray before starting the quesadilla itself (to cut back on calories). We served it with guacamole (Bob Cody's recipe) and sour cream.. turned out GREAT. My boyfriend said it was the best venison meal he's had. We will definitely be making this again, so healthy and delicious!

So good! The only thing I like to do is spread guacamole on the tortilla before I put my other ingredients, the creaminess really adds that extra something, plus the flavor is outstanding.

Delicious! Absolutely Delicious! Only thing I did different was I used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella because I did not have Jack.  I, followed the directions except I boiled and shredded the chicken and I cooked the quesadillas on my panini press.... To quote my 5 year old.... "Best Dinner Ever!"

These were delightful. IMO simple flavors are always the best and this recipe was no exception. The pico de gallo was flavorful and was the perfect accoutrement to the quesadillas. This will definitely be my go to recipe for Pico de Gallo!

This is the best quesadilla I've ever had. I didn't have limes so I used lemons instead and it turned out great. The tortillas didn't fit in my skillet so I used a cookie sheet over the stove to brown the quesadillas. The pico de gallo kept it authentic and fresh.

I agree that a good prepared salsa would be just about as good and less work. Another way I make it easier is to use rotisserie chicken, which also adds some nice flavor.

I thought this was very good but it just seemed to be missing something for me.  I don't know if the chicken needed some seasoning or what it was.  Also, the pico de gallo is good, but I think it would have tasted just as good and been faster to just use your favorite salsa instead.  We love Jack's Special Salsa so I think I'll just try this concept but with that salsa next time.

Love the recipe, with a few tweaks of my own, my whole family devoured it!  I used leftover grilled (very smoky) chicken breasts from a party the day before and subbed the jalepeno' with a couple of smokey chipotle' peppers (no seeds). When we were ready to assemble, I grilled them over hot hickory chips and we again ate them outside on the deck!  Wonderful flavor coupled with wonderful atmosphere and family and we have a HUGE hit on our hands!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The salsa itself was incredible! I used a little bit of it to make home-made guacamole and it was just out of this world. The part about cooking the chicken in the Pico de Gallo didn't work out so well for me . It made my tortillas soggy, which made it impossible to turn the quesadillas in the pan. I should have possibly drained the salsa before combining it with the chicken. Also, the flavor was a little bland for my taste. I may use this recipe again, especially the Pico de Gallo, only will try to prepare it differently or will make nachos with the ingredients:)

My family of 6 (4 kids under 7) all loved it.  To make it a little faster, I bought a bag of frozen chicken fajita strips, started with step 3 and went from there.  There was more than enough food to fill everyone up!!!  I would rec using 1 lime instead of 2 as the juice was just a little overpowering.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these for the first time tonight, not only were they easy...they were AWESOME!  The Pico was SO yummy and fresh.  I used extra cilantro becasue I LOVE it.  Next time I think I will add a little more lime juice as well.   I also had leftover chicken breast from last night's dinner so that made this much quicker and easier to put together.  I am glad my husband was here to do the flipping duty because I probably would not have been able to myself.  I think using half the tortilla and folding it over may be the better option.  Definetly make extra pico for dipping chips in! YUMMY :)

4 stars b/c I did change a little. The pico is 5 though! Very good. I used pepper jack cheese b/c they didn't have the off brand of the other. I think I'll continue to use it b/c it made it a little spicier, which I love. I also seasoned my chicken while cooking it with cumin, chili powder, lime juice, paprika, and garlic powder and left out the onions since there is enough in the pico. Awesome Awesome Awesome! I love this! Put in oven for just a few minutes instead of flipping.

WOW! VERY VERY VERY good. I followed the recipe exactly. I was tempted to make some changes that others suggested, but decided not to... and they were very good! The leftovers did not taste so good..but fresh they are amazing. The pico de gallo turned out perfect too! I had to tell everyone I actually made it bc they thought I bought it!

I made this many months ago, and have made it many times since. It's a great recipe for quesadillas, but find myself using the pico de gallo recipe much more - topped on nachos or baked chicken, or simply in a bowl served with tortilla chips. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these were incredible. I wouldn't have thought to put the pico de gallo inside the quesadilla, but it was great that way. My husband didn't agree and liked his better on the outside, but either way, the pico de gallo recipe is delicious. I only put in about half the jalepeno, but that's because I'm a baby when it comes to spicy foods. Also, when I cooked the chicken, I sprinkled some garlic powder and lime juice over it to give it some extra flavor. I will no doubt be making these again.

Recipe was simple to follow and I made triple of the Quesadillas  but only one recipe of the Pico De Gallo as it made a lot. I found the Pico De Gallo to be to much onion taste for me so will reduce the onion next time I make this. The next day the onion was all I tasted in it.

This was a good recipe. I always season meat or chicken with Adobo. I read other reviews where they said the meat was bland. I used frozen mixed yellow, green, and red bell peppers to add more flavor.  The other change i made was not to put the pico de gallo in the quesadilla. I served it on the side along with sour cream.

This was GREAT!  I make pico all the time, just a larger amount and in the winter I used canned petite diced tomatoes, while the taste is not as great as with summer tomatoes, it works.  This was my first time making quesadillas and it was quite easy, so easy in fact I made bacon, egg and cheese quesadillas this morning for breakfast, I only wish I had remembered to put some of the pico in with the eggs!

These are excellent. I use red onions. I also try to cook the peppers and onions just slighty, so they still have a bit of crunch left. I think it improves the texture of the quesadillas.

I would have given this 10 stars if I could. The only thing I added different was my own roasted corn (1 tablespoon of oil and either fresh corn off the cob or canned corn and roast over medium heat till nice and brown) and that gave it a nice flavor. I also made the spanish rice II from this site and had a nice fiesta. I will make this again and again. Thanks so much for sharing.

This is def a 5 star recipe, but I altered it a bit so that's why I gave it 4.  I followed another reviewer's advice and made the pico de gallo ahead of time-the night before in fact.  I also added salt, pepper, and dried cilantro when I was sauteeing the pepper and onion.  I increased the garlic to 1 tbsp of jarred minced garlic-I LOVE garlic!!  I also added 2 sliced jalapenos with the chicken mixture when I was assembling the quesadilla-leaving the seeds in for one of them.  I also used whole wheat tortillas for a more nutritious meal.  I tried the oven method that was recommended by several people-but the top tortilla didn't melt on well.  Even with extra cheese.  I will def try the plate and skillet method next time, just not looking forward to that with cast iron!!!  Overall this was very tasty-just a bit messy too...  :-)

The quesadillas stand alone really don't have very much flavor which is why this isn't a five star review. I would give this a two or a three because of that but the pico is so refreshing and good that it makes up for it. I think the downer is that the chicken really has no taste to it. If I do make this again, it'll be with a spicier cheese and some fajita or taco seasoning that would compliment the pico.

Excellent flavour.  It was a little bit of work chopping then sauting everything, but the end result was worth it. One of our favorite recipes now.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1 tortilla, folded in half, for ease of cooking.

I loved this recipe!!!! The hubby even said it was a 5 star meal. Next time I would use less lime but overall it was delicious. I paired the quesadillas with a Mexican corn and black bean soup.

Wonderful recipe. I put them together finally in a panini press. Excellent taste. My only mistake was not to drain the part of the salsa I mixed in with the meat, so it made the bottom of the quesadilla a little wet. But it was an excellent recipe and hubby gave it a 10!

I thought these were very tasty and pretty easy to make. They were missing something however, like spice or zing. Maybe some hotsauce or a bit of salsa is in order

I used this recipe for the pico de gallo and it was DELICIOUS!  We have a friend who used to live in New Mexico and he's the king of pico de gallo, now I don't have to wait to be invited to their house anymore to have this wonderful and delicious treat! I forgot to get a fresh jalapeno pepper, so I used jalapenos from the jar- still excellent! FYI- This is only good the day you make it, after that it gets too watery and loses its fresh taste.  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great.  I made it for a crowd and everyone loved it.  I altered it a little by using lemon instead of lime juice.  I also probably made 1 1/2 recipes of pico sauce and added it all to chopped chicken that I had from boiling and deboning a chicken.  I made sure that there was not too much juice though when I put the chicken mixture on top of the tortillas.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Worth making for the salsa alone! We didn't have fresh tomatoes, so we used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes, drained.  Worked great.  Ended up using 4 Tbs lime juice, which seemed to give the salsa the proper consistency.  

This is our new standby Mexican recipe!

The Pico de Gallo in this recipe was out of this world!!  By far, better than I have had in any restaurant.  I made these exactly as stated in the recipe, however, I seasoned my chicken.  They took some prep work, and I wasn't sure exactly how I was going to flip the quesadillas without the filling coming out.  I finally found that inserting a plate into the pan, and flipping them works out perfectly!!  My 15 month old and I devoured these tonight.  My 3 year old is a bit picky, and pulled out all the stuff he didn't like.  Unfortunately, my first batch wasn't as crispy as it should have been, and my husband ate the soggy quesadillas, and he was turned off from dinner.  I asked him to try the one that the rest of us were eating from, but he didn't want to.  I will try this again maybe in a few months when my hubby can look at them again.  Thank you for a delicious recipe!!

Excellent!  I made this last night and I'm looking forward to the leftovers from today.  The lime juice plays off the cilantro and jalapenos very nicely.  I substituted low-fat ranch dressing for the sour cream for dipping.  I'll definitely make this again.

Absolutely YUMMY!! I made the following changes however, I used green chili peppers instead of jalapeno peppers. I also added more cheese & threw in some mild cheddar cheese as well. Before cooking the chicken I added salt, pepper, garlic powder & onion powder to taste. I used frozen vegetables (onions & green peppers), however that makes the flour tortillas a bit soggy. Next time I will allow the vegetables to completely thaw and then drain them.

Wow, these were awesome. Followed advice and went with one lime, two probably would have been okay with our family. Used the technique of filling the tortilla in half, very easy to flip that way. Very filling. These will be a regular in our house.

This was pretty good!  I used Mission brand Jalapeno Cheddar tortillas.  They are very large so I just folded one tortilla in half for each quesadilla.  I ended up being able to make 3 quesadillas of this size.  The pico de gallo wasn't the best I've had by itself...but it tasted good inside the quesadillas.

The best ever!!! I really didn't care for quesadillas until I tried these and OMG they are yum yum. My husband and my two children loved them and my four and five year old are very picky eaters. 
!GREATNESS! 
I also used the Easy Guacamole recipe from allrecipes.com it was super yummy as well.

The Pico in this recipe is great. We "cheated" a little and used the Frozen Tyson Fajita Flavored chicken and it was great. We enjoyed the Pico with chips too.

What an awesome recipe!  Quesadillas have always been bland and boring around here.  Tonight's quesadilla, however, knocked my guys' socks off (two sons, only one husband).  Thanks a million for sharing!

I liked these a LOT! I like my pico de gallo with more cilantro , so that's the only thing i did differently. Also, i came out with two quesadillas instead of one (4 tortillas needed). Great!!

These were delicious and went together easily.  They are especially fast if the pico de gallo is made ahead.  Then they're a snap!  I was afraid they might be too spicy, so I used only 1/2 jalapeno.  I'd use more next time as they were very mild.  Fabulous recipe!

These were really good. I put the filling on one half of a large tortilla and folded the other half on top. That made it much easier to flip without it falling apart.

i never thought quesadillas were so easy to make! i made some changes however, and my husband & I really enjoyed the meal.  I added some spices to the cut chicken and let it marinate for a bit - i marinated with some cumin, salt and pepper, and some cajun seasonings i had lying around my kitchen.  I also added zuchinni to my veg mixture.  Additionally, for a more crispier quesadilla, i lightly brushed some olive oil onto the tortilla before heating.  this is a great light meal, esp if you get low cholesterol tortillas... thank you so much! this ones a keeper!

This is a great recipe. Someone mentioned that they are messy and hard to flip...I followed a tip from an old review to use a plate to help you flip the quesadilla (just use an oven-proof mitt to protect your hand and wrist)

I live in England and I've never heard of quesadillas - and I've just found out what we've been missing.  What a gorgeous recipe.  I used the refried beans that someone else mentioned and my family enjoyed every single bite.  Now I have to explain that we can't have the same meal every evening....

These bad boys are a must make. They were excellent.  Everybody loved it.  If they weren't so filling, they would have asked for seconds.  The pico de gallo was easy and quick.  make sure you seed your tomatoes.  The hardest thing was to cook the chicken.  I served these monsters with Best Spanish Rice which was a nice compliment. Great recipe.  Thanx Tony

The pico de gallo was excellent.  I made a lot and saved it to have with nachos and guacamole.  I used habanero peppers instead of jalapeno peppers and doubled the amount to make it spicier and it was just the right amount.  I had an exceptional amount of trouble flipping the quesadillas and the chicken and cheese kept falling out of the sides and causing the tortillas to burn.  I recommended this recipe to a friend of mine who has a quesadilla maker and she had absolutely no trouble and the quesadillas were incredible!

Though these were not the best I have had I did think they were very good. I made the pico sauce as instructed but added some garlic salt and onion salt to it. I did add some southwest seasoning to the chicken while browning and again to the top of the quesidilla. I did bake mine in the oven and then added some additional shredded cheese on the top the last couple of minutes. Overall made a very good meal.

These were really good.  I think next time I'll use cooked chicken strips, or leftover chicken to save time.  The pico de gallo was excellent.  I would add a little more tomato though.  Overall, this was wonderful!  Thank You for the recipe!

OH MY GOSH! These were top notch! Better than what I get at my favorite Mexican place! I almost can't believe how delish they turned out! I didn't have to change a thing in the recipe. Thanks SO very much for such a super recipe! :o)

These were WONDERFUL!!! The leftover chicken mixture is very good heated up and eaten plain.  This is actually quite easy and quick and the reward is huge!

We made these again for New Years Eve but used them as fajitas instead. They were awesome.  We just put the meat mixture in a roaster and let everyone their own cheese, sour cream and fixings, we heated the shells up on a warm electric skillet as we needed them. great recipe, I am making them again now but i am going to cut the chicken up in smaller thiner pieces.

This dish is very (VERY) good and easy!   I added more chicken for leftovers and also some cumin to my chicken while sautÃ©ing.  I will definitely make this a Sunday (football - GO BUCS!!) tradition.  :o)

Not that you need another rave review for this one, but I had to say, this recipe ROCKS!!! It is so fresh tasting and awesome. I trippled it and served it to my playgroup-everyone talked about it for hours. Gave the recipe to everyone.
Didn't change one thing. Thanks so much:)

Yes, it's very good.  We wanted something light for dinner tonight, but if we'd been hungrier, a single recipe wouldn't have been enough for the two of us.  I'd double it next time.  I love cilantro, so add more as well as more cheese too; I was cautious with the jalapeno but next time, would add a whole one rather than just half of one.  I also baked it in the toaster oven for the final step rather than a skillet.  Thanks for sharing this one, Tony.

We enjoyed this recipe very much, It was a great way to use up leftover chicken that I had . I didn't have green pepper and onion so I used green onions instead. I also threw some cumin and 2 cloves of garlic for more flavor.
The pico de gallo turned out wonderfully as did the qeusadillas.
Thanks for this recipe we will be using this again and again. Sonya

This was AWESOME!  I did tweak it just a bit--but not much!  I sauteed the sliced chicken breast in olive oil and seasoned the chicken with the Pampered Chef's Southwestern Seasoning (it is sooooo yummy--I am a consultant and it is one of my favorites!).  I also cooked the peppers and onions together and basically carmelized them.  I then warmed the flour tortillas in the microwave and got them nice and warm, piled the fillings in the middle and folded it like a taco and ate it.  We just finished eating and I am already craving this again for the next time! Hubby loved it too!

Deeelish!!  My first time making this and it was a breeze.  I'm not a spicy food lover and the pico de gallo was just right.  However, if you like hot, add more jalepeno or include the seeds of  the jalepeno.  I also seasoned the chicken strips before cooking with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder to give it some flavor.  I would definitely make this again.

Absolutely awesome!!!  The pico de gallo was one of the best I've tried ever.  I made this at the last minute and used Perdue Chicken Short-Cuts.  I was afraid that this would have cut down on the quality of the dish, but it was still fantastic!!!  Can't wait to make again!

Wow!  This is a wonderful recipe.  The Pico de Gallo is so much better than the restaurants around here.  We eat these all the time.  We like to add mushrooms to the quesadillas and we cook them on a tabletop flat grill.  Very easy.

I made these quesadillas last night for my fiance and his parents. I was nervous to make dinner for his mother who is an amazing cook. I followed the recipe closely, but substituted 8 in. tortillas for 12 in.  I also covered my skillet with a plate and flipped them over together to avoid spilling the contents out. What a success!  Everyone loved it....especially his mother. She even asked for the recipe! Thanks Tony!!!

Delicious!  I made two quesadillas with this - put half the ingredients on each tortilla, then folded each in half, so they were much easier to flip.  I used my grilling pan on the barbecue, and it worked great.  Will definitely make again.

Very tasty. It took some extra time to make and it wasn't the neatest process in the world but the results were worth it. I don't think I would make this if I were entertaining because the presentation wouldn't be much. But then, that could be just me. I can never flip a quesadilla with much success! ;)

Wow! What a treat this was! Not that quick or easy but so what? Everyone loves it. Spray the skillet with pam is my only recommendation. You will be so glad you tried this one! Tony you rule!!

Very yummy - I would make one suggestion, though.  Instead of putting a tortilla on top of the filled tortilla and flipping, why not just use only one tortilla and flip one side over (like an omlette.)  I had a hard time flipping due to the size of my filled tortilla. Very tasty, though.  Thanks!

The pico de gallo mixture was fantastic! I only
modified the recipe a little bit by grilling the 
chicken, then shredding it and putting on the
tortilla with the cheese and pico de gallo mixture. It saved a few steps this way, and tasted great.

OH MY GOODNESS!! These were absolutely FABULOUS!! These are better than any I have ever eaten at any restaurant. The pico de gallo is definitely the key. My five year old daughter asked for seconds! I will definitely make this over and over again.

This was GREAT!  I baked it in the oven for about 3 minutes per side...it was much easier to turn over that way.  I LOVED the salsa mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was excellent.  I changed the Pica De Gallo which I HIGHLY recommend.  2 large cloves of minced garlic, 2/3 C cucumber, peeled, seeded and finely diced. 5 Finely diced radishes, and 1 TBL White wine vinegar instead of the olive oil and of course the fresh lime juice. This is what I added to the exsisting recipe.  Lots of veggies and let me tell you it was worth the chopping. I also used the recipe from this site Easy Guacamole, which was an excellent addition to add even more yummy flavor.  Try it with the extra veggies you will be very please. Lori

Yum!  We have tacos and fajitas all the time and this was a refreshing flavor change.  It's also a good pico de gallo recipe for just eating with chips (although I'd use a little less lime juice for that).  Highly recommended.  I didn't feed it to the kids -- just made them cheese quesadillas.

This recipe is a keeper.I used smaller tortillas vs. one large one, it is much easier to flip over and it is easily cut into wedges. In addition to the pico de gallo, I added an envelope of frajita seasoning to the chicken. Fabulous! All 5 kids loved it. Thank you, Tony!

These were good, but the cilantro was a little strong.  It was very hard to flip over and I made a mess. Next time I will make two halves instead of a whole so that I can flip it easier.

These tasted a lot like fajita quesadillas.  I made a few changes.  I used quite a bit more cheese and ended up making four 6 inch tortilla-sized quesadillas.  I had to use drained, canned diced tomatoes so we had salsa rather than pico de gallo.  For quickness I used a chunk of deli chicken that I shredded in the food processor.  That was my only error.  I can't wait to make them with chicken that I grill myself.  Also, I baked mine at 350 until the cheese melted.  The bottom was the slightest bit moist, but I didn't have to deal with trying to turn them over.  I was chicken.  :-)  Thanks for a good recipe.

This certainly isn't a quick dish, but it's good. It was a little hard to flip the quesadilla when it was full. Perhaps I filled it too much. I used smaller tortillas and ended up with three quesadillas. Will definitely make this again.

YUMMMM...I used Louis Rich pre-cooked chicken to save time and I do have to say it is the easiest BEST recipe I have ever prepared.  Definately restaurant quality...I made two small quesadillas but next time will double the recipe for more.

These quesadilla's tasted awesome!!  Being a working mom, I did use a few shortcuts to save time.  First, I bought the store bought fresh salsa that you can buy in the vegetable section in the supermarket.  I also bought shredded cheese.  2 minor changes I made were to cut the chicken into bite size pieces instead of strips, which made it easier to eat, and I used red bell peppers instead of green.

I've made this a few times, and love it! I don't make the pico myself, tho, I buy it premade at the store. I also don't add the peppers to the filling as I don't really care for them. One other thing I do differently, is I just use one tortilla, and fold it in half over the filling. Much easier to flip!

WAY TOO MUCH LIME! 
I did as the recipe called for and it was too much lime. I think that ONE lime is good enough. I was worried about it being dry and I didn't realize at the time that the tomato will add it's own moisture to the salsa. 
I would only do one lime!

Wow, this recipe is perfection. Everyone in my family loved it. I have always made quesadillas but this recipe takes it up a notch. The flavor is outstanding. I made it just as the recipe calls for but I did marinate my meat during the day.  If you love quesadillas you must try this recipe. Thanks Tony

The pico is awesome!  Donât change a thing. I cannot eat bell peppers so I left them out, used a whole small onion. I also added 1/4 cup of white wine during the sautÃ©. It turned out delicious!! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Great tasting and colorful meal.  We are living in the Middle East and I was unable to use Monterrey Jack cheese, so I substituted Gouda .  I also used the large pita bread and we were all pleased.  We will make this recipe again.  We have to have our Tex/Mex!!

I made it exactly as the recipe said. The only problem was turning that large of a tortilla while it was filled with so much chicken, cheese and pico de gallo. But it tasted delicious!! The family loved it!

Excellent. I don't even like cilantro and I loved this, as did my family. Be sure to slice the chicken small and thin, as I will next time.

The pico de gallo itself was excellent.   I will make it again as a "salsa" for chips or bread.  Trying to turn this into quesadillas was difficult for us -- the chicken/pico mixture was tasty, but it became a bit of a gooey mess when we assembled the whole thing.  We ended up scraping the mixture off the tortillas and eating it as goop.

It's delicious if the Pico de Gallo is made right. Real Pico doesn't have jalapenos in it. I got that right from a native Mexican woman who works with her parents in their restaurant in our home town.

This was easy to make and tastes very good, my picky husband loved it too.  Didn't have any JalapeÃ±os so I used a couple of dried red peppers.  Only made 1/2 the  recipe and it was enough for 2.

I made these in a quesadilla maker and only filled them with the chicken and cheese. We ate them with the pico de gallo on the side and I used native fresh tomatoes. The family loved them.

As many have said, do not skip on the pico! It's perfect. Make it alone and serve with chips. But the quesadilla recipe is perfect. I boiled the chicken and let it cool while I chopped veggies. Then ripped the chicken apart with my fingers and went straight to the sautÃ©ing of peppers and onions.  I also used 10 inch tortillas. Easy to heat in a normal pan, as well as flip over. When my fiancÃ© asked what was for dinner, I told him a quesadilla. He thought it wouldn't be enough to fill him up. Low and behold, he only ate two slices and was stuffed. This was my first quesadilla that I made at home. Delicious!!!!!! Will make many more times. Thank you for sharing. *** use the easy guacamole recipe as an extra added delicious addition.

Absolutely delicious!! One runs out of things to say but this was SOOO good. For the kids I omitted the jalapeÃ±o & kept it in for the adults. I used red onion for the pick de gallo & white for the quesadilla. The kids (ages 6 &4) ate an entire one themselves. Definitely will be making this again thank you Tony for an amazing recipe!!

Great recipe when you're short on time! I forgot to buy jalapeÃ±os so I just added a little bit if cayenne pepper to the chicken, I also added some cumin. Using a plate to flip the quesadilla was a great tip!

Used a can of Hunts fire roasted diced tomatoes  did not drain, 3 stalks of green onion finely diced, 1 teasp of garlic powder, salt and 1/2 teasp black pepper. No jalapeno ( husband cant handle heat) and the cilantro and lime juice for the pico.
For the chicken I sprinkeld  paprika, onion, garlic, black pepper and salt on bone in skinless breasts. Roasted for 30 minutes then turned over for another 30 minutes. Shredded and proceeded with recipe.

Good quesadillas. I skipped step 2 because I used some shredded leftovers roast chicken. Also, I felt this was going to be on the bland side without some traditional Tex Mex spices. So, I seasoned with some cumin, chili powder and pinch of dried oregano. And I used the panini maker in the last step.

I made this and the main issue with this recipe is there are no seasonings mentioned. Luckily, I marinate my meats before cooking anyway. I bought my pico de gallo from the store to save time. Other than that, the step by step procedure helped a lot and that is why i gave it 3 stars.

I can't believe I made these in my OWN kitchen!  Restaurant quality for sure.  Only changes I made were to use 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper instead of the jalapeno pepper since I didn't have any and used 2 tsp dried cilantro since I didn't have fresh.  Used whole wheat tortillas and cooked them in my George Foreman Grill.  Perfect!  Served them with guacamole, sour creme and picante.  Can't wait to try these with shrimp and steak.

I used red onion for the pico de gallo and cooked the chicken with adobo seasoning. I also used small tortillas so that it would be easier to flip. Great recipe!

YUM!!  I'd recommend using chicken tenderloins; they're so soft n tender.  Next time I will shred the chicken so it will lie flatter between the tortillas.  Loved the pico de gallo.  So worth it!!  Next time I make it I will marinate the pico de gallo in the fridge for an even more intense flavor.  Ole!

This was truly delicious. I used leftover chicken breast, that I put in at the end, just to quickly heat up. I replaced green pepper with orange pepper. I used the cheese I had on hand which was old cheddar. The trick with the plate works great. I heated the leftovers up the next day in frying pan, equally delicious!

Absolutely fabulous!  Definitely will make again. Made exactly as described except I grilled the chicken in a countertop grill, which added a bit of smoky flavour and was faster.  Loved it, thanks for sharing!

Wonderful! Switched the jalapeno to green chilies so the kids would like them (although they would probably be even better with jalapenos!) Flipped them easily with a plate as recommended. We will be making this when friends come over for dinner! Thanks for the recipe!!!

These were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  The only thing I did differently was use jarred jalapenos because that is all I had.  My mother came home and grabbed a couple slices and after tasting ask my father where he had bought them!  It was a surprise for her when she found out we made them.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

I made this recipe the other night and it was DELICIOUS! only thing i did was add a dash of salt and pepper when i cooked the chicken and made a guacomole sauce (avocado, minced garlic, tomatoe, lime juice, salt, onions) to accompany the pico de gallo sauce..the hubby loved it!

Yum, these quesadillas rock!  The first time we made these we used a quesadilla maker, but soon discovered that they are much better if you use a pan on the stove, with the quesadilla maker you lose all of the gooey insides.  We also have found that if you use a chopper and finely chop the peppers and onion they are even better because they are distributed more evenly.

For the pico de gallo on its own, it gets a sure 5/5.  It smells and tastes fantastic.  With the quesadillas its just good.  I used just one onion and that was more than enough, using about 1/4 of it for the pico.  I also think the chicken would probably be best off baking so that you can cook the onion and bell pepper quicker.  I baked the quesadillas as well to make the process go quicker.  The recipe needed a little something extra, I just can't put my finger on it.  Perhaps its the fact that the pico de gallo is the only thing that brought flavor to the mix, the chicken, the tortillas...these were pretty bland.  I will probably make these again for my husband and myself, I just won't pull out this recipe for company.  Although...that pico was so delicious I might just use that on its own for a chip salsa.  I cheated and used canned tomatoes (our garden is out) and dried cilantro and it was still drool worthy. Imagine if it was all fresh!

This was fabulous. I omitted some of the onion from the pico (too much for my taste) and it was absolutely delicious. Also, a trick to help you turn them - melt butter (or margarine) in the pan and then put the tortilla in. Helps them slide better. I used the plate method and that worked best. This was hands down the best quesadilla I've ever had... Thanks so much!

Mmmm, mmm, mmm!  These were so tasty!  I followed the recipe except for getting lazy at the last minute and using canned chicken, but it was really great!  I used the flour tortillas for my kids and I used corn tortillas for my own because of fewer calories and higher fiber.  We all loved them!  I also cut back on calories by heating my griddle to 375 and using Pam cooking spray on the griddle and then spraying the tortilla tops again before flipping them over to cook on the other side.  Definitely going to be a favorite recipe now!

Very tasty. Spicy enough without the jalepeno peppers, as we forgot to buy them at the store. Will add to the recipe next time as we will make this again.

Very tasty and a quick & filling lunch.  I used leftover grilled chicken (Key West Chicken) and didn't add any of the tomato pico to the quesadilla as I was using ripe-from-the-garden tomatoes and was afraid they would be too juicy and make the tortilla soggy as other reviewers noted.

This deserves more than five stars; it is amazing.  I agree, add some garlic to the pico de gallo for that extra umph.  There's no doubt about it, I will make this again.

Loved it, but the pico de gallo made my dillas a little on the soggy side. We ate them with a fork.  My fault I suppose...try not to put any liquid in your dillas!

Absolutely Superb! I followed the recipe EXACTLY & it turned out wonderful! It was very easy to make & the flavors blended perfectly. It is even better than the one my favorite restaurant makes! I used another posters idea of using a plate to help flip them & it worked great! Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe!

Wonderful.  Very fresh flavor.  One change - only for ease of preparation - is to use one tortilla and fill half with the toppings and then fold over as opposed to using 2 tortillas and having to deal with flipping.  We omitted the sauted green peppers and onions and also added some leftover grilled corn and about a teaspoon of sugar to the pico.  Yum.

I only used this recipe for the pico...It was amazing!  Will use this with all my Mexican dishes now.  Much better than any salsa you can buy in the store.  Excellent with deep fried tortillas as a snack.  Update: Made this recipe for dinner and it was wonderful.  Best I've tasted so far.  And I still use the pico as a staple for any Mexican dish I make. Thanks again for the great addition to my collection.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I let the pico sit for about an hour before making the quesadillas.  I tried baking them in the oven like others suggested, but it never seemed to crisp and come together.  Next time, I will definately cook on stove top.

Great authentic Mexican recipe!  If Taco Bell is as Mexican as you get I doubt you will care for it.  I thought it was wonderful... even better than my fav. Mexican restaurant!   I used whole-wheat tortillas and no oil- it was delicious as can be.

I received a quesadillas cooker for a gift and always looking for recipes to use with it.  This was excellent.  I only used 1 lime because my tomatoes were on the small side.  Also used very little jalapeno because I didn't want it too spicy for toddler.  Everything else was the same.  Whole fam gobbled them up.

Thought this was fantastic and extremely simple and cheap. Despite the fact that there are no special spices or strange ingredients, the taste was superb. Also used the plate trick which was helpful. Gonna make these again soon

Delicious! I used a can of drained, diced tomatoes and 2 tsp of dried cilantro in place of fresh, and 1 lime instead of two. Also, I cooked the quesadillas in the oven for 10 mins at 350. After, I switched the oven to broil and crisped each side up. I will definitely be making this again.

The taste is lovely and fresh -- I love it.  However, I am quesadilla challenged, and had lots of trouble with "assembly" !  I've made this a couple of other times, and found that putting all the veggies in the food processor and shredding the chicken more makes it all stay together better.  I'm sure there are more tricks...  But they aren't in the recipe :)

I have never tried pico sauce on a quesadilla before.  Great suggestion.  I used leftover grilled chicken.  There was more lime juice than I was used to.  It still tastes fabulous. I made extra pico to top tacos the next day.  Make the sauce a little ahead of time, if you can.  The flavors will develop.

WOW!!  This was really, really good!  I'm rating it 5 stars because I had every thing in my pantry and it was a last minute meal.  HUGE flavor on these quesadillas.  This made 3 big quesadillas 1 more than the recipe stated.  The pico de gallo is awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used red instead of green pepper- just a personal preference.  I should have doubled the pico de gallo.  WOW, WOW, WOW so good and filling and economical to boot.  Thanks for sharing I will be making these again and again.

This was really really good.  It was packed with flavor.  I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and I used pepper jack cheese and seasoned my chicken with cayenne, salt, pepper and garlic powder.

This recipe is fantastic!!  Best quesadillas we've ever had.  Easy to make, tasty.  I made them Saturday for the first time for a group of 4 and everyone loved them.  All I did different was to add chopped garlic to the pico and used both monterrey jack and cheddar cheese.  These were great reheated the next night as well.  Served with sour cream, homemade guacamole, mexican rice from this site and banana margaritas later in the evening...a perfect Mexican Fiesta!  Also served the pico with chips and that is great too.  Thank you for sharing.

This pico was delicious, but the overall quesadilla came out lacking. I think they need more cheese, both for taste and to hold the quesadilla together. My kids had a really hard time eating these b/c they fell apart.

Every loved it and over ate. I had a spatula/turner that had an extra wide head so that enabled me to flip the tortilla with relative ease (still needed some practice tho). This one will be a regular at my table.

The flavors are wonderful!  The making of the quesdilla I found was a little difficult.  I ended up making the second batch like an omlet; flipping one side an half.  It worked a little easier for me.

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME I FOLLOWED TONY'S DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER. BIG DIFFERENCE!!! I AM STILL NOT A HUGE FAN OF THE PICO THO. MINE TASTED BITTER, BUT I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE I USED TOO MUCH LIME. :( NEXT TIME I'LL BE SURE TO USE SMALL LIMES (MINE WERE PRETTY LARGE) JUST TO BE SAFE. A COUPLE TABLESPOONS OF SUGAR SEEMED TO DO THE TRICK. I GUESS I'M STILL A SUCKER FOR MY LOCAL HISPANIC MARKET'S FRESH SALSA. :) MY ONLY OTHER OBSERVATION IS THAT THE COOKING METHOD JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR ME. I'VE ALWAYS HAD LUCK BAKING MY QUESADILLAS (I DO NOT OWN A QUESADILLA MAKER), SO I WILL DO THAT NEXT TIME. I FOUND IT VERY CUMBERSOME TO FLIP MY QUESADILLAS (AND MESSY TO BOOT), BUT OTHERWISE REALLY ENJOYED THESE. THANKS AGAIN TONY! I made this a while ago, but saved my notes so that I could write a review later. I liked this, but thought the pico de gallo was lacking in flavor (but very fresh!). The quesadillas were difficult to flip and my filling kept oozing out (oops!). Perhaps there is an easier way to flip them??? Other than subbing Louis Rich brand chicken strips for cubed chicken breasts and using the pico de gallo mixture as garnish ONLY, I made no significant changes. If I make this again, I'll definitely perk up the pico (or purchase a store bought one) and add it to the quesadillas as directed. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Tony! :-)

I use Jalepeno peppers for the pico de gallo, it makes it have more bite.  My husband would prefer habenero, but my kids wouldn't eat it then.  I have altered the chicken for fish, as well as hamburger.  Mahi Mahi works the best for fish quesadillas.  Everytime I make this the kids think  my quesadillas are better then restaurant quesadillas.

I make only the pico de gallo from this recipe, although I'm sure the quesadillas would be tasty too.  The pico de gallo is great, nice and zippy without being too spicy and overbearing.  It's very fresh-tasting.

I followed this recipe exactly, with one exception: I used Mexican blend shredded cheese. It was delicious! I love the pico de gallo sauce. The sour cream and pico de gallo sauce topping completely made the dish. Thanks for the great recipe! I will be making this again

this recipe was AWESOME! I did change 1 thing tho, I used a bag of mexican cheese blend instead of the jack. And to cut down some time I bought packaged cooked smoked chicken, which was probably a good idea, considering in some of the reviews people complained that the chicken was too plain. We served ours with warm refried beans on the side, but they would taste great with spanish rice as well. VERY filling. 5 stars all the way!

I made these w/o having the recipe in front of me. As it turned out I used red pepper & a monteray jack cheese spread. For a "senior" moment, I guess that wasn't bad. I will use regular monteray jack cheese next time though.

The best quesadillas I've ever had/made hands down. My friends and I got together to make these for a class party and they were a hit. We added more lime to the chicken though but they were perfect!

I buy the pico de gallo from a really good local Mexican restaurant and fallow the rest of the recipe exactly. This is a HUGE hit everywhere I take it and we have people ask us to make it when we are bringing food to functions.

I never review recipes...but I just had to rate this one as 10 stars. I made this for Valentine's Dinner, as we usually go out to eat and order Quesadillas. However, I gave it a try. My husband loved this so much, he called his mother to tell her all about it. It was PERFECT! I used Pepper Jack cheese for more a kick and I suspect that this will now be a delicious addition to our regular dinners. I have never heard my husband talk about any food he has ever eaten. Thanks!

I made these without chicken and apparently it was SO good - I didn't even get to taste any myself!  (Which is why I can't give it 5 stars). I did, however, have leftover pico de Gallo - it even tasted good 2 days later!

i absolutely HATED this. Especially because it took forever to chop all the ingredients.  the pico de gallo tastes like , so much so that it barely has the taste of tomato.  when you have onion, a ton of lime juice, jalapenos, and cilantro in something it's just going to tast like a sour, bitter mess.  also, i cooked this as the recipe suggested, and couldn't flip it or even lift it out of the pan without everything falling out.  i've never made quesadillas before, so i don't know the standard way to cook them, but we should probably cut them into quarters BEFORE hand, and stack them on top of each other while they cook.  also, the chicken was bland.  the cheese, and pico de gallo did nothing to help this.

Terrific quesadillas!  I cooked the onion for the pico de gallo because I don't like raw onions.  The fresh cilantro made the difference.

This was a very good recipe!  Here's what I do to prevent a mess when "flipping" the quesadilla:  I pile all my ingredients and cheeses on the tortilla that has been placed in the pan. Go ahead and place the second tortilla on top. Allow the cheeses to melt within the filling and the top tortilla will adhere when you flip it over.  This is just how I do it.  Of course, if the cheese hasn't melted enough for the other tortilla to stick, you'll have a mess.

Fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly for the pico de gallo and it was delicious!!  As far as the chicken is concerned, I just boiled mine in a little water and then shredded it.  I don't care for bell peppers, so I skipped the step where you saute the onion and peppers.  I used 4 frozen chicken breast halves and when they were cooked, shredded them and added them to all the pico.  I ended up making 4 quesadillas that way.  Of course, I didn't have any pico left to dip in, but they were so delicious, you didn't need to do any thing except eat them! Everyone in my family loved these and my husband said they are the best he's ever had anywhere! These will be a regular in our family!

I consider myself to be a "novice" cook so I was a little concerned about this recipe being too complicated. It wasn't! I followed the recipe exactly, step by step, and it was delicious...and easy! My husband LOVED it and requested to make it a "weekly" meal. Even my 3 yr. old ate it up and she's a picky eater! Thanks for this recipe!

i am from Tx and lol sorry but i didn't know there was people didn't know how to make Pico, (My favorite condiment)
for a spicier version use serrano peppers. for crispier tortilla LIGHTLY butter each side ahead of time is good but not needed. toast one side as if making grilled cheese set aside,toast one side of the next flip it then start putting it together as recipe says topping off with the tortilla grilled one side with the ungrilled side facing up the rest is culinary delight

Gosh, hate to be a downer, but this recipe just didn't cut it for me!  The Pico de Gallo is the most bland salsa ever!  Not sure what all the fuss is about? So far as the quesdaillas...not much to write home about either.

I've been wanting to try this recipe for years. This was fantastic, used fresh tomatoes from the garden and used canned jalapenos (added more) and added some of thejuice. The pico de gallo is one of best things I have ever tasted and it was nice in the Quesadillas and as a topping. Used the smaller tortillas and made a whole bunch. Since there were only 2 of us there were leftovers and was excited to have the leftovers for my lunch (somone even asked what I was eating) I will be making another batch of the pico de gallo tonight to have with tortilla chips.

One of the best meals I have made in a while - and it wasn't very difficult either!  This dish rivals anything you will get in a restaruant.  I prepared only about half the salsa but, that's because I'm not a big fan of chunky salsa.

My family loves them  - we usually have them at least once a week.  We think they are better than at a restaurant!  I cut down on the limes and only used one as others suggested.  I also make them on my griddle so I can make several at one time.

This was FABULOUS! I followed the recipe very closely- the only difference was that I added salsa seasonings from San Antonio into my salsa, though I'm sure it would have been fine on its own. This meal was very easy to make. My husband and I just loved it. We'll make this again and again.
Watch the tortillas carefully. I thought I had some time, so started doing some dishes and ended up burning one side of a quesadilla- oops!

This is a very popular recipe in my house - I make just as the recipe indicates, the only change has been to use red pepper for the green, and use 1/2 of the jalepeno pepper. I've used mozzarella cheese for the monterary jack - both are tasty. Thanks for the recipe Tony - no sense looking for another quesadilla recipe, this is a find!

I actually just used this recipe to make a pico de gallo salsa for fajitas- and it was excellent! It was fresh and flavorful, and incredibly easy. I also recommend trying the pico de gallo from this recipe over the Sweet Corn Cake (recipe on this site)

This was a very tasty meal. I made this for my family and they loved it.
Next time I will cut down on the amount of lime juice just to be sure the tortillas don't get soggy.

This recipe is a keeper! I was afraid of the jalepeno so I only used one half pepper, but I couldn't even taste it so I will use the full pepper next time.

These were amazing!  I had to make them twice in the same week!  Both times I wished I had a little more of the pico left over for garnish, so next time I will probably double that part.

This dish was good, I used a half green, orange and red pepper, monteray jalapeno cheese along with Mexican Cheese.  I also used 4 garlic cloves.  Next time I think I will also add crumbled bacon.

Awesome!  Very complex flavor.  My tortillas ended up getting a bit soggy, but that's my fault for not draining the mix right.  Good stuff.  Lot of prep work, but I'll make it again.

Oh my goodness this is good!  It tasted like something from a restaurant, although it wasn't as pretty!  They really are hard to flip!  We only used 1 lime in the pico but other than that we made as directed and they turned out fantastic!

So good! This yummy recipe is in regular rotation at my house. I usually follow the recipe to a t but if I'm strapped for time, I buy a high quality fresh salsa and jarred minced garlic, then I only have to chop the onion and green pepper. This pico recipe is he BEST but it tastes much better if you let it sit for 2-3 hrs at least first.

Got great reviews from the SO.  I also made a more bland version for the kids (by basically eliminating the cilantro and lime) and everyone was happy.

This is a great recipe. I used the marinade from the Lime Chicken Tacos from this site to marinade the chicken. I sauteed the chicken in the marinade. I added some Fajita Seasoning to the pan. After the chicken was all cooked, I took it out of the pan and added the Green Peppers, Onions and garlic to the pan and sauteed till it still had a slight crisp taste and added some fresh lime juice. Then I combined it all and added 1/2 of the pico mix. YUMMY!!!!!!

I really only want to give this three stars but the pico de gallo was very good and my husband loved the entire recipe.  The quesadillas were nothing special to me but the pico de gallo was yummy w/ tortilla chips.  I won't make this again.  If I'm sauteing peppers & onions I'd rather just make fajitas.

This is an excellent recipe. I made some with chicken and some without and both were very tasty. Any leftover pico de gallo is good for eating with tortilla chips and sour cream. I will make these again.

One of my favorite meals.  The only differnce is that I use red onion, and add lime juice to my pico. I have also added other things to the pico from time to time, such as fresh diced pineaple. Mango also works!

These quesadillas are perfect! The only change I made is to add a bit of oregano to the mixture.

Fantastic recipe.  I left out the green pepper, used co-jack cheese and doubled the recipe.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, which I rarely do.  It was perfect.  I will be using this pico de gallo from now on.  TFS.

I suggest you make the pico de gallo the day before.  The longer the  flavors have to infuse the better.  My favorite recipe by far!

Great recipe! I recommend seeding the tomatoes first so that the pico de gallo doesn't become too watery. I added southwest seasoning to the chicken so that they would have more flavour. I folded the tortillas in half & grilled them on the bbq...adding a whole other element to this tasty recipe.  Definitely make this one!

The pico de gallo is excellent, although I couldn't find cilantro at the store (and I went to 2 different grocery stores).  So that was the only thing I had to leave out.  I also seasoned the chicken after reading some of the posts, I seasoned it with emeril's essence.  I made this recipe with 4 smaller tortillas, and used a monterey jack/cheddar cheese mix, and added a garlic clove.  Will make these again this week, this time I have cilantro and will add more jalapeno.  Thanks!

Great recipe and really quite low in fat content .The pico (salsa) really gives it a fresh, delicious taste!!! I used the plate method to turn and it worked like a charm.

I love this, they taste great.  In terms of them being messy, what I do is I use smaller tortilla's that are easier to flip and just make more of them

This is THE BEST recipe EVER on allrecipes.  I am hooked.  There is no better quesadilla recipe IMO.  The ONLY thing I change is I melt a little bit of butter in my hot pan.  I like my tortilla to be buttery tasting.  It still comes out nice and crisp.  For those who say it's messy... if you flip it fast... it comes out fine.  Don't try to be "perfect" with it.  Slide your turner under it and flip it over really fast.  But if you let the quesadilla cook long enough (nice and crispy) the cheese will be melted to the ingredients inside and it makes it easier to flip.  Anyway, try it.. it's great - you'll be glad you did!  I wanted to add:  A pizza cutter makes cutting these simple.

Fast, healthy, flavorful.  I used the smaller flour tortillas and was able to turn them over easily.  Also, the smaller size seemed to be a perfect portion for one person.  The recipe served four this way.  Used precooked chicken and added it to the onion/pepper mixture at the end just enough to heat.

Good.  Needs salt & spices (or Adobo seasoning) added to the chicken, and I'd use less lime in the pico de gallo.  Serve with guacomole on the side.

Excellent....the pico de gallo tastes so fresh...cilantro is key here. I used perdue cut-ups and also added sliced red peppers with the green peppers and onions. Topped with sour cream and more pico de gallo (I made a double batch) and sprinkled some ancho chile powder on top. Delicious!!

Why did I wait so long to make this recipe???!!  FABULOUS!  I agree with a previous reviewer -- vegetable size would have been helpful.  I ended up chopping half a vidalia onion, then adding enough tomato to make it look good to me (but the onion is our favorite part of pico).  I don't know how you could stuff all that filling into one quesadilla -- we ended up splitting a ten-inch one, then making our own 6 inch ones.  The pico was delicious.

Amazing recipe. I loved it, and so did everyone else.  I'd recommend doubling up on the ingredients to make the pico de gallo, and making sure you add just enough jalapeno so it's not TOO spicy...

This was a great quesadilla.  I will make it again.  A tip for all the people that complain about how long it takes to chop everything- get a mini food chopper.  It really helps out with prep time.  I followed the recipe pretty close but I used thighs instead of breasts and my husband and I both enjoyed our quesadillas.

I made these last night. They were excellent! I doubled the recipe. To save time, I used pre-cooked boneless chicken breasts in BBQ sauce(frozen). From frozen to fabulous in three and a half minutes in the microwave. I did grate extra cheese, as we all likes lots. I will deifintely be making htese again.

This is fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 2 8-inch tortillas, instead of the 1 12-inch one.  It was so delicious.  I will make this time and time again.

These are super good.  I used precooked frozen chicken strips to save time and reheated them in the microwave.  I also served with guacamole.  yummy

Wonderful way to use up leftover grilled chicken.  Made a little guacamole too.  Delicious Mother's Day lunch.  Will make often this summer.

These are the most FANTASTIC AND AUTHENTIC quesadillas I've had in a very long time. So delicious my husband couldn't stop talking about them.  These will definitely be part of our regular menu.  Served with guacamole by Bob Cody from this website.  Unbelievable and surprisingly filling!  Great job, Tony!

These were ok.  A lot of prep time with chopping and all.  A little too much onion.  I also shredded the chicken in my Cuisinarte instead of chicken strips.

The pico de gallo was wonderful, I didn't have a jalepeno so I used a hot green pepper instead.  I saved a bunch of time by using pre-cooked southwest style chicken and skipped the green pepper/onion sautee.  Per another reviewer, I baked mine at 350 for about 10 minutes.  I served the remaining pico de gallo with nacho chips.  My family loved these!  Thanks!

These were very tastey!!!!  I could've saved some prep time by buying chicken tender strips instead of slicing the chicken breast.  But it was good and I will use the recipe again...even if just for the pico sauce for use in another dish.

The pico de gallo was excellent and everyone really enjoyed it.  However, the quesadillas were nothing special. They weren't bad but they just didn't go above average in my book.  I will however use the pico de gallo recipe quite a bit with other recipes.

Wow!  The Pico de Gallo sauce is amazing.  After putting it together and letting it sit (the longer it sits the better it gets) I kept having to add more b/c my husband kept walking by and eating spoonfuls!  Great meal and easy to make.

I had a garden full of ripe tomatoes and needed a recipe to help me use them. The Pico de Gallo in this recipe did just that. I will definitely make this recipe again as it was delicious. Even my husband loved it and he's a pickey eater!

These are very good, but I think they almost have too much stuff in them. More cheese and less veggies make it better.

I loved this recipe.  I've tried making quesadillas before, but they always seemed to be missing something.  This one finally got it right.  Very filling though!  One quesadilla was enough for two people.

The pico de gallo was very good but didn't think the rest of the dish was worth all the trouble.  I'll use the pico de gallo to go with chicken fajitas.

Very good.  I made two types of quesadillas for the SuperBowl--both recipes from All recipes.  This was the winner.  More flavor and pretty easy to make.  I didn't alter the recipe at all.

I must admit, I skipped the quesadilla portion of this and just made the pico de gallo to accompany fajitas I was making. But the pico de gallo is great! Tastes just like a restaurant! My boyfriend loves it, and it's so easy I will probably make it a lot more often!

I tryed this recipe and thought it was tasty and authentic.  My family enjoyed it and I loved it.  However, since the tortillas are high in sodium and carbs, I used one tortilla and just folded it in half.  It also made it easier to turn over.  Overall, it was a great and fun recipe.  Thanks

This is AWESOME!! I cooked this a month ago and my husband keeps asking when I'm going to cook it again. My kids, 5 & 7, loved this. I tripled the amounts in the recipe, thinking there wouldn't be enough but there was alot left that we all enjoyed the next day for lunch. This is already in my own cookbook. Thanks Tony!

These quesadillas are delicious: a house favorite!  It takes a while to chop all the ingredients for the Pico de Gallo, but it's so worth it!  The first one was pretty dry, though, so I actually added quite some cheese...  But my guests asked for the recipe right away!

These are great!  We've made them twice and they are by far the best we've ever had.  No restaurant can compare.  We added sliced mushrooms to this recipe to suit our tastes.  Takes a bit of time to prep the fresh vege's, but well worth it!  Try it, you'll love them!

Oh my God...these were fabulous.  I served these at a recent gathering and my friends were actually fighting over them.  They are the BEST!

We loved this recipe...I made it for me and my husband so I added 2 more tortillas and another piece of chicken and it worked out perfect.. The flipping takes practice but you will get the hang of it after the first one..I didnt have any fresh jalapenos so I just cut up about 10 slices of jalapeno from the jar and also used minced garlic instead...Very very good..I have added this to my Cinco de Mayo menu...Kiki (Brampton,Ontario,Canada)

I used pre packaged pico de gallo found in the produce section of the store.  I'm in Texas, so
that kind of stuff is very common in stores.  I chopped up the chicken instead of serving it sliced
 and increased the amount of cheese. I also made it on smaller tortillas and made 4 quesadillas.
This will become a regular in my house!

This was a delicious recipe, and the Pico de Gallo was perfect - very fresh, flavorful, and vibrant.  I followed other folks' suggestions and used smaller tortillas, and I *still* had a hard time flipping them over without spilling the contents of the quesadillas into the pan and on the stove.  No biggie.  I will definitely make this again.

Edited to add - I like this very much with mushrooms (toss in fresh when you saute the onions and bell pepper).  Also the larger tortillas work very well if you spread the filling on half of the tortilla, fold it, and then flip (folded side down during turning).

My entire family, husband and 3 teenagers went crazy over this dish.  Really wonderful flavors and very authentic tasting.  It took a little more time, but the effort was worth it!  I even made the pico de gallo ~ try it out!

Excellent recipie!  We felt like we were at our favorite Mexican restaurant!  We may use smaller soft tortillas next time.  We weren't so skilled at flipping the 12 unch tortilla!

What an amazing dish!  I didn't hink I could pull it off, but if I could, anyone can.  Totally delicious, absolutely mouth watering! I cheated and bought the pico de gallo from a local farmer's market, but it was yummy, yummy, yummy!

I'm not a great cook, but my family raved about this dinner.  Very nice chicken flavor, easy to make and fun to cook.  It will definitely become a standard in my home.

We loved this recipe. We were a little concerned with the serving size being too small. We make plain cheese quesadillas all the time and they're not that filling. But one of these was definitely enough for two people when served with a side dish. They were delicious. The only disappointment was that I was too full to eat more.

These were excellent!  We all loved these!  I have never made quesadillas before and these were so quick and easy.  I used a rotisserie chicken already cooked and just removed the breast halves and cut into strips, which made it even easier.  My husband loved the pico de gallo with tortilla chips.  He said it tasted like the sauce used in our favorite mexican restaurant.  I can't wait to make these again!  Thank you.

I work for a police department and used this recipe for a cinco de mayo dinner and everyone loved it. Even raved about it the next day reheated!!! Very easy also.
