Absolutely fantastic!  I did a few things differently though.  One, in order to make it spicy I minced two green Serrano peppers and added it in with the other herbs.  This is pretty spicy so if you want some spice but not a lot, I'd only put in one.  Second, I accidentally grabbed fresh cilantro at the store instead of basil.  I added half of the bushel and it was fabulous.  Lastly, when I cut off the tops of the bell peppers, I trimmed them up and and diced up the excess and added that in with the veggies also.  I don't usually try new recipes unless they've had a lot of high ratings but the combination on herbs, spices and meat sounded so wonderful and I was NOT disappointed.  You will love this recipe.

Excellent! When stuffing peppers, I cut the green stem just even with the pepper, then cut off the bottom of the pepper for the opening - they stand up better when baking. Of course, they still must be cleaned out. I used red,yellow and orange peppers for stuffing and the taste was just wonderful. Next time, I'll use green peppers as I believe it will taste just as good, and be a prettier presentation. Thanks!

Wow! Truly amazing! I used red bell peppers and different cheeses and it came out looking, smelling and tasting wonderful. I didn't see what the tomato sauce poured over it would do other than spread out in a thin layer at the bottom of the baking dish, so I gave that a miss. Also, accidentaly cooked the rice seperately before adding it to the sauce (also used a bit more than called for) but it worked fine. I would definitely not cut down on the amount of cheese added to the mixture as it gives it a great texture, and of course flavour. You can play around with this dish using different kinds of cheese. Will definitely make it again. It's so good I actually want to make this for company!

These were ok but, as written, I thought the filling was very thin and pretty bland. I added more seasoning - cayenne pepper, garlic powder, lots and lots of freshly ground pepper - which improved the flavor, but I wish I had used ground beef along with the chorizo for more flavor, and to improve the texture. Some tomato paste wouldn't have hurt either.

I can't give this 5 because I didn't stick to it fully.  However, it was an excellent starting point.  

Beware when buying chorizo... if you don't have access to a mexican buthcher shop that makes it's own, buy the best quality stick chorizo you can find. Make sure it looks more like sausage and less like ground to a pulp...something! Those ground tubes cook up to highly salted mush and are over 1/2 grease!

I had already make a gulf coast style rice so I mixed that in with the cooked chorizo, carrots and tomato. Since my rice was already seasoned with garlic & onion, I didn't add more.

Mixed in a heaping handful of Chuhuahua cheese instead of the mix suggested.

Very delicious! Thanks!

These were very good. My husband and kids loved them...I made them with homemade chorizo which I highly reccomend I use Anne's homemade chorizo from this site its simple and quick to make. Instead of mixing the cheese in with the filling I spooned some filling into the pepper put in a layer of cheese spooned in more filling and topped with cheese that way it had a nice cheesy center. The only thing I will do differently next time is cook the rice first and stir it in when the meat mixture is done....Thank you for such a great recipe!

I modified this recipe quite a bit; I used ground beef instead of the chorizo and made a batch of mexican rice instead of plain rice and added it to the mixture using the rest of the ingredients in recipe and it turned out GREAT! Even had leftover filling that I made chili rellanos with the next night.

Really good.  The grocery store was running short on green bell peppers.  Red peppers work well too.

Instead of the uncooked rice, I used some leftover rice and adjusted the liquids used. This recipe wasn't spicy enough for me.  Although I only used cheddar cheese (didn't have the others), I would probably use pepper jack to kick it up.

I thought this was ok. I thought the stuffing was somewhat bland. Next time I will follow the advice of another reviewer and use Chihuahua cheese and Mexican style rice. Also I really think this needed more rice. At least twice as much in my opinion. Maybe add some cumin as well. Not sure what the tomato soup poured over the top was supposed to do, I didnt think it added anything to the recipe. I will omit next time. I did like the pepper and chorizo combo flavor and I do think this recipe is worth making again, just with some modifications. Thanks for the recipe.

From reading the reviews, it sounds like the quality of chorizo you use really makes all the difference.  My end result was not bland at all, but really spicey.  I do agree with some of the others about the tomato soup.  I didn't really think it was necessary.  Overall it was pretty good.

I'm rating this three because there is one key problem with the recipe.  This calls for uncooked rice.  Now, either it needs to be instant rice, or it needs to be cooked, because we made this and the rice was no where near cooked.  It was hard and crunchy.  I've made stuffed peppers before, but thought I'd give this one a try and follow as instructed, but I'd make changes to it if I make it again.

These turned out really good.  Modified quite a bit due DH's diabetes and ingredients on hand.  Didn't do rice. Browned chorizo with finely diced onions.  Added diced tomatoes(drained), garlic, black beans(drained) and chopped spinach(thawed,drained).I didn't drain my chorizo, I just simmered everything together until most of the liquid had dried up. I did as some others and just cut my peppers in half without boiling them. I baked the filled peppers for about 45 minutes until the peppers themselves were fork tender (covered).  My mexican cheese had gone bad so I put a slice of fresh mozzarella on top of each and then broiled it until the cheese had melted.  Next time I will definitly use the mexican cheese and get it just a little brown under the broiler. The peppers themselves produced a fair amount of liquid in the bottom of the pan but using a slotted spoon solved that and the little bit of liquid in the filling was absorbed. Taking out the rice and using the black beans turned it into a nice lower (better) carb meal for the hubby that was so flavorful they were gone before we knew it.

We LOVE this recipe!  Of course I always put my own "twist" on things.  I cut the peppers in half, clean them out and then can skip the boiling.   I like to add finely chopped habeneros to the mixture.  I also add brown rice instead of white for the health factor but keep in mind that you have to cook the mixture much longer because brown rice takes longer to cook.   I have also used zucchini in place of the carrots. I stuff the raw half peppers and they soften in the 30 minutes in the oven.  Delicious!  These are the only way I make stuffed bell peppers for the last couple of years!

I'll definitely be making these again.  Only changes I made was to use fresh tomato & since I didn't have celery I used a can of corn. since I don't like to waste I chopped up the bell pepper from the tops. I also used "soy" chorizo so no grease and made such a healthy meal.  Thank you "Malapso" for sharing your recipe.

my family loved this recipe, thanks :)  only thing i will change next time to simplify it a little is to use "mexican blend" shredded cheese instead of 3 different kinds of cheese.  This dish takes a little time to prepair, but is absolutely worth it!!

Modified to what I had on hand. Used 12oz chorizo, omitted carrot, 1 can chopped tomato, cilantro in lue of the basil/parsley, cooked a batch of Spanish rice and added, layered cheddar cheese in the middle of the stuffing and topped with the peppers. Omitted the tomato soup and they turned out moist and delicious.

Made this with Italian sausage vs. chorizo.  Also, I had a box of leftover fried rice from Chinese takeout, used that rather than cooking rice as the recipe calls for... just reduce the amount of water.  I had leftover stuffing since I only stuffed 4 peppers, so I mixed the remaining tomato soup into the mixture and saved it for later... next day scrambled some eggs, stirred in the stuffing mixture, and made what my husband said were the best breakfast burritos ever.  Will definitely make this again and make lots of it!  Even the leftovers were delicious and versatile.

A little bit time consuming (especially if you have little kids pulling at you while in the kitchen) but well worth the extra work!  This is delicious!   The combination of cheeses and chorizo are great.  My husband loved this dish, way more than a traditional ground beef stuffed pepper that I had made before.  Will make it again, without any changes!

Very good, and very flavorful! I used dried basil and also added some fresh cilantro. I also used Brick cheese instead of the mixture of cheeses. Yummy!

Why didn't I think of substituting chorizo sooner? Excellent recipe! Remember if the peppers don't want to stand up on your baking tray or dish slice a little off the bottom to make them even!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! Sometimes I add a little corn too if I have some leftover!

I will definitely be making this one over and over again.  I used mainly hot wax peppers for this recipe.  I also substituted my own homemade sauce from fresh Roma tomatoes as opposed to the tomato soup.

roasted the peppers in oven instead of boiling, which shortened the necessary bake time. also used precooked chorizo, so i added a little oil to pan to begin.

I've made this recipe with several modifications and it turns out great every time. I use carrots, celery, green onion, mushrooms, zucchini, corn for veggies and ground beef instead of chorizo. Also I use one can of Rotel and Mexican rice. Omitting the herbs and just use Worcester sauce, red paper flakes and a bit of cayenne.  I also stuff tomatoes and onions not just peppers. Very tasty!

These were tasty!  Made as written, but had trouble adding the soup to the filled pepper, my meat/rice mixture was very dense.  Loved the flavorful chorizo, so yummy!  I didn't think the cheese added to the meat/rice mixture added much flavor, except more calories.  Next time I make these I think I'll omit the soup and just top with cheese.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with AR, we enjoyed these.

Once you add the cheese it binds together well and is good.  Thought maybe more rice up until that point.  Spicy and good.

I loved these~! I left out the salt and the cheeses, but substituted shredded pepper jack cheese instead, used Minute instant rice because that's what I had on hand, and the parsley and basil were dried. Oh, and I used tomato sauce instead of the peeled tomatoes.

A new staple!  My husband is vegetarian so we made this with Litelife soy-based chorizo, threw in some green chiles and left out the worcestershire sauce and it was AMAZING!

This was VERY good.  All I changed was: the cheese (I used a Mexican blend instead of buying multiple bags of cheese) and didn't use carrots.  I also added some seasonal to the mixture because another review said the filling was bland.  But My husband and our friend devoured them!  I will definitely make this again soon.

Loved it. Changed it a lot but the basic structure was vital. I had cooked rice already so I doubled the dry amount and left out the extra water. No tomato soup in the house so i reserved some of the Mexican style tomatoes for the top. I was lucky to have fresh chorizo from the Michoacana butcher, which is much chunkier and less fatty than the tube kind. I used all cheddar, too. The recipe still held up. I will make it again and again.

My grocery store did not have chorizo so I substituted with Cajun style andouille sausage and hamburger. I used big fat yellow, red and green peppers fresh from farmers market. They were beautiful and tasted oh so good.

We love this recipe and make variations of it all the time. In its truest form we do everything but use carrot or celery. I also swap quinoa for rice. Otherwise we do it as written and it's very good. 

That said, it's so easy to manipulate to whatever we're in the mood for.

2nd time making this. The only thing I do different is if I don’t have fresh parsley or basil I use dried organic spices and I do not add salt or pepper to taste. The chorizo I make has enough flavor. I also do not blanch the peppers in water.

These turned out great! I used homemade chorizo for the meat. The rice needed more water and cooking time. I also used 1 3/4 cups fresh tomatoes puréed. Lastly, I cut the peppers in half and skipped the boiling step. I also left out the tomato soup. I only had enough meat for 4 peppers total. I didn't cover these and they still turned out great.

I probably shouldn't review this because I used only the idea, not the actual recipe. I've been making stuffed peppers for 42 years and, like my mother, used ground beef. I was intrigued by the use of sausage and although I have always topped with cheese, I've never incorporated it into the filling. Here's what I changed: I used Italian sausage; I used mozzarella, sharp cheddar and asiago cheese; I used fresh basil, parsley, oregano and hot pepper flakes. I did not use Worcestershire sauce; I did include the chopped pepper tops with the veggies. I used brown rice (which I pre cooked with water and some of the juice from the tomatoes) and garden fresh tomatoes. This was hands down the BEST stuffed peppers I've ever made! Thanks for the great idea.

One of my favorites! I have a rice cooker so I make the rice at the same time the peppers are boiling/meat is cooking/oven preheating/chopping ingredients and then I put everything together and put them in the oven for about 20 Minutes with a cheese and bread crumb mixture on top to crisp them up. SO good and only takes about an hour tops from start to finish.

My family really enjoyed this, even my kids. I tweaked the recipe based on what I had on hand - used a can of diced tomatoes, used Monterey Jack and mozzarella cheeses, left out the tomato soup. I also cooked the rice separately since I wasn't adding the soup. It was really tasty and easy to put together. I'll be putting this into regular dinner rotation.

The number of ingredients made it an expensive recipe. however, I made this as written and the non-vegetable eater, in the house gobbled them up, asking for seconds and didn't know the veggies were there until we told him afterwards. It was super yummy.

I did it according to the recipe but next time i would not add the tomato soup I would rather make my own gravy and i would precook the rice as it was still hard after the specified 15 minutes other than that it was pretty tasty. :-)

This dish was super delicious! The whole family loved it! The only thing I altered was I cooked it as directed for 25 minutes, then added a little more mozzarella on the tops and put it under the broiler for the final five minutes.

Made recipe as called for and it had plenty of spice from the chorizo.  Next time I will double the rice because it was too thin for me.  I agree with other reviewers that it didn't need the tomato soup on top.

We liked it, but after tasting, we decided next time, it needs more spice.  We used red bell peppers so we didn't have indigestion...

These turned out absolutely fantastic!!  I used 1 lb. ground turkey, 8 oz. chorizo - while these were browning, I added a chopped onion, a chopped serrano pepper, chopped carrot, a can of rotel tomatoes, 2 cups water and a pkg. of zatarain's rice - cooked for 45 minutes (drained). let cool for a few minutes and added a gob of mexican blended shredded cheese.  stuffed softened green peppers and topped with remaining cheese - baked until browned.  FANTASTIC!!!!

Delicous!!! Love Chorizo Sausage.  I made one substitution, due to not having a can of whole peeled tomatoes by error.  I substituted with 1/2 spaghetti sauce and 1/2 Classico Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto to equal amount requested.  Great substitution, Great Flavor.

We loved it, thank you, but had to make quite a few revisions due to what we had on hand. I had brown rice which takes about 45 minutes to cook. Instead of sauteeing anything with the chorizo I just threw it all in the rice water. I had no celery or basil or diced tomatoes so I used a can of Rotel tomatoes to kick it up a notch. I also had no jack so I used pepper jack. The chorizo was  a homemade, very flavorful and little grease. I topped with Ragu sauce instead of tomato soup. My husband has been a cook for 35 years and when I asked him if there was anything that he would change he said no. It was good just the way it was. So thank you very much. It was a winner.

I really liked this recipe! I was looking for a way to spice up my stuffed peppers. I used Zataran's dirty rice as a base, and followed the rest of the directions (so I ended up with a LOT of the rice/chorizo mixture left over). The only thing I did differently was remove the foil for the last 5 minutes in the oven to get the cheese a little bit browned. Yum!

recipe sounds very good. I bought chorizo yesterday and was looking for a good recipe. The only thing I would change is the canned tomato soup (high in sodium). Instead, I would use a nice low-sodium tomato sauce. Thanks :)

Very good! I made it vegan (soyrizo and vegan cheese) and used poblanos instead of bell peppers. My only issue was the rice took about double the water and cook time. Will make again.

I made this for a pot luck and got rave reviews. Really good flavor. To make them go farther I cut them in half (top to bottom) and made little "boats". Followed the recipe exactly and will again. Great just as it is. Oh, also used green, red and yellow peppers. Very pretty.

The flavor was great, and my kids even ate it! I would next time not put rice in it, but a Mexican rice on the side. My rice didn’t cook all the way. It did take longer than anticipated, but again, I do have a baby and a toddler.

Used this recipe as a basis.  The meat I used was a Hatfield Hot Italian Sausage without the casings. Used celery flakes, not carrots, but did use crushed garlic, Hunts whole peeled tomatoes, two cans of Hunts tomato sauce. The hot sausage added only a mild flavor that was good.  Six large peppers was used.

I think I bought the wrong chorizo...it was in a tube and was like a meal.... didn't resemble sausage and never browned. I used brown rice with an extra 3/4 of a cup of water which took forever to cook! If I make these again I would def use different chorizo and use minuet brown rice.  I did like the peppers,might try again

We followed most of the directions. Like most cooks, I can't resist making my own tweaks.  Finding Chorizo is not always easy so I used mild sausage in a tube,  and added some ground turkey.  The only change I will try next time will be hot instead of mild and cut it with the turkey to tone it down.  Also used riced cauliflower instead of rice.  Worked great and healthier.  I made my filling, except for the cauliflower, at lunch and put the skillet in the fridge.   That evening  I put it back on stove an heated it up and par-boiled the pepper halves.  Then added the frozen caulif.. 
and simmered for 15 minutes.  Stuffed and cooked.  Great.
Eating the leftovers tonight as it did about 12 halves. ( I did halves so the bell pepper did not overwhelm the dish.)  Also you can buy shredded cheese mixes with three or four cheeses, i.e. Mexican Blend,  in the bag.  Cheaper and faster than buying several bags to get your mix.

I cut this recipe by one third because I wanted to make only 4 peppers and do them in my air fryer. Followed recipe fairly closely but did make a couple exceptions. I was a little leery about using plain tomato soup as a topping, so I added a teaspoon of basil and about a half teaspoon of black pepper to it. I also am a cheese lover so doubled the cheese. Used the same amount in the chorizo mixture, but spread another cup on top. Turned out delicious. Will defiantly make this one again.

Absolutely great simple to make. Make more ore less spicy. We love this recipe. I would use smaller peppers next time or slice larger peppers in half before stuffing. Will use this agai for sure

We loved it, using half of the chorizo since that’s all we had. It was delicious. Left overs the next day were great too.

Better than the old standard my mother use to make.  I like the little kick it has, I may try to increase the kick a little.

I used soy Chorizo sausage from Trader Joe's, which added all the spice I needed for this dish. I also used vegan cheese, instead of dairy cheese to make this a vegan dish. The main cheese I used was also from Trader Joe's: cashew fiesta dip, which gives a creamy texture. I added non-dairy mozzeralla on top of each pepper before they went into the oven.

I liked this dish pretty well and would make it again. My wife was looking for a lighter dish at the end of a sweltering summer day and felt it was too heavy.

Loved it.  Added 1 pound of ground pork,  increased rice to 1 cup, and used 1 quart tomatoes and no tomato soup. Nice and thick and yummy.  Plenty of filling for 6 very large peppers with extra eaten as Spanish rice.

This was fantastic for dinner tonight. had some huge peppers in the garden to use, and this recipe did them justice. To make it vegetarian, I used a half package of Morning Star chorizo (added to the rice mixture at the end) and instead of tomato soup, I used a can of red enchilada sauce. So good!

This was a delicious, easy meal to make. I didn’t have fresh parsley & basil so I used dry spices to avoid a trip to the grocery store. I also chopped the tops of the peppers and added to the mixture so as not to waste the edible portion of the peppers. I’ll definitely make these again.

This is delicious.  I made 1/2 a recipe because that's all the chorizo I had.  I have never cooked with chorizo before but this was a free premium at our local Kroger store one Friday.  It's very spicy but we like spicy. I already had rice cooked so I used that and didn't add the extra water.  I had no tomato soup so I used tomato sauce.  I don't think I really needed it.

Very good.  I used Tofurkey chorizo, ground beef style.  It didn’t have any grease and I had to keep it from sticking to the pan.  But all went well once I added the tomatoes, water and other ingredients.

Don't want bland?  Substitute the tomatoes for pico de gallo and the tomato sauce for salsa.  My kids and I loved this small alteration. Very flavorful.

Delish! Modified a few things, cooked with turkey meat, chorizo, carrots, celery, cheese , corn, par cooked long grain rice, red onions, garlic and Italian bread crumbs and topped with one can diced tomatoes and tomato sauce.  Cut the bell pepper in half then stuffed each half, no egg and baked until tender around 40 min and then removed foil and cooked 5 minutes more to toast tops.  Super good! just needed a little more chorizo, but over all it was very tasty!

Amazing. Cut the recipe to make 4 peppers. Roasted them at 350 degrees for 15 minutes before stuffing. Used slightly watered pizza sauce instead of tomato soup and just heated separately and added to plate after cooking. This dish was well-seasoned but I had superb chorizo. Took 1 hour overall. Will make many times again!

This was delicious as I was tasting the filling...then I read some reviews that said it came out bland. I added a jalapeno and some chalula sauce. DON'T DO THAT! Hahaha! Next time I'll make the recipe as directed.

This was really good! The chorizo gave it just the right amount of spice. I followed the recipe pretty closely but used dried basil and parsley instead of fresh and used shredded Mexican cheese blend instead of the three cheeses in the recipe.

The flavor was great (my family doesn't care for super spicy food), but I couldn't get the darn rice to cook as directed. Dinnertime was much later than anticipated. If I do this again, I will definitely precook the rice.

Using tomato soup for the sauce made this recipe a no go for us.  My husband usually loves leftovers for lunch the next day but he was less than enthused about these stuffed peppers.  He said he would probably eat the chorizo mixture but would scrape off the tomato soup.

I loved this! It served as a great recipe to build off of. I read through the other reviews, and chose to use my pepper tops in the mix, dry basil and parsley, chicken broth instead of water, and rotel instead of tomatoes. I also added sliced jalepenos, Mexican mixed cheese with mozzarella, and sprinkled my peppers with garlic pepper before filling them. I will definitely make this again!

I made this for my wife and I and we both really enjoyed it. I did a few things different from the recipe. I used Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo, diced tomatoes (drained) instead of whole tomatoes diced and long grain basmati rice. I also used a Pyrex square baking dish instead of a baking sheet. The prep time was about 40 minutes and very easy.  I served it with nonfat refried beans cooked with sauteed serrano peppers. I  keep a bag of  Herdez serrano peppers in the freezer to quickly add a little spice to any meal. The only thing I would consider spicing up is the tomato soup. It was a little bland. I hope you enjoy this simple recipe as much as we did.

A little spicy but excellent flavor. We are going to make it again. Used large peppers and it made five of them.

Great recipe to get me started with what we had on hand.  Elk meat to start with.  Yum, they are good with some spicing up as others stated.

Good start, but needs work. First, the rice did not/ will not cook in the skillet or subsequently in the peppers - it must be cooked 15-20 minutes ahead of time (rice cookers are good for this, set and forget). Also, don't add the water to the skillet ( you won't need it too cook the rice) and mine were a watery mess when opened. The peppers add plenty of moisture when they cook. Finally, just add all the ingredients (except the peppers and cheese) to a food processor and pulse for 30 seconds. Saves a ton of chopping / prep time.

I've made this several times now and it is truly amazing. I have always adjusted the recipe based on what I have on hand. Substituting dried parsley/basil  for fresh and tomato sauce for soup. I also always mix in the tomato sauce.  When I first started making this I used half chorizo and half ground beef. Now I use soy chorizo and ground turkey or just the soy chorizo.  There is no taste or texture difference between soy and "real" chorizo.  But it makes it much healthier. I also chop up the tops of the bell peppers and add them in with the rest of the vegetables,  it gives it more of the pepper flavor.  Even my super picky husband loves this dish.

This recipe was an amazing base! I did make a few changes though. I used a lb of ground turkey and half a link of pork chorizo. I also used long grain rice cooked in chicken bouillon powder. I chose organic rustic cut roasted tomatoes, and topped with 100% natural tomato basil soup by cookwell & company and jalapeño jack cheese. As stated in other comments, I used organic cilantro instead of parsley, a spoon of cumin and seasoned to taste with salt and pepper as directed. Though it doesn't seem like it, this is bursting with flavor. My husband has never eaten a stuffed bell pepper and is very picky - he absolutely loved it. It is coming up to my mother's birthday who passed away and this was one of her favorite meals, which I have never attempted to make before now. I was nervous I would be disappointed if it didn't taste like hers, but I was not disappointed.  Slightly different, but sooooo good! I will definitely be making this again!

My husband loves this recipe. The only change I make is that I use orzo instead of rice because I always feel the rice never cooks through. Other than that, it is super yummy!!

My rice didn't cook fully and was still a little firm which took a little away from enjoying it completely. I couldn't imagine using anything other than Chorizo as it adds so much to the meal just like the tomato soup topping which I really was questioning putting on.

Overall it was an extremely enjoyable and filling meal.  Thanks to the Allrecipe app I was shown this great recipe.

Loved this recipe! Made it with ground beef instead of the chorizo and cheddar instead of the 3 types of cheeses because that's what I had on hand. My boyfriend used the extra tomato sauce as a dipping sauce for the pepper. I will be keeping this recipe for future use!

This was excellent, great recipe.. I only had to make one change and that was because of preference, I switched out the chorizo for Italian turkey sausage that I buy from aldi.. This is going to sound strange but the left overs tasted like imo's pizza from st.louis, planning to make it again soon.

I used 2-10 oz. tubes of chorizo, (one pork, one beef), and mopped up the grease with paper towels.  I always use a wild rice blend, simmering the mixture 45 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.  Not knowing how much basil, parsley, salt and pepper to use, I used 1 heaping teaspoon each of freeze-dried herbs, (might use more next time), 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and no salt, topping it with black bean and corn salsa instead of tomato soup.  I didn't parboil the peppers, so baked them for 45 minutes.  It time-consuming but turned out wonderful.  Will definitely make again using bulk chorizo.

Hubby actually made this because I didn't think I was going to like it and he was begging for it. Very easy for even him, who can't follow a recipe; I was surprised because I wound up thinking it was great & he didn't find it flavorful enough for him. I used extra filling the next day for breakfast tacos.

Very yummy and well worth the stuffing effort. Everyone loved them, even my husband who doesn't like the regular stuffed peppers. I adapted a few things after making it according to directions, but the original is delish!

Really delicious!  To make it just a bit healthier, I used brown rice and pre-steamed it for 15 minutes since it takes longer to cook than white rice.  Also, this really needs cilantro instead of basil, since that compliments the chorizo a la Mexico.  :)

I will stick to traditional stuffed bell pepper recipes. This was way too "mushy". Maybe pouring the can of tomato soup over them would help. Brown rice never did cook but recipe never stated white rice.

I loved this recipe and recommended it to a friend and she said the same. The only thing I would mention is that the rice did not cook in the mixture for me. So I had to start over, boil some rice, then mix it in. Once I got that part right, it came out great. It's a lot of work, but worth it in my opinion. Makes a great Sunday dinner with some fried chicken wings and salad.

I made these and I thought they were delicious.  The only two things I changed.  One was that I didnt have regular rice so I cooked some brown rice for 10 minutes before I added it to the recipe.  Two,  I used one pound of ground turkey breast and 8 oz tube of beef chorizo instead of just 1 lb of pork chorizo.  I thought the consistency was still good.  Used red peppers.

This is now a favorite in our house. A few things we've changed: We don't boil the peppers beforehand because we like them to be a little firmer (and it cuts out a step). Based on what others said, we added some more spice to it--cumin, paprika, chipotle chili powder, and whatever else I find in my spice cabinet that would add some flavor. We also don't use tomato soup for making a gravy at the end. They are delicious by themselves.

Super easy and very tasty.  I'm not a huge fan of chorizo, but my boyfriend is and he loved them.

The best stuffed peppers that I've ever had! That said, I wish they hadn't taken quite so long to prepare. In addition to the chopping and what not, I had to simmer the filling for at least twice as long as the recipe said before the rice was properly cooked. Some day when I have a lot of time on my hands (will such a day ever come?), I will make these again.

A great stuffed pepper recipe that was enjoyed by all. I've never found the need to par boil or pre-cook my peppers, so they went into the oven as is, however, I do cover the dish with foil and make sure there's plenty of liquid on the bottom of the pan. I added more seasonings than called for and used my food processor to make the sausage finer. Terrific and thank you!

These are so good. I used green peppers and omitted the celery because I didn't have any. They were delicious. My family loved them. Can't wait to make them again.

Wow, fantastic recipe!  I used a high-quality Portuguese Chourice (can buy hot or regular; I use regular).  This sausage is dense and meaty, so I cut it into small chunks. With 6 huge peppers, though, there was no way one pound of meat would fill them, even with rice. So, I doubled the filling, using one pound of very lean ground beef with the one pound of sausage.  Used diced canned tomatoes rather than whole, dried spices (added oregano, too), and extra Worcestershire sauce. I bake my peppers in a large Dutch oven with a lid. It perfectly holds 6 (semi-cooked) bell peppers upright. After you parboil the peppers for 5 minutes, place them (cooled) into your dutch oven.  They’re so easy to fill this way. Any big, heavy pot will work.  Triple the tomato soup, so that you have extra to serve on the side – and add about 1 Tbs. or more of Worcestershire sauce to the soup for better flavor. You only need about one-half inch of the soup mixture at the bottom of the pot when you bake the peppers (I baked mine for about 40 min). Next time, I will use 2 lbs. of the Chourice and omit the ground beef, to see which version we like better.

These were terrific!  I made a couple of adjustments based on other reviews.  I added 1 lb ground venison; used the tops of bell peppers and minced them and added; instead of just rice, I used a box of Jambalya Zatarains I had on hand and I used a mexican cheese blend.  This dish really has complex, interesting, international flavor.  Excellent!  Thanks for a new fav!

I have used this recipe several times and love it. The only change I've made is to add ground pork. Chorizo can be too fatty on its own and the pork helps absorb the fat and hold the shape of the pepper. I highly recommend this recipe!

We LOVED this dish!!  I used soyrizo in place of the chorizo.  I also had some left over couscous so I used that in place of the rice.  This was so yummy!  I'll definitely be making it again.  Thanks!

these were okay.  My hubby hates bell peppers so I used poblano's instead.  which was a great idea.  However the filling was not as good as I hoped, it was bland.  I thought it was okay, hubby didn't like it.

I really enjoyed the flavors in this, but the rice didn't have quite enough time to cook.  I think next time I will cook it seperately and then add it to the mix.

This was a big hit with my family! The combination of the spicy filling and the sweet bell pepper is GREAT! I made some small changes (things I had on hand).
