I made these muffins with an egg substitution so they were vegan. I love the way they turned out! I made them for my friends, and they loved them too.

A bit too gooey and sour. The walnuts caused a bit of sweetness but cooking them made them a bit too hard. I wouldn't try them again.

Excellent, easy recipe! I poured a lttle melted butter into the bottom of each muffin tin before adding the sugar, the nuts, the pineapple chunks and a half Maraschino Cherry for a real Pineapple Upside Down Cake taste. The muffins freeze well in a Ziploc and re-heat perfectly in a microwave on low power. Good with some whipped cream on top, too! Mmmm! I think I'll have one right now!

This is a very good recipe with a bonus of a low calorie count and good nutrition. I had an abundance of pine nuts so I substituted pine nuts for the walnuts. I think it quite appropriate, pineapple and pine nuts.

I made these for my husband who eats on the run.  I was tired of him eating bacon and egg burrito's which I don't believe are healthy over the long term.  I made six muffins as opposed to 12 and added 5 minutes to the baking time.
I didn't think I could get him away from his customary burrito's but he told me that these were the best muffins he's ever had. 
He said "you offered me butter but they don't need butter, they are so good and moist, best muffin I've ever had"
I will add a little more butter to the bottom of the pan as the nuts stuck a little but i'll be making these on a regular basis.  They are awesome!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.
They are chalk full of good things and completely satisfying.

This is an awesome recipe! I had a fresh pineapple, so I used that in lieu of the canned stuff (diced it up small, and probably used a bit more than called for since I was eyeballing it) and it was SO GOOD! I left out the raisins and nuts, used applesauce instead of oil, and put a bit of butter in the bottom of the pan as suggested by another reviewer (hey, since I cut out the oil, I figured I could put the calories back somewhere else!), otherwise stuck exactly to the recipe and everyone in my house loves them. Not overly sweet, very moist, and delish! This recipe is a keeper! They'd be great for my toddler's playgroup sometime.

Will make this recipe again.  I did use Vitacost gluten free flour and skipped the raisins, and it came out deliciously.  The muffins were moist, sweet, and flavorful.  My brown sugar was part Stevia.  I added a small amount of salt to bring out more flavor.  Many of the muffins were stored in a large baggy in the freezer to prevent over-eating them, and my husband and I have been enjoying them as an after-dinner treat on occasion.  Just warmed in the microwave on low power until warm.  Thank you for this great recipe!

These were delicious.  I followed the advice of another and started by drizzling a small amount of butter into the tins. 
Thank you for a very tasty recipe.

Preparation took  longer than expected.  Gathering all the ingredients alone took the 20 minutes. The process went smoothly after that and the result was worth the time spent.  I would definitely make this again. It was enjoyed by all and adding a cream cheese spread gave it an extra taste treat.

This recipe was very good & a different spin on muffins.  I didn't have carrots or raisins, so added 1/2 cup sour cream  to replace the missing moisture.  I made mine using cupcake liners & placed the pineapple pieces & 1/2 of a maraschino cherry on top with the brown sugar/butter streusel sprinkled over them.  Tons of compliments! Will definitely make again, but maybe wit the added fruits & veggies next time :)

Love these! Thank you for sharing this healthy and delicious muffin recipe. What a great way to get some carrots into the kids too! They'll never know they are in there! I opted out of the walnuts and raisins, but made them as directed otherwise. Mine were done at 15 mins, so I recommend checking them at that time. I could not find a 10 ounce can of sliced pineapple, so I used (2) 8 oz cans which worked out for me because I was able to get 14 muffins out of this recipe. Thanks again!

I loved the thought of all these ingredients together. I was afraid they were going to be too sweet. Not the case. However I substituted coconut flour for the Wheat Flour(?), not a good idea. very dense not moist at all. Had to throw them out. I'll try again at a later date.:-(
