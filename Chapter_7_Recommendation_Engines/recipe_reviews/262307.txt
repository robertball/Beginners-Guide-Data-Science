I made these with Andrea's recipe for braised pork belly. These buns are nice on their own and taste just like the steamed bao I know. I have made plain bao before but never this 'folding' style so the technique is a little new to me. I steamed these in batches in my wok. Overall a basic, simple, authentic tasting recipe. My kids loved them. Thanks!

These were really good! I stuffed them with Rhubarb Pulled Pork. I followed the recipe exactly. I donâ€™t have a bamboo steamer, but have a rice steamer with plastic baskets and it worked just fine. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!!
