This is really very good.  I made it in a 9" spring form pan and it was a little thin.  I would double the recipe next time.  When I make this again & there will be a next time - I will add a layer of sweet potatoes & maybe stir some of the cranberry or dried cranberries into the cheesecake layer.  You could do a layer of vegetables too.  Thanks for an inspiring recipe Sarah.

Absolutely wonderful! I substituted sour cream for the ricotta. The pie firms up very nicely and is even better as a leftover (yes, leftovers from leftovers...). Thank you for such a unique dish!

This recipe is a real conversation starter!  And it tastes great too!!  In our house there is no such thing as leftover stuffing or cranberry sauce, so here are my CHANGES: I made a large box of stuffing as per the instructions on the box but I had to add 3 tablespoons of gravy to the stuffing to get it extra moist, so it would press into the pan well.  I used an immersion blender for the cheese mixture which worked well and made the cake light and fluffy.  THE COOKING TIME WAS OFF ON THIS: after 35 minutes the centre was still runny, so I left it in for another 7 minutes.  I finished it by spreading the canned sauce on top and baking it for another 10 minutes.  For a total of 52 minutes cooking time.   LET IT STAND FOR 5-10 MINUTES before slicing, this helped it slice beautifully.   TO SERVE: No side dishes necessary for this meal, it was great on its own.  This would be a great "make ahead dish" as it tasted even better the next day and was easy to reheat in the oven and microwave.  Anyhow great job Sarah!  This will be my new party dish for potlucks and showers.

Not bad, but far from great. Needs a bit of doctoring. Maybe some broccoli or asparagus. The cranberry topping gave it an odd taste. I'll make this again, but with a few changes.

This was a great way to finish off the leftover turkey. I didnt have more than a tablespoon of gravy left but even with that this was a great dish. I will make it again!

This recipe is the best part of Thanksgiving dinner (or any other day!). We love it. The only thing I do differently is, after it's cooked, add some warmed gravy over the top (the stuffing always comes out a little dry, anyway -- and who doesn't like a little extra gravy?). Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This dish couldn't be easier, but I thought it was just okay - kind of bland.  Half the family really liked it  - something different and easy for leftovers.  Not sure if I'd make it again though.

This is one of the best ways to have Thanksgiving in July or to use up all those Thanksgiving leftovers.  The next time we will make homemade cranberry sauce rather than cooking down that canned stuff.  The name of this recipe is awful (people twitch when I tell it to them) but can't turn down the finished product.  The hubby literally went crazy over this. Used the Slow Cooker Turkey Breast recipe (and used the leftovers from that to make Turkey Posole - also from this recipe - amazing also!), then the Bread and Celery recipe for the stuffing.  Took some of the broth leftover from the Slow Cooker Turkey and thickened it with  a little cornstarch. So happy to find this recipe - when I explain it, it sounds magical to people. Just don't tell them the name and call it a Thanksgiving Casserole :)

Simply Scrumptious - all the goodies of Thanksgiving rolled up into one tasty dish !!  Used a 9x9 Pyrex instead of a pie pan which required double the stuffing - followed the recipe to the letter on everything else - loved every mouthful....and leftovers of this leftover were wonderful !!

This was a real pleasant surprise. I have now made it several times and it turns out well every time. I now make sure to roast an extra big turkey with stuffing so we can have this cheesecake. It will also freeze once it has Ben baked.

We really loved this -- so different than other leftover turkey recipes (and a great way to use so many Thanksgiving leftovers!)  I've made it many times and loved it every time.

This recipe is just ok as written, but it has 5 star possibility and creativity, so I gave it a 4! I just made this for the first time, and it is a great BASIC recipe. It lacks proper seasoning and needs some general bedazzling. The recipe makes a small pie, and I was feeding a bunch so I tripled the crust, doubled the filling, and used a 9x13 glass pan. No matter how much you make, I would increase the amount of crust stated in the recipe. I used about 2 cups of turkey (light and dark meat) and about 1 cup of ham, but wish I had switched the ratios and used more ham than turkey. I added some squash casserole and a few leftover carrots to the filling, but wanted more vegetables. It needs a LOT more vegetables to fill it out and give it some texture. The cheese/egg mixture is a good ratio, but is very bland with just the gravy to season it. I used extra gravy, salt, pepper, garlic powder and parsley. I did not use the cranberry sauce on top, but I would probably just blend in a spoonful with the seasoning for flavor, not sweetness, if I did use it. This could be a 5 STAR conversation starter with a few changes. 1) Increase the ratio of crust to filling. 2) Season the cheese/egg mixture before adding meat or veggies! 3) Increase the amount of meat, and note that ham will have more flavor than turkey. 4) Add some veggies! Trust me, the texture/flavor is not quite right without them. At least 1 cup if the recipe is made as written, more if increased. Would be great with leftover

Just made this last night. Not going to lie a little nervous about making a Turkey cheesecake. However, we make a lot of turkeys so I am always looking for different way to use the leftovers. I was really surprised by how good this was. Since its a cheesecake made it in a 9 1/2" spring form pan. I used 1 and 1/2 cups stuffing for the crust and for me that still wasn't enough. Next time I will do 3 c. I doubled the cheesecake filling, because its a cheesecake, so filling should be a thick layer. It would have been way to thin and not half as filling if I didn't. I also added a cup of corn. This was a delightful addition. Next Time, I will also be adding a 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper to the filling to amp it up even more. I didn't use the cranberry sauce and honestly I didn't miss it at all. I cooked it for at least an extra 10 min. Until it had a nice golden brown look to the top of it. Oh! Don't forget to grease your pan! I definetly suggest making this though. Great leftover recipe. Follow my adjustments and you'll say 5 stars too!

I didn't have a spring form pan and wanted to showcase this after it was baked so I lined a 9 inch cake pan with parchment so I could lift it out nicely afterwards then I pressed my stuffing into it (also forgot to add the gravy to stuffing but it was moist enough I don't think it needed it) then followed the directions with the addition of 2 tsp dried parsley for color to the cheese turkey mixture. Baked an additional 7 mins as the middle didn't look set then topped it off with spicy cranberry preserves and served. I should have taken a picture it was nice looking and Everyone loved it!! Will make every time I have leftovers.

I liked it however I would use a drier stuffing for the purposes of a crust.

Didn't have any cranberries so I added sweet potatoes and toped all with mashed potatoes mixed with gravy. Easy to make.
