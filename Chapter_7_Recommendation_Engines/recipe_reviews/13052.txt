Great Recipe!  But I didn't saute the lettuce, instead I just chopped it and used it as a garnish for the soup.  That way it stays crispy and fresh.  Also, I chopped up the bacon and added extra bacon as well.  This one is something wonderfully different.  A little place here in town serves this once in a while and they say it is their most popular and most requested soups.

I was VERY skeptical about adding lettuce to a soup, but it really does work in this soup.  Try it!  It was excellent, my husband loved it so much he has already asked for it again.  The main modifications I made were to use more of what was called for in the recipe (more bacon, more tomatoes, a bit of extra water).  I skipped the margerine, just didn't seem necessary with the bacon grease.  I also garnished with some tomato flavored croutons.  This one is a keeper, thank you!

This tasted pretty good and was easy to make. I substituted
- 1/4cup butter and 1/4cup milk instead of half-and-half
- water in roughly the same amount as grease (in lieu of bacon grease)
- 14oz can of chicken broth instead of the chicken soup base and water the recipe calls for. The actual serving size of the recipe is smaller than 8 servings, more like 4 servings.

A lot of steps to get this one done but worth the effort on the cold nights.  I actually doubled the recipe and added more chicken base and spices.  It does have the BLT taste to it.

Interesting and different soup. I can see why some may not care for this as much as the lettuce when cooked become "wilted" in both appearance and texture. I used a little more chicken stock, added some dry minced onions (when I added the water) and more bacon, which I crumbled and mixed INTO the soup when I added the half & half. Needed a little S&P but overall, it was a good soup and it was enjoyed. Thanks Lonnie.

For me, this had far too much flour and made the broth very goopy. This was easily fixed with some more base and water. I did find I wanted a stronger tomato flavor so added a spoonful of homemade tomato sauce to the soup... perfect
