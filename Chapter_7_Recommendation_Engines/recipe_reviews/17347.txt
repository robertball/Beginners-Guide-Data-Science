Wonderful broccoli salad!!  Since my sister is a diabetic, I omitted the raisins and mixed the salad dressing with 1 Tbsp.of cider vinegar (didn't have tarragon) and then added 1/3 cup Splenda, beating all together.  Great recipe!!  Thanks!!

Great!  I did not have the vinegar the recipe called for, so I used balsamic vinegar instead  - I mixed it with regular ol' Ranch Dressing - I used a little less dressing that the recipe called for - I don't like the dressing to overpower the food.

This salad was delicious!  The different textures and colors made the dish so tasty.  I used a poppy seed dressing.  I omitted the tarragon vinegar so it wouldn't compete with the flavor of the dressing.

This is just plain good!! I used a little light mayo, a little poppy seed dressing and a little regular mayo to make the required amount of creamy salad dressing the recipe called for.  I reduced the vinegar a bit since the poppy seed dressing already had vinegar in it.

We were told to add more broccoli into our diet.  I am glad I tried this one.  Yum.  I made the recipe as is except I used lite mayo and white wine vinegar with 3 packets of splenda.  It was wonderful.  Oh, I also added cheese, but I wish I wouldn't have :)  This is a keeper.

Good. Next time I will cut down on the vinegar. I added sunflower seeds. Used a purple onion instead of green. I also added sharp cheddar. Thanks!

Wonderful flavors and texture!!  My husband didn't think he would like it when he saw it but loved it!  I made some minor substitutions, but also, I steamed the broccoli for about a minute then put it in an ice bath.  It was still very crunchy but not entirely raw--I'm not a huge fan of raw broccoli.  I used a fat-free poppy seed dressing with white wine vinegar, and used black seedless grapes and dried cranberries.  I also used turkey bacon.  Was delicious!!!

This turned out very well. I had eaten a similar salad at a family member's previously and wanted to make it myself. This recipe was as close as I could find, but it turned out even better. I made it for 40 people, with alot of other food, so most of my measurements were more by sight and taste, but with these ingrediants it turned out perfectly. This was the only item that had no leftovers at the 40 person event.

This is a great broccoli Salad.  Good variation from the regular one.  I used Miracle whip instead of the salad dressing and apple cider vinegar instead of the tarragon, I also added a tbsp of Splenda.

Terrific salad - took it to a get-together and not a drop was left.  I substituted balsamic vinegar and used sunflower seeds instead of almond slivers.  Have used it several times over.

Loved this recipe.  Made it for a large group and everyone wanted the recipe.  I used Craisins instead of Raisins reduced the dressing a bit.  Started with less mayonnaise and added about 4 tsps. of wine vinegar and sugar to taste.  Also used crushed cashews.  Fantastic!

I didn't put the raisins in as my son doesn't like them. It was still a hit. I will be making this one again soon. I wish there was a non creamy dressing though.

I had this salad at a church fellowship yesterday.  It was refreshing.  I enjoyed the variety of flavors that come together in this salad.  The church member that made the salad substituted almonds for sunflower seeds and left out the grapes and it was still great.  I'm going to start making this at home!

This was a great salad.  I added green grapes and it was still great. It made quite an impression on the family for the holidays, instead of plan broccoli.

This was my first broccoli salad and I loved it.  Everyone ate it up.  The dressing was not over powering and there was so many other goodies besides the broccoli.  I added 1 tablespoon of sunflower seeds just for fun.  yummy!

I made this a couple of weeks ago and followed receipe to a T.  Very good, but not quite a 5.  I think it would be great at a summer bbq where it could be made ahead of time.
