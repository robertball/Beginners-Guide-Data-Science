I made this for Thanksgiving with my inlaws with a few alterations. I didn't use the horseradish (didn't have any) and used my own discretion with brown sugar. It was a hit! And today is Christmas with the inlaws, and it's been requested, so here I am getting the ingredient list to go make it again!

Very tasty with the horseradish and a super quick side dish to put together considering that I already had the cooked & mashed sweet potato in the freezer.  Used brown sugar and garnished with fresh snipped chives for a sweet and savory taste.

I was a little skeptical about the horseradish and the sweet potatoes, but this was great!  The first bite was a bit off, but after I let the potatoes sit for about ten minutes, the horseradish mellowed and it tasted wonderful.  Very quick  since I did the potatoes in the microwave.

I really loved this recipe and I don't like horseradish, but it is so good in here with the honey.  Go ahead give it a shot, you won't be dissapointed.  I will make them this way all the time.  Thanks for posting.

Why is it that everyone who gave this less than 5 stars didn't follow the recipe correctly? Don't leave this and that out- and then complain that it isn't good. I followed this to a T and it was phenomenal. Thanks!

Even if you are not a fan of horseradish this dish is outstanding!  My girlfriend served it up to me at her house for dinner, I couldn't get enough of them.  I was a bit leary how they would taste, but I am game to try most everything.  Use less horseradish if you are a bit skidish ... I 've made this recipe twice already, yummmm.  Worth trying!

Great! I was a little worried about honey+hoseradish, but it was awesome! I used a can of yams and it still turned out great! Will definitely make at holiday dinners!

My boyfriend gawked at the horseradish but I'm the type that has to 'stick to the recipe'! Sure am glad I did! I will DEFINITELY be adding this to my rotation of side dishes to cook at home! Yummy and healthy as well! Also; I did not have heavy cream so I used milk. Will want to try with cream next time but I'm sure it's delicious either way.

We really liked these, but would use half the horseradish next time,  the ratio to the honey was overpowering for us

these were fantastic. i didn't bake them in the oven though. i just peeled them, cut them in to cubes and then boiled them for about 15 minutes. then i went to step 2. i was very skeptical about using horseradish but it made the dish. they are so tasty. i served them along side the brown sugar meatloaf from this site and some broccoli. i think i like these better than regular mashed potatoes.

Not sure about this one. I felt the horseradish took away from the sweet potato too much. It was tasty but I think I will stick to making mine with butter, salt, and pepper.

So good! I added more horsie sauce, as we like things spicy and cut down on the honey. Used milk instead of cream and added a little non fat greek yogurt. I served it with crock pot turkey breast, homemade gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce (poor man's thanksgiving) and my husband said the sweet potatoes made the meal. Will definitely make over and over again, interesting combo instead of butter and brown sugar.

We're not big on sweet so I left out the honey and still felt like the horseradish enhanced the sweet taste without adding the enough zip.   They were good enough that I might try them again with a little more horseradish. I really wanted to like these more than I did.

My family and I were never big sweet potato eaters but I wanted to try something new.  These potatoes were pretty tasty but I think I may have used the wrong horseradish.  I used extra hot course ground and the flavor was definitely noticeable in the dish.  Next time I will try a milder form.  Overall the potatoes were delicious and not too sweet like most sweet potato dishes.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good...I like horseradish, so I think I may add a little more next time.  However, as is the flavors blend very well.

My husband is a big fan of horseradish so I will definitely try this.  When making sweet potatoes, I usually boil them with a couple of carrots, and mash together.  I also like to add thin slices of apple to the dish, layering them, drizzling honey over each layer.

Wow, this was the best Sweet Potato Mash I've ever had. It balances the sweet and adds a degree of intrigue. I did add about 1/4 cup of brown sugar, since my sweet potatoes weren't very sweet.

Great recipe! I made it for a group of about 30 and served it for immediate family. I used # 10 cans of Sweet Potato for the large group & it worked great. A added note: Both times I placed leftovers in a glass bowl, refrigerated  and later used as a cracker snack(inverting the bowl to serving plate with cracker/chips)

I used garnet yams, left out the honey, and added a little salt.  I give this 5 stars.  My husband hates yams, or sweet potatoes, but loved this.  Oh, I also added a small amt. of crumbled bacon.  It's Thanksgiving... we went all out in the taste department.

WOW.  I haven't found a mashed sweet potato recipe that I have loved.... until now!!!!!  I like a number of the other reviewers was a bit nervous about the horseradish....  I didn't need to worry at all.  I played the guess the secret ingredient game with my husband... He never guessed.

Exceptional!  A welcome flavour change and simply done too;  I cooked the sweet potatoes in the  mircowave which speeded things up considerably. Delicious!  Served with Brown Sugar Meatloaf, on this website, as another reviewer suggested.  Yum!

Pretty good.  I would not suggest making this dish in advance and warming it up.  It got to a very thin consistency which seemed like you were eating baby food.  Good taste though.

I love horseradish and sweet potatoes so I thought it would be worth it to give this recipe a shot.  For some reason though I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.  The pop of the horseradish and the sweetness of the sweet potatoes didn't go together.  If you're looking to add some heat to your sweet potatoes try a little bit of cayenne.

Very good, used for thanksgiving as a savory dish and it was amazing. I used the yellow sweet potatoes and not the red ones that we call "yams" here in the USA.

This is a 3.50 star for us.  The honey is not really necessary as the potatoes are sweet enough.  Did like the horseradish flavor in the background.  Subbed soy milk for the cream and it was plenty creamy.  I would make again but I would up the butter a bit, definitely omit the honey and add a little bacon for flavor.

I'm not a huge sweet potato fan but I love this recipe.  The honey and horseradish flavors are a great combination.  The only change I made was that I used skim milk instead of cream.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome sweet potato dish. I was a bit skeptical at first, especially about the horseradish, but this was a hit at my house. Even a hit with the kids.

A surprising taste that we loved! I even forgot to add the butter and only threw in a splash of almond milk at the end. We will be making it again!

Never in a million years would I have thought that sweet potatoes and horseradish would go well together.  Who knew?!!  This was very good, love the sweet and bitey flavors.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I baked the potatoes in the microwave.  Served with grilled pork, and a bourbon sauce poured over all.  DH doesn't like sweet potatoes so I also made him some regular mashed, but he tried these and liked them!

We were a little worried about this at first but it was excellent! The horseradish added just a little punch of flavor. Will make again!

i liked this! it didn't blow me away - but it was so nice to find a sweet potato recipe with some heat...they're always so sweet! it needs a little somethingsomething to push it to the next level - but i'll definitely be making it again to find out what that is!

This was very good. Next time I will leave out the honey, as the sweet potatoes are sweet enough on their own. I also used skim milk instead of the cream.

The combination of sweet potatoes and horseradish was just enough to intrigue me...I'm so glad it did. This recipe is awesome! I get tired of sweet potatoes and brown sugar. This recipe put a new twist on an old favorite. I craved this for days afterwords. I paired it with simple sauteed spinach and onions and baked halibut. It was a great combination. I have already made this twice and plan to make it over and over and over again.

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it.  I went a little light on the horseradish and honey, thought I would add more as needed.  Glad I did, as always, a little horseradish goes a long way.  Don't think I will make again.  I guess I should stick with the Brown sugar/cinnamon route.

Sounded like it might be a strange combo of flavors, but it really ended up delicious. I boiled quartered sweet potatoes instead of baking them and this freed up my oven for the chicken I was making. They turned out fantastic.

Way too heavy on the horseradish, I thought. Next time I'll back off on it a bit, and they'll be perfect. Great recipe!

I was looking for something different when I stumbled on this recipe.  The horseradish adds a tangy pop that most people don't expect .  We loved it even though I grabbed buttermilk instead of heavy cream.  Next time I'll reach past the buttermilk.

I just made this for the first time tonight, and just finished my second helping. It's ambrosia with a kick! I wasn't sure about adding the honey, as I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it's perfect. Will definitely be making this again - and, again, and again.

I made this tonight  as a different side for dinner. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the horseradish. 2 tablespoons of honey was a bit sweet for me, but my family loved it the way it was. Thanks for the great new addition to our side dish rotation.

We love horseradish mashed potatoes.  But I can't say I enjoyed it in mashed sweet potatoes.  No one here liked them.

Its Thanksgiving morning and I just made this recipe to take to my mom's for dinner later...followed it to a tee! I wanted to make sure it was good so I sampled it and I think the combination of the sweet potato with the horseradish is awesome! I was septical but it really tastes great. I hope my family enjoys it today too! The only extra thing I did was add a few pats of butter and a sprinkle of light brown sugar as a topping.

I love sweet potatoes anyway, but this recipe is SO good and SO easy!!   No worries about the horseradish overpowering the potatoes.   It's adds a nice touch but it doesn't scream horseradish.    I started off adding in about the half the recommended amount and when it was safe that it wouldn't kill the dish with it, I ended up using the full amount.   Wonderful!

I didn't use horseradish so I just put in the honey, salt and butter and it turned out very well! I also boiled the potatoes for about 20min instead of baking

I have not tried this with the horseradish because I cannot stand the taste. Instead I used a bit of canned chipotles in adobe sauce and a bit less honey. I've also used agave syrup instead of the honey. The chipotles add the spice and smoky heat. I can't even sneak up on horseradish so this was my only alternative and they are absolutely yummy!

I made this as a side for my Christmas dinner roasted chicken. They were so delish I used my finger to clean out the food processor cup. I did find however that I had to roast the sweet potatoes for a little less than the recipe recommends and used the food processor to mash because there was a stringy texture to the hand mashed potatoes. Overall I love this recipe and so did boyfriend. My 9 year old turned her nose up because of the horseradish.

I love these potatos. I made them last thanksgiving and everyone loved them (I omitted the sugar all together). The next day, I took the leftovers (I made a double batch for 6 people ... we're talking not a lot of leftovers), I added about 3 carrots and half a squash (boiled and roasted respectively) and it tasted the same but we had enough to go around the next day. Excellent share. thanks PJ!
