Last year on St. Pats I made boiled corned beef and this version. The flavor of this recipe was superior to the traditional boiled corned beef, but the baked corned beef was FAR too tough. In prep for this year's St. Pats feast, I tried boiling the corned beef according to the package directions, then draining it, patting it dry, adding the glaze, and baking it for approx 30 minutes (I turned the broiler on for the last couple of minutes to carmelize the top -- watch it carefully though!!) My family agreed it was the best corned beef they had ever tasted. This will be our St. Pats corned beef recipe from now on.

You've GOT TO TRY THIS for St. Pat's Day! Great recipe if you boil the corned beef first. I simmered it with the spice packet for 3.5 hours and threw some carrots in the water for the last 20 minutes. Took it out, cut off the fat, and placed it in a 9x13 glass dish along with the carrots. Spread the glaze all over and baked for 30 minutes at 350. I made Diane's Colcannon from this site as a side dish. This is better than any restaurant meal you could possibly have!

Wow this glaze was amazing.  I had actually baked the corned beef for 5 hours in 2 bottles of Guiness Beer and then filled the pan the rest of the way with water to cover the meat and added the seasoning packet.  Then I took the corned beef out of the liquid and just left a small amount in the bottom of the pan and added a layer of glaze every 15 minutes for an hour.  I broiled it on high for the last 10 minutes and it ended up coming out so great that even my kids (who would have never eaten corned beef before), loved it.  I will never make corned beef any other way from now on!

This was fabulously delicious.  I put the corned beefs (I cooked 3 of them!) in roasting pans and filled the pans to within an inch of the top with water and added the spice packs that came with the corned beefs.  Then I covered them with foil and put them in the oven at only 250 degrees for 5 hours.  Uncovered them, drained most of the water as well as removed the fat, added the glaze, put my carrots in with the corned beefs, and baked them at 350 for another hour, basting both the carrots and beefs occassionally.  YUMMY, and the carrots were delish, too!  3/18/07 update:  Cut all leftovers into bite-sized chunks, melted butter in large skillet, put in the leftovers (corned beef, carrots, cabbage, potatoes and turnip).  Cooked on medium high, stirring, for a few minutes.  Turned stove to low, covered the skillet, and heated for about 20 minutes - this was SUPER "corned beef hash".

GREAT!!!! My spouse is Irish and has had alot of cornbeef and this was the best by far.  I did cook the cornbeef in a slow cooker for 8 hours and turned out very tender and moist. I think leaving this step out may produce a tough dish.

I have not boiled corned beef now for over 2 years.  The corned beef is SOOOOO flavorful. It is very important to wash the brine off the corned beef first (this keeps it from being to salty).  Cover 1/2 way with water and cover. Seasonings are optional.  Cooking times may very, but the slower the better. 200-250 degrees.  I check after 2 hours and go from there.  It is done when the strands start to seperate.  This next step is VERY IMPORTANT!  When the corned beef is done, take the juice and dump into a pot.  Add potatos, cabbage and enough water to cover and boil till tender.  Add carrots and 1/4 inch of water to pan and glaze both the corned beef and carrots. DON"T BROIL (it will burn).  Bake on 450 for 20-30 minutes.  It will still burn if your not careful, the goal here is to glaze! just be vigilant.  Once the corned beef is glazed remove from pan and set on plate and cover with foil and let sit for 10-15 minutes. If the carrots are not done leave in pan till tender.  Follow these instruction and I guarentee the absolute best corned beef you will EVER have!

Very yummy recipe. I have been wanting to perfect a delicious St. Patty's Day menu. I have to say this is probably as close as I'll get. I rinsed my beef well and put it in the crock on low with a cup of water and the pickling seasongs for about 8 hours. Then when I got home from work, I made the glaze and transfered the beef and juice to a baking pan, spread the glaze on top and baked uncovered for 30 mins. I served it with boiled carrots and cabbage, and mashed potatoes. Very good. Everyone loved it.

This is a delicious recipe! I rinsed the corned beef, but it was still a little salty. The sauce is great!(though it burned before beef was done). Nexttime I will cook the beef in water in a slow cooker then put in oven with sauce over for a 1/2 hour, so it isn't as salty & a little more tender.(and no burned sauce). Definately a re-do (with adjustments) Thanks!

I've never eaten corned beef before and this rocks! I can't imagine eating it just plain and bolied.  I used 3 1/2lb CB rinsed and trimmed off fat, simmered for 2 1/2 hours w/ 3/4 pack of the seasoning that came w/ it, drain and pat dry.  Then glazed the CB and baked it w/ 2 vidalia onions, mini carots and new red potatoes (par boil the car/pot. about 10 min. in the stock from earlier to ensure cooking thr.)then bake for 25 minutes as directed then broiled for about 12 minutes - mixing veggies as needed thr. cook time. I served w/ the veggies, boiled nappa cabbage and rye breaed. I would cut down to 3 tbs of sugar next time but this is an awesome easy fool proof recipe that I will happily take to any Patty's Day or football party!!!!  The boys loved it CHEERS!!!!!!!

At least it's a different way to serve corned beef.

I always love to cook my corned beef in a crockpot for 8 hours. I then trim the fat and put the corned beef on a foil wrapped cookie sheet. I apply the glaze and cook in the oven @ 350 degrees for 20 minuets. Perfect every time.

I'm with the other reviewers, I like to boil mine (in the oven) for a few hours on low heat (250F) before roasting.  It makes a big difference in the salt content and I can save my broth to par boil my veggies then add to the beef as it roasts at a high heat with the glaze.    I cut back on the soy and added a touch of stone ground mustard instead.  It was just delicious and I added my parboiled potatoes, carrots and cabbage to the roast for the last 30 minutes or so.  Perfection!  Thanks for sharing.    Just as a sidenote, rinsing the corned beef of the brine coating does not reduce the salt volume that much.  A brine is an absorption into the meat, so rinsing the outside only takes off so much of the salt.  You really need to rely on a bit of water cooking to draw alot of the salt out.

I have been looking for a good CB recipe for quite some time. I am not a fan of boiling meat. Just doesn't sound right and leaves it with an odd color. I followed this one exactly except adjusted the baking time to suit my taste. I must say it turned out great. Baking uncovered for the last 30 to 40 minutes is key for the glaze. Thank you.

Love this, but I did it like a more traditional kosher roasted corned beef. I first roasted at about 300 for five hours covered with foil and then I basted with the sauce and broiled it briefly till it carmelized. The secret is the LONG slow roast. It tenderizes the cut beautifully.

This was good.  Cooked the corned beef in my crock pot and then moved to oven for 30 minutes with glaze, as per other directions.  Did add some carrots and potatoes and they were jazzed up by the glaze.  I'll save the recipe and pull out in March for a bit o' the Irish in our menu.

I had purchased a brisket for St. Patrick's Day thinking that I would be the only one eating it as no one else in the family is too keen on corned beef. That was until this recipe. My kids got to sample a little before dinner and absolutely loved it! It is so tender and tasty I can see there won't be any leftovers. I made only one small change - I used only a 1/2 cup of black cherry fruit spread instead of the full cup of apricot preserves...only because that was what was on hand. The subtle cherry flavor in the glaze is fabulous. This recipe is in my recipe box to be used over and over in the future.  [Edited 3/8/09] If this isn't the best corned beef recipe I don't know what could be. My kids are already asking me to make this for St. Patrick's Day again this year! They normally don't have a long term memory on recipes I make but this one certainly made an impression.

There is only one thing wrong with the recipe, don't expect a lot of leftovers. My husband could not quit raving and eating this Rorned Beef. He said it was the best he ever had and did not even want to put horseradish on it.  I did simmer it for an two hours and then followed the receipe exactly. 
  Thanks Melody for a wonderful recipe.

Wow!  This is INCREDIBLE!!  I trimmed the fat from the beef and rinsed it well then put it in a pot and boiled it for about three hours (I actually used 2 briskets, 1 -3lb and 1 -2lb, I used one seasoning packet for both.)  After it boiled I followed the recipe for baking it with the apricot spread.  It came out really tender, after it was sliced, we didn't even need a knife to cut it.  The sauce was great!  It was sweet but not overpowering. Very, Very Good!!

I absolutely loved my annual St. Patrick's Day corned beef cooked this way! The only change I made was to add 2 tablespoons of mustard to the glaze. The glaze was so good that we all sat around the table picking at the bits stuck to the platter. It was like eating candy! The corned beef itself turned out tender but firm. It didn't all fall to pieces the way it does when I just boil it. I served it with buttered boiled potatoes and cabbage. Wonderful!

This was fabulous! I love the idea of using apricot preserves as a main ingredient in the glaze. I cooked the meat in a slow cooker on low for close to 8 hours. It was perfect!

First time ever making corned beef. I went the slow cooker route and it came out perfect. The sweet sauce makes for a perfect combo with the salty beef. yum!

Would have given 5 stars if not for:

Step 2 - "Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 2 hours; drain liquid.". After draining the liquid the bottom of the corned beef and the glaze that ran off burned in the bottom of the pan. 

Step 4 - "Bake uncovered at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) 25 to 30 more minutes, or until the meat is tender; basting occasionally with pan drippings". What "pan drippings"? I just removed all the liquid!

Next time I will remove "some" liquid with a turkey baster and put it aside to baste then leave enough liquid in the pan to avoid burning. Also the removed liquid will make an great Au Jus prior to adding glaze.

Flavor and tenderness were excellent with the exception of the burned bottom which I cut off.

BTW - I used 50/50 "Guinness" and water, after all it was St. Patick's Day.

My husband said "always make corned beef this way!" This was a most amazing dish, especially since I used an Apricot-Jalapeno preserve.  The sweet/hot combo on the corned beef was legendary!  This is my new go-to for corned beef!

My rating is strictly for the glaze. I prepared my corned beef, carrots, cabbage, potatoes and onions the old-fashioned way on the stove top. Before adding the vegetables, I removed the brisket, placed it fat side up on a baking pan and smothered it in this glaze. While the vegetables were cooking in the liquid on the stove, the brisket baked in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. Seriously tasty. I'm hoping for some leftovers, because I'm sure the beef would make a great sandwich.

I've been looking for a way to make corned beef that doesn't involve beer, was happy to find this.  I chose to simmer mine on the stove top for the first part because I wanted it to be tender and moist.  It took about 5 hours in my dutch oven, overall this method worked well.  Will plan better next time so I can try it in the slow cooker.  I had a 3lb brisket so I only mixed a half-recipe, I trimmed the fat before applying the glaze.  There was still plenty glaze for my carrots which I par-boiled for 10 mins, then arranged around the meat on a foil-lined baking pan (made potatoes too, but only brushed glaze on the carrots, also sprinkled on some marjoram).  Baked at 350 for about 25 minutes, it could have gone just a little longer to caramelize the edges more.  The whole meal came out really good, the glaze compliments the corned beef nicely.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and a snap to make.  I cooked the meat in a slow cooker on low for 10 hours.  Meat was so tender I had to use a spatula to get it onto a baking pan without breaking.  Then put the meat into the oven to finish with the glaze.  My family loved it and wants more.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is our favorite corned beef recipe.  It does need to be cooked longer than indicated in the recipe if you want it to be tender. I cook in my crockpot with the corned beef seasonings for at least 12 hours & then remove, coat with apricot glaze and bake in oven for 10-15 minutes. The 20-30 minutes recommended in the recipe tends to cause the sauce to burn.

I made this recipe today and the family loved it. I customized it by cooking in a crockpot for 7 hours, then drained thr liquid and brushed on the glaze several times over the next hour. It was great!

wow! yum! and thanx!  i had never made a corned beef before, but it was on sale at the store.  i found this recipe and it was a hit!  i took the advice of others and boiled the meat first and baked with the glaze for the last 35 minutes.  it was sooooo good.  my husband absolutely loved it.  i think the glaze would be great on a pork roast or chicken too.  this is going to become a popular recipe in our house.

I've made this at least 10 times and it is still my family's favorite way to eat Corned Beef.  I don't change anything.  It is served with carrots, cabbage and/or sauerkraut and/or dilled potatoes.  The leftover beef makes the most ultimate sandwiches on rye using French/Russian dressing mixed together and slathered on with sprinkles of caraway seeds and sauerkraut.

I soak my beef over night in a non-reactive pot, it helps to remove more of the excess salt.  I then put the beef in a enameled cast iron Dutch oven, add the water, I never bother with the packet that comes with the beef because the beef is already corned (it's actually more for your vegetables), cover and put into a preheated 350 oven, IMMEDIATELY reduce the heat to 250. Bake for 3 hours.  The last half hour I drain off the liquid into a double boiler which I will use for steaming my veggies. But before dealing with the veggies, I spread the glaze evenly over the beef and return it back to the oven and increase the oven temp to 350 (uncovered) for about a half hour (watch carefully).  Remove from oven and let the beef sit covered on a pre-warmed serving platter on the stove for a half hour.  While the beef is "resting"  I steam my potatoes and carrots (together) until they are about half done.  Add the half done veggies to the pot with the drippings, stir to coat and return the pan to the oven uncovered for about fifteen minutes, check for doneness.  Add the potatoes and carrots to the serving platter around the beef and serve.

I didn't know untill I went to make this dish that the corned beef came "plain" with spice packet on side or pre-seasoned. I made sure I used a corn beef that was "plain". My entire family LOVED it. The apricot really does make the dish. Even my husband who is not a huge fan of corned beef thought it was very tasty. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I absolutely love this corned beef recipe. I follow the recipe and do not boil the corned beef first. Corned beef is supposed to be on the drier side and this turns out perfectly. It's great leftover as hash for breakfast. A keeper if you are tired of corned beef and cabbage.

I usually just do my corned beef with dijon mustard but I wanted something new and different.  This was really good!  An excellent variation on the usual corned beef, this recipe is sweet but not to a fault.

I served it with some sweet and sour cabbage and a nice hard roll of bread.  Went perfect paired with a bock beer!  Enjoy.

The flavor of this Corned Beef was absolutely delicious. I followed the baking instructions but found that it was a mistake to bake the CB with the glaze uncovered. The meat totally dried out. I would bake it covered with the glaze next time.

for some reason, this did not turn out for me at all, the corned beef was so tough as to be inedible.  I'm giving it 4 stars for the benefit of the doubt since I followed other reviewers' advice and boiled before the glazing stage instead of baking.

My six year old daughter has requested this for her BD dinner for the past two years. My husband, when I first made this, just went... "ugh..corned beef" and was so skeptical. Guess who requests this now?? Yep! He is a convert! It will easily simmer in a crockpot all day in its bath, then you can take it out and do the glazing part in the oven. I have found that this makes the most tender cut. I have made it all the different ways, and that is my favorite method.

This is the only corned beef my dh will request since we first tried it last year. After the first time I made it for St. Pattys day '09, he was hooked and bought several more briskets for cheap that we froze and made on later dates. We did the same this year, and it seems this is now our yearly St. Pats recipe.

Very yummy! Corned Beef is my absolute favorite and I like the difference this offers than the traditional Corned Beef & Cabbage. I do however think the Apricot glaze is slightly overpowering on the taste. Next time I will cut the amount down to maybe half. Still great though! I will definitely make this again.

Pretty good; does have a nice flavour; but the mess after baking from the carmelized marinatde almost makes it not worth the hassle.  If you're going to do this; MAKE SURE that you line the pan with al foil or something; as the marinade sticks like something shocking; it took nearly 3 hours of soaking to get it maleable enough afterwards to get the leftover marinade out.  Trully; would half the recipe next time and coat the corned beef the last 10 mins or so; up the heat a bit; to carmelize it that way; or maybe use the marinade as a dipping sauce instead..?

Did not have apricot preserves, so I used orange marmalade instead. Wow!  Fantastic flavor.  The meat was not tender cooked this way, but it may have been the cut.  Don't hesitate on buying the better higher priced corned beef and you won't be disappointed.

Wonderful glaze.  I cooked the corned beef in the crockpot for 8 hours on low.  (I did not even use the spice packet that came with it.)  I put the cooked beef in an oven proof pan and spread the glaze all over the top and bottom.  Then put under broiler for about 15 minutes, watching carefully.  It was a big hit with my family!!

This was great.  My whole family loved it.  I didn't have apricots so I used a jar of Orange marmalade and it worked great.  Will definitely make again.

This is a very good change to the traditional corned beef and cabbage.  Next time I think I will cook in crockpot with the spices from the packet and then finish up in the oven with the sauce.  I think corned beef is more tender when cooked in crockpot.  This was good, just not as tender.  The sauce is great and I think next time I will use peach in place of apricot.  Very good and will make again.

I bought a huge cut of corned beef last month and only made half because i was not sure if my family would like it due to the fact that we never had it before. I made it the way a friend told me to with cabbage and potatoes, my family hated it. So, I saw this recipe yesterday and tried it with the other half and oh my god, so delicious.  My family gobbled it up. They told me never use the other recipe again. The sauce on this is exceptional and simple, planning to try it on chicken.

This is a nice change to traditinal corn beef.  My kids like cornbeef and this gives me another option for serving.  We took the suggestion of baby carrots and tossed them into the dish once the glaze went on...terrific.

This recipe was SO FANTASTIC!  I was leary of baking a corned beef!  I had never made one before, and only ever had heard of them boiled.  In fact, I never really did like corned beef.  But, I bought the meat to try something different.  When my husband heard that I was making a corned beef for dinner he told me how he couldn't stand corned beef and disliked anything boiled.  I found this recipe, and tried it - not only was it so EASY to make, it was the hit dinner of the year!  No kidding!  Even my finicky 5 y.o. gobbled it up!  My husband, needless to say, ATE his WORDS!  He could not believe how much he enjoyed it!  The glaze adds such a good flavor to the meat!  Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this recipe, Melody!  It was the best! (and made me seem like a gourmet chef!) :-)

Tried this recipe and it's GREAT.  The few changes I made were - boiled the corned beef for a few hours before baking it (30 minutes) with the glaze & broiled it the last ten minutes.  I used sugar free jam and sweet & low brown sugar and it was still wonderful. Very little leftovers and they were gone the next day,  Much better than plain boiled.  Thanks alot for a new idea.

Delicious glaze!  I made the corned beef in the crockpot the night before, then reheated with the glaze at dinner time. Definely a keeper, don't think I'll do corned beef any other way!

Being Irish, I like to make corned beef on March 17 every year.  We usually make a corned beef and cabbage soup.  I found this recipe and thought it would be great.  As luck would have it, I was to have mouth surgery on the 18th, and wanted to make my last meal, so to speak, special.  with that, my sister was to watch the children while my husband took me out to dinner.  We made this recipe and set it on the stove, asking my sister to put it away when it was cooled.  Apparently, it was wonderful, because there was none left.  My sister, her fiance, and my 3 kids ate the whole thing.  I plan to make it again soon so I may see how wonderful it tastes.  It got rave reviews, and smelled outstanding.  I should have had some before we went out.

This recipe was amazing!  I used others reviews and cooked it in a crock pot all day (10 hours) on low.  I covered the meat in a wheat beer instead of using water.  It was truly amazing.  My family loved it and it was SO easy.  An easy crock pot meal that will be added to our list of favorites!

I have made this recipe multiple times and it has ALWAYS been well received.  I've even had people who claim to hate corned beef, love it.  The only thing I did differently was that I always boil my corned beef for 10-15 minutes prior to putting it in the oven. Otherwise I stick to the recipe.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I made it twice this week because it is so amazing and since the corned beef shrinks to such a small amount, I had to have more.

I boiled the corned beef in a pot on the stove with the packet of seasoning for 3 hours on medium low heat after the water boils.  I made the glaze according to the recipe. I smothered the corned beef with the glaze and cooked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and 3-4 minutes on broil.

Both my daughters and my friend raved about this recipe. I will be making it many more times...Thank you for it!!!

I have always received great compliments on this meal.  The other plus is it is super easy :0)  The only thing I did different is put it in my slow cooker on low for 5-6 hours before putting it in the oven.

I will cook corned beef like this again for sure. It turned out wonderful. I did not have apricot so I used red pepper jelly instead and it came out perfect. Juicy inside, slightly crunchy and sweet on the outside. Timing was right on for cooking with a 3.5 lb roast.

I made this on St Patricks day.  Since I work all day I placed in the slow cooker on low with 8 oz of water for about 9 hours.  I then placed in a baking pan put the glaze as directed on top and it was wonderful.  I will make this for St Patricks day every year and many times in between.  Very good flavor throughout.  My husband and I both agree that the outside where the glaze had been carmelized was the best part.  He was disappointed that there wasn't enough left over for him to take for his lunch.  I served with corn and Irish Potato Casserole.

Yummy! My family loved it.  I did as other reviews suggested and cooked it in water first.  I added the glaze and baked it while my cabbage and potatoes cooked in the water. Thanks!

Very awesome recipe.  I always look for short cuts though.  This is what I did.  Put corned beef and 1 bottle of beer in the crock pot the night before.  Take it out in the morning and let it cool and put in the refrigerator.  Trim fat off once it's cool and slice.  Put slices in a pan and slowly warm with some reserved broth and the glaze of course.

I was very reluctant to do this for my family, but everyone (old and young) LOVED IT!  Thanks :)  I thought it was great too.  I love corned beef and it was nice to have it changed up a bit.  For those who are weary...just give it a chance :) I did boil it first in a water beer mix because I was worried about it being dryed out in the oven, and then I baked it for about 30 min with the glaze.

This may be good for those that don't like traditional corned beef but for us it was unacceptable.

HOLY COW! This is Amazing! My Father-in-Law fell ill and sent this hunk of Corned Beef over for me to cook.  I am not fond of it at all and dreaded the thought of the usual Corned Beef meal.  I found this recipe and made up following Victoria Leigh's changes. I knocked it out of the park! Everyone loved it, including my Father-in-Law who does not give out food compliments easily.  I made this a week ago and he is still talking about how much he liked it. This is something I will actually plan to make again and again!

I'm a college student and wanted to make corned beef for my brothers on St. Patrick's Day while we were away from home. This was SPECTACULAR. The glaze really made this dish stand out. Not one bit of that thing was left at the end of the night, and it's now one of my standard recipes. Make sure to get flat-cut corned beef though--much easier to cut.

This was surprisingly good.  Next time I will do as others have suggested and cook first in the slow cooker and finish with the glaze in the oven.  I will make the glaze again with just the carrots - yummy!

Tried this recipe as written and we did not care for the soy sauce flavor. Made it again, this time I baked it with a bottle of apricot ale at 275 for 5 hours.(No spice pack) Removed from oven, drained, cut the fat away and added a apricot chutney to the meat and broiled for a minute, (will burn so watch carefully.) It was very moist and had a nice carmelized glaze.

Wow!!!  My husband has sworn for years that he HATES corned beef.  I was bound and determined to prove him wrong. This was the recipe that did it! I simmered for the CB for 1 hour with the seasonings and used all of the remaining water during the baking stage.   I was out of apricot, so used orange marmalade.  I doubled the sauce/marinade because I always like extra.  It was perfect.  Chopped up the few leftovers today, mixed with some mayo and made yummy sandwiches.  Thank you!

We didn't care for this recipe.  We live at an altitude of 6000 feet so I parboiled the corned beef first for half an hour (it takes longer to cook at such a high altitude.)  Then I followed directions exactly.  The meat was very tough and I just prefer using mustard on good old boiled corned beef. The sauce would be good on any poultry dish though.

Can't get any easier than this!  I boiled the corned beef (without the spice packet) for 2 1/2 hrs first...then just mix up the glaze and bake as directed!  Very tender and tasty.

I loved this, but my husband (who doesn't like corned beef that much) thought it was ok.  The marinade got a little overdone, however.  Keep an eye on it.

First and foremost... The better the cut of meat the better this recipe.  This was very simple to make but tasted absolutely great! I've never tasted corned beef so good!  The only thing I did different was to boil the corned beef for half and hour before putting in the oven.  The meat wasn't salty and it was VERY tender. The sauce was really tasty and we gobbled up every bite. Best corned beef I've ever had.

This recipe was wonderful ~ the only thing I did different is I cooked the beef in a dutch oven inside the oven with potatoes, carrots and onions.   After three hours, I removed it and put in a separate baking dish with this glaze over it and cooked for another 45 minutes ~ it was great!

I'm writing this review because most of the reviews I read didn't follow the directions for the recipe.  They boiled, slow cooked or crock potted their meat.  The recipe says to bake the meat.  I did this, and I will never boil the meat again.  It turned out tender and delicious and sliced beautifully without falling apart.  I lined the pan with heavy duty foil and completely sealed the meat and water in the foil.  My husband said it was the best corned beef he ever had!

I made this tonight! I followed another reviewers advice and cooked my corned beef in the crock pot all day. then made the glaze and took the next out it's the crock pot and baked it in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. I also decided, since I was changing the normal corned beef, to change the rest of the meal. Instead of boiled potatoes, I made mashed potatoes. instead of boiled cabbage, I made a refreshing come slaw, with two cookies of cabbage, shredded carrots, craisens, cooked apples and sales peanuts.

The sweet glaze against the saltiness of the corned beef was delicious.  My husband and I really enjoyed it!  Typically, I go with the Guinness glaze/onions, etc, but I think I like this better.  It's faster to prepare too.  As most of the other reviewers recommend, I did modify the cooking method, and it turned out perfectly!  I cooked in a crock pot with the seasoning packet and a cup of water for 8 hours.  That evening, I glazed it and put it in the oven for 25min at 350. It was the perfect consistency. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is my go to recipe for corned beef. Everyone that tried it raves that it is the best they had. Sometimes I bake it in the oven at a lower temp longer because of work. One of my favorite recipes ever!

I had never thought of cooking corned beef and cabbage this way and won't got back. I had a semi-used jar of jalapeno jelly left and used that instead and worked out well. I also used the idea of baking the carrots and glazed corned beef together in a small amount of water, which I added back into the vegetables. The process made the glaze caramelize very well. Never go back to boiled corned beef!

Great recipe - what a delightful surprise!  My husband likes appricots but I do not, but thought I would try this for him - we both totally liked it!  I cooked the meat and sauce separately, reducing the apricot preserve to by about half, and added a bit of prepared mustard.  Will definitely try the sauce again, next time with pork, adding a bit extra mustard to make it more tangy.

I'm not fond of the typical corned beef & cabbage and came across this recipe.  I cooked the corned beef for 4 hours on high in the crockpot according to package directions.  I then transferred the corned beef to a baking dish and poured some of the juice from the crockpot into the baking dish.  To be honest..when I was preparing the glaze I was skeptical.  I couldn't find apricot preserves at the store I shopped at and used peach preserves instead.  I cooked in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes basting the corned beef half way thru.  THIS WAS AMAZING!!  Not too sweet and not too salty!!

Best corned beef recipe I have had.  I followed some of the other reviewers and cooked in in the crock pot on low for 8 hours and then continued with the recipe.   Added carrots and they were delicious also with the glaze.

I'm a Japanese who is living with an Irish American boyfriend. He has eaten Irish food since he can remember and he told me that this recipe is the best he ever had. It was easy to make, meat was so tender, and we loved it so much. I want to make this again just because. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was good but I have a different glaze recipe that I have used for years and made a batch of corned beef with this glaze and one with the one I usually make. All 5 of us that ate it liked my usual recipe better.

This has become a saint Patricks day tradition for our family. I make it every year and the only change I make is replacing water for Guinness. Excellent!!

We will never have corned beef and cabbage again.  Did not have apricot so we used peach preserves.  Fabulous.

Its all in the glaze. Like most I soaked it low and slow. Then pulled it out, let it sit a bit. Back in the oven with the glaze. At first it looked like I had too much glaze, puddle on top. So I knocked that down. This was very very good. The glaze didn't overcome the meat, but went together amazingly well.

Great corned beef recipe.  I too boiled the beef according to package directions along with the spice packet.  Took others suggestions to remove excess fat, apply glaze, and bake for 30 min.  Family loved it, especially 17 yr. old son who couldn't stop eating it.

The only modification I made was to boil the CB first. My husband couldn't imagine eating corned beef any way other than between two pieces of bread - he was thoroughly impressed with this recipe!

Maybe my corned beef was less than 4.5 lbs, but this recipe is WAY TOO SWEET!  Next time I will try using half the glaze recipe.  The beef was tender and delicious, but the glaze completely drowned the flavor of the corned beef-reminded me of candied sweet potatoes. I will try this again.  Every recipe I try from allrecipes is great!

Great St. Patty's Day corned beef. I don't make this very often, but it is the perfect twist on corned beef. I halfed the glaze and I accidentally put the glaze on before cooking for two hours and it was still good. Great with sauerkraut!! Next time I will make as directed, the glaze was delish.

My family really liked this...I just thought it was OK. I think I would prefer the glaze on pork or some other cut of beef. Just didn't go with the corned beef for me. I did boil it first to tenderize and then put it in the oven for 30 minutes.

This was excellent.  The glaze added the perfect amount of sweetness to compliment the saltiness of the corned beef.  I sliced the corned beef fairly thin and the drizzled the meat with the pan drippings and some of the leftover glaze.  The meat was nice and tender and the glaze gave the dish a lovely glossy sheen.  I only cooked a 3 1/2 lb. corned beef so I did have quite a bit extra glaze... probably would have been fine with only half the amount of glaze.  I will definately make this again!

I have made this every year for our St. Patrick's dinner party we have with my family, because of the rave reviews it got the first time I made it.  Even those that say that they don't care for corned beef can't get enough of this because of it's sweetness and the glaze makes it so tender and yummy!  Even reheats well!

I have made this twice in the past several months to rave reviews both times (caught my boyfriend bragging to his mother about it *smile*. The house is filled with such a wonderful aroma when guests arive, and they are so pleased with the flavor that matches. Just a perfect dish without any changes; or if you prefer, add a heavy, dark beer instead of liquid when cooking. Either way, you will not be disappointed. This is now the ONLY corned beef recipe I use. Thank you for posting.

WOW! Simply the BEST corned beef recipe I have ever made.  I followed the recipe with one exception, I added a can of beer in with the water and spice packet. I cooked it in my cast iron dutch oven for 3 hours with the lid on.  I removed the lid, poured the entire sauce over the corned beef and added 1/4 cup of the broth to the bottom of the pan.  I cooked it uncovered for 30 more minutes. It had a very nice glaze and didn't need to be put under the broiler. It was tender and very moist.  I let it rest for 10 minutes and it sliced beautifully. My husband devoured it.  This will be my "go to" recipe this winter when I'm craving corned beef.  Very, very good!!

"Fantastic" I cooked 25 lbs.  I used the flavor packets that come with the meat and did a rub with 2c water on the botten of pan. cooked it in roaster for 5 1/2 hours took the juice poured over meat then removed all the liquid from the pan. let cook for another 1 1/2 hr then added apricot preserves w/ just enough drippings to make it pourable... applied to all the meat. Cookerd for another 2 hrs and repeated the process with the glazing.. draining the liquid.    remove and place in over on 500 for 20min  Ymmmm perfect!

This recipe is the best corned beef I have ever had.  I made three briskets for my friends on St Pattys Day (all of whom said they didn't like corned beef)all three briskets were gone in 20 minutes.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  This has become a staple in my house. Thank you.

This is the new corned beef recipe for our household! My husband is not a big fan of corned beef but endures it once a year on St.Patrick's day.  He really liked this recipe and suggested we could eat corned beef more often if we make it this way!  I took the advice of other users and boiled a 2.5 lb for 2 hours and then glazed it and baked it for 1/2 hour more.  Yummy!!

I'm sorry, but we didn't like this at all.  The glaze was way too sweet for our tastes and we couldn't even eat it, so ended up scrambling for something else for dinner...and we are big sweet eaters, so that says a lot.  I think it has too much apricot, since that's about all we tasted, super sweet apricot on top of meat.  It just didn't work for me.

Fantastic!! I don't make corned beef that often because my husband doesn't much care for it,but he loved it. He ate a huge portion and then finished mine! Didn't change a thing and have a lot of glaze left over to use on chicken.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Fixed this for St. Patrick's day - wow! I had never eaten, much less cooked corned beef before, but it turned out really good. Started the corned beef in the crock pot with the spice pack on high for about 3 hours. Then transferred to the oven for glazing (I used peach preserves instead), along with baby carrots. Everyone really liked it!

I just made this for my family a day before Easter and Wow! Nothing went back to the fridge! I boiled like it said to on the package and then put the glaze on and poped it in the oven. Very tender and very delish!

I got rave reviews from my guests on St. Patrick's Day. My husband cannot stand the smell of boiled cabbage so I was searching for an alternative cooking method this year. I pre-boiled my potatoes and carrots and then added them with cabbage when it was time to add the glaze. My cabbage steamed nicely, and there was no smell this year. Hooray!

I'd never even heard of glazing corned beef, but this is the second time I made this recipe and the glazed corned beef is again, all gone this morning. Used to only make corned beef (reluctantly) for St. Pattys, but this recipe is a keeper.  Makes me a believer in Corned beef.

This is by far the best corned beef recipe.  The mellow sweetness of the glaze compiments the corned beef like no other.  My wife is a picky eater and does not care much for corned beef even loved it!  A+

I only cooked this for 2 hours.  Any longer and we wouldn't have been able to eat it.
However, I will never make corned beef without the glaze again.  Amazing flavor!

this was a very delicious glaze. The best part was how EASY it is to make. I did boil my corned beef first for 3 1/2 hours.  YUM!

First I have to say that this glaze was wonderful, and will be the ONLY thing I take from this recipe. We did not care for the way that the corned beef turned out, I followed the recipe completely.  We are lucky that this St. Patty's day we bought two briskets the other is working its magic in the crock pot so thankfully there is a silver lining. I cannot recommend this recipe for baking a brisket, however I can recomend the glaze that seems me and my family just wonderful. sorry

Awesome flavor!  This is the first time I've made corn beef.  I started out this morning deciding that I'd just boil it.  To kill time I searched this site and found this recipe. I decided to make the glaze, except I wanted it thicker, so I only used about 1/4 water.  After it had boiled for about two hours, I removed it from the pot, placed it in a shallow roasting pan on a rack, glazed the meat on both sides, added 2 cups of cooking liquid to the bottom of the pan, covered it and baked for about 45 minutes.  I didn't need to place under the boiler, because the thicker sauce carmelized on it's own!!  My hubby loved it and I can't wait to have it topped with cole slaw in a sandwich!

This recipe is wonderful.  I dont understand why people are boiling it first without just following the recipe.  There is no need to boil.  It is great with grilled cabbage....cut cabbage into wedges, put on sheet of foil, coat with butter and pour on some vinegar.  Double wrap tightly and grill for about half an hour turning a few times.  Delish!!

Very good corn beef, my family loved the glaze. I'll be fixing corn beef this way for now on. I did as some others, and that was to boil it first, next time I would like to just bake it. Thanks for the great recipe.

I've used this recipe for a couple years now, but I've never rated it. I made it tonight and fell in love all over again, absolutely delicious. I don't think I'll ever prepare corned beef any other way.

This was by far the best corned beef I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly-the meat was moist and tender, the sauce was delicious.  We will definitely be making this again next year.  Goodbye boiled corned beef!

Yummy! We served this for St. Patty's Day dinner last night for a party of 12 (two roasts), and there wasn't a crumb left on the platter. My Irish friend said it was the best he ever had. The only change my husband (a chef) made was to add some whole grain prepared mustard.

This is by far the best corned beef I and the rest of my family have ever tasted with sauteed cabbage or as reuben sandwiches.  I cut up cabbage (like coleslaw) and sauteed it in some butter to serve with the dish and it was incredible.

I may have been lucky and gotten an exceptional piece of corned beef, but this was by far the best I have ever eaten. Veggies needed more cooking time, needed about 1-1/2 hour.   Eat with horseradish sauce or a good mustard.  Great recipe!!

I have never been a Corn Beef fan.  To date I  have always had the boiled version.  This by far was superior and I plan to make this for years to come.  My husband raved about it as well!!!  Simple to make and meat was very tender...

I thought this was a great recipe.  I made it for St. Patrick's Day last year and my very Irish in-laws loved it.  It was very tender with a great amount of flavor, not your typical boiled corned beef!

This is my second brisket in a month. The first one was out of this world, my second one I think is even yummier if that's possible. I didn't have a cup of apricot preserves so I got a half a cup of apricot and I used a half a cup of pineapple Reserves and it was yummy.

Great sauce recipe.  I prefer to use sous vide for the corned beef, and finish it with the sauce in the oven for 25 minutes at 350.

This recipe was very very good, very simple and basically took care of itself.  It was too sweet for myself so I took off some of the upper crust, but everybody else devoured it!  It was served alongside sauteed cabbage and carrots in a creamed tangy sauce that worked out well. *** If you use foil to cover it while baking, be sure to place a piece of baking paper on top of the meat before covering with foil. If not you'll take it out of the oven with bits of aluminum specks baked into the top of the roast.  It happened and was quite unsightly.

I only modified this slightly in making it for more people (70) so I used increased portions on everything, but didn't change the overall ratios. Also, I used roasters in lieu of an oven and lined the bottom with parchment paper before glazing so it wouldn't stick. This was tender and sweet and my seniors loved it!

This is the only way to do corned beef. A touch of hot mustard (@ 1 T) in the glaze is nice.

Wow delicious! I used peach preserves instead. Cooked on high in slow cooker 3 hrs. Scored brisket thru fat about 1/8" into meat rubbed glaze into score marks and all over brisket and placed in oven 350 degrees 30 min. Turned out amazing. 
Next time going to use this recipe and make a pulled corned beef with that glaze. Shred it up. Place on Hawaiian rolls and top with coleslaw.

I have been using this recipe for years and just love it.  Even people who don’t like corn beef much really like this recipe.   I do soak the meat in water and rinse twice to help remove the overwhelming salty nature of the corn beef. This can be done in oven or crock pot.  The best ever.

I boiled the corned beef on the stove for about 3 hours and then added the glaze (after dumping the nasty water) and baked it following thee directions. The best corned beef ever!

5 stars for the glaze, simple and delicious. I scored the fat side then seared both sides in my cast iron pan, then added water and the lid and cooked for 3 hours in the oven before adding glaze for another 30 minutes.

Made this by first slow cooking it in the oven with equal parts beer and water. Then drained and added the glaze. Glaze is wonderful. We don't like too much salt, so instead of soy sauce I used 1/4 cup of Cointreau. Works great with the apricot preserves. Husband loved it and declared it a keeper!

Awesome recipe!!! The only change I made was I used more than a cup of water.  I put enough water in to cover over half of the corned beef.  Then put foil on and baked.  Followed the rest of the recipe as posted.  It was delicious.  I made two briskets for 4 people and only a few slices left.  Will make it again.

Suggestion: rinse beef well and put it in the crock on low with water/beer to cover and the pickling seasonings (I don't use the packet w/ extra peppercorns) for about 8 hours. Then  make the glaze and transfer the beef  to a foil covered broiling pan, spread the glaze on top and baked uncovered for 30 mins @ 450. Use liquid to boil veggies until tender. I served it with boiled celery, carrots, cabbage, and quartered red potatoes.

I just made this recipe and wow! Super easy and just about anyone and everyone can make this. The marinade brings out the sweet taste and helps blend the corn beef in with the cabbage I added. Probably will make this throughout the year.

I made this last year, and as written it's delicious but, like others, found it to be tough -  undercooked -  for a 4-1/2 lb corned beef. There's got to be at least 50 min per pound to get the beef to the point that the connective tissue in the meat breaks down enough to give you a tender corned beef. By the way, I added a touch of horseradish to the glaze for a "bite" when I made it in the fall, and it is ah-may-zing. THIS St. Patrick's Day, I cooked the corned beef in a 375 degree oven with enough water to over it halfway, wrapped the pan tightly in foil and baked it for 4 hrs. I poured off the "broth" over a pan full of about a dozen small red potatoes, ten carrots cut into thirds and a cabbage cut into 8 wedges and put that on to boil (then simmer) for an hour. The corned beef went onto a pile of onions in a baking pan and was coated thickly with apricot preserves, Heinz 57 sauce and a touch of horseradish and baked for an hour. Perfectly glazed, perfectly tender and SO delicious. I really like the baked corned beef over a boiled hunk of meat. Thanks so much for the recipe!

We have used this recipe several times over the last couple of years, with the only change being the frequent use of orange marmalade rather than apricot because that's what we had on hand.  Today, my DH is cooking, & says the cook times don't add up.  Anyone else notice this?  I have always done the water bake for 2 hours, & the glaze for 30 mins cover the uncovered.  Am I wrong?  Thank you!

I started using this recipe a few years ago and it is the only way I make corned beef.  I cut the glaze recipe in half.  I also combine the glaze ingredients and microwave 1 minute to blend ahead of time.  I then let it sit while the beef cooks.  This makes basting very easy. Once basted, I cook 15 minutes with foil on and 15 minutes with foil off to avoid drying out.  Delish!!!!

We had this for dinner tonight. We will never boil another corned beef ever. This is delicious. My guys kept coming back for more. I used beef broth instead of water. After one hour I opened it and added a whole cabbage cut in chunks and I removed a little broth to use on roast potatoes in another roasting dish. After the second hour I removed the cabbage when I drained the meat and added the glaze. The meat was perfect. The guys loved the glaze.  A keeper.

Made this recipe today for st. Patty's day and loved it ! Only change I made was to substitute mustard for the soy sauce . I was concerned it would be too salty with the soy. I added the carrots right in for the last 1/2 hour and they came out perfect . Definite 5 star recipe !

Best corned beef I've tasted! We always have corned beef on New Year's Day, even though it isn't my favorite. I will be using this recipe from now on! I did boil the brisket first, then glazed in the oven. Perfection!

This was really good. My family is very picky eaters so it always makes it hard trying to find something new for dinner. We all loved it and will be making the corned beef this way for  now on. I did however, read the other reviews and boiled my corned beef on the stove top until it was done, patted it dry, put it in the baking dish, added the glaze to the top of it, and put it in the over at 250 degrees F for 30 minutes. It was great, thanks for the recipe!

It was like a candy coating on meat....  Maybe the corned beef shrunk too much, or wasn't a big enough piece to start with, but there was waayyy  to much glaze and it formed a candy coating.  I'll try it again, but in a smaller quantity.

Absolutely delicious recipe! I am not usually a fan of corned beef, but this was so easy and extremely tasty! In New Zealand we would normally boil this meat, but roasting it was so much easier. Didnt change a thing! Thanks so much for this recipe.

My family loved this dished that was served tonight. There was no leftover infact I did not cooked enough. No changes to the recipe at all. After reading the reviews I did cook the beef in the slow cooker first then transfered to over towards the end of the cooking time. This is a keeping for year round.

This was so easy and delicious.. I baked covered in the oven for a couple hours before glazing, then just slow cooked for a couple more hours - basting every 20mins or so.  To add a kick to the glaze, I added some deli mustard and a few drops of "pickapeppa" sauce (this is a hot sauce made with mango) - so yummy!!  Glad my husband was late for dinner - forced me to slow cook everything and I think it made it better!

i tried this recipe and my husband who really doesn't care for corn beef loved it!! However, I had to adjust the cooking time it was nowhere near done in the amount of time stated, plus after draining i had to add some water in the bottom because the glaze started burning

Absolutely LOVE this recipe. However I slow cook my corned beef for quite some time, roughly 4-6 hours, to make it very nice and tender.  Then I pour the glaze on top and add some carrots and bake for an additional 30 minutes. Comes out perfect everytime and my boyfriend just can't get enough of it!

Wanted to try something a little different from my usual crockpot corned beef.  Following some of the suggestions of previous reviewers, I cooked the 4 1/12 beef in the crockpot on low for 7 hours using the seasoning pack. Then baked it 30 minutes with the glaze. It came out very soft, pretty salty though and the glaze was OK.   Alot and a little too sweet for my taste.  Would definately make again however only use only 1/2 seasoning pack.  I would use 2/3 of recipe for the glaze and might throw in a pinch of cayenned or a little more soy. I forgot to put it under the broiler the last few minutes as someone suggested. This would have made a big difference as it wasnt fabulously "glazed", just a lot of sauce.

Great and easy recipe.  I had a can of apricots, but I didn't have the apricot preserves, so I took out half a can and mashed them up.  Added all the other ingredients.  This recipe still turned out great.  My hubbie loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

When I first saw this recipe, I thought it sounded horrible.  After tiring of the same old corned beef though, I decided to give it a try.  Am I ever glad I did (and so is my family).  I took other's suggestion of boiling with the spice packet, and then baking with the glaze.  It was incredible.  My teenage neice hates boiled corned beef because of the texture of the meat and the gelatinous fat and such...but she ate seconds of this.  Kudos Melody!

Very tasty recipe. A nice change from the traditional cabbage, or even plain. Meat came out tender and juicy - I will make it again.

This was good. I took other reviewers' advice and cooked it in the crock pot with 1 cup of water and the seasoning packet for 7 hours then baked it in the oven for a half hour with the glaze.  It was ok. I think it would have been better without the seasoning packet. The meat was very tender and the glaze was excellent. Even without the packet, I think it still would have gotten 4 stars. Its good but not something special.

I never knew any other way to cook corned beef until now.  Thanks so much.  It was wonderful!  My husband and kids liked it too and they usually complain when I make corned beef.  I didn't boil it first, just cooked it a little longer.

Excellent Recipe!!!  We just loved the glaze!  We had 3 1/2 lb corned beef - boiled it for about 2 hours on med heat.  Then glazed and baked for about 1/2 hour.  Served with cabbage,carrots and potatoes (also boiled in the stock)  YUMMY!!!!!

This recipe was great.  First, it looks alot more appetizing than a traditional corned beef.  The taste is really good, and the apricot glaze gets more subtle as it cooks.  I took advice of others and boiled first for 3 hours (4.5 lb) and then glazed and baked for 30 minutes.  I then used the broth to cook cabbage, carrots and potatoes.  I will try baking it the whole way next time (without company coming!).

This was pretty good.  I usually make a beef brisket with a similar recipe, so it came out kind of like that.  Except, it tastes better with beef brisket.  But, since I had the corned beef, I'm glad I made it this way.  Was a lot better than boiled!

Never could make decent corned beef until I tried this recipe.  The meat was fork tender and the glaze was a delicious complement to the dish.

This is a winner!  We tried it over the weekend, using the outdoor grill.  We found the cooking time is a lot less (about half the time) and we had to keep adding water (an additional 2 cups) to the pan.  About 45 minutes into the cooking, we moved it directly to the grill and seared the glazed corned beef on both sides.  Then we returned it to the pan, added more water and continued cooking. Very tasty and super easy!

This was the BEST Corned Beef I've ever had.  So much tastier than the old traditional boiled type.  I made with JoelsGirl Irish Heritage Cabbage and HERB-OX's Red-Skinned Garlic Mashed Potatoes...was a real hit with the family!

Tried this recipe for St. Patrick's Day.  Very good and loved the apricot flavor.  I passed this recipe on to several people I work with.  Some of them tried it and loved to. Thank you for a great recipe!!

The corned beef was tender.  This reciped required little work and the result was sweeter and less salty than the original.
