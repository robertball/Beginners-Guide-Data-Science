I didn't have Smucker's Strawberry Syrup but I did have a blueberry syrup that I used instead. I also used chunky peanut butter. Both my kids and I really liked this, though I thought it could have done without the cream cheese and been okay. I served this with homemade orange julius and we all ate and were happy. NOTE: I used clearanced- out texas toast. Worked just fine.

Great recipe and a nice twist on PB&J! Plus, I love french toast and this was an easy and delicious new way to prepare it. All I added was a little vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mixture. I used Smucker's low sugar strawberry preserves vs. the strawberry fruit syrup, and I think you can use just about any of your favorite preserves for this and it'll taste great! I opted out of the cream cheese as I thought it would be just a bit much as well as the additional preserves and whipped cream. When they were nice and crispy I dusted these with powdered sugar - a really nice treat for breakfast!

I made this with home made bread (Vanilla Spice Bread from this site, which is my favorite french toast bread) and reduced fat cream cheese.  To the eggs and milk I added cinnamon and a splash of vanilla.  I don't care for bananas, so I left them out on mine, but my husband liked the addition of it on his.  This stuffed french toast was very filling and one was more than enough for each of us.
