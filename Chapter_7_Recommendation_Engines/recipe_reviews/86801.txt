My husband is very picky about his steaks...we both LOVED THIS MARINADE just as it is instructed to make! I was confused by the ingredient "steak seasoning" I used a dry steak seasoning similar to Montreal steak seasoning. I think whatever you use, dry or wet it will work just fine. I have now made this marinade about 5 times on different types of steaks, it is ALWAYS VERY GOOD. We like the fact that it enhances the steaks without overpowering the natural yummy flavor. This is an awesome exact as is recipe! DO TRY!

Excellent! I made this tonight for my husband and it came out so juicy.  I seared the NY strip 3 minutes on each side and then lowered the temp. to low and cooked it for another 3 minutes.

This is a good Grilled NY Strip, not BBQ.  BBQ and grilling are two separate and quite distinct forms of cooking: you grill over direct heat, and BBQ low and slow, using indirect heat.

I generally don't like marinades (especially the teriyaki variety) but I try them occasionally when my wife makes me.  This marinade is one of the few I thought was pretty good. It enhanced the meat flavor rather than overwhelming or masking it.  The measurements of each of the ingredients were spot on, creating a nicely balanced marinade.  I can't believe I'm saying this, because I'm a real purist when it comes to my steaks, but I'd actually make this again.

When I lived in Florida, I would buy a slab of NY Strip at the local Penn-Dutch store and have Mike the butcher, slice it into 2" thick steaks. I just rubbed them with Montreal Steak  Seasoning and let them sit for about an hour, that is until they reached room temperature. On they go to the charcoal fired BBQ at HIGH heat. On for three minutes, and rotate 90 degrees, for another three minutes (rotating is done to get the perfect criss-cross grill marking,) then flip for four minutes, rotate 90 degrees again and finish cooking a final four minutes. The total elapsed time on the grill is fourteen minutes! Once you have done it this way, ordering steak in a restaurant or even a steak house will be a disappointment. Serve with baked potato, asparagus red wine and a green salad.

Great steak marinade! I used McCormick's Grill Mates instead of steak seasoning and it came out very tender and flavorful.

This is absolutley fanastic, the best steaks I ever made at home, even better than the local steak houses!  I used light olive oil and Head Country Seasoning for the steak seasoning called for.  If you don't have Head Country seasoning, get some, you won't be dissapointed.

Very tender and juicy.  The only change I made was to use McCormick's Grill Mates for the steak seasoning.  Turned out great!

This was fantastic and super easy. I didn't change a thing as far as ingredients. However, I saved the marinade and boil it on the stove then let it simmer while the steaks cooked. It's safe to boil marinade and use it as a sauce, which I did and the flavor of the marinade/sauce over the steak was great. Very happy to have found this recipe.

BBQ NY Strip Haiku: "This was too salty. But otherwise, a good steak. I would make again." Husband requested steak and asparagus for Father's Day, so I chose this recipe, as I got some strip steaks on sale, and these are ingredients almost always on hand. I was a little nervous about using that much steak seasoning, as I'm guessing that's why the salty factor was out of control, but he obliterated his plate (fat included *gag!*) so we'll settle for 4 stars, as it was a flavorful, easy marinade that made for a tasty, grilled dinner. (Oh and sauteed baby bella mushrooms and onions smothering the top was another tasty addition.)

My whole family LOVED this, I used "montreal steak seasoning" and was nervous about the amount of Worcestershire but it was SO good.  Marinaded about 5 hours.

I am one of the pickiest steak eaters ever.  A true steak should be grilled with salt and pepper to allow the flavor of the meat to shine through.  However, this marinade was quite good.  It didn't mask the essence of the steak, but rather enhanced it for a different experience.  For a change of pace, I'd use this marinade again.  Thank you for the submission Russ4433.

Unbelivable!!! We bought two complete strips from our local super market ($300) and frankly we were dissapointed.  They were though and flavorless. This recipe saved the day. The strips were tender and very flavorfull. I was sure all those seasonings would  overpower the meat, but, wow, these were fantastic. We marinated for about 24 hours and we did double the recipe for the four strips we did so that they would all be submerged. The marinade seems to bring out the true flavor of the meat. Can't wait to try it on pork and chicken. I wouldn't change a thing. This has saved an otherwise inferior cut of meat. Thanks !!!

It was very flavorful and everyone in the family said they loved it and to make it again! Definitely important to get that good sear on the meat, following this recipe to the tee, and it is perfect :)

This was excellent. I wish I had all the ingredients, but made a few modifications. I used balsamic vinegar because that is what I had in my pantry. I also used liquid dressing because that was all I had. Also because I did not have a grill I put about 4 to 5 dashes of liquid smoke into the marinade. I seasoned the steaks before putting them in the bag with garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and steak seasoning. Also cajun seasoning for an added kick. I seared it on the stove top for 2 mins on each side. Then topped it with provolone cheese (but would recommend grogonzola)and put it in the oven for about 4 to 7 minutes. Took it out, let it rest, and topped the whole thing with sauteed mushrooms and onions. It was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!!

Now, this was yummy!  We all (my 11 yr old son, neighbor, and myself) gobbled it up with roasted potatoes and asparagus!  I didn't do it on the grill b/c it was rainy and windy and cold, but I broiled it on high-10 minutes on the first side and about 6 minutes on the second.  PERFECT!

Fabulous recipe.  This marinade had a wondeful flavor that all enjoyed.  I was worried about the amount of steak seasoning the recipe called for and almost reduced it, but I am so glad I didn't!  I will definitely use this recipe again many times!  Thank you!

I don't normally marinate a good cut of beef like a NY strip, but I had purchased a couple of "select" rather than my usual "choice" - so I thought they might need a little help. This was a delicious marinade.  I did add about 2 tsp. of fresh lemon juice and whole peppercorns, because when I took a taste of the marinade it was a bit too salty - probably due to the sodium content of the Worcestershire & Montreal steak seasoning. The lemon juice cut the saltiness, and the results were perfect. I marinated for 3 cycles in my foodsaver and yum!

This is amazing.  No changes are needed.  We don't eat steak without marinating anymore - it's just not the same.  I'll agree with other's reviews - this marinade doesn't mask the steak flavour - it really makes the steak!

This marinade is yummy.  It works even on tough cuts you just have to let it sit longer.  We really enjoy it.  I marinate and use the George Forman grill for indoor grilling. Delish!

FABULOUS! My husband and I have eaten in some of the best steakhouses in the country and this was better than just about all of them!!! WOW! I used Emeril's Steak Seasoning which I think is better than Montreal & increased the marinating time to about 5 hours and we just couldn't stop raving.  This is our go-to guest dish from now on - thank you!

This was very simple to make and gave the steak a nice subtle flavour. I followed other users tips and halved the Worcestershire sauce. Didn't add the basil or red wine vinegar either so maybe the taste would have been stronger if I did. Not a garlic person so put in equivalent of four cloves only too.

Wow what a yummy recipe.  I did a 3 lb boneless blade roast.  I cut the marinade in half.  The meat ended up marinating for 3 days before I roasted with a trivet of veggies.  The meat was tender and full of great flavours.  LOL so good that the 4 of us went through the whole roast.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I was so skeptical of this being over-spiced and too herb-y. Wow was I wrong. This was AMAZING. My husband was raving about it. I only had a hour until dinner so I trimmed off the bone and fat lining, pounded it 1/2 inch flat, and forked it to let the marinade seep in. Ziploc bagged it on the counter of an hour then seared it off and cooked a min on each side. PERFECT.

This recipe was delicious!  I will definitely use it again.  I will use a different steak seasoning though, as the one I had had a bit too much pepper for me.

This is one great steak marinade, especially when using a really nice cut like a NY strip or ribeyes as I did.  Really enhances the flavor without masking it.  I halved the recipe for two steaks, and made exactly as written ( I used Emeril's Essence for steak seasoning)with the exception of adding some onion powder.  Tasted before marinating, and a little oily for me, in need of more acid, so I added a nice splash of sherry (everything tastes better with sherry in my book!).  Marinated a little over 8 hours.  Just delicious.  A definite do-over and keeper.  Thanks for sharing with AR!

Sounds good, but if I did a 8 oz steak for 7 min a side I'd have a pc of charcoal. But I like the mix

Best New York Strip I have ever had! I unfortunately had to postpone grilling for another day, needless to say the steak marinated for over 24 hours. It was undeniably the best tasting steak I ever had! If I might add, dont close lid on grill, tends to get too hot and steak catches on fire!

Delicious.  I marinaded it for 2-3 days and broiled it for 9 minutes on each side.  Juicy, flavorful, and a delight for my dinner party.

This was an excellent recipe. And for the reviewer who corrected her terminolgy (bbq vs grilling), the use language is cultural so I'm sure she understands the difference.

Excellent!  My husband doesn't eat red meat (other than venison) so I made this for myself and made him the Grilled Sea Bass from the site... both were excellent. I agree with the previous poster, the smell of it cooking was awesome!

this recipe made some of the best steaks I have ever had.  My boyfriend is a steak lover and even he thought these were better than some restaurant steaks.  I have made them more than once and I defenitely reccomend marinading over night, 3 hours made the good but overnight made them super tender.

This is very good and tasty.  I did marinate overnight.  The first time I used A-1 sauce and then I used Montreal steak seasoning the next time, both were excellent!

I have to agree, this is a really great recipe. I use Lawrys for steak seasoning and pomegranate red wine vinegar. Use a meat thermostat when grilling for a perfect steak; I love mine to be just medium, super juicy!

This was the most amazing steak I have ever had! This is 10 billion times better than the "Best Steak Marinade in Existence" on this site. I marinated it for about 6 hours and used Montreal steak seasoning. Thank you so, so much for this recipe!

This marinade totally rocks!  I used it with Ribeye steaks, because that's what I had in the freezer.  I didn't change a thing as far as the recipe is written.   I used the Weber brand Chicago Steak seasoning for the steak seasoning.  Regardless, this recipe is awesome.  It lends a great flavor to the meat, without over powering the beefy taste of the steak.

I thought that this was an excellent marinade but my mother didn't like the worcestershire. I guess that's just a matter of taste though. So, if you don't care for that then leave it out or go for another recipe.

VERY GOOD!  Made this for a one pound NY strip steak that Hubs and I split for dinner last night.  It has a nice, subtle flavor that doesn't overpower the wonderful flavor of the meat.  I did find the amount of marinade to be excessive.  I only made 1/4 of the marinade and it seemed to be ample for our one pound of meat.  Why throw away those expensive ingredients?

Delicious!! I was scared to put so much steak seasoning in because I thought it was going to be way too salty, but after 3 hours of marinading, it tasted great. Very tender without being too salty at all.

OMG!  This was the best steak I have ever made.  I let it marinade for about 3-4 hrs and the flavor was enormous.  Next time I make it I am def making extra so as to have leftovers.

Way too much Worcestershire sauce.  That flavor overpowered all others.  If I make this again I'll probably cut that measurement down to 1-1/2 Tbsps at most.  However, the steak was tender and juicy.

This was amazing! My husband said it was the best steak he ever had and I would have to agree! I served this with sauteed brussel sprouts and shitake mushrooms in butter, olive oil and garlic as well as baked potato with butter and plain greek yogurt (I was out of sour cream) which was delicious! Our meal tasted like it was straight from a gourmet steakhouse...definity on one of my top favorites!!!

pretty tasty, I did not know what "steak seasoning" to use as I usually Montreal Steak Spice, but I thought that might be to salty due to the Worcestershire, so I used Epicure's Montreal's Steak Rub. It was a pretty tasty marinade, would make again.

I have never written a review before but felt compelled to do so after my husband took a bite and declared it the best steak he had ever tried.  Absolutely perfect as is!

Made this just as the recipe states.  The steaks came out perfect.  Wonderful flavor and so tender.  This will now be our go to marinade.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is a good marinade that adds a nice flavor to the meat, but doesn't overpower it.  It can vary a lot since it doesn't specify what 'steak seasoning' to use though.  I used Emeril's steak seasoning.  I will certainly make this again.  It's easy and tasty.

Fantastic steak! I've been known to tweak a recipe now and then, but this is one great marinade just as it is. I marinated for almost 24 hours and it was melt in your mouth flavorful!

This is a wonderful marinade for steak.  The flavor is outstanding.  I love steak plain usually but tried this and the family and our guests loved it.  It was in the marinade for about 5 hours and that was plenty.  Also left them at room temperature before grilling for 30 minutes.  So yummy!!

This was great! I don't eat a lot of red meat but gave this a shot and it was delicious.  I didn't have Worch. sauce so used soy instead and it worked out.  I didn't measure exactly, just eye-balled it. I don't think you can go too wrong with this.  It's a keeper!!

Best marinade ever! I used white wine instead of the red wine vinegar (thats all I had) and omitted the basil and Italian seasoning (didnt sould like they would be a good match with steak). This made the tastiest steak ever - no need for any more spices or a sauce. I used Mc Cormick Montreal Steak Seasoning.

We made these last night. These were very good and powerful! We like our food spicy so this was right up our alley. If I was to make again I would probably tone down the basil and italian seasoning. Thanks for the post.

This was a good marinade. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic. The only complaint I have is that it wasn't salty enough. Next time I will be adding salt.

Fabulous marinade! I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I subbed red wine and a dash of white vinegar. Served my tender steak with a side of peppers and onions, and a salad with blue cheese ... I could eat it every night!

We enjoyed this, but the flavor wasn't strong enough, which was my fault (I only had enough time to marinate it for 45 minutes). Next time, I'll make sure I have enough time to marinate it completely and then I'll do as another reviewer suggester and try boiling the remaining marinade down to make a sauce.

This is the first time I have EVER written a comment about anything. I felt the need to let everyone know what a great receipe this is. the only change I made was use pork chops---TO DIE FOR. Before we only did pork chops in the oven--this is the best ever barbaque pork chops

Used Montreal Steak seasoning & used a little less olive oil.  No piercing cause we cook our steaks rare/med-rare.  A little heavy on the Worch sauce but I like changing up my steaks.  I made this 2 times both with NY and top sirloin.  Both equally good.  I will be putting this marinade into our rotation.  Thanks.

Great marinade, but as one reviewer noted -- never, ever pierce the meat.

Excellent flavor. I was afraid the steak seasoning was going to be too salty but it turned out great after all. I used McCormick Hamburger seasoning for this. Thanks for a great steak.

This was really good, but a tad bit too salty.  I would recommend using a no salt or low salt steak seasoning to help with that.

wow this ws freaking amazing, you don't need any sauce on after  you cook it.  For the steak seasoning I used montreal steak spice, looking at the ingrediants I thought that it would be way too strong boy was I wrong.  I cooked this for the family on Father's Day for 6 people, it makes enough so that I didn't have to make more, let it sit in the fridge for about 6 hours and i didn't prick the meat and still it tasted awesome. thanks for a great marinade.
update:  This also works great with frozen steaks as well.  Usually when I decide I want to make this marinade the steaks are frozen,  all I do is put the steaks in a freezer bag pour the marinade over it and leave it in the fridge till the next night.  Simply amazing

My husband and I had this last night and I have to say that this is the BEST we have ever had.  I marinated it for 8 hours and used Mrs. Dash for the steak seasoning since I don't care for salty foods.  I cut the ingredients in half since it is just my husband and I, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as is.

I have tried this one twice and my hubby had the same reaction both times so I thought it was worth reviewing. I followed the recipe exactly but both times, he felt it was just too bland, without enough kick. He would have prefered just plain grilled steak to a marinade he felt did nothing to enhance flavor. I found the flavor pleasant but I'm not the steak affectionado in the family. Anyway, probably won't make this again.

My husband who has never cooked in his life decided for Christmas to make me dinner and found this recipe.  He was able to fallow the instructions easily and made the best steaks I have ever had.  I don't usually like steaks off the grill because they are dry, but these were perfect.

I thought this was a good marinade, however I guess I just really don't like this cut of beef. I don't like a lot of fat in my steak, so I think I will try this marinade on filet mignons next time.

Great marinade.  I took steak seasoning to mean a sauce like HP, so that's what I used.  Turned out yummy.  Will try on pork chops next time like someone suggested.

This is a bold flavored marinade, but delicious. It provides a tone of flavor. One of the best.

I was very good, however, I wish I would have used a cheaper cut of steak. I'm guessing that it would work great with something like a thick sirloin for half of the price per pound.

Like many other reviewers, I was concerned about the quantity of steak seasoning but the results were excellent.   I marinated the steak for close to 24 hours but think any more than that might be too much.  Got rave reviews!

Followed all the ingredients and it was amazing. I did forget to spear the steak but it still turned out amazing. 450 degrees on the Barbie for 7 minutes each side and 5 minutes on top rack for 1-1/2 inch steaks was perfect.

This was fantastic! I marinated 4-5lbs of steak overnight in the fridge. Grilled on medium-high heat turning to sear. It was so flavourful and tender! Everybody loved it. Thanks!

I rarely marinade steak because I love the flavor of a good steak with just salt & pepper, but I was in the mood for something different.  I found this on the recipe site geniuskitchen.com and realized I've seen it on here before so I'm doing the review on this site.   My boyfriend love it and I liked it but thought it was a tad bit too salty.  It didn't really take away from the flavor of the steak, it just really enhanced the flavor which I liked.  I used McCormicks steak seasoning and I might cut back the next time because I thought it was a tad bit salty.

This is BY FAR the BEST steak recipe out there. It doesn't mask your natural steak flavor. Being that it's still acting like winter, I've been putting the steaks in the broiler. 8 min/7 min is a perfect medium well. 7/6 a perfect medium. 
I used McCormicks Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning , it's perfect. I used minced garlic instead of fresh and that's perfect. The 2 hours is enough to marinade it for, although the longer the better for juicier steaks. 
I've made this on Strip Steaks, on Filet Mignon, and also Sirloin, just varying the temp and time to cook depending on the cut. It works for ALL OF THEM!!!!!!
I won't make steak any other way. I also use this on steak burgers before throwing them on the BBQ, the family won't even eat burgers any other way anymore!!! Thank you for this recipe, I"ll use it for a lifetime!!!!

I liked this more than I thought I would. I didn’t have any spices labeled “steak seasoning” but saw another reviewer added Cajun seasoning so I did the same and followed the other ingredients. I marinated over night in a zip lock bag, giving a good squeeze every time I got into the fridge. My husband does not like marinade at all so had to really convince him to try it and he loved it too. I bought grillmates yesterday so will make it as directed the next time but happy to do the Cajun again too.  Very good flavor without taking away from a great cut of steak.

Like many others I don't normally marinate a good cut of beef but this was really good. Very tender and juicy. I was out of charcoal so I pan seared on each side until nicely browned then removed to a platter and tented with foil for 10 minutes. Served with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.....perfect!

Pretty solid marinade for steaks; inexpensive ingredients.  Piercing the steak is definitely a must; I forgot to do that the first time.  Also good for basting the steaks if you use a grill.  I have to pan-sear them since I have no grill but turns out to be a great steak.  I'd recommend using it for fatty cuts.

Delicious! Left the steaks in marinade overnight. Left out the basil. Grill was unavailable, so I put them under the broiler for about 7 minutes on each side. Tender and tasty!

We loved it! I increased steak seasoning to 2 TB, and substituted sherry for the red wine vinegar because that was all I had on hand.  Will make again.

The seasoning of the steak was unbelievable. I should have went with half of the recommended seasoning because for some of my family it was too powerful even though they loved it. Seriously this is good though.

This was a great marinade.  As others stated it, was not overpowering and didn't take away from the steak flavor.  Only change I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  Will absolutely use again.

Excellent dinner! Goodness! This was so good! Would have been even better if I would have had time to marinate the full amount of time.  Next time I will. Only tweaked the recipe a little because I didn't have the red wine vinegar so I substituted half balsamic vinegar and half red cooking wine. The meat still turned out sooo very good! Thank you! Much enjoyed!

This was a good basic recipe, but I feel it needs tweaking to match our tastes. I found the vinegar a little overpowering, and would reduce it by half and add one tablespoon of honey next time.

Really great. I use this marinade with Strips and Ribeyes about 3 nights a week. I use McCormicks Grillmates as the steak seasoning and it makes a big difference to use fresh cracked italian herbs vs ground dry italian herbs. The marinade is so good I usually save it and eat it on top of the steak.

Thanks for sharing such a terrific recipe!

I made this tonight and my whole family loved it. I'm horrible at cooking steaks and most meats, but this was  a winner. I used thin cut new york strip steak cuts and marinaded it for a few hours. I ended up putting those steaks in my panini girdler with some butter for 4 minutes and they came out perfect and not rubbery at all. I didn't even have basil or steak seasoning. I ended up using creole seasoning! Regardless, even my picky toddler ate a whole steak! I will be adding this marinade to my recipe box for sure!

Wow - this was delicious!!  I made the recipe exactly as described and marinated a sirloin steak for most of the day.  I do not normally eat steak and made this for my husband but I have to say , when I tried a small piece, I loved it!  Definitely a keeper which I will use again.

Excellent. This will be my go-to marinade for NY strips from now on. Agree with others though, too much marinade - cut the  Worcestershire and olive oil in half, or simmer the extra liquid for a little juicy sauce.

Oh my word-delish! Great flavor and 7 minutes on each side made them tender and juicy. I followed the recipe perfectly.

Marinated the steaks for 2 hours. This marinade overpowered the natural steak flavor of a NY strip. Not my thing, but not terrible we still ate it. Back to my old way of making a strip steak with butter, garlic salt and pepper.

I made this yesterday for Easter. I got lots of ''RAVES'' from my Guests..I didn't have any Minced Garlic so I used 1/8th cup of Garlic Powder instead & followed the rest of the recipe to a ''T'' ..It was FABULOUS!  Grilled it 7 min. on each side.. PERFECT! I did as one reviewer said and marinated ''frozen'' steaks in the refrigerator overnight...I was amazed how everyone ate a ''Huge'' steak, a big baked Russet potato, plus veggies and still had room for Strawberry Cheesecake.. Will definitely use this marinade over and over...it's a KEEPER!!

Definitely 5 stars.  The marinade made this steak so juicy and tender!  I was only able to marinade for 45 minutes and it was still great.  I can't imagine how tender it would have been if I could have let it marinade for the 2 hours as instructed.  It's a make again!

Pretty good marinade. A little heavy on the sodium, but if you cut back on the worcestershire sauce its good. It worked well in a pinch with some steaks I didnt get to cook the day I bought them.

I prefer my steak simple. Seasoning salt and garlic powder. Hubby and kids felt the same. 
I marinated for the minimum of 2 hrs and still felt it overpowered the natural steak flavor. Not my thing, but not terrible we still ate it.

This marinade deserves 10 stars. It was the best New York bone-in steak my husband & I have ever made. Followed marinade directions exactly, refrigerated for 4 hours, then removed from frig & let steaks sit 10-15 min before grilling.  Only thing we did differently was to use Mesquite wood chips on our gas grill.  This is Steak House quality. Can't wait to make again.

Soooo good! I used McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning. I sub red wine vinegar for Sherry Vinegar and cooked them on a skillet by pan searing them for about 2 min on each side then lowering temp until done(about 6-8 minutes for medium well)

This was an AWESOME recipe! My husband and I really enjoyed this. I doubled the basil and Italian seasoning by accident but it turned out wonderful--I'll continue to double those in the future. This recipe produced a marinade that really had an intense flavor. Many marinades don't have enough flavor for me so I end up adding A1. This recipe had the PERFECT amount of punch and I found it exceptional! I served the steak with grilled onions, sauteed in balsamic vinegar and a touch of olive oil.

This recipe is so awesome. For steak seasoning, I use Emeril's Steak Rub, and instead of mined garlic, I use Gourmet Garden Garlic Blend Paste. Wonderful.

I'm not a steak eater but I tried this for my son.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I left that out and just added more garlic (fresh).  He thought it was great.  It was very juicy, even though we cooked it in the oven.  Thanks.

Not the best marinade for a steak that I've had.  Tasted rather bland, neither my hubby nor I enjoyed it.  Sorry!

Excellent taste. I skipped the italian seasoning and basil and only had 3 hrs to marinate but still great. Not too strong for us.
