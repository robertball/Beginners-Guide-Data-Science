We loved this! I cut down a little on the oil only used enough to saute the onions and I added a clove of chopped garlic with the onions. Apart from that followed the recipe exactly. Thank you - will definately make this again!

I needed a way to use up some leftover beets and these were delicious!! The only problem I had was that I used half white vinegar and half red wine vinegar and they were a little more sour than sweet! I will definatley make them again with malt vinegar.

These were pretty good. A little too sweet. Also I added a clove of garlic after reading the other review. Next time I'll leave that out. I didn't really think it belonged there and I love garlic. Next time i will hold back on a little of the brown sugar and not add any garlic. Also I used cider vinegar and it worked just fine. Thanks for the recipe. The 4 stars is based on the sweetness. Not my mistake of adding garlic. UPDATE: Made this again with a little less sugar and they were perfect for our tastes.

This was my first experience with fresh beets and I'm pleased with how they turned out. Here in amish country we must grow things big because the beets took closer to 30 min to cook. I didn't have malt vinegar but read other reviews and decided to try with cider vinegar- when I reached for the bottle realized there was only about 1Tbsp in it and resorted to white and cut back to 4Tbsp of the vinegar- I tasted the sauce/juice and it was still on the sour side so just added an extra Tbsp of brwn. sugar. Rated 5 stars because I'm sure if I had the apple cider or malt vinegar that the sour and sweet would balance! Good recipe despite my purple fingers!!!

Very tasty! I made this vegetarian so I put vegetable stock instead of chicken broth and I used 3/4 pounds beets instead of 1/2 a pound and the flavor came out very nicely.

I made this and it was great! I used what I had though. Olive oil corn starch and white vinegar instead. They were very yummy just the right sweet n sour ratio. Making it again today.
