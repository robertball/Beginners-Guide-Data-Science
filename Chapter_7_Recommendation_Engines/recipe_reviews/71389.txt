Awesome recipe! Very different sauce that I thought was a nice change from the ordinary. I added a can of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce instead of the 1 can of crushed tomatoes to make it more saucy.

This was just ok for me. I liked the flavor that the cinnamon and cumin added but it still tasted like it was missing something. Too bland. I added a tablespoon of sugar and some salt to it just to make it edible but it was still missing something. I would have like parmasean cheese but didn't have it. Maybe next time I will add cheese. I also don't think my 6 year old will like it very much.

Tasty - But adding more pasta to feed unexpected guests just wouldn't have worked when I was cooking for 8 and my sister-in-law arrived with her family of 6 plus her guests that she was bringing "for us to meet". They invaribly arrived pretty close to dinner time!!:) LOL. I survived!

Very super yummy. Good twist on a regular pasta sauce. Chicken in the sauce was a good change. I added a LOT of pepper flakes as my family loves hot food. very good!

Quick easy and inexpensive but lacking in flavor. I like the spice combination but it could easily be doubled because they don't really come through to make the sauce as interesting as it could be

I really liked this. I felt the seasoning was just right for my husband and myself. I would like to add mushrooms and tomato paste and maybe just a pinch more of the seasonings then. I feel that the green peppers need to be cooked much longer.
