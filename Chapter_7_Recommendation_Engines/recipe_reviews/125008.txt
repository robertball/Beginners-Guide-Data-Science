We'll eat brussel sprouts in any way shape or form, and this was just another nice way for me to make them for my gang. The little bit of sugar took away of slight bitterness of the sprout, the butter added what it always does; the "yum" factor and the water chestnuts added a great crunch. Thank you so much Dorothy!!

GREAT!  Hubby doesn't care for brussel sprouts, but he raved over this dish the entire meal.  I used frozen brussel sprouts and cooked them a little longer because I left them whole.  The water chestnuts gave it a nice crunch.  Thank you Dorothy Anderson for such an enjoyable dish.  It is a GREAT combination!

This was very good- and it was my first time eating brussels sprouts! It was very easy to prepare and the water chestnuts gave a nice crunch to it. I did think it maybe needed a bit more seasoning though, so I may play around with that in the future. Thanks for sharing!

This was ok. I agree that the sugar cut some of the bitter taste of the sprouts. I don't recommend scaling down the recipe though, the water measurements didn't come out right, too little water.
