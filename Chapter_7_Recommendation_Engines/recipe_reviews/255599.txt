Wow! this was really tasty!  I don't usually leave reviews but saw that this recipe only had three reviews and I wanted to do my bit to boost it because, in my opinion, it deserves it.  I made it exactly as is and felt that the flavors worked well together - I never would have thought to include cashews in a potato stew but their smooth richness contrasted well with the spicy tang of the tomatoes.  I would definitely make again and the only thing I would do differently would be to exclude the ranch dressing and hot sauce toppings - I  felt the dish stood on its own and didn't need them.

The butter isn't necessary if you're not sauteing your onions first (I use a very good organic evoo to do that if needed). I prefer real tomato's instead of canned (tasting can in your food is off putting so use 3 med sized tomatoes on the vine or you can measure 16 ounces of real chopped tomatoes & besides who needs calcium chloride in their diet anyhow so ditch the canned tomatoes) I halved the cashews, doubled the spinach & added some of my own chipotle in adobo to give it some smoky spice (hot sauce is boring imo & yes I used the red pepper flakes as well bc I prefer hot hot hot). I tossed the ranch & cheddar (I don't do dairy) With regards to the ranch, only bc I care about real nutrition that serves a purpose, is that your typical store bought ranch has some pretty harmful toxic chems in it so try making your own or buy a really good organic brand in a glass bottle. Jason's recipe is a simple foundation to build upon. If you make it the way I suggest  & leave out the butter, ranch & cheese it a very nice hearty vegan dish when using organic ingredients.

This was super delicious and easy to make.  I converted it into a crock pot meal by sauteing the onion and garlic first, adding them to the tomatoes and potatoes in the slow cooker, cooking 4 hours on high, and everything else according to directions.  This recipe is a keeper for me !

This recipe was delicious! I cut up too many potatoes so I added a container of tomato soup. As is I'm not sure how this recipe has enough liquid but with the extra soup it was perfect! Next time I will double the recipe for leftovers because we killed the whole pot.

I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I'm about to make it for the 5th or 6th time, so it's made it to favorite status.

This was easy and very tasty.  I didnâ€™t add the ranch, cheese or hot sauce but rather  left them on the side for people to add.  The cheese and ranch were a great addition. It was delicious!

This is a wholesome and filling stew like dish that's perfect for those cold winter days. Even this non-vegetarian would make this again.
