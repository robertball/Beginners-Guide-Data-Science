Disappointed with the final result.  Cake bland, not sweet enough.  Definately needed the sauce but it tasted like sweet butter water.  Will not make again.

Very GOOD!!! I heated the butter sauce each time before I served it, I ended up making about 10 of these in a month, everybody likes them.

It was less like a carrot cake than a very good spice cake.  I will make the cake again but may choose to use a more traditional cream cheese frosting. I was skeptical about the instructions regarding not greasing the baking pan but had absolutely NO problem getting the cake out of the glass baking dish. The butter sauce was a huge disappointment (hence the 4 out of 5 stars).  The corn starch turned a creamy sauce into a gloppy, lumpy coagulated mess. Reheating did not thin it and it was SO unattractive on top of the otherwise delicious cake.

The cake itself is classic and tasty. I did not try the butter sauce, but topped the cake with custard instead.
