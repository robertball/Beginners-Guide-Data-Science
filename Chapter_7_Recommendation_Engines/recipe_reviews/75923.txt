Well I could not find a "snake", so I used chicken. The flavors are wonderful, there is so much you can do with this recipe.  I would have never put all those flavors together.  I just sauteeded my chicken in some olive oil and salt and pepper in piece, I did not flour it.  I think that "Italian Sausage" would be good in this recipe also. I chopped up my veggies as I wanted the kid to eat them, but he still found them.  He loved the flavor though.. I only made 1/2 because there is two of us.  If you are looking for this to have more sauce I would double the cream and maybe the parm.  THANKS SO MUCH.. LOVE IT!!  N*R...

I had this dish in a very nice resturant in the area.  I did add a few more veggies and I doubled the cream but using fat free cream.  I used grilled chicken to help reduce the fat.  The dish was just wonderful and just like what was served in the resturant!  Thanks for sharing

N*R, very tasty.  The only change I made was to not dreg the chicken in flour and because I like spice, I seasoned the chicken with a 1/4 tsp of the cajun seasoning.  I would say to add more veggies and if you want sauce you need to add more cream as 1 cup is not enough.  I use 2 cups of cream with 3/4 box of the fettuccine.  All in all it is worth making and I will be making this again, it is a quick week night recipe.

I really liked this recipe, the Parmesan melded with the heavy cream creating a truly decadent sauce. I decided to go all veggie on this as I had neither chicken nor rattlesnake in my larder. I threw in some canned chick peas for protein and they added a nice touch IMHO. I will be making this again tonight for some guests.

This is a really good recipe.  I used 2 cups of cream using the same amount of seasoning & mustard as the recipe calls for.  I also used 1/2 of a jalapeno so it woudn't be to spicy for our daughter.  Great flavor.

I LOVED this.  My husband would prefer a bit more heat but I though the flavor was amazing.  I did use fire roasted diced tomatoes which were a great compliment to the cajun spices.

Very good.  The only thing I would have done differently would be to cook the meat first an set aside.  I waited until my pasta was done to fry the chicken and the noodles were a little sticky.

I tried the easy way to do this recipe.  I used Garlic & Olive Oil Pasta Roni, while that was cooking I cooked my chicken and added the vegtables and other ingredients torward the end, then i put it all in with the pasta, PERFECT in less than 25 minutes total.

LOVED this. Used 1 C heavy cream and an additional 1/3 C of half and half to make more sauce. It was a dish to be proud of for sure!

This lived up to it's name even though I did not use rattlesnake meat. The pasta has a little bite to it! I served with thinly sliced flank steak. I would serve the pasta as an entree by itself...no meat needed. It is fabulous!

Rattlesnake adventure at family reunion, we went from woods to table in 2 hours. We looked on All recipes and this was the only recipe. It was delicious, the only substitute we made was fresh hot pepper flakes instead of jalapeno. Also kept veggies separate from the rattlesnake and pasta.

I've made this many times it's become a favorite in my house. As is, it's a delicious recipe, although I use sausage instead of snake meat.  I've played around with it a lot, adding different types of vegetables and always more sauce, each time it gets better.  This is a fun recipe that's always a pleaser. Thank you.

The pasta dish itself is SO good. I followed advice in a review and doubled the cream and increased the cheese so that I had sauce in the dish. I also added more veggies as the amount in the recipe get lost in the pound of pasta.

Tried this recipe today, turned out fantastic! I altered it somewhat because we love spicy food. We added more Cajun seasoning, more jalapeno pepper, and used Red/Green Peppers instead of Squash and Zucchini. So delicious! Thanks for a fantastic recipe! We will have this again!

We really enjoyed this recipe - made it exactly as written except without the "snake meat"....instead we grilled hot Italian sausage and served it on the side. Certainly a Keeper in our rotation !!

This is one of my family's favorite recipes.  I don't follow it exactly...we don't use tomatoes and we grill or bake chicken breasts instead of rattlesnake meat.  I also add about a quarter cup of lemon juice at the end to make it a little tangy.  Absolutely delicious!  Tastes like a restaurant dish
