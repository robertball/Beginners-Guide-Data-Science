Delicious and very pretty for holiday table.  I added a can of mandarin oranges and pineapple tidbits which I had drained for 12 hours and a cup of marshmallows.  Next time will reduce conf. sugar, as it was quite sweet.

Delightful! I get lots of complements on this. This year I trimmed the edge of the bowl with sliced canned cranberry sauce so it looked like a petals on a flower. It looked pretty and the die hard cranberry sauce people were happy to have that to go with their turkey as well.

I loved the concept of the ingredients but found that I needed 2 cans of the whole cranberry sauce or else half of the other ingredients to get the full cranberry taste.  Maybe the brand of sauce that I used didn't have enough berries, but with another can it is very good.

My grandma used to make this every Christmas and Thanksgiving. I made it for the first time for Thanksgiving this year, and it was a big hit. However, I omit the mayo. It's not as shiny looking or as rich without it, but it is also lighter, fluffier, and slightly sweeter. I also double the whipped cream and use one 8 oz. can of whole berry and one 8 oz. can of jellied cranberry sauce.

This has a pretty good flavor. The cream cheese needs thinned slightly.

I didn't care much for this cranberry salad. The taste was overwhelmingly cream cheese. I do like cream cheese,I just don't want to eat it alone,which is basically what it seemed like.The cranberry taste seemed to get lost in this recipe. My daughter enjoyed it,but I just didn't think much of it. I won't be making it again:(

Pretty good...but no one in my family was a big fan of the texture of this dish.
