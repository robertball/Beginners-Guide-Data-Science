I'm hoping this 2nd review gets printed: We have made this many many times now and have served it to crowds of people, everyone, I mean everyone raves about it.

old review:  We made this recipe according to the directions and used 2 cloves of fresh garlic and a teaspoon of Old Bay.  We loved it.  A few days later we had company and doubled the recipe (add 5-10 mins cooking time as it does take a bit longer with more shrimp).  We noticed on the first go-around that there was plenty of "dipping" sauce leftover in spite of us having gone thru a small loaf of French bread so on the second go-around we added a pint of fresh mushrooms.  Still plenty of sauce for dipping and some mighty tasty mushrooms too!!!  One of the best recipes on this site and incredibly easy to make.  5 stars +++.

First off, I  hate anythiing marinated in Italian  dresssing so I was skeptical of this recipe but decided to give it a try based on the great reviews.  I had to alter it because I grilled the shrimp.  Instead of ½ cup of butter I used  ¼ cup of olive oil.  I used 2 cloves fresh garlic, ½ fresh squeezed lemon and 2 tsp Old Bay.  It was simply amazing.  My neighbor who came to our barbeque also brought shrimp and I ended up feeling bad because everyone was raving and devouring my shrimp!  Yes, they are that unbelievably good!  I can't wait to make this recipe as written with the butter baked in the oven.  I just wanted to let people know that it is delicious grilled too!  Also, I peeled my shrimp and the flavor permeated the shrimp and was wonderful.

I really am sorry but this recipe was horrible, all we could taste was the Zesty Italian Salad Dressing, my DH who  is the LEAST picky eater you will ever meet, he eats EVERYTHING, threw his entire plate in the trash.

Very tasty, and definitely a keeper.  I used fat free italian dressing and it came out just fine, especially with all the butter.

Like everyone else, I was skeptical. I have been to Pascal Manales and I have made other recipes for BBQ shrimp. I live on the gulf coast and we are very picky down here!  But this was simpler than other recipes I have used and I don't think we gave up any flavor.  I did add some worcestshire sauce and some tabasco for heat. Several people asked for the recipe and so it must have been a success! I served it in hollowed out bread bowls with the sauce in bowls on the side. Pretty impressive.

I'd rate this one ten stars if I could.  It was incredible.  It reminded me of Pasquales Manales (sp?) bbq'd shrimp, in New Orleans.  We dipped french bread in the sauce (which I doubled), and I also made white rice on the side and we  poured the sauce on that, too.  Great with a green salad on the side.  My 10-year-old son was eating the leftover shrimp COLD the next day!!  I tasted it and it was awesome!!!  This recipe will not disappoint.  Thanks for sharing it!!

I and everyone at my Mardi Gras party loved loved loved this shrimp.  I changed it slightly.  I used Old Bay Seasoning instead of pepper, and I used fresh garlic.  It was fantastically easy to prepare--just the right thing to get you out of the kitchen fast!

I tried this recipe after first finding it a couple of years ago.  Ever since, it is a hit (and requested) at all of our family get-togethers.  I've pretty much stuck to the recipe, except I always use fresh, minced garlic.  And lately, for ease of serving throughout the night, I make it in my slow cooker.  Just as the shrimp turns pink, I turn it down to "keep warm" and we can enjoy it for most of the evening.  Best shrimp recipe ever!

Mmmmm....Mmmmmm...Mmmmmm.....GOOOOD!!!!  I made this for an impromtu neighborhood BBQ.  Smash hit!  Since then, have made it for every holiday bash and party/potluck event throughout the year.  Tasty.  Thanks for sharing.
P.S. Try substituting the Italian Dressing with one of those bottled meat marinades.  Teryaki is one of our favorites.  This recipe will impress...definitely!!

Used this recipe a few months ago and it was fabulous!  Tonight is New Year's Eve and we usually make crab legs, but we are adding these shrimp to our menu. Not only are they easy to make, they are just as good as anything you could get at a fancy restaurant, if not better.  I was originally hesitant about the italian dressing, but once it is mixed with the butter and cooked with the shrimp, you'd never know there was italian dressing in it.  Fabulous, Fabulous, Fabulous!!!!

We've eaten this in our family for 40 something years. We use 5 lbs of Shrimp (adjust other ing.s accordingly) and lemon slices rather then juice. Butter ONLY. Serve in baking pan in middle of dining table covered with newspaper. Alongside have corn on the cob and french bread. Dip corn and bread into pan as you go along. Quite fun!! A smaller batch makes a sensuous dinner for two ;)) Truly awesome!!

This was a very good recipe.  I did add some chili powder and worcestire sauce along with some tabasco to spice it up a little.  Cooking with the shell on is definitely the way to go.  I served mine with french bread and added some garlic spread and lightly grilled it in a skillet.  The added flavor was great combined with the dipping sauce.  Definitely a recipe to use again!

I made this as written, and as is, it gets 3 stars. However, I think it would be better if you decrease the italian dressing and add the Old Bay that some have suggested.  P.S. I don't get where the "Barbequed" part comes in...

Made for a New Years Eve Party and we had nothing left. People are still asking about it. The sauce is fanstastic so have plenty of bread to soak every drop up.

this recipe was ok, thus the 3 stars. to the people who give 5 star reviews and then go on to tell me how much they altered the original recipe...?? don't totally re-invent the recipe to something completely different and then give a 5-star review. that's great that you can invent a great meal. how about you rate the recipe AS PRINTED so i'll know if i should try it or not. too many people give 5 stars on this site!

This shrimp was good.  I tried it with just the directions as written, and I tried it with the old bay and 2 cloves of garilc.  The old bay and garlic really added that something to it.  My husband is a big shrimp eater, and he really wasn't to fond of this ( he loves them fresh steamed, and smothered in old bay, with a side of cocktail sauce.), but for me, I loved it. And, definately get crusty bread to dip in the sauce.  YUM!!!

Yum!  I bet I've made this recipe at least six times in the last few months and I've given the recipe to four friends.  It is simple (easy to make after work) and very, very tasty!

Oh my gosh!  This was delish!  Tasted alot like shrimp scampi.  I followed directions exactly, except I used olive oil in place of butter (lactose intolerance).  Also as somone suggested and I threw some mushroom in.  I served as a main dish over rice.  But can also be served over noodles/ pasta.  Very good!  will make again.

I'm giving this 5 stars because, considering how easy it was to make and how simple the ingredients was, it tasted fantastic.  I will definitely make this again.  The only change I made was to use fresh garlic.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly.  Oh, and my shrimp were done in about 20 minutes.

If I could give this recipe higher than 5 stars I would.  I have to say that this is the very best recipe in my whole recipe box.  Oh My Gosh! What a great feast. I made the adjustments as suggested:  cut lemon juice in half, added some fresh minced garlic, some Old Bay Seasoning and a little hot sauce for spice.  You could serve this in a restaurant.  Dunked crusty french bread in the sauce....THIS IS THE BEST EVER!

I was a little skeptical at first due to the salad dressing but it actually turn out great.  Although, I used peeled shrimp instead and added Old Bay.

Great recipe!!!! The taste is wonderful and could not be easier!!!! I used fat free zesty Italian and you could not tell the difference with all the butter used. I also used minced garlic instead of powder and added some Louisiana Hot Sauce for extra kick. Do not skip the fresh French bread dipped in the left over sauce, it was as good as the shrimp !!!! Yum!!!! Thanks Carl!

I've tried at least 20 recipes from this site, and this is one of the best.  Absolutely fabulous flavor, and wonderful suggestion to dip the bread.  Ours had a bit too much sauce left over, so recommend cutting sauce ingredients by a quarter or half.

Fix this shrimp recipe along with a salad and french bread and you can't go wrong.

This is the easiest and best way to fix tender, juicy shrimps in the oven.  No heavy rich "red" barbeque sauce ~ light, tasty and the dipping butter sauce for french bread this is off the charts and simple!!  Tantalize any persons taste buds!

This is favorite at my house.  I usually put a few cloves of minced garlic in mine.  Good crusty bread for dunking is a must!

Very quick and easy. The Italian dressing is very prominent, so use one you really like.  Next time I'll try red wine vinegarette.  Also - I had already peeled my shrimp when I found this recipe.  Came out fine with peeled shrimp.

It was a good dish but nothing I would want to make again. If you do make it, fresh garlic is a must, so is a little Tabasco for the heat and Old Bay seasoning. Do not bake more than 20 min because the shrimp will get dry and rubbery.

We were not impressed by this one.  I don't think the combination of shrimp and Italian dressing worked very well.  We won't be trying this one again.

A group of us are planning a trip to Florida in the near future. They were coming to the house to discuss our trip. I decided to fixed this shrimp for the group as a "get ready for seafood" dish.  There was not one piece left. Everyone wanted more.  I served with a side salad and garlic bread.  It was Yummy!!

This was o.k., but I think next time I will probably use less Italian Dressing. The sauce is great for dipping bread! Would be ideal for an appetizer.

Quick and easy.  Shrimp were cooked perfectly.  Flavor wasn't bad, wasn't great.  Definitely needs some additional seasoning, some heat.  Will make again with a few changes.

This turned out pretty good. Everyone was raving over it. I made a few minor adjustments. I added a dash or so of crushed pepper and a maybe a 1/4 cup of white wine. Will make again!

WOW!  I only tried this after reading the rave reviews as the zesty Italian seasoning turned me off.  I tripled the recipe and added Old Bay and fresh garlic as suggested.  My guests went wild over it. I had to give them the repipe before they left.  I will make this many more times!

This shrimp recipe is the best of the best. We loved it!!  If you like the real taste of shrimp or like scampi - this is it.  It is like scampi with the shells and the dipping sauce is  excellent.

Not as good as I had hoped. Family thought it was ok...don't think I'll be making it again. The flavor was pretty good,but the shrimp didn't really pick up the seasonings that well. Just ok.

My family loves this shrimp!  I don't eat shrimp but it sure doesn't take long for my boys to scarf it down.  I do add Old Bay (just doesn't seem to be seafood without Old Bay) and reduce the lemon juice to 1/2 Tbsp.  I'm going to try it in the crock pot as another reviewer suggested.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was wonderful!  The only change I will make next time, is to cut down some of the butter, it was really rich.  Served it with fresh olive oil bread, rice, and a salad.  Delicious!

This is a wonderful dish. My whole family loved it though complained because the shrimp were not peeled. As a test, I made it with one with a couple of peeled shrimp in the mix and proved my point the shrimp have to be cooked with the shell on. This is wonderful served over saffron rice with crusty Italian bread on the side to dunk in the sauce.

Since I didn't have Italian dressing on hand, I substituted Caesar dressing.  I also added fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I really liked the outcome; however, my husband did not grab seconds....a real indicator that he wasn't crazy over it.  Will try this again - and will follow the recipe exactly.

Made it tonight for dinner and it was a huge hit with the family.  The only thing I changed is that I decreased the amount of butter to 1/3 cup and it was still fairly buttery tasting, but oh so delicious!  Served it over pasta.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for posting.

Simple. Good flavor. I used fresh garlic instead of powder. I used frozen shrimp and they cooked in the 25 minutes.

My boyfriend made this for dinner last night and it was awesome.  We had a glass of wine, a small salad and toasted bread to accompany the shrimp.  Absolutely Wonderful meal.

I wouldn't have tried this except for the good ratings.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, except used 2 lbs. shrimp and marinated 1/2 hour before cooking.  Didn't double the sauce but there was still lots for bread dipping (as others suggested).  Surprisingly, the ingredients work well together and I'll definitely make again.  But, as a personal preference next time I'll add some extra garlic.  Hubby likes Old Bay on shrimp, so he sprinkled on at the table.

We loved this one...but next time I will use just 1/2 of the Italian dressing & add just a touch of spice/hot to it.

Like other reviewers I was skeptical of the ingredients, but this was wonderful!  I can't wait to impress my in-laws with this dish.  I served this with homemade French bread and salad.  Absolutely delish!

Great dish!!!  Added tobasco to give it a nice kick, maybe next time I will add some chili powder for more flavor.  Anyone complaining about the shells should be told that they are where the fabulous FLAVOR comes from.  Worth working for!!

Absolutely Excellent!!  The only thing that I changed was to add real garlic instead of powder and add a healthy dose of Old Bay Seasoning!!  We served it over brown rice.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would! Followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely delicious. I am originally from the New Orleans area so I am picky about my shrimp and I loved this recipe. My very picky husband loved this recipe. Easy, yummy, and fairly inexpensive. What more can I say? Make sure you don't skip the french bread. Enjoy!

This is an AWESOME recipe!  I have made it 3 times and each time I can't wait to make it again.  The only adjustment that I have made is to leave the lemon out.  I am not a lover of lemon with seafood.  Served with garlic bread for dunking, it is the BEST shrimp I have ever had.  Thanks for submitting!!

Fan-freaking-TASTIC. We just inhaled these, and the crusty bread that we had with it, because of the delicious, super-simple sauce. I would make these again, maybe next time with the mushrooms as another reviewer suggested to soak up some more of the yummy sauce.

The shrimp was good, but too much butter. I would recommend halving the butter, and too much sauce. The oil in the salad dressing and butter was the predominant flavor. The good dressing flavors, however, did coat the shrimp nicely.

This was pretty good.  I did add 4 cloves of crushed garlic to mine in place of the garlic powder.  Definitely quick and easy.

My kids asked if the sauce was Italian dressing.  It was a little too much Italian dressing flavor for us.  We really liked the shrimp, but next time I'll cut back on the dressing.  My daughter also asked if it was "shrimp soup".

I made this as shown and thought it was fair. Very easy and quick to prepare, make sure that the shrimp are fresh and the bread is good and it is a great light meal or appetizer.

This recipe was very good but I decided to cook them in the microwave in a microwavable baking dish. It turned out very good with this change.
