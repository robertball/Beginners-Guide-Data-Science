Prepared for the Recipe Group. Hubby and I both really enjoyed this for lunch today.  All of the flavors go together so well and it is a very easy recipe that was fast to throw together with great results.  After reading the reviews, I made a couple of small changes. I pre-baked the crust for 10 min at 350 and allowed it to cool for a few min.
For the mustard, I used a couple of TBS of Grey Poupon and then mixed in a couple of tsp of stone ground mustard and spread approx 3/4 of that mixture on the crust.  I sliced the tomatoes and then placed them all on paper towels for approx 
30 min to drain and then proceeded with the recipe.  All of these small changes worked
out very well in preventing a soggy crust and watery filling.  We will definitely make this again very soon. Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious! Tasted just like my host mom's in France. I used puff pastry which gave me the flaky crust I was looking to recreate.  Merci!

Fantastic taste!  I layered the cheese on top of the tomatoes instead of under them.  Great flavor and color combination!

Made this for Recipe Group:  20, August 2011.  Delicious way to enjoy tomatoes.  I didn't measure the mustard, just made sure all of the crust was covered.  I didn't have, nor have I heard of herbes de Provence, but when I looked it up, it consisted of:  savory, fennel, basil, thyme, lavender and rosemary.  I used fresh - thyme, basil, chives & rosemary chopped fine.  When I put in one layer of tomatoes too much crust was left, so I made with 2 layers of cheese and 2 layers of tomatoes and 2 layers of fresh herbs.  The taste was wonderful but the tomatoes made it a little watery.  After dishing out the first piece I drained off the extra juice and it was fine.  The slices served up nicely and I will be making again since I have oodles and oodles of tomatoes.  Thanks Snackybits for sharing your recipe.

Close to paradise!  Made 2 in one day. Used cheeses on hand:  1st time, sharp Vermont cheddar; 2nd time, soft mozzarella and 4-cheese Italian blend.  Both delicious, but gruyere would be even better.  Drained tomatoes on paper towels, and made a couple layers of tomatoes and cheeses the second time, with fresh garden herbs (basil, rosemary, chives, and thyme) throughout, with a few sprinkled on top.  Would like to try this recipe with brie.  It made a beautiful presentation, and was well-liked by all.  The first piece comes out messy, but following slices come out surprisingly neatly, and it's not too liquid-y.

This was way too mustardy for our tastes. I will probably make again, but will use less mustard. I will also bake the crust a bit before adding the tomatoes and cheese, to keep it from getting soggy.

Made this for Recipe Group. Love the presentation factor. Taste is really good, the creamy cheese, the tart tomato, the earthy herbs and crunchy top crust are wonderful. The bottom crust is a little soft, but overall a wonderful combination of flavors. Daughter commented that we should make this again with different cheeses. I agree. I can't wait for tomorrow to have it for lunch. If there is any left.

Made this for recipe group August 20, 2011.  The pie makes a beautiful presentation however the flavors just didnâ€™t work for us.  We felt the mustard was too dominant.

Made for Recipe Group. Gorgeous presentation. Mustard overpowered this and the crust is completely wet from the oils in the mustard and the cheese, and water in the tomatoes. I did deseed and drain the tomatoes a bit first and it still was soggy. Despite the mustard pow, the taste combinations work well together and if you could cut that back, or maybe add a little sugar,  and get the crust to stay dry, this would be a winner. Thanks Snackybits.

I really, really liked this recipe.  It is simple to make and a wonderful use of fresh summer tomatoes. This will definitely make it into my permanent recipe stash and will be brought out every summer.

This is super delicious. I've made tomato tarts from similar recipes before, but the thing that this recipe taught me was to put a layer of cheese on the bottom of the crust--that really improves it.

This was great and so easy!  I didn't have herbs de provence, so I just added some fresh herbs from my garden.  I think the key is to use a great mustard and a great cheese.

5 stars for flavor.  This is really quite good.  I will prebake the crust a bit the next time I make this because it gets a bit soggy from the tomatoes.  I used Grey Poupon coarse mustard and Jarlsburg cheese with my home grown tomatoes and I omitted the olive oil.  Thank you, Sackybits for a lovely new recipe

This is the exact recipe I was looking for. I worked for a French woman who made this once and i completely forgot how she told me to make it. Instead of olive oil she used vinaigrette, a different cheese (here in Paris it's the cheese in a small clear unmarked package) instead of Swiss, and basil instead of herbs de Provence. I changed it a bit like hers but still a great, easy to make dish.

Very good tart, but a tad much on the mustard.  I also think I'd want something added to this like bacon or sausage, but that's personal preference.  Very tasty!  Thanks for the recipe.

Prebake the crust for 10 minutes or it will get soggy.  I love Tarte aux Moutarde and it reminds me of my time in Lyon.

The recipe works pretty well but the cheese is totally optional. If you have gorgeous, fresh tomatoes (perhaps from the garden), then skip the cheese and let the tomatoes shine through.

A few things that I did:
1) Tomatoes are watery. Pre-bake the sliced tomatoes while you pre-bake the crust to help draw out some of the water and get a more concentrated tomato flavor.
2) Avoid soggy bottom crusts. Pre-bake the crust on the bottom rack of your oven!
3) Add garlic or onions (or both)! I sliced half an onion and sauteed it in some butter before adding it to the rest of the filling.

This is the second time I have made this and itâ€™s important to precook the pie crust. I also added some pancetta and smashed black olives which I think improved the taste. Try to dry the tomatoes by putting the slices in paper towels and patting them as dry as possible. Too much liquid spoils the pie crust and makes a soggy mess. Great recipe if your garden is overflowing with tomatoes.

It's only a pie if it has a crust on the top of it.  The french name is  Tarte aux tomates i.e. tart!    Tarts are open faced like the one pictured here. Steak and kidney pie is a pie as the contents are enclosed in pastry.  That's the difference!

Served as lunch for a couple of friends who loved it. I used a milder honey Dijon mustard since I'm not fond of a strong mustard taste. Also shredded Swiss cheese since that's what I had and the fresh-picked tomatoes they brought. Mixed my own Herbes de Provence from a recipe on this site. Will definitely make again, as will my friends.

We like mustard at our house.  However, given  the reviews I chose to use less.  Thank goodness!  The mustard is overwhelming - to the point where it drowns out the tomato - the star of the dish.  I would defintely encourage cutting the mustard down.  I only did a brief drizzle of oil and think that was a good choice as well.  Also, the advice others have given regarding prebaking the crust is good.  I did that and also followed the advice to let the tomatoes sit on paper towels to allow some of the liquid to drain out.  I used a 4 cheese blend as it was all I had on hand and that worked quite well.  Fresh basil and parsley were good additions.  This pairs well with a nice green salad and some garden fresh cucumbers for a light summer dinner.

Followed the recipe as written, only exception was  the addition of a layer of procuitto ham over the mustard.  My husband and I loved the flavors of the tart -- did not find the 1/2 C mustard too much.  Great recipe for using up a few of the abundant summer tomatoes from our garden.  Will definitely make again.

I took some tips from previous reviewers...pre-baked the pie crust for 10 minutes at 350, used a very large heirloom tomato (because they are meatier) and also pre-baked the tomato, in a glass dish, along with the pie crust, and I lessened the amount of mustard (to our taste).  I then baked the final product for 20 minutes at 375...as per the recipe. We then left it to cool on our kitchen counter, while we went for a dog walk and market run. Came home to a delicious and beautifully rustic meal. Amazing, will definitely make this a regular go to, hot or cold.Thank you so much for sharing and to all of the helpful review suggestions!

I've made this several times in the last week. With amazing local tomatoes in season, I couldn't resist! I love how versatile this is, too. I made it with the suggestions of  salting the tomatoes and letting them dry out a little before adding. The next time I made it, I topped it with bacon, cause, well, bacon! And I changed up the cheeses, using pepper jack, cheddar and provolone on different ones. I also topped one with a fried egg when it came out of the oven for a yummy breakfast! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Interesting flavor. I was surprised that I liked it on the pastry dough. What I did, mixed two mustards together, stone ground and spicy brown because I knew I'd like the flavor better. I pre- cooked the pastry a bit maybe 4-5 minutes, my goal was to make it not real juicy as per the complaint written by others. I've got a good knife and sliced the tomatoes nice and thin. Also used a good pre sliced Swiss cheese that was thin. I didn't particularly follow the amounts listed, just went and did it after I read what was in it and how to put it together. Sprinkled the top with the herbs of France. Then baked it for only about 10 minutes. Worked great, not too juicy. I forgot to add the oil, (oops) came out good anyway I enjoyed the entire thing (not all at once)! Oh I didn't use a pie pan either just a cookie sheet with sides (in case it flowed over but it didn't). Came out looking like a pizza. I will do this again when my sister is over for lunch.

Great recipe - but I must disagree that Lyon is the gastronomic capital of the world.   It doesn't hold a candle to New Orleans.  New Orleans encompasses the best of  French, Italian, African, German, Cajun,  Caribbean, Southern and Spanish food.  I've lived in San Francisco, New York, Europe, Australia and many places in between.   New Orleans food reigns.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but we couldn't eat it.

This was OK.  I love mustard but found this way too mustard-y.  Maybe it was the mustard I used, but all we could taste and breathe was mustard.  It burned my nose.  I think 1/2 a cup on the bottom of the pie might have been a little much.  It was probably 1/2 an inch thick on the pie crust I used.
