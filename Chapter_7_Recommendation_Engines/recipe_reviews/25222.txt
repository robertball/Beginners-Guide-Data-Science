The bars are great: moist, chewy and good. Here are the changes I recommend: melted butter, not oil; using more persimmon, 3 ripe persimmons instead of 2 and/or adding some shredded Fuyu (the little crunchy ones). And less baking soda: 3/4 t. baking soda is enough.  I also prefer a less spicy bar with only 1/2 t. cinnamon, 3/4 t. fresh grated nutmeg, and no cloves.

Great recipe! I followed one reviewer's suggestion of adding an extra persimmon, skipping the cloves and using butter instead of oil. (I made an additional modification and mixed in 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract with the beaten egg and sugar). The bars were super moist and tasty...almost like indulging in a delicious carrot cake. I topped mine with cream cheese frosting and they were FANTASTIC. Note: with my version, the bars weren't ready until 40-45 minutes (about twice as long as the original 20 minutes called out in the recipe)...still very much worth the wait !

Excellent! I went with melted butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 tbsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp allspice, 1 tsp ginger. I used pecans and golden raisins, then topped w/ cream cheese frosting. Everyone loved them!

I make this in the fall from our home-grown persimmons and everyone asks for the recipe.  It's quicker than cookies and turns out great every time.  I make 1 1/2 batches to fit in a my larger jelly-roll pan.

This was the first time I have cooked with persimmons and I was pleasantly surprised. I left out the raisins because I don't care for them, but it was still very delicious!

These are really good!  I left out the nutmeg and cloves because I don't care for the taste.  I had to double up on the glaze also.

I made these without raisins since I don't care for them. Someone had given me dates and I used those instead. They were delicious! Next holiday season I may experiment with dried cranberries. This is definately a keeper.

These persimmon bars are the BOMB!!!  I followed the recipe exactly but I doubled everything and baked it in a parchment lined 24"x14" baking sheet.  I used fresh lemon juice in the batter with the zest of the whole lemon.  I iced it immediately after it came out of the oven.  DELLICIOUS AND SUPER MOIST!

How funny that this is the same recipe that my great grandma used to make persimmon cookies. Her recipe has an extra half cup of flour. I actually like it better than the cake-like cookie. A lot easier too. No nuts and no glaze and I prefer 1/8 teaspoon clove.

Overall a good recipe, the bars came out sort of like a spice cake. They had a good taste, though I would never have thought they had persimmon in them other than the orange color. In fact, one might think they were pumpkin because of that. They were easy to make but the different mixtures were kind of odd - the baking soda with the persimmon and the raisins with the oil and sugar. Also it used four mixing bowls which means a lot of dirty dishes. If you have some persimmons you need to use up, I'd definitely recommend these, but they didn't blow me away.

I made this last night and can't stop eating these bars. I don't own a jelly roll pan so I put them in a 9" square brownie-type of glass dish. The bars are about  1.25 inches deep and it took 40-45 minutes to bake, not 20. Only changes were no walnuts, swapped out cloves for 1/8 tsp ground cardamom, added 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Used golden raisins. Also, I put almond slices on top of glaze. It took 3 persimmons to get the cup. I had to microwave them to mash, and then let cool. That part took a while and some effort. So good though!

These were very moist for days and I had never had a persimmon before and didn't know what to do with it - so thanks for adding this recipe.

Yum! I took the advice of others and used melted butter in place of the oil. I also used closer to 3/4 teaspoon nutmeg, than the called for 1 teaspoon. Very easy to make and didn't stick at all to my Teflon jelly roll pan. Everyone asked for seconds! I'll defi be making this again!

Changes I made: I used melted butter instead of oil. The bars were OK but somewhat more oily than tasty, to me. Also, the persimmon taste, even with an extra persimmon, was hardly evident. Friends liked the, but said they tasted like raisins and cinnamon. Not bad but not what I was hoping for.

Made this  recipe many times.   My workplace has learned to look for these.  Also wonderful in Christmas baking. They are a hit!  I will freeze the extra persimmon pulp in 1 cup bags for  ease in future baking.

Great way to use persimmons! I leave out the raisins (personal preference), and use cream cheese frosting to add a bit of zing. Otherwise, it's a little too sweet for me.

Wow! Great recipe! But a healthy note: cut sugar in half ( I substituted 1/4 c honey, 1/4c coconut sugar) also threw in a half of a Fuji apple. No raisins and  Plenty sweet! I also substituted almond flour for white flour. Ok, so I’m on a health binge. So yummy just the same!!

Texture was awful and 20 minutes in a jelly roll pan was too much time.  Tried next day in a smaller pan with slightly better results but dont think I’ll make again.  Best thing about was the lemon glaze.  Doubled glaze and put it on with holes poked in cake.  That helped.  Positives:  easy to make, quick, good glaze.  CONS:  terrible texture (tough), taste was only so—so.

Made exactly according to the recipe  using 1 cup persimmon pulp. Quick & easy to make and so so good. Almost didn't put the glaze on as my husband prefers his sweets without topping but even he says the lemon glaze is perfect. Thank you for sharing.

It was easy to make, moist, and tasty. Next time I’ll leave out the confectioners sugar glaze. My two year old sons also loved it.

Made these bars tonight. Substituted butter for the oil and didn’t mix in raisins. Plus, I didn’t have lemon juice, so used lime.  They’re really good, but since they have the same spices as pumpkin bread, that’s kind of what they taste like. So, I wouldn’t necessarily buy persimmons to make this recipe. But when someone hands me a bunch (like they did last week), I’ll once again turn to this recipe.  It IS fun to bring them to work and say, “What are they? Why they’re PERSIMMON bars!” It raises eyebrows. People think it’s extra special because who even knows what these little guys ARE? Lol. Great recipe, lime frosting makes it extra zingy too. :)

This is almost identical to the recipe my mom was "famous" for!  She used 8 oz pitted dates instead of raisins... yum.  These have been a family favorite for as long as anyone can remember.

Delicious! I made a half batch in  a 9"x9" bc I only had half the amount of sugar on hand.  It was delicious and looked JUST LIKE the picture! I was so excited! My husband and family love this! Will definitely make this again  :D

The change of melted butter is perfect instead of oil.  These are the best persimmons cookies/bars ever.  I will make them again next persimmon season.

Had 3 large ripe persimmons so had more puree than called for but it works. I didn't have white sugar so used coconut sugar. It works, and would likely work with brown sugar. I also added vanilla.  These came out thicker because I had more mixture (upped the flour a little bit). Next time I would use another pan and spread them thinner. But they are so moist and delish.  There is almost a liquor like taste to them -- maybe the ripe fruit, or the fresh ground nutmeg?

I really enjoyed these, I increased the persimmons a bit and used half the amount of icing.  They are delish!

i used melted butter instead of oil, but otherwise didn't change anything. It was out of this world! I have never cooked with persimmons before but think that must have been what gave it the moist quality. It was almost as moist as a bread pudding but more cake like.

This is a real good recipe. I didn't have raisens so I used small banana chunks. I also used whole wheat flour and 1/3 almond flour.

Made it exactly as printed and my husband said the bars are the best, we like the spices in it - think the glaze really adds to the flavor - will definitely go out and collect more persimmons this fall.

Wow! That's what my taste buds screamed when biting into these! The lemon icing is supreme! I will use it on other recipes too. The only alterations I made were the following:
1. I used half whole wheat flour and half white.
2. I added 1/2 cup raisins.
Thank you for the great recipe Jessica!

Turned out good. Kids didn't want to try it, but once they tried it they all 3 liked it. Skipped the nuts and the glaze. 1/1/13

More like a spice cake.  Couldn't taste the persimmons but that didn't bother us!  All the neighborhood kids loved them. I had a huge bag of persimmons given to us so I froze the extra puree and would make this recipe again.  It took a little time to get it pushed around the pan evenly and cooked in a little over 12 min.  Didn't have lemons but had limes. It made a pleasant tartness on top of the sweet bars.
