Absolutey amazing! I did make a slight modification though. I used 1/4 C ea. red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, and cider vinegar. I just eyeballed the amount of oil, but I know I didnt use 1/3 of a cup, thats too much. I probably went a little heavier on the garlic and feta too. I just put my onions in fresh, not with the hot water over them. Going to try with red onions next time. Ive made this twice in the past week and it doesn't stay around long!

A good salad, but I must say the dressing is very strong and pungent.  Have mints handy!!

Very good.  I leave the beans whole and omit the feta.  We eat the beans like french fries next to a sandwich or burger.  Dressing is tasty.  There was a good bit of dressing left over and I reused it on another batch that were just as good.  Have also substitued balsamic vinegar for the apple cider vinegar with positive results.  My new favorite way to eat green beans.

I was surprised at how well this salad came out.  The only thing is that the beans kinda turned yellowish after they sat in the dressing (the photo was taken right after dressing was poured on top).

I cut the oil measurement in half and used half balsamic vinegar -- it got rave reviews from everyone.  Is quick, easy and gets better the next day.

Liked the flavor. My husband thought it was a four star dish but plans to revisit it in the morning and thinks it will become a 5-star after the flavors meld more. Didn't have any dressing problems and followed the recipe exactly; used a 16-ounce bag of frozen green beans and added a little bit more feta so maybe the feta absorbed some of the dressing.

My good friend made this with our dinner last night -- it was SO yummy! He used olive oil instead of canola and added grape tomatoes. I will definitely make this.

I loved the flavors and would make it again but you do need to cut the dressing in half and it is a good idea to drain excess the next day if you have any left over.  The next day the flavors are even better.

This was so good I ate two large bowlfulls as soon as it was ready. I variated from the recipe by draining off the excess marinade the next day (through a colander) and then added chopped up ham to make it a meal. The feta cheese adds the perfect touch.

Sorry, this dressing was just awful. I love vinegar but 1 cup of vinegar to only 1/3 cup of oil? The proportions for this have to be wrong. I had to add SO much oil along with a few teaspoons of mustard to even make it edible. 
Nope, won't be trying this again.

I gave this three stars as is; I'm a very big fan of vinegar, and so liked it. But I  changed it somewhat after mixing everything up-added jalapenos, red peppers, used equal parts basalmic/red wine/apple cider vinegar, and also added a tad more sugar. Very good!

Great recipe - was a big hit at a BBQ last weekend.  It makes a ton of dressing, though - I only used about half of what I made.  I'll definitely make it again!

This had a really good flavor, The only thing I will change next time is to reduce the amount of dressing. I used 1 1/2 pounds green beans as called for and they were swimming in dressing. I poured half of it off and stuck it in the fridge. 4 hours later there was still plenty of dressing.

I fixed this salad for my family reunion, and was too embarrassed to take it.  It was terrible.  The dressing and the feta cheese were lovely together and I will definitely use them again over some lettuce next time.  No more bean salads for me unless it's three bean.

This is a great way to use those in-season or garden beans.  Like many, I cut the dressing in half,except for the sugar.  Makes a large amount, great for picnics.  Kids even enjoyed this.  Will make again, only half for us at home.

I  used Aldi extra fine frozen green beans, cooked just a bit then into ice bath.  Dressing is strong but we liked it. Lots of dressing left so I decided to try adding the frozen beans straight from the freezer.  Not bad either but a bit chewy.  I'll try adding a bit of water next time and reserve some feta to top, most melted into the dressing.

Great beans!  I let mine soak overnight.  Very alive and worth making again.  I added a little fennel seed (my first time using it!) to another batch and it was great.

It seems this recipe can be altered in many ways and still be very tasty.  I made for a neighborhood party and received many compliments.  I used 2 lb. fresh green beans cut to 3 in.; 1/2 a red onion & 1/2 a sweet vidalia onion.  In the dressing I used 2 cloves garlic, 1 1/2 T. sugar, 1/4 c. apple cider vinegar, 1/4 c. rice wine vinegar, 1/2 c. sweet balsamic vinegar, Emeril's red Kick it Up Sauce, worestershire sauce & canola oil.  I added fresh chopped oregano to the salt & pepper seasoning.  Increase the sugar if you wish a sweeter taste.  I did use all of the dressing and stirred it a few times as it chilled.  The feta cheese is best added and gently stirred in just before serving.  Delicious compliment to a buffet of sliced ham and/or grilled pork tenderlions.

Love it!  I use olive oil and omit the hot sauce (not worth it to buy some just for a dash).  My boyfriend loves it, too.

Described as tangy, that is accurate! It is extremely tangy. I think if it had less vinegar, less dressing overall, it might have been good. We couldn't handle it, unfortunately.

I halved the dressing and there is still a ton left in the bottom of the bowl. I plan on using it as a meat marinade. Other than that I followed the recipe and it is very good, will definitely make again, but might replace cider vinegar with balsamic — the fruity taste in it seems a tad out of place.

Incredibly good - very light and tasty.  I followed the recipe as is except I used 2 small shallots in place of onion.  My 5 yo daughter and I could not stop eating the stuff long enough to get it in the fridge to marinate!  I plan to use this dressing for cucumbers too - I think it will be great.

This is fabulous! I forgot to put the garlic in, used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have rice wine vinegar, and used blue cheese because I didn't have feta. In spite of all of those changes it was still delicious. I'm planning on taking this dish to a neighborhood picnic next week.

This was OK. I like vinegar, but, this was VERY pungent. Next time, I will skip the minced garlic and use granulated instead. Also, half the ingrediants in the dressing, there is way too much of it. I would add more sugar to cut the acidity of the vinegar. It also needs something else flavor-wise, maybe oregano? I used lemon and oregano flavored feta cheese, which lent a little more flavor. There were many compliments, but, I thought it was just so-so as is.

Delicious! I made this for a barbecue last weekend and it was a hit! I used red onions because that is what I had on hand and I added halved cherry tomatoes. Next time I will cook the green beans a little longer.

YUM!  Super easy, and super delicious.  I did not have red wine vinegar, so I used all rice vinegar, cut down olive oil to 1/4 C, and added a splash of balsamic vinegar along with the Wocestershire.  Will definitely be making this again!

mmmmmmm...this was so good! I made the White Wine Vinaigrette from this site, and I also didn't use onion, and it turned out fine. The feta was good, but don't use more than the recipe calls for, or it's too overpowering. Thanks for the great recipe!

I steamed the beans, just added enough oil and vinegar to taste. I left out the sugar & put in 1/2 teaspoon  chili garlic sauce I used red onion & still put in the garlic. It was a nice touch with the feta.

Excellent recipe to use up some of those garden beans.  The dressing was perfect with the feta.

Very good, next time I would make onions smaller and maybe sauce them a little. Otherwise everyone loved them.

Very good.  That there is too much dressing is not a problem - just don't use more than 1/2 of it.  It's good enough to save it for another salad.

These beans are wonderfully tangy especially if allowed to sit overnight (really good that way). If the tang is too strong for you, or if you want something less tangy for a given meal, sub in some balsamic &/or add a touch of extra sugar! Halving the dressing works well if you prefer, but slipping in cucumbers after the beans are gone is fun too. I plan to make these whenever parboiling beans for other dishes, for make-ahead salads, &/or to use up bumper crops. These beans are good on their own or when they are worked into a sandwich or salad. First time around, I served them w/Greek styled meats to fill home made flat breads, all along w/traditional Greek green salad (complete w/lemon and mustard vinaigrette, olives, tomatoes & tomatoes). I wondered if the beans would merely blend into the salad. While they did blend in some, they still stood out in a very nice way in my humble opinion anyway. These beans would also be lovely w/ham (turkey ham of you prefer) on ciabatta, flat bread, or simply on a plain lettuce salad as well. Loved the idea one reviewer had of serving these without the cheese 'french fry style'./These were lovely as is, but I might try some of the suggestions of other reviewers at times (e.g-adding in red pepper, mushrooms, cucumber, sundried tomatoes, fresh oregano, &/or possibly even the fennel seed before marinating/and/or such as adding in grape or chopped tomatoes w/the cheese just before serving, or possibly even subbing blue cheese or mozz for feta).

Using half the liquids as many reviewers mentioned-this was awesome. And it got better each day it sat (didn't make it past three days and that was tripling the recipe!). Making this again really soon!

This was good once you got used to the vinegar taste. I liked it. I substituted red wine vinegar for rice wine vinegar.

Very tasty! I used probably half the amount of oil and vinegar called for (I never measure anything) and I used brown sugar instead of white. I didn't have time to let it marinate in the fridge but an hour of sitting on the counter was plenty. It made a nice side for the Blackened Tilapia from this site.

Sorry, we did not care for this recipe at all. Way too much vinegar - and we love vinegar-based recipes. My family ate just a few bites.

Awesome!!! I lessened the onion to 1/2 of quite a large one because I didn't have quite a pound and a half of green beans. Also, I used mozzarella cheese instead of feta (didn't have any feta). All else I kept the same. Absolutely fabulous!!!  I want to get more green beans to make more!!!!! Thanks for sharing.

This was very good.  The garlic was a little strong for our taste however, and I will cut it in half next time.
