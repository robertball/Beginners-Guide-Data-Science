I made this pie for my father's birthday and it was a big hit.  It was smooth and creamy and the crust was wonderful!

sooo good....I'll never go back to box cake again.  Note:  I accidentally used a can of dark cherries in heavy syrup instead of cherry pie filling and it still came out really good.

This pie was so good! I made it for my bible study and they ate every last crumb. gluten free vanilla oreos with the icing scraped off and ground into crumbs made a celiac-friendly crust. I will be making this again.

I made this for a casual dinner party and it wasn't a hit.  I cheated and used a pre-made Nilla wafer crust (which is slightly bigger than 8").  When I made the filling, it wasn't nearly enough to fill the crust (and I can't imagine it would have even filled a 6" crust), so I whipped up another batch to fill the crust. The filling has a gritty, sugary consistency.  Had I not doubled the chocolate, there would have been very little flavor, other than sugar.  The other reviews don't seem to be for this dessert, either, alluding to a "cake", so there wasn't much to go on there.  THANKS for the recipe!
