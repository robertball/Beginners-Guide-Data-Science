I just had to try these!  We were so pleased.  They were delicious.  I did make 2 alterations.  1) I grated about 1 ounce of cheddar cheese and added to the mix.  2) After frying the first batch, I decided to toss the tots into a small container of flour and lightly dust them before frying.  This kept them from "splintering" and leaving lots of crispies in the oil.  Next time I make them I will add only 1 tsp. of salt.  They were just a little salty and I like salty things!  Also, I don't have a piping bag and a baggie didn't work for this so I simply rolled a handful into "large cigars" before chilling, then slicing.  Mmm, anyway, they were very tasty and I will make again.

I was so happy to find this recipe after my son requested tater tots with supper. These were great. After making the potato mixture I seasoned with half the salt, tasted, and it was perfect. I also tripled the recipe. I didn't have a piping bag so I just rolled them into fat cigars. Rather than chilling them in the refrigerator I put them in the freezer, got them nice and firm and didn't have much of a problem with them falling apart. I fried them in batches and kept them in the freezer until each batch was ready for frying.

Fried as directed by the recipe they fall apart. I tried dredging in flour and frying with the same result. I baked the remainder in the oven and they were nothing but mush. Very hard to pick up but the flavor was excellent. I am going to try these again soon with some modification and update my review.
