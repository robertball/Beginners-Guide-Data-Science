I dont think I would normally rate a full 5 stars on something but this got a perfect on all of them! Its very easy to mix together as it does not get so hard like most cookie doughs and it doesnt require refridgeration. Its delicious with that authentic Snickerdoodle taste (much better than starbucks!). Theres virtually no baking time limit (8-16 minutes) as it does not burn easily. Very kid friendly. I would have loved rolling the dough into balls like playdough and rolling it in the cinnamonsugar. This would make an awesome cookie in a jar gift as it requires VERY little extra items. The cinnamon sugar can be packaged into smaller jelly jars that can be bought in supermarkets. I loved the cookies and everyone loved them. Not to sweet with the perfect snickerdoodle tang.

Now this is my kind of cookie!!! My daughter and I doubled the batch and I used shortening instead of butter.  Also, after we had rolled into balls (but BEFORE we put them on the cookie sheets) we rolled the balls into 1/2c sugar and 1/2tsp cinnamon mix.  Then, we took a glass cup and just flattened them ever so slightly.  The cookies baked perfect, looked great and tasted awesome! Slightly crunchy on the outside and soft inside.  The cinnamon/sugar mix really adds taste and I ate so many, I almost made myself sick! These dissapeared after two days and my boyfriend told me to next time, TRIPLE the batch!! Thanks Diane!!

I love this cookie in a jar recipe.  It made the best snickerdoodle cookies and they were very easy to do. I quit baking a long time ago because of the hassle of measuring and not have the ingredients, like cream of tartar, I needed to make the cookie I wanted. Now I make several jars up and everything is handy to make a quick treat without the hassle.  This one is my favorite so far.

Outstanding ... especially when I added 1 tablespoon (YES ... tablespoon!) of pure vanilla extract with the butter and eggs.  YUM ... made 5 dozen ... cookies will spread slightly so leave space between them.

Excellent!  Definately like the addition of the 1 tsp vanilla and then the nutmeg with the cinnamon and sugar.  My husband said these were perfect!  Oh, and with the crumbling and sticking to the pan, I just sprayed some Pam and had NO problems at all.

This is absolutely THE best snickerdoodle cookie recipe that I have EVER had!!!!  I don't do the jar thing so I can just make them right away because they're SO good!!  If you flatten them until they're like really thick pancakes, then they're perfectly crispy all over but not hard when they're done baking.  I've made double batches and have them disappear in one day!!  The recipe is absolutely fabulous and perfect for anyone who knows a great cookie when they taste one!

This is the best snickerdoodle recipe I've ever tried.  While pregnant with my son, I used to crave snickerdoodles, and would purchase these from Starbucks with a hot chocolate.  These are by far the closest recipe I've come across that is not only the same consistency, taste and texture, but also looks just like them.  

Too good to put in a jar - this has become the only recipe for this type of cookie in my house!

Fantastic!  Thanks Diane.  Made these for the usually finicky grandkids and they gobbled them up quickly!  I bake all cookies on parchment to prevent the sticking another reviewer mentioned.

sorry, but this is a time saver - it makes no sense to me.  Why put the dry mix in a jar?  Is this a gift without eggs & butter?  why not just make the cookies and put the recipe in your box?  I'm sure people would love to get the cookies made, not a jar of dry nothing.

I made massive amounts of this mix for Christmas and it was loved by all.  Instead of a jar, I used a heavy duty freezer zip lock and labeled them "Snickerdoodles in a Bag".  It was cheaper and very popular, will do it again for sure.

Best snickerdoodle recipe I've found. I was on a search for the perfect recipe and had tried many when I found this. Whenever I share them with friends they ask for the recipe.

I am not a Snickerdoodle cookie addict - I love to have chocolate in my cookies - but this is a delicous cookie!  I made it with butter flavored shortening since I was low on butter and they came out perfect - a bit crisp on the outside - but chewy in the middle.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla - just something I do with every cookie recipe.  One thing I do with my sugar cookies is add 1 tsp vanilla/1/2 tsp orange flavor and I bet that would work with this cookie also - just a a bit of a change.  These are now being made as 'cookie in a bag' to give out during the holidays.  Right now they're adorable with Fall/Halloween decorations on the bag with the recipe on the back of the bag.  Thanks for a great cookie!  Makes about 4 doz or so, plenty for our family...so on day three I can tell you that they were still nice, fresh and chewy.  The last two will be gone after I make my coffee this a.m.!

I made these to add to my goodie baskets for christmas.  I thought it was odd to give a gift of cookies in a jar when you had to add the cinnamon and sugar from your own pantry. I didn't feel right giving almost all of the ingredients.  I put the 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon in colored cling wrap and tied it with a bow.  I had room to put it inside my jar as I had extra room, but if you didn't you could tie it to the jar. Overall it turned out to be a nice gift

Sorry, this one just didn't work for me. I am so glad I tried this recipe first for two reasons. 1. The bottoms of the cookies stuck to the cookie sheet and were very messy and crumbly. 2. The presentation in the jar is not very attractive to give as a gift. People would at first wonder why you are giving them a jar of flour, which is what it looks like with the all-white mixture. I will stick to the pretty mixtures where the colors vary.

These got rave reviews as Christmas gifts.  Everyone said they were some of the best snickerdoodles they've ever had.  I also enjoyed making these... they are about 100x faster and easier to prepare than the layered cookie jars.  With pretty ribbon and fabric it doesn't matter that they don't have the layered look!  Something different is always a nice change.

I was making this for a silent auction. Thought that I had better see how good they are. Most excellent! The kids loved them and said they were better than the ones at the local grocery store. We are at a higher elevation so I did add 1-2 tablespoons of water to help the dough stick togther. It worked out really good! Thanks!

Definitely the easiest of jar mixes to make - and the results are great!  Our 3 dozen were gone in less than 24 hours!

These tasted good, but spread too thin for my preferences and were a bit too buttery.  I'd use less than 1 cup butter if I were to make it again.

I made a few of these and gave them as gift's for mother's day.  They were alright (the finished product), they could have been better...but for someone who cooks all the time I really suck at measuring dry ingredients!  So, it very well could have been my fault.  Everyone else seemed to love the cookies though, so maybe it was just me!  I still gave it 5 stars because the recipients of the gifts loved them.

Bought some cute xmas decorated asian style take-out boxes and was perusing recipes for xmas gifts. I saw the snickerdoodle recipe, thought I'd make it first before giving out the mix, 
OH MY!
These have got to be the best cookies i've had in a long time, yes, as someone said, and even my starbucks-employed son agreed, these are better than starbucks snickerdoodles. I only made minor changes, I used whole wheat flour, pressed slightly on the cookie before baking and baked at 300 for 15 min...

the recipe and the cookie were very good. I did have to add an extra bit of flour each time I make them. Very quick and easy for any of my kids to make.

These were the ultimate snickerdoodles! I didn't do the jar thing, and they were just perfect and chewy, great with a glass of milk. I did add a tablespoon of vanilla and they were yummy- gone in one night!

Ok- its like two months later and I'm making them tonight again!!! lol

Great recipe! I changed a few items, added vanilla extract (1 tsp.) & substituted cake flour (must add 5 tablespoons to 2 & 3/4 cups) & used shortening rather than butter. The result was more of a cake-like texture & less crispiness which is how my family enjoys it.

Great cookie recipe...a nice change from my family favorite of chocolate chip.  And to make it really good, it is next to impossible to over-cook these cookies! I forgot to time them and they were in there a good deal longer than 10 minutes, but they were still good.

I haven't made it (I prepared it as a gift) - but IT WOULDN'T FIT INTO THE JAR.  There is no way that quantity of dry ingredients is going to go into a quart Mason jar.  (And it didn't.  Simple math.)  I packaged it in a Ziploc, and added a smaller Ziploc of topping mix, and a plastic tub containing the eggs and butter, and left it in the workplace fridge (in a cute gift bag) for my Secret Santa.  I agree with the reviewer who said the other ingredients should be included if it's a gift (if possible).  Hope it tastes good!

Yum!  I made a batch before we started to mass produce the jars... and boy were they good!  I even made them vegan with egg replacer and earth balance - and you would have never known!  So good!
