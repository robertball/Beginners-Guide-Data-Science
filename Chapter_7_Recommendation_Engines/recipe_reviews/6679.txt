MMMMMMM MMMMM MMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!  This bread was sooooo good and so easy!  I made a few changes though:  Instead of dried minced onion, I used onion powder, and instead of dill seed, I used dried dill weed.  I also chopped up a big garlic dill pickle and mixed it into the dough.  I know it sounds weird, but it was really good like that, I highly recommend it!  Also, the bread looked gorgeous as a whole loaf and also looked nice cut in wedges.  It looked a lot harder than it was, and sooooo good!  My mom liked it, too.  I accidentally baked it 25 or 50 degrees hotter than it should have been, and that cut the cooking time down to about 25 minutes!

This came out really well. I made some changes out of neccesity and preference. I used two tablespoons of dill weed instead of the dill seed. I made two loaves in regular loaf pans rather than one in a 2 quart casserole. I made this into dilly cheese bread by patting out the risen dough into two rectangles the width of my bread pan and sprinkling with cheddar cheese. Then I rolled the dough up like a jelly roll and placed it in the pans with the seam at the bottom and baked the loaves for about 45 minutes. A little bit of cheese oozed out while baking, but the completed loaves have a swirl of cheese through them.

This was a good dill bread, however it was a bit dry.  If I try it again, I may add more milk.

This is very like a recipe that I got many years ago from a friend...hers was a batter bread but I did like this one.  This is a very good accompaniment to a hearty soup or stew.

This bread rose wonderfully.  I used 1/2 an onion instead of dried minced onion, and I sauteed the onion in butter(i used butter not margarine) before I added the cottage cheese.   I also used dill weed, not dill seed, just because that is what I had on hand.  I didn't add the salt on top.  This bread was delicious and very soft with a crusty crust.  Will certainly make this again, and very easy to make with kids around. (mine is almost 3)

I used to work at a bread company and this tastes almost exactly like the Dilly Bread they used to make. I use the dill weed instead of the seed. I would have used ground salt if I had it but I just used the regular stuff. Tastes ever better when it's cooled off because you can't taste all the flavors when it's warm out of the oven.

It is so great to see there are still bread recipes out there that are NOT for the bread machine. I don't have one (and haven't got counter space to think about getting one!). I am always disappointed when I read a recipe title that sounds good and then get into it and see it is for the machine. I went the dill weed route as well with this as I am not fond of the seed. I used about 2 tb of dill weed and 2 tsp of dried minced onion. I love this as a way to use up that cottage cheese lurking in the fridge!

This is the same recipe that my family has used since I was little. The only difference is we don't heat up the butter and cottage cheese. We just mix them right into the dough, this might help with the ones who said it was dry. I have personally made this bread over 100 times and it is never dry and as long as I keep it in a bag it is not dry the next day either. Also I always use bread flour it does make a difference and real butter over margarine will help with dryness (I have used all purpose flour and margarine and they don't give the same results). I have also made these into rolls by placing them in a muffin tin to rise and bake.

I made this last night and served it when my parents came over for dinner.  It got rave reviews from everyone!

I didn't have dill seed, so I used dill weed and I'd run out of minced onion so I just used some onion powder.  It turned out really well.  I've been munching on the leftovers today.  I will definitely make this one again!

This bread is excellent!  It's my new favorite food!  I used half spelt flour, and half brown flour.  Also, you need a little extra dill.  If you're using fresh dill, I would use a whole bunch finely chopped.  If you're using dried dill tops (which I used), I recommend 2 tablespoons.

I have used the "Dilly Bread" recipe for years, however, when I first found it, it said to use the cream cottage that was soured,or not fresh.  So when I have cc that is for most people ready to be thrown out, I make dilly bread w/it.  Waste want, want not!!! It gives the bread a sour-dough mild flavor, love it!!!

This bread did not disappoint!  The only changes I made were to the amount of dill and onion.  I used 2 tbsp of dill and 2 tsp of the minced onion.  I didn't have a casserole dish, so I split the dough in half and baked in 2 bread pans, resulting in two smaller loaves.  Baked for 30mins. Came out perfect!

I have been making this for years. Before that my mom made it and our family could never get enough. She would always make a double batch and it was gone in under 24 hours. I've never tried it with dill weed but I do go a little crazy with the dill seed. I use two tablespoons as opposed to two teaspoons. That was a mistake on my part when I first began to make it but I have never gone back. I also like the dried minced onion because it gives the bread a nice texture. It is also good bread without the dill at all (if you have a picky crowd). Most times I bake this in loaf pans because it is easier to slice and serve. Don't know if it is just my crummy oven but I cover the bread with foil to start with so that I don't over brown. I think I pull it off with 15 minutes to go. Might be time for me to whip up a batch...

Very good bread. Similar to a recipe I've had since the 70's Made exactly as written only baked in a loaf pan rather than the round casserole dish. I did use a rapid rise yeast and the crumb was very tender and very light. I don't know if it's the yeast that made the difference or not, but the bread I've had in the past was a bit denser. I do think I prefer a heavier bread, but this was very good too.

This was good stuff. I used dill weed instead of dill seed and made mini loafs so we could have mini sammiches. This is one that I will make again as it paired up well with ham and dill mayo =))

Fantastic bread! Especially great for when you don't want to get your hands and counter sticky from kneading. I used fat free cottage cheese and dried dill weed.

Very yummy!  My husband loved it warm and didn't even noticed the cottage cheese, which he normally hates.  I loved it cold because I could taste all the different flavors.

Hands down my fave bread!!!  I always have it on hand, make it at least once a week because it's the only bread we make sandwiches on!  I don't bake in a round roll, I actually make 2 loafs out of this recipe. I also don't add the salt to the top of the bread after it's cooked.... it's just too much salt for my taste.  I DO add 2tsp (or more) of DILL WEED in addition to the dill seed (but, my family REALLY likes the dill flavor... LOL!) I also use about 1 TBSP of the dried onion flakes.

This is a greatttt recipe. The bread was soft and delicious , i had it with some butter straight from the oven i even made heart shaped ones for my sweetheart who loved it and enjoyed it more because i added 1 cup whole wheat flour to substitute the white and i also added an extra pink of sugar. I used fat free cottage cheese for this in order to reduce fat content. I would recommend anyone to try it. Kneading by hand is much better than using the bread machine. Good stuff! Thanks . Stefy

Pretty good, but was a bit dry. Very good warm and fresh out of the oven, but the next day it had really dried out and wasn't great.

I've made this bread since I was a teenager (a long time ago!) and had lost my recipe. This is exactly the same one, thanks. I'm curious as to why you say it rises in the pan since your instructions are to let it rise in a greased bowl.

This is spectacular.  Easy.  Tasty.  Permenantly added to my recipe collection.

I just wanted to add that I have since made this and put in fresh basil in place of the dill and whole garlic cloves.  Delicious!

This was an awesome way to use up that last little bit of cottage  cheese left in the fridge!  I am not a huge fan of dill, so I used about a tablespoon of spaghetti seasoning instead.  Before baking, I also brushed the top of the bread with olive oil and sprinkled on parmesan cheese and more spaghetti seasoning.  It came out so chewy and moist, and tasted like focaccia.  Next time, I am going to try and make bread sticks out of the dough or maybe pizza crust.  Thanks for the recipe, I will making this bread again and again!

This is a great recipe as is. The loaf is very flavorful with good texture. This bread barely has time to cool down before it disappears!

Loved it. easy to make and the taste was wonderful.
I think my next round with it, I will take just a little flour out. Was a little bit hard to mix and a little heavy. But still a delicious peace of bread

I've been making this bread for at least 40 years,too, but my recipe is called Caraway Puffs. It calls for two tsp of caraway seed instead of dill seed. To make it more flavorful and "my own", I use a combination of caraway seed, celery seed, dill weed, and parsley. It probably equals about a Tbs  of herbs. Everyone raves about my cloverleaf rolls made with this recipe.

This is the exact recipe I have been using since the 80s.  I took this to many a potluck with rave reviews.  I could make this for very little money  and got a better reception than if I'd bought something more expensive.  I make mine in my food processor.  I use a wired thermometer with an alarm and bake it until it reaches 195 degrees internally.

This is a yummy bread that goes well with soups. I used butter instead of margarine as that stuff is toxic! Literally, don't buy it!

I made this yesterday to take to a fish fry. Everyone raved about it. I used dried fresh dill weed instead of seed but followed everything else a directed. I did not have to bake as long-it only took 30 minutes for a brown crust.  Will make again for sure.

Awesome recipe! My dad use to make this when I was a kid. I definitely recommend it. Used a little more dill weed and minced onion due to personal preference, will cut salt in half next time.  Give this a try!!!

This recipe is so good.  I haven't changed a thing, and this bakes beautifully at 8200 ft elevation.

I don't know, I couldn't get this bread to rise enough. I followed all the directions for the yeast and in the recipe, but it seemed like it should have risen more. It was just dense and didn't taste like much. Not sure what the dilly was. (see what I did there)

Needs a little extra dill seed and salt on top. My Hubby loves this and ate himself almost sick.

This is like a recipe I used to make by hand but now I use this recipe in my bread machine. I prefer to chop up about 1/2 cup of onions instead of using minced. Instead of slicing the bread, I cut it into squares or chunks.  My whole family loves it.   This is a great recipe as it is or you can also let the bread machine mix it and then put it into a casserole dish and bake.

I've had a similar recipe for years, but this tasted much better than I remember.  I,  like others, used dill weed instead of seed.  Also, I used bread flour in place of all-purpose.  It takes around three hours from start to finish.  Although it is tasty either warm or cold, we prefer it warm served with any soup.  Delicious!!

Very tasty bread!  I subbed 1/4 cup quinoa flour for white.  I let it rise in my preheated clothes dryer.  That worked great.  Lite texture, a little oily.  I think next time I make this I'll use garlic instead of dill.  Might make it again tomorrow!

I had had a similar recipe from family members which I'd used for years until I found this one.  This version is superior!  Warming the cheese and margarine really improved the outcome!  Thanks.

My family did not care for this bread and it turned out very compact, but since I am the minority here, I will make again to make sure that I did not screw something up and then re-rate to be fair.

My first experience with Dilly Bread was at a church social so I immediately had to find a recipe and make it myself.  It is a very nice change and simple to prepare.  
I'll be making it again and again.  Thanks!
