I made these for a banquet dinner and they flew off the table!    I made some minor adjustments.  I added 1/2 C. Parmesan to the dough, then after dipping into the butter, I dipped them into more shredded Parmesan.    I added Garlic Pwdr and Parsley to the butter.   The directions weren't very clear so what I did was after I cut them into their strips, I had another pan with the melted butter/garlic/parsley mix.  I rolled them in the butter then dipped 1 side into the cheese.  I then twisted the dough stick several times, and placed on parchment lined pan.  Baked and HOLY COW Yummy!  Try 'em!

These were very good....however.....I added a lot of minced garlic to my melted butter for some flavor, then twisted the bread sticks. For not having any yeast in them, I was pretty impressed. After reading some of the reviews, I was expecting a "biscuit." I wouldn't go as far as calling them biscuits. They're better than that. I did expect them to be more "buttery" when they came out of the oven. The baking time was also a little long for my oven. They took less than 15 minutes at 450 degrees - and I didn't get 24 breadsticks because I cut mine into 1 inch strips rather than 1/2 inch strips. They made a really good side for homemade pizza with some marinara. Next time, I may brush them with melted butter when they're done and sprinkle with some parmesan cheese. I will make these again. Very, very easy and tasty. My family really liked them.

Better than I expected for something that was so easy to make! I used garlic salt and added some parmesan cheese to the butter. The breadsticks were the perfect compliment to our beef barley soup on this cold winter day!

I rolled out the dough and cut strips using a pizza cutter. Leaving the strips on the board I brushed them with melted butter then sprinkled with parmesan, garlic seasoning and paprika for color. It was easy to pick them up and twist. They were excellent. Even sent them to a potluck! Serve them standing in a vase for Wow-factor.

Perfect recipe for an hor d'voeuvre.  I was looking for a recipe which wasn't so much like pizza dough, and this is very light.  It's a little bland, so really needs some sort of dip.  I also sprinkled Parmesan Cheese and Kosher salt on top.  I also took another reviewer's suggestion of giving it a twist and looks great.  One last suggestion is to use a pizza cutter to cut the dough into strips- makes it very easy.

These are a wonderful recipe for breadsticks- especially if you're in a hurry. I made these with "Friendship Soup Mix" (made the soup) and they were wonderful. I was a bit worried how I would knead them due to the fact that the dough was very sticky. I ended up covering the surface liberally, and the top of the dough before I started kneading. I still had some sticky fingers, but kept at it (adding flour as needed) and it came together beautifully.  I ended up twisting them as well. They taste wonderful and are the perfect (inexpensive) accompaniment to the soup!

This recipe is from a cook book I have- everything, including the name of the recipe, is exactly the same.  I've been making it for 10 years, it was the first bread-like recipe I ever made as a 16 year old in my mother's kitchen.  They're really good bread sticks and ridiculously easy to make!  It's true that they do turn out biscuity, but that's part of their charm I think and what can you expect from a recipe without yeast that's so fast to make?  I mean, you don't even have to cut shortening into flour first.  My only changes are to use 2 cups of unsifted flour (instead of 2 1/4 sifted), a whole stick of butter, and I put a clove or two of minced garlic on top of the butter before it goes in the oven so it gets a little cooked.  The resulting garlic bread sticks are amazing.

We really liked these.  I did add 1/2 cup parmesan cheese to the batter.  I also added some garlic powder to the butter and sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top of the breadsticks before baking.  I did cut into 1 inch strips instead of 1/2 inch strips.  It took about 15 minutes for these to cook.  I also twisted the breadsticks; it made them look very pretty!  All in all, it was fairly easy, very good tasting and pretty presentation.  I will plan on making these next time I want breadsticks.

I needed a quick breadstick to go with our stew and this is what I was looking for!  Didn't hear the timer go off so I think they got a little crispier than supposed to.  oops!  I added a little bit more flour, the dough was a little sticky.  It was really good! Thanks!

Very tasty! I agree, they're more biscuity than true breadsticks, but they're easy and good! I rolled mine in wheat bran and sesame seeds, and gently dabbed some olive oil along the top of each before putting them in the oven. I didn't use the butter at all, and baked for 10 min.

I just finished eating one of these delicious breadsticks tonight. I baked these to go along side pasta fagouli soup and I was so glad that I did. This was my first attempt at making homemade bread sticks. I added a 1/2 cup parmesiana cheese to the flour mixture before adding the milk. I added a dash of garlic powder, sprinkle of oregano and basil to the melted butter. I topped them off with extra parmesiana cheese prior to baking. These garlic herb bread sticks tasted and looked similar to those at Pizza Hut. They were delicious in the pasta fagouili soup or just eaten alone! I definitely would recommend this recipe to friends and family! Manja!

This is a recipe that I've made a lot in the past and is perfect when you don't have time to let bread rise but want to serve bread with a meal.  They taste great and is very quick and easy to make.

These turned out great! I disagree that these taste like biscuits,they did remind me of the pizza hut bread sticks some. I removed the breadsticks from the butter and put back in the oven for about 5 minutes to crisp.Delis..

I like these but they taste like biscuit instead of breadsticks but almost all the other breadstick recipes that I tryed do. I add galic salt and power to the mix and roll them out thin and twist them and they was really good. taste like breadsticks then.

This is a really good recipe, it tastes more like a biscuit than a breadstick. Next time I will try it with a little garlic and cheese.

Pretty good, but definitely biscuit-y.

I mixed some pureed roasted garlic with the butter I rolled them in and it was goooooood...

Might make them again, might not... If so I'll definitely be using more butter & topping them with cheese.

This turned out very well.  I added  grated Parmesan, onion powder, garlic powder and a small bit of Nutritional yeast to the dough.  Halved the recipe.  They came out perfect.  We used Pizza sauce as a dip.

Made as directed without adding garlic or parmesan.  Pretty good, and my family liked them.  DO NOT let them cook 15-20 minutes at 450 degrees, though, or you will have sticks of black char!  Mine were starting to blacken after about 5-7 mins.

These are GREAT! I also added about a 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese to the batter and added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the melted butter. I cooked the breadsticks on a stoneware baking sheet and placed them close together so not to brown all of the sides. My husband loved them with spaghetti. This will will be a must with any soup or Italian meal.

unbelievably easy and quick, and really impressive!!! nobody can't think how you made breadsticks in such a little time, you grab the ingredients and pop them into the oven.  I added dry rosemary but I guess parmesan and flaked onion would have been great as well. Thanks a lot

This was a quick and easy breadstick recipe.  Perfect with Baked Ziti.  It was as others said a bit sticky, but hey just add a smidgen more flour when rolling out.  And don't roll too thin.  I brushed in the pan and out of the pan with some butter, but also topped with some salt at the end.  Perfecto!!!

Nice and quick! I made it with 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all-purpose... Tasted great with vegetable soup...

This wasn't very good. Like others have said, they turned out more like biscuits and didn't have much flavor. I won't be making these again.

These really did taste more like a biscuit than breadsticks.  Might be okay every once and a while, but not the texture i want in a true breadstick.

Easy!! This was so easy to make! I did add alot of minced garlic to butter and mozzerella cheese on top but other than that i followed the recipe. My kids (ages 2 to 17)loved them and diffently want me to make them again. Great basic recipe!!

This is a great recipe for breadsticks. I did make an addition. After baking, I brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with a combination of parmesan cheese and italian spices. Will definitely make again

I halved the receipe and took the strips and dragged them through melted butter and also dusted with parm. cheese, twisted and dusted with the cheese again,as suggested by another member.These do not rise to much, so twisting them gives them some height. Will make again. Thanks for the receipe

These were very good--just add a little garlic powder or salt to the butter, and they have a good garlic taste to them!

This was quick and easy... I added a little parmasen cheese to the dough then sprinkled garlic powder and parmesan cheese on top before baking.  They were wonderful!
