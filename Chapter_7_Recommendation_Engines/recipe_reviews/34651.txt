this was my first time cooking monkfish, and i'm totally hooked.  i took the advise of some other reviewers  (and that of my fishmonger) and removed the fish from the pan after browning it.  i added it back to the garlic, tomato & mushroom mix with the wine and parsley.  served it with tagliatelle and steamed sugarsnaps.  great introduction to monkfish! :)

Changed the recipe slightly by frying off the monkfish in the seasoned flour to make it crispy, then removed it from the pan and added the wine and boiled it down with the rest of the seasoned flour and added some french mustard.  Then I baked the fish with the mushrooms and tomoatoes (also added some olives and sundried tomoatoes) in the wine sauce.  It was delicious.  My fiance said it was the best white fish he had ever had!

A very good basic recipe for creating an 'ala provincial' dish. But I seasoned the flour, and added a bit more of white wine and garlic. It turned out terrific!

Loved it!! However...instead of 1 1/2 pounds of monkfish I used 1 pound and added a 1/2 pound of sea scallops.  I cooked it as per directions and it was delicious!! I used Di Lupo Pinot Grigio which is an Italian white wine.  I served it over a thin piece of multi-grain toast instead of pasta or rice to soak up the sauce and with a side of string beans that I sauteed with a touch of canola oil, sesame seed, ground ginger and celery seed.

Yeah!  We really loved this recipe.  I browned the fish and removed it from the pan while cooking the mushrooms, etc. I added it back in with the wine and the parsley.  I also sprinkled some additional cajun seasoning in the pan (I used Penzey's hot cajun). I would be proud to make this for company!

I followed the recipe exactly as is and it was devine!  I used "Jacobs Creek" Chardonnay which was recommended by someone I asked in the liquor store and that worked nicely for this dish.  I would definately make this again!

Very good! I used Cayenne instead of Cajun since that's what was in my cupboard and it gave it a good flavor kick. I also substituted a can of diced herb flavored tomatoes for the tomato which added a really nice taste. Very good recipe and nice way to dress up monkfish!

Something wasn't quite right with this recipe. I followed directions, removed the fish after browning as suggested by others, but the coating got mushy & there wasn't very much liquid left over to serve over rice. Not a big hit w/me.

The recipe is simple and the results are outstanding. I removed the fish after browning, and returned it to the pan at the end to be sure not to overcook. It was perfect!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I've had monkfish several years ago and have never been able to find it anywhere in Chicago.  When I saw it on sale at my local grocery store I immediately picked up serveral pounds of it but wasn't sure how to cook it.....until I found this recipe.  So tasty and tender and it does REMIND me of lobster.  I followed some of the older reviews and made a few adjustments to the recipe.  Like, cooking the fish first and then setting it to the side.  Turned out great!!!!  Oh and it doesn't taste like lobster....only reminds me of lobster.  It's like those people who tell you "it taste like chicken" so you have your mouth set for chicken, and it taste NOTHING like chicken.  This only has the texture of lobster.

AWESOME DISH! I didn't have any mushrooms so I substituted an orange bell pepper (thinking the sweet would go well with the spicy) and it did. :) I also used a can of diced tomatoes (drained) in place of the tomatoe. Absolutely wonderful. I will definitely make it again and again.

I saw Gordon Ramsay use monkfish, and knew I had to try it. OMG. This is awesome! If you have never tried monkfish and you are looking for a recipe. Don't look any further. This is the only one you will ever need!!

if you are having monkfish for the first time this is the recipe to try!  It was beyond delicious. The fish cooked to perfection. Also a great presentation.  I would make it for company.  I did what others suggested and did the fish, removed it from the pan, put it back in after doing the mushrooms/garlic/tomatoes/wine/parsley.  Other than that small change this recipe was spot on with everything from timing to flavors.  Oh I used 1/2 of a drained 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoe.  we served it with a tomatoe herb couscous and fresh broccoli.  a quick and easy meal the whole family raved about.  will make again for sure.

This a regular meal as my local grocery store often has fresh monkfish in the seafood section. I include some chopped shallot with the garlic for the initial saute before adding the mushrooms. The diced tomato goes in last and I wait until everything sweats out just a bit before adding wine. There is usually a bottle of dry vermouth in the fridge and if I don't have any white wine the vermouth is a fine flavor match. In winter if I don't find large tomatoes that I like, a pile of halved grape tomatoes substitutes well.

I make the recipe as given. Monkfish with a light kiss of cajun seasoning and a dusting of flour color nicely in a hot pan with some oil (I blend olive and grapeseed oils) and there is no need for long cooking as the fish is returned to the pan later. I leave everything in the pan after frying the fish adding a bit more oil if the shallots and garlic seem dry. When the alcohol has mostly cooked out I turn off the heat, return the fish to the pan, gently mix, and cover for just a few minutes before serving.

The dish came out very good. The mushroom/garlic/tomato sauce was amazing!!! The fish was tasty but it seemed that maybe I didn't cook it long enough... It was my first time trying monkfish, and I put 4 stars because it wasn't the best fish I 've ever tried but I will make it again.

This recipe is awesome, with some changes. I use almond flour as regular flour is REAL bad for you as is all processed foods. I also use pasture or organic butter to avoid the growth hormones and antibiotics used in dairy cows. Put this on top of brown rice or even better yet, bulgur or quinoa pilaf!

I made it for my wife and she loved it too. We had all the ingredients except fresh parsley so I used dried.  I cooked all the stuff together.  I would not want it crispy anyway and all the flavors can mélange together that way. I just lightly dusted the monkfish pieces which I cut into 1 1/2 inch nuggets. I used corn based spaghetti. Wow is all I can say! I used a pound of monkfish and one roma tomato was plenty.

Definitely cook the fish and put it aside, otherwise it will get soggy in the veggie juices and wine. I added a little bit of fresh basil and green peppers. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I like monkfish, my husband doesn't, but he loved this!  I had grape tomatoes so cut up them up in place of a bigger tomato. I used Herbes de Provence, a little red pepper and fresh thyme in place of cajun seasons. I left the monkfish chunks in the whole time and a little extra to get it done.  Served it on a bed of French green lentils. The mushrooms and tomatoes made sauce and the flour coating thickened it perfectly.  It was delicious and will be how I cook monkfish from now on.

I love this recipe, made it with monk fish was easy to follow added capers for that piccata taste, also added some fresh herbs to the flower mix and cilantro to the sauce this was my second time making it and we love it.  Monk fish is not always readily available, but when i do get it this will be my go to recipe for it.  

thank you

My local fish store was running a sale on monkfish. Had never cooked this fish before but knew I liked it from having eaten it in restaurants. Randomly chose this recipe as it looked easy and different. So glad I tried it. This dish was delicious. Restaurant quality. Was not sure how much Cajun seasoning to use with flour. Used about 1 tbsp along with the red pepper flakes which gave it a little bit of heat but was not overwhelming. A definite keeper.

This recipe was excellent.  I used more mushrooms and tomatoes and wine to make more sauce.  Lots of Emerils Cajun seasoning.   Lots of butter.  The result was awesome.  I will do this again.

I was a bit nervous to try monkfish, however, my  husband & I loved this recipe. Monkfish is not always available where we live in the northeast,  but  from now on, I will look for it and make double!

Wow this is one delicious dish! Always loved monkfish and this recipe is a keeper. Had 5 bottles of red wine, no white so used cooking sherry and it was delicious. Served with sesame snow peas and water chestnuts.

Great recepie! I use the marinate it says but did not add the flour neither salt because the seafood seasoning has salt. I added one lemon juice in the plastic bag.

The recipe is good. The sauce was delicious. After I made it per recipe, the taste was good but not enough spices.  After I added some spices to my taste, everybody in my family loved sauce, but everybody did not like the taste of monkfish. It has a smell that reminds me of catfish and swamp. I will never buy monkfish again.

Monkfish is great, but typically kind of expensive ($13 to $15 a pound).   I went into our local H-Mart Asian store and saw it on sale whole body with skin, no head for $6 a pound, normally only $7, so I bought 4 pounds of it and increased the quantities accordingly, though I had to use a big wok, since it would no longer fit in a skillet.  I found it was very easy to skin and filet compared to other fish I've struggled with.  I cooked it pretty much like the recipe, but if I'd read the reviews I would have removed the fish after cooking.  3 minutes didn't seem enough, so since I had a larger recipe I doubled the times.  I didn't think it would have as much liquid as it turned out to have, much like a brown gravy.  It was delicious; my wife gave it the 5 stars, though I would probably give it 4.

This was a delicious recipe! I have to say, I agree with the reviews that said to add more spinach. The recipe calls for way too little spinach. I more than doubled the amount and still could have added more. My husband and I both loved it! I forgot to add the mushrooms and it was really good even without them.

This was nice and easy and quite tasty.  Modifications included using Old Bay seasoning instead of cajun, and we we added brocolli and yellow squash in addition to the tomato and mushrooms -- made a quite festive dish!

I skipped the cajun seasoning (as I cannot eat anything even mildly spicy) so instead added some nutritional yeast to the flour along with the salt and pepper, and it turned out very tasty. I also covered the pan and let the fish simmer for the last couple of minutes of the cooking process. The fish (monkfish in mine) was tender and moist, with a delicate flavour. Very nice!

This was a quick and tasty way to cook Monkfish.  I did alter the Recipe though.  I added a Dash of Ground (Cayenne)Red Pepper versus the Cajun Seasoning.  I used a Blood Orange Fused Fresh Olive Oil.  I added Chopped Zucchini, Onions, and Green and Orange Peppers, along with Canned Mushrooms, and Fresh Roma Tomatoes.  I also used Taylor's Dry Sherry.  Since we receive a Community Supported Fish Share, we don't always get to chose the Type of Fish we get each week, so this was a nice way to cook our First Batch of Monkfish.  Thank you for the Recipe.

Made this tonight as written except added salt/pepper/seasoning directly to the fish versus to flour then lightly coated in plain flour.  It is quick and excellent!

I made this recipe with Swai fish, which is a white fish from Vietnam. It was delicious! Will definitely be making this one again!
