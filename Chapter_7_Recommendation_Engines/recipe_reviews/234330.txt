I'd give this one a 6 or 7 but that's not an option so I will settle for a 5. I used canned beets to make this quick and easy. I had some Feta in the fridge that I wanted to use and it went well with this salad. It is also pretty to look at with all the colors.

Really did not enjoy the taste -- too much lemon rind.  It is missing something but for me not worth making.
