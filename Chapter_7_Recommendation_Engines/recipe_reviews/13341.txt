Yuck. There wasn't enough liquid. I added beef broth to make more liquid but this recipe was still bad. I'm throwing it out.

Practically spaghetti. Useless as a soup. Oregano in a soup? Seriously. I practically had to re-create it. Added water beef boullion cubes skip the oregano. Now you have a stew. A very tomato-ey stew.

Not enough liquid. Added 4 cups of water and about a tablespoon of Better than Boullion Beef flavor. Still not really enough liquid. The idea was good and it turned out ok after a few additions.

Oregano in soup is just fine (reminds me of my g-ma's albondigas). This soup was a good starting point for use w/ground beef but something was missing. I'm not an impromptu cook so I couldn't figure out what could have made it a little better. Nothing wrong with it just could use some more flavor. Cumin maybe? Red pepper? As I said I don't have a talent in this area. Thanks for the submission idea.

The original recipe is from the back of a can of Del Monte stewed tomatoes. The one listed here is missing 2 cans of beef broth. I also add 2 cloves of crushed garlic. I've made this many times and it's a great quick soup.

12.14.15 The recipe reviewers are correct you will need to add some stock/broth to this soup and add some seasonings. It all comes together quickly and easily and making a few adjustments didn t seem like such a big deal to me. I added some sliced celery had a little bit of Fideo and small seashell pasta so just combined the two in place of the noodles threw in a bay leaf and a few other spices and simmered for about half an hour. No it s not rich homemade vegetable soup but if you think of this as a starting point for a quick veggie soup and just use your personal taste I don't think you'll be disappointed. Enjoyed today for lunch and I d make this again.
