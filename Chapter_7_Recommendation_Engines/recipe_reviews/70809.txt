I am the submitter of the recipe and forgot to mention that the avocado should be mashed up and to mix in pomegranate seeds, not whole pomegranate. Sorry.

Homemade guacamole is so much better! And this recipe is fantastic. I made a bit more than the recipe called for: 6 avocados, 3 finely diced pears, 1 finely diced small onion, about 2 cups of green grapes that I quartered because they were huge, the seeds from 1 pomegranate, the juice from 1 large lime, and two de-seeded serrano peppers. I had no idea how many seeds one pomegranate produces, but found just 1 to be plenty for my liking. And I'd be careful with the serrano peppers unless you know you like things hot. I only used two (and de-seeded them as well) to make sure my spice intolerant family members will actually be able to eat it. I can't wait to bring it to our Christmas festivities!

I loved this twist on traditional guacamole.  The only substitution I made for this recipe is using red grapes for the green.  My grocery didn't have any green grapes in stock.  The flavor was sweet/spicy and I did get a couple of thumbs up when I brought it to a family Christmas gathering.  

This recipe is a keeper for foodies like myself!

my roommate found this recipe and we loved it.  We used red grapes since that was what we had in the house and omitted the serrano chile peppers, instead we used some chile and cayenne powder.  All of the different flavors were a great combination.  Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe

i like to try new and unique flavors..and this fit the bill. I was unsure of the recipe, so only made 1/2 batch.  Don't make the same mistake! My daughter and I LOVED this! would definately make again..and again. Not only was it pretty, it appealed to even those unsure of guacamole. Good job!

This guacamole rated the approval of both my 15-year-old son at home and 50-something office mates at work! It's quick, easy and looks pretty at a holiday dinner.  I've already made it several times in the last month.  Oh, and it's healthy too!

Love this recipe! Very different, and very delicious! I was nervous at first about adding the fruit, but it turned out great! My family is super picky and they loved it. I only used 2 chile peppers, and that was plenty. And I've made it a few times now, with and without the grapes, I prefer it without. But it's good either way.

Excellent twist on guacamole.  The juxtaposition of the peppers and fruit makes it an exciting change.  

Unless you're feeding a large party, you'll want to cut the recipe down.

I was very skeptical about this recipe. But I had red and green tortilla chips that I wanted to use at my Christmas buffet. I made this exactly as written. And it was a real hit. Unusual, but very tasty. I had some left over, only because I had so much food, and the next day I thought it was even better. Donâ€™t be afraid of this one.

I make this every year for our bell choir holiday party - everyone loves it.  I am not allowed to show up without it!  I like to quarter the grapes.

My friends/family can't handle hot anything so I omitted the chile peppers. Winner! Everyone loved it.

Made this for my roommates, who both loved it. One said it's not only her favorite guac recipe, but one of her favorite recipes overall! The only change we made was adding some chopped cilantro.
