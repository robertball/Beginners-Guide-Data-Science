Fabluous!!! My wife picked up steelhead from Costco by mistake, thinking it was salmon.  We grilled half of it with our regular salmon recipe, and it was lacking something.  So I found this recipe for the other half, and it was incredible!  And the recipe couldn't be easier.  I'll be buying steelhead from now on. Thank you Internet and Google for landing me on this recipe.

Outstanding taste and very simple to prepare.  I had the butcher remove the skin and purchased one pound for the two of us.  I'm headed back to the market today to get more, now that we know how delicious it is!  Followed the recipe to the "T" except that cooking time was 10 and 5, rather than 10 and 2.  I created a "boat" with the foil to keep the extra juices from spilling out.   Thanks for introducing us to this fabulous fish!

Oh my goodness!!!  This was so good I don't think words can really explain how good this is!  The trout was on sale at our local market and we had never heard of Steelhead trout but thought we'd try it.  We will make this again!!!

I have a standby maple-glaze recipe for steelhead and/or salmon but tonight just wanted something quicker, but still flavourful. This recipe sounded odd at first, but reading the reviews and seeing how easy it was to prep, I figured I'd try it and I LOVED IT! I will be passing this along to friends and family and it will become my easier standby steelhead recipe.

This is the best !!!! My son went shopping with his mom at Costco and he chose this. We had never  eaten Steelhead before. I didn't even know how to cook this. I got online and saw this recipe just like some of the others I said" bbq sauce??". So I gave it a shot, Well I'll tell you I'm cooking this at least twice a month and will recommend to all of my fish loving friends..

I was a bit hesitant to make BBQ fish, but this recipe was absolutely delicious!  I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I used ground black pepper and it still came out great.  Quick and easy, I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Very Good. Instead of aluminum I cooked the fish on one of those mesh screens made specifically for the bbq. Now I can't wait to try bbq sauce on other types of fish.

Not really sure how this one is a 5 star. I made this exactly as written except I baked it in the oven. There was not really flavor and it was a little sweet which I didn't like. I ended up drizzling it with soy sauce. Didn't even eat the leftovers :( I had such high hopes for this one too.  No more bbq fish.

Wonderful, I accidentally bought quite a bit of steelhead trout at a club store instead of salmon, and was pretty mad when I figured it out.  I made the first portion of the fist with a dill and onion mixture and hated it.  Then I made the last portion using this recipe, and my husband and I both love it.  My husband woke up in the middle of the night and ate all the leftovers lol!  Thanks to this recipe I might actually buy steelhead trout intentionally this time.

I accidentally bought this at Costco thinking it was salmon.  It looks just like salmon!  Tonight was the first time we had steelhead trout - - and it will NOT be the last.  This fish was delicious....so moist and rich.  It was more mild than salmon, in my opinion.  I baked this at 400 degrees for 15 minutes in a convection oven and it was done perfectly.  Thanks for a great recipe, zeppelon68.  I can't wait to try this on the grill this summer.

This was an excellent recipe. Due to it being so cold outside, I baked the 2 lb fillet in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. I then brushed it with the barbeque sauce and broiled it for 5 more minutes. It turned out fantastic.

I see many reviewers picked this up at Costco!  Well, I did too.  I had never heard of it and love to try new things, so picked one up.  I knew allrecipes would have a recipe for it!  I was happy to find this one.  Wow, very, very good.  I didn't have lemon juice or paprika on hand, so made it with just the other ingredients and it was delicious!  I cooked in the oven in a cast iron skillet at 350 for 25 minutes total, adding the bbq the last 10 minutes. I will definitely be buying steelhead trout again.  Especially because it is so cheap and so yummy!  Next time I will try with the lemon and paprika, but at least I know I don't need it for it to taste good.

Barbequed trout certainly sounds interesting, but this was great!!  Full of just the right amount of flavor.  The only change I made was adding garlic powder.  Delicious!

I couldn't imagine BBQ sauce on fish but was intrigued enough to try it.  I was amazed by how good this was!  We enjoyed this twist on Steelhead Trout. This recipe is a keeper!

Amazing recipe! I was skeptical to use bbq sauce on fish but it turned wonderful! It doesn't really taste like barbequed fish, the sauce gives it a smoked flavor that even my 5 year old will eat (and has requested more than once) This recipe's a keeper! :o) Thanks for sharing!

Like everyone else says...so simple and yet delicious!  I grilled some veggies on the bbq at the same time and it was a very quick and nutritious meal.  This will definitely become part of the regular meal plan.

I can honeslty say steelhead trout has an amazing flavor which I much prefer over salmon.  The barbequed method is tasty but another great way to cook it is to lightly coat it with olive oil and then sprinkle with fresh oregano and a small amount of garlic powder!  Wonderful seasoned like this on the grill!!!

this has become one of our favorites. If you aren't a big Salmon lover, try steelhead trout. Much milder flavor and this is such a great recipe for it.

Surprisingly delicious! Steelhead Trout is on sale here in Palm Springs pretty regularly too, so will definitely be making this often. Can't tell you how much we enjoyed it. Thanks so much for sharing, zeppelin68!

Excellent on the Steelhead my brother caught.  Cooked on the BBQ on cedar grilling planks, which added a great flavor.  Served it to my family and they loved it.  Followed the recipe as written, but added some chopped garlic to it.  Will definitely do again and again!

Excellent as listed...I did add a little garlic to the butter/spice mix though. Simple, quick and very tasty.

OK,  I also bought the Steelhead from Costco (by the way, no skin).  I wanted to try it.   I didn't know what kind of BBQ sauce to use ( i had Sweet Baby Rays  Sweet and Spicy and The Raspberry Chipotle, but didn't want to  use them because they seemed too spicy) so I took he advice of another reviewer and  made a four serving of  Popular BBQ sauce.  It was fantastic.  I baked it on foil that i built up the edges on so it wouldn't run off.  I baked it  at 400 degrees for about  17 minutes and then put the  BBQ sauce  on and baked for about two minutes more and then under the broiler for an additional 1 or 2 minutes

I changed this recipe quite a bit I used the juice of 1 large lemon along with the grated lemon rind.  I added White Pepper, Cajun seasoning and Cilantro

I'm joining the ranks of those who meant to purchase salmon, got careless, and came home with steelhead, only to find out they liked it even better!  This recipe is quick and easy.  I followed all directions except that I put it on the grill - 10 min., then 2 w/ bbq sauce.  Everyone served gave it a 5!

Awesome!  Very easy and very good.  I used olive oil & butter and a low sugar/low salt BBQ sauce.  It was great. Great with veggies and hot wheat rolls for a quick, healthy meal.

Like others I was skeptical about using bbq sauce on fish but this turned out to be a fantastic recipe, everyone in the family raved about it. We added a little more smoke flavor by cooking the fish on cedar planks and the result was fabulous! Very quick and easy too!

Fabulous.  Have never put BBQ sauce on fish before and was a little leery, but this was fantastic.  Only thing I did different was bake it in the oven.  Can't wait to make again.

This is a great recipe and definitely not one that I would have ever come up with on my own!  I have cooked this several times....both on the grill and in the oven on a broiler pan.  I have used several different types of bbq sauce, depending on the mood I'm in and it's always yummy.  I wouldn't change a thing with the recipe. :)

My kids absolutely love it and ask for it often. A big hit at my house!  Thank you!

This recipe is sooooo good! I used rainbow trout instead of steelhead because that's just what I had.  The sauce was so easy to make, I had everything in my fridge already.  It was a perfect flavor for fish.  It wasn't too heavy and didn't overpower the fish flavor.  I am a huge fan of this recipe and will use it over and over again!

Excellent!  The BBQ taste is not strong and does not overpower the trout.  I broiled mine for about 15 min.  It tastes very similar to salmon to me.

Excellent recipe. 

Had bought two pieces of steelhead for half off thinking it would be like salmon. The first piece I did as I would do salmon and it was so bad I almost threw away the second. My wife wouldn't eat it. Glad I found this here.

Followed this recipe fairly close. I used Bay's Seasoning instead of the cayenne and paprika. I did not cook mine in the foil, and I don't think the original recipe calls to since we need to oil the grate - I may be wrong. 

Cooked for ten minutes straight on the grill. My piece was thick, so flipped it for three minutes. Back over and then with the BBQ sauce for five or so.

All of us went for seconds!

This dish was easy to make, easy to clean up after, and DELICIOUS!!! I'm not a big fish eater but my honey and I caught some trout and decided to cook them. I replaced the cayenne pepper with chili powder because i don't like spicy and added a few sprinkles of garlic powder. Absolutely LOVED this dish! So did honey!!

FANTASTIC!  I am not a big fish eater, but am trying!  The fish looked really nice and I had never heard of it.  I used the recipe as written and I was thrilled!  YUM!  Very easy!  My filet was thicker, so it did take longer than 10 min..  The BBQ sauce was subtle, added a nice flavor, but didn't over take the fish.  This was not fishy AT ALL!  As I say again,  FANTASTIC!  YUMMY!

I eat steelhead trout on a regular basis, so the fish itself wasn't new to me. I followed the recipe, but then added Cholula to the sauce. I will likely experiment with some other spices, as well. This lacked a bit of zip, but was a good basis for adding additional flavors.

I baked this in the oven for about 15 minutes at 450 degrees F.  The amount of barbeque sauce was just perfect.  I hate eating any sort of meat where its swimming in barbeque sauce to the point that's all you can taste.  This recipe is not like that at all. Tasty.

This is a great recipe. I'm not a big Salmon fan, but my wife is so I cook it every once in a while. Decided to try Steelhead Trout. I love this fish and this recipe. We used Colorado spice seasoning and plain Kraft BBQ sauce. Great, even the skin was good. Make sure you have a hot fire and cook skin side down first longer than on the flesh side. Simple, easy and little clean up.

Like many of the reviewers I accidently bought the steelhead thinking it was salmon at my local Costco. But I do not regret it. This was fantastic. Thanks for the recipe. I will be makeing again. There wasn't enough to go around.

This was so good! I made it with the "Zippy Barbecue Sauce" recipe on this site, and was blown away, both by how good it was and by the foot-high flames that erupted when the butter mixture dripped into the coals. Ha! I'd recommend this to anyone finding themselves with an unexpected steelhead trout on their hands, as curiously seems to often be the case.

I used the butter mixture (substituting olive oil because I had more) to marinate the fish for an hour or so and that worked as well.  The bbq was a nice touch.

I, like most people said on here, bought the "wrong" fish at Costco.  After one failed attempt at cooking it one night, I was on the edge of throwing it away UNTIL I found your recipe.  Simply, delicious and I thank you.  I did substitute olive oil for the butter, added a bit more pepper and added chopped garlic to the marinade !!  W.O.W. I will definitely be cooking this again and again.  Served with steamed veggies, salad and roasted potatoes. ;)

This was a good recipe. Like many other reviewers I accidentally bought this at Costco thinking it was salmon. Grrr... I was online immediately trying to figure out what to do with it! it was a fun new way to try fish. My only complaint was that it came out really oily. I think it was just too much butter (and I only used 2 TBL). I will leave it out altogether next time.

I tried the recipe for the grilling sauce, but was very disappointed, The overwhelming flavor was BBQ sauce, so next time I'll just use that, alone.  Why add all the calories from the butter?

Wow. My boyfriend and I gobbled this down in no time. I used the recipe 'Bar-B-Que Sauce' from this site as my BBQ sauce, but my boyfriend and I were very tempted to eat the fish with just the lemon butter on it.
Anyone who's still on the fence about BBQ fish, don't worry, it works and it works well!

Caught a nice steelhead in Ohio and had never cooked one. Looking for fast and did not expect excellent also. Tried it again tonight and again excellent. Even my daughter first said "Ewww" but was back for seconds. Thanks for the recipe..

1st time eating steelhead trout and I'm not a big fish lover, but trying to like it more. This was delicious, not at all fishy tasting. The barbeue sauce at the end was subtle and gave a great taste. My husband, who loves all kinds of fish, thoroughly enjoyed this and said we will have to make it again!  Thank you for the recipe.

This was the best tasting Steelehead I've ever had!  I never thought of putting BBQ sauce on fish before but it was awesome! My daughter (not a big fish fan) commented that it tasted like chicken. She actually had seconds!

This was a very good recipe! It was easy and quick and most ingrediants you always have on hand. The only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is if you like your food well seasoned (which I do) then this could use a lil bit of season salt and pepper. I also used the lemon butter mixture as a base for some of the other filets and then used old bay seasoning on the rest of the fish, I use just a light sprinkle of sugar on top of those to give them hint of sweetness- it turned out FANTASTIC. This recipe is a must try!

I got steelhead trout to make and was looking for a recipe and found this one. When I told my wife what I was making she gave me a funny look. That look changed when she ate it. She loved it and now wants to make it more often. This is a wonderful recipe and would highly recommend it.

I thought it was good but it would have been better if my husband didn't decided it needed to go with noodles so while making them, I think it overcooked just from keeping it warm. But the flavor wasn't amazing. It was good. No regrets.

Initial baste is not particularly noticeable, but the ultimate product is totally dependent on the type/brand of BBQ sauce you use. This needs trial and error to figure out. Tomato, mustard, or vinegar based sauces produce results. Tomato based I used was just ok.

Disappointing.  Don't understand all the 4 and 5 star reviews.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy bbq sauce....a different one might have been a slightly better match, but even with that change, I can only imagine this being  "okay" at best.  Bland, uninteresting.

Loved it! The fish is really good, it doesn’t have a strong taste like salmon but still very flavourful. I I didn’t have lemon juice at the time and it still turned out great. I also used olive oil instead of butter. I especially liked the bbq sauce, it wasn’t overwhelming at all and complimented the fish very well. Definitely a keeper!

First time making Steelhead and first time using barbeque sauce on fish.  It was an okay combination.. something different to break up the normal fish dishes.  I love trout but the barbeque sauce idea was only loved by 1 of the 5 that ate it.  I think I will use less butter and lemon (had leftovers and it was still too much) and just enjoy the trout with a few spices.  This was a sub for Salmon night which I will forgo this recipe and stick with other glazes (soy, brown sugar, dijon mustard and ginger).

Sauce was a bit more watery than I normally like, and would try to thicken it next time. It was tasty and will make it again. It looks like Salmon, but flavor isn't as strong.

Very good.  I've never had trout before, so when the grocery store had it on sale, I bought some.  I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce. I will make it again.

This is wonderful.  My only change was to bake it in the oven since our grill is put away for the winter.  I baked it on a foil lined cookie sheet at 350 for about 5 mins then added the sauce and cooked it until it flaked nicely.  I finished it up under the broiler for about 1-2 mins.

My husband caught lake trout yesterday so that is the fish I used.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I sprayed heavy duty foil with cooking spray and made sure the fish was dry before putting in on.  I did brush both sides with the melted butter and spices (I think this helped the skin to come out perfectly crispy).  

I think next time I would add quite a bit more cayenne, only because I love the heat.  But even as directed, it was fabulous!  The flavors weren't overpowering and allowed the mild flavor of the lake trout to come through.  Will definitely make this again!

This is my go 2 recipe for Rainbow Trout. Have made several  times. So Yummy. Follow the recipe to a T. BBQ at 40O  ,lower heat  ,when just tender,add the bbq sauce. Slightly fold over edges of tin foil ,leave space..close lid , cook another few minutes..So yummy. I grew up with fisherman's dinners ...this is a good fish recipe.

It was ok. It took a little getting used to, the bbq sauce I used seemed too sweet for the fish, but I ate my piece, and the kids' pieces, since they didn't like it. That's not a reflection on the recipe though! It was tasty, but in the end it seemed like I was eating BBQ sauce and not fish. I may make it again though...

Outstanding!    We used trout filets with skin still on.   After basting with butter mixture on skinless side, cooked it skin side down on the grill until just about done, covered filets with BBQ sauce and flipped for last minutes removing skin just before serving.  Simple yet delicious!!

This was, without question, the best fish I have EVER eaten anywhere. I cannot recommend this more highly. We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. I did end up with unused butter mixture. The amount of time listed was perfect for medium heat on my gas grill. DH declared it tasted like incredibly tender bbq chicken, without even a hint of fishiness. What a great way to eat a healthy fish that is on Seafood Watch's best choices list. 
For those who do not normally cook fish (and this would be a fabulous way to start!): Remember the trout stays on the foil during cooking, and trout fillets do not get turned. The skin side stays down, which protects the tender meat and keeps it most. Don't worry about trying to get the skin off, just serve it the way it was cooked. You simply lift the meat off the skin with your fork, and enjoy!

Delicious!  I usually do Chef John's "fast salmon with a ginger glaze", but opted for trout tonight.  The glaze/marinate caused  the fish to taste great.. I think.  First time I've had trout.  It was wonderful.  If I'm grilling fish it's usually  salmon, bass, or talipia.  Trout stayed together better than talipia and on par with bass and salmon.

This is an easy and tasty way to make lake trout.  We did think that it was a tad sweet so the next time we make this we are trying it without the barbecue sauce finish.  We grilled for about 12 minutes at 400 degrees.

Who knew?! I've never thought to put bbq sauce on fish, but we all (husband, 12 year old son, and I) enjoyed it very much. This was our first time trying steelhead trout, and it is just like salmon but milder. The only changes I made were to add a little minced garlic and liquid smoke (since I didn't have a cedar plank, which is how I usually cook fish). I may have used a tad less cayenne too to ensure my son could handle it. It wasn't spicy at all so I'd add the full amount next time. I will definitely make this again and would probably score the fish and push the butter sauce into it and cook just a minute or two less. Thank you for a new grilled fish experience!

Perfect!  Eliminated the butter completely and subbed in just a little olive oil, and it was still wonderful.

I never would have thought BBQ and trout would combine well, but this really was delicious.  The trout I had was cut rather thick, and only the outer parts had good BBQ flavor.  So I recommend you cut the fish somewhat thin (1 inch or less) to get the full flavor.

I put this delicious trout atop a arugula and spinach salad with a warm cider vinaigrette.  I served with croissants and voila a salad my husband thoroughly enjoyed.  Next time I would cut down on the butter a bit.  Note: It was the winter so i put it in the oven under the broiler for about 10 minutes then basted with bbq sauce and continued to broil for about another 5 minutes.

Great! Good recipe for people who aren't akin to the "fish" flavor in seafood. We used stubs BBQ sauce because it isn't as sweet and an extra teaspoon of lemon. My boyfriend devoured it and he doesn't like fish. I would definitely make it again!

This is a wonderful recipe, just as it is.  I was concerned the bbq sauce would be overpowering, but was glad to be proven wrong. I'm sure it will become one of our favorite ways to fix salmon or steelhead.  Quick, easy, and delicious!

After starting this recipe I realized I was out of BBQ sauce so I quickly searched the site for a homemade BBQ sauce and found it- "A Very Popular BBQ Sauce". I quickly made it and then incorporated it into this recipe.  Wow!! It is fantastic.  I will say that this recipe will probably be different for each person depending on the type of BBQ sauce used as it is quite a substantial ingredient to the recipe. The lemon juice and paprika do something to the sauce indescribable.
I will make this again and again.  And as for the BBQ sauce, forget the store bought and try this one.
Thanks for a great recipe.

This is great! I , too, have never cooked trout and it was impressive tasting! very moist. My filet was fairly thick so it took longer than 10 minutes until it flaked. yummmm! thank you!
