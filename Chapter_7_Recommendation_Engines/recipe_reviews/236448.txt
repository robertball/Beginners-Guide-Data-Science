Was very different and good but I should have stayed with the recipe as far as lime juice. The reviews said less but needs it. I also added portobello mushrooms. Needs more broccoli, garlic, and a little oil. Delish!

Definitely a little different. It felt more like a pasta salad than a pasta main dish, but this is not a bad thing. The lime gave it a nice zip. I made the recipe way smaller and still had a ton of leftovers after dinner for two, so I can't even picture how much the full recipe would make. I don't like broccoli so I added a zucchini and a portobello mushroom instead. I also used a red onion. I had originally given this recipe a 4/5 and written that I wouldn't make it a weekly meal but it has become one of our all time favourites. Basically like mixing guacamole with a delicious roasted vegetable pasta--yum!

It tasted great but too much pasta! Next time we will use just 1 box of pasta, not two. (unless you are feeding an army.)

I made veggies per recipe but forgot to turn halfway though so I just turned at the end and left in the oven turned off. The avocado mix I made into a sauce I used lemon juice and end up adding cilantro dressing to give it more flavor and a little hot sauce.

Substituted in green peppers due to availability. Try it with a dash of soy sauce - it ended up complimenting the dish super well!

So this dish taste so yummy. My husband couldn't believe it was vegan. It has a fresh tangy was to it. It has a bit on a prep time but nothing to crazy. It's one of our favorites and we make it like once a week now.

I like all these parts, roasted veggies, guacamole, and pasta..but together it didn't work for me. the guac is too mild to stand out with the pasta and doesn't mesh with the roasted veggies.

I liked it. I would definitely go with less lime and less salt next time, but otherwise this will be one I try again.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious.  My anti Vegan husband actually went back for seconds.  Side note, unless you're making this for a dinner party, or you have a Brady Bunch sized family, 1/2 this one.  2 boxes of pasta make a lot of leftovers.

I really enjoyed this dish; it feels very fresh and bright.  The sauce coats everything nicely but does not feel heavy.  When the warmer weather finally arrives I would like to have this for dinner on my patio.  I doubled the broccoli because mine seemed a little on the small side and left out the onion because we don't care for it.  My vegetables only took about 20 minutes to become blackened.  This is a great recipe, even for meat eaters!
