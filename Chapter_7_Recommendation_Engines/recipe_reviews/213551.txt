In Quebec cuisine, cretons (sometimes gorton or corton, especially among New Englanders of Quebec origin) is a pork spread containing onions and spices. Due to its fatty texture and taste, it resembles French rillettes. Cretons are usually served on toast as part of a traditional Quebec breakfast.

Thank you! My grandmother made this each Christmas Eve. We would tease each other that the only 'real' French-Canadiens in the family would eat it. Delicious on white bread fresh from the bakery or bread-maker with gulden's brown mustard. I couldn't even spell this, but I found what I was looking for and am going to make it Christmas Eve.

I made this for a potluck and flavors are so much more complex than the recipe implies.  People scarfed it down and it was one of the first dishes to be cleaned out.  One thing that I would appreciate with the recipe is a little bit of acid.  I tried splashing some cider vinegar but after sampling it seemed dangerous so I stopped.  I'll play around with it a little more and figure out what I like: white vinegar?, wine?, citrus?, ???  But it's still pretty awesome as it is.

just something missing. not enough tang to the taste. doesn't spread smoothly as it should. crumbles and falls apart. not easy to spread but the batter came out as smooth as can be. family used half pork butt and half ground beef. maybe the fat from beef gave it the needed consistency it needs and the flavor it is missing. it is not a very good recipe if i must experiment to get it up to par, but it is a good recipe as a starting point.

Just the way my mom made it. Only, don't use mustard, use ketchup.
