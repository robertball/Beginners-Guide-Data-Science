These are great appetizers. I ommitted the pimento and the water chestnuts, adding a bit more parmesan.

I used about 1/2 cup green onions no pimentos or water chestnuts.  I put a litle parm cheese in the crab mix while cooking it plus a healthy amount of garlic and onion powders.  I also used some sesame oil in the bottom of the baking dish along with several pats of butter.  Had to drain it after about 35 minutes in the oven at 325 covered, finished it off for 10 minutes under the broiler at 400 to give it some brown.  I loved these!  This recipe was a great place to start for me.  Careful with the dijon mustard though...

These are FANTASTIC!!!!  Even my boyfriend, who is terribly finicky, loved these.  Also, you can put them together and refrigerate them until you are ready to bake them.  WONDERFUL!

They were pretty good but I had better. I added a bit more cream cheese, used lump crab and left out the water chestnuts. Maybe adding another squeeze of mustard but with the price of crab I may try with imatiation crab and tweet flavor a bit more.

Too much trouble. Too many other ingredients interfere with the dleicate flavor of the crab.

These were OK...  I thought they were pretty good, but I took them to a party and they just didnt' go over very well.  Someone actually told me not to bother making them again.  They were just kind of bland.  They were missing something, and I just can't figure out what it was....

This recipe is very easy! This was a test for my Super Bowl Buffet menu. They were a big hit. So these crab stuffed mushrooms will hit the buffet table for the Big Game!

Great appetizer... the water chestnuts and pimentos make a nice difference with this. I used low fat cream cheese and it worked just fine.   Thanks for sharing this little beauty.

I almost never make things exactly to recipe so here are my changes: Green onions instead of white, two cloves of garlic, crushed, when it was all done cooking I added salt, black pepper and a couple pinches of crushed red pepper. I omitted the pimento peppers and while it was cooking I didnt use all butter, I did half butter half EVOO, this made it a little runny so I added some grated parm/ramano cheese to thicken it up. So the calorie saving trick did not work. I had some left over mix and it was great as a dip with tortilla chips! I hope this helps!

These take quite a bit of work, but are definitely worth it. It's been a while since I made them (years, actually) and I've never forgotten how good they are. Off to the store to get the ingredients! YUM!!

These are excellent, a big hit with the adults in my family. I cut the mustard in half and didn't use peppers- but they were absolutely delicious! They have been saved in my recipe book as a favorite.

Great recipe. I used a stone ground mustard I had on hand and some white wine in place of the dijon mustard. I also subbed green pepper in place of the pimento (because that was all I had). I mixed EVO with a smaller amount of butter to coat the shrooms and then topped all with shredded, aged, sharp provolone. Very tasty. As always, I appreciate your sharing of this. Thank you!

The only change I made to this recipe is half the pimento's because I don't like them a whole lot. I know they are in there for a reason, so I did not want to ommit them completley. Everything else was followed exactly as written. I prepared the filling the day before and then assembled them when we where ready to eat. AMAZING I will never make another kind of stuffed mushroom!

Thought I would try stuffed shrooms with cream cheese for a change. I guess it's an ok recipe if you like warm cream cheese. I'm not a fan.

I made these exactly as the recipe instructed and they might possibly be the best things I've ever put in my mouth!  I had leftover stuffing after filling the mushroom caps, so I served it on the side and it disappeared FAST.  Delicious!  I don't understand why people CHANGE the recipe then give it less than five stars.  Idiocy. Don't change a thing. Perfection.

My husband and I love this appetizer, we have had them for supper along with a salad.  I added more crab, decreased the Dijon mustard to 1 1/2 T, deleted the water chestnuts and increased the amount of Parmesan cheese.

I have never been a big mushroom eater and especially when they are by themselves, however, this recipe was pretty amazing. I don't shop often for mushrooms, so I found a 1 pound thing of mushrooms and got that. MAKE sure you get large mushrooms, or the packages with the most large mushrooms in it. There were some small ones in mine that I just threw into a separate dish and threw some filling on top of it and ate it that way. 
If you don't have large mushrooms, this can still work, however, to make this work with smaller mushrooms, make sure you finely chop everything or else the filling won't fit into the mushroom well.
Overall I enjoyed this meal greatly. The Parmesan added a good flavor to it.
