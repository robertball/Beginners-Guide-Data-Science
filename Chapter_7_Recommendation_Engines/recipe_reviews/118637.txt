Unseasoned cooked ground beef is kind of gross, even when topped with lettuce coated with ranch. The beef needs taco seasoning or something. Not exactly "outrageous", but an easy weeknight recipe once you make that improvement.

I didn't make it without taco seasoning.  I don't think I would have liked it.  So, it was good, but basically it's just substituting ranch for sour cream as a normal taco topping.
