If you leave out the packaged taco seasoning packet, and just bump up your other seasonings, & with about a 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch for thickening, you will avoid the saltiness (plus the additives & preservatives) of the pre packaged and it is great.  Add onion or whatever other spices you like in your tacos or burritos.  Tasty.

The best way to shred this is to put the chicken in the crockpot. I used 3 frozen chicken breasts. Mixed all of the ingredients(decreased the taco seasoning and cumin per the reviews) and poured it over the chicken. I I cooked it for about 3 1/2 hours. This is the mexican version of the Zesty Slow Cooer Chicken Barbeque. You can make changes anyway and I don't think you could screw it up. Simple and good.

I make this in the crockpot, only make sure to use low sodium taco seasoning mix.  I think McCormick makes it.  This is one of my favorite easy recipes!

I put my frozen chicken in the crock pot and covered it with plenty of enchilada sauce(out of tomato sauce) and then the salsa and other seasonings.  I use my own taco seasonings I make (taco seasoning I) which works wonderfully because you control the amount of salt.  Other than the enchilada sauce, I followed the recipe.  Cooked the frozen chicken on hi for 4 hours, then it turned to warm until I got home.  I shredded the chicken, wrapped it in tortillas, sprinkled with cheese and then poured the left over sauce from the crock pot over the enchiladas...nothing was wasted.  Good...Quick...Easy!

Excellent!  I used the 'Taco Seasoning I' recipe (on this site) instead of the store packet, and omitted the cumin and chili (it's already in the seasoning).  Mixed this with the tomatoe sauce and salsa and poured it onto the chicken in a slow cooker.  After shredding the meat, I added a can of refried beans and heated that through in the slow cooker.  Put mixture in large burrito style shells, added tomatoe, some more salsa, and cheddar cheese.  Wrapped 5 of these and placed in 9 x 13 baking pan, topped with enchilada sauce, green onions, monterey jack and cheddar cheese.  Baked at 375F for about 15 minutes, and voila!

I just have to say that this recipe had the most amazing flavor.  I couldn't stop eating it before the rest of the food was done!  I didn't use it as a burrito filling though.  I came up with a great idea of using it as a filler for Won-Tons. I put about 2 teaspoons of the filling inside, rolled them up, and fried them.  They were so good!  My boyfriend dipped them in sour cream and salsa and he loved them also.  Thank you so much!  I will definitely make this over and over again.

I made this today in my Lil' Dipper Crockpot. I used homemade salsa, homemade taco seasoning and california ground chili powder. Even cooked in the crockpot it turned out juicy and flavorful--perfect taco meat. I made taco salad bowls using my Perfect Tortilla taco bowl pans and making little bowls of toppings. The family thought this was delicious!

Too salty with the multitude of seasonings.  I'd suggest the chili powder and cumin and leave out the taco seasoning.

This was a HUGE hit with my husband!  I ommitted the hot sauce and used only 3/4 of the taco seasoning.  Still very flavorful! Added white rice flavored with chicken bouillon, fat free refried beans, low fat sour cream, and shredded cheddar to make the most delicious burritos ever! This will definitely be entered into heavy rotation at our house! Thanks!

I've made this for my husband and me several times.  It is a huge hit each and every time!  After I cook the chicken, I add it to a skillet along with cooked rice, black beans, tomatoes, and fresh cilantro -- just to allow it to heat through -- and then fill large flour tortillas with the mixture.  It's absolutely wonderful!  I know that the leftovers won't sit for long.  Thanks so much for the recipe, Juli!

Absolutely wonderful! I used some in wraps, some in hard shells (my boys preference), and some in a "taco" salad (without the shell to save on calories). It was excellent. Will definitely be making this again. I did add a bit more salsa, jalapenos (we like spicy), and used the 15 oz can of tomato sauce.

Toss the cooked chicken breasts into my Kitchen-aid mixer with the paddle attachment and shredded them perfectly in just a few seconds.

I use this recipe all of the time for a lot of different mexican dishes.  I just throw all of the ingredients in my slow cooker and cook for about 8 hours on low/medium.  The chicken practically shreds itself - so easy and yummy!

Exactly what I was looking for, I made this in the slow cooker and I doubled the salsa and tomato sauce. I also added half of a can of diced tomatoes with the juice, and onions. I put in the chicken still frozen and seasoned to my taste. I cooked it on high for about 4 hours then shredded the chicken and turned the heat to keep warm until ready to eat.

This is a great recipe. I used 8 oz of salsa and did my own spices (tumeric, garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, and dried onion flakes) instead of taco seasoning. Turned out delicious.

I used 3 large frozen boneless chicken breasts, cooked in crockpot for 4 hours on high.  I used the taco seasoning recipe from this site and added a can of Rotel tomatoes (partially drained).  Once chicken was done, I took it out and shreaded it.  I put about 1/4 cup of liquid back into chicken and mixed it up.  Then I took the remaining liquid and pureed it.  Cooked pureed mixture on stove top with a pinch of cocoa and a pinch of garlic powder and a little corn starch to thicken it.  Then I put chicken mixture and cheese in flour tortillas and rolled up, put in pan, poured sauce on top and sprinkled cheese on top, put in oven till cheese was melted.  My family loved it and fought over the last one!

Easy to make and hubby loved it! I used Mexican style diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of tomato sauce (whirled it in food processor first) but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Great garlic spicy flavor!

I've used this recipe for a couple years now.  It's so tasty to use in burritos, enchiladas, soft tacos, etc.  It goes a pretty long way, too, depending on what dish you make.  I've taken to making my own taco seasoning, but either that or the packet works well.  This recipe is very adaptable to your taste (i.e. I never use hot sauce -- cuz I'm weak sauce!).

I put 2 chicken breasts, 1/2 cup salsa, 8oz tomato sauce, a can of nonfat refried beans, and Taco Seasoning I (recommended from the site) in a crock pot for 4hrs on high, w/ med/low setting for the last hr. Shredded the chicken 2-3 hours in.

Initial verdict after 2 hrs: Too much taco seasoning as written (I stupidly left it at the 10 servings level). Next time I'd decrease to 4. The chili flavor was too strong. I'm noticing other reviewers included an extra chicken breast (3 for 4 servings) so that probably helped keep the seasoning from being too strong. The spices are overwhelming, especially the chili powder. I added 1 cup of cheese and bumped up the salsa to 1 cup but it still didn't mitigate the overpowering taste. 

Verdict after 4.5 hours of cooking in the crock pot: WOW the flavors really do need time to blend together and the spices aren't as overpowering after they've cooked for awhile. What a difference from the initial taste! Next time, I'll use 1/2 the Taco Season I ('cause it was still a little salty & the chili flavor was still kind of strong) and add 1/2 - 1 cup more of cheese. I might also try adding an extra chicken breast. Also, use burrito-size tortillas or they're too small and the filling bursts out! I learned my lesson the hard way :)

This was enough filling for 10 8 inch & 1 burrito size tortillas. All in all, this was SUPEReasy to make in the crock pot. It was my first time using it and I'm a believer now! :)

I make one similar to this in my crockpot. I put chicken parts, usually breast and thighs  in the crock pot . I season it with homemade taco seasoning.I add one 18 oz jar of salsa , we like On the Border, Hot. I cook on low about 6 hours  and stir in about a  half cup  to a cup of sour cream.I serve it over rice. I shred the leftovers for burritos the next meal.  My husband cant get enough

Great, simple recipe with lots of taste.  Garnish with sour cream, guacamole (or plain avocados), fresh chopped tomatoes, grated cheddar, refried beans and lettuce, and it's a meal in a minute.  The 2 chicken breasts make enough for at least 4, so it's a great way to stretch meat.  Love it!

When I hit the review button, a review I'd already done came up.  I didn't realize I'd made this before... and gave it a 5 the last time too. :-)  I made the filling as is, and did not think it too salty or spicy, and in fact, think that leaving out that much taco seasoning would make it bland.  I used it to make enchiladas this time - it was enough to fill about 10 of the 6".  I tried to keep it simple by putting a little cheddar cheese inside the tortilla, baking and then adding some Jack cheese on top for the last few minutes.  A little more cheese and it would've been perfect - I don't think the filling needs much help from other ingredients.  I'd also like to try this as a taco or tostada filling.  As a note, mine had to cook way more than 20 minutes before it was done.  I don't know what that was about, but it just didn't seem to cook well just sitting in sauce like that.

This was great.  I didn't have any sauce, so I put three chicken breasts in the crock pot with a can of tomatoes with chilies and 2 TBS taco seasoning.  Cooked all day and shredded it and mixed salsa in to fill tacos with.  Yummy.  I bet this would freeze well.

Ooh!  We really liked this.  Of course, being one with an inability to follow recipes verbatim, I made some (just a few!) modifications; some, per users suggestions; some, to get rid of ingredients I had on hand.  I put 3 frozen chicken breasts in a slow cooker, used an 11 oz can of tomato sauce instead of 4oz, added a can of Rotel (diced tomatoes with chilies)  and about 3/4 cups of chopped onions, and only added 1/2-3/4 of the packet of taco seasoning.  I also added about 3/4 cups of water.  Slow cooked on high for 3.5 hours.  I was able to break apart the chicken after 2.5 hours.  Served with a bit of cheese (Kraft Mexican Blend) and sour cream in a tortilla wrap (Ole Xtreme Wellness High Fiber Low Carb keeps the meal in the healthy-zone and still tastes good :).

P.S.  I cubed sweet potatoes, microwaved for about 9 minutes and added to the slow cooker with about 45 minutes left to go.  They made a great healthy side dish when served with some extra sauce.  So yummy!

Delicious and Super Easy! 
Like most everyone else I cut the taco seasoning. I did 1/4-1/2 a packet of taco seasoning, garlic, and chili powder, I left out the cumin and hot sauce. I put frozen chicken in the crock pot and covered it with the mix on low for 8 hours and it shredded perfectly when I got home! I combined this with refried beans, rice, cheese, sour cream and it was so yummy! This will definitely be on my list to make often!

While this recipe is a good starting point, a few alterations bring it through the roof. Skil the extra chili powder and add a little bit of oregano. Chili powder is usually a mixture of cayenne, oregano, garlic, cumin and salt. Taco seasoning tends to have many of these ingredients already, so to add more is a bit redundant and likely to make your dish too salty. I also added about 1/3 c chopped onion, 1/3 c diced tomato and 1/2 can of black beans. The kind of salsa wasn't specified, so I went with Pace Chunky. With these changes, it made THE best taco filling I've ever had. Basically, experiment! Try adding the kinds of things you normally associate with tacos, adjust the seasonings if you like things a little different.

After reading other reviews, I modified a bit, just because I was in a bit of a hurry.  I used frozen, raw chicken tenders (about 6 to 8) and put them in a slow cooker.  I mixed a 10 oz can of green chili enchalada sauce, a 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, 1/2 cup salsa, 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, 1 tsp cumen, 1 tsp chili powder, a dash of garlic powder and a can of black beans, rinsed and drained in a bowl.  Poured it over the frozen chicken tenders and mixed it up a little.  Put the slow cooker on high for about 2 1/2 hours.  Chicken was done and very tender.  Then I shredded it a bit using the 2 fork method, but leaving it a bit chunky.  We scooped it into wheat tortilla shells and topped it with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, taco cheese and black olives.  VERY GOOD.  Took less then 10 minutes to throw everything together in the slow cooker, so it was super simple.  I used the chicken tenders because I knew they would cook faster than the chicken breasts.  Will definately be adding this one to our favorites and passing it on to others.

I've been making this recipe for years, and it's my fiancee's favorite. We use the filling for either soft or hard shells. I like to add in some chopped onions and jalapenos also. I also use Peach Pinapple Salsa. It seems to give it a sweet but spicy taste. If there is leftovers I use it in some enchiladas the next day

Very simple and easy to make. Hubby loved it! I did use chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts (they were on sale) and I also reduced the taco seasoning mix to 3 Tablespoons. Will make again. Thanks.

5 stars all the way! This was so easy and tasty.  I made mine in a crock pot and the chicken almost shredded itself.  Instead of the tomato sauce I used a can of Ro-tel's tomato and green chilis.  It makes it extra spicey the way we like it.  I will make a bigger batch of this next time and freeze it. Thanks

This is really good.  I used 6 boneless chicken breasts, two large cans of tomato sauce and one package of taco seasoning.  Was a big hit and very simple.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a recipe to use some left over chicken and this one was perfect. I had to change the recipe for the already cooked chicken. I also skipped the taco seasoning and made my own salsa to add and it was a great fast and easy recipe. I will use it again!

My roommate and I liked this very much. I made it and added half a cup of water after I pulled apart the ckicken breasts, then served in in 6 (not 4) tortillas with cheese, sour cream, and green onions in the tortillas, and hot salsa, cheddar cheese and green onions on top. Delicious, and will kick a cold out of anyone!

I've used this recipe several times since I printed it off a few months ago.  My husband and I are big fans of spicy & Mexican foods, and this recipe suits our tastes. I have left out the cumin, which doesn't seem to matter- it's still great!
     Leftovers work well poured over nacho chips, topped with cheddar cheese, and heated until the cheese melts. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was delicious! I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used some chicken stock instead. I know the two aren't really interchangeable, but it turned out great. I will definitely make this again!

Followed the recipe as stated, even using the taco packet, and it turned out great.  Great flavor and simple to make.  Put a spoonful in the center of a flour tortilla and top with cheese and sour cream.

I think this is the first 5 star recipe I've given on here.  This stuff is INCREDIBLE. I made it last night.  I was using frozen chicken breasts so I boiled and shredded them before hand.  After this went pretty much the same route as the recipe suggested.  I did not use the entire package of taco seasoning.  I believe it is a bit more than needed and I was right.  I used about 3/4 of the package and it came out PERFECT.  This will definitely be a regular in my diet.

Tasty. I through all of the ingredients along with frozen chicken breast in my slow cooker and cooked on low for about 6 hours. Wrapped in tortillas with black beans and poured salsa over the top, baking for 20  min, then topping with lots of mexican blend shredded cheese and baking until melted. Mmm. Thanks for the recipe:)

I thought this was wonderful! I put this in the crockpot for 3 1/2hrs. I used 3/4pk taco seasoning and left out the cumin and hot sauce. Placed filling in flour tortillas and topped burrito with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese, and sour cream. It tasted even better than our favorite local Mexican restaurant chicken burrito supremes! LOVED IT and SOOO EASY!

Cut back on the taco seasoning and I threw the whole works in my slowcooker than added some rice before it was done. So good!  It was a little dry the next day so I had to add a little more salsa to moisten it.  Served it on tortillas with cheddar cheese sprinkled on top.  Will make again!  Thanks!

I made this in the crockpot by putting 3 frozen chicken breasts in and pouring the rest of the ingredients on top. Then I cooked it for 3.5 hours on low, shredded the chicken, and let it cook on low for another hour. Turned out perfect.

Very good and I was happy that it was so quick.  I would prefer more tomatoes, so I think next time I'll add a can of Rotel tomatoes & chiles.

This recipe is terrific!  After reading some of the other reviews I did make some changes.  I substituted a can of Rotel with Cilantro and Lime for the salsa and used cumin, chili powder, garlic and chipotle seasoning instead of the taco mix to cut back on the salt.  I cooked it all in a crock pot so the chicken shreds easily and added a can of black beans right at the end.  I served it on large wrap tortillas and sprinkled it with cheddar cheese just before rolling.  The only change I would make next time is to drain the Rotel before adding.  As it was, though, it made an incredibly wonderful spicy chicken stew!

ABSOLUTELTY FANTASTIC!
This filling is brilliant! It is so tasty and I love the texture!  I have used it to make baked burritos, tacos, and even quesadillas.  Served baked burritos to guests and they were all raving about it.

I wish I could give this recipe more stars!!!  Absolutely fantastic!  I used a hot taco seasoning mix and let it marinate in the fridge overnight.  The next day I got ooh so many smooches from my sweetie!  We both fell in love with this yummy recipe in burritos and are looking forward to experimenting with the leftovers!  Thank you!

So YUMMY!
My chicken was difficult to shred. Next time I am going to add more liquid to the chicken (broth maybe?) to sort of let it poach. I think that will do trick to make it more tender!

I doubled the tomato sauce (who has ever heard of a 4 oz can of tomato sauce?) and the salsa (I used a chipoltle salsa which gave the dish a nice smokey taste).  

After it was cooked, I added 4 cups of cooked yellow rice and a 15 oz can of black beans, rinsed.  This mixture yielded 8 huge burritos, half of which I froze (we'll see how they come out), the other half of which I topped with more salsa, shredded Mexican cheese blend and baked in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutues.

I LOVE this recipe and so does my hubby.  The only deviation I made from the original recipe is that I cook it in the Crock-Pot for approximately 3.5 hours.  DELICIOUS!

Leave out the taco seasoning and just increase the cumin and chili powder.  Made for some really tasty burritos when paired with refried beans and cheese inside that tortilla.  Like others, I also cooked on low in the crock all day then baked for about 10 minutes once assembled.  Good eats.

I made this in the slow cooker. I didn't add the chilli or cumin as the taco seasoning already had it in. Cooked on low for 7 hours. I served in tortillas with cheese, and sour cream. Thanks for a great family meal Jubeefish.

Great recipe! I used chicken tenders equivalent to 4 1/2 breasts and doubled rest of ingredients except for the taco seasoning and chili powder. I also used low sodium taco mix. Used 1 1/2 tsp cumin. This was good fresh but even better the next day.

We really enjoyed this.  I did do a few things different, to take advantage of what I had.  I used left over bbq chicken breast.  Cut it thin and added it to the sauce to heat.  I also made some wild rice blend.  Opened a can of black beans (rinsed well).  Spread sour cream on the tortillas, added some arugla, rice, black beans and the chicken.  Rolled them up and enjoyed.  A quick and delicious meal.

would give more than 5 stars if possible.  really outstanding!  just like the chicken you get in burritos in real mexican restaurants - shredded & lots of color & tons of flavor.  made it in the slow cooker: 4 frozen breasts, 8 oz tomato sauce, 16 ozs salsa, 1 packet taco seasoning, minced garlic.  cooked on high 4.5 hours then shredded it SO easily w 2 forks right there in the cooker.  can't wait to make it again.  SO YUM!!!  and SOOO EASY!  (love those crock pot liners!  clean up is a snap!!)

fast and easy AND this came out really, really well. i omitted the chili powder so that my 6 year old would eat it, but i think it definitly needs the heat. this would be great with some avacado slices. i'll do this one again.

Fantastically quick recipe for a nicely filling meal, it was a big hit with my fiancé.  I added Spanish rice to the filling and it was excellent.  The next time I prepare this I’ll try to make enchiladas.

I can't even count how many times I have made this filling.   One suggestion - use either canned chicken or cook the chicken separately. It makes it WAY easier to shred it.

This made a good burrito filling, but not sensational. I went ahead and threw everything in my slow cooker this morning and it was good, though next time I'll reduce the salsa since it was a little moister than I would have liked.

I was really nervous about making this because of all the reviews and suggestions about changes.  It was really good, though!  I sent my fiance to the store and of course he came back with an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and medium salsa.  I used all 8 oz because I hate to waste and skipped the salsa because I was afraid medium would make it too spicy.  I used half the packet of taco seasoning as well but I think the whole thing would have been fine.  I also baked the chicken in the oven first, shredded it, then threw all the ingredients together for about 15-20 mins.

This was pretty good. I didn't find the recipe to be too salty as others have said, but I did use more chicken then the recipe called for. Make sure you don't use a nonstick pan when cooking this because when you go to pull the chicken you can scrape the bottom of the pan. I cooked white rice and black beans on the side to stuff in the burritos along with the chicken filling and topped it with cheese and sour cream.

This was excellent. I did make some changes. Like someone else posted I added 3 frozen chicken breasts to a slow cooker. I added 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and 1/2 cup of salsa. The only spices I used were from the "taco seasoning I" recipe from this site. Cooked on high for 4 hours and then low for 2 hours (only because it was 2 hours away from dinner).   added cooked minute rice to my chicken before switching the heat to low. I cooked one cup of minute rice. Once dinner time arrived we stuffed our burritos with the filling, sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.  Everyone loved it.

Made in crock pot, cooked on low for about 4 hours, used about 10 oz of tomato sauce to curb the saltiness a lot of reviewers wrote about, I also added 3/4 of the packet of taco seasoning and ommitted the hot sauce so my daughter could eat it.  Served it with spinach tortillas, refried beans, cheddar cheese & brown rice.

I made some little changes.... before adding the meat, sauted chopped onion, garlic and green bell pepper to give more flavor. I had to use ground meat 'cause my mom doesn't like chicken :( ....but it worked perfectly!!
Also made my own taco seasoning from this site and was soooooo good (taco seasoning I..... highly recommended!!!).
A keeper!!

The overall recipe was great, but next time I will try only a half of the taco seasoning.  This was WAY to salty.  And, as another reviewer suggested, I will look for a low sodium version.  Otherwise, We will make this again.  Thanks.

WONDERFFUL! Even my picky 5 year old asked for seconds!  My husband has already asked if I'll make this again soon!

Just came back for this recipe again to send the link to a friend!  This is so good and easy!

What a great recipe!  I know there are some who object to reviews that aren't based strictly on the original version, but I want to thank all those who are willing to attempt the recipe with minor adjustments and then share them so that people who DON'T LIKE to cook (like me) can still attempt something new with greater confidence.  Personally, I took the suggestions of many others and left out the taco seasoning but kept all the rest.  Then I followed the suggestion of one other cook to mix together the sauce ingredients first then test the sauce for how salty I perceived it to be (perfect, in this case).  Finally, I followed another's lead and baked it slow cooker-style at 250F for 2 hours (fortunately I had the time to do that), and the chicken turned out beautifully!  Next time, however, I think I'll try cooking the dish uncovered as the sauce had not reduced and made the final product too soupy for my liking, which speaks of my technique not the quality of the recipe.  I'd definitely rate this higher than 5 if I could!  Thanks, Jubeefish, for the original, and everyone else for their input!

Pretty good. While tasty, I'm not sure I'd make this on a regular basis. This is great for those nights when you need something simple and fuss-free on the table - QUICK (I'll save this for those occasions)! I do agree that this would be MUCH better if slow cooked. I had to add a considerable amount of chicken broth several times thruout the cooking process in order to keep my chicken "moist" (even on the lowest heat setting, my chicken seemed quite dry). Slow cooking would eliminate this. NOTE: Don't omit the cumin / chili powder! Yes, both are spices found in traditional taco seasoning, but adding them (in ADDITION) to the taco spices only enhances the overall flavor, IMHO. Served "taco style" with all the fixins' - chopped scallion and tomato, shredded lettuce, sharp cheddar and sour cream. Mexican rice completed our meal. Thanks for sharing, JUBEEFISH! My husband ESPECIALLY thanks you (he's ALWAYS begging me to make tacos lol!). :-)

"Very flavorful" says the critic! We both loved this change of pace... normally I cook the chicken just with the taco seasoning (using recipe from this site--I make in bulk with good quality seasonins so we  have on hand at all times!). While that has worked just fine, this recipe isn't much extra work to get a bigger mouthful of flavor! I skipped the garlic because I was lazy. I could definitely see adapting this for a crockpot and serving to a larger group. Looking forward to the leftovers!

I will add my voice to the choir of praises for this recipe.  It is quick, easy, healthy, and delicious - and definitely a keeper.  Not a fan of chunky salsas, so I gave it a spin in the blender (along with the garlic) before adding.  I also used three chicken breasts and bumped up the ingredient amounts accordingly.  Followed the recipe exactly, omitting the hot sauce, and couldn't be happier.  Disappeared before I could take a picture!

please use what you probably have in your own spices instead of a packaged taco seasoning mix.There are many recipes and you'll have much less salt.

I loved this!! I used mild enchilada sauce instead of garlic,and chili powder and only used 1/2 of the taco seasoning.I didn't add the hot sauce because of my children I just let my husband put that on his .If it gets a little to thick in the crockpot just add a cup of water it also helps tame down the spiceyness if you have picky ones at home.I put s.cream and chedder cheese on ours  it was great and easy to make.

Really good, the only thing that I did differently is that instead of taco seasoning I used the recipe from Taco Seasoning I by Bill Echols.  It was delicious.

This has become one of my favorite slow cooker recipes.  I used 4 pounds of chicken breast, increased all of the ingredients accordingly except the taco seasoning (I only used one packet) set it on low and my kitchen smelled great.  I divided it out into four meals, one for that night and three for later.  I even enjoyed making lettuce wraps with this filling and butter lettuce along with our normal taco toppings.

I made this for my teenaged boys this evening and they loved It!  Even though I tripled the recipe, I only used 2 packets of taco seasoning and it turned out just great!  I rolled it in tortillas and put a little home made chile con queso on the top.  I'm going to try it in the crock pot next time.

Yum, yum, yum! This was a very good burrito recipe. Not too spicy, but it had a little bit of a kick to it that we enjoyed. I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker on high for about three hours, then shredded the chicken, and set it on low for one more hour. So easy! And I love that this uses ingredients that I normally already have on hand so there is virtually no planning that has to go into making this. I doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers, which I am glad that I did because it didn't seem to make a whole lot, and no one in my house is that big of an eater. I would say that doubling it makes about six burritos. Thank you for a great recipe that will be made again and again!

I threw everything in the crockpot (used chicken tenders).  Cut into small cubes in lieu of shreds.  Very good with the Cilantro Lime Rice from AR.  I little too strong on the chili powder but overall a pretty good burrito filling.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Tasted pretty good! Although chicken was hard to tear apart in pan. What I will probably do next time to give it more flavor is boil the chicken for one to two hours until it falls off bone. Put that chicken in skillet and mix with seasonings. Boil chicken with onion to increase flavor. I also added some red pepper flakes.

I quadrupled this recipe for a family camping trip, and everyone loved it! I made it ahead of time, put it in ziploc bags, then heated it in a pan over the fire. Next time, I might boil the chicken separately, as it was difficult and messy to pull apart after cooking in the tomato sauce. This is definitely a recipe I will keep!

This was not as much work as I thought it was going to be and tasted amazing.  
I added in some Franks Hot Wings sauce while cooking it for even more of a kick and it was a hit.  
Also awesome for leftovers. YUM!

This was GREAT! A big hit in my family, we love Mexican food. My kids are 1, 3, and 5 they don't normally like salsa but they ate every bit of this dish! The only thing I did differently was I used a corn and black bean salsa, that i bought at Meijer. Thanks for a great recipe we make it all the time!!!

Threw 2 frozen breasts in a pan, used what was left of a jar of salsa then added in some fresh salsa. didnt have tomato sauce so i used tomato paste and some chicken broth. It was a little on the salty side but I assume that was from the taco seasoning. Added more garlic than called for but it didnt matter because we couldnt taste it. 
served with the regular taco toppings.

Simple and tasty!  I added refried beans, took out the chili powder and cumin, and garnished with low fat sour cream, a little extra sharp cheddar, and cilantro.

The only minor tweaks I made to this awesome recipe were to use an enchilada seasoning packet instead of taco (1. My husband hates taco seasoning 2. It's what I already had in the house) added 1/8c water and 1/8c red wine (cabernet sauvignon) then covered during the simmering time. Any time I'm cooking meat with a tomato base I add some red wine to add more depth to the flavors.

For us, we effectively divided this recipe up into five servings giving him 3 smaller burritos and 2 for me, which with a side salad filled us fine.

Excellent dish! I used a full pound of chicken and half the taco seasoning and cooked it in the crockpot for about 3 hours on high.

I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce and an entire package of hot taco seasoning. I added the salsa and some water maybe 1/2 cup. The chicken was flavored perfectly, no additional spices needed. I wrapped the burritos with a smear of refried beans and sprinkle of Mexican blend cheese in whole wheat tortillas.  Topped them with salsa and more cheese and baked 375 for 10-15 minutes. Perfection.  Will make again for sure!!

This was pretty good.  I made it without the cumin and chili powder, as the taco seasoning seemed to be enough.  I actually doubled the recipe but still only used 1 packet of taco seasoning and it was good, so I think 1 packet with only 2 breast halves would have been too much.

I ate this over lettuce and tomato as a salad with some shredded cheese and black olives, to minimize the calories.  My husband ate it on tortillas with cilantro.  We both enjoyed it.

Pretty good burrito filling...I took others' recommendation to reduce the amount of taco seasoning.  I also mixed in some leftover rice to stretch the filling for another meal.

This is delicious!  I make it in the slow cooker on high for about four hours.  Then I pull the chicken apart with a fork and knife and leave it on low for another half hour or so.  I up the salsa to a full cup and also throw in a small onion - diced.  I serve it as a burrito with fresh diced tomatoes and sour cream.  Mexican or Spanish rice and corn on the side and you have a great meal.  It's even better the next day for lunch!

5 stars for ease and taste compared to similar dishes. I have tried these several times with different modifications based on reviews and have found that the recipe as written minus the taco seasoning pack is the best. I use chicken tenderloins. Serve with flour tortillas and desired fixings.

Very good quick and easy meal.  I used my own taco seasoning mix and the crockpot for 2 1/2 hrs on High like others suggested and it was nice and moist and tasty. Will try adding other veggies next time!

This tasted wonderful, but the execution could be changed a bit.  I found it really difficult to pull the chicken apart in the sauce.  I also add a bit more sauce and let it just do it's thing or I've also pre boiled the chiken then added the shredded chicken to this sauce and let it cook down a bit.  I think it would be great in the crock pot as well.

Made it in a slow cooker - really good for burrito/salad etc ...  Perhaps a little salty from the taco seasoning.

Very very yummy!  I also agree with everyone who said that you should cut the taco seasoning in half.  I didn't read the reviews before I added the taco seasoning and it came out pretty salty, but not horribly so.  Really great recipe!

This was very good. I cooked this in my slow cooker, and added cooked rice at the end. I increased my tomato sauce (I used puree but it doesn't matter) because I knew I would add rice later. This would also be tasty with some black beans mixed in, and I wished I had made pico de gallo to go with it, but alas, we only had cheese and sour cream, salsa and hot sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

The original recipe was too salty due to the taco seasoning.  I made a few changes to the recipe and give the new and improved recipe 5 stars.  Instead of taco seasoning, I just used cayan pepper, cilantro, and crushed red pepper.  I also added half a 4 ounce can diced green chilies, green onion and white onion to the mix as well.  When rolling burritos I added black beans and green salsa Verde.  I followed what JUBEEFISH suggested and put in baking pan, poured salsa and cheese on top of the burritos.  I added olives and more green onion and bakes for 15 minutes on 350.  Topped with sour cream and served.  They were AMAZING.

This was FANTASTIC!!!!  The two chicken breasts I had were huge, so I nearly doubled the other ingredients except for the taco seasoning.  It cooked in exactly the amount of time called for.  I put the chicken in flour tortillas along with black beans, brown rice mixed with a little salsa, mexican cheese blend, and a heaping spoon full of hot salsa.  My husband and I LOVED it!!!  A restaurant in town has something very similar, but this is even better.  Will be making this again and again!

These were so good.  I added onion to the chicken mixture and used 3 chicken breasts but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Served them with lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and hot sauce.  Delish!

Made this in the crockpot and had taco salads. I used about a packet and 1/4 of the taco seasoning and did not add all the additional spices. Looking forward to making this again!

Fantastic! I changed a few things only based on what I had and what we prefer. I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce w/garlic, half a pack of fajita seasoning, about a tsp of garlic powder and added water immediatly to cover the chicken.  I wound up simmering it a bit longer after shredding, about 20 min with the top on and another 15-20 with it off. We LOVED this recipe and will use it again for sure. Thanks!

This was really good and easy.  The only thing I changed was I used Taco Bell taco sauce for the tomato sauce.  I put in a flour tortilla with sour cream and cheddar cheese.

This has fast become a staple at my place when everyone is feeling like burrito's or taco's. I cannot express how much better this is than using shredded beef or turkey meat. However, I do cook the chicken a little bit more throughly(little bit longer with lid on stirring every 5 minutes) as I am a bit paranoid about contaminated chicken as I have had E. coli before.

we made about 20 of these burritos and froze them for an easy lunch during the week.  Turned out great!  This will be the filling I use from now on.

My husband found this recipe and we absolutely love it.  I did, however, change it by using 15oz of tomato sauce, 4oz just didn't do it for us.  It cooks down nicely while I'm shredding the chicken and also is absorbed by the rice. It low fat and filling.  We make our own taco seasoning (another internet find) and that cuts down on the sodium.  We also use brown rice.

I tried the recipe as is, but would suggest a few changes. I had to increase the amount of chicken, I used 8 oz tomato sauce and a cup of salsa. Was a little too salty with the whole spice packet. Maybe next time use gradually to taste. Was a great starter recipe though!

I thought this recipe was great and not salty at all, though that might be because I used 3 pieces of chicken instead of 2.  Definitely a keeper!

Went with everyone's suggestion and left out the taco seasonings. I didn't have any hot sauce on hand, so I put in some red pepper in instead (a little too much, in fact!). Great quick recipe.

We loved this recipe. Used it to make taco filling. Used jalenpeno salsa and added onion and tomatoes. I'm used to adding cheese and sour cream to the Mexican food I usually eat but I didn't even miss them with this dish. It may add to it a bit but it's not necessary. Really wonderful! Definitely recommended.

I'm not real creative with adjusting recipes so it was great to have something that worked as is. Wonderful! I made the Mexican rice II I found on this site and had a fantastic meal. Everyone in my family loved it. Thanks.

Very good base and have made it twice now.
1st attempt was uninspiring as I left out: 

#  1 teaspoon ground cumin
# 2 cloves garlic, minced
# 1 teaspoon chili powder
# hot sauce to taste

2nd attempt I followed everything except I used 1 clove of garlic for a double recipe as mexican food with too much garlic is an instant turnoff. 

Cannot help but think that this is missing that authentic grilled flavor that liquid smoke just won't cover. Next time I am going to omit some of the salsa and replace with my own base salsa enhanced with various roasted peppers and then spread the meat mixture thin in a pie tin in my electric water smoker for a few minutes to add that wow it is missing. 

Salsa and hot sauce quality will make or break this recipe.

3.5 stars, almost there!

Absolutely delicious,this will be my always go to chicken filling!

This was good. I'll definitely be making this again, however, I doubled the recipe and had a feeling that 2 taco seasoning packets would be too much, so I used 1 and a half. When it was finished, my husband thought there was STILL too much taco seasoning in it. I guess the next time I make this I'll still only use 1. I also used less pepper than called for (I don't like spicy). Really good!!

I made a few alterations to the recipe by adding a fresh diced jalapeño and by omitting the taco seasoning and upping the spices to compensate. I served the chicken as a burrito wrapped in a flour tortilla. I thought that it was tasty and had a lot of potential...next time I will add more ingredients to the chicken such as onions and maybe some avocado. I think that with just a little more flavor in it this recipe could be amazing!

this is just about as good as a "stew all day in a crock pot"!!!! truly amazing thas it comes together in under an hour. this was packed with flavor!! (i also added a whole jalapeno pepper diced with seeds) so so easy and noone will guess you weren't slaving over a stove all day. i think this chicken could be used for so many things...soft tacos, burritos, enchiladas, or even fajitas. i was very pleased!!!

I was looking for a great recipe to flavor up the chicken in my burritos. I made it canned white chicken instead.  I added rice, black beans, sour cream, fresh cilantro and sauteed red peppers, onions and garlic. Both my husband and I thought the burritos were so flavorful. I will always prepare my chicken this way for burritos. Gracias!

This was delicious!  I made it in the crock pot, as others suggested.  About an hour before we ate, I checked on it, and it was pretty dry, so I mixed in almost an entire can of chkn broth, and it made all the difference!  So succulent!  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

We absolutely LOVED it! Definately 5 stars. I could see where it was a little too salty, but it wasn't that bad. I'll probably cut back on the taco seasoning a bit next time. We had leftovers because I doubled the recipe, so we made some quesadiilas with the leftover chicken and it was awesome! My husband talked about the chicken for days! I'm keeping this recipe for sure!

We really liked this recipe.  I just put the chicken in the crock pot, mixed the sauce ing. together and poured it over.  Cooked it on low all day and it fell apart by itself.  We ate it like tacos.  Will make again!

Left out taco seasoning, too salty. Used regular and ground chipotle peppers and cumin. Used a bit more garlic, boneless, skinless chicken thighs(cheaper) and squeezed in juice of half a lime. let it simmer for 30 min and served. We both enjoyed it very much and plan on serving in frequently. Makes a quick meal for 2 with leftovers that taste even better than original.

This was very good..a bit salty, but good. What I did was when I filled the tortillas with the chicken, I sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on each one, then rolled up the tortillas and put in a baking dish, and topped with the rest of the salsa and sprinkled a bit more cheese on top. I then covered with plastic wrap and put in the microwave for a few minutes till heated through. When done I topped with shredded lettuce and sour cream. Delicious !! Thanks for the recipe !!

We took trishthedish’s advice (read the review below mine).  No salt problem.
We also used a small 8 oz. can of low salt tomato sauce which really worked out well. Very high recommendations for this recipe!

This was great, even my 5 year old ate these (once we removed the lettuce)lol.
I substituted a can of Rotel w/ Cilantro and Lime juice for the salsa, added a little bit more tomato sauce plus added a can of black beans at the end. Had this as soft tacos!!  Even the leftovers got eaten.  I will be sharing this one.

I did the oven version of this recipe with a few variations.  My husband loved it and I thought it was pretty good too.  Very easy as well which is nice.

Easy to make, the chicken breast doesn't burn with the tomato sauce, I did end up needing to add moisture part way through the cooking process, I used beer, additional tomato sauce is another option.   Low fat, great taste...  I will definitely use this again.

Like another reviewer, I used an entire 8 oz can of tomato sauce, and it was just right.  I can't imagine how it works with only 4 oz without being dry?  My chicken breasts were pretty big though.  Anyway, it was delicious and when served with tortillas, cheese, lettuce, onion, sour cream, and freshly made guacamole, it was a fabulous "authentic" Mexican meal!  Didn't use all the taco seasoning, agree w/ reviewer who said just season to taste.

This made a very good burrito filling with black beans, rice, sour cream ,and cheese. However, I did make several alterations. Based on the reviews, I omitted the taco seasoning and just used cumin and chilli powder. Also, I could only find an 8-ounce can of tomato sauce and rather than waste the other 4-ounces I just used them. And I find that when using fresh garlic sometimes less is more, so I only used one clove of garlic and the taste of garlic was not at all missed. Overall, when used in a burrito this is one tasty dish.

I tried this recipe yesterday for a large crowd.  It was EXCELLENT!!  I cooked a double batch in a slow cooker on high for a few hours, and the meat just fell apart.  
Very tasty and easy.  We had it with chopped onions, lettuce and tomatoes and real Mexican cheese.  Will make it again!

We enjoyed this filling in a burrito with beans and rice.  I think it would have been a bit too spicy for me by itself in a burrito, but with rice, it was perfect!  I used one breast and one thigh since I think the dark meat makes it a bit more tender; but I love the idea of pulling the meat instead of cutting it up, very good that way!  Very easy and simple ingredients and to prepare.  The only thing is that I couldn't find a 4oz can of tomato sauce and I hate wasting half a can, so next time I might try to use the whole 8oz can and omit the salsa or use only salsa to make it easier, but I'm sure it will still be good!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good, I have made it twice. The second time I made it I reduced the tomato sauce, increased the (chunky!) salsa, added some chopped jalapenos (we like really spicy food!) and some pinto beans.

Very good recipe for chicken burritos! I followed the recipe exactly except I precooked and shredded the chicken, and I omitted the cumin, as there is plenty of cumin in the packaged seasoning mix to my taste. I think when I make it again I will add a can of green chiles, perhaps some sauteed onion, and use only 1/2 to 3/4 the package of taco seasoning. I filled the burritos with Mexican rice, sour cream, and Mexican cheese. Delicious!

I have to admit, at first I was a bit skeptical, about adding tomato sauce, but it help keep all the spices together. Very flavorful, and just spicy enough! If you dont like spicy, I would try to tone it down a bit by adding less of the other spices and a bit more cumin. VERY good, I will make it again and again!! thanx

I'll try this again, but next time I'll leave out the packaged taco seasoning.  It made it way too spicy and salty for me. The other thing is there isn't enough liquid.  I had to keep adding water a little at a time, since as I cooked the chicken the sauce kept thickening. I thought the recipe was just OK, but my husband liked it.

I made it and while it was okay, mexican pulled chicken just isn't my thing. Not bad just not great. I found I had to add a lot of water even though I was only cooking it on medium. You have to be very careful to not overcook the chicken especially with chicken breast. I added more salsa and ended up with a bit too much sauce at the end. If I made it again I'd probably cut the cumin down and increase the hot sauce.

My husband kept saying "wow" as he ate this! I felt quite proud after making this recipe! 

I didn't have any salsa on hand, so I used 8oz of tomato paste and chopped up 1/4ea of a red, yellow, and green pepper, as well as an onion instead. I also added 1/4 cup of water chicken bouillon and about 1tsp of cornstarch. 

I cooked it in the pan as directed (not in a crock pot as some people did) and used only a bit of salt, pepper, garlic salt, and a taco seasoning packet. 

Served them inside tortillas that I warmed on the stove in a non-stick skillet, and let them warm in the oven covered by a moist paper towel. They came out soft and almost steamed! Much better than the microwave tortillas. 

I also served it with white rice cooked with some chicken boullion, along with shredded cheese and sour cream.

Super easy and tasted great. I used all the ingredients but made the recipe even easier. I mixed the tomato sauce, salsa, taco seasoning, cumin, garlic, and chili powder together and poured it over three whole chicken breasts in a skillet.  I also added some chicken broth to add more liquid and make sure the chicken breasts were covered completely.  I put it on the stove, let the liquid come to a boil, then covered the skillet and turned the heat down to simmer for 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes, I cubed the chicken instead of shredding it.  Turned out great. This recipe will be a keeper.

Very easy & worked out better than expected.  I used about 20 oz. chicken tenderloins (so the chicken was already in small pieces).  I omitted the taco seasoning but did everything else according to recipe.  The chicken cooked quickly, was easy to shred, and didn't get tough.  We'll be making this again.

I omitted the cumin and only used half the packet of low sodium taco seasoning.  I thought the cumin and taco seasoning made it taste salty. With my substitutions it came out yummy!

Very yummy and easy!!  I followed many other reviews and cooked 3 chicken breasts in the crock pot with all the other ingredients on high for 4 hours.  Then mixed in a can of refried beans just until heated through.  I used all of the seasonings just like it was written and we liked it (but we love strong and spicy flavors.)  I also rolled the burritos and put them in a 9x14 dish and covered with green chile and cheese.  Then baked them at 375 for 15 minutes.  YUM!

That was heart warming nice comfort food! When I made this for dinner, I had a very bad day at work. But as soon as I had the first bite in my mouth, I allready felt better! Hubby loves it too so it is defenitely a keeper. I made it exactly as writen, no changes needed!

Made this with my own taco seasoning (high blood pressure) and it really satisfied my craving for tex-mex!  I poached and shredded chicken first and then simmered it with the rest of the ingredients.  Other than making my own taco seasoning I used all of the ingredients as directed.  WORTH IT!

Inside of a bean and cheese burrito, this mixture is ideal.  This is something I have used a few times.  Instead of chicken breasts, I have been using 'stir fry' chicken.

We absolutely loved this!   I made it just as described and I would not change a thing except maybe make it in a crockpot.  After only 20 min. of cooking as directed, the chicken doesn't really shred that easily.  So next time in the crock pot it goes.  I added one more chicken breast but didn't increase the size of other ingredients.  This made 6 huge burritos but I also added refried black beans to the burrito so it took a bit less chicken.  Individually wrapped these and tossed in freezer for lunches for my son this week.  He is pretty stoked!  Delicious!!!  (thankfully there is extra sauce left after removing/shredding the chicken - we used it to top other entrees such as tamales!  Yummy!  Don't toss the extra sauce!)

This was excellent and ridiculously easy to make with only a few       ingredients.  I did scan some of the reviews and omitted the taco seasoning.  Really there was no need for it with the cumin, garlic and chili powder (all taco seasonings ingredients anyways). This is only the 2nd review I've written and only write a review if a recipe merits.  For me that means excellent in taste, ease of making and few items in recipe.

Really Good!! Used low sodium taco seasoning.  Cooked in crock pot with taco seasoning, chicken, tomato sauce and salsa.  I added rice a roni mexican rice. Rolled into tortillas with 1 slice of Colby/Monterrey Jack cheese per burrito. Topped with 1 can of enchilada sauce, sliced black olives and more shredded cheese.  Served with lettuce and sour cream on top.  Served with sides of refried beans with cheese added, tortilla chips and salsa.  Loved it!

I really liked this recipe.  I followed many people's suggestions and made the Taco Seasoning I for seasonings and skipped the extra cumin, garlic, and chili powder.  Next time I am going to try to do this in a crock pot to see if I can get the chicken to shred a little earlier.  I will definitely be cooking this recipe again.

This is my go-to recipe for taco seasoning.  I use it on chicken, shrimp and even just veggies sometimes.  I never buy packets of seasoning anymore!

This was very good with some adjustments.  There really isn't enough tomato sauce to "bring to a boil" and cook the chicken in, so I poached the chicken in chicken stock first, then shredded it and continued with the recipe.  I then boiled, strained, and used the stock to make rice as a side dish.  I also felt that the whole amount of taco seasoning was going to be far too much, so I added to taste and skipped the additional cumin and chili powder as they are already in the seasoning blend I used (Taco Seasoning I).  I also snuck some black beans and corn kernels into the filling.  I did need to add more liquid (used chicken stock), though I didn't cook on too high of a heat.  Final product was tasty!  Made 4 servings for 3 people, served with sour cream, guacamole, rice, and refried beans and it was all gone!

If using this the day it is made we had to give it a 3. Hubby took leftovers the next day & said it was much better, could taste the flavors & would've rated higher.  Next time I make this I'll do a day ahead for sure.

We LOVE this recipe.  I make it in the crockpot - mix all of the "sauce" ingredients together in a measuring cup and then pour over frozen chicken breast - 6 hours on low and you have a delicious filling for anything Mexican.  We have used in burritos, soft tacos, enchiladas and tacos.  So easy and super tasty.  The only change I made to the recipe was to leave out the hot sauce.

Loved this!  After reading the reviews, I used no sodium tomato sauce and reduced sodium taco seasoning.  I also used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce since I couldn't find a 4 oz one.  I mixed everything but the chicken together and poured it over the chicken.  I made this in the crockpot.

Didn't have tomato sauce so I used tomato paste and added some water. Will definitely be making these again. My husband also enjoyed them. Makes it a double plus.

This was pretty good.  I'm not big on ground beef tacos and this was a nice altiernative.  I followed the recipe, but added more water at the beginning maybe a quarter cup because it seeed to think from the get go.

This is perfect for busy nights.  I use my slow cooker.  I like it best with boneless, skinless thighs.  We've made tacos and even nachos with this filling.  My husband, the food critic, says it's "Awesome!"--Thank you for a great recipe

I used my homemade salsa with corn and black beans it and used the whole pint with 4 chicken breasts in the slow cooker.  Added the garlic, cut the cumin a little but left the chili pepper the same.  Then layered it with corn shells and cheese and baked in the over for 20 minutes or so.  Topped with sour cream - my husband said excellent - I break the shells and just layer them covering the bottom of the pan and the next layer.

I used the taco seasoning I recipe instead of a package of seasoning (minus the red pepper flakes) and this turned out great! I did not cook it as long because I didn't want the chicken to dry out. So just judge the time on your chicken. :)

This was very good and easy.  Instead of a store-bought taco seasoning packet I used the Seasoning For Tacos from Allrecipes. Since that recipe includes cumin, chili powder, and garlic, I didn't bother adding more.  Also, I used an 8oz. can of tomato sauce. I served this with tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese, and sour cream. I also made Spanish rice. I'll definitely make this again and would like to try it with a slow cooker next time.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, using homemade salsa and Taco Seasoning (from this site).  The flavors were wonderful.  I did find, however, that the portions were huge.  I was able to halve the portion for a very filling lunch.

Very tasty! Made some modifications: I made a 1.5x batch, used homemade taco seasoning ('Taco Seasoning I' on this site), doubled the tomato sauce, stepped down the cumin and chili powder, added peppers, onions, rice, and a can of refried beans. Also used the filling to make enchiladas (read ET's review of this recipe). Will most certainly make again.

I made this last night with left over roasted chicken - which I shredded and simmered in the sauce. I did not have tomato sauce on hand, so I used tomato and red pepper soup (Trader Joes brand) instead. it was most excellent. The entire family raved about this 'chicken! We made wet burritos with the sauce, and served it with chipotle salsa and sour cream. definitely my new 'go to' chicken burrito filling :)

This was so good. My daughter told me "Mom, you do know you're making this again, right?" We really like to load up our burritos so I wasn't sure if the cheese and salsa would be enough of a topping but it was just right to go with the filling. I used three chicken breasts and a 15 oz can of tomato sauce -- I have never seen a 4 oz can of tomato sauce -- and used 1 tsp of cornstarch to make up for not using the taco seasoning. This one is a keeper. Thanks for sharing it.

Add stop-light peppers, low-carb tortillas, low fat cheddar and low or non-fat sourcream and you've got a complete-with-veggies  healthy fajita meal.

We thought this was good!  We love to have take-out Mexican from "authentic" Mexican places but now I feel I can make our own chicken burritos w/ this filling.  I used less taco seasoning mix but otherwise  followed it exactly.  SUPER easy!

This is like my new favorite meal.  Deelicious!!  I used more chicken (family of 5),  added a little more tomato sauce and only 1/2 the taco seasoning.  Since mine had extra sauce, I put my filling in flour tortillas, covered tortillas with extra sauce and piled on sharp cheddar cheese and baked.  Perfect!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I just boil the chicen with the water to reduce messy from sauce, then smash the boiled chicken with the side of knife before pulling. I increased salsa to be 1/2 cup and reduced taco seasoning mix to be 1/2 of package. I added 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese in the recipe. Half of it I mixed into the sauce. Put the filling to bake covered at 350F in casserole baking sheet  for 1 hr. Uncovered and pour the rest of cheese on top and continue to bake more for 15 min.

This was way overpowered by the taco seasoning and chili powder.  My husband and I were able to eat it, but would not make it again.  If I were willing to try again I would cut back the taco seasoning by at least half.  I had also used 3 chicken breast halves and 8 ounces of tomato sauce and the seasoning was still too much.  It's been about 14 hours since I ate it and it is still "visiting" me.

Amazing recipe. As per recommendations I made my own taco seasoning found on this site. Cut down a little on the chili powder and cumin and cooked it in a slow cooker. Most delicious burrito I've ever had. I didn't think they were too spicy so I might add back a little of the spices I withheld. But otherwise this is a winner.

Scratch the taco seasoning mix.  Adds too much msg and stuff.  Mix the sauce, cumin (to taste), garlic, red pepper powder(instead of the chili powder) and paprica. Taste the poach BEFORE adding the chicken and adjust as needed.  Put chicken into poach, and cook for at least 20 mins. When ready to flake, tear it and poach a bit more.  When the chicken is completely flaked, add salsa to taste.  I then place it into fresh tortillas, cover with remaining sauce and chicken and a layer of cheddar and monterey jack shredded and bake for 20 mins or until the cheese bubbles.  Makes a great enchilada.

This was an an easy dish to make and the chicken mixture itself had a tons of flavor.  It was the first time we had made it so we went overboard and made them into enchiladas complete with sauce, extra cheese, tomatos and extra cheese.  In the future I woudl make it again, but I would keep the meal simple - just chicken in tortillas like a soft taco with maybe some fresh avocado, tomato and lettuce.  Anything else covers up teh taste of the spicy chicken.

Pretty good. Nothing special, but it was easy and tasty, I'd make it again. (Put froz chicken in the crockpot like others suggested, then added left over rice, and beans to make it go further).

Great recipe and easy.  I used tomatoe sauce out of a jar rather than the can because it was what I had on hand.  I cooked the chicken on the stovetop, but do think that it would have been better in a slow cooker.  Next time I will try it that way.

When I was a kid in the USAF, 60 years ago, I loved Tex-Mex food in south Texas.  This was good, but not that good. My wife says that it is great, better than at El Rodeo restaurant.  I, however, have not quite got that flavor back.  That's not the only thing, of course, that I haven't got back.  I'll try again.

Great recipe. Also good with thigh meat added. I have given up on using packaged taco seasoning and prefer the recipe on this site (Taco Seasoning 1) Much better flavor and I always have what I need on hand.

Very good. I used a 7 oz box of Del Fuerte brand mexican tomato sauce as I wasn't paying attention and missed that I only needed 4 oz. I had 3 chicken breasts and used AR Mexican Salsa II. I had some taco seasoning AR recipe, and used Tapatio hot sauce, about 1/2 tsp. I let this simmer for a little over an hour and it was delicious. I just put this on a flour tortilla and added a dab of sour cream and it was great! Thanks for the easy and great tasting recipe. This would be good for enchilada filling too.

This was delicious!  The only change I made was I used 8 oz of tomato sauce because that was the smallest size can they had at the store, and I did add a little water because the sauce got a little thick.  This probably helped cut down on the saltiness that some other reviewers noted.

This recipe is amazing but I did make a few changes.  I use about 1/2 cup salsa and about 8oz of tomato sauce.  I also use the low sodium taco seasoning mix so it is not so full of salt.  And last but not least, I fold in 1 cup of shredded cheese into the mixture.  It is just great!

LOVED this recipe, quick & easy. Like other reviwers I decreased the amount of taco seasoning by half, and it was good. Next time may add in some onion and jalepeno while cooking.

Delicious and easy to make, especially if you use the slow cooker like I did.  The only change I made was to use half a package of the taco seasoning so it wouldn't be too salty.  I threw frozen chicken and the rest of the ingredients in the crockpot on high and 4 hours later lunch was ready.  Thanks!

Absolutely love this recipe! We ate it as tacos on corn tortillas with a sprinkling of monterey jack cheese. I was going to the fridge for days hoping there more left over!

I omitted the extra spices-- using only taco seasoning-- and it turned out quite tasty. I would make this again.

This was so delicious!  After it was done in the slow cooker, I filled 8 tortillas w/ the chicken mixture, sour cream & cheese and put them in a large glass dish.  I spread more salsa over the top & covered with more cheese.  Cooked at 350 for about 20 min., until all the chees was melted & bubbly.  SO GOOD!!  My husband & best friend said they were some of the best burritos they'd ever eaten!!  High praise coming from my husband, who LOVES Mexican food!!!

This was ok. Definitely had to add water to the mix. It needed a little more kick to it though. Will try again but add more spices and probably some peppers and onions.

I made this in my crock pot and it turned out great!  I used 4 skinless boneless chicken breasts and 1/2 package of Taco seasoning.  I think the whole package along with the other spices would have been a little overpowering.  I put in in the crock pot for4 hours on high and they were done by like an hour and 45 minutes into cooking.  Really loved this.. it tasted a lot like the chicken filling of another popular recipe on this site for Chicken Enchiladas.. I think I'll use this recipe to make enchiladas from now on!!

This was very good. I too thought it was a bit on the salty side. Very simple to make, especially because I slow cooked the chicken in a 250 degree oven for 2 hours. That really made it easy! The best part of this recipe was that it gave me a great base idea to change and make my own.

Very good and super easy. I used the crock pot that some had suggested. I also used 1 can of HOT enchilada sauce vs tomato sauce and 1/2 cup of salsa vs 1/4 cup along with the low sodium seasoning. Everything else I kept the same. It turned out excellent and cooking it the crock pot made it easy to shred. Next time I think I will add some diced onions and maybe a diced jalapeno for some added flavor. Over all this was excellent and easy to make.

I saw this recipe, made my list and off to the market I went.  Of course, I forgot something - tomato sauce!  Didn't realize it until I got home.  Rather than go back, I opened up a can of tomato paste, mixed it with water and used it.  Still 5 stars!  I didn't care for the cumin, thought it overpowered it so when I make it again today with the tomato sauce this time, I'm leaving it out.  Also going to use Taco Seasoning I rather than buying it.  I used my crock pot and frozen chicken breasts as others posted in their reviews.  I was skeptical about using frozen chicken but it was really good.  A bit watery but good.  I doubled the recipe last time and toted the leftovers to work for lunch and used them in another meal.   Thanks for the recipe JUBEEFISH!!

I made this in the crockpot and used the taco seasoning, then read the reviews, panicked, and added more salsa and some water to try and mellow out the taco seasoning. I love it...

This was good and easy made in the crock pot.  Per other reviews put frozen chicken breast in the crock pot on High about 3-4 hrs.  Instead of tomato sauce used enchilada sauce and cut down on the seasoning packet.  Took chicken out of crock and shredded it with sauce.  Then I took an additional step and rolled the chicken in tortillas with cheese and poured crockpot sauce over it and baked in the oven with cheese till melted.

This was a good, easy and quick recipe to make on a week night for a working mom like me.  I made it exactly as written except I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 2 and added a little water.  Delicious!

I made this last night for my family and following the advice of others, doubled it and cooked in my crockpot. I also used the taco seasoning I recipe from this site, and not knowing how much to use, started off with one Tablespoon of seasoning for 4 chicken breasts, but upon trying a few hours later, added the rest of the spice from the recipe.  I then spooned the burrito filling into large flour soft tortilla, put a little taco cheese on top and placed on a hot griddle to crisp up the tortillas.  Served with refried beans and a green salad.  Fabulous!  Two of my family members had to have some antacid in the night (they are prety wimpy - no one else complained that it was too spicy), but said it was worth it for these great burritos!

Wonderful. I threw everything in the crock pot mid morning; using frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Mid afternoon, I removed the chicken, shredded it and put it back in. Also, at the same time, I added sliced onion, green, red & yellow peppers (fajita style). Our sons ate it in tortillas with cheese. My husband & I ate it just as is. May serve it with brown or spanish rice next time. Thank goodness for crock pots!

This was pretty tasty. The chicken cooked nicely, was flavorful and moist. I used no salt added tomato sauce and low sodium taco seasoning, so the saltiness that others experienced was not an issue for me. Served in flour tortillas with refried beans, sour cream, hot sauce, and shredded cheese. Thanks :)

The only thing I did different was to use 1/2 the amount of taco seasoning that was called for and I didn't use hot sauce at all.  This was very spicy but good.  The sauce was VERY paste-like though.  I added water but it was still pasty, I was afraid to add more because I didn't want it all runny either.  It was very good and I will make it again.

A bit too spicy...I'll cut down on the spices next time, and add bit by bit as I taste it. Fresh diced tomatoes and cilantro made it better too.   It actually worked better as a topping over bean filling burritos and cheese, rather than a filling. I'll try again!

This is a fantastic recipe. It has quickly become a staple in our family.  I used green enchilada sauce & green salsa, with the homemade taco seasoning from this site.  The chicken is fantastic and it makes for an quick easy meal.  We also steam our tortillas on the stovetop to make excellent burritos just like (really even better than) Moe's!

This was a quick/easy/decent meal.  I followed the advice of other users and only used 1/2 the taco seasoning.  Next time I think I will use 1/4 of the packet, or none at all.  I put the filling into tortillas, put cheese on the top and baked on 350 until the cheese melted.  I also cooked mushrooms into the sauce.  I think it might be good to add squash and/or zucchini also.

I enjoyed this recipe and made it as directed, however, next time I make it I will use the lower sodium Taco seasoning.  I didn't think it was too salty at first, but the more I ate, I knew I'd never make it as is again.  My husband thought there was too much sauce and didn't enjoy it that much.  I also added sauteed onions/peppers. It was yummy. :)

We've made this several times now.  You can just eyeball everything and adjust to your liking.  This recipe was really good in quesadillas too. We loved it, but it was not quite 5 stars.

I made this as directed and my family loved it.  Since the first time I have made it I did make a change.  I use my own homemade taco seasoning so it isn't to salty.

I thought this recipe was good, my husband said it was "wicked good."  It wasn't quite as flavorful as I wanted it to be, but it was still a good, easy meal.  Very good with white rice and a salad.

I thought this ok.  I added lots of water because the time to shred my chicken was longer than 15 minutes.  In fact I think it cooked closer to an hour.  It was easy, but I think we prefer a less tomatoe sauce type of burrito filling.  Thanks for sharing.

We usually eat vegetarian, but I decided to try this recipe (we're not vegetarians per say but just eat meat only on occasion). This was fantastic! A good switch from the meatless burrito fillings. So easy to make. I added a bit more of the spices since we like it hot. It's usually gone within a day. Good for burrito/taco fillings and also to make a southwestern salad. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastically quick recipe for a nicely filling meal.  We prefer a bit more heat so we added 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  It was wonderful, be sure to add about a 1/4 cup of water when adding the dry ingredients to keep the mixture from becoming to dry.  Enjoy

Good recipe. I made it a bit simpler..4 frozen chicken breasts, 1/2 pkg taco seasoning sprinkled over, 1 cup salsa...crockpot high 4 hrs.
Wrapped it in tortillas with some shredded cheese, crushed taco chips and sour cream. Served with a nice green salad. Delicious! Great flavor even without the cumin and chili powder (enough in the taco seasoning I think).

Will try the other reviewer's suggestion next time...wrapping the chicken in tortillas and then pouring sauce over and baking with cheese...like the idea of not wasting any of it!

Excellent! I left out the taco seasoning per others suggestions.  Put all other ingredients in crock on high for 4 hours. Rolled in flour tortillas with black beans and cheese. I poured the remaining sauce on top and sprinkled more cheese on top.  Baked at 375 for 15 minutes.  Wonderful, flavrful dish.

I accidently came across this recipe and I have to tell you this will be a family favorite.  My 3yo son who is very picky loved it.  I omitted the taco seasoning and increased the amount of other seasonings and it was perfect.

This recipe was yummy! I left out the cumin and chili powder because the taco seasoning had plenty of spices in it already. I packed this up with some taco toppings for a picnic. A great, fun meal. Even better the next day!

This was good. I didn't look at the recipe close enough and put in an entire 9 oz can of tomato sauce instead of 4 oz. so there was way too much sauce. I also decided not to shred the chicken, and I just cut it into bite sized pieces before I put it in the pan. I served this on warm tortillas with cheese and it was good. However, I probably will not make this again as it gave me heartburn and I have NEVER gotten hartburn in my life. But still good none the less!

Great recipe; however, I really thought they were too salty.  I had even halved the amount of taco seasoning.  Next time, I would go with low sodium taco seasoning (as recommended previously).  I also made the "Easy Never Forgotten Guacamole" and put that in the burrito as well, along taco cheese, sour cream, salsa, and iceburg lettuce.  It definitely needed all that to help cut down the saltiness a bit.  Overall though, the taste was excellent.  My husband loved the burrito and so did I.  I will definitely make this again.

Quick, easy and good!  I used only about 1 Tablespoon of taco seasoning and it was plenty flavorful, but not overpowering.  We built burritos with chicken, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, rice and sour cream.  Good!

this is a great recipe. i bought chicken pinwheel's instead of breasts, boiled them, then shredded and simmered in the tomato sauces/ salsa for about 25 minutes. we used  this in soft taco shells and they were fabulous. try using medium or hot salsa as well as add tomato sauce if the chicken dries up. i used a bit of chili powder as well as cumin and a dash of coriander. yum!

Excellent and so easy. I altered the recipe by adding a can of Hot Rotel, chopped green chilies and chopped black olives and served on wheat tortillas with cheese and then smothered the burritos. I'm going to try adding corn and black beans next time. Loved it!

This was okay. I thought it tasted like chicken with taco seasoning. Maybe that's what it's supposed to taste like?? I only used half the packet to avoid the saltiness that some of the reviewers complained of. Still, I wasn't too impressed. It was easy enough so I may just tweak it more to my liking and make it again.

Very good. It came very close to the chicken burrito filling at my favorite Mexican restaurant. I didn't use all the taco seasoning either. I will definitely make this again.

I added a little extra salsa and tomato sauce, but I thought this was a great.  Hubby liked it, too. I served it in burritos with cheese, sliced pickled jalepenos, and sour cream.  Makes a good amount of filling (two of us ate twice, which is a big deal when feeding my hubby!).  Next time, I might add some chipotle pepper to spice it up more.

My whole family - even 2 very picky eaters - really enjoyed this.  I doubled the tomato sauce & spices but still only added one packet of taco seasoning.  My son (who is known to like nothing) has asked me to make it again.

This was good and easy.  As suggested by other reviewers, I cooked it in a crockpot for about 4 hours.  I used four chicken breasts instead of two but didn't double anything else and it still had plenty of sauce.

These were good but made some changes. With reading the other reviews, I didn't add the 1 teaspoon ground cumin and 1 teaspoon chili powder - I just added the taco seasoning. Doubled recipe and but all ingredients in crockpot. Cooked for 4 hours on high. Will make again. Good flavor.

My family loves this recipe. I have made it twice now. I use all the ingredients exactly as called for. The only difference is I cook it in the crockpot for 4 hours. After that, I shred the chicken with forks. Then I return the  chicken to the crockpot for about another hour. It is delicious.

I've made this but omited the taco seasoning packet, and use a can of Rotel tomatos instead.  Then just cook until it thickens.  Low sodium and fat, but full flavor.

My husband and I loved this one. Instead of taco seasoning we used Chipotle seasoning. We also used ancho pepper and honey salsa. These two changes made the recipe more smokey and less spicy. I had to add a lot of water to keep it from drying out.

This recipe was so yummy I wanted to lick my plate clean! However, it was a bit difficult to continuously pull apart the chicken in the pot! I would recommend shredding it before cooking it over the stove!

This was very good and easy to make.  I added a can of black beans to the filling after it was finished cooking.  Add water as needed to adjust the sauce consistency.

I liked this alot, but I modified it alot as well. Added a can of corn, about 1/2 cup of cooked black beans and about 1/2 cup of cooked rice.  Omitted the salsa, as I didn't have any, just used a little water instead.  Also, used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce (didn't have that either!)  only used about 1/2 of the taco seasoning, and kicked up the spice with some cayenne pepper.  Overall, it was pretty good!!

Four stars for use as a base recipe.  Ditched the taco seasoning, added hot sauce, black beans, corn, and diced tomatoes.  Served with shredded lettuce, cheese, and light sour cream.  Leftovers were good the next day served over shredded lettuce as a salad.  One chicken breast served 3 for dinner and 2 for lunch that way.

I liked this recipe. It did seem a little salty, so maybe I'll use less taco seasoning next time.  I wasn't able to pull the chicken part totally, but it was fine with chunks wrapped in the flour tortillas.  Yum!

very good - i added a can of Green Chiles - when i added the salsa. I cooked this in an electric skillet instead of a saucepan - just added the ingridents - covered and cooked at medium heat for the 15 minutes - worked great. Since i had more surface area - i did add a cup of water to the mix - to ensure i had enough moisture - worked great and it tasted wonderful.

Who would have thought you could make an authentic Mexican burrito at home?!?!  I used black bean tortillas and added a layer of refried beans and pepper jack cheese.  I also grilled them in my Cuisinart griddle instead of baking them.  The recipe yielded 6 large burritos.

My husband does not like chicken and I've tried ALOT of recipes to try to get him to eat some.  He loved this.  I used it in the  "Spicy Beef Chimichanga" recipe too and added some Colby/Mont Jack cheese to the inside of chimis and on top for last 4 minutes.  Topped with fat free sour cream.  Turned out great!

This recipe is very good.  I love the chicken pulled rather than sliced or cut up.  Much more authentic texture.  I must admit this is not the spiciest I've ever tasted, so if you love your tacos/enchiladas/burritos spicy you may want to kick it up with some peppers/hot sauce.  Overall very good, I've made this several times, even for company and everyone has loved it.

This was so good and easy.  The chicken breast meat I had was already cooked, so I just shredded it and simmered in the sauce for a while.  I did cut down on the tomato sauce.  My family really enjoyed this.  Will make again soon.

This was JUST what I was looking for (perhaps half the taco mix might make it a bit less salty).  I used it to make chicken quesadillas.  Warm a flour tortilla in a large pan on med high, layer on some chicken mixture, green onions, tomatoes, banana peppers, finely shredded cheese and cover with a second tortilla.  Cook for a minute or two 'till lightly crisped and flip 'till cheese is melted inside.  Cut into four and serve with salsa and sour cream.  I am going to try with chicken thighs as they are cheaper.  Also going to try freezing for easy to prepare make ahead dinner.

Good spicy recipe.  I didn't have chicken breasts, so I used canned chicken-worked out just fine.

I doubled the recipe. I also added some fresh tomatoes and onions to it. It ended up more like chili, but tasted really good. Instead of burritos, I used it as nacho meat and ate it with tortilla chips. Will make again.

My husband and myself tried this today for lunch. Amazing! It was so good that we shared the link to this recipe to our friends and family. Oh! We also made sure we posted 3 photos of this meal. Check them out in the photo collection.

Easy and flavorful. I used the whole 8oz can of tomato sauce and found that to be a good amount. Next time I will mix all the spices into the tomato sauce before pouring over the chicken. It was a little tricky to get it all mixed with the chicken in the pan.

Excellent recipe!  This makes a really good filling for burritos, enchiladas or tacos, and you can make amazing nachos with it as well.  Not difficult to make and delicious.  The next time I make this I'm going to cut the chicken breasts into large strips to make shredding easier.

I made this for the wife and I for taco Tuesday and it turned out great.
I did add black olives, onions and lots of Louisiana hot sauce on a burrito shell with sharp cheddar cheese. 
Definitely a keeper and will make again.

I tripled this recipe. The only modification I made was adding 1 packet of taco seasoning as opposed to 3. I did this in order to cut down on the sodium content. I added all the other spices as per the recipe. This was a big hit with the wife and kids. This is a great burrito and taco filling. My kids have already asked for me to make this again.

I’m sure this recipe is good so I’m giving it 4 stars. My search did not reveal the homemade Taco Seasoning. Take my advise - Do NOT use a prepared Taco Seasoning labeled Hot. I only used 1/2 pack as recommended in the reviews. The Dish was inedible. My fault I’m sure. I’ve never made anything my husband wouldn’t eat in 36 years of marriage!

This was so easy and it was delicious!  I added hot pico de Gallo to the chicken and tomato sauce to get alittle more punch, but followed the recipe otherwise.   I provided black beans, cheese, lettuce, and sour cream as garnishes.

Very good and easy to make, a hit with the whole family! The only change I made was using my homemade taco seasoning instead of a pkg.  I put the filling on baked corn tortillas made into tostadas. :)

Easy and super yummy! I followed the recipe for the most part with only 2 adjustments. I added a can of black beans (rinsed and drained) and like another user said on here, I threw everything all together in the crock pot for 4 hours on low. When it was done the chicken easily fell a apart. Served over rice mixed with quinoa. Great for a night when I don’t have time to cook! Will definitely be making it again.

A family favorite for a few years now. I follow the original recipe, place it in tortillas for burritos in a 9x13 pan, pour a little enchilada sauce over, bake, then add shredded cheese, sour cream, cilantro, etc. Love it!

Also used for a Mexican lasagna...great stuff!

This came out great!! Due to food allergies I just homemade taco seasoning and homemade salsa. I did not find this to be to salty at all probably because I used homemade seasoning & salsa were the salt content can be controlled. The burritos were ok but the next day I used the leftovers for nachos & those were AMAZING!

I would have liked less tomato sauce in this, but it was fast and easy to make. I used chicken tenders so that they would cook faster and would be easier to shred.

I put 3 frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot. Cooked for about three hours on high. There was a lot of liquid so we added a package of rice and cooked on low for another 30-40 minutes. Also used low sodium fajita seasoning instead of taco seasoning, didn't add any other seasonings. I think next time I will cook the chicken for about two hours and then check it to see if it is done. Very good though.

Delicious!!! I made this tonight for the first time. The only changes I made were to use 3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts instead of 2 and an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce instead of 4 ounces. All other ingredients remained the same. Very flavorful and easy to prepare. First time I have shredded chicken for a recipe and I was very proud of the end result. Definitely use a sauce pan as it ensures that the sauce mixture covers the breasts while they are cooking. Also, for this dinner I made the following recipes from this site: Refried Beans without the Refry (in crockpot overnight), Spanish Rice II (prepared stovetop and transferred to rice cooker) and Janet's Rich Banana Bread (in the oven while dinner was being prepared).

I made according to recipe. It was bland in flavor. Would most likely not make again unless I changed the recipe.

I never measure, but this was really good. I made my own taco seasoning and salsa with tomatoes from my garden. I also used chicken tenders instead of breasts and I used tapatio for the hot sauce. 

For the extra cardiac effect I made 6 burritos
with cheddar and Monterey Jack, put them in a glass backing dish, and smothered them with the remaining sauce and cheese. I baked it at 400F for about 15 minutes. I got rave reviews even from the kids.

I made this for dinner and it was totally delicious! The only tweak I made was I substituted the tomato sauce with chicken broth and I thought it made the chicken really soft with good flavor. I will definitely make this one again.

Amazingly tasteful recipe! Only thing I had to keep doing was add water so instead of adding just water I put a little extra salsa liquid and water so it didn't come out too bland. It came out so moist and flavorful, great burrito filler! everyone had seconds, if not thirds. Thank you for sharing, definitely saving this recipe for future taco and burrito night!!

One of my family's favorites! This is the 4th time I've made this recipe or variation of. I used 3 chicken breast and tossed it in the crockpot on low for 6 hours, shredded the chicken and let it go for another hour. The chicken just falls apart. The only change I made to ingredients was to add a small can of green chillis. YUM!

As it has already been said.. The taco mix makes the dish salty. Follow the other suggestions to decrease the saltiness.

I couldn't make it like the directions so I really had to tweak it. I didn't have tomato sauce so I just boiled the chicken in water instead. When it was done, I shredded it and put it in the skillet with 2/3 c. of water. I chopped up red bell pepper and added it. Then I put a tsp of minced garlic, added chili powder, Cajun seasoning, hot sauce, homemade pico de gallo, and taco seasoning and simmered it. 
That had to be the best thing I've ever made and it satisfied my Mexican craving with low calories. I have enough for another meal and I can't wait to eat leftovers!

This tastes amazing!  I serve it with sides such as Jasmine rice with lime and cilantro, black beans, avacado, black olives, shredded cheese. I double the recipe and it never lasts more than a day, between family and friends. The only thing I change is to add a cup of water and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Then I let it simmer and reduce. Or better yet, toss it all in a crock pot with some extra water and let it cook in the morning so it's done by dinner time.

Yum.  I used 8 oz of tomato sauce, not quite a full package of taco seasoning, and no chili powder or hot sauce.  Next time, I will simmer for 20 minutes and then shred the chicken on a large plate.

This is the taste I've been looking for; easy and full flavored.  I added black beans and a used a 14 oz can of tomato sauce rather than 4 ox.  I increased the spices and added dried onoins rather than taco seasoning.

Made the chicken in the crockpot, then wrapped the burritos with cheese in a 9x13 and covered with enchilada sauce, cheese, and green onions and baked for 15 min at 375 as another reviewer suggested.  These were really good.

I thought it was pretty good. I used jalapeños finely diced to add heat instead of hot sauce. Also I used a little extra salsa. Next time I think I will eliminate the taco seasoning and increase the other ingredients as others have said.

Makes great burritos but I do leave out the chili powder and hot sauce.  I use a hot salsa and it is enough kick for me and just didn't like the taste with the chili powder.  Just make sure you don't use too much salsa or tomato sauce because you want this mixture to be some what on the dry side so your burritos don't get to soggy.  You can always add some more as you go if you need too.  Thanks for sharing my burritos are my daughters favorite.

We love this recipe. I make it in the crockpot on low for about 4 hours and it turns out so perfect! We use this filling to make burritos with black beans, Mexican shredded cheese, sour cream and Lime Cilantro Rice recipe from this site. Delicious!

Put everything in a little crock pot for 3 hours and it was good, but very plain Jane. The picky (meat and potatoes) boyfriend loved it. I tend to like a little more flavorfull food and only liked it. Would make it again because it is a good compromise for rather differently eaters, not because it was so delicious. I think it would be better with more garlic, chili powder, and maybe a little chipotle or ancho powder.

This recipe was so easy and had a delicious flavor! However I used twice the amount of tomato sauce and low sodium taco seasoning. Paired with whole wheat tortillas it was great! The picky eaters in my house couldn't get enough.

This is a good base recipe.i did cook this in my slow cooker which made the meat so tender! I also omitted the taco seasoning and doubled the other spices also I added a small onion chopped and a bell pepper. With my alterations 5 star as written 4 star either way very good recipe!

Very good and easy! I use this recipe when I have left over pulled chicken or rotisserie chicken. I peel it apart and throw it all together. I too recommend using the low sodium taco seasoning. A can of rotel really gives some dimension to the chicken along with the salsa instead of plain tomato sauce. I have used the chicken to throw on top of salads or make tacos/burritos. Great chicken recipe to use for anything really!

I made this recipe for my family for dinner and everyone loved it! I didn't have enough chicken, so all I did was added a few other ingredients to substitute it. Instead of just chicken, I added red peppers, black beans, and fresh tomatoes. The results were great, and am definitely looking forward to having it again to share it with friends and family!

This is a great recipe. I make this at least once a week. I don't do small batches either. My family loves it as well. Always changing things up to make it a little different each time. I'm sure a lot of you get the cans of tomato sauce. I prefer using a puree instead. Good luck all. :-)

I make as written except for the packet of taco seasoning I use a recipe on here that is great for this, and I make this in the crock pot. This is easy and filling. Thank you for a great recipe that I tweaked a bit.

I love it!!  A friend of mine makes this with a few twists!!  I made it similar to hers.  I put a bag of frozen breasts in the crockpot on high until chicken was falling apart.  Frozen made it so they were moist not dry.  Then I added diced tomatoes and a can of green chiles, half a block of cream cheese, garlic and  a pack taco seasoning.  Fantastic flavor!!

Excellent! After pulling the chicken meat, you can add some black beans  and long grain rice (precooked) and after 10 minutes it will be delicious.

Loved this!  Great healthy option versus ground beef.  My kids tore it up.  I have a family of 4 that tend to eat large servings.  So I doubled this recipe and had plenty.  I also tried to do this stove top but like others, I recommend using the crockpot.  It was not easy to shred the chicken so I took them out of the sauce when they were done and shredded them by hand when they were cool.  Crockpot would've been much easier.

My family requests this recipe often.  I've made it as written and played with different versions and it always comes out great!  7/2018 - This recipe is still a family favorite!  I've found that putting the ingredients in the crock pot is the easiest way to cook this - makes busy nights so quick and easy!

This turned out to be one of the best shredded chicken recipes.  Definitely make this in the crock pot since that is really the only way the chicken will get so tender.  Not sure why other reviewers thought this was salty since the seasoning for us was perfect.  I didn't strictly measure everything so maybe that made a difference but I did use a whole 1.25oz package of taco seasoning (non-name brand, local market has a really good one).  I also used tenderloins since that was what I had on hand.  This makes delicious tacos also.  Husband and I are on somewhat strict diets so this was perfect being low fat/low calorie.  The chicken would be great on taco salads too.  Only 4 stars because this should have been written for the crock pot.  :)

I gave it five stars because it is soooo easy to make and tastes great!  Usually these short cut meals can be gross but we loved this.  I try to use a good quality salsa to make sure it has a fresh taste.  It is one of my quick go to recipes now for my family of five.

This was really good! I did make a few changes. I cut up chicken thighs and legs and since i didn't have any salsa, i used an eight oz can of tomato sauceand set it to boil. When it boiled, i added 1/4 cup of sofrito, 1/2 of the taco packet, 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder and the two minced garlic cloves. The cumin seemed like too much so i left it out. I covered the pot and simmered for 10 mins. I added half a can of drained black beans and covered for another five mins. I preheated the oven to 350 degrees and laid a burrito on the chopping board and filled it with chopped lettuce, diced tomato, cheddar and Mexican cheese and then the chicken mixture. I wrapped.ip up, sprinkled a little cheese on the tops and baked it for ten mins. I served it with a little sour cream and it was so delicious! My boyfriend said it was better than taco bell!

This is very similar to the recipe I've been using for shredded chicken taco filling for a long time. The only real difference is that I use the crockpot instead of the stovetop, which really gives the chicken a nice tenderness and slow-cooked flavor. I sometimes replace the salsa with a third of a can of premade enchilada sauce and replace the envelope of taco spices with more individual spices (which makes it less salty), then mix in shredded cheese at the end to make a delicious enchilada filling.

My whole family LOVES this recipe. They always come back for seconds. I made it in the slow cooker as others suggested. I use Trader Joe's taco seasoning. It has a good mix of flavors and has only 260 mg of sodium. I also add more tomato sauce and salsa so there is enough liquid to cover the chicken. We like to use it in tacos. Leftovers freeze well.

Personally, this was WAY too spicy for me, and that was with extra mild salsa and no hot sauce!  I think, though, that the taco seasoning I used (Victorian Epicure) may have been the culprit.  

I wrapped the filling in 6" corn tortillas, put salsa and shredded cheese on top, and baked for 10 minutes at 350F.  I put heaps and heaps of sour cream on top which helped lessen the spicyness somewhat and they ended up being surprisingly enjoyable :)

Used 3 frozen chicken breasts, the homemade taco seasoning, 2 (8 oz) cans tomato sauce (next time try just one can), fresh chopped onion, 2 fresh chopped garlic, 1/2 jalapeño, omitted the hot pepper sauce, (left other ingredients the same) and threw everything in the crock pot on high for about an hour, then low about 3 hours. Felt the chicken was getting tough, so put it on warm another 2 hrs before shredding the chicken. Mixed it back in with the sauce and kept on warm until we ate it about another 2 hrs. Chicken wasnt tough at all, had a really good flavor! Maybe would use more fresh ingredients to fancy it up a bit, but as it was perfect for its simplicity and great leftovers! Made awesome burritos except for the extra sauce making it kinda runny.

I recommend poaching the chicken first in a skillet then shred add the sauce then follow the rest of the recipe. I seasoned my chicken with adobo and used half a taco packet.

This was absolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe becuase we always like leftovers for lunch the next day. I also used my own taco seasoning recipe, and added extra cumin, garlic and chili powder. I put it in burrito shells and covered with additional salsa and cheddar cheese and baked it for about 15 minutes. My husband loved it and has requested that I make it again soon.

This is pretty good, though now that I've made it a few times, I play with it more-first, I omit the tomato sauce and up the salsa to about 1/2 cup. I also make my own taco seasoning, so there is no salt. Honestly, I can't even tell you the amounts-just look on the back of the packaged stuff and mix those ingredients (sans salt) until it looks/smells good to you. The other thing to make it easier is I put it all in a crock pot (small size pot as is) with frozen chicken and let it go all day-the house smells good, and with a 1 yr old, it's an easy dinner. Great in burritos or on chips!

I put cream cheese on the bottom of an 8 1/2 x 14 dish then topped with refried beans then the chicken burrito filling and baked it for about 1/2 hour and served with torilla chips.  Everyone loved it.

Made this for dinner tonight. It is an easy recipe. It is good but not great. I followed directions exactly. Next time would not use as much taco seasoning because it was too much. Would make this again for an easy dinner for the family but not if I was trying to impress guests.  Must say my kids ate it without complaining and that is rare.

This was OK.  Very fast and easy to make.  I made this in the crockpot and the only thing I added was a can of diced green chilis.  We ate this the 1st night in soft tacos and the 2nd day, I made taco salads.  This is good to have on a busy week day.

These make very good burritos!!! However, I added a couple of sprigs of cilantro and instead of taco seasoning mix, I used approx. 2 tsp of granulated chicken boullion. I also added onion flakes. Very fast and easy to make! My family absolutely loved them!

Even after adding a third shredded chicken breast, I found this recipe far too salty and "spice-intense." Maybe use only half of the taco seasoning next time? I still give it 3 stars for ease of preparation, though. I guess I'll have to "play" with it a little.

Very Good.  I boiled a whole chicken till it was fall-off the bone tender, shredded it, doubled all the  rest of the ingredients except the taco seasoning and simmered everything for 30 min.  Made 6 giant burritos.  Add cheese and sour cream....YUM-O!

This was really good but I made my own taco seasoning, it's totally easy to do and just a few spices, don't ruin a good recipe by using a packaged seasoning mix. I boiled my chicken breast for 20 minutes then shredded and put in a cast iron skillet, added the rest of the ingredients and ended up adding a 1/2 cup of the chicken broth.

Delicious! The only ingredients I changed were I only added half a packet of Taco Seasoning as other reviews suggested, and I used three chicken breasts. As far as cooking, I threw it all in the crockpot for about five hours on low and then shredded the chicken and did another hour. Simple and simply wonderful! Thanks for a good dinner!

This was really good and really easy.  I cooked it in my crockpot on high for about 3.5 hours.  My husband loved it!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I put in less taco seasoning.  It feed the two of us with no leftovers!

This is delicious and can be customized to your taste.  I also use Bill Echols seasoning mix from this site.  I like the recipe as written but my family likes a little less spice.  Very easy to adjust.

I use 6-8 oz enchilada sauce instead of 4 oz tomato sauce, and ship on the chili powder and taco seasoning altogether.  I also simmer on low for a good half hour after the initial 15 minutes.  Even better the next day  :)

Yummy!  We just finished dinner and my husband and I love mild mexican food, and this was a hit with BOTH of us!  I shredded 3 cooked chicken breasts and put them in the crockpot, then made the following changes:  I added 6 oz tomato sauce, 1/2 c. salsa, 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning, 1 tsp minced garlic and added, as the recipe calls for, 1 tsp each of chili powder and cumin.  I let it cook for 8 hours--my husband stirred it a few times throughout the day.  Since we aren't big eaters, but love great food, I filled 4 small taco-size flour tortillas and added cheddar cheese inside and also topped them with cheddar cheese, too.  I put them in a microwavable dish and cooked them long enough to melt the cheese.  Delicious!

This was just OK.  My wife and I ate it and our kids ate it, but it had no zip.  My wife said it was to "tomatoey", if that is a word.  After we added some jalapenos and some salsa it made it better, but still just OK.  I probably won't make it again.

I shouldn't give this five stars, because I amend the recipe by so much. I put 3-4 frozen chicken breasts in the slow cooker, topped with a low sodium taco seasoning packet, and a mixture of one can cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup salsa. Cook on low 8 hours. Shred chicken and serve with salsa, sour cream, brown rice, and shredded cheese.

Very nice! Dropped the hot spice/sauce as taco seasoning had enough for my delicate palate. Put them in a casserole under the broiler for a few minutes (just to melt the cheese).

This was pretty good.  I stuffed shells and covered with enchilada sauce and cheese.  Baked in the oven for 15 mins @ 350.  Think that next time I will cook up some onions and peppers with it.

Pretty good, easy to make. Followed directions almost exactly. A little salty  even though I used a low sodium seasoning packet. Next time I will try with homemade salsa and Taco Seasoning I.

Like a few others I too did mine in a slow cooker. I replaced the taco seasoning with actual chicken taco seasoning (1/2 the envelope)and only did 1/2 the cumin as cumin to me is so overpowering.Put on a flour tortilla with a little cheese and now people at my husband job wants me to make these weekly for them..Big hit

Excellent and easy.  I made this in the crock pot and it was great! I did take the chicken breasts out one hour before it was done cooking, shredded them, then put the shredded chicken back in the crock pot for 1 more hour.

I really enjoyed these! I also used the Taco Seasoning 1 recipe on here, and followed someone's advice to place in a skillet with cooked rice, black beans, and fresh cilantro. (It reminded a little bit of Chipotle!)

For my first attempt at burritos, this turned out pretty good.  I combined three recipes from this site:  this one, taco seasoning I, and white cheese sauce.  For this, I used 3 chicken breasts, 8 oz tomato sauce (can you even buy 4 oz cans?), a little more than 1/4 cup salsa, and only half of a 1.25 oz batch of taco seasoning I - MINUS ALL SALT.  I only used salt in my initial light seasoning of the raw chicken, thinking I could add more, and then I never needed it.  I also made a whole 1.25 oz of the taco seasoning thinking I'd need it, and I only used about half.  What I'd recommend is just adding things a little at a time until you have it to the taste and consistency you like.  Like another reviewer, I added rice and black beans to the mix.  Then made the burritos with diced fresh tomatoes , a little cheese, and poured white cheese sauce (recipe also on this site) over the burritos.  Cilantro would've been great but my husband doesn't like it so I left it out.  We did sprinkle hot sauce on top of the final product.  3.5 stars.

So easy and so good! I did make a few changes. Thanks to the reviews, I used low sodium taco seasoning to reduce the salt. Instead of regular chili powder, I used 1/8 teaspoon of chipotle chili powder and omitted the hot sauce. I'm definitely making this again but next time I'm going to triple the recipe for freezing. I used this to make quesadillas, burritos, and salad. YUMMY!

Next time Im going to add cheese inside, and sauce over it.  Sorta enchiladaize it.  To much sodium, need to get low sodium taco seasoning.  Other than the high sodium, it was really good.

I did as recommended by others.  I took 5 frozen chicken breast and put them in the crockpost with 1.5 times more of the sauce.  The chicken didn't pull apart as anticipated, but I still had very good end result.  I filled tortilla shells, put them in my baking dish and covered with the remaining sauce (which I strained) and then piled on the cheeese and baked in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes.  It was very, very good!

Yummy!  Love it.  Added hot salsa to it.  Will probably add some chopped jalepenos next times.   Just cook some rice and it's great with it stuffed in a soft shell!  YUM!

Easy and versatile.  I made enchiladas with canned sauce one night, then 2 nights later served the leftover filling in corn tortillas with cheese sauce.

This was a very good filling.  I left out the Taco Seasoning as recommended, and added Lemon Pepper to the Cumin, Garlic and Chili Powder.  I used it to fill Corn Tortilla's which I quickly fried, and added shredded cheese and sliced olives to the chicken, then wrapped them and placed face down in a pan with some Green Enchilada Sauce under and over, with a little more cheese and olives on the top before baking @ 350* for 20 minutes. Top with a dollop of Sour Cream.  Served with a green salad with tomato, avocado & Kiwi. Very tasty.

This was a good receipe but not spicy to me at all.  I used chicken tenders which equaled 2 boneless breasts, 8oz tomato sauce, 1/4 salsa, 1/2 can refried beans.  I also added but didn't measure, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder and hot red pepper.  It was easy to throw it all in a pot on the stove and shredded fine.  I ate it on top of brown rice.

This was really good and I thought it was even better the next day. I used McCormick's Burrito seasoning and it was great. I also found a small can of salsa in the Mexican aisle that was just the right size for this recipe and a small can of Mexican hot tomato sauce. It turned out pretty spicy which we like.   EDIT: I tried something different this time and it came out even better. I sauteed some onions and garlic before the tomato sauce and I used the taco seasoning from the website so I could control the amount of salt used. I also broke up the chicken sooner because it was too tough last time (maybe I was cooking too high). It came out perfect this time. I added some shredded cheese and served with sour cream and refried beans. This recipe is going in my regular rotation.

This is a great recipe!!  I don't like handling raw chicken so I was happy to take the advice of others and put two frozen skinless chicken breasts in a slow cooker with the other ingredients.  I think only about two and a half minutes elapsed between the time I found this on AR to when I had everything cooking away in the crock pot.  I haven't bought taco seasoning in years.  I seasoned with chili powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin, garlic.  It smelled so good I didn't think I could wait for my husband to get home before digging in to it.  Delicious!  Even the picky princesses ate their burritos.

My Family loved this!!!  I added some pinto beans and rice as suggested by other posters. After wrapping them I poured enchillada sauce over the top of them and toped it with chese.  Popped it in the over for 15 minutes.  My 10 year old the picky eater(want to pull my hair out picky) Ate every last bite of his...he also took it for lunch the next day! Will make this a regular meal!

This is a great starter filling!  I was forced to alter it one night (didn't have a jar of salsa on hand).  Mixed cumin and taco season with tomato sauce, sauteed some onions and chopped poblanos/japs, and had nearly the same results.  Coated the burritos with the remaining mixture and baked.  Voila.  I won't give this recipe out as the family swore I ordered them from a Mexican restaurant and tried to call them my own :-)

We loved this recipe!  My husband must have said 5 times, "It has such good flavor"!  I had to omit the cumin and the chili powder because I didn't have them with me.  I used Roasted Garlic tomato sauce and only one clove of garlic.  De-lish!

We thought this was great, we did serve this different, and I did make a mistake.
I accidentally put in a 14 oz can of tomato sauce and it was really good.  Still salty though.  I cooked in the crockpot and served it over brown rice.  We used the left over sauce to pour a bit more over the rice.  It was tasty and I would make it again....just with less seasoning.

This was pretty good, though I still think it was sort of bland.  Could possibly be because I made a huge pot full of it, and the amount of seasonings could have been off.  I divided it and froze much of it, this freezes very well.  I also used homemade taco seasoning because I was worried about the salt content.  I used half breast meat and half thigh meat, which I think really added to the recipe.  If you're looking for something to make that will freeze well for later, try this.  Just be sure to test out the taste to ensure it suits your own!

I didn't really treat this as "burrito filling", but more of just a spicy chicken dish.  I chopped up the chicken into small pieces, so it would cook faster.  I also changed up the ingredients some. I used mushroom spaghetti sauce since that's all I had on hand. I only used 1 TBS of taco seasoning instead of the whole package.  No cumin because I didn't have any.  Since it dried out while cooking, instead of adding water, I used a bottle of Blue Moon beer. I added some fresh parsley. I also added 1 1/2 TBS of Old Bay seasoning, which I think gave it an additional kick.

I have to say this is the 1st recipe that my husband & children loved! I made a few changes: I added salt and did not use too much cumin and hot sauce.
I also used the filling in tortillas and cooked it in a 9X13 dish sprayed and coated with salsa. Spread more salsa on top and added cheddar cheese. Baked covered for 15 min. then uncovered for 5 more min. Delish!!

This was so good!  I'm a beginner cook and this was super easy but tasted great.  My husband was very impressed and happy to have a new regular meal idea.  The only change was that i used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves (simply out of laziness!).

Instead of adding water when the sauce began to dry out, I added 1/4 cup of beer. Also, a little too salty for me, so next time I will try a low sodium taco seasoning, or use less taco seasoning.

This was GREAT!  I also used the low sodium taco seasoning, and it turned out perfect!

I make a different version of this every week. Going to try a slow cooker tonight. Simple, and easy to be a little creative with. Bravo!

This burrito filling was really good! My husband and I like our food extra spicy so we used HOT taco seasoning and it added the perfect amount of heat, not too much and not too little. I also used 1/2 tbs. of garlic powder instead of minced garlic. The flavor was delicious, we topped the burritos with shredded cheese and sour cream. Yummie! We will make this again!

This was so delicious!  I can always tell when I make a hit when my husband scrapes his plate clean.  I made it on the stove-top and added hot salsa and 1/2 of the taco seasoning and served over spanish rice with cuban style black beans.  My husband took leftovers the next day for lunch and said it was really good the 2nd day.  I will definitely be making this again!

Used others' suggestion of four chicken breasts, cooked on high in crockpot for 4 hours. My family absolutely loved this.  Will definitely make again!

This was great and quick.  I would def make this again.  However, I would not use as much taco seasoning.  It was a bit to salty.

Yum, Yum and yum! I was pleasantly suprised at how good this is. As others I doubled everything except for the taco seasoning.  Serve with "Best black beans" and rice.  So simple but really tasty, what's not to like?!!

AWESOME!  I will be making this every time we have enchiladas!!!  I thought for sure that with all of the spices it would be way too spicy, but it wasn't!  It was perfect!  I used the Taco Seasoning I as recommended by another reviewer, and it was incredible!!!

EXCELLENT DISH-WE USED THE FILLING IN WARM TORTILLAS WITH LETTUCE, CHEESE, TOMATOES AND FRESH CILANTRO. I WOULD MAKE THEM A LITTLE DRIER NEXT TIME IF I FIXED THEM THE SAME WAY, BUT DELICIOUS

This is a great recipe! I loved the seasoning exactly as listed. The only thing I'll do differently next time is pre-chop the chicken since shredding it was pretty difficult/time-consuming and I don't mind chunks of chicken in burritos/tacos/tostadas. Yum! Thanks for the great recipe.

I just got done eating this recipe.  It was just okay...maybe I made it wrong?  I didn't have any cumin on hand so I omitted that and the sauce seemed to be lacking in flavor and it wasn't really salty enough for me unlike what most people were saying.  Maybe I'll try again with the correct spices.

I thought that this was very good.  I used a 3-breast pkg of chicken from the store along with an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and left the rest of the seasonings the same.  I thought that it was very tasty but agree that it was a little on the salty side.  I found it difficult to shred the chicken after only 15 minutes of simmering.  This might need to cook a little longer-a crock pot would probably give great results.  I made this with the "Best Black Beans" from this site, rolled up together in the burrito.  The cilantro in the beans gives this a fresher flavor and cuts the saltiness a little.  I will make this again!

Just ok. By itself it is very salty and doesn't taste good. In a taco with refried beans, cheese and sour cream it taste ok. Not my favorite.

I moved from California to London three months ago and this recipe is just what I've been craving.  I forgot to add the taco seasoning, used a whole can of diced tomatoes, red and green tabasco, and some chopped up red chiles.  I used the Spicy Bean Salsa recipe from this site for the salsa.    I made burritos with the chicken and some low-fat cheese and they were excellent.

I absolutely love this recipe - I've come back to it time and time again.  There simply is nothing better, easier, or tastier for a great chicken burrito!

I made this when i had company over one night and we all loved it.  I ended up doubling the recipe, but i didn't add 2 packages of taco seasoning because it looked like it was enough with all the other spices and just one package seasoning, it turned out great and will definately make again.  Thanks for sharing it!

Pretty good. I used this filling to make chimichangas as per the "Shredded Beef Chimichangas" recipe. (I added shredded cheddar into the chimichangas, too.) I will make them again.

This is one of the few recipes that my whole family actually likes, and has become a staple in our house.  It's easy to make, and really does freeze well.  I eliminate the chili powder and reduce the amount of taco seasoning.  I've been making it for several years now, and just want to say thanks to Juli Fish for a great, great recipe.

I tried this recipe because it looked easy and good. It was pretty much both, except pulling the chicken apart took a little longer than other methods. But I was feeling lazy, and it was good that way; I just wanted someone else to pull it for me :-)! I will definitely make this again since it is very easy, even when you are feeling lazy (or does that just happen to me?....)

This was okay don't know that i'll fix it again. If I did I would definatly use some onion in it either raw in the burrito or sauteed beforehand then added in with the sauce. I also would try it with less taco seasoning.

This was really good and easy to make.  We had chicken tacos with it and then made chicken nachos with the left-overs the next day.  Yum!

This was okay and I might make it again but it really wasn't anything more than shreaded chicken with bbq sauce with a kick.  I expected something a little more mexican but it really wasn't.  It didn't taste too bad though.

i never personnally liked prepackaged but i see that sometimes u must compensate to get a good taste. this recipe has showed me that u can make tacos in under 40 min and still have them taste good.

This was a hit at our house! It was the perfect amount of spiciness for my husband and I. He even polished off the leftovers for breakfast the next morning! I spooned it into warmed tortillas along with sour cream and Mexican cheese and then broiled in the oven for about 5 minutes. I would also suggest combining all ingredients and bringing to a boil before adding the chicken, this way everything will be combined evenly. We were short on time so I only simmered for 10-15 minutes and it still turned out great.. any longer and the chicken would've been too dry. I will definitely be making this again!
