My husband and I are making truffle trays for 20 staff and nurses at my dialysis treatment center. We picked this recipe for part of our tray. We doubled the recipe and added twice as much ginger. Then we added about 1.5 teaspoons nutmeg. The flavors came together very well. We rolled them up and put them in the fridge overnite. The next day we coated them with melted white chocolate or rolled them in crushed pecans.  We have about 50 of these. We also made the Easy Decadent Truffles and the Peanut Butter Balls III from this site.

I followed the directions exactly and found the dough easy to work with and it held good shape while being dipped, but while many people enjoyed one of these very few went back for a second.  The gingerbread flavor is heavy on the ginger and I think too much for all but the most die hard gingerbread fans.
