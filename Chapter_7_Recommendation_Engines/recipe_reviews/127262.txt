I've made these for several years and the only thing I do differently is to line the baking sheets with parchment.  This keeps cleanup to the bare minimum and these are wonderful.  They should be made in small batches as they don't retain their crispness for long but they are delicious.  I forgot to add that I often use liquid egg whites for this recipe with no discernable difference.

I love coconut so was not surprised at how much I liked these. I was shocked, however, when my husband, who doesn't really like coconut, kept sneaking into the kitchen to eat them. They're so easy to prepare, are not overly sweet, and have a good texture. The only thing I changed was that I reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup, and followed someone's advice and did half almond, half vanilla extract. They are great, and you could even fancy them up with cherry's or chocolate.

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with moist and delicious perfection!  I dressed them up a bit by drizzing melted chocolate on some - it wasn't enough to change the flavor, but just made them look gorgeous.  A favorite on the cookie tray this year!

I made these cookies a first time and it was a success, but I had replaced the almond extract by vanilla extract, and added sliced almonds.
This time around I tried with almond extract and found they weren't quite good, also, they turned out big and flat!
The difference I think, was that I used large eggs.
This recipe is better with 4 small eggs!

Not only super easy, but super delicious and I don't care for coconut.  Made these for my father-in-law for Father's Day as they are his favorite cookie.  Used 1/2 almond extract and half vanilla extract for a great flavor.

These were delicious, and a hit for Christmas! I used the chocolate dipped variation, and lightly dipped just the bottoms into chocolate. They were very tasty.

These could not be easier to make or more delicious to eat.  They keep extremely well in a plastic bag.  Sometimes, when I'm feeling fancy, I dunk the bottoms in melted chocolate and cool on waxed paper.  They are elegant enough to serve at a dinner party.

My first time making macaroons and they came out fab, very easy with incredible results.  I dipped some of the bottoms of the macaroons in melted chocolate, lovely!

These are perfect just the way they are, don't change a thing :) Next time I think I'll dip the very bottom in some chocolate and let them set up on parchment paper.

Very good and very easy to make.  These cookies taste like "Mounds" candy bar filling so I melted some chocolate and drizzled it over the tops.

I have a wheat allergy so I used rice flour instead of regular flour.  They turned out wonderfully!  Don't try to add different amounts of the ingredients or they turn out flat.

I have made this twice now and each time everyone raves about them. It is so so easy! I used only a 1/2 tsp of almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. As well as 3 Extra large egg whites. Really Good.

These are so easy & yummy. I only had 3 eggs & scaled down to 28 servings. These are great in the bon bon shape that's shown, or flattened down a bit before baking for a browner, chewier cookie. Yum!

I made this for Passover substituting potato starch in place of the flower (6Tb flour = 3Tb potato starch). They were great! I piped some chocolate over them by putting some melted chocolate in a sandwich bag and cutting a corner off. They were a huge hit!

This is the kind of macaroon I like.  I followed the recipe exactly, it's the same as the recipe on the Baker's coconut package.  I dipped 1/2 of each macaroon in chocolate and it was a huge hit at my niece's birthday party (both with the kids and adults)

I had made these a few years ago and lost the recipe.  I'm so glad I found it.  These are really good but the parchment paper is a must.  Dipping in the chocolate makes them deadly.

Perfection! No changes needed. However, I kept the 1tsp of almond extract but added 1tsp of vanilla and dipped the bottoms in some Dove dark chocolate. I used 4 large eggs and they were perfectly fluffy, golden crisp on the outside and oh so chewy on the inside. Cutting the sugar probably wouldn't hurt, but they weren't too sweet for anyone. Parchment paper is better than butter/flouring the cookie sheet.

These were the best macaroons I have ever made. The recipe was sooo easy and the end result was delicious. I made these exactly as stated, except that I made them for Easter, so I tinted the mixture light green and mounded them into mini muffin liners. I baked them for about 20 mins. (my oven is really hot). As soon as I removed them from the oven, I placed a jellybean into each. They turned out soooo cute:) I yielded about 27 cookies from the recipe. This will be my go to from now on. Thanks:)

Awesome and easy, is there any thing better in a recipe?!

I made these for all the administration staff at each of my children's schools.  They were very inexpensive to make, look very little time and were such a hit!

One thing I did change...I made them a little bigger than a Tablespoon in size so that I could put a toasted almond in the center of each one.  I, of course, dipped the bottom in melted milk choclate and chilled them upside down in the fridge for about 15 minutes so the chocolate could firm.  Everyone raved about them!

I've tried to find a good coconut macaroon recipe for years, but every time I made them, the egg white would drain out the bottom and cook in a pool around the cookies. The simple addition of flour solves this problem.   I like to make these, cover them in chocolate and then sprinkle some chopped almond on top. Sort of an Almond Joy coconut macaroon. Delicious!

I doubled the recipe and made these with matzo cake meal for an event next week's during Passover. Mix them with your hands, and you'll find the recipe has the right amount of egg as is.

This did not work for me very well. I lowered the sugar amount like other reviewer's suggested and it was really wet. I ended up adding some more coconut and flower to stiffen it up some and it just did not turn out like I hoped. I think I was looking for a lighter, airier macaroon. I will keep trying and I at least learned from this attempt.

Had to cook at 300, I think my oven is hotter than it should be.  Not soft and moist like the restaurants and I followed the recipe to a T.  Still very tasty tho. TY

I just finished a three-way coconut macaroon bake-off, and this recipe was the winner.  It's not quite as sweet as the recipes that call for sweetened condensed milk (although it's still very sweet, don't worry), and the almond extract gives the cookies some extra pizzazz.  This recipe's texture is also good; chewy, but not too sticky.

These were very good!  The perfect ending to a homemade chinese feast.  They arent too heavy and not too sweet.

The flavor and texture are both great which is why I gave 5 stars...I wish they would stick together just a little bit better but, no matter, they are very good!

Although they were tasty, even after I added a fifth large egg white, I found them to be on the dry side when cooked.

These weren't what I was looking for...they were good, but "fluffy" and I was looking for something more dense.

These aren't the best macaroons I've ever had, awfully chewy, but it may be because I had to use powdered egg whites instead of regular ones. Also I didn't have almond extract so I used orange; it was a great flavor.  I used sweetened coconut because it was on hand, but should have reduced the sugar; they were a tad too sweet.  Any way about it, they got snarfed by the locals!

Made these today for my niece, who LOVES Macaroons. Never having made them before, I didn't know what to expect. But she informed me they were "the bomb" and she loved them! So, I am guessing that's a good thing. They did taste delicious! And very easy to make.

These are very yummy and oh so easy to make. The only thing I did different was using 3 egg whites instead of 4 because I had large eggs. I made them plain this time, but next time I will dip the tops with chocolate.

Unbelievably delicious! I brought these to a party and they disappeared. Although perfect as they are, these also taste great with candied ginger - dice and mix right in the batter.

Excellent cookie. Just the right amount of crispness when first from the oven, and still tasty after storing for a few days even when the crispness goes away.  These didn't make it to the holiday cookie tray, as my husband and I ate them all.  I'm making another batch tonight.
