In the past, my family included salads to our meat dishes because we knew the importance of vegetables, but fattoush is one of few salads we actually crave. In fact, I make a larger batch (separating the pita chips so that they don't become soggy) to use for lunch the next day. Regarding those pita chips, sorry, you can't replace the real thing with the store bought variety. The pita chips make this salad what it is and besides, it only adds about ten minutes - including clean up! - to cook time. Just make sure to carefully watch the frying and only cook until pita bread is LIGHT brown in color. Remove from stove and let them continue to cook in the hot oil for another minute until they are darker. (If not, you quickly run the risk of burning the bread.) I do recommend having all the salad ingredients on hand. In regards to the dressing, if you don't have/don't want to buy onion flakes and celery salt, just add more lemon pepper (although I find the crushed lemon or sumac sold in Middle Eastern shops to be better alternatives) and more white wine vinegar to give it that extra tang. This salad is a great match for beef dishes and we also like it for our Middle Eastern mezze night where we make this salad, hummus and falafel. Thanks for the recipe.

Love it! For the dressing I added Sumac (a healthy palm full), 2 cloves of chopped fresh garlic, 1/4 cup more lemon juice, and coarse sea salt.

We enjoyed this. The pita 'croutons' were a great idea! I omitted the parsley because I don't like it, and once I started eating, I went back and added more mint. The only thing I will change in the future is to use red onion instead of green - I like to really taste onion in my salad. Thanks!

I was looking for a simple Mediterranean dressing similar to what I have had at Persian & other restaurants.  This is exactly what I was looking for!  I made minor tweaks based on my own preferences and added Sumac as one reviewer suggested.  Thanks!

Love, love, love it!  I made a few changes though.  Bought garlic flavored, baked pita chips (because it's easier), added feta, omitted mint (didn't have any), used red wine vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar (I had red not white), and used pepper and lemon zest in place of the lemon pepper (didn't have lemon pepper).  Everyone I've served it to loves it and asks for the recipe.  Thanks!!!!

Great salad!  Very fresh, crisp and taste bud worthy.  Mint, parsley and cilantro added so much zip to this salad - then add the dressing that is packed with flavor.  It is a great Mediterranean salad.  The dressing alone is worth making this salad.  Thanks Dfoods for sharing.

This salad was exceptional! I made last night for a light dinner, and was blown away by the results. My Dad, who is a very picky eater and not very "experimental" when it comes to cuisine, absolutely loved it. The dressing was light, flavorful, and balanced. Surprisingly, the mint did not overpower the salad, and the various flavors blended together in perfect harmony. I added sweet onion because I LOVE onion in salad, and some chick peas for fiber and protein. We also topped our plates with a few sprinkles of feta, and I left out the pitas to make it healthier. WILL be a new staple weekend meal for my family. The preparation is time consuming, but WELL worth the wait!

I learned about Fattoush from a friend, and fell in love with this recipe. I love the mint, parsley and cilantro. She gave me a bottle of pomegranate molasses because she says that Fattoush dressing is always made with it, so I throw that in there too.

Did this last night and just loved the combinations.  I placed the salad dressing in a small jar which allowed us to add what we wanted.

perfect . I use 3-4 cups of lettuce , 3 tomatoes, 1/4 cup of mint , 2 radishes and 1/4 onion thinly sliced .for the dressing I skipped the onion flakes since I have a real onion , skipped the celery salt  , substituted the garlic powder with one clove of garlic (minced )and for the authenticated touche I sprinkle the salad with a middle eastern spice called Sumac (2 tsp of Sumac)

We loved this! My husband nearly ate the entire bowl before I asked if I could have  some too! I made the "pita" chips using homemade flour tortillas and fried those. Delicious!

I really enjoyed this salad, but my husband and kids found the dressing too lemon-y to really enjoy it.

Pretty Amazing since it's just a pretty basic salad. My daughter works in a Lebanese restaurant and she said you can bake the pitas too, as long as they are crunchy. I'll try that next time. Made this salad exactly as written. My daughter said to add purslane. I'll have to look for that.  Really loved it!

Tasted very authentic - like my moms!  You don't have to use white wine vinegar - I used apple cider vinegar.  Also, traditional fattoush doesn't need celery - I left it out.  And you can't go wrong with more lemon!  Make a bigger portion than you need because the salad tastes even better the next day because it soaks up all the juices - YUM!
