This is a marvelous recipe!  I could put it on almost any food in my fridge!  I found the correct cream at Trader Joe's, an organic one, and my buttermilk was by Knudsen.  I was just going to make a half a batch but went for the whole thing.  Am I ever glad!  This is better than sour cream!  Creme Fraiche doesn't have the same holding power of sour cream as far as consistency goes, and it's not quite as sour.  But delicious it is!  I highly recommend that you try this!  Thank you, Chef John!

Ultra-pasteurized heavy whipping cream works just fine. I use it exclusively and it has never failed to make great Creme Fraiche. Don't waste your time looking for pasteurized. I use Ball canning jars to make this great sour cream in and will never buy another plastic tub of it.

The crème fraiche was made exactly as written, and used in conjunction with Chef John's Classic Beef Stroganoff recipe. We used pasteurized cream, and found it at Whole Foods. One cautionary note . . . pasteurized cream has a fairly short shelf life so the crème fraiche will not last long in the fridge IF any is leftover. This added a special finishing touch to the beef stroganoff and so easy to make. Thank you, Chef John.

I let it sit on the top of my espresso machine or the top of my refrigerator.  It is always warmer in those areas and it just works better than leaving it on the counter top.  Maybe I just keep the house a little too cool? LOL

This recipe is so easy and delicious.  I used my yogurt maker and it was done in 8 hours. So easy and didn't have to wait 2 days.  I poured everything in the maker and went to bed, when I got up this morning it was perfect!

If you haven't used sweetened whipped creme fraiche in place of whipped cream, you're missing the best dessert topping of your life! I lost my source of creme fraiche (TJ's) when we moved to Tampa. Thanks, Chef John, for showing me how to make it at home.

This is terrific!  I used ultra-pasteurized cream as that is all I could find, and it worked just fine.  This was pretty cool to make, and who knew it was so easy?!  I used it to make Creme Caramel and BLT Pasta, both also Chef John's recipes, and both are truly amazing.  Thank you, Chef John- you continue to make me look like a culinary genius  :)

We really loved this!  It has become something we just do any time the heavy cream has been sitting a few days and needs to be put to use.  It is so delicious and family have been taking it home with them whenever there is extra.

I've been making creme fraiche using this method for almost 20 years.  Easy peasy and SO tasty.  It's also good made with Brown Cow yogurt instead of buttermilk (the live cultures are important).

This does work with ultra pasteurized cream, I've done it more than once when ultra pasteurized was all I could find.  You may need more buttermilk/yogurt or a little more time for it to culture.

This recipe is the absolute BEST.  So easy, and so delicious!  Never going to the store for sour cream again.  I used ultra-pasteurized heavy whipping cream, since I could not find "pasteurized."  Work just fine.   Thank you Chef John for this delightful recipe.

this was great, love this because it is super easy, and you can simmer/reduce sauces with this unlike sour cream.  and it tastes soooo much better!  annnnnddddd waaaaayyyy cheaper than creme freiche that you can buy at the fancy dancy grocery stores (if you can find it at all).  i used this to make chefs stroganoff and chicken and dumplings, very very rich and delicious.  just be sure to be patient and let it set up properly for 48 hours.  well worth the wait!  tangy goodness!  thanks chef!

This is a good recipe although I make mine with equal parts sour cream and heavy (whipping) cream. Mix it well and place in an air tight container and leave on your counter top for 24 hrs then refrigerate.  Amazing flavor and texture!!

I went to 4 stores trying to find heavy cream with no luck and ended up with ultra-pasteurized whipping cream. I doubled the batch since I had a big glass jar. I didn't have a coffee filter or cheese cloth and used a paper towel which I doubled. Followed the directions for culturing and tried it 2 days later. It tasted like whipping cream with buttermilk. Wasn't impressed. However, the longer it cultures, the better it tasted. I've used it for Chef's John's BLT Pasta and his beef stroganoff along with the simple scones, and key lime pie IV recipe on this site. I'm not sure how long this would last in the fridge. I'm still in search of heavy cream and see what the taste difference between them.

I made this to go along with Chef John's Beef Stroganoff and it was so easy to make.  I have never had creme fraiche before so I didn't know what it was going to taste like.  It was thick, creamy, and delicious.  I will never buy sour cream again!  Thank you Chef John!

This is wonderful....had to rest it on the fireplace mantel to get it to thicken.  
We live upstate NY and the house is never 70-75*!!! It was worth the wait.
Thanks Chef John!

I used 1 1/2  cup Whipping Cream (jar was too small for all of the whipping cream) and 2 tablespoons Seco Cultured  Buttermilk powder.  I used the Seco powder as it is Cultured and I did not want to have wasted buttermilk in my fridge. In my local store the heavy cream was ultra pasteurized but the whipping cream was regular pasteurized so I used the regular cream. I started the culture around 5 pm and tasted it the next morning around 7 am. It tasted like sweet whipping cream so I left it alone. When I tasted it at 2 pm - ZING big difference and it tasted as described but it was still thin. I put the lid on the jar and put it in the fridge and let it thicken. Bottom line - use the powder and you won't have to deal with a quart of liquid leftover buttermilk. Try this and see. Your results may vary..........

Thank you, Chef Jon for yet another wonderful recipe. I had never made Creme fraiche before, and was a little skeptical about the mixture actually thickening. I followed your instructions exactly, using the recommended ingredients. The consistency and taste were amazing!

Fantastic! Sad most people don't know how easy this is. I use my own buttermilk from making my own butter (also easy, just look up a recipe!). A few tips for people: 1) It doesn't get as thick as store bought. Even after refrigerating. But the beauty of that is that it's all natural. No added thickeners and/or preservatives. Once you eat it this way a few times, you'll never go back. 2) DO NOT let it sit on the counter much more than the recommended 24 hours!!! I left mine out for 36 hours to try to get it thicker and it exploded out of the jar, all over the counter. Unusable. Lesson learned. 3) From the finished creme fraiche you can make an amazing Mexican crema.  Just add lime, a dash of salt and some ancho chili powder. So much you can do with this!

Like many others, I was wondering how long I can store this in the fridge. The most “official” answer I found was from the California Milk Advisory Board which says it will keep up to 8 weeks in the fridge. Most bloggers with homemeade creme fraiche recipes state it will keep 2-3 weeks in the fridge. I don’t think it will ever last long enough for me to find out who’s right :)

Quite delicious!  
I made this using RAW heavy cream and cultured buttermilk.
I followed the directions exactly.
This is as thick as cream cheese and has a wonderful full texture.   

I put a dollop of it on top of my hot soup.  I've used it on toast as a light spread.  I've used it with jam.  I've put it on top of my  hot food -- whatever it may be.,  It lends an incredibly rich flavor to everything I've put it on.

I have made this several times with low fat cultured buttermilk and ultra pasteurized heavy cream and it always turns out fine.  I like 4 T of B'milk to 2 cups of cream.
HOWEVER, I made it yesterday with 1 cup of LIGHT Cream and 2 T of b'milk just to see if it worked and it is great! Used the oven with the light on.

I followed the recipe to the letter, using pasteurized (not ultra pasteurized) heavy cream and whole buttermilk (both found at Whole Foods), and have just been rewarded with 2 Ball jars of exquisite creme fraiche, for a fraction of what I've been paying for the one from Vermont Butter and Cheese!  I am over the moon, and will serving it with potato pancakes, caviar and smoked salmon on Christmas Day!

made twice, would not thicken.  I used Bavarian Buttermilk which has 9gms of fat.  Thought this buttermilk would do a better job.  Would not thicken, very runny.  Thought it would be easy.  Followed directions, sterilized, still no results.  Perhaps because I am not a Chef, it did not turn out.

I will give this all the stars although I haven't tried it yet, based on other reviews and that it is a Chef John recipe. I would like to try this recipe but I live in Hawaii and the temperature rarely gets down to 70-75 degrees except during the winter months.  I actually could make it today but don't have any of the ingredients/supplies needed and work calls.  I will try it while it's cooler but what can be done when the weather is too warm?

Mine was runny the first time I made it, cut back on the heavy cream by just a bit and it was perfect the second time, so delicious!

It's not every recipe you try where the results turn out exactly like the video... This is certainly one of them! This was surprisingly so easy to make and I'm so glad I did. My kitchen was a bit warmer than room temperature, 79 degrees according to the portable thermostat. What can I say, summer in The South. I highly recommend everyone to try this. Any skill lever is able to achieve homemade crème fraiche. My one recommendation, use CULTURED buttermilk.

This is hard for me to rate because this recipe is my introduction to creme fraiche, so I have nothing to compare it to. I didn't even know what it was. I poured the ingredients into a mason jar and covered with a clean dish towel and tied with kitchen twine. I was hesitant to leave heavy cream with buttermilk on the counter all night, thinking I would have a spoiled mess in the morning. But no, the ingredients didn't turn. I gave it a stir and screwed on the lid and put it in the refrigerator for 2 days. I used it to coat pasta in a pasta salad. Such an easy recipe.

Great flavor and simple to make.  I put the sterilized jar in a card board box with an LED light bulb for 24 hours and the temperature was between 73 - 75 degrees.  I also used Cacique Mexican brand Cream.  It was the only Pasteurized cream I could find at my local store.  Good stuff and just in time for Super Bowl street taco's!!

Excellent recipe. But not sure what others are talking about in terms of pasteurized dairy having a shorter shelf life. I have a degree in microbiology and pasteurized lasts much longer than unpasteurized as the pasteurization process kills the microbes that contribute to spoiling. Maybe that’s what you meant to say?

FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY.
WOW! OH MY GOSH IS THIS GOOD.
No more store bought for me! I keep eating it straight out of the jar.
Thank you very much. You have put money back in my budget. Creme Fresh here is $7.99 for 6 ounces. The cost of the buttermilk and cream is half that and it yielded 32+ounces.

This is a little kitchen magic  in a jar!  So easy. Used standard grocery store heavy cream and buttermilk.  Put it on top of the fridge for warmth and it was a thing of beauty the very next day!
Really good onverything.

Excellent! Works great on all food but I have found it to be very tasty in Scrambled Eggs. DH loves eggs, I don't, but have to confess I loved Scrambled Eggs this morning with milk and Creme Fraiche blended in. Yummm.

Thank you Chef John for this recipe. Started this on Saturday morning and had your beef stroganoff Sunday evening. All I could find was ultra pasterized cream but, it worked just fine. I live in Southeast Texas where it is a little warmer so the Creme Fraiche set up in a little less than 24 hours. Delish!

Fantastic!  My first time making Creme Fraiche.  Used a coffee filter and some duct tape to save a trip to the store, then transferred to a glass pyrex bowl with tight lid.  Can't wait to share this with my family.

Used it on Sweet Potato Burritos today, and going to use it to make Chef John's BLT Pasta Salad on Sunday!

Very good and super easy.  Now I need to figure out what to make with all of the leftover buttermilk!!!  My wife accidentally bought low fat cultured buttermilk, so I am not quite sure what it did to the taste, but I thought it tasted great anyway.

Loved it. This recipe is sour cream x1000 !!  Perfect texture and the flavor is highly elevated. Will definitely keep this on hand.   It’s perfection on Chef John’s beef stroganoff.  Instagram: #TheChubbyHubby

Good but I like the higher tang of sour cream. I found the bottom closet to my liking so I audit if you stirred it you may get that but that could also shorten its shelf life.

I used ultra pasteurized heavy whipping cream because that’s what I could easily find, and the store branded buttermilk. Put the jar in the oven with the light on for 24 hours. I guess I didn’t pay close attention because I put a mason jar lid on it rather than a coffee filter. Then refrigerated it for 24 hours. Couldn’t have come out more perfect! And so easy! BTW I tried it in my Instant Pot on the yogurt setting for 8 hours too. My yogurt comes out perfect, but for some reason the creme fraiche did not. It never set up. If I want pourable creme fraiche then the IP method is certainly faster and it still tasted great.

Well Chef John, you did it again! I really love this and will never buy sour cream again!!! You are very correct in not using ultra pasteurized. I get my cream and cultured buttermilk at the co-op.

Too late I realized I had purchased ultra-pasteurized cream but started the process anyway. As Chef John suggested, I put the cream jar with 3T buttermilk in the oven to warm. Then my husband decided to make a frozen pizza and heated the oven to 450*. I got the jar out asap and thought that was the end. Stashing it in the refrigerator, I figured I might at least be able  bake a cake with it and started a new jar with organic pasteurized cream. This morning the pizza heated jar held really good creme fraiche, which I added to my morning coffee. The second batch is looking good and about to go into the refrigerator for its second 24-hour rest. I am happy to have so much homemade creme fraiche for Christmas Eve to dollop on sugar plum cake, apple cranberry pie, and pecan pie. Thank you, Chef John, for a great recipe.

Used heavy cream and buttermilk.  The house is pretty cool in the winter, and because gas costs, I don’t keep the house at 70°F at night, so I put my ingredient filled Ball mason jar in the warmest area of the house, the boiler room!  Came out perfect!  Thank you for this recipe!  I’ll never buy store bought again.

Is it salvageable? I used cultured buttermilk and heavy cream per specified proportions but after i check on it after the cooling period it was still liquid. :(

Should I leave it out more or just keep it in the fridge or start over?

Wow! Great!  Best sour cream I've every had. And it may sit for a while but it doesn't actually take any personal time at all. Just the patience to wait 2 days.  But worth the wait! A big dollop on my Chicken Taco Soup and yum!

My French boyfriend has been looking for Creme Fraise since he has gotten here and we couldn't find it anywhere.  I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a shot. I am so glad I did. It's excellent and as easy too make as it is to buy and according to boyfriend....MUCH better than store bought!  Thank you for another wonderful recipe you!

My first time having or making Creme Fraiche...it was very easy to make, and so very good!  I'm looking at recipes to see which one I want to use it in.  I did already use it to top off the Roasted Butternut Squash Soup also on this website from Chef John...very tasty!  I may use this on a flan recipe (on this site), or a cheesecake recipe.  Whatever I choose, I know it will be top notch because the Creme Fraiche is just that!

Love this, delish! The heavy cream was from Costco, not the best quality but it's what I had on hand, it still worked and was really good. Next time I'm getting grass fed organic cream to see the difference. I will probably use this as much as possible instead of sour cream, maybe even instead of yogurt in some cases. It was so easy.

Like all of Chef John's recipes, this turned out perfectly.  I wasn't sure what "heavy cream" meant so I used whipping cream. The texture came out something like mascarpone (in fact, this would be amazing in a tiramisu).  Next time I will try it out with table cream and see what that does to the texture.  I used a rubbermaid container because my glass container cracked when I sterilized it. It all worked. I am super pleased with this recipe.  My family thinks sour cream is a food group, so at least now I can control what goes into it and them.

I made this and it is great.  However, I froze the buttermilk left over so I could make it again, but when I thawed the buttermilk to use in the next batch of creme frachais, it did not thicken.  Can anyone tell me why.  Thanks

I will never buy tub sour cream again. Oh my this was so easy and is absolutely delicious. Could only find ultra pasteurized heavy whipping cream but it worked fine. Had to buy a mason jar (Target on sale)  We keep our home cool so I mixed it up, covered with a coffee filter and put it in the oven with the light on for 24 hrs. Mixed it again after 24 hrs  and put the lid on and put it in the fridge and voila .....  yummy masterpiece !! I just wonder how long it will keep .... well, if there's any left lol I used it in Chef Johns Classic Beef Stroganoff and it knocked it out of the park !!!

I used a low fat buttermilk (picked up in error) and  had my doubts it would work but this AM it was nice and thick.  Ready to add grated citrus rind and use as topping for a cake.  Thank you Chef John!

I came across this by accident while looking for something else, and it looked so simple I had to give it a go. I've done it a couple of times now, always turns out great! I like the idea of feeding my family more 'natural' foods rather than store bought bread that never molds, and 'artificially soured' cream, etc. I was a bit freaked out by the idea of leaving cream in a warm place for a couple of days, but really, this is even safer than how sour cream was made decades ago. I also like the idea that it doesn't break when cooking, I plan to try using my current batch in something like that. I've added chipotle powder to it to use as a spicy dip too.

Made this last night to go with the BLT Pasta.  I wasn't sure about leaving it out overnight, but it worked.  I put it in a glass mason jar with a paper towel on top and put the outside cap on the jar to hold the towel on tight.  Tasted great with the BLT Pasta.  I'm going to use it with tacos next.  Thanks, Chef John!

I made this on the last possible "not too hot day" that we'll have for awhile.  It was excellent.  My husband who usually uses yogurt  instead of sour cream is a convert.  Spooned a dollop on some left over posole ... and it was great.  Also great with fresh cut stone fruits.  So thick and creamy   the serving spoon stands up in the bowl.  Think I'll try it with the beef stroganoff when the weather cools down.   Thanks, Chef John.

Mine turns out thick and creamy even using ultra-pasteurized cream. Definitely an upgrade to standard sour cream!

The first time I made this it worked perfectly, since then (am on my third try) I have not gotten it to thicken.

This worked beautifully, and the taste is far superior to store bought. I am making my next batch (right now!) to experiment with sauces and baking. Thanks for sharing!

So happy to have found this recipe!  My local grocery store doesn't carry creme fraiche, but they always have whipping creme.  I made this to go with Chef John's white gazpacho.
