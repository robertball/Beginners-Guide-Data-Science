I have fresh asparagus in my garden right now and used it instead of can. I simply boiled it in water until it was soft and mushy like canned and then went from there. This turned out pretty good but it could have used more seasoning. Next time I make it I will season the breadcrumbs. If using fresh asparagus as I did, you will need to salt the sauce some to make up for the salt you would have gotten with the canned asparagus. Overall good recipe and one with a pretty presentation.
