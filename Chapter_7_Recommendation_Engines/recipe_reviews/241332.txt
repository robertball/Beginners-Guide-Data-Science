I've made this 3 times. It's  a great tastey meal. I've made it with bacon when I didn't have ham. Wasn't quite as good but it work and was good.

This is really delicious! I was dubious at first of the Zesty Italian dressing, but it is actually a perfect complement to the flavors of the onions, peppers, cheese, etc. I used an iron skillet, but you could probably do this with a regular casserole dish as well. It's super-easy, and I will definitely be making this again. We devoured every last bite of it!

Maybe it was the texture of the potatoes, but I really didn't like it.
