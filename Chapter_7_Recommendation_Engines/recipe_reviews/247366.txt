I made this last night for my father-in-law’s birthday.  He requested BBQ shrimp, and I wasn’t about to get the grill out here in the Northeast, haha.  This recipe not only perfectly fit the bill, but went above and beyond.  The shrimp was meant as a compliment to the chicken main course and ended up stealing the show!  Thank you for the recipe!

These were good even though a bit spicy.  Messy to eat. Makes a mess in the pan, but with a little baking soda soak, it cleaned up pretty easily.  Probably won't make again.

I know it's called INDOOR bbq shrimp, but we cooked it on our Big Green Egg.  I tasted the marinade before adding the shrimp, and added a little more ketchup and brown sugar, and a wee bit of Worcestershire sauce.  When husband was finished with his part of the cook, I put the shrimp on our cast iron griddle.  They took just a few minutes on each side.  I think maybe I could have pulled them a minute earlier, but it was my first time grilling shrimp, so I wasn't sure.  ~~ They were really tasty!  Even my husband, who says he only likes battered, deep fried shrimp liked them.  We will try this or a variation again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I used shrimp with the head on and put them on the grill. Messy to peel and eat but, absolutely delicious. I am making a batch of this seasoning to use on a multitude of meats but will withhold the wet ingredients until ready to cook. It's that good!

This was fantastic! I don't care for cayenne so I used chipotle. I was concerned about serving shrimp in the shell but after eating them I didn't care how messy I got! I used Argentine Red Shrimp and the BF went crazy! Pat myself on the back....thank you for a great dinner Chef John!

As a non shrimp fan I really liked this. They were yummy and very easy to make.  I will cut back a bit on the cumin next time as was a bit strong.  Also I only used a dash of heat, my preference.  Definitely watch the marinate time as they started to change at 20 minutes.

Simple and surprisingly tastier than I thought it would be. A nice sweet- heat, I will try using chili sauce instead of ketchup next time. Great recipe on it's own or to experiment with.

I used a SS saute pan and followed the directions. Perfect amount of heat after removing the shells. Plenty of flavor and color got through the shells. I used 16-20 Prawns. Definitely will be using this recipe again for spicey, moist, colorful and flavorful prawns. Easy to eat these moderately hot spiced moist prawn...no fuss, NO MESS.

This was very good and easy to do.  I added strip of Bacon, put on skewers and cook on grill outside.  Was good weather so no reason to cook inside. I will make again.

Nice flavorful shrimp, albeit a little messy, but who cares!  Served with fresh Jersey corn on the cob, very tasty.  Will definitely have this again.
