This was excellent. I used green cabbage and an unpeeled Fuji apple instead. I also added a little sugar and 1/4 cup mayo. Best Slaw I've ever had!

I'm not a coleslaw fan, but I tasted this and thougt it was pretty good.  My family requested this a second time.  A change from the traditional cabbage cole slaw.  Note: I used half sour crea, and half light mayonnaise since I didn't have plain yogurt.  Obviously it turned out great.  A good, sweet (but not by any means overly sweet)recipe.

This is a great way to eat red cabbage.  The yogurt dressing is the key.  I used nonfat yogurt and sour cream and it's still delicious.  I could hardly stop eating it!

I liked the variety of flavors and textures in this recipe. I thought the dressing would be too bland, but it just enhanced the flavors of the ingredients.  I didn't have Granny Smith apples so I used Fuji, and it tasted good.  The next day the dressing seemed to break down a little, but I added some walnuts and it perked it up a bit.  My 13 yo liked it, my 7 yo didn't.  I'd make it again

Yummy!  I like the yogurt/sour cream dressing so much better than regular mayonnaise slaws - so light, fresh, tangy and crisp! Perfect complement to my boston baked beans and brown bread.

This was very tasty. I've added celery seed to make it a nice "summery" flavor.  I let it sit more than 45 minutes and the slaw produced a lot of excess liquid.

I did not like this at all.  The yogurt gave the dressing a bitter aftertaste.  I doctored it up with some celery seed, a bit more sugar, and a good spoonful of Miracle Whip.  It was just okay, but I wouldn't make it again.  It's a lot of work to chop all the cabbage for "just okay".

We thought this was extremely bland.  After mixing and tasting, I added about a tbsp of Miracle Whip, and that didn't help either.  IMO there's too much parsley and it's a dish you can't make earlier in the day because it gets very runny.  Perhaps using greek yogurt or draining regular yogurt overnight on paper towels over a strainer would alleviate the runniness.  Otherwise, make what you plan to eat because I don't think this will be suitable to serve the next day.  Sorry, this was a disappointment and didn't work for us.

Made it without onions and parsley (for my finicky crew) and it came off great-- like a sweet fruit salad.

The dressing was tasty with the cabbage and apples, but I think there was too much parsley.  It was a pretty side though and presents well.

Delicious!  I messed with it quite a bit because I thought I had yogurt, but didn't. Anyway, instead of yogurt & sour cream, I used mayo for the same quantity of both & instead of minced onions, I used 3 large shallots (just the white part).  I added raisins & mandarin orange pieces because I saw that combination in another coleslaw and it turned out absolutely great!  No salt or pepper required. I gave this recipe a 5 because it's very flexible! I intend to use the yogurt & sour cream next time just because it sounds so good.

Rocked! Served with an oven baked flounder and broccoli.  Only change was when we just could not discern the sweetness of the honey.  I added one packet of Splenda, and that did it.  Also, for color pop I sprinkled it with some black sesame seeds.  Thanks SO much - deceptively simple, and we will definitely be making this again!

Love it!  The honey gave just a bit of sweetness.  It's crunchy and cool and is a great compliment side dish.  Simple and easy to make and holds well for a few days.

I used non-fat greek style yogurt and didn't have the liquid problems other cooks seemed to have. It was okay to eat the next day. Needs a bit more pepper and honey to really bring out the contrasting flavours. Nice dish.

I don't know what went wrong but this was NOT good. My daughter loves anything with cabbage and even after I tried to improve it, my daughter literally spit it out and refused to eat it.

This was a great basic recipe. I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the plain yogurt and added extra Apple.

Not bad, felt it was missing something so I added raisins. That did the trick!
