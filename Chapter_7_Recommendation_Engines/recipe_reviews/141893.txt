This dish is delicious!  I made it almost exactly as written, except I used onion powder (my kids have a texture problem with onions) and I left out the celery seed because I didn't have any on hand.  I left it in my slow cooker for about 6 hours, although I'm sure it was edible before that.  My only criticism would be - this recipe needs a different name.  I was not sure what it was until I read the comment comparing it to Manwich - then I knew to serve it on buns.

This is excellent and easy! I love meals that are large enough to feed all four of my kids plus my husband and I and still have leftovers. Meals that all of my kids like are few and far between, but this is one of them. Very tasty and easy!

I would give this a much higher rating were it not for the artificial sweetener that someone added to the recipe.  Splenda is not a stable sweetener at all.  Depending on what else is in the recipe it can go from exceedingly sweet to bitter.  Lose the Splenda and go for 1/2 cup brown sugar instead. Decrease the catsup to 1 cup and be sure and use lean ground beef.  A very good basic recipe with those changes.

Ok, I followed this as written aside from the celery seed and splenda because I had none.  I hate to give something a bad rating but it really didn't taste good at all!  The vinegar taste was so strong it burned my mouth...and the mustard was overpowering.  I used honey instead of splenda...and way less than called for because ketchup has plenty of sugar already.  I definitely would not try this again.  Not even a variation of it.  I'll go back to "winging it" when I do a homemade version of manwich....which has turned out better than this one.  Sorry.

A good recipe but I din't put as much ketchup as it says, instead I add 1/2 cup of tomato sauce. My family liked it but thought the flavour was a bit too strong!

I did not make this to be served on buns, but as a topping for hot dogs. It was adequate for our purposes (though still not exactly what I'm looking for), but on a bun these would be way too tangy for our taste with all that vinegar and mustard. I much prefer Allrecipes' Sloppy Joes II recipe for a loose meat sandwich. Much better balance of flavors used with very similar ingredients.

I thought these are great! I did leave out the Slpenda, thinking that ketchup is so sweet anyhow. Worked great! I also made small homemade rolls...great for football games! I made this for my neighbors, both diabetic, but we both agree this recipe needs more Oomph.....maybe more garlic or some hot sauce. But this is a great recipe!

Love this recipe it's super easy and my family loves it. I like adding chopped green pepper (from my garden) to the ground beef and onion and I only use 1/2 the sugar cause ketchup has sugar in it already and my family doesn't like stuff that is too sweet. I also added some garlic pwder to this (wish I had some actual garlic but ran out, lol).

Added an envelope of onion soup mix, Hy's seasoning salt and extra spices (parsley, basil, curry, paprika). Used half Stevia and half white sugar. Turned out wonderful!

I thought this was delicious. I didn't think I was a fan of sloppy joe's until this recipe. I could eat it once a week I think!

I had some ground meat and was undecided what to make for dinner. I browsed a few recipes and found this one. I tweaked it a little by adding half a Tbsp of brown sugar & 3  cloves of minced garlic , left out the vinegar & celery salt. It was wonderful!!! My boyfriend loved it. Will be making this one again. Thanks for the recipe.

Our family really liked it. I used apple cider vinegar instead to give it a more sweet vinegar taste. I used sugar instead of Splenda. I also added some fresh garlic.
