So I learned to make something similar, but easier. 
Brew your regular coffee with the spices. You can use anything you like. My standard is cinnimon, all spice, nutmeg, ginger, and crushed red pepper for heat. Just put in with grounds and brew. Very nice!
Gentleman that i learned this from used fresh giner and a bit of fresh chopped jalopino pepper in the grounds, along with chocolate( I would put it in after brewed thou)

I took the top reviewer's suggestion and added the spices (adding a sprinkling of nutmeg as well) to my coffee basket with my coffee grounds. I brewed half a pot of coffee. The smell of this brewing is amazing--almost like combining chai and coffee. I did use Truvia to sweeten the drink instead of granulated sugar. Not bad. Next time, I would skip the nonfat milk powder and sweetener and use fat free vanilla creamer. Nice twist on your everyday cup of coffee.

Great ideas.  Like the previous reviewer I add the spices to the ground coffee prior to brewing. Cinnamon has been a favorite coffee ingredient for years, however, this morning I added a twist of freshly ground nutmeg. Nice touch. 
I use an immersion blender to whip a cup of skim milk with sweetener and vanilla. A dollop on top of my coffee and I'm happy.

I liked it a lot! Tastes like a great mix between Chai Tea and coffee. I did have some substitutes; ground cumin for cumin seeds, all spice for anise, and french vanilla creamer for dry milk. Also I used already brewed coffee then warmed it up and added the ingredients, still turned out yummy!

This "Hot Coffee Masala" has a wonderful aroma. I made mine with regular coffee by adding the spices to my French-press coffee maker. I agree that it would be a good "comfort drink" for a person who was feeling "under the weather." Thank you Shuk22 for sharing your recipe.
