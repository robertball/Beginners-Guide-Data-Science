This is really great. My family loved it. I used 2% milk because I can't bear to open a can of evaporated milk and waste what's left, it was still great and the liquid to sugar ratio made a perfect spreading consistency. Thanks for sharing.

I have never tried to make a chocolate frosting before, and thought this was simple and absolutely delicious for my first go at chocolate frosting.  It was much MUCH better than pre-made frostings.  I read one review that this frosting was not chocolate'y enough, and if anything I found it to be more than enough of a chocolate'y taste.  I took the advice of others that said that this did not make very much frosting, and doubled the recipe, which made enough to generously frost a 9" X 13" pan of walnut brownies.  YUM!!  I will certainly make this again.

A buttercream frosting babe at heart, I used this as a sub for birthday cupcakes that had to travel by car for ahwile and they were met with rave reviews by both adults and kids alike.
Easy to make, not too sweet, and  Iwas able to use a pastry bag to pipe it on the cupcakes without too much mess.

EXcellent! I wanted frosting for brownies so I wanted something fudgy and glossy.  That was easily accomplished with this recipe simply by melting the butter. Before it even made it to the brownies I gave it a taste test (yup, with the tip of my finger I confess) and I knew it was exactly what I wanted. I didn't see the necessity for the evaporated milk - I preferred to use half and half.  I used this to top "Simply Fudgy Brownies" (that recipe is pretty darn good too), frosting them while they were still warm.  This frosting will make its way back to my kitchen again, I'm sure!

Great frosting! It's definitely creamy and most certainly chocolately! I replaced half the butter with butter flavored shortening, added a pinch of salt, and used 3 Tbsp. of half and half instead of evaporated milk. I used an electric mixer to get it nice and fluffy. It was perfect to pipe on a half dozen Texas sized dark chocolate cupcakes! The best part was licking the beater!

My family loved this frosting.  It was a bit soft even with all of the sugar, I added a little more.  The taste is phenomenal, this frosting could be desert all by itself!  Very easy to make; I doubled the recipe to fill and frost one two layer cake, there were even leftovers.

I too used cocoa to thicken rather than powdered sugar - what a great idea!  This frosting was wonderful and was enough to frost a one layer 9x13.

I tried this recipe, followed it perfectly and yet it turned out horrible. I made it for a cake for my boyfriend when he got a new job he really wanted, and we couldn't even eat it. I'm very disappointed that I wasted those ingredients. I won't be using this again.

This recipe worked really well - I made 1 1/2 it so it would fill and frost a 9 inch layer cake, and it was just enough.  I used unsalted butter, and it tasted a little bland - I think either salted butter or a dash of salt would have been better.  Chocolate always seems to need a bit of salt.

Oh my gosh! This frosting is so good! I am not usually a big frosting or icing fan because usually they are too sweet for me. I used Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder. This is to die for! I couldn't stop eating it! I served it on top of chocolate zucchini cupcakes from this site and they were a big hit. I will definitely be making this again!!

This is a good recipe for chocolate frosting.  The thing I liked most is that it is sweet, but not sickeningly sweet.  I love chocolate, so I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa.   I added more evaporated milk though than it called for because I like frosting to be more like whipped frosting and very light.  I didn't measure how much, just added a splash until I got it to the consistency I personally like best.   I used this with a the David's Yellow Cake recipe on this site and got great reviews of both the cake and this frosting!  This is going into my 'must make again' recipe book. Oh, and if you are only frosting the top of a 9x13" cake, you only need to make one batch of this frosting.   If you are doing layers, then I'd suggest doubling it up since you would need to frost the outside and the middle of the cake.

This is by far the best chocolate frosting I have ever made.  It has great color and tastes so much better than tub frosting.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This is wonderful frosting.  I doubled the recipe and it was just the right amount to frost 24 cupcakes.  Also, by doubling the recipe, it was almost exactly 1 (5 oz.) can of evap. milk, so none went to waste.  The frosting is creamy, chocolaty and not too sweet, perfect for piping.

This is the best frosting recipe ever, except I used heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk because I didn't have any. It is light, fluffy and so good I thought I had died and went to heaven. If you rate this is a bad recipe then YOU probably did something wrong... Also make sure your butter is room temperature! Definitely use a hand or a stand mixer cause I don't see this working too good without one.

Great for a quick chocolate frosting. I used 2% milk instead of evaporated because I didn't want to waste it. Came out very shiny. Good flavor though. I used it to frost the German Sweet Chocolate Cake I, and it was a good combo. Not quite enough for a good thickness on the side plus decoration though, I really had to stretch it. I'll double it next time :)  Update: I made this again, doubled it, and used the evaporated milk and it was MUCH better!!!! It wasn't as shiny and weird as the first time and I used it on the German chocolate cake again. I liked it better this time, be careful not to add too much evaporated milk though or it will get runny quick!

*I followed this recipe exactly as it is written. This is a good chocolate frosting recipe...and I have made some bad ones!  
*I used it to decorate a box chocolate cake mix.
The flavor is just right...milk chocolaty...this is not dark and rich if that's what you're looking for.
*The consistency is similar to a store bought frosting. I used a bag and tip to give a decorated edge to the cake and it holds up pretty well.
*Inexpensive ingredient list..
and quick and easy to make.

What to expect: if you follow this recipe to the letter, you will get an awesome, very delicious chocolate frosting recipe, resembling that old timey frosting you had on birthday cake of yesteryear.  It will impress, and let's be honest that is what you secretly hope when baking for others.  However, it is not a stiff recipe for complicated decorating, so you will need to adjust this with shortening instead of butter for that, but it will let you pipe some swirls, if that's all you need.  I did add a little extra cocoa and a tad more sugar to slightly firm it, but a double recipe generously frosted a two layer 9 in. cake and had enough left for another layer.  It will set up if you frost the cake and fridge it.  I used this to frost "David's Yellow Cake" recipe on this site.  I would give 5 stars, but just deducted a little since it is not a firmer frosting and since you need to double the recipe to make enough for regular use.  Yowsers, this is a very tasty recipe and will be a staple in my baking.

I love to bake, but do not make cakes or icing from scratch.  Well, I was in a pinch for icing my yellow cake (from a box of course) and tried this recipe.  Wonderful!  I might even stop buying frosting in a can!

This frosting was just what I was looking for! I quadrupled the recipe and it frosted and filled a 1/4 sheetcake, with some left over.  Used it with a dark chocolate cake and also used cherry pie filling along with the frosting filling.  Great creamy texture that was not dry or greasy as homemade chocolate frosting can be.  Easy to decorate with such as borders.  Thanks!

Perfection! This recipe came highly recommended and I was not disappointed! I was looking for a mocha java type flavor, so I added a couple of pinches of espresso powder, very subtle but it was a lovely flavor.

Only comment is that the amount you get is skimpy. Definitely increase if you like a lot of frosting. I'll probably double next time for a layer cake. May have some left over but that's easy to take care of!

So yummy!  I followed this recipe exactly...except for one thing.  I couldn't bring myself to buy a 2 cup container of evaporated milk to only use 5 Tbsp so I made my own by reducing a little bit of milk.  I added the milk while it was still hot which I was worried would affect the consistency but it didn't.  It came out rich and delicious.  This will definitely be my go to recipe whenever I need chocolate frosting.  YUMMY!!

Wow... This was my first time making frosting and because of this recipe, I will never stop now! The texture was PERFECT! I didn't use just any cocoa powder.. I used GHIRADELLI! I can't believe I made this - it tasted like a Professional Bakery Frosting! Thanks for the recipe :)

This was a great recipe. Held up well for a groom's cake that I made. Had to triple it for  a two tier groom's cake (tier sizes 9 inches and 12 inches x 3 inches high for each tier) Only gave 4 stars  because for me it was a tad too sweet so I added a dash of salt ( small small dash) but it held up well even in 100+ degree weather... it started to slightly melt but not like a candy bar, more frosting is expected to melt in that type of heat. Thanks ! I will most def use again... Oh and do use all of the sugar required, it wasn't thick and fluffy until I did...

This is absolutely fantastic frosting and I'll most definitely use it again and again. Thank you! I followed the recipe to the letter, except I used regular milk instead of evaporated, only b/c I didn't have evaporated to hand. In the future I'd like to try adding additional flavours - maybe cinnamon instead of vanilla, or coffee. Thanks again! Update: I’ve made this several tones and have even been short on powdered sugar. It’s very forgiving; I’ve just added a little more milk and cocoa powder to compensate and it worked a treat!

The chocolate flavor was okay. I do not like dark chocolate flavor, so I melted 1.5 oz of milk chocolate with 1/2 tsp of butter. I mixed this into the frosting and viola, yummy chocolate frosting. I didn't want to add more sugar and this work out perfectly. Yummy!!!

Great texture and flavor. I recommend making and using it the day you intend to serve your baked goodie because it was kind of crusty the next day. To frost and fill a double-layer cake and frost 9 cupcakes, I combined 4 1/8 c. sugar, 12 T. cocoa, 9 T. butter, 7.5 T. milk and 1.5 t. vanilla.

Very good frosting!  It's creamy, spreads nicely, isn't overly sweet, and has no "shortening" taste.  Chocolately, but not too rich.  I used it on a 9x12 cake, still in the pan, (only the top was frosted) so I had an ample amount of frosting.  Make sure the butter is softened before creaming, use an electric mixer to get it really creamy, and don't skip the sifting step.  This will be my recipe when I want a frosting that's simple, quick, and yummy!

This is a really easy recipe! It also tasted delicious.:) I used 1.5% milk instead of evaporated, and it turned out great! I also made another batch, and mixed about 1/2cup un-whipped heavy cream, and whipped it all together until VERY fluffy- superb! All of my 6 siblings and my parents loved it!

This recipe is so bad, I can't believe it is highly rated. I read it three times thinking maybe I forgot an ingrediant or something. It tastes like pure sugar with a vague chocolate after taste. It never real pulls together. All 4 family members agreed it doesn't work. I ended up adding 2 extra tbs butter 2, extra tablespoons cocoa and half a container of whipped cream cheese. After all of this, the recipe was quite tasty- but lets be real that's a totally different recipe than what is shown. Don't make this unless you like to eat confectioner's sugar straight.

So yummy! You can't mess this one up! I used 2% milk because I didn't want to waste a whole can of evaporated milk. Frosting was delicious and so easy to make, too!

Can't believe I forgot to rate this.  Made this frosting last month to go over a homemade yellow cake.  It was delish and easy to make.  Oh, I did not want to waste a can of evaporated milk, so I used just regular milk instead.  Thank you for sharing.

Wow!  Thank you for such a fabulous recipe.  Sooo decadent with a true milk chocolate flavor.  I actually used 8Tbs. butter as it was easier to throw the whole softened stick in mixer.  Whirred it all in the Kitchen Aid.  Creamy perfection.  Yum.  Generously covered a 9x13" cake.  My new favorite chocolate frosting recipe-my husband & kids were floored by this & I bake a lot.

This is delicious.  As one reviewer said, it seems a shame to waste the extra evaporated milk.  I made a double batch, and am planning on freezing the half I am not using.  I am freezing the remaining evaporated milk in 5 tablespoon portions.  Then I can hopefully use it later.

Absolutely wonderful. My husband always thinks everything made with cocoa powder tastes too "semi-sweet", but he actually liked this frosting and said it was not "semi-sweet" tasting at all but the perfect sweetness. This will be the frosting I now use for all of my cakes and cupcakes.

I don't know why I expected this recipe to be so-so...IT WAS DELICIOUS! The only changes I made, because I didn't have the evaporated milk, was to add 5-6 tablespoons of milk. I also added 1/8 tsp of salt. The result was a rich and creamy frosting. This is my new favorite frosting!

I changed the serving size to 18 and calculated the ingredients so I would have enough to frost a 2 layer cake and the middle. I did have a little extra. Substituted heavy cream for the evaporated milk because I needed to use it up. Tastes great.

I made mine almost two days ahead of time (had to travel and asssembled cupcakes when I got there); after mixing in a couple tablespoons of milk, it was ready to go.  Stays soft (does not set up hard/dry) and did not get grainy.  YUM!  A nice milk-chocolate taste, not very "fudgy" and not too sweet.

Awesome frosting! Great flavor..better than store bought. I made some slight changes....I used regular milk instead of evaporated and I only used 4 tbsp instead of 6. When I did 6 tbsp the frosting was way too runny. With 4 tbsp of milk, the frosting piped beautifully.

I thought this was pretty good. I did think it needed a stronger chocolate flavor so I added an ounce of melted unsweetened baking chocolate and it helped a little. I used a very high quality cocoa powder but it's a little older so that might have something to do with the chocolate flavor not being very strong.

Very good! I upped the servings to 36 and omitted about 1 cup of the confectioners sugar.  I used almond milk as it is what I had on hand.  I frosted Sandy's Chocolate Cake recipe from this site.  Will definitely make again.

BEST chocolate frosting ever! Love it! So creamy, so rich, so delightful, and YUMMY! The vanilla adds a nice flavor to it!
Tips: Do not try to frost cupcakes or brownies when the frosting has been in the fridge, the frosting will be too stiff and break the cake/brownie. For an easier time frosting let it get to room temp. before frosting.

 Also I have used this recipie before in making cake pops but it make it tastes like a brownie!  Soo good! Best frosting ever! Goes great in cake pops, on yellow cake, and brownies! LOVE IT!

While this was a simple recipe I found that the taste was very disappointing.  You could tell it came from cocoa powder.  It had an almost stale taste to it rather than fresh that real chocolate would have given.

I liked the texture and it was great for piping and decorating (I used it for cupcakes) however the taste was not that impressive and I have definitely had better chocolate frosting in terms of taste. I think that those who had trouble with consistency either had their butter too soft, didn't follow the recipe or didn't measure properly. The consistency is good. I even added more milk to make it even more creamy. I didn't have any problem with it being runny. I'll keep this recipe in my box however I will keep looking for my perfect chocolate frosting.

Thank you!

I'm not a chocolate fan, but my husband is and I needed a nice homemade frosting for his cake (Being a baker; I don't use anything packaged). 

Rather than canned milk I used chocolate rice milk. Amaretto rather than vanilla and I used more cocoa powder to thicken the frosting rather than more Confectioners' sugar.

This is an excellent base recipe!

Oh and I just wanted to say to those who gave a bad review.. You obviously don't know how to bake. Like I always say “There's more to baking then just fallowing a recipe”.

This frosting was wonderful!  I forgot to put the vanilla in :-(. I bet it's even better with the vanilla!  It's still wonderful, though. Great flavor and consistency. There is no reason to buy frosting in the can. I also used whole milk because I didn't have condensed milk.

A perfect frosting recipe.  Like another poster, I used 2% milk and it still turned out perfect.  A new favorite, thank you for sharing!

Nice simple recipe, great for when you don't want to spend a lot of time.  I personally loved it and will make it for the kids again. If you are a chocolate snob, don't make it though.

Oh it was heavenly! Didn't want to open up the evaporated milk so I used my already open heavy whipping cream. It was a buttery-light-chocolately taste.

I used this frosting on "one bowl chocolate cake" from this site, and I won a 2nd place red ribbon at my county fair!  This frosting is AMAZING!  My husband LOVED it!  Will make again and again!  Thanks for sharing Tracy!

well i tried this frotsing and im just not happy with the results.....it was too sweet. I sorta felt the texture was a bit grainy &  too dense. I would have preferred something that is less sweet & wouldnt punch in a buttery flavor.

This was very disappointing.. I made it just the way it says to make it and it turned out very runny, tasted nothing like chocolate had to add more coco to get even a hint of chocolate flavor.. I will not be making this one again.

Ok... To everyone who complained about this being too runny...  You're supposed to add the milk/liquid slowly, and to the consistency of your liking. "5Tbs" doesn't always mean you should use that exact amount.  That said, I thought this was an ok icing. It's not very rich. It sets quickly so be careful about it becoming grainy/crumbly, and to add sprinkles to cupcakes as you go. I was able to BARELY frost 24 cupcakes (not heavily either). I think I'll use a different frosting next time.

This is delicious!!  It was a bit thick for spreading, so I just warmed it in the microwave for 20 seconds.  It was then easily spread & sat up to be just perfect on my white layer cake.

Really good recipe. I also used it to frost a boxed cake like some others have, I had to keep adding the sugar and cocoa powder after the required measurements because I wanted it thicker (frosting has to withstand decorations, like little toy cars, for my son's birthday cake). I will try to post the finished product if it turns out to my liking. 
Overall, a very good standard recipe that can be easily adjusted to one's preference.

Absolutely perfect!  I subbed skim milk only because there was no evaporated milk in my pantry.  This yields a creamy, fluffy, mousse-like frosting.  One batch was enough to conservatively frost 24 cupcakes so if you plan to pipe frosting and be decorative you may want to adjust accordingly.

I doubled the recipe to frost two 8" cakes.  Had plenty of frosting, but didn't have enough powdered sugar on hand for 5-1/2 cups (which a douled recipe would call for) so I used all I had, which measured to about 4 cups.  I thought that the frosting would probably be sweet enough, and I was right.  I was also careful not to add all the evaporated milk because I knew the frosting would end up too thin.  I added a little sour cream (about 1/4 cup) as I was frosting a sour cream chocolate cake.  So after all this, how did the frosting turn out?  Wonderful!  Loved it!  Just the right amount of sweetness, and very true to it's name "creamy".

It was my first time making my own frosting, and I don't think I'll ever go back to canned frosting again!  I used light margarine and fat free evaporated milk, and it still turned out wonderfully.  I used this frosting to pipe onto the ice cream cone cupcakes after some refrigeration.  It set up beautifully!  I experienced the same thing as other reviewers-  it had a very strong powdered sugar taste right after mixing, but the ingredients blended well and it tasted very good after a few hours!

I thought this tasted pretty good but it never got very thick.  I ended up adding a bit more conf. sugar and cocoa, then added 2 more Tbsp. of butter.  It helped but still not quite there.  And I was only able to cover 20 out of 24 cupcakes.

For those of you wondering how many cupcakes this recipe will frost...it will do 12 generously (I piped out swirl designs). I wasn't sure so I made recipe as is and then made a second batch (no need to clean bowls) to finish off my two dozen cupcakes. This frosting is the best I've ever tried.  I used Ghiradella's unsweetened cocoa and the flavor came out so decadent but not too rich or sweet...the perfect balance. I dislike overly sweet buttercream frostings. I added a dash of salt to bring out the chocolate flavor (used unsalted butter though).  Can't wait for everyone to try them.  I put ontop of the cookie dough cupcake (recipe from this site) and I'm sure it'll be a hit.  Thank you Tracy!

This was so good!  I added 1 tsp. of instant espresso as it adds depth of flavor to the chocolate.  I melted the butter and proceeded with the recipe as directed.  It was creamy and glossy, and perfect for my son's birthday cake. This will be my go-to butter cream frosting.  I did double the recipe to frost and fill 2- 8 inch layer cakes.

This is an outstanding chocolate frosting recipe! I made it exactly as written, and was extremely pleased with the results. The frosting was a nice, rich color, and the flavor was sweet, but not too sweet, and chocolatey. I loved the addition of the evaporated milk;it made the frosting extra creamy. I did use double dark Dutch processed cocoa...this gave it a richer chocolate taste. I used the frosting to top Lovestohost's Cookie Dough Cupcakes, and it piped beautifully, and tasted awesome. Thanks for sharing the recipe! I'll be making it again!

Everyone LOVED this frosting. I used vegan butter, and instead of evaporated milk I used non-dairy creamer (made from coconut milk.) Worked perfectly, people had a lot to say about it, some calling it "melt in your mouth" and others "so creamy and good." A keeper.

GREAT frosting!  I used this on the Peanut Butter Cupcakes from this site.  I split the recipe in half as suggested by other reviewers and it was a HUGE mistake!  I was only able to cover twelve cupcakes with the recipe halved.  Perhaps this is because of the way I frost cupcakes-I put the frosting in a gallon size zip top bag and cut one of the bottom tips off (using it as a pastry bag).  Next time I will definitely not half the recipe.    Very delicious!  Thanks for the recipe, Tracy!

Loved this recipe! Easy to make and great tasting. I did not have evaporated milk, so I substituted milk and turned out great. I will be trying with evaporated milk to see if there is a difference.

I followed the recipe, but used a total of 3 cups sugar, and 6 Tbsp evaporated milk. I think regular milk may be a bit too little flavor for it, but as written, it's hands-down the most awesome chocolate frosting I've ever had! I'm going to try this in lemon and vanilla too, just to see what could happen :)

I've only ever made this with ordinary milk because I didn't have any evaporated milk on hand, but it still turns out a winner.  This is my favorite chocolate frosting recipe.  Thanks for sharing it definitely!

Tastes just like the local bakeries frosting! I used it on DS's birthday cake, and just recently on homemade doughnuts and it is yummy! I added a few extra tablespoons of chocolate.

The recipe is on point. The frosting was like canned frosting at the grocery, but more healthier. Less synthetic ingredients, if you get my drift.

This was by hands down the best chocolate frosting recipe I have ever made!!! For the ones that did not give a good review, I'm sorry to say it was because they did not make it correctly. This was so simple, fast and easy. This frosting is so smooth, creamy and fluffy that you'll be able to pipe the frosting if you choose. This frosting is so decadent, that it is very hard to resist eating right from the bowl. When alternating dry ingredient and milk, I simply added 1 cup of dry to 1 Tablespoon of milk and it worked out beautifully - ( which by the way I just used regular milk instead of evaporated milk ). Very important to sift the sugar and Coco, beat butter ( room temperature ) till smooth and gradually add dry ingredient and milk - alternating them.  Follow instructions as directed and you shall have the most delicate chocolate frosting leaving the most grandest smile on your face and ultimately please the ones around you. You'll never buy another can of frosting again. For the people who found this was too sweet, it really is simple...just adjust the amount  of sugar.  If you still find that you didn't  care for this recipe,  be kind in your comment. Just imagine that this was you sharing your recipe with others....you wouldn't want to read mean comments.

P.s. You must use powdered sugar ( others call it confectioners sugar ). If you use regular granulated sugar,  your frosting will have the " gritty " texture. If you still choose to use granulated sugar,  beat together

This is hands down the best frosting ever! My sister in law and my youngest request me to use this frosting for their birthday cakes. If you messed this up, you didn't follow the directions. You cant just throw everything in and mix it, it doesn't come out the same. Follow the directions and I recommend doubling this recipe for one batch of cupcakes or for a full cake. I will never use another chocolate frosting after using this now for the past 2 years. Two thumbs up!!

I hadn't made chocolate frosting before (only vanilla buttercream), but I was tired of using the Betty Crocker's tub version because it always tastes waxy and too sweet with a bitter undertaste.  This looked like the simplest yet high-rated frosting recipe around, and it's very true to what it says.  I followed the recipe exactly, apart from an extra 2 TBSP of butter.  The result was enough to thickly frost a 9" x 13" cake with a little left over, and tasty enough I keep eating the leftover frosting.  It's very good, not the perfect 'fudgy' chocolate, but a richer chocolate.  I'm still looking for a chocolate fudge type recipe, but this will do great on Devil's Food cakes for the time being.

Great, easy recipe with lots of experimentation potential!   I used 1% milk instead of evap milk, and added a little more cocoa powder (because I'm a sucker for dark chocolate)...turned out great, though next time I may cut down on the vanilla extract a tiny bit.

I actually just realized that I used sweetened condensed milk instead of evap milk (duh)... Lol, even still, it was very tasty, but I did have to add milk to thin it out (I'll blame the sweetened cond milk for the thickness). Next time I will try it with the correct ingredients!

This is an excellent quick frosting for cakes, brownies, or cupcakes.  I made it exactly as written except I did add about 1/2 tsp. of salt. For some reason, in my opinion, this seems to cut the bitterness of the cocoa powder and brings out the sweetness instead.  This is so much better than the tub frostings you buy at the grocery store. I used the amounts listed for a 13x9 inch pan of brownies.  I doubled it for a 9" layer cake.  It was wonderful and I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This is good. I was having a little trouble getting it to come out smooth (possibly I didn't sift well enough). I tried at first to beat it by hand and that definitely wasn't working. I dumped it all in my KA stand mixer and really whipped the heck out of it and eventually it became smooth frosting. In the end it tastes pretty good, I'd probably use it again for a not too too sweet chocolate frosting. I had just about enough to frost the top of a 9x13 cake. I'd definitely double the recipe if I were frosting a layer cake.

Perfect for brownies.  Chocolatey and creamy.  Not a lot of frosting if I had been making it for a cake, but perfect for a 9 x 13 pan of brownies or snack cake.

Pretty good. A little too sweet for my taste so I added a pinch of salt also a bit more powder sugar to make a firmer consistency. I used it to fill a 6 in. And 10 in. Round layer cake. I highly doubt that there would be enough to frost an 8 in layer cake unless you just cut a single 8in cake in half. I would definitely double the recipe if you want a normal amount of frosting on your cake.

Great tasting, easy recipe!! Made exactly enough for 1, two layer round cake.  I omitted vanilla extract (didn't have any) and instead used a tsp of instant coffee granules for a richer taste!  Used about 1 more tbsp evaporated milk to get to spreadable consistency.

Not bad at all! It tastes very similar to store bought frosting. As a twist, I subbed half of the cocoa powder for hot chocolate powder and added a bit of instant coffee on my second run of it. It ended up tasting just like an Oreo cookie...lol. Amazing recipe, thanks.

This is my favorite frosting! But needs to be doubled to frost and fill a double layer cake. I found that it tastes much better after a day or even a few days. I thought the first day it was too grainy from the powdered sugar (but still delicious). I left the extras in my fridge for 3 days and when I went back to use the rest I had to let it sit out at room temp to soften. It was a little too warm near the wood stove and  near melted, so I beat it up well at that temp and put it back in the fridge to firm up. It was absolutely perfect after that. All the graininess was gone and it was even more smooth and creamy after that.

Super easy, beautiful texture and very tasty. My daughter instructed me to use this recipe for all my cakes from now on. :)I frosted a 9x13 cake (in the pan) and a 8x8 both with a thin, but completely adequate, top layer (no frosting to spare though). I would definitely double if I were doing a layer cake. Also, I used regular 1% milk instead of evaporated milk.

It was easy.  It was "ok"..but I made a few changes that made it much better, easy tweaks.  I made it as written, but it wasn't very chocolaty, and it was wayyyy tooo sweet. I ended up melting 1 more tbsp of butter and warmed half a box of reg cream cheese and blended them together until smooth.  I added it to the icing from the original recipe.  It was a little thinner and a little less sweet.  Still to sweet, so I started adding more tbsp's of cocoa (i used hershey brand)..Ended up with about 4 more tbsp of cocoa, maybe 5.   I didnt really measure, just poured a little in and tasted and watched consistency.  Finally i had a good icing.  I iced my cake, and the icing was still ok, but much better then before.  THE NEXT DAY THE ICING WAS WONDERFUL.  No one cut the cake, and we left it out to air over night by accident and the icing took on a whole nother dimension.  My husband (it was his birthday cake) said it was the best cake he'd ever eaten.  KEEPER...will never buy frosting again!

This is my go-to chocolate frosting recipe. It's easy and taste far better than anything store-bought. I use a few modifications and it always turns out perfectly! I add an extra 2 tbsp. of butter, 2 tbsp. of cocoa powder and 1 tbsp of evaporated milk. To me, this makes the recipe more chocolately & rich. Otherwise, it can be a bit too sugary! Also, I let it sit overnight in the frige. I think this enhances the flavor. However, it's still pretty no-fail!

This is so good! It whipped up nicely, I did add 1 more Tbsp. of evaporated milk and about 1/2 Tbsp more cocoa. We frosted cupcakes and I've stored the leftover frosting the fridge to use later, I hope it holds up. It is too good to throw away.

I just made this and it is so good, smooth, creamy and so very simple.  I did add a splash of vanilla, just personal preference and used regular milk as I did not have canned milk.  I creamed the butter and milk together then added sugar and cocoa powder.  One reviewer said she followed the recipe exactly and it did not turn out....I do not know how that could happen, this is just so easy.  I made extra and stored in fridge to use on graham crackers at a later date.

Loved this. Will definitely use again in the future when I need frosting.  Would be great on cupcakes! A good stiff frosting, that reminds me of milk chocolate but is not insanely sweet.  I used it for the border of a German Chocolate cake and it held up very well :)

I love this frosting!!!! Crazy as it sounds, I didn't have evaporated milk.  The only thing I had close to that consistency was Caramel-Vanilla Creamer.  It was crazy good!!!!! I tried to make it again, the right way, but my family wouldn't let me :)

It was easy to make and tasted great! In fact, it tasted even better than the cake :-). The only change I made was to substitute half of the butter with shortening, because the frosting on the cake had to withstand the hot Malaysian weather (not going to be in an air-conditioned room).

This frosting is perfectly sweet and chocolatey. I used 2% milk instead of evaporate milk. You definitely need to keep whipping it to make it nice and fluffy but when it gets there it is amazing. My brother hates most frosting besides whipped cream and he loved this one.

Two thumbs up!!!!  This is the best chocolate frosting ever!!  I did thicken (with more cocoa power and sugar) it a bit more than the recipe called for b/c I was using it to decorate cupcakes with a decorating bag and tip. I always can work easier with thicker icing when it comes to decorating. I will defiantly use this recipe again.

I thought this was good. I realized after I made it that I completely forgot the butter. I don't know what difference it made but I thought it was good. I figured since I didn't miss it, why use it? I just added a little more milk (I used skim). Only a few drops at a time.

The frosting was easy to make and tasted even better.  I will not be using store bought frosting anytime in the near future.  I doubled the recipe but I had a lot left over, so next I will not adjust the recipe unless I have other items that will need the chocolate frosting.

The frosting turned out excellent but had to do a lot of ajusting along the way. It was to thick and sweet as written (for my taste) so I added extra butter and cream till i had the texture and taste I liked. about 2 tbls extra butter, 2 tbsp extra evap milk and some heavy cream till I got the consistancy that I liked. Once I did....I loved this frosting! Will use this recipe again.

Frosting was very easy to make and quite good.  I found that I needed to add almost twice the amount of milk to make it easier to pipe.

So easy.  It makes enough if you're making a 13X9 flat cake but you will probably need more if you're doing the round stacked kind.

I made this chocolate frosting yesterday for a layer cake and it was delicious! I made 18 servings to fill and frost an 8 inch square layer cake with 1 layer of filling. It just barely made it and I typically do not use a lot of frosting. I would probably suggest 20 servings to fill and frost a 8-9 inch layer cake with 1 layer of filling. Getting back to the frosting, my sifter somehow got wet and it didn't work. I needed the frosting quickly, so I could not wait for the sifter to dry. I ended up not sifting the ingredients and it still tasted delicious! I cut down the sugar by 1/4 cup and added a couple of extra tablespoons of cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey and less sugary. The taste was perfect, as well as the creamy consistency! Might I add that it was also extremely easy to make! I will never use boxed frosting again!

I am a huge fan of frosting...it's the best part of the cupcake in my opinion, and this was awesome!! I made birthday cupcakes for my little brother, Dirt and Worm style (since hist birthday is in October :)  ) I just crumbled oreos and dumped them on top of the fresh frosting, and topped it with a gummy worm.  They were super cute and very delicious :)

Very good basic chocolate frosting recipe. Love the simple ingredients! It did need quite a bit more powdered sugar and evaporated milk than the recipe called for. I didn't think it was quite enough frosting either, but it turned out to completely frost the 9inch two layer cake. The frosting dried really quick, so I'll have to go back with another round of frosting (probably a vanilla), to decorate it and make it look a little better.

I followed this recipe to the tee and it turned out 'ok'.  The kids weren't thrilled with it and said it tasted like there was too much cocoa.  I followed the recipe and put 6 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa, but next time I think I'll only put 5 and maybe a little more sugar to sweeten it up a bit.

This is, without a doubt, the best chocolate frosting I have ever tasted.  I did not have evaporated milk and used regular milk and it was still yummy.  If there were ten stars, that is what I would rate this recipe.  Thank you, Tracy for sharing this.  It is a keeper for me.

FINALLY!  A good chocolate frosting recipe that is tasty and easy to put together.  I doubled for 24 cupcakes and had about 2 cups left over.  Since I used a tip and a bag for the frosting, it took more than normal so I wanted plenty.  Everybody liked it - my new go to recipe for chocolate frosting!

Tasty and a great consistency. Added a bit more cocoa to suite our tastes which came out thick and rich. Like some others I used normal milk because I didn't have any evaporated milk and had no troubles.

This is the perfect chocolate icing recipe. I followed it exactly except that I used 2% milk in place of the evaporated, and ran out of cocoa so used a few tablespoons less than called for. One and a half times the ingredients made enough to fill and frost a nine inch two layer cake generously.

This frosting is AMAZING!! It's soooo chocolaty and super easy. I was low on ingredients and wanted a good dessert, so I made this frosting and used it to frost the Wacky Cake recipe on this site. I was surprised by how decadent it turned out! This is now my go-to chocolate frosting. Also, I used regular whole milk and just added a tbsp at a time until it reached the consistency I wanted. It was still awesome.

I used regular whole milk and it was delicious.  Definitely will make again.  I had made "David's Yellow Cake" in a 9x13 pan and was able to frost the entire cake (with some left over).

This IS a creamy chocolate frosting.  I used it to frost just the top of two 8" x 8" one layer cakes.  I followed the recipe exactly but IF I make again, I will double the recipe as the amount was not enough to make a nice thick layer of frosting. :(

DON'T MAKE THIS.  It's incredibly delicious and impossible to save for cupcakes.  You'll lick the bowl.  You'll lick the spoon.  You'll lick the cupcakes and have to make more.

TIP:  put the leftover frosting in the fridge and let it harden.  Makes delicious fudge. :)

Excellent and simple. It held up well and I was pleased with the taste. I think I may add hazelnut flavor next time. I used 2% milk...I will definitely try evaporated milk, but didn't have any on hand.

I will NEVER buy tubbed frosting again!  My 9 year old and I made this to frost some yellow cupcakes we made on the spur of the moment.  Everyone that has tasted them have raved about the frosting.  We doubled the recipe and it was enough to pipe frosting on 24 cupcakes just like the picture.  It was very easy to make (though we did make a mess of the sugar blend with the stand mixer) and tastes amazing.  I'd give it six stars if I could.

This frosting is the best chocolate frosting I have made. It definitely beats frosting out of a can. The taste and texture are perfect. One important thing to know is that this recipe does not make very much frosting. I frosted a 9x13 cake and it was not enough, so I can't imagine it covering a 9 in. layer cake. It definitely needs to be doubled.

Sifting the sugar and cocoa was definitely a plus and using the evaporated milk.  The frosting is so smooth and creamy.  Not to mention, it tastes great.  If you want to ice a layer cake, you will need a recipe and a half.

I am generally one of those individuals who was always hesitant to make homemade frosting and just went for the premade tubs at the store, but after trying this recipe I won't be doing that anymore!  This is an absolutely fantastic recipe for chocolate frosting.  Very easy to make with great flavor and consistency and not overly sweet. Since the recipe allows you to adjust the consistency to your preference it's great for piping decorations as well.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect, the only change I made was that I doubled the recipe to ensure I had enough to frost the cake and pipe on decoration.   Thanks for sharing this one!

Made this frosting to go on top of cookie dough cupcakes from this site. Very easy to make. I also used skim milk instead of evaporated milk. I followed the recipe for 12 servings and I had more than enough to frost 24 cupcakes. Great chocolate frosting, and not to sweet.

I love this recipe.  I have made it 3 times this month. This first time I made exactly by the recipe but it was a light frosting.  I then added an extra tablespoon of cocoa power to the recipe and it was perfect for my familys taste.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very quick and easy but I did not like the flavor. It just tasted like powdered sugar to me. I even added some melted chocolate to enhance the flavor. My husband liked it on the cupcakes I made for his birthday.

This was so EASY. Turned out perfect. Not to thick and not to thin. I did use reg milk and whipped it for about 5 minutes in my stand mixer. It turned out so fluffy and yummy! This is the only chocolate frosting I will use from now on.

I had high hopes for this frosting after reading all the great reviews, but it just didn't have enough flavor for us. I would have enjoyed a true buttercream flavor, but this one isn't it. It was more just sweet, and not even close to chocolate enough.  On the plus side, it is super easy to make, and the texture was perfect. I did follow the ingredients exactly.

I thought this was very good, and easy. I doubled the batch to frost an ice cream cake from here. When you double it, you can use a small [5oz.] can of evaporated milk. No waste. Thanks for a very good frosting.

I have made this several times, several different ways, and gotten rave reviews.  The original recipe as-is is very sweet and rich.  It is time consuming to sift the sugar/cocoa mixture, but well worth it if you have the time.  Also, be sure to fully whip the butter before adding the sugar/cocoa mixture, and then mix until smooth in order to get a creamy frosting that isn't 'grainy'.  I have also made this recipe with about half the butter and without sifting the sugar/cocoa, and with 2% milk rather than the evaporated milk.  It was still very good and I don't think the taste suffered at all.   With either recipe, you may have to add a little more of the milk (in small increments) to reach the right consistency. Next time I am going to try using coffee in place of milk for a mocha flavor.  This is a recipe you can do a lot with and you can't go wrong!

First time making frosting. This looked fantastic and tasted great. Highly reccomend! No more need for store-bought!  Not a great chef here, just joined this site! This is my first review. Maybe next time I will make the brownies from scratch too. :)

Delish. Used Hershey's Unsweetened Cocoa Powder. I doubled the dry ingredients & butter and alternated adding 1/3 cup of the cocoa/sugar mixture and 1T of the evaporated milk at a time to my mixer. I lost count of how many tablespoons of evaporated milk I used-- I just kept going until it was the consistency I wanted. I also added 1 tsp of salt-- I think this was key to the slightly bittersweet taste of the frosting which was great. This frosting was perfect for piping; doubling the recipe, I was able to frost 47 cupcakes and still have more leftover. My new favorite chocolate frosting recipe!

I used 2% milk instead of evaporated milk, I'm assuming that's why I had to put A LOT more powdered sugar in order for the frosting to be thick enough to pipe onto cupcakes. It did turn out well, I thought it tasted just like a homemade version of store bought frosting. I'm only giving 4 stars because I thought it was good for how easy it was, but not amazing.

I made this to top the chocolate cupcakes my son and i made this morning. You can keep the cupcake, I'll just take a bowl of frosting! It is incredibly creamy and smooth. Just the right amount of chocolate-y goodness. The only change I made was to sub skim milk for the evaporated milk. If you're looking for a creamy chocolate frosting, your search has ended. Here it is!!! :)

If you're accustomed to the old hershey's recipe from the back of the can (what I grew up on) you'll probably find this to be a similar, slightly better version.  I've kept mine in the fridge (keeping milk out at room temp makes me kind of nervous) and I have found it to stay nice and soft.  I don't have a problem with it being crunchy, like some reviewers have.  I think that comes from having too much sugar.  The proportions in this recipe seemed to be just right and one batch was a perfect amount to frost the top of a 9x13.  I paired it with "One Bowl Chocolate Cake II" and I think it makes a great "every day" treat to get the family gathered around the table.

This is a great frosting! I wanted something less "stiff", so I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar. I'm sure it is just as good with the full amount of sugar.

Delectable! Absolutely wonderful flavor as well as mixing up to just the right consistancy to pipe onto cupcakes! As per other reviews - it doesn't make much frosting at all. Even to frost 24 cupcakes, I needed more than one batch. In future, I am always going to double the recipe and go from there.

By far the best chocolate frosting!!! I followed the recipe besides the evap. milk.  I used whatever milk I had which was whole.  It turned out GREAT!!!! This recipe is the best chocolate frosting that I have ever had.  Just try it once and you will see.  You won't need to add anything else I promise.

Not only was this super easy to make but it called for typical pantry staples. Also,it had a great color (almost looks like german chocolate), consistancy (smooth and held together nice) and flavor(not too sweet). I added in almond extract instead of vanilla and made it a 'chocolate almond' flavor.  I used 2% milk instead of the evaporated as another user had suggested.  It made more than enough to frost a single layer 9 inch cake, but for anything bigger I would double the batch. I will use this recipe over and over again, I am sure of it!

What a lovely frosting... I used it to frost some cupcakes (Chocolate Oil Cake recipe)... the contrast of depth of chocolate was amazing.  This frosting is beautifully buttery with a smooth chocolate flavor- like milk chocolate, where the cupcakes are more dark-- Easy to work with, though a bit soft- that was my fault because I couldn't find any more powdered sugar.  Great recipe!

This was an okay frosting, I really prefer a thicker buttercream consistency, but it's a decent recipe in a pinch.  I would make absolutely sure you sift the cocoa because otherwise you can end up with lumps of cocoa in the otherwise smooth frosting.

My most favorite frosting recipe I have found here, and I've tried alot. Perfect measurements!
PS I made peanut butter cupcakes and used this frosting, when I was beating the butter I added a big scoop of peanut butter. I got a TON of compliments!

I used this for Homemade Chocolate Sandwich Cookies (recipe found on this website).  Since I used yellow cake mix, I wanted the icing between the cookies to be chocolate.  What I love about this is that you can make it thin or thick, or you can omit the chocolate and add some more vanilla for vanilla icing.  I didn't have the evaporated milk on hand, so I followed the suggestion of several other reviewers and used the milk I had on hand, which was whole milk.  It turned out fantastic.

wow! this frosting saved my cupcakes! I originally put cream cheese frosting one my cupcakes, but it was so rich and heavy, it just didn't seem appropriate for a cupcake. So I used this recipe and whipped it up for a couple minutes in my KA. I also added 1 extra tablespoon of evap. milk. it is so tasty!!

I've been looking for just this type of frosting for a simple yellow cake.  This one mixes up fluffy, chocolatey, but not too sweet.  I agree with another reviewer about opening a can of evaporated milk for such a small amount and I actually used skim milk.  This probably makes it a little less dense, but saves a few calories and I loved the fluffiness.  I will probably use this one frequently.  Thanks!

Quick and easy!!! Tastes great as well. I made this twice and the first time wasn't that great. It was way to runny and tasted like chocolate powder. The second time I made this I melted 2 1ounce squares of baking chocolate and mixed it in after I creamed the sugar and butter. then I only used 1 TBLSP of the evaporated milk. Turned out great and I was able to pipe it out onto mini cupcakes pretty easily. The shape stayed set pretty well after the cupcakes set out for about 30 minutes. I will definately make this again.

My husband and I LOVED this frosting! It's thick, rich, and every chocolate lover's dream. Just devine! I  recommend doubling the recipe if you like a lot of frosting like we do. Plus, this  doesn't spread the best (could have been that I didn't add enough evaporated milk) but it's SO good that it's worth piling on a little extra on the cake to cover every inch. You will NOT be disappointed. Easy and delicious! Thanks!

Good and different than other recipes.  Easy to make.  I used just about 2 batches to frost a layer cake, needed most of it.  Good, but not the best yet.

I loved this!  I like my frosting dark, so I did increase the cocoa powder to 1 full cup.  It was so creamy and delicious!

Made this following directions precisely and was left with a runny disaster.  I would have added more powdered sugar but it was already too sweet.  Into the garbage.

Like a lot of other posters, this is the first time I've made cake frosting from scratch, and I was very happy with this recipe.  The only thing I would say is next time I make it, I'm going to try using less vanilla.  I thought the vanilla taste was a bit strong.  FYI, this frosting stays soft and creamy unless you refrigerate it.

i used milk instead of evaporated and it worked out fine. adding some coffee in to the mixture along with the milk adds a great mocha flavor. consistency was good. thanks!

Very good frosting!  Only downfall is that it doesn't make very much, but I couldn't stop eating it, so that's probably why! lol!  Anyway, will probably use all the time, very good and easy.  I frosted a boxed butter recipe cake in a 9x13 pan and it got rave reviews.  Thanks Tracy

This was a good chocolate frosting. It did spread nice and easy and does also hold up very well. Consintency is great too. I would just like a little more of a chocolatey taste.

The only thing this is missing is a creamy taste so I added 1/3 cup of whipped cream cheese and that made all the difference! Trader Joe's makes this yummy yogurt based whipped cream cheese and it's the best cream cheese I have ever had. Really zests any frosting up!

This is a fantastic recipe!!  It is the same consistency as canned frosting, but much better tasting and so easy.  I doubled the recipe to frost an 8 inch round double layer cake and had enough left over to frost cupcakes for my daughter's class.  I did add a pinch of salt to bring out the chocolate and ended up adding an extra tablespoon of cocoa to thicken the frosting.  I substituted milk and margarine and it turned out great!!!!!

This is a decent, quick frosting recipe.  It was a little sweeter and less chocolate than I would have liked, but what can you expect from so much confectioner's sugar?  This recipe is great when you need a batch of frosting fast.  I tempered the sweetness and brought out the flavor with a little salt and some extra cocoa.  This recipe is a keeper and I would definitely use it again.

Very creamy--chocolatey buttercream--mmmm!!  It tasted so delicious--very smooth tasting and really really easy to spread on the cake. I used 3 cups of powdered sugar and 6 T. of evaporated milk, and it was enough for a whole 2-layer cake.  You can add more sugar or milk or cocoa to taste--it's a flexible, great recipe for frosting!

Great frosting. For the people who gave it ONE star, or complained of it being gritty, I'm guessing that they used GRANULATED sugar, not confectioner's (powdered) sugar, and/or margarine, and not butter, and didn't use evaporated milk...One, Im thinking, used hot cocoa mix instead of cocoa...lol
There is NO way that you can follow the directions and not wind up with an outstanding frosting

I have been making frostings for a lot of years, as a homemaker, and a caterer! This frosting is amazing, creamy, chocolaty, and delicious! There are time we have been rushed with a meal, and I have resorted to commercial frostings, but no more! This simple buttercream goes together quickly, and effortlessly. I doubled the recipe to adequately frost a 1/2 sheet cake, and it even left a little for “licking the bowl!”

Yum! This recipe is soooo good. I would eat this frosting by the spoonful. I am a huge chocoholic, and so is my friend with whom I bake. It goes on almost anything and still tastes delish. This frosting was a HUGE success! If their were more than five stars I would put that.

Super easy recipe for frosting! I thought it was almost too chocolatey, but my kids thought it was perfect! I didn't change a thing in the recipe. I would recommend doubling though. We made 2 dozen cupcakes and wouldn't have had enough frosting if we hadn't.

I made this recipe to use on the One Bowl chocolate cake that I made.  It  was great and I will make it again.  But I may try it with regular milk as I , like one of the other reviewers, hate wasting most of a can of evaporated milk.

Needed something quick and found this recipe , I didn’t have anything besides dark coco powder and chocolate milk lol. But it was perfect . I added more powdered sugar to make sure it holds its shape and a little salt so it won’t be too sweet. Covered the dozen cupcakes and had leftover frosting. Perfect ! I posted my picture of my dark chocolate frosting with gold glitter

Decided that I was going to make my husband a Birthday Cake from  scratch. Even though canned frosting is easier, I opted to make frosting from scratch as well.  Well let me tell you, this was Outstanding.  It's a little bit of work, but well worth it.  Funny thing is, I don't own a sifter; used a whisk. I will use this recipe from now on. Thank you for submitting!!!!!

I liked it.  I used half and half versus evaporated milk as its what I had on hand.  I had to make two batches to cover a two layer, 9 inch round cake.

This is awesome! I dislike chocolate frosting. Mostly because no one knows how to make it, they put too much on the dessert ... or both. I really really liked it! My family loved it! I doubled it so I could make a checkerboard cake. It doubled nicely. I Best chocolate frosting recipe ever! It tastes like chocolate, not cocoa powder. It spreads beautifully. I scarified my ketosis for this and it was worth it.

This recipe was delicious but I did make a few changes. Due to realizing I had run out of cocoa powder just a little to late I had to come up with an alternative. Instead of cocoa powder I did 4 Tablespoons Carob and 2 tablespoons Ghirardelli  Chocolate Caramel hot cocoa mix. It gave the recipe a nice, rich, caramel taste. We all loved it.

Just made this recipe and it was wonderful!  Most frosting/icing recipes are way too sweet for my taste, but this one is perfect. It's sweet but not too sweet and definitely better than any of that gross canned icing.  I really like it a lot!  The only change I made was that I used 2% milk instead of the evaporated milk. Just didn't want to open a can for such a small amount. I saw other reviews that said it worked for them so I did it and it worked for me too!

Good...used 2% milk, and half n half. Upped the liquid by a lot to get it to come together. I forgot about creaming butter n sugar in the beginning...dumped everything in and started mixing on my mixer.

I followed recipe exactly but increased quantities 1-1/2 times per suggestion of another reviewer to frost a two-layer round cake.  The quantity made was just right, with a little bit leftover in the bowl to be eaten up by the baker (me).  A couple of comments:  1) I used Nestle Toll House Cocoa Powder. I felt the flavor was a bit weak, so will probably try other cocoa powders to see if that will help in the future.  My advice based on today is don't be afraid to add 1-2 Tbsp. more of cocoa powder.  2) This makes a fluffy consistency frosting and gets fluffier the more it is beaten. I was able to spread it on the cake with just a rubber spatula, leaving nice looking swirls. 3) Be sure to add ingredients slowly and alternate liquid/dry. Be sure to use salted butter and that it is room-temp, even a bit on the warm, left-on-the-counter-overnight-consistency and you'll get even better results. 4) Another reviewer also noted to decrease the amount of vanilla. for my 1-1/2 recipe, 1 tsp. would have been enough.  I agree with other reviewers that this is not an overly-sweet recipe - perhaps because it whips up so much. It is a recipe I will use again.

This recipe was super simple and turned out great even with the 100 other distractions I had going on in the kitchen. Not sure  how it didn't turn out for some. If it's gritty there is something majorly wrong with your ingredients. Did you use regular white sugar instead of powdered?? If it's runny your butter was closer to melted than softened.

Great chocolate frosting!. Definitely creamy and chocolatey without being overpowering. I paired this with Whipped Cream Cake II and it was a hit! The only change I made was to use heavy cream rather than evaporated milk (didn't want to open one just for this frosting as I normally don't use it). Add that milk/cream gradually as you may need more or less depending on your needs/tastes. Thanks for sharing!

Subbed half and half as I didn't have evaporated milk and it still turned out delicious and smooth.  Used it on some cookie dough filled cupcakes and will definitely use again for other recipes as I work my way to no boxed desserts.  Thanks!

Baked a French Vanilla Bundt cake for a co-worker.  She requested vanilla cake with chocolate frosting.  This is the first I made this recipe and this will be the recipe used from now on.  It is so creamy and easy to spread.  Followed the recipe to a "T".

Omg! This frosting is amazing! I made to top a chocolate birthday cake and my husband begged me to make it again the week after his birthday! Didn't change a thing and actually doubled and it covered one double layer round cake perfectly!  You can actually buy the very small can of the evaporated milk and it was the perfect size to double this recipe without wasting any!

HANDS DOWN-BEST CHOCOLATE FROSTING!! It reminds me of the whipped chocolate frosting from the container-the kind I used to just eat from the container as a kid. But this is way better. Its got that homemade taste and none of that preservative added junk!

Great taste and consistency. I threw everything into one bowl, then used the hand mixer, only took 5 minutes. It is wonderful, which is amazing for me, because usually anything I try to make (especially for the first time) turns out to be a disaster.

I substituted 2% milk for evaporated milk, because that is what I had on hand. I also used Ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa powder. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted amazing. I made it to ice 24 cupcakes and it fell short by 4. I added an extra tbsp of milk halfway through to help with the piping consistency. It tastes very fresh and creamy. Goes great with French vanilla boxed cupcakes. Hubby loved it! Adding this to my recipe box.

Excellent, simple chocolate frosting! This is a great frosting with ingredients I usually have on hand. Simple to make and great taste. Everyone love it! I followed the recipe but added 1/3 more of each item to use a full stick of butter (8 tbsp). This was a generous amount for a two layer 9 inch cake. I'll definitely use this over can frosting.

I make this for my chocolate fans in the house. When I make this I triple it and add each time one tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder. It turns out perfect every time. The frosting is fudge chocolate flavor, rich and not too sweet. This recipe is a keeper.

This is my go-to chocolate buttercream recipe. You have to tweak it to your liking, but usually the recipe as is works great. I sometimes like it with more chocolate and so I'll up the cocoa powder by a tablespoon or two. I like to use evaporated milk over regular milk, or if you use regular milk use whole milk.

This is a great recipe! I used 4 tbsp of 1% milk and it turned out perfectly. I think they key is sifting the icing sugar and cocoa so it's smooth, not gritty. It's not the perfect sweetness, love it!

Ive been baking for a few years now and using the stuff you buy in markets to frost my cakes and cupcakes. I wanted to make an entire cake completely from scratch. I doubled the recipe in order to fill 9 inch 2 layer cake. It worked out perfectly. I'm never using store boughy again.

I was making a cake for Fathers Day, my dad loves chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, and realized I was out of frosting. I immediately went to allrecipes.com and found this amazing recipe! It was easy to make, and I had all the ingredients in my pantry, so great. It was a huge hit and honestly, I don't think I'll buy pre-made frosting again.

I doubled this recipe since the description said the original would not fill a double layer 8/9 inch cake.  I had at least a full cup leftover. It makes a lot.  Also, since I do not like icings and frostings that are overly sweet, when I doubled I cut back on the sugar (only 4 cups) and still found it to be quite sweet.  I used a Mexican Vanilla and it was a bit over-powering, but I cannot blame that on the recipe, lol. Not a very deep, fudgy flavor, but a reliable chocolate frosting.  Next time I make this, I will cut back more on the sugar and use regular vanilla or cut that out completely.

OMG!!  This frosting is the best we've ever tasted....even better than store bought!!  I will NEVER use any other frosting again.  Made this for my son's bday cake (using Simple White Cake recipe from this site - yum). My father-in-law raved about my cake for days & said it blows away the other frosting I was using.  I used regular milk since I didn't have evaporated milk & it still turned out perfect! The recipe as is covered my entire 13x9 cake leaving leftovers (for licking!!).  Thank you SO much!!!!  :)

This frosting was okay. At first I tried making it with just 5T of evaporated milk...seemed too dry. I also cut out 3/4 cup of confectioners sugar. Since I was putting this on a double layer cake and I worried there wouldn't be enough frosting, I made another batch. After making two batches, I then incorporated them all into the small bowl and mixed again. In the end, I cut the sugar down to 4 cups and I used the entire small can of evaporated milk. It was edible and others liked it, but I didn't think it was anything amazing.

Ok,I usually do not drink wine at 11 am, but I was the daughter-in-law who kind of got stuck with making dinner and dessert for my father-in-law's 75th birthday this weekend.  I got brownie points from the in-laws because chips and dip was brought by the others.  Ca-ching!! I'll get to the frosting review in a sec.  Made 40 marinade teriyaki chicken legs, Fried Rice Restaurant style, and a devil's food chocolate cake with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting.  Chicken legs were looking great in the oven, thank God!  I have a way of making a HUGE mess in the kitchen when I'm hurried and making food for a big crowd.  Did I mention that only half the people showed?  Fried Rice managed to get done.  Ok, after spilled rice, scrambled eggs, peas & carrots on floor, I ended up with a gallon of it.  I did mention that half the relatives were a no show?  The wine?  Husband started to pour a glass.  I eyed the clock and said it was still morning.  He said that somewhere in the world it was already afternoon.  No argument there! Ok, the frosting.  Four month old hand mixer died.  Five sips of wine.  Mixer in garbage can.  Transfer ingredients to Kitchen-Aid.  Accidentally caught sweater sleeve on speed lever.  Ever see powdered sugar and cocoa fly at the speed of a Maserati?  Reminded myself that it was Sunday and decided not to cuss out-loud.  I think.  FYI: God's name was not involved. A few more sips of wine.  Half-half cream & some butter shortening was used.  Everyone lived--including me.

I've searched far and wide for the perfect chocolate butter cream frosting and oh...my...gosh. Words cannot describe how good this is. Try this and you will never eat another chocolate frosting again. And certainly not one from a can! It was simple--I had all the ingredients already--and the perfect texture and consistency. It was smooth, creamy and fluffy, yet stiff enough to hold it's shape on a cupcake. While you can sub with milk, I recommend sticking with the evaporated milk if you can. And when you are incorporating ingredients add a little at a time, alternating as you go--like she says--between the sugar mixture and the milk. When all are combined, be sure to beat an extra 3-5 minutes (with a hand mixer) so it gets nice and fluffy. SO GOOD!

Amazing! I used it on the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe and it was the best chocolate cake I've ever made, let alone eaten. It's a milk chocolate so I served it with a drizzle of dark chocolate genache to please my dark choc lovers in the house. There's no such thing as too much chocolate!

Best recipe for frosting I've tried! Just what I was looking for & easy! People say it doesn't cover the whole cake or isn't enough frosting, well I frosted a 9" round cake and a medium large square cake. I think people say its not enough because they overload their cakes with frosting but mine turned out fine. I used 2% milk and enjoyed my homemade cake for my dads birthday :) Happy Birthday Love you

This is wonderful.  I doubled the recipe because I needed to fill and frost a cake and I like a lot of frosting!  To anyone, such as one reviewer, who couldn't put these ingredients together and come up with a good frosting, I'd say you need to retire from baking cakes.  This involves only basic ingredients and techniques.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

A great buttercream frosting.  Very easy to pipe on my cupcakes.  I made a double batch and frosted 18 cupcakes (I was generous with the frosting!).  Gotta admit, this is my first time piping frosting, so I was leary, but nooooo problems.  I'm going to keep this one for sure!

This is seriously the best chocolate frosting that I've ever had in my life! I don't know if it was the butter, but it was intensely creamy and just the right amount of sweet. It worked perfect on chocolate cupcakes and this was a huge hit!

I just made this recipe and it work out great and the taste was even greater. It was that good. The only thing I have had to revise was the amount of carnation milk. I found that I needed about 5-7 tablespoons instead of the 5. Kudos! This is a keeper. Thanks

Excellent frosting with an outstanding chocolaty taste. Prepared exactly as described and it was enough to generously frost 20 cupcakes. I thought it was a perfect consistency.

This turned out entirely too runny yet the butter was clumpy. Maybe I should have melted the butter and then chilled the frosting after. But the recipe didn't say that. I followed it exactly, and I'm quite disappointed. Tastes OK but looks horrible, running down the sides with visible clumps of butter. The butter had been softened, it just never fully incorporated into the frosting.

I'm not a chocolate frosting fan, but I've gotta give this one a 5.  I loved the mild chocolate taste and the creamy texture.  It was very easy to work with.  If you are looking for a deep chocolate taste, this isn't it.  But, it is rich, creamy and definitely a nice compliment to 'Black Magic Cake' another AR recipe.  I know I will be using this recipe again.

I used Ghiradelli chocolate powder. Added 1/2 tsp salt. Very chocolatey and intensely flavored. But it wasn't a lot for two 9" rounds.

Holy batman!  Excellent!  I am a baker and bake mostly from scratch EXCEPT for frosting!  The reason being is because I HATE the amount of powdered sugar required for most recipes!  This is perfect!  Personal preference I do use an entire stick of butter-why not?  And I did use 2 % milk-wondering why evaporated milk instead?  Didn't have any on hand.  Thanks for sharing!

Holy cow this is sickly sweeeeeet! I had to add twice the amount of butter called for to make this the desired sweetness (or less-sweet) and texture and some extra cocoa powder because it's really not all that chocolatey (just sweet sweet SWEET). I'm not super picky and I like sweet icing, but not to the point of tasting nothing else. This recipe really baffled me, will not be making again.

This was good, but VERY sweet and I didn't think the cocoa flavor was strong enough. Next time I will add a dash of salt like other reviewers and a bit more cocoa. I hate recipes that only use a small amount of something (evap. milk) that you know you won't use the rest, but I didn't mind this time only because the can was going to be expired in a month. Otherwise, I'd probably use regular milk. This more than generously frosted a 9x13 cake with some left over so those who didn't have enough to frost a two layer 9" cake, WOW!

This is a very delicious recipe! I didn't have any evaporated milk on hand, so I took the advice of another reviewer, and just used regular milk. I also did not measure out the milk, but poured about 3 tablespoons of milk into the bowl. My mom used to run a home owned bakery and she would put a pinch or two of salt in the frosting. This helps to make it not quite so sickeningly sweet. The frosting was a tiny bit on the runny side, but that might have been because I didn't use evaporated milk. I was using this frosting on cupcakes, so it didn't really matter to me that it was slightly runny, and it was also easier to squeeze out of the pastry bag. I really like how easy it is to whip this up, and I almost always have these ingredients on hand. I will probably use this again when I need a quick chocolate frosting recipe!

Made this recipe for a birthday cake.  Followed it exactly until I got to the evaporated milk.  Replaced evaporated milk with 2% milk.  Still an excellent recipe.  Loved it.  One of the best butter frostings I've tried.  Will definitely make this again and again.  It spreads well and tastes great.  I was a bit disappointed in the idea that this recipe will not frost AND fill a 9" round cake.  I spread it so thin in the middle and had way too much frosting left over.  I could have filled it and skipped the leftovers.  Maybe other people like a thicker layer of frosting than I do. I don't know.  All I did was give it an extra 30 seconds on high at the end to inject some air into the frosting.  It increased the volume.

As an inexperienced cook/baker, I wanted an easy recipe for my daughter and her friend, but then I forgot to read the instructions.  All the ingredients ended up thrown into a bowl together at one time and blended with a hand mixer.  It turned out great!!  It has a very creamy consistency.  I put it in a plastic baggie, cut an edge off, and we piped it onto chocolate cupcakes.  My daughter, her friend, and my parents thought it was incredibly yummy!!

This frosting turned out amazing!!! I've never  bought frosting from the store so I'm used to having to whip the frosting and make sure that everything is consistent so I was really surprised that it turned out so good considering I used cold shortening instead of room temp. butter and I never even bothered to beat it, I just mixed it very well

This is a very good chocolate frosting recipe (probably become my go-to chocolate frosting when I can't use a cream cheese frosting).  Used this as an 'outer ring' of frosting on German Chocolate Cupcakes, paired with the pecan/coconut frosting, it was wonderful!  I found the consistency perfect, even perhaps a little stiff to pipe.  No adjustments necessary here.

used 5 tbsp skim milk instead of evaporated milk (cant stand waste & didnt want to waste the rest of the can).  maybe because of that, frosting was a little creamier because of that, more like the store bought "whipped" frosting texture than the old regular store bought frosting texture.

5 star taste, but I subtracted a star because it was a little soft and didn't make enough to frost 24 cupcakes.  I will definately use it again, but will double the recipe and use extra cocoa to stiffen it up a bit.

Totally awesome!  It is a must to whip the butter first and add the milk little by little to get the desired consistency.  This is my new staple chocolate frosting!

I like many others joined just to rate this recipe. First time making a homemade chocolate frosting and I will NEVER buy store bought again! I doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough to frost my 9X13 cake and glad I did, now I have extra to snack on! :) I followed t he recipe and the only thing I would say is you really don't even need to add the vanilla. My husband said it wasn't chocolatey enough for him, but I thought it was perfect and I used Hershey's cocoa powder. Not sure people who make this say it turns out like , because if you follow recipe it's delish! thanks for sharing!

This recipe is creamy, not too rich, and tastes really good!  It is not too sugary.  I did not have evaporated milk, so I just used what I had, which is 1% milk.  I will definetly use this from now on.

excellent frosting recipe!  Enough to frost one batch of brownies, but not if you pipe your frosting...then double (you'll have left overs) or 1 1/2 it.  
Also, 5 tablespoons is a little more than 1/3 cup (for the evaporated milk

I used this frosting to fill a double-layer chocolate cake made with Duncan Hines Devil's Food Pound Cake recipe.  It was perfect and the best part of the cake!  I have made so many different frostings in the past and at best came up with something that was edible.  This was so creamy, so good.  When layered in the middle, it tasted like ganache!  I don't know how it works frosting the outside of a cake, but this was a spectacular filling.  It will be my only chocolate frosting from now on! I have no idea how much sugar I used (much less than half what the recipe called for).  I just added until it was to my liking, then adjusted the evaporated milk to get the right consistency.  I hope it works with whole milk too - using evaporated milk does seem like a waste.

Now if only I could find a vanilla frosting this good.

It doesn't have the milk chocolate flavor that I like.  We added more evaporated milk than what the recipe called for, in order to spread.

One word - delish!  I didn't have evaporated milk, so I used half 1% and half 1/2&1/2.  It was creamy and chocolatey, although the color is lighter than I expected.

This was good.  A nice change of pace from the typical hershey's chocolate syrup.  I doubled the recipe and used one jar of smucker's hot fudge topping.  I used it to decorate with and it was easy to work with.

I was in the mood for chocolate, and boy did I get it with this frosting! It was just as I was craving- very easy to make, nice and creamy. Kinda tastes like the top of a hostess cupcake, but the creamy version of course. I will be making this again!

Delicious and super easy!!!  Just what I was looking for.  I added a bit more milk because I wanted it very creamy--more like the consistency of can frosting not stiff buttercream.   YUM!!!!!

i thought this chocolate frosting was good, but not the "great!" i was going for.  i think it could be more chocolatey, as this has a very mild chocolate flavor.  and it was creamy for sure, but i think the texture was a little off...can't put my finger on the problem.  i used these to frost cupcakes for a baby shower, and piped the icing on.  it worked ok, but if it were a little stiffer it would have been a better consistency to pipe.  i didn't want to add any more sugar though, as it was very sweet already.  thanks!

Yummy!! Last night I had a kid sleepover & made a quick cake from the back of the pantry late night. I didn't have frosting (luckily) & found this recipe. I replaced the evaporated milk with whole as it's what I had on hand, added a tsp of light corn syrup for gloss and was out of vanilla but had almond extract so I used that. Delicious!! 

As a side note, to make a box mix taste stellar, I replace half of the oil with melted butter and mix by hand until well incorporated rather than beaters.

Perfect for my chocolate cake. Elevated it from a delicious home made cake with my usual butter cream frosting to a restaurant - style dessert. Beautifully glossy, smooth texture, and pipeable.

This was a wonderful buttercream.  easy to just add a little more or less milk to make firmer for decorating and thinner for spreading.  Will use again soon.

Very rich and delightful frosting.  This is more buttery than sweet which is excellent.  Ended up using only half of the milk as I wanted a bigger frosting.  Will definitely use this again.

I had never made chocolate icing before (I'm queen of the cream cheese icing) and this was amazing.  so light and fluffy and does not dry out and get crusty.  It turned a plain pan of brownies into a yummy dessert.  I will be making this for a chocolate cake in the near future.  I will never buy chocolate icing again!

I needed a fast chocolate frosting that I could make with what I already had in the house.  This fit the bill and the chocolate flavor was good, but the mouth feel was slightly grainy.  Not sure if that had anything to do with me using whole milk instead of evaporated milk though.  My husband  thought it tasted not sweet enough, and he does not like overly sweet frosting.  Good enough to try to perfect though.

very good frosting & very easy to work with.  I decotrate cakes & this frosting set up nice and was able to spread it real smooth.  I started using heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk but had to use some evo milk as it became to think.  It is not real sweet and it doesn't have the fake chocolate taste either.  I will keep this in my recipe box for sure.  But still looking to tweek it just a little, it seems to be missing something but not sure what just yet.  Maybe a little chocolate extract or a little salt, not real sure yet.

I have never never been a huge fan of any kind of frosting but my kids really wanted me to make something with chocolate frosting. I just whipped up a batch of this recipe and I have changed my whole opinion on frosting. It was so creamy and not overpoweringly sweet (which is why I never liked frosting before). I highly recommend this recipe...thank you VERY much!

Really enjoyed this frosting! To lessen the sweetness  I beat in half a brick (4 oz) of cream cheese. This over a 9x13 chocolate cake just hit the spot!

This is great! I used hershey's special dark cocoa powder and heavy cream in place of the evaporated milk. The consistancy was perfect and I didn't need to adjust a thing. It piped perfectly. The consistancy changes depending on how long you beat it and I wanted a fluffy frosting so I whipped it for quite a while, which also increased the volume quite a bit. I really appreciate how this is not too sweet. I used it to frost cupcakes and it generously frosted 14 with more left over. Thanks!

Tasted so good! Very rich, creamy chocolate flavor! Would have rated 5 stars, except that it didn't hold up well in the heat. Wasn't even a 100 degrees (I'm in Sacramento), and it melted. Tasted great, though, almost like a ganache or glaze. But when presentation counts, I would be disappointed.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe, although I did make a few substitutions in order to make it milk-free: I used coconut milk instead of evaporated milk and margarine instead of butter, but it turned out extraordinary. It was perfectly chocolatey, not leaving anything more to be wanted, and I have a feeling it would hold up to quite a bit of tweaking. Great recipe.

LOVE this!  I had to adjust because my daughter is allergic to milk, but it was an easy swap and the first time the others had no idea it was dairy-free!

Easy and good. I made 24 cupcakes for a party so I ended up doubling the recipe and I had a ton left over so I would recommend that you only make on batch and see how it goes.

I normally prefer my cake without frosting. But this frosting is delicious. I used low fat 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the evaporated milk as it's what I had on hand. Otherwise I made this according to the recipe. It made enough for a 9x13 cake with just over a 1/2 cup left ove - although I didn't put on a thick layer of frosting. I'll make this again & again!!

This was a wonderful chocolate frosting.  It was light and creamy.  I used it on the Gold Cake from this site.  Whole family loved it.  This is going in my recipe box and will now be my go to frosting.  Had to us 2% milk as that is all I had on hand and it still turned out great!!

As an avid cake maker, I typically stick to my trusted butter cream.  I wanted something lighter this time.  I doubled this recipe as per other people's suggestions so I could fill and frost a 2 layer cake.  I substituted 2 tablespoons of the milk and the 2 teaspoons of vanilla for extremely strong coffee so that I would get mocha frosting.  It turned out wonderfully.  It is light and fluffy and not overly sweet, as butter cream usually is.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will be using it again.

Amazing and delicious! I made this recipe increasing the ingredients to 1-1/2 the original and it was PLENTY for an 9 X 13 cake. As others suggested, I used regular (skim) milk instead of the evaporated milk. If it's too thick, just add some more butter and milk. I also mixed in chopped walnuts before spreading it on. It was a hit and I will definitely make it again.

This is SO easy! I messed up the order of the ingredients and it still came out really great. Made a double batch to cover an entire chocolate cake. Someone on the comments rated it low stars because they messed up the recipe. That's user error, not a bad recipe. Try it! You'll like it! :)

My kids wanted to bake a cake tonight, but we had no frosting.  I really didn't feel like making any since my last 2 attempts at homemade frosting weren't very successful.  But I googled "easy and quick chocolate frosting recipe" and came across this, and it looked easy and simple and I had all the ingredients so I gave it a shot.
It was so easy, and tastes pretty darn good.  Much better than store-bought.  I don't think I'll be buying chocolate frosting anymore.  Now if I can only find a recipe as easy and good as this for a white frosting I'll be happy. 
Thank you Tracy!! My children thank you too! :)
BTW, I followed the recipe EXACTLY. The consistency ended up perfect.

Great frosting!  I did add a little bit more cocoa and next time I'll try a little bit better brand of cocoa.  I made a three layer yellow cake so I double the recipe.  I had more than enough frosting.  The frosting was so easy to spread and I even decorated with it too.  It will be my go to frosting recipe.

This frosting was perfectly thick and creamy but, i think the recipe calls for to much confectioners sugar.  It was too sweet but other than that, it was good.

Creamy, indeed!  What a gorgeous golden sheen to them, as well.  I did, however, tinker with it a bit (I know..  don't do that and review, right? hehe).. to reduce amount of sugar (used 2 cups).  Didn't have butter, so I used margarine, and in lieu of evaporated milk, used 2%.  Nixed the vanilla to keep the chocolatey richness.  I added milk as was needed, and I do think it totaled about 5TB.  Very easy to spread, although keep in mind that it sets quite quickly - and if you choose to adorn it with sprinkles, do so right after applying frosting on each one.  This one's a keeper, as I'd been looking for a simple, successful, and yummy chocolate frosting that isn't a ganache (for times when I don't want to use cream). :)

Great recipe! I think for those that said it was terrible.....I'm going to go ahead and guess that they used 'condensed milk' instead of EVAPORATED milk.....make sure you don't make that mistake...

If you actually follow the recipe exactly like it is written, which I did, it's a great recipe. Definitely do not skip the sifting of the confectioner's sugar and cocoa powder or you will have lumpy icing. 

It had excellent texture, just the right amount of sweetness and easy to spread!

Incredible!!  The best chocolate frosting I have ever made. Super creamy and great consistency. After I frosted the cake I chilled it and the frosting was almost fudge! Received nothing but compliments.

Really good and easy although I had to use quite a bit more milk than the recipe called for.  Perfect consistency for spreading though.  Thanks for the post!

This is fantastic!!!  I ended up using seven tablespoons of heavy whipping cream and this came out mousse-like.  Very great. Sticks together well and pipes easily.  Fantastic recipe!

I also substituted 2% milk and it was just fine. This is an excellent recipe.  If you need this to make a bigger batch, instead of doubling it, try whipping it with your beater.  It fluffs it up and almost doubles it. Very good and simple flavor. If you try this and it doesn't work for you, try better ingredients. The quality you put in will make a difference.

The only minor thing I changed was I used homogenized milk instead of evaporated milk, because I didn't have any on hand.  Turned out fantastic!  Thanks!

I loved this frosting. I was afraid that it was too fudgy at first, but it's amazing the day after you make it! I will be making this again. Follow the recipe exactly, and I think you'll get the results you're looking for.

SO good! I used 2% milk instead of the evaporated milk as one reviewer mentioned and it was really good. I made this all by hand (no blender) and it was still really easy. Kept in the fridge, it was still good 3 days later to frost cupcakes and eat!

Really good frosting, but I found the measurements way off - I used alot more evaporated milk than called for (can't say how much, at one point I just started pouring it in from the can!) But the final product was delicious, and tastes even better the next day... on an iced cake, of course

Best chocolate frosting I think I ever ate, and it was my very first attempt to make frosting! I needed to thin it down a bit to make it spreadable. I just used another 2 Tablespoons of the Carnation milk. Oh, I beat the final mixture with wire beaters a good long time time it was velvety. I suggest using Hersey's Special Dark cocoa powder. Very, very rich.

The consistency was perfect.  I didn't have trouble with it being too runny or grainy as some other reviewers, but I measured everything exactly as specified in the recipe and sifted the cocoa and powdered sugar.  The ony negative is that I would have preferred more chocolate flavor.

I tried this recipe and loved it instantly, it doesn't taste much like regular store bought frosting. It's better! But don't let it sit out too long, because it will become too stiff and much more difficult to work with. Overall, great recipe!

I've made other chocolate frostings before but this one turned out the best! I followed the directions exactly. I let the butter come to room temp. I measured out the sugar and cocoa, then sifted them. I used a stand mixer and the consistency was perfect without extra milk or sugar.   I used a ziploc bag to pipe a thin layer of frosting on 22 cupcakes and had about half of the frosting left over.  The frosting started to harden after a while, but left at room temperature, it is still very soft.    The taste is creamy, smooth, chocolately but not too rich.  There is no cocoa powder taste. I will definitely make this again!

Perfection! Just want to keep eating it... had to frost the cupcakes so I would stop sneaking tastes =) Followed recipe, except used 1% milk (didn't want to open a can for just a few tablespoons since I was only doing half a batch). A keeper!

This was amazing! I used a hand mixer to make it super fluffy. One recipe was plenty to ice between a layer of cake, and I had extra left over for the sides. It tastes wonderful. I also used regular milk (2%) in place of the evaporated milk, and it turned out just fine.

Per other reviewer's suggestion, I used 2% milk instead of evap milk. This frosting was excellent and so easy to make! After beating the butter, it didn't look like it was going to be enough to blend with the sugar/cocoa but everything turned out well. I recommend using a mixing bowl with high sides because when I was gradually beating in the sugar/cocoa, it kind of flies everywhere and made a mess.

I don't usually make homemade frosting as I found good old "Betty Crocker" to always work. I decided to make this for my homemade vanilla cupcakes and it is truly delicious. Worth the time and effort.

This was so easy!!  In about 5 minutes I had perfect frosting!  Note:  I added the butter last...and to be honest, I think you could cut back quite a bit on the amount and still have it come out well. Also, I used another reviewer's tip to substitute plain milk for the evaporated milk.  Worked just fine. Thanks!

This is the best chocolate frosting I have ever made! It makes too little though. You can't even ice a 3 tier cake with this recipe. I always double it.

This frosting is AMAZING!! Being 7 months pregnant I have been craving chocolate and this frosting, paired with a homemade chocolate cake recipe from this site, has definitely hit the spot! (My baby will be doing cartwheels haha).     I used double butter, milk, and chocolate, but kept the conf. sugar the same. I did add a couple shakes of powdered french vanilla creamer too.     All in all, there was plenty to spread on my double layer round cake and some left that I think I will spread between double chocolate chip cookies...when I make them.      I like this recipe because the frosting is light, easy to work with, and resembles chocolate mousse! I would definitely feel confident serving this frosting with a dessert for dinner guests. Thanks for the keeper!

Super easy, very delicious, and travels well. But, double this so you have plenty of icing for frosting a double layer cake. (grown-ups and kids give rave reviews)

This was good although I found it a tad grainy. I used soy milk rather than evaporated. If you want something really gooey use a frosting that includes melted chocolate but for frosting cupcakes (as we did) this is perfect.

So good! I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and (oddly enough) fat free half and half, since that's what I had on hand. It was perfect for spreading and didn't harden at all. I got rave reviews- thanks!!

Very chocolaty and easy to make. I was just disappointed that it wasn't as light and fluffy as I had hoped. It was more dense and creamy. I made a 1.5 batch and it was just enough for my layer cake. Any less wouldn't have iced the entire cake. I will definitely use this again.

This recipe is not all that.  I know Tracy meant well, but I made it, just to try something different.  It was way to "runny" and the taste was not that great.  I'll stick to my moms recipe which is out of this world.  Sorry I can't rate it higher-I have to be honest.

I love this simple frosting recipe I just used it on my chocolate pudding cupcakes. I half the recipe though cuz I am frosting about 24 cupcakes. It works well with my cupcakes. Will surely make it to frost my cupcakes again.

This was a great recipe. A keeper for sure. Great taste without being overwhelming. A doubled recipe gave me just enough to stack and frost a 3 layer cake.

I just made this frosting the taste was wonderful, I had to make a second batch because me and my daughter couldn't stop eating it by the spoonful...we didn't have enough to frost the cake lol!  I used my kitchen aid mixer and I think the trick to making it extra fluffy is to whip it on high speed for a few minutes and it gets really light and fluffy.  I ran out of vanilla and I didn't even miss it, it was still perfect! Thank you!

This is the first time I have made chocolate frosting and this recipe is out of this world!  It is creamy and delicious and the frosting really holds its shape.  There was plenty of frosting for two dozen cupcakes and a few leftover spoonfuls for the cook!  I did not modify it and LOVE LOVE LOVE it!

This has to be the best chocolate frosting I have ever tasted!!  I made it yesterday to put on my birthday cake, and my kids swore that I had used a container of frosting from the store!  Absolutely delicious....the only thing I did differently was to substitute half-n-half for the evaporated milk.  It made more than enough to frost a 9x13 cake, with some left over even.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful frosting recipe....it is going in my 'use often file'!! :)

Perfect!I definitely agree with the other reviews that this tasted better than the canned icing. I followed the other by measuring the icing first and then sifting. I also added more cocoa (instead of sugar) to get the right consistency. Instead of adding just vanilla, I added half vanilla and half strong brewed coffee to bring out the chocolate. YUM! My girlfriends and I licked the bowl clean after icing our cupcakes. (BTW-I have no idea how some reviews mentioned their icing was runny. They may have just measured the liquids wrong.)

SO SO SO good. I was asked to create an intensely chocolate cake, and tried this frosting for it. It was amazing! Great consistency, spreads well and is firm enough for piping decorative edging. This is definitely a keeper!

I thought this was a great recipe - easy to make, and easy to modify if you want different flavor options. The first batch I made as the recipe stated - the only modification was that I used milk instead of evap. milk. The second batch I added a chocolate raspberry coffee in place of a couple tablespoons of the milk, but it turned out runnier than I would have liked, but luckily I had some of the first batch left over so I mixed in.   In both batches the flavor is great - I even ran out of vanilla after the first batch, but with the chocolate raspberry coffee added in, you couldn't really tell.   I will definitely use this for my go-to chocolate frosting from now on! Thanks so much!!

Very creamy (but it does get hard when it sits) while you spread it. I will probably add more milk to make it more creamy next time.

What a great recipe!  After my cupcakes were in the oven I realized I didn't have any frosting...this was quick and easy and far better than store bought!  I didn't have evaporated milk so I substituted half and half and it turned out great!  I don't think I will be buying frosting at the store again! :)

If you are a chocoholic, this frosting is for you! I used this recipe to frost Cream-filled Cupcakes from this site and I was disappointed with how stiff it turned out. It wasn't creamy enough to pipe on the cupcakes from a pastry bag without adding more milk. Other than that minor alteration, the frosting complimented the cupcakes well.

I LOVE this frosting!  For once, the ratio of wet to dry ingredients was perfect.  I used half and half instead of opening a can of evap milk.  I ended up with exactly the right amount to frost my batch of 18 cupcakes.  This is by far the best frosting recipe I've tried.  Thanks!

This recipe was a hit with my entire family!  The only change I made was to use half-n-half instead of milk, because I had it and needed to use it up.  I have used this recipe twice in the past week.  It's a keeper!

I made this to go with Black Magic Cake for my son's birthday.  I didn't want a frosting as dark as the cake.  Now, I am NOT a frosted cake fan, because frostings are just too much for me.  Too rich, too sweet.  But this was divine.  I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't be more happy with the results.  In fact, I've bought the stuff to do it again.

This frosting recipe was great and so quick and easy. My husband and son loved it. It is not too sweet and is very smooth and creamy. It came out the perfect consistancy. Would need to double for a layer cake but was just enough for a 9x13 sheet cake.

This turned out great for me- I used Plugra butter and madagascar bourbon vanilla- really creamy and rich.  So rich, in fact, that I just subbed in skim milk for the evap and it worked fine.  I would also add that instead of sifting the cocoa and sugar together I used a whisk- same effect, much less time, because my sifter is painfully slow.  I used the amts listed of each ingredient except that I didn't measure the milk- just kept pouring in a super thin stream while mixing until I had the consistency I wanted.

I have searched long and hard for a good chocolate frosting recipe and finally the search is over. This frosting has the best flavor and texture and even better is how easy it is to make. I would definitely recommend this recipe to any chocolate or cake lover out there.

easy and very good.  I made a german chocolate cake, but only had enough coconut frosting for the middle and top,  I put the creamy chocolate frosting on the sides.  Wow it was great.  I also used Dark Chocolate cocoa.  I added this recipe to my kitchen cabinet door.  thank you!!

Very rich and creamy, perfect frosting. I used heaving whipping cream instead of evaporated milk, i didn't have any on hand. My dad wanted frosted brownies for thanksgiving this year and i think they are going to be a hit with the Mmmmm...brownies recipe from this site.

This was so easy and delicious for vanilla cupcakes! I did not have evaporated milk so I used whole milk. I did add an additional tablespoon for a total of 6 T of milk. Very easy and yummy! Thanks!

Absolutely delicious and I don't even like frosting in fact I can usually do without it all together.  I used "bakingfan's" measurements of 4 1/8 c. sugar, 12 T. cocoa, 9 T. butter, 7.5 T. milk and 1.5 t. vanilla for a thicker version.  I also added probably an extra almost 1/4 cup of cocoa on top of this to thicken and make it really rich!  Made a birthday cake with this and "black magic cake"...This combination made a very rich moist chocolate cake.  Just wonderful, thank you!!!

This was so good!  I used a kitchen aid which I think helped make it really creamy.  If it was not for this frosting my cake would have been a total flop.  Thanks for sharing!

Make sure the butter is room temp. And beat it very well. The frosting will come out perfect. Remember, the key to good frosting is beating it. Yum!!

This is my new favorite frosting!  I have not found a recipe I like from scratch, until now!  I used regular milk, as I didn't have condensed, and it turned out fine.  I imagine the condensed milk would give it a stronger flavor, but combined with the cake I made, it tasted perfect.  I will definitely be using this on all future cakes!

This is a great recipe!  I was looking for something quick and easy.  This is very similar to how I make my chocolate frosting, but I didn't have specific measurements so I went searching for something that was close to how I did it.  And this was it!!  I found this to be nice and creamy and spreads very easy! You may want to double the recipe for a larger cake. I made a recipe and a half for a 3 layer cake and it worked out nicely!!  Also, I did use regular mile!  Thanks for sharing!!

Great recipe! It was very easy to work with and was the perfect amount to frost a two-layer cake. I did use regular milk so I wouldn't waste a can of evaporated, and I added an extra tablespoon or two to make it the right consistency for me.

I made this to frost brownies.  I took the advice of one of the reviewers and added an extra TBS of cocoa but it just seemed to be missing something.  I don't know what.  Something.  I'm going to keep trying other recipes till I find one I like.  Mine did turn out really thick, like we like it.

This is the best icing recipe ever!  Perfect for cupcakes especially.  I was worried at first because I didn't follow the directions exactly and just mixed the butter, evap.milk, and vanilla all at once.  I thought for sure it would not come out right, but it was surprisingly perfect. And I followed all of the measurements and ingredients to a T!  Tracy, I thank you, my husband thanks you and my children thank you:)

This is very creamy and very smooth. The texture is melt in your mouth. Only I thought it tasted "powdery" maybe because of the powdered sugar/dry cocoa? Overall a good frosting.

Yummy! It was quite a delicous chocolate frosting. And super easy to make. I would make a double batch to frost and fill a two layer cake. Will use again in the near future.

This was so easy and tasted great. I ran out of cocoa so I only put in about 3 tablespoons and that was perfect for me (a person who doesn't care for chocolate much) My husband (a chocolate lover) likes it but of course would have liked a little more chocolate.
I, too, used reg milk and only needed about 5 tablespoons to make it a soft spreading consistency.

I used cream instead of the milk , and I probably used about 8 T. of it. This recipe is very good. If I don't keep my finger out of the bowl I'll end up making another batch. In fact next time I will double it because it doesn't look like enough.

This is a great recipe so easy.  I used 3 T of half and half and 2 T of skim milk in place of the evaporated milk and it turned out great.  I also used smart balance in place of the butter.  Thank you for sharing I have been looking for an easy but delicious chocolate frosting forever!

I can tell this frosting is wonderful. And can't wait to try it again. Should have known better, but thought I could make it work -- I was short 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar so tried whipping the heck out of that much granulated sugar thinking I could get it to dissolve in the whipped butter. It didn't work so the frosting was a little gritty. People still ate it and loved it, but it would have been awesome if it had been completely smooth. Just relaying this in case anyone finds him or herself in the same predicament.

I thought that this frosting was mediocre at best.  I thought it was VERY sweet.  I have made a lot of frosting and this one is not even near the top of the list.

So - So, didn't care for this frosting.  It didn't taste very chocolatey at all, didn't have good consistency for spreading (too thin), and just all around not the best frosting I've made.  I will keep looking

Just made this and it turned out wonderful-I did as the other reviewers suggested and added less sugar and more butter (and more cocoa).  I didn't measure how much milk I put in, just used enough to make the consistency smooth.  I also added vanilla and almond extract.  I hand mixed this and it did not turn out "grainy" at all.

This is a good recipe.....however both times that I made it I had to either place the frosting or the cake after I had frosted it in the fridge for about 1/2 hr to firm it up.  Other than that it is very yummy and I will continue to use it.

Great tasting -- family loved it.  Followed other reviewer's advice and added an extra pat of butter and a little more cocoa, little less sugar.  Tastes better the next day.

Absolutely fabulous!!  My only suggestions would be to use 6 tablespoons of the evaporated milk & to use 7-8 tablespoons (1 stick) of butter.

This frosting is very good!  I made a double batch which filled and frosted a 2-layer 10" cake and 9 cupcakes with a little left over for a few decorations.  I did add a bit more cocoa for personal preference and used half-and-half instead of evaporated milk because that's what I had on hand.  Thanks!

My 11 year old son and I tried this. It's super easy, very light and fluffy, and the flavor is outstanding.  Could be a little thicker, but that's easily remedied with the addition of more cocoa or icing sugar if you prefer.  Great recipe, we love it!

This frosting was pretty good, but what I really did not like was the strong aftertaste or unsweetened cocoa. 

I am thinking the recipe would be better if it had a "sweetened" chocolate instead of the "unsweetened" chocolate. 

The after taste was very bitter and unsweet, as is the cocoa if you taste it by itself.

I made some adjustments, like I added more confectioners sugar, and more evaporated milk to try to reduce that strong bitter, unsweetend chocolate aftertaste. My attempts did succeed, and the frosting turned out pretty good!

I would highly recommend this frosting recipe.
Very yummy and sooo easy to make.  I followed the recipe and used ghiradelli cocoa.  I think the key is using a high quality cocoa to get an intense chocolate flavor.  It was very creamy and buttery and spread beautifully.  I also thickened with additional cocoa. 

With a recipe this easy, there's no reason to ever open a can!

This frosting is so chocolatey and delicious. I used regular milk instead of evaporated milk because there isn't a taste difference with the small amount needed. This generously frosted a 9x13 pan cake.
I cannot understand reviews that say this recipe is bland, lacking chocolate flavor or its gritty. If it's gritty, I'm betting granulated sugar was used instead of powdered sugar, and cocoa drink mix, not baking cocoa. There's just no other explanation.

Followed the directions and this came out like a glaze instead of frosting. I had to add more butter, another 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/8 c of cocoa and a few tbs of cream cheese to stiffen it up some. 5 tbs of milk is 2 tbs too much. Overall it's horrible. I'll sick to cream cheese or buttercream frosting.

Very yummy! I substituted milk for the evaporated milk and I didn't change the measurement. I used slightly softened butter. There wasn't enough frosting for 24 cupcakes, so next time, I will double the recipe.

Easy, fudge-y, my new go to, way better than store bought but needs to be made very close to when you will use it. I like half melted butter, think it whips up nicest. The taste and texture of this can’t be beat  but the taste is what’s everything !

I made this exactly as described except I had to substitute half and half (NOT FAT FREE) for the evaporated milk. It turned out delicious and without doubling the recipe,  I made a delicious,  creamy just perfect frosting for a 13 × 9 pan of brownies.

Perfect consistency. Used evaporated milk like they said. I added Crown Royal Vanilla instead of vanilla extract (a tad extra LOL). I also melted down semi sweet morsels (in microwave on 10 sec intervals) after cooling down I added it to the mix and whipped until extra light and fluffy. I think my husband will love it.

I made this recipe with two changes, one because of personal taste and the other because of the ingredients I had on hand. I used an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder because I'm a chocolate freak with a motto "anything chocolate is better than anything that's NOT!" and I like it good and chocolaty. The other was that the only milk I had was skim. It was so good that I can't imagine it needs to be anything else! I did use salted butter, since it didn't say which and I had salted on hand. It was also very easy. One review said it was "grainy". I wonder if they used plain sugar instead of powdered (confectioners). Thanks!

Delicious frosting. I made the recipe almost as is, except I did not have any canned milk. I used heavy cream instead. (For those reluctant to end up with a partially used can of milk, make Kraft mac & cheese for the kids the next day. Use evaporated milk instead of regular milk.) I doubled the frosting recipe as others suggested. Bad idea. I baked a 9x13 cake. It now has nearly 3” of frosting on top. Not that anyone complained. Double if you made layer cake only. Great recipe. Good proportions of ingredients.

First time making frosting and mmm mmm good! Sifting the confectioners sugar was a bit of a pain but was likely worth it. Not sure I sifted enough, so I slowly added the evaporated milk and ended up only using 4 tbls and added some extra cocoa to get the right amount of chocolate flavor (PS I use the Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa powder -- love that stuff for everything that requires the cocoa powder). It covered the 30 cupcakes I made with some extra--might have been more if I didn't keep eating it! Mmm ;-)

Fabulous!! I used whipping cream instead of the evaporated milk and probably doubled it..not sure. I just kept adding cream until it was fluffier and not so sweet.  Maybe next time I will try to ship half the cream and fold it in. Make sure and use cacao not cocoa. Much better flavor and you must use butter, no margarine.  This was super yummy!

As I was making this my only thought was: I hope this sifting will be worth it!  Then when I was done, my heart sank, it wouldn’t be enough.  I am trying out recipes for my daughters first birthday and the cake I baked had a peanut butter frosting, which I wanted to sub out so I gave this one a try.  We are doing Curious George, and this is the perfect monkey fur color!  I was also really happy with the coverage.  The cake was very moist and would pull up if you touched it, I thought I’d have to do a crumb layer then make more to do a finish.  Nope.  I had more then enough to cover a 9 inch round.  I probably didn’t need the second coat, but since I had enough and it was so good, I just put it on anyway.  I did add a few more teaspoons of milk to make it a bit more spreadable.

Great, as written.  no changes needed!  Makes a small batch so keep in mind for what your making it for.  It might take a double batch.

Simple foolproof recipe for frosting....nice and light and doesn't overpower the taste of the cake.  I did use a whole stick of butter and whole milk (didn't have condensed) and it still turned out really great.

My mama-in-law requested a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting for her bday. I used this recipe for the frosting, and it was a big hit with my husband’s family and my mama-in-law. I added more powdered sugar, because I felt the cocoa powder flavor was a little strong. I will definitely make this frosting again and recommend it.  I may add a little less cocoa next time though!

Came out delicious!  The only thing I did not do was measure the carnation milk. I used until it was a consistency that I like and I made a double batch. Will definitely use this recipe in the future!

I realized after I made it that I hadn't quite followed the directions, but it still turned out great.  I mixed the evaporated milk with the butter before putting in the sugar.  It had a weird consistency but once I put the sugar in it, it was fine and very good.  So even if I did it wrong, it was still good and the taste was not affected.

This is the best chocolate frosting recipe ever. I use this every single time and it's amazing. Creamy and super chocolate-y tasting- most icing recipes just taste like sugar but with this recipe you can actually taste the chocolate. I don't use the full 2 3/4 cup amount though. I start off using 1 cup and then add some more depending on how it tastes- I usually end up using about 1 1/4 cup in the end which works out perfectly.

This will be my new “go-to” chocolate frosting! It was smooth and creamy. The texture and consistency were great! The taste was fabulous!! I made the recipe as written but made 1 1/2 batch and was perfect amount to frost a triple layer 8” round cake.

I’ve been looking for the right (death by chocolate) icing for the Black Magic cake on here for a couple of years now.  This is it! To make it super chocolaty we used Hershey’s Special Dark cocoa and then substituted 1 tblsp of the condensed milk with 1 tblsp of strong brewed coffee.  It will rot your teeth, but it is soooo good!  The Chocolatiest!  (Sure that’s a word).  This is a very easy recipe to follow.  It makes a very smooth creamy frosting.  Thank you for sharing!

UPDATE:  I needed a vanilla frosting & haven’t really found one we all liked.  If you leave the cocoa out, add an additional 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and leave out about 1 tblsp of the evaporated milk - this makes a delicious vanilla buttercream frosting!

Adapted this to make a vegan frosting for the Vegan Chocolate Cake recipe on this site. Substituted vegan avocado oil “butter” and vanilla soy milk in place of the dairy. Added extra cocoa and vanilla. Delicious and velvety.

Please excuse my earlier one star rating.  That was meant for another recipe.  This is the best recipe ever and if you want coffee flavor then just add a tablespoon of strong coffee.  ????

This recipe was easy and very creamy, chocolaty and smooth. It was just not the color I was looking for. I'm looking for a darker chocolate color. This is a lighter brown.  However, it was like eating a milk chocolate candy bar..yummmy!

Love this frosting!! I make 1 and 1/2 recipes to frost the black magic cake on this site and it is my go-to special occasion cake. I’ve made it many times and it always come out perfect. I sub in regular 2% milk because that’s what I usually keep on hand and it comes out just fine.

This recipe was awesome! I used it for my chocolate cupcakes, and although chocolate on chocolate might be an overload, this wasn't! I didn't have any evaporated milk, so I substituted it for coconut milk, and it turned out awesome. Plus, it only took about 15 minutes to make, and it was extremely simple. My sister and I can't stop eating them! Great recipe, I recommend it to anyone!

Simple recipe- quite foolproof.  Produces chocolate frosting with simple ingredients in minutes.  Very simple in flavour also due to the large amount of icing sugar vs butter- just tasted like chocolatey icing sugar to me.  Will not use this recipe again

I made this exactly as written and found it to be a little too sweet.  It wasn't so sweet that I won't make it again but the second time I made it, I added 2 heaping tablespoons of cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons of milk.  The creaminess was think enough for me to decorate a 2 layer cake, although I did double the recipe to accommodate a 9" double layer cake.  My family loved this frosting.  I like more of a milk chocolate taste but will use this again with adding more cocoa powder.  I used Hershey's cocoa powder so that may have added to the reason I wasn't 100% sold on the taste.  I will be buying a better quality cocoa powder in the future for this recipe.  I used the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III recipe by Shirleyo and left a review for it as well.

This frosting is great. It tastes pretty good and except it feels like it's missing something. The consistency is great though!

This turned out rich and creamy and was a huge hit with hubby.  I didn’t have evaporated milk called for, so I substituted whole milk.  Thanks for sharing. I will be making this again.

Love this recipe!  Amazingly simple- requires ingredients that were already in the cupboard, and had a wonderful flavor! The only change was I used whole milk instead of evaporated because I didn't have any on hand. My new favorite recipe for chocolate frosting! :)

VERY disappointed in this recipe.  This frosting had absolutely NO chocolate flavor AT all.  I followed the recipe exactly and I used a very good quality cocoa powder.  The frosting did spread very easily.

Beautiful frosting. Light fluffy. Perfect sweetness. Very easy to make. Love how you can customize the level of cocoa to make more or less chocolate! I haven’t stored this yet so not sure if it sets at all but will absolutely make this again!!

Awesome! Perfectly chocolatey and easy to make. The first time I’ve made my own frosting and it turned out great. It’s thick too which I thought I’d need to fridge it to get that consistency. I recommend doubling. My allrecipe shows 12 servings. I think it will just barely cover the top of my cake, not the sides. So if you like a thicker layer of frosting, double it.

this was the first frosting I ever made at home in the First cake I've ever frosted. I use the mixer and added an extra half a stick of butter and slightly more vanilla extract to give it a creamier texture. it turned out pretty good but you have to work with it fast it starts to thick and pretty quick.

Followed the recipe to a T and it is perfect! 

It is the best recipe to pipe onto cupcakes. For cakes, I suggest making it a softer consistency as it was hard to frost a cake (the crumb part) and spread. Once is smoother, it's easier to spread and pipe onto big cakes.

This was exceptionally easy to make and tasted great. I used 1 and 1/2 times the stated quantities (with exception of subbing half & half for evaporated milk) and made recipe as given. It was perfect for a nicely frosted 9x13 sheet cake.

This frosting is absolutely PERFECT exactly as it is written!!!!! I have made it multiple times and always follow the recipe exactly (one time I was out or evaporated milk and used 2% and it worked just fine). I also was looking for a buttercream frosting (not made with shortening like so many are) and decided to use this one and omit the cocoa. I used about an extra 1/4 - 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar to make up for the missing cocoa. It worked perfect and I was able to have a buttercream frosting with the perfect consistency of the chocolate frosting recipe that I love for decorating cupcakes! :)

I made this last year, and forgot to review. I had never made chocolate frosting before, but this recipe was amazing. Because it was a last minute request, I didn’t enough cocoa powder, so half of it I used chocolate pudding powder.

This was perfect! I doubled the recipe and had more than enough to frost and fill my 8-inch layer cake. That means bonus graham cracker/frosting sandwich cookies! Yum!

The texture was good but I had to make too many changes.  It was sweet but not really a chocolate flavor.  I added 1 tblsp more of cocoa then about 1/4 cup of Nutella to make it richer.  I used cream instead of evap milk, and you always need to balance sweet with salt so I added about 1/8 tsp of salt.

This is a VERY soft frosting.  Great taste and texture IF YOUR BAKING IS KEPT IN THE FRIDGE.  This will not hold up if served or kept at room temperature.  
This is an awesome recipe and the FIRST one my husband has ever liked.  I am making it again today and I'm sure it'll be requested often.  
BUT
DON'T use it unless you can keep it refrigerated until it is served.  Serve it cold and don't  allow it to warm up or it might just slide right off your cake.

Fantastic, classic chocolate frosting.  Not too much butter, which I like.  I used 8 TBSP heavy cream instead of evaporated milk and it was silky, smooth.  Makes enough to frost a 13x9.

I couldn’t find the cocoa so I tried it make it without. And it was way too sweet. So I hunted for the cocoa and added it at the end.  It came out too powdery but hey I never made icing before so now I know. And surprisingly I am the only one who noticed or cared

The flavor is excellent.  I used milk instead of evaporated milk and this may have effected the consistency.  That being said I found it very runny and had to add more sugar.

Great recipe I’ve done it for yeaaaaaars! I always add a tablespoon of coffee and a tablespoon of milk to make it a bit creamyier. Also the addition of coffee enhances the chocolate flavor making even better! I used 2% milk because I feel terrible about throwing away the rest of the evaporated milk and it turns out great every time! People say it’s a bit bland in the reviews and I recommend adding another tablespoon of cocoa since I enjoy it a bit less sweet. Amazing recipe overall I’m going to keep using it forever!

The amount of evaporated milk was not nearly enough to thin the frosting out. i had to keep adding and adding. Also, I made 1 1/2 times the amount of frosting for a 2 layer cake and it  was barely enough. My husband liked the taste so I will make again, but will adjust the recipe on the evaporated milk and double the recipe

This recipe sounded simple enough so I gave it a shot.  First of all, it says beat ingredients... the more appropriate term would be to whip them and I did so for at least 5-10 minutes.  I did sift my powdered ingredients. but still it was very gritty.  Since this recipe is not too far off from buttercream, I decided to make some similar changes.  I added another 4 tablespoons of softened butter and I also added 2 tablespoons of heavy cream.  The added ingredients and whipping at a speed between medium and high for at least 5 minutes made it work for the time, but I'll definitely use a different recipe next time.

This is one of the best chocolate icing recipes I've ever tried! I normally don't like icing that much but this time, it was so good I literally ate some straight out of the bowl! However, I could feel the sugar in my mouth so it was a little too sugary for me. But, I would definitely make this icing again but with less sugar.

Very easy and great taste. Mine came out fluffy and soft, better for  frosting a cake (I was frosting brownies) I stuck it all in the fridge for a couple of hours, and it was fine.

Delicious. Only thing I did differently was to use 4 T. whipping cream and 2 T. 2% milk (because that's what I had on hand) instead of evaporated milk. Great taste and consistency. I printed this recipe for my book of favorites.

This has become my favorite chocolate icing recipe. I absolutely love the richness of the flavor without being overwhelmingly sweet. I use it for chocolate eclairs, as cake icing and on cupcakes. Goes with so much!

I love this recipe.  I used 2% milk and it is smooth and creamy.  I was glad to find a recipe that I had all of the ingredients already.  Try this it will be my go to recipe for now on.

I am not at all an experienced baker, but this frosting did not turn out the way I wanted. The flavor was there, but the consistency was extremely liquidy, almost like a glaze. But, it still tasted amazing. I'm sure someone more experienced would be able to pull it off.

This is the first time I've successfully made buttercream. and I think this recipe is superb. A couple things: I think if you're intimidated by making buttercream it might be smart to double the recipe. It doesn't sound like the right thing to do, but you're less likely to flood it or avalanche it with sugar if youre starting with a larger volume. Also having twice as much means you don't have to be chintzy about icing or fret that it will be enough. I did it in a stand mixer and used heavy whipping cream rather than milk. I dribbled it in mayonnaise style. It was a little tough making sure i was rationing the sugar and milk as i alternately mixed it in but as it got thicker I could see when it was sticking to the sides and pulling away from the bowl a lot (seeming dryer) or collapsing and getting kinda fappy and wet. I just made it super super slowly.  I think this recipe is really great. You basically can't overmix it i dare say. Also!! I dirbbled in the vanilla too. I don't know if it was important but i was in the mood.

I doubled the recipe and it generously frosted a 9 in 2 layer cake. I used a different filling, but would have had plenty for the center had I not.

Super good.  I used half and half instead of evaporated milk and I doubled the recipe which was more than enough for an 8in round layer cake. Next time I probably will just increase the amounts by 1.5. Delicious!

I was buying the chocolate frosting all this time but was never fully satisfied with the taste and consistency. My kids love cupcakes and chocolate cakes but the store bought icing never gave the taste I wanted. I finally tried this frosting and I couldn’t be happier !!! I substituted the evaporated milk with 7 tablespoons of whole milk for perfect consistency. The taste was as if I got it from a bakery and an instant hit with my kids !!  I am never going back !!! I would surely recommend this !!

This is the best frosting yet! It came out perfect. Very forgiving/easily adaptable. Perfect amount for a 1 layer cake. 
Next time I'll double it for a multi layer cake.

I made this frosting on top of some very delicious chocolate cupcakes!! The frosting was so good I wanted to just eat it out the bowl after I had piped it onto the cupcakes. I followed it exactly to the T and was very happy with the consistency and taste. I will be using this recipe forever!!! Loved it

I have never made frosting in my life and as simple as this recipe was I was clueless as to how to do it.  I just followed the directions and the only change I made was that it seemed that the mixture was a bit too dry so I added a smidgen more evaporated milk which made the texture absolutely perfect.  It frosted the pound cake I created so easily I was like a kid with a fun art project.  Super easy!  I frosted the cake when it was still nice and warm so maybe that helped.  Definitely will file this one away for future use!  Loved it !  Thanks!

So scrumptious, ill never by store bought frosting again! I substituted the evaporated milk with sweetened condensed milk. I had to add extra to make it creamy  enough ( about 10 Tblsp ).

I followed the recipe exact but it turned out way too runny. Still tastes good but was more of a liquid than icing. Covered the cake but went everywhere.

This is a really great go-to chocolate frosting. Super quick and easy to make and everyone loves it. The only things I do differently are I don’t use vanilla extract and I use whole milk instead of evaporated. I can taste the chocolate but not the “sweet” which I prefer.

I love this recipe!   It is my goto chocolate icing recipe....and I have tried many....but this one is by far superior (in my opinion) in consistency and flavour.  I think the evaporated milk give it just enough richness in flavour over milk.

Since we really love chocolate in our house I added an extra heaping tablespoon of cocoa. Mmmmmmm good!

I used 2% milk because I didn't want to open a whole can of evaporated milk. I added a pinch of salt to enhance keep it from being too sweet. This came out delicious. Had a great texture and wasn't overly chocolately. I would definitely make this again

Very good basic recipe. Always a hit.
I've learned that using Domino Confectioners Sugar rather than store brand makes a big difference. I've had to throw out store brand frosting because consistency was not creamy, but gritty and unspreadable.
Plus if you don't want to waste a can of evaporated milk,  just use cream, half and half, or whole milk instead. Turns out fine either way.

Really good! Added a 1 tblsp. extra cocoa but probably didn't need to... Used half and half instead of evaporated milk. Adjusted salt because we use unsalted butter. Spreads nicely, tastes good on chocolate cupcakes -- not too sweet and not super fudgy. More like milk chocolate. I had forgotten how much better home made frosting tastes than canned. This frosted a dozen regular cupcakes about 15 mini cupcakes.

This was very tasty and, yes, very creamy. It has been a long time since I've eaten store bought frosting-in-a-can, but it reminded me of the tastiest of those when well-whipped out of the can. As another reviewer suggested, I used half-and-half instead of evaporated milk, and it worked out great. I ended up using about 4.5 tbsp of the cream. The cake ("Sandy's Chocolate Cake") and frosting received numerous compliments. Note that, being an all-butter base, this isn't the best frosting to pipe with because it softens up so much under the heat of your hand and will melt in the sun.

I made this for my son's chocolate birthday cake. He requested chocolate frosting, and I really don't care for canned in the chocolate. I followed the recipe exactly as written ( I always do the first time I make something so I can review it ACCURATELY). This frosting was easy  to make, thick, creamy and just sweet enough. We all loved it! I doubled the recipe for a 2 layer 9" cake. This will be my go-to recipe for homemade chocolate frosting. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this twice (going for the third time tomorrow), using organic salted butter and a high quality, non-GMO unsweetened cocoa (Dorval), and I've had outstanding results. It's the creamiest, chocolatey-est frosting I've ever had. Simply outstanding.

I've made this frosting a couple of times. Love it! I've used evaporated milk each time. A 5 ounce (147 mL) can of evaporated milk is widely available. I double the recipe so it works out perfectly (15 mL x 10 = 150 mL *doubled). I don't have to worry about waste or storage. I'd have no qualms using a substitute if I was out of EM. I'm sure it would not take away from the texture/flavor. Tasty, easy chocolate frosting. A must try. Cheers!

It worked very well the first time I used this recipe , very creamy and delicious, and perfect for piping.The second time I used it I put in margarine instead of butter and it made a totally different texture but still delicious, seemed like it would be good for brownies .

Most frosting recipes are TOO sweet for me, so I always add  either sour Cream or Cream Cheese to the mix, and add the sugar  to suit my own taste.
Evaporated Milk? I'm not running to the store just to get a can of evaporated  milk for some recipe. Had whipping cream and mixed it with whole milk. Superb!

I used 3 TBS evaporated milk and 2 TBS simple syrup. It tasted too much like confectioners sugar. I may try a melted sugar addition next time or add more cocoa powder. Made enough for a 9 x 13 cake, and then some.

I have used this frosting recipe time and again and it's my favorite.  I  recently made a cookie cake and everyone loved this chocolate frosting on it.  I always double the recipe because the frosting never goes to waste.

Great frosting I wanted a lighter frosting and this was it. I did reduce the sugar to  2 cups and used  heavy whipping cream, didn't have evaporated. It was very light and chocolatey. It like the consistency with 2 cups of sugar I will do that again.

Shop no more for gross frosting in a plastic container that you buy at the grocery store,  This frosting is by far the best! So simple to make, creamy and perfect in flavor and texture and the ingredients are basic pantry supplies, so I already had what was needed to make it. Whipped up in a hurry and is so much better than any other frosting I've had the entire family raved! If you're frosting a 9 X 11 cake and like a thicker frosting, double the recipe; otherwise use as is and it'll still frost it just a thinner layer. SO YUMMY!! :)

Very rich frosting.  If you want a decadent frosting this is perfect.  To cover a 4 layer cake I had to double the recipe. Not the best for spreading on multiple layers, thins out quickly.          Would be good as a simple cupcake frosting.  3.5 stars.

This is a fabulous frosting recipe!  Easy and tasty!  I make a double batch. I use two sticks of salted butter, 6 cups of powder sugar sifted together with 7 or 8 tablespoons of cocoa powder. I use evaporated milk probably 12 tablespoons or so because I like frosting fluffy and softer. I think evaporated milk makes a creamier frosting if I am not making true buttercream or a fudge. It is my easy go to chocolate frosting. Frosting pairs well with Moist Chocolate Layer Cake from this site.

I added a quarter of the recipe to the initial recipe and it made exactly enough to frost and fill a double layer cake. It was super smooth, creamy  and just enough chocolate. Excellent recipe!

Really excellent. This will be my go to chocolate frosting from now on. I didn't change a thing! I ended up adding an extra 1/2 TBSP or so of milk at the end for consistency.

I followed every instruction down to the word and still couldn't use it due to the milk like consistency. I had to go and buy a basic frosting from the store since I couldn't use this. I wasted many ingredients and a lot of time. Very disappointed.

I followed the advice of a reviewer who melted the butter for a glossy effect. It didn't work for me but the frosting tasted terrific nonetheless. I used it to cover a pan of almond joy brownies.

First time I ever made frosting.  Recipe was easy to follow and icing tastes great my husband and I both enjoyed it.   Used regular 2% milk and it turned out fine.  There was a lot of icing left over for another cake.

Can anyone ever have enough chocolate?  I added an additional tablespoon of cocoa but made the recipe as directed.  I used it to wrap the sides of a German chocolate cake I made from this website and it was heaven.

I made this  to frost cupcakes for a graduation party. Everyone commented that the cupcakes looked professional and asked for the name of the bakery. Big big hit!!!  The only thing different on the recipe was  the frosting was a little thick for piping onto the cupcakes so I added a little milk and they held up very well even though it was a very hot day and the food was outside.

This was amazing! Not usually a huge fan of chocolate cake or icing but made it for my future mother-in-law's birthday with a gluten free cake mix and everyone said it was amazing! This icing is perfect as is! Very fluffy and deliciously sweet without going overboard! I'm very impressed! Will be making this a lot more in the future.

easy to make, nice chocolatey taste but a bit runny. I added more icing sugar but still found it a runny consistancy. I prefer a thicker, smoother frosting on my cakes. I'm not sure I would make this frosting again.

This was a great icing. I didn't have any evaporated milk so I used some milk and it was still great.

Was easy to make and delicious! I would recommend that if you do make this recipe that you double the ingredients for a thick icing layer on your larger cakes!

Delicious! I've tried several chocolate frosting recipes lately, and I've found this to be the perfect consistency and creaminess. Just the right amount of chocolate! I doubled the recipe to be sure to have enough to fill a double layer! Leftovers are great on graham crackers for the grandkids!

I love this frosting! I only used 2 cups of sugar as I don't like to sweet of a frosting and it was perfect. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of peppermint extract as I was looking for a chocolate mint frosting and it was so good. This is my new chocolate frosting recipe!

By miles the best chocolate frosting I've ever had.  I went a little heavy on the cocoa to thicken (instead of sugar) and WOW is this good.  I made juuuuust enough to frost and fill (albeit skimpy) my 8" layer cake.  Definitely not enough for any decorations, but cakes this good don't need to be pretty.  

I put it on the Black Magic Cake (recipe from here also) and this is easily the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten.  No other recipe ever needed again.

I have never made homemade icing before, but this was amazing, and super easy!! And I actually mixed it by hand, which was a bit of a chore, but it turned out great!! I used it to top some homemade chocolate cupcakes and there was more than enough icing for all 12.
I will definitely be making my own icing from now on!!

Considering I forgot to use room temperature butter (it was cold), it turned out really well. I didn't have evaporated milk, so I used whipping cream (and then ran out of that) and 3% milk. It's chocolatey and delicious. I will use this recipe again! Room temp. butter will make it even better next time. Definitely double the recipe if you plan to use it as filling and frosting. This was enough to cover the 4-tier 9" round cake I made (~1.75 cake mixes for the whole cake).

Made just as is- perfect for white, yellow and even a chocolate cake.  This frosting is not too much chocolate taste.  It is a smooth chocolate taste.  Try it, it's a keeper.

I made it according to the recipe, and it's terrible! I had to send my husband to the store to get frosting from a container. It's not sweet, it's gritty, and it has a strange taste to it. If your cake tastes awful, go for it, it's going to pair well. I ended up throwing it all away.

Very good frosting. Added on Tbsp of coffee and used half and half instead of evaporated milk cause I had it on hand. Doubled the recipe to frost a 9 inch round cake in the center and sides and top. Had a couple of tbsps. left which hubby promptly ate..LOL Thanks for a good recipe!

I just want to say my daughter (she's fixing to be 10) who doesn't like frosting, (I know, what kid doesn't like frosting of any kind, that's right, my picky child lol) store bought or anything that's made in a store and she loves this frosting. She wants me to use it on her birthday cake. I had no issues making it. I did use regular milk because I didn't have the can milk and it came out great. Thanks!

Very tasty frosting!  I used it to frost a single-layer 9-inch round chocolate cake I baked.  I was low on powdered sugar, so I only made a half-recipe, and it turned out to be the perfect amount for what I needed.  My only complaint was that it wasn't a particularly stiff frosting, which was what I was looking for.  I wanted to practice piping some frosting roses, but this frosting is thinner and creamier and not really meant for detailed piping (maybe more powdered sugar would have fixed that?).  Delicious nonetheless!

I never have evaporated milk so I use cream  18% or 10%.  I also use a flour sifter to put in the dry ingredients so they mix in better w no lumps.  But the recipe is basically perfect

I made this frosting for a nieces baby shower and everyone complimented me on the cake and frosting. I followed the recipe exactly, frosted the cake and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. I certainly will keep this recipe and use it again. It is very easy to work with.

This frosting is creamy and a great chocolate flavor!! The only change I made was 2% milk for the evaporated milk, since I didn't have any in the house.

I used Valrhona Cocoa Powder but changed nothing else and was thrilled with the results on a chocolate layer cake.

We made this while in a pinch for a birthday cake.
The frosting is light and fluffy like whip cream and it is sweet without being overly powerfully so. It was absolutely amazing and we will be using this recipe again!!

This was delicious!  I'm not even a frosting fan but this changed my mind!  I didn't have evaporated milk so I just used some 2% milk and it worked just fine.  This is now my go-to frosting recipe.  Everyone loved it too!

This has to be the deepest darkest chocolate buttercream I've ever made!  Very rich and creamy!  One bowl recipes with simple ingredients that I keep on hand is like hitting the jackpot for me!   I subbed heavy cream for the evaporated milk, but otherwise followed the recipe.   I used it to frost cupcakes made from another recipe on this site.  It pipes like a dream!  I will be making this again and again!

This was the best chocolate frosting I've ever had! I did make one small change... I added a few tablespoons of rich brewed coffee to my batch and it was outstanding! Sorry, I have a tendency to just 'wing it' when I make frosting and add more/less ingredients based on taste and consistency- how it looks and feels so I don't remember exactly how much coffee I added. But this recipe is definitely a keeper!!!!

I have never made homemade frosting before and I am never going to go back to store bought after trying this recipe. Only word of advice:  make it RIGHT before you need to ice something or else the frosting gets a little hard.

I had to add shortening and more powdered sugar to get it thick enough to frost the side of my cake. It was still too soft. Although it did taste good.

I only used 2 cups of confectioners sugar, and it was sweet enough. I also found that it melts rather easily, so i would recommend putting it in the fridge for about ten minutes.

Really easy and very good! I doubled the recipe for a 2-layer (2 9"cakes) and had just a bit leftover. Also, my grocery store had a small-sized can of evaporated milk that was just the right amount.

I doubled the recipe to frost 2 layer round cake. That would have put the sugar at 5 1/2 cups. I only used about 3 1/2 cups and it was still way to sweet. I used the called for amount of butter, vanilla and about 2 tbsp milk. I tried adding 4 oz. sour cream but still too sweet and not edible. The consistency was fine and there was no gritty texture. The amount of sugar made my teeth hurt. On my way to the store to get some ready-made frosting.

I made more than called for- 1 1/2 the recipe, for an 8" round layer cake, and had maybe 1/2 cup left. I used  combo of 1% milk and heavy cream in place of evaporated milk. Had a great buttery chocolate taste. This will be my go-to frosting recipe!

This was a really simple and delicious frosting. I  took a few suggestions. I melted and cooled the butter. To make it extra fudgey, I melted one square unsweetened chocolate and an extra Tablespoon of butter to this chocolate. I added that to the melted butter and mixed it well. Doubled the recipe to frost a nine inch  2 layer cake. Added a bit extra confectiooners sugar to make the consitency I wanted. Had some leftover which the grandkids just wanted to eat!

Guys, this is essentially the same recipe that's on the back of a box of Hershey's Cocoa for "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Frosting with a few tweaks to the measurements and technique. We've made the Hershey one for years and yes, it is delicious. If you had trouble with this recipe, try the one on the Hershey box. If you don't like Hershey's cocoa, substitute a different one, but still follow the same recipe.

This is my go-to frosting!  So yummy!  I use this with the recipe I found on here for Chocolate Zucchini muffins and it is probably the best cupcake I've ever eaten!  Super moist and yummy and this icing is just perfect combined with it.  My daughter also has an allergy to eggs and milk so I substitute her ingredients for this and she loves it! :)

I am not one to leave bad reviews if a recipe doesn't work out because sometimes it's just a preference thing or sometimes it's chef's error but this really is quite terrible so I am compelled to post.  First, it's WAY TOO MUCH sugar.  I am not an advanced baker so I suspect a lot of good bakers saw this recipe and moved on immediately which may be why there aren't worse reviews. It is sickening sweet.  That I can fix by adding this and that but I can not get it to not be gritty.  You need more cream - butter or butter and cream cheese.   I am shocked it's reviewed so highly.  Sorry to the nice person that posted this.

Really tasty as-is, although maybe a little sweet for me; no avoiding that. The consistency was good. The only problem is the quantity. I had a recipe for 2-dozen cupcakes; I barely managed to thinly frost all of them. I would say that this recipe could generously frost 12 cupcakes, and you may want to double it for any more.

Great / easy recipe! Added 1/4 tsp. salt (my preference) and used skim milk (starting with 4T to determine the consistency I wanted).

This was an easy and delicious frosting for my 12 cupcakes, from Simple 'N' Delicious Chocolate Cake, also from this site.  I was generous with the frosting and had a bit leftover.  I used a scant 4 TBS milk instead of evaporated milk, and honestly, the frosting was rich enough with this sub.  Thanks for posting!

Pretty good icing. Way to sweet for me though. If anyone is making this for the first time. Just add a cup of sugar at a time to get your preferred sweetness. As another commenter said I used 2% milk instead of opening a full can of condensed milk. Worked perfectly.

I have made this frosting several times and it was so easy to make! I love it because it NOT as rich as some of these reciepes. 

I got my daughter in law to make it and she has NEVER made homemade frosting before and she said it was so easy a child could make it!! She said she will NEVER buy ready made frosting again !!

I didn't have any canned frosting but had everything I needed on hand to make this for my yellow cake.  Duh!  Why didn't I do this before.  Great tasting frosting and easy to make.  I did use whole milk because I didn't want to open a can of milk just for this.  Smooth spreading and just the right amount for a 9 x 13 cake. Plenty of chocolate taste without being overpowering.  Four stars only because I am waiting to see if the family likes it as much as I do.

After searching for a frosting recipe that wasn't too complicated, I came across this one. I adjusted the servings amount to 14 so that I'd have enough to ice a 9-inch layer cake. The end result was very creamy and had a rich flavor. It wasn't overly sweet. After adjusting the servings, however, I only used 3 cups of sugar and 1/3 cup of milk of the amounts listed for 14 servings. I can tell from the finished product that it would have been too dry or too runny if I had used the full amounts of either. I like a thick, rich frosting, but if you prefer something with a thinner chocolate flavor, you may want to use the full amounts. When mixing the frosting, I added a cup of the sugar/cocoa mixture at a time and beat it with an electric mixer until smooth before adding more. One minor issue is that I found a few tiny lumps of butter in the finished frosting, so I would recommend using whipped, spreadable butter instead of regular butter (I used stick butter and let it soften at room temperature). I don't bake often, but if I ever want a good and easy chocolate frosting again, I'll come back to this recipe. The end result has a slight bitterness to it that makes it taste like real chocolate was used to make it instead of cocoa powder. If you like a sweeter frosting, you can use less cocoa powder. My tip: use a little less than the recommended amounts of sugar and cocoa, and after sifting together, lick your finger and get a little on the end; taste it and adjust the amount of sug

Excellent!!!!!  Made this today for chocolate cupcakes.  It was enough to frost 22 cupcakes!  Smooth, creamy and very easy to spread.  Nice, sweet chocolate flavor, but not overly sweet like the store bought brands.  This will be my new chocolate frosting.  I made it EXACTLY as the recipe was written.  No need to change a thing!!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

My sister made this recipe for her daughter's birthday cupcakes.  Since I had the privilege of frosting the cupcakes for her, and since I got to taste it too (licking fingers counts before spreading it counts too!), I'm able to review it just before I hit the kitchen to go and make some to have on hand.  This frosting was so creamy it was almost like a whipped cream frosting. It was extremely easy to spread, and the perfect consistency for piping onto cupcakes. It was not at all runny, and it had just the right amount of chocolate.  I've been making another chocolate frosting for years, which I also like, but it's nice to have another.

Very creamy. I substituted the vanilla for 1/4 tsp. Almond Extract which made the chocolate flavor a little less strong.

Chocolate buttercream perfection. Perfectly balanced. Very light chocolate and creamy. UPDATE: Having made this over and over now it is my staple chocolate buttercream frosting. Having just made it to frost David's yellow cake recipe (which is outstanding) I have decided if I am going to use this to fill the middle layer I should double this or at least half extra. I like having to have enough frosting where I don't have to meticulously spread the frosting so as not to disturb the crumbs. I just want to plop a generous amount on and spread. For that, more is needed. This is the best universal chocolate frosting. REally and truly!

I made this frosting on a whim. It took me a fair amount of time given the fact I had to do it all by hand (poor me). The kids love it and like it myself. Very simple, staple ingredients, and good flavor give this frosting 2 thumbs up!

Absolutely amazing! This is exactly the chocolate frosting I've been looking for.  Followed the recipe to a tee, and it turned out perfect.  After making this twice now, there is no way I can ever go back to store-bought chocolate frosting.  Following the recipe as is allowed me to frost a single-layer cake with maybe 1/2 cup of frosting left over.  For a double-layer cake, I would double this recipe.

Right, I used this recipe as a guide to making chocolate icing. I only used 1 cup of icing sugar and found it sweet enough, any more and it would have been over the top! I also used 2%milk but only 4 Tablespoons, threw in a dash of salt to balance the sweetness.  I kept the rest of the ingredients as is. I'm rating my version a 5 star for my future reference.

Good! I would consider this a "kid friendly" chocolate frosting. pretty sweet but not as bad as the grocery store frosting by a long shot. Myself, I would  typically go for one that's darker or maybe more like a cream cheese frosting BUT, this is exactly what I was looking for. I didn't have evaporated milk so used half and half. Added a pinch of salt as mentioned in some reviews. It went up a level after I added the Vanilla - I almost forgot it but don't make that mistake! It really makes the recipe.

I have always made homemade cakes with store bought frosting.  My father has his 84th birthday coming up and he prefers homemade EVERYTHING, so I decided to give making homemade frosting a try before his birthday.  It was a hit with my  11 year old extremely picky son, my friend, and her 7 year old very picky daughter.  I took it a step father and added some peppermint extract which I used on cupcakes with crushed peppermints on top.  That was an even bigger hit.  Now they are hoping I can figure out how to make chocolate peppermint candy for Christmas.

Followed recipe exactly and it did not taste good at all!  Very disappointed considering the great reviews. Ended up frosting my cake with store bought frosting.  Will try other recipes from this site in hopes of finding a good homemade frosting.

Per another reviewer, I doubled the recipe to frost 24 cupcakes. The amount of frosting gave the perfect amount for piping a generous amount on each cupcake. I paired it with King Arthur flour Favorite Fudge Birthday Cake ( but in cupcake form) and they paired up beautifully.  I used regular Hershey unsweetened cocoa but next time I will use Hershey special dark cocoa.. even with regular, the frosting was chocolate lay, creamy, delicious! This will be my "go to" chocolate buttercream frosting. It is going to make me look like a rock star at work tomorrow. ;)

When you double the recipe, a 5oz can of evaporated milk is the exact amount of milk you need.

I needed to frost a cake I made, and with no time to go to the store, I discovered that someone in the house pilfered the store-bought frosting. Ack! I had everything on hand but the milk to make this, so I simply used water. Turned out completely fine! I did add a bit of extra butter to compensate. Super easy, and a happy accident. I prefer this to store-bought, and it will get used again :-)

Thr recipe was super quick and tasty! I halved the recipe and it was the perfect amount of frosting for 21 large cupcakes. I followed the recipe to a "t" and it was perfect. Everyone at my husbands party loved them and they were gone fast.

Loved this recipe. I didn't have any evaporated milk and just used heavy whipping cream and then stored them on the fridge when not out. Would recommend this frosting to anyone who loves chocolate!

I wish I read more of the negative reviews. I agree that this frosting was way too sweet. I let my toddler son whip the butter but when I tried to add the sugar-cocoa powder mixture in, I had to turn off the heaters because it seemed to dry. The milk helped but I really should have cut down on the confectioner sugar. It was just too sweet for my taste. My kids and in-laws liked it, but they LOVE store bought icing (which I feel is too sweet as well). I will try a different recipe next time. Update- I made this again w my son. I cut down the sugar to little less than 2 cups. Much better. It was more than enough for a 9x13 cake.

I've made this with both evaporated milk and 2% milk. It's totally awesome with 2% milk but insanely amazing with evaporated milk if you have some. 
I've used this frosting on cakes and cupcakes. It holds rainbow sprinkles really well. Love this recipe. 
Why the heck would you buy premade icing when you can make this stuff in 5 mins.

Frosting was good, but too sweet for us.  Is there anything I can use to replace confectioners sugar and evaporated milk.  I was thinking about replacing it with coconut sugar. Any ideas?

This tastes delicious but it does run a little liquidy. If you plan on using it for cakes make sure you add more powdered sugar than milk.

This turned out great. I doubled the recipe to completely frost a two layer cake, and had a bit of frosting left over. And I quickly discovered why it's important to mix the sugar mixture and milk in matching portions - otherwise you'll wind up choking in a dust storm of powdered sugar when you crank up the blender.

Great, smoothe, and tasty! I did slightly heaping Tablespoons of cocoa powder, used salted butter, and used about 5-6 Tablespoons of 1% milk instead of evaporated. I tasted it before spreading and it was yummy! Cheaper than store bought and no nasty chemicals. I frosted the top of a 9x13 and have about 3/5 of a cup of frosting left, so it would have been perfect if I wanted to frost the sides too.

A very easy and quite forgiving recipe, since I forgot and creamed all the wet ingredients together and it still turned out wonderful. Also, I was in a hurry and used heavy cream as I didn't have evaporated milk.  Oh was it yummy and the perfect consistency.

As directed, this recipe is a little runny. The second time I made it, I used about 3 1/2 tbsp of the evaporated milk. Came out great. I will need to make a second batch for my double layer cake.

I just finished making the icing waiting for cake to finish cooling.  I made a box cake mix but tweaked both the cake and the icing with coconut oil.  I used the whole amount of the oil called for in the cake mix- with coconut oil and made the frosting using 2 Tbs. of coconut oil plus the rest of what the recipe calls for in butter.   The frosting is superb.  I've done this with other cakes so I know the frosting will only compliment the cake without being overpowering.  This recipe is a keeper (even without my revisions) so thank you very much for sharing.
P.S.  The icing didn't hold up well using the coconut oil, the taste of the cake and icing is out-of-sight though!

Made according to recipe.  Very good.  
The only change I would make next time
is adding a little more cocoa or adding a 
small amount of dark chocolate cocoa 
just to give it a more deeper flavor.

I cannot say enough about this recipe!  I made it to frost a 9 x 13 organic white cake I had made, and it was fantastic!  The only change I made was to use half-and-half instead of the canned milk because I didn't have any.  I mixed it all up with my mixer and it was so light and fluffy.  I did add about two additional tablespoons of cocoa powder to cut the sweetness a little and a dash of salt for balance.  Best frosting I have ever made.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Good, basic chocolate frosting. I also used 2% milk instead of evaporated. Don't skip sifting together the flour and cocoa powder- I did and mine turned out with tiny lumps of cocoa. My own fault for trying not to get an extra bowl dirty!

It was amazing!  I ended up adding 1/3  to the recipe and it was a perfect amount for a 2 layer 9inch cake. Definitely one of  the best chocolate frosting recipes I've made.

This recipe is amazing.  Works perfectly.  Is simple.  Tastes amazing.  We used Hershey's unsweetened cocoa and a generic low fat evaporated milk.  I didn't use any vanilla and the flavour was great - probably would be even better with vanilla.  At first, it seems unlikely that the creamed butter can absorb all of the powdered sugar, but it does!  Also, I used an electric hand mixer and that worked well.  Was perfect and now I'll use this recipe every time I need frosting.

This is basically buttercream frosting. I tripled this recipe to frost a three layer cake. I added two pinches of kosher salt. 
My daughter-in-law and daughter loved this frosting.

This was really wonderful icing! I didn't use evaporated milk, because, like other reviewers I did not want to open a can for that many tablespoons. It's a great consistency and it isn't too sweet. I was looking for an icing that wasn't a fudge icing, but more of a fluffy and chocolatey one. Super great and very tasty!

very yummy and easy! I used half & half because I didn't have evaporated milk on hand. It did come out grainy however because I ground the powdered sugar in my blender and it didn't come out as smooth. This recipe doesn't make a lot. I barely had enough to scrape over a two-layer cake. I would recommend doubling it.

Outstanding! This is wonderful! I followed the recipe to a T, then taste tested it, It was  a tiny bit sugary still, so I added another  splash of evaporated milk to it, whipped it up some more and was in Heaven! I HAD to put it on the cake so I would stop "taste testing" well, and we were out of spoons at that point! LOVE THIS!  thank you for sharing your recipe.

Perfect recipe. Added a little shortening to it to make it even fluffier. If it's done right the recipe is great! I've been baking for many years and this chocolate icing recipe is one of my favorites.

I've never liked homemade frosting before and in the past when I've tried making it, it was so bad that I had to go to the store to buy the canned stuff. This recipe is amazing! It's easy, quick and tastes great! I doubled the recipe to frost a double layer 9x13" white cake (not fill). I will definitely be making this recipe again. Thank you

Excellent frosting. I stuck to the recipe and it was the perfect amount to cover the top of a 9x13 butter yellow cake that I had made for my girlfriend. I may not have gotten to try the cake but this frosting was delicious and I found myself trying it a lot during the making process. Will make again!

I substituted 2% milk and it worked great. I was frosting a two-layer, 7" cake so doubled the 12-serving recipe. 18 servings would have been better - had frosting left over. Stuck it in the fridge, and later tasted it and realized it was just like the frosting on Berger Cookies from Baltimore. Now going to make the cookie bases and put this on to recreate these wonderful cookies from back home.

This frosting turned out perfectly!  I doubled it since I was making a 9 inch with three tall layers and wanted some leftover to decorate. The frosting was so smooth and was just the right consistency to frost and decorate.

I made this to frost chocolate cupcakes for my daughter's class.  It turned out great! It was delicious, creamy and not too overly sweet.  I frosted a dozen cupcakes and had some left over, so it might frost 24.  Will definitely make again!

Frosting turned out great even though somehow I skipped a step.  I didn't sift the cocoa and sugar!  I was afraid it was coming out a little lumpy, but the lumps disappeared as I was whipping the frosting.  It was a life saver because I had run out of store bought frosting for a chocolate cake, but this was sooo much better!  I had plenty of frosting to frost my cake with these measurements.  I will use again and this time I won't sift! Seems like a step you can skip if everything came out this great.   It was very easy to make and I didn't make any changes to the recipe (except for sifting).

It's yummy and easy to make but it came out a little grainy for me. I think it's because I didn't add the milk until after the end.

I just halved this and made it because I'm pregnant and wanted to eat some frosting. What? Anyway, so delicious and it's the perfect consistency. I did not have any evaporated milk so I used some half n half. I'm sure the evaporated would add to the flavor profile but whatever.

I am a pastry chef and I'm always looking for a good chocolate icing formula. first time trying this one awesome results not too sweet, smooth and very creamy.  I used fat free lactaid milk  had to double the recipe for three layer cake but came out perfect . Just finished baking this just something to do.

This frosting was amazing!! It easily frosted (18) 2" square brownies but there wasn't any remaining. It was piped on so it was pretty thick. I only had almond milk instead of the evaporated. I found that I only used about 4TBSP of it and added a little extra powdered sugar and cocoa to get the perfect piping consistency. The flavor was amazing. I made them for an adoption shower and everyone was raving about it. The new mama asked for the recipe!! :-)

Super easy, and I had everything on hand. Doubt I'll buy pre-made chocolate frosting again!  I did add a pinch of salt to it - I like how a bit of salt can take the sweet edge off of something so rich.

I made this using 1% milk because it all that I had,  and this still came out perfect. The creaminess and chocolate flavor is right on point. The ratio seems just right.

I had to add lots of extra sugar to get anything approaching a frosting (vs. thick glaze). Ended up adding more cocoa as the chocolate taste is too subtle. Won't be making this again.

I made this frosting for my daughter's birthday cup cakes. All the kids thoroughly enjoyed it. It frosted 18 cupcakes. I only suggest going easy on the vanilla extract. I'll make this again.

I followed the directions but perhaps melted the butter too much? I ended up with a clumpy mix. In an act of desperation, I added about a quarter cup of milk. Voila! Fixed. The end result tasted great and worked well with my pastry bag to decorate a cake.

Please, readers, if you're going to frost a cake or cupcakes with chocolate icing, take the time to make this frosting homemade instead of using a pre-made canned icing.

The flavor is remarkable.  Not too sweet, and not over-the-top rich either.  It is just right.   

Only drawback:  made it exactlly to recipe and it was not quite thick enough for a frosting.  UPDATE:  I have made this five times now, and have figured it out.  Use 1/2 of a 5-oz can of evaporated milk, instead of the entire can.  This gives the frosting a much better spreading consistency. 

I combined three top-rated recipes from this site:  one for a choc cake, this frosting, and a choc glaze.  The result is a chocolate cake unbelievably moist, sent into orbit by this frosting, and capped with a glaze which makes this combo an absolute keeper.    Enjoy!

I don't bake often but I knew I may have a couple hours free and my husbands birthday coming up so I decided I'd try it. Followed the recipe proportions exactly though I doubled it for a 9" round layer cake, with 4 tbsp salted butter and 8 tbsp unsalted butter (both at room temp) since I wasn't quite sure which to use. It tasted delicious  (as I was icing it ;) ) and very chocolatey! Much better than the jar! Thank you to all the reviews saying to double it!

I tired this recipe on a surprise birthday cake for my wife. I grabbed the wrong can of milk in the pantry. I used sweetened condensed milk. Trust me, I had know idea what I was doing, and that there was a difference between evaporated and sweet condensed. My wife loved the frosting! This recipe is so flawless, it makes innocent mix ups taste good!

Wow - so yum. This is not a dark chocolate icing, it's a more mild chocolate. I add this comment because my kids don't like dark chocolate yumminess (WTH - I know, right?). I would recommend sifting the powdered sugar - it does make it more consistent and creamy. This also pipes great! I will certainly use this going forward. I made no changes, except added a wee bit more milk to get the consistency I wanted. Thank you for sharing!

Very nice. I used it on the Banana Chocolate Chip Cake on this site. Make sure you beat the (unsalted) butter for 3 to 5 minutes for extra fluffy frosting.

Awesome, great, amazing. Really easy to make. Tastes great & really chocolaty. I doubled the recipe to frost a 3 layer 9 inch cake & had a little left over. I also had about 1/8 cup left of the condensed milk. I was happy with the consistency.

It was very sweet and very buttery. I suggest using less confectioners sugar and a little less butter. I ended up having to add a little bit more cocoa powder to mine and other than that I found it very good

yummy. those who gave this a poor review didn't make it according to the recipe. I made this for a friend's bday. I am not a fan of frosting (usually) but I'm eating the leftovers with a spoon.

Omg this frosting is divine! Sooo light & fluffy. I made it for a quick cake & didn't have milk on hand so I used softened vanilla ice cream instead & a lil less sugar so it wasn't too sweet YUMM! will be using again

At first it failed the fingertip taste test, thought it was a bit grainy. But after putting it on the cake and eating it a few hours later it was perfect on the cake. Maybe the butter needed time to meld with sugar/cocoa. Made with http://allrecipes.com/recipe/17981/one-bowl-chocolate-cake-iii/. This combo is a one two punch of chocolatey knockout goodness:)

I had to make a birthday cake for my husband in a hurry after his weekend project became "our " weekend project.  I  had planned on making a black walnut cake with a white whipped cream frosting but running to the store for heavy cream was out so, I had to go to plan B with what I had on hand.  I made  the cake with a regular yellow butter cake mix. I added an extra egg to the mix.  I added 2 ounces of  very finely chopped black walnuts to the batter. I found this Chocolate buttercream recipe and I had all the ingredients on hand so I was in business.  I'm glad that I checked the reviews and saw the suggestion to double the  recipe.  At 2 3/4 cups of confectioners sugar, I thought it would make alot but it probably wouldn't have been enough.  I was constructing a 6 inch  three layer cake. I had plenty to frost with and had about  3/4 of a cup left over.  The frosting was great! It went really well with the black walnut flavor.

Made it just as written, turned out great!  As another reviewer suggested, I increased the recipe by 50% (so 18 servings), and frosted a 9 inch layer cake with a bit to spare.

Excellent and easy.  This is the go-to for my chocolate loving partner's birthday cake these days.  I've tried several recipes now and he's been luke warm to them, but this one got rave reviews from him.  It's the one he's been looking for.  Now, if only I could find the correct recipe with OJ in the choco frosting like his Mom used to make....  I've tried a couple of those, but they just haven't quite made it to "Mom" level yet.  This one, however, does.  When I get that compliment, I know I've found the right recipe, and this one does it for a buttercream chocolate.

I have made this a couple of times and it turned out great. I used a whisk attachment on the mixer and whipped it for a couple of minutes on high speed to fluff it up some. It seemed just abut the perfect amount for a two layer round cake.

This is the best EVER!!! This is the only chocolate frosting I use. I do a 1.5 batch to frost a 2 layer 9" round cake and it is the perfect amount. It has such a good flavor and texture. Don't skip the sifting step! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Mmmmmm.

It was pretty runny for cake decorating using a frosting tip. I'm going to refrigerate  it for a little bit to see if it thickens.

As simple and delicious as it gets! I used 2% milk and margarine as that's what I had on hand. Perfect texture and rich flavor. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

Very good frosting. Make sure the bowl you make in is a large one, or else , you will have powdered sugar and coco powder all over you and your kitchen..:-) I scaled the recipe to 18 servings, 1 1/2 the recipe amount, to fill and frost a 9 inch layered cake and it was plenty. If you plan to make a lot of decorating roses with it you would need to double the recipe.
The frosting felt little hard when I was beating it so I added little bit more milk.

Made this tonight when I realized I didn't have enough icing for my daughter's birthday cake and cupcakes for school tomorrow (later this morning.) I made it as written with the exception of subbing 2% milk for the evaporated milk because I didn't have any on hand. Creamy, amazing chocolate flavor., and super easy to make! Perfect 10.

Perfect chocolate frosting. Not too dense yet plenty chocolatey. I doubled the recipe to frost a 2-layer 8" cake. I had extra leftover but a single batch would not have been enough to do the middle and outside. It goes well on the chocolate cake II recipe from this site.

This was decent frosting. I recommend using salted butter or add a pinch of salt or I don't think if would taste good. I made this twice: first following exactly (except added salt): flavor was good but it was very loose. It lost shape after piping. Next time I made it I substitutes 2 Tbs of butter for 2 Tbs of the milk and it was a much better consistency.

AWESOME recipe! I didn't have evaporated milk, so I used some 2% milk, as suggested by some reviewers. I also used less sugar: about one cup. It was whipped together quickly, and is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe!

Excellent - will be using this recipe over and over again. I did make a couple of changes - used 1tbsp margarine and the rest shortening. Also used whole milk instead of evaporated. Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe!

Used cream instead of evaporated milk because I have an open carton. It turned out fabulous. Strong cocoa/chocolate flavor, not too sweet. Moderately stiff, definitely not runny. 

I figured out why people have had fails with this recipe: if you're making frosting, use butter NOT MARGARINE- unless the recipe specifically calls for margarine. They are NOT the same thing because the butter substitutes contain WATER which melts the sugar and makes it runny. Also, confectioner's sugar is another name for powdered sugar, not the stuff you put in your coffee. Anyway, you'll get good results if you use the stuff named in the recipe. :)

While my frosting came out a bit gritty (my fault) I found this to be a good recipe. It has a good consistency for piping without chilling it, and the flavor wasn't too strong. I substituted the vanilla for coffee extract and it tasted quite good. It made enough to frost 14 cupcakes generously.

This is an amazing recipe! I have made it a couple time now and each time is is a success! i did half it and halved it again and it was still great! just be mindful when adding the evaporated milk. put in either 1/2 or 1 tsp at a time until you have your desired consistency.

It came out  great, it's simple, easy to make, I didn't follow the exact way it said to combine everything.  It works well both ways, but i prefer to do all wet together then add the dry, and it's works great that way.

Very, very good.  I didn't have any evaporated milk, so I used heavy cream.  I wonder if the 1 star reviewer used condensed milk in her batch.

Yikes. This is a very sweet frosting. I used heavy cream (unsweetened) instead of condensed milk to cut down on the sugar, and was still too sweet.

This is a really easy frosting to make. I used it under fondant and it was so plyable and easy to work with. It made the edges super flat so the fondant was flat. I added extra suger to make it more stiff but i absolutely love thos recipe!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out quite good. Since we all have different tastes in how strong or subtle we like our chocolate, I read through the board posts and incorporated some of the variations people used. So I added a bit more of the unsweetened cocoa for thickness as suggested by one reviewer, and then added salt to draw out the rich chocolate flavor as mentioned by another individual. Thanks for the suggestions! Oh, and one more thing...it was my first time using a sifter. By the time I was done, my work space looked like a cocaine lab. I'm pretty sure I was not using the sifter properly.

If you add two more tablespoons of butter and a bit more sugar and milk, it makes plenty to fill and ice a two layer cake. I also substituted whipping cream for evaporated milk. Still delicious!!

Awesome. I have no complaints. I did however, add an additional 1/4 sp of cocoa, and an additional drop of milk to give it a richer chocolaty taste and to maintain it's creamy consistency. The end result was awesome.

Excellent chocolate frosting! I cut the recipe in half for an 8x8 brownie pan and only used 3 tablespoons of 2% milk for something a little thicker. A touch of caramel syrup and a dash of salt made the perfect frosting!

Tastes delicious! If I'm piping 24 cupcakes I make 2.5 times the amount of icing. I used regular 1% milk (what I had on hand) and ended up using 5 or 6 1/2 tablespoons so that the frosting would keep it's shape. The first time I made it, the frosting lost it's shape!

I have tried a number of frosting recipes and this is by far the best if you love creamy chocolate frosting! The trick is to use room temperature butter and cream it really well. Try not to rush it. I blend the butter in the mixer for about 5 minutes on medium to medium high. Slowing and a little at a time add the dry ingredients alternating with the evaporated milk. I use almost a whole 5 oz can of evaporated milk so none goes to waste. With some patience this will come out delicious and everyone will love it! I double the recipe for a 9-inch two-layer round cake.

This is my favorite icing out there. I usually have to double recipe for a batch of cupcakes, but that leaves a little bit extra for taste testing!

Smooth and great taste. I didn't have evaporated milk, so I used whipping cream instead and added a few extra tablespoons. Whipped it until light and fluffy. It made for a great texture.

Love this recipe. I could eat this with a spoon. This was Plan B after my tricky ganache recipe tanked and I didn't want to go to the store for replacement ingredients. It fills a cereal bowl to about 2/3 so it's not enough for a double layer or anything beyond a thin coat of frosting. I used Ghiradelli 100% unsweetened cocoa and sweet unsalted Land O'Lakes butter. I also partially melted the butter to make the process easier.

Great chocolate frosting! It was my first time making homemade frosting and it turned out perfect. I used 2% milk in place of evaporated milk as a suggestion from another review. This will be my go-to frosting!

I have made this recipe 3 times now. I use soy milk instead of evaporated milk. My kids love it. It's the only frosting I'm allowed to make.

Delicious and easy. I used whipping cream instead of evaporated milk because I had some to use up. I added two pinches of salt and thickened with a tablespoon of cocoa instead of icing sugar. Even picky husband loved it!

I think this may just be the creamiest chocolate frosting I've ever made.  The secret ingredient is the evaporated milk.  The original recipe made frosting that was a little dry and stuff, but adding a few more tablespoons of evaporated milk made it incredibly creamy.  That, and I beat the heck out of it.

Definitely will make this again....it is delicious and SO easy.  I followed the recipe exactly and it made enough to frost a 13x9 sheet cake.  So double the recipe if you are making a layered cake.

This was by far the best chocolate frosting I've ever had. Light, fluffy, and creamy just like they said. The only thing I added was a pinch of salt (to tone down the richness) and a heaping spoonful of peanut butter. My husband loved it which makes it  a hit in my house!!

Fantastic filling for a layer cake and a wonderful cupcake icing. I wouldn't use it for a full cake but I prefer a denser icing for that. Mixes up nice and light. I did use 2% milk rather than evaporated milk and it turned out great

This is good for kids. I've had much better frosting recipes than this though. I guess I should have figured it out by the recipe but this frosting is more sweet than creamy. I prefer a creamier frosting. It does have a nice texture.

Amazing! I needed a quick and tasty chocolate frosting for a German Chocolate cake and this did the trick and more. I used 1% organic milk since that was all I had but other than that, I followed the recipe to the T!!!! And I did add an extra tablespoon of cocoa to give a little ump!!!

Great texture and flavor - a nice alternate to the usual buttercream (which I still adore).  I did bump the servings up to 20 and still didn't have enough to frost 2 nine inch cake layers, including filling,  I do like a good amount of frosting on my cake so next time I will definitely double serving amount - maybe even go a little over double.  I also froze the remainder of my evaporated milk in an ice tray for future recipes.

The texture was great- it was easy to spread and looked shiny and nice.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the flavor of this frosting.  I think the evaporated milk gives it that "canned frosting" flavor.  I won't use this recipe again.

I added a little bit more evaporated milk than the recipe calls for because I like to have a smooth and creamy frosting. I also think that it goes great with a vanilla cupcake.

Great recipe! Tried it out the other night on a test cake, and loved it! But the thing is, I could instantly taste the cavities. Today on the other hand, I had to make a little extra for a birthday cake, and was actually half a cup short on the confectioners sugar. So I thought to put in an extra half cup of cocoa to balance out the dry-wet ratio. All I can say is that it went from a great recipe to a perfect one after that simple change, in my opinion.

Really great chocolate frosting, and true to it's name! It's creamy chocolatey goodness. I used it to top Banana Cake VI, also from this site. It was the perfect amount to frost a 13 x 9 cake.

This is the first time I have ever attempted to make my own frosting. This recipe is quick and easy. I would definitely make this again. I too used 2% milk in the recipe because I didn't have the evaporated milk. Frosting is still creamy, chocolaty and rich. My husband will love it! Thank you.

Just what I was looking for to frost a tray of brownies.  I did not have evaporated milk, but I noticed from the other reviews that some people substituted 2% milk, some used half & half, someone used heavy cream... and still gave high ratings.  I had none of those either, but I decided the type of dairy must not be essential so I used what I had, which was non-dairy creamer.  It was really really  good.  I do want to try it with evaporated milk next time, just to see if that raises it to an even higher level

This recipe is overall easy and delicious! At first I was bit worried that I did the recipe wrong because It was a bit runny. But after leaving It out for A couple of minute it got thicker and was in a spreadable consistency :)

As the recipe is written, it was not quite flavorful enough for my taste. I prefer a sweeter flavor and more chocolate flavor. If I try it again, the cocoa and sugar will be amped up a bit.

This was the third time I had made a homemade frosting. This was by far my families favourite out of the three! Delicious! Better than any store bought chocolate frosting by far! Easy to make, even easier to eat. This is my new go to chocolate frosting. Awesome recipe!

I really liked this recipe. It was very simple to make. I used skim milk instead of evaporated because like another user said "didn't want to open a can for that small amount". It was very tasty. Will definately use again.

Very good frosting! Super easy to make and it came out great. I didn't have to change anything. At first it seems too soft and I was worried it wouldn't stay on the cupcakes but it stayed perfectly and it set up quickly. It's a rare frosting that still has a sheen, even when set. Thanks so much!

This is a great recipe, it tastes good, is easy to make and doesn't take much to make. I dont understand how it could get any bad reviews. The only ways I could see that it wouldn't turn out good is not mixing it good enough, or putting it on something that is even a little bit warm. If your looking for a chocolate icing recipe this is it, I've made it many times since finding it.

I have made this several times and it's great. It also is a very versatile recipe. I've made it as is, I've made it adding a 1/2 Tablespoon of instant coffee. Have substituted the evaporated milk with sour cream. Have used almond extract in place of vanilla. All turned out really good!

Having not read the reviews beforehand, I'm surprised to see others thought it lacking in chocolate flavor.  I found it absolutely delicious and plenty chocolatey!  I substituted half and half for the evaporated milk (since I had none on hand) and it was perfectly smooth and creamy and was easy to pipe onto my filled cupcakes.  Next time I will certainly double the batch and I was short on frosting just 24 cupcakes with the recipe as written.

Perfect, perfect perfect chocolate frosting recipe. I added a touch more confectioners sugar to make the frosting a little more stiff, as I was piping it onto my cupcakes, but other than that, didn't change a thing. My batch frosted about 15 cupcakes.

Good frosting but a little too sweet for my taste.  I increased the servings to 16 and used the frosting to frost the tops of two 8x8 cakes.  I used Earth Balance in place of butter and soy milk instead of evaporated milk to make the frosting non-dairy.  I reduced the confectioner's sugar to 3 cups and added the soy milk one tablespoon at a time to get the consistency I wanted -- the frosting was a tad too thick with 4 tbsp but a little too runny with 5 tbsp of soy milk -- I'm guessing 4 tbsp and 1 tsp would be about right.  If you want a recipe with a higher cocoa powder to confectioner's sugar ratio, you may want to try the frosting from the Extreme Chocolate Cake recipe (the cake is very good too).

I'm not a huge chocolate frosting lover but this turned out fabulous... Very rich and creamy and the recipe made more than enough to frost the top of an 8 x 13 crazy cake (recipe from this site... Which is also delicious!).  I used 1% milk because that's what I had on hand and it worked great.

Very tasty, but not ideal for a smooth iced cake. It leaves air bubbles and is hard to get completely smooth.

I assembled the recipe a little different than it said to do.  I mixed together the butter and cocoa powder until creamy, then added in 4 tbls heavy whipping cream instead of canned milk, mixed that together, and then I started adding in the powdered sugar.  I only add in enough sugar until it's sweet enough for my taste.  I rarely add in the full amount most frosting recipes call for.  It turned out good and chocolately, but certainly wouldn't frost a double layer cake.  Fortunately, I'm making a bunny cake for Easter and I've got peanut butter frosting, (recipe from this site) which will be the bunny's main color, with chocolate frosting dots.  It'll work out perfectly.  Good recipe!  Thanks!

I tried it and it was great! I did use half and half because I had it already, and just added it as I whipped to get the right consistency.  I made it for a Super Bowl party for a football cake and it got rave reviews. I wish I had some now!  Thanks for my new Go To frosting recipe!

Best and easiest chocolate icing I have ever made,  I have done hundreds of cakes and I usually stay away from chocolate frosting, they all were to fake tasting, I didn't like them.  This one is a keeper and easier to do in minutes.

I have never had any luck with frosting.  for some reason I always end up with weird frosting, adding more of one thing or another trying to get it to come out right.  this recipe is so easy I made it with my kids and ended up with creamy, chocolatey frosting.  Doubled the recipe and frosted 30 cupcakes with leftover.  We did not change anything about the recipe except for doubling it.

I hadn't made frosting before. Needed something quick. So easy & tasted just sweet & chocolate enough for brownies. May make a double batch next time to give a thick cover.

Yum, yum, yum! I made this frosting for my son's 2 year old mini cake and he loved it and so did we! I used whole milk instead of condensed milk and it was still great! Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is foolproof and delicious.  Tonight we didn't have cocoa powder or evaporated milk, so we used coffee creamer and hot chocolate powder and it was still amazing!!!!  What a fantastic frosting!

1 whole stick of unsalted Butter
5 Tbl of half and half
5+ Tbl of Dark Chocolate baking Powder
2 cups of fresh ground raw sugar, powdered it myself
1 or slightly less tea spoons of Vanilla
 and a pinch of salt
   It is Fantastic, it is creamy and very yummy

Used full cream milk instead of evaporated milk. Just prepared half of this recipe. It's good for a dozen of cupcakes. It was sweet and buttery so will make some modifications the next time I make one.-Kiss

Wow, I thought this frosting was really good! I listened to another reviewer and used milk (almond milk), instead of opening a can of evaporated milk. I also used dark chocolate cocoa powder. I was really impressed by this recipe. Easy and yummy!

Smooth and creamy goodness!  This is my new "signature" chocolate frosting.  From reviews added a pinch of salt, melted the butter and used half and half.  Simply perfect.

I thought this was pretty good. I used heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk. I felt like it was really dry so I had to add more milk than called for. I would make this again!

This is perfect!  I make 2-tier cakes with a whole cake mix per tier, and it takes double this recipe for the whole thing.  But it's light, fluffy, delicious, and pretty much fool-proof! :) Than you!

Really delicious and easy to make. I used it for my son's first birthday cake and he really went to town on it so I think we can say it was a hit. :) And everyone else at the party seemed to like the cupcakes too. Paired with this white cake: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/simple-white-cake/detail.aspx
Thanks for the recipe, will definitely use again.

So yummy!  I used heavy whipping cream though I was out of milk and anything else. Still came out amazing! I followed the recipe as is apart from the milk substitute. I added more cocoa powder instead of sugar to get the consistency I wanted. So delicious! Chocolaty !

I thought this frosting was really easy to make, and tasted great.  The only thing I did extra was add one 8 oz container of cool whip.

Halved the ingredients and was more than plenty for covering the top of the cake with some left over. Even made with full fat milk, this was scrummy. Can't imagine how good it is with condensed milk!! Easy, foolproof recipe.

Extremely easy and delicious.  Used milk instead of evaporated milk.  Frosting had a tendency to slide off cupcake when eating it though.  So maybe try a little less milk or a tablespoon more of cocoa.

Perfect frosting! The consistency is perfect.  I defintitely had enough frosting to cover a 2 layer 9 in cake and even had a litte extra leftover.  This frosting tastes and looks just like the kind you'd find on a cake ordered from a bakery or grocery store.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I used whole milk in place of the evaporated milk.  I would make this again for sure.  The recipe frosts approximately 14-15 cupcakes.

This was a great recipe. It was VERY creamy! I added a little less than 6 tbs of evaporated milk at it turned out to be the perfect consistency. My whole family loved it and it tasted great. 5 star!

Great frosting, VERY easy. Don't change a thing! To fill my 6qt mixer, I can make 5x the original recipe and it makes the frosting smoother and less air-bubbly.

This was one of the best frosting I have made. Next time I would reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup and I added 1/2 tsp instant coffee and 1/4 tsp salt. The flavor was elivated.. Yum. Sure a keeper.  I took the advice of one of the reviews to add milk instead of evaporated milk.. It works like magic

Excellent recipe.  Very easy to whip up and the flavor was outstanding.  I didn't have any condensed milk, but had a little heavy cream left over from another recipe, so used that.  The frosting was very creamy and easy to spread.

I reduced the sugar to 200gr (half) and instead of the milk I used cream to correct the consistency of the buttercream. It turned out sweet enough (for me) and was great to put on my chocolate cupcakes.
But its better to put sugar/cacao-mix at 2 times, then adjust the consistency and then the rest.

I added a bit more sugar as well - was looking for something a little stiffer to frost cupcakes, but had a nice dark color and delicious flavor.

Just made this to frost my Chocolate Truffle cake.  I gave it 4 stars because it was Really, Really sugary sweet with a harsh edge to the cocoa flavor.  Too sugary, said my KIDS, lol, so you know it's pretty sweet!  I used cream instead of evaporated milk, and real butter because it's simply the Best flavor out there!  Next time I will use a bit less powdered sugar and add a pinch or two of salt to cut the sweetness, and add more vanilla to mellow it out a bit more.  Oh, and I doubled the recipe to frost my 13 x 9 cake and it made a LOT - there was more frosting than cake in the pan, lol!

I had to use heavy whipping cream because I didn't have the canned milk, but other than that, or in spite of it, it's great and enough to frost a 9 inch round, single layer cake. In spite of the sugar, it actually wasn't overly sweet to me, but kind of has a mocha flavor. I think I'm done with canned frosting. THANKS!

I hate when you get all your ingrediants in the bowl and realize the milk has expired.... I got butter,vanilla, sugar, & cocoa in the bowl and found the milk was expired.  Just before i paniced I saw my husbands coffee creamer "Sweet Cream" so I did the only I could, I used his creamer....OMG I will NEVER use store frosting again...This was SO easy and OMG is it ever good.  Oh BTW i just eyed the amount of ingrediances... LOVE IT!!!!  Thanks for sharing Sandy

Best chocolate frosting ever.  Creamy, chocolaty - exactly what a frosting should be.  I will use this again and again.  I'm so glad I found it.

This frosting was awesome!  My husband is a chocoholic and I wanted a good chocolate frosting for his chocolate birthday cake.  This was excellent!  We all loved it!  We frosted a small 9 X 9 cake and had some leftovers.

I doubled this recipe. Beware if you double, you won't need as much evaporated milk. I had to add more sugar and cocoa. It was creamy and smooth. I couldn't stop sticking my finger in the frosting. It was great with the "Black Magic" chocolate cake.

Really tasty, but the frosting was sort of runny for me. Granted, I used vanilla soy milk so maybe that had something to do with it. Either way, the flavor was great.

Super easy to make, delish, and wonderful looking on vanilla cupcakes!

UPDATE:

Made this frosting for the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III recipe also found on this site. These two recipes were made for each other!!!!!

This is the recipe to use for brownies, cupcakes, and cakes. i found this recipe for cupcakes for fathers day and it is short, simple, and satisfying! It tastes like chocolate and it looks great! i used a open star tip to put some roses on (my first time ever using a bag and a tip!) and they looked great and tasted even better! the only thing i have to say is make sure you sift it so then it will be creamier and better looking!!! From now on this is the recipe I'm using!

This is the most delicious frosting I have ever tried. I made it last night and had to log on to give it five stars. I love chocolate so I have tried many different frostings and this is by far the most delicious! It was quick and easy to make. I would recommend doubling the recipe. This will be my go to chocolate frosting from now on!

Loved this recipe! Melted the butter instead of creaming it. Used 1% milk instead of evaporated milk. Loved the consistence of the frosting. Poured it on the brownies and some of it soaked into the brownies by the time they were eaten. It was a big hit!

I really liked it. It was so rich and very chocolately but for my taste too sweet. I'm definately making this frosting again but with less sugar.

This frosting is very good. It has a great spreading consistency. I did double the recipe to frost a two layer 9 inch cake and I also used milk instead of evaporated milk.

I really like this recipe.  I will definitely make it again and again.  The only changes I made was using light cream instead evaporated milk (not on hand) and a little bit more cocoa to the recipe.  It was not sugary sweet and super creamy.  It was used on brownies and it was a hit.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe, I melted the butter like another review requested, to put the frosting on brownies. And it was FANTASTIC!!!! Everybody loved  them!  Also, I didn't have evaporated milk at the time, so I used half and half and it worked just fine. This is the second time I used this recipe, (brownies) I used it a different time with cupcakes, without melting the butter, and they also were really great! I am definitely going to use this recipe when I want chocolate frosting!!

I altered the recipe a bit and got excellent results.

2 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
6 tbsp cocoa powder
6 tbsp butter (light)
2 tbsp whole milk
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

I generously frosted 12 cupcakes and had some left over.  My five year old and two year old approve!

I tried this, and found it to be way too sweet. To counter the  sweetness I added a brick of cream cheese and about 6 oz of cool whip turning into whipped cream frosting. It came out amazing, but made it more of a milk chocolate frosting.  And the cool whip gave it a wonderfully creamy texture. It spread on the cake like warm butter.

Amazing!  This was the first chocolate frosting I've ever made and I picked it because of the other reviews and I'm really glad I did.  My husband, who has a sweet tooth, and can be a good judge of flavor, said it was delicious!  I did have to go back and make a second batch so I'd have enough to frost my two dozen cupcakes.  Whipping up the second batch was even faster than the first time, though, and its so amazing, I dont care.  My son's 3rd BD party is tomorrow and I'm sure people won't believe that I made this, hehe :)  Thanks for sharing!

Smooth, creamy, and delicious. I whipped it longer to use as a filling with my leopard sponge cake, and it was absolutely perfect!

Absolutely the best frosting I have tasted. I normally cannot stomach frosting as it always seems to be too sweet or too rich. This frosting is amazing! I frosted vegan cupcakes with it and I could not be more pleased with the outcome. I've been raving about it since I finished baking!

Very good! I didn't spend time sifting the powdered sugar and cocoa (just whisked it a little). It got rave reviews.

This recipe makes a LOVELY frosting!  I followed it exactly except I doubled it for a 2 layer 9" cake.  I read some of the reviews and was glad I did this.  I wanted to make sure I had enough to generously frost the whole cake and I did with a tiny bit to spare.  I don't think it would have been enough if I hadn't.  However sifting that much sugar and cocoa was not fun! LOL. After sifting 2 cups worth I decided I was DONE and just left the rest unsifted.  Fortunately it didn't seem to have any effect.  The frosting came out so fluffy and creamy, but also a little on the thicker side, perfect for frosting a layer cake.  And the taste was delicious!  Not too sweet and just the right amount of chocolate flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

I ended up having to triple the cocoa before I could gain approval from the taste testers.  Once I got it to that level, they seemed to love it. I love that it's not from a can!

I didn't think that I could ever be surprised at how tasty a homemade chocolate frosting could be.  I'm just going to tell you that after frosting my cupcakes, I put the leftover frosting in a storage bowl in the fridge, took it out the next day and ate it like pudding. Yeah, it's that good!

This frosting is wonderful.  I replaced 1 tbsp of the butter with shortening just to keep it a bit softer than standard buttercream, but keep it tasting how it's supposed to.  Turned out great!

The consistency isn't quite what I had hoped for, it was more like an icing instead of a frosting, but, in all fairness, I did use 2% milk instead of evaporated, and margarine instead of butter (it is all I had on both). This improved, though, by just adding a little more confectioners sugar. And the taste... better than I had hoped!!

Just tried it tonight to top a 2 layer 9" box chocolate cake. It was just barely enough to cover the whole cake, but then I did put a little in the middle to help hold the banana slices in place. The consistency was very sturdy, I used 3 T. of half-n-half as I don't tend to carry Evaporated milk in the house. I probably could have added just a tad more half-n-half to make the spreading easier. I didn't sift my sugar and used 7 T. of cocoa powder as I wanted a more chocolate taste. It is a very subtle chocolate taste, very sweet for my taste, but tasty. Don't know how one can make this runny! I made it while boiling chicken in my kitchen and it was getting warm and the frosting was fine. I didn't even use my Kitchen Aid, just a regular beater.

This is a good basic recipe that can be dressed up easily. I wanted to make coconut flavored frosting but didn't have any coconut flavoring. I replaced it with coconut oil and it was great. I also didn't have evaporated milk. I used a little less than what was called for since the coconut oil is more wet and it worked perfectly.

Great recipe! Creamy & not 'gritty' at all, as some powdered sugar recipes can be. I used half & half instead of the evap. milk. Perfect amount for 9 X 9 cake (1 layer).

Delicious frosting recipe!! I didn't quite have enough confectioners' sugar, so I adjusted the other ingredients to adjust for this.ex: only 4 tbsp. of cocoa, and 4 tbsp. of butter. I also used half and half cream instead of evaporated milk, and it turned out really nice. Easy to spread, and nice chocolate flavor. Excellent on brownies.

I've finally found my new frosting recipe!  I've tried so many recipes for a good buttercream frosting and this is the winner.  It's so smooth!  It's adaptable, too because if it's too thick or thin, you can just add milk or more sugar accordingly.

Delicious frosting that is soft and somewhat fluffy. We frosted the top of the cake only and filled the center (two layer 9" round)  and it was just enough.

This frosting is delicious. I didn't have evaporated milk, so I used whole milk. It worked very well. Very creamy and chocolately.

This will be my staple recipe for choc frosting.  I had to add a little more milk than the recipe called for as it was too stiff.  I also found I need to increase the recipe by about 1/4 to a 1/3 in order to frost a 9" layer cake.  This is a great frosting, if I had one criticism it would be that I would like it just a tad sweeter.  I used it on a box german choc cake mix and it was very good.

Just when I thought all chocolate buttercream frosting is the same I discovered this one.  Made exactly as directed & it is the best I've ever tried!

My first time ever attempting home made frosting.  I had to use a little more sugar because it wasn't sweet enough... almost bitter.   I used the electric mixer and fluffed it up, it was perfect!  Everyone loved it!

I love this frosting! It was perfect for the single layer (round 8") birthday cake I made for my husband's birthday. Maybe slightly too much frosting for a cake that small, but I just smeared it on extra thick, which was a good thing because it is so yummy! I used skim milk since that's all I had, but I don't think it affected the quality at all.

Nothing special.  Tasted fine, but I was looking for something really special an really creamy.  Seemed pretty sweet and a little too heavy for me, however, it worked fine for frosting a cake.

This recipe is awesome and turned out higher than my expecations!!  Its important that the butter is room temperature and that you beat it alone first before adding any other ingredients.  It also makes a world of difference if you use a high-quality cocoa powder.  I used regular milk instead of evaporated and it still turned out great!! AMAZING and better than store bought!!

Piece of cake to make (no pun intended).  I literally don't think I'll buy frosting again. I only had 3tbsp cocoa left so I made a half batch and it still was okay in my kitchenaid mixer.  Made according to directions.  Just great!

This was really yummy!!! The only thing is that i had to double the recipe to make it frost the whole cake. But it was very good. I will use this recipe again. I used 2% milk instead of evaporated milk also. And it worked fine.

I've used a similar recipe before (on the back of hershey's cocoa box) and it is really good!  You can substitute milk or half and half for the evaporated milk...or at least I used milk...came out fine.  I doubled the recipe as I wanted enough for cupcakes, that I decorated as little turkeys for my daughters friends. I ended up with a bit extra I might use on brownies for a party next weekend.  It was a big hit with the kids!  My sister even asked if I made my cupcakes from scratch because it was so good!

Easy to make and tastes GREAT!  Why buy frosting when you can make it this good?  I made it exactly as specified, except I forgot to sift.  It still turned out smooth.  Delicious.

Easy and delicious.  I cut the recipe to 8 servings and it made the perfect amount to decorate a round cookie cake.  I used 2% milk instead of evaporated because that's what I had on hand.

This was really good.  For some of the unsweetened cocoa powder, I used 'black cocoa' to make it super dark and chocolatey for Halloween cupcakes.  I didn't want to open a can of evaporated milk so used what I had on hand - 1/2 heavy cream 1/2 skim milk -  and it still turned out great.

I, not too brightly, packed up my kitchen first while moving. This recipe is so quick and easy I was able to make it without my mixer (a very tired arm though) so great for beginning bakers. That said we like a lot of frosting on cupcakes and my kids (9,7 &2) left half of the frosting on the plate. It's delicious but too rich even for kids in cupcake levels. But this recipe is amazing so I'm saving it for brownies

I hate when people change something about the recipe and say "it was awesome, but I didn't make THIS recipe..." and here I'm going to do exactly that! Such a hypocrite. I followed other tips and used regular milk, used half margarine and half shortening (plain, not butter flavored), put a dash of salt, didn't bother sifting anything, and it was AMAZING! Great balance of flavors.  Works well between graham crackers- frosts well over 5 sleeves (leave in fridge overnight to soften crackers and stiffen up the frosting, voila! 1 sleeve makes 9 half-sheet sandwiches, in the morning drizzle with melted chocolate chips and quickly add birthday sprinkles for oodles of toddler smiles).

Loved it! I made this chocolate frosting for some chocolate cupcakes. I loved it so much that I also used the base for cinnamon vanilla frosting that I used to top some pumpkin cupcakes. Then to top them off I sprinkled them with chopped pecans.

Excellent recipe.  I used water instead of evaporated milk, as I was out of non-dairy choices like almond milk.  It still came out great.  Handheld mixer fluffed it up nicely.  It was light but had a nice body for use on cupcakes.  Single batch covered 18 cupcakes easily (with about 2/3 cup extra).

I used this recipe for bake sale cupcakes that i piped on.. .it was PERFECT! I i cut the vanilla in half and added almond exct in its place, gave it a very nice flavor. I used a few of the tips from other reviews and used cocoa to thicken it.. it was PERFECT, i will be saving this and using it as my go to frosting.

Best chocolate frosting ever! It is very rich which is why I only use this cupcakes or other small desserts. If you use this frosting for cakes (adjustable portions), too big of a serving leaves people thinking the chocolate flavor is "too" rich or sweet. This recipe is perfect for small desserts and tastes like a luxurious treat from an upscale bakery.

Unfortunately I didn't have condensed milk so tried using regular milk, but it wasn't getting the right consistency. Luckily I had cream cheese in the fridge and that popped it right up and made it even richer and creamer, especially after I added more cocoa! I want to try it again with the condensed milk and see if that improves the consistency enough to where I won't need the cream cheese. One thing I did like about the recipe was how easy it was  :-)!

i just finished making my first ever chocolate frosting! made 1.5 the serving. so chocolatey! one thing i regret though was putting the rest of the evaporated milk in even though i feel that the frosting is already thick enough. it is still okay but i'm just afraid that it will melt as i will be travelling around 30 minutes to 1 hour with the cake. next time i'll use less milk. but this recipe is definitely a keeper! thanks a lot! =D

The frosting tastes fine, but is really more of a glaze. It was also not nearly enough to frost a cake, despite being very runny. I ended up almost doubling the dry ingredients so that I would have enough, and so that it was stiff enough to actually constitute frosting.

I make this frosting a lot because we can't stomach the store bought stuff anymore.  The only thing I do differently is mix the cocoa with the butter first then alternate the powdered sugar and milk. Of course I use regular milk and it turns out great every time.

Simply good recipe. I did use half and half since that's what I had. I wanted to pipe on cake and this was easy to adjust the consistency for decorating. I did triple the recipe to make sure I had enough for filling frosting and decorating and 9in double layer cake. Used on Black Magic cake from this site. Everyone loved it.

Tried it with whole milk straight out of the fridge, worked amazingly.  Make sure to alter milk to mixture ratio exactly as the directions say.  PERFECTO!

This was amazingly good. I did use lowfat milk rather than evaporated milk but it was still very good. I actually made this frosting to mix in with my chocolate cake crumbs to make moist cake pops. They turned out fantastic with this frosting! Best part about this frosting: NO EGGS!

Perfect! I made this exactly as given in recipe, and with only a TBSP more powdered sugar, consistency was creamy and absolutely devine! Sweet but not overly sweet, chocolaty, my new go-to frosting!

Nice basic frosting recipe. Not super super sweet, but still pretty sweet, I prefer something less sweet but this is a nice neutral ground to go by. It turned out smooth and easy to spread on the cake. I made a batch and a half of this to cover a double layer 9 inch cake, I had a little left over but I'm not sure if one batch would have done it.

So easy to put together. I just tossed it all in the bowl at the same time and mixed it. The longer you beat it, the fluffier it gets.  I usually have most of the ingredients already in the kitchen. Taste so much better than the stuff you get in the can at the store. Fam loves it.

Simply put. One of the best chocolate frosting recipes I've ever tried. A big hit with the entire extended family and at birthday parties. You can't go wrong. I use regular milk to the consistency that I need for spreading.

SO delicious! I had to add a couple of extra tablespoons milk, but it came out so smooth and creamy. My husband grew up on box cakes and cans of icing. So for his birthday this year, he requested a yellow cake with chocolate frosting, like his Mom used to make. I can tolerate box cake but canned icing... I love my husband, but that is pushing it. This icing was a hit, though. My husband said he said the cake mix in the pantry, but didn't see the icing, and was kind of annoyed. Then he tasted the first slice of cake, and said "Wow, this frosting is way better." :)

This is a great recipe, I didn't have evaporated milk so I used plain milk and didn't put in the 6 tablespoons that it called for, and it was wonderful.

I have made this recipe twice. Once exactly as written and it was good. I am not one who is going to say it was the best chocolate icing I ever had, but it is a very easy to make recipe and it does come out very creamy. The second time I made it I used more cocoa (thought it was too sweet the first time), used whole milk, (I didn't have evaporated), and did not sift the flour and cocoa. Not sifting did not seem to have any effect on the smoothness or creaminess of this icing. This is a keeper, that is for sure.

This will now be my go-to chocolate frosting. I have never been good at making frosting, but hate buying the stuff in a can, but now I have an easy chocolate recipe! I also used whole milk in place of the evaporated milk. I found it hard to spread (as did my three-year-old) so we ended up adding a splash of extra milk at the end, which helped the consistency and also made a nice sheen. I made 1.5 x this recipe, and it was just enough to frost and fill a double-layer 9" round cake. Thanks!

I replaced 3/4 cup powdered sugar with Ghirardelli cocoa mix... The taste was excellent, but the texture quite grainy. It was probably the cocoa mix (although the mix is a powder). I read other reviews of it being grainy, though. It's so easy that it's worth another shot.

Usually use canned frosting (convenience) but was out, so I tried this. Original recipe says 12 servings, based on other reviews saying it was a little "skimpy," I changed it to 14 for a little extra. Well, the original is probably plenty for a 13 x 9 sheet cake, unless you just really like a LOT of frosting. Used exact ingredients listed except I forgot to add vanilla...operator error. This was great tasting, creamy, I used real salted butter plus a dash extra salt and I could taste that buttery flavor. Loved it, hubby raved about it!

I really liked this frosting recipe. I altered it just a bit though. I used the recipe's amount of sugar, cocoa, butter, and vanilla, but I just used regular whole milk instead of evaporated and it worked just fine. After the frosting was finished, I folded in about 1/2 cup of cool whip to lighten the frosting and smoothen it out. It was extremely flavorful and rich, but only 4 stars because it was a bit thick, and a tiny bit grainy. I will use it again though.

This is the best chocolate frosting recipe I have ever tried! I used a little more powdered sugar with a touch more evaporated milk because... Well... It helps to stretch the $ instead of having to make another batch. This frosting tasted suspiciously similar to that of a local bakery I love called Merits (I think this recipe may have cracked the mystery!) Yay!

This is a great recipe. I made it exactly as shown and used salted butter since it didn't specify. I used an extra tsp on evaporated milk to get the consistancy I was looking for. The consistancy is nice for decorating and hold us well! Thanks for sharing. My daughter says she loves it, I think this will be my new go to recipe for chocolate frosting!

Everything perfect about this, from the consistency to the flavor.  The only sub I made was skim milk for evaporated.

I decided to try this recipe after the last chocolate frosting recipe I had bookmarked somehow disappeared and I couldn't find it again.
This frosting tastes just like the chocolate version of "Special Buttercream Frosting" also from this site, which I love so dearly, but never have full cream on hand to make it more. I did use 2% milk instead of evaporated, but it still turned out great. Not too sweet, just the right amount of chocolate (Though if you wanted a dark chocolate, just add more cocoa), and it's very light and fluffy. This recipe will now replace my former recipe, but I feel it's even better.

Doubled it to frost two 9 inch layer cakes and it was just the right amount to frost and fill.  Used a mixture of skim milk and half n half instead of using the evaporated milk and it came out beautifully.  Easy to substitute.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderfully light and fluffly frosting! My family loved it. Not sickly sweet either.  I used half and half instead of the canned milk.

Fabulous! I doubled the recipe, but only had 6 tbsp cocoa powder, so I added two 1 oz squares of baking chocolate (melted) to my creamed butter. I had to add an extra 1/4-1/2 cup of powdered sugar to adjust for the added fat in the baker's chocolate, but that was no big deal. Super rich, creamy, and divine! Definitely a keeper!!

This frosting was good, and I like that I was able to use just regular milk instead of evaporated milk since I didn't have any at the time.

I have tried so many chocolate frosting recipes and this is definitely the best one yet!!!! I had to tweak it a little beacuse I live at altitude, but it came out perfect. Spreadable and so tasty without being too buttery or heavy. Excellent!!!! :)

This frosting was great. I added a little heavy whipping cream towards the end of mixing, it was really thick. It probably wasn't necessary but I like heavy cream. I will be using this again.

I am giving this 5 stars because it is the recipe that was on the back of the C&H powdered sugar box for over 60 years.   They have modified it to use whole milk instead of evaporated .   But this is it.  The original proportions use more butter and sugar so it makes more.  This is the best recipe.  Use it and modify it to suit your taste.  You cannot go wrong.  The trick is to use real butter and pure cane sugar.

This will be my go to Chocolate frosting. I doubled the recipe because I was making my son a pirate ship cake and didn't want to run out. I ended up with just under two cups left over which was fine with us. By the way, if you do have leftovers, if you warm it up it makes an amazing hot fudge sauce for ice cream. Definatly spent a couple of nights eating cake scraps from carving a pirate ship with warmed up frosting and ice cream

Loved the frosting, very easy to make.  I adding some kosher salt to add a little extra something at the end.  Before that, it tasted a little overly sweet.

after spending so much time sifting 5.5 cups of powdered sugar, the frosting came out not thick enough at all. I added more sugar and a pinch of cream of tartar and it didn't help. I just don't think that much milk belongs in frosting. So disappointing!!!

From everyone else's 5 star ratings, I thought this would be a lovely chocolate frosting perfect to top some cupcakes with.  I found this to be an underwhelming recipe.  It did not taste nicely of chocolate and had only the overwhelming taste of powdered sugar, even after I nearly doubled the amount of cocoa.  The texture of the frosting was also strange; strangely dense even as I tried in vain to make it "light and fluffy."  I will not make this again.

The frosting came out perfectly! As per the recipe I adjusted the amount of evaporated milk used. I ended up using 6 tablespoons opposed to 5 in order to get the frosting consistency that I wanted. Everyone loved it - will use again!

I am a cooking beginner and this was easily made even with my 2yr old helping(he couldnt stop taste testing, it was so good). I tasted the frosting before adding the vanilla extract and then after, I think it has a better chocolate taste with out the vanilla, so next time I'm leaving it out. I added extra cocoa powder to bring back more of the chocolate flavor. We frosted cupcakes and injected some with the frosting..sooo yummy! My husband took the cupcakes that we frosted to work and everyone loved them! Thanks for a GREAT tasting reciepe!

I'm the original poster of this recipe, and am very happy to hear that so many fellow AllRecipes.com fans have enjoyed it for their own celebrations. I submitted it under my (then) married name and former account, so in the years since, I've had no idea it was popular. My mom, Barbara Early, from whom I'd gotten this recipe years ago, would be very pleased (and no doubt, stunned). Enjoy :-).

This is seriously the greatest choc frosting recipe I've ever made! The recipes I usually use always taste way too much like powdered sugar, but this one was so smooth and creamy, you could barely taste it. This is definitely a keeper!

basic, easy, simple as pie. i added a bit more salt, a bit more cocoa, and a bit more vanilla, because i'm kind of kamikaze that way, but the texture was perfect, the taste was perfect, the recipe made a lot, and everybody who tried it, loved it.

Made this last night, and it turned out great. Plenty of icing to generously cover 24 regular cupcakes. I used a whole stick of butter and just a splash more evaporated milk.

Thanks so much for this recipe!For some reason I battle with chocolate frosting. Really frustrating as it's not a fraction as hard as some recipes I make. This recipe worked like a charm. I made as stated - just used skim milk as that was all I had on hand and added a tablespoon of extra cocoa - but that was personal taste - it tasted great with amount in the recipe too.

I made this for a quick batch of yellow cupcakes and it was super quick and easy.  I thought the frosting tasted prominently of cocoa and wasn't overly sweet.  Hubby thought it was very sweet, but liked it fine on the cupcakes.  A single batch of frosting would probably frost 3 dozen cupcakes.  I only did a dozen and the rest is in the fridge still in the piping bag.  I saw someone used it on brownies and I'm thinking of doing that in a few days. This will be my go-to chocolate frosting, for taste, quick and easy to put together and super easy to work with.

Crazy addictive!  This frosting is amazing, and I even forgot to put in the vanilla.  I also used homogenized milk instead of evaporated milk.  So good!

Fantastic! There was one reviewer who only gave this recipe one star and had terrible results. I don't know how she messed it up. I lost track of how much powdered sugar I had measured and so I had to wing it - it was still great! I had been making Italian Buttercream before I found this recipe, but I won't bother anymore.

Wish it wasn't as good as what it is. So after making a double batch for a 3 layer cake I had some left over. I ended up spreading it over graham crackers and eating them sandwich-style! Heaven :) Then, my son had an epiphany...why didn't we put the graham cracker sandwiches in the freezer for several hours! Oh my, they were so good...not to mention the cake. Fabulous icing recipe. No comparison to store-bought. This is my go-to recipe, in fact, I'm waiting for some cupcakes to cool right now so I can frost them for my son's school bake sale.

This is a fantastic recipe. Very quick and easy to make. This recipe will only frost about 12 cupcakes, so you may want to double the recipe if you're needing to frost more than that. I did replace the evaporated milk with coconut milk because I had made some chocolate coconut cupcakes. It turned out great!

I love this! It's my new go-to chocolate icing recipe. I mixed mine with a stand mixer and it came out rather runny which was great to pour over the cake as it was then somewhat absorbed into the cake and added to the moistness. I didn't have evaportated milk so I used water and that may be why it was runny, but I have to say, it tasted delicious!

This made a beautiful light whipped icing, and I had more than enough to ice my cake.  The recipe needed to be altered to use skim milk, and due to consistency I needed about 6-6.5 tbsp of skim milk to accommodate for the difference from the condensed milk.  Will definitely be making it again for cupcakes when I bake for my son's school.

My daughter-in-law called to see if I had any ready made chocolate frosting since she had made cupcakes for her family and discovered she had no frosting. I told her I would find a recipe and make some. This was the first recipe I read. It looked so easy and had great reviews so I gave it a try. It was very easy and also delicious. Thank you very much.

This recipe was great. I had to use regular milk instead of evaporated milk as I did not have any. It still came out great. I am not sure what evaporated milk adds to the taste or texture. This recipe is a keeper!

Easy, cheap, yummy, not too sweet. I didn't add all of the milk so that it would be stiff enough to pipe onto cupcakes, and it worked beautifully. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Fantastic recipe. I made one batch and it iced 12 cupcakes perfectly. I was able to pipe the icing generously. I watched  the video and read lots of reviews. I followed the video exactly but added a little extra evaporated milk, about 1/2 tbsp. overly consistency and has a nice shine after piping. Highly recommend and will make again. Nice and chocolately as is, and I am a chocoholic.

This recipe turned out great!  I did add a little extra cocoa (1/2 tablespoon.  The icing was a bit runny when I went to put it on the cake so I added about a 1/4 cup more powdered sugar.  After the few adjustments (which happen with most recipes), the icing was perfect.  Nobody could believe it was homemade!  Give it a try :D

Hmmm something is not right...in order for mine to stay stiff enough and not be liquid was to keep it cold. I am giving it three stars because it taste good, even adding 4 more tablespoons of cocoa powder did not help with the melting mess.

A good frosting but I thought it was missing something. It might of been because I forgot about the vanilla and mixed it in with a spoon last minute. Will def try again and might add some melted milk chocolate in with it as well.

Yummo!  Great compliment to Simple and Delicious Chocolate Cake!  My only change was using whole milk in place of the evaporated.  Made enough to frost 12 cupcakes.

Wow!! I just made this frosting and it is perfect! I did replace the butter with vegetable shortening, but I'm sure it would be just as good, if not better with butter. The ingredient measurements were spot on and created a wonderful fluffy consistency. Just make sure to beat the butter (or shortening) really thoroughly before adding the other ingredients.  I doubled this recipe and frosted the middle, top, and sides of a 2 layer cake. Try this recipe!!!

Doubled the recipe for 24 cupcakes and used more cocoa powder than called for to thicken it so the peaks stayed formed when I piped it. Yummy and beautiful!

This frosting is very creamy, perfect sweetness and light.  As the other reviewers suggested, I used 2% skim milk instead of the evaporated.  Simple recipe and the results are wonderful. Previous reviewers who claimed thier frosting turned out lumpy probably did not sift their sugar and cocoa.   I will use this recipe in the future!

This icing had a very strong and over powering chocolate taste. The consistency was rather lumpy. I would suggest a different recipe.

Not at all sweet and very very thick. If you make this adding a bit of milk ( regular, not evaporated ) helps. I added about 1/4 cup and it made it creamier and sweeter.

Recipe is good although my husband said for him there wasnt enough chocolate flavor or color. It comes out a mocha color. But for me it was good and my 13 yr old loved licking the bowl. Had i not ran out of my gihardli(sp) Im sure it would have been even better. I doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough to do a 9X13 cake double stacked and I had plenty to cover the cake.

Super-duper good! I used ghirardelli baking cocoa, and I think it makes a difference. I also only used skim milk rather than evaporated, and it turned out GREAT. The BEST frosting I've ever tasted, and the first time I ever made my own frosting!

Yum. I probably could have substituted regular milk or cream for the evaporated milk. Just because now I have an entire can of open evaporated milk.

Oh my, this is wonderful!  Very, very sweet.  I added probably another Tablespoon of the evap milk to get the frosting to the consistency that I wanted.  It was just barely enough to frost two loaf cakes (middles too).

I substituted 1% milk for the evaporated and added a shot of chocolate liqueur for good measure and it still came out quite tasty. I will definitely make this one again.

This was great frosting! I have never made homemade chocolate frosting before. It was a special request from my Mom for her birthday and it was a huge hit! They all thought it was the best frosting ever. My Mom especially loved it, she doesn't like overly sweet things. I didn't change a thing. I did have to double it, the first batch wasn't enough to cover 12 cupcakes.

I usually use good ol' betty crocker pre-made icings, but I don't think I'll ever go back! This icing is nice and easy to make. I followed the recipe and it turned out great! My whole family is in love - The only ingredient that I added was a tiny bit of salt!

I thought this was very nice, but somehow I can't quite give it a perfect 5 stars. I'm not sure I've ever made frosting from scratch before. The yield was a lot - I frosted (not very heavily) two dozen cupcakes, and still had some left, so I bought a small angel-food cake at the grocery store and frosted most of that. The consistency was nice, but I can't quite describe what's "missing" in the flavor of the frosting. Maybe I need to make other recipes in order to compare....

Absolutely delicious! It will be my go to chocolate frosting from now on. I saw that someone who reviewed said it wasn't very chocolatey, and I completely disagree! The chocolate flavor is quite strong, and the proportion of chocolate to butter and sugar is perfect. Some frostings end up too sweet, but not this one! It's sweet without being cloying. I definitely recommend it!

This chocolate frosting is PERFECT.  I also added 1 cup of cocoa powder, as suggested by other reviews, and it was delicious.  I think the evaporated milk is the secret and will now use it in all my frosting.

Excellent recipe! Very easy to make and it tastes great! I usually stick to my chocolate buttercream recipe, but this one is great! It was just the right consistency and it wasnt too sweet or too bland. I will definitely be using this recipe again! *If you have problems with your consistency you can lessen the amount of butter you use. I only had enough for 4 and a half table spoons and the icing turned out nice thick and whippy.

Wonderful Frosting!!  I used 2% milk because that's all I had, turned out so good!!  I believe it's very important to use real butter, not margarine and make sure your powdered sugar & cocoa are fresh.  Yummy!  Very tasty & easy frosting.  Thanks for sharing!

This frosting was the easiest to spread out of every frosting I've ever made.  Not one crumb was pulled into the frosting as I spread it on the cake.  I added coconut flavouring for a different touch.

This is the only chocolate frosting I'll ever use.  I also just use regular milk and it turns out fine.  I always use high quality cocoa (Penzey's unsweetened; not Dutch processed) and high quality vanilla (Penzey's double strength Mexican Vanilla or Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste).  It makes enought frosting for my cupcakes (24-36) but not enough to frost a 2 layer round cake. You'd need to double it for that.  Delicious!

This frosty is soooo tasty, I'm a great cook but my baking isn't as great and my family loved this! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was a bit thin, however it is very possible i put too much milk too fast or something. I will be using it again!!

This is THE BEST chocolate frosting I have ever made. I'm usually in a rush and I'll buy a can of the stuff at the store--never again! This was so easy! My grandmother makes her own and it's so good, I just knew it had to be difficult to make. She told me what to do and I searched online and this recipe is pretty much what she told me to do right down to the T. I did use a whole small bag of confectioners sugar to sweeten it to my taste and about 2 teaspoons of vanilla. I just put small dabs of milk in to get the consistency I wanted and an extra tablespoon of cocoa. With the extras, it came out perfectly. I made 3 thinner 9 inch round layers and it was just perfect!

Very good!  My daughter is in Home Ec this year and has been trying to make things from scratch. We didn't have frosting for cupcakes she was making, so she searched and found this one. It was a hit. Even my husband who doesn't care for cake or cupcakes couldn't stop sneaking spoons of it. This is a great alternative to store bought which we won't be buying again for chocolate frosting.

Thank you, Thank you and Thank you once again!!!  This recipe is better than the chocolate frosting recipe in KitchenAid's "Best-Loved Recipes" cookbook. Kudos to you!!!  I actually used the entire bar of butter, didn't realize it was more than 6 tablespoons until after I began blending, and i'm used to reading other recipies call for the entire bar. I don't think this could get any better!  I baked 18 regular size and 18 mini size cupcakes and I had some frosting left over for at least another 6 or so regular size cupcakes.  
Do you have a butter cream recipe???  I would love to try that one if you do =)

This is the first time i am trying a chocolate frosting recipe and it came out great! It was just perfect and the kids and parents all liked it. My kids kept on licking the frosting only and left the cup cakes.

This is just an average chocolate frosting. I think it tastes better as it ages. Also, the butter quantity is off for my liking. I remade using 1 cup of butter and it was much better.

Absolutely delicious!  Creamy, not too rich, and perfect spreading consistency for decorating or just plain spreading on the cake.
I have made this twice now--once with 1% milk and it was just as tasty as the evaporated milk version.

This recipe is fantastic! I used a little more milk than what was called for and I sifted the sugar twice but it still turned out great. I will never buy chocolate frosting again!

We really liked this frosting. The only changes were, I added little extra cocoa powder and half-n-half for the Eagles Brand milk. Next time, I will make a rich dark chocolate frosting using Hersheys Special Dark cocoa.

This frosting is amazing!! And super easy, too! I always use a little less milk than it says in the recipe. I just add as I go until I get the right texture. Delicious!

OK. This recipe is easy and fast, but a bit too sweet and one-dimensional for my liking. That said the frosting was smooth and worth it if you only have 3 minutes prep time available.

This icing tastes amazing. It's so creamy and delicious. I had to add a little bit more powdered sugar because the consistency was a little too thin to pipe on cupcakes. All in all, this was a great recipe.

This recipe was SUPER easy!!!  I am cook, not a baker, because I don't measure.  So, I found this super easy and it tasted great!!!  It's more milk chocolately rather than a dark chocolate taste!!  It was delicious!!!  Thank you!!!

So delish!  When I made this I measured by weight (metric).  I creamed the butter in my Kitchenaid mixer and followed the directions, alternating sugar/cocoa mix and evaporated milk.  I know I used 2 - 3 more TBS milk than called for but that could be because of the way I measured my ingredients.  I thinned out some of it to be spreadable on the cake and then kept the rest thicker for piping for decoration.  A wonderful recipe to keep!

This is my new "go-to" recipe for Chocolate frosting.  It was incredibly easy to make and tastes delicious.  I doubled it to ice and fill a 9" round cake, but had an awful lot left over.  I'll make this again, for sure.

This frosting is delicious. I've tried quite a few recipes, and always had problems with texture and viscosity. This frosting is very creamy consistency and a sweet chocolate taste. We've been dipping strawberries in the left overs. It's like chocolate mousse. Yum! Perfect for white or yellow cake. I'd think I'd want something more semisweet paired with chocolate.

I thought this was a great receipe.  I was looking for a frosting that wasn't too sweet and this was very good!  It whipped up very nicely and was easy to make.   I glad I read the other posts and doubled the receipe, it was more then enough to frost my double layered cake.  Thanks for the receipe!!

This was very easy to make and quick.  I liked the consistency.  I personally found it more sweet than chocolate but my husband thought it was perfect and chocolatey enough for him.  I think it depends on your taste.  I would use this again and recommend it to others.

So delicious!  Even my husband who isn't a big sweets fan was licking the bowl and the beaters when I was finished.  

I did end up adding quite a bit more confectioners sugar to get the consistancy I wanted.

very easy and much lighter than I have tried in the past.  It doesn't use as much butter  as some other chocolate frosting recipes which gives it a lighter more spreadable consistency without any less of a a chocolate flavor!

This was an excellent icing. I had to add aprox. 1/2 cup more icing sugar because I wanted the icing to be a medium consistency for piping. I also added 1/2 tsp of meringue powder to it. It was delicious and I will certainly add this at the top of my list for icings! Thank you.

Oh my goodness. Just tried this.  I was skeptical but this is the best non-cream cheese based frosting I've ever had. So easy!  I did use a bit more evap. milk (Just added until I felt it was the right consistency.) Very yummy.  I used it for a chocolate cake but I bet it would be fantastic for a yellow cake.  So much better than the jug, store-bought stuff.

Oh my goodness!!! This is the perfect chocolate flavor and combined with the simplicity of whipping it together makes it a keeper!! I have always made a homemade buttercream, but this client wanted all chocolate. I am not a big chocolate eater but this is hard to put down even for me.  Thank you so much!!!!

This was my first ever attempt at any type of frosting. I can't believe how simple it was! The frosting turned out yummy. I found it a little bit sweet. I added more unsweetened cocoa instead of icing sugar to thicken it up. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Wow.  Smooth, creamy, perfect.  Thought it would be too sweet, but it's not.  I used an 'earth's balance' butter, it was all I had.  No problem.  I was looking for more of a glaze, so I thinned this a bit with some cold coffee.  This is going to be hard to resist.  Definitely licking the beater.

I just made this icing, and it tastes AMAZING...it isn't too sweet, it's perfect.  I did have to add about another 1/2 cup of sifted icing sugar to make the consistency a little thicker, and subsituted the canned milk for 2% milk, I had doubled the recipe and there was MORE then enough for a two layer cake.  I rarely make ''homemade'' icing, but I think this will become a new favorite!

I was looking forward to trying this after reading the great reviews, but this ended up being really disappointing and not nearly as good as other chocolate icing recipes I've made in the past.   knew it said it wouldn't be dark but I didn't expect it to be so bland and milk chocolatey, rather than normal chocolatey.  Texture was good and the amount was perfect for a 9x13 cake though.  *** ETA:  I realize now that the problem may have been the cocoa powder.  I usually use Rapunzel organic cocoa powder, which has a wonderful flavor, but I was out of that and just used plain hershey's.  The next recipe I tried had that same not chocolatey enough flavor, which made me realize the problem may be the inferior flavor of Hershey's cocoa powder.  I may try this again with the higher quality cocoa powder next time.

Comes together quickly and easily.  Used this on top of the "crazy cake" and used half dutch process and black cocoa (from king arthur) and it was dark and delish!

I made this to frost my son's birthday cupcakes.  Very, very good.  I one and a halfed it and it made just enough for 2 dozen cupcakes (generously frosted).  I used a little extra evaporated milk to make it thin enough for use with a pastry bag.  My barn cats enjoyed the rest of the milk!  I will definately use this recipe again!

VERY good!!  Some reviews said this didn't make much frosting but I had more than enough (and I am a frosting-a-holic) to cover my 9 x 13 cake -- with a bit left over for just me!!  Thanks for the easy recipe!

Fantastic Frosting recipe!  I have never found a good chocolate recipe.... normally, they are all blahhh.... THIS IS SO YUMMY!  I was a little nervous because I didn't have evaporated milk.... I used 5 tablespoons skim milk and 1 tbsp of vanilla fat free yogurt.... the butter was just out of the fridge so I sliced the butter into thin slices before I blended it.
my husband doesn't even believe me that I MADE IT!  :)  It tastes so rich and creamy!

This was perfect. I made it according to the recipe. It seemed very thin before beating at the end, but turned out very well with a few minutes. I made a double recipe and frosted a two layer cake with leftovers.

This frosting was one of the best I have ever made. It was very creamy and chocolatey.  This will be my go-to chocolate frosting.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I wanted to treat myself with yellow layer cake with chocolate frosting. Because I bake  bundt cakes most  of the time. And the the best chocolate frosting  i have tasted  it is better than the store brand. Will keep in my recipe box and will make again. Thank for the share.

Excellent!  I dissolved about half a teaspoon of instant coffee in just a little hot water and added to the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  Love this frosting!

Made this last night to go on top of the chocolate cake I had made, and WOW! I have never made home-made icing before (always bought it), but now that I am living in Germany the bought stuff is nearly impossible to come by. I thought I would give this a go, and not only is it easy to make with very little ingredients, it tastes AMAZING! Will ALWAYS make it myself now if I want chocolate frosting! Loved it, and people around kept saying how great it was. Yum!

This was probably the best chocolate frosting I've ever had.  Instead of using regular butter and evaporated milk I used vegan butter and coconut milk though I very sure Almond milk will suffice but this turned out wonderfully so this is a great lactose intolerant and vegan friendly recipe

just finished making this with my girls to jazz up a packet brownie mix they made this afternoon and it was super easy very rich and totally delicious i halved the quantity and replaced evaporated milk with ordinary milk as i too couldn't bring myself to open a large can just for a few tbsp of milk and i still had loads left over i've put the rest in the fridge no doubt i'll sneak down later an eat it straight from the bowl when no ones looking definately a keeper and one i'm going to use over and over again

Yummm.  This frosting ertainly does not lack in flavor but I think I'll take it down just a notch next time I make it.  My kitchenaid stand mixer whipped this up beautifully.  I'm used to making my mom's thick fudgy chocolate frosting but it's nice to have a very chocolatey fluffy one in my recipe box, too.

Absolutely delicious. I do not like the thick, overly sugary frostings they have on store cakes. This has real flavor and is light and airy.  Substitutions: Used fat free milk instead of evaporated milk. Also used only 5 tablespoons of butter. Add in the milk slowly because you might not need it all, depending on what consistency you are looking for. Enough to thinly frost 24 cupcakes.  I added mint extract to make chocolate mint frosting, fabulous!  Will definitely think twice before buying store bought frosting again. This is 10x better.   Thank you for sharing your recipe, Tracy!

This chocolate frosting is the best homemade frosting I've ever had. It's rich and creamy without being sickly sweet, as is most of the frostings that I've tried that rely on confectioner's sugar for sweetening. I generally tend toward buttercreams simply to avoid the powdered sugar, but I prefer this so much more. It comes out light enough to spread easily with a knife, but dense enough to pipe from a pastry bag if that's your preference. This will be my new go-to frosting.

Tasty. I don't really ever make my own frosting, and the last time I tried it was a disaster, so I was pleasantly surprised with this. I used just a few splashes of skim milk instead of evaporated, because that's what I had. I also used 3 tablespoons of the Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, and the other 3 I used Ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa powder. If you leave some extra of this stuff in the fridge, it tastes just like fudge!!

I just now made this to frost my moms birthday cake and was not as happy with it as I hoped for will all these great reviews. It has good flavor however as the other users said it is too thin, and i think that 6 tbsp of the cocoa was way too much cocoa. If i make it again i would certainly add probably 4 tbsp cocoa.

This is the best!  So easy and it is so good!  I could not believe how creamy it was.  Just the right amount of chocolate.  Just to make sure I had enough I did double the recipe and it was perfect.  I've tried many different chocolate frosting recipes and nothing compares to this!

DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be extremely yummy. When first made, it had a very whipped consistency, very light and airy. Not overly sugary or chocolatey. I would describe this as a "grown up" frosting although I'm sure kids will love it too. For all of those who found it to be too thin to spread, keep it in the refrigerator for it a bit and it will become more solid and less whipped tasting. I had extra which I found too good to throw away that I stored the the fridge. A few hours later when I when back to have a taste it was such more solid, creamier and more or the consistency you would find in pre-made icing.  So much better that store bought and very easy. This was my first time making icing from scratch and I was able to do it with out any problems. Great pay off for little work. I will continue to make this again and again.

This frosting tastes wonderful. It is light and creamy with just the right amount of sweetness. My 14 yr old son actually made it, and whipped it up in no time. He used skim milk as we did not have any evaporated.

I love this recipe on cakes, but it's pretty dry for frosting a sheet cake that you intend to use as a birthday cake. Best choose another frosting for decorating.

This was extremely easy and delicious.  I used the Special Dark Chocolate Cocoa instead of the regular cocoa, so I only needed about half of the needed amount.  I also added just a little more evaporated milk before icing it to make it smooth out.  It was a huge hit, used it on the Black Magic Chocolate cake from here and it was a huge success!

I usually don't write reviews on this site, but felt I needed to with this.  This frosting is DELICIOUS!  It's not too sweet (but I DO like sweet stuff so maybe I'm not a good judge there?!) and has a great chocolate flavor.  I might add just a touch more cocoa powder next time, though, just to get a richer chocolate flavor.  I used Brummel & Brown's natural yogurt butter and 2% milk (instead of going to the store, I used what I had on hand) and the frosting still came out great.  My three toddlers loved it on their cupcakes!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  :)

So-so frosting.  Made it per the recipe, but a sample tasting left me less than impressed.  I ended up adding a bit of sour cream to it to alter the too sweet taste.  The consistency is nice and it's very quick to make with ingredients on hand, just not one I would use if I had ingredients to make an alternative.

Is the picture a true representation of the finished product?  I tried everything to whip it light first using my stand Kitchen Aid with paddle, then the whisk, then thinking there was not enough in the bowl I switched to a smaller bowl and a hand held mixer.  When that didn't work I tried refrigerating the mixture thinking the butter was too warm.  I frosted my cupcakes (all 24) and it was delicious!  I will give it 5 stars when it looks like the picture.  Any suggestions?

this is WONDERFUL frosting!!!  and the greatest thing was that i didn't even have to really measure...i just sort of eyeballed it, tossed in the ingredients and it was perfect.  for those who complain it's too thin, don't put in all the milk and add a little extra cocoa and/or sugar.  i halved the recipe to just 6 servings for a small batch of cupcakes and it turned out great!   i would make this again for sure!

This frosting was good, but too sweet. So the second time I made this recipe I made one modification. I reduced the sugar as other reviews suggested. The result was very good! I will definitely use this frosting again. I received many compliments that the frosting was just the right amount of sweetness. I didn't give this recipe 5 stars because I had to reduce the sugar.

Made for a ladies meeting at church. I was asked for the recipe from one lady and my husband wouldn't touch it because he thought it was a store bought cake.  I made it with a chocolate cake and was looking for a milk chocolate looking matte finished frosting and this was it. Thank you!

This frosting was good but not my favorite.  It was very easy to make and there was no need for the stove which was super nice and worth three stars.  I think I was hoping for some really rich chocolate and this was more like whipped icing from the bakery.  Try it and see for yourself!  To each is own!

Wonderful frosting recipe! I am 14 years old and I thought that this  recipe was easy and delicious. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly. It was a bit rich but I like my chocolate that way so I was happy :) It didn't get hard like a different recipe that I tried. Everyone loved it.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!  We loved it.  It made enough frosting for a 13x9 inch cake.  I, like others used 2% milk instead of evaporated milk.

This frosting was delicious! As recommended by others, I doubled the recipe, and also added 3/4 cup of rum + an additional 1/2 cup confectioners sugar and 1 TBSP cocoa. Tastes fantastic atop Grandpa's Chocolate Rum Cake!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I prefer my chocolate a bit richer, like dark chocolate, but this was still very tasty!

This is good but a little too sweet for my taste. I'll probably try it again with less sugar. Like another reviewer I used regular milk instead of evaporated milk and it worked fine.

Awesome! I will never buy store-bought stuff again! So easy and I had everything already in my cupboards! I also doubled the recipe to be sure I had plenty (come on, can u really have too much frosting?) and had enough left over for maybe a batch of cupcakes or some graham cracker/frosting sandwiches. Yum yum! Thanks for this recipe!

This is a really good frosting!  I did do some substituting though.  I substituted shortening for butter and 2% milk for condensed milk.  I also added a little more milk then the recipe called for to make it more spreadable so I could frost a two layer cake.  Overall very good!  I am impressed.

A little too sweet for me and more of a dark chocolate taste than milk chocolate. But that aside, the best and easiest recipe I have ever tried. A very smooth consistancy and deffinately better than store bought frostings. Thanks for the recipe. Will use again.

yum!, I increased the recipe until it used 1/2 c. butter (16 servings) & it was just enough to frost and fill 2 9inch rounds. (and to taste it to make sure it was good!) I used fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of evaporated milk.  The cake I made was only so-so but the frosting saved the day.

I bake now and than but never made frosting before.  This recipe seems simple enough for me to make with my busy schedule as a new mom.  I was very impressed at how it turned out-it's delicious.  I used it for my 9x13 devil's pound cake that I made for work and the quantity is perfect.  I did have little left over.  This is a perfect frosting for cupcakes as well.   This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was definitely creamy.  I was looking for consistency similar to canned frosting and this was a match.  The flavor of the chocolate was still similar (to me) of chocolate buttercream.  Not as gritty though.

I have nothing but rave reviews from family and friends when I make this frosting.  The only change I make is to cut the cocoa by 1/2.

This is the best Chocolate Frosting I have ever used!!  Followed recipe exactly, only exception is that I doubled the recipe to frost double layer cake.  I will be using this from now on. Perfect flavor and consistency!

I can't tell you how good this icing is. Both my kids and husband hover around like vultures when I make it, waiting for me to be finished so they can lick the beaters/spoon/etc! It is incredibly easy to increase the quantity as well. I've found that there's no need to increase the butter; simply add more evaporated milk, cocoa, and powdered sugar until you get the consistency you are looking for (obviously if you are going for significantly more icing, you'll want to double everything from the start).  Wonderful icing!

Divine! Easy! Perfect! I made it by the recipe and it's the best chocolate frosting I've ever tasted. I'm not a fan of buttercream frostings, they're usually too pastey for my taste. This is a light and fluffy version, Delicious!

I doubled this recipe to frost a two layer cake. I did not have evaporated milk so I just used milk. Worked great. Very easy to spread on the cake.

THE BEST.  I was a little afraid, I am used to using a recipe that I have to make on the stove-top.  I must say that I will do this from now on, it was wonderful.  Creamy and just melted in our mouths.  I did use almond extract instead, i was out of vanilla.  I just cant say enough, so good!!  thanks for sharing it.

Such yummy icing, could have just eaten it right out the bowl and skipped the cake.  Loved it as did everyone else including my mom and sister who bake often.  They both want the recipe and will be using this icing from now on.

Okay-I joined allrecipes JUST so I could rate this frosting!  I am terrible at frosting/glazes and had recently given up on trying & resorted to just buying the storebrand until I found this recipe.    It turns out PERFECTLY - each time I make it. Perfect flavor, texture, and sets up well.  This will be my go-to chocolate frosting recipe for the rest of my life!!

This frosting is delicious!  I'm glad I found a less expensive 'every day' chocolate frosting that just uses cocoa powder.  I subbed heavy cream for the evaporated milk, because it was all I had.  It goes so well with yellow buttermilk cupcakes.

This is by far, one of the best chocolate frosting recipes I've ever tried.  Very rich and creamy, not overly sweet and has a great chocolate flavor to it.  I followed the recipe exactly and had plenty to frost a bundt cake, with quite a bit left over.  Thank you so much for sharing!

ALLERGIC TO DAIRY or VEGAN change:  I am allergic to dairy, so I substituted creamy coconut milk (not juice) for the milk and vegan smart balance butter (you can find this most everywhere) for the butter.   Still delicious!

Great recipe! Very tasty and easy to use. Nice and simple to make, and tastes delicious.  Tastes very chocolaty, which I liked. I ended up adding an extra tablespoon of the milk, to make it a bit creamier (and easy to spread), and subbed half-and-half for the evaporated milk.

This icing was delicious! Tasted almost like the kind in the can (yum) but more fluffy which made it perfect! Better than buttercream. Just enough chocolate.  I made a batch and 1/2 and was able to frost and fill a 2 layer 9" round cake.

I made this chocolate frosting to put between layers of cake.  I added a bit more powdered sugar so it was a little more stiff to hold up the 4 layers of cake.  It not only did the trick of holding up layers of cake, it was delicious and so easy to make.

This was exactly what I was looking for. I did as someone else suggested and substituted evaporated milk for 2% because I didn't want to waste it and I didn't know when I would use the rest of the pet milk. But, this was wonderful and I will most certainly use this chocolate icing recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing!!!!!!

Made exactly as instructed and it was fabulous!  I had to make a large amount because my cake was so big.  The sifting was a little bit time consuming but it was worth it.  Fabulous!

Excellent frosting. I'm not a big fan of chocolate, but my husband, who is, loved it. Will be making it again, though I wouldn't mind tips on how to make it not runny.

PROS: Good color, easy to make, will make again CONS: A bit to sweet (to cut down the sweetness next time I would increase the coco by 1 tbs and reduce the sugar by 1 to 2 tbs.

This was not 'the best; chocolate frosting that I have ever made, but it is definately the easiest...and I am lazy so I find myself making it time and time again.  I have made it with evaporated milk and regular, and cannot really tell a difference (it is so sweet that you can't taste it either way).

Simple & yummy. I used this frosting on the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cupcake recipe from this site. Easy ingredients. Very light, smooth taste. So much better than the waxy store bought kind.

Great frosting!  Instead of opening a can of milk, I took one cup of milk, and reduced it on the stove with 1.5T of instant coffee powder.  After reducing the coffee/milk, I strained it, cooled it, followed the recipe, and enjoyed a supurb frosting.

I knew this was a good recipe when my husband (who only likes store bought frosting) tasted it and said "You bought this HERE??" (We're in West Africa, no Betty Crocker at the stores).  Took cupcakes with the frosting to coworkers and one said "OHHHH it smells American!"  Everyone was so happy with the classic "American" taste and texture.

This is a wonderful light frosting!  Some frostings, chocolates in particular, then to be a bit heavy for my tastes but this one is perfect.  I followed there recipe to the letter and am loving the results.

I'm on the beginner level of making cakes... and this frosting is great! I'm putting it on my son's 2nd birthday cake to look like "dirt".  It's not too sweet, but nice and creamy/fluffy.  I changed the recipe to make it 1.5 batch.  I made a 9" round 2 layer cake and wanted enough to fill it.  I filled it lightly, and could have put more frosting on the sides than I did.  You won't regret using this frosting!!

I made this frosting to go with "Too Much Chocolate" cake from this site. As I was frosting two 9 inch cakes, I did double the recipe per other reviews. My husband who always scrapes off frosting from cake was eating the frosting from the bowl. The silky texture made frosting the cake a breeze and made for a beautiful presentation. Rave reviews from everyone and this is my new go to frosting recipe.

Amazing frosting! Smooth and very chocolatey. I used this recipe with strawberry and raspberry crepes but I added a little more milk to make my own sort-of homemade Nutella. In fact, it was better than Nutella! Will be making this again...and again and again!

This was an easy recipe to put together, which was one of the best aspects of it.  The flavor was a little too sweet for me, so I added more cocoa to tone it down a little.  I think the cocoa made it somewhat gritty, though it was somehow still creamy. I think that next time I might dissolve the cocoa in a little bit of hot water.  Hopefully it won't be too runny since I will be using extra cocoa to decrease the sweetness.

This frosting was so good and easy to make! It also has such a smooth creamy taste w/o the sugar grittiness of other frostings!! I made it with 2% milk instead of evaporated (as other people have) and it was just a little wet.  Rather than add more sugar, I just left it as it was and mixed in some chopped pecans and used it for the brownies I had just made.  It's a great frosting and everyone loved it!!

This was very easy to make. I didn't sift the powdered sugar but I think that was a mistake. I would recommend doing that. I also added 2 extra tbsp of evaporated milk due to the frosting being so thick and stiff. The flavor was good. Not the best but it did okay for the moment. Will keep looking.

Simple & quick preparation using ingredients most everyone has on hand.  Like others, I used regular milk instead of the evaporated and found the end result was definitely creamy & chocolately.  Perfect brownie frosting!

Great QUICK recipe. I used a recipe that I received from a friend and it was horrible. So in the time crunch I was in I found this recipe. A little grainy from all the sugar but good for a quick and easy recipe. I used FF half and half because that's what I had on hand. It worked just fine.

Very good and tasty! My husband and I found it very sweet. Good think I paired it with a not so sweet cupcake. I was only able to frost about 15 cupcakes though. I would double it next time just to be sure.

This frosting is delicious!! I followed the recipe perfectly, and the consistency was great for frosting a cake...very smooth. Also, instead of the 5 tablespoons of milk, I used 4 tbsp of milk and 1 tbsp of freshly brewed coffee to give it a hint of mocha flavor. It's delicious and so easy!

Wow. Great chocolaty, creamy frosting. So easy. Family loved it. This recipe covered the "four egg yellow cake" from this sight in a 13x9 pan perfectly. Will use again.

This is great tasting chocolate frosting!  I used half and half instead of evaporated milk.  Other than that change, I followed the recipe exactly.  There was just enough frosting to frost the top and sides of a 2-layer cake.  It wouldn't have been enough to frost the inside but I made a Boston Cream pie so I had pastry cream for the middle which worked out well.

This is a good recipe. After Making it I added a little extra cocoa to make it richer. I used regular milk instead of evaporated. I'll make this again.

This is an excellent frosting!  I was pleasantly surprised...homemade frosting tastes weird to me sometimes.  Perfect consistency to spread on a layer cake.  I'm a chocoholic so I did increase the cocoa, but that's just a taste preference.  This recipe is great as is!

Fantastic frosting!  Very easy to make and just delicious.  The only problem I had was forcing myself to wait until the cake was cooled so that I could frost it rather than licking the frosting directly off the spoon.

This is a great frosting recipe. I used a tad more high quality cocoa, and I used low-fat milk. Excellent chocolate flavor and the consistancy was perfect. This is going in my recipe box.

A very good frosting. I had to double the recipe to ice a two layer 9" cake. It wasn't as thick as I like, but very good.

Wow!  I was really surprised at how well this frosting turned out.  I used the Hershey's Special Dark cocoa because my family prefers dark chocolate.  The frosting was the perfect consistency and everyone loved it. It was very easy to make and yielded much more than what I typically get in a can of frosting.  This one is going into my recipe box.  Thanks!

Excellent and very fast basic recipe. I decreased the milk by 1 Tbsp., added about 3/4 c extra sugar, and made up the rest of the liguid with maraschino cherry juice. Frosting has a beautiful color and consistancey.

Like others, used skim milk (lactose free) about 5 tbs and added one more TBS of cocoa powder and it was amazing and simple.

This was exactly what I was looking for to top my cupcakes - lots of chocolate goodness with the right consistency (especially after some time in the fridge) without having to turn on the stove. 

Actually, who needs cake? I could have eaten this by itself!

It was good - but kind of light on the chocolate flavor.  It may have been the kind of cocoa powder I used.  This time I'll be trying dark chocolate, so I may be happier.  - Edited to add: the cocoa powder makes a huge difference.  I loved it this time!

Good frosting but it tasted as though it was missing something to me. I had to add a lot more cocoa to make it taste like chocolate...about half a cup more but that may be personal preference. consistency worked perfectly with my marble cake (yellow and chocolate cake swirled) and everyone said it was very good. i would use this again but i might just keep searching for something else...

Really smooth and creamy frosting, better then the ones I've made that were rather grainy even though I sifted the icing sugar.

Thumbs up! Will definatly use this recipe again.

So creamy and delicious!  I used a whole stick of butter and increased the other ingredients a little as well.  It was plenty for my 13 x 9" banana cake....yum!  I'll use this for other cakes too.

I've made this twice now in the past week - awesome!!! My husband is raving about it. I did not have evaporated milk so I went ahead and used regular. Turned out great. I think next time I'm going to try adding a bit of coffee for a mocha flavor.

This was wonderful.  I forgot the vanilla on the first batch and you couldn't tell at all.  Took me two batches for a 9x13 cake but we like alot of frosting.  Will certainly go in the do-over file.

I was worried that this wouldn't be rich enough for the chocolate lovers in my house but it was a huge hit! I didn't have evaporated milk so I used lowfat milk and ended up using about 7 tablespoons, it was great and I will be making this again, thanks for the recipe!!

Very good frosting!  Very very sweet though.  I used only 3 tbsp of Cocoa and it was still very chocolatey.  Thanks!

This turned out well. My first time making frosting. I did not have a sifter or anything on hand to sift so I mixed the sugar and cocoa using a fork.  The consistency was VERY light. I only used 2 cups of sugar but I think I like it a little sweeter.

Great frosting. It was the perfect amount for a 2 layer 9-inch round cake. 
Very simple and quick to pull together.

I enjoyed it, but my family didn't care for it much. They thought it was a little too sweet. I doubled to recipe to fill a layer cake, so maybe that's why. Thanks for the recipe, but probably will not make again.

Delicious! I used crisco instead of butter. I added 2 extra tbls of milk, an extra 3 tbls of cocoa, and 1 tbls total of vanilla. Very smooth, but still thick. Will definitely make again!

This was the first time that I have made a homemade frosting. Let me tell you, this is the best frosting that I have ever tasted. The recipe turned out fantastic; I could'nt stop licking the bowl on this one.  I will use this recipe again, and again.

BEWARE THIS IS VERY THIN!  I ended up adding about 2 more cups of sifted confectioners'sugar to get it to a thick enough consistency to spread on cupcakes.  I then had to add about 1/4 of unsweetened cocoa powder as by the time I added the extra confectioners' sugar it did not taste like chocolate any more.  I WILL NOT make this again!

This icing was terrible.  The consistency was easy for spreading, but the texture was grainy.  I ended up scraping the icing off and starting over with another recipe that I have.  I will never use this recipe again.  Gave 2 stars for easy spreading.

Pretty good frosting. Most of my family loved it. My only complaint is that the confectioner's sugar and cocoa seemed a little grainy, despite mixing for a long time.

Everything the reviews said and more!  This is a delicious chocolate frosting.  I was able to generously frost 1 dozen chocolate cupcakes.  The frosting is sweet, but light enough that it is not overwhelming.  It is soft so plan ahead to let it chill if you will be transporting something frosted with this.

This frosting was AWESOME!  It's just like the light chocolate frosting my mom made for me when I was a kid.  I chose what kind of cake I wanted and it was always yellow cake with frosting that she made that taked EXACTLY like this.  Not dark, but nice and light.  THANKS!  This is a keeper!  My new recipe!

The best thing I liked about this frosting was that it wasn't gooey which is a good thing.  I used it for the best brownies recipe.  It hardened nicely on them.

This was a fine frosting recipe, but not a favorite. It does spread nicely and is easy to make.

I used this to frost the Best Brownies recipe on this site and thought the frosting was exceptional. The texture was so creamy and it had a great mild taste. I used a little less sugar and increased the cocoa powder a little. Used cocoa to thicken to desire consistency. Also used a spicy Mexican vanilla. It was delicious. Thanks!

I added in more powdered sugar and milk then recommended, because it didn't blend too well. But I just love the consistancy, and I didnt think it was too sweet. Its a perfect mix of creamy and just plain yummy. I will be using this again, thanx.

This frosting was extra creamy and had a great flavor.  I used 2% milk.
