I was disappointed with this recipe.   It sounds so good, and I like the idea that there is no added fat in the batter,  but the finished product was kind of a boring, cake-like bar~ not what I envisioned at all!  I ended up melting the rest of the bag of chocolate chips and using them as a coating for the bars.  This did help.  I will say that after the bars sat for a few days in a sealed container, they were more moist and tasted much better~ I gave some away and ate the rest myself.  I don't think I would make this recipe again~ the ingredients are expensive and the final product isn't that great.

I came across this recipe while searching for a similar one.  While a little more time consuming in the preparation of the ingredients than many other cookie recipes, this recipe is an excellent addition to my christmas cookie list.  My Kids loved them, and the people I work with thought they were great.
