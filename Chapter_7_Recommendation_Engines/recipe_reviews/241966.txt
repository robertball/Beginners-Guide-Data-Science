This was absolutely amazing! I'll be honest, when I added the liquids I started to worry that it was just going to be a soupy mess.  I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome though!

I altered the recipe a bit to better fit my taste buds.  When cooking the garlic I also threw in some red pepper flakes to spice it up.  I used a 15oz jar of alfredo sauce instead of 24oz and added a handful of grated parmesan.  I also used chicken broth instead of chicken stock just because I never have chicken stock in the house. 

Also be sure to stir!!!!! The orzo will stick to the bottom on the skillet if you are not careful.

I didn't have orzo, so I used brown rice.  Great recipe, easy, I am definitely making this again.

So easy and yummy, my two preteens even had second helpings. I made my own Alfredo sauce as I had none on hand and needed a splash of pasta water that I had saved from a previous nights pasta boil (my new favorite ingredient in pasta dishes).  This will be a new quick dish in my dinner rotation.

This was awesome! I did make a few changes to accommodate what I had on hand... I had a smaller jar of alfredo sauce and didn't have orzo so I used a 375-gram box of penne, and added additional liquid. (I used about a half a cup more chicken broth and at least a half a cup of whole milk, or maybe a cup... I was just eyeballing and guessing at how much liquid to add). I
was keeping my fingers crossed that it wouldn't turn out to be a big gloppy mess... as I've never made a one-pot pasta dish like this with uncooked pasta and it kinda seemed too easy to turn out well.
I also adjusted the seasoning to our personal taste by adding about a half teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon or so of oregano, and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I used 4 cloves of garlic, since pasta can never have too much garlic, and also a yellow pepper that I wanted to use up. Topped with grated parmesan and, MMMMMMM... SO GOOD! Family of 4 loved it and there was enough left over for lunches the next day. Will definitely be adding this to the regular roster!!

This is literally one of my favorite recipes! No changes needed -- I just use light Alfredo sauce. It's very tasty (ESP if you marinate or season the chicken with your favorite seasoning), filling and my boyfriend loves it. Also works great as leftovers!

YUMMY! It's a rainy spring night & this is delicious! Creamy, great textures & satisfying. I'm sitting here with a big old bowl of it eating it with a spoon. It's that good. I did have to cook it appropriately 5 minutes longer- could be my range, could be the skillet I chose. Nevertheless, it's a winner!

We ate it first without the broccoli - all of my kids liked it -  I added spinach instead of broccoli because I did not have any. I will definitely make it again and try it with the broccoli

This is very tasty.  I added carrots and instead of 2 cups chicken broth I used 1 cup broth and 1+ cups milk.  I marinated the chicken for an hour as well.  Next time I'll add red chile to spice it up.

Definitely nixed the extra salt and will not add chicken stock next time, don't need the extra sodium, it was way too salty! But delicious either way!

Really enjoyed this recipe. Did not have the bottled alfredo sauce so I did use the "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" recipe. Not bad, would have been way simpler with the bottle solution. I definitely wish I had doubled the broccoli, or as others suggested added other veggies. Makes a lot of food, and as leftovers, it heats up really well.

Yes! It was super easy. I added a couple of small sliced mushrooms and I made my own Alfredo  sauce. It was delicious. I'm trying to get the hubby to eat pasta and sneaking in the orzo (looks like rice) was a good introduction. I'll be making this again.

This did not have the creamy mouth feel that I expected with this recipe.  It was OK, but needed something else.  Leftovers were improved with cracked red pepper and grated parmesan cheese or added heavy cream and garlic.

I found this recipe when I had ingredients and didn't quite know what I wanted to do with them. Lots of substitutions.

I used a pound a ground turkey instead of chicken. I had a 16oz jar of Ragu alfredo sauce, so I added an extra 8oz of chicken broth (didn't have chicken stock on hand). I used 1 cup of frozen peas instead of the 2 cups of broccoli.

I'm grateful for another reviewer's suggestion to stir well to ensure the orzo doesn't stick. I did need to cook it a little longer uncovered since I'd substituted broth for sauce, but it was delicious and simple.

I added some seasonings since the recipe doesn't call for any, but other than that, it was a huge hit in my house!
