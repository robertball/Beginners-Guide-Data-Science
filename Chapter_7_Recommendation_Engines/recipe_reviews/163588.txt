This was DELICIOUS just the way it's written.  I completely disagree that it's too strong.  I grilled my steak on the George Foreman grill, sliced it into strips and tossed it in the sauce.  Then I turned off the burner, covered up the skillet and left it alone for about 10 minutes.  SCRUMPTIOUS!!!!

I read the recipe wrong and thought it was  marinade, so I marinated my steaks in the sauce before cooking them.  It was a little thick for a marinade, but it tasted really, really good after grilling!!

I added 1 tablespoon of butter at the very end to make it more like a french sauce - otherwise, simple.  I didn't have beef stock on hand and this was a quick and easy substitute.  Thank you.

Great idea, putting wine in powder gravy, but this recipe needs a little work for my taste. It came out REALLY strong, I wound up having to water it down quite a bit, but it did taste very good. I'd reccommend cutting the wine in half and compensating with water.

this was a clever idea.  I added more wine than water and a little bit of sugar to make it more like a port wine sauce.   Also added 1 Tbsp butter at the end.   will definately make again.

I added a little minced garlic and butter, but the dry gravy mix made this a little too salty.  My husband enjoyed it, but probably won't make this again.

The fianc√© liked this but I thought it was sooooo winey.  It never cooked off and tasted like flavors that didn't mix too well.  I followed the reipe exactly.

I just made this sauce for my fillet mignon and it is absolutely delicious! I used California Red wine and did add butter to help the consistency.
Easy, quick and yummy.

excellent sauce. For the people who thought the taste was strong. Try changing the wine. I used a cheap sweet red.I would think a Merlot or Sauvignon would be a little over powering.Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good and so easy. I served with steak and baked potatoes and it was great over both. The only thing I added was a pat of butter at the end.
