Tasty & yes, spicy too.  I didn't use tenderloin - but sirloin and I sliced the meat into thin strips.  I used a smoking hot wok - cooked the meat and removed it from the wok - added the reserved marinade and brought to a boil - let it reduce a bit and then added the meat back in gave it a quick stir and dinner was ready.   This is a fun and really fast meal.  Enjoy!

EXCELLENT! I also used sirloin (it's more economical for us), and it came out perfectly tender! I doubled the sauce ingredients (except the hot chili paste...yes, I'm a wimp!) b/c I wanted enough sauce to put this over jasmine rice...perfect! I allowed this to marinate about 3-1/2 to 4 hours. The flavors of this are really good...nothing overpowering, just right, IMO. I will def be using this simple, delicious recipe again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Loved this a lot. Cut meat in longer thinner pieces. Served w Romaine lettuce leaves. Like an asian taco.

Chef John, you have done it again! We made this tonight and it turned out perfectly. Really easy to make and has a wonderful flavour. We used only about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of orange zest, which I think was the perfect amount - anything more than that and I think it would be a little too orangy for me. I will definitely make this again and would highly recommend it to everyone!

Pretty good! Actually very similar to Orange Beef in Chinese restaurant. Added a bit of diced fresh ginger root, and even though the chili paste (with garlic) is a pantry stable in my house, my wife isn't a fan of the heat as I am, so I just added a bit, to give some zest, and had the bottle at table for me to add more. Also added some red and green pepper strips for both flavor and color. 
BTW, when you fry the beef, it is essential to use high heat and not stir it around so the Maillard reaction to take place. Really enhances the flavor.

You might not wish it to be "Chinese" or "Americanized Chinese"...but sorry, it is very much in line with the flavors of Americanized Chinese. rice wine vingegar, soy sauce, hot chili paste...yeah, Chinese. That said, this is freaking awesome and my entire family and I mean grown children, husband, grandkids, and my father and a few cousins LOVED it.  Good job!

I got this in my inbox this morning and made it for dinner tonight.  It was awesome.  The whole family loved it.  It is definitely a do-over in our house!  We actually splurged for the tenderloin and it was so tender.  I only used 1/2 of the chili sauce though because of my kids.

Excellent recipe!  How can you beat 5 minutes and it's ready?!  My household is on the SB Diet so I did a few variations and it came out great.  Swapped splenda and honey for the brown sugar, siracha sauce for the hot chili paste and used brown rice.  Placed it all on top of fresh baby spinach.  Delish!

Very good! I only had fajita-type meat in the fridge, but I followed the rest of the recipe and it came out really well! Even my picky-eater boyfriend said I should make it again.

Good base, but needs tweaking, as I found the flavours abit bland.  I also added some ginger to my marinarde, and red and green peppers to add some colour and crunch.

Didn't have hot chili paste so I used red pepper flakes instead. Excellent recipe and will definitely be adding it to my meal roration. Will double the marinade ingredients next time to yield more sauce to put over jasmine rice.

I used a wok to cook this recipie, cooking the top sirloin first for 1 min. each side, setting the meat aside, I cooked the green onions, added the meat back into the wok with green beans and sweet peppers for color and interest. Added the marinade towards the very end, as not to stew the ingredients. Very good, only a hint of orange, used less brown sugar. I think I will increase the chili paste, as this wasn't quite hot enough for me. It was nothing like any chinese dish I have ever had, whether 'authentic' or not.

It is very, very good although I modified the recipe a bit. By accident, instead of seasoned rice vinegar, I took white wine vinegar and I'm glad I did otherwise it would've been too tart. I used low sodium soy sauce and marinated overnight (yum). If you don't have this luxury, I really recommend to marinate for a good 4 hours and you'll see how much it can make a differance in taste. Instead of using cooking spray, I used sesame oil which inhance the taste of this dish. No salt... matter in fact, my husband and I never cook with salt and we prefer to have fun experimenting different spices...try it! About 30 seconds before I removed from heat, I added 2 tbsp. orange juice. Serve over jasmine rice....yummy! Thank you chef John for this recipe and also thank you for entertaining us with your videos.

This was quick to make but just OK to taste. It didn't taste like all my ingredients came together - some bites had too much orange while others had too much garlic.

This was very good! I used round steak and it came out delicious. I didn't have the red chile paste so I used red chile flakes. I added some ground ginger and a little more garlic powder. YUM!

Most of my cooking is done after work and after working out SO I skipped the marinade (OH NOOOOOoooo), cubed the beef (I like big chunks of meat, what can I say!), salted and peppered the beef with a dash of cayenne, seared according to Chef John and just added the sauce following the directions to a T from there. Came out great and it only took me about 20 mins to make (minus the  brown rice that takes forever and a day to cook!)

The sauce is tangy, spicy and is delicious IMO, you definitely want some rice to soak it up!

I loved this but my husband wasn't sold on it. I used much less orange zest and it was perfect orange flavour. I doubled the sauce, sauted the veggies first then sauted the meat, thickened the sauce and combined it all. I can't wait to make it again :-)

I've made this delicious meal twice - once with tenderloin as written, and once with sirloin. I personally prefer the heartier taste and texture of sirloin, so I think that's how I'll continue to make this dish in the future. My only other change was to use lite soy sauce to keep the sodium somewhat in check.
For the reviewer who gave this dish three stars based solely on the complaint that this dish is too "orangey", I would suggest making it again, but omitting the orange zest. You might then find it a perfect balance of flavors for you. Enjoy!!

I followed the recipe exactly. There is too much liquid. Next time I would reduce and then thicken the marinade in a saucepan and then add to the stir fry. Overall the taste was a bit bland, but I think a reduction with solve this. For visual interest I would cut green parts of onions 2" long.

I didn't care for the spiciness (too much) or the fact that even though the meat drained for 5 minutes after being marinated it kind of stewed in the pan rather fried to a crisp.
Unfortunately , not one of favorites.
Will not make again.

I used a porterhouse steak and I was worried it would be too tough. But it was just fine. I didn't have enough Rice Vinegar so I used Apple Cider Vinegar with it and you would never know. We all liked it.

I saw this reciepe and had to try it.  My sis came over and helped me with it.  Don't worry about a comparison about the Chinese style...it's nothing like it as Chef John said.  The flavors were deep and well balanced...you could taste every ingredient..
Wow...it was so amazing....definitely a keeper!  As embarrasing as it is... we licked the plates!!!! Lol

Very good! I used skirt steak which was great in this stir-fry, however next time I'll slice it thinner. I used less orange zest based upon other reviews so the ratio of orange to spice was perfect. Also, I added broccoli. I browned the beef first, removed it, added the broccoli & sauteed for a few minutes. Then added the green onion & beef back to the pan and followed the recipe.

This recipe worked very well. Its sweet for sure.. I will be adding much more ginger next time and more meat; a little more soy less sugar. But I loved the flavor and texture.

Tasty! Served with red and orange peppers and lo mein noodles. I cooked too many noodles, so I added beef broth to a double batch of the marinade. Will be making again.

This meal was fast, very simple and delicious! Without the chili paste at hand I used sriracha instead (~1 tbsp) which tasted phenomenal. I also did not have green onions available which certainly would have added a bit but without, the meal was sweet, spicy, bold and delicious. Will be making this meal many nights in the future.

Don't count on having leftovers! After the initial 2 minutes of cooking the beef, I removed it from the wok and stir fried some broccoli florets for three minutes, added sliced red pepper strips for another minute then tossed the beef back in to finish. I served it over Jasmine rice and my family loved it!

Tried this tonight because I had all the ingredients in the house. Very easy and having the video is great. I had frozen some orange zest and defrosted it, along with sliced frozen orange slices. Added some broccoli that I had cooked the other night. The flavor was excellent and I was glad not to use oil and sugar. Thanks.

tasty dish and easy to put together. Not really very spicy even though I used a heaping tablespoon of the sambal oelek. Would up it and perhaps sprinkle some cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes as well. Easy peasy and yummy recipe!

I probably wouldn't make this again. The tenderloin cut is way too expensive for this type of dish--a waste of a high-grade beef. Also, there was too much spice. It overpowered the flavor. I would cut down the chile paste. The orange flavor was a bit too much too--I would cut down on the orange zest.

We really love this one and will make again. Used tenderloin, which is really nice. We dried the beef on paper towels so it would sear well. I did add more cornstarch and less water, as we like it thick. The sauce thickened quickly, which left the beef perfectly medium... yum.

It was delicious. I am a beginner cook and let the sauce reduce too much not timing my meal properly with everything else. Next time I'll just double up on the sauce, it was that good.

Good recipe, but two things: no need for additional water added to the marinade. Second, not enough corn starch. 1 tsp won’t cut it, doesn’t thicken up. Change that to one Tbsp and you’re golden.

Yum! I used sriracha, and just 1 t, as my OH doesn't like spice as much as I do, but could have easily used 2 t for him and perhaps even 3. That probably would have balanced the orange better for him as well. I will definitely make again.

Made as instructed, delicious flavor. My only add was a little red pepper flake to kick it up a pinch. Nice layering of sweet, spicy and savory. Served it with roasted red and green bell peppers and brown rice. Will be on my rotation.

It was very good.  I missed the sweetness of my orange beef recipe but it's better for us so I will do it again. I used fresh OJ instead of concentrate and that could have reduced the sweetness. I added pepper flakes cause we like some spice to it. Thanks for this recipe.

Delicious.  I made it with gluten-free soy.  I squeezed the juice of one orange and zested the peel.  The zest was a little less than specified.  I didn't have chili paste so I used a tablespoon of Siracha.  I didn't have green onion so I used a regular onion with slices top to bottom.  I wanted to use up some fresh green beans so I added them to the stir fry along with some sliced red and yellow bell peppers.  Simply wonderful.  I will be making this again.

I used top sirloin and it turned out fantastic!  My brother was staying with me and he loved it as well.  I used homemade chili paste and served over rice first time and over pasta the second time - YUM!  Thanks Chef John

Awesome recipe. Taste so good.  I had no chili paste so I used Ground Cayenne Red pepper and instead of rice vinegar I used sesame seed oil. Delicious and the right amount of kick.  I will be doing this recipe again for sure.

too much orange.  next time won't use orange juice and shred orange zest rather than microplane.  Also used siracha rather than chili paste and two tablespoons were too much.

I made this and put it over steamed broccoli instead of rice for a less starchy meal.  It was fabulous!!!  The beef had such a wonderful, yet not overpowering flavor.  Will def make again.

Will try again!
It was very good, but I made a few mistakes:
Used a wok too small for the volume of cubed beef... Too much liquid came outta the meat, hence no hard char...maximize surface area espcially for a big batch.
Did not have a proper scraper & zested too much... Super tangy.  Scraper on order w/ amazon ;-)

More orange flavor would have made it better. I used frozen orange juice thinking it would have more flavor, so more orange zest was definitely needed. 2 of 5 in my family gave it a 4.5 and another 2 of 5 gave it a 3.5 and 1 did not like it at all. I think I would have liked it with chicken a bit more.

This was very good. I used gluten-free flour instead of cornstarch due to food allergies. Nice flavor.

I love to cook but i have to say... Completely flavorless- the sauce didn't thicken, the meat came out tough I followed the recipe exactly and I bought the tenderloin from a butcher.  I'm wondering if it had anything to do with the fact that I used gluten-free soy sauce.

Very easy to make and tasty. I might cut back a little on the orange zest for next time. My hubby and I both liked it very much. Served it over brown rice and had steamed broccoli to go with it. Great dinner!!

It was a healthy option, but it was too orangy tasting.  It was ok, but I wouldn't try it again.

This is a really good and tasty recipe.  I used only 1 tsp brown sugar and will up it to 1 1/2 tsps next time.  Also, it was a bit spicy for my husband and my taste so will reduce the chile paste to 2 tsps next time.  Really easy.

A nice change.  I had to 'tweek" the ingredients, since I live out of town.  Using this as the basic plan and using what was on hand worked well.  It is a recipe i will use again.

Nice combination of orange and a little heat. When I make this again, I think I'll increase the amount of the marinade, or add some additional liquid in the cooking phase. I like a little more sauce to go with the rice, which is a perfect accompaniment for this dish.
