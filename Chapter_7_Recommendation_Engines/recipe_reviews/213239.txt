This is a good start!  I added a lot more garlic, chopped 1 sm onion, fresh basil, and a bunch of Italian seasoning (all to taste) and let it simmer for 20 min or so while I made garlic bread - it was SO good!  I was completely surprised - I had a back up jar of sauce in case!  Tasted like something from a classy Italian restaurant!  Thank you - this is staying in the rotation!

I made this last night for a Valentines Dinner. I have to say this was quick and easy. I used a bit more chopped garlic, about 3 Tbl. of chopped onion saute'd up, a l lb. box of  whole wheat pasta and I  added in Shrimp and it came out Fabulous. This is a keeper and I will be making it in the future for company. Just add a interesting salad and you have a great dinner. It literally took me ten minutes to throw this sauce together.

OK, this pasta recipe is still awesome even with these mistakes: I used fire-roasted tomatoes used for chili, which had minced jalepeno in the sauce. I dumped in a whole box of spaghetti and THEN read the dish called for just 6 ounces of it. I couldn't find creamed spinach and so used chopped instead The result is spaghetti with chunks of tomato and spinach and it was really good, and even better the second day around. I will certainly try this recipe again, if only to see what happens when I actually follow the directions. :)

This was really pretty good.  I did follow the advice of others and added some extra ingrediants for more flavor: onion, extra garlic (we like lots of garlic), some hot pepper flakes, basil, oregano, a handful of parmesan cheese (at the end), and about 3/4 pound of shrimp.  The sauce was very rich and extremely tasty.  My husband said this one was a keeper.  I gave 4 stars since I added all the extra ingrediants for more flavor.

I love this recipe. So simple - and I ALWAYS have these things in my pantry! As others I added more garlic and chopped onion. But I also prefer the jalapeno or zesty chilie tomatoes so I subbed that and it gave it a nice punch, plus chopped some black olives and used bowtie pasta. Next time I'm going to add some shrimp!

I added olives and just used fresh spinach. I also put half of an onion and a bunch of garlic and it was very tasty! Simple and delicious!

I made this as described and found it very bland.  I should have followed the suggestions to add more garlic and other seasonings, but I like to try it as written the first time.  Definately needs something to wake it up - has promise.

I quite liked this recipe.  I did bump up the spices and garlic, but I do that with almost all recipes.  It was a nice change from standard sauces and quite tasty.  I'll make this again!

Quick, easy & flavorful.   This recipe has become a weekly staple in my house.   Add leftover chicken or pork to give it some protein.   Yummy!

I made this with a group of elementary age children at a summer camp and the majority of them really liked this recipe. (A few were put off by the spinach.) Several kids told me they went home and made it for their parents that night! It is so easy and absolutely delicious! Perfect for a quick, filling meal.

GREAT!!  Took review advice and added extra garlic and onions, as well as a couple pieces of bacon.  Couldn't find CREAMED spinach, so used frozen chopped.  Creamed would probably make an even better sauce, will try that next time.

This is cheap fast and tasty. It’s fine for a quick meal as written.  Consider adding some red pepper and grated cheese.  I also like it with mushrooms. I’ve made it lots of times, always good.

Very good! Doubled the recipe and it turned out great! I didn't tell the kids it was spinach, because they don't like spinach, but they loved this sauce! It was quick and easy to make with a salad and some Italian bread.

This was so easy and delicious!! I used petite diced tomatoes ( didn't have fire roasted) and used whole wheat shells instead of linguini. Garlic salt, pepper, sea salt and topped off with feta cheese. YUMMO! Thanks for sharing! This one is going in our dinner rotation.

Very good.  Not as chunky as the pictures, though.  Used more garlic, a chopped onion and italian seasonings.  Used fresh chopped spinach and about 4 oz of cream cheese (for creamyness to replace creamed spinach).  Family inhaled it.

Easy and good.  The spinach I had on hand wasn't creamed so I improvised my own with some guesswork, but it turned out fine.  I also added two string cheeses that were languishing in our fridge, and some Parmesan cheese.  I'm not a *huge* fan of spinach and I cleaned my plate.  This is definitely a do-over, especially when we need a quick, filling meal.  Next time I'll try chicken!

As written only 3 stars. Too bland as written. 5 stars for simplicity.  
Changes I made were adding: paprika, onion powder, more garlic, Italian seasoning, oregano and a bay leaf. I did not have creamed spinach so I creamed the frozen spinach using butter and a bit of milk and nutmeg. I also added a can of seasoned tomato sauce and a couple tablespoons of white wine and simmered for at least 45 minutes. I used a 12 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes and a 12 oz frozen bag of spinach.

Great recipe- added lots more garlic and red pepper as suggested. Very good! We also have done this using homemade roasted tomatoes we did on the grill and smoked a little too. VERY good.

Delicious!  I noticed that in many of the reviews people were adding spices to make it more flavorful...and in some hotter!  I never use fire roasted tomatoes, and these were HOT!  Or maybe it was the hot red pepper flakes I put on it :)  Either way, very good recipe and my only change was to add an onion.  Very good!

this was fabulous!!  i added a little more garlic, some oregano, basil, and onion powder.  it probably would have been just as good without the additions though.  next time i think i might add some capers.  but the recipe, as-is, is great.  will be making weekly!!

This was sooo easy. Took 20 minutes from start to finish at most. It's also easy to experiment with. I added more garlic, onions, parmesan cheese, crushed red pepper and lemon juice. It's a tasty way to get lots of veggies, too.  This just might have made its way into regular rotation! Thanks for the recipe!

4 stars b/c this was SO easy and tasted pretty decent.  I did add shrimp and broccoli to it but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  My husband said it was bland but he doesn't eat shrimp or tomatoes and those 2 items gave it most of it's appeal.  My 4 yr old & 2 yr old licked their bowls clean so that's a winner to me, and did I mention this was SO easy?

Was a bit bland for my taste, so I added more garlic, fresh basil, and other Italian spices, then sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top. Sure looks pretty!

I could not find creamed spinach at Walmart (where I do all my grocery shopping) so I used the frozen spinach and about 3/4 cup of whipping cream instead. I added the whipping cream and spinach at the same time and let it cook for about 5 minutes and the sauce began to thicken. I also added red pepper flakes to add a little kick to the sauce. Delicious!

This was really yummy! Its something tasty you can whip up quickly! I roasted some fresh tomatoes and never used canned ones, but either way roasted tomatoes need to be used in this dish! It makes a difference. I added a bit of mince (ground beef) to mine and some Italian herbs and sweet basil. Will definitely make again!

Used two overly ripe tomatoes and a jar of pickled jalapeno juice, dried onion powder, and dried garlic powder; simmered then added the box of creamed spinach. Very good.

This is a perfect, easy, weekday meal - as is!!!  Don't change a thing.  Use the recommended ingredients as well.  Use FIRE ROASTED Tomatoes, Use CREAMED spinach.  If your looking for an uncomplicated pantry meal, this is it.  Go meatless for one night!!  No one will notice.  If your looking for a more complex meal, try another recipe.

What a great pantry meal! I was in a rush to get dinner on the table and had no time to get groceries. I sautéed an onion with some frozen garlic, added the fire roasted tomatoes and simmered. I added some capers for some bite. I ad no creamed spinach on hand, so I just chopped what greens I had left in the fridge and threw in some spreadable cream cheese instead. I added a can of tuna for protein, and served it with spaghetti noodles and grated Parmesan. Delish!
Definitely going into the busy weeknight rotation.

My family loved this! I have two who don't like tomato chunks so I pureed the tomatoes, used fresh spinach instead of frozen and I cut 2 chicken breasts in to bite size pieces, cooked and added to the tomatoes & spinach. I served it over spaghetti noodles.

This recipe has such a rich flavor you would believe that the ingredients are frozen and canned. I serve it over penne pasta and add cooked shrimp to the sauce at the end just until they are heated through. This sauce is great for dipping bread in, too. Don't let any go to waste!

This dish was excellent and best of all, super easy! You can substitute angel hair pasta for the linguini and with a little parmesan cheese on the top, it made for a decadent and light dish that tasted like it took a few hours to make.

I didn't make it as is so I know my rating may be a bit off. As is, it lacked flavouring so I added a lot of Italian spice mix and some onions (I just like onions). It tasted amazing! Love it for its versatility and will probably throw in some zucchini and squash for a more veggie nutritious meal. Thanks so much!

Just ok...and this is after adding sauteed onion, bell pepper, shrimp, basil/oregano/crushed red pepper. The sauce comes out nice and thick but there sees to be something missing...

I made this with a few changes.  I could not find fire roasted tomatoes in a can so I made "Roasted Roma Tomatoes and Garlic" from this site.  I then diced the roasted tomatoes.  I also used about 5 cloves of the roasted garlic rather than 3 fresh cloves.  I also added 3 tbsp of minced yellow onion and 1 tbsp of minced fresh basil.  Also, instead of creamed spinach I used 1 cup of fresh minced spinach.  With these changes it was very good.

I loved this recipe.  Easy, fast, tasty.  I added fresh cut tomatoes in the sauce while cooking and garnished with fresh basil leaves and sprinkled with grated parmesian cheese for serving.  The fire roasted tomato really gives the flavor in this recipe.

I try to make things exact the first time I make it, but I could not find any creamed spinach, so I made my own from another recipe.  I couldn't find any fire-roasted tomatoes, so I used a can of Italian diced tomatoes.  This dish was really good.  I had some for supper, went to the home improvement store and 3 hours later came back home and had another bowl.   I had set out some parmesian to shake on top, but we all forgot to.  I will be making this again, even though it took a little longer to make my own creamed spinach.  I should also mentioned that I did it all in the microwave as my stove top is not in yet.

This is such a simple recipe to throw together last minute. I didn’t have fresh spinach or tomatoes so I used a 10oz package of frozen chopped spinach (thawed) and a can of fire roasted tomatoes and added a can of chick peas (drained & rinsed) Came out amazing! Definitely save some of the pasta water or the bean water for added moisture. My husband topped his with crumbled feta and crushed red pepper! This is a keeper and will go into regular rotation!!

Couldn't find the creamed spinach, so I made my own from a recipe on here. Added some zucchini and black olives, along with oregano. Husband said it was the best spaghetti I'd ever made. Will make again.

This was SO good!! Everyone loved it. I increased the amount of pasta and threw in a pound of shrimp and a handful of chopped cherry tomatoes, about a half teaspoon Italian seasoning and increased the garlic a bit. Makes a good amount of sauce, so feel free to increase the amount of pasta you use.

Delish, Make sure you use Creamed Spinach(not plain), I made my own and I accidentally used Fire-Roasted Peppers instead of Tomatoes, but it was really good, and don't forget the parm on top.

This was really light and yummy. I loved the type of noodles used (linguine) it was the first time that I have had them. I also loved that there was no real tomato sauce that drenched the whole thing. It was easy to make. We didn't use creamed spinach. Just regular frozen spinach. And we used some of the fat from the left over chicken in place of the oil to saute the garlic. And no salt or pepper either. Made 4 servings for us.

Loved this recipe.  It feels so light and refreshing and was super easy and quick to make. The only thing I added was some crumbled goat cheese to give it added creaminess.  Thanks for sharing it!

Love this!!!! I used the regular spinach instead of the creamed spinach. I used multi-grain linguine and sauteed garlic (lots) and red onions (lots). Also separately sauteed some cocktail shrimp. Added a can of diced tomatoes with zesty jalepenos in addition to the fire roasted tomatoes.   Got lots of good feedback on this one! This recipe is a keeper!!!!
