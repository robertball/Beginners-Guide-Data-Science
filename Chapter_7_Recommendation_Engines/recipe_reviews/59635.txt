This was a bit too rich, so I made it twice, the second time I used 1 tbsp of butter instead of the asking 3 tbsp.  And used half the amount of cream cheese that the recipe called for.  It is a delicious soup however, I like it for how simplistic it is to make!!!!  I served it with a mixed green avocado salad with maple candied pecans and blue cheese dressing, a wonderful pairing!

Very yummy, 4 stars due to my opinion of too sweet and too cream cheesy.  Made it a second time and used 2/3 block cream cheese, 1/4 c. brown sugar, added some nutmeg, cayenne pepper (because I like a kick) and the slightest touch of curry.  Also used a lot more black pepper.  Didn't use all of the broth because I like it thick!  ***UPDATE: For those of you who are very pleased with your soup, the next time you make it, could you give an estimate of how much squash (in cups) that you use? I made it again and I think both squash were too big.
Thank you for an excellent recipe - I served mine with 1/2 an asiago bagel and a sliced honeycrisp apple.

I really enjoy this soup.  I used less brown sugar and less cream cheese than called for -- and added chili powder and a smidgen of nutmeg.  Even with the reduction of the sugar, it's still a bit sweet -- almost like hot, liquid pumpkin pie -- but very good.  I'll use this recipe again.

If I could give it 10 stars I would!  Very Yummy!!!  It was super easy to make and very delicious!  I cooked my squash the way I always do: cut in 1/2, place cut side up in a baking dish in 1/4 inch water, dotted with butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper cover bake 400 deg. for 30-40 minutes till soft.  I also used regular yellow onions and a hand full of brown sugar.  Mine was just delicious not too sweet at all.

I had a similar soup at a local diner & I've been trying to reproduce it ever since.  Thanks to this recipe I finally can! This is the best butternut squash soup I've ever had.  I used Splenda Brown Sugar rather than the real stuff and low cal cream cheese and it's still out of this world.  I added very little instant potatoes to thicken the soup and a pinch of nutmeg.  I’ll be making this for Thanksgiving for sure!

I gave this four stars because it was close to perfect.  The one drawback for me was how sweet it was.  Next time I will probably omit the sugar altogether.  I find the squash sweet enough naturally.  This recipe is definitely a keeper though.

Oh, this was good.  Really easy, too!  As another person recommended, I cut the sugar and the cream cheese approximately in half.  It is very rich.

I made this for a Thanksgiving party and received great compliments. Even people who said they don't like soup complimented this. I look forward to making it again.

AMAZING & EASY!!!!! I'm a beginner to be sure, and tried this recipie based on 2 things: I LOVE squash, and everyone said it was easy to make. I agree. I've mde it 3 times in 6 weeks & simply adore it.  If you like it thick, using one 10.75 oz can of chicken broth will work. If you want thinner texture, add more broth to taste. One reviewer said they used milk insead of cream cheese b/c it was too rich, but when I tried that I was dissapointed with texture; not to my taste. I also double the chopped sweet onion so I can taste it more. I use a very shallow 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, more than that was too much & got overpowering.  ALSO: Don't be afraid to reduce the butter to 2 tbsp & use reduced fat/fat free & reduced sodium margerine, cream cheese & broth, it works BEAUTIFULLY!

DELISH! I agree with all the cooks who halved the cream cheese. I omitted the brown sugar altogether and added cayenne, curry, nutmeg, and fresh thyme. i also roasted the onions with the squash instead of cooking them separately. I served it with crunchy homemade croutons and sliced avocado. So good!!!

I made a similar recipe last night.  If I use Buttercup squash, I rarely have to sweeten it at all.  Rather than ground cinnamon, I use marjoram & ground cayenne.  The heat w/the sweet of the squash is yummy.  This time I peeled the squash and put it in my crock pot on high for 3 hours w/all ingredients but the cream cheese.  When I got home from work I added the cream cheese & used my immersion blender.  Smooth in seconds & so yummy!!

The first time I made this soup it was very rich. We thought it was too rich for our taste. The second time I made it I cut back on the cream cheese to 4oz and 1/4 of sugar and 1 TBLS of butter. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg. This is our preference.

Lovely soup!  The best part about this recipe is how easily it is adjusted to suit each family's tastes.  I took the advice of another reviewer and waited until the end to add brown sugar, bit by bit until I reached the level of sweetness that was right for us.  I also used 4 oz of Neufchatel cheese instead of 8 oz cream cheese.  Thank you for this excellent and versatile recipe!

Lovely soup but just too sweet for us.   The answer being to substitute 1/2 cup fresh orange juice for the chicken broth and cut back on brown sugar.   Also some grated fresh ginger gives it more pep.

Warning: I definitely made some changes to the recipe but I know it would have been delish as is, too!

I peeled/cut/steamed an apple and two pears to add to the squash. I used two large butternut squashes to yield a big batch - so you'll notice I increased some ingredients here. 

I swapped out the cream cheese for about 1 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream. Instead of the stock it called for, I used 2 cups of vegetable broth. (I'm vegetarian.) I also increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons. I omitted the onion.

I realize this is a lot of modifications, but WOW. It is a creamy, sweet, delicious soup! I can't get enough of it!

This is a fantastic soup!!  I'd made another butternut squash soup earlier this fall from a different recipe here on allrecipes, but the consistency was too much like applesauce.  This is wonderfully rich and creamy due to the cream cheese.  Per advice of others, I only added about 1.5 tbsps brown sugar, and it was still plenty sweet.  I will make this again and again!

I had never made butternut squash soup before and I thought it would be difficult, but this was so easy and delicious!  I used 2 butternut squash and 1 acorn squash, added 2 cups more of broth, 1/2 cup onion, 1/4 c brown sugar and about 3 oz. of the cream cheese.  It is so good!

My family would prefer if I left out the cinnamon. Otherwise, it was so yummy. I am not normally a fan of soup but it was yummy. Give yourself more prep time since you need to cook the squash first to soften it. I will make again, minus the cinnamon.

Yum! I took someone's advice about sauteing lemongrass/ginger/garlic before adding a can of coconut milk. I put 2T of curry spice, some dried basil and a dash of cumin into the coconut milk mix, let it simmer a little, then added the squash. Yum!

Great!  I did, however, make some changes.  I put in half the amount of cream cheese, used chicken base--and made it strong--for the broth, and added curry powder.  Mmmmm!

This was a great soup but I went ahead and made some minor changes: I doubled recipe except for the cream cheese. Used 1 leek and 1 small sweet onion, used both cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added all ingredients except for the squash to a stockpot and brought to a light boil.  Then mashed the squash and added it to the pot.  Once everything was combined I put it through a food processor.  This is a great fall recipe and will definitely make again!

What a wonderful recipe!  I used the biggest butternut and acorn squashes I could find and microwaved them while doing some other things.  I used half the cream cheese, no sugar (the squash is naturally sweet), and a bit of cinnamon as other people suggested.  I keep "tasting" and hope there is some left for dinner!

I made only a few modifications only because I'm a vegetarian and prefer less fat in my diet.  I sauted the onions in extra light olive oil, replaced the chicken broth with vegetable stock, added 2 peeled, cored and diced apples to the pot, used half the suggested amount of brown sugar and thickened it with instant potatoes instead of cream cheese.  Delicious and Healthy!

Made this for the first time...never had this type of soup...I LOVE IT!!! Thanks for sharing! The only thing I would do next time is cook the squash for 50 min instead of 45...the butternut squash wasn't very easy to get out of the skin otherwise...maybe I just had a REALLY large squash though..hehe

This is a wonderfully simple, delicious soup!  It was a little too sweet for my family, so I cut back on the sugar.  I've also added ginger and curry (to taste) and sliced carrots to add some extra flavor.  When I'm feeling lazy, the pre-cut squash at the grocery store helps tremendously.  Serve with some crusty bread and you have a yummy meal!

AMAZING!  Dairy free modifications with a SE Asian spin!
I can't have milk products, so I mixed this up a bit. 
1. I roasted the onion (halved) with the squash to give it an extra layer of flavor. I did this a day in advance to save time, and stored the scooped squash and onion in the fridge. 
2. Next day: Added canola oil to my soup pot and (instead of butter) and sautéed the diced roasted onion, also with 4 heads of garlic and 2-3 Tbs fresh ginger, diced. 
3. I left out the cream cheese and cinnamon.  To the pot, I added the broth, squash, 2/3 c coconut milk, 1/4 cup turbinado sugar and 2 tsp curry powder.  I let this all simmer for an hour or so (could be less), then used an immersion blender to blend. 
One of the best soups I've ever made at home!

I really liked this and will recommend it to others on that participate in Bountiful Baskets.  
What i did differently, part choice and part unintentional, eliminate the onion, reduced the cream cheese, eliminated salt, black pepper, and parsley garnish.
My son said this tasted like Thanksgiving dinner and I have to say, that is fairly accurate.  The blend of the squash, the hint of cinnamon and slight sweetness, the richness created by adding cream cheese and butter, and the nice addition of chicken flavor certainly made this a filling and satisfying soup.
You may decide to have a big bowl and pass on the crusty French bread -I did.
Wishing I could can the extra.

What I didn't like.
The amount of squash is too vague.  The butternut and acorn squash I had on hand were tiny in comparison to what they sell in the grocery store.
I opted to cook all that I had and am thinking about making another batch to put in the freezer.

I happened to have both a butternut squash and an acorn squash so I selected this recipe.  I used this as a guide and came up with what we thought was a nice variation.  My butternut squash was quite large and wasn’t soft enough after baking it for 45 minutes.  I didn’t realize this until I was scooping the flesh from the skin and it was too late to put it back in the oven.  So I added the chicken broth to the squash flesh and simmered it covered for another 45 minutes.  Then I used my emersion blender and it smoothed out beautifully.  It was way too thick, so I added another can of chicken broth.  I used no sugar at all, as I thought it was sweet enough on it’s own.  Instead of cream cheese, I just added some milk.   My result was a nice squash soup that wasn’t too sweet at all.

Loved this soup!!  I used less brown sugar, as others recommended and added quite a bit of cayenne pepper.  I also realized I did something different, not meaning to.  I had a red pepper that I bought for another recipe and in the directions for this recipe, when it said pepper, I was thinking the red pepper.  So, I just threw the red pepper in the blender with everything else.  I actually had commented to my boyfriend on the red pepper taste and it wasn't until writing this review that I realized I added an ingredient that wasn't listed.  Try adding it, you won't be disappointed!

4 and 1/2 stars is what i mean - i can't do 1/2's:(  this was absolutely delicious.  i wanted to eat the whole entire potful by myself.  i followed some others' suggestions - using only 2/3 qt. chicken broth, no sugar at all, only 6 ozs. cream cheese, adding cayenne, cumin, curry,thyme, cinnamon as well as nutmeg.  the sizes of the squashs don't really matter as one reviewer suggested except in baking them - the butternut one was larger and was not really done when the acorn one was.   i roasted the seeds from the squash and put a few on the top(they are very different in texture from other edible seeds).  it looked so pretty in our attractive bowls that i will def. make for company.  served w/a salad of greens, dried cranberries, bleu cheese crumbles, walnuts, and avocados and a crusty bread right out of the oven. hmmmmmm!!!

I love homemade soups and this one was definitely worth the effort. I took some reviewers' suggestions and used half the cream cheese and added some ginger to sautee with the onion. I had very large squashes, so I needed a cup or so more chicken stock to have a good consistency. My boyfriend put it best, though, "It smells warm. Mmmmm."

This came out absolutely beautiful and delicious. I didn't have any cream cheese on hand and used milk instead. I like creamy soups so next time I'll try it with the cream cheese, but only use half the package. A whole package seems like it might be overpowering, considering it is still delicious with none at all. I love using roasted garlic in my soups as well so I roasted a head of garlic with the squash and threw the garlic in the food processor too. I roasted the seeds from inside the squash and sprinkled them over the top for a nice crunch. Served with homemade sweet potato biscuits for a really impressive meal.

I love Butternut Squash. This was my first attempt at soup and it turned out great. I read several reviews and cut the brown sugar to 1/4 C. I used the cinnamon. I have a feeling it is even going to be better tomorrow?

This makes great vegetarian soup - I just replaced the chicken stock with vegetable stock.  Can also be made non-dairy - it's amazing with coconut milk instead of cream cheese, and I added some lemongrass to the stock.  In a word, wow!

Fantastic recipe! I did a couple of modifications which I think made it amazing! While roasting the squash, I roasted a head of garlic and added it to the blending part of the process. I also only added a dash of cinnamon, but added about a teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg. Nutmeg with Butternut squash is just so wonderful. Also, I used palm sugar instead of brown, to lower the glycemic index & sweetness of the soup, and reduced it to a scant 1/4 cup. This is now one of my very favorite soups - period! Delicious!

I didn't try the "full sugar" recipe because these squashes are already very sweet. I used very little brown sugar and added a bit of nutmeg and red pepper as suggested by other reviewers. Very good but plan to play with it. More to follow soon.  

Update - Definitely staying with the small amount of brown sugar and all the cream cheese, but doubled the onion, added a bit more salt/pepper and garnished with shredded cheddar cheese and scallions.  The cheddar melts in the soup and makes it less "graceful" to eat but is so worth it!

First of all, I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I usually prefer this for a veggie soup. I couldnt find sweet onions in my produce section, so I omitted it. It tasted wonderful without it. I figured sticking with the sweet onion as specified would have been important, since this is a sweet soup. I made a double batch of the soup, but stuck with the 1/3 cup brown sugar and added a tbsp of cinnamon. This created the perfect balance of sweetness to go with the creamy texture, while still maintaining the flavor of a veggie soup all 2/3 cup of that brown sugar would have been too much.

Good recipe - however I did make a few changes.  Increase the onion to about 1 cup.  I also added 1 teaspoon of Garam Masala.  This is a blend of savory Indian spices and is salt free.  I am a big Penzeys Spice fan and that is where I found it.  It gave a wonderful flavor other than just cinnamon.

I can't give this 5 stars because I changed a crucial thing or two, and I don't know how it tastes with the original ingredients, but I give it 4 because it was an AWESOME place to start! I'm vegan so dairy was out of the question. Instead I made a "cream" out of raw cashews and water, with about 1/2 tsp lemon juice, and used that in in it's place. The end result was a thick, hearty, and rich bisque that everyone raves about. Two thumbs up.

AWESOME! But I skipped all the sugar and cinnamon. Sub'd 3/4 cup heavy cream for the cream cheese. Also, cooked the squash in the microwave 15 minutes instead of baking. Served it in mini pumpkin bowls (cut the tops off, scoop out seeds, season with 1/4 tsp salt/sugar per bowl, bake @ 400 for 25 minutes). Very savory and delicious and fun for the kids!!

Pretty good, although I'm in agreement about the "less butter". Also, I use some frozen apple juice concentrate to add sweetness instead of brown sugar, and cook the acorn and butternut squashes whole. It seems easier this way; you then just leave them in a covered bowl after baking, to cool some. Then the peel comes off pretty easily.

Very tasty, but the inexperienced cook might need more details than "1 butternut squash".  They can vary from about a pound to several pounds.

Sooo I changed this up a bit and I LOVED how it came out. I used 1 acorn squash instead of two, half the chicken broth, half the cream cheese, a little less then 1/2 stick of butter, 1.5tbsp of brown sugar, 5 baby carrots, lots of pepper, a dash of allspice, about 5 dashes of cinnamon and white and green onions instead of sweet. I love how this came out and so does my boyriend!

Oh.my.goodness!  LOVE this soup recipe!  I had an acorn & butternut squash on hand that I wanted to use up.  I made some modifications at the suggestion of other cooks.  I only added 3 tbsp of brown sugar.  I didn't have any cream cheese on hand either, so I substituted 8 oz or 1 cup of 1% milk.  It gave it a nice texture but not too creamy.  I also added allspice & nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon.  YUMMY!!!

I read on this site how to cook winter squash and it says when roasting squash, brush with oil or butter then sprinkle with salt, pepper, and brown sugar. I did it that way so I didn't have to add additional brown sugar to the soup and it was oh-so-yummy! Tasted it before adding cinnamon, decided to add it, and definitely liked it better with the cinnamon. DE-LISH!

Wow, this soup is delicious and very easy to make! I used less sugar (1/4 cup), half a package of cream cheese, only 3 cups of broth, and a dash of allspice and cinnamon. It was still very creamy and just sweet enough.

Very good! Served this last night and got many compliments from guests. I used 4 ox. fat free cream cheese and added a leek and 3 cloves of garlic to the onion and butter-btw I only used 2 T of butter-it turned out great. ADDED a teaspoon or so of salt and cinnamon and that made a big difference. Just be willing to add spices to taste.

I have made this for several years now for Thanksgiving dinner at the request of many of the "eaters".  Over the years, I've found an easier way of making this there is a competition for the oven.  Use cubed squash instead, and throw ALL of the ingredients in a crock pot for 8 hours on low.  In the end, it'll look gross, but then scoop it out into a blender and throw it in a pot to simmer.  It's so much easier and you can free up your oven for something else!

Fabulous soup! It's creamy and delicious, and easy to make too. To cut down on the total time, I used peeled and cut squash and cooked it in the broth on the stove (veggie broth to make the soup vegetarian). Cooked for 30 minutes, and then used the immersion blender right in the pot to blend the ingredients. A beautiful bowl of soup with not too much effort. Thanks!

I didn't have acorn squash only butternut.
I liked the idea of using cream cheeses instead of cream. Butternut squash is already sweet (as are onions) so no sugar was added to mine. In addition I added cumin, ginger, and cardamom seed, which balanced the flavor that I felt was too oniony. I also used vegatable broth. Overall a tasty recipe. I did not find it to be too rich as some have stated.

Followed the recipe but incorporated some of the suggestions. I cut back by about 1/3 on the cream cheese and used a light touch with nutmeg and cinnamon, tasting as I went. The soup was a great hit on Thanksgiving. Delicious. I will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe! I've made it twice within the past week, with a couple modifications. Before cooking, I prepped my squash by brushing it with olive oil and seasoning with sea salt and pepper. I reduced the amount of sugar to to 1/4 cup, and it came out just sweet enough. Since I like a thicker squash soup, I made a quick roux (2 tbs. butter, 2 tbs. flour) and stirred it into the soup until it was nice and thick. It came out perfect!

This was ok.  The 1/3 cup sugar is way too much though.  For a more bisque-like flavor, I'd replace the cream cheese with heavy cream instead.  Maybe the addition of garlic would give it some more oomph.

I used neufchatel cheese to cut down on calories and fat. For the sweetness, I cut down the amount of brown sugar to 1 tablespoon and used Splenda brand. It was delicious!
This also freezes well.

I would have rated it a 5, but I halved the cream cheese to make it a bit healthier.  The texture was still creamy and the flavor was delicious!  This is my go-to squash soup recipe from now on!

With a cold front coming in today, my thoughts turned to soup.  I just received from a friend a garden fresh butternut and acorn squash and this was the first recipe I found that contained both.  I made it just as the recipe called. It was too sweet.  No sugar is needed.  My family would not eat it.

Yum! The first time making this soup I followed the recipe as written.  It was absolutely wonderful.  Today when I made the soup I used less brown sugar and butter than the recipe called for and substituted tofu for the cream cheese.  The end result just as good.  This soup freezes well.

Love this soup! We're vegetarian so I use vegetable broth instead of chicken, more onion than the recipe calls for, and less brown sugar. My family loves it too. It has become a fall and Thanksgiving staple.

This was awesome!  I altered it a bit to make it healthier.  I did not use any butter, and I used weightwatchers cream cheese & splenda brown sugar; and it still tasted rich and flavorful.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was my first time making squash soup.  I'm usually afraid of soup because it comes out so thick and never loose enough.  But this was sooo good and so perfect.  I changed some things. I caramelized the onion in the butter (not just until tender).  I transfered the onion to my blender and added 8 cups water and 5 buillion cubes for the broth and let that boil.  I added the rest of the ingredients to the blender including: I added a can evaporated milk.  I used a bit less sugar.  Added a generous  dash of cayenne and a dash of ginger.  I served it with freshly baked cheddar cheese bread and my family enjoyed it tremendously.

We all LOVED this soup.  I did omit the brown sugar as I found that the squashes were quite sweet enough, and I added 1 tsp smoked seasoned salt towards the end.  I will definitely be making this again!

This soup was fantastic. I have to say it was pretty rich and if you plan on making this recipe add the brown sugar and cinnamon last so it doesn't get too intense. This is going into my fall recipe favorites for sure!

This soup was awesome. I will make it again and again. I added a few pinches of celery seed, a dash of cumin and nutmeg and a chicken boulion cube to add to the chicken broth intensity. I figured it wouldn't be to sweet then. Used white pepper instead of black as well. I served it with parmesan croutons and it was a big hit. Couldn't be easier and we'll definitely have it again.

This will be my new addiction this winter. I just made this tonight and it was so good! I did add the optional cinnamon and I added olive oil and used only 1 tbsp butter. Also I used 4 cups of water with 4 chicken bullion cubes. It makes enough soup for an army. I loved this and would give it mores stars if I could. Thank you for sharing!

I too omitted brown sugar as others said. I did NOT put it in a food processor.  I let it simmer very slowly for several hours on the the stove & used a potato masher & mashed & stirred squash while simmering.  Also, I always microwave my squash for 15 minutes.  I think baking it bakes the flavor out.

We made this with both butternut and acorn and with some mystery squashes from our winter farm share and it's delicious. I used 1T of butter and almost all of an 8 oz. pkg of cream cheese but otherwise I followed the recipe and it's delicious.

My husband and I absolutely loved this.  I modified it slightly, but based it on this recipe...used just the butternut squash as I didn't have acorn, cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and used about 1/3 of a block of cream cheese, about 1 3/4 cups of broth, a splash of heavy cream, didn't measure any of the spices, but used cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper, and cayenne.  Pureed the squash, broth, and onion in the blender, added everything else to the pot and let it all simmer for close to an hour.  The result was thick, smooth, rich, filling and amazing!

I made this and took it to church for a soup sampler on Sunday, and it received rave reviews.  I made it as shown, doubled the recipe and omitting only the parsley.  I made the soup on Saturday night and cooked it all night in a slow cooker  on low.  I have been asked for the recipe by several vegetarians, as well as others.  Thanks for the wonderful site for great recipes.

Great recipe!!  Very easy.  I used about half the brown sugar and added curry power to the onions when they were sauteeing.  It made a ton so I canned the leftovers.  Can't wait for fresh squash soup in the middle of winter!

This was my first time making squash soup and it came out good.  Next time I will not add as much broth so it will be a little thicker.

A little too sweet for my taste, so I'll cut down the amount of brown sugar next time. Overall a good soup that I'll make again. VERY easy to prepare.

This was easy and delicious.  Will make this a fall and winter regular!  I did add a pinch of nutmeg.  I especially like how it stays thick and doesn't get watery when reheated.

This was Amazing.  I made a couple of small changes though.  I added one clove of garlic to the onion as it was cooking and cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup.  It is well worth the effort to make this

I took the advice of previous reviewers regarding the sweetness, so instead of brown sugar I added about 1 T of honey.  I didn't have any cream cheese so used about 1 cup of half and half instead.  Used my immersion blender which is so much quicker than a conventional blender.  It turned out great and probably not as rich as it would have been with the cream cheese.

This soup was easy & delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written with 3 minor changes.  I added a touch more brown sugar, maybe 2 tbsp, and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I also used low fat cream cheese to cut the calories & make it even healthier. My husband was amazed how good it was!  And, even my picky son enjoyed it.

Made this as directed, minus the cinnamon.  It was way too sweet for my taste.  So, I put it back on the burner and added a little more black pepper and chili powder (maybe 1 1/2 - 2 tsp.).  MUCH improved.  If I make it again, that is what I will do...I am just a savory person, not sweet.  If you like sweet, you will like this as-is. I also think there may be a little too much cream cheese.  Next time I'll try it with only 6 oz. Overall, a nice soup.  Froze some of it, and will be interested to see how it thaws for a nice, winter lunch.

Wow, that a great fall dish!  I followed other suggestions and halved the cream cheese and used less than 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I used two acorn squash and two butternut squash that weren't much bigger than the acorn squash.  It was very creamy and tasty.

I just tried this tonight and made the following changes: added half a sugar pumpkin (one of the little pumpkins they sell for baking) to the squash mix, doubled the onion. added a chopped leek and sauteed them in a mixture of butter and olive oil instead of all butter, only used about 2TB Splenda brown sugar mix, about 6oz light cream cheese and added add'l spices (cayenne, cumin, curry, thyme and nutmeg) per another review.. and garnished with chopped cilantro.  I used an immersion blender while adding almost a full quart of chicken stock until the soup was the perfect consistency -- it turned out wonderfully creamy and smooth with such amazing flavor! I will definitely make this again.

I could not find any Squash so I used pumpkin and following the recipe.  I put 2 shakes of Cinnamon (too much) - next time I will give one shake.  Also found 1/3 cup brown sugar was too much, so will use 1/4 cup (or less) next time I make this.   Overall, it was easy to make, and recommend the recipe.

This has amazing flavor, but takes a LOT more time than it seems.  I had to process in 4 or 5 batches, and it was a mess.  My husband really liked it, but the squash took over an hour to get tender (and I cooked it at 400).  Unless I'm seriously craving squash soup, I think I'd make something much easier next time.  (ALSO - the cinnamon was AMAZING touch to this soup, highly recommend just a dash or two!)

This soup was delicious and creamy but I made a few changes. I added cayenne to taste because I like it spicy, used half of low fat cream cheese to keep the calories down and also used 2/3 of a quart of low fat chicken broth.  I also added some curry like someone suggested and added an entire medium onion. I omitted the sugar. It is plenty sweet enough from the squash already.

Tasty.  I used about 1 lb of squash (if that helps since they come in all sizes) but I think a little more would work well.  It is sweet tasting.

This soup was fantastic and easy. The only thing I changed was to cut the sugar in half- the squash is sweet enough for us. Leftovers taste even better.

This soup was so good.  I was not sure about adding the sugar, so I left it out, and I am glad I did.  This soup did not need it at all.  I used a five spice seasoning which included cinnamon, anise, giner, nutmeg, and cloves.

This is a nice, basic recipe for squash soup.  It seemed a bit flat to me though, so I added a roasted clove of garlic, some allspice, a bit of chili powder, and a healthy splash of sauvignon blanc.  I also took others' suggestions and cut the brown sugar way down.  I let it simmer for quite a while and really liked it!

What a fantastic and simple soup. The only addition I made was 1/4 teaspoon of ground coriander seed and grated nutmeg. This soup would be good hot or cold. My husband and I are wondering if we should even share this with the kids. It may be too good for them! A definite repeat.

The whole family fussed at me when I set some soup aside, to save for Grandma. They all wanted more, more, more! We cleaned up the pot with a rubber spatula so we wouldn't waste a drop.  I have a 20+ year old Braun hand blender that worked like a champ on this soup ... no transferring!  We used fat-free cream cheese ... it had been hanging around in the downstairs fridge ... we had all decided it was generally unfit for consumption, but I'm too much a miser to throw anything away. It was FINE in the soup. Nice creamy texture, and saved us a load of fat grams!

So SO good! I also did not find it to be too rich, but I do have a sweet tooth. The cinnamon was a great touch-also adding sour cream at the end is a MUST! Use light cream cheese for a very healthy but very filling soup!

I made this for a very large group and I was really surprised by the reaction it had. Everyone was talking about it weeks later and how good it was. I did make a few changes, following the tips of previous reviewers. I put half the asked amount of cream cheese and I also added less broth. How much broth added all depends on personal taste, but I thought the full amount was unnecessary. Only 1 Tbs. of butter instead of 3 too.

I made this soup for a lunch group. It was out of this world good. And it is so easy to make. The ladys all had to have the recipe. I served it hot and added the sour cream.

I always read the reviews on recipes before making them. I agree with cutting the sugar. Both times I have made it I used 1/4 cup unpacked brown sugar. I also added some sage and thyme to make it a little more savory.

This soup was very yummy and easy to make. I apparently like Rich and creamy, I put the full amount of cream cheese and sugar in and I love it!

Made it just as stated recipe except for also added some of the spices and rosemary olive oil to the squashes before baking them in the oven. It was AMAZING!! I’ve never made a squash soup before this. I think it tastes almost exactly like Panera’s Butternut Squash soup. I can’t stop eating it! Thanks for the recipe. (If I would have used less onion, I would have definitely used less brown sugar.)

I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, the butter to 2 tbsp, and used a 1/2 brick of reduced fat cream cheese I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of ginger, and used a whole medium onion. More flavor, and less calories!  I will make this again!

Because of the different sizes of squash, sometime 1 quart of chicken broth is too much. So error on too little broth when mixing in the food processor. You can always add more broth when warming it. I use more cinnamon (to taste) and more onion (almost a full medium size one). So rich and creamy.

The soup was excellent. It was very easy to make, I followed the recipe with every step except the onions. I don't do onions, so I substituted with onion power. I will definitely be making it again

I LOVED this soup! It was delicious and super easy. To cook the squash, I simply washed the outsides and baked them on a baking sheet at 400 degrees for one hour. After baking, it was effortless to slice them in half and scoop out the seeds.

This soup was good and even better the next day!  I too reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup packed, the butter to 2 tbsp and the cream cheese to about 6oz. Also added some cayenne pepper....other than that, followed the recipe. A real hit!

Good starting point soup. A bit sweet for my taste.
Roasted squash in a smoker at 240 with mesquite.
Added chipotle and smoked poblano pepper.
Reheats well.

The perfect autumn soup! Saved the calories and deleted the cream cheese and used only a tbs of sugar. A sprinkle of ginger added a bit more flavor.

The soup was good! My husband absolutely loved it. The only thing I did different was I just added a small pinch of brown sugar opposed to 1/3 cup (I know the squash is sweet in itself) and instead of cinnamon, I used cayenne pepper. Sweet and spicy deliciousness! :)   

I served it with grilled cheese... I picked up some white cheddar with cracked pepper in it and added spinach to it. Yummy!

This soup is delicious. I make it vegan for my sister's family by using vegan margarine and vegan cream cheese.  I also add about 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and a couple of dashes of red pepper, which is a nice blend with the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Yummy!

Delicious recipe! I halved the cream cheese and brown sugar as others suggested (I definitely would not have wanted it sweeter, and it was creamy enough in my opinion) and cut the butter used to saute the onions to 1tbsp. Using these changes it was only 2.5 Weight watchers points plus per serving! Would definitely make again.

I was looking for a way to use up my 3 acorn squashes and extra large butternut squash.  After reading the reviews and noting the "its really sweet" phrase in many posts I used all the squash I had in the recipe.  I also used salsa flavored cream cheese instead of the regular cream cheese in the recipe and I made a point to use "no salt added" chicken broth.  I thought it tasted great, my 8 year old loved it to, but he said it was pretty sweet but he still liked it.

I always thought soups and bisques were out of my league, but this turned out great! I didn't think it was too rich, it's a great appetizer, meal, or side dish. A sure way to impress friends :)Someone else mentioned cooking all ingredients (minus cream cheese) in the crockpot for several hours then blending with cream cheese and I am definitely going to try that next time

I have made this soup many, many times and everyone loves it, even my 3 kids, it's their favorite soup. I use only half a package of light cream cheese and 1 tbs butter, that's plenty rich for us.

Good, but a little too sweet.  I like leaving out some sugar and adding a heavy dash of salt instead and mixing in chopped parsley beyond the garnish recommendation.

Wonderful...  i used the microwave method, then put them in the oven to speed the process.  Added a little tabasco for a kick.

LOVED this recipe!  I don't normally like acorn squash but the combination was incredibly tasty.  And this isn't too think - it's a very comforting soup that paired great with shredded Mozarella on top.

Very good.  My whole family enjoyed this soup.  Had to cook the squash a little longer to make it more pliable.   Great texture.

I made it for Thanksgiving this year and it got rave reviews.  Velvety and smooth with a wonderful flavor.  I made it a week in advance and froze it - perfect.  I also used vegetable broth as we had vegetarians.

I followed the recipe almost exactly as written. I make soups all the time and love butternut squash soup. Everyone thought so highly of this recipe but I didn't get the same result at all. I don't know what happened. The only thing I varied on at all was instead of putting all of the ingredients in the food processor, I did all but the chicken broth. The puree tasted great but when I added it to the broth, mixed it together with a whisk and set it on the heat, something awful took place and that beautiful, velvety sweet puree took on a flavor that I couldn't even stand a single spoonful of!  I used a quart of Swanson chicken broth. What went wrong?!

Very very yummy! I did not add the brown sugar... In my opinion it really did not need it. My whole family ate it!!! Will definitely make again. I roasted my squash differently though. I did them face up in a half inch of water with butter and salt n pepper over them... Great recipe! :)

So YUMMY. So sweet, I think I may use a little less brown sugar next time and it was a lighter soup than expected. I used Veg. Stock instead of chicken stock since I was having a vegetarian friend over. I have already bought more squash to make another batch.

I didn't really like this, it was too sweet and I couldn't get the consistency right. My husband said it tasted like potatoes... I just thought it was bland. I did try adding a bit of chili powder and even some ginger, that seemed to help but it was still definitely not worth the effort. It was also a lot of work, it took me about 10 minutes just to get the squash scooped out of its shell, it really wasn't soft enough after 45 minutes. It was edible, but I will not make it again.

This recipe is fantastic! Plus it's super easy. I used only acorn squash because that's all I had. I also added a tad more cinnamon. But no matter what you do, it turns out awesome.

Mine came out awful... I'm not sure if I didn't add enough squash or what.  Both of the squash I got were pretty small.  I also tried adding a little nutmeg and some chili powder.  That did not change the taste much...  I made this soup for me and my boyfriend and I did not end up eating it and he claimed he liked it, but he didn't eat much of it either.  We probably just arn't big squash fans.

Thanks for the recipe! This recipe is exactly what I was looking for; a velvety smooth and creamy soup. I cooked the squash in the microwave on a glass pie plate for 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the squash. (or until I could easily stick a fork through it) I will try it with two butternut squash next time.

Great recipe!  Everyone in my family loved it, would be the perfect "get well" soup for autumn colds!  I only used 4 oz cream cheese and 1 TBSP brown sugar, but, it would probably be great either way.  Thanks!

Loved it...easy and tasty. I did take the advice of the previous reviews by reducing the cream cheese and brown sugar by nearly half of the recommended amount. I am glad I did, I found the soup to be plenty sweet and creamy without the full amount being used. Made this for a dinner party...guests loved it too. ( I hogged the leftovers for myself :-))

I LOVE this soup! I want it to become one of my signature dishes. I put in 8 oz of cream cheese, but will probably put in less sugar, much less butter and even add salt. However, I make such a huge mess every time I make it with all the transferring and blending. It won't stop me from making it, but does anyone have any tips for less mess-making for me?

Would not make this again; wanted something to do with two butternut squash I had (granted; I did not use acorn; prefer butternut); so I thought I'd make a soup...  And it was a mistake; or to use this recipe, anyhow.  To sweet (even with reduced sugar); to rich by far; it was a struggle to even finish the half a bowl I'd dished out; my hubby's stuck with eating the last of it; really was the only one out of the four of us that thought it had any decency at all - and even he thought it was to rich and to sweet.  I want my pumpkins back!

What a delicious soup recipe this is!!!  I did cut down on the brown sugar to a 1/4 cup and the Cr. cheese to a 2/3 cup like suggested in other reviews and I think that was a good call.  Because we are a family that dose not like things to sweet, I could cut the sugar just a tad more and this would be accepted.  Every calorie counts.   I also added cayenne pepper and this is a must.  Not a lot off cyanine, but enough to warm you.  Great recipe.   Even for the family members who HATE squash like this one.    Will make this often.

I used just acorn squash because we had leftovers from roasting it the night before.  It is a good soup, but I can't eat much of it due to it's overwhelming squash flavor.  I guess that's what it's supposed to taste like though!

Soup was delicious!!  Went a little heavy on the black pepper, and it gave it the perfect touch.  Will definitely make this again in the future!

This is super yummy! I only had butternut squash and I used a little less brown sugar but followed everything else.
My daughter and I had this with our Christmas dinner (tonight btw!!) and it will be come a tradition from now on!

I was so thrilled with this recipe, I made it again within the week.  It is a delicious way to get Vitmin C, antioxidants and good old fiber.  I drink it warm from a cup.  Great for those blustery fall nights.

So far, the best acorn soup recipe I have made.  I gave it 4 stars only because I have tasted better in resaurants and am striving to find the same to make.   This was so easy, I really didn't follow the amounts of anything, only the ingredients.  It was yummy.

I love creaminess, so I used the whole block of cream cheese -- but that was a little too much even for me, so I'll use 6 oz. next time. One note: don't salt this until it's in the pot warming up. If you use commercially prepared broth, along with the cream cheese, it may have enough salt already. (And after you've tasted for salt, try not to keep "tasting," or before you know it half the potful is gone...! Yum!)

I used vegan protein broth instead of chicken broth, and add a bit of dried parsley as it heated (since I didn't have fresh handy).  It's totally different from any soup I've had before, but that's a good thing. - I would make again, but will need to cook the squash at least an hour.

I did not use the brown sugar. I did offer ground red pepper as an addition to anyone who wanted a kick, with the rich - sweet taste of this dish.  Will be making this again.

This is a nice soup.  I used half the called for cream cheese and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also added curry powder and nutmeg, as others have suggested.  With all the seasoning, I just added "some" until I liked the taste.  Pretty simple to put together.

I omitted the brown sugar and felt it was sweet enough without it. I also added just a touch of cayenne pepper for a little kick.

I didn’t have butternut squash so I used 2 acorn squash, which was likely why the color was not as vibrant as others I’ve seen. The flavor was amazing! We are not big on soups here, the kids rarely finish a bowl. Even my picky little ones devoured this soup! It is a sweet soup, but perfect for my sweet loving tastebuds.

Reduced butter to 1Tbsp. Used only 4 oz of cream cheese, lower sodium chicken broth, 1/8 tsp of black pepper, pinch of chili powder and curry to taste. Left out the brown sugar. Very tasty with just a hint of spicy heat!

I love this soup. I roast the squash, use vegetable broth and I do not add cream cheese, butter or brown sugar to it. I add a lot of pepper and a lot more onion. I use olive oil instead of butter to make it vegan.  I do not like dessert soup so I don't feel adding sugar to it is necessary, the squash is sweet enough on it's own.

WOW! Unbelievably good. Prepared exactly as written for the second time. Upscale restaurant quality. No kidding! Should definitely be called a bisque and not a soup. Yummmmm! 
Leah should win an award for this.

I cut the cream cheese down to 3/4 of a block and used about 3 tablespoons of brown erythritol to make it keto. Absolutely delicious! I've made it twice now -- once with a butternut and an acorn squash, and once with two butternuts. Wonderful both ways! And roast your squash seeds like pumpkin seeds -- they're delicious!

This was awesome! I doubled the recipe and took it to a gathering and everyone loved it. I put parsley and chives on the side for a garnish and both were very good with it. Many people asked for the recipe. Thank you! I will definitely make this again.

I've made this soup several times now since discovering this recipe.  Based on other reviews, I only used a couple of spoonfuls of brown sugar and about a third of a block of cream cheese.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg and a little ginger.  The only instruction change I made was I peel the butternut squash first before baking....the skin is too soft for scooping the cooked squash.  This soup is awesome and has been added to my list of must make soups.

This is one of my favorite fall soups.  I followed advise from others and cut both the butter and the cream cheese in half.   I add cayenne pepper to give it a little kick.  I use a hand blender and blend right in the pot.    Delicious!!

Great soup. My husband adds sugar and fat (cheese, butter or sour cream) to everything, so the comments about this being sweet and rich hooked me. I made a couple changes. I didn't have any butternut squash, so I used two acorn squash and substituted half a can of pumpkin puree for color and depth of flavor. I kept the brown sugar and cream cheese just as directed. I added a pinch of ginger and two pinches of nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. I also roasted my acorn squash with Garlic, cayenne pepper salt and black pepper.  So this was sweet and creamy with a little kick. Very flavorful.  I will definitely make this again.

I made it with vegetable broth instead of animal broth, and I only had about 5 oz of cream cheese in the fridge, so I subbed some sour cream in for the rest of it. Next time, I'll add the sour cream before I blend, little chunks in the pot didn't smooth out even over low heat. Should have known.

Really good though! I'm putting some in the fridge for the week, and freezing the rest!!

I used  butternut and acorn squash as well as leftover pumpkin from Thanksgiving.  It was very rich - next time I’d go heavier on the chicken stock and lighter on the butter and cream cheese.  Microwaving the squash is faster and easier than oven baking. A dash of pumpkin pie spice on top makes a nice garnish.

I used this as my initiation to my new pressure cooker.  I just cut the squash in quarters (seeded) and popped it into my cooker (on the rack) with 1 1/2 c water, and cooked it on "steam" for 7 minutes.  I vented when it was finished cooking, and the squash just fell off the skins.  Then just continued with the recipie (adjusted for 4 servings) and it's fantastic!!!

I fully caramelized the onions for additional flavor and threw in several large dashes of hot sauce to give it a little spice to counteract the sweet. To garnish, I added roasted pumpkin seeds. Added a nice crunch.

I have made this soup many times. It is the best soup ever. I frequently double the squash when cooking and freeze half for a second batch, since cooking the squash is the most labor intensive part of the soup. Lots of times I cook the squash ahead of time when I have my oven on for something else. Let it cool, and remove skins. Then I refrigerate it and use it  a day or two later for a quick meal. I only use 4 ounces of cream cheese and 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar. The acorn squash really ups the sweetness. especially when cooked until really soft.

I followed other people's suggestion to 1/2 the cream cheese and use less sugar (I used about 1/6 of a cup. Soup was perfect! I had one butternut and one acorn squash hanging around and now they are gone!

I  used shallots instead of onions and people raved about the taste. I used more water to make it thinner and added a pint of cream at the very end. So many people I didn't know at the party came to find me to tell me how much they loved this soup. Even my non-soup loving spouse loved it.

I didn't listen to the reviews and made it according to the recipe. It is a must to cut the cream cheese and brown sugar down. it is so so so sweet and rich. cut down on that and add a little curry powder and a spicy spice (cayenne pepper) and ur good to go!!!

Used coconut milk instead of cream cheese since I had some I wanted to use up and sautéed one sliced apple with the onion. Also added a little garlic powder. Used little less brown sugar as week per others recommendations

I substituted a vegetable stock of carrots, celery, onion, and salt and omitted the cream cheese. Not listed, but absolutely essential to a full flavor, I added 1 tsp of salt, though it could have used even more. I may cut back on the sugar a bit next time, but otherwise, a wonderful start.

Yes, I substituted Cayenne vs. black pepper; I added 1 cup cooked brown rice; I substituted plain yogurt vs. 8 oz. cream cheese; I substituted coconut sugar for the brown sugar; I added 1/2 teaspoon ground Ginger for more zest and, I did not puree all the squash as we prefer more texture.  My son liked it and asked for more!

This was a huge hit in my house!  I did reduce the sugar and cream cheese as recommended (by about 1/3), and it turned out so incredibly well.  I had to cook the squash quite a bit longer initially than was recommended by the recipe to make sure it was soft enough to put in the blender.  Will definitely be making this again!

I had a butternut, acorn, and winter squash in the pantry.  Since I had a bit more squash than the recipe called for, I used 1/4c brown sugar, but I think I could have left it at 1/3c as it was still quite sweet.  Again, having extra squash, I didn't add any extra broth, and I really liked the consistency as it was.  Couldn't have made this without my Ninja mixer.  I think it's time I get a food processor, as I definitely plan to make this often.

I used half the cream cheese and it is still very thick, will need to add more chicken stock when I reheat it.

This is a delicious soup, but I made several changes, just like the other reviewers. I omitted the brown sugar altogether, and doubled the chicken stock. I added a carrot and some celery with the onion, along with a few garlic cloves. I also used a spaghetti, rather than an acorn, squash. I used about 4oz of goat cheese (it was what I had on hand), rather than the cream cheese. Some cayenne and curry powder for a nice, savory finish. Delicious!

This was easy and delicious, especially since I had roasted both the acorn and butternut squash yesterday. I had all other ingredients on hand. The food processor was a great asset in pureeing the ingredients. Thanks for a yummy soup!

I made this recipe just as written and it came out very good.
Next time I will do as others suggested and add the brown sugar at the end, 1 Tbsp. at a time. The squash itself lends a lot of sweetness to the soup.
I served this with toasted sourdough bread.

Not a huge fan of squash, but I gave this a try. It was delicious! I used light brown sugar, added the cinnamon and a pinch of salt. It was rich, but well balanced. I didn't find it overly sweet. Will be making this again!

Sauteed the onions but then forgot to puree them with the rest of everything.  Used just water, not broth, mainly because I wanted it to be vegetarian, and it turned out great.  I've had other friends make this and rave about it.  Made it once before with turkey stock and it tasted just like the holidays.

I love this recipe but I do tweak it a little. I use the Greek yogurt style cream cheese and I only use about 3oz. I also lessen the amount of broth as I like my soup a little thicker. I add a dash of nutmeg as well. Always a delight!

I agree with the reviewers about the overly sweet taste of this recipe. I paid heed and actually only used 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar. Still too sweet. Next time I would taste it before adding anything. The roasting process brings out a lot of natural sugars in the squash anyway, so it might not even be needed. However, I definitely will make again because otherwise it's wonderful. I did add some nutmeg and smoked paprika as well.

I gave this a 5 because it was simple and tasty...prior to making it, I reduced the brown sugar due to almost overall consensus in the reviews.  I can always adjust later if needed... I used Neufchâtel cheese and since I was using 3 acorn squash, and extra chicken broth and onions, using the whole package would be fine.  And, I added turmeric and red pepper sauce plus some minced garlic.  These added a nice complexity. Although I made the above adjustments, the basic recipe allows for your own personality and tastes.  I did keep the cinnamon as called for in the recipe.  Yummy!

This soup is delicious!  I took a few suggestions from other reviewers and decreased the butter to 1TBSP, used 1/2 package of  low fat cream cheese and eliminated the brown sugar all together.  I was pleasantly surprised at how rich and velvety it turned out with reducing the sugar and fat, no doubt saving a bunch of calories at the same time! Great recipe!

It was okay as a base. I ended up tinkering with it until had some flavor to go with the sweet. I ended up adding Garlic, a dash of Allspice, Nutmeg, and Cinnamon, then a little celery salt and maybe a 1/4 teaspoon of curry, and a little half and half (maybe 1/3 cup). I topped with sour cream, Sriracha, and pecans (and/or roasted seeds). Leftovers were even better the next day.

Perfect soup for a cold, wintry day! I added one tsp of salt and used beef broth, which gave it a richer taste. Superb recipe! I bet a nice variation would be to add a tablespoon of curry! MMMMMMMM

I have made Leah's winter squash soup many times, but always look for new and creative renditions. Using Leah977's base of squash and a quart of chicken broth I then read everyone's comments and combined their thoughts into my own.  I did "not" use cream cheese, onion, or sugar.  I truly enjoy the unique taste of these combined sweet nutty squash. 

I used one large butternut squash and two large acorn squash. These were roasted and the meat and seeds removed from the shell.  I then added the chicken broth to give ease during the purée process. Save those seeds and roast them in the oven with butter or olive oil and sea salt to use as a crunchy garnish on your soup!

I puréed the meat and stock in my blender and added it back to the pot. I did this three times to not have the blender work so hard.  This allowed me to get a silky smoothe purée.  On the last round in the blender I added to the purée approx. 3 shakes each of cinnamon, nutmeg, ground coriander,  garlic powder, ground cayenne pepper, black pepper and salt.  

Into the blender with the other ingredients  I then added a half stick of butter, 1/4 cup Coffeemate pumpkin spice coffee creamer,  1/3 cup of half and half milk (a little more if you like a thinner soup), 2 tablespoons of lemon grass paste, and one large carrot cut into chunks. Run the blender until all of the carrot is ground into the purée. 

I added the final blender of purée to the pot and heated it on low to medium temperature and thoroughly cooked it u

Pretty good! Will make again. I did make some changes based on personal preference, though. 

1. Cut the butter down to 1 tbsp (that was way too much for that little amount of onions). I also used frozen onions, as that's what I had in hand. 

2. Cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 c based on other reviewers saying it was too sweet. 

3. Cut the cream cheese down to about 1/3 a package for personal preference. 

4. Added a bit of salt and cayenne pepper, in addition to more black pepper, to taste. 

Changes for next time: add more onion or use fresh onion. I ended up putting green onion on top for garnish instead of the parsley to add more flavor. Since I cut the cream cheese, it seemed too thin, so I'll also thicken it a bit. Otherwise, I really liked it! 

I'd say it would feed 4-6 easily with decent sized portions. I made it for just myself, ate a bowl and a half, and have about 5 bowls worth left over to freeze for later.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  The soup was surprisingly delicious! I had never had a sweet soup before, so I was somewhat apprehensive.  It wasn't too sweet though and the other flavors balanced it so well.  The texture was soooo smooth and creamy and the crusty bread I ate with it was the perfect compliment.  It made a large pot so I ate some for dinner last nite, brought some for my lunch today and jared two bottles (2 servs. ea.) to freeze for another time.  I am definitely recommending it.

The whole family loves it, now even my parents! We make it all the time! The only thing we do is use ONLY butternut squash, the acorn squash kinda blands the taste out and makes it taste pasty. Other than that it's perfect! If you're a vegetarian (I am) use fresh or store bought veggie broth, it's just as good!

Five stars for this wonderful fall soup recipe. I didn't a full block of cream cheese and just used what I had and it turned out great.

I liked this pretty well. I would use less broth next time because I like a thicker style soup. I didn't find it too sweet as others did. Cream cheese (reduced fat for us) was the thing that made it nice tasting.

I followed others suggestions and made this with only 2 oz. fat free cream cheese. It is definitely a keeper and was just sweet enough! My family enjoys it with a side salad and it is the perfect soup and salad combo on a chilly evening.

I received a butternut squash and an acorn squash as part of a seasonal produce delivery and decided upon this recipe to use them. The procedure was fairly simple and the end product was SOOOOO GOOD!!! My husband doesn't usually like squash / sweet potato / pumpkin type foods, but he LOVED this. I plan to make it again on Thanksgiving!

I can't say with authority how good this recipe is, as I didn't have all the ingredients to make it. But using the basic outline worked really well.
I roasted the squash as instructed, but I drizzled olive oil, pepper, cayenne and salt on them before putting them in the oven. I also roasted a clove of garlic alongside it.
I read some of the reviews as well, and since I wanted something naturally sweet, I cut out the sugar and cream cheese, and switched it out for low fat evap. milk. And since I didn't plan ahead, I had to use a leek instead of an onion. You can also cut the amount of butter.
After the whole roasting in spices, you don't need to add more (unless that's really your thing). Rich, warm, mildly sweet and spicy! Perfect mix for a winter meal.

This was the best butternut soup I have ever had in my life. I think it was the cream cheese that made it so delicious. I also added in a little pumpkin puree that I had from another recipe I made. Oh my. And it was even better the second day. Thank you!

Used an immersion hand blender instead of dirtying the blender and it still came out great! I cut down on the butter (1 tbsp) and did 1/4 c brown sugar. The cream cheese makes it taste so good - and I used light instead. Thanks for the recipe!

I, like others, cut the sugar and cream cheese in half, added about a teaspoon of curry, a 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper, and about 2/3 of the chicken broth. Next time, I think I may even do slightly less broth because I like it to be pretty thick. Overall, awesome recipe to start and play around with!

I followed the directions as is and thought it turned out great! It does have that sweet, creamy texture & taste but I like it a lot. It is a lot of work and dirty dishes though.

If anyone is looking to modify this to be spicy and savory instead of sweet, I added kale, garlic salt, removed the sugar and cream cheese and subbed 1 cup of heavy cream for broth (do two if you want it creamier), and used some horseradish spreadable cheddar I had in the fridge instead of cream cheese (but any soft cheese would do), and added cayenne and white pepper. VERY delicious if you want a spicy squash soup

Great recipe! It's like fall season in a bowl.  Very easy to make.  My only critique is I would maybe recommend baking the squash for 60min instead of 45.  The squash was still a little hard on the back end after 45min when I made it.

Delicious! I cut the cream cheese in half and used lowfat to cut calories. Added a dash of cayenne pepper. Like many others suggested, sugar could also be decreased and the recipe wouldn't suffer.

But I did make some of the changes suggested, decreased butter to 1 Tbsp, increased onion, used a mango curry dip sauce(from Epicure Selections) to add seasoning - 1 Tbsp, decreased the brown sugar and cream cheese, and added fresh grated ginger too. In addition,  I only used acorn squash because I didn't have any butternut. I made 1/2 the recipe. Very tasty.

Made it as written and, to me, it was too sweet and too cream cheesy. Made it again a few weeks later reducing the sugar to 2 Tbl and used 3/4 cup of half and half instead of the cream cheese. I also added 1/4 tsp cayenne to give it a slight kick. One more thing I did was roast the squash seeds with a little olive oil and salt and added as a garnish while serving. Much better... If you were thinking of boiling the squash instead of roasting, just know that the roasting adds so much more flavor; much better to roast.

This was yummy, but a bit too rich. I added cayenne that gave a nice kick. Next time I'll use half the cream cheese or heavy cream instead. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious and easy recipe. I also cut the brown sugar to 1/4c and used only half of the low fat cream cheese. I like a bit of kick and added chili powder and twice the amount of pepper. For garnish, I brown butter and add a bit of fresh sage with a few sprinkles of Sriracha. - CM

Very yummy, but I agree with the other reviews that say it's a little sweet. I will make it again with a little less cream cheese and sugar and a little more pepper. Might try the cayenne, too! Thank you for sharing!

Love, love, love!  The only thing I did differently was adding 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a dash of freshly grated nutmeg MMMMMMM.  I personally like this soup thick so next time I would cut down on the chicken broth

Tastes exactly like Whole Foods Triple Squash Soup - delicious! Don't leave out the cinnamon even though it's optional. We eat acorn and butternut squash all the time and this recipe is a great way to use up left overs.

Creamy and just slightly sweet, this almost bisque like texture was a total hit in my house.  It's a great way to use squash and was a nice addition to our meal, and then just a regular meal for left overs! 

Def have to blend it in two batches though, it makes A LOT!

My husband loves it when I make this! In addition to the cinnamon, I also add a teaspoon or so of Cumin for a little more kick, and with a teaspoon dollop of sour cream for garnish. You can also save some time if your local grocery sells squash already cut in chunks - you can then either: (1) roast them with some butter and spices on them, or (2) boil them until soft. Then proceed with Steps 2-4 above. Once cooked, it also freezes well.

Very yummy.  I ended up using 3 different squash: acorn, red kuru, and buttercup.  It was delicious and I didn't need to adjust any of the measurements.  I would recommend adding a dash of cayenne.

Very simple to make, and it has a nice creamy, sweet taste.  I reduced the amount of butter and cream cheese so that it was a little less rich.

How I messed it up: It was a busy day and I got into cooking it late. Then I discovered that there was no cream cheese.
So all I did was the squash and broth that night. I also used a yellow onion and was having acid reflux all night from one tablespoon of it.
How I fixed it: I only used 3 cans of broth so I only had to use half the cream cheese, which is awesome because that cuts down your fat grams.
I also added ground ginger to aide in digestion, ground clove, cinnamon, Mrs. Dash seasoning and freeze dried chives. I've never succeeded in making soup before. Never. The best I can do is ramen, and half the time I overcook that. So this recipe is something you need to try.

This soup is perfect for the Fall season, it's very rich, so instead of diluting I blended in some crushed red pepper for a kick and it was amazing! I am adding it to my Thanksgiving menu this year for sure!

I am not a fan of squash soup, but since we got bombarded by squash from my CSA I was determined to use them.  This recipe was great! Rich, creamy, and I used a dash of cinnamon. Too much cinnamon would have ruined this for me. My husband loved it, he was "impressed"!

If there were more than five stars, I would have rated this recipe higher. It has all the elements I look for: it's simple, nutritious and delicious! I will adjust the sugar/seasonings to taste... Maybe try curry powder instead of cinnamon next time, but honestly... I LOVE this recipe.

Ohh so good, I made this last year and have missed making it over the summer months. My toddler eats it well and my hubby too. Its one of my favorites from allrecipes. I usually serve it with some crusty bread from the bakery and a salad. It heats up great for leftovers as well.

I use all butternut squash when I make this recipe, and everyone loves it.  It's a fall favorite and a Thanksgiving treat.

Cut brown sugar and cream cheese in half and it came out wonderful. I also used a pinch of Garam Masala instead of the Cinnamon. Also...I only used about a pint of chicken broth (I did not want to make it too thin).

I loved this soup!! I'm on a restricted diet so, like some others, I omitted the sugar, reduced the cream cheese  to 1/3 block, and used white onion (sauteed in olive oil) because I had no sweet ones on hand. Otherwise followed the recipe directions, and the soup turned out thick, creamy, and flavorful. Utterly divine. Thank you!

Before starting, I read the reviews & ingredient list & didn't like the fact that it was going to end up sweet. I skipped the brown sugar entirely, sauteed 2 cloves of garlic along with the onions, and added about 3/4 tsp of salt & 3/4 tsp of indian red chilli powder. This gave the soup an excellent blend of the natural sweetness of the squash along with the salt & spice. I also substituted low-fat neufchatel cheese for the cream cheese.

I cut the butter to 1 Tbsp, added 1 Tbsp olive oil, substituted 1 Tbsp raw honey for all the unnecessary brown (or any other) sugar). Added 2 cloves of garlic & used 1/2C onion.  A subsequent batch I substituted plain yogurt for the cream cheese (for which I use low-fat cr.ch), & it tasted the same but was a bit thinner.  Great flavor!

For me it had a bit too much of onion flavor, I would cut down on the onion, and I also omitted the sugar as it was sweet enough when you roast the squahes, they produce their own sugars!

This soup was amazing!  I added about 2 cups of roasted pumpkin as well and dubbed it "Winter Squash Medley Soup"  I also added plenty of garlic and celery to the onions and pureed it all until very smooth, used veggie broth to make it vegetarian.  The result was an incredible sweet and savory soup that was also surprisingly filling.

This soup is terrific. I have made it twice and the first time my cream cheese was not soft and I had small white lumps, but it was still yummy. I also used splenda brown sugar.The second time I softened my cream cheese and I held my food processor button down for the count of 30 with each batch. I still used splenda brown sugar. It was smooth and heavenly to eat.

I followed this recipe as is except...I cooked the squash in a microwave safe dish face down with about 1/4 cup of water for about 15 min per squash.  It didn't heat my kitchen up and it takes up less time.

I made no changes and added the cinnamon.  Some thought it was too sweet,  personally I liked it, but if you like things less sweet you can cut down the sugar.  Will be making it again.  Note: I used light cream cheese.

Really liked this soup! I agree with some of the other reviewers in that it was a little on the sweet side. I think next time I'll also cut back on the brown sugar or try omitting it all together.

I think I would have loved this soup with any number of different vegetables but I did not care for it with squash.  I loved the simplicity of ingredients and think it would highlight roasted broccoli, asparagus or any other vegetable that is typically in a creamy soup.  I only used 1/2 the amount of cream cheese (as suggested by others) but it was enough to ruin the squash for me.

I loved this recipe!  I did change it up a bit because of what I had on hand.  I only used half of the cream cheese and brown sugar. Also instead of putting in cinnamon I added home-made applesuace.  I also added carrot which I cut up very very small and sauted with the onion. I also added dried thyme and ginger.  This was so good!  I will deffinately make this one again!

This should be "mock pumpkin" soup! It's so creamy and yummy and comforting! As another reviewer said, just like liquid pumpkin pie. I use half the cream cheese (4 oz of weight watchers cream cheese) and top with cinnamon. It's my breakfast lunch and dinner!!! I adore it, second pot in two weeks, hoping top save some to freeze this time! Excellent recipe- thanks!

I thought this was a fantastic soup! I noticed some complaints of the soup turning out too thin or too sweet so instead of adding instant potatoes and cutting other ingredients as suggested, I just used as really large butternut squash - probably almost 4 lbs - and 1.5 acorn squashes (the other half I pureed into baby food!) But that turned out to be a really nice velvet soup with the perfect sweetness! Kept a few servings in the fridge and froze the rest for later. But if you think the soup is too thin just add more squash!!

4 stars because the squash was not soft after baking...I put it in the microwave for about 5 minutes and it was the perfect consistency and completely cooked...no need for baking it and the time is cut down    also, I added some vanilla extract and fat free half and half - I also used fat free cream cheese and a bit less butter. The taste was perfect    great recipe

LOVED this soup!  I did not add the butter (just sauted the onion in a non-stick pan and added a little of the broth to keep it from burning/sticking), used fat free cream cheese, and maybe only a tablespoon of brown sugar as the squash is sweet enough already.  I probably did not use all the broth either - I liked it kind of thick and just added enough broth to make it "move".  After preparing it and tasting it, I also added maybe a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  It adds just a tiny kick to the flavor without overpowering it.  Tasty!  Thanks for a great recipe!

The soup was easy to make and tasted delicious!  As good, if not better, than what you would get in a restaurant!  My family LOVED it and I will definitely make this soup again!

I thought this was delicious!! I made a few changes. A little less sugar, fat free cream cheese, 1 tsp of butter and fat free low sodium chicken broth made this much healthier. It was very rich. I might try less cream cheese next time. But, there will definitely be a next time!

I added a cup of diced carrots to this recipe (not that it needed it). This is a rich, lovely soup for a cold winter's day. Wonderful!

I am going to try this recipe again, the first time the mishap was my own fault. I have never used a butternut squash and cut it in half the wrong direction - so it didn't get baked thoroughly and I ended up tossing some of it...probably should have thrown out more because it made for a strange consistency. However, the others who tried it, loved it and the flavor was really good.

As is, this recipe is disgustingly sweet and rich.  Axe the sugar entirely, and cut the cream cheese by 1/3-1/2.  The cream cheese adds a nice texture, but it also gives a sickening richness to the soup.  With these modifications, the recipe is pretty good and simple, a nice winter soup recipe.

Too sweet as written, BUT with half the sugar (and maybe with that sour cream suggested) this would probably merit 5 stars from us.
Definitely needs to be served with bread!

This soup was very good-I used nonfat cream cheese - it was great and froze well, too.  I also liked that it had far less sodium than store-bought soups.

This was a really good, simple soup.  We used 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and omitted the brown sugar (not needed - it was plenty sweet) and added a dash of salt.  Will definitely make again!

This was awesome, my first creamy soup.  I made it with only butternut squash.  I agree with other reviewers that it could have used less cream cheese (I used 1/3 fat variety). I regretted adding cinnamon to it, it was way too overpowering and it was better before.  A friend made it without the cream cheese and more veggie broth and said it was great as well (to accomodate a lactose intolerant friend). Will definitely make it again.

Loved it - super easy and I too reduced the cream cheese and the sugar.  I didn't add any other different seasonings because I wanted to try it first without.  I will make it again for sure

I really liked the whole package of cream cheese although I did use the 1/3 fat kind. Using the whole amount of broth was fine, but it does make a less thick soup. I used less brown sugar as others did as well. I added a little bit of curry powder to give it the extra ump it needed. Great soup!

Just made this for my husband and I, we knew the kids wouldn't eat it, so we did a half of a batch with 2 small squash. It was wonderful! This is on my list to take to Thanksgiving, I think it'll be a HUGE hit!! Can't wait to take it!!!!

I Loved this recipe. I did add to it 1/2 tsp. curry powder and 1 tsp. cinnamon, and just 3 T of brown sugar. I felt the curry took it over the top. Yummy. Thanks-Char

This was excellent soup!! I used honey instead of sugar and it was great but a little too sweet. I would even suggest quartering the amount of sweetener because the squash added a sweetness of its own.

I am a huge fan of butternut squash soup- it reminds me of home and my mom's cooking :) I like to try different variations on th "classic" and this is a great one! Like another review, I added some ginger, yellow curry powder and a bit of turmeric. My fiance hasn't been a fan of any butternut squash soup up until now, because he thinks it's too sweet... But I think this one be just be right!!
