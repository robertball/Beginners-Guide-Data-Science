I thought this was terrible so did my whole family. I didn't expect my kids to like it but my husband and I didn't either. It was like drinking a bottle of wine with garlic in it. I was expecting a creamy swiss flavored soup with just a hint of wine and garlic. The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because I didn't serve it right away I waited about 5-7 minutes and the cheese seperated. Too tempermental for me. I would suggest putting the hot broth in individual bowls at the table and then putting in the cheese. I will not make this again.

I used vegetarian chicken consume powder and replaced 1/3 of the water with milk but still used the same amount of powder for the amount of liquid. I also added 1 medium onion finely diced and sweated in the butter to make a roux with the flour. The milk I think makes it smoother when you melt the cheese in. The onion helps round out the flavor. PS- when adding the grated cheese leave the stove on LOW and slowly add the cheese stirring every once in a while. That will keep the cheese from clumping not melting and separating.

This was a really fragrant and delightful soup... very rich and tasty. Melting the cheese correctly is tricky even for a fairly seasoned cheese soup maker. The temperature is a bit difficult to control. All in all a lovely thing for a cold rainy day!

This was too salty. I didn't even add any salt. It was just too potent. I just didn't like it.

My family and I really enjoyed this soup. A few changes I made was instead of 6 cups of stock I used 3 cups of stock and 3 cups of milk. I also added 3 cups of shredded cheese instead of 2 1/2 and used red wine instead of white wine.
