I agree with Rock_Lobster, way too much liquid.

Spinach & Courgette Quiche Haiku: "This was such a mess. Ruined what should have been great. Just too much liquid!" First, I hate to be the first review and it be so disappointing, but truth folks, I should've used my head and realized all the liquid that both the zucchini and spinach would emit (neither were called for in the instructions to be sweated, squeezed, nor drained.) The two lonely eggs did nothing but settle around the edges of the quiche's "guts" and left a rubbery ring at the crust, which incidentally, liquified on the base too. My daughter liked what little crusty-crust there was, my husband picked out the bacon pieces and ate them reluctantly, and I ended up scooping all of the veggies out and using them the following morning in scrambled eggs. With some alterations, or vegetable substitutions, I'm sure this would be a fine quiche, but then the recipe would be an entirely different one altogether. I think I'll stick w/ AR's "crustless spinach quiche", but I'm still glad to have tried something new.
