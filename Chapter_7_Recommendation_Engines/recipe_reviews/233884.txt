I wasn't surprised that the bison flank steak made tasty, tender fajitas. I have eaten bison burgers several times in Colorado restaurants and at my brother's house. I am surprised to learn, bison meat is leaner and less calories than most meats. Also, the cooking time is less than cooking beef.  I would suggest if you make the guacamole salad to add the juice of 1/2 lime or lemon to prevent the guacamole salad from turning brown. Next time, I will use garlic salt or garlic powder in the salad. I am not a fan of the " too much garlic after taste."

Fabulous! I rubbed the steak in a little olive oil and rubbed fajita seasoning over steak.   I grilled the entire steak and cut into slices so the meat did not overcook.  The steak was tender and flavorful.  I loved the guacamole salad.  I will definitely be making it again to go with a variety of dishes.   Thanks bison council for a great recipe!

Oh boy these are amazing! I used Bison Skirt Steak instead of flank. Also grilled the bison instead of cooking it on the stove. We loved the flavor of the bison. Great way to try bison for the first time! I didn't make the guacamole salad. Everyone absolutely loved this recipe. Thanks!

This was so delicious!! I used bison skirt steak and grilled it instead, then added it to the cooked veggies. The guacamole salad went so well with the fajitas. Of course, we added cheese - we love cheese!!

We thought this made a very wonderful dinner choice!  The bison cooks up very nice on a BBQ---quickly, too!  I did BBQ it as a whole steak and then sliced it for the meal, so I had to change how I followed the directions.  Now to find bison flank steak in the market!

Amazing, totally amazing. This is the first time I have ever tasted bison and I can honestly say I'm hooked. At first I really didn't know what to expect from the bison flank steaks; however, now I can tell you this, it does not taste gamy at all. In my opinion it tastes more like beef. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I did use the "Fajita Seasoning" from AR by trmeeds and grilled the flank steak whole and sliced after cooking. The rest was made per the recipe. The fajitas and guacamole salad are definitely keepers. Thank you Bison Council.
