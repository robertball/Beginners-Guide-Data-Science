This is a start of something I'm sure can be great. It has far toooo much water in it. The top of the chicken that was out of the liquid had great flavor, the rest was VERY BORING! I used chicken breast in a smaller pan, it needs more flavor. I'll play with the recipe, I think the Chutney and Mayo with the Poultry Seasoning has great potential!

This is a really great base recipe. I was looking for something with a little more Asian feel, so I used 1/4 cup soy sauce instead of the chutney. Also added a little more mayo, only about half the water, 2 tbsp. honey, and some ginger, garlic, onion, pepper.  I floured the chicken before pouring the sauce over it to thicken the sauce a bit. It turned out delicious! My whole family loved it!

It had virtually no taste. I even used mango chutney which is delish! I guess I should have just used this as a base like the other person stated...

Not bad.. I used a mango chutney. I added 1/4 cup mayonaise  instead of the 1/2. Plus I put in organic orange zest and eliminated the water altogether. Also used only about 1/3 a cup of stewarts classic orange soda. Added green onion and orange pepper, with about 1/4 cup fresh minced garlic. I felt the original recipe was to wet.
