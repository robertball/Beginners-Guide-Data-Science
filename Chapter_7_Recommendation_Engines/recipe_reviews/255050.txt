Wonderful... make them!.. I was running low on flour so I added some chopped walnuts..  Very  easy to make.  They went over really well  in church. I like that they arent overly sweet... if you wanted them sweeter a glaze would work great. but it is not needed

This is like a cross between a short bread and a lemon cookie. Love the flavor! But the polenta was just a bit grainy. It almost makes me wonder if I should’ve cooked it before I put it in but I know that wouldn’t be right.  Wondering if anyone else thought the same thing.   I guess it is kind of “cracker or biscuity”.  Makes me want to search for a lemon shortbread cookie.   I think I might like that better.

crisp and a distinct lemon and butter flavor.  3/4 inch may be too thick.  I put all the zest (from one lemon) in the dough.  Baked 18 minutes.
