I left out the corn due to personal preference but other than that kept it as written. This turned out pretty good. I think it needed a tad more seasoning so next time I will add more Italian seasoning. This is perfect for cold winter days and a genuine comfort food.

I loved this recipe. I used a poultry mix of fresh herbs in my broth to start. Added mushrooms and bacon bits to make it heartier. Used sweet potato noodles instead of egg noodles. AND served it in a rosemary and olive oil breadbowl. Huge hit in my home! Will definitely make this one again.

Used what I had on hand  Placed 2 frozen chicken thighs in the broth.  Used part chicken bone broth and beef broth, unsalted.  Browned onion, garlic, celery, carrot, and mushrooms.  Fresh thyme, oregano, tarragon, bay leaf added.  4 chicken bouillon cubes to increase flavor. Removed chicken when done to remove meat.  Threw in couple of handfuls noodles for about 5min. Added several handfuls fresh spinach.  Placed chicken pieces back in soup. Melted 1/4 butter, whisked in 1/4 c flour for couple minutes.  Slowly whisked in 1c evaporated milk 1 c heavy whipping cream. Added to soup for another minute.  Sprinkle pink salt and pepper to taste.  We loved this!  Outstanding flavor!

The family loved it!  The only thing I did differently was use poultry seasoning instead of italian seasoning and dried celery leaves, and I added a third stalk of celery.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Amazing. I added some potatoes to the pot - making the soup a little thicker and creamier. I also added a little Tabasco sauce and it is just delicious!
