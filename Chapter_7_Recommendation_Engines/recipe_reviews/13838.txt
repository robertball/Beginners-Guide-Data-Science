I would like to update my review. I have made these numerous times and they are well received. I have continued to use the two egg whites although I am not sure if it is necessary or not. I use 2 tsp. of water and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. They turn out wonderful. This is an outstanding recipe. I do make a slight change in the directions. I whip my egg whites in my 5 quart bowl from my Kitchen Aid Mixer. I add the pecans and stir. I then slowly add the sugar mixture right into the bowl with the pecans. I mix after each small addition of sugar. I find it mixes well this way. I have tried the ziploc bag method and find it is not necessary. All in one bowl works well for me. Another update as of 10/2009. I have continued to make these for parties and gifts. I get many requests for the recipe. In the past I always used sugar made from sugar beets. Recently I switched to buying sugar made from sugar cane. I have to say I prefer these made with sugar from sugar beets. It seems like the sugar from sugar cane melts more so the pecans look a bit different. They still taste okay, but I will be buying sugar from sugar beets again for this recipe.

Wow, wow, wow! Earns all 5 stars easily. Even better after they cool off because they get much crunchier. Your house will smell great!
Made the recommended modifications: (1) 2 egg whites for more moisture (2) used 1 T. vanilla instead of water - this makes for a very strong scented egg white mixture which made me nervous, but the final nuts taste perfect (3) 1 tsp. cinnamon.

Great recipe for holiday snacking.  Definitely use 2 gallon-size ziploc bags with this recipe: Put the egg mixture in 1 bag and the sugar mixture in the other.  Add the pecans to the first bag to coat, then transfer them to the 2nd bag and shake.  Much easier to thoroughly coat the pecans!

I'm so impressed with this recipe that I went out and bought 5 pounds of whole pecans (at over $9.00 per pound!)and plan to put them in the 20+ baskets I give out at Christmas along with cookies, jams, and my famous lemon bread.  Does anyone know how long they will last?  Can they be frozen?  Thanks!  ** An update....the original recipe is the best for the most part...I tried it with vanilla...better with water.....also tried with brown sugar.....white is better.  Two things I did do....used 2 egg whites and almost twice as much cinnamon. I got so many requests for the recipe.  I will include these nuts in my baskets every year from now on.  Easy and soooo tasty!  Oh, and the kitchen smells wonderful while they are baking too...BTW, they freeze beautifully!

This is a great recipe.  It was a bit easier for me to put the egg white in a gallon ziploc bag and the sugar mix in a bag and put the pecans in the egg white and flip it around and then dump them in the sugar and flip it around.  A lot less clean up that way too.  Great flavor.

I have been making these pecans for at least 30 years but use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Some reviewers add vanilla; I find that masks the taste of the pecans too much. If you’re having a sticking problem, put 1 Tablespoon butter on a large baking sheet with sides. Place pan in the preheated oven to melt butter. Remove from oven and spread butter over entire bottom of pan. No need to drag out the Kitchen-Aid or use plastic bags, just wisk 1 large egg white and 1 Tablespoon of water until frothy, this is enough liquid to coat 1 pounds of nuts. Add the pecans to the egg white mixture and, using a rubber spatula, keep folding and stirring the pecans until completely coated. Add nuts to bowl with sugar mixture and again, using a rubber spatula, keep folding and stirring the pecans until completely coated. When the pecans are properly coated, there will be no sugar mixture left in the bowl. Be sure to spread pecans on the buttered baking sheet, in a single layer, and don’t forget to stir every 15 minutes while baking. I bake mine at 300 degrees F for 1 hour and have never had a problem with the nuts burning. Let cool completely before storing in an airtight container and store at room temperature. Will last several weeks, if they aren’t eaten before that!

I don't normally post reviews, but this time I felt like I had to. The first time I made these I followed the recipe (even though the majority of reviews suggested otherwise). They were awesome! I figured if they were that good without making the suggested changes, they would be even better if I made the suggested changes (adding an additional egg white, and using vanilla instead of water). Well, I was VERY disappointed. They turned out chewy, and more glazed, instead of having the crunchy sweet coating on them that I loved when I followed the recipe. Plus, I felt like the vanilla deterred from the yummy spice flavor of the cinnamon. So, I've now made them a 3rd time and have to tell you that they are so much better if you follow the recipe. I normally tweak recipes based upon the suggestions in reviews, and if you did the same and never tried them the way the recipe states you may be happy, but if you try them without making the changes they will be even better! The only change I will say that I think helps is adding more cinnamon. I doubled it up but I suggest leaving everything else the same. Don't add more egg whites, and don't substitute the vanilla!

This is an excellent recipe.  Very easy to make.  I don't usually like sweet roasted pecans, but my husband wanted these to put on top of ice cream.  The salt in the recipe is what makes it so good.  I also added just a little extra cinnamon, and baked them on Reynolds release foil with no oil, it worked great.  Easy clean up, just tossed the foil and I was done.

This recipe really is all that and worth the price of pecans.  I halve the recipe when I make it but use an entire egg white, substitute vanilla for the water and use a bit more cinnamon than called for.  I make sure that the pecans are all toasty and dried out before removing them from the oven because they are crunchier that way.  YUM!

Great Recipe.  I kept a batch for myself and took the rest to mom's house for Thanksgiving dinner.  2 lbs of these pecans were GONE in a matter of hours!  I actually substituted Splenda for the sugar to cut down on calories, doubled the cinammon and used real vanilla extract instead of the water.  The result was FABULOUS.  Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loved these sweet cruncy nuts.  They are very addicting.  I added a bit more cinnamin then was called for.  Don't forget to grease the cookie sheet!

I made these 3 times since Thanksgiving; each time slightly different. The original recipe was perfect the first time! The 2nd time I added 1t vanilla and frothed the egg white/water till almost stiff. This made the pecans very crunchy, a little too granualted for me, but still very good. The 3rd time I substituted 1/4C of the granulated sugar for brown sugar, only frothed the egg white/water till just white and added 1/4t more cinnamon. Perfect again! These last ones were my favorate because they were a little richer (more carmelized than sugary). I love a recipe that is good in so many ways!

I stumbled upon this recipe on this site today. I've been making these types of nuts since the 80's. This recipe is slightly different than the one I use. I use 1 tsp. salt, 3/4 tsp. cinnamon, and 3/4 tsp. ground nutmeg. The nutmeg adds so much to the spice flavor of these nuts. My recipe is named Spiced Nuts. I make many batches of them due to high demand of family and friends and coworkers.  It helps to mix the dry ingredients ahead of time in a small ziploc bag, such as a sandwich size bag - just seal the bag and shake it and smush it around until blended. I make 4 to 6 of those ahead of time.  I whisk 1 egg white and 1 TBSP water in a large mixing bowl for 45 sec, then add the nuts and with a wooden spoon keep folding them in the bowl until all are wet with the egg mixture. Then I grab one of my pre-made bags of dry ingredients and pour over the wet nuts and stir and keep folding until all sugar is coated over nuts. Spread on greased pan and I bake in a 250 oven. Remember to stir every 15 min and do not overbake. These rock. The nutmeg does add a lot to them. I was surprised not to see nutmeg mentioned in the reviews I read through.  Happy Holidays.

Oh my!  These were my absolute favorite of all of the Christmas cookies and candies that I made this year.  Not too sweet, but just enough to make them addictive! Thank you so much for the recipe.  Tons and tons of compliments from friends and family on this one.   Merry Christmas!  Remember the reason for the season~ Jesus and the gift he offers to all of us!

Wow!  So easy, I think I'll make them at Christmas time and give as gifts.  I read other reviews about needing more cinnamon, so I increased it to 3/4 tsp.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

loved these so much I bought 2 more cans of nuts to make more tonight!  I took the advice of adding the nuts to a zip lock bag (egg white with vanilla in 1 bag, cinnamon and splenda in the other bag) also used wax paper and sprayed butter pam on the wax paper.  good stuff!  I'm sure they would last a while if stored in a ziplock, but they were gone so quick I couldn't tell you how long they would last!

I made over 10 pounds of these sugared pecans this last Christmas and each time I packed them into a gift tin, I got rave reviews.  I read the other reviewers and took into consideration their tweaks and used them for my pecan treats.  I used 2 egg whites, 1 Tbsp vanilla, 1 cup regular sugar, 3/4 Tsp fine salt and 1 Tsp cinnamon in the 4 cups of pecans.  I also added 1/4 tsp or orange oil in the vanilla and egg white mixture to give it a tang. When baking, I doubled the recipe and switched each pan (turning the nuts) every 15 minutes until they were done.  They froze well and kept their taste even after a few weeks.  When it got down to the smaller bits of nuts, I chopped them up and used them to top my pumpkin muffins.  Again, they were the best!

My entire family loves this nut recipe!  Thank you so much, Carolyn!  I used a mix of pecans, walnuts and almonds (4 cups total).  I added the egg white and water to one baggie and shook until foamy, then added the pecans and shook until evenly coated.  I then poured them into a second baggie containing the sugar mixture, shook til well coated and poured out onto a parchment lined jelly roll pan.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe...it's scrumptious!  Thanks again and happy holidays! :)

Best and easiest recipe yet! My pecans were coated fine in the bowl. Changes were: 1 T vanilla (instead of water), 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. 1 pound pecans is 2 cups - I have freshly picked pecans that I had to crack and shell. Definitely use a 9x13 pan to cook; stirring is easier than if you used a baking sheet. They smell great, taste great and I'll be making more as Xmas gifts stored in tins or mason jars.
 ** 1/9/08 UPDATE ** Made it again for the fourth time after a recipe request! This time I used a whisk which was fine and easier than using and cleaning a mixer. Also I have always used 1 egg white - why waste 2 eggs yolks? I don't see the need for 2 eggs whites. I also don't use ziplock bags to mix, I haven't had any problems justing stir/mixing the pecans in the bowl.

I made this as a lil something for people to nibble on Thanksgiving & fights practically broke out with my grown grandchildren as to who got more than the other--LOL-- I had to make 9 batches and give them a pound each as an extra Xmas bonus gift. I cooked them on a silcone sheet & believe me that was absolutely great--no sticking at all. I have the feeling I shall now be the one looked at to bring some of this to every party of any kind - LOL. Luckily I live in the South, where pecans are not difficult to find year round.  Thanks for sharing : D

Excellent recipe! These rival those expensive pecans from the mall. I took other reviewer's advice and doubled the cinnamon, used vanilla extract instead of water and baked on Reynolds release foil. Just delicious and made my home smell so yummy! Next time I make these I might reduce the salt by just a tiny bit, since I tasted a bit too much salt in mine, but still so good!

This recipe is a family favorite, I always have to make at least 5 batches throughout the holiday season. I found that substituting vanilla extract for water makes all the difference! I have been making the "original" pecans for years and just useed the vanilla for my most recent batch and was THRILLED with the results. This year I also added two teaspoons of Hershey's Cocoa Powder to the mix and could not beleive the difference, THEY ARE AMAZING! This is an extra little something I HIGHLY recomment!!! Even more compliments for the cook than before! And who doesn't love that!? Happy Holidays.

I never use the oven to cook these nuts.  I spread a teaspoon of melted butter in a Teflon pan, then cook them on a med. high heat 'til they are dry and no longer shiny.  Doesn't take long before I'm crunching on my fav nuts!

These are OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Be very careful, they are addictive.  I made them exactly as instructed and I wouldn't change a thing.

I use 2 egg whites, 2 tsp. vanilla, and 2 tsp. water in one gallon-size ziploc. The sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and a dash of salt go in the other bag. Shake the pecans into the egg-mix bag, then pour the sugar-mix bag right into the pecans/eggs. Pour onto cooking sprayed cookie sheet & bake as directed. Yum!!

Great tasting nuts and talk about addicting! We couldn't stop eating them. I followed some of the suggestions I read and used two egg whites instead of one. I can't say that I'll do that again. I felt the second egg white created an extra thick, candy-like coating on the nuts. I would have preferred a lighter coating. I also tried the suggestion of substituting vanilla extract for water. That suggestion I did like and will use again. Almond extract would work equally well.   I gave this recipe 4 star instead of 5 only because the cinnamon was hard to detect. I suggest increasing the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.    For a healthier alternative and to ease clean up, use parchment paper or a silicone liner instead of a greased baking sheet.

Easier than I thought it would be, just set your timer every 15 min. to stir.  Very tender and crunchy.  I used slightly more cinnamon.

REALLY easy recipe- I used 1 tsp. of vanilla instead of the water, as suggested. I also cut down the salt slightly, and insteased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. Also, I used 2 egg whites instead of 1. 
Make sure to put foil over your cookie sheet with cooking spray, or else you'll be scraping off the remains of the pecans afterward.
The pecans are good hot, warm, or cold.   The instructions on how to actually introduce the mixtures to the pecans is vague- First, dump all of the pecans in a medium bowl with the egg whites & vanilla and mix. Then transfer the pecans & mixture into the next bowl with the cinnamon/sugar/salt mixture. Mix longer in this bowl. Afterward, spread the pecans on the foil lined cookie sheet.

You know that relative that complains about everything and is never satisfied at any family gathering?  They (and everyone else) loved these and asked for the recipe.  No bigger compliment can be given.

I did use some of the other reviewers suggestions.  2 ziplock bags (one for the egg/water/vanilla mix & one for the sugar/cinnamon/salt mix) is a must & made clean up a cinch. Also, I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the tablespoon of water. 

Thank you so much for sharing!

Worked great, should note to dump all of the egg white dipped pecans into the sugar then dump the whole batch onto the cookie sheet.   I was trying to coat and remove several pieces - not worth the time.    These were delicious both warm and a few days later.    A tailgate keeper!

I mixed Pecans and Almonds together.  This recipe is great.  Next time I am going to leave out the Almonds though.  They didn't crunch up as much as the Pecans did.  The only thing is I think next time I will also add more sugar to the mix.  I'm thinking this will make a sweeter crunchier coating.

Love this recipe!  Simple and tasty.  Based off the other reviews, I upped the egg whites to two, and beat them to the soft peak stage before adding the pecans.  I also doubled the cinnamon.

Be sure to grease the pan and stir every 15 minutes!  Both these steps prevent sticking.  And let cool before eating, they get crisp that way.

Delicious! Used about 1 and 1/2 egg whites- 1tsp of cinammon, replaced 1/2 cup white sugar with light brown sugar , replaced half of the water with vanilla extract!  Threw the egg whites, water, and vanilla extract in 1 gallon plastic bag, added pecans to coat, then added salt, sugar, and cinammon.  Dumped it out on a baking sheet covered with wax paper, topped with a sprinkle of cinammon- sugar and cooked it as per instructions and it they turned out fabulous and what an easy clean up!!!!

Soooo delicious!  I followed other users and used 1 tsp. of cinnamon substituted vanilla for water added the extra egg white.  Using the gallon size zip lock bags for the egg mixture and the sugar mixture made it easier for clean up and to ensure the pecans got coated with the mixture. I also used Reynolds Non Stick foil to line my cookie sheet,  This made for such an easy clean up.  I took these to a party and everyone raved.  Even my friends who do not care for pecans loved them.

Ebony Loves Pecans! Made these for a Christmas Party! Not too hard to make but I think I exceeded the prep time. While getting ready for the party I mistakingly over baked them so they were a bit on the crispy (not burnt) side. I placed them in a festive bowl and called them "PECAN CHIPS". my guests couldn't stop eating them and requested the recipe and that I make more!

Super easy! Came out perfect I did of course up the temp to 300° and cook about 25 mins. I would say add a little more sugar and of course cinnamon for taste. Good recipe!

I just made this recipe.  The only adjustment I made was the amount of sugar. Iused 1/2 cup and it was fine. I don't like mine as sugared as the picture showed. I did mix the egg white with water and then threw everything in a bowl and mix it all together.  I used Chinese cinnamon which is more potent.  They are great.  This is a great way to save on buying the glazed packaged pecans for salads.  My pecans were $5.99 per pound. Packed is $4.99 for pecans w. cranberries. Which is only 6 oz. I'll just throw a handful of cranberries when I serve the salad.  Super Super Great.

I made this for snacks on the weekend for a get-together. However, they were all eaten before anyone came around! Everyone loved them. I've been 'asked' to make them again, but I'm doubling/tripling the recipe to give some away as gift for Christmas. I just use whatever nuts I have, and use chinese 5 spice instead of the cinnamon. I also use 2 egg whites for a single recipe. They are delicious and seriously addictive!! Rahtoys --  I freeze leftover egg yolks in zip lock bags, and then go hunting for recipes that will use them up eg: lime pie, sponge cake etc

All of the reviews are wonderful.  These have ot beat any pecans I have tasted.  I doubled the recipe (to freeze for later and they freeze perfectly) and used vanilla in the egg whites.  After whipping them I just poured all the pecans into the KA bowl and coated them then added the sugar mixture and poured them out onto two trays which I switched back and forth in the oven for each 15 minute cooking time.  PERFECT!

Love these!!  I use 2 egg white, 2 T of water, and a tsp of vanilla.  I mix these together in my kitchen aid, add the pecans to coat, and then add the sugar in 1 bowl.  Less mess and it works really well!!  We live near Hershey and my friends tell me these taste better than the kind you can buy at the park!

So easy; so good!  These took a little longer to "dry" in the oven.  I roasted them for at least 1/2 hour longer than stated.  I used my largest cookie sheet, but, being I dod a double batch--to use the entire Costco bag of pecans, they were touching each other.  Perhaps I should have used two large sheets.  It wasn't a big deal, and the end result was well worth the wait.  I'm bringing them to a New Year's Eve party, and my bet is that not one will remain!

Very good.  I also used SPLENDA and LESS of it than sugar, (I always find Splenda makes a recipe sweeter, maybe just me)
otherwise followed recipe as is.  The second batch I added dry mexica chili powder and it was even better, if possible. Thanks for good, tasty, easy recipe.

Fabulous! I add them to baby greens with gorgonzola, dried cranberries and raspberry vinagrette for a wonderful salad.  My kids eat them as a snack. A lot cheaper than buying them ready-made at the grocery store.

These are amazing. I give these for Christmas to co-workers and everyone always wants the recipe.  I use 1/2 cp white sugar and 1/2 cp light brown sugar. I sub pure vanilla extract for the water and use 1tsp of cinnamon. I also bake 15 min longer than the recipe suggests and find it gives them a little extra crunch.

Dont be fooled  by other recipes on this site  for sugar coarted pecans.  I thought  for sure  that more spices  would enhance the flavor  of the pecans  but this recipe  is by far the best (i've tried them all).  i made the same  changes   everyone has suggested ( sub vanilla for water and half brown/half white sugar)  Although the sub vanilla for water change works, I suggest sticking to white sugar  like  the original recipe says-  it tastes better.  Also  DO NOT  increase  the temp  to 400  as others have suggested to cut cooking time- stick to 250.  This is an easy way to BURN  your pecans- trust me,  i know from experience!!!

I used walnuts instead of pecans. I wish I had read the review which suggested that you use a bag to mix the nuts. They are delicious and I am having a hard time not eating them. The one thing that I added was about 1 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper to add a little spice.

recipe most like ones at the mall. I used 2 egg whites and 3/4 tsp. vanilla, beating till frothy. After coating the pecans in this mixture, I already had the sugar, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a gallon size storage bag and placed them in by handsful. Coated very well, then put on jellyroll pan with nonstick foil. YUMMY....am giving for gifts in cute containers.

Wow!  Warning: these are very addictive and disappear really quickly.  I made some for a party and had to pull them away from my dad because he was eating them at a rapid pace.  I also increased to 2 egg whites and 1 teaspoon cinnamon as suggested.  I stirred the pecans in the bowl with the whipped egg white mixture and then added sugar mixture to bowl and stirred again until evenly coated. Try them on a baby greens salad with sliced pears, dried cranberries, goat cheese and balsamic dressing. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I make these little things at least 2 times a month and believe me...they do not last long! I tend to use a little less pecans when I am making them as it tends to give what I have....alot better coating and sweetness. Try these....you will not be dissapointed.

Really amazing! I didn't have a full pound of pecans, so I used 1/2 pound pecans, 1 egg white, a little water, 1/3 cup sugar, and lots of yummy cinnamon and a dash of salt. They turned out really crisp and delicious. I put them on top of a salad with some goat cheese, apples, and balsamic vinaigrette. Yum!

This is the BEST recipe for sweet pecans. I have tried for years to find one that we liked. I order a case of pecans each Christmas and give them as gifts. Usually I make just the salted pecans, but we have a new favorite with this recipe. I used granulated sugar in one recipe and raw sugar in the next batch. Also tried adding vanilla as some have suggested. We think it's better with RAW sugar and with water (no vanilla). 1 teaspoon of King Arthur vietnamese cinnamon is perfect. They also freeze well. Thanks for this recipe. alllrecipes.com has become a favorite also!

These pecans are really good.  I can't stay out of them and they've only been out of the oven for a short time.  I used 2 egg whites and added some vanilla.  I really whipped my egg whites so they were nice and frothy before I added the pecans.  When they were well coated I added the sugar/cinnamon to the same bowl and mixed it up.  I did add more cinnamon than called for but I didn't measure it.  Probably well over a teaspoon.  Make sure you have a large enough baking sheet so that the pecans are in a single layer.  You don't want them all stuck together.  I'm guessing these will be prepared quite often around here.  They're delicious.

Awesome recipe!  I often use a mixture of pecans, almonds, walnuts and/or peanuts....very attractive, as well as tasty.  We also prefer using some vanilla and a little extra cinnamon. Family and friends love receiving these as a gift!

I got rave reviews for these! I made these to sprinkle on top of my salad for Easter Dinner, however, my husband and sis-in-law couldn't stop eating them straight out of the bowl. The method seems strange but they turn out delicious. One tip: they may still seem chewy when you take them out of the oven but once they cool the will harden into a wonderful crunch.

Oh, my...I followed a few of the suggestions, such as using extracts in the egg whites instead of water and using 2 egg whites. I used 1 teaspoon of rum extract and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Really super good!

Fantastic and so easy.  Followed some recommendations from others and used 2 egg whites, 2 tsp water, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Mixed everything in the same bowl.  First whipped up wet ingredients, added pecans and mixed and then added the dry ingredients that I had mixed together.  Poured all on no stick tin foil on a cookie sheet, set oven at 300 and in less than an hour they were done.  Had to hide them so we wouldn't eat them all before Thanksgiving.   Will make a double batch for Christmas.

so yummy and easy to make! people will think you slaved over them! i used pure vanilla extract instead of water, doubled the cinnamon and added 1/2 teaspoon of all spice. instead of greasing the baking pan i lined with tin foil (easy clean-up). i also used a large ziploc bag for sugar mixture...very easy to coat nuts by shaking them up! finished product goes great in little treat bags...received many compliments! double recipe for 2lbs of nuts (costco sells pecans in 2lb bags).

I thought this was really good, especially straight from the oven. I do think that I will put less salt in next time because it  came out a little salty for me. Otherwise it was great.

So simple, yet everyone raves over these!  Definitely addicting, too.  I always stock up when pecans are on sale specifically to make these.  They're also great to freeze and have on hand for impromptu guests!

I brought these pecans to an Oscar party I attended and everyone loved them!  I did make the changes suggested by other reviewers - 2 egg whites instead of one, slightly decreased the salt, and increased the cinnamon by 3-4 times the recipe amount.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

These are super.  I followed the other recommendations-2 egg whites-more cinnamon-less salt and a splash of vanilla. I did find it easier to use the non-stick foil when baking them. Nothing stuck!!

I have made this in the past and they came out wonderful! Delicious...almost too delicious. I recently followed an easier recipe. Pecans (2Cups), Confectioners sugar (1/2C), cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp), water (4tsp). Mix sugar, cayenne pepper, pecans. Add water and mix till sugar is gone and it's all liquid. Pour onto Parchment paper lined cookie sheet. Bake 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Done. Take the parchment paper off of cookie sheet as soon as it comes out of the oven. Break up the candied pieces when cooled and store in an air-tight bag. I left kosher salt out of the recipe. I don't find it adds much and don't need the salt but you may find it's missing.

You don't notice the cayenne pepper while eating it...at all. But as soon as you have swallowed it, you know it was there. I don't like hot and this is fine for me. Delicious.

Just delicious!  Following other reviewers I used two egg whites, two teaspoons of water and one teaspoon of vanilla.  I'm always looking for the quickest, easiest method so after adding the pecans to the egg whites I just dumped the sugar mixture into the bowl, mixed thoroughly and spread them on a baking sheet.  They turned out perfect and no wasting zip lock bags.

Amazing! I went with the following review suggestions: 2 egg whites, instead of 1 Tbs. Water, use 2 tea. water + 1 tea. vanilla, 1 tea. cinnamon. Also, I loved using one bowl for everything and just adding the sugar in three or four parts and mixing in. These are PERFECT as stated above. Next time I am going to try parchment paper (my pan was a hard coated mess after) and also maybe adding a little more aromatic spices like 1/4 tea. cloves and 1/4 tea. allspice.

This recipe is great! It is perfect for holiday snacks. I like to double the ingredients except for the pecans and they get twice the coating for an even sweeter snack!  Brilliant!

I followed this recipe exactly as written. I think it is perfect as is especially since I put it in a salad. The nuts were sweet but it finished with a salt flavor which was great. Next time for putting in a salad I will skip the cinnamon, but my husband did like the cinnamon. But they are fantastic to snack on as a special treat and so easy and quick!

Absolutely delicious. I made these as a hostess gift for a dinner party. I followed the suggestions from other members and made it with 2 egg whites, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. Follow the instructions as written and add the vanilla at the same time as the water. These look professional, taste great and are a fun thank you gift.

I followed this basic method but used mixed nuts (leaving out the salt) and added cayenne pepper for a kick.  We loved them!  The few that were left after snacking, I tossed in a salad.  Terrific!  Will make again...and will experiment with other spices.

Great recipe!  Huge hit at my latest family gathering.  Thanks for all the tips.  I kept the recipe the same, though, except substituting vanilla for the water.  Yumm!

I love this recipe ...and have made it 4 times in three days.  I too changed the recipe a bit ... adding 1 tsp cinnamon and a splash of pumpkin pie spice in the sugar mix, then using two egg whites (large eggs) and 3/4 tsp Boyjan orange oil and two full teaspoons of Madagascar Bourbon vanilla.  I used non-stick foil one time (messy) Crisco greased aluminum pan the second time ... (cooked faster 15-15-10-10) then finally used a new non-stick pan which was heavier.  The third time cooked even faster, so watch what you use.  My family loves pecans so this year they are in luck.  Good Luck and Thank You Carolyn for this great recipe.

These are great! I took away some of the water and added a touch of vanilla. I think Bourbon instead of water might be a good twist as well. Thanks for sharing!

These are the fist sugar coated nuts I've made.  They were very delicious and not overly sweet.  I used only 1/4 tsp. cinnamon instead of 1/2 tsp. and got a hint of cinnamon, which is just what I wanted.  Beware - they are addicting!

I followed others' suggestions, using two egg whites, extra cinnamon, and a mix of vanilla and water - and doing it all in my mixing bowl for less mess. I used a little more than a pound of pecans. This time (because they were so delicious, this is a more-than-one-time affair!), on top of all of the above changes, I grated some orange peel into the egg whites. I love it! It's a subtle addition, to be sure - not as punchy as vanilla - but it makes the scent as it wafts out of your oven even better, and it adds another layer of flavor to the pecans. Try it - you won't be disappointed!

I LOVE this recipe. Thank you Carolyn for sharing it. I made these to go with my Gorgonzola Salad and they turned out amazing! I changed the recipe a little. I added 1 1/2 tsp. powedered double strength vanilla in with the dry ingredients and I doubled the amount of cinnamon. Of course you can add 2 tsp. of vanilla to the egg/water mixture and it would turn out just fine. I love how the sugar carmelized and baked on the pecans. So many people ended just snacking on the nuts instead of them accompanying my salad. Thanks again for sharing this gem of a recipe!

What takes an hour to make an fifteen minutes to disappear?  :)  I took these to a halloween party and they were gone almost as soon as I got them there.  Per the advice of many, I used two egg whites, 1 tsp of vanilla and a full tsp f cinnamon.  (I may up that to a tsp and a half.)  Also for kicks I added a squirt of maple syrup.  Someone mentioned mixing everything together with a ziplock bag instead of a bowl - this is a good, clean, effective idea. When done cooking, I also spread the nuts on a sheet of wax paper for a good hour to allow to regain their crunchiness.

This is definitely a 10 star recipe for both taste and ease.  As per other reviewers I used 2 egg whites, 1tbsp vanilla with 1 tsp water and added extra cinnamon to taste.  

I put wet ingredients in a large ziplock, added pecans, mushed it up until all pecans were coated and then dumped the dry ingredients in the same bag and tossed it around again..no dishes!!

These tasted good out of the oven, but once cooled and the coating had hardened the flavors were amazing.  Put these out for Thanksgiving company and were gobbled up.  Will buy some decorative jars this Christmas, make a double batch and give these away for little Christmas gifts to friends!!

Thanks for the great recipe

These are absolutely scrumptous. I did substitute brown sugar for the white though.  And you definitely need to make more than 1 lb if you have more than 6 people. They went in a heartbeat.

Followed the recipe. Super easy to make.
These tasted great. I have used this recipe with almonds also. I made these for a teen party of sixteen people and the nuts were all eaten halfway through the evening. Very good recipe!

I've made these every Christmas to rave reviews. However, I beat TWO egg whites till stiff, add the one cup of (white) sugar, no salt or spice, but I DO coat the cookie sheet with a stick of melted(salted) butter and spread the nut mixture over it. Bake at 325* for a half hour, turning every ten minutes.  DELICIOUS!

While these were very tasty, I would really kick up the cinnamon next time. I substituted almond extract for the water. Also, for a whole pound of pecans I needed two egg whites. A tip for the lady who said hers clumped when mixing, make sure when you transfer the nuts onto the baking sheet you don't bring along extra sugar. In the places where I had globs of sugar it was a gooey mess. I wrapped these in fabric bags, put them in a flamingo glass, wrapped again in cellophane and tied with a ribbon - great little thank you gift!

These are great!  I made them specifically as a sundae topping (vanilla ice cream w/ hot caramel sauce...yum!)  And they are fantastic just by themselves!  Can't wait to chop them up and put them on top of a grilled chicken caesar salad! I tried other reviewers suggestions and used two egg whites, added vanilla and extra cinnamin. Next time, I think I will use only one egg white...two egg whites made the sugar mixture runnier than I think it should have been...a lot of the mixture ran off onto the baking pan, therefore I don't think the pecans were quite as well-coated and sweet as they should have been, but still very delicious!

Simple preparation and exceptional taste!  Like previous posters, I substituted vanilla for water, decreased the salt, and increased the cinnamon.  I used almonds instead of pecans, which decreased the cost significantly.  For an intriguing aroma and flavor, try adding a bit of ground cardamom -- it adds an amazing complexity.

I just have one suggestion. ..
If u toast the pecans 1st, in a 350 oven for 7 min. Then let cool before u start the process of coating them w/egg whites and sugar. ..they will be more crunchy :)
And I also add  =pts raw almonds (toasted) small pretzel Stix (I break them in 1/2) and dried cranberries to the mix.
Makes a great trail mix this way ;)
Yummy

Such a great taste and so simple to make. I make 4 pounds of pecans every Christmas. Everyone just loves them and can't get enough.

I've never been a big fan of pecans until I found this recipe. These pecan are absolutely wonderful and so easy to make! I used vanilla  instead of water along with one egg white,4 cups pecan halves, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 cup sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon. Other members may have complained about the salt content but one teaspoon was perfect for me. It gave the pecans a buttery flavor and I love sweet and salty together. I will be making these often.

You have to be kidding me... these are so easy and SOOOOO good!  I wanted glazed nuts for a salad, but couldn't find them at the store, so I made this recipe.  I used an 8oz bag of pecans, but left all the other measurements the same.  I stirred the pecans into the bowl with the egg whites, then added the sugar mixture in two batches.  Like I said, SO EASY!  They're dangerously good!!

Just made these tonight for fun...they are absolutely delicious. I will definately be giving these as gifts in decorated mason jars for Christmas this year! I expected they would be yummy...but this recipe was so easy and exceeded my expectations. Only question...does anyone happen to know how long they will keep?

Simple, straightforward recipe. Mixed all ingredients in same bowl. Per review recommendations, 1) used 2 tsp. water & 1 tsp. vanilla, 2) increased cinnamon to 1 tsp.

I have made these many times with the changes of vanilla for the amount of water, a full teaspoon of cinnamon, and 2 egg whites instead of one, with the normal amount of salt.  It gets raves every time...but this time I did one more thing that made a difference: I had no pan spray in the house and used melted butter instead to grease the pan.  It actually made for a better, richer flavor than before.  Give it a try!  Thanks to Carolyn and everyone here for such a great recipe.

This recipe is by far the easiest, tastiest thing I've ever made! I used vanilla instead of water. I live in a high altitude, so I did bake mine at 275 for 1 1/2 hrs. They are salty yet sweet, nice and crunchy. I loooovvvveeeee this recipe. No longer will I spend $12 for a mere pound of these when I can make them myself!!

I made these today to use in the Eat Michigan Salad I'm making tomorrow, and of course I had to sample to make sure they were fit to eat ;-)  Wow!  I've made a lot of sugared nuts in my time, but these were the absolute BEST!  I hope I can keep enough for the salad!  Thanks for the recipe!

Like Mary said, you can add the nuts and sugar mix right to the same bowl. Stir it up and dump on a cookie sheet. I use "Pamed" foil. Clean up is easier.

Ahhh-mazing! I used vanilla instead of water, I may have baked it just a couple of minutes less than an hour, and I used almost double the cinnamon the recipe called for. These came out so good! They're pretty, and they're super delicious and sweet. Yumm (:

I used to love getting roasted pecans from vendors at flea markets and the mall back home.
Seeing this recipe made me trying it thinking about those pecans and I have to say, they are right on :) I made 8 oz of these babies and they were devoured well after they came out of the oven! Everyone should try making these, super super easy! :)

This is exactly like my grandma's recipe, I prefer to use a half teaspoon of salt when I make these. We usually can always find these yummy pecans at Christmas, but good year round and even add other nuts.

These are good, no doubt.  Very similar to what you'd get at a fair.  We followed others' advice and used vanilla ILO water and 2 egg whites.  Glad we did that.  Still, while good, these are a little tame. Next time would double the cinnamon and maybe, for the right occassion, add a touch of cayenne pepper.

Very good.  Not the best I've had so I didn't rate it 5 stars, but everyone loved them.

Excellent recipe BUT NOT conducive to doubling (or more).  The system allows you to set it for more servings and will tell you how much you will need, but you need to do it in the original one-batch instructions.  I tried to make 4 batches and found that doing so left my first two batches overcoated with egg white froth and therefore I needed more to finish the other two batches.  But the recipe is excellent when done in the original one-batch instructions!

I made these with mammoth pecans, and they look impressive!  They are scrumptious, made with vanilla instead of water and increasing the cinnamon to 1 tsp. as others have suggested.  Next time I'm also going to add Mapeleine, a maple-flavored extract to tweak it up a bit.  I use these in a field green, mandarin orange & candied pecan salad with raspberry walnut vinagrette, similar to Marie Callender's.  Also will add Craisins or pomegranate for color.

Very easy. I made it in 2, gallon sized bags. 2 egg white, 1 tablespoon and a splash of Vanilla, 1 cup sugar, 3/4 tsp salt and 2 heaping tsp of cinnamon.   Tastes just like the type you buy from the "hot nuts" vendors.

Awesome! Made them exactly as stated and turned out great. Everyone assumed they were super hard to make and raved about them. I think I'll make a few more batches for holiday gifts. Thanks for the recipe!

These are crunchy and VERY tasty.  I increase the amount of cinnamon to AT LEAST two tsp... strong cinnamon flavor that doesn't swamp the pecan taste.  I also modified the recipe for other flavors: orange, cherry, raspberry, butter, and rum, just to name a few.  They taste GREAT!

Great Recipe!! These are wonderful, i made them after reading quite a few reviews and they are deffently a five star. The only thing that I did different was I used a teaspoon of cinnamon. My children loved them. Also it makes your house smell wonderful while they are cooking. Thanks for such a great recipe.

Just like all other reviewers a definite "5" star.  This is so easy and they are absolutely delicious.  I took the suggestion of others and used 2 egg whites and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  They are now sitting in an airtight container ready for future use.  YUM!

Incredible!! I did go with the suggestions. I used 2 egg whites, 2 tsp. of water and 1 tsp. of vanilla. I added the peacans to the frothy egg whites, water and vanilla and then just folded in the sugar, salt and cinn. They turned out so good I have plans to make them as gifts for the holidays. Thanks for the recipe!!

I've been making these for two years now and they are always a HUGE hit.  We eat them almost nightly by sprinkling a few on top of our garden salads for a bit of sweet!  I package these up for Christmas and hand them out with our cookie platter as well, now it is a welcomed favorite.  My only tips - buy the two pound bag of pecan halves at Costco (much less expensive) ... never skimp on the cinnamon (I usually add a heaping teaspoon for a double batch) and make sure to "stir" every 15 minutes!  Enjoy!

These are delicious and… hey, where’d they go?! I have used this recipe on four or five occasions and I find that I get the best coverage by putting the nuts in a ziplock bag - adding the egg mixture – shaking vigorously – and then adding the sugar/cinnamon mixture and shaking the bag until the nuts are evenly covered. These are best after about two days in the fridge because they become extra crunchy, but lord knows they probably won’t be around that long!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS..make sure they are airtight though, they get a little soft in just a Glad storage box...maybe put in a ziplock bag and then the storage box.

A big hit! Very addictive. I took the advice of one reviewer and put the sugar and cinnamon in with the egg white. They turned out fantastic, BUT I don't think I'll do it that way again. Mostly because they didn't look super tasty. I think they might look better doing it the way the original instructions say. And clean up might be easier too. But super tasty regardless.

This recipe is so good, everyone that has tried them loves them.  The recipe is great as is, but for the second batch I added a little vanilla extract to the egg white mix and it was also really great.  Thanks so much for sharing!

These are fantastic! They are great to just munch on, and I've also put them in salads. Whenever I've made these I've gotten a lot of compliments. The salad I like them most in is: Spinach leaves, cut-up apples, raisens and craisens, blue cheese and these pecans. I top with a Raspberry Vinagrette. SO good!

5 stars easily! YUM! I followed the suggestions of others and used 2 egg whites, mostly vanilla for liquid (just about a 1/2 tsp of water) and used gallon-sized zip lock bags for egg and sugar mixture. (Great tip by the way!) My house smells WONDERFUL!! Can't wait to share these yummy treats.

i also used vanilla instead of water. my oven tends to be inconsistant, but i noticed that if i'm uncertain as whether they are done, i pull the pan and stir it one final time. if the pecans separate from one another easily, they are finished. if they still cling together the least bit, they need about two more minutes. wonderful aroma throughout the house.

My husband was supposed to get me pecan halves and he came back from the store with pieces. I used them anyway and added them to the chocolate scotcheroos I was making. I still have alot leftover so I froze some and gave some to my FIL (who really liked them). Next time I will try with the pecan halves (though pecans are REALLY expensive---8 dollars for a lb. bag. I miss where I used to live---we could go out and pick them up for free, except them I had to crack and hull them, lots of work, LOL) Thanks so much for the post!

These little babies were delicious! I made them ahead of time and then layered them on top of a sweet potato pie underneath mini marshmallows. Some of the glaze melted while it was in the oven and made the most scrumptious topping you could imagine. I got raves from family and friends and was asked to make it every holiday! 
We had about a quarter pound of the pecans left over and they were gone within the day. Excellent recipe.

mmmmmm! these are so addictive, and i don't even like pecans! i find that substituting splenda in any sugared-nut recipe seems to produce a better texture-and they don't get soggy! trust me, i didn't believe it could make a big difference either. but this is one piece of mother-in-law advice i don't regret taking :)

OK I have made these so many times is not even funny.  But my last batch hit the ball out of the park.  Instead of cinnamon I used cayenne pepper for a twist and add them to my salad.  Oh may GOD.  They combination of sweet and hot was spectacular.  I also follow previous revious and used a ziploc with the egg-wash and parchment paper to bake them.  They are delish!!!

I used almonds instead of pecans(just my taste)but I also added a little vanilla and used brown sugar. Still a great recipe,worth the wait.

I was waiting to find a recipe like these.  I can never find these to purchase and have loved them every time I've tried them.  This recipe is excellent and tastes just like the gourmet ones I've bought and costs a lot less money to make!

I was hoping these would taste like the pecans I get every year at a trade show, and they do! I followed the advice of others and substituted 1T vanilla for the water, added a little extra cinnamon, a  touch of nutmeg, and used 2 egg whites.  I was prepared for this recipe to quite messy, but it really wasn't. I will definitely be making these again!

This was very easy to make, and the nuts turned out delicious!  The first two times I stirred them I was afraid the recipe would turn out bad because they seemed too wet.  However, by the time the hour was up, they were nice and crunchy and evenly sugar-coated.  And with spraying the cookie sheet with non-stick spray, cleanup was a breeze as well.  Will definitely make these again!

Wow! What a delectable and easy recipe!  I made a double batch on two cookie sheets; I used three egg whites instead of two for the double recipe; I did increase the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp. for the double batch; and they came out perfectly.  I used Pam on the cookie sheets, and there was no sticking at all--no need for foil lining.  The pecans were soft while they were still warm, which was a bit troubling, but they cooled to a sugary crunch.  I'll use this recipe again and again--for Christmas gifts, for brunch buffets, for our church hospitality table.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

These were so good. The pecans stayed crispy and tasty a couple of days after they were made. Followed others suggestion and increased cinnamon to 3/4 tsp. Make it, eat it, enjoy it.

Great recipe; easy to make.  I chop them and add them to a kale salad (that is, if I can avoid eating them).  They are pretty hard to resist.

I also have mixed in cayanne to give them a kick, and sometimes curry (depending on how I use them).

I make 1/2 pound at a time, and use one egg white, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp sale, almost 1/2 tsp cinnamon.

They make wonderful gifts; just buy some food-approved papers bags with a nice wire top closure.

These could be addicting!  I made some to give as a hostess gift and "Stole" a few for me to taste.  They are delicious!  I am making another batch right now - for us.  Several years ago my son made candied pecans in a cooking class and we liked them a lot.  I lost the recipe, but these are far better.  We will add these to our holiday "goodies" for sure!

So easy to make and turned out great! We buy these at the Renaissance Faire every year and now I can make them at home! I'll be making these a lot! I put parchment paper down on the cookie sheet to make it easier to stir them (and no washing cookie sheets later).

I made these and followed the recipe with minor changes. I doubled the cinnamon. When I mixed the cinnamon-sugar mixture, I tasted it and could barely pick up the cinnamon flavor. Did not use bags, just mixed in two separate bowls. They turned out perfect! My hubby is in heaven and they're almost gone. I read several reviews first and decided to go with the writers original first, but just a bit more cinnamon, will be making these a lot and my friends and family can expect these at all the holiday get togethers.

Made these last night mixing the coated pecans and sugar mixture in one bowl and they turned out prefect.  They are gone now and we lovingly named them "Pecan Crack".

These so good. You can vary the flavor by substituting cayenne, masala seasoning, pumpkin pie spice mix, or just about anything else you want. We're going to try mixing baking cocoa with the sugar, we'll update how it works.

I have been making this recipe for the past few years.  I make it exactly as the recipe calls for, except I don't grease the pan, I use parchment paper.  As long as you stir them frequently, they shouldn't stick together.   1 egg white is perfect for 1 lb of nuts.  I also find they are usually ready after 40 minutes.  I put them in a nice container to give as Christmas gifts.  I get many compliments and they are highly addictive!

Nothing needs to be changed with this recipe.  It's Great.
No need for a mixer, zip bag.  Just a large bowl and a big spoon for mixing.
When you add vanilla instead of water, it becomes another recipe called, "Texas Glazed Pecans".  
I have added 1/2 TBL of Chipotle powder (for the original recipe) on some of the batches.  Awesome results if you like them a bit spicy.
It's very important to stir, turn over and spread out the pecans every 15min of the baking time.

These are fabulous. Just made them for a party this week but now I'm afraid they won't last because we can't seem to stop eating them! I doubled this recipe and used a combo of pecans and whole cashews, other than that I didn't change any of the ingredients. I didn't bother to use separate bowls - just added the nuts and then the sugar mixture right into my kitchenaid mixer bowl after I whipped the egg whites and water. Worked perfectly.

My kids and I get cinnamon roasted pecans every time we go to Navy Pier. Now we can make them at home. This recipe is delicious and easy to make. I only needed one egg white, but I doubled the cinnamon (as others suggested). Will be making this again!

I made this recipe using salted party peanuts and substituted Splenda for the sugar. I omitted the cinnamon & added 8 drops of Toffee flavoring & 4 drops of butter flavoring to the egg whites. These are very good. There are sooo many options possible with this recipe and I will use it often. Yummy!  :-D

These are SO Good!! I was a little dubious as I spread the lumpy gooey mess across my baking tray, but now, (roughly) an hour later the pecans are crunchy, sweet and delicious and I can't stop eating them!

like another reviewer, I beat 2 egg whites, 1.5 tbsp water, and 1 tsp vanilla in my stand mixer. then, I mixed in the pecans, and gradually stirred in the sugar mixture. after baking as directed, they were FANTASTIC! and, I really don't even like pecans.

So good!  I think the real secret here is the salt.  I love the sweet and salty combination.  I don't think it would hurt to double the cinnamon, but you certainly don't have to.

These are amazing! Based on other reviews, I used only 1-1/2 tsp water and added  1-1/2 tsp vanilla; didn't want the vanilla to be too strong. I also used the zip-lock bags for coating the pecans with the egg wash, then added the cinnamon-sugar to the baggie to coat; worked very well!

awesomely yummy! I mixed the finished product woth melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and it added about three more stars to the rating! Delicious. I keep them in a ziplock in my freezer and they are perfect for snacking.

Oh my!  These are fantastic.  Brought them to a friend as a hostess gift last night and they were a hit.  I did follow one reviewer's advice and simply stirred the sugar mixture into the bowl of pecans and egg whites a third at a time.  Worked just great.  Also used parchment paper on my baking sheet and sprayed it lightly with cooking spray.

These are amazing.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and added vanilla to the water (1 teaspoon), and doubled the cinnamon.  I had trouble stopping from eating them right off the tray.  I plan to use them crushed on top of cookies, but I may have to make another batch because these might be gone!  Delicious.  I think they'd be great on ice cream with caramel too.

I followed this recipe to a T. Although I read others reviews to add another egg white, I didn't use 2 and dont feel it needs a extra. They were wonderful and my whole family loved them. They taste really close to the ones I buy at the mall. They are really easy to make, and I am baking some more as I write the review for Thanksgiving tomorrow but using Splenda instead of sugar for my diebetic mom. I will update my review once I hear from everyone on how those come out.

I just made these and all I can say is WOW!!! I took some of the other suggestions and used 2 egg whites, 1 tbsp vanilla instead of the water, and 1 tsp of cinnamon. I shook them in gallon sized bags and it worked wonderfully. I'll will be giving these as gifts this holiday season. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

These were amazing! I have made these multiple times and experiment with combining ingredients. My favorite is a sweet and spicy variation-add about 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper (depending on your heat preference), 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and leave out the cinnamon! Absolutely wonderful!

I just finished making these for a fruit salad that we are having for Easter dinner...they might not make it to the fruit salad.  My daughter and I keep grabbing a few everytime we walk by them.  This recipe is a keeper.  I only had 1/2 cup of pecans, so I cut the sugar mixture in half and it was perfect.  Thanks,

I have to say - I'm not a huge pecan fan but these are AMAZiNG!  I made them for my DH and a salad I'm taking to a party.  I had no idea I'd love them too!  Sheesh...these things are going to get me in trouble.  Yum, yum!!!  Thanks Carolyn!!!

I have to thank Carolyn for such a wonderful recipe! I made this for Thanksgiving to give everyone something to snack on and all were raving how good they were. This was a great recipe and also a great base to use to make other types of coated nuts. I.e: Spicy pecans, walnuts, and cashews. Just followed the directions but instead of the cinnamon I added a 2 and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, 2 and 1/2 teaspoon garlic, 1 teaspoon cayenne, 1 teaspoon paprika.

I did NOT think these would be mediocre, but I also didn't know they would be SO good!  My husband loves them-and I was so surprised at how yummy they tasted~ We will make them again and again.  Easy, easy and great for snack or giveaways during the holidays!

This is an excellent recipe for holiday snacking.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out wonderful.  Next time I will double the batch as they go quickly.

I doubled the recipe and tweaked it the first time I made it by using double the cinnamon and pinches of cloves and allspice.  That was not enough spice for me!  Even though I received nice compliments on the nuts, I felt I only tasted nuts and no spice.  So, for the second batch I made, I increased the spice!  I didn't officially measure anything, but approximately 3+ tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cloves, 1 tsp allspice, and 1 tsp ginger.  Even with the increases of the spices, I think the outcome is still 'light' spice.  In this second batch, I did a double of the pecans, and then another batch of almonds.  The almonds were fine, but I like how the nooks/crannies of the pecans hold the sugar/spice better!  Otherwise, I had no problems making them; I baked them on parchment paper and that made for easy clean up!  Looking forward to giving these away as Christmas treats!

These were absolutely wonderful!!  Instead of using pecan halves, I chopped my pecans and then used them on top of my pumpkin cheesecake and it gave the cheesecake an amazing extra touch!

Excellent!  However, as other's have said, it DEFINITELY needs more cinnamon in it!  I did add a bit more but it was still not enough.  Would need closer to 1 tsp anyway.  I also did add a bit of vanilla.

5 Stars. These are just like the store bought ones you can buy at Cracker Barrel that are sooo good. I did make a few alterations...I added 1 full tsp of ground cinnamon and used 1 tsp of vanilla versus the water. Perfection! I also used my kitchen aid to whip up the egg white/vanilla, poured pecans in, stirred until all coated, then just poured in the sugar mixture and stirred. No need to use the ziploc bag method.  AWESOME PECANS!

These were very tasty. Gobbled up by everyoneand everyone raved about them. I used vanilla instead of water and 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 white sugar. Ive already given the recipe to 4 people including 2 of my supervisors who are taking them home to their wives!

I make a very simple, potentially strange-sounding fruit salad, just canned mixed fruit (drained), an extra jar of maraschino cherries (drained), and 8 oz. sour cream.  Mix and serve, it's tasty and simple... but it wants a little crunch, a little texture.  Hence the pecans, prepared just as directed and left to sit for several hours or overnight - if you add it to the fruit salad too soon, the coating melts away, but somehow it holds onto its coating better if it has some time to think about it.  A perfect bit of crunch and sweet!

**UPDATE** This is a staple recipe in my house. I ALWAYS have a batch of these in the freezer to throw on salads or eat for snacks. SO yummy. ***I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could! I followed the recipe exactly except subbed vanilla for the water. My husband, after trying them, could not stop talking about them and kept saying "wow!" He instantly started brainstorming about who we could give these to as a gift, and said they are even better than the ones you buy at the fair! Will definitely make again and again!!

I made these as gifts for coworkers for Christmas.  They were very good and eaten up quickly!  I made a second batch with about a 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of white and added some nutmeg and extra cinnamon and vanilla.  It seemed the brown sugar made the coating thicker and crunchier.  I liked both equally as well.  I'm giving it 4 stars because they were very, very sweet for my taste and I would probably prefer Spiced Pecans over these, but they were still great!  Also, there was a great deal of the sugar mixture leftover in the pans - which I think you could use as a topping for many desserts.  Overall - they are very good, too heavily coated for my preference for nuts and very unhealthy, BUT most people will love them.

These pecans are PERFECT!  Made a triple batch and the only thing I changed is I subsituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar, and I added equal parts of vanilla and water. Deee-licious!

Very, very easy recipe. Followed directions, but upped the oven to 300 degrees and used parchment paper, NO STICKING! Very good! Will send these to work with my son for Christmas. Tasted better than the plain glazed, and easier. Using egg white is not a big deal. Used the hand mixer for the egg white. Will definitely make these, all year long! Now, to add different flavors!

i made these quite a few years ago from a similar recipe....i didn't read the recipe correctly & beat the egg white till stiff & proceeded....they came out great that way too...if i remember correctly i turned the oven way down (like for baking meringues) because they were looking odd at some point...after a while i turned the oven off & let them dry out...they came out more like candy....i never realized i made a mistake until the next time i read the recipe...lol

I did what another person suggested and used 2 eggs whites, 2 tsp. water and 1 tsp. vanilla. (I left out the cinnamon because I wasn't wanting that flavor in what I was using the pecans for.) These pecans are perfect! I had to quickly store the cooled nuts so that my husband and I wouldn't eat them all in one day!

These are great!!  Note to self: double the cinnamon to 1 tsp and increase salt to 1 tsp. Also use 2 tsp water and 1 tsp vanilla with the one egg white.

For 1 and 1/2 lb (6 cups pecans), I upped it to 2 egg whites. Also added 1 TBSP vanilla (as others suggested) and more cinnamon. The key to this great recipe is definitely the low temp and stirring it every 15 minutes for an hour, and every 3-5 minutes after that if needed to get the nuts dry. Other recipes call for a much hotter oven for less time, and reviewers are often sad that their goodies burned. Thanks!

I followed the recipe except I only had half a pound of pecans so I halved everything but the egg and cinnamon (actually I used Pumpkin Pie Spice)since I love it and this was awesome. I'm not sure why I buy them now..lol.

These are soooo good!  I can't believe I can make these right out of my kitchen.  So easy, too!  I followed the recommendations to use two egg whites and 1 tsp vanilla + 2 tsp water.  I also followed the tip to add the sugar right into the bowl of pecans little by little and mixing.  Yummy!

Sweet salty and crunchy...and the house smells sooo good while its cooking!  Great for the holidays.  I used the delux nut mix, like one of the other reviewers.  This is a keeper.

Amazing! Brought these to many parties this year, an absolute hit every time! Everyone wanted the recipe! Great to keep pecans on hand because it's so easy to make to bring to a last minute dinner party or to a friends house! My favorite recipe on recipes.com!!!

I made these with mixed nuts, doubled the cinn and they came out excellent.   (I did the egg white and vanilla mixture and kept adding nuts until they were all evenly coated (probably 1.5lb) and then added the sugar mixture - less stuff to clean!). Only item at a potluck which was completely gone! Everyone thought they were store bought! When I said I made them everyone asked for the recipe.  Next time I made with Splenda - very good, nice coating, but not as good as with the real sugar.

Ohhh my goodness. These are so addictive. I just made a batch and I can't stop eating them! I used vanilla extract instead of water, and used one part white sugar and one part brown sugar instead of all white sugar. I did, however reduce the sugar mixture by 1/3 and it still tastes unbelievably sweet and amazing (1/3 cup white & 1/3 cup brown sugars). This is a fantastic recipe.

followed the suggestions by replacing water with vanilla, and used half white, half brown sugar also. It was the longest hour waiting for them to be done but I snuck a few out ahead of time and they were soo good. They taste like the ones from the mall. My only suggestion, make a double batch cause they arent going last!

I love these nuts!! I did do the 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar & vanilla instead of water as suggested. My sons, who don't like nuts, I found them eating them by the handful. Thank You for sharing

I made these for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit - I had people asking me for the recipe.  I doubled the recipe, took some others advice and used vanilla instead of water, 4 egg whites and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  It was so easy to make and I plan to make it more for the holidays.

On my first batch I did what was suggested by substituting vanilla for water.  It was a good decision because the batch was so terrific I was asked if I had though of selling them to make a profit!  WOW...that really didn't enter my mind until it was mentioned to me!  CHAAAAACHING!

I use much more cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice to really make them holiday spicy.  The original recipe just isn't spicy enough for my taste.  I make these for  holiday gifts each year and people ALWAYS ask for the recipe. For a change up, I have also made these adding in other types of nuts such as walnuts, dry roasted peanuts and macadamias...super good!

Delicious! My husband told me they were "dangerous" because he couldn't stop eating them! I did use mostly vanilla, and just a little water for the 1 T water, I can't imagine leaving out the great flavor of vanilla. DEFINITELY use foil in the pan, because it gets pretty crusty (eliminate a cleaning step!) Oh- just a random hint- I sampled one that flew out of the pan when I was turning them at the 45 minute mark... it was not good! It was chewy & I was nearly dissapointed! So my advice for the samplers is to wait until the full hour is up, let them cool, and you'll be glad you made this yummy snack!

I have to add something to my review below - I served these today to nibble on before/after Thanksgiving dinner. My husband, aka the world's pickiest eater, was attacking them like they're candy! He asked me where I bought them - I was SO happy to say "I didn't buy them, I made them!" He actually looked surprised and said "You made them this way?!" and promptly grabbed another handful! Score one for wifey! LOL
WOW are these amazing!! Pecans are my absolute favorite nut and this recipe just made them even better! I just made a pound tonight for Thanksgiving but I'm not sure they're going to make it! I may be making another batch Wednesday night! 
The only change I made was to use 2 egg whites, and 2 tsp of water and 1 tsp of vanilla. Just enough vanilla to give a hint to the flavor but not overpowering. Positively addicting!

..We absolutely love these pecans.  I made them to give as gifts for moms day and they were happily received.  I ended up using 2 egg whites, just whisked them by hand in a chilled bowl then spooned them into the cinnamon sugar mixture (I also doubled the cinnamon).  Prepared my pan with buttered parchment and baked until nearly dry.  Once cooled the finished product is superb!  We nibbled on these with our coffee at the end of a glorious day spent with family and friends...thanks Carolyn.

I have made these twice, first at Christmas and then again at Easter. I made them for my father in law who is diabetic, so I used Splenda. Needless to say I am now his FAVORITE daughter in law!!! Make sure to increase to 2 egg whites, use the parchment paper and ziplock bag, much easier!!  I have done pecans, cashews and peanuts, all work great!!!

These are awesome and addictive.  So easy to make a Neanderthal could do it.  For myself who is doing low carb I make it with Splenda for my friends I use light brown sugar.  I like to use SF flavored syrups instead of the water.  I just made a batch using caramel flavor.  I also increase the cinnamon to 1 tsp.

Excellent.  My husband has to watch his sugar, so I made these with Splenda.  Added extra cinnamon.  He almost begged me to make more before traveling for Christmas.  I've made it with pecans and almonds, and will make it with walnuts too.  I healthy, sugar-free treat.  Can't beat it!

YUMMY!!!!  I made two batches of this recipe, one with cinnamon and one with cayenne pepper.  We prefer the cinnamon over the cayenne.  Used 1 tsp cinnamon,  2 tsp of water and 1 tsp of vanilla, only one egg white, which was plenty.  Had to hide these from my daughter so I would have some to take to the party we were going too!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

I made this for a chowderfest, awesome.  Liked very much, many comments & compliments. Let's see, I substituted vanilla for water, lined the pans w/parchment, used the ziploc bag tip, and did 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar for the sugar...Have made more already, and will be giving it out as gifts for Christmas.  Would be a nice Hostess gift too-in a nice seasonal container...Thanks for the great recipe, it's a keeper!

Good recipe I liked it alot. Pecans are a favorite of mine but try this instead, use the same recipe only omit the cinnamon and add Cayenne pepper.

I am allergic to pecans, however, when placed in decorative tins, these are some of the best gifts I have given and I love the way my house smells when I cook them.  I make them two pounds at a time and divide them up for friends and family.  They are a great year round gift!

This is incredibly good -- my husband can't keep his hands off them.  I tried it with walnuts and the pecans were far and above the better nut in this recipe.

These pecans are wonderful.  I am making them for a cookie/treat exchange at work.  I too followed suggestions for extra cinnamon and added the vanilla.  Also left them in for about 8 min longer than called.   Best suggestion, try one and see if they are done the way you like.

Phenomenal! Self control is impossible around these things, so plan on eating the entire batch yourself :). I, too, found that it needed two egg whites. For the vanilla, 1/2 tsp was just enough to give it that vanilla taste without being overpowering. And don't cut down on the salt - it really enhances them. I can't wait to make these for holiday gifts!

Per others suggestions I used 2 egg whites, 1 T. vanilla instead of water,and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I put foil on the baking sheet and sprayed it.  I found that stirring them every 15 was important so they didn't stick.  Wonderful treat! Now, my mom is asking me for a recipe instead of the other way around!

This recipe was okay, I took the advice of others and beat the egg white until it was stiff, I also increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. I made two batches 1 with vanilla and 1 without vanilla. Surprisingly the one without the vanilla tasted better. I was very surprised because I love vanilla.

I don't even like pecans and I found myself nibbling on these. My family raved about them. I used them like confetti on my big Thanksgiving serving and party trays. A wonderful snack and a beautiful garnish. Very easy too. With these around no one missed the pecan pie!

This is an awesome recipe with the previously recommended amendments of the additional egg white plus vanilla.  With these changes it is definitely a 5 star recipe.  Everyone LOVES them, even those that are so so on nuts!

Like almost everyone else, I used 1 tsp. of cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla in place of water and I also used Splenda instead of sugar.  These are sooo good and everyone devours them.  Try them soon.  You'll be so glad you did.

Easy to make and Great tasting! They were crispy and crunchy. Took them to a tree triming party, they were big hit and gone in minutes.  Increased the cinnamon and used vanilla extract.  Making them again for gifts!

I made these for a party and I used about a pound of pecan halves and a pound of walnuts so I increased the egg whites to three and added additional sugar and cinnamon... Plus a pinch of cayenne pepper. I was a bit worried I had gotten them too wet, but I followed the baking instructions (250 for an hour, stirring every 15 min) and they came out great. I will be making these this Christmas to give as gifts! Thanks!!

Excellent. Made exactly as directed except added a little more cinnamon and just a touch of cayenne pepper. Crispy and delicious! Update: I chopped some of these up really fine and added them to chef John's holiday rum balls recipe on this site and, oh my heavens, this was delicious. I'm making extra of these this year for just that purpose. You should try it.

I have made this recipe many times now as it is a favorite of my husband.  I have tried it with more cinnamon, adding almond flavor and I think the best is the way it is written now.  I do not go to all the trouble of two bags.  I start with large bowl and whisk my egg white then add pecans then sugar mixture.  One bowl does it all so don't waste the plastic baggies.

I used 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp salt.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  These are very good.

These are addictive. I do usually add an extra egg and substitute 1/2 the water for vanilla. I really like spice so I do add extra nutmeg & cayenne - but I think that is just a personal preference. These are a great snack & a great gift.

Excellent! Yummy! Doubled the cinnamon, used 1/2 T water & 1/2 T vanilla instead of 1 T water, 3/4 cup granulated sugar & 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of all white, & followed rest of recipe the same. Maybe I'll try 1/4 cup less sugar next time just to save some calories. Soooo dangerously delicious that we can't stop eating them!

Great, delicious recipe. I recommend not doing the full hour as this can burn some of the pecans. I taste test every 15 minutes when i turn them and generally call it quits at about 45-50 in the oven. Also I add a 1/2 tsp or so of vanilla extract to the egg/water mixture. Fantastic!!!

These were not as wonderful as I was expecting based on the reviews. 1.) They stuck to the pan 2.) They were too salty 3.) They weren't sweet enough. I will go back and try again tweaking the recipe and see what happens. They aren't the worst I've tasted, but certainly not the best either.

These are a hit everytime I make them.  Very easy to make and clean-up is a breeze.  Using vanilla instead of water adds extra flavor.  Make them, you won't be disappointed.

I made the changes Mary Domaz put in her review and they were FANTASTIC.  Coworkers described them as addictive and asked for the recipe.  I will be making them again very soon for Christmas. Thank you for the recipe Carolyn and Thank You Mary D. for the suggestions!

These are amazing!!!!  Read other reviews (which is what makes this site so awesome!) and substituted water for vanilla, did half brown and half white sugar and doubled the cinnamon. Can't wait for my hubby to try these!  He better hurry home though if he wants any!!!!

Delicious!  I have made this same type of recipe but mixing it on stovetop.  This is a much superior method.  I used walnuts this time, but I'm sure any nut would be great prepared this way.  Thanks, Carolyn!

Made these yesterday and they are already gone. Tasted wonderful. I whisked the egg white and water  and 1 tsp of vanilla together in a bowl. To this I added the pecans and stirred to coat. I  mixed in half the cinnamon, sugar and salt mixture to coat the pecans.  Then I mixed in the other half.  I baked them according to the directions, on a parchment lined baking pan. I had no trouble with sticking and they turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe.

I have used this recipe often and it turns out great every time. You can play with the spice a bit. I have used Penzey's baking spice in place of the cinnamon and added some cayenne pepper and sea salt to make a sweet & spicy appetizer for cocktail parties. You can also use a variety of nuts so if you're feeling adventurous, go for it!

BEST in the WORLD!  Truly!  Better than any cinnamon nuts anywhere! Once we started using this recipe, the family doesn't even want the high priced nuts at the sporting events anymore.  They just don't stack up!  By the way, these only get better as they age.  If you can keep the hands out of them for a few days, you will even like them better.  Thank you for a perfect recipe!  Oh yes, also used it with almonds and they were great too.

I made these at Christmas from Pecans from my Pecan tree, that I have always ignored in my back yard...NEVER again...I made them, put them in little cellophane bags (from Target), made some old fashion homemade looking labels, tied with ribbons, and I can not begin to tell you the raves I got. I have since picked 2 pillow cases full (it's addicting) and I plan on making tons. They are better than candy!   Thank you so very much for this recipe. I have been here for years, and this is the first recipe that inspired me to comment. MAKE them and make your friends and family very happy!!

Great - easy to double and loved the review suggesting use of stand mixer to add sugar to eggy pecans - will try with truvia soon for my diabetic husband - who eats these as is, but would do better w/out the sugar! THANK YOU!  (Found a similar recipe on food.com, but it called for 1/2 stick of butter per pound of nuts - which is nutz!)

I just made this for the first time to put into gift baskets for Christmas.  The mist difficult part of this recipe is not eating all of it yourself.  These sugared pecans are so crunchy and delicious!  The only change I made was to use a bit less than a tbsp of water plus a splash of vanilla extract.  Otherwise, I followed the given amounts and now I have to go get some more pecans to make a batch for myself!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Good luck eating just one of these - they are amazing and addictive! I use vanilla in place of water, and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  My husband asks for these all the time.  Yum!

Awesome recipe!!!!   I made this with a combination of pecans, almonds and pistachios to add some crunch to a nutty coconut layer cake I was making and it was absolutely fantastic.  Will be making it again for sure.

I add one tablespoon of vanilla to the egg white/water mixture. It adds flavor and makes it easier to coat all the nuts.

Warning!!!
I think these might be why I gained 20 pounds between October and January! I make these every year around the holidays. Some I pack in jars and give as gifts, some I put out for parties, and some I save for myself. I'll have to give more gifts, or have more parties next holiday season!

I've tried other recipes for candy-coated nuts and this is by far the easiest, fastest, and most delicious recipe of them all.  I tried this recipe with almonds and passed them out as office Christmas gifts.  They were enjoyed by all.

I made these exactly like the recipe except I used more cinnamon and used bowls instead of bags.  They turned out wonderfully!!!! I mixed the water and egg white and then coated the pecans.  In another bowl I mixed the remaining ingredients then I poured the other bowl into the dry bowl and mixed until all the sugar mix was gone. I sprayed my pans generously and then stirred every 15 minutes and perfect!!! Thanks!!

These are just wonderful! The coating is not too hard like some other recipes I have tried. I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and added a splash of vanilla. These will be a staple on my Christmas eve buffet!

I originally made a pound of pecans to spread around the christmas cookie platters that I make and give out as gifts.  They never made it.  My husband and kids came along and ate the whole pound.   The only thing I changed was the amount of cinnamon.  We are not real big on a bold cinnamon taste.  I only added 1/4 tsp and it was the perfect amount.  Not overpowering at all.

These are my new obsession!  I made them Monday night for a gift wrapping party with some girlfriends and they loved them, as did my husband and kids.  I used the leftovers in a salad with cranberry stilton cheese and a blueberry/pomegranate vinaigrette and it adds the perfect crunch!  Thanks so much for this recipe1

This was my 1st go at making this kind of nut mix.  It turned out pretty great.  I used 2 egg whites as others suggested which was fine....just not sure it was necessary.  I'm not giving 5 stars b/c they were just missing something... I'm thinking brown sugar.  Next time I make something like this I will likely find a recipe that calls for brown sugar.  Edit 12/12- made these a 2nd time and used 1/4 cup brown sugar in place of 1/4 cup of the white sugar- excellent!  An easy 5 stars when brown sugar is added.  Used just 1 egg white this time too.

This is the first time I tried this recipe and it turned out great.  It was easy to do and I was able to make 2lbs (one lb at a time).  I followed the instructions as is, used the bag to mix nuts with sugar mixture and added 1tsp of vanilla extract to the egg white and water.  Everyone loved them and I had enough to give goodie bags for all my guests.

We have found a new holiday treat that will be a regular. Wonderful hot and even better cooled off. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar and I do not think they will last to get to the Thanksgiving desert table tomorrow night. Yum!

Wanted a sugar coated nut for a salad (like one at California Pizza Kitchen) and found this recipe to be perfect.  I forgot to add the cinnamon but this did not seem to detract from the overall flavor.  Perhaps it was even better since I was adding it to a somewhat savory dish.  I did follow a suggestion by one reviewer and added the sugar a bit at a time to the egg white coated pecans so as not to dirty another dish.  Worked out well.  Will definitely make again.

They were very good.  Although I would like them to have a bit more crunch...I will have to try to figure something out

Simple and very easy to make while doing other things around the house.  And when they were done they tasted wonderful.  Can't wait to use these in my other recipes.

This is simple and easy, but the cinnamon doesn't really come out unless you really increase it in the recipe.  I usually double it.  

Simple and easy, but maybe too simple unless you have it with something else.

Very simple and very tasty! My changes per what reviews I've read: 2 egg whites Vanilla instead of water Froth egg and vanilla, add pecans, then, in same bowl, add the sugar mix. (I also added some nutmeg to the sugar mix) Nice and simple and quite tasty too!

I have made several varities of candied pecans and these are BY FAR the BEST (and coincidentally the easiest!).  They are delicious as a snack or dessert or thrown in with a spinach/strawberry/goat cheese/poppyseed dressing salad as I did.  Everyone asked for the recipe for the nuts at our gathering.  DELICIOUS!

Made these for Chrismas and everyone raved over them!!!  The only thing I did differently was mixed 1/2 Lb Pecans w/ 1/2 LB Cashews.  The cashews were AMAZING and made it a bit more special then just pecans.

I tried this recipe for this past Thanksgiving.  It was a huge hit!  I think it was more enjoyed than the actual dinner :)  I did add a little more cinnamon to the sugar (I just didn't think it smelled like it had enough).  They turned out perfect!  They were good while they were still warm, but even better once they colled and hardened a little.  Needless to say, I'm making them for Christmas, too!  Very easy recipe with great results!

Great with walnuts too.  I did pecans last night and walnuts tonight.  Last night I did 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Vanilla instead of water and a little extra cinnamon along with 2 egg whites.  Tonight I added all spice and went back to 1 cup of white sugar and a less then 1/4 of brown sugar.  They turned out YUMMYER!!  Give it a try :)

I doubled the amount of cinnamon to 1 tsp, but you could still barely taste it.  I would recommend using 1.5 to 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of the 1/2 tsp that the recipe calls for.  These sugared nuts are addictive!

5 star+.  The recipe is wonderful as is and is also yummy with the variations listed in the reviews.  My husband loves coconut so I made a batch using 1/2 cup fine ground mixed into the sugar mixture and coconut extract instead of water.  They are delicious.  I have also used walnuts and almonds with the same recipe.

Wow, these were excellent. The recipe was very simple and they were a huge hit at Thanksgiving!  I mixed pecans and walnuts (They were on sale) and I actually ended up liking the walnuts better.

AMAZING! I followed the original recipe for ingrediants, however, I did cut the cooking time down just a bit. Instead of every 15min, I stirred at 15, 15, 10, and 8. Turned out perfect! May have been able to go longer, but I didn't want to take the chance. I was eating them as they were baking. :o)  I will make these again! Also a great gift idea.

Made these for kids' teachers as a Thanksgiving treat.  Teachers raved!  They are delicious!  Easy to make..I used two egg whites, water and vanilla like many other reviewers suggested.  Also mixed them in a big ziploc.  Made two big cookie sheets of them.  I did cook them a bit longer than called for...they were a bit gooey still at the one hour mark...could be because I neglected to mix them during cooking.  Highly recommend!

Yummmmmy!  These are great!  I made 1.5# of pecans with 2 egg whites, 1-1/2 T. water, and 2 heaping tsp. cinnamon.  Sugar was heaping, but essentially the same amt.  They came out so good.  I was afraid they would be too sweet, but nope!  Deee-lish!

I bought a pound of pecans during a fund raiser and really didn't want to make a pie, so I found this recipe. SO easy to make. Like others, I found it much easier to use 2 big baggies, one for the water/egg and the other for the sugar mixture. Super easy, no mess. When I first tasted them, I thought they might have too much salt in them, but they don't...you get that first bite of salty, then the cinnamon and suger aftertaste....they are BEYOND delicious and I brought them to work and no one could eat just one. Fantastic gift for the holidays!! So pretty!

Seriously addictive.  The addition of the salt (we used sea salt) gives them just the right amount of sweetness.  Great recipe!

Fantastic recipe! I used parchment paper on my baking sheet rather than greasing. I also followed other suggestions to use 2 egg whites, replace the water with vanilla and double the amount of cinnamon. These turned out delicious and pretty enough for gift giving.

These were great!!! I only had 1/2 pound pecans (2 cups) and halved the recipe, but I left the egg white and water the same. So, with the egg white being doubled, I liked it, but I think I would like it without, just as written and using a whole pound per 1 egg white. It wasn't overly sweet or anything, but I think less sweetness and a little more salt would be just as good.

WOW! These are amazing. I took the advice of others and used vanilla instead of water, i also used a tad of pumpkin spice and all spice. I didn't add the salt, as my pecans were already salted by the local nut boutique. I STRONGLY recommend that you cook them at the 120 degrees C for AND stir every 15 minutes. Fantastic recipe! I will make these over and over. Everyone LOVES them!

So easy and so good.  These are addictive.  I doubled the egg whites and the cinnamon and instead of just water I did 1/2 water, 1/2 vanilla.  After making these, I'm ready for the holidays and it's only October!

I made these for christmas presents this past year.  Everybody raved about them.  My uncle told me they were good enough to sell.  I use 2 egg whites, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 Tbsp of vanilla.  They are awesome!

These were good, but I found them a tad too salty even though I used unsalted pecans (I guess I like sweet!).  My mother-in-law has a similar recipe with orange zest and juice which is a nice addition.

YUM!!  These are absolutely delicious!!  I made them for my hubby who used to buy these at the mall where we live.  They were so expensive though so I was happy to find a recipe instead!  I'm not a fan of pecans myself but decided to try some to see how they turned out....  I hope there will still be some left for my hubby when he gets home!  It's hard to stop eating them once you start!  The only thing I changed was to add 1-2 tsp of cinnamon since we love it in our house!

Tastes like something you would eat off the top of a cinnamon bun.  I would like to know how retailers get the shiny gloss and smooth texture on their candied pecans...corn syrup maybe?

This recipe is awesome! My husband loves candied pecans and he absolutely loved this! I used two egg whites just like the first review stated and I also mixed it in a bowl instead of a bag. It was much easier and less messy. I also baked it on a stone instead of baking sheet and it came out perfect!! I will definitely use this recipe again!

Great recipe! I use this for all kinds of nuts, and is especially tasty with walnuts used for a salad topper. I use one egg white and a tbs of melted butter. I also use more cinnamon about 2 tsp like the other raters suggested. Thanks!

If you use 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, it's soooo good.  I also added a splash of vanilla, and baked them about 15 minutes longer.  Great end result!

These are to die for.  Even my family that aren't big nut eaters adored these and devoured them.  I followed some of the suggestions and added a 2nd egg white and an additional Tablespoon of water.  Wasn't sure in the end if it was necessary.  I did not use the ziplock bag method suggested by some; I did it just as the recipe called for.  Worked great for me.

Great little dessert to snack on! I made these for the girls I babysit and they ate them all up. I had to take them away so that their parents could try some when they got home! I used the tips of other reviewers by first coating the pecans in the bowl I had the egg whites in. Then adding the to the cinnamon sugar mix in a gallon bag and shook. Another great thing for the girls. They loved shaking the bag around! Great recipe to make with kids. The oven was even cool enough that they could stir the pecans at the 15 minute marks (:

Everyone raved about these all holiday season. I made 6lbs of pecans this year. I gave out the recipe to so many people. My brother told me that's all he wanted for Christmas so I made him a whole pound. Can't mess them up and they taste so great.

Ever since i started making these, they've been a family favorite! It's gone after a day or so, and whenever I have a free 10 minutes, I throw a batch in the oven. It's extremely easy to make, and the pecans can be substituted for all types of nuts; so far i've tried almonds and peanuts as well, which my parents love! My favorite is still the pecans, but the three together work for a great mix, and each person can pick out the ones they like if they choose to. Also, I substitute splenda for sugar to make it healthier and guilt-free.

These are great. I made two batches. The first batch I used 1/2 brown sugar adn 1/2 white sugar and 1 tablespoon of vanilla in place of the water. The second batch I used 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla and 1/2 tablespoon of Amaretto (My Husband's idea) and they were great!!!

Just made these for a New Years Brunch tomorrow and they are yummy! I followed the advice of one user and used 2 tsp of water and 1 tsp of vanilla.  The rest I followed the recipe. They came out great and my house smells wonderful.  The only problem I have is not eating them all before tomorrow.  I may be making another batch :o)

These were a HIT with my family of nut fans. I tweaked the recipe a little and added 1 tsp of fresh nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. Without those additions, the recipe would only be 4 stars, but with them, they were a 5!

These are so easy to make and delicious.  I mixed Pecan halves and Whole Almonds, and doubled the recipe using 3 egg whites.  I will be using them in the Christmas baskets I will be making and they were a request for Christmas from my 85 yr old mother who enjoyed them when I made them last year for Christmas.  Instead of shaking them in a large ziplock bag, I just put the mixed the nuts in a large bowl, pours the beaten egg whites, water and vanilla on the nuts then added the sugar mixture a little at a time getting it all mixed together.  I then poured it on the prepared baking sheet and cooked as directed, let them cool then enjoyed.  This is one of the easiest recipes I have used in a long time.  Thanks.

These are a staple in our house. Make for every gathering and party I host and everyone always raves about them.   I follow another reviewer's advice and use 2 tsp of water and 1 tsp of vanilla. Also add sugar mixture straight to the bowl with pecans. One bowl, so easy, and delicious!

Excellent recipe.  I've already made 2 double batches today!  With the first double batch I took the advice of a few reviewers and added an extra egg white to the original as well as used an extra 1 tsp of cinnamon before doubling ALL the ingredients (for a double batch) i.e. I used 4 egg whites for the double batch instead of 2 egg whites.  The pecans turned out yummy though they were a little on the moist side so I left them in the oven a little bit longer.  So in my second double batch, I used only 3 egg whites and they came out perfectly!  Also, as I saw mixed reviews about substituting water for vanilla extract, I decided with both my batches to use 1 tbsp water and 1 tabsp vanilla extract.  It worked out just fine.

I made these last night - their yummy - but I must have beat the egg whites too much (warning) and they got too frothie?? Therefore the nuts hung on to the froth while I mixed the sugar onto them - they got kinda clumpy looking - BUT - they still taste good! I will try again - but now I'm going to try "Dawns Candied Walnuts" it has some good reviews also - looks to take a bit more time.

I made these for a Boxing Day dinner and my cousin's husband couldn't stop eating them to the point that he made me take them out of the room! Very high in sugar. Next time I will decrease the amount of sugar I put in - just to be health conscious. The cinnamon really gives it that extra zing but I also add some vanilla flavouring which should make up for a reduced sugar amount.

Fantastic!!  I too followed the great advice here and used 2 egg whites, 1 tsp water and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  The bit of vanilla adds just a hint of flavor. I will make these again and again. Thanks for this amazing recipe and for everyone's tips.

I found these to be deliciously addictive!  I used two egg whites and vanilla in place of the water.  I will make these again.

Easy and tasty! I started off at 250 degrees and raised the temp to 350 degrees to speed up the "drying out" process. Turned out great.

I loved this recipe to make pecans for snaking on Thanksgiving day! I added a little bit more vanilla and cinnamon, for my taste preferences, and it was perfect. I also just stirred it all together in a bowl instead of using a ziploc bag, and that was sufficient.

These are SO good and SO easy to do. I added vanilla instead of water as one person already suggested and it was sooooo much better! Also, adding a pinch of allspice to the cinnamon brings a little more flavor to celebrate fall. Also i lined my pan with foil so i could just throw it away when i was done.

I've made these many times, they are no-fail.  I use 2 egg whites, add 1 tsp. vanilla, and I double the cinnamon but the recipe is fine without those changes as well.  Great on those lettuce salads w/ bleu cheese, cranberries or cherries, etc.  Would make a great gift too, who wouldn't want these in their pantry?

These are absolutely wonderful!  I love the nuts that you can buy at the mall but these have that homemade taste that the mall can't beat!  I made the recipes as described but I did add a little vanilla to the water and a touch of freshly ground nutmeg and they were perfect.  My family could not keep their hands out of them.  I will be making these again and again!

Probably my all time favorite recipe to make from Allrecipes.com.  I have made this 4 times since December and every function I bring this receipe to it is a hit!! I always add 1 tsp of vanilla for extra flavor.  This will be a hit everytime you make it!  Kids and hubby love it so much they beg me to make them again!!!!

These are incredible! I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and used half brown and half white sugars. I also used about half pecans and half almonds because that's what I had in the house. I've yet to serve these to anyone (I will on Saturday), but there are a few extras that "won't fit in the container" oops! They're so good and so easy

Oh my Carolyn, were these ever amazing!!!! I made these for the "Green Salad with Cranberry Vinaigrette" recipe on this site, which btw was pretty darn incredible! I probably ate half of the pecans before our New Years Even party even began! I have used walnuts before, but ya know what? Never again because these were just too good for words. Thank you Carolyn!!

We had this at our Christmas Eve party last night, and not only was it easy to make, they were DELICIOUS!  I am still munching on them today.  I am thinking about having them as a topping for Butter Pecan ice cream.

Wowsers these are FANTASTIC.  If you make them, keep copies of the recipe around because you will get asked for it.

I use 2 egg whites, 1 T of vanilla.  I also cut back the sugar to 3/4 C and make the cinnamon 1/4 C.

I LOVE to chop these nuts up and serve them on top of a salad with cranberries and blue cheese.  Also, they are great on ice cream.  YUMMY YUMMY!

I cut the salt for the recipe down slightly because the package (sneakily) only held 12 oz instead of 16 oz. Oh well, I still used one egg, and then took my measuring spoon (tablespoon) added a splash of vanilla and filled the rest with water. I also added a few extra dashes of cinnamon and everything was perfect! I whipped the egg in the same bowl that I added the pecans and sugar/cinnamon mixture to. Everything turned out great (even though I did not bake them for the full time suggested). I even think they tasted better at our Christmas party a few days after I made them! Terrific!

These were great and surprisingly easy to make.  Not quite as good as the trader joe's ones, but pretty close.  Got lots of requests for the recipe. I also made the modification of 2tsp water, 1 tsp vanilla rather than the full tblsp of water and doubled the cinnamon. I beat the liquids in the kitchenaid and then hand-stir the pecans until coated.  I mix all the dry ingredients inside a good freezer bag (and cheap one might split open on you) and slosh around until well mixed. Then add the wet pecans and shake around until everything is well mixed.  Spread out on a greased cookie sheet making sure they're pretty well single-layer otherwise they won't dry well. Don't use wax paper or foil because if they stick it'll just tear your foil when you try to scrape the nuts around during mid-bake mixing. Mix every 10-15 minutes while baking and drop down to every 5 minutes near the end. They can burn quickly. Much better once they've cooled and gotten crunchy.

I have been making these for a year.  They are soooo good.  Only problem is I eat a lot of them before I give them away. I do use half white/half brown sugar and do do a combo of vanilla/water.  I also add a little cayenne pepper (about 1/4 tsp).  This last time I made them I did a combo of walnuts and pecans and they turned out great. They are a great gift for the holidays.  Everyone that I have given them to loves them and wants more.

I have been making a recipe sorta like this for a few years now. Normally I make huge batches of this around Thanksgiving and Christmas so I use a dozen egg whites and five lbs of nuts. I know that sounds ridiculous but it works. I whip up the egg whites, add two cups of sugar and two cups of brown sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon. Then I add the nuts in and stir with a spoon (to keep the mix fluffy). I pop it in the oven and let it do its thing. Minimal mess with great results. Tip: Either use tin foil to coat your cookie sheet, or grease well. If you forget to grease it or didn't grease it enough, then as soon as the pecans are cool enough to handle remove them and soak the pan in warm water while scrubbing. Once the mix gets cool completely you'll play hell getting it off.

These were so good!!Doubled the recipe since they were for a bake sale, took some other reviewers' advice and doubled the amt of cinnamon called for and used an extra egg to make sure coating was even, they kitchen smelled wonderful and the pecans tasted even better!!! Keeper! Thanks for sharing I will definitely be making again!

Wow!!  I don't even like pecans, but these are addicting and delicious!!  I did 2 egg whites with 1 Tbsp vanilla.  In a ziploc I mixed 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp kosher salt, and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I will use the nuts in Nordstrom's mixed berry and chicken salad.

I haven't made this recipe yet.  My grandmother who was born in 1900 use to make something that sounds like this recipe.  There were 18 people to cook for.  She always used 4 cups of mixed nuts.  I remember everyone loved them.  I WILL be trying this recipe to compare.

These are fabulous!  I made them to add to a strawberry and spinach salad for that little extra wow factor.  I followed the recipe as written with one exception; I added 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper for a little spicy bite, and I'm so glad I did.  These I will be making often, very often!

Yum! So many people have asked me for this recipe. I made several changes like previous reviewers: additional egg white, vanilla, and a tad more cinnamon. I just add the pecans/sugar mixture to the egg white mixture and gently toss until pecans are thoroughly coated. Works just as well as the ziploc method.

The salt really makes this recipe.  I used a generous amount of ground sea salt.  If it was just sweet, it would be okay, but the salt makes it great.

GREAT RECIPE. I made it for Christmas treats to send to family and everyone loved it! Some said that they thought it was bought from a specialty store! I made them again for New Year's Eve and had more people demanding the recipe. I myself am addicted.
I do make substitutions. I follow the suggestion for vanilla instead of water and I also add in some nutmeg- not much (1/4 tsp or so).
This has begun a new tradition.

These were excellent. I took the advice of other reviews and used 2 egg whites, 1 T. vanilla extract, and 1 tsp. cinnamon. I also used parchment paper on the baking sheet. I don't even like pecans very much, but I loved these. I'm making these to add to my Christmas baskets this year. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe with almonds instead of pecans.  I added about 1/2 T of vanilla to the egg mixture and other than this I made no other alterations. I absolutely can't wait to make these almonds again!  They disappeared much more quickly than I had anticipated:)

It definitely needs the vanilla. For the first 15 minutes I roasted them at 375 and then lowered the temperature. My husband, daughter and I finished them all in a night. We couldn't stop going back for more. I'm going to make three batches of these and wrap them in decorative paper as Xmas treats for co-workers.

Update: I added 1/2 tsp almond extract and that made them unbelievable. They were a hit everywhere I took them. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe, I make them every Christmas and give as part of a cookie plate for friends.  I add a little fresh nutmeg and splash of vanilla...really a bullet proof recipe.  Hard to do anything wrong!  Love them!

You have got to try this!!! It is addictive! The family and I loved this so much---we couldn't put it down! Followed advice of others with the vanilla extract and sprinkles of nutmeg as well as using other kinds of nuts! This is great anytime!

It doesn't get any easier or yummier!  Everyone loves these in my house, school, etc.  Use vanilla, do shake-n-bake trick...definitely the way to go.

Fabulous!  I have tried other recipes for candied nuts and these were the best by far ~ they even won the the best food gift prize at work! I did add a bit more cinnamon and increased the oven temp to 300.  I will definitely make this again.

wonderful stuff! I made these specifically for a salad of romaine,feta cheese,greek olives,balsamic dressing etc.they were a perfect addition. I intended to use the tip of using the zip lock bags to mix but, unless you want to save washing a bowl it is very easy to stir it up in a bowl.the tip about transferring the entire egg white/pecan mixture was helpful, i had been confused about the transfer too. I did use an extra egg white and substituted vanilla for a teaspoon of the water. I am sensitive to the processed sugars so used and organic unprocessed whole cane sugar(rapadura) that I get from the health food store. It mixed well and gave it a rich flavor. Also, when used in a salad, next time I will keep them on the side because they get gooey when they sit in the moist salad for very long.thanks for the recipe!

Very easy recipe to make. Definately line your baking sheet with parchment paper or foil and spray with cooking spray or they will stick. I used mixed nuts just to get a variety. Will make again. Thank you!

What a winner! This recipe is so easy and the results are fantastic! I used Vanilla in place of the water. I have made several batches this month and family and friends eat them up as fast I make them.

These were great! The only ingredient I changed was the sugar, using Splenda instead. I brought them to our friend's house for Thanksgiving dinner.  Some people ate them alone, others used them as a topping for ice cream.  The pecans were a huge success and so easy to make, that I'll definitely make them again.

These are delicious!!! I used half almonds & half pecans.  After whipping the eggwhite & vanilla, poured them into ziplock bag as suggested & squished around as others suggested & then poured in the sugar mixture (1/2 white & 1/2 lt brown)--poured them onto a foil lined pizza stone (I sprayed the foild with Pam) didn't have to stir & they did not stick.  I baked them for 45 mins at 250 deg. then 15 mins with convection oven setting--turned off oven after the hour cooking time was complete and left them in the hot oven for additional 10 minutes--they were great and stayed crispy for several days.  Thanks for sharing the tips--this recipe is definitely a winner & will be made many, many times!!!

Everyone that tastes these asks how much butter is in them cuz they sort of melt in your mouth!  They are shocked when i tell them none!

I made 2 batches of these - the first batch i made with 2 egg whites, cin. instead of water, and 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar, and used the non stick foil.  SUPERB!  then the second batch i made the same except i used Splenda instead of the real stuff -these were also great!! they did have that splenda after-taste, but were still very good!!

These are SO good.  I plan on making them for the holiday this year.  I had to scale the recipe to 9 servings because I only had 12 oz. of pecans.  I still used the whole egg white though.  I also turned off the oven after the hour, but left them in for another 10 minutes for them to crunch up a little more.  Excellent!!!

Very good! I used 1/2 Tbsp vanilla extract and 1/2 Tbsp water but kept everything else the same. I dumped the pecans in the egg whites bowl, stirred well with a big spoon and then pour them in the sugar mix bowl and stirred again. No problems at all doing it that way. As always, I used parchment paper (love it) to line the pan and had no need to grease or spray it. Excellent!

See. Update below!  These are easy and fabulous!   I used some of the suggestions in previous reviews.  Used two egg whites, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, then 2 1/2 teaspoons water.  I  mixed the eggwhite mixture in a bowl with my Bamix immersion blender.  Then advded the pecan/eggwhite mixture to the sugar mix in a ziploc bag and tossed.  After I spread them out on Release foil on my jellyroll pan, I baked them on convection 225 degrees.  They came out great.  If they don't get eaten tonite, I plan on using them in a pear & gogonzola salad for a luncheon tomorrow.  I will make these again.
12/21/15
Made a few changes:  I used only 1 egg white,  1/2 tsp vanilla (opt), 2 1/2 tsp water, mixed in large bowl with small electric mixer until soft peaks.  I put 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp cinnamon in large stainless bowl, mixing it up.  After tossing the pecans into egg white mixture until coated, I then transferred to the sugar mixture and coated the nuts until there was no sugar coating the sides of the bowl.  Into the pan lined with non-stick aluminum foil and into oven at 275* convection oven.  stirred every 15 minutes for 1 hour.  Yum.   Bowls washed up easily and I didn't waste any plastic bags, plus it was easier stirring them to coat than shaking them.  I will try the recipe using Truvia next time.

Great recipe for Christmas gift giving. I tried it with almonds and it was just as delicious.  I also increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I buy my pecans and almonds at Costco/Sam's Club and it makes alot.

These are so addictive!  Everyone who has tried them loves them!  It's so nice to make during the holidays because the smell from the oven fills the house.  Great to put in decorative jars and give them as Christmas gifts.

Very Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly as posted the first time...However, the second time I substituted 1/4 cup butter for the water and added 1 tablespoon corn syrup.  They were absolutely mouth-watering...More of a scumptious toffee taste!

Absolutely delicious!!! I have made them a dozen times already as they are so requested by my family and friends. I tried it once with brown sugar and it didnt turn out nearly as good as with white, so stick to the recipie! Also, I put the egg mixture in to a big ziploc bag and shook it with the nuts to get them coated. Then I put the sugar, salt and cinnamon in the bag and shook it again. It made for an easy clean-up.

This is a great recipe!  I suggest though, that you don't let the nuts site in the egg whites, as the longer they sit, the soggier they get.

Made these for Bunco and Thanksgiving - what a big hit!!  As others suggested, I used 2 egg whites (instead of 1), 1 T. vanilla (in place of water). 1/2 tsp. salt (instead of 3/4) and 1 tsp. ground cinnamon (instead of 1/2).  After mixing nuts in wet mixture I drained them and then added to dry mixture to coat.  DEFINITELY cover your pan with REYNOLDS RELEASE and you will have no problems.  Easy and DELICIOUS (...and I didn't care for pecans until I tried this recipe!)

Absolutely incredible! I made a double batch yesterday morning and they are gone. Completely gone! I'm not sure there is a better sugared pecan recipe out there. Simple...and totally awesome! THANKS!!!

***Adding to my review 12/26/04. I just finished making 15 POUNDS (yes...15!) of these for New Years gifts, and every batch turned out just awesome! I'm not sure why other reviewers have had so much trouble with these sticking...I've never had a pecan stick. Not once! (I do increase the sugar mixture by 1/2 cup sugar). Just make sure you spray your sheet with PAM or something, and they'll be fine...mine just shake loose. These are the best pecans! You won't be disappointed!!!

Awesome!! I followed others suggestions and used 2 egg whites, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tbs. vanilla, 1/2 tbs. water. I also used a plastic bag to coat the nuts with the sugar mixture.

I also used vanilla instead of water and, since I'm diabetic, I used Splenda instead of sugar. The one word that everyone uses when they try these is "addictive".  They disappear quickly.

I add some cayenne pepper to give it that hot-yet-sweet flavor, and they're great on top of a salad of greens, apples & goat cheese, with a splash of dijon dressing.  Xlnt recipe with many uses.

Delicious! I used vanilla extract instead of water and used 2 egg whites instead of just one, and it turned out great! I ate some a few minutes after they came out of the oven and they tasted sooo good. I also had some left over, and they're just as good. Both my parents offered kudos as well.

These are great! They were so quick and easy to make however the next time I make them I will take the advice of other reviews and use vanilla in place of the water and up the cinnamon to 3/4 teaspoon. This ones a keeper for my favorite recipe file.

These turned out amazing! I agree with some other comments that they could have used an additional egg white but they turned out great with just the one. I also replaced the cinnamon with nutmeg because my sister is allergic to cinnamon and added just a little bit of brown sugar to the mix. They are fantastic and can’t wait to bring them to Christmas dinner!

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I make it for Christmas and Mother's day.  Here are my suggested changes.  You need only dirty one bowl, one whisk, and a spatula. Whip one egg white with water until frothy, add the salt and cinnamon and then only 2/3 c sugar.  Stir until combined. Then stir in the pecans until well coated. Turn the pecans out on a foil covered sheet pan and follow the rest of the original instructions. One cup of sugar is too much, unless you prefer crunching on sugar crystals. You get a good result (without the crystals) with 2/3 c and the result is more pecan flavor.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

An enjoyable snack and super simple to make. Made as written the first time, and experimented with two variations suggested by reviewers. Preferred the batch made as written. Adopt the KISS principle, and avoid over thinking this fantastic recipe. Make great gifts.

*BOURBON* Sugar Pecans:  Very easy recipe to complete.  Like others, I used two egg whites.  I made only one other change...  I used a tbsp of good bourbon in exchange for the water.  (Mic drop)  You're all welcome.  :D

This is a great starter recipe, but I made some adjustments and its the one I use time and time again:
increase the egg whites to TWO; substitute the water with VANILLA; increase the cinnamon to 1/2 TABLESPOON and the sugar I use 1/2 cup BROWN, and 1/2 cup WHITE.  Pecans come out PERFECT every time!  Sugar coating has a nice CRUST!

I made it several times as the recipe reads.  I have also added spice such as cayenne pepper to give it a sweet and spicey kick.  
This is a terrific recipe.  I will be making large batches of these and putting them in pretty little containers for a wedding shower for the guests.

I've been making these for 20 some years, so, I decided to try this way...No one knew the difference!!! The only things I do differently is, I use no water, and bake them at 375* for 16min. stiring once.

I made it with 1/2 cup of homemade brown sugar.
you don't need a 1 cup, gross too much sugar. 

you take a cup of raw sugar its the best one, and a tsp of molasses and make sure your hands are clean. but mix it around with your hands. I tried a fork and didn't work, just best to use your hand. and it blended it in great.

anyway I use a half of cup of homemade brown sugar and used 1 tsp of cinnamon. and whisked up 1 egg white, and did not use any water that will make it sloppy trust me on that. I had mine in the toaster over on 300 degrees and for 45 minutes.

I checked every 1 minutes. and it didn't burn at all. they came out great. I made a double batch so my 1 cup of homemade sugar worked out well.

if you cant do all that sugar and I don't do this a lot anyway. 
make the brown sugar from truvia its better and healthier for you than Splenda. Splenda is made from sucralose and its artificial. which god didn't make us with artificial parts so why even put it in your body.

1 cup of truvia with 1 tsp of molasses and blend it in. and only use a half of cup. its sweet like sugar. and works out great. thanks for the recipe. and thanks for helping me be a better cook.

These were a big hit!  I made them for my co-workers.  I made 1 lb with the white sugar and then the other 1 lb I made with 1/2 c of white sugar and 1/2 c light brown sugar.  The brown sugar nuts took a bit longer to get that crusty sugary coating but they did. It's really hard to not keep eating them.  These make great gifts.

Fabulous!!  I actually used this recipe for pecan pieces and it worked just great.  I didn't think about the fact that they get harder once they cool, so I mistakingly left them in the oven for an extra 15 minutes.  No harm, but they definitely did harden up when they cooled.  I suggest a glass baking dish so that it can be soaked for a while and not having to worry about rusting.  Just a thought.  Thanks for sharing!

Definitely deserves the five stars. Followed some others. Whipped my egg whites, added nuts, then added sugar. Mixed well, then poured on aluminum foil lined cookie sheet. I only did mine for 45 minutes in oven as I used convection. House smells yummy and the pecans are so crunchy and very yummy. I sprinkle a bit of sea salt on my nuts after the second stir instead of adding in to sugar.

Awesome!  Upped egg whites to 2 instead of 1.  These are exactly like those pecans in the mall that "smell so good!"

Crunchy and just wonderful! Great for the holidays!  Serve as an appetizer, then use the leftovers in salad. I used 2 egg whites and replaced 1 T. of water with 2 tsp. of water & 1 tsp. vanilla as suggested by another reviewer.  As they bake in the oven, the blend of vanilla and cinnamon makes the house smell heavenly.

Very good but per reviews, I omitted the water and added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 additional egg white. Also added more cinnamon and sugar. Baked 50 minutes as I enjoy them a little less cooked.

This recipe was great!  I made a double batch for Christmas and it was a hit!  I'm still munching on the last remnants.  I used a 1/2 tbsp vanilla and 1/2 tbsp water.  I also went heavy on the cinnamon as some other reviewers suggested. I would highly recommend--easy and yummy recipe.

Followed another's recommendation and used vanilla instead of water.  Mixed the egg white (3) and vanilla, but made it very frothy, then mixed in nuts, and finally the other ingredients and mixed well in the bowl.  Best results I have ever had.  Smelled like heaven.  :)

I've been making a very similar recipe for years, given to me by a friend... I don't add any water to the one egg white, which is whipped until frothy (I use a hand mixer) in a large bowl; add the pecans to the same bowl, stir until coated, then gradually sprinkle in the mixture of sugar, salt and cinnamon and stir; my recipe calls for 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to 1 cup of sugar, which is not at all overwhelming.  Spray pan with Pam, spread the coated nuts, and bake. Excellent recipe, and it does make great gifts for Christmas!

This is a no-tears, easy and simple to construct recipe.  I've tried other recipes and have had to throw away a perfectly good batch of pecans because they were a sticky mess.  The key is baking them for ONE HOUR.
I also tried the 2 tsp of water and 1 tsp of vanilla suggestion.  I recommend you use Mexican vanilla if it's available in your area.  I use Molina or Danncy brands.  Molina is smokier and Danncy reminds me a little of rosewater, both are more full-bodied than your grocery store vanilla. In addition, I used 1 tsp of cinnamon, and again, I used Saigon Cinnamon which is available at Costco.  I over-cooked one batch by accident, and although it had a slightly bitter aftertaste, people that tried them raved about how good they were. I will be making these until I'm a little old gray-haired lady.

I made these for my coworkers for Christmas and they were a big hit! Everyone wants the recipe. To make this easier I did use parchment paper on the pans and I used a large Ziploc bag to mix the sugar mixture and just poured it in with the pecans & egg mix. I didn't change anything about the ingredients. Thank you for sharing!

A keeper for sure! Easy and soooo good. They can be made ahead of time as they keep well in a tightly sealed container or zip topped bag.

I combined cinnamon, a little ginger and clove. The combination was just right.

Made this recipe for the first time yesterday...YUM!  Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white.  Also doubled the cinnamon to a full teaspoon. Used a single egg white, and stirred thoroughly in a big stainless mixing bowl.

Family has been snacking on them since...they're almost gone!

Amazing!!!  Made recipe exactly as written. I thought they would be too sugary. (I don't like sweets that much.) These are addictive little nuts. They are not too sweet. They are perfect.

DELICIOUS!!! I made these last year for the holidays and everyone loved them. We don't eat eggs so I replaced the egg white with a mix of milk and melted butter. Amazing recipe.

I make this recipe substituting splenda for the sugar and adding a little more cinnamon. Great for low carb followers.

After serving them to friends I'm always asked for the recipe. I've made some of the adjustments suggested by the readers who have rated it and it's come out really good.  I do half vanilla and half water and three egg whites

This was perfect just the way it was. I considered adding vanilla like others suggested and I'm happy I didn't. Using two bowls as suggested worked perfectly too I didn't need to use bags or my kitchen aid. I took this to a birthday party and it was well received!

I tried this on Christmas Eve and made no changes except for the baking time.  I would definitely say these are easy and delicious.  Next time, I will try with superfine sugar, so the nuts are not so gritty and maybe use parchment paper for faster cleanup. Even with a greased pan, the cleanup was not so bad.

Good! Be sure to coat generously though! I made these on 12/30/2013 and then again 12/27/2019! lol. I made the changes (vanilla extract, 1/2 brown sugar, cardamom and no cloves). 
I don't love it. I will try this recipe again as is and rate it or put a few more spices. UDATE: I made it again following the recipe and I loved it! but no cloves :)

Wow - easy and super delicious!  I used two egg whites, doubled the cinnamon and only baked for a total of 45 minutes.  They turned out fantastic!  They're already half gone so it looks like I'll be making another batch for Christmas.

These turned out fantastic!!  I misread the instructions and started baking them at 350 instead of 250, I panicked and thought I ruined them so after the first 15 minute timer went off I turned my oven down to 180 and continued to bake as directed, stirring every 15 minutes.  I may have let them stay in the oven a tad bit longer (about 10 minutes) just to be sure they were ready.  They came out perfect!!!  Best candied nuts I've ever made.  However, I did use 2 egg whites so maybe the extra moisture helped them.  So happy I didn't waste all those expensive pecans!!!

Fantastic, yummy, super easy! But I only gave 4 stars because it needs double the amount of cinnamon, at least. I also used my Kitchenaid, and it only took about 5 minutes to prepare this. The results are delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and they are delicious.  I read all the reviews before preparing but I wanted to follow your recipe first.  The next time I make them I will use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 light brown sugar just to see how much better it turns out.  Now I know who I will give these for Christmas!

Perfect! Adding the 1/2 tsp of vanilla is the perfect touch - And lining the cookie sheet with parchment paper cuts the calories (a tiny bit) and no greasy fingers. I've tried several recipes and this is , by far, THE BEST!!!!

Definitely try this recipe!! We love this! I've learned to just mix the spices/sugar into the beaten whites then mix in the nuts. One bowl=less mess.

These are insanely good! I doubled the cinnamon, and increased the salt to 1 tsp to give it more of of carmel/sea salt flavor. We can't stop eating them!!

These turned out exactly as I wanted! I made the 3 changes that were recommended by others, 1) use 2 egg whites, 2) 1 T vanilla instead of water, and 3) 1 t cinnamon. They were phenomenal! I tripled the recipe and it still came out great. I will definitely make these again!

Since finding this recipe last spring, I have made it at least a dozen times and have given the pecans as part of my Christmas baking presents this month. Today I was in a hurry and inadvertently made a couple of changes which made the pecans even more delicious.  I left out the water. Instead, I just coated the pecans with the whisked egg white (I use the ziplock bag method).  Then I cooked them at 275 degrees for an hour.  These changes made them exceptionally crunchy and wonderful.

I followed some other suggestions from reviewers and used 2 egg whites, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 2 tsp. vanilla, and 1 tsp. water. They actually looked better than the picture shown, and they tasted amazing (and got even better as they cooled). What an excellent holiday treat! I have a feeling this will be a new holiday (and maybe birthday, and father's day, etc.) tradition!

These are excellent - it goes without saying.  More sugar, less sugar, more salt, less salt. Hey, if you want to add vanilla, then more power to you.  However, what I want to know is - what does everyone do with that egg yolk?

These are absolutely addictive!!!! I did not have any eggs left in the house, so I used heavy cream, water and vanilla. I also used slightly more cinnamon. The result was amazing!! I had to bring some to work so I didn't eat them all. lol

delish:  tried the speedy method of combining in mixer but stupidly had mixer on too high and broke up many of the nuts. Not a big deal though, they were going in strawberry, pecan blue cheese salad. 
 Added a little vanilla this time to try to duplicate spiced nuts my family used to get out in Beaver Creek CO.  
Making another batch tomorrow to serve at a coctail party but will  add touch of cayenne and little more salt but will go back to the written method of using a plastic bag

Excellent!  Made this twice, once with cinnamon and once with the Pampered chef ultra cinnamon spice.  Go with just cinnamon.  More flavor.  Everyone loved them and I'm making several batches for christmas gifts.

These were the hit of the party last night.  I used one additional egg white since my eggs were small and used vanilla in place of the water.  They turned out great.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  I also made some for work and to send out to family for Christmas.  Many people have asked for this recipe already.  I love it.  It is definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly.  These just didnt taste like I had hoped.  They were not "glazed" enough or "sugary" enough.  Wont make these again but I am still looking for a great glazed pecan recipe!

This recipe is great.  I made these pecans to put in my homemade pumpkin ice cream.  I had to keep my husband and kids out of them for fear that there wouldn't be enough for the ice cream.  They came out AMAZING!

I made these for one of our women's Bible studies. They were a hit. Every lady wanted the recipe. So right then and there my friend brought her laptop out and printed this recipe for everyone. They are delicious!! :) Recipe was so simple...I made more and crushed them over ice cream with caramel! (yes, it was delicious).

I only had 1/2 lb of chopped pecans, so I cut the recipe in half (but kept the egg whites and water the same). They turned out wonderful!! I did add a bit more cinnamon than what it calls for, but that's only because I love the taste of cinnamon. Can't wait to see what my husband says when he tastes these after work!

I made these for Christmas presents for my friends and family (put into colorful tins with tissue paper).  Everyone raved over them.  The only complaints I got was that they disappeared too fast!  I made a mix of both sugar-coated pecans and almonds.

These are delicious and so easy to make!  The only change I made per other reviews was to increase the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.  I buttered my cookie sheet really well and stirred the nuts every 15 minutes and had no problems with either sticking or burning.  I used them on the Eat Michigan Salad from this site but they are yummy just to munch on!

The PERFECT recipe.  I've used this over and over, given as gifts many times.  I'm always asked for the recipe.  Also asked to make these all the time during the christmas holidays.  I have switched out the cinnamon and sugar to cayenne pepper and salt.

My daughter and a coworker had been buying little packs of sugared pecans to top their salads at lunch. I told her I would try to make some and found this recipe.These are absolutely wonderful and cost so much less to make.

These are fabulous.  I made them as directed and added 1 tbl of vanilla.  I whisked the egg white, water and vanilla, then added the sugar mixture to the same bowl, it was easier that way.

I use 2 egg whites, and add vanilla, and probably end up baking them 15 minutes longer to make sure they are dry and crunchy. These are soo good and they go super quick at social functions!

The recipe was SCRUMPTIOUS--however, I didn't have pecans on hand, but walnuts instead--they were amazing.  My hubby now wants these on his salads for work!  Will definitely use all sorts of nuts with this recipe---very ADDICTING!  Enjoy!

this recipe is delicious, especially the version with 2 egg whites and 2 tsp water and 1 tsp vanilla.  Works great to use a DeMarle silpat sheet to bake and cool.

I have made a similar recipe for several years and I use more spices, cloves,cinnamon, ginger nutmeg, cardamon and some brown sugar. To give them a little  kick I add a dash or more of cayenne pepper. What a difference that makes, yum! Have not tried vanilla, but will try  the next time I make them, thanks for the idea.

Nothing special. Like it well enough but won't bother to make it again. I thought they'd have more "oomf" like the nuts you can buy at the mall.

i just made these, and they are incredible, i mixed the egg whites with the sugar and cinnamon, which was a mistake on my part but turned out wonderful.  I just did it one bowl too, no bags and it was super easy, i cant stop eating them, cannot wait to make them again

Wonderful easy recipies.  I used the one bowl rendition instead of removing the nuts and then tossing them in the sugar mixture.  It allowed me to add a few more nuts a couple at a time so I could get every last drop of the great coating.  These are great in salad, as gifts, with tea, or as part of aparty tray.  This recipie will make you a star!   Becky in Arizona

Make sure you don't use to much sugar or Pecans become to hard.

I make these all the time and they're ALWAYS a hit!  So many people have asked for the recipe.  The key is to add vanilla as other reviewers have mentioned - it makes the difference between this recipe and others.  Added bonus - your house smells AMAZING when these are baking!

I make a slightly different version of this without the egg whites. I also add vanilla. You can use any kind of nuts in this. I use a mix of cashews, peanuts & walnuts. Very addictive!

I love these. I experimented with different nuts. works well with all. I also used different flavorings. the one we all liked best was, 1 teaspoon maple extract, and brown sugar instead of white. soo good.  I always get raves on these.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe with one exception - I used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  They were perfectly sweet and had just the right amount of cinnamon.

Easy, excellent snack.  Others suggested using gallon sized bags to coat the pecans, but I had no trouble with using bowls.  Either way, this is super easy and the pecans turn out great.

Thanks for a great recipe!  I used these to top pumpkin cupcakes, and they were a monster hit.  I'll definitely use this crazy-easy recipe again!  I think I'll try them with savory spices too.

I doubted my husband when he wanted to get all fancy and make these. I admit I was wrong. These are awesome! We put them in a spinach salad with strawberries, mozerella cheese and a poppy seed dressing.

PLUS 5 MORE STARS!! This recipe is just too easy to taste this good! I did as other did and used 2 egg whites, vanilla extract instead of water, and a full tsp of cinnamon. I can't imagine anybody not liking these. I'm putting it in my "to make" list for the holidays! Thanks Carolyn!

What can I say? Another 5 stars! Made these to add to salads but ended up putting them in a nice jar on the coffee table. Going to make another batch for a gift!

These are so great! I take them anywhere I'm asked to bring something and they are always the first item to disappear from the table. The only changes I make is I use walnuts instead of pecans and I sub the water for 1/2 Tbsp. vanilla and 1/2 Tbsp. water. I've also added nutmeg and cloves to the sugar and cinnamon mixture and it adds a great flavor. I don't feel there is a need for a second egg white like some users say if you are, in fact, only baking one pound of nuts. They are crunchy, delicious and are not only great for snacking but are also wonderful in salads!

These were amazing - so easy and incredible flavor. I too subbed vanilla for the water. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because they weren't particularly pretty.

This recipe was excellent!  I added a little bit of honey to the mixture.  I'm going to try mixing half white sugar and half brown sugar to the mix.  This over very well during Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Everyone was begging for more!  My father in law actually hoarded most of them during Christmas last year!

These are so delicious!  I've never met anyone who didn't like them.  I totally make a pig out of myself when we make them.  I use a vanilla/water ratio instead of just water as other reviews suggested but other than that I make them as is.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I've made this recipe several times as written, and love it. They make a great snack to take to work. The first time I made it, I beat the egg whites too long and the pecans were so sharp they cut the rood od my mouth. I've also learned to buy good pecans, not the cheapest bag. I like the Market Pantry brand at Target.

Fantastic!  My friends are all foodies, and this was a huge hit.  I used walnuts instead of pecans, a small splash of vanilla, and added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Per peoples' suggestions, I also added a second egg white.  Great results!

Just made my second batch (burned the first - but I munched on them anyway!) This time I gave them a little more attention.  My oven cooks fast so @ 400 degrees they only cooked about 15 min. I too subbed H2O for vanilla, 1/2 br. sug. and kicked it up with a couple dashes of cayanne! My picky 5 yr old even loved it - not too spicey!  I will be putting these in my blue cheese chopped salad tonight! Can't wait:)

Okay, so I almost should've even be writing a review since I  tweaked this recipe so drastically....  But, since this recipe was my original inspiration, and because everyone *looooved* the results SO much, I felt compelled to write something.   Instead of pecans, I made sugar coated almonds. I also had only had 1/2 cup of white sugar left in my cupboard, so I substituted the cup of white sugar with a cup of brown. Anyhow, this is what I mean by tweaked beyond recognition... but they turned out very tasty, and I still wanted to give credit to the inspiration. Someday I hope to make the sugar coated pecans properly. :)

These are gobbled up....each and every time. I do like to use a little less nuts as to make them extra coated and yummy. Love to add them also to salads. You will love them too....I guarantee it!

I love this recipe!  It's so easy and makes the whole house smell wonderful.  I prepared this recipe for the first time on Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Everyone wanted the recipe.  So I decided to make them again for Christmas and give them out as gifts.  I wish I had made more because they went quickly.  I followed the recipe but I also decided to add extra cinnamon and vanilla.  I also suggest parchment paper over a foiled cookie sheet for easier clean up.  Remove the nuts quickly from the pan otherwise they will stick.

These are great!  I also added a tsp of vanilla and subbed in 1/2 C brown sugar.  I ended up with a thick sugar mixture that coated the pecans well, but also made them all stick together into a sheet that I had to break apart later. Definitely bake on parchment paper! Next time I will try the ziplock method, dividing the wet from the sugar, which I think will help out immensely.

Gave these out to neighbor as mini gifts during the holidays. Everyone loved them. I tried using half brown sugar/half white sugar, but it seemed to make them a bit sticky/gooey. Would stick with white sugar next time.

I served these at several Christmas gatherings and received many compliments.  They're addictive!

edited to add that I did not make any changes to the recipe.

Oh my goodness! Oh my! These are the best!!  I am sure the recipe as written is fantastic, but I did change a couple things based on the recommendations of others. I used about 1.5 egg whites, versus just one.  I also added a bit of vanilla into the tablespoon of water and I was a little generous on the 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I didn't need the Ziplock bags, that seemed like extra fuss.  Just mixed the dry ingredients in one big mixing bowl and the egg whites and water in another big bowl. Tossed the pecans in each bowl and voila.  They turned out fantastic and I will have a hard time keeping away from them before Christmas.  AMAZING!!

If I could give these 5 more stars I would... They were super easy to make and people in my family who don't normally like nuts at all couldn't stop eating them... They were actually fighting over them! LOL I got a great pic of them and I will upload it soon... :)

This recipe definitely produces a delicious product which parallels those sold is stores at the holiday time.  I used 1T vanilla instead of water as suggested by another review.  Next time I will try brown/white sugar mixture.

I love this recipe for gifts. It's a great treat that can be used so many ways. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used brown/white combo. I also used vanilla in place of 1 tsp. water. The temp and time work very well and give a perfect appearance. My other recipe cooks for an hour and they don't look pretty after they are done. I'm sticking with this recipe.

I made this for the Thanksgiving luncheon at our office, and everybody loved them.  I got so many requests for the recipe that I finally just sent everyone an email with the web link!  (grin)

These don't look like much when you're mixing them, or even halfway through baking them, but when they're done they are well worth the little effort it took to make them.  

Lovely recipe!

I added one more egg and a bit more vanilla, and they were fantabulous! My husband wouldn't stop eating them-until I hid them. My mother, who does not at all enjoy pecans liked them. (and I don't like pecans, but the recipe looked interesting) I love making them, and I love eating them!

My first time ever making candied pecans...and they came out GREAT! My girlfriend wouldnt even let them cool from the oven they smelled so good.

As with most people, I modified this recipe. I used 1 tablespoon vanilla instead of water, but also ended up adding two tablespoons of water. I also split the pecans with almonds for some different flavors and textures.Other than that, I kept it the same.

Excellent! I also subbed one teaspoon of vanilla for one of the teaspoons of water. Although I should have tried it with "Splenda" I made it as is and decided if I only make it once a year, on Christmas, then I'd be okay with the sugar.

This recipe is awesome!!! I made it with my Grandmas pecans out of her yard in Thomasville GA and I cant stop making them since. Everytime we finish some we are thinking about the next batch. They are yummy eaten alone or over peach n ice cream too or over any other dessert.

I made this yesterday just to try something new and it was AMAZING!!!  My boyfriend and all the guys that live in his house couldn't stop eating it.  I used mix nuts to try something new and modified the recipe from what other reviewers had said.  I used 2 egg whites instead of 1, vanilla instead of water, and I omitted the salt and just bought salted nuts.  They taste just like the ones we get from Chicago....YUM!!!!

I made this for a skin care party I was having, but unfortunately only few people made it.  So, I had quite a bit of leftover of these pecans, but all my guests asked if they could take some home!  They were a huge hit.  Definitely use vanilla instead of water and double the egg white.  Use ziplog bags to coat.  Much easier.

This is a great recipe as written, and the pecans turn out great every-time I've made them. I've also adjusted the 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar & vanilla instead of water as suggested and that batch turned out great also. You can't go wrong with this simple, effective recipe.

What a fabulous recipe! I have never made anything like this and I was a little nervous how easy it would be to coat the nuts with the egg mixture and with the sugar mixture. But it was a breeze! And the results are wonderful!

This recipe is so easy to make and so good.    I made it twice, the first time with mixed nuts and then with only pecans.  I felt it worked best with pecans. The crunchy coating tended to come off of the smooth surfaces of some nuts.  They are hard to stay away from.   I will be making these again.

I made a small batch over the holidays.  I used some vanilla and I did the 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar combination that others suggested.  They were gone very quickly and people were asking for the recipe.  I will be making these again.

These are really easy to make and addictive.  I made these for Christmas gifts putting them in inexpensive glass jars tied with ribbon.  I'll be making these year after year for gifts since making them are much easier than cookies,which is a time saver for me.

These are totally addicting. I used them as an appetizer for Christmas, and cooked them along with the ham in the oven which worked very well. I used whole pecans. I made the whole thing again the next day and used water to whip eggs, then I also added the vanilla, which I would do again because they came out even better. I buttered foil on a cookie sheet to save clean-up. Also, beware that the nuts stick together and clump unless you spread them apart, if you care about that. They are tasty warm and perhaps even better the next day so you can make them ahead of time.

These were awesome! At first I didn't think I used enough pecans (I just measured out 2 cups) because it was kind of gooey going into the oven. After about a 1/2 hour of baking, I sort of "sampled" one and after that I kept opening the oven door to sample more! These were fabulous! My mom told me not to bring her any, so I only brought over 4 to try (we are constantly trying to watch our waistlines), well she was begging for the recipe the next day. This is a definite keeper! I also changed as others suggested to 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar as well as 1 tsp vanilla. Awesome!

This is a great recipe, and I have sent it out to many of my friends. I have changed it a bit according to the other reviews, and it has turned out well. If you want the mall like nuts, this is the recipe. I will have to try other nuts, Thanks for this one!

These nuts taste just like the ones that you buy at festivals.  So good.  I actually used cashews instead of pecans and they were wonderful.  I also made the modifications that several other reviewers suggested:  2 egg whites, 1 T of vanilla extract insteadf of water, and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  Excellent!

OMG!!!   Love, Love, LOVE this recipe!!!! Made 5 pounds this past weekend to give as gifts!  I too altered the recipe slightly.  I did 2 egg whites, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla as suggested.  They were awesome!  However, I baked them at 250 degrees for about an hour as the recipe calls for.  I tried the first batch at a higher temp for a shorter time, but they came out slightly over cooked...  DELICIOUS!!!!!

If I could rate these higher than five stars, I would. They are so easy to make and absolutely delicious.

I make these every holiday season (put in gift tins) for colleagues and friends. People love them and look forward to them every year.

Instead of a tablespoon of water, I use vanilla.

Thanks so much for the great recipe!

WOW!!!  So easy yet so unbelievably DELICIOUS.  I doubled the cinnamon, replaced the water with vanilla extract, and used splenda baking mix instead of the sugar.  Will definitely be making this again.
UPDATE: I've made this with walnuts and it is surprisingly really really good!

This recipe was great!! I made it with pecans the first time.  I had leftover peanuts (from failed peanut brittle) and mixed nuts (from Chex Mix).  I used the leftovers the second time and it was awesome.  Definitely use the 2 gallon bags--makes clean up easy.

Very simple recipe... followed suggestions to double egg whites, doubled the cinnamon, and use Vanilla instead of Water.  Took finished product to work and they disappeared rather quickly.  Many positive comments.  I only wish I added more sugar... I thought pecan could have been sweeter... however, the majority at work rules and thus the 5 stars

I followed the advice of many others and used 2 egg whites, vanilla in place of the water and also 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar.  These were amazing!  Hopefully there will be some left for gifts!

I made these for my annual Christmas Party last night and they were a huge hit! Gave the recipe out to several guests.  On a side note these made my house smell like Colonial Williamsburg while they were baking. A new tradition for me.  This review actually belongs to sugar and spiced nuts.  Sorry for the confusion

Awesome recipe.  I doubled the recipe by using 1 lb. pecans and 1 lb. almonds.  Also, I used 1/2 Tbs. of vanilla as suggested in a previous comment to replace some of the water.

Oh my goodness!  These are incredible...my husband ate the whole batch in one night, and wanted to know when I would be making more.  I can't believe how easy these are to make.  I put the wet mixture in one bag and the dry in another, lined my baking sheet with foil, and had absolutely no clean up.

I made this today for our picnic and everone loved it! I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions, such as doubling the eggwhites and the cinnamon, and substituting half of the water with vanilla, and it turned out perfect. Everyone loved it and was so impressed. Even my picky kids loved it! This is definitely a keeper!

These pecans are incredible!  I made them as a snack for a family gathering and everyone begged for the recipe.  I would definitely recommend adding an additional 1/4 teaspoon of cinnmamon and 1 more egg white for moisture.

PHENOMENAL!!!  I got a dozen requests for this recipe when I served it!!!  Though I did use turbinado (cane) sugar instead of white. The flavor was wonderful!!  They're going to be my Christmas host gift this year!!

I don't care for nuts, but everyone that has tried these has loved them.  They are not the most attractive things and are really good.

These are yummy and so easy to make.  I make them to put on salads and just to munch on.  I make them just like the recipe says and have never been disappointed.

Mmm... these are so good! I've made this recipe several times now, and they always come out fantastic! I substitute vanilla for the water, and I add a couple shakes of ground nutmeg and ground ginger. My husband always asks me to make these on weekends. They never last long!

Share?  No way!  These are mine!  OK, but only a stingy few.  These are great, not quite like what I get at the fair, but close enough.  I did add a tad more cinnamon as I really like that flavor.  Next time I think I'll use a fancier grade of cinnamon to up the flavor.  Will definitely make these again and hide them.

These pecans are so good! I made 1 batch and took them to work and everyone wanted the recipe. I did the same as others, I used half white and half brown sugar, used vanilla instead of water and 1 tsp cinnamon and I also did the ziploc bag idea, I put the pecans in the ziploc bag and put the egg white mixture in and mixed it up then put the sugar mixture in the same bag mixed them up and spread them out on a parchment lined cookie sheet, yummy, I will be making another batch this week for a Christmas party. Thank you for this recipe

If you're looking for a pretty nut, these aren't it, but boy are they tasty.  I did as suggested and added more egg whites, and vanilla, but I found I had to bake them closer to 1 1/2 hours to get that nutty flavor I expected.  I also used Pampered Chef's Cinnamon Plus and it really added an exciting twist.  I paired these with the Marvelous Mocha Mix recipe found here and put them in tins for teacher's gifts.

I made these nuts yesterday for a party, last night. What a hit! All night...over and over...you could hear..."These are incredible....who made the nuts???" People were camped out in front of the bowls....hoping there would be some left over to bring home. I made 5 pounds ( 3 of pecans and 2 of walnuts)Only a few crumbs were left. I had to promise to make more and mail them to a few out of town guests.

I made them with vanilla instead of water. Otherwise, followed the directions. So easy to make and so wonderful to eat! For now on...this is what I will bring to all my gatherings. 

Thank you for this fabulous recipe!!

-5 stars all the way!!  My house smelled like the shopping malls at Christmas.  I used Almonds for this recipe and used vanilla as some of the other reviewers did in place of the water.  LOVED the end product!!

Great recipe! It is as good as the Chinese candied walnuts on this website, only less messy because you don't have to deep fry the nuts. I will serve this for tomorrow dinner party.

Holy Cow are these things good.  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the egg mixture, and went a little crazy with the cinammon (can't help it, I love the stuff).  Very simple to make and was a huge hit with the wife and kid.

This recipe was excellent.  I made it the day before Thanksgiving.  It was gone by morning so I had to make another batch for guests.  This time I added extra cinnamon and it was even better.

Very easy, I added the extra egg white like suggested, but forgot the vanilla idea. Maybe that would have made them sweeter. My mom thought they were perfect. She doesn't like sweet as much as I do. I tried to do them in my convection oven but had to switch from 175 degrees to 275 degrees half way through. (I didn't have a 250 degree button) I used a Pampered chef Cooking stone so I didn't have to stir every 15 minutes, but I should have used parchment paper. These are going to be good for the holidays. K

Didn't have pecans at the time. It's great with walnuts too.They were better than the ones we paid big money for at the mall.

I made these for Thanksgiving.  They were such a hit that my brother-in-law ran up to the store to buy more pecans so I could make another batch!  This is a great and easy recipe.

My family can't get enough of these yummy pecans! We add them to a baby spinach salad topped with crumbled gorgonzola, sliced red onion, grilled chicken and a simply balsamic and olive oil dressing drizzled over the top. Even the presentation of this dish looks gourmet and will impress your guests! They are also great just out of the oven sprinkled over vanilla ice cream. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe, very tasty and quite simple.  Seems like a great recipe to have in a bowl around the holidays.  Consider doubling the recipe, however, as they disappear fast.

This recipe is great! I added more cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and a dash of ground cloves, replaced the water with rum and they were even better! Even my sister who doesn't like  nuts couldn't stop eating them.

People have gone nuts over this recipe.  I actually made it twice, once with the vanilla that everyone suggested and once without.  I liked it better without.  I also sprayed the pan with a non stick cooking spray and had no problems with it sticking.

I have made these over and over. I love this recipe it is so easy to make. I have made it with sugar and splenda with almonds and pecans and I love it every way I have tried it. I prefer substituting the vanilla for the water and sometimes add a little butter flavor too. I also increase the cinnamon as others have suggested.

I chose this recipe to use up some pecans I had leftover from Christmas.  This recipe is wonderful!  I think I will start giving these pecans as Christmas gifts next year.
 I added some nutmeg, and used a bit more cinnamon.

This recipe was a HUGE hit for our early family christmas and I have made some as gifts in tins for Christmas presents for my children and they love them. I even made a batch for my Mother who is diabetic and used summersweet.  Turned out great!  I shook all the pecans in a brown paper bag in the end to get all the clumps of sugar off and it made them even more presentable. Fun and Easy to make!

I decided to try this with raw blanched peanuts instead of pecans and was very pleased.  Everyone loved them.

Because some people commented on having a sticking problem, I used parchment paper on my sheet and shook off any extra sugar before I spread them out.  I had no problems at all.

These were a huge hot with my whole family.  They were all surprised at how easy these are to make.  I did add a whole teaspoon of cinnamon instead of just the half, but I really like cinnamon.  I think this recipe would be great with any type of nut you prefer.  Next time I will try them with almonds.

Great!  Just like the sugar coated nuts that smell so good at the mall.  Easy to make and turned out great.

These are great.  I just made my 4th batch since Thanksgiving.  A tip to help stirring them - I line my tray with parchment paper.  Then when it's time to stir I lift the corners to toss the nuts and then I respread them with a spatula.

These are the most excellent sugar pecans I have ever tasted!  I tried other recipes, but this is by far the best.  I changed the ammount of cinnamon to one teaspoon.  THANKS!!! This makes a great gift.

Wow! These look a little like popcorn chicken! I expected a tray of toasted pecans that tasted of sugary cinnamon, but they almost look battered! Anyway, they taste fabulous (husband is currently scoffing them in a zombie-like trance...)!! Superb recipe! Thanks, Carolyn!

These are absolutely delicious!  The recipe makes a very generous portion and lends itself to putting in jars as gifts.  It is a simple recipe to follow and make.  The only problem is that I think I have a new addiction.  Yummy!

I had previously given this recipe 2 stars when I tried it a couple years ago. I don't know what I did wrong back then, but my old oven ran hot and that could've been the problem. I tried them again and they turned out spectacular. I'm so glad I gave them another chance. I figured 300+ cooks couldn't be wrong! I covered my cookie sheet with aluminum foil sprayed with Pam, and used a mixture of pecans and almonds. Other than that, didn't change a thing. They were awesome! I'm going to give them away in Christmas gift baskets.

These are nothing short of FANTASTIC!  After reading other reviews, I increased the cinnamon by a 1/4 tsp. and used vanilla instead of water.  Tried the recipe with sugar, then made another batch with Splenda and both were great. These are so delicious and SO EASY to make that everybody will be getting them at Christmas.

I've been making these for years, substituting vanilla for the water in the same ratio.  My other advice is to use whatever baking sheet you have with the largest sides(lip) (or an aluminum one from the store).  This helps keep pecans from falling down into your oven as you stir them.  I have friends bring me pecans so that I'll make these for them. They're really addictive!

AMAZING!  These are so simple to make and taste delicious. I also made these with Splenda-you would never know the difference. When I added the pecans to the sugar mixture, I covered the bowl with plastic wrap and shook it for one minute. It got the nuts perfectly coated with the sugar mixture and no mess!  I also doubled the amount of cinnamon.  Next time I will try vanilla for the liquid. My house smells heavenly still from cooking the nuts. I will definitely be making these in the future. This batch was for gifts. I put them in clear plastic "treat bags" and tied the top with ribbon. : )

So easy to prepare, and an absolute hit at any gathering. I used Splenda in place of the sugar and no one could tell. It was delicious, and everyone at the Memorial Day Family gathering asked for the recipe.

Week after week this is the number 1 recipe.  So I thought I would try them to find out why.  Awesome!  Is there an easy way to stir them?  The first stir makes them go clump all together.  But that is ok when you taste the results!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

The flavor was good but I screwed up badly by keeping the temperature higher because I was baking something else at the time. I had a big mess on my hands and ended up throwing the pan and nuts away. Will try again but will pay strict attention to them while baking.

These are so easy to make and taste so good.  I increased the cinnamon to one teaspoon to increase the flavor just a bit and it was wonderful.

Because I can’t have regular sugar, I used coconut brown sugar and my husband loved them. I also baked them on parchment paper: no sticking. Another time, I added 1 tsp vanilla. These are now a regular, healthy, protein snack .

Very good.  I do add a little vanilla and use half cup of dark brown sugar instead of white.  Flipping is needed to keep from sticking.  My first batch was a disaster.   I use pampered chief stone ware and do not grease the pan.

These pecans make a great, easy snack to make for your family or for gifts.  I have tried it with vanilla instead of water and much prefer the recipe using water.  I do add a pinch of nutmeg and chili powder for my preference, but the recipe is good as it is written.

Easy and delicious.  The pecans are crunchy when done.   I followed reviews and doubled the cinnamon, 1/2 vanilla 1/2 water, and added a pinch of nutmeg.   In the past l have added some cayenne pepper with the cinnamon, adds a real spicy flare to them.

Made 4 batches tonight.  AWESOME!  Two batches exactly by the recipes.  Two batches I added 1 full teaspoon of un-sweetened cocoa powder - WOW!!! just the right amount of chocolate to give it a wonderful flavour but not overwhelming.  Will make it this way everytime from now on!!

I increased the cinnamon  to 1 -2 tsp.  Liberally butter the pan before putting  in nuts .  Use a gallon ziplock bag to mix dry ingredients, then add your nuts, zip shake and pour into your pan.  The butter is what sets these nuts apart.   Only about 1 teaspoon makes the difference.

DE - LI - CIOUS !!! Made per the recipe w/ 2 egg whites. I can't stop eating them! Not sure why people are wasting Ziplocs when you should just simply mix them in the same bowl as the sugar mix after coating with egg. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! Even my 5yo says they're delicious!

We joke that these should be considered illegal drugs because they are so delicious and addicting. For a full pound of pecans, I use 2 eggs (vs 1 egg) and substitute the 1 tbsp of water for 1 tbsp of vanilla.

These are wonderful! The only thing I changed was the cinnamon to 1Tbs and just a pinch of salt. It was also easier to coat the pecans in the egg white mixture, then add sugar mixture just a little at a time. Much easier to coat! Be sure to stir every 15 minutes or they’ll stick like crazy, even to parchment paper.

I made the recipe as is, made no changes, and it turned out great! I'd make these again in a heartbeat, they were so easy.  These would be perfect stocking stuffers for the holidays.

These pecans are great. My little twist, omit the water and add 1+ tablespoon of Rum, Sailor Jerry. Alcohol cooks off but leaves a good flavor.

These are great for the sweet tooth and to share as a gift. I have made them numerous times and depending on who they are for, I add some Chili powder or for more zip, Cayenne and I find the contrast between sweet and spicy makes them even more addictive as a snack on game day. Never been disappointed. When I've made them as a gift to be shipped, I will vacuum seal them before wrapping and sending them.

Used two tsp of water and 1 tsp of vanilla instead of just a tablespoon of water

Also used two egg whites.

Made these to take along to an outdoor concert.  I shared with everyone around me and they went crazy.  I owe a lot of people this recipe...  I am going to try adding some different seasonings to see if I like more than just cinnamon and sugar.

Warning, these are so delicious it's difficult to eat just a few. I did add a few drops of vanilla extract to the frothy egg mixture and then dabbed a bit of the vanilla extract onto the pecans when I turned them the first time.  The recipe is so simple, yet your friends and family will be amazed you made them.  I added them to a fresh spinach salad which included oranges, dried cranberries, avocado, chicken and either feta or goat cheese (the cheese or chicken can be eliminated depending on your liking).  This one's a keeper!

First of all, these are excellent, and I didn't change the ingredients themselves in any way. I did only have a 10 oz bag of pecans, so I adjusted for 8 servings (down from the default 12) but didn't decrease the egg white/water amounts. Those were still 1 egg white to 1 tablespoon of water. =*=*= I used the 8-serving amounts for the sugar (2/3 cup), salt (1/2 tsp) and cinnamon (1/4 tsp with a tiny bit more because I eyeballed it in a 1/2 tsp spoon), and just the 10 oz of pecans. =*=*= Per another reviewer, I did start out with a 300-degree oven, but only kept them at that temp for a half hour. I turned it down to 250 for the 2nd half hour's time just because I was afraid of them becoming too hard to eat. I'm not certain the higher temp would have hurt them, since that reviewer never had a problem with 300 degrees. =*=*= I had them on a large, shiny cookie sheet on parchment paper, no spray or anything. I turned them twice during baking and then after they came out of the oven to make sure they weren't stuck. =*=*= The coating and flavor are spot-on to what I wanted in a cinnamon-sugared nut, with no other ingredients added. I've saved this recipe to use again and as my go-to for something easy to make for a party or other special occasion.

Made these on a whim to bring to holiday gatherings this year. These were enjoyed by all, as well as being easy to make. I pretty much followed the recipe the first time and, while very good, I felt it could use more cinnamon. The next time, I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp and liked it even better. 

As for the egg white and water, I was able to cover 20oz of pecans with the amounts listed in this recipe (the bags I had were 10oz each). My pecans came out tasty with a bit of a candy crunch from the sugar coating.

I make these every year and exactly per the recipe.  I make two separate  one pound batches at a time, mixing each recipe separately (one egg white each), baking in two separate trays, and switching each tray at each fifteen minute stir.  Sounds complicated, but it's not.  Two pounds is never enough.  They are so wonderfully delicious, sweet, a WOW-pop of tasty crunch.  Once you make them, try them, share them, you will be hooked on them and will be making two separate one pound batches of your own.

I ran out of the sugar mixture twice and had to make more.  The sugared nuts were not as crisp as I would like but it may have been the pecans I used.  They were not as plump as I usually get.  The flavor was good but I also might use a little more cinnamon next time.  Certainly an easy recipe.

Rave reviews from a gathering I took this to! Except I used raw cane sugar and Saigon cinnamon. Also used unsalted butter to coat pan. Excellent!

I followed the recipe exactly and I was blown away by how good these were. I made them for a cocktail party and was planning on having them sitting on the bar for people to snack on while waiting for their drinks. Only half the batch made it to the party. These are definitely going in our holiday rotation.

These are awesome!! I make them every year around Christmas.  Be sure to make plenty to give a gifts . I use 2 lbs. of pecans and double everything,  except 2 eggs I use 4 so my pecans are coated well. I also use a splash of vanilla in addition to the water. They never disappoint.  YUM!!

I love this recipe and get asked for it many times.  I find I only need half the sugar mix for the 1 lb of pecans.  Also I mix the pecans with the egg white mixture and then just sprinkle in the sugar mixture a bit at a time - stirring between additions.  It makes it just a one bowl recipe.  Also, if you bake them on parchment paper there is no sticking and no mess to clean up.

These pecans are delicious! I recently found candied pecans while on a trip in Mexico and I was regretting not buying more when the small bag I purchased ran out. This recipe is very easy and tastes similar to the baked nut treats we enjoyed in Jalisco. I went with the modifications of 2 egg whites and vanilla...this is a perfect addition to  Christmas gift baskets.

So good. I used pumpkin pie spice rather than just cinnamon. They are the perfect snack not too sweet but way better than just leaving nuts out for your guests.

These turned out fantastic. A true crowd pleaser.
Although many reviewers recommend reducing the amount of sugar, I believe the recipe is great as is (my second batch is in the oven as I write, and it has more sugar and cinnamon than indicated as I wanted to try).
Loved it!!

These are SO addicting!! The only thing I changed was adding 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/2 tsp.  I know some people said to use half white sugar/ half brown sugar but I believe you will get more of a chewy texture vs nice and crunchy. I can only recommend this recipe if you are willing to gain a few pounds cause there is no way you will stop after having just one!

I make these all the time, especially around the holidays. I make mine with brown sugar instead of white. A dash of  cayenne pepper to the dry ingrediants is my own special signature!
My family goes bonkers for these crispy delites.

Great recipe. I prefer brown sugar so I do half brown half white but otherwise no other changes. These disappear as soon as I put them out.

I made these per the recipe. They were excellent. I only wish I would have made more! It is important to flip them every 15 minutes or so. Muffin cups are perfectly for dividing up single servings.

Out of this world... addictive. A quick bit of advice. Make a double (or triple) batch the first time and save yourself some the trouble of doing it again the next day. Also, follow the recipe to the letter. There's no need to alter an already perfect recipe.

Very good recipe!! I found that the recommended amount of sugar, cinnamon, and salt was not enough for a whole pound of pecans. This recipe is good for a half pound of pecans. In sum, they turned out to be very sweet yet very addicting!! Will definitely make again.

I started searching for a "Mall Nuts" recipe after trying some tasty sugar cashews in the local mall.  I thought, surely there hast to be a way to make these cheaper at home and thankfully I found this recipe!  

I used 2 (10 oz.) packages of pecans + 1 (16 oz) package of cashews and tripled the other ingredients in the recipe.  I also added some vanilla (as the recipe's creator mentioned in her update/review).  I used two large baking sheets to roast the nuts.

The whole house smelled so wonderful as these were baking.  It smelled heavenly!  After the nuts cooled the kids and I started munching on them and had to stop ourselves from eating them all!   I strongly dislike recipes that have nuts in them and am not a nut person, but I LOVE these cinnamon nuts.  

I packaged the nuts up in little treat bags (approx. 1 1/4 c. nuts per bag) and have given them out for Christmas.  Perfect!

Me and my family love this recipe. Around Christmas time we are always making these for our neighbors and us. My daughter is always asking for some more pecans and it hurts me to say that we won't till about the week of Christmas. Now, I am thinking about making them in other times other than Christmas. In fact, they are so delicious that I probably will. I just wanted to say that these are so good. I also use two egg whites with a teaspoon of vanilla. Makes them taste great!

Great recipe, I used 2 egg white version.  When I ran out of cinnamon, I substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice.  Came out deliciousl
2018 update.  I forgot to use 2 egg whites, the recipe turned out fine.  But for ease of preparation I use parchment paper on my cookie sheets.  It makes the stirring and transferring a breeze.  As I still don't have cinnamon, I used apple pie spice.  This recipe is bulletproof.

These were very easy and so yummy!  I made them just as written, but I'm thinking next time I might just cut back on the sugar a bit as you might not notice too much.

They vanished in our house quickly just munching on them, but I bet they'd be awesome on top of waffles, ice cream or yogurt.

As far as the method, I mixed the nuts with the egg white and water, then poured the nuts into the granulated sugar and cinnamon (may have added more cinnamon); mixed thoroughly, then poured them in a pan and baked as per instructions, tossing them every 15 minutes.  Excellent outcome, delicious treat, they make a really nice gift.

Simple recipe.  I followed it with the exception of bumping up the cinnamon a bit.

I was hosting a holiday insider brunch at my cooking school.
I used the recipe as a launching point, but added a bit of twist. I beat the egg white mixture until soft peak, not just frothy. Then added about 1/4 cup melted butter to the bottom of the pan that was going in oven. It looks all kinds of 'wrong' when you first put in the oven, but by the time the hour is up ,you have sweet , crunchy pecans with a white sugary coating.

These would have been better had I not made the mistake of having them on lower rack in the oven (somewhat burnt-sweet flavor despite stirring them every 15 min). Next time will make sure to keep on higher rack. Also could use more cinnamon which seems to be general suggestion from other reviews.

I've made these multiple times to great fanfare with some slight variations. Instead of cinnamon and salt, I use kosher salt (3/4T instead of 3/4t regular salt) and no cinnamon so they are sweet/salty. I also bake for 1 1/2 hour so they are extra crisp. I'm not a fan of 'meaty' pecans and I find the extra two 15 minute sets in the oven really cook all the nuts completely. A tip for making less mess is to use two layers of parchment paper instead of a greased cookie sheet (bonus, you can pick up the paper to pour the pecans into a container easier). 

The amount of nuts, sugar, and egg white are the perfect amount for this recipe.

Oh my these are perfectly wonderful!  I was using a recipe that required constant stirring for at least 20 minutes on the stove top and still they would not turn out or burn 2 out of 3 times.  This is a great time saver and they are perfect for salads.

My family loves theses nuts. Besides using the nuts as a snack these are fabulous to add to salads around the holidays when you have leftover turkey. A nice chef salad with these on top- nothing is better.  I don't change a thing with the recipe. I've tried with and without vanilla as someone else recommended and it really is good both ways.

I made a half portion because I've tried many recipes that turned out to be horrifying! But I will definitely be making a double batch within the next couple days. This is the perfect way to make candied/sugared pecans! They have an amazing texture, and taste! Great for a snack or on top of  my strawberry and spinach salad! They were a hit for my whole family! (even my absurd dog whom is picky about steak)!

These were so delicious! I added just a tad bit of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick and it tested like the roasted pecans from Wendy's.

I LOVE cinnamon, so I did double the cinnamon to 1tsp, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I now have a who tray full of lightly sweet, crispy almonds.  Delicious.  I lined my pan with heavy duty foil, then sprayed it with regular Pam, no sticking issues here. I do wish they tasted a *little* more like the fair nuts, but I suspect that they have a different roasting method that gives them their distinct flavor. I will definitely make these again.

I made 2.5 pounds, so i adjusted the recipe using a lot of tips. I used 5 egg whites, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup stevia, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 cup cane sugar, 2 tsp vanilla.  I let it go about 20 minutes extra in oven because my pecans had been cold when i started, i had a large amount, and it didnt seem quite done yet.

I thought these were amazing when the came out of the oven but wait until they have cooled off for a while and WOW!! I did make a couple of modifications: half white sugar/have brown sugar, a little less salt and vanilla extract in place of the water.

Amazing and so simple to make. Followed recipe exactly except added 1 tsp cinnamon not just the half. No need to add extra egg whites or brown sugar in my opinion as some recommended. They come out perfect! Bonus is it makes your house smell so wonderful while they bake! Perfect for parties and holidays!

You can make this with walnuts or pecans.  I added 1 more egg yolk so the sugar stuck better.  Also, I prefer more cinnamon. Made this for teachers gifts for Christmas.  Everyone raved about it.

Used 2 egg whites and 1 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar and also added 2 T vanilla.   These were perfect!

Quite simple and good.  I made at least 4 batches of this for Christmas.  I lost count!  I made with almonds, walnuts and pecans. The almonds were my favorite.  The only problem is, most the sugar "fell" off the nuts and most of it ended up on the bottom of the baking sheet, not sure if I need more egg whites or water to get it to stick more?  Also at first I thought it needed more cinnamon, but I think this is the right amount in the recipe.

I make candied pecans every year at Christmastime.  This is by far the best, and easiest, that I've ever used.

A HUGE hit for the Christmas holiday, even for my 96 years old grandmother, who grew pecans in WAY Southern Alabama (LA)! Sweet and crunchy just the way it read. Will add this to my annual holiday must haves!

I made it exactly as instructed in the recipe! I've made them several times. Makes about 3 (16 oz) mason jars. Perfect for a small thank you gift  during the holidays.

Best ever. I use maple syrup instead of water for a nod to pecan pie.  Don't add extra spices (like some other recipes on this site recommend).

I used less sugar than the recipe called for.  I used about. Three quarters of  cup instead of the one cup it called for. I also used a little more cinnamon.

Made these today for Christmas gifting. I did 3 different types.  

1. 400 grams Walnut halves, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. 
2. 400 grams Pecan halves, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon.
3. 400 grams Almonds, 1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.

Followed  the recipe as listed. Used baking paper on trays. Oven temp was 120°C for 90 minutes. Stirred every 30 minutes.  Yummy!

Great favorite in my office.  The only things I changed was to use parchment paper and cut down the baking time to 45 minutes.  That way the pecans are softer. Great recipe!

My family loves these!  They hardly wait for them to cool before they dig in!  I've even used almonds when I didn't have any pecans. Great either way, but pecans are our favorite.

These are very good but watch the syrup or you'll have a chewy not crunchy texture on the pecans. I made these along with fudge and cookies as homemade Christmas gifts to friends and family.

Delicious!! I did walnuts while trying this out but have 2 lbs of pecans ready to go ;)  it was equally yummy with walnuts, I made them for a work Thanksgiving potluck as a snack and they were a huge hit! I tweaked the recipe a tiny bit by using half organic white and half brown sugar, just for personal preference, and I loaded the batch up with holiday spices - nutmeg, ginger, cloves, etc. Definitely keeping this as a staple in my recipe book!

These were a huge hit at our family gathering. They are addictive! I followed the advice of others and put the egg whites in one ziplock bag and the sugar mixture in another. Next time, I may try increasing the sugar mixture as some seemed to need more coating despite mixing well and using the entire mixture.

I have made this three times and it turned out AMAZING!!! The third time it burned in 20 min so be careful how much sugar you add to the pecans!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I bake mine on parchment paper and when they are done baking I slide the parchment paper off the baking sheet and onto my counter top to cool.  This will prevent them from burning.

I Love these,  I'm fortunate enough to be able to pick pecans at various parks in my area.  Yeah!  I have made these for over 30 years and my tip is to use Parchment Paper to line your cookie sheet.  Makes it easy to remove cooled nuts and there is no cleanup!!!

Absolutely delicious! Didn't change a thing. I did use nonstick foil instead of cooking spray, worked nicely. Mine only needed to bake 45 mins.

I doubled the cinnamon as others have suggested.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  They were fabulous.  Have made them twice now and doubtless will do so again.

These are delicious little treats to set out at a party or to bring to work to bribe coworkers with.  I've gotten rave reviews from friends and coworkers asking where I bought the candied pecans - they never believe that I made them myself!

I made one modification. I put my dry ingredients in a baggie, and shook the pecans in it after the egg wash. I thought this worked great, no clean up. My pecans did not clump at all, as some mentioned.  The key is a large pan. I used a 17 inch pan with about 2in sides, to be able to spread out the nuts.  You must turn them every 15 min, so they get a chance to dry out, and get crisp.  Just take a spatula, and push them to the end of the pan, then flip them over, then spread them out again,.  Takes a little time, but you will get nuts that you can pick up one by one, no clumps.  You might get one or two that stick together.  These really came out nice and crispy doing this. These were a big hit at my NYE party.  Last year I made the pecans made with brown sugar from this website, but this recipe is better.

I made this for my family and they loved it. Had to make it again! I did however change it a little doing what someone else suggested. I changed it from one egg white to two. I also changed the one tablespoon of water to two teaspoons of water and a teaspoon of vanilla. Works and tastes wonderful! Definitely will be continuing to make this!

These are super easy to make and are a hit with my hubby.  I used 2 egg whites, 1 tbsp of vanilla extract in place of the water and 1 tsp of cinnamon. I folded the pecans into the frothy egg whites then poured the cinnamon sugar mixture right over them and folded until all the pecans were completely coated.  I followed all other directions. 
Thank you for sharing such an incredibly yummy recipe!

For the past 5 years, I have made these for my boss for Christmas. He and his wife look forward to receiving them. They are easy to make, and are better than those that are available for purchase in gourmet shops. I've learned that you CANNOT double the recipe, so 3 or 4 batches, 1 batch at a time. Very well worth the time and effort.

Like many others, I used half the sugar, salt, and cinnamon and it turned out just right.  I also used whole pecans and I found them to work just as good, if not better, than pecan halves.  Great recipe.  Just be sure to leave yourself enough time for the 1 hour bake time and I would also recommend using a bowl bigger than what will hold 1lb of pecans so that you have plenty of room to stir them around.

Everyone LOVES these pecans!   I've been using this recipe for years.  Once the pecans cool, I fill mason jars full and send them out as gifts.   You simply can't go wrong with this recipe and your kitchen will smell like cinnamon-sugar heaven.

I have made these nuts, using walnuts instead of pecans, several times and absolutely love them.  Recipe is easy and best I've tried.  I have passed this recipe on to dozens of my friend, who all rave about them, as well.  I always double the  recipe, mix coated nuts with sugar mixture in a zip lock bag, and bake an additional 15 minutes using a parchment lined cookie sheet.  Very little cleanup.  After reading the other reviews, I may try substituting the water with vanilla.  Sounds  interesting.  Thanks for sharing.  Carolynn Bennett

Excellent! Easy to make and a lovely treat. Family dug in as the tray came out of the oven. But once cooled, these are exceptional. Lovely to put out in a pretty dish for company.

So easy, SO GOOD, and gluten free!  The only consistent change I make is adding a dash of nutmeg - which I highly recommend.  Last time, I mixed in a dash of vanilla extract after beating the egg whites and water.

These are A-FREAKIN-MAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I didn't use quite as much sugar (probaly 3/4 cup) and really didn't measure the cinnamon, but was probably a little more than the recipe, but they are SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!  MAKE THEM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Just follow the directions and stir them every 15 minutes and you won't be disappointed!

Amazing! So easy! Makes a wonderful  and inexpensive holiday gift.  I got large bags from the warehouse club-less than half price of the local grocery store.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty easy and pretty good. It seems like a lot of sugar, but I don't know how it would have turned out if I cut back on it. Would prob cut back on it if I were to make this for mom.

These are awesome! If I could give them ten stars, I would. The only thing I did different was to substitute the tablespoon of water with a tablespoon of vanilla. Compared to what I have paid at the flea market, and the fair, these are very inexpensive to make. You wont be disappointed.

These are just fabulous!  I've made them with Splenda and they taste great that way.  However, my hubby really went over the moon when I made these with walnut halves.  Those went quicker than the pecans.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy--so much like Nutty Bavarian!  Wish I had the contraption they use to mix up the nuts--mine didn't have that gorgeous even coating, but that's not the recipe's fault.

Super easy. Used egg substitute (since I was out of eggs), vanilla to replace water, and threw in a handful of my favorite holiday spices. (nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, a little of this and that...) I would highly recommend a silicone cooking pad for this - after all of the sugar cools you can roll the pad and save the sugar mixture for ice cream toppings! Delicious.

I have never made anything like these before, very easy and super delish! I double the recipe and made it with a batch of almonds and peanuts. The pecans were by far the best, but it still gave a nice coating on the peanuts and almonds! Very good!

I made these for Thanksgiving 2012.  I did use 2 parts white to 1 part brown sugar, and only 1/2 tsp of salt.  Everyone loved these.  I was asked to make them for Christmas too.  When I said I was thinking about maybe adding a bit of cayenne for some heat, in unison, I was told not to change a thing.  While I still think that a bit of cayenne would be good, I am giving in to the rest of the family that want them just as they were the first time.  Really easy, tasty snack!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, I am pretty sure these will be requested for our holidays from now on.

AMAZING!  I didn't want to change too much, but after reading other reviews and being a lover of cinnamon, I did increase the cinnamon to 3/4 tsp.  I also liked the idea of vanilla, but rather than replacing the whole Tbsp. of water, I used 2 tsp. of water and 1 tsp. vanilla.  The house smelled wonderful!  Also, using the gallon baggies was helpful...1 for the egg mixture and 1 for the sugar mixture.  Easy clean-up.  Will definately make these again!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.   Putting them in a salad made of mache with pomegranate seeds and balsamic vinaigrette.  Had to hide them as there would not be enough for the salad!

Excellent. Use them to top whipped toppings on cakes and pies. They add a delicious crunch to them.

I wanted a recipe to learn the technique of sugar coating nuts, so I tried this one because it was one of the highest rated versions.  I thought it was good, the technique worked fine, and level of sweet to salty was great...but for my own taste, it was bland and that was after doubling the cinnamon.  If you don't want overly spiced nuts (pecans) this is great, but if you want something a little stronger, spicier (flavorful, not hot) and exciting, try experimenting with greater amounts of different spices yourself or look for another recipe.

I made these pecans for a Thanksgiving pear & blue cheese salad ( also on this site), and they were amazing.  I misread the salad recipe, and I only needed one cup of nuts, not one pound, but was so happy for my error as my family devoured most of these yummy pecans before I even got the lettuce washed!
 
Easy recipe, I added a touch of vanilla, as suggested by other posters.  Otherwise followed as shown. Will definitely make again, big hit.

My mom & I just made these and they are amazing!!  We doubled the recipe and used 3 egg whites (instead of 2 like the recipe suggests for double the amount or 4 like others said they had).  Ended up being plenty of coating on the outside of the pecans.  It's so addicting!!  :)  You won't be sorry you made this.  P.S.  I did whip my egg whites with my kitchen aid.  I don't know how long you'd have to whip by hand to get it to be as frothy as you'd like.

These are a tasty snack, and also good as a salad topper. Today I used them to top my sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving. I had to roast at 350 F due to other items in the oven but that worked out fine. I stirred every 10 minutes and they were done after a half hour. Try them - you won't be able to resist sneaking a few hot from the oven!

These are delicious! The nuts taste even better after a week in an air tight container because the nuts become firmer. Make sure to stir them every 15 minutes while baking to prevent them from sticking together. I bake them on parchment paper and they come out perfect, plus no clean up :)

Used Jif's recipe for over 15 years.  This is a delicious no fail recipe!  You can add chips, M&M's a chocolate kiss. 
I've also put into the mini-muffin tins and added a Reese's Peanut Butter cup.   
Rave reviews EVERY time I make this basic recipe.

DELICIOUS!! Suuuper tasty. 2 egg whites; 2 tsp water+1 tsp; 1 tsp cinnamon. Taste like a pecan pie's topping (without all the corn syrup), or pecan praline (without the ice cream, et cetra).

I made these last night.  I did make a couple of changes, 1t. water and 2t. vanilla added to the egg white, 1/2c. white sugar, and 1/2c brown sugar, 1t. roasted cinnamon, and 1/2t. sea salt.  I did bake them about 20 minutes longer, they seemed too soft at the hour. THESE ARE AMAZING! I am getting ready to order pecans in bulk, (rather expensive buying just those small bags at the grocery) so that I can back multiple batches for the holidays to give away to friends!  If you like pecans, you will LOVE this!

My son asks for any of the leftovers when I make these. I get requests for the recipe every time I bring this somewhere. This recipe lends itself to adaption with the addition or removal of spices. Wonderful recipe!

Excellent.  I made these and at the last minute, used them as a topping for endive leaves with veggie cream cheese.  I put one on top of the cream cheese and it became a beautiful appetizer.  BUT they are fabulous on their own.  Thanks for the recipe

I've been making these for years..and it's the ONE recipe that is a HIT no matter who i give it to; kids, adults & even non nut-lovers. People love it so much thats it's almost become a curse.  I can't go anywhere without HAVING to bring them!! My only modification is that I add more cinnamon, just a personal preference. Way to go Carolyn!

I have made these several times.  They are easy to make, and they make the house smell wonderful while they are baking.  I usually have to bake them slightly longer than the recipe says, but not by much.  I first made these to use in an apple salad (a la Ruby Tuesday).  They were great in there, but I have to say they are great by themselves.  My wife and my in-laws can sit and eat them like popcorn.    I made no changes.  They are great.  Try them in your own apple salad or on tossed salads with cranberries.  Use your imagination!

These are GREAT! I made the mistake of not mixing salt in with other dry ingredients the first time I made it and had to sprinkle salt on it later one and that was a bad idea. Some pecans were too salty. I corrected this in my second batch and the pecans were delicious. It makes a great holiday treat!

Great recipe!  Make every Christmas now!  If left out they will get eaten up quickly.  They are very easy to make and I don't buy the ones at the malls anymore.  I suggest buying whole pecans from the big wholesale stores as that is cheaper.  But, you will also need a food scale to measure out 1 1b. Thanks submitter.

This recipe was amazing.  I followed what most posters advised: Used vanilla instead of water and upped the cinnamon to 1tsp and it came out perfectly.  I also used the plastic bag method.  I also didn't have a full pound of pecans on me and the mix went into the oven a little wet, so I had to keep it in the oven for about two hours instead of the one.  But when they dried, they were warm and crispy.  It was like eating a Cinna-bon in one pecan.  Once they cooled off, they no longer had that effect but still tasted amazing, just in a different way.  I think making these in bulk and giving them out as a gift is a great idea because they really are delicious and are very presentable.  When the people I made them for took their first bite of a pecan, they literally looked at each other and said, "wow" at the exact same time.  They look great but definitely taste exponentially better.  It's a nice little surprise treat for anyone :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone LOVED these! I used 2 egg whites with 1 tbsp. water and 1 tsp. vanilla and I used a whole tsp. of cinnamon, but will increase the amount of cinnamon next time because we barely noticed it. I also did keep them in the oven an extra 5 minutes probably due to the extra egg white. Yummy!

Fabulous - and so easy. I toast the nuts (and I've used all kinds) a bit first. Used 1 t. cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg too.  Followed Jocyln's directions for the egg white/sugar mixture.

Great recipe.  Made it for a christmas party and everyone loved the nuts.  I made 4lbs this holiday and will make the nuts in the future.  Modified the recipe by adding more cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla flavoring.

I am waiting on these to come out of the oven and have eaten about half already!  I tripled the amount of cinnamon for more flavor and used vanilla instead of water.  LOVE this recipe, thank you, Carolyn!

Wow!! These are fantastic!  I made some using pecans halves for snacking and another batch with coarsely-chopped pecans that I tossed into a salad.  I did chop the pecans before tossing them in the egg white mixture rather than chop them afterwards.  I made them at Christmastime, and my family gobbled them up.  This is one recipe I will make again and again!

These nuts are great.  The only reason i gave them 4 stars is for appearance.  It may be because I followed others suggestions and used 2 egg whites that they seemed to have too much "coating" on them.  I will say though that the taste was OUTSTANDING.  I will use these for snacking and salads.  Thanks.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for... easy, fast and delicious! I made 2 double batches and got so many compliments that I had to make 2 more for gift tins. I've never gone through 8 pounds of pecans so quickly in my life!! Delicious - everyone asked for the recipe! Note: I did use additional cinnamon and definitely use the vanilla with the water! They turned out crunchy and delicious!

It was good as written, but using the suggestions of vanilla in place of water, and doubling the cinnamon, made them even better.

These pecans are incredible! I followed Mary Domaz's version and they turned out perfect. Everyone on Thanksgiving was completely addicted to them and they disappeared very quickly.

Delicious and a perfect addition to Christmas cookie plates!  I follwed the recipe exactly, except I took other's advice and replaced the water with vanilla extract.  Made the house smell wonderful and will definately make again.

These are great.  My hubby loved them.  He's a real pecan fan.  I thought they were going to be too sweet for him but they are not that sweet at all.  I will definately keep this recipe and use again.

This recipe is so easy and so yummy. I did put a little extra cinnamon and I did use 2 egg whites and 2 tbs of water for extra moisture for the sugar mixture to stick to. Can't wait to make them again for friends.

I used equal parts of water and vanilla. They disappeared in minutes after putting them out for my book club.

Wow! Surprised to find this recipe here.  I have been making these pecans for over 15 years, and don't even remember where I got the recipe from.  Nice to see that others are enjoying them too.

Great recipe.  I made them mixed with almonds as well.  Pecans are best.  The family loved them.

Just be sure not to over bake them and since oven temps vary, I have an oven thermometer...a great idea since I bake cakes & cookies often, too. I placed them in small mason jars with a decorated lid for office gifts last Christmas and everyone loved them!  These are absolutely WONDERFUL!

Oh my goodness these are soooooo good!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and they turned out perfect.   I made them for a party tomorrow, but am afraid I might eat them all before I get them there!   Thanks for a great recipe! Note: These got rave reviews at the party!  Just like me people could not stop eating them!   Will be making these on a regular basis!

While these were really good, I have to say, I've made sugared pecans in a pan before and they are even better!  I would add more vanilla as suggested by others.  My pecans weren't pretty since I just tossed it all in the mixing bowl of egg whites.  If you want it to look nice to give it to someone, I think coating them using ziplock bags would work better.

I make these every year when it starts getting chilly. Not only are they amazing, but they make your house smell absolutely incredible when you are toasting. I have started to include them in our Christmas gift baskets and people just rave about them!

I wanted some pecans for my salad, and these are excellent.  A word of caution, though:  You might want to have a few people around when they're done, otherwise you might eat the whole batch by yourself! I halved the recipe.  Changes were 1 t. water, 1/2 t. vanilla; only stirred 3 times and baked for 65 minutes.  Let cool on cookie sheet.  Cleanup was easy - just soak the pan for a few minutes and the sugar comes right off.  These are crunchy/crispy and VERY good!!  Thanks!

This recipe was very good. Unlike the Candied Pecans you buy at the mall kiosk, these are much better once they cool down. I think the flavor could be improved by some more cinnamon, but overall it was a recipe we will use again.

These are delicious!  I have made them several times now and I always get compliments on them.  I have also been asked for the recipe many times.  Really excellent and easy to prepare.  You could pay a lot of money for these if you bought them in a store, but made yourself for a very reasonable price!

WOW......just like everyone before me, we absolutely loved these nuts :-) I added one tsp. vanilla to the egg whites and that gave the finished pecans a nice flavor. I also used 1/3 C brown sugar +2/3 white sugar. This recipe will be a favorite of mine.

I made the recipe as it is printed an these were a hit at Christmas.  Some reviewers are adding an extra egg white, but I felt as though the sugar got a little clumpy on some of the nuts, so I was thinking of adding less next time.

These are great...I was just looking for a recipe for a salad but these are addicting!  Make sure you use all of the sugar/cinamon mixture.  I thought it looked like too much but some ended up not being covered completely.

I made this recipe for the first time at Thanksgiving for my husband and two boys.  It was gone in one day.  At Christmas, I decided to take some to my in-laws.  They couldn't believe that I made it!  My mother-in-law asked me for the recipe for her next event - high praise from her!

This recipe was a hit at my neighbors Christmas party.  When she told me how easy it was I was quite surprised.  I made it for my family Christmas dinner and it truly was easy and delish.  I will never purchase sugar coated pecans again.

Follow some of the others input and used 2 egg whites, 1 T. vanilla (instead of water) and 1 full teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  They were devoured and I was asked for the recipe several times at a party.

Easy to make. Use plastic bags to cut down on the mess. I've never had a problem with clumping. Are you sure you're turning the pecans every 15 minutes?

YUM! My 7 year old made these for me on Thanksgiving day for an appetizer (I did the stirring in the oven)! We were munching on these non-stop all day long. Ironically it was my 7 year old who did not like them, but then she doesn't like nuts at all.

These pecans are so evenly coated that my guests were asking me how I did it. This recipe is too easy! 

Thank you for a great recipe!

I was very excited to find this recipe and pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to make. My husband's sister in-law makes these and he loves them. Now I can make them for him!

I have made these a few times now, and they are so easy and so good.  I plan to give them as part of Christmas treat bags.  I follow the recipe exactly, but maybe next time I will try the white sugar/ brown sugar mix just for variety.  You can't go wrong with this one!

I cannot believe how delicious these are when they are SO easy!  Even my 6-year-old loves them and she is the pickiest person on the planet.  I made the mistake of using a whole egg the first time but they actually turned out better, so I will do that from now on.  I might try the vanilla this time as some of the others have suggested also.  All in all a GREAT recipe that has gotten rave reviews at all the parties I have taken them to.  Thanks!

Ya know, I get these at a little store in the malls and LOVE them. Until now I have never found a recipe that comes out nearly as good as what I can buy. I was sceptical even though this recipe was rate 5 stars by more than 700 people. Well let me tell you...I tried it today and these are AT LEAST as good as what I buy, if not better! I was so pleased. Thanks for the awesome recipe. Now I know what everyone's getting for Christmas thins year!

This recipe was wonderful! I added vanilla extract to the egg/water mixture.  Also, instead of two cups of white sugar, I used 1 cup white and 1 cup packed brown sugar. I took others advice and placed the soaked pecans into a zip lock bag to coat them.  No mess to clean up. I like to use them in salads as well. I will definitely make these again.

I've made this recipe many times and it always comes out perfect!  I usually send these along with cookies and other goodies as a holiday gift to friends and neighbors.  Always a hit and everyone always asks me when I'm going to be baking the pecans.

This recipe is so simple and is amazingly delicious. I didn't have eggs, only egg beaters, so I used a little bit of that, and they still turned out delicious. I also added some nutmeg. I put the pecans on top of a fall salad and they were a HUGE hit!

These pecans are awesome!  I did take the advice of others and use half vanilla and half water.  I also increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  They were perfect!

I am a beginning cook, and wanted to bake some things as gifts for the holidays. This was hands down, one of the best, easiest recipes. I did take the advice of others and coated the pecans using a bag, very fast and efficient.  I also think I will use vanilla extract in place of water in my next batch.  Everyone loved it. It definitely helped build my confidence!

Hands down the best discovery I ever made on allrecipes. This has become my signature dish, you know the whole "Stephanie, are you bringing YOUR pecans for Thanksgiving?" Although they know it's not MY recipe, I refused to share my recipe with my internet illiterate family so they can't replace me! LOVE LOVE LOVE these! They go great in the big deep cookie tins you can buy around Christmas time.

These were fabulous!!! Took them to work for a daytime snack for us and they didn't last past 10. Everyone thought I had purchased them and asked for the recipe when I told them I made them myself. Thanks for the recipe.

Sorry I couldn't rate this as high as everyone else.  First of all, I didn't follow the recipe, but took the advice of other raters and used 1/2C white sugar & 1/2 C brown sugar. Also used 1T vanilla instead of the water and doubled cinnamon.  If I hadn't done this, I probably would have rated lower as the vanilla & cinnamon basically is what makes the recipe.  I was very disappointed with the appearance and the taste, even though good, was nothing special.

I used granulated style SPLENDA (not the little packets, the big box stuff) in place of the sugar and it worked fine. I also used the "ziplock baggie" tips as suggested by others.

My husband and all his friends LOVE these.  Especially when they're having a few beers.  Like others, I used two egg whites and vanilla in place of the water.  I also tripled the cinnamon and used a bit more salt.

These are completely addictive.  I love to keep them around (not that they last long...I eat them too quickly!!) for snacking and baking.  These are wonderful chopped up and mixed into a nice butter cookie dough.  
This Christmas I made a large batch ( as my uncle, a pecan farmer in Texas, sent me 10 lbs of pecans!) and gave out baggies of them as gifts.  Every single gift recipient wanted the recipe.

These were great to munch on during the holidays. I doubled the cinnamon but left all else the same. I tried with both Pecans and with almonds. Equally delicious with either one!

Awesome!  They look kinda funny, but taste so good!  DON'T FORGET TO GREASE THE SHEET!  I did...and I am currently freezing the foil I laid it on, with the pecans still on top, to see if it will somehow come off easier.

My 11 year old daughter made this terrific recipe substituting vanilla for water and doubling the cinnamon.  She used a ziploc for the sugar coating.  The nuts turned out so addicting and delicious!  She takes them to school for a snack every day.

This recipe was wonderful.  I love that it didn't need butter but still had rich butter taste.  I couldn't stop eating them and they were a HUGE hit at a party.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful, simple recipe.  Makes a great gift too.

Like others, I added vanilla to egg white wash and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  This recipe was a complete success!  But I do not recommend using baggies for coating w/ sugar.  I did and not realizing my bag was only partially closed, I had sugar flying all over the kitchen when I started shaking.  What a mess!  Had to do a 2nd batch and used a large salad bowl instead.  Had no trouble w/ this method and much neater!

Great snack!  I made as recipe states.  I made a second time and cut the sugar in half, it still tasted just as good, but maybe even better.  It was still so good that I'm going to cut the sugar down even more next time to find that breaking point where I can use the least amount of sugar possible without sacrificing too much flavor.  **Update!  I used 1 1/2 lb pecans, 1/2 c. baker's sugar.  That was a wonderful proportion!  Everyone loved it & they all got eaten up, plus I had multiple requests for the recipe!

Very good.  The best tip I can give is to not overcook these.  Stick to the low temp throughout the cooking time.  Very tasty.

I had a bag of pecans leftover from my holiday baking, so I thought I'd whip these up for New Year's Eve.  It was very easy!!!  I did use Spenda, plus I doubled up on the cinnamon as recommended by another reviewer.  The pecans have not even cooled down yet, and I can't keep my hands out of the bowl! :)

I have made this recipe to give out in gifts every Christmas, and every year I get people begging for the recipe. The next year, I have always gotten a batch from someone who I gave it to the Christmas before, never fails. A plus, if you make it for a party at your home, the house will smell great!

These are excellent and very easy.  I used the zip lock bag method others used and it works well.  Took them to a holiday gathering and people told me they were addictive.  Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

wow these are sooo good.  i actually hate nuts.  i try to avoid eating them whenever possible but these pecans are just soo delicious.  my dad doesnt like the taste of cinnamon nor for things to be too sweet so i omitted the cinnamon and only used 1.75 cups of sugar for 2lbs of pecans and i also used vanilla instead of water.  my family likes the pecans to be extra crunchy so i baked mine for an extra 10 minutes.

Huge hit! I followed others suggestions.

1/2 Tablespoon of vanilla and 1/2 cup brown, 1/2 cup white sugar. I also doubled cinnimon and used two egg whites. Also, use a large zip lock bag... just makes life easier!

Don't forget to stir every 15 min!

Unbelievable.  This recipe is SO easy.  I added more cinnamon.  I can't wait to try them once they crisp up (they're still warm out of the oven).  YUM!

Try substituting the low cholesterol egg substitute from a carton.  They are basically egg whites and work great!  I used 1/4 cup per pound of nuts and subtituted vanilla for the water. Be sure to double the cinnamon!

YUMMY!  I made these to put on a salad for Christmas dinner. I am going to have to make more before then, as I am eating them all right now!  Didn't change a thing-just shook them in a bag, and that worked perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe! I also substituted vanilla extract for water and use half white and half brown sugar.  The brown sugar adds extra flavor and a nice color. I've given these nuts to at least a dozen people, and everyone has loved them.  Thanks!

I loved this and I'm definitely picky!!  Using the ziplocs are a great idea - makes for even distribution and easy clean-up.  I will be making this again for cocktail parties.  Thanks for the recipe!

SO SIMPLE! And better than the ones that you get at the store. I suggest buying the pecans in bulk (cheaper) and freezing the ones you don't need they keep well and are always there when you get a craving!

Absolutely fabulous!  I added a bit of almond extract.  Next time I am going to try the vanilla extract!  Going to make this again and wrap up in paper cones for gift giving.  Thanks for the delicious recipe (~~)

So good!  We cant stop eating them.  Followed suggestions and used vanilla instead of water, doubled the cinammon, and used 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar.  Although next time I will try 1 cup white sugar.  Also used ziploc bags to coat and mix and placed tin foil on cookie sheet for easy cleanup.  They are delicious!  Easy to make too. Tomorrow Im going to try with almonds.

Like others, I substituted the vanilla for water, coated the pecans with egg white in a bowl, then transferred to a bag with the sugar mixture and shook it!  These are absolutely wonderful.  I just wish pecans were not so expensive... :)  Thanks!

This recipe is a MUST TRY! It is wonderful! I used Splenda for Baking instead of Sugar, doubled the cinnamon and used 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 water. So tasty! No one at my party knew they were made with Splenda and everyone was asking for more. Make sure you make a double batch because they will go fast!

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  I've been looking for a sugared nut recipe for Christmas that was good but simple enough to make with my young kids, too.  This fit the bill perfectly.  My family and I devoured the whole batch in a couple of days.  I plan on making more with my kids this afternoon and will try some vanilla as others have recommended.  Fantastic!

Very easy recipe!  The pecans came out great! The only change I made to the recipe was to add cayenne pepper to the sugar/cinnamon mix for a little kick.  I also followed another reviewer's advice and used 2 gallon ziplock bags to make sure all the pecans were evenly coated.  Great recipe! Will definitely make again!

I love it when I find something great to add to my family holiday goodies package.  This will be a hit for sure, even in Sweden.  I baked them for about 45 minutes rather than an hour.

So delicious.  I used both walnuts and pecans.  I also used 2 egg whites and a tsp. of vanilla.  These will be making the rounds in my annual Christmas boxes.

Completely addictive.  I followed the advice of others and used vanilla extract in place of the water.  I suspect you could use orange, lemon, etc. for variations in flavor.  We cannot keep our hands out of the bowl with this recipe.  I'm planning to make a bunch of batches to add to gift baskets for friends and neighbors this Xmas.  Bravo on a truly easy, terrific recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

These were really good.  I did make a few changes like others suggested.  I used half water half vanilla mix.  Also, instead of white sugar I used dark brown sugar.  I will make these many of times over using different spices and different nuts.

After someone wrote that even a Neanderthal could make this, I knew it was the recipe for me. So easy! Like so many recommended, I used 2 egg whites, vanilla, and ½ brown sugar. Took it to Thanksgiving today. I also threw in some dried cranberries to lessen the “dog food” look. Everyone thought it was delicious and I’ll definitely make this again. Thanks!

I make these holiday after holiday and get big time comments. I have passed the recipe to many people over the many times I have made these. I do not change a thing. I actually dump the whole pound into the egg/water mix, stir well, and dump the whole bowl into the sugar mix, and stir. It coats great and then I dump it all onto the sheet. As it cooks, it turns into a hard shell on the pecan. As one soldier said I sent it to this Thanksgiving.."these are the Bomb". Try them!!

Amazing recipe-- just made them for the family for Thanksgiving tomorrow, but I don't know if they will make it to then! I did the ziploc bag trick-- used 2 egg whites, 1 tablespoon vanilla in place of water, 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and upped the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Try these!

Unbelievable! I made them this evening to take to an early festivity tomorrow, and it was so easy! I doubled the recipe and substituted 1/2 the water for vanilla. I also doubled the cinnamon. I followed the advice of another and roasted the first 15 minutes at 375 and then the remaining 45 at 225...to die for and I don't even normally care for pecans!

Everything I love about pecan pie without the syrupy stickiness! I used these in a fruit and cheese tray along with some curry cashews. Perfect for holiday snack bowl, and pretty in a tray, too. Watch the time on these carefully. And let your nose be your guide for getting them perfectly toasty and yummy; they will have just started smelling lovely when it is time to take them out!

Yummy!!!!!I usually don't care for pecans but I always try anything I fix to make sure it is good enough to offer to other people...Yummy!!!!  I took advice from other reviewers and used vanilla instead of water, that is the only change I made.  My husband dived into them...I told him I was going to give them away for Christmas presents...he looked up as he pulled the tin toward him and said "not these!"

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I followed reviewers suggestions and doubled the cinnamon, added some all spice, and did 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar. My husband and I couldn't stop eating them, and when I took some to work, they were gone within a couple hours. My boss even asked for these for Christmas, haha. Thanks!

These are so good.  I did not believe the write that said they were addicting.  She was right and I was wrong.  They are very addicting.  I can't wait to try them on my asian chicken salad.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I did put half vanilla and half water for the amount of water used and 2 egg whites.

I made these for a women's club meeting.  They are crunchy and delicious!  Stirring every 15 minutes is the trick to insuring  they don't stick together.  They store well in a sealed container.  These would be great to send in care packages!

Love this recipe!  I have tried several versions--as written, doubling the coating amounts, using different nuts and/or adding a bit of vanilla.  The only version we didn't care for much is with vanilla, so I won't be adding that again.

I did these for christmas and I'm just getting around to putting a review.  It was very good and I wrapped them up and gave them as gifts for all of our friends and family.  Then I remade them for a party and I wish I made recipe cards up because everyone was asking for this excellent recipe.

My grandma has made these for years during the holidays.  We always eat them all, they are so good.  If I had known this recipe was so simple, I would have started making them long ago!  Now I don't have to wait until Thanksgiving anymore!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I make this every year at the holidays and everyone loves it.  I cannot seem to make enough batches to keep up with the demand.  Very easy recipe to pull together.  Just have to be around to stir every 15 minutes while baking.  A wonderful treat.

AWESOME!!! Everyone LOVED these. I used a butter flavored cooking spray on my baking sheet which gave the pecans a buttery flavor. The only adjustment I would make is to ADD MORE CINNAMON. But these still were delicious!

These pecans were better than any store bought sugar coated pecans I've had and they were so easy to make. I was munching on them as they were baking! I made them for Thanksgiving as a pre-dinner snack and half of the pound was gone before dinner! I'm going to make this again for Christmas using walnuts.

Instead of the same old mixed nuts at a party, I made these instead.  They were only a very few left.  These would also make great gifts for neighbors, co-workers and friends.

Wow! These are hard to resist! Delicious! I bumped up the cinnamon to 3/4 tsp.  I also put the egg mixture in a zip top bag and the cinnamon mixture too.  Easy to shake n bake.

Very good and very easy. I used walnuts because that's what I had on hand. Mine burned a bit, but probably because my oven was off. I brought these to work and they were a big hit. I will probably make them for Christmas this year and give them away as presents.

SO GOOD!!!!  I made these last night to give away for Christmas and couldn't stop eating it.  I was even picking at it while it was still in the oven!  I substituted the water for 1/2 TB vanilla and 1/2 TB water and increased the cinnamon to about 3/4 tsp.

Excellent - I have brought these nuts to 2 gatherings so far and they were a hit! I do add some extra cinnamon and line the baking sheet with foil for easy clean up. A keeper and new tradition, thank you for sharing it!

I served these for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! Some thought it was a little salty so I'll cut back on it next time.

Superb!! Made these for thanksgiving snack. Used the ziploc bags, and replaced water w/ vanilla like the other had suggested. I made one batch of sugared & one with splenda. Both turned out perfectly...However the Splenda does leave a funny aftertaste, though the diabetics present didnt mind at all & were happy that I thought of them too:)**Make sure you use foil sprayed lightly with non-stick spray** (makes stirring alot easier & nothing sitcks) I already have requests for Sugared Almonds & Walnuts for xmas!

These pecans were a huge hit.  I made a small batch initially to decorate a pumpkin cheesecake.  After tasting them I made another batch to serve.  Well, they were devoured in minutes.  I will definitely be making more to have on Thanksgiving.

Excellent!  Read the suggestions & changed cinnamon to cayenne, 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar, vanilla instead of water.  Put frothy egg white mixture in a ziploc, added nuts, squished around & then opened it up & added sugar mixture to same bag & squished again.  Dumped onto a no-stick foil.  I will make these as gifts!

This recipe was very easy to make and it's fantastic! I couldn't get pecan halves so I used pecan pieces from the bulk section of my grocery store. 

This was very easy and I think I'll try it with a variety of different nuts. Next time I might use peanuts or almonds. Definitely a keeper!

I actually made this recipe with almonds because I didn't have enough pecans.  My friends were eating them by the handfuls saying that they tasted like the nuts they sell at amusement parks. I used the rest to top a summer salad.  Delicious!!

Excellent.  I follow this recipe exactly and it always turns out great.  Also, it's great with walnuts and almonds as well.  Put them in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator and they last a long time.

These were very simply put, sublime.  I thought based on the reviews they would be tasty, but this recipe exceeded my expectations.  I used cream sherry instead of water with wonderful results, we could not stay out of them.  I originally made the pecans to chop them up and sprinkle over a frosted pound cake, but it was a race to get that done before my family ate them. Thank you.

This recipe lived up to its rave reviews!  As others suggested I substituted vanilla for the water and increased the cinnamon.  I also used gallon ziploc to coat pecans with sugar/cinnamon mixture.  To make turning really easy, use 2 pans (jellyroll) lined with Reynolds quick release foil and sprayed with Pam.  When ready to turn, invert empty one on top and flip over.  Worked like a charm!

Fantastic!  I made these for every holiday gathering and never had any to bring home.  I also added 1/4 tsp or so of cayenne pepper to the mix for some extra spice.

I altered this recipe just a bit, adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the egg whites, and beating them until they were soft peaks rather than just "frothy" like the recipe suggests. The adjustments worked great and the pecans were a hit with everyone who tried them.

I am not a pecan fan, but even I couldn't keep my mitts off these! I made them to get rid of some pecans that I had and took them to work - they were a huge hit. Everyone loved them and they didn't last half the day. And of course my house smelled absolutely wonderful while they cooked. Just make sure you stir them as often as the recipe says! Even at those intervals they tried to stick. Enjoy!

My Husband said he absolutely loves these and he wants me to keep making them throughout the upcoming holidays. My two year old can't keep his hands out of the jar and I kept eating them everytime I went to stir them while they were in the oven. VERY YUMMMMY!!! Thanks!!!

Oh WOW!!!  So amazing!  I did substitute 1 1/2 teas. vanilla for part of the water...and increased the cinnamon a little....I covered my cookie sheet with foil and sprayed it with cooking spray....no problems with sticking.  I will definitely be making these for Christmas gifts....if they last long enough in my house for me to give them away!!

Excellent recipe! I used these as a topping for a baby spinach salad with red onions,blue cheese,grilled chicken and a balsamic/olive oil dressing. The sweetness of the pecans combined with the tanginess of the cheese and dressing work perfectly!

This works great with pecans and cashews.  i had no trouble with them clumping- i did use a bag to do the coating, and doubled the cinnamon.  i also substituted vanilla for the water.

An elderly friend of mine from one of our past churches gave me this recipe years ago. I loved them, but lost the recipe in one of my many moves.  My friend is no longer living, so I thought it was lost forever.  Thanks Carolyn for sharing the recipe and for bringing back fond memories of a lovely friend.

I too used an extra egg white and substituted vanilla for the water.  I used walnuts since that's what I had and mine were done in way under an hour...more like 30 minutes.  Next time I would use a little more cinnamon since it's one of my favorites.  These were great sprinkled over warm brownies and ice cream.  Thanks Carolyn.
