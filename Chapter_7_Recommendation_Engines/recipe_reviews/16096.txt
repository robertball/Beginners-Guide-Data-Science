I had never heard of potato candy. This recipe came up when I was looking for a potato salad recipe and since it was close to christmas I decided to try it. I am glad I did.  It was so good. I have no idea why another reviewer said it wasn't good. Mine came out perfect. I followed the recipe for the dough exactly the way it is printed. It does liquify at first but by the end of adding all the sugar it is a nice dough. One suggestions would be to microwave or bake the potato instead of boiling them.  It keeps the potato drier so you don't have to add extra sugar. Also I started with 8 oz of chocolate and figured if I need more I could add it as I went, but that was enough for me.  I rolled them into balls and dunked the bottom half in chocolate. It was easier and less messy that way. Then I rolled them in crushed peanuts, mini chips, coconut, and crushed pepperment.  Then I set them white side down on wax paper. The toppings you can use is endless. We liked the peanuts the best. Also instead of using vanilla you could add any flavor of extract you like or some rum or brandy.  I will be making this again.

For years,we have been enjoying this candy but we call this candy "Fried Oysters".  My mother-in-law is getting up in years and decided that this Christmas she wouldn't be making her candy.  I questioned her about how to make it and then checked with "all recipes.com" to compare.   Its the same ingredients and is just as good if not better than what we've had for years.
I've made this twice this Christmas.  The second time I used my mixer to blend in the powdered sugar.  It saved time & energy. After it was mixed, I put in the frig for 2 hours.  Next, I used my small cookie scoop for even amounts and rolled into balls.  I put these back into the frig so they would firm up.  This made dipping much easier.  I used 1 1/2 lb. of dipping chocolate, 22 oz. Spanish peanuts (chopped fine in my food processor).  Makes approximately 5 1/2 dozen.  Note: Don't salt the water when boiling the potatoes or your candy will be too salty.

I am a professional chef, and I must say that I have not tasted anything as terrible as this candy. I have used other potato candy recipes in the past with great success.

another way to do it is to make the potato part of the candy into a big ball and roll it out flat. Then spread peanut butter over it and roll up.  Cut into slices that look like spirals.

My mom made this candy for us kids every holiday, and special occasions. It may sound terrible-potatoes and chocolate, but it is so good. Mom used to also put peanut butter in at times which is very very good, and often would leave off the coconut if she didn't have any. It was still yummy. As another member suggested, making in a log and then slicing is how mom made it, much less time consuming and that is how i do it.

An old boyfriend's mother use to make potato candy.  I loved it, she gave me the recipe years ago but had lost it.  This is almost identical.  Thanks.  Everyone at work loved it.

Well, I should have expected these would be sweet, and they were  :(  ... but not willing to waste any ingredients on this experiment, the girls and I added several different things to salvage into a very addictive confection. Here's the list... 1/2 cup more potato. At least 2/3 cup cocoa (the "dark" Hershey cocoa was phenomenal in this). 1 tsp. instant coffee granules, undissolved; and per another recipe, an extra 1/2 tsp. salt. Then we added flaked and chopped sweetened coconut to taste, right into the bowl. We did not dip, but immediately rolled in coconut or cocoa. The pioneers would not recognize this, but we liked it!  :)

An easier version I read about is to spread the mixture in a buttered foil lined 9-in. square pan with foil.   Cover and refrigerate overnight. Cut into 2-in. x 1-in. rectangles. Cover and freeze.  Then dip the frozen candy into the chocolate - sounds much easier to work with.  I'm looking forward to trying this candy.    In a microwave or double boiler, melt candy coating. Dip bars in coating; place on waxed paper to harden. Store in an airtight container.

I too have used BAKED potatoes, peeled and mashed. Is it possible that the author made a mistake by not being specific about the potatoes? The word "cooked" leaves room for various interpretations.

instead of putting the candy in a pan I cool it and then roll it into 1 inch balls they are so easy that my 6 year old granddaughter can help. I also get lots of request at Christmas time for this candy.

I have made potato candy plenty of times before and this has way too much potato to powdered sugar to roll out.  I thought maybe my judgement was wrong when I made it since this has so many great reviews but unfortunately I was right.

These are way too sweet, like eating a mouthful of dried up frosting dipped in chocolate, (and I love anything sweet)!  It was a fun recipe to try though, just not for us.

the ingredients used in this recipe are the same as i was a kid except when we rolled it out we put peanutbutter on the dough then rolled it up like a jelly roll and we did not dip it in choclate it is like having peanut fudge and less time to make              .
