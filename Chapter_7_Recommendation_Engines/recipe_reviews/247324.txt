We love this soup! The broth is super delicious and zesty. The recipe is pretty forgiving; if I don’t have all the added ingredients, I just use what I have in the pantry/fridge. I can’t speak the authenticity of the flavor, but it’s so fresh tasting. The garlic chili paste is a must for heat fanatics.

The broth was EXCELLENT! While I would have loved the optional bean sprouts, they are hard to come by in my area and I did not have them. While I think the flavor of this soup was the bomb, it was too thin in the end for me and needed more substance. I ended up adding noodles (HUGE bonus) and I think rice would work good too. I think it needs a starch but overall EXCELLENT!

Very good husband loved it. Switched out a minced jalapeño for the dried chili pepper.

A beautiful simple soup. Added some nori because I had it in the pantry and some sugar snap peas.

I like this recipe a lot! Next time I will reduce the lemon and increase the ginger. I didn’t have fish sauce, and it definitely needed that savory/umami flavor.

when it comes to soups I will try them all!  this soup is very tasty and hearty.  the flavor from the lemongrass, mint, and lemons/lime gives it a really great taste.  I use just a few egg noddles and a some heavy cream for thickening (but not too thick).  I use chicken thighs (pull the skin off) instead of precook chicken, shredded cabbage but no bean sprouts.  Sooooooooo good.  I will make it again.
