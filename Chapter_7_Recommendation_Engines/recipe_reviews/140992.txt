This was fantastic.  I made it for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day.  It was impressive and delicious.  We had some great Italian bread to soak up the wonderful sauce.  
Changes:  I did not soak the squid as I am lactose-intolerant.  I was going to hammer them to tenderize, but ended up without enough time, and it was not a problem at all.  The squid were delicious.  
It was a lot of food for us (I divided the recipe in 3 to serve 2 people).  We ended up eating it all anyway because it was so delicious, but probably ate too much.  I would probably use less sea bass next time.
The fish store told me it should be Chilean Sea Bass, which was super-pricey.  I did do that, but it was a tender rich fish and I could have used a different fish I think.
I would use less fish, then, but I would make more sauce, as the sauce was fantastic.

Make sure you have a very large pot. Oysters took very long time to open others opened faster. Great taste and impressive presentation.
