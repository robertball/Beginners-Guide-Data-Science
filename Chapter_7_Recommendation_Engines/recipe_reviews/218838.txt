Great dish and easy to make with my 10year old. We added mushrooms and substituted a 1/2 cup of spaghetti sauce for the chicken broth. Will definitely do this again! Perfect for the whole family!

This recipe was delicious, but I just realized we forgot to add the peas!!  I can't believe it.  It was yummy anyway, and I did make one big adjustment, we added some grape tomatoes, cut in half.  I just had them around, and ready to be cooked, so this was the perfect place to use them.  Hubby thought this was a little sausage heavy, and I agreed, until I realized we forgot the peas, I'm pretty sure that would have solved the problem.  I am just beyond thrilled with the Johnsonville recipes, they have been yummy, and this was not exception.

Just OK. I had high hopes for this recipe. I love both garlic and basil but this was really boring. My eight year old ate it but even she said "the sauce needed something". Maybe some Parmesan would kick it up a notch. I am annoyed that the cooking instructions aren't on the plastic wrapper. I made a half recipe using just one of the individually wrapped sausages but the instructions aren't on the plastic sleeve. If I freeze the second piece am I really supposed to save the cardboard label for the cooking instructions?

What I loved the most about this was the Campanelle Pasta I used.  :)The little horns filled up with the peas an sauce. 

As far as flavor goes, I didn't feel it had much flavor at all.  Next time I would try to do something else to enhance the flavor of the broth because the sausage just doesn't carry it.  I used the 3 cheese red pepper sausage for this particular recipe.  After tasting the sauce I added some shredded asiago to the sauce along with more pepper and salt, but it didn't do anything for it.  Grumpy's not here to give his opinion.  He'll probably come home, warm it up, and say it was good, I should make it again.  ;)  You  never know!  I think I just have a really developed palate and need more flavor in my food.

All in all it is a good base recipe, but I would probably only make it again if I had nothing else on hand to do quickly.

I absolutely loved this recipe... Didn't have Johnsonville Italian sausage, though, so used some other cheesy chicken sausage (might have been asiago) we had on hand. Sauteed it in a pan with a little bit of olive oil until it was a little crispy, since I like that flavor for my meat. Used fresh basil from our garden and may have added broccoli as well.
