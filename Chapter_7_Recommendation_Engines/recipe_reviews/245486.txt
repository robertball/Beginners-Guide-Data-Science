I smoked my ham instead of baking it so my review is based strictly on the glaze. It was excellent! I can tell by reading the instructions for the oven that it would be great this way too! Thanks for the simple and delicious recipe!

I cooked on the smoker for 3-4 hrs at 225 F.  The first 1-2 hrs uncovered in a foil pan with coke to provide moisture then basting with liquid from pan every 20-30 minutes.  The last 1-2 hrs cover with foil until internal temp of 140 F.
