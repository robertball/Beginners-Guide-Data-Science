I've made this salad twice. By the recipe exactly the first time, and with some modifications the second. Both are tasty! For some variation, eliminate the sugar, add 1/4 envelope of Ranch dressing mix, halve the peanuts and add 1/2c of celery instead. Yummy both ways. BTW, I used 1/2 of a very small red onion. Thanks Rebecca.

This recipe would also be great for the Christmas holiday season - with the green peas and the red cranberries and onions it is perfect and tasty as well.  You can make it with the peas frozen and let them thaw after salad is mixed.  I found the onion amount to be a bit too much so I would cut it down by half.  Enjoy!

I love this recipe!  It reminds me of a salad that the dining hall at my university used to make.  It had the same dressing, but used broccoli in place of peas and sunflower seeds in place of peanuts.  I think I may try those substitutions next time.  And I may cut down on the dressing.

I get asked for this recipe everytime I serve it.  The combinations (peas, cranberries & peanuts) are great!  VERY quick and easy.

This has become my favorite family reunion salad.  I discovered it a while back and have been taking it to my family get togethers.

I thought this salad was fantastic, and so did everyone at the BBQ I took it to. My only suggestion was to cut down on the amount of dressing, but that's just my preference. Superb!
