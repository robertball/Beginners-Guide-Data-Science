Great!  This salad is bright, crisp and fresh!  The dressing is tad tart.  To remedy this I recommend using the zest and juice of only 1/2 lemon and adding 2 Tbsp. honey to the dressing.  Some chopped walnuts rounded out the salad nicely.  This salad would go great with holiday dinners since pomegranates are in season then.

I made this last night for family and friends.  Everyone loved it.  I hate when people change the recipe, but it was REALLY tart, so I doubled everything but the lemon juice and zest when making the dressing.  A very different salad! It was time consuming getting the seeds out of the pomegranate, be careful not to squirt on good clothes....I think the juice stains.

I didn't make the salad, but I am rating the recipe for the dressing. I wanted a lemon vinaigrette to marinate some blanched, chilled asparagus. It was delicious! I don't know about the "too tart" that other reviewers mentioned, it didn't seem that way to me. I guess it could depend on the size of the lemon and the quality of the vinegar could vary too. I loved the fresh taste the lemon zest brought to the dressing.

I have been making this salad for many years and it is always a hit and the recipe is requested too many times to mention  BUT the only exception to my recipe is that I use 2 tablespoons of maple syrup,1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp of oregano same amount of dijon and olive oil. the feta is reduced to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup of toasted pine nuts.Try it you will like it alot!

This salad is DELICIOUS.  I used fresh spinach with chopped romaine lettuce instead of the packaged bag greens.  I also added a little more olive oil and salt to the vinagarette because it was a little too tart when I tasted it.  It also seemed to make an awful lot, so I didn't pour the entire amount on.  Pomegranates were out of season when I made this, so I used sliced fresh peaches instead, and it worked wonderfully.  The salad was a HUGE hit at my mom's birthday dinner, and everyone went back for second helpings!

After getting the pomegranate seeds out, the salad is super easy.  The amount of lemon (1/2 or full) really depends on how juicy yours are.  I had juicy lemons and used half a lemon and tested the taste and like it that way. If you have lemons that aren't very juicy 1 full one would probably be right.

This dressing is good but I did not care for it on this salad.  I think it would compliment the salad to have a sweeter dressing.   I will experiment with different dressings. I waited for others to voice their opinions and we all agreed with a sweet dressing this would be aces.

Good salad, great taste. Served it with BLTs for dinner but next time I might add grilled chicken to the top and serve it as the entree. I cut the amount of lemon to 1/2 and added 2 tsp of honey to the dressing as suggested and it wasn't too sweet or too tart - just right.

I found the vinegar overpowered this dressing, but just added more of the other ingredients until it was balanced out. 

I actually used this dressing in a pasta salad, and it was a hit with my family.  I marinated some beef in Lawry's Havana Garlic & Lime marinade, then added it to a pasta salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, pepper jack cheese, green peppers, and onions.  The marinade and this dressing complimented each other very well.

Rating:  4.5 stars. I prepared this salad for guests recently, using many of the suggestions from others.  I added chilled mandarin oranges and candied, toasted walnuts.  I enjoyed the addition of red onion, but served it on the side as not everyone eats raw onion.  I do not think the type of greens makes much difference; I used a combination of Romaine and spinach.  My husband declared it "One of the best salads I've ever eaten."  HOWEVER, the dressing needs work . . . as others have stated WAY TOO MUCH LEMON (serve as presented on Valentine's Day if you want your honey to really pucker up).  I had to play with mine for quite awhile, even using honey-mustard instead of Dijon and the balsalmic vinegar and adding LOTS of honey.  Sorry, I can't accurately recall proportions.  Eventually, I put all dressing in my blender, added MORE honey and some sugar.  It scared me so that I served the dressing on the side in a small pitcher instead of dressing fully on the salad.  Conclusion:  this salad is FANTASTIC IF you can get the dressing down. Once mine reached the "sweet-n-sour" kind of flavor it was excellent.  And, with the pomegranate seeds, oranges, deep greens . . . it's beautiful in its presentation.  Definitely a keeper . . . but I need to work on the dressing!  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty. I already had all these ingredients, save a few. I used spinach and romaine. I also kinda made the emphasis on dijon for the dressing, which came out pretty yummy. I also put avocado and fresh orange tomato. it was gooood

The dressing was good, but way too tart.  I like sour things, but I only put 1/3 of the lemon juice called for and it was as sour as I could ever imagine wanting.  The trick to dressing is to mix all ingredients other than the oil, then drizzle the oil in very slowly, whisking vigorously as it drizzles.  This keeps the dressing from separating.  The salad was good, but the pomegranate seeds fell to the bottom of the bowl and it was an effort to get some in each bite.  My DH and I didn't think they really added anything to the salad, so for the leftovers we left out the pomegranate and added mandarin oranges and sugar-coated pecans.  We both thought that went better with the feta and tart dressing.

This is a great salad. Made it for Christmas dinner this year and it was a very pretty festive salad. I only gave it a 4 because like other reviewers I felt the dressing would be to tart. I cut the red wine vinegar to 2 Tbsp and used 1/2 of a lemon juiced and the zest. A added 2 to 3 Tbsp of maple syrup as a sweetener. I also added 1/2 cup of candied pecans. It was a hit with my guests and a definite keeper for the future.

This is a delicious salad. My family loved it. The only negative was that the dressing was a bit too tart for us, so the next time I will reduce the amount of lemon juice used, probably 1/2 lemon would be enough. Otherwise, it is definitely worth 5 stars.

I love this recipe.   I'm always asked for the recipe for the dressing.  I go a little heavier on the mustard just for my own preference/taste.  Great combination of flavors with the dressing, feta, pomegranate.   Yum.

A easy salad to make, and very tasty. If you don't want to make the vinigrette, just use a store brand lite salad dressing.

YUMMM!!! My husbands comment was "This is the best salad on the planet!" I had just learned how to easily seperate the seeds/fruit from the pith of a pomegranate and so I had about 1 1/2 cups to do something with. Always before, I had just dug them out one at a time so had only eaten them like that. With a quantity ready to go, I decided to see what kind of recipe I could find to enjoy them. This looked and sounded so yummy, and we like feta. I was amazed to find that I was out of feta (that hasn't happened in years) so I used fresh parmesean. I'm sure it wasn't quite as good as it will be with feta, but it was wonderful! My husband usually only eats ranch dressing, but he loved this! Makes me wish pomegranates were available year around.

Made with leaf lettuce and an herbed feta.  It was tasty for such a simple salad.  The dressing was enjoyable as written.

Because of the number of reviews noting the tartness, I halved the lemon juice and used Meyer lemons, which are sweeter. Also used a good balsamic vinegar, because I prefer the taste. I love how the flavor bursts in your mouth, when you bite into the pomegranate seeds! Next time I'll add walnuts.

This is a pretty good salad.  I did add diced avocado to the mix and think that some red onion would be a great addition.  The dressing while tasty was a little thin.  I might either decrease the amount of lemon juice or increase the olive oil next time.  This was served topped with a chilled salmon fillet for a quick weeknight meal.

We made this today and must say it looks very pretty with all the colors.  The texture is interesting with the pomegranate.  The dressing was a little too tart for us.  I think next time I will not add the lemon.  It's bitey enough with the vinegar.

So the 2nd time I made it I changed it up a little and thought is was much better.  Added some baby spinach to the mixed greens, and used crumbled goat cheese instead of feta.  I also added just a pinch of Truvia to the dressing to take the edge off. Friends raved about it! Will make a again soon!

I have to agree with Dianne (10/36/2009) that the salad dressing was too tart.  So I added 2 T of honey and only 
1 1/2 T of fresh lemon juice and a little pom juice, as well, as I had more than a half of the pomegranate left. 
In addition, I added some apple to the salad along with chopped pecans to give it some crunch.  
May have been good without my additions...I just prefer a little more contrast of textures.

The vinigar in the dressing was a bit overpowering.  But it was still pretty good overall.

I have made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas and used tangerine juice in the dressing - either way it is a wonderful and festive salad!

Fantastic!  The only changes that I made was using rice wine vinegar, which lends it a sweeter taste.  I think that a blueberry vinegar would add a nice flavor to this, as well.  I also used an oil mister rather than measuring.  This finely coats the greens but uses less oil.

Amazon has a great selection of vinegars.

To HUMMEL97..just add some honey to the dressing recipe and that should give it some sweetness..but not too much.

This salad was very good, I didn't follow the directions for the dressing based on other reviews saying it was too tangy, so I used less vinegar and lemon and more mustard.

wonderful salad!!! I made this for a large family holiday gathering and there wasn't a leaf left over!!! great blend of fresh ingredients. I did adjust the dressing as I made it, tasted and added what I thought it needed to be a bit more balanced. Also added chopped candied walnuts for a little extra crunch!!! I will make this again and again!

I didn't like the dressing on this salad... It was way too tart!
