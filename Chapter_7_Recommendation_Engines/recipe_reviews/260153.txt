These were quite possibly the best GF brownies I’ve ever made, and my daughter is Celiac, so I’ve made a lot of brownies over the years, including many using teff flour. Thin crisp crust formed on the top, just like the picture. Crust broke a little as I cut them, but they still held together well. Very fudgy interior, but not gooey.
I made just a few minor tweaks to the recipe: instead of 1 extra TBL of teff, I used 1 TBL tapioca flour (I’ve tested this with other teff brownies recipes so I knew it helped the texture solidify). I also used only 6 TBL butter instead of the full stick with no detrimental effect to the final product. Will test with a future batch if I can get away with even less.
