Delicious! We had it warm with ice cream for dessert, and then enjoyed the leftovers as coffee cake the next morning. Next time I'll make it exactly as specified, but it was still great with modifications. I only had 1 c. strawberries, so used 2 c. rhubarb. I was also out of lemons, so I omitted the lemon juice; I think the fresh lemon juice would've brightened the flavor and made it even better. I was also in a rush, so melted the butter rather than creaming it with the sugar; that may have affected the texture somewhat, but the cake was still moist and light. Thanks for a great new recipe.
