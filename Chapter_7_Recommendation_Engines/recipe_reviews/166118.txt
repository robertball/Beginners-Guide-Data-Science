This is my recipe, but in the submission process got a bit changed around.  Probably partially my fault--I said it makes 8 fluid oz and I was wrong. (It makes more than that--more like the size for a tall glass.) Anyway, the way I make it is 1 cup beer to 3/4 cup lemon lime soda to 1 tspn grenadine.  I'm not a bartender--that's clear, since I don't know how to make it the way a bartender would--but that's how it turns out how I remember it.  Thanks!

I was recently in La Rochelle and I had a Biere Monaco mixed with Red Bull in place of the Limonade. Tres Bien
