These are easy, simple and tasty.  I actually baked them in the oven due to technical issues with our grill and they still turned out great.  The cheese and bacon really add something to the dish.  Make sure you spray your foil or all the cheese will stick and that is the best part.

These were good, but think they can be improved by adding garlic, using grated sharp cheddar, and real bacon.

We loved this and i decided to try and make this while reducing the amount of potatoes in order to cut some of the carbs.  So i decided to use half potatoes and half diced cabbage. Everything remained the same except i used real cheddar.  This was delicious and still very filling with the cabbage added in. Will make it this way again.

This was very yummy! As other reviewrs suggested I used cheddar cheese and only one stick of butter.

Made a modified version of this for a party and everyone loved it! I baked it in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes (taking the foil off the last 5 - 10 minutes to let the cheese brown a bit). I used red potatoes and left the skin on. I used cheddar cheese and layered a bit throughout the potatoes. I also used soy Bacon, Bacon from Tastefully Simple instead of those imitation bacon bits. Lastly, I skipped the margarine and I mixed a little skim milk and a can of cream of mushroom soup and poured it over the layers before adding the cheese and bacon bits. I felt this would make it a bit creamier and kind of gel everything together. I'm going to try the original grill version in the spring when we get the grill out again.

Okay, I made this super easy - used diced, frozen hash browns, pre-cooked bacon, and pre-grated co-jack cheese.  And it was still a 5 star recipe!  I cooked them in a cast iron pan on the grill, started them about 15 minutes before my steaks, and they all finished together.  Scrumptious!

These were good, but I wasn't completely thrilled with the American cheese flavor.  I think I would have liked it a bit more if there was another kind of cheese.  I will make again, but change up to suit our personal tastes.  Thanks for the post.

Awesome side dish for the Grill!!!  Spring-like temps had us grilling out yesterday and we needed a side dish for brats/burgers, salad and deviled eggs.  This was it.  Only things I did different--used 1/2 cup margarine and subbed shredded cheese for American slices.  Will be using this frequently from now on.....Yummy!  Thanks Jen, this is a wonderful, easy keeper.

This is a quick and super yummy addition to grilled chicken.  My kids LOVED them.  We added a little garlic powder and they were fab.

The first time I made this, the American cheese seperated into oil and orange goo.  I ended up throwing out the entire pan.  Since then, I have made the following changes: use a Reynold non-stick aluminim pan, grill the onions briefly before adding to the pan, use real bacon bits and use a 1/2 and 1.2 mix of sharp cheddar cheese and Colby Jack.  We now love this!

These were pretty good. I didn't use all of the butter. I just sprayed the inside of the foil really well with cooking spray. Depending on the thickness of the cut of the potatoes, that's going to impact the cooking time. The thinner the cut the less time. Overall a really good recipe.

Very, very, very good...just be sure to turn them once or twice while they are cooking.  I used the Reynolds foil bag for this.  Only serves 4 in our household.

This was wonderful!  We used precooked bacon (we'd cooked 2 lbs before we went camping) and cheddar cheese.  Also since we ended up making it at home (I got sick the day we were going to leave for camping so we left the next morning) my husband cooked it in a glass dish on the grill.  The potatoes were wonderfully crip and it was so yummy!  Scott even had an extra serving!
I can't wait to try this whil camping!
Thanks for posting it.

Very tasty potatoes.  My sister, who doesn't like onions loved these! I'd use a lower flame setting.  After 30 minutes they were a very dark brown.

This is a great recipe. One that you can alter to your taste. I personally like mine with lots of onion & garlic. What makes it even better is that the prep work is done before cooking-giving you more time to enjoy the day and less time slaving over the stove!

Too much margarine, too much onion, and again ... TOO MUCH MARGARINE.I even used half the margarine due to other reviews and it was too much.  One onion is plenty, used shredded cheddar also.  4 stars with changes ... 2 star greasy mess without changes.

Just tried this - substituted slices of garlic and real bacon bits - used processed cheese but would probably use another next time; everyone liked it. Easy to make.

Made this with steak for dinner tonight on the grill.  Only added one onion instead of 3.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Very good!  Will make again.

Thanks Jen, Heather_Banzhaf and Goodeats,

Cheryl and I loved our dinner of Gilbert's Potatoes, Grilled Parmesan Asparagus and Best Grilled Pork Chops. I added garlic and shredded cheddar to the potatoes.  I grilled the asparagus for only ten minutes.  The pork chops were in the fabulous marinade for four hours.  As one of your suggested, I brushed the marinade on the  pork chops while grilling.   A huge success for this beginner.  Keep smiling, Jack

I used 1 extra potato and cut the butter in half.  Used shredded cheddar cheese.  These were good... had to use 2 separate foil pouches as it was too much for 1.  Good with the changes.... it would have been way too much butter with 2 full sticks!  Only took about 35 minutes..... spray your foil well- they do stick!  I left the bacon bits off- don't like them but would like to try with some cooked crumbled bacon added with the cheese next time.

I used real bacon and butter in lieu of margarine and this dish is absolutely delicious. My husband is a potatoe man and he said that it is his new potatoe dish. A true winner at my house.

I baked them in the oven. I added roasted garlic, fresh chopped green pepper and fresh bacon chopped and slightly fried before baking.

Family loved this recipe.  The only tweak I did was use grated old cheddar cheese as we do not use the sliced cheese.  Will be making again trying a different cheese.  Thank you Jen for sharing this recipe.
