A nice way to use up an ubandance of romas this season. Used my food processor for the first step. Decided to cut back the sugar a tad and it was still a sweet sauce. After simmering I used my emersion blender for step three. Threw in some dried basil and oregano. I advise cutting back the sugar to taste. Enjoy!

I've tried this recipe in the past and my only complaint is that it is a little sweet. I'm going to try it again today and ex the sugar.

I saw that many reviewers cut back on the sugar, so I did as well and used brown sugar as that is what I grew up watching my mom use. I like more sauce on my pizza and felt it did not yield enough sauce for more than a couple pizzas. 
I think this is a good basic recipe and was happy to use Roma's out of the garden.
I did not run through the food processor a second time bc I thought the consistency was fine after simmering down.

My suggestion now is to hold off on garlic salt and sugar until the end, and then add it to taste.

I had extra tomatoes from my garden, so I decided to make this sauce.  However, I didn't want to make as much so I halved it.  Instead of garlic salt, I used fresh crushed garlic. I also omitted the sugar completely. I also added a sprinkle of dried oregano.  I had to let it simmer for almost 2 hrs before it had the right consistency.  Once it was done, I tasted it and it was amazing! Very flavorful.  I couldn't believe how good it tasted being made with so few ingredients.

This recipe is very very sweet. Too sweet for traditional pizza, but just right as a dipping sauce (for cheese breads, Italian breads, etc.). This sauce would work well for fruit based pizzas like pineapple or a sweet BBQ chicken pizza. The texture is wonderful. We found no need to blend the sauce a second time as it cooked into smoothness just fine.

I think the measurements for the Garlic Salt are incorrect... I made this to the recipe EXCEPT I used 1 tb Garlic Powder and 1 Tb Garlic Salt (I thought 2 tb. salt seemed like too much) and it was still extremely salty. Next time I will use 1 Tsp.  Garlic Salt and 1 tsp Garlic Powder.

I think this is very easy and a great recipe. I add a little touch of crushed red pepper and the sauce comes spicy! (that's how I like it) I just add in oregano and basil towards the end.....comes great and I get just enough for the pizzas I make! Leave the sugar for the end if you're not a "sweet sauce" person :)

I reduced the sugar some, and it still had a nice flavor. I also sprinkled some Italian seasoning to taste.

Modified based on reviews: Cut sugar to 1 tab. Replaced garlic salt with: 1 tsp salt and a pinch of black pepper. Added 1 tab Italian seasoning, 2 garlic cloves, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, and 1 pinch red pepper flakes. Leave other ingredients the same. Don’t forget to purée through blender once done for smooth sauce.

I wanted to make this as my new go-to pizza sauce but even after 2 hours of simmering it was way too watery.

I really like this recipe the sauce is a bit sweet but good. At first the sauce was really watery but I cooked it on low for about and hour and a half. There wasn’t much sauce as there was at first so I just doubled the recipe.

Wow, this sauce was amazing! I halved the recipe and used a clove of fresh garlic and half tbsp of sea salt instead of using garlic salt. I would also recommend (as other users have suggested) omitting the sugar or adding it to taste at the very end.

Had a large batch of tomatoes given to me by a neighbor, and we love pizza in my house, so gave this recipe a try....turned out great! Made no changes whatsoever - delicious. Froze leftovers for future use. Easy!

This recipe worked, but you do need to tweak it. I would suggest adding no sugar, because the sauce is naturally quite sweet. Also, I added a teaspoon of oregano and plenty of fresh basil to the sauce and that made it more flavorful.

I was so excited to make this fresh sauce. This is FAR TOO SALTY. Maybe it should have 2 teaspoons of garlic salt. I love garlic and put garlic salt in almost everything but this sauce was inedible. We threw away the pizza.

Added a few standard items such as oregano etc. Best version I have tried yet. Nothing like using fresh roma tomato's. Mother in law a was eating it by the spoonful.

Subbed Red Wine Vinegar for white and used a touch of brown sugar instead of white.  

Added a pinch of siracha powder for just a little heat. Also, beefsteak made for a thicker blend.

It was very sweet for a sauce, it was closer to a dip.  I cut out all of the sugar and only used 1/2 the salt the second time.
