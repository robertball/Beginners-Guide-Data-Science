I'm giving it four stars because it is too caloric and the recipe calls for too much mint. 1 tbsp or less is more than enough. Also, be careful with honey, as it can easily get too sweet (and horrible). Perhaps you can omit it altogether. Instead of lemon zest and sherry vinegar, I added 2 tbsp lemon juice at the end and it was just right. Also, instead of heavy cream I used no fat half&half and thickened it with flour--the texture and taste were still perfect.

This was really good.  I changed it up a bit for flavor preferences and dietary concerns.  I used whole wheat penne instead of spaghetti, added the juice of half a lemon with the chicken broth, and substituted the heavy cream with 1% buttermilk.  I needed to add a little cornstarch and water for the sauce to thicken - probably a result of using the buttermilk.  Small price to pay to save a whole lot of fat and calories.  Tasted great, thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I found it only okay. Nice, bright taste to it, but at the same time kind of bland. My roommate described it as "perfectly fine".

Sinfully delicious!  I used BLSL breasts, which I cooked whole then sliced before adding back into the sauce.  I love the different twist the mint brings to the sauce.  It is a perfect balance of flavors.  Unless we had a special occasion, I would use low fat evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream.  I think it would work, saving calories without sacrificing taste. Thank you, Cheelara!

I apologize to everyone, the nutritional information is incorrect. I will try and get it revised as soon as possible.

Really liked it and it was easy to covert to dairy-free by substituting almond milk for milk and adding 1 1/2 TB cornstarch for thickening.  Also, if using almond milk, you might want to omit the honey. My finicky 11-year old son gobbled it up.  It would also be good over rice, polenta or spaghetti squash.

A keeper, but my grandson didn't like the taste of thyme (for him the food is more on the no herbs added-side yet).
I added a few cut up carrots (precooked in micro wave) and frozen peas (just throw them in, when dish is done) to give it a little more color.
This dish reminds me of Huehnerfrikassee that my Mom used to make a lot, when we were growing up.
I also would use more dark meat next time, since chicken-breast is sometimes a little dry. I also might add a little bit of cubed ham, just to give it a twist. The possibilities are endless. Thanks!

Perfect! Made with fresh thyme and mint from our garden. Mom and our two teens ate until we couldn't eat any more. We'll try the basic recipe for the sauce with other things from the garden - spring onions, broccoli, peppers. Thanks for this versatile recipe!

This was delicious and unique! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I went a little heavy on the thyme and mint because I like strong flavors. It turned out great and I will make it again and often! Thanks!

The flavors where great. I thought the quantity of pasta to sauce was too much. Next time I will use 1/2 the quantity of pasta for the sauce amount.

This was so delicious! I love finding recipes that get me out in my garden to pick fresh herbs. This caught my eye because I actually have a big planter on my deck with thyme and another with mint. I never imagined that these two would complement each other so well. I had to substitute half and half for the heavy cream but I doubt it made much difference.  I garnished the dish with a bit of freshly grated parmesan...but it didn't really require it.  This recipe is perfect the way it is!

Delicious!  I followed some of the other reviewers' recommendations and substituted fat free half-and-half for the heavy cream.  I didn't need flour to thicken the sauce.  I also used chicken breast tenders instead of thighs, and whole wheat penne instead of spaghetti.  Will definitely make again.
