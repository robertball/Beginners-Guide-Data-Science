Nice recipe and great as an appetizer.  I added cut up shrimp to mine.  I steamed the calamari about 7-9 mins.  Steaming is a gentler way of cooking and it makes it harder to overcook, which you don't want to do.  Put some fresh bay leaves and the peel of 2 lemons in the water your steaming over.  Cover and cook for several minutes, stirring often.  Dress the calamari when it's still hot then chill so flavors meld.  Remove from fridge alittle before you eat it and re-toss in dressing.

This was excellent.  I only made a couple of changes.  I used 2 lbs of squid instead of 3.  I added about a quarter of a red onion, chopped finely and I also added a small portion of shredded napa cabbage.  I added the napa cabbage because that is what one of our local restaurants does with their calamari salad.  I would highly recommend this recipe!

I am not a big fan of squid but I thought this recipes was alright. However, my husband (a seafood fanatic) loves this recipe especially on top of a green salad.

This is a delicious salad. We took the advice of others and steamed the calamari. I think next time we make it, I may try to roast the calamari or grill it.

Great recipe! I stir fried the squid in a little olive oil for 30 seconds - very tender. Only change I made was I used kalamata olives and added a little finely chopped red onion. Put on a bed of lettuce and it was delicious.

Came out great.  I just add olive oil and vinegar which my husband said it needed.  Calamari can out tender by just doing the 3 minutes.

This recipe is awesome as suggested! If you like salsa-like taste, add more freshly squeezed lemon juice and fresh dill (I like to add dill to anything I put parsley in), and marinate completed salad in the fridge overnight. It will taste even better the next day!
