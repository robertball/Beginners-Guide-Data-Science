Excellent! I made no changes, as should be expected when one is reviewing a recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Made 2 ham & cheese calzones, 1 pepperoni calzone, and then a pepperoni pizza with the remaining dough. The crust by itself is delicious and the ham & cheese mixture worked extremely well. Takes a little while to make and is a tad messy but well worth the effort.

Delicious!  Used my own dough recipe but kept the rest the same.  Was a big hit with the household!

I loved it.  Mine turned out a little too browned.  Probably my fault.  I would experiment with step 6 to see if I could work out that minor detail.  Also, if you want a lot more flavor, don't leave out the sauce.  Personally, I would say that it's not optional.

I followed the recipe as written and found it bland. Also the texture of the ricotta seemed at odds with the rest of it. If I were to make it again, I would leave that out and double up on the mozzarella.

This was great.  I used the Wolfgang Puck dough recipe.  Will make again and again and vary the stuffing some.

I have eaten a lot of calzones.  I like to spread a coating of the marinara sauce on top of the calzone to soften the crust which makes cutting easier and the marinara sauce is tasty over the entire calzone.  I did change some of the ingredients to sausage, pepperoni, onions and mushrooms along with the different cheeses.

Personally, I found the dish pretty good. It was easy to make, and had a beautiful taste and texture. However, it needed a little bit of something else,  something to bring all ingredients together, because I felt that the ingredients weren't united. The guests I was cooking for found it to be delicious but admitted that the Calzone was very spicy, which I disagree with because I added a spicy sauce haha. Overall, it was a decent dish although It could be improved.
