These cookies turned out PERFECT! I didnt cook them for the full time though. I only cooked them for 7-8 minutes. That way they came out soft and delicious. And you can use this recipe for cookie cutters too. Just be sure to freeze the dough for about 20 minutes so it's easier to work with. I made Halloween cookies with this recipe. The shapes came out excellent. Would definitely make again!

My mom made the best sugar cookies, but she died a long time ago and I never got her recipe.  This one is fantastic.  Like my mom, I divided the dough in half, and rolled each half in waxed paper like a log.  I sprinkled each side with sugar, wrapped it and refridgerated overnight.  I just sliced it and baked the cookies, ending up with 4 1/2 dozen little slices of heaven.  I can't wait to share these and a few stories of my mom with my children. 
*Made these again the other night - divided the dough into 3 - kept one white, then kneaded food coloring into the other 2 pieces, one green and one red.  I patted them out, layered them, then rolled and chilled them.  They turned out beautiful, and tasted just as good.  A good alternative to suit whatever season you would like to color them for.

I made these cookies for a wedding shower and they went over wonderfully! I added a bit of red food coloring to the dough and rolled them in hot pink sugar crystals and they were very pretty! The only change I made to the recipe was that I baked them for about 9 minutes for a softer cookie, but 10-12 will be great for those who like them nice and crispy. Will definitely use this recipe many more times!

These cookies are so, so delicious. Also, they still come out extremely tasty if you reduce the butter and shortening by about 25%.

Being gluten-intolerant, I substituted the flour in this recipe for 2 cups of a wheat-free flour mixture that is comparable to regular all-purpose flour, and, being out of shortening, I instead substituted the 1/2 cup of shortening with another 1/2 cup of butter. These cookies turned out to be the best cookies I have ever tasted. They are great thin and slightly crisp, baked to a golden brown perfection! This recipe definitely deserves five stars!

I normally don't like sugar cookies, but my family loves them. And this is by far the best sugar cookie I have ever tasted!! I wouldn't use it for cut outs, but the cookie itself is great!

This is by far the best sugar cookie I have ever had! After making the dough, I split it up and added a little bit of cocoa powder to one batch; they tasted phenomonal!!!!! Both ways were sooo good that I don't think they will last long. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I was using this recipie for a science fair project. My question was"Can you tell the difference between Splenda and Sugar in a recipe?" so i made ths recipie using splenda in one betch and the other batch exactly the wy the recipie said to. The normal cookies were fabulouse and very one I got to try them loved them. the ones with suger were very bad, and only like three people liked them. My rating was based on th sugar cookie recipie and not the Splenda recipie.

These were really great. They were chewy on the inside, and had kind of a dusty bite on the outside. Sounds odd, but they were delicious. I will definitely make these again.

This was a great recipe! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon (because I add cinnamon to EVERYTHING sweet) and used a mixture of granulated white sugar and brown sugar when rolling the balls of dough. I also topped the cookies with my own glaze and sprinkles after they cooled. Thank you for the recipe!

This was just your delicious typical sugar cookie. I made a big change to this recipe, though. I didn't add ANY shortening, and I decreased the butter to around 1 1/2 sticks. The other measurements were kept the exact same and OMG this cookie was DELISH! I felt much better eating it knowing how much fat I decreased from it and the flavor did not LACK. I baked it for 11-12 minutes. Crunchy outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Will DEFINITELY be making these cookies again!

hi everyone this is a pretty good sugar cookie recipe especially if you are doing ones where you don't roll out. but i wanted to roll them out to make them look cute of course!:) so i put the dough in the freezer for a while probably like 30 minutes and then i used A TON of flour when i rolled it out because and first the dough was sticking everywhere and was just a HUGE mess when i tried to cut out the shapes, since flour isnt a huge expense i didnt mind very much well thats it bon apettit!

These cookies taste very good, but I definitely would not recommend them if you want to make cut-out shapes. They get very large upon baking and mine ended up looking mostly like blobs.

Great recipe! I needed it for cookie cutters, so following other reviews, I froze the dough in 4 batches for 20 minutes, rolled it out between parchment paper, then cut.  My pumpkins came out great! I cooked them for 10 min, I wanted a bit crispier since these would be later decorated. Great recipe.

We made these cookies for Santa this year! I was at work Christmas Eve so my husband and children (2 and 3 year old) help him whip it up. He is not the best at following directions and he said it was really easy to follow. I took a bite (since Santa is a great friend of mine he shared some) and couldn't believe how wonderful a cookie my husband whipped up! I'm sure it didn't hurt to have the help of my kids to make it that made it great! Will definitely keep this in my recipe book!

Followed the recipe and it was perfect. It made about 50 cookies. We baked them for 9 minutes and they didn't look done on the top, but were slightly golden on the bottom, so I went ahead and took them out of the oven and they were PERFECT. YUM. Crunchy on the outside and tender inside. Definitely a weird type of dough to work with though (and toughens after refrigerated overnight quite a lot)  I would not recommend this one for using cookie cutters, but you might be able to modify it for that if you're a more experienced baker than I!

These were delicious!  I used them to make candy-corn shaped cookies (made a triangle log in three colors, and cut them into slices).  I was very impressed by the flavor.  I may use more butter next time, instead of equal parts butter/crisco, because I think they could use just a little more buttery flavor.

So tasty and just what I was looking for!  I needed a no-roll, no-refrigerate recipe because I needed some cookies in a hurry, and this was PERFECT!  I followed the recipe and directions exactly and got the perfect cookies for the little ones to decorate.  I usually like soft chewy cookies, but I loved these and enjoyed the crisp!  Plus they were sturdy enough to stand up to being frosted by toddlers!

Great recipe. Needed modifying though. I did feel it needed another 1/4 cup-1/2 cup flour as it felt a bit grease to me... I also used white vanilla instead of brown to help feel batter white.  I also used 2 tsp vanilla instead of just 1 and I increased the baking powder by 1/2 tsp.

The result was a fluffy sugar cookie with a crisp outside. I rolled this in a log and then through multicolored sugar on outside of log, then sliced in about 1/3 inch slices and placed 1.5 inches apart on the sheet.  they did NOT spread out at 9 minutes cooking time and with extra flour added.

~THIS IS NOT A GOOD RECIPE FOR CUT OUTS~

Also, I reduced cooking time to 9 minutes and they were perfect but remained white. NO GREASING COOKIE SHEETS WAS NECESSARY, AS THE RECIPE IS PLENTY GREASY AND I JUST USED NON-STICK COOKIE SHEETS.

The flavor on this cookie was okay, but the texture was not. To dry and crumbly, not at all what a sugar cookie should be liek.

These are SO delicious and easy! I love that you don't have to refrigerated them if you are doing them as drop cookies.
I did make one change, and used all butter, not shortening. Turned out perfect. This is going to be my go to Sugar Cookie recipe from now on!

This recipe is fantastic! The taste and texture are wonderful as well. The only this that I changed is that I baked them for only 8 minutes and not the full 10 to 12.

Im not a bog sugar cookie person but, these were excellent. My daughter and I made up a this morning, they were easy, and delicious! I should have read others reviews who said to refridgerate the dough before trying to use cookies cutters although we made it work with a simple pumpkin shape. I sugared them before trying to move them with a spatula to the cookie sheet. That seemed to help keep them from falling apart in my hands. My daughter (AGE 4) just said"  Mom, your the best cookie maker in the world" I wish I could take credit it for that. LOL thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! Easy to make with my 7-year-old (she really did most of it, and I just supervised!). I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 1/4 tsp salt to the dry ingredients, because I can't imagine a cookie recipe without salt! These need to cool on the baking sheet for 5-7 minutes before trying to remove them to a cooling rack or else they'll break apart... learned that the hard way!

These cookies were awesome.  We made no changes to the recipe.  I tend to not keep a fully stocked pantry so it was great that it used ingredients that I actually had on hand and they were easy to make with the help of a couple of toddlers.  They were delicious, light golden and soft.  Will definetly make these again.

These are the best sugar cookies on the planet. I followed the recipe exactly. 10 minutes was the perfect bake time for a chewy cookie, but I use a fairly large cookie scoop, so the time might be less if you make smaller cookies. I love this recipe.I think this is the only recipe I've ever followed exactly and gotten perfect results from without changing a thing :) LOVE IT. My husband HATES all sugar cookies and when I made these he complained and said I should have made chocolate chip...until he tasted them, and then told me to make them all the time. They are THAT good. If I could give this recipe 100 stars, I would.

Very good and delicious! My parents loved them and so did my sisters :) They came out perfect for me; soft and just a little crumbly.

loved this recipe! Used butter flavored shortening and added another tsp of vanilla. Easy enough that my 7 & 5 yr old daughters mixed, rolled with sprinkles and flattened them. Cooked for 11 minutes and came out perfect! thanks for sharing

This recipe makes an absolutely scrumptious cookie.  I made a batch and dipped them in chocolate (1 T shortening, 1 cup chocolate chips melted in microwave) and covered in sprinkles.  They looked very festive and tasted out of this world.  The texture is wonderful and they have just the right amount of sweetness.  I decided not to try using cookie cutters as the reviews are very mixed about whether they work or not for that, but the traditional round cookie was perfect for dipping in chocolate.  I will definitely be making more of these and I highly recommend this recipe.

I love these. After last years sugar cookie disaster I was done! I decided to try again and I am glad I did. These are way better than the last. I baked them for 8 mins and used a melon baller to make them more uniform in shape. I will be making them again in a couple of weeks for my Christmas baskets.

I shouldn't be able to give this a five star rating, since I didn't follow the recipe exact.  But I wanted to share with the people out there who don't have butter on hand... using all lard/crisco still makes this cookie awesome!  This is a keeper either way.  Oh... AND DONT COOK AS LONG!  Take the cookies out when the tops look dry and have small cracks.  Do not wait until the cookie browns.  When they cool, they are chewier and so delicious!

I made these for my one-year old's Easter party and I thought they were delicious and super simple.  I added an 1/8th of a tsp. of salt.  I used the decorating idea from the flower garden cupcakes on this site and cut a marshmallow into five petals with a dollop of icing in each center.  They were absolutely adorable and I got tons of compliments when I brought them in.  No one was the wiser that I had forgotten to make anything until the morning that I had to deliver them;)  Way too fast, easy and delicious.

Delicious!  Everyone loves them.  My sister is a baker and they measure up to hers.  I usually prefer icing, but even I, with my super sweet tooth LOVE these, especially with tea. Didn't change a thing in the recipe, except a tiny bit more vanilla.

These taste good--not too sweet.  I wish they stayed puffy like when they come out of the oven, but sadly they ended up deflating and got wrinkled.  They still look and taste great though.

I've tried several sugar cookie recipes, and this one is the best I've tried to date.  It works just fine for cut-outs, as long as you cool it (I put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes, which was too much).

I didn't have shortening, so I used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" baking sticks instead.  Following another reviewer's advice, I only used 3/4 c total of butter.  Other than that, I followed it to the letter...and the results were AMAZING.  I took out the cookies after the 10 minutes and tried one, and it was good, but I really wanted them to be crispy (it was my fault because I did not make them thin enough), so I kept putting them in for another few minutes until they were as crispy & brown as I wanted.  I think I ended up baking them for around 15-18 minutes total.  My fiance loved them, and I had packed up a container of them for our neighbor, because he had done an unexpected favor for us... but I didn't end up seeing him that afternoon, and by the next day we decided we were keepin' them all for ourselves!  Sorry neighbor!  :)

I hate to disagree, but these just aren't my cup of tea. I much prefer the softer cookies, and I thought these were really hard. They taste good, but they're not as buttery or soft as I would prefer.

These are truly are the best cookies I have ever baked (or eaten). However, following the advice of the other reviewers, I only baked for nine minutes, and ended up with a cookies with a PERFECT texture. Will bake again. And Again. And again

These were terrible for cookie cutting. I read the reviews saying to put them in the fridge or freezer and I did, but they still got really sticky shortly after I took them out. I didn't like how the cookies tasted either. They tasted kind of odd.

I cannot imagine these being any better! Make sure you space them well, b/c they WILL need room to expand as they bake. Oh, and I made the balls a little bigger than 1" ... probably 1.5" ... and it took about 6 extra minutes for them to cook ... but, whatever, they are WONDERFUL!

These cookies were fantastic!!!!!!!!!! Out of the clear blue I had a craving for an old fashioned sugar cookie and I found this recipe.  It took no time to make the batter and bake - in less than 1/2 an hour my craving was satisfied.  These cookies were soft, chewy and just heavenly.  Since we have a few Cinnamon fans in this house, I think that next time I will roll them in a brown sugar cinnamon mix.  This recipe is a keeper that I will make again & again.  Thanks!

This makes an excellent tasting cookie! I followed another reviewers advice, and added lemon instead of vanilla and a hint of nutmeg, and the end result is sooo delicious!! While the taste of these cookies excelled my expectations, the consistency is not up to par for cut outs I am sad to report. They were no problem to roll out, it was the cookie was too delicate after being baked to be frosted. However, this recipe does not state it is suitable for cut outs so I am not going to count off for that, I was merely following the advice of other reviewers who have appeared to have luck with it. I will make these again but stick with rolling them in the ball and flattening with a glass as directions state vs. cut out shapes. Again, the flavor is outstanding!!

Me and my mum made these about a week back, except we added a pinch of salt and used colored sugar for the top. They came out nice and tasted great, and were gone that same day. I would reccomend taking them out a few minutes, though, because I love the softness of freshly baked cookies.

Wonderful cookies! I do not think they could be any better, or easier to make. I  made with my 2 kids, 3 and 4 years old. It was fun, easy, and the cookies were moist and delicious. A keeper for sure!

This "oldie" is definitely a keeper.  I teach preschool, and I've been looking for a good tasting, AND easy to work with sugar cookie recipe for years.  Thanks to the person who posted this, now I have one!  :)  The cookies turned out so well!  The dough wasn't sticky, so my kids could use it like playdoh.  It molded and shaped like a cut-out cookie dough should!!  Plus, they tasted great!!

Loved these cookies! My 5 yr old helped me, super easy. No time needed in fridge needed to make dough easier to work with. At the end we slowly added small amounts of the dry mix to the wet to ensure all the ingredients blended good. Next time will try cutouts, we used pink & white sugar together. Delish & will make these for Valentines

The only change I made was to chill the dough for 30 minutes. Otherwise, I advise you keep the recipe as is. It's the best sugar cookie recipe I've found. Period.

I would call this a butter cookie more so then a sugar cookie.

I have to agree with the other negative reviews. Not very sugary, but a strong butter flavor. If you like the taste of a mouthful of crunchy semi sweet butter then these are the cookies for you. 

Going into this recipe, I took note of the strong  buttery flavor others complained about. I added extra sugar when rolling them into balls and placing to bake. When pressing them with the bottom of a glass, i rubbed the glass with sugar between each press then went back to sprinkle extra sugar on before placing in the oven. I also added colored sprinkles while still warm for a nice look.

If i make these cookies again,  I would toss on finely chopped walnuts and cran-raisins into the dough.

AMAZING cookie recipe!  I made this for roll-out Christmas cookies and they turned out beautifully!  I made absolutely no changes to the recipe except I chilled the dough for about 3 hours to make it easy to roll.  The only thing I will change next time is to make a double batch.  This is our new family Christmas cookie recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I was looking for a sugar cookie that was not "fluffy" like the store bought rolls (gross) . This was PERFECT! I cooked them so they were a little more on the "done" side and they were AMAZING! Looked like they were right out of a boutique bakery!!! I was also worried about cutting shapes into them with my 4 year old, I did as other reviewers did and put the dough in the freezer for a bit before rolling little segments of dough out at a time (keeping the rest in the freezer / refreezing the scraps ) This was an amazing night of making cookies with the family ! ( they look and tatse amazing as well) I WILL use this again!

These cookies exceded my expectations! I'm not a big sugar cookie fan but I felt in the Chrismtas spirit.  I made these cookies to the original specifications except that half of the batch I rolled in sugar AND cocoa.  It gives it a nice kick. Though next time I might roll it in Hershey's instead of TollHouse pure cocoa. These would also be good with icing.  Great recipe!

Followed the directions exactly (these aren't cut-out cookies).  I put some sugar in a glass measuring cup to roll the dough balls around in to coat, more sugar in a wide/flat dish, and then dipped the bottom of the measuring cup in that so I could use it to flatten with.  Worked perfectly.  Really easy recipe, but I think the cookies are too small (made 46 1-in balls) which is the only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.  Will increase the size of the dough balls by half next time.  Taste is very good!

Very tasty for a sugar cookie. I topped with a little coconut buttercream and it was to die for. These would be great served with raspberry sauce and whipped cream. Super easy to work with, too!

While my reviews are usually positive, I was disappointed in these cookies, and surprised that there were so many good reviews. Every sugar cookie I've ever eaten has been cut with a cookie cutter and frosted, but that was impossible with this dough. I decided to hold off on writing a review until I tasted one - after all, if the taste was amazing, I could forgive the misnomer in the title. Honestly, the taste was average. It wasn't a bad cookie, but nothing thrilling.

Tastes alright as far as sugar cookies go. I'm not a big fan to begin with. The dough was easy to work with, especially if put in the freezer for about 15 min.

used margarine instead of butter and oil instead of shortening. i also added a couple of splashes of water. this made it a bit too wet to roll so i used a spoon to drop on the cookie sheet. baked for 12 minutes. they were a bit thin but very good. made about 3 dozen. as soon as they were done, they were gone, so went over well with hubby and 14 yr old son.

One word...YUMMY.  I made these exactly to the recipe and they are delicious! I put them in the fridge for a bit and they were then easy to roll and cut into shapes.  I also cooked for only 9 minutes.   I will use this recipe again for sure.

Excellent!  Yes, they're slightly futzy to roll out, but they're not that difficult.  I rolled mine to about 1/4 of an inch and baked them for about 8 minutes.  Wonderful flavor.  I might add a little lemon zest next time.

They were good, but looked like blobs after they baked. I suppose cutting the cookies after might help. Great taste, bad shape for the perfect "cookie cut" cookie.

This is not a recipe for cutouts.  I made the recipe as stated and let sit in the fridge 45 min. but it was still disastrous.  The shapes were unrecognizable.  Cookies tasted good, though.

These cookies were good. I made them for X-Mas in X-Mas shapes. They were a pain to make but worth it if you like the taste of sugar cookies. These are good dunking cookies.

Great traditional sugar cookie recipe!   I used to make sugar cookies and used the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe by JBS Box on this same website.  Since I used icing, I should have not used the "additional sugar" on the dough before baking.  Also, I didn't get 30 cookies out of this.  I got maybe a dozen since I was using Christmas cookie cutters.  So, if you're using cookie cutters I'd recommend doubling the recipe.

The most amazing sugar cookies I've had! I normally prefer softer cookies, but the slightly more crispness of this cookie made for wonderful variety. So tasty!

To use for cut outs, I found it helpful to increase the flour to 2 1/2 cups from 2 1/4. I divided the dough in 2 parts and froze for 30 minutes. I found that I needed to freeze the dough again before re-rolling it.

I think this is one of the best sugar cookie recipes I've ever tried.  I doubled the recipe and followed it pretty closely.  I followed what one reviewer suggested, which was rolling into logs and then rolling in colored sugar sprinkles.  I wrapped them in saran wrap and left in the fridge until I could get to them.  It was SO EASY to slice and bake, and they are so delicate!  I baked them for 10 minutes, and they came out light, flaky, and they just melt in your mouth.  No icing required - perfect without1  Thank you for such a great recipe.

I really enjoy this recipe (I'm tasting as I write!).  The dough was easy to work with.  We rolled it to use as cut out cookies.  The cookies have just the right amount of sweetness.  My kids, who are ages 8 and 5 followed the recipe and found it "just right" for them to understand as well.  Thank you for sharing this!

Why oh why did I makes these??? I'm now on my third one, will probably go on to my fourth and fifth of the twelve I made.  Very easy recipe, almost foolproof, results are worth the small investment of time and ingredients.  I doubled the vanilla, maybe next time I won't (although vanilla lovers will think the recipe's just right the way I made these!). If you need a sugar fix, you can't go wrong with these! will wake my husband up in a little while and see if he likes them!!!

I was looking for a crisp, crumbly sugar cookie.  I'm not sure if this it, but they are delicious!  We haven't been able to wait until the cookies are fully cooled - maybe they'll crisp up later.  If they don't, we still adore this buttery, sugary recipe.

Excellent for CUT-OUTS! Some folks on here are saying they are not good for cut outs. We put the dough in the freezer for about 2o-30 min to stiffen. Rolled out the dough and cut wonderful shapes. Also used all butter instead of shortning. The shapes held beautifully and the dough was easy to handle (if chilled first).

Wow! I don't even like sugar cookies, but these were great! I followed the recipe almost exactly (I forgot to cream the shortening with the butter and sugar, but I mixed it in right after, and I also added more vanilla) and they turned out very soft and tasty! Two points: 1) The dough is very moist and sticky, so be sure to flour your hands and tools well between each cookie, and/or refrigerate dough for a while before; 2) They puff up while baking, but turn out about the same thickness as they're pressed to, so press them about as tall as you want them to end up (they do widen, though). Thanks for a very enjoyable dessert!

The taste was fine, but agree with those who said this was not for cookie cutters...maybe it works if you refridgerate or freeze them overnight, but even with that, they cook and puff up slightly, so they lose their shape.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I swore I'd NEVER stray from my usual cream cheese sugar cookie recipe, but I wanted cookies and had no cream cheese... so I whipped these up.  DELIGHTFUL! I didn't change a single thing. I made cutouts and they held their shape perfectly. I think this has to be the best sugar cookie recipe out there. Thank you so much!

Very easy to make!  Contrary to fellow reviewers, I thought these worked very well for rolled cookies.  I actually made the dough a day ahead of time and refrigerated it until I was ready to use it.  As long as it was cold, it worked well!  My 3-year-old and his friend loved making heart-shaped cookies for Valentine's Day!

These were okay, nothing earth-shatteringly good.  I followed the recipe & directions exactly (except for using all butter and no shortening, and I follows another review's advice about reducing the baking time).  The cookies were too puffy for my liking. I don't think I'll bother to make them again- thanks anyway. EDIT: The cookies stayed soft and chewy while cooling (too puffy & not flat, even though I pressed them down), and after a few hours in an air-tight container, they are hard as a rock. :(

Very, very good.  Refrigerated dough and rolled out for cut-out shapes.  Tasted just like Nestle's refrigerated dough sugar cookies.

These cookies are amazing! I read all the reviews before I made them, but decided not to alter the recipe. I made them EXACTLY to the letter as the recipe says. And guess what? They came out PERFECTLY! I made sure the butter I used was soft (20 seconds in the microwave) and lined the cookie sheets with wax paper. Im a college student who is home for the holidays and my mother told me to bake some sugar cookies so that she can frost them. These are SO good, I will NOT LET her frost them! They melt in your mouth and are a perfect consistency - soft in the middle, a little crispy on the outsides. DONT ALTER THIS RECIPE! ITS PERFECT!

My four year old daughter and I were looking for a sugar cookie recipe to make for the holidays - THIS IS IT! We just got done baking them, and they turned out perfect. I read the reviews before making and decided to stick with the round circles, instead of trying to make them into shapes. We made half of the cookies rolled in white sugar and then frosted them later and the other half instead of the white sugar, we rolled them into red or green crystal sugar. Again, this recipe is perfect and so easy!

This is by far the BEST sugar cookie I have ever had!  The dough is beautiful, silky, soft, pliable, not too dry, not too sticky, just perfect! And the taste is absolutely divine!  The only thing I did different was I put 1/2 tsp almond and 1/2 tsp vanilla, only because I love almond extract.  Simply marvelous, you must make these!!!!!!!!!!

I thought this recipe made perfect sugar cookies.  I made them just as the recipe suggested and they were the best cookies I've had in a long time.  They just had a great taste with the perfect texture.  I've made them several times since then, icing them with orange or lemon icing made from powdered sugar mixed with lemon or orange juice.

Terrible!  Very bland flavor and even underbaking them produces a very dry, sandy cookie.

I was looking for a sugar cookie recipe that was sweet but not too sweet. All I can say is WOW! These cookies are delicious. I did however, add some cinnamon to the additional sugar used to roll the cookies before placing them on the cookie sheet. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and baked for only 7 to 8 minutes for a softer cookie. This is my new sugar cookie recipe!!

I made these and they were a little on the bland side. I don't think I would make these again but if I do, I will definitely add some cinnamon or  frosting to liven up the flavor a little bit

This receipe is a keeper. I will, although, suggest a couple of things. Spray PAM lightly onto your cookie sheets & wipe off excess with a paper towel. Do NOT flatten with a glass and bake longer than 10-12 mns. I baked mine for 15 mns, but am using an elecric oven.  I also used White Lily flour.. and the texture is ooo so wonderful, these melt in your mouth!

Not bad. Baked them for 8-9 minutes so they are a little softer and used whole wheat white all-purpose flour.  We also didn't coat them with a ton of sugar so they aren't overly sweet.  My 3 year old loves them and I don't feel bad letting her have two or three.

These cookies were PHENOMENAL!  I really think that usually sugar cookies are too sweet, but these were perfect.  I didn't roll all of them in sugar and these plain ones were fun to frost.  Great recipe!!!

WONDERFUL!!!  I didn't change a thing!  My step-grandmother used to make the best sugar cookies but she would never share the recipe.  These taste just like them!!!!!!  I did half plain and half with sprinkles on top.  I will definitely be doing these for christmas presents next year!

Really like these sugar cookies.  They are soft and taste great.  I'm replacing the sugar cookie recipe I've used for the last several years with this one.

In a word "AWFUL".  Will not use this recipe again.  Not only was the dough a pain to work with for cut-outs (I chilled overnight and it was still very sticky to roll out - then when you put enough flour on to make it roll easier it became a crumbly mess).  To top it all off, the flavor is totally bland - tastes more like a cracker then a sugar cookie.

These are amazing.  My only problem was the dough was very dry .. but the cookies came out fine so I guess it doesn't matter.  And I got everything to work just fine with cookie cutters and what not.  Thanks so much.  I'll be making these for Christmas

These cookies are delicious!! Best sugar cookies I've ever had! Only thing is, the dough is very sticky and hard to handle. Did not work when we try to use cutters, no matter how much flour was laid out. Didn't try th 20 min freeze as others suggested, might try that next time.

I made two batches; one to make as traditional sugar cookies, and one to use with cookie cutters. I followed some reviewers suggestions and cut cook time to 7 minutes, which wasn't long enough for my taste - another batch in for 10 was better. For the ones I rolled out, I put the dough in the freezer for 20-30 minutes. With a lot of flour, I was able to roll it out and successfully used our Williams-Sonoma Star Wars cookie cutters for the first time. Definitely going to keep this recipe handy for an upcoming cookie swap.

This recipe had a VERY strong taste of Baking Soda. I'm not really sure how other people got this recipe to turn out well, but I have been baking since I could walk, and these cookies were shameful.

These were really good when they were finished. However, getting them ready the make shapes with was really difficult. The dough was really crumbly, even after I froze it. I had to constantly repack the dough in order to get a decent shape.

This recipe tasted fantastic. Not too sweet, but sweet enough. They were easy to roll out. and baked up perfectly without a lot of expansion, Keeping the shapes we cut them into. I was out of baking soda so used 2 tsp of baking powder and they came out just fine. Thanks for a great recipe.

So simple to make and so very delicious!!  They're a very light and soft cookie - I could eat them all!!
One thing to note, if someone doesn't like shortening, they may notice a hint of it in the recipe.

Great cookies!!  Made these with the kids today and they turned out soft and tasty.  Got a little worried when we started making them into balls because they were soo sticky, but became easier with the sugar on them.  Great GREAT recipe!!  P.S.  We forgot to smash the second batch and they still came ut wonderful.

This was great, my search for the perfect sugar cookie is over! The only thing is that you have to freeze the dought for about 20-30 minutes, also If you want these to be soft you have to bake the 8-10 minutes. They tured out PERFECTLY AWESOME!!!!!!!

These were good, especially right out of the oven. But the next day, they were hard as rocks. The next time I might try cooking them a shorter amount of time so they stay more doughy.

Waste of ingredients. They all burned. I did the minimum time of 10 minutes at 350 and they got dark brown and burned. I don't get it.

Very easy to make! I just found out my son is allergic to chocolate so I thought I would try sugar cookies for him and he loves them. He is allergic to eggs as well so I just replaced the egg with 1 tsp dry active yeast to 1/4 cup warm water and the cookies turned out wonderful. Thank you for sharing.

I made these as instructed.  They turned out very light and tasty even without frosting (I'm not a fan of frosting).  They were okay to work with using cookie cutters, although this was my first attempt at sugar cookies so I'm not sure if other dough is easier to work with.  The cookies were really crispy, though, and I think I'd prefer a softer, creamier cookie.

I made these cookies for Christmas and they were delicious.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use only butter, no shortening.  I rolled out the dough on a silicone pastry mat, and didn't have to add any extra flour.  I haven't had any problems rolling out cookie or pastry dough since I purchased this mat several months ago.

good recipe! Not too crispy. I did add a bit more vanilla.  If you want to make cutouts, just refridgerate for about an hour first. Then roll on floured surface.

I had really high hopes with this recipe and it bombed...for me.  It could have been that I doubled the recipe...or that I only had margarine available and not butter...they turned out almost flat (without greasing the pan, I use stoneware) and were dry and brittle.  I had put the mixture in the freezer prior to rolling them into balls but the mix just seemed to stick to my hands.

These are the easiest sugar cookies I have ever made. We rolled some in balls and coated them with colored sugar and the rest we rolled out and used cookie cutters. They taste great and look great to. Fun fun fun.

I haven't frosted mine yet, but they tasted fabulous!  One thing the recipe didn't advise (this is if you want to do cookie cutter type sugar cookies), is to refrigerate or freeze your dough for a bit.  I left mine in the freezer for about an hour, and that helped a lot with rolling out the dough.  I took other peoples advice and only cooked it for 8-9 minutes, and they turn out soft that way.  Great cookies!  I will make these again for sure.

I made these cookies a couple of months ago and decided to do them again with Christmas cookie cutters. They turned out brilliant! Such great melt-in-your-mouth texture and buttery flavour (I used 1 cup butter instead of 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening). I'll be making these any time I need sugar cookies!

I HATE when people alter the recipe and then write a negative review.  I guess this isn't too different, but I ran out of vanilla yesterday and forgot, so I used almond extract instead (half the amount as vanilla called for).    These cookies are HEAVENLY.  I can't WAIT to make them with vanilla for a taste of the correct version.  They are soft, buttery, sugary pieces of delight.  Cannot recommend these high enough.

Really great cookies..came out light and fluffy, not overly sweet. I would either use salted butter next time or add 1/4 teaspoon salt just to enhance the flavor a bit. These would be delicious with a bit of lemon zest as well. I will be making these for Christmas and will frost with cream cheese frosting. Thanks for sharing such an easy recipe!

First, let me say, this is NOT a COOKIE CUTTER recipe. I didn't read enough reviews to find that out before hand. Secondly, this is the BEST sugar cookies I have ever had! The dough came out with a texture similar to whipped cream. I didn't know if they would even make it to the oven. I had to bake longer than 9 minutes, but kept watch over them until the bottom edges just started to get very lightly golden. There was no need to roll them into balls; they turned out pretty well rounded. I tried to form them with a spoon a little bit anyway. Eating them now as they are cooled, they are still very soft, which is important to me. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! It feels like a gift! :)

Yum! My 5 and 2 year old daughters helped with this recipe, it's so easy and quick! We used "I can't believe it's not butter" sticks for cooking and baking (something I have never used) and King Arthur flour. Not sure if it was the butter substitute or the flour, or simply the awesome recipe, but MAN!! These cookies ROCK! I have to make 40 for a Kindergarten class party, and we are having trouble making so many since we keep eating these as soon as they are cooled. Good thing the hubby is at work today ;) Thanks for the "keeper" sugar cookie recipe, Helen.

i had to come up with a recipe that only needed one egg (thats all i had) so i picked this one.  I was so surprised by how good it was, since it was so simple.  I used margarine instead of butter but it turned out great. It had the taste and consistancy of those slice and bake sugar cookies.  I loved it.

Honestly, the picture to this caught my eye. I followed the directions EXACTLY, and wow.  They're great!  I didn't use any cokie cutter with them. But after i rolled them is white sugar, i made some colored sugar and spead it onto the cookies after flattening with a glass.  DELICIOUS COOKIES!!  As long as you follow the recipe.

Came out perfectly. I just used 1 stick of margarine and 1 butter since I didn't have any Crisco on hand. I only separated them by an inch, and they spread together, so next time I'll use more cookie sheets to give them plenty of room. Very good recipe! (:

Really easy and tasty recipe.  I ran out of sugar so I added 1/4 c of dark brown sugar to the recipe and used some regular sugar with light brown sugar to roll it in.  Had great results!

Turned out perfect! This is my standby sugar cookie recipe now. It's very versatile - leave it in the oven a few extra minutes until it gets golden brown for crispy cookies, or take them out when they're just barely golden at the bottom for chewier cookies. They taste great by themselves or with icing! I've made them with butter flavored and unflavored shortening, and they were good either way. Those who prefer a stronger butter flavor may want to opt for the butter flavored shortening. Haven't tried rolling out the dough for cut cookies, so I can't attest to how well it works with that - but made according to the recipe, are wonderful. :)

This was a great recipe for sugar cookies. They were crisp on the edges and moist on the inside. My daughters and I did use them as cut-outs, which worked well as long as you refrigerate first (for about an hour). We will definitely make again!!!

These cookies are melt in your mouth tender and full of wonderful flavor. It has become my favorite sugar cookie recipe. The cookies spread about double, so don't put them too close together. I baked mine for 10 minutes, just until brown around the edges. If using cutters, you definitely would have to refrigerate it first since it is a very soft dough.  This is a must try recipe!

This recipe was AMAZING! I'm 15, and currently a sophmore in high school. Friday, in my geometry class, we celebrated Pi Day and got to bring in round foods. I found this recipe, and whipped them up the night before. I also added M&M's and only cooked them for nine minutes. They came out soft and when I got to third period, they were still soft. I love this recipe and will be using it time and time again. Thank you. =)  By the way, I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!! =)=)=)=)=)

I did not like these cookies. They had an odd flavor to them. I substitued butter for shortening, so maybe that's why. They practically fell apart when handled. Not an ideal cookie.

Honestly, I really wouldnt say there was anything special about the taste of this recipe.  Tastes like a sugar cookie, but what I did love about this recipe is that they are one of the most perfect cookies for rolling out and cutting.  After the initial mixing of ingredients, i put the dough into the fridge for an hour or so and it basically rolled out perfectly! Not too sticky or too dry.

Thank you for this recipe! These are simply delicious! Very light cookie, melt-in-your-mouth. Not chewy, not hard (which is a problem with many sugar cookies). This recipe is very fast to make, and the fact that you don't need to roll the dough is a BIG times saver. Consider doubling the batch for a large family or party. I have to say, this is one of THE best sugar cookie recipes I've run across in a long, long time.

Here's what you do...Bake these cookies. Take them to work. Bask in the praise and compliments. Seriously though, I made a double batch (about 50 cookies), and the only thing I changed besides the proportions was how long I kept them in the oven (only 7-8 minutes instead of 10). Everyone at work loved them! They were gone shortly after lunch. I will definitely make these sugar cookies again.

The cookies tasted yummy. However, the dough was very crumbly and dry, as other reviewers noted...not a good cookie for rolling and making shapes.

Great recipe! The cookies were great consistency, chewy on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside! I rolled into 1 inch balls, and then using a flour dusted glass bottom I flattened them and used my cookie cutters fo different shapes! When they were done I mixed a little icing sugar with water and food coloring, painted the cookies with it and added sprinkles! They looked so festive I think I will make them for the fmaily on Christmas! Thanks a bunch!

High Elevation-  I had to add about a cup of flour to them (so we could roll them and use cookie cutters) and also I had to cook them for about 15 min.  
They came out great, the dough was difficult to work with, but well worth the effort.

This is the BEST sugar cookie I've ever had or made. I eliminated the extra sugar to roll the balls in. Instead we sprinkled Christmas colored sugar and sprinkles on top before baking. Delicious!!!!

These are really, really good. We just made Halloween cut-outs with the dough and they turned out perfectly. Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Held the shape of the cookie cutter better than any other recipe I have tried. Thank you so much!

I tried using this recipe twice and it needed milk to be added both times.  I suggest adding about 1/2 Cup milk.

We loved these cookies! They are easy to make and a nice texture. We used all butter instead of shortening. Baked for 9 minutes and frosted them with butter cream frosting. Yum!

OMG.  I love these cookies.  I've tried other sugar cookie recipes and they turned out more like tea cakes than cookies.  These are awesome.  I substituted Splenda for sugar and took a couple of dozen to a family function.  Everyone loved them, even the hard-line "I'll never eat anything sugar free" folks were wanting more.

Wow! I don't even like sugar cookies, but these were great! I followed the recipe almost exactly (I forgot to cream the shortening with the butter and sugar, but I mixed it in right after, and I also added more vanilla) and they turned out very soft and tasty! Two points: 1) The dough is very moist and sticky, so be sure to flour your hands and tools well between each cookie, and/or refrigerate dough for a while before; 2) They puff up while baking, but turn out about the same thickness as they're pressed to, so press them about as tall as you want them to end up (they do widen, though). Thanks for a very enjoyable dessert!

I was so looking forward to baking and decorating cookies with my daughter and although I followed the directions to a T, these cookies were one huge fat fail.  I wish I had made this ahead of time so I don't show up at a Christmas party empty handed.  So disappointed.

I used only butter and made a half batch.  Best cookie i have ever made.  Cooked 9 minutes first batch and 10 minutes the second batch.  Both, while slightly different, were excellent.

was looking for a quick, simple sugar cookie that did not need to be rolled out thinly as my current family recipe does and.......this recipe filled the bill. i use all butter in my family recipe, have to chill, roll very thinly, and decorate .
 
with this cookie, i followed the recipe exactly,used a cookie scoop to make the dough balls that i  rolled in my hands to warm the batter and to make the cookie ball smoother, rolled in sanding sugar (better texture and taste ), used a glass to press cookie thinly,  and baked. what i got was a crisp cookie that tasted very good and satisfied everyone.
 
worth the small amount of time it takes to make!

These were AWESOME.  I'm allergic to dairy so I substituted the butter with a dairy-free margarine and I did 9 minutes.  They came out perfect - soft but not too soft.  I also did as some previous reviewers did and did some with cocoa powder and froze some of the dough to make cut outs.  Oh - and I didn't press them with a cup (not on purpose, I just didn't read the directions completely), I just left them rolled into a ball and they made a smaller, thicker cookie that was amazing.

great recipe. Wonderful flavor (I did add 1/2 tsp almond extract also, though)  My grandson has allergy to eggs, so substituted 1 pkg knox gelatin dissolved in 1 TBLS cold water, then add 1 TBL boiling water and stir til frothy.  Add immediately to the butter(earth balance because of milk allergy also),shortening,sugar and extract mixture, then add dry ingredients.
Don't overchill or it gets very dry. 20 minutes would be fine.

This is a GREAT recipe!!!  The cookies are delicious!  I used margarine instead of butter, but the cookies still came out having that buttery taste.  The cookies were soft on the inside, but nice on the outside - someone had said they had a "dusty" outside, and that's a great way to describe it.  
I was very worried about over-baking them, but they came out perfect.  I think they were in the oven for 10 minutes or so.  Before baking, I flattened the cookies with a glass like the directions instructed, and that made them all uniform which was nice.
Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!!!

I love this recipe. The mix is very sticky so I put the dough in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes prior to dealing with it... I sprinkled some sugar in the bowl to help with the stickiness....

For a Christmas flare, I doubled the recipe and added 6 crushed candy canes. They turned out fabulous. I wasn't sure how much to flatten the rolled balls at first but learned that it doesn't need to be a lot. Yummy, not overly sweet, recipe. I will definitely make again and again.

I LOVE sugar cookies so I am pretty picky about sugar cookie recipies..this is one of the BEST ones I have tries. The cookies are really flavorful and crisp without being dry and crumbling when you bite it. I used the red sugar and they turned out great, especially with a glass of nice, cold milk.

Sounds very similar to a family recipe for sugar cookies. One thing we do to make it easier is to scoop the dough, dampen the bottom of the glass and dip it in sugar, and then flatten. A bit easier than rolling and then flattening. We also dip our glass in colored suagr for the holidays.

Totally delicious cookies!! These are my new go to recipe!!  These are more crispy cookies & if that's wh want these r by far the best!! The only thing I changed was I added a tsp of almond extract flavor we enjoy.  We used cookcutters on some(after freezing dough for 20mins) & they turned out great!  Thanks for the great recipe:)

Fantastic recipe!  I started with 2 dozen and refrigerated the remaining dough.  The cookies were literally gone from my stovetop before they even cooled!  Hubby and kids thought they were over-the-top delicious.  Needless to say, the remaining dough got used immediately!  Easy, no-fuss recipe made with basic ingredients, yet turns out better than any other sugar cookie recipe I've tried.

This recipe was my first time making any kind of cookie from scratch. It was really simple to do and the cookie came out great. I cut down on the original 30 serving size and made 15 and it still tasted great, light, and sweet even after cutting the recipe in half. I will definitely use this again

These were awesome...and sugar cookies aren't my favorite.  I didn't have any vanilla, so I omitted it completely.  They were soft and delicious.  I will make these again.

This was my first time making lemon sugar cookies, for a tea luncheon.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The cookies came out perfect.  Crisp and brown around edges and bottom, but chewy and very flavorful in the inside.  A very delicious cookie.  I am making them again this weekend!

This recipe makes for really flavorful cookies.  Half-way through the recipe, I realized that I only had bread flour--I used it anyways and still had great results!  Frosted with decorator frosting (from this site).

These cookies were made, a few days ago.  My granddaughters (ages 7 & 5) made them, while I made sure they were doing the right thing.  They liked the cookies so much that I only got to eat one.  They wanted me to review this and let you know that your recipe was very good for them to make and eat,, they sure want to give you over 5 stars.  Thank you very much for sharing this recipe.

Very good cookies!  My only complaint was I had to use a TON more flour to make these 'rollable'.  Maybe next time I'll try rolling it out between two bread bags, like I do my pie crust :)  But even with all that extra flour- still a very yummy cookie!

This was super easy.  I needed to make a vegan version (no animal products) and it still turned out great!  I substituted margarine for the butter and flax seed for the egg.  The kids loved them.

Cookies turned out great. I had a little trouble keeping them from getting sticky while trying to use cookie cutters on them. I ended up putting dough in the freezer for 30 mins. It helped but not much. Still worth the effort! I used the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe to top them. Super Cute

My cookies probably came out a little different than others since I read the recipe wrong (added two 1/4 cups of flour instead of 2 1/4- stupid me!) and the dough was really sticky, so I had to add handfuls of flour until it evened out enough for me to shape it.    I chilled the flattened dough for about an hour or two to avoid another unfortunate melting accident that happened when I tried making snickerdoodles (better safe than sorry, I guess). Despite my botching of the recipe, the cookies came out pretty good in the end- kinda crunchy, but chewy in the middle, which is okay since my dad likes hard cookies and I like soft. He brought home sugar cookies from the store today, but they weren't nearly as good as these! I think I'll make these again sometime...the right way. :)

For me these cookies were ok.  I would have preferred them to be sweeter and less fluffy.  However, my kids went nuts for them.  I had to make a second batch an hour later.

LOVED these cookies!  My husband isn't a very big cookie person and he kept saying, "these are really good!"  =)  I noticed some people said they don't work well for cutouts, I didn't have a problem using the shaped cookie cutters, but when using embellishment cutters the embelleshment disappeared after they baked.  I also put them on sticks...cookie pops anyone?  After painting them and everything they came out adorable and were a huge hit at the christmas party I brought them too...everyone thought I bought them!

I am not a good baker, cook, etc. and these turned out GREAT!  If you can follow a recipe you can do it, very easy.  Fun for kids to help as well.  My 4 yr old loved making the balls, dipping in the sugar and flattening.  We will be making these for the next holiday and the next and the next.  :D

I have made this recipe now twice, and it is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever made.  I did alter it slightly by using 1/2 teaspoon of Vanilla, and a 1/2 teaspoon of Almond extract.  I feel it rounds out the flavor a little more.  Thanks for sharing this classic Helen!

These cookies were perfect  They tasted delicious and even though I rolled them thinner than I usually do, they were not brittle and were still a good combination of crunchy and chewy.  I made cut-out cookies and then decorated them with the  Royal Icing 111 Recipe.  Yum!

Half way between a short bread and a sugar cookie, this cookie can be made more festive by rolling it in sprinkles or coloured sugar. I used 100% butter instead of 1/2 shortening. Quite good, even though sugar cookies really aren't my thing.

This made a delicious sugar cookie.  Will use again when I actually bake (not big on baking cookies because then I'd eat them).  :-) Thanks!

These cookies were good!! The only problem I had was that they were a bit crumbly toward the end but I followed some of the reviews and baked them just a hair shorter and they were great! I will make them again.

My mother made cookies that tasted just like these.  Of course, though I loved them I never asked for th recipe and is too late.  Well, it seems as though this is the recipe, if not, it is really close to it.  I'll be eating them for a long time to come !  Will I gain weight...?  nah!  I love them!  I made them both with and without rolling them in sugar and both ways work.  I find it that it is really a flexible recipe and this makes them quite a treat because you may impress your friends by simply adding a little bit of your favorite flavors.

Wonderful! I made these for my boyfriend on Thanksgiving. My dough turned out a little dry, but just add a little milk. I made mine a tad moister because of all the flour you HAVE TO PUT DOWN on the mat and the roller. (but that goes for all cookies) Definitely put it in the freezer for about twenty minutes after you make it, or while your trays are baking. It'll be easier to work with. And only put them in for 6-7 minutes, because then they stay kinda soft in the center. If you really want to make them even more awesome, check out the Sugar Cookie Icing that JBS BOX has up on this site. It works great and definitely compliments the flavor of the cookie.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have shortening so I substituted with butter and they turned out just fine. Make sure you roll the cookies into TINY balls, these cookies get huge otherwise.

Very good cookies. Were easy to cute out and decorate. Only reason I don't give five stars is because there wasn't anything special about them. Very good and easy cookies to make.

Fun easy tastey... everyone loves these sugar cookies, and I love making them because they are soooooo easy.  I do bake them a few minutes less so they are a little chewey and I sprinkle a little extra sugar over the top before I bake them.  I also dip my glass in sugar in between smashing the cookies down and this helps from the cookie dough sticking to the cup.

I made these thinking that the dough could be rolled out for cookie cutters, but it was much too sticky to accomodate a rolling pin.  Still, these are scrumptious and I will make them again...a perfectly soft sugar cookie when baked for 9 minutes.  Enjoy!

These made really good sugar cookies. I like the shortening and butter - they came out with the softness of shortening and didn't spread out too much. I did substitute 3/4 cup of the flour with  whole wheat pastry flour and they were great.

This recipe was really good! Everyone liked them and they smelled great! I only changed three things about this recipe: I used 1/4 cup less flour than the recipe called for, I baked them for 8 mins and they turned out great. I also was out of vanilla extract so i used almond extract instead and it gave the cookies a nice flavor, i will definately try that again! :-)

These sugar cookies are the best! So easy to make and they taste so good. My coworkers rave that these are the best sugar cookies they have ever eaten. The only negative is that they are difficult to use for cutouts.. but I can get over that!

These were delicious- word to the wise: not for using cookie cutters.  The dough is quite wet and I needed place the dough in the freezer between batches so I could work with it. I frosted them with vanilla (store-bought) frosting tinted with green f.c. for St. Patty's day.  Big hit in my daughter's kindergarten classroom!

Very good. I cooked a dozen by rolling them balls, dipping them in sugar, and smooshing them. Then I refridgerated the rest overnight and made them with cookies cutters the next day. They worked very well both ways. The cut outs didn't loose their shapes or poof out too much at all. Tasty. I also used 1 cup butter instead of half butter and half shortening.

Sometimes you just have to try a recipe to see if it's good, and it's difficult choosing when those ratings are all over the board. But, Wow. One of the best sugar cookies I've ever tasted. Crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, just a really good recipe. I really wanted to make cutouts out of these but the cookie expands in the oven. It more than makes up for this, however, in taste. YUM. This is a keeper.

These were excellent, crusty and chewy inside.
I added fruit bits and some almond oil.
A great basic recipe that you could add anything too!

Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out great - and I'm not a typical cookie baker. I usually don't even like sugar cookies, but these were great and we'll make them again!

Hmmm, I'll give it 3 stars because they taste good, but I didn't really like how they turned out. I tried these because I promised my kids cut out sugar cookies that they could frost and decorate for Christmas, and I have lost my old, tried and true recipe. I made them exactly by the recipe except that I used all butter because I never buy shortening, and that I only put them in the oven for 9 minutes. I froze the dough in a ziploc in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then put it in the fridge until I was ready to roll them out. Then I kneaded the dough a bit to warm it up, and rolled it out between waxed paper, and cut out the shapes. I baked it on foil lined pans for easy clean up. What I don't like is that they spread all over in the oven, sticking to one another and did not hold their shape of the cut outs well -- not like the ones I am seeing in all these pictures. The kids won't care as long as they have something fun to do in the morning while I am busy with Christmas preparations, but I think I will keep looking for a good sugar cookie recipe.

we substituted shortening for 1/4 c butter.we also took away 25% butter out of the over all recipe.we picked this recipe because of the GREAT reviews but found out it was not the best for cut outs,so we refrigerated it for an hour and then used cookie cutters and baked them.it worked perfectly,they got a bit fat but you can clearly tell what shape they are.They are also a little bit crumbly,so you HAVE to be careful,but overall i give them 5 stars for the yummy  taste.My grandmother(53)and I(13) will enjoy making these for a VERY long time

These cookies were great. I made mine too thin so they werent chewy, but hard. My husband on the other hand has quite a way with cookies, made them about 1/4 inch thick and with 10 minutes of cooking they are perfect. We used cream cheese icing mixed with food coloring. They are very cute, and yummy too. thankyou

Sigh.. Didn't read all the reviews to see how poorly these turn out for cut out cookies. Despite chilling the dough, the cookies puffed up quite a bit while baking and lost a lot of shape. Were also very hard to transfer from the sheet to a cooling rack because of how crumbly the cookie's texture is. I ended up breaking a lot of cookies. The flavor of the cookie is pretty average, and the texture is not similar to any other sugar cookie I've made before.. I thought maybe I had made the recipe wrong but I followed it fairly closely. Very disappointing.

These cookies turned out wonderfully!  Following some of the other reviews, I baked them for about 8 minutes.  They didn't come out quite as soft as I expected even with the shorter baking time, but I think it's because I made the cookies smaller than the recipe intended -- I doubled the recipe and ended up with around 90 cookies.  I also had a bit of trouble with the cookies sticking to the baking sheet, but by using a thin spatula and being a little more careful than usual, I only had 4 or 5 that fell apart on me.

These were delicious and easy to make. They had a good, crisp texture. Rolling them in sugar creates a pretty appearance as well.

Great recipe. I have made these cookies twice now and they have turned out perfectly both times.  I am not a huge sugar cookie fan, but was looking for a good recipe for making them for my kids.  I will even eat a few of these ones they are nice and soft and chewy. This will be the only recipe for sugar cookies I use from now on.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great on taste. Was looking for a cookie to make shapes for Halloween and this cookie wasn't it. It was too soft, even after leaving it in the fridge for a while. A+ for taste C- to use for cookie cutters.

The last sheet of these cookies are baking as I write this! I made 2 changes to the recipe as it is published. First off, I doubled the recipe and substituted 1tsp of Lemon Extract for one of the teaspoons of Vanilla. I also added a bit of nutmeg to the recipe. I was trying to find a recipe that was like my granny's and this is as close as I could find and with those 2 changes, the cookies are JUST LIKE HERS! I baked them for 8 minutes, used Halloween cutters and they are soft and delicious! I am saving this recipe for future use! HIGHLY recommend!

Tried this recipe out, but was disappointed.  It makes really thin cookies and they just lack something special.  Gave them to friends to try and they all said that it was just ok.  They would most likely taste good if dipped in chocolate or with more butter instead of shortening.

Simple perfection.  I used all butter because I didn't have shortening.  But what a pleasure to make such a delicious cookie from ingredients already in my kitchen!

I made these tonight with my 4-year-old. They were fast and easy to make and delicious! I actually substituted butter for shortening as I dislike shortening. We used cutouts and although it was a bit more difficult to use them (dough is very soft), the cookies turned out just fine. They were soft and chewy on the inside. I baked them for 10 min. My whole family was ecstatic! New favorite sugar cookie recipe!!!

An excellent cookie unlike most Sugar Cookie recipes this does not reguire refrigeration prior to handling the dough and or baking!

They are gone as fast as they come out of the oven!

My 14 yo dd found and made these.
She found them fast and easy to make and we all found them very delicious.  I like my sugar cookies crispy on edges but still soft in center.  We added some butter creme icing and sprinkles. Yummy!
