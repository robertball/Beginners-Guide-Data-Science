I would've given this 5 stars except I modified it to suit my dietary needs. I don't eat processed foods so I did not use tomato sauce or Worcestershire. Instead I pureed two medium tomatoes to replace the canned sauce and left off the Worcestershire sauce altogether. I used one stalk of celery, two small carrots, half and onion, half a bell pepper. I seasoned with 1/2 teasp. sea salt, and a palm full of parsley with a squeeze of lemon. I also used thinly sliced lemon on top of the fish while baking. 

It came out supremo!! It's nice to be able to convert a recipe to something all natural, and his one was easily converted.

This is also excellent if you use extra firm tofu instead of fish for a vegitarian dish.

I enjoyed this recipe as a nice change from the usual fish dish. I wasn't paying much attention and used probably 2x the Worcestershire sauce called for. Maybe more. It tasted great! It added a nice richness and tang to the sauce. I also used tilapia fillets, added garlic and failed to garnish.

Mainly it comes down to an issue of taste. Celery is the dominant flavor here and that was not popular. I prepared this with Jasmine Rice and Baked Vegetables. I can appreciate that others might enjoy this flavor, but it was just not right for us.

Very good.  I marinated it for 5 hours.  It was just a little bit too sweet for me.  Next time I'll use less sugar.  There will be a next time.

this is a very tasty dish. i made it with cod instead of halibut because of the cost, and used fresh tomatoes pureed instead of canned sauce as another reviewer suggested. made it into fish tacos with cabbage and spanish rice. very yummy, will definatly make this again.

This was really wonderful with pollock.  Made white rice and served the sauce over the fish and rice.  Great meal.

I used Sole.  Loved this lower-calorie dinner.  I served it over rice and topped it with some Parmesan cheese.  What a treat to have a yummy, easy, healthy meal!

This is an amazing way to do halibut! The fish was flaky and juicy, unlike the usual dried out fish I often end up eating. The only thing I have to say is that it was a bit too salty and I added some cayenne pepper to give it some oomph. The veggies under the fish were still crisp and flavorful even after cooking. Loved this one.

I made this with flounder.  Excellent tasty dish. Left out the celery and did not miss it.  Leftovers were also good.  I will definitely make this again and again with different kinds of fish.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

We really enjoyed this, although I had to make some small tweaks to get it just right. Overall, it was kid-friendly and delicious with moist brown rice. I was forced to replace the onion with onion powder, celery with dried dill (really good), and the lemon juice with LIME juice but it turned out great anyway! I also used a whole can of sauce and drizzled 1/2 cup melted butter on the fish before baking. The only thing lacking was a little kick for me and my husband, but I think a few shakes of red cayenne pepper would do the trick. Definitely will use this recipe in the future! A great way to do fish that I've never tried before. :)

I used tilapia since that is what I had on hand and used jar marinara sauce for the tomato sauce.  I didn't measure ingredients but I know I did not use as much salt as recipe calls for and it was plenty salty.  Hubby rated it 4 but asked for seconds.  I give it a 5 ... it can't get any easier to make and it is low calorie and tastes fantastic.
