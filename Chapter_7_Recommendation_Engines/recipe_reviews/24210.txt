Yum!  I did however make a few minor adjustments .  First, instead of sliced bananas I put the bananas in a food chopper.  As for the rest of the batter  I added a bit of cinnamon, vanilla extract, used half brown sugar/half white sugar and soymilk.  Also, I just used enough butter to coat my pan once and I had no problems at all flipping any of the frittatas.  This was a simple, easy recipe and the frittatas came out moist and wonderful.

I've made savory frittatas before but after reading the recipe and the reviews was somewhat confused.  I didn't know whether the 3 serving size was 3 paper-thin crepe like frittatas or 1 frittata cut into 3 wedges!  This is what I did....I only made 1 frittata, MASHED the banana and added to batter and poured all the batter into pan and cooked on medium heat for about 4 minutes.  The middle was not firm so I put under broiler (on Lo) for about 2 minutes.  I then slid out the frittata onto plate.  I turned pan over the frittata and plate and flipped over.  This was just to make sure the middle was done (only about 30 seconds).  I flipped back over, let cool and sprinkled with powdered sugar.
I sliced into 2" wedges.  My family gobbled it down!! I barely got one piece and my husband was asking if there was anymore.  I will make again!

This recipe is delicious!!!  We have a large family, so I tripled the recipe.  My toddlers as well as my older children loved this dish.  Very filling!  Typically, I don't use white flour, but I wanted to make the recipe as written, so next time I have a point of comparison.  I'll update when I use the whole wheat flour.  I did substitute virgin coconut oil for the vegetable oil and that was delicious.  Updating my review!  This recipe is delicious using whole wheat flour.  With the substitutions of whole wheat flour and virgin coconut oil, this is a very delicious and healthy breakfast!

This one was hard to rate. I'd say 4 stars if the texture wasn't so odd... the bananas and egg combination was a little offputting. The flavor was fairly decent, though. However, I wouldn't make it again just because it wasn't that great. When it came time to flip, I realized that the frittata was going to fall apart because of the heaviness of the bananas pulling at the batter from different angles. I loosened it from the skillet with a spatula and slid it onto a dinner plate. Then, holding the plate directly over the skillet, I flipped the plate over, dropping the frittata back into the skillet to allow it to brown on the other side. Stayed together just perfectly. I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the batter and cut the oil in half (could stand to be cut a little more). I also used margarine instead of butter.  Served with sliced bananas and powdered sugar on top. Thanks, I had fun making this. :)

These are messy and it would probably work out better to make smaller pancakes, the kids do enjoy the flavor though. I certainly wouldn't throw them down the disposal, what an unnecessarily rude comment.

This tastes great!  I often cook it for breakfast because it is so good and very easy to make.  I did try it in one large skillet to begin with but quickly found out that it works so much better by cooking it in a 6 inch non-stick skillet so I end up with two smaller ones instead of one large one.  I cook half at a time.  Makes it easy to flip and makes the perfect breakfast for my husband and I.

I really liked the way this tasted.  It was kind of messy when I flipped it over.  I think that was due to the sliced bananas.  I think next time I will try smashing the bananas before putting them in the batter.  If I had made several frittatas instead of one, it would have turned out perfectly.  It's a great alternative to pancakes or even a light dessert.

Interesting.  Eggy.  Too much oil/butter, though.  Overpowering flavor of bananas.  Next time I'll add vanilla, less bananas, and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

loved this! made with some changes. used spelt flour. added some cinnamon and vanilla.  sliced the bananas in half before slicing again.  used brown sugar instead of white. you really have to let it cook til it's pretty set before flipping it. had no problems with flipping it. served with maple syrup. delicious and different!

Very good. I didn't have the issues other described with flipping it (which was surprising, as I can barely flip an egg without disaster). I STRONGLY SUGGEST COVERING IT WITH A LID WHILE COOKING; I did that and it cooked without issue. I followed the recipe except that I mashed the bananas with a fork before mixing them into the batter. I only had a 3.5 qt. saute pan (stainless, not non-stick), but the butter and oil were more than adequate to keep it from sticking. I cut it into four pieces, garnished it with more banana slices, and sprinkled it with powdered sugar. I feel like I got away with having dessert for breakfast - YUM!

FRITTATA DISASTER ALERT! Try at your own risk! This was terrible. It looked like where someone had thrown up, and I suspect tasted about the same. It was impossible to turn over in one piece. Not even powdered sugar could help this mess. The proper rating would be -*****. Mine went down the disposall. Sorry!!

This is such an unusual sounding recipe, but I've become addicted to it! I cut the recipe in half, and my toddler and I eat this frittata several times a week for breakfast now. The only change I have is like others, which is to mash the banana(s) and mix into the egg/flour mix. The KEY to cooking this frittata well is LOW AND SLOW. Low temp, and longer than you would, say, an omelet.

I was really impressed with how good this tasted. The eggs gave it a great texture, it was a refreshing change from our regular sunday morning pancakes. I used 2 large bananas, and at first I was worried that it was too much, but I dumped them all in anyway and it was so good! I didn't put anything on top of it, it was so sweet as it was. My girls loved it, too! I didn't even tell them there wasn't syrup on it, they never noticed! This is going in my family favorites recipe book! Thanks so much for this recipe! The only change I made was to omit the oil. I just used about 1T butter in the pan and it was perfect. This made 3 servings for me.

The flavor was good. But you have to make sure that the oil and butter are really hot before spooning in the batter - I didn't and mine stuck horribly to the pan. I wasn't able to turn it without completely mauling it. If I try this again I'll make sure that the oil is sizzling first!

This was clearly an effort to make something similar to banana fritters without the deep frying, and w/ less frying altogether, and it ALMOST worked.  The taste is pleasant if you add 1/4 t. ground cardamom.  However bananas w/ their natural sugars & starch are just about the stickiest thing you can put in a pan, and flipping this gooey "frittata" is quite challenging.  If you divide it into something more like pancakes, keeping the diameter no bigger than the length of your turner, change the milk to either buttermilk or plain yogurt, and add 1/2 t. baking soda, it just about works, but the bananas still tend to stick to the pan.  Especially if you're like me and avoid non-stick cookware and use a well-seasoned griddle instead.  I also think that the recipe would work better if the 2T. of oil were incorporated into the batter, and only some butter were used on the gridde.  Even so, when you pour the batter onto a hot skillet to make a solid crust and then turn the temp down to cook it through, as you should, these things are still somewhat messy.  I'd rather make a hi-protein version of banana bread (extra egg, some wheat germ).  Kids like that too.

Excellent recipe. Followed suggestion of other reviewers and mashed the bananas instead of chopping them.  Also, served them as pancakes, as that was the easiest way to get it turn over. And a pinch or two of cardamom powder compliments it beautifully!

We really enjoyed this, whatever it did to my bananas was fabulous, very sweet.  I was able to get 4 servings from this because I spread my batter to the edges of the pan.  Hard to flip but I managed!  I ate my portion like I would a piece of pizza, that part was fun for the kids!  Next time I will decrease or even omit the oil, I don't even know why I used it at all.  I never use oil when making pancakes.  But now I know.  Btw, blueberries work very well with this too.  I had some frozen blueberries that needed some lovin' and this recipe definitely hit that spot.  Thanks for sharing this, I am now very fond.

The recipe was not bad but needed some changing for better flavour and texture. I followed most of it but like the other reviewer, added a few drops of vanilla extract and fresh ground cinnamon.  In addition, I replaced white sugar with raw cane sugar from Bulk Barn.  The frittatas were hard to flip as just sliced chunks so I recommend mashing the the bananas first. I let the bananas ripen until the skin just started turning black (like prepping for banana bread) and the banana flavour came through gorgeously. My fiance loved it from the smell.  We drizzled it lightly with some apple syrup for that kick in flavour, and had it with jasmine green tea.

I admit that I was a little nervous making these after reading the negative comments.  BUT, These turned out delicious!  I did follow some suggestions from other reviewers: mash the bananas instead of slicing them, add a little vanilla extract.  I only used 2 TB of oil in a small skillet pan.

They turned out delicious.  They're more like banana pancakes than frittatas.

I used apples because i was short bananas, but it was still awesome. Tastes unique and is a break from the norm of typical breakfast foods, not too mention simple to make. Awesome!

I really liked this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. My only gripe is that it was too oily- maybe use less oil in the pan next time. Also, it is really easy to flip if you have a good pan.

Yummy and easy recipe! I omitted the oil, and used approximately 1 teaspoon butter. I am a terrible flipper, and the heavier banana pieces gave me a hard time. However, I wouldn't mash the bananas next time, because I prefer the sliced ones texture-wise. I will probably use the dish trick or bake the whole thing next time. Thanks for a keeper!

My husband loooves pancakes but loved the crepe-like texture of this recipe even more.  Only used 1 chopped banana (so we can vary the toppings later) and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract per user recommendations.   Using an 8" non-stick pan yields about 4 thin pancakes (not crepe-thin but thinner than your standard pancake).  Used medium heat to brown one side and turned to low heat after flipping.  Had no trouble flipping and there was no mess at all; I didn't even use oil.  Topped with sliced bananas and nutella.  Yum! Thanks nausheen for the great recipe.

This was REALLY big hit at our house.  The flavor is really wonderful- it does take awhile to cook.  My daughter loved it, a real treat for kids... we had it for breakfast, kind of like doughnuts, but it would also be good for dessert. Thanks so much for posting this unusual and delicious recipe!

I wanted this to work so much.  I cooked it in the pan for over 40 minutes, and it still wasn't cooked all the way through.  I'll take any tips other reviewers could offer.

This were excellent and easy to make.  I added vanilla and cinnamon like some of the others suggested and skipped the oil and just buttered the pan.  Used an easy banana syrup recipe I found on this site.  Great combination.  Yummy

I'm not sure about this one, and I agree with CookinBug that it's eggy, weirdly so in my opinion.  I'm honestly not sure how to address that--I'd like to take out the eggs entirely, but then it wouldn't be a frittata, now would it?--and it's okay with the egg.  My favorite was eating bites with sliced banana that I put on top.  I'm not sure I'd have eaten most of it without the banana.  I mashed the banana with a fork then mashed it into the batter.  I still found it hard to flip but was able to do so without it breaking--I guess my pancake practicing stood me in good stead.  I halved the recipe and only made one since bf is sleeping dead to the world this morning.  If you're wondering how I used 2/3 of an egg, I just used egg sub  1/4 c is a whole egg, so I used slightly more than half that.  Despite the fact that I'm not sure about this one, I'm glad I gave it a try.  It was a fun and quick recipe this morning.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't have a nine inch non-stick pan so I used the one I do have which might be about 6 inches. In that case, I made a few small frittatas this way. I also mashed the bananas before adding them to the mixture. I tried the recipe with banana slices too and I think either way is fine, it is a little more challenging to flip with the slices, but not impossible, maybe that is because mine were generally smaller frittatas than the recipe calls for. The flavor was good, it was kind of like a big pancake. For my picture I used a pizza cutter and made a square and a "checkerboard" design with Hershey's syrup, some mixed frozen fruit, and whipped cream. Overall, it was pretty good, would make it again.

My kids gobbled this up. I made it as written, just added a little vanilla. To keep it from breaking, I slid it over onto a plate and then flipped it using the plate. I'll make it again, very easy.

WOW. Absolutely delicious. Being married to a Pacific Islander and having a son who is half islander I try to find creative ways to use bananas, which they love. I was thinking of making banana pancakes but all the recipes on this site suggest you add vanilla, which I didn't have any of. So I found this recipe and so glad I did. I doubled the recipe but I used a total of 6 tbsp. sugar and added 1 tsp. cinnamon to make the batter even sweeter and when they were done cooking I sprinkled them with more sugar. This recipe is definately a keeper for me. I myself don't really care for bananas, but even I enjoyed these.

I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but 1/4 cup milk did not make a "smooth batter," more like a ball of dough. So I added a little bit more milk until it was a smooth batter. Everything else I followed to the letter. My very picky (but banana pancake loving) kids LOVED it. It is yummy if you like cooked bananas (which we do!). I look forward to trying it with apples.

It went together quickly and I liked that I usually keep all the ingredients on hand.  The kids loved them!  I feel better about serving them this than pancakes because it has all that banana in it.  The banana makes it sweet tasting and the powdered sugar on top makes it great.

This was a huge hit at my house. I doubled the recipe, mashed the bananas, added a sprinkle of cinnamon, and a dash of vanilla and baked it.    I also cut out the oil completely and used only the  butter for the bottom of the pan.  Another benefit of baking.   If you are going to bake it, use a round baking dish, and if you are doubling the recipe, make sure its deeper than a standard pie plate. Preheat the oven AND the baking dish to 375. Once its preheated, add your butter to the bottom of the pan and let it melt, use a pastry brush to completely cover the bottom of the pan. Pour in banana egg batter and then bake for about 35 minutes.   My kids loved this recipe. And cutting out most of the fat, I think its a pretty healthy breakfast or even dessert choice.   Roughly estimating the calories in vegetable oil, cutting the oil decreases the calories per serving by 80 calories and the fat grams by 9... bringing this down to:   Per Serving: Calories: 264 Fat: 6.2g

So easy! And so good! I made it for brunch, and didn't eat the whole thing.  When I got home from work, I grabbed the last piece and ate it cold.  After it had sat for those few hours, the tastes settled and mingled a little more and it was even better!  I did add a little vanilla and a little cinnamon too, which made a nice little addition.  I will be making this again soon!

I made this using whole wheat flour and Splenda and it turned out great. The flavor was nice and it was very simple to make. My only complaint is that it is very greasy, so if I make it again, I'll cut mthe amount of oil in half and see if that helps.

This recipe was lovely. I did add a few ingredients though. I made half the recipe and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and also 1/2 tsp of baking soda for a fluffier frittata. I also mashed the banana instead. This made two frittatas for me :)

This was delicious, but messy. It took a very long time to get golden brown and firm. This frittata is very hard to flip and it turned out to be more of a banana scramble. I also added vanilla and cinnamon.

Delicious! Great texture that is totally different from something I've ever had. The only thing I did different was use coconut oil in the pan and sprinkled it with some cinnamon sugar when it was all done. I didn't even feel bad eating it because it was basically all bananas. So good!

Wonderful! I added a little vanilla and cinnamon to the batter. Didn't have any trouble turning the frittata over (cook on low heat), just patience helps until it sets. My son and I couldn't decide if this would be labeled for breakfast, dinner or dessert. Thanks for the recipe! Next time, I might drizzle with chocolate sauce.

I must admit to not being all that comfortable in the kitchen, but this recipe was so easy that I actually had fun!  I used Splenda instead of sugar, but otherwise tried to follow the directions faithfully, and it turned out great.  Even my husband, who can cook, thought so!  I'm definitely going to make this again --- maybe I'll try the apples next time!  Thank you for posting this recipe.  JCB

Loved this simple recipe. Instead of slices, I mashed bananas to add flavor in every bite. Also added vanilla essence, my mom's tip. Best is cooking in my well patina-ed cast iron wok! They came out PERFECT.

Okay - why flip when you can bake is my answer.  I'm a notoriouly bad flipper so I melted the butter and oil (of which I only used half) and put the batter in evenly then placed the whole skillet in a preheated (very important) 375 oven.  I let it bake about 10 minutes then broiled for only 30 seconds to brown the top.  I came out lovely and is quite delicious.  Can't wait to try with apples or pears.

Really good - I took other people's advice and mashed the bananas.  I also added toasted pecans and used whole wheat flour; they still turned out great. The only problem was flipping them (which it seems was a problem for several people).  Next time I will let them cook longer before attempting the flip.

Really good flavor! I was surprised with the whole egg and banana thing but tasted fine. I made it the way the instructions say for three frittatas but then added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter and made them into "crepes". Then spread a thin layer of nutella on the crepes. I definitely would make these again!

My grandson I both loved these for brunch! I used a much smaller skillet & made the frittatas about 5" across. I didn't have a problem w/ either turning them (I did use a huge pancake spatula though) or them being too mushy. My grandson did mash up the bananas some while mixing & I think that might have helped overcome the mushiness some others encountered. I cut the recipe in half but added just a bit extra flour & milk. They were still pretty eggy (I used a large egg) but I liked that. They reminded me somewhat of german pancakes w/ bananas. I spread them (I got two 5" frittatas) w/ Nutella (a hazelnut chocolate spread), gave them a dollop of whipped cream & garnished w/ some chocolate sprinkles. Heaven on a plate!

I usually don't use recipes but this one is very easy to follow and amazing taste.  I must mention that I added a few things like: extra 1/2 cup of flour to batter, almond extract, cinamon, half & half, a dash of nutmeg and mashed  bananas [[use the almost black ones to get a great banana taste!]].  It is definitely a hit!

My toddler loves these. Her pediatrician put her on a high-calorie diet, so despite the frittatas being nutritional (the bananas), she's also getting calories from the other ingredients. I found them to be a little doughy on the inside, but this doesn't seem preventable as the bananas are so gooey (but the batter definitely cooks). I cut up the bananas finely so that my toddler could handle the bites, and this seemed to help with the frying. Mine didn't fall apart at all, but I remember having added more milk than what was required for the batter to get it a little less gloppy. I didn't sprinkle them with sugar, either. They're sweet enough without. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yes... Very messy and I couldn't keep it from breaking apart, but my kids loved the taste! Next time I'll try to make little pancakes instead of one big dish.

Hmmm, I think if Im going to do something like this, I would prefer Dutch Babys. The fritatas texture and flavor was very poor. I fried banana slices in cinn/sugar and added after, but they couldnt alter that rubbery texture of the egg mix. I a professional cook and I do private events as well as private cooking for clients and Im always looking for new and interesting. I would say, tweak this recipe to give it some real mouth appeal and keep trying. Sometimes we fail.

We loved this recipe! I wondered what the difference between this and banana pancakes would be and it turns out the texture and taste is just different. It was a nice surprise!

I would highly recommend to mash the bananas/use a blender to incorporate the bananas into the mixture, making it easier to flip. I also added a bit of vanilla extract and cinnamon. The trick to this recipe is to use LOW heat so that you have enough time to spread and thin the batter out in the pan. That way, you will get a continuous beautiful brown color when it's done. These turned out just sweet enough without having to add any syrup or additional sugar. Next time I'll reduce the sugar in the batter and sprinkle powdered sugar on top!

Overall very tasty. I made the mistake of adding all the batter to the pan like a pancake, which resulted in much browner edges and  a less cooked middle from the oil and butter being pushed to the edges of the pan. I think next time I would add the butter to the batter to see how that changes the flavor/ texture.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I wasn't sure what to expect as I had attempted banana pancakes before without success.   I wanted something that was different from the traditional pancake recipe that was fast and easy - and this fit the bill!   I followed the recipe as is, however I added a little cinnamon.  I used very ripe bananas and sliced them.  I didn't over mix the batter and I cooked it thoroughly before attempting to flip.  So simple and so good - thank you Nausheen!

I gave this 3 stars simply because I made revisions of my own. I know from experience that the bananas would make the frittata heavy, therefore making it difficult to flip in the pan. So I mashed the bananas then added them in. I also added extra vanilla and doubled the recipe. This recipe is pretty versatile so don't be afraid to make adjustments according to your tastes!

This is a great use of bananas that are just about to go by.  I made half the recipe and added 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda for lift.  It’s easy to flip in a small Teflon fry pan.  It made for a wonderful breakfast.

added some vanilla and cinnamon. aslo a wee little bit of baking soda. used only one banana and mushed it all up. cooked in 6 inch pan, (made two)with a dose of vege oil and some butter. seemed to cook the one side quickly, causing me to flip...ahhh, thats where the mess comes in that everyone mentioned. added butter only to pan when doing 2nd one, liked the mostly butter one better. Got good reviews, no one LOVED it, but it was a nice treat.

Great recipe, terrible execution.  Just me? Nope, seems others felt this was huge and unmanageable ... Makes the largest mess!  But tasty :). Yes, make pancakes not one large frittata. also added my left over sweet platanos on second try and defrosted frozen bananas that had started to brown.  Why waste?!

Looking for a recipe to use up some eggs and bananas.  Tripled the recipe and on the advice of others I added some vanilla and cinnamon.  I cooked these in a six inch skillet and they were very easy to flip. My family really enjoyed them and have asked to have these put in our breakfast rotation!

This is a super quick and easy recipe, minimal ingredients and a great way to use those frozen bananas you have in the freezer. The frozen bananas are perfect because once thawed they're nice and soft and can mix easily into the batter. I found that I wasn't able to flip the frittata without broiling it a bit first because the top was too runny and bottom was brown and crispy, so ideally you would use a frying pan that you can throw in the oven. After a couple minutes under the broiler I took it out and put it back on the stove, flipped it, and fried it a bit longer to get that nice crisp on both sides. Delicious! and makes enough for two people.

I made this today for the first time and WOW!!!  Instead of AP flour I used whole wheat, mashed the bananas with my whisk prior to adding then added vanilla extract and cinnamon into the batter.  Cooked on my griddle omitting the butter and oil in an effort to make it a little healthier.  Served this with cinnamon whipped cream and caramel sauce drizzled over it and it was divine!  Kids gobbled it up!

High carb breakfast for runners! I made this recipe adding a splash of vanilla extract. Sauteing in coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Mashed bananas instead of sliced. Divided between two frittata's in a 6 inch fry pan. When done plated and kept in warm place. Placed 2 Tablespoons of butter in fry pan added a sliced banana and 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar. Heated until warm and bananas started to soften. Spooned over two frittata's.

I followed the instructions but I added a little more sugar, some honey, some nutmeg, vanilla. It def needed more milk to make a smooth batter do I added that. I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. They came out phenomenal!

Good flavor but I expected a completely different consistency.  I made one subsititution (egg whites instead of whole eggs), which may have been the cause.  But this "frittata" was more like a pancake.  I even ended up putting syrup on top.

This was very tasty. We added a dash of cinnamon powder and vanilla extract. This was one of the very few recipes we already had everything to make. Nevertheless, we'll be making this again! It was just enough to serve 2 for breakfast.

I really like this recipe for my over-ripe bananas. I generally substitute whole wheat flour, and sometimes egg beaters for the eggs. I agree it is best to mash the bananas first. And I add 1/2 t vanilla and 1/4 t cinnamon. I don't use the recommended amount of oil butter - I just use enough butter or cooking spray to coat my pan.

These were so easy and had lots of flavor.  I didn't use any of the butter or oil, and instead spooned them on to an electric skillet and made mini pancakes.  Served with a dusting of powdered sugar and a zig-zag of chocolate sauce on top.  Yum!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did add an extra banana, vanilla, cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg. I also mashed the banana's. I made silver dollar size pancakes and had no problems with mushiness. Thanks for sharing

The family loved this easy and delicious recipe.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and lessened the oil and butter, and added some vanilla and pumpking pie spice.  Also, worked really well to cook the size of pancakes. My toddler gobbled them up!!

Not bad.  Very quick & easy, though I did cut the recipe in half & used a smaller pan.  I think it would have been tough to turn at full-size.  I did add a bit of vanilla & cinnamon, poured a little cream & sugar over the top (didn't feel like whipping the cream! LOL!!!)

Edited to add: I tried it this morning with some pitted, halved Bing cherries replacing one of the bananas and it was a hit!

Ends up pretty dense.  I didn't have the mushiness problem that others did.  It was okay, but nothing special.  I doubt that I will make it again.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but no matter what I did it turned out mushy.  I followed the recipe exactly and even put it in the microwave afterward to try to make it less mushy.
Perhaps there should be more eggs?
I won't make it again.

My niece loved these! They froze well and were great served alongside blueberry pancakes, sausage, and OJ, but a bit sweet & rubbery on their own. Thanks for the recipe!

I added a 1/4 cup of heavy cream and a little allspice.  It's kind of a decadent breakfast, but it's really simple and quick, and so yummy that you'd never guess it's so easy.

I wasn't fond of it myself even after drizzling it with honey and coconut, but I'm giving it 5 stars because my boyfriend, a connoisseur of food, thought it was yummy! He topped his with a small amount of cream cheese.  (And I used Splenda vs. sugar in the recipe because it was on hand.)

I added some ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to the recipe and changed the butter to a non-fat olive oil spray.  In addition, I made five smaller servings instead of one and added a drizzle of chocolate syrup on each before serving.  Yum!

Very yummy and very filling.  I did add a bit of vanilla and beat in the bananas in a bit - giving it a somewhat lumpy consistency.  Whipped cream on top is good, too.

I thought this was going to be weird, but it turned out very yummy!  I used vanilla soy milk and egg substitute and skipped the oil and butter to make it a little healthier.  I sprinkled some chopped pecans over it and drizzled with some light syrup... yum!  Even my fiancé loved it!  And the best part--it was SO easy!  I will make this again and again!

I made this recipe over the holidays and it was soooo good!  I made one large "Frittata" for my boyfriend and I - we spilt it and served it with warm maple surup!  to be honest i over cooked one side but i've always been bad at the "first pancake" and this recipe is all ONE "first pancake" - next time i will stand over it.  I will make this again for sure!

Sorry...we tried to like it. Maybe we're just not banana frittata lovers. I made it just as directed but added a splash of vanilla, and cooked it more the size of pancakes, since I knew my children wouldn't be thrilled with the banana chunks (although they like bananas) and wouldn't like a doughy texture that I was sure cooking in smaller portions would take care of. First I sprinkled powdered sugar on and none of my kids would eat them. Then I cut them up into bite sized pieces and sort of "stir-fried" them in a little more butter to try to make them a little less gooey, then poured syrup over them at my kids' request. One out of four ate them this way. The 3 of us who ate them gave the different reviews: 2,3&4 stars. Thus the rating. See, we ended up totally destroying the fritatta to eat it, and that's why I conclude we just must not be banana frittata lovers. It looked really good, though.

Mmmmm- this is such a great idea! Made some changes though: Halved recipe; used "eggbeaters"; a little less sugar and a little more salt; 3/4 of an overripe banana, thinly sliced; added a handful of diced walnuts. I cooked it- covered- in a small skillet with NO oil, just brushed with butter, over medium-low heat. Dusted w/powdered sugar. YUMMY- excellent flavor! Thanks for sharing the recipe.
