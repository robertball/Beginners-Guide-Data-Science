It's my recipe, so of course I love it.  If you can find the chipotle in adobo in the store, I really suggest using that.  I usually take the whole can, peppers & sauce & grind it in the mini chopper.   Then I drop tablespoons of it onto a cookie sheet lined with non-stick foil.  Pop in the freezer until they are set, & you can pop off the tray into a ziploc & store in the freezer & use as needed. I usually use 2 tablespoons for each chipotle a recipe calls for.  You can also stir into into Chili or soups or enchilada sauce for some extra kick.  Also, be sure to salt the avocado sauce well, if you think it is bland adjust the salt.  If it is not salted, it is just green goo.  If you want it spicier, add some of the ground chipotle.

OK, I made this several times since my first try and I still love it; and you have to try it.  But just have to tell you a funny stroy - the first time I made it I read the directions wrong and used the whole can of peppers - no wonder it was so hot.  But now I did as some one else recommended and freeze them in two tablespoon increments and then when I make it the peppers are ready.  ORIGINAL RATING:  I saw this recipe and really liked ihow it looked;  and then went home last night and made it and am in love.  The sauce its GREAT and is not suppose to be like guacamole its a wonderful dressing that really goes nice with the 'hot' spices; a great complement to the dish.  The only thing I did different was to add cilantro to the dressing and its great.  I have told several people about it already this morning.  I WILL make it again.  Thanks a lot.  PS - I also cooked up the rice from Chipotle's to go with it.  Great dinner, if you like spicy you will love it.  Just sorry I forgot to make Margarita's it was late when I got home and totally forgot.  Its quick and easy to make after a long day at work.  : - }

This was quite good! I was skeptical about the avocado sauce after blending it and taking a taste, but with the fish it's really good! I doubled the whole recipe, which made LOTS of sauce, but its okay, it doubles as a sort of dip :)

I couldn't find the pepper and adobo sauce, so I followed other's suggestions and substituted Chipotle hot/tabasco sauce. It smelled so good! And I used "Hint of Lime" TostitosÂ® for the breading for some extra flavor. 

The only thing i'd say is make a little extra of the salsa blend to drizzle lightly over the fish before the avocado, just for a little extra punch.

Made it for the first time tonight..  Worked out real well...my family liked it a lot!  Next time I may try using Chipotle Tabasco sauce instead of the canned pepper as it's a little easier to come by.

This meal was easy to prepare. I liked the crunch and flavor provided by the corn torilla crust, lime and chipotle peppers. My husband and daughter did not like the avocado sauce. If I make this again, I will make guacomole or an avocado salsa instead. Overall this meal was healthy, easy to prepare, and tasted pretty good. Thank you for new way to prepare tilapia.

Absolutely perfect. My wife baked this on a cookie sheet in the barbeque grill. Served with corn relish and tortilla chips; drizzled some of the sauce on the chips. A light dinner. Very nice. Thank you, LARANEFF, for posting it.

This was delicious, especially for someone who likes spicy. I paid attention to a couple of reviews and made some small changes accordingly. I doubled the ingredients for the sour cream sauce, as it doesn't make much. I added cilantro to the sour cream sauce (did it in my food processor and turned the sauce a lovely light green. I had leftover red chipotle pepper sauce after coating the fish, so I put some of that on the baked fish first before serving it, then a dollop of the sour cream/avocado sauce on top of that. It was beautiful as well as tasty. I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty dish.  Enjoyed the avocado sauce as it helped to cool down the spiciness of the fish.  I did however, add as suggested by other reviewers, some cilantro to the avocado sauce; giving it just a tad more favor.  I also liked that the dish was light and not fishy tasting.

This is pretty good!  Next time I will grind the chips until they are like cornmeal.  The big chunks kinda get soggy and don't crisp up. But still a keeper!

Because avocados are 3 for $1.00 here, I couldn't resist buying a few. Since I had tilapia in the freezer, I searched for recipes using tilapia & avocado. I had everything on hand for this one, so gave it a try. My family's really glad I did. It has a nice kick to it & is easy to make. Do remember to salt & pepper the avocado sauce.

Very good!  I used 1/2 the can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  Seeds and all, we like the extra kick.  The avocado sauce was great for me but my husband thought it could use a little extra.  Next time I think I will add some cilantro, onion and hot sauce to give him that extra flavor he was looking for.  I served this with Mexican rice and corn.  I will definitely be making this again!

I added garlic salt to the avocado sauce and used a food processor to make the tortilla chips into a finer crush. I also pureed the salsa and chipotle. In order to prevent from turning the delicate fish while cooking I placed the fish on a cooling rack over a baking sheet prior to baking. This turned out great and the avocado sauce helped balance the heat.

DELICIOUS!!!!! I doubled the avacado sauce and added cilantro and one fresh jalapeno to it. Saved 1/2 of it for a snack with crackers. I also used fat free sour cream and skim milk.  I also used dried bread crumbs instead of the tortilla chips.

I made it exactly according to the recipe and it seemed that noone in the family liked it. It may have been the fish, but I used fresh Tilapia. As for the sauce, I was out of sour cream and subbed cottage cheese. This was actually the best part of the meal! It was very yummy and we will make the sauce again.

Aside from underestimating the spice-factor of this, I really enjoyed this dish! I modified the method slightly... didn't feel like dirtying extra dishes, and my small food processor is packed (moving soon!), so I just mixed the chipotle/salsa mix in a bowl and brushed on the base of the dish, laid the fish on it, then spread the remaining mix on the fish. I topped with the Lime tortilla chips (YUM!) and baked at 400 for about 15 minute. I didn't feel like having a runnier sauce, so I skipped the milk. To serve, I plated some jasmine rice, topped with the fish, added a little shredded lettuce and sliced onions...with the sauce on the side. Yum! Quick and delish!

The fish was good... I used baked chips but the avocado sauce was gross to me.  I scraped it all off my fish. Next time I'll just use guacamole.

The fish was nice and crispy. Perfect and simple for summer. I can't rate the sauce. I love the yogurt based sauce from Fish Tacos on this site and it taste great on all fish!

Good flavor altho we didn't care for the sauce at all(lime was overpowering). Considering it may have just been the size of my avocado(smallish), I'm rating this a 4 instead of a 3. The fish was also waaaay overcooked, very dry. Still tasted good & I'll make the fish part for hubby again. Thank you!!

This was a great change to the monotonous beef or chicken meals that we seem to fall prey to.  I did not use the chips as we do not eat corn but still it worked out great.  LOVED LOVED LOVED the avocado sauce.  Next time I will have to warm it up a bit though, it seemed like it was kind of overpowering the warm fish.  And as the submitter stated, DEFINITELY use the adobo sauce opposed to a substitute.  It made all the difference.  I found it very easily at Whole Foods.

This was a big success this evening.  I had some difficulty making the sauce (and it did not look at all like the picture....it was green) which was difficult to blend, but the fish turned out great and we loved the chipotle sauce in which it was coated.  I used regular breadcrumbs instead of tortilla chips because I had them.  Will definitely make this again!    [Served with steamed broccoli, pasta side dish, and white wine]

super easy recipe to make, extremely spicy for me, but my husband loved it.  Next time I make it I think I will make two different batches - one for the wimpys in the family and one for the brave.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I loved this recipe.  It's easy to make if you have a Magic Bullet because of all the blending required.  I followed the recipe exactly and the fish came out perfect.  I had to cook it a tiny bit less since myWolf oven seems to cook everything faster.  I skipped the avacado sauce and instead made guacamole.  This recipe is a keeper!

We like spicy so I used two chipotle peppers, will cook the fish a bit longer the next time.  Otherwise was very tasty, however found the avocado sauce to be a waste of time, no flavor unless I did something wrong.

We loved the flavors of both sauces. It worked especially well with Orange Roughy fish. The only thing that didn't turn out great was the chip coating... I used a fresh bag, and ran them through the food processor, but maybe because it was a thicker chip, or I didn't crush them enough, the texture was too tough, like they were stale.

This was amazing! I added a little chili powder and some sauce from the peppers to the avocado sauce and used lime Tostitos which was recommended by other reviewers. Also, I didn't flip it half way through, I just cooked them for 30 minutes. Perfect! My husband said it was probably the best thing I have ever made! Will definitely be making it again, and again, and again! :)

I think I might be in the minority, but, we didn't care for this fish recipe.   I crushed the chips and coated the tilapia.  After cooking, the crust was chewy and not crunchy.  For those of you that want to make it - I would recommend pulverizing the tortilla chips in a blender or food processor.  That would probably prevent the "chewy" texture and enable the crust to get crunchy.   I also found it very difficult to flip the fish half way.  Tilapia is a very delicate fish and it is easy to break apart.  The crust was also falling off in places.   I had average size tilapia pieces and 25 - 30 minutes would have been way too long to cook the fish.  The general rule for well done fish is 10 minutes baking time per inch of fish..   We only needed to cook about 15 minutes total.   I did think the avocado sauce was good, but, it seemed like it was missing something.  I think cilantro would have brightened up the sauce and gave it that taste I was missing.

Really nice to have a different way of cooking Tilapia, which in my opinion has become the new chicken! This was amazing. On that note, I bet it would taste good made with chicken also. PLUS the lady that submitted it gives a great solution for the leftover chipotle pepper and adobe sauce. I now have a batch prepared in the freezer for the next time I cook this.

What a great way to serve up tilapia. I used a bit more salsa since my chipotle pepper was insanely hot, but our fillets were pretty big and turned out I needed more sauce. The avocado sauce was a perfect topping. This recipe paired very well with Amy's Spicy Beans and Rice.

This recipe is outstanding!  We just had it tonight as fish tacos, and it was a huge hit.  The heat of the chipotle pepper and adobo sauce was exactly right.  We used haddock (no tilapia available), but it didn't matter.  Used a fresh lime for the lime juice, and followed the recipe as written.  For the tacos, we added some vegs (onion, red cabbage, tomatoes) - but you can add what you like.  This one's a keeper.

I can't speak as to the tilapia just yet, but the avocado sauce is BRILLIANT!  I served it, omitting the milk, as a mayo alternative on Blackened Salmon Po' Boys and it was absolutely delicious.  It's a great option for those of us who love avocado, but hate guacamole.  So if you're iffy about trying this recipe because of the avocado sauce, just make it!  You'll be happy you did.

This was so easy and delish! The only thing was the avocado sauce was a bit thick ... BUT together the flavors were amazing! I will be making this again! Each time I make this it gets better and I really don't know how that can be .. Avocado sauce thins out when more milk is added and I leave out the salsa ... use the adobo sauce as a paste and brush on fish and grind chips until they are very fine.

This...was SPICY. Definately not for the sensitive pallet. But that was okay for me. I ran out of the breading so half way through coating the fish, i had to make more. I used cod bc I didn't have tilapia and i used chicken breasts because my boyfriend is not a seafood fan. So...i foiled the pan and sprayed with PAM. Still stuck. and when i flipped the meat over, the bread crumbs fell off. So i scrapped them off the pan and layed ontop of the meat. 

on to the avocado sauce....weird flavor. I added cilantro hoping that would help. negative. i thought, well maybe it will be awesome on the fish.

took it out, plated it and topped with the sauce. garnished with cilantro. Took a bite and NOT A FAN. I don't know what it was. Just....too much spicy (too overpowering for such a delicate fish) and the avocado was just weird. I threw this one out. Sorry.

I am not a big fish fan, but I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  It was a huge hit with my husband and I.  I really liked the spice on the fish and the delicious avocado sauce that cools your palate after the spice.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe!

I didn't really enjoy this recipe....I think it would have been better without the tortilla chip breading.  the flavour of the chips just didn't work right, it was very heavy and seemed to overpower the fish.  I think that it would be better using only the spices as a rub and leaving out the breading.  Also, I altered the sauce a bit - I just made a lime flavoured tartar sauce.  I really liked that and would make it again with a chipotle rubbed pan fried fish.

Great recipe. I misread the first ingredient clearly and used the entire can of peppers. Made for a very spicy fish, but with the avocado sauce and rice, it was tolerable. Good thing we like it spicy!

Unlike other reviewers, I actually wanted this sauce to taste *more* like avocado! I thought it was fairly generic -- smooth and nice, but didn't taste like much. I'd like to make this again and heighten the avo taste of the sauce, as well as skip the tortilla crust on the fish and just put on more salsa.

I followed the recipe for the fish part. I didn't add milk or lime to the avocado sauce, I just used some leftover homemade salsa Verde....worked very well. Some of the tortilla crust fell off in clumps when I turned the fillets, and what stayed on did taste a bit soggy. Although it still looked pretty, not overly impressive. The cooking time was too much, just go by the thickness of your fish. Another reviewer said 10 min per inch, that is a decent rule. I will maybe do this again, but with no chip crust. Thank you for sharing!

Omg definitely will be making again. I used Panko instead of tortilla chips cause I didn't have any tortilla chips and it turned out perfect. I paired it with mexican rice and steamed veggies. My whole family loved it and is raving about it. I wish I could add a photo.

Next time i would use two chipotle peppers to give it more kick. We used 1.5 lbs of fresh grouper cut up into 2"x5" chunks. I made a dusting of the chips in my food processor and laid it on thick prior to cooking. Fish was moist on the inside and crusty on the outside. Will definitely make it again.

I happen to have all the ingredients on hand.  I made this as directed.  It was easy and just the right amount of spice.  Husband really liked it and so did I.  The avocado sauce was a little bland so I added cilantro and garlic salt.  Will make this one again.  Thanks for the recipe.

The recipe is good. for some reason my breading did not stick to the tilapia very well, so I scooped it off the parchment paper and put it on top. It still had great flavor. I was out of milk so I used heavy cream in a food processor to make the avocado sauce. BEST decision ever. It makes the sauce fluffy and it tasted great with the fish (and some tortilla chips!) My husband did not like the green sauce on its own, but he said it balanced the spiciness of the fish nicely. I would make this again.

I have made it with tilapia and it was excellent! This is one of the few ways my husband will eat fish. It is very spicy, but very good. I will be trying this with chicken tonight, I'm sure it will be just as awesome!

Very tasty! We love the spicy/cool combo. The sauces were a great combination.  I doubled the recipe of the green sauce, the second time I made it, because my family wanted it for a dip with chips!   will definitely keep as a regular go to recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious 5 star tilapia recipe! The only thing I did differently is fry my own tortillas chips and season my adobo mixture before brushing it on my tilapia. Dredging the tilapia in the chips before baking it gives it a nice crisp texture. You can find adobo sauce with peppers at your grocery (next to the canned chilies where the corn tortillas, refried beans, and taco shells are at.) It is like a bbq sauce with a smoky flavor. The avocado sauce really brings the flavors here together!

I really wanted to like the flavor of this but it just did not seem to work for us. I followed the recipe exactly but I didn't think that the fish had enough flavor and the crushed tortilla chips were soggier than I wanted. I suppose I could have cooked it longer or broiled it a bit at the end but then the fish would have been way over-cooked. I did like the avocado spread a bit and may steal that for other uses.

Was really good.  Not nearly as spicy as I thought it would be.

Not sure if I messed this recipe up but I did not like the chips....very soggy.  Also thought the avocado was tasteless.

This was good and I used 1 pepper and the adobo sauce and it smelled SO good when I was applying it to the fish but you really couldnt taste the adobo sauce mixture once the fish was cooked and it had no spice at all. We will try it again and tweek it a little

This was excellent and my husband and son loved it. One person commented that it works on frozen fillets, just increase time. I would NOT recommend that. I think it will be much better if I make again and defrost first.  Other than that, excellent recipe.

This is easy but has so many layers of flavor - it tricks people into thinking you spent a lot more time than you did.  Excellent blending of flavors.  Spicy lovers enjoyed the fish most and more timid tongues found the sauce made it just fine for them. Great company recipe!

I tried this last night and it was pretty good. Not outstanding - it seemed it was lacking something to me. I might play around with it a bit, but the original recipe was quick and satisfying.
