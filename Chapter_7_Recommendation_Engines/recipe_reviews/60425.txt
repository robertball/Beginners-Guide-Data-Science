I think I have a better filling for this cake it's like the coconut filling in almond joy and mounds candy bars. It's so easy to make and it tastes great! It has a great texture and bakes up great in a bundt cake. Mix together 3 cups of Bakers sweetened coconut, a can of sweetened condensed milk and a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

When I was a teenager my mom made me this cake because I liked coconut.  Now I remember making this cake mix a lot growing up until Pillsbury had the nerve to discontinue it. I have just made the cake from the recipe and followed it exactly except I buried my coconut ring of filling under some of the cake batter.   Upon tasting the cake I noticed several things...  The first was it was heaver than the original. It was also lighter in color. The coconut filling of the original was denser when it was spooned into the cake batter (which is why I believe it would sink while baking) the coconut filling was more finely chopped (almost minced?) and more of it.  The coconut filling was more the consistency and texture of a thickish pudding. (sorry, best way I can describe it).  Does anyone else remember this?  I have been looking for a duplicate for that Pillsbury recipe for many, many years.  Can anyone fine-tune this recipe to make it more like the original?

I was short for time and tried this with a box. I used triple chocolate fudge cake mix.  The box stated 1 cup of pudding in the mix.  It was the perfect denseness and gooeyness. Will double the filling next time and actually try the cake part too.   I was transported back to the early 70's, there was just something about that cake.  Thanks!

I used a doctored up cake mix instead of the "scratch" cake.  Overall it came out good, but my cake didn't cover the coconut ring (but I did double the amount of coconut mixture which I think is necessary).  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will pour 2/3 cake batter, ring of coconut, then rest of batter to be sure it is surrounded by cake.  I did make the glaze chocolate but will try it plain next time (maybe with some toasted coconut on top!).

I had been looking for a good recipe for this cake for YEARS and was so excited to make it. I followed the directions EXACTLY and against my better judgment did not alter the directions to put the "tunnel" of coconut filling in between layers of chocolate batter. The chocolate cake was good (a big like a pound cake in texture) BUT the coconut layer was never enveloped by the chocolate cake. Result?  No "tunnel" of coconut filling but a crispy top (actually the bottom) of a crisp coconut egg-white mixture that we chipped off. We enjoyed the chocolate cake nonetheless, but I was very disappointed that there was no tunnel of coconut. I'll give it another go -- and next time will put half of the batter in and then the coconut mixture and then the other half of the batter. 

The other point I'll share with y'all is that I used the new silicone style bundt pan and the cake took 90 minutes to bake (and no, it wasn't overcooked at all, by some miracle).  

So give this a go, but do alter the directions and do not leave the coconut topping on top of the chocolate batter.  I also think that a box mix (gasp!) might be closer to the original cake than this one, although this one is very good and is VERY much like the chocolate pound cake at Starbucks!  This cake, baked as a pound cake, with an espresso/cocoa drizzle would be excellent with a great cup of coffee or espresso!

When I was younger, we all enjoyed the Pillsbury Bundt cake too. It was my Mom's favorite. Yesterday was her 79th birthday so I made this cake for her party. It was delicious; however, we all thought there wasn't enough coconut filling so the next time I make it, I will double the recipe for the filling.
I poured some of the cake batter in the bundt pan, then added the coconut filling, then poured the rest of the batter on top. I also used boughten cream cheese icing which I added milk to to make it thinner.

This recipe is really good. It turned out just as advetised. I remember the original box cake from years ago and this is a good replacement. This brought back a lot of memories, thanks for the recipe!

Thank you!  Thank you!  When this was available as a box mix it came with a small recipe book which I have saved for years just in case Pillsbury decided to sell the cake mix again.  One of my favorite varieties was a Chocolate Mint Macaroon cake which our family loved.  Thanks to your wonderful recipe we have created it again.  Just add 1/2 tsp peppermint extract and 6 drops green food color to the macaroon filling.  Then, add 1/8 tsp peppermint extract and 3-4 drops food color to the glaze.  It's delicious!!!! Thank you so much!

This recipe was wonderful!!!!!  It was a beautiful cake as well.  Although it was wonderful, I wonder if perhaps using a devils food cake mix instead of the homemade version, would create a cake that would be that gooey moist.  But I also wonder if it would be strong enough to hold the coconut center.  Regardless,  you cant go wrong with this delicious, comforting dessert.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I made the cake according to directions, but changed the filling according to another reviewer (coconut, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla) and I also covered the filling with batter.  I am very pleased with the outcome -  not exactly like the old Pillsbury mix, but close enough for me.  Also, I didn't feel it needed any glaze or icing - plenty moist and the filling makes it plenty sweet.  Thanks - I'll be making this  a lot -  hubby loved it also!

Love it!  I was surprised to see so many people who remembered the old box recipe. i did follow the suggestions from other reviewers & i almost doubled the filling. And I also kept some chocolate batter to cover it, since the filling would have just stayed on the bottom. also, i had to add more butter and milk to icing, since seemed to be all icing sugar. other than that it was great-really capturing the original box recipe.

I've been looking for the Pillsbury duplicate myself for years too!  Anyone have an idea?  I gave this three stars only because I haven't tried the recipe yet, but am searching for the Pillsbury-like coconut filled chocolate bundt cake recipe! :)

Cake was excellent, but alas, no "tunnel!"  The coconut sits on the cake plate.  I also will try pouring some batter in the pan, topping with coconut mixture, then adding the rest of the batter.

While this cake was good, it did not meet my expectations of the original cake. This was my son's favorite cake for years, and when he tasted it, his comment was "It does not have the dark chocolate(almost black) color",and he was right.  I will try again with the dark chocolate mix and use the directions for pound cake. Also, I am going to chop the coconut a little finer, as it was in the original cake.

As is, the recipe is not optimal.  I like the recommendations - double coconut mix.  Also, only add 1/2 batter to the pan then add coconut then cover with remaining batter so tunnel is in middle instead of bottom of cake.  Lastly, I drizzled melted chocolate chips instead of the sugar glaze to add a more chocolately taste.

yum. something fun and different.  i think i cooked it a tad too long, so it was a little dry, also i would try to bury the coconut mix a little better because it got a little overdone.

While this cake turned out beautifully, it took so long to cook (60 min at 325 degrees) that I was really expecting something spectacular, but was disappointed.  The cake was just an average chocolate cake, with some coconut in the middle.  I'm sorry...not worth the time and effort.

This was pretty good.  Although I did not bake it in the bundt cake pan, I made it in a few mini tunnel cake pans and some cupcakes instead.  But the glaze is delicious,  I think I will try it on a couple of pound cake recipes I have.

I made this with my ornate bundt pan and it turned out great.  I buttered my pan with a paint brush to be sure to get every nook and cranny and then floured it.  The only thing I would change would be to put 3/4 of the batter in, put the macaroon mixture in and then cover it with the rest of the batter.  My macaroon mixture didn't fully sink in and it got crusty.  I topped it with chocolate ganache rather than the glaze.  Everyone thought it was great

I was disappointed with this cake. It wasn't that moist even after adding extra water to the batter and my family and I decided the chocolate cake just wasn't anything special worth making again.

Good idea and it looked like it would taste good....but it did not!  We couldn't even finish the piece that we took.  I sent the rest over to my sisters family who's electricity is down because of the snow....I'm hoping they'll eat it in desperation! LOL

I was disappointed. The cake isn't moist and isn't a flavor that I was expecting. Not sure that I would make this again.

The cake itself was divine. I doubled the filling and was glad that I did.  The icing was a disappointment, however that may be because I am use to much better.  I normally make a Southern Living chocolate pound cake with a boiled chocolate buttermilk icing that is sublime.

Delicious.  I did follow other reviewers advice and covered the filling with the cake batter.

This is a GREAT revival of the old Pilsbury mix that both my husband and I loved as kids.  Juanita, thanks for toying with a scratch recipe to bring it back; we truly enjoyed this cake.

Oh, wow!!  My dad used to make a pillsbury chocolate bundt cake with a vanilla center mix for my birthday when I was little.   The mix we used wasn't coconut, though, just vanilla.  He'd also put a can of maraschino cherries around the top instead of frosting.  I've been looking for a recipe like this for years -- thank you for the jump-off point to play around and try to recreate this recipe from my childhood!
