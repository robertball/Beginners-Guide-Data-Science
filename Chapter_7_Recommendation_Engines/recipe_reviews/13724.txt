This is good. I have taken this recipe to many functions. Everyone loves it! For variety, I eliminate the raisins and sunflower seeds and use red seedless grapes, halved and toasted almond slivers. Yummy!I get lots of requests for the recipe even from my husbands fishing buddies!

This has been one of my favorite salads for a couple of years.  I'm not a raisin fan, but in this salad, with the blend of the onion, the bacon, and the sweet-sour dressing, the taste is wonderful.  The only thing I do differently is use pine nuts.  I prefer the flavor of pine nuts, and they are larger and don't seem to stick to the bowl as much as the sunflower seeds do.  I have even used sliced almonds as well.

I have made this salad for years.....without the raisins and sesame seeds.  It is always a hit!  Another suggestion, if you are trying to cut out sugar, make it with "Splenda" sweetner---tastes the same without the extra carbs/sugar!!!!

Every time I make this I print out a few copies because everyone that tries it asks for the recipe.  That way I can just hand it over.  I am always asked to make this for potluck bbqs.  I leave out the bacon for less fat and use red wine vinegar.  Love it

YUM!!! I had been looking for a recipe like the Deli Broccoli salad I enjoy. THIS IS IT, YAY! My husband said he could have used lighter on the red onions, but I LOVED IT JUST THE WAY IT WAS. I can see how you can change this to your own taste. THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE to start with. LIKE IT as is and LIKE it if you change per your favorite taste! GREAT RECIPE, DO TRY!

The amounts are off in this recipe.  Either double/triple the amount of broccoli or cut the other ingredients in half.  I substituted craisins and used a small handful of bacon bits so I could keep it vegetarian.  Definitely prepare the dressing the day before and mix the two together so it can sit for half a day before serving.  SO good!

I have made this for my diabetic mother, but the whole family also loved it! Made a couple changes, used golden raisins AND dried cranberries, Splenda instead of sugar, added halved red seedless grapes, 1/2 cup finely shredded cheddar cheese, and added some chopped green onion I needed to use up. Very colorful and this is a great recipe for the Holidays, a nice alternative from all the heavy casseroles my family makes!

This is an awesome salad!  Everyone loved it, right down to the pickiest eater.  I chopped up some red, yellow, and orange sweet peppers for color.

I like this salad, this version is the closest to mine on ratios of mayo/sugar/vinegar.  I prefer cider vinegar and use golden raisins. Instead of sunflower seeds and bacon I used a cup of hickory smoked almonds, chopped. That's a great trick for substituting for bacon in salads that I learned from a PCC Natural Markets recipe.

This is the best broccoli salad there is. My grandma used to make this and I was so happy when I found the same exact recipe. I always double the dressing because I like to make this the day before I'm going to serve it and I noticed that the broccoli really absorbs the dressing so it is good to make extra for the next day.

Used Tarragon Vinegar instead of White Wine vinegar and came out superb. Used maple flavored bacon as well.  Substitute GOLDEN raisins rather than regular raisins. Due to the vinegar marinating on the broccoli...be aware of the strong odor of the lefovers....but very good!

This is very similar to a broccoli salad that I make. This recipe is wonderful with shredded carrots and since I don't much care for raisins, I substitute dried cranberries. By far my favorite salad recipe!!! Cauliflower tastes good in it too.

This salad is great, even for a late night snack. It is the perfect mix of sweet and salty. I use golden raisins instead and blanch the broccoli so it's not so chewy.  I could eat this 2-3 x's a week easy!

I know I'm in the minority here, but I just thought this was so, so. It is quick and easy to prepare, and I followed a lot of reviewers advice to make a day ahead so the flavors meld. When I ate it though, there was nothing about this salad that made me want to make it again.

This is excellent! I made for Thanksgiving and took readers advice and used equal amounts of sugar and vinegar and used craisins instead of raisins. I mixed the broccoli and onions the night before and mixed the dressing the night before as well - and tossed them together morning of. I will be making this A LOT! THANKS!

I make a twist on this created by my aunt and it gets rave reviews everywhere I take it. In addition to broccoli, add a head of cauliflower; in place of raisins use craisins; and mix 2 tsp. curry powder into the dressing. Makes it even better!

This is a truly dynamite salad, but when I make it, I nix the onion (many people don't like it and it is served on a buffet).  I add the raisons, sunflower seeds, and bacon and chop the broccoli small so it is more like a cole slaw.  The last thing I do is use Cole Slaw Dression instead of a mayo combo, and it is fab and gets high 5s.  Amazing how a few simple ingredients can turn a veggie many do not like into something "everyone" will eat :)

This was awesome!  I made it for Thanksgiving and am just now getting around to reviewing.  I gave this recipe to many people who asked for it.  I made some notes about using red wine vinegar, and not all of the sugar.  Basically just followed the top 10 helpfuls.  Thanks!

Big flavor. Nice crunch with just the right amount of tang.

This was SOOO good.  I always used to treat myself with the one from the deli counter.  This is WAY better, especially because I see what goes into it.  Even my husband loved it and he always gafaws at raisins.  This disappears at every BBQ.  FYI: Use your judgement as to the amount of broccoli.  Heads of broccoli vary in size.  I adjust all ingredients accordingly.  Trust your taste buds! That's what cooking is about.  ENJOY!

great way to make raw broccoli a little more enjoyable. instead of mayo & white wine vinegar I use fat free yogurt, red wine vinegar, a little lemon juice & splenda. and I used red grapes instead of raisins . Everyone loved it

Absolutely what I was looking for.  I healthied it up by using fat-free mayo and didn't miss that part at all.  I did use the Hormel Bacon Bits that are 50% reduced fat.  I love the flavors of the red onion, raisins and bacon with that dressing.  I used on med bag of the broccoli/cauliflower mix by Dole that was BOGO free last week.  Perfect salad and it lasts days in the fridge.

I love easy and delicous recipes and this was one of them! Not that it needed it, but I did make some minor changes.  I did not have white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead.  I also used splenda in place of sugar, "ready to serve" bacon, light mayo, unsalted sunflower seeds and a bag of pre chopped broccoli.  This was ready to go in a matter of minutes and a HUGE hit with the family!! I've never seen broccoli go so fast!

Make sure you use a very large head of brocolli or else you have too much dressing. Adding a little shredded carrot adds nice color to the salad too!

ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!! I made this for Thanksgiving and it was GONE in no time! Now I'm making it again for a Christmas dinner this weekend. Instead of sunflower seeds I used shaved almonds, because that's what I had at the time, it was great! I used red wine vinegar instead of white, again, because that's what I had. I also added some shredded cheese for more color. Thanks for this GREAT recipe!

Addictively delicious!  I subbed Craisins for icky raisins which turned out great and used red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  Only had it set for about 45 minutes before serving and it was great - not too raw tasting and not soggy.  My husband LOVED it and said he'd be happy if I served this with every meal :)

I love this salad! However when I had discovered it at a church potluck it had craisins in it instead of raisins, sliced almonds in place of sunflower seeds and no bacon. It's very festive and a wonderful addition to any holiday supper.

I've made this several times and it is always delicious.  I make it with light mayo to reduce some of the fat.  When I want to make this as a main dish, I add cut up chicken.  Yummy!

We had this with our lasagna dinner last night and was I filled up just with the salad.  Minor changes which would help the waistline since this is calorie rich as it is.  Use already prepared honey dijon mustard salad dressing and not the mayonaise and sugar. What a whopping calorie cut it is.

I have made this several times Let it set overnight and the nuts were still crunchy ( I was concerned they would get sort) Added the bacon the morning of the party just in case. Use craisins which were wonderful in it. JUst made it for a work potluck and had many requests to make it again for the next pot luck. People were actaully disappointed that there were not leftovers the next day to munch on- and thats a first!

This stuff is so tasty.  I add dried cranberries and use a bit more broccoli to extend it a bit.  But what is really important is letting it sit for a few hours to let the flavors meld.  I typically make this the day before I serve it.  It's so much tastier that way!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it. **************************
Based on the reviews I was shocked to find this more of a sunflower seed/mayo salad rather than a broccoli salad with a little too much vinegar. After making, I tasted it and decided to double the veggies (used cauliflower but more broccoli would have done the trick), double the raisins and leave everything else as is. With the slight changes I would give it 4 stars.

I have been making this salad for 5 years now, from this exact recipe, and I am, like many others, constantly begged for the recipe! The only thing I do differently is I use dried cranberries instead of raisins. I love the tart flavor and bright color of the cranberries. People love love love this salad. Also sometimes I spoon a little of the bacon drippings into the salad :) It doesn't get any better than this!
Ok so I lied I do a couple things different... I only use the actual flower part of the broccoli chopped into very teeny tiny pieces...so I use about 4-6 heads of broccoli, which is fine for me because I feed the stems to my bunnies. The texture of it is so decadent this way. YUMMO!

I love this recipe, and am making it to take to family gatherings at Thanksgiving.  It always goes over well with family and friends.  I use real bacon bits instead of bacon (for ease mostly) and omit the raisins.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I used the broccoli in a bag you can buy at Costco.  I did not have white wine vinegar so I used white vinegar and added a little more sugar.  I also added sliced black olives and used real bacon bits you can find in a jar.  Definitely will be family favorite.

You don't need that much mayonnaise. Cut it in half or so. I also used balsamic vinegar in place of white wine. I think any type of vinegar would work for this. Last of all, I added WAY less onion than asked for. All in all, this salad was GREAT but only with the modifications.

Incredible! Only thing I would change is the amount of mayonnaise. perhaps a little less next time.  EXTREMELY delicious though.

loved loved loved this. like one reader, i put broccoli in micro for 1-2  minutes to take the raw edge off. it was still crunchy but just not so raw. any nut will work. have used cashews and CANDIED pecans before too. and craisins work well too. you just make it with your liking, or what you have in the house that day. everybody loves it. i used pancetta one time instead of bacon too.

Wow, this was so good!  I made a large batch for teachers appreciation day and went back right after it was over hoping there would be some left for dinner.  Turns out, of all the wonderful delivered, mine was the first to go.  Making it now for my family.  I substitute dried blueberries for the raisins (YUM!) but, aside from that follow the recipe to a T.  Thank you for sharing this!

This is super good!  I used black currants instead of raisins.  I also added shredded carrot.

I LOVE this recipe! I left out the rasins and doubled the recipe. It was better the next day. Next time I make it I will make it the day before. I thought the broccoli wouldn't stay crisp but it did, for days. Also, I used bacon bits instead of actual bacon.

I found this recipe last year, and have made it regularly since.  The flavors are wonderful together.  I also find the onion to be a little too much, so it chop it very fine, and put only half of what the recipe calls for.  I recommend this unless you really like raw onion flavor.  Great to bring to potluck dinners!

I really liked it.  I, personally, thought the combination of flavors was perfect.  But, I made it for Thanksgiving dinner. More than one person complained about the strong onion flavor.  Next time I will reduce the amount of onion when serving a large crowd.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe and has been a huge hit at all gatherings. Even my fussy younger ones love it. I follow the recipes exactly as it is with the only modification being to use halved seedless red grapes instead of the raisins, a change suggested by other reviewers.This is a family favorite. Thank you Alyson.

This was one of the best salads ever! I used soy-based bacon bits, and the flavor was splendid. I loved the fact the broccoli taste was not strong, and the crunchiness was perfect. Great recipe!

You can't go wrong with this salad. It's the best and I don't think I've met anyone who doesn't like it! I use store bought crumbled bacon and skip the frying. Great recipe.

GREAT recipe!!  I made this for my school's faculty Christmas party and everyone LOVED it!  Not a bite was left.  Thanks for posting this awesome recipe!  The only thing I would do different next time is not add as much sunflower seeds.  Or maybe I'll almond slivers like someone else mentioned before.

This broccoli salad was the best I've ever tasted! I did make one small alteration though. I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used the red wine vinegar I've had in the cabinet for a few yrs. Don't know if maybe the "aged" taste did it or what but it was GREAT. A friend told me abt this receipe & she uses the sauce for coleslaw too.

Going to make this for the second time this week! We used craisins instead of raisins and Oscar Myer bacon crumbles and it turned out delicious! Tangy, salty, sweet and savory! Also good for people with tree nut allergies :) YummY!

Love this salad.  It's such a nice alternative to many of the hot dishes that are offered at the holidays.  It does not keep at all though.  If you make it, use it within 12-24 hours or it becomes limp.

Very good.  I used slivered almonds in place of sunflower seeds and dried cranberries in place of raisins because that is what I had on hand.  I did make it sit overnight as reviewers had suggested.  A great recipe, I will definitely make this one again.

Skipped the onions (didn't have any), used rice wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar (all I had), and actually made half the "dressing" because I wanted more broccoli and less dressing.  It was a hit. As my husband says, "Everything is good with bacon."

I was very impressed with this salad! I didn't use the onions, but used most everything else. I was skeptical about the mayo, sugar, and white wine vinegar, but the ingredients combined together to make a very tasty dressing. Both my husband and I loved it, even though I don't usually eat broccoli and he doesn't usually eat anything with dressing!

Didn't add the raisins--don't like them, but other than that the recipe is a great potluck item and I have used it for years! Yum! It's even good with a 1/2 broccoli and 1/2 cauliflower!

I love this recipe.  I brought it to a party over the weekend and got many compliments.  I did substitute craisins for raisins.  Delicious.

Made it a part of Christmas dinner. I'm not a fan of raw broccoli but this was a great way to get the vegetables in your diet.

This was a major hit! Delicious and easy to take to the potluck at work. I used the real bacon pieces from the pouch and used craisins instead of raisins. Thanks!

I used this recipe on a "girls" week-end away at a friend's cottage.  I forgot to bring the raisons and when preparing the recipe, forgot to add the sugar.  Everyone said it was delicious in any event!  I will definitely use it again.

I have been making this salad for years and everyone loves it!  Who ever thought raisins and brocolli would go so well together?
I have never added sesame seeds to mine, but when I followed your recipe, it was a hit as well.  I have always added some of the bacon in the salad and reserved some for the topping when I served.  It was a nice change and I am glad I checked your recipe out!  Thank you

Made it exactly as written and my broccoli-averse kids liked it a lot. Wondering if blanching the broccoli first would have help slightly. (Or perhaps making it a few hours before so that it could absorb the dressing and soften up.)

Delicious! I mixed the dressing in a bowl separately first so the sugar could dissolve.  Tastes best the day you make it. The next day the broccoli gets softer and I don't like that as much. It's best fresh.

I don't like raw broccoli but I LOVE this recipe!  My suggestion is to separate the broccoli into TINY flowerets so the other ingredients blend in proper proportion.  My whole family thinks it is amazing!

This was a good base recipe.  It needed a bit more flavor for us.  I'm sure it's wonderful for introducing to kids, and it was truly simple to prepare.  Thank you Alyson for a good base recipe I can use to make my own.

This was really good!  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because one part of the recipe says it is ready in 30 minutes, and the other says to put it in the refrigerator for 2 hours.  I went with the 30 minutes, and it was still quite good.

I've been making a recipe like this for 30 years and it IS addictive.  You can also use dried raisins (craisins) instead of regular raisins.  I don't use quite as much mayonnaise as it gets too goopy (and rich) or as many sunflower seeds, but really a wonderful salad.

I took this to a family cookout. I enjoyed it and my aunt enjoyed it but I think everyone else was very "meh" about it. There were a lot of leftovers. Maybe they just aren't fans of broccoli salad? I thought it was good though!

I've made variations of this salad for years. I basically like the dressing but tune it to my own taste. I vary the vinegar. Today I used red wine and really don't measure out the mayo, wine or sugar, just to taste. Today I added red grapes, golden raisens and craisens. It is a great start to a salad recipe. One can add about anything you like to this and it would still taste great. Mandarin oranges would be good too. I also used green onions instead of red as I didn't have any.

Great recipe! But I only used half the bacon and sesame seeds to cut some of the fat in this recipe (apparently 48g per serving according to Allrecipes!) I also used light mayo and only used 2/3 of the dressing - maybe my head of brocoli was a bit small or just a matter of taste (some like it really creamy, I didn't want that much) Either way, it was really good and everyone enjoyed it. A nice way to eat brocoli at lunch!

I don't like my salads too creamy so I used half the amount of mayo (actually I didn't use mayo, I used salad dressing like Miracle Whip) and it tasted great!  Took it to a potluck and everyone wanted the recipe.

I really enjoyed this salad. I did not change a thing, next time I will use half the red onions suggested. I found then a little overpowering. I agree with other rewiers best the next day or two. Hubby and kids werent crazy about it, but that just left more for me....

excellent salad!  i did make a couple changes since i didnt have the exact ingredients on hand.  i added another head of broccoli because there was too much dressing.  so then i doubled the raisins and i shouldn't have - too many!  i added cashews and bacon bits as i ate the salad so they wouldnt get soggy sitting in the salad.  thanks so much for the recipe!

Excellent blend of flavors,  I actually used maple flavored bacon only because it's what I had on hand, yummm!   Planning on making this again this weekend for a family get-together and will be specifically buying the maple flavored bacon again.

This salad is great!  The flavor is amazing.  It's very hard to stop eating it.  I use the pre-cooked bacon rather than cooking the bacon myself.  This saves a lot of time.  I'm not a big fan of raisins, but this salad rocks!

This is a long-time family favorite I've made for many years! We use gold raisins and skip the sunflower seeds. Everyone who has it always asks for the recipe.  Using packaged bacon bits also works just fine, and is a time-saver! It's even better the next day!

I took to a potluck at work and it was the first thing gone.  I didn't have any raisins so I substituted 'Craisins' (sweetened dried cranberries) and used dry roasted salted peanuts instead of sunflower seeds.  Everyone wanted the recipe - and it's so easy.

Ok, I ATE BROCCOLI!  And I loved it.  The sauce is great, the perfect combination of sweet and our.  My husband wants less sugar next time.  It will still taste fantastic.  Also, leftovers are excellent too.

Honestly, I thought the ingredients a bit odd, but together the salad is great.  A big hit at potlucks. I did what the others suggested and used 3 T of sugar and 2 T of vinegar and it was perfect.

This was great.  My family loved it.  We added the extra sugar that other folks suggested and it tasted great.  The one thing we will do without next year is the raisins. They just did not seem to go as well as the other ingredients.

I make the dressing different. It’s really hard to find the Philadelphia stuff so I used miracle whip mixed with balsamic vinaigrette and I don’t use sunflower seeds. This has become such a big hit in my family. It’s all they ever want me to make lol.

This had too much of a vinegary taste and the dressing was too rich despite letting it sit overnight. I had a similar salad  at a work brunch and really loved it so i thought  I could replicate it.  The ingredients were the same except the dressing didn't taste like the smooth creamy dressing of the brunch salad. Guess I'll still search.

This was very easy and delicious!  I didn't have raisins so used currants as an alternative.

I left out the sunflower seeds and had to substitute the white wine vinegar for red wine vinegar. It was very good! Will be making this again!

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I changed was I used cranberries instead of raisins.  Raisins would have been fabulous in it just as well.

This is a really nice recipe, as written. A favorite of mine for summer. Sometimes I just adjust the quantity of ingredients according to what I have on hand, or whether I am craving just a little more sweet, or tangy. I love this with smoked and grilled meats.

The best version in my humble opinion. For a change up I use pumpkin seeds instead of sunflower. Also if I'm in the mood for a salad with less bite, I substitute chopped Apple for the onion.

I used craisins instead of raisins. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I made this a few hours in advance, yet it was just as crunchy and delicious days later. I accidentally added the sunflower seeds right away, it had no ill effect on their crunchiness. Waiting to add the bacon was a good idea. Will add this to my summer salad rotation!

Great base recipe.  I made this for a cookout, and I had to change a few things due to our guests preferences.  We had someone who won't eat raisins, so I had to leave them out (I personally think they would be a great addition.)  Instead, I added some shredded carrot and some shredded cheese.  I also switched out the seeds for sliced almonds.  Very good, and I really think you can switch this recipe up to cater to your tastes...very versatile!

Delightful! I might potentially double the dressing, but that might make it soggy (I like a lot of dressing - what might work is if you were making two batches of salad but made three batches of dressing and halved one between them). I used sunflower kernels instead of seeds with shells, and Oscar Mayer bacon pieces from the salad aisle instea of home-fried bacon. It's easy to overdo it on the kernels - 1 cup seeds would probably work out to far less in kernels. I sort of found it easy to overload the salad with those two ingredients. But it was a tremendous success for this novice broccoli salad maker - the whole family (five adults) loved it. :) Be sure and watch the awesome video - it's very helpful. :)

This really was delish, although the amount of sunflower seeds does need to be cut down by about 1/4 of a cup.  It wasn't a big enough deal to knock it down a star in the reviews.  I brought it to a function w/ a lot of vegetarians, so I subbed the bacon for sliced purple grapes (to take up the bulk from the missing bacon) and about 3/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese (for a salty contrast that the bacon would have provided.)

This is good but I think my sisters is better. the dressing is pretty much the same but she used cider vinegar. 
She uses Broccoli, craisins, seedless grapes sliced in half, bacon bits, sunflower seeds, finely chopped red onion. She said sometimes she even adds poppy seeds.

I use dried cranberries in place of the raisins, yummy even though the color runs (If I make ahead, I just add te cranberries when I serve, to avoid this, but if it's just me eating it, I don't worry about it, still tastes good with pinkish dressing!) I use honey in place of the sugar, and always low-fat mayo....calorie conscious.  Also, sliced almonds in place of the sunflower seeds are great, too.

All of the ingredients in this salad taste so good together!  I use apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.

Delicious. I made a vegetarian version and used plain white vinegar, but other than that stuck to the recipe. Love the textures and flavours.

so good! i did not expect the combo of mayo, sugar and vinegar to work so well together. the only things i tweaked was adding less sugar and adding in a larger variety of vegetables such as: mushrooms and tomatoes. i also decided to put a generous amount of Parmesan cheese to the mixture.

This is a great recipe!  It's nice for a picnic or a potluck.  I am making it this Sunday when we visit my in-laws.  Very easy to prepare.

Too much vinegar.  Grapes instead of raisins, and slivered almonds instead of sunflower seeds make this recipe better.

What a great salad, and incredibly fullfilling!  I actually made this as a side salad for our Thanksgiving dinner and it turned out marvelous!  I made the dressing the night before and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  Then I mixed the entire salad about 4 hours before serving.  I also did what a reviewer recommended and took out the raisins and sunflower seeds, and instead added  2 cups of halved red grapes and a cup of almonds.  There was quite a bit of dressing, so I ended up using only about half of what the recipe calls for.  Fantastic!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was a great recipe.  Since we made it for a family function, I did minus the raisons since some don't like.  I also didn't have any white wine vinegar so subbed Raspberry Blush vinegar, cut back the sugar and put the dressing in a dressing bottle and kept in fridge so the guest could add their own dressing. We also used roasted pine nuts.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good salad.  My only change would be next time I will put equal amounts of sugar/vinegar.  The vinegar was overpowering.  Way too much dressing but I added it a little at a time so it was fine.

Excellent Recipe!  I'm incredibly picky about vegetables, and I love this.  I have made this twice already and both times were a huge success.  My fickle grandmother is still talking about it and I made it for her over three months ago. Thanks for a great recipe.

I left out the raisins and didn't have any sunflower seeds. Used only 1 tbsp. sugar and 3/4 cup mayo. So, I guess at this point, the recipe was altered so much, I shouldn't be commenting but.....I loved it! Thanks!

I didn't care for this.  There was nobody else to try this with me, and I saw this salad at a popular salad restaurant, so I guess many people like this.  I usually love mayo but I felt it was too heavy for this salad (maybe because of bacon?) and the raisins made it too sweet.

I make this without raisins, use pine nuts, and sprinkle with a little garlic salt.

This is a very good salad with a unique taste.  I omitted the raisins because I'm not a big fan and I don't think the taste was affected.  A great alternative to the usual broccoli salad.

I made this recipe for and all-girls get together and for our 2003 Thanksgiving dinner with 24 guests and the people at both parties LOVED this broccoli salad . . . even better was that the people who don't like broccoli (like my hubby) even liked it and went back for seconds!  This is a keeper.  

I made a couple of changes to the recipe -- I used Splenda instead of white sugar and I used regular distilled vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.  I also omitted the sunflower seeds, and on Thanksgiving I didn't have time to cook bacon but noone seemed to notice.

This was okay, but frankly I can't see what all the fuss is about - and I adore broccoli.

This recipe was fabulous!  I made it for a picnic at the lake, and everyone loved it.  Even my three year old son!  Using the aleady cooked, microwave bacon really sped things up.  Thanks Alyson!
