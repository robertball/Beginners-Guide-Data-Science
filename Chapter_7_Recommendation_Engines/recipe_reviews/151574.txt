After reading reviews, I decided to use 1 c. chicken broth instead of water.  I upped the rice to 1 c. instead of 3/4 c. and for more flavor, I added about 1 Tbs. of Worchester sauce to broth and rice mixture. Also, I mixed together a Tbs. each of paprika, garlic salt, and season salt and sprinkled over the chicken legs.  The dish was full of flavor. My husband loved it!  So, that means I'll be making this again, and soon.

I followed this recipe as written and it came out pretty poor. The rice and the chicken both turned out to be overcooked and the rice lacked taste in general. If I make this recipe again, I would add chicken broth to the water to cook the rice in and maybe add some veggies to the rice as well.

Right away I knew this receipe was easy, but I made some of my own adjustments. I used 3/4 cup of chicken broth and 1/4 cup of milk instead of the water. I also added 1 cup of rice, seasoning salt, and added some frozen vegetables. My family and I loved it and ate it with a side green salad.

I just made this dish by combining ideas from the reviews and it was SO GOOD! I am not really a cook but I combined different ingredients and it turned out awesome and full of flavor! 
This is what I did:
Boiled 1 cup of rice for 10 minutes- drained, then poured in the baking dish.
I added 1 can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup,
1 can of mushrooms,
1 cup chicken broth,
1 Tbs worcestershire sauce,
1 pouch of Lipton onion soup/dip mix,
sprinkled dried parsley over the top and
stirred all this together.
Then I added thinly sliced chicken breasts on top and sprinkled them with garlic salt, paprika, black pepper and sprinkled the entire dish with a very generous amount of cayenne pepper! (I like my food with a little spice!)
I put it in the oven at 375 and baked for only about 35 minutes, took it out and let it sit on the counter for another 10 minutes (covered still) and it was PERFECT! The rice was soft and the chicken was moist.
So if you want a flavorful dish... THIS IS IT!

I tried this recipe just how it is first and noticed it was very very bland.  I decided to turn this into a rice pilaf to add some extra flavor and also sear the chicken breasts before hand in a pan.  Like most people, I used chicken broth instead of water.  I also diced up, 1 small onion, 1-2 stalks of celery, and a can of mushrooms and threw that into the mixture to add more flavor.  Everyone in my house is a rice lover so I ususally double the rice/soup/chicken broth and bake it in a 13x9 pan.  I also pan sear the chicken over high heat with lawrys poultry seasoning and paprika to give the chicken a little extra flavor.  This has become a weekly meal in the house, plenty of clean-up time while the dish is baking!

We liked this recipe.  These are the ingredients I had, so it's what I needed to work with.  I used this as a base recipe and then added garlic salt, onion salt and instead of water I used chicken broth.  It was ugly (kind of brown) but tasted good.  Every one of my kids ate it and even my picky son loved it.  I was kind of scared when I plueed out the chick.  It looked mushy, but I stirred it up and it was really nice fluffy rice.  I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours instead of 45 minutes.  It came out perfect.

I have been making this dish for what seems like 15 years.  As the recipe stands, it's pretty bland.  While mixing the soup, water, rice, and seasonings together, I usually go thru the spice cabinet to see what I'm in the mood for!  Celery seed?  Yep.  Poultry seasoning?  Sure.  Sage?  Why not.  Onion powder?  Garlic powder?  The more the merrier!  It usually comes out quite yummy after these little additions.  And to shake things up a bit, try some of the different "Cream of" soups.  I've had good results that way as well.

Followed the recipe exactly (using 1 1/3 cups of water for creamier rice) and was very disappointed in the results.  Instead of "creamy" I had a watery mess.
Although the chicken was done, I felt it really needed to cook longer.  Next time I will use 1cup of rice instead of 3/4's as this was not enough rice for the amount of chicken.  Also needs more seasonings.

I am sure this is a pretty good recipe but it never comes out right for me. I seem to have to bake it for a long time before the rice is done. I am sure it is something I am doing...or not doing.

I thought it was pretty good for a weeknight meal. I used the chicken broth instead of water as suggested, and thought the flavor was good. I will definitely add more rice next time. Also, I baked for 40 minutes and the chicken was slightly over-done (probably b/c I used smallish chicken breasts), so you will want to adjust the baking time according to size of chicken breasts you use. Served with a spinach salad, but I think you could add veggies to this and make it a one-dish meal very easily. It's a good basic recipe that you can throw other pantry items you have on hand to jazz it up, if you want.

Depending on my freezer, I'll occasionally add frozen vegetables to the dish along with splashes of hot sauce and Adobo powder to make this a quick, simple dinner that requires virtually no attention once it's in the oven.

I like to cook but rarely have the time. I tried this recipe & was instantly in love. Following another poster's suggestion, I used chicken broth instead of water. I also used what I had on hand: chicken wings. Served on a bed of spinach, this was WONDERFUL! I have since also tried this recipe with chicken/feta/spinach sausage. A little too wet but otherwise still yummy.

This is a good recipe. Mine is similar, I use one can of cream of chicken in mine also, a full cup of rice, and butter on top of the chicken. I don't use paprika but I should try it. I bake at 350 degrees for 1 hours.

This recipe can be really really good if done right. We've had times when its turned out perfect and times where the rice is still crunchy. We've just starting covering the dish with foil and that seems to have stopped the crunchy rice problem. Although trying to double the rice never works out for me. :(
We have used this recipe with chicken and pork chops. We've also used different soups. Tonight we are using cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. We also sometimes use half milk and half water and we brown the chicken/pork before hand.

For those who find it bland, try sprinkling a bit of dry onion soup on top off the rice mixture, then top with chicken. This is a tasty dish

Looked too bland as is so I changed it as follows.  Used a mixture of rices using 2 cups. Used chicken broth, 2 soup cans worth along with 2 cans soup.  To rice mixture I added sautéd onions, red bell pepper and cremini  mushrooms.  I also put in a couple cups of frozen mixed veggies.  Stirred rice mix together and added to a covered casserole. Chicken went on top but I pushed it in a little.  I then sprinkled Mrs Dash on top and baked covered until chicken temped. The rice was creamy and there was a lot of flavor.  My family wants me to make it again ASAP.

Made these changes: Used chicken bullion, added 1 tsp lemon juice, frozen vegetables, 1/2 tsp. curry powder, pinch of cayenne, sprinkled red pepper flake, topped chicken breasts (2) with salt and cracked pepper, and then sprinkled parmesan over the top of the dish. Took an hour and a half.. should have added garlic

Really simple and good.  I had brown rice and cream of chicken soup in the house so I used those as substitutions, added a small can of sliced mushrooms; only other adjustment was I had to add 15 minutes to the cooking time since brown rice takes a bit longer to cook.  This is a great base recipe and can be tweaked w/ any number of additions.  It's a keeper.

I love this recepie, its easy, quick and a family pleaser. But i like to use cream of broccoli and add a little lemon juice, it gives it a nice kick. If you have room in the dish, add fresh peices of broccoli or other veggies and they will come out tender. Delicious, well-rounded meal!

I added some WildTree onion and garlic blend to this recipe and it tasted great! I did have to bake it for about 20 minutes longer than called for in the recipe - the rice was still crunchy at 45 minutes.

I though this would be a good dish for these cold winter days.  I followed the recipe but made a few changes.  I used 1 Cup of Chicken broth and 1/4 Cup of Milk.  I added fresh broccoli & mushrooms.  Sprinkled a little sea salt, fresh ground pepper and paprika on top, baked for 1 hour.  Very tasty, My Darling Husband approved!

Major disappointment. I only spiced up the chicken with a few more spices (onion powder, garlic powder, basil, oregano) and I added sauteed onions to the soup/rice part and a drained can of mushrooms. Even after an hour and a half, the rice was still crunchy and the chicken was still not cooked fully. My family would have loved it had it been cooked all the way through. At that, they had sandwiches. Mom made something like this when I was growing up but her rice always was cooked perfectly. How is it that mine wasn't, even after an hour and a half?

A great way to put together a quick meal.  I added some red pepper for heat.  The great thing about this is you can add different veggies to give it some variety and extra nutrition.

Simple as can be. I threw in some frozen mixed veggies and garlic powder and used milk rather than water. I had to cook mine for 15 minutes longer but it was soooo worth it. The chicken comes out moist and delicious everytime. This is my quick go-to meal. Any creamed soup works fab in this. Thanx Campbells kitchen:)

Very bland in my opinion. I used Cream of Mushroom soup and my husband and I didn't care for the way it came out. Needs extra seasonings.

It was kind of tricky on the rice portion of the recipe. So I cooked the rice first then I added everything to put in the oven. Very Good recipe for winter!!!

I tried this for the first time tonight. Rather than plain rice with paprika and pepper, I put in a box of Farmhouse Rice and the seasoning that came with it, omitted the paprika and put in pepper. Very flavorful with all the spices in the rice spice packet! It does have to bake for quite awhile in order for the rice to absorb the liquid - but worth the wait.

This was exactly what I expected.  It took 5 minutes to make from washing the chicken to popping it into the oven, and it tasted great.  I would add a little more seasoning, and possibly some broccoli.

I don't know what I did wrong but I cooked it for about an hour and a half and the rice still wasn't cooked and it was watery. It was really a disappointment because I had been looking forward to trying it. Any advice as to how bake it better would be really appreciated. I am willing to give it one more shot.

I added fresh mushrooms and used chicken broth instead of water. It took an additional 20 minutes for the rice to be done and the rice was ok but the chicken was blah and i even added garlic salt. Maybe i'll try it again but top the chicken with crused crackers and maybe some cheese at the end.

I liked it!  Needed a lazy way to get all of the food groups in.  I diced my chicken, and also added about 1.5-2 c frozen broccoli flowrets.  I didn't have paprika but used chili powder instead.  Surprisingly good and minimal effort :)

Recipe as written is very bland.   With the suggested changes by other reviewers it is awesome.   I mixed one can cream of mushroom, one cup water,  one spoon chicken base, one cup rice,  1/2 T Worcester sauce, 1/2 T minced onion, 1/2 garlic powder together.  Seasoned chicken breasts well,  then cut in strips and mixed in.  Baked at 375 for 40 minutes covered,  then set on counter for 5.  It was perfect.

I also browned some fresh mushrooms in butter and mixed them in about half way.

My mother raised us on this recipe, but instead of using paprika and pepper, she used dried onion soup mix sprinkled on the chicken.  After removing the chicken from the rice add some of the soup mix to the rice instead of salt.  it add a little oomph to the rice and chicken.

I added a few of my own favorite spices and used chicken breast strips and chicken broth instead of water. This dish was so yummy!!! I added a touch of garlic salt and seasoning salt before cooking. After baking 40 minutes I checked the rice and it was still a bit hard in the middle. I stirred it up (trying to scrape the bottom and not move the chicken too much) and baked another 10-15 minutes. Chicken came out moist and tasty, and all the rice was cooked. So YUMMY! I only wish I made more than the 4 servings!

I love chicken and rice and the key to this recipe is brushing your chicken breast with oil or butter then add  salt  and pepper ,onion powder and a little garlic powder ( I use the split breast),,cover with foil and bake until tender like 45-50 mins,,,then I uncover and I remove the breast from the juices and I  add 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and I use milk instead of water and I use a 1/2 can of cream of chicken   add the mixture to the broth from the baked chicken then I add minute rice stir it up then I add the chicken breast back in the dish and bake uncovered unti liquid is absorbed and rice is tender.... I remove the skin before serving,,,

This dish was a big hit. It was simple yet very tasty. I added chipotle pepper flakes, which gave it a smokey flavour and a bit of a bite.

I've made this a few times now, trying different variations.  So far the hit has been to use Cheddar Cheese soup instead of the Cream of Mushroom.  I also added in about 3/4 cup of shredded cheese and about 1/4 cup extra water.  It does come out a little bland, but I haven't figured out what to add to it yet to give it the right flavor, maybe worchestershire sauce?  Although, the last time I did it with the cheese soup & cheese, my husband had seconds - which he very rarely does, so it musn't have been too bland!

I chose to brown the chicken first and mix the wet ingredients in that pan (with additial spices) before placing them in the baking dish. I would also mix up the rice with a fork halfway through next time as there were some crunchy ones on top. Served with baby peas. Yum!

I prepared this ahead of time for my husband to cook  for the kids. It was good but a little bland. They topped it with grated Parmigiana. Definitely a fast meal for a busy night. A panko or breadcrumb topping would add much needed texture and flavor to this dish.

I did not have campbell's soup so I used a cup of Fage 0% greek yogurt instead and a chicken bouillon cube - I also added an extra cup of water and left the foil off. It came out perfect. The rice is soft and it had the perfect amount of moisture all around. I also used a cup of vegetable stock because I had some on-hand that I needed to use instead of 1 cup of water.

The only changes I made were, I used cream of celery soup because I didn't have cream of mushroom.  I used jasmine rice because it's our favorite (1 cup), added rosemary garlic seasoning blend and added some cheese in the last 5 minutes  of baking.  

The rice was perfectly sticky, and the chicken was tender and did not dry out at all.  My husband had seconds so I will definitely make this again!

My trash can thanks you. And I so appreciate the  "quick and easy" recipe that ended up wasting two hours of my time. Not to mention the money spent on the ingredients that should have been used to create something edible.

Increased rice and water amounts (will try chicken broth next time) & seasonings, but no major changes. Always a favorite "go to" when out of ideas to the "what to cook for dinner" question.

Here is the real trick to good chicken and rice I think.  Use 2 packages Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice.  Put rice in bottom and mix with 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1-3/4 cans of soup can water.  Mix 1 and 3/4 packages of the seasoning mix from the rice.  Put chicken on top and sprinkle with some crushed pepper corns, crushed sea salt and the rest of the seasoning mix. The wild rice mix makes a big difference.   Adjust the amount of chicken for a 9 x 13 inch pan.   Usually use boneless chicken thigh as they are even juicier.

I made this today & once before, but tweaked a few things. I used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of water. I also added garlic & onion powder, a dash of salt & a teaspoon of cumin & oregano in the soup & rice mixture,it gave it more flavor.

I love the recipe how it is, but my husband didn't care for it. So the second time I made this I doubled the rice used milk instead of water and used crm of chicken and crm of celery soup instead of crm of mushroom. I also added a bag of frozen broccoli and he loved it! Will be making this again.

Very quick dish, Not too much flavour. My rice was a bit undercooked in directly under the chicken but the rest of it was a bit over cooked.

I also substituted 3/4 c. milk and 1/4 c. chicken broth for the water like others had.  I had to cook it for about 65 minutes.    Me: "It doesn't look like the recipe my mom used, but it still looks good." Hubby: "WOW."  It's a keeper!  So yummy!!!

My wife asked me what I wanted to eat one day when I was working late. "How about the chicken and rice bake?" I said. A 30 minute driver later I was pulling in whilst my wife was pulling dinner out of the oven. She said it was unbelievably easy to put together and is now on our list of quick fix/in a pinch dinners.

It tasted okay. But it was really watery when I made it. But that might have been my mistake because I used brown rice because that is what I had on hand. I also used milk instead of water. But all in all, it was okay.

I probably should have read the reviews first, but overall, turned out well. Main thing I would have changed would have been the water to rice ratio; either less water or more rice. Added a few extra spices before I put it in the oven and put soy sauce on all of it when it came out, helped a lot flavour-wise

It would be fine if the rice finished cooking. I gave it a whole extra half hour in the oven but the rice was still a little gritty so I had to pull the chicken off & finish the rice in the microwave.  It took an extra 10 min in the microwave.  Once everything was cooked it was ok, but I won't attempt this again. It's not worth the headache.

As a follower not a leader I spiffed up this dish as did others. Chicken stock, paprika, garlic salt, onion flakes, pepper, salt, fresh broccoli, with the mushroom soup and a sprinkle of parsley on the chicken. One hour, covered with foil at 375, then cover off for five minutes......outstanding, with a nice Cabernet!!

This is my go-to dinner recipe for something simple to prep that is delicious.
I always use 1 cup of rice, 1/4 cup of water, and 1 can (10.7oz) of chicken broth. Always turns out tender, flavorful, and my kids actually eat it.

This is the third time I've made this recipe. It gets five stars because it's quick, easy and very versatile. Once I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used a jar of Alfredo  sauce that I had on hand. I always season chicken before I cook it, and I add Worcestershire sauce to everything. To make it a one dish dinner, I add a frozen vegetable mix which also livens up the rice.  My son eats seconds and takes leftovers for lunch the next day. It's a keeper!

This dish is so boring as written, which is a real shame. I like to use cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup, cut the rice to 1/2 cup (only 2 people in my house), but leave the water the same. Then I also add chopped celery, carrots and onions, Italian seasonings and season the chicken with a pre-blended spice mix. This makes it more of a meal and adds a lot of flavor while making the rice creamier.

Subbed water with chicken stock, added turmeric, curry powder, and chopped kale to the rice.   Seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, turmeric, and curry.  Bumped rice to 1 cup.  Chicken was done after 45 minutes, but the rice needed to cook a little longer.   Super easy base dish, that is easily customized with different seasonings or vegetables.

I made modifications the second time I cooked this that worked well.  I added 1 tbsp of soy sauce to the rice and used a rub for the chicken made from 1 tsp Lawry’s, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp paprika, and a little black pepper left over from what I had ground for the rice.  I seasoned the chicken, put it in the pan, and sprinkled the rice with the remaining seasoning, although I still threw out a pinch or two of seasoning.  These were all modifications of Monica Keiffer’s modifications.  I used bone in chicken thighs instead of breasts, so maybe that is why Monica’s rub made the dish way too salty for me.

This was the first recipe I made in my new 18 quart (large) roaster. I preheat the roaster.  I used (3) large cans Cream of mushroom soup, (6) C. Water, 4 1/2-5 C. uncooked  White rice (mixed together right in the bottom of the roaster.) Then I pounded a Family Size package of Chicken breasts and put on top of the rice mixture. After which, I sprinkled with lots of black pepper and paprika. Cooked on  375° for just over 45mins. It was moist and delicious! So much better than in the oven! I plan to always make it this way from now on!

Super great recipe for quick prep and easy dinner. 
The recipe does not call for salt, but I would highly recommend adding salt! The rice and chicken were quite bland without it. 
Also, I added approx 1/4 tsp of rubbed sage, an additional 1/2 c water and 1/2 c rice, and two cans of green beans. The veggie addition worked fabulously in the one dish bake!

Covered it like it said and it slowed the cook. So I scrapped the foil and had to cook for 30 extra minutes. Next time will cook without foil. I also added salt, bay leaves, garlic and onion powder. I used cream of chicken and mushroom instead of just mushroom. Added a lovely extra boost of flavor.

I made this with pheasant breasts.  I also used brown rice instead of white rice.  I sprinkled a package of onion soup across the top before baking at 375 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.  Really good.

I like the  one-dish idea, but it's a little bland. Here's how to make it more flavorful: up it to 1-1/3 cup of rice, eliminate the water and add 1/3 cup of wine, and either 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, or 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of celery soup. Mix the soups and wine and pour half the mixture on top of the rice (really soak the rice so it cooks well), place the chicken in the dish, pour the other half of the soup/wine mixture on top of the chicken, then top it off with a package of dry Lipton's onion soup. Bake one hour, and delish!

I made changes to the original recipe because it needed more flavor. I added chicken broth instead of water and upped the  amount of seasonings plus added garlic powder.  I chopped the chicken into chunks and it was delicious!  I only gave it 4 stars because the original recipe was a little bland.  Good, but bland.  With the changes it is a 5 star recipe.

My mother used to make something similar to this.  I wouldn't say this is the exact recipe my mother used, but it's close.  

I took the advice of a few other reviewers and used chicken broth, as opposed to water, and it seemed to add a lot of flavor.  I also chopped up some onion, and used some chopped broccoli, just for some extra flavor.  Both seemed to work well in the dish.  I left out the paprika, because I don't like the stuff.  Still tasted fine.  

One thing I did do was to heat the broth in a saucepan, add the mushroom soup and pepper, and let it simmer for a few minutes, then added it to the rice mixture.  I'm not sure that would make the recipe any different than just adding all that into the baking dish.  I just thought it would be easier to do it that way.

I give up....First time making this dish I followed the recipe and it was boring. Plus it took way longer to cook the rice but then the chicken was over done. I decided to give it another try thinking I must have done something wrong. On my second try I added some seasonings and used less soup. It tasted a little bit better but it came out too mushy for me and my family. I’ll stick with cooking chicken and rice separately.

This was supposed to cook in 45 minutes, but when I checked my dish there was WAY too much liquid. Increase baking time to an hour and increase the amount of rice to 1c. I won't make this again.

boring.  Took way longer than 45 to cook, chicken was still bleeding and needed an extra 20 min at 400 to be done.  Lacked flavour.

I made this for the first time today and I read a few reviews on the recipe before making it and so I did make a few changes and it turned out very, very tasty.   I used 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth (I use Knorr's little tub dissolved in boiling water which has a really nice flavor) with 1 full cup of rinsed, long grain white and arborio rice, mixed.  When the chicken bouillon  was dissolved , I moved 1 1/2 cups of the broth into a 4 cup measuring cup and put the rinsed rise into the hot water and bouillon to start it cooking while I prepared the chicken.  Some said that they found this recipe bland so, to the rinsed and dried chicken breasts (medium sized), I used the following spices: a sprinkling of sea salt and black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder on both sides and celery seed just on one side.  I did not use paprika as I find it over-powers the other flavors.  To the top side of the chicken breasts, I added just a light smear of unsalted butter.  I then added the can of mushroom soup to the broth/rice mixture and stirred it well until it was all smoothly mixed and then added about two cups of frozen broccoli florets and mixed them in.  I was making this just for the two of us so I used two chicken breasts and the two cups of broccoli florets.  The rest of the recipe measurements works for four chicken breasts and servings as well.  I poured the rice mixture into the bottom of a lightly buttered two quart casserole dish and placed the seasoned chicken breasts on top w

okay can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong? I did the can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and I subbed the water for chicken broth, then I added some extra spices to give it more flavor. it's now been covered in the oven for 45 minutes and the rice is still crunchy! it's 8 in the evening and my family would like to eat dinner, but now I have to leave it cooking for another 30 minutes! I don't understand how others came out perfect and mine is not?

This was O K for a quick meal but the race got a bit mushy for me.   I followed the recipe except I added a bullion cub with the water. and a chopped red pepper.  I may have added too much liquid but  I took the lid off and cooked it ten extra minutes which reduced the liquid.  Probably will not make again.

I made this using Cream of Chicken because I don't like Cream of Mushroom. I also used Dirty Rice Mix and added seasonings. This had a lot of flavor and tasted great.

Definitely good, but changed a lot of things based off of other reviews and personal preference. Used 1 c. of rice, and just over a cup of chicken broth instead of water. Also added 1 Tbs. of Worcester sauce as recommended by Monica in the comments, and it was a nice touch. Sprinkled extra spices on top of the chicken breasts once they were in the dish (seasoning salt, garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, and pepper) and covered/baked for over an  hour at 375. (Took it out at 45 min and the chicken was still raw. stirred rice around a little under the chicken and bake about 10 min uncovered, then stirred the rice around a bit more, covered, and baked an additional 10ish minutes! Come out a bit mushy, but the chicken was delicious, and the rice texture was fine when combined with bites of chicken.

took in a few of the suggestions mentioned by previous reviews: substituted using chicken stock, added a bunch of spices including garlic powder, garam masala (which i feel makes this dish really flavorful), increased to 1 cup of rice, and used cream of chicken. put in the oven for an hour, and woo! completely cooked. the chicken was slightly dry,and the rice under the chicken was mushy, but i think that's minor after mixing the rice completely because it's barely noticeable. the only "crunchy" rice was the rice stuck on the sides of my dish (but still cooked!). 

i definitely feel this recipe gives permission to play around with flavoring.

This was very good, but after reading reviews, I altered it a bit. Mixed together 1 cup of white rice, can of cream of mushroom soup, can of mushrooms, 1 cup of chicken stock, 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, ½ teas of poultry seasoning, ½ teas of Lawrys salt, ½ teas of Mural of Flavor, pepper. Put in buttered pan, put chicken breasts on top, seasoned with garlic powder and pepper. Next time add another ½ cup of chicken stock. Check the chicken after 35 minutes.

I used chicken broth instead of water and I was amazed by the results! I also threw in some celery for crunch and added celery salt, onion powder, and a bit of granulated garlic in the rice mixture and on top of the chicken. I finished it with parsley and mozzarella on top of the chicken. Delicious!

I followed the instructions for this recipe and was not happy. I got under cooked rice. The chicken did turn out fine but, I added a little extra time. I like the combination of flavors in this recipe so I'll try again using some of the other cooks suggestions.

I went heavy on everything!  1 cup of stock, 1 cup of jasmine rice (it's what I had), 1/2 tsp of paprika & ground pepper, 1/8 tsp of garlic salt.  I seared the chicken breasts in grape seed oil after seasoning with season salt and black pepper.  Added coarsely chopped carrots, celery, & a medium yellow onion.  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes and pulled the chicken then another 8-10 minutes for rice/veggies to soften a little more.  Easy recipe to experiment and I felt like the muppet's Swedish chef making a big 'ol mess!

This is one of my family's favorite dishes! It was a little bland the first time I made it, so I tweaked it a little by rubbing the chicken breasts with olive oil, garlic powder, seasoned salt and an all seasoning like Mrs. Dash before placing them in the rice mixture. If I cook more than 4 breasts, I let it cook a little longer (about 7-10 min.) and I'll add a little more rice and water too.

I thought this dish was really tasty.  I used 1 cup of brown rice with 1 cup chicken broth, smoky paprika, pepper & about 2 teaspoons fresh chopped garlic.  I used 3 chicken thighs instead of breasts because that is what I had.  I cooked it for 45 minutes, then checked it to see if there was enough moisture which I decided there was.  I then topped it with French Fried Onion Rings and cooked it another 15 minutes as I thought the chicken was still a bit pink.  It got rave reviews from my family and was all eaten.  The brown rice had a flavor similar to bulgur.  I may add another 2 tablespoons of liquid next time.

This was one of the worst meals I have ever prepared.  I followed the directions except that I substituted chicken broth for water.  It had to cook a LOT longer than 45 minutes.  In fact, I cooked it for an extra hour as at 45 minutes, it was like soup.  The rice mixture was a mushy concoction of yuk.  The chicken was next to flavorless.  Needless to say, my husband gave it a big thumbs down and asked that I NEVER prepare this again!

I made this recipe three times.  
The first time I made it exactly as the recipe asked of me, and it was pretty good bu t the creaminess of the mushroom soup mix made it too creamy and wet and just spongy where the rice was concerned.  
The second time I made it with a package of onion soup mix, and it was too salty and too much onion flavor. I couldn't find the chicken in the flavor.
The third time, today, it came out GREAT! I used a 16 ounce can of chicken soup broth, upped the rice to 1 cup and 5 chicken thighs, bone in, in an 8x8x2 (brownie) glass dish at 375 *F for 1 hour. I added also diced green california (ortega) chiles; 2 T juice and 2 T diced chiles strewn on top of the chicken rice mixture and baked it from there. It is gorgeous, not salty, rice light and fluffy and the all around flavor of the rice is beautiful.

I took the advice of a few other reviews to add extra liquid to this dish.  Unfortunately, it came out a bit more dry than I had hoped and not creamy by any means.  If I hadn't added the extra liquid, I think this dish may have actually come out completely dry.

This is quick, easy, and filling comfort food.  I like to add a cube of chicken bouillon,  minced onion, and curry powder to help season.  Some mushrooms and peas make a great addition to the rice mix.  If I have a little shredded cheese to use up, I'll add that to the top of the chicken.  My hubby gobbles this up without complaint, and he doesn't even like mushrooms.

For those saying the rice was not cooked enough, I use minute rice and it comes out perfect EVERY time. I also don't use measurements.. put in enough rice to cover bottom  of pan, add mushroom soup with 1/2 can water 1/2 can milk. Stir and see what the consistency is. If it's too watery, add more rice to a little bit thicker soup like consistency.. too thick, add more liquid. You don't want it too thick though or it will come out dry. I also add my own seasonings to the rice mixture and broccoli. And make sure you cover the pan with foil while baking.

We liked it! Made it as a side dish w/o the chicken. Used the soup, 1C shredded cheese, 1/2 head broccoli, 1C of jasmine rice, 2C chicken broth, pepper, paprika, poured it in 7x11" pyrex cooked for  35min.

The rice was fine but a bit bland.  The chicken was way over cooked.

This recipe is pretty good.  I did edit it a bit.  I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, and I added mixed veggies.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it, and I plan to make it again, maybe adding more seasoning next time.

This is a good base recipe. I added curry, garlic, cumin a touch of red pepper, cream and some other spices and half a package of frozen mixed vegetables. Don't  be afraid to experiment with this recipe and add weird things.. (like curry, saffron and raisins. .. not kidding,  delish)

I was looking for a chicken casserole and came across this recipe. It is super easy and quick to make, my family really liked the flavors and I loved the easy cleanup. I will definitely be making this dish again.

Following other reviews...I seasoned the rice and chicken quite a bit more than called for. Doubled the recipe..!1 1/2 c. rice..one can mushroom & 1 crm of chicken...added a microwaved cup of water w/1 chicken & 1veg. bouillon cube dissolved. Then the other 1 + 2/3 c. water...abt. 2 tbsp. butter...seasoned the rice & chicken further w/ onion powder, a bit of garlic powder, salt & pepper w/a touch of oregano on the chicken before putting  it in w/the rice....took longer to cook...covered for 45 @ 375...then uncovered & stirred for another 15 minutes @ 350. Also, added some microwaved frozen mixed veg's to the rice mixture...just 'cos I wanted everything in one dish...allot of changes, I know! But the basic idea is good to tweak up however you like!! Thanks for the idea!!

I added dried minced onion (to taste) and used 2% milk instead of water. I only used 2 large chicken breasts but I do make it with more chicken when there are more to feed than just my hubby and myself. Yes I will make again, this is one of our favorite comfort foods.

I substituted Asian calrose rice and add grated cheddar cheese to the top of everything 5 minutes before I remove it from the oven and it turns out delicious! I agree that it might be a little less flavorful without my tweeks, but overall a good basic recipe to go off of!

Needed a recipe for what I had in the pantry ... this was perfect.  Used chicken legs, added some chopped onions and used cream of mushroom and chicken. Chicken was tender and rice was moist.  Next time I will add salt to the rice mixture.  It was really good and I will definitely cook this again.  Quick and easy!

This is a family favorite one dish recipe. However, it is a little bland,  I usually omit the paprika add 1/2 of an onion soup mix packet instead. Gives it a lot of flavor.  I also upped the rice to 1 cup. I also usually cut the chicken breasts in half, or use chicken tenders. I have also used theighs or drumsticks if that was all I had and cut the meat off the bone when it was done and mixed it all together. Great dish!

I personally like switching this up with either cream of chicken or celery instead of cream of mushroom for additional flavor.  A good way to make sure the chicken and rice turns out perfect every time, though, I've found, is if you cover your baking dish with tinfoil for the first 35 or so minutes and uncover for the last 10 to cook off the remaining moisture.  This keeps the chicken moist and tender and cooks the rice better.  Total comfort dish that is so easy on a work night.

Simple,  easy,  delicious.  I do sub the Campbell's cream of mushroom with Pacific Organic cream of mushroom.  Have you seen the ingredients in the Campbell's?? No, thanks! I usually need to go 60 mins for soft rice,  but it's not a big deal. This is in our regular rotation.

I took some tips from some reviewers and followed my own tastes and it came out really great! 
I:
-used cream of chicken soup
-used 1 cup rice, and boiled rice for 10 minutes in chicken bullion water and strained in a fine mesh strainer before putting it in the dish
-used 1/2 chopped onion and 1 stalk celery, which I sauteed in some olive oil while the rice was cooking, then added to the rice
-used 3/4 cup chicken broth (bullion in my case) and 1/4 cup milk
-added a nice sprinkling of garlic powder and celery salt, a large pinch of onion powder, and a bit of cumin, and some pepper to the soup mix
-seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning, pepper, and paprika
-covered with foil, took about an hour (but my chicken was partially frozen, if thawed will probably cook faster) and took the foil off the last 15 minutes to let juices from chicken evaporate off
-at the end of cooking time, added a sprinkling of cheese on top and some dry parsley

Chicken was moist, rice was done, it wasn't watery but creamy! Will make again :)

I followed the recipe exactly as it was and it turned out great! I did add half a package of dry onion soup mix to the top of the chicken to add more flavor and it tasted awesome! I used Minute rice and had no issues with undercooked or overlooked rice. Will definitely make again!

I rated this 5 stars after taking Monte's suggestion. Also I used cut up chicken beasts and just stirred it all together. Our family was getting over a tummy bug and this was just the type of comfort/ gentle food we needed but with the modifications it wasn't bland or boring.

Tasted wonderful, however I did alter the recipe some. I used 1 1/2cups of chicken broth, instead of water. I also added garlic powder, onion powder, and I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. My only problem was that the rice could have been more cooked (and that was with adding extra broth.) My family loved it though, and ate every bit of it! No leftovers! Which is a miracle with my brood of picky eaters. I will make it again!

Made this tonight for dinner - Delish! Family loved it. 
Used 4 skinless boneless chicken breast 
1 tin of mushroom soup
Instead of water I used 1 cup of milk 
and I added a little bit more rice (1cup) 
Added pepper no paprika
And then I added some franks red hot sauce, not much but enough to taste it a bit. 
Cooked it for 50 minutes covered with tin foil and then for 5 minutes after I broiled it. 
Was very good. Next time will add 1/2 tin more of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup more of milk and another cup of rice as there was not enough rice. 

Will 100% make this again.

I always love this dish. It's one all of my kids will actually eat and they request it. I don't like mushrooms personally, so I use cream of chicken soup instead. And I flatten the chicken breasts a little to make sure they will cook evenly. Never had to adjust the time or temp and turns out great. Just make sure you pre-heat the oven.

My husband and I loved it! I followed the recipe as it says and it turned out great! The chicken came out moist and tender. The rice was good. Overall, we thought it had the right amount of seasonings. I did use the extra amount of water it suggested to make it creamier, which turned out fine. Next time I might use chicken broth or milk instead of water to see how it turns out as others have suggested; or even add some frozen vegetables. But this recipe turned out fine as is.

I changed a few things...3/4 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup milk instead of water, added a ranch dressing mix packet, 2-3 splashes of Frank's Red Hot sauce, and generously coated chicken with paprika and black pepper...it turned out delicious and spicy :)

I agree with the people who used the chicken broth instead of water. We also substitute a steak seasoning instead of the paprika. Good easy recipe.

This recipe was great. The only thing is that you do have to add some salt to it.
