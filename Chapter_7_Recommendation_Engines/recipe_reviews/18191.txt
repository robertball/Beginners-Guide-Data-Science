Although I followed the baking instructions and only baked them for 60 minutes, they burned on the bottom.  I had successfully tried the Peppermint Meringues from this website the day before, but they cooked at a lower temperature, 225 deg. for 90 minutes.  The cardamom flavor was extremely subtle, hardly discernable. The meringues were an unattractive brown shade due to the cardamom.

Very light dessert and easy to make.  I used splenda instead of sugar and it was a little too sweet.  I love cardamom, but I have to admit that I'm not really sure it went well in this recipe.  I think almond extract would probably go better.  I used an airbake sheet and a silicone mat and had beautiful golden crisp meringues in about 75 minutes at 285 degrees (my oven runs a little cool).  The texture was light and wonderful.  It would make an excellent base for a layered fruit and cream dessert or to make a bowl or base for ice cream, although I would definitely decrease the sugar.  The texture was less of a meringue and more of a light airy biscuit.

I followed the recipe just before the part where the cardamom is added, but instead of the cardamom I used 3/4 tsp ground cloves because I love cloves. I also adjusted the oven temp to 250 when I noticed the cookies were beginning to crack, and leaving them in for only an hour cooked them completely. While I was beating the egg whites I never did get really stiff peaks, so I tried adding 1/8 tsp cream of tartar in the hopes it would set up better, but it must have been really humid in my house because the most they could muster was a little stiffer than a soft peak, which made the cookies flat like medallions instead of pointy like kisses. They still tasted great (gourmet, even!), but next time I think I'll only add 1/2 tsp cloves because 3/4 tsp gives the cookies a little too much bite.

These were interesting.  I guess I don't like cardamom enough to have it as a main flavor of anything.  I'm used to cooking with it in asian/Indian dishes, used as a flavor enhancer.  But I guess you can use any flavoring (mint, amaretto) and get great mereingues from it.  Great for a low-carb snack if you have to prepare one for a pot-luck or something.

My family just didn't care for the cardamom flavoring. They said the cookies reminded them of the taste of bratwurst!

These cookies were quick to prepare, easy to make, and fabulous!  I had no problems with stickiness, although one batch was fluffier than the other.
I used chocolate chips and dried cranberries for a unique flavor.

I was so excited about this recipe, but the kids wouldn't even try them,and my husband didn't care for them. So I took them over to the inlaws, who said they tasted medicinal. I guess they're not my cup of tea!

My husband is Iranian, and cardamon is a common spice among their recipes.  We loved them specially with Chay (hot Iranian tea). Thank you!

These actually are the first meringue I've ever made that turned out. Maybe it's because I live in FL and it's usually very humid. I will definitely make these again. Next time I will use super-fine sugar, as mine were a little gritty. Also I learned that it's best to whip the egg whites to soft peaks before adding the sugar. I left them to cool in the oven, after baking for 1hour, and they were solid throughout.

I liked the smell of the cardamom, so was hopeful about this adventure  I would give it NO stars, but my friends gave it an "Interesting... like eating perfume" and would not let me throw them away.

I had never eaten a merainge before this.  I chose the recipe because it does not call for egg yolks or any oil.  I think I overdid it on the cardamon..but more than anything I think I am just not a merainge fan.  The kids claimed they did not like them, but kept munching on them.  Maybe I will try a different flavor next time.

Very easy.  Pretty good. 
However, on humid days I have had to bake it 2 hours or slightly more.
Using parchment paper or  non stick pan liners keep it from sticking.  
Always let it cool a bit before peeling off the paper or liner.

I love cardamom, but this recipe calls for too much.  The taste was overpowering.  I will probably make these again, but reduce the amount to 1/2 teaspoon or less.

The cardamom made this cookie taste gourmet! I didn't cook it long enough because appeared to be darkened, but that was the spice that made it look dark.

I reduced sugar to 2/3 cup, reduced cardamom to 1/2 tsp, added a few drops of orange extract to the meringue and zested orange over the tops before baking. I love cardamom but think it's better with something complementary like citrus. I live at high elevation in a dry climate. Parchment paper worked great, my silpat liner did not work -- held onto moisture and made the bottoms sticky. Baked at 250 for 60 minutes, turned off oven and left them inside to fully dry overnight. Those on parchment paper were fantastic. Will make again.

These were delicious! But they're not for everyone.  At first I though the cardamom was a bit strong, but then they became addictive. Great with tea.  My favorite combination was with a Rose Pouchong tea.  This has inspired me to try more adventurous flavors of meringues.

Unfortunately without a real mixer (besides mixing by hand with a whisk or using my food processor) I wasn't able to get the peaks needed and they stayed runny. Tried twice and threw out the mix both times. Next time I will have to buy a mixer!

Loved this recipe but added 3/4 teaspoon vanilla instead of the cardamon. Easy to substitute a favorite spice as other reviews suggested.  I made these for Halloween adding chocolate chips for "eyes" after baking.  Each little "ghost" had its own special features with cracks looking like a mouth! I made each meringue with a heaping tablespoon.  Baked at 275* for 60 minutes.  A light, tasty treat with lots of possibilities.  I had one that ended up looking like a Christmas tree, h-m-m..... think I'll add some green food coloring!

I love, love, love cardamom...but I just don't know about it in a meringue.  Also, the granular sugar gave them a little bit of a grainy appearance.  I did cook them at 225 for 90 minutes then just left them to cool in the oven, and they were cooked perfectly.  I just can't decide if I really like them or not.  If you love cardamom, try them, maybe you'll like them more than me.
