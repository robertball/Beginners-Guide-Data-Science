It's not good, it's not bad. But what makes this dish filipino? 
I've seen this dish prepared before a lot of other times by people who weren't filipino and there aren't any traditionally filipino methods or ingredients.
Isn't this just a plain old macaroni salad?

I had quite a lot of rotisserie chicken leftover and decided to give this a try. My Filipino DH was delighted.  We loved it.  I added a few sliced white seedless grapes and a handful of chopped walnuts. Excellent cold dish on these hot summer days.  Thank you!

This was pretty good.  It definately brought me back to my childhood, reminding me of all the BBQ's and Filipino parties that my mom used to take me to.  The reason that I only gave this 4 stars is that my mom's was better.  She used to use a lot more macaroni and she didn't use apples or raisins.  I felt like 2 boxes of raisins was too much.  Also, my mom used to shred the carrots instead of dicing them and I think she added diced boiled egg. It tasted pretty sweet too, with all the fruit,  so I wouldn't add the sugar next time.

Not sure if this is the same chicken salad as was made for me by a co-worker (many years ago), She no longer works with me and I never got a chance to ask for the recipe but IF this is in fact the same salad then it's absolutely delicious and I happen to NOT be a fan of chicken salad for whatever reason.  I will make a small amount of this to get my answer.  Also there was no apple in the salad but I definitely remember the pineapple, and the salad being on the sweet and savory side.  She also had some really soft slider buns to go with it.  Will definitely try this

I worked with a nurse from the Philippines. She used to make this for us quite often. We loved it! She cooked the carrots just a bit but they were still crisp. She also added a touch of ginger that added that tropical exotic flavor. Delicious!
