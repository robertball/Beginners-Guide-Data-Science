Oreos worked really good here too. I also sometimes just dip the bottoms in the cookies and it gives a nice presentation. A trick I use is to dip my apple in the caramel then drizzle it with the dark and white chocolates. I let that set for a few minutes while I dip several apples. I let them set up on a cookie cooling rack with a cookie pan (covered in foil) underneath to catch the drippings. Then I re dip just the bottoms of the apples in the caramel and then cookie crumbs. It gives a great presentation and looks very pretty when wrapped in clear cellophane tied with a ribbon or raffia.

 Update... I also wanted to mention That the apples are usually dipped in boiling water for a few seconds to remove the wax, right? Well, since I make these every year I do something a little different to remove the wax now. I open a new "Scotch" scrub sponge and scrub the apple under hot running water. Apples dropped in the boiling water tend to discolor a little. The taste isn't altered, but I just didn't like that discoloration. The scrub sponge works great!!

Nice combination! Especially if you like sweeter peanut butters or peanut butter cookies in general. Healthier to eat them with a crunchy apple!

In the end you get a delicious treat. However the picture is very misleading. The only way you can posible make yours look like the picture is if you make sure and have the cookies ready before you melt the carmel, and then work extreamly fast. Otherwise the carmel sets up and the cookies don't stick. In the end I mixed THe cookies in the carmel and then dipped in the apples. It tasted good, but not what I expected.

we made this for a pile of teenagers. Instead of doing the apples whole, however, we cored and sliced the apples and then drizzled the caramel and chocolate on them then added the rest of the ingredients. Was a MAJOR hit for all ages!

These were very easy to make and tasted great.  They do need to stay refrigerated or the caramel gets droopy.  I used Pepridge Farms brussles cookies instead, and they tasted GREAT!

I cheated and used caramel sauce and heated it to make it softer. Definitely clean the wax from the apples and have everything ready in a prep line to ease the process. I also used crushed butterfingers as the topping then put them in the slots on a cookie rack to set (put foil or wax paper underneath to catch the drippings). My husband can't wait to gobble them down!
