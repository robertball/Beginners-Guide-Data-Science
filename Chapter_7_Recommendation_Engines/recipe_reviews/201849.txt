Delicious!! But way too sweet. What I did the second time was to simply add tablespoons of the brown sugar until I found the right balance between the sweet and salty. Two tablespoons were enough for me.

I'd give it more stars if I could.  I diced the beef into 1/2 inch pieces and added frozen broccoli, then simmerred it for about 10 minutes at the end.  It was better than the finest Chinese/Mongolian restaurant in town.  My 2 yr old hates veggies and she gobbled this dish up and cleaned the plate.

This is very good!  I've made it a few times now and have lived, learned and experimented.  The original recipe is too sweet for me and it didn't have quite the right flavor I was looking for.  Here's what I've done.

1.  I always serve over Jasmine rice, so I make sure I start this first so it will be done at the same time as the beef.

2.  After prepping my ingredients, I start a pot on medium/high heat with the 1 cup of oil at the same time as the 10 minute wait for the beef.  I use a separate pan for the sauce and heat that as well.

3.  Once the pan is ready, toss in the garlic and ginger and be sure you don't burn the garlic.  It will make your dish bitter.  Have your soy/water/sugar mix all ready to throw in there to stop the garlic from burning. 

4.  Since it was too sweet for me, I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup packed and added 2 tbs of Hoisin Sauce (you can buy this is the asian food section next to the soy).

5.  By the time 10 minutes is up, the oil is ready in the pot.  I use the slotted spoon to drop the beef in so I don't get burned by the hot oil.  Do NOT overcook the beef or it will be too tough.  2 minutes is plenty of time.

6.  Drain the beef and add it to the sauce.  I wait until the end to add the green onions because they don't need long to cook and I like them to keep their color.

7.  I serve over the rice and with a side of fresh mandarin oranges.

Thanks for sharing!!

Ive tried this a lot of times with my family with fresh ginger and powdered ginger with green onions and white onions what I have found is this tastes really good one thing I have changed is that I always double or triple the meat that is the only thing i change some people have complained that it is to salty or sweet I suggest do not make changes to the sauce just add more meat and some more veggies if you want veggies that is also do not cut the meat to thin and some of you might try to tenderize the meat before hand  this may solve your problems with the tough meat if anything cut the sauce in half for 1 pd of meat that should help and keep the sauce nice and thick just be sure to let it set for a few minute before serving.

This was excellent, but make sure you have a splash cover for your pan and if u have thin sliced steak like I did, only fry the meat for about 10secs and turn. Since you saute with the sauce later, it fully cooks, but won't turn into beef jerky. Also, I added a Tbsp of cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce. This is the tastiest Mongolian Beef I've ever eaten, and I used to love P.F. Chang's version!

Easy to make and flavorful.  I do suggest putting the beef in the starch before you saute the galic/ginger to better manage time.  Also, was a bit salty, maybe use low sodium soy sauce or cut a bit of soy and  replace with water.

VERY good.  Did cut back on the soy.  Made it for husband, husband ate it, husband loved it!  'Nuff said.
12.27.09 - Have to update this one.  This is now a standard at my house.  SO simple and versatile.  I can make any meat Mongolian now!  This is the recipe I have been looking for for years.

My family loved this recipe, but it may have helped that the quality of the meat we got was excellent.  I didn't fry the meat in as much oil as called for, so it didn't turn out crispy, but it was still great.  I added broccoli, bell peppers, and an orange at the end.  It was great!  My family suggested that it needed a bit more tang.  Next time, I'll add a little rice wine vinegar.  Oh, I also cut down on the sugar, per others' recommendation.  Overall, we enjoyed this dish very much.  Thanks!

Best stir fry I ever made. I modified slightly to make it less fussy. I started by browning the coated beef in 1 tbls of oil until crispy as directed, then added the garlic/ginger for a couple of minutes, then added the sauce ingredients a little at a time until it reached the desired consistency and taste for me. I used about 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup water, 2 tbls of Hoisin sauce, 2 tbls of brown sugar. Then I added broccoli until crisp tender and lastly the green onion for a couple of minutes. Delicious!

This recipe is WONDERFUL! Although it has several steps it was well worth it! My husband and I loved it and it tasted very similar to the mongolian beef from our favorite chinese restaurant.

WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN

I made this recipe pretty much as written, as far as amounts go. I used some different variations on a couple of items. I used reduced-sodium soy sauce, I'm glad I did.  I used a natural form of sugar called sucanat instead of brown sugar and used  London Broil steak instead of flank steak. I tripled the recipe and it took me three times as long to make too. :-) My family loved it though. One commented that it tasted a lot like a Pei Wei dish. That's compliment enough I think.  If I were to change anything next time, I might tenderize my meat beforehand; although it was mostly quite tender. If I made this for company, I think I could make the sauce and fry the meat earlier in the day and keep in the fridge. Then it wouldn't take long to complete the final steps of chopping the onions and mixing it all together in the end.  This way I could clean up the big frying mess on the stove ahead of time. All in all, it was a big success.

We made this last night, and although I told my boyfriend about the recommendations re the sugar he followed the recipe recommendations. We also added fresh broccoli and hoisin sauce. For me it was way, way, way to sweet and almost ruined it for me, but my boyfriend didn't think so, which seems to follow the differing opinions in all the reviews. He did agree he would be ok with reducing the sugar next time. I think we also will eliminate the broccoli and add grated carrots. We used pre-cut "stir fry beef" from the grocery store and it worked great. We also use Bragg's in lieu of soy which cuts down on the sodium.
I do recommend cutting back the sugar at least a bit, but understand some people may like it sweet. All in all, a great recipe once it has been tweaked to personal taste!

I used light brown sugar (the full amount) and top round instead of flank steak. I had a bit more than a pound of meat (1.3) but the amount of sauce was still good. We loved the dish. It tastes authentic and it was easy to prepare. I served it over brown rice and topped with some fried rice noodles.

I had my mouth all set for Mongolian Beef that tastes just like PF Chang's. This isn't it. It wasn't bad, but it lacked the full flavor of Chang's. The only thing I changed was to cut back the 2/3 cup of sugar to 1/3 cup. I doubt that made the taste difference. I would suggest cutting the meat thinner than 1/4" also. That was too thick and resulted in the meat being a little tough. I thought two bunches of onions was too much. I don't think I'll make it again.

Using low-sodium soy sauce and reducing the brown sugar to 1/4, there wasn't the "too salty" and "too sweet" problems that others mentioned. I added broccoli and arsenic-free Jasmine rice. This was excellent!

This was great - the flavor was just like takeout!  I increased to 6 servings and only used 1/2 if the sugar.  I also only had ground ginger but it was still good - even better the next day.  really easy to make also - next time I am going to add some chinese hot pepper for some spice.   This is a keeper

This was an incredibly flavorful recipe that used ingredients I already had on hand. I found a flank steak from last July hiding in the back of my freezer, and while perfectly safe to eat, it was a bit freezer burned and I feared it would be tough if we grilled it, so I decided to try it in this recipe. We had a piece of ginger root left from a previous meal, as well as some green onions. Per previous reviewers suggestions I cut down the brown sugar (to 1/4 cup) and added a couple of tablespoons of rice wine vinegar to the sauce as well a some corn starch at the very end to thicken things up. I only used 1/4 of vegetable oil and it came out just fine, nice a crispy. I use Bragg's Aminos instead of soy sauce and did so here as well. This was a terrific recipe and easier to prepare than it looked -- this will likely become a go-to beef meal!

This is a very good base for Mongolian beef.  I slice the beef thinner and fry less time as another rater mentioned as well.  For a "Szechuan" kick I have made this adding red dried peppers.  Yummy!  As for the PF Chang's comments,  those who think they are the best are going to the wrong Asian restaurants!

Combined a couple of cook's previous comments and experiences.  Used only 2 Tbsp brown sugar.  While prepping everything - let meat sit in cornstarch.  Since everyone said it was too salty - used 1/4 c soy sauce and 1/4 cup teriyaki.  There were no leftovers between just me and my husband  :)

I thought I liked Super spicy mongolian beef until tonight. This recipe comes together more quickly and the flavors meld together well. I did add red pepper flakes to taste and I doubled the recipe only because there are no small eaters in this house.

Loved this!!  Just like at a restaurant.  Like others, I used less brown sugar and added steamed broccoli at the last minute.  Served over sticky rice.  Definitely a keeper; easy and delicious.

This was wonderful. I added crushed red pepper and brocolli and added only 1/4 cup sugar and extra garlic. My family wants this to be a staple!

No need to fry the meat or use corn startch! I just saute the meat in 2 TBS of oil (I used sesame oil) with 3 cloves of garlic.  I mix 1/4 cup of Low Sodium Soy Sauce, 1/4 Cup of Brown Sugar, the fresh ginger, some red pepper flakes, mix together and pour over the meat after browning.  From here you can cook low on the stove (add a little water), dump in the crock pot, or I cook it for 10 min. in my Instant Pot on high pressure cook.  I've even added stirfry packs of veggies, or broccoli.  (Don't pressure cook the veggies - they disappear.) LOL

I really enjoyed this although I used round steak cut into very thin pieces and it was still very tough.  The sauce really got thick so I think next time I'll use better meat and add some beef broth at the end to stretch and thin it out just a bit.

Delicious!  My family loved it.  I used low sodium soy sauce, yellow onions instead of green, and added fresh broccoli and green peppers.  After the meat was cooked and removed from the skillet, I added the veggies and stir fried on medium high heat until they were slightly browned but still a little crisp.  Then I continued with step five, with the exception of not adding green onions.   Served with steamed rice.  Easy and yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the best things I have ever cooked. The taste is phenomenal; it's exactly like something I would receive in a Chinese restaurant. I am seriously impressed with myself (and the recipe).

That being said...this was a pain in the behind to make. I fried the beef strips in only 1/4 cup oil (to make an attempt at health,) but the oil still splattered everywhere. Very painful. It took awhile to fry up all the beef strips, so it got annoying after awhile, being attacked by hot oil drops and beef fat. 

However, making the sauce itself was simple and quick. I didn't have fresh garlic or ginger on hand, so I used dried (1/2 tsp ground ginger and reduced 1 tsp garlic powder). Everything else was added as written (though I used low sodium soy sauce). I served with white rice, which was great to soak up the delicious, thick sauce. 

Note: after pouring off excess oil, you might want to de-glaze the pan with water and then dump the de-glazings in the trash so you have a cleaner pan to put the beef back into with the sauce. I DIDN'T dump the de-glazings, and while they didn't alter the taste of the sauce, they did detract from the silky smooth texture of the sauce. 

I will be making this again and sharing it with everyone I know. YUM!

This was not good..sometimes I wonder about the recipes on this site that get good ratings and when I make them they are inedible.  I have been a good cook for over 40 yrs and have no trouble UNTIL I try one on this site...guess I would have learned by now.

I tried this recipe because of how many people rated it well.  This one doesn't work for my tastes.  The sauce tastes liked reduced Pepsi.  The meat is crunchy and stiff.  It may be perfect for you.  Not what works for me.  Too many negatives to tweak.  I'll look for a recipe that works better for my tastes.

I thought this was very good.  A few simple changes, I fried the beef in 3 batches, in only 2 tbsp of oil each time.  I might cut the sauce in half, as there was quite a bit of sauce.  I also added mushrooms which went well with the sauce?  Served with brown rice and steamed sugar snap peas.

This is delicious! I only used about 1/4 cup of oil to fry the beef. I also used think cut sirloin because I could not find flank steak. Read the recipe thoroughly before you start. I reversed steps 1 and 2.

This was FANTASTIC!  I love P.F. Chang's mongolian beef, and this is really, really close!  I have made this several times, and even my 3-year-old loves it.   I did not have any ginger on hand, so I substituted orange zest instead, and it gives it just the right hint of citrus.  Also, we eat a fair amount of game meat in our family, and this worked well using both deer and nilgai meat.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a fantastic dish!!  I do lighten up a bit on the soy sauce and add just a bit more water.  When done I sprinkle with crushed red pepper & sesame seeds for some zest and appearance.

Tastes wonderful. As others suggested, I eased up on the brown sugar and added a glob of Hoisin Sauce. I will make again, but suggest using more onions and making more sauce by adding additional Soy Sauce and Water.

This recipe was actually fun to make. I used round steak (couldn't find flank) and the meat turned out perfect. I added fresh snow peas, water chestnuts and 1 TB hoisin sauce. My family loved it!

This was fabulous!  Hands down one of the best things I've ever made.  I altered it just a little.  Unlike other people, I didn't find this too salty at all.  Might be able to cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup instead of 2/3 but it was great the way it was.  I thought the beef frying part was much more difficult than it needed to be so I simply pan fried it in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil like normal.  The cornstarch really helped to thicken the sauce once it was added back into the pan.  I also added red pepper flakes to give it a kick and balance out the sweetness.  Simply fabulous!  My husband hates Chinese food and he gobbled this right up!

Fantastic!

I doubled the meat, and that resulted in a good meat-to-sauce ration.

Also, I didn't have any dark brown sugar, so used golden brown sugar and added about 2 teaspoons of molasses.

I also added some sliced red pepper with the green onion.

Served it with rice, veggies, and bread, was delicious!

Very, very nice - reminded me of take-out ginger beef. Boiled up some frozen broccoli and threw them in at the end. Used Chiese rice noodles. Only (minor) problem was that there seemd to be a bit too much sauce - might reduce the amount of water next time.

This was pretty simple and fast - I made it when I had a 10 pm craving for chinese. The sauce is pretty sweet, but I love how crispy the flank steak gets. I will definitely make this again.

I have tried so many of these mongolian beef recipes, this one is by far the best one I have had yet.  It had the sweetness of mongolian beef but yet the spice, just enough.  I could add extra after dishing the kids up. . .  I give it a 10!  :D

I used half the soy sauce, yet it was so salty. And i used less than 1/2 cup dark brown sugar while the recipe asked for 2/3 and yet it was so sweet, no one in my family liked it, neither me. If i ever make it next time, i ll use the QUANTITIES more reasonably!!!! And oh not to mention, it was so thin like watery consistency, i had to use cornstarch to thicken it. Just think. How can water soy sauce and sugar make a sauce???? Its way too thin. Not even close to the mongolian beef i have had..

I have made this twice now. And each time it was the best!  The second time I made it I cut the soy sauce by a few tablespoons and replaced it water. My husband said he like both, but preferred the second. He said it the second was sweeter.

This dish was wonderful! I rarely fry food so I didn't realize the importance of getting the oil to the correct temperature. The first few pieces of meat that I put in the hot oil got beautifully crispy within 2 minutes. Once I added the rest of the meat, I think the temperature got too low and the meat didn't get crispy like the first few pieces. Next time I will be sure the oil is hot enough and also fry in batches. The taste was still delicious, but I prefer the crispy meat. :) I will definitely make this again!

What a wonderful quick delicious dinner. I adapted to what I had:  a mix of ribeye and top round instead of flank steak; light brown sugar and molasses instead of dark, onion powder instead of garlic (my husband's allergic). I used less sugar and threw in broccoli (thanks to other reviews), and everyone in my family loved it. That doesn't happen often.

I used less brown sugar then called for.  The addition of a little hoisin sauce was perfect!  Next time I'll make sure to lightly coat the cornstarch.  I served with rice and bean threads...yummers!

This recipe just wasn't a big hit with us, just a personal preference, I guess.  It's very sweet, and we'd prefer different seasonings.  I used regular onions & red peppers instead of green onions.

Added asparagus and grape tomatoes. Also thickened up the sauce a little with cornstarch and water. Everyone loved it!

Very, very good. We like snap peas so I throw some of those in at the end. Good reviews from everyone I serve this one to.

AWESOME  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  It is sweet, but that's what I love about it.  The brown sugar gives it such a unique flavor.  Can't wait to make it again!  Maybe I'll even try it with chicken or throw in some red pepper flakes for a little kick.

Delicious! Doubled the beef and made 1.5 times the sauce. Used 2/3 cup sugar not packed at all. Perfect! I need to work on my frying technique, but that was just me. My family loved this dish and can't wait until I make it again!

This had good flavor, but the cornstarch deep fry of the beef created a bad texture. Next time I will use cornstarch only to thicken the sauce, and will simply stir fry the beef for a fresher flavor and texture.

I've only been using Allrecipies.com for about 6 months. This is the first review I've written just because we loved it that much!

When I prepared this recipe as written hubby thought it a bit too sweet (I thought it was perfect).  2nd time I followed jeff97's advise and added the brown sugar to taste (about 4 tbls.) rather than the 2/3 cup and just a little more soy souce. He loved it! 3rd time making I added some snow pea pods. You could add just about any vegetable and it would be great.  Adding something crunchy (the green onions get soft) makes it very nice.  Definately a keeper!

A delicious recipe.  I used skirt steak as that what my local grocer had on sale.  It sliced beautifully into very thin strips.  The taste of the sauce was delicious.  The mistake I made was to marinate the steak in a small amount of the sauce.  When I fried it in the wok, the sauce burnt to the sides (I'm assuming it was the sugar in the sauce).  It didn't affect the recipe; however, it took me quite a while to clean the wok!

The taste of this was delicious.  It was a little sweeter than I expected, but was very good.  I had to double it for our family of 6.  We loved it....even my 2 picky eaters (who did eat around the onions).  My husband and I like it a little spicy so next time I will probably seperate some out for us and add some red pepper.  Over all we thought it was very good.

If I made it again I would only use a 1/4 cup of soy sauce, it was a little too spicy.

Did not enjoy at all.  The sauce tasted only of soy sauce, and the corn starch on the beef just became soggy.

FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!! Used 4 tablespoons of sugar, and it tasted like heaven. I definitely recommend adding the sugar by tablespoon instead of all at once in order to get the sweetness you want. Can't wait to make this again!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Instead of using the soy sauce/brown sugar, I used 1C of "ABC's Sweet Soy Sauce".  (I always have some of that on-hand!)  
I know I altered it, but I still have to give this recipe 5 stars!  It was amazingly delicious!  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

My family and I loved this recipe. I will definitely fix this again. I did make a few slight changes. 2/3 cup sugar seemed excessive so I cut it back to 2 heaping table spoons. Also I used liquid amino in place of soy sauce. same flavor just cuts back on the salt. I have since made this again and added chicken instead of beef, both ways are great. If your looking for more stir fry style its easy to add snap peas, baby corn and water chestnuts. Fast to fix and a family favorite.

This was delish!  But like many reviews, I thought it was a bit too sweet.  The fresh garlic and ginger are superb!  When I make it next time though, I'm going to add broccoli.  Hubby loved it too.  He wanted more.

I thought this dish was amazing EXCEPT for the fact that it was too sweet.  It was sad, everything about this dish was perfect, but it was so sweet I almost couldn't eat it.  I served it over rice, and added a tiny bit of Thai chili sauce to give it a little kick.  I will make this again, but next time cut the brown sugar in half, then I will give it five stars!

I fixed this last night, and it was very good. I will fix this again. I used the end pieces from a tenderloin and it turned out great. Restaurant quality.  I have enough for left overs, to which I will add broccoli, mushrooms and snow peas for a little different dish.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of using lower sodium soy sauce.  My husband enjoyed this more than I because I don't usually enjoy sweet Chinese food.  With this being said, I  will probably make again.  Next time I make I will add crushed red pepper. It was lacking heat.

followed other reviews and cut sugar to 2TBS, but it was wayyyyy too salty. Need to cut soy sauce by half at least. Does not taste anything like the Mongolian Beef that I've eaten at restaurants. Just tastes like fried beef drenched in soy sauce.  Would not make again.

Excellent recipe!  The first time I made this, it was too salty but I over-reduced the sauce.  Listen to the recipe and don't boil the sauce too long like I did.  The 2nd time I made it was better, but the 3rd time was the best as I used low-sodium soy sauce--Absolutely perfect with low-sodium soy sauce.  Easy to make and really impressive--Thanks!

I just made this and it was so delicious. Only changes I made was I added a drop of molasses to the sauce since I was using light brown sugar and I added a bit of cornstarch mixed with water at the end to thicken the sauce up.  The hot oil made a total mess of my clean stovetop, but was well worth it -- will definitely make this again!

My family LOVED this. We didn't change a thing and there were NO left overs. Please try this as is before you change something around. Since the sauce smelled so wonderful, I added fresh mushrooms and broccoli chunks in during the final stage- it was heavenly!!

I loved this recipe. I do a lot of stir frying. To save time I always buy the thin cut beef strips then I use my meat tenderizer on them, pounding the heck out of them. You can use any vegetables in this and it is always great.
I do cut back on the sugar, like others have suggested.

Really simple and tastes amazing.  I love the Mongolian Beef at Pei Wei so when another person said it tasted just like it I knew I had to try it.  I was thrilled it was exactly like Pei Wei.  This will definitely become a regular dinner at my house.

I was very happy with how this came out.  It will need a little bit of tweaking to fit my tastes, but the result was very close to what I expected, so the tweaking will just be the personalization that all recipes need a little of.

This does not taste like PF Changs. My family did not care for it. It seems there is something missing spice wise.

I love, love, love this recipe.  It's as good as PF Changs Mongolian Beef.  I make this at least every other week and my husband and kids fight over it.  I have to double the recipe for the four of us so we have leftovers for lunch the next day.

We thought this was excellent. I didn't have any ginger root but used some asian seasoning instead. I added some orange peppers to it. Very good recipe and would make again.

The flavor of this was outstanding! I thoroughly enjoyed the coating of cornstarch on the beef and how it made it crispy. The sauce was delicious and simple. After removing the beef, I wiped the pan clean and quickly stir-fried some fresh veggies to round out the meal and incorporate with the beef - there was plenty of sauce for this! The only reason I don't give this 5 stars, is due to the fact that the beef gets a little soggy if you don't serve this immediately after tossing with sauce. It's a little time consuming when all said and done, but it sure was worth it and I will definitely make again, but will likely just make some timing changes so the beef gets served right away and maintains that yummy crispiness. Thank you!

The only additional thing that I did it was to tenderize the meat   Mingling baking soda into the meat let it sit for a few minutes and then rinse thoroughly.

Oh my goodness...this was so good...so easy....and a hit with the kids! I didn't do the onions, but I did add frozen stir fry veggies... as another reviewer did... when I put the meat and sauce together at the end. I also made more sauce to pour over...just soy sauce and dark brown sugar (no measuring) to taste.  The husband said next time he wants the meat less done....my granddaughters said to do chicken next.  I made sticky rice to eat with it...also a big hit.  Thanks for the recipe!!!! No negatives here!!!! (If you don't have the fresh ginger and/or garlic I think it still would be good) OH! My butcher didn't have flank steak, but he did have london broil AND he sliced it into 1/4" strips for me.  Perfect!

Because this dish is best served hot immediately from the stove and my husband's work hours have been all over the map, I omitted the oils, stuck the beef in the slow cooker coated with cooking spray, mixed together the remaining ingredients (sans onions) and poured it over the beef after it had cooked for about 3-4 hours. Upside - it cut a boatload of calories and fat from the recipe. Downside, you lose that seductive crisp exterior. The flavor was amazing, and I will make it again in the slow cooker, just without the corn starch, which made the sauce very thick - almost gelled.

This is a great recipe, will cook again! I did make changes due to previous review's. I cut brown sugar in half, added 2 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar. Added broccoli along with the spring onions. I also double the meat and added just enough extra cornstarch to coat.

Made this a few months ago and everyone loved it (including those picky crumbsnatchers we call kids)! Came back for the recipe 'cause I am gonna make it again tonight. You have to read HMEDELL's review, dated 4/13/11. You will not be disappointed. 
The first time I made it, I used some of her suggestions and it came out amazing. 
The Hoisin sauce is a fantastic suggestion. 
All the negative reviews are baffling 'cause this recipe is awesome!!!! Thank you, vkarlson!

The sauce is great but was very unsuccessful cooking the beef since it's too easy to overcook due to personal errors. Attempted it a second time by grilling tri tip on the BBQ and lightly basting the meat with the sauce to get a crispy outside. Meat was a beautiful medium rare, sliced thin and drizzled the sauce and onions over the meat. A lot easier and healthier than frying the meat!

I actually loved this recipe. I served it over chinese noodles, but next time, I'll put it over rice, reduce the sugar,  and add some spice. One of my family's favorite recipes is the General Tsao's chicken, which calls for dried chilis. I'm going to try that in this recipe next time :) Overall, I loved this

This is fantastic! Authentic and delicious, even my kids loved it! It was too easy I didn't think there was any way it could be really good. We served it over rice with stir fry vegetables. The only complaint, I should have doubled the recipe because everyone wants leftovers!

Wonderful!  Only one teeny weeny suggestion. Next time I make this I will cut down the soy sauce and add maybe a bit more water. Was delicious, but a little on the salty side.  I added some red pepper flakes to heat it up a bit.  It's a keeper!

This is my third try to get this without it being published before I finish.   Since the amount of brown sugar seemed excessive, I used only two tablespoons. I also used less expensive thin slice steak and tenderized it. I worked with the meat first because the sauce is quick. I kept the sauce hot while the meat finished cooking and placed the meat into the sauce rather than discarding the oil, returning the meat to that pan, and then adding the sauce, I added the meat directly to the sauce, raised the heat to medium-high, added the green onions, and let it cook until the sauce thicken. This works much more easily than trying to get rid if extremely hot oil and is safer. It's delicious and one of our favorite meals over steamed rice.

This was really good!  I stir fried some veggies (onions, carrots, celery, mushrooms, broccoli) after I removed the meat from the pan, then poured the sauce over them and added the meat.  I was restaurant good.  I'm giving 4 stars because I think it needs a little less sugar, but otherwise it's right on.

Amazing!  Better than most restaurant Mongolian beef.  We used a bit less sugar (about 1/2 cup) and thought it was perfectly balanced.

I don't normally review stuff, but I have to say that this basic recipe was really fun. I cut it all in half, but to the sauce, I added a dash of cayenne, some white pepper, and some onion powder. You have to adjust the brown sugar to your taste, but the sauce is just much better after you cook it with the meat and veggies. Anyway, I just used a large yellow onion, added some thinly sliced carrots, and thawed frozen peas, and this was absolutely luscious....just like from a Chinese restaurant. Thanks so much for a great contribution.

This would be 5 star after just a couple of adjustments. I used a little extra garlic, less sugar than called for, added in a couple of tablespoons of rice wine vinegar and a couple of tablespoons of asian chili garlic paste to give it some kick. My sauce did not thicken up despite extra boiling so I had to add a decent amount of cornstarch to get that nice thick glaze I wanted. In the end though, it was a phenomenal dish and everyone absolutely loved it. I served it over jasmine rice along side an asian green salad with miso ginger dressing.

Good sweet stir-fry sauce; however, this doesn't match the Mongolian Beef recipe I'm trying to duplicate. Next time I will cut the brown sugar down to 1/3 or 1/2 cup, as it was a little too sweet for my tastes.

First time I've tried to cook this dish.  Used flat iron steak rather than flank.  Came out tender and delicious.  Even my picky kids loved it (but not the onions)!  Only downside was it took me a while to pre-cook the beef strips, but the dish was well worth it.  Enjoyed every bite.  Thanks for sharing.

It was good.  It tasted just like the Mongolian beef at Chi Tung... However, with all the work involved personally I'd rather spend the $8.95 and order take out.  The recipe easy to follow but it was too many steps and not enough wow factor.

Made this the other night, and it was definitely the best homemade chinese dish I've attempted. I agree with others that the soy sauce should be decreased ......next time I will make it with 1/2 cup soy and whole cup water. Also addes come white onions for crunch and that was tasty too!

Don't change a thing, except if you want more meat it'd be okay with the same amount of sauce. I made it with ginger powder, golden brown sugar, and low sodium soy sauce. Tasted amazing :)

I love, love, love this recipe. It tastes like you when out to a Mongolian restaurant. I did make some changes though. I used a 1/3 cup of soy sauce and used 1/2 cup of vegitable oil for frying (with a pound and a half of steak). I also added lots of red peppers and broccoli. This is definitely a recipe I will print out and use again. Thank you!

I was really skeptical about the frying of the beef, as I had never fried many things, but this turned out fabulous. Everyone loved it and even said it was restaurant quality!

Delicious - my girlfriend said it tasted good enough to be served at a fancier Chinese restaurant. Using actual flank steak and doing the cornstarch coating  gives this a more layered flavor than just throwing meat in a wok and cooking it.

I have made this a few times now and it is a favorite in my household. My 5, 3 and 2 year old love it and it is one of the few things my husband requests. I use WAY less brown sugar only because using the full amount makes it too sweet for our tastes. I also have made it with and without first coating in the cornstarch and it is great both ways. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

A decent recipe but I think I'd rather buy them from the local Chinese restaurant next time. I used about 1/2 the sugar and it was still too sweet and too salty.

This had a really good taste. A reviewer said it tasted like P.F. Changs. I have never eaten there, but I believe now that all stir-fry and many meats are also deep fried at restaurants like this dish. I see where all of the oil comes from now! I was intrigued by the method and wanted to try it once. I used low-sodium soy sauce but it still does call for a lot more than really is healthy in the dish along with the sugar. I also thought it was rather time consuming for the 4 servings the recipe makes. My suggestion is to buy pre-cut meat and use a small deep fryer to get the correct temperature with clean oil. Or, possibly a wok is better, because I couldn't quite get the oil consistent in temperature and I had some beyond normal oil splashing for some reason. I also had quite a lot of clean-up with dishes. However, though, if sodium/cholesterol etc. and time are not a concern, and you want a restaurant quality Mongolian beef with onions, this dish will not dissapoint!

This recipe was amazing! We personally didn't find it too sweet or salty. The only changes I made were a dash of crushed red pepper flakes, ground ginger in place of fresh, white onions b/c I didn't have green and thin cuts of round steak in place of flank b/c I wanted to use what I had. I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted great! Kids and hubby agree this recipe is a keeper:)

I would add more stars if I could!!!

I followed this recipe as written with the one exception of not leaving the meat in the frying oil nearly 2 minutes (more like 45 seconds). The sauce was perfect just as written.

I'll give this 5 stars because the family devoured it and said it was better than restaurant food. It was delicious, however, I found it a bit labor intensive and messy to prepare. Of course, that could be because I had to cook it in a large shallow skillet-my wok has disappeared. But because it was so tasty, I'm sure I'll be getting requests for it again. But, I'll buy a new wok before then.

Wow! This is great! I pretty much made this as closely as my pantry supply would allow me to... I had a bit less than half a cup of vegetable oil, so I used walnut oil for the sauce. Used the vegetable oil for the meat - took it a bit longer to cook, but it still turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVED this dish - perhaps even a new favorite. The flavor was divine. The brown sugar made the flavor very sweet, but then the ginger and soy sauce added a new Asian dimension. Absolutely delicious. The only thing I changed was that I cooked everything in the same pan. When the sauce was through cooking I transferred it to a bowl and then just fried up the beef in the same pan and added the liquid back into it at the end. I paired this with Restaurant Quality Fried Rice from this site.

This was sooo delish!  I was so proud of myself after making this. My first attempt with a WOK! I for some reason have this issue with following directions (lol) so I messed up with the directions a bit, but it still turned out great! I started cooking the 2 teaspoons of oil and garlic in the WOK and let that get hot. In a separate bowl, I mixed the brown sugar, soy sauce, lime juice, Worcester sauce, dry mustard, and water into a bowl. I added the soy sauce mix to the oil and garlic in the WOK and let it get hot again. Then I threw half of the meat in the WOK!! Whoops, that is not what the directions said but it tasted fabulous! I cooked the other half of the meat per the directions, however I liked the coloring, taste and texture of the first batch!! This is a serious keeper! Thank you!!

Excellent!  My husband loves Mongolian Beef on the Chinese Buffet.  He said this was better.  For some reason, I couldn't find flank steak the night I wanted to make it, so i used round steak.

Baje la cantidad de azucar a 1/3 taza.
El flank steak salio muy friboso, probare con otro corte la prox. vez.
Anadi brocolli al final y deje reposar al vapor.
La prox. vez tambien hechare zanahorias, antes que el brocolli.

I made this exactly as written and I really really like it.  The sauce made too much for the amount of sauce so next time I will double the meat.  Also, prep and cook time took waaaaay longer than stated.  Took me about an hour, I think, and it's a pain to fry.  With double the meat, it would be worth it so I could have leftovers.

Delicious!  I added red pepper flakes because we like a little "heat", but it tasted just like the Mongolian Beef from our favorite Chinese take out spot! Thank you!

This was fantastic!  I have been searching for a PF version for a while and this is it.  I will be using low sodium soy sauce next time though.  The saltiness was a bit to much for my tastes.  Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious if you cut way back  on the brown sugar.  2/3 cups is way to much. Cutting it to 1/3 cup might be too much. I made a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce before serving otherwise it's too thin.  The flank steak is the best cut of meat to use.

Really, really good.  I added broccoli, and didn't fry the meat as directed.  I used two tablespoons of oil and that was more than sufficient.  I would give it a five star rating, but I added up all of the ingredients, and even with my modifications of the amount of oil, there is no way that the caloric calculator is correct on this one.  Dieters beware!  You can get out of control with this dish because it is so very delicious!

Very good!  The only change I would make next time I make it would be to add less soy sauce or use a reduced sodium soy sauce....but will make again, family enjoyed.  I also took the advice from another and prepared meat first and let sit in corn starch, then started sauce.  Great recipe!

This was amazing!  Much better than take out.  I did everything exactly as written but doubled the sauce (I had more than a pound of beef).   I put the extra sauce in a gravy boat to pass.  We just couldn't get enough of it!  Thank you so much!

This was delicious! Somewhat involved, but worth it! Used low sodium soy sauce, so it was not salty, just right, and added more ginger than it calls for, a little more than 1 teaspoon. Served over jasmin rice cooked with lemon zest. Perfect!

I made this and doubled the recipe. I added a bit more ginger because I love ginger, but that's it. If you follow this recipe exactly though, you will love it.   I served it with lemongrass-infused jasmine rice.  I uploaded the photo on the square white plate. It was awesome.

WOW. First go took a while to make but MORE than worth the effort. We added chili flakes (as some had recommended) but it still wasn't hot enugh for us so we also added about 4 tablespoons chili oil. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

Pretty yummy stuff.  We enjoyed this over some steamed rice.  I have always thought of mongolian beef as a spicy dish so I added some pepper flakes and that really did the trick.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will make is again for sure.

This was a wonderful dish! I will definitely be making it again. I didn't use all the sauce, just maybe 1/4 cup was all I needed, the rest I am refrigerating and using it later for my next batch! Will add more ginger, I didn't have dark brown sugar, and had to use light brown sugar.

This was super tasty. I added in red pepper flakes to the sauce. It gives it a nice little kick. Not too much of one. But it is enough to notice every other bite. Also, you have to watch the meat in the oil. If you leave it for the full 2 minutes you will def. overcook it.

Delicious!!  Made it with less brown sugar due to my husband not liking food being too sweet.  Also added green and red peppers and onions to add color.  Served with egg noodles.

Pretty good! I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to take out the salt, and I added a half tablespoon of red pepper flakes, the sauce was just meh before these additions. It works great with cubed chicken as well!

This is an amazing recipe and the end result is delicious! I did simmer the beef for twice as long because there was too much water, but I think it helps make the beef more tender anyway. Important to get the beef crispy too!

This was very easy to make and didn’t take long at all! I took some advice from other reviewers and added a small amount of Hoisin sauce to the sauce mix and used 2lbs of beef instead of 1. This was a big hit in the house and I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Excellent recipe! I only modified it a tiny bit (didn’t fry the beef and added red pepper flakes), and it was so good. Even my wildly picky teenagers said they loved it. That’s a win for me.

Best Recipe Yet!

I used a nice cut of top round  and did not change a thing and it the beef was  tender and the sauce delicious.  It may be a little salty for some so you could use low sodium soy sauce.  Husband and teenage daughter loved it and said it tasted like restaurant quality! : )

So flavorful and delicious, it tasted just like takeout. I couldn’t believe I was the one who had made it! I will definitely be making this again.

The dish is very sweet, but I'm a huge sweet tooth, so I didn't mind. You might choose to reduce the amount of brown sugar if you don't like your food to be very sweet.

Excellent, but next time I'll reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and add some red pepper flakes...it would benefit from some heat.

2.5 stars.  I made the recipe as stated.  There was way too much sugar.  It almost made it inedible.  2/3 cup of brown sugar should be 2-3 TBSP at the most.  I made the recipe last night.  RIght now, I am trying to determine how to save the leftovers.  I think it would be good to add additional veggies and perhaps more water/soy sauce.   I think it could become a 4-5 star recipe if I can find a way to get the sugar/salt balance to better align with my tastes.

I made this and it was almost perfect but the issue was because I wasn't frying my beef properly. I started adding the beef to about a cup of oil. Then after a few minutes the grease began to spatter all over the place. I couldn't wait to get the beef out of the pan. Also, the flank steak wasn't super tender. It wasn't bad but it was a bit chewy.

I marinated the beef with soy sauce, oil, grated garlic & ginger first and added green beans for more veg.  Would use less sugar next time-but there will definitely be a next time!  Whole family gave it a thumbs up!

We have tried many Mongolian Beef recipes and this is by far the BEST! We doubled the sauce recipe (we like to make extra meat for leftovers) and it turned out great! We used gluten free soy sauce and added fresh broccoli. **on a side note we did NOT use the 1cup of oil to fry the meat per the recipe, we did about 2 tablespoons and it was the perfect amount**

I would use half the brown sugar. To me it was way to sweet! I also used more ginger and I added red pepper flakes for a little kick. I used a meat mallet to tenderize the meat. I would make this again with alteration.

Not as flavorful as some I've had.  You could also add a little heat and have an excellent outcome.  I'd make it again and add a bit of birdseye pepper.

I made the recipe exactly how it is.  It was a little to sweet for me, so I would you half of the sugar, and add some crushed red pepper seeds, or something with a little spice.  Definitely will make again.

Perfect. Didn’t change anything. It is pretty sweet, but I didn’t think too sweet.

Family loved it.  I used less sugar than the recipe called for because many people said it was sweet.  I think if I had used the full amount it would have been overly sweet.  Overall it’s a keeper meal!

Delicious! I added some sliced sweet peppers and carrots in the last step, served over rice and alongside Sesame Snap Peas. Took a little bit longer than I expected, but well worth the effort.

The meat cooked very well and was very tender.  The sauce is much too sugary for my husband and I.  If I make this again, I will find a way too use much less sugar.

Absolutely amazing dish as written. It is a very concentrated sauce and seems to be best spread thinly over rice and vegetables. If this dish was eaten as a side it is VERY salty. I did thin the sauce with a little extra water at the end to help it spread more throughout the veg and rice we had with it.

Stays crispy in the sauce!

Just some minor changes to some of the sauce ingredient amounts based on comments: Used 1/2c brown sugar, 1c water, and ~2T of regular Kens BBQ sauce since I didn’t have Hoisen and used a packet of Mongolian beef seasoning mix since I had it. Used lite soy sauce.  Came out perfect with extra sauce for the rice. Kids loved it !!!

I didn't have dark brown sugar on hand so I used light brown sugar and I also used low sodium soy sauce.   It's better than take out!  A hit with the whole family.

Made with chicken. It was very tasty!! 

Update: Made it with beef it was also very tasty! Took a bit of time to fry the beef in batches, but the consistency was worth it! Upping my rating to 5 stars! Only think I'd do different is use slightly less soy sauce or low sodium soy sauce as it was a little on the salty side.

This was delicious after I made some small adjustments recommended in the reviews.  I cut back a touch on the brown sugar and soy sauce. 
Next time I will use the low sodium soy sauce because even with cutting back it was still on the salty side. Simple dish but does require a bit of time with the chopping and prepping of ingredients. That doesn’t bother me at all if the reward is worth it at the end. This dish was worth it in my opinion.  My husband was a huge fan!

No need to go out anymore.  This was so good it was ridiculous! I eat this quite a bit at restaurants like PF Changs and Pei Wei, and frankly, I thought the restaurant was just as good, if not better. My wife and kids loved it. I made the recipe pretty much as is, however, I sautéed a separate dish of Asian stir fry Veges, which was a perfect compliment to the dish. Delicious and definitely will make it again and again.

The sauce was too sweet/salty, so will halve the soy and substitute sherry next. I will halve the sugar, but add approx another tbsp at the end to taste. I will stir fry the meat rather than dredge it in cornflour and deep fry in oil. That was fairly messy. I would add extra vegetables as well. Perhaps capsicum and celery, and blanch them before stir frying separately. Adding the spring onions to the meat and sauce discoloured them.

Tastes like takeout, in the best way! The only note I'd give others is to plan for the fry stage to take about 20 minutes. Since you have to fry the meat in batches, and it's best to let the oil come back up to temp before adding more meat, this was a time eater of a step. (Though well with the wait and pretty low effort) I used a candy thermometer to help with the oil temp.

When my family wants Chinese for dinner, this is our go to recipe. I only change one thing and it's to give it a little kick of sweet. Instead of 1/2 cup of soy sauce,  I use 1/4 cup of soy sauce and 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce. This will also help to thicken the sauce a bit more as well.

With tweaks, we thought this was great! Thank you to other reviewers who recommended reducing sugar and even the soy sauce.  I reduced soy sauce but 2 Tbsp and increased water by same. I reduced sugar to between 1/4 and 1/3 cup. I was going by taste.  I added broccoli and some red pepper and served it over rice cooked in Coconut milk and ginger. A yummy dinner.

I very thinly sliced sirloin steak. Use a sharp knife.
Marinated it in soy, thin sliced ginger and about 5-6 cloves of garlic (through a presser) for an hour. Then tossed it in the cornstarch.

After 20 min, stir-fried it in a wok with peanut oil very briefly ( less than 2 min). Put it on a paper towel. Stir-fried the sliced green onion1-1.5 minutes.
Returned the beef to the wok. Added abt 2 TSBP of Hoisin sauce. Continued to fry, maybe 1 min.
It was delicious. There is about enough beef to make 2 more batches. I only used 1/3 for the test batch.

The beef had a slight crispiness to the edges and was sweet without using sugar. The hoisin sauce is sufficient.

I had a couple of challenges that, but it was still delicious if you don’t mind the sodium - but you shouldn’t cook it if that’s the case

I followed this recipe and added some chopped water chestnuts and red peppers.  Used low salt soy sauce for less salt.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  Served over Coconut Jasmine Rice ( got recipe here too).  So good!!  Double the recipe. You’ll want leftovers!!

Ok, but one dimensional flavor. Salt from soy sauce.  Recommend lower salt soy.

I doubled the sauce recipe, but kept the sugar according to the original recipe because I saw other comments that it was too sweet. It worked out perfect. Kids loved it!

Also needs Hoisin sauce or better still Black Bean paste/sauce.  Replace the brown sugar with 3 tablespoons of spicy Asian sweet chili sauce.  Yes, serve over noodles with a teaspoon of aromatic and flavorful pure sesame oil.  This is an excellent recipe by itself, and these suggestions raise it to another level of flavor.

My husband liked it as written. I thought it was too sweet. I need to re-read the ingredients. I think it may have called for dk.sugar. I used light brown sugar -- it's what I had in stock. I think the part about coating the meat in corn starch isn't required. Also, my meat didn't come out soft. When I make Bistek Mexicana or Carne Guisada, letting the meat simmer a good 30 minutes leaves it nice and tender without having to use tenderizer. Knowing that, I went ahead and let this simmer another 10 minutes. I had added broccoli, and sadly it was kinda soggy due to the extra cooking time. I will try this again, but adjusted.

Great recipe!  A hit!  I cut back a bit on the sugar for the sake of nutrition.  I also added organic baby broccoli at the end ("beef and broccoli") and sprinkled on sesame seeds to make it look like fancy Chinese.  A winner!

Meat was tender and the sauce was delicious.  I think I'll make it with a little less brown sugar next time, it was pretty sweet . Had it with basmati rice and plenty of green onions.

Soooooo good. Made it as written and the sauce is a tad too sweet for me but I will definitely make it again, reducing the amount of brown sugar. While I did not substitute or eliminate anything I did add one thing - fresh broccoli and it was delicious. Great recipe.

This was delicious! I doubled the recipe since the smallest cut of meat I could get was two pounds. I halved the sugar, added some red pepper flakes, and some blanched baby bok choy. It turned out very good and my family loved it.

Followed the recipe to the T except for the brown sugar part. I used 1/3 instead of 2/3. I think the most important part here is actually making sure you cut your beef into 1/4 thick slices or it’ll be too tough. I added red and green peppers, white onions, and a bit of green onion. I made fried rice as the side dish and it was delicious.. only thing I would like to add next time is some type of spice variable so the sauce doesn’t taste too sweet or too salty from the soy sauce.

This was pretty good. I was looking for a different kind of flavor but it was still good. I may add some spice to it next time. My youngest son doesn’t like spicy foods. I’ll keep the recipe but it won’t be a go to when trying to impress.

I used three tablespoons of brown sugar.  I used 20% less sodium soy sauce but still a little salty.  Next time I will use 37% less sodium soy sauce. We liked it a lot and will make again.  Easy to prep, fast cooking time.   I fried the meat strips until they got a nice brown coating.  They were not dry or tough.   We served with Jasmine rice and added broccoli. Yum!

I made it exactly according to the recipe and thought it was great. For my personal taste i will add more green onions.  I love the green onions.  Recipe was easy and fast to put to together.   Would definitely make again

I used top sirloin steak (half the cost) and it turned out great and tender.  I wish I trusted my instincts and used a lot less sugar, though.  We like it spicy so I added dried red chili pepper with the garlic and ginger.

Great recipe.  I prep the beef (step #2) first so it's drying out while I prep the rest to save some time.

What can be said? Nothing but just how great this tasted and will be making it again. I would add probably at least double the ginger next time though. I was good but more ginger would make it perfect for me. As with any dish you need to adjust the flavours to suit you but even as it stands it is a 5 star.

It was fantastic and I will absolutely make it again.  I cooked the beef an extra minute but otherwise didn't change anything and I'm looking forward to my leftovers.

Normally when I hear, just like the restaurant I"m doubtful.   This one is actually better than PF Changs....by a long shot.      

You will need more meat than you think....this is seriously so good, people will just keep eating.  

I would suggest a lower salt soy sauce...other than that, perfect.

I added broccoli which was tasty.  Next time I may sub chicken thigh meat.  Also the recipe makes a lot of sauce. You can get two meals from that amount.

Well it does taste like what you get in some restaurants, but in a terrible-for-you fast food kind of way, which was not want I wanted. Tons of sugar and soy sauce, and deep fried! In hindsight, I guess I should have expected it.

I might still use this recipe again with major variations (cut down the sugar and soy sauce, just saute the meat), because overall it did produce a nice flavor.

This is a great recipe. I followed it with just a couple small changes. First I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 of a cup and added 2 tbsp of hoisin sauce. I cooked the beef in small batches and put it aside. Then I sautéed some broccoli, green pepper and mushrooms in the pan, added back the meat then the sauce. Let it all simmer for a few minutes and served it over rice.

I agree it’s a little sweet, so I’ll cut the sugar by a third to a half next time, and I’ll add just a little red pepper flakes for a little punch.  Excellent and easy! I had all the ingredients on hand, so that was a bonus.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. It is definitely one that I will be making many times in the future. I noticed several reviews commented on the recipe being either too salty or too sweet, I didn't experience either at all even with the addition of half of a sweet onion. A couple notes from my experience: When cutting the flank steak, make sure to cut against the grain around a 45 degree angle to increase the tenderness. I also deglazed the frying pan, after emptying the frying oil, with a bit of white wine to bring up all the tasty meat bits off the pan. While deglazing I fried the sweet onion until just barely cooked but still crunchy to avoid overcooking later. The sauce was not reduced completely. I simmered the sauce until all the sugar was dissolved and then about eight - ten minutes longer on a low heat. Once I added the sauce to the finished meat and onions it thickened just enough to coat the meat nicely without becoming syrupy. For a spicy kick, add about a teaspoon of crushed red peppers while simmering the sauce.

I’m trying to find a recipe that is similar to the PF Chang’s version. This was closest of the 3-4 I’ve tried, but not sure if I’ll make it again - it was really salty. Maybe less soy sauce? Not sure but I’m not that picky of an eater and I couldn’t finish my serving it was so salty. And I use soy sauce in a lot of dishes and have never felt it was too salty before. Not sure what happened for me in this one.

I used less sugar and low sodium soy sauce. This was my second attempt, and it came out GREAT. Also, I highly recommend taking care of the starch and beef before starting the cooking process.

This was only so-so for me. The meal turned out fine, meet was well cooked, vegetables were crisp-tender but the sauce itself was a bit too thick and not tangy like I wanted it to be. The cost of cleanup was not worth it for me to try this one again.

Made sure to use low sodium soy sauce, I always use low sodium products when available.  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much. Will make again.

It was a quick and easy recipe to follow! Seasoned beef with salt and pepper first and added hosian to the sauce. Very tender with a nice coating to the beef!

Totally enjoyed this meal. Only change I made was to add a cornstarch and water thickener to the sauce in the end.

Absolutely delicious!  I had to substitute a few ingredients, went with what I had on hand.  Used sweet onions in place of the spring onions, did not use the ginger root....and added green bell pepper.  This is one recipe that I will use over and over again.

I read the reviews and adjusted the amount of brown sugar, used low sodium soy, reduced the oil to a few tablespoons for frying,  and broke out the splatter screen. Definitely use the cornstarch on the beef (we used flap steak- all we had) before you start prepping other items. It needs time to soak into the meat, that's what makes it extra crunchy on the outside.
Really good, very messy- husband liked it and Mongolian Beef is his favorite take out item to order. We will be making again

Followed directions and this turned out great.  I did substitute filet for the beef.  The only change Inwould make is making it wit chili flakes or something to make it hot.  Otherwise it was delicious !

Sweet, yes, but oh so flavorful. I always make a recipe just as written the first time, even after reading all of the reviews. I found the sauce to be too thin, and next time will decrease the water. Otherwise, very tasty!

I made this I instead of the slow cooker for the whole day used my pressure cooker for fifteen minutes . It was very good, the only thing o would say is maybe a tad less soy sauce. It was a bit strong for hubbys taste, but he ate every bit

This may be the best mongolian beef I've ever made. The beef was crispy and the sauce tangy. The only think I  changed was to add some heat. I know that MB doesn't have heat and it was my personal preference but it was so good with a little red pepper flakes. I also know that people freak out with MSG but I added a sprinkle and it really woke up the sauce.

I used flank steak...next time I will use flat iron steaks ( cut out the connect tissue that runs down the middle, trim off the silver skin on the outside, and slice).   I prefer the flavor over flank steak.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and it was great...I like it sweet.

Great recipe—we loved it.  The first time I made it, I didn’t have the fresh ginger so used powdered—it was great!  The next time, I made sure I had all fresh ingredients.—absolutely wonderful.  Think I’ll try it with chicken...

Brace yourself!  I FOLLOWED the recipe to the letter, yea go figure!!  With that said this came out a bit too sweet for mine and my wife's liking.  I'm saving this recipe because I have some ideas to make it more suitable to our tastes, but as written it was "Ok".

This dish was outstanding! I did not use as much brown sugar as the recipe called for. Started with 2 T and adjusted to taste. Also used only 1/4 cup soy sauce, and it was still a bit salty for us. We love hot peppers and red pepper flakes, so I added some to the dish. Gave it a bit of a kick. Delicious!

The only changes I made were to add broccoli and carrots which I had leftover and I used sirloin beef tips instead of flank steak. I always look for recipes in which to use spring onions when they're available this time of year. I was excited to finally find a method where the beef is nice and crispy. I used Saifun (bean threads) because they are lighter than rice or rice noodles. My granddaughter who is a very fussy eater, loved this dish! I will definitely make it again.

WOW!  I loved this recipe.  Definitely "Chinese take-out" quality.  The only thing I did differently was I had to boil the sauce about 6-8 minutes before it started to thicken slightly.  Could be that I used a small saucepan.  Had I used a larger saucepan with more surface area, 4 minutes might have been long enough.

Absolutely delicious! We followed the recipe exactly other than the cut of beef. The store didn't have flank, so on the butcher's suggestion we got boneless chuck steak cut thin. Came out as good if not better then our takeout place. Will make again and again!

This is so good, and easy to adjust to your personal taste. Never been to PF Chang’s, but it’s as good as I’ve had anywhere else. I thought it would be more trouble, but the cornstarch really cuts down on the oil’s spitting and popping - it turned out to be an easy recipe. We used bottom round steak, which we sliced very thin, and it turned out great!

Ok.  So i made it semi like the directions. I didnt use as much brown sugar. Or soy sauce. I also used powdered ginger onion and garlic. As for flavor what i did was mix just enough of the brown sugar to sweeten it without going over board. I got thumbs up from my wife. So thats a plus. She can be picky. Back to the review. I am not fond of deep frying. So if you can. Get away from that to make it a bit healthier. I also used chicken and shrimp. Didnt have any beef. I wonder if you can bake it or use a and air fryer. Just to get away from the deep fry part. Thats about the only real issue. The rest was good.

This was very good and pretty quick to make. I added broccoli for some extra veggies and it was a hit. I don't think it was really 4 serving though. 2 adults and a toddler ate it all and wished there were leftovers, so you might want to adjust accordingly depending on your eaters.

I doubled the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. Absolutely delicious. The meat was so tender and yummy. My husband who had had Mongolian beef before said it tasted very authentic and even better than the restaurant version he had. Takes longer than 30 minutes to prep and make everything though.

I made this recipe.   A little on the sweet side.  Next time I'll use less brown sugar and less water.  It had to cook longer to reduce to a thicker consistency. 

It was pretty good though,  it was a double batch and there wasn't any left after dinner.  So it couldn't have been too bad.

I reduced the amount of sugar and added some yellow peppers and mushrooms. Next time I will try it with maple syrup instead of sugar. Also, it goes extremely well with veggie/egg fried rice.

Added some red pepper flakes for heat and cornstarch to the sauce to thicken.  Some broccoli is also a nice addition.

Thanks to the other wonderful reviewers of this recipe, I was pretty sure my teenage swimmer would love this so I tripled the recipe. Observations: I didn't add the full amount of sugar and I'm glad I didn't. It would have been too sweet for our tastes if I had. I was already making it when I realized I didn't have enough soy sauce for tripling, so I used hoisin to finish out the quantity, and it tasted great.  I also fried the meat in my nonstick scanpan, so I didn't use quite the oil tripling would have called for - maybe only 3/4 cup total?  Frying triple the meat took a while, but the results were worth it. My son ate it up, and there was only enough left over for 2 servings of leftovers!

Very tasty. It messes up the kitchen a little, but worth it. It was a little sweet, but better than a similar meal I've had at a local restaurant. I didn't change the recipe, but did drain the beef on a rack rather than on paper towels and found the wok was a good cookware choice. Leftovers disappeared at lunch the next day. This one stays in the recipe box.

A little on the sweet side. Next time I will reduce the sugar and increase the garlic. Otherwise spot on for really good Mongolian beef.

This was good!  I scaled back the brown sugar by half and used low sodium soy sauce.  I also added about 2 tsps of crushed red pepper to the sauce. I’d make this again.  Kids liked it.
You need to fry the beef in the oil for the yummy, crispy, goodness.

Super easy and great flavor.  After reading as plethora of recipes for Mongolian Beef I chose to leave out the 1/2 C water.  The sauce was perfect without it.

I also probably call the recipe "Crispy Beef".

I made no changes.  The sauce did not really thicken up much for me.  Served with Chinese Buffet Green beans from this site for a super meal.  Great flavor, pretty easy to make.  Doubled the recipe and the leftovers were fantastic!  This one goes into the meal rotation.

I halved the sugar (which was a good call) and added a tiny bit of crushed red pepper (would have been better with more).  This is a good, simple, quick basic recipe that is easy to modify for your own tastes--adding veggies (or spice), etc.  I took one star off because I feel the sugar the original recipe called for would have made it taste like candy.

This was really good! I followed the recipe exactly, only reducing the amount of sugar based on other reviews to about 1/3 cup.  It was delicious with that amount, but a little more wouldn't have hurt. The only other difference was that I didn't have fresh ginger on hand (store was out), so I used powdered, which worked just fine. I do wish the beef got a little crispier, but I didn't want to over-cook it.  I served this over white rice with a side of pot stickers.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was an okay recipe. I may make it again. it did not take 30 minutes to make. it took me over an hour and a half. maybe I did something wrong but I don't think I did.
UPDATE: My sister got the wrong meat from the store. That's why it tasted so... interesting!!

I rarely try to cook Chinese at home as it never turns out as good as a restaurant but this one is even better than any I've had before!  Followed recipe exactly except my wok absorbs a lot of the vegetable oil so after draining beef on paper towel there is no need to wipe excess off wok.  Thanks for this family favorite that will stay on my rotation!

This was really good!  I heeded the advice of other reviewers and only added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and supplemented with 2 tablespoons hoisen sauce.  But with just that, the recipe was very very salty - and i love salt.  The method of cooking the beef was great though.  A tip I learned to slice the beef evenly and thinly is to toss the beef in the freezer for 1/2 hour - makes slicing a breeze.  I will make this again, and address the saltiness issue with more brown sugar or low-sodium soy.

This was SO good! After I finished slicing up the meat, I wondered if I should have doubled the sauce but it turned out there was exactly the right amount. I did take other's advice and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. It definitely would've been too sweet for my taste if I would have added more. The only other change I made was using flour instead of corn starch because I didn't have any on hand. I will definitely be making this again and again! Took about 25 minutes to make and about 5 minutes to eat. Thanks for this recipe!

This was excellent and even better the next day. Served it with fried rice. Using fresh garlic and fresh ginger is worth the extra effort. I did not find this too sweet at all. Followed the recipe exactly as written. I think you could use any type of steak. I slice mine quite thin so it would fry quickly. Will definitely make again.

I added some broccoli, didn't use ginger, didn't coat in cornstarch or deep fry. Next time I think I will use far less sugar, add ginger and dried chili peppers (if family allows) and even more broccoli. It was very good and I think it will be even better (to my tastes) with those changes. Served on top half jasmine half regular white rice.

Next time I'll cut the sugar in half and add a teaspoon of rice wine vinegar.  As written the sugar overpowers the garlic and ginger.  Rather than deep frying the beef I used a nonstick frying pan and reduced the oil to a tablespoon.  By stir frying in a very hot pan I was able to get the meat to brown quickly and the texture was just how we like it.  Served with rice and broccoli.

This dish was awesome with a few tweeks.  First, flank steak is expensive so I substituted for London Broil.  I used a 3 lb london broil and sliced it against the grain.  I added about 4 more tblspns of soy sauce, and the same in water to the sauce mix.  I listened to others and did not add the onions til later.  After three hours in the crock pot, I added a yellow, red, and orange bell pepper.  After one more hour I added a Large Vidalia Onion sliced into rings.  After one more hour I served it over sticky white rice.  It was fabulous!

2/3 cup of brown sugar was a tad too sugary for my palette.  Will def make again but cut down on the sugar.  Luckily, Siracha saved the meal! 
I added white pepper in breading for the meat.  I also added about a teaspoon of sesame oil to the sauce.

This was delicious and easy.  I find flank steak too tough for my liking so at the suggestion of the butcher, I used pre-cooked beef strips for fajitas (24 oz bag).  I added frozen broccoli as someone had suggested.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty much as written.  I still added the cornstarch to the beef, but since it was cooked and didn't have the moisture, I added some water to the cornstarch first and didn't need to drain the fat from the beef.

Like other reviewers suggested, use low sodium soy sauce and cut the sugar in half. Also, put the beef in the corn starch before making the sauce to save time. It was an ok dish, not great, but I would make it again if I already had the ingredients.

Overall, this recipe was okay. We served it over rice. I cut the onion in half (2 bunches seemed like a ton!) The meat ended up having very little flavor. This most likely will not be a meal we make again.

Great recipe! I took another reviewer's advice and fried the meat for maybe 20 seconds instead of a few minutes. I only had light brown sugar so I added a little molasses to make up for that. I served it with steamed broccoli and rice. My family loved it!

Excellent dish! One of the first "chinese" dishes I've made that actually tastes like it came from a chinese place! I added green bell pepper as I'm not a big fan of green onions.

Delicious and super easy but even with low-sodium soy sauce it's still too salty...and trust me I'm a fan of salt. So, I would dilute with even more water in the future. Definitely making it again!

Loved this! I doubled the meat(and a little extra ??). But I used flat iron steak instead of flank. I found it very tender; plus you can get like three versus one flank steak.

Delicious - we have eaten this at PF Chang's many times and this really tasted the same.  I used LOW SODIUM soy instead of regular, and doubled the ginger to a teaspoon.   I also used light brown sugar vs dark.  I think for those who found it watery, it really needs the directed 4 minutes or MORE to simmer and thicken.  I added about 2Tbs of water mixed with a little cornstarch to the final mix as it was heating all together to thicken more.  Also, I think 2 minutes is too long for simmering final mix with the green onions: they were completely wilted; probably only need 30 sec as the heat from the sauce will cook them and they should be a bit crunchy.

Great recipe! I added a few things:

Grilled yellow onion and green pepper.
2tbs of chilli paste.

Also, once I added the sauce and beef together in the final step...I added 1tbs of corn starch to thinken it up just a touch. Definitely will use this recipe again!

We would give this 6 stars if we could. Absolutely delish!
Here is how I adjusted the recipe:
..Slice meat cross-grain (for tenderness), about 3/4" wide by 3-4" long
..Double the amount fresh ginger ( no powder ginger)
.. Double the fresh garlic (no powder garlic)
.. Use Low- sodium Soy sauce & a lesser  amount than recipe calls for
..when recipe calls for the water, don't be bashful.... Add yours to taste.....I used 3 times the water & sauce was still perfect
.."Flash" fry the meat, truly, almost undercook it, as later, when it is in final simmer it will be plenty done.  Doing it this way also Helps keep the meat more tender.

Delicious: Based on other reviews I made the following  tweaks:
Decreased soy sauce to 1/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce.
Added 1/4 cup oyster sauce.
Decreased brown sugar to 1/3 cup.
Added 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes.
Sautéed following fresh vegetables: 8 oz mushrooms, chunks  red pepper and sweet onion,  broccoli florets.
Served over  chow mien noodles. Because of the addition of veggies and mixing noodles with sauce before mixing all together I doubled the sauce recipe. It was a hit. Left overs heat up well and therefore I would consider doing whole thing ahead of time if I were doing this for  company.

    I have also I used the sauce (thickened with corn starch) as the sauce on a basic cocktail meatball recipe and they disappeared in no time!

I was so impressed with this recipe I had to review it.  No changes,  no substitutions and it tasted just like takeout only better since its not bogged down with foam noodles or onions.  The detailed instructions were extremely helpful!

Great easy quick meal. I do have to day that it is way too sweet. I recommend putting only half the sugar amount and also adding sautéed sweet onions after frying the meat. Sauté the onions then finish the recipe with the meat and sauce added to it. One more thing needs a bit more veggies.

This is a staple in my home now.  I have changed it a bit, like other cooks, its way to sweet as is, I use 1/3 cup or less brown sugar, substitute Yoshidas instead of  the soy sauce, add broccoli, water chestnuts & baby corn.  have also made it with chicken breast.

It is very good.  I followed few of the reviewers' suggestions.  I only use 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar (light brown sugar will be sweeter) and  2 tbsp hoisin sauce.  Quickly fry the beef, once it is  light brown I take it out of the wok, so it will be tender when you cook it with the sauce.  I added carrots and mushroom.

This was outstanding!  We modified it a bit to make it healthier. Used about 75% less oil and half the sugar and it still came out fine.  Added some red peppers, and used top sirloin instead of flank steak. Magnifico. Thank you

Really enjoyed the final product - fresh garlic and ginger are a great combination. I did read the other comments about the sauce being too sweet, so when I got to that step, I added the brown sugar a little at a time and taste tested - for me about half the amount in the recipe was just right. I do think there's an easier method to make this though - I browned the coated beef, then removed it from the skillet to a plate and made the sauce in the same pan before adding the beef and green onions. Simpler clean-up!

Really, really delicious dish! I served mine over jasmine rice. I don't know why the recipe said to cut the spring onions diagonally in such large pieces. Next time I plan to slice them into 1/4 inch slices. The flavor was phenomenal, the beef was very tender, if you don't overcook it. I will definitely be making this dish again and again! Oh, and I am definitely going to double the recipe next time!

Loved this dish!!  I cut sugar to 1/3 cup and added sliced celery, mandarin oranges, mushrooms and peanuts.  I love ginger and added just a little bit more.  Make sure to add the mandarin oranges ( I used the canned) just before serving.  WOW!!!

I didn't have beef so I substituted chicken which worked out fine. The only problem I have with the dish is that it is too sweet for my taste. Next time I will cut back on the amount of brown sugar.

Was looking for something to go with broccoli. This looked good. I substituted 1/2 cup coconut sugar for the brown sugar and gluten free tamari sauce for the soy. My family couldn't stop eating it.
Caution: Be sure and watch the pan if you use coconut sugar.  It can foam and boil over quickly.

My family loved this. I made some changes per the reviews.I doubled the recipe and  used flank steak because others found the meat they used, to be tough, and  only used 2T. of brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup and added 2T of hoisin sauce (found in the Asian section of your supermarket). I also added broccoli and julienne carrots. Delicious. I will definitely be making this again!

It was good. The market didn't have flank steak, so I used 1.35lbs of London Broil. 

I did end up using the sugar called for,  but added it stages.  It wasn't too sweet in the end.

Also, I didn't add Hoisin Sauce, for I wanted to stay with the original recipe as close as possible. 

Also, I think the cornstarch made the meat stick to the bottom of the WOK, so I will use more oil next time, or even use flour instead of cornstarch.

I wanted  to use ground turkey, so I cooked the ground turkey. I cut the sugar to 3 tablespoons and only 1/3 cup low sodium soy.  I added  cooked carrots, broccoli and mushrooms.

Very good recipe! Family loved it. I read the reviews and added 3 tablespoons for brown sugar instead of 1/2 and it was the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. I added broccoli and green peppers. For extra spice, next time I'll add red pepper flakes.

It is a really easy, simple recipe. I maybe thought it was a bit sweet, but my husband LOVED it. We're hunters, so used venison instead.

Notes to self: Don't coat the meat so heavily next time, a bag of broccoli was a good addition. This recipe is enough for four servings, double it if you want enough to pack for lunch.

I was feeling lazy so I didn't put the beef in starch or fry it in oil. I just thinly sliced some left over filet (those Costco packages are so huge!). I put the steak in a skillet, warmed it a bit with no additional oil and then poured the sauce right over the top of it. I let this bubble for a bit then sprinkled in a little flour (was out of corn starch) to thicken the sauce.  Threw together some fried rice while this was bubbling and KAPOW! Fantastic dinner.  Faster and less messy but still fabulous!

A very tasty, yet simple dish.  I added a little chopped chilli in oil to the beef before coating and some local samphire with the onions for a little extra crunch.

We loved this, mid recipe I found I didn't have brown sugar, I used white sugar but 1/2 a cup instead, the sweetness was definitely there but delicious!!  Came out nice and crunchy too.  next time I will add some broccoli, maybe some red pepper flakes and attempt to make more sauce.  The recipe as it is is worthy of 5 stars.

Believe it or not I made this in the oven!  I just didn't use the cornstarch and reduced the liquids to my preference, since liquids can mutually easily in the oven. I covered it with foil and used a meat thermometer. My husband said it was his most favorite meat I've ever made. I was shocked at its simplicity!  My new go-to fast weekday meal. Thanks.

A little too sweet, but nothing that can't be remedied.  I added some red pepper flakes and some rice wine vinegar to even out the sweet/salty combo.  That hit of vinegar really topped it off for us.  I added some sesame seeds for garnish, which was a pleasant touch as well.  We ended up deep frying the beef, which made the cooking part go by so much faster, and ensured the coating stayed perfect - definitely recommend deep frying if you have the option.  Served with snow peas and rice.  Huge hit with the family!

Based on other reviews of the recipe, I cut back the amount of brown sugar to 1/3 C, plus about a Tbs. I also added about a 1/2 C of Hoisin sauce, mostly to the sauce, with  just a bit to the beef as it cooked the first time.  I also sprinkled a little Chinese Five Spice to the beef before I added the corn starch(which I did not measure, just added until it was lightly covered). After removing the beef from the pan and draining the oil, I added just a little red wine to deglaze the pan then added half of a red bell pepper, about 1 Tbs. of diced Serrano pepper,  some frozen peas and only used one bunch of green onions. I served it over PF Chang's steamed brown rice which you can get in the frozen section. It turned out great and I will make this recipe many more times.

Tasted very authentic. Will use less brown sugar next time and add more chili pepper paste. It was a bit sweet. Also, sauteed green peppers, garlic and onion cut into chunks. I threw this in with the sauce.

This was a great dish and a huge hit. I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil to the sauce for a little added flavor.  I sautéed the meat and sauce a little too long but that was my fault with bad timing. Overall, a great dish but not quite as good as PF Chang's.  Will definitely make again!!!!

This was very good - I made a few adjustments to make it a tad healthier.  I coated the meat in chickpea flour instead of cornstarch and fried it in olive oil.  I also substituted honey for the brown sugar.  Came out great!  I served w/ broccoli and we put the sauce on top -but I like the idea of throwing it in while it's cooking - will try that next time.

Too sweet as written. Added "some" (probably a couple tablespoons) of red wine vinegar to counteract the sweetness. Served with broccoli and udon noodles. Was delicious, will definitely make again!

It's hard to give this recipe less than or above 3 stars simply because I did not following the recipe exactly. All ingredients used were the same, but I did reduce the quantity of the brown sugar and the amount of vegetable oil for frying. I halved the recipe (serving size of 2) and reduced the brown sugar used to 2 tbsp. The dish was good, but it was a bit salty  (low-sodium Tamari soy sauce was used) and a little too sweet for our taste. The amount of sauce produced was a perfect ratio for the amount of meat. Unfortunately, I think halving the amount of soy sauce would result in not enough sauce, but perhaps increasing the amount of water would be ok. 

To fry the beef, 1-1.5 tbsp veg. oil will suffice and then there will be no need to remove the beef and drain out the oil. Just add the sauce back to the wok/pan, and then add the green onions. Thanks for sharing the recipe! I'll make it again, but with my adjustments noted in the review.

My whole family loved dinner tonight! I simply followed the recepie step by step and cook some white rice in my power pressure cooker ( which only takes 10 mins for perfect rice! ) It came out soon good that I feel like a chef lol if you haven't tried this yet and we're wondering if you should....go for it!

First, a really big thank you to all the commenters here whose suggestions helped make this a winner of a dish!! Decreased the brown sugar, used low-sodium soy sauce and added the green onions at the very last. We ate it all!! Think l will buy a double portion of meat so we maybe have leftovers next time. It is a messy process but worth every pot l used!! A company-worthy dish!

Wow!  Blows P.F. Chang's version away.  I thought of adding hoisen sauce to the recipe, but remembered the old proverb, "If it works, don't fix it."  I did, however add whole red chili peppers and fried them up with the garlic and ginger.  The peppers were made optional by simply removing them from the dish, and placing them on mine.  Unbelievable...

Very tasty as it is, but I added some chili paste that I had on hand to give it a little zip and since I had some broccoli in the frig, I threw that in as well.  It is on the sweet side, so perhaps will cut the brown sugar next time.  Will definitely make this again.

Just made this and my whole family loved it! Even my 4 year old! Imade it just the way it says and it was perfect. When you are making the sauce just be careful to not reduce it down to much- if you do just add a little water. Overall, definitely a keeper. My husband said don't forget this recipe!!

Delicious! I cut down on the Brown Sugar, per other reviews. I used yellow onion instead of green. I also used Peanut oil instead of Vegetable oil.  It was delicious over Jasmine rice.   I'm new to frying so it was a bit messy but highly recommend.

This was amazing and my fiancé loved it as well. I did use low sodium soy sauce and I think next time I will put less sugar than the recipient says. I served it with steamed rice and it was a hit! Will cook this again soon!

Very tasty! My family of picky eaters even ate it, but it was much too sweet. The sugar could easily be cut in half. I also used ground beef as I had it on hand, still adding the corn starch to thicken it up. Overall it was very good, but I will definitely use less sugar next time

Enjoyed this sauce over rice. I did add broccoli and a large portabello mushroom (sliced). I used a chunk of london broil that was left over.  We will definitely make it again.

Great dish. I added red bell pepper and water chestnuts. The red bell and green onions took on a beautiful color. My only suggestions; add a little corn starch to sauce it seems a little thin. Also be really careful with the beef. It really only needs a minute in the oil. it gets tough quick. 
other wise I loved it. I'm glad I listened to people that said to prep everything first, it made it go very smoothly.

Turned out awesome!!! I added a can of water chestnuts, a container of shiitake mushrooms, and a couple handfuls of matchstick carrots at the end when you add the green onions. It was amazing, we put it over brown rice and my boyfriend said its the best he has had.

Excellent recipe!  However, it was way too sweet for us, so I reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and it was perfect.

Made this for dinner tonight. Definitely a keeper. I followed others suggestions and cut the sugar down. I also added the Hoisin Sauce. It was a huge hit.

Excellent! Definitely glad I read the reviews and halved the soy sauce, sugar and water parts. I also substituted several ingredients: arrowroot powder for cornstarch, braggs aminos for soy sauce, coconut sugar for brown sugar and ginger powder for ginger root. It turned out just as I imagined and will definitely make this again! Gonna pair it with steamed broccoli and just a small amount of brown rice pasta!

So good!!!  Used dried ginger, and added hoisen and chili paste.   Also added broccoli with the green onions. Still needed a bit more sauce at the end so added a little teriyaki.

Definitely tasty.  My family loved it BUT... it's sweeter than the Mongolian beef I grew up with and it lacks the red pepper zest.  I did cut the sugar by about a 1/3 (still a bit sweet for me but really, still delicious) and added red pepper.  Will definitely make it again.

I added some salt to the beef and reduced the brown sugar because the original recipe was slightly sweet for my taste. If you need a little kick you can try adding some cayenne pepper I think it gave it a nice flavor

This was absolutely amazing!!!! Best Asian dish I have ever cooked!!! Followed recipe to the t, only difference was light brown sugar instead of dark brown sugar, and for the meat I used #1 rib eye steaks! My husband said it was better than anything he had eaten in a restaurant, and he has traveled the world!!!

Right away I planned to cut the sugar in this, but it is a good base to work with. Here's how mine worked out: 1/4 cup soy (it's what I had), 1/3 cup golden brown sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp ginger (all I had was powder, so it needed umph), and I added sesame oil when toasting the garlic. Then! I added 1 T sriracha, which was way too much for me. The flavour was great, but it was so spicy I was coughing. I would do it again, but with 1 tsp sriracha to start. (I also used potato starch instead of corn and it worked great)

Added a little crushed red pepper to the sauce to make it a little spicy and added broccoli and orange bell peppers for a little texture and color. Tasted delicious. Definitely a winner.

I made this for my dad and me a few days ago. We love our local Chinese take-out place, but for health reasons we only treat ourselves to restaurant food a few times a year. This was AMAZING! It tasted just like it came from the restaurant! I added in about a cup of thinly sliced carrots, and used low-sodium soy sauce. Also, I didn't have dark brown sugar, so I used light brown and added about 2T of Steen's cane syrup. I heated up leftovers today and added in some steamed broccoli, which made it even more delicious. I am definitely going to make this again. Next time I will add mushrooms as well. Everyone should try this!!

Really good. I am rating a 5, as the only change I made was to add more veggies (some sliced bell pepper and broccoli). And for the sugar, I used a slight 1/3 cup coconut palm sugar and a slight 1/3 cup Stevia in the Raw, to reduce the overall gylcemic impact. That's it - the family enjoyed it, served over a mix of brown basmati and long grain rices.

Great flavor but I think I will change the cooking process at the end of the recipe. The beef had a nice crispiness, but it became soggy/mealy when I allowed it to cook while the onions softened. I think I will try adding the onions to the sauce and cook until soft, then toss with the beef and serve immediately.

A little too sweet will cut down the sugar add more meat, and ginger. The flavor with rice was perfect just a little sweeter than I personally like. Wont stop me from enjoying the leftovers !!

I added broccoli, snow peas, an onion and mushrooms, with 2 dashes of hoisin sauce, and a pat of real butter.  I also added some thin sliced pork with the beef.  I served it over a mixed mashed potatoes/cauliflower.  To die for!

It wasn't as great as I was hoping for. I'll be leaving the Chinese cooking to the local chinese takeout place for now. I followed the instructions to the T ....i guess I should have tried other reviewers suggestions.

Make sure that when you slice the beef you do so against the gain at a 45 degree angle with a very sharp knife. This makes the meat tender and allows it to fry quickly so it's crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. I did the second step first so that the corn starch had time to soak in properly. I also made sure to use a kitchen thermometer clipped to the side of the wok to make sure the oil was at the recommended temperature.

I loved this. Very good and easy to make. It was very sweet I personally liked that but I think my hubby would like it with a few sprinkles of  crushed red pepper on it to give it a kick.  Also I couldn't find flank steak at the grocery store today so I used sirloin. :) will def make again

I liked this better than my usual stir fry.  I used thinly sliced chicken breast, not beef.  I let the cornstarch and chicken sit first then got the ingredients together and made the sauce.  Followed someone else's advice and slowly added the brown sugar to make sure it didn't get too sweet.  Also added a dollop of hoisin sauce.  Perfect!  Served over basmati rice.

Loved this recipe.  Brought the flank steak and pounded it myself.  Next time I go to meat store and have them run it through their machine.  We always like extra sauce, so I doubled the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, water, sugar, cornstarch.  Next time I will use arrowroot flour (health food store), because it thickens quicker. I cut the meat a little to wide.  Next time I will flash freeze the meat and slice real thin.  I was concern that it wouldn't be tender, but it was. I love Mongolian Beef and this was so tasty, that I am getting hungry for it again as I am typing this information.  Easy Easy to do.---Marie

This recipe is very easy to make and it tastes really good. I took another reviewers advice and added frozen broccoli. The only thing I would change next time is to add less brown sugar because it was a little too sweet for my liking.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe! Thank you so much for sharing. The only modifications I made included adding less brown sugar (as many people suggested) and I added some Shiitake mushrooms as well as fresh broccoli to the whole mix.

Wonderful job! This is a super keeper!

My husband travels alot.  When he goes out to eat he always compares the Mongolian Beef to "mine".  Mine always wins.  When you make this make extra because it goes.....fast!  I do not alter this recipe at all.  Be sure to only cook the meat as it says otherwise it can get tough.

I really enjoyed this, little bit too sweet but I just added a bit more soy. The beef was lovely and tender cooked this way. I prepared it before hand as one other reviewer suggested. I would prob season the cornstarch a little next time

This was very delicious. Its a unique flavor...I took the advice of others and i added 1 tbsp of Hoisin Sauce and I cut the brown sugar down. I made a double batch so i used 1/4 cup brown sugar for the double batch...I think it came out perfect...oh i also think i sliced my meat too thick but we still liked it. my daughter didn't like it...she is very picky..she said the "crust was too soggy" maybe that was my error or just her...lol who knows. i thought it was just right :) thank you for sharing

Very, very good, but I should have read the reviews before making it! It was waaaaay too sweet. I will be making this dish again, but reducing the sugar quite a bit.

Other than adding a bunch of veggies, I didn't change anything, and this was delicious. It was not too sweet for me, though it could have used some spiciness.

I made this last night with trader joe's beefless strips. My boyfriend said it was the best thing I've made. I used 1/2 the amount of brown sugar it asked for and just used the oil as needed when frying batches of the "beef" which is why it lost a star because I think it would be way too sweet if I put the amount of sugar they asked for. Besides that I thought it was pretty good and I would make it again.

I found this awesome however I did add my homage hoisin sauce as a touch of added flavor. It works beautifully as a marinade for the beef prior to the cornstarch dusting.

I've just about stopped stir-frying meats for Chinese stir-fry.  For this recipe, I braised a big chuck roast for three hours at 200F, then trimmed and broke up the meat.  Then I added about 1 pound of the cooked, trimmed meat to the sauce from step 1.  So I don't have to stir-fry the beef, and the braised beef is much more tender than the stir-fried.  I like it a lot better, and it has to be more healthy.  For chicken stir-fry, I use roast chicken.  Any excess meat can be frozen.

I also added 6 mushrooms, sliced and stir-fried with garlic and ginger. The mushrooms are really good in this dish. And then the green onions.  Stir it all up in the wok with the sauce from step 1, and serve with brown rice.  

The sauce (step 1):  I agree with jeff97 that the sauce is too sweet.  I'm going to try his method of adding a little sugar at a time.  I tried it with hoisin sauce, but I thought it was too sweet.  If you like it spicy, try stir-frying  four dry red peppers along with the garlic and ginger in step 1.  This adds a lot of flavor without making it unbearably hot.

Just made this with Venison. It was delicious! Didn't have fresh ginger so I used 1/4 tsp of ground ginger and also, used sesame oil. Served it with basmati rice. I thought it was a bit too sweet, next time I'll cut down on the sugar but besides that.... yummy!

Extremely good. Especially if you only use half the amount of brown sugar and soy sauce. It makes the dish a bit healthier and not nearly as overwhelmingly sweet.

Awesome dish. The beef is soo crispy it's delicious. I make lots of chineese dishes like general tso, wontons , sweet n sour chicken , etc n this is the favorite now. Also not bad with chicken. I used New York  sirloin , n top round ,  tastes wonderful.   Flank steak is lil expensive

Delicious! I doubled the recipe, but only used 1 cup of light brown sugar. My family, including my picky 2 year old, gobbled it up. Will definitely make this one again. Thanks!

This was great, i put in 2 Tablespoons brown sugar instead of the 2/3 cup and a Tablespoon of Hoisen Sauce. Added some Broccoli just for some added vegetables. The whole family liked it even the pickey one.

Delicious! I'm glad I read the reviews before I made this because I followed some of the reviewer's tips. I followed the recipe except I cut down the soy sauce and brown sugar a bit because I tasted the sauce before I started cooking it. I also added chunks of onion and yellow and orange peppers to make sure it wasn't too salty it sweet either. I served this with white rice which also helped balance out the flavors. 

My husband loved this as well and suggested that I put more green onions because he really likes them. Will definitely make this again but may try chicken or some other meat. :)

I used one table spoon of sugar and thought it was sweet.  I added Hoisin sauce and garlic plus some chili pepper flakes.  To control the sodium, I used low sodium soy sauce.  Next time I think I'll deep fry the beef.  It splatters something awful.  I also added snow peas, carrots and broccoli to make it a meal. Since I didn't put all that sugar in it, I mixed some cornstarch with soy sauce and used that to thicken and extend the sauce.    Dad thought it was great.  I might drop the sugar all together.

Very good.  My kids said it was like candy... and it was!  overly sweet for me.  I added some garlic chili sauce to my plate and it was much more balanced.  I would half the sugar next time. otherwise, very enjoyable.

This was great. I had to make a couple substitutions. I was out of brown sugar and corn starch. I used confection sugar and flour. Wasn't sure if it would turn out but it turned out great. Hubby wants me to make it again. Thanks for sharing this!

This stuff is the bomb!  And here's how I changed it (LOL!):  I omitted the water and cut back on the sugar a tad.  The sauce will thicken when you add it to the sauteed beef due to the corn starch.  My hubby likes to add the green onions at the very end - no cooking.  

I like to add a teaspoon or two of Sriracha sauce to add some heat.

If you want to cut back on the fat, simply grill the meat, then cut it.  You'll need to thicken the sauce with corn starch if you use this method.

Aweseome!  I doubled or tripled the garlic and ginger.  Also added a TBLSP of Sesame oil to the sauce, as well as TBLSP of red wine vinegar.  Add a small white onion cut Julian style as well to the green onions at the same time (cannot have too much onion).  Add thai red chili or red pepper flakes as well.  Yum.  Best Mongolian Beef ever!

The entire family loved it.  The sauce was sweet, so if you may want to reduce the amount of brown sugar.  Also, it took me more like 45-50 min. to make.

This is a great recipe!  Mongolian beef is my husband's favorite "Chinese food" so I gave this a go.  The first time I followed the recipe spot on and it was great but a bit time consuming and messy.  The second time I skipped the coating and frying and just simmered the meat to break down the fat and it was still great, tho the frying was better!  This is a keeper.

Delicious! We used only 1/2 cup oil and seared the meat in the wok.  Worked fine. We put the meat in the corn flour before heating the sauce-a little time saver.  We didn't have green onions but instead had fresh brocoli and frozen leeks.  We cooked those in the leftover oil from cooking the beef and then threw everything in.  I'll say it again: Delicious.

as soon as i started the sauce, i knew this was gonna be delicious..flank steak at my store is labeled London Broil, so i had to figure that out. i used low sodium soy sauce because my husband and i both have high blood pressure..it was just slightly sweet, but neither of us minded it. i might cut the sugar back a little next time. it was easy to make, and this recipe will be a stand by at my house from now on..although i will have to double the recipe to satisfy my husband!

Fantastic! I too cut down on the sugar. Used about half the amount, and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

I had given up making stir-fry at home because it always turned out ho-hum. Then I found this recipe and I've been converted. It's delicious! I think the secret is coating the beef with cornstarch (and maybe also the 10 minutes absorption time?).

Changes I've made: I always steam broccoli and sliced carrots for 10 minutes at the beginning and set aside, then add them (along with baby corn and the cut up green onions) to the skillet to stir-fry for a few minutes before returning the beef slices to the skillet. 

Tips: It's fine to cook all the beef slices at once (and I use 2 lbs. of beef!). Also, when I remove the beef from the oil I put it in a bowl rather than on paper towels. I used paper towels the first time and it was a nuisance getting all of the paper towel bits off the meat.

My teenage son loves this meal!

Excellent!  I reduced the soy a little and compensated with water.  I also used top round, and not flank steak, and it came out great!

This was really not 5 stars my first try, but I know it can be better.  Next time I'll try half the soy and add some worchestershire sauce.  I won't use dehydrated garlic - either the fresh, or powder instead.  I'm betting this will work just as well using the same skillet for all the cooking - Start with the meat and make the sauce next.

This was way too sweet for the both of us. Over all it is a good recipe but next time we are going to cut down the sugar by either cutting it out completely or just adding a few tablespoons. I will re-rate once we do, I think this recipe has promise. :)

This recipe was very easy and really tasty.  Only complaint is that it has a lot of soy so pretty salty.  I'm going to try it with a low-sodium next time to see if flavor still the same.  A keeper for sure.  I've tried several other recipes and this really has been the best.

Followed the recipe exactly, except added broccoli.  Very very good!  I think there is a lot more sauce than is needed though.  Next time I'm going to marinate the meat overnight with some of the sauce, then saute it with just a little bit of oil then add the rest of the sauce later.  I also think it would be good with some regular onion or more green onions as well as more veggies.

My husband and I loved this dish. I made two mistakes. I didn't realize I needed two bunches of green onions and I'll definitely correct that next time because they were so good I wanted more. I also thought I needed a tablespoon of ginger. oops. Next time I'll try it with a teaspoon, but it was delish just the way it was. 
Fab recipe!!!

My family LOVED this recipe.  I tenderized the beef since I live in Israel and have no idea how to read hebrew so I don't have a clue what cut of meat I am getting.  I will have to triple it next time because I only made 1 1/2 the recipe this time and everyone wanted seconds.

I loved this recipe! made it exactly as it says. The only thing I can say is make sure you take the meat out of the sauce after the 2 min. I left the meat in the pan tell my husband got home and it made the meat soggy. But it had great flavor!!!

I followed the directions...but after it was done, I put it in the crock pot on low with some additional water to make the beef more tender!  Husband and kids loved it!  Next time, I think i will use low sodium soy sauce.

We took an excellent sauce and kicked it up. We grilled a flatiron steak medium rare, sliced it thin and added it to the sauce. We also substituted quinoa for the rice. Can we give this six stars???

My whole family was happy with this recipe.  I used 2 lbs of beef instead of one, and amount of sauce was just right.  We had leftovers that heated up nicely and also the leftover beef went well with ramen noodles.

Very good flavor... but the flank is not the right cut of meat for this dish. Next time we will spend all the money to make this dish AWESOME! We also took the advice of cutting back on the sugar and used 1/3 cup of brown sugar and like I said we LOVED the flavor. Thanks! ;-)

This is wonderful, according to the family - a winner. The only change I made was to cut the brown sugar down to 2 tablespoons, which was plenty for us.

I loved this dish and so did my family!!
I added broccoli per some of the other reviews but other than that I didn't change a thing and saw no reason to.  GREAT end result, everyone was disappointed that there were not more leftovers!

wouldn't change a thing! We loved it. We had some steamed broccoli on the side and it was perfect. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Very good recipe.  I would cut the brown sugar back just a little.  Sure glad I tried this. Excellent.

This is freakin' amazing!  I had to use 1/4 cup of teriyaki and 1/4 cup of soy because i ran out of soy sauce.  It's so good!!!!  My boyfriend LOVED it!

Perfectly delicious!! Needed a little extra starch to thicken the sauce though. Other than that, great recipe

Vesy easy and good. I would give 5 stars but had to correct the over-whelming soy sauce taste in the sauce by adding about a 1 1/2 tsp of Rice Vinegar, which did the trick. (Just an inspired guess on my part but it worked.) Served with Basmati rice and Broccoli. Yum!

Oh my!  This was delicious!  My daughters, 3 and 5, and my husband could not get enough!  It suggests to discard the extra sauce but it is great over brown rice!

Delish! I had to use a few shakes of ground ginger instead of the real thing, but it still tasted like I was at Pei Wei!

OMG!  PF Changs is my favorite restaurant and Mongoligan beef is what I get EVERY time I go.  I was thinking this might be close, but no way can it be as good.  I was WRONG!  It tasted exactly like theirs!  My husband and 12 year old also raved over it too and my hubby took the left overs for lunch the next day...I thought we were going to fight over who was going to get to take them for lunch.  ;)  Definitely a keeper!

yum! i ended up adding broccoli and asparagus, so i doubled the sauce recipe.The sauce did not thicken too much but it was so delicious! it makes plenty of sauce with one batch, did not need to double it.

I made some changes to use what I had in the house but this was absolutely delicious.  I used one red pepper sliced thin, 1 vidalia onion sliced thin, doubled the sauce but kept sugar the same.  Also satueed veggies in oil, removed from pan and then added meat.  Seared then braised in oven for 1.5 hours. Served over rice.  This was the best!!!

Made this last night.  Very good...just a bit too sweet for our taste, will cut down on the dark brown sugar next time. Served with rice.  Over all will make again.....closest thing to going to a chinese restaurant.  Thanks for a good recipe.
