When I made this recipe it was runny and very sweet. I prefer a more dense topping with a little tartness.

Pretty good, but I think it needs more cornstarch or maybe mix the berries with the cornstarch and sugar before spreading in pan.

Super tasty but rather runny. I was hoping for a more crumbly crust but otherwise it was pretty good.

This cobbler was pretty amazing. The crust was very sweet and the sugar coating on top was an awesome touch. Since the recipe called for sprinkling the sugar and cornstarch over the batter I sprinkled some extra cornstarch over fruit before covering it. I also only used 1 cup of sugar in the glaze mix. I didn't have enough blackberries so I also used strawberries. I loved it.

This was a hit with the friends I made it for. It was great except next time I may add some lemon juice to the berries and decrease the sugar to add a bit of tartness.
