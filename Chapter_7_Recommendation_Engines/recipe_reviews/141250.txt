I use less butter and just make a classic rue and then melt the cream cheese into that. Be careful taking this to family functions though, they will expect you to bring it every time!

Made this first time as stated and it was good, but needed a little tweaking. I have used both canned and frozen corn with good results. It was a little runny when made as written so I do add more flour. I like to use fresh jalapenos with the seeds as we like spicy. For a variation of this recipe I have also added rotel and mozzarella cheese. Good side dish and super easy.

I cut the jalapenos in half, only because I have kids, and added one chopped red pepper that I'd sauteed in a little bit of the butter. I also used FF cream cheese. We liked this. Next time, I'd like to do half sour cream.

Next time I will reduce the amount of jalapenos! We were feeling hot, hot, hot from this one! Good flavor though. I used neufchatel cheese rather than cream cheese to cut down on the fat. Without so much heat this would be a great side dish.

My boyfriend and I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Everyone was asking for seconds. We added some fried onion crisps and cheddar cheese and little extra flour to thicken it up.  We also used fresh jalapenos and sprinkled it with cayenne pepper to spice it up.  This will definitely be a regular at family meals!!

I made this along with Black Bean Soup. I added some Southwestern Seasoning to the cream cheese mixture. Family loved it! Great dish to take to a potluck.

This is SOOO good! I literally didn't change this recipe one bit and it was perfect. The hubby accidentally got fat free cream cheese and it was amazing, but I bet it would be heavenly with the normal cream cheese.

Like the person who submitted this recipe I had tried the other version of this recipe, but like this one better. I made the following modifications: did not have milk on hand so I used heavy whipping cream diluted with a little water; I topped my casserole with cheese cracker crumbs tossed in melted butter and seasoned with a little garlic salt.  Even my picky son in law liked this!

Extremely easy recipe that everyone always loves!  I follow the recipe exactly and it is always a favorite.  It is by no means healthy but is great for our large family gatherings a few times a year.
