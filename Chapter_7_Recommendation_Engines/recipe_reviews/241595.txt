I made this great dish! I substituted the sour cream for greek yogurt and added basil sausage, and roasted zucchini and mushrooms! It was to die for!

It needs a little more of something. Just a bit bland.

This is a great recipe.  While I am rating it as a 5-star, I admit that I modified it.  Hopefully, I reduced the calories; I certainly reduced the prep time.  I did not use butter or oil--only the oil on the sun-dried tomatoes.  In addition to cauliflower, I used broccoli and carrots. Instead of roasting the vegetables, I cooked them in the microwave for 5 minutes. I used canned mushrooms and dried basil since neither were on hand. A great quick and tasty lunch meal. Thanks!!
