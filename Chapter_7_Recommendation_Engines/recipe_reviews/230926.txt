It really was that easy! All my attempts at mac and cheese are never as creamy and cheesey as I like them! I've just added some bread crumbs to it and put it in the oven for 15-20 minutes, just because I have the time. My daughter grabbed her bowl before that. Can't believe it was so simple. Thank you!!!

This is a great recipe.  The mac and cheese was very smooth and creamy as well.  I did make some changes to the recipe.  I used 2 cups of water and 1 cup of whole milk instead of the cream.  For the cheese, I used one cup of havarti and one cup of sharp cheddar.  I added a bread crumb and butter mixture to the top after transferring this to a greased pan and baked it for about 15 minutes, but that was just because I had extra time.  It would have been great either way.

It was very fast and easy to make.
I love how cheesy and stuck together it is, however the taste is lacking a little

Guess what? DBF had seconds. Seconds! He doesn't like mac n cheese! So, changed the following....wasn't sure what 10% cream was, I used half and half and had no issues. My milk was 2% if it matters. I used a 13.8 oz box of Dreamfields elbows, and there was plenty of saucy goodness. I used run of the mill pre shredded sharp cheddar, and added 3 strips of chopped bacon at the end. Was generous with seasonings (did add some paprika and a teensy bit of nutmeg) but really just wanted comfort food, and this is IT! So happy I tried this recipe :)

My daughter's new favorite Mac and cheese! I didn't have any cream on hand, so I used 2% milk, still turned out incredibly creamy and delicious. Next time, im going to throw a batch in the smoker.Recipe is so much quicker than the classic way, and less dishes to wash!

This made exactly what I was in the mood for today! I'll add one note for others: I don't normally have cream in my fridge (and didn't today either), but it's quite easy to substitute, especially in this recipe where the percentage is specified. I melted 2 tablespoons of butter and mixed in 7 ounces of skim milk. Also, definitely do 12 ounces of macaroni by volume, not weight. This tripped me up at first, but is a minor issue.

The flavor in this was lacking even after adding extra mustard, garlic powder and a bit of paprika. I did use a good sharp cheddar , ended up adding a bit of Parmesan .

This is super good and easy. I made as written, including the cream. It tastes like plain mac and cheese, which is great (not bland) but it's easy to add spice or anything you want to kick it up.

Instead of using cream I used 4 oz of full fat sour cream and 4 oz 2% milk. The milk I used was 2%. I also added paprika and a bit more salt and pepper to taste and I used 4 oz of cheddar cheese and 12 oz of a blend of sharp cheddar, Monterey Jack, Asadero and Queso Blanco cheeses, basically a Mexican blend. It's really yummy out of the pot but next time I think I'll cover it with breadcrumbs and bake it in the oven!

Yum! I substituted small shell noodles because that is what I had on hand. I needed to add a cup of noodles to make macaroni and cheese and not cheese soup. That was my error and will try again next time with elbow noodles.

This was a GREAT quick stovetop mac and cheese recipe. I've never seen another like it. I did make some changes. I substituted whole milk for the cream at the beginning because we never have cream, and used only 1 cup rather than 1.5 cups of milk at the end. I also whisked an egg into the milk/flour/mustard to help with the thickening. Finished with a few dashes of hot sauce to give it a bit more depth. The consistency was perfect and it was so quick and easy. This will be a go-to recipe in our house.

Surprised at lack of flavor, even w a LOT of extra cheese and salt. I also could taste the uncooked flour. I really tried to like this but I'm going back to my usual recipe which takes the same amount of time with better flavor. Drain pasta, make roux w equal parts butter and flour. Cook for 2 min, and add milk (about 1/2 C) all at once. Whisk til smooth then add cheese. Return pasta to pay and viola! This recipe was an awesome attempt at saving time and used a creative preparation.

This turned out awesome (even though I made it on a Thursday, not Monday, lol!) I was skeptical of the directions, as were other reviewers and read them several times to make sure I was reading them correctly. So I revised the recipe to 8 servings, didn't know what the % of cream was so I used 1/2 & 1/2, used cheddar cheese, put it in a casserole dish, topped with more grated cheese & paprika and baked at 375 for about 15 minutes while the salad was being made. Oh so easy and delicious!

I did not enjoy this at all. It was too bland and soupy for my liking and I followed the recipe exactly using high quality sharp cheddar. I was only able to eat it because I dumped more cheddar and parmesan on top. My 2 year old on the other hand told me it was delicious multiple times. I would consider her a food critic though and will eat ANY Mac and cheese

Good grief, this was excellent and SO easy! My niece requested a 'creamy' type mac and cheese and this was perfect.  I followed the recipe to the letter, using half and half for the cream.  Will make this again and again.

This mac is CRAZY EASY and CRAZY GOOD. The sauce comes out perfectly creamy every time! I'm a cheese fanatic, so I always add extra cheese. I'm also a huge fan of adding sautéed onion/garlic or bacon alone with the cheese and absolutely nothing can ruin this recipe. Definitely an essential recipe in anybody's repertoire!

Really good! Scrambling to make some Mac and cheese since we ran out of instant and this one was perfect! I used 7/8 cup of milk and 1 Tbsp of butter in place of the cream, didn't add the mustard, and added a little mozzarella on top of the cheddar cheese!

So good and so easy! I used gluten free pasta so added an additional cup of water to first step (GF pasta absorbs more water). I used rice thickener (slightly less than called for of flour for same reason). Didn't want to splurge so I used basic sharp cheddar. It was great and will become a new family favorite!

Super easy but a little bland! I'd either use whole wheat pasta or add veggies or both, it gets really rich with the cream sauce added to the enriched pasta. We also had to add about double the salt and 1/2 tsp each of black pepper and garlic powder.
