I love Quesadillas. But putting them in the microwave makes the tortillas ROCK hard when they cool off. Instead, I like to put them in a frying pan, sometimes with butter or olive oil, and brown them. Takes longer, but tastes better.

I make this all the time with corn tortillas. Had no idea it was considered an actual recipe. It takes tops 30 seconds in my microwave. If really hungry, after it is microwaved, I add guacamole, pinto beans, or salsa. It's an easy vegetarian snack or lunch type meal. The corn tortillas are lower in calories than the flour suggested. I also only add about 2 Tblsp. of cheese. I can't imagine adding an entire cup of cheese as suggested in the recipe.

This works just as well with a stovetop griddle or a frying pan. I like using pepper jack cheese.

I love this because you don't dirty up a pan making the kids a snack, just the plate they are eating from! I have taught my 7 year old how to make these for herself and little sister.

My kids (2 and 4 yrs) made this themselves. It is SO simple to make. They ate it all and I can't wait to try it with some added ingredients. Perfect meal for a quick dinner.

This is the way my husband makes quesadillas for our daughter. Actually, she seems to prefer them this way instead of crisped up on the stovetop. However, my son and I prefer them crispy, and it doesn't take much more effort to make them in a frying pan. This will work in a pinch though.

Easy and cheesy. I made this quesadilla with my panini maker. I sprayed one side of a tortilla with Pam, laid it Pam side down on the grill, sprinkled with cheese until tortilla was covered (I'm not sure how much I used but I think a whole cup would be too much), sprinkled hot & spicy taco seasoning over cheese, sprayed one side of the other tortilla with Pam and put it on top Pam side up. Grilled until slightly brown. Pretty darn good! I think using only cheese would have made it too bland and microwaving it would have only made the tortillas hard, not crispy.

I always make these! But I like to use the non cooked ones and make them in the pan. Another fun thing is to roll the quesadilla up and then cut it so they are little swirls :)

I'm in the process of moving next weekend and cleaning out the fridge at the same time. So this was a perfect quick and easy dinner to use leftovers with cheese. Delicious!

The girls LOVED this for lunch today! I didn't measure the cheese and added a little chopped up pepperoni. I only made a half of a tortilla b/c I knew they wouldn't be able to finish the whole one. I only cooked it for about 30 seconds and that was perfect in my microwave. They ate every bite, and that made me happy! The filling posibilities are endless...Thanks for sharing. :)

I followed the steps accordingly and added salt for a bit of extra taste, and this quesadilla was very dry and bland. I donâ€™t recommend this recipe.

This is such a quick and easy thing to prepare. My kids loved them. I prefer mine fried on the stove  (I like it crispy) but these definitely work in a pinch. :)

These are super easy. I do them on the stovetop all the time and fry them in a little oil. I always like to add leftover chicken to make it a little more hearty.

This is the fastest and easiest way to make a quesadilla but not the most flavorful. We always make ours on a cast iron skillet. We use pepper jack and cheddar cheese and we crisp both sides.

Been making for 30 years.  I like to butter the tortilla, add whatever kind of cheese/meat combo, and sprinkle with salsa or hot sauce before rolling or adding the top layer.  You only need to melt the cheese so a fast cook time.  Far better in the saute pan with melted butter for sure.  I LOVE the fresh spinach add...good thought with a white cheese even.  Yumm.  It's the triple threat - Easy - Quick - Good.

Had fun making these with the grandkids. We made them into mummies. Don't forget the candy eyeballs. These work well with flour or corn tortillas.

I have to give this 5 stars, I used to make this when I was working late and would have to pick up the kids from my MIL's (yes they ate there) with no time to make dinner for myself.  Always hit the spot and who doesn't love instant cheesy food!

I guess in a pinch do the microwave thing. They turn out soggy and then chewy as beef jerky when the cool. For best results brush tortilla with oil on one side and place in frying pan oiled side down. Spread a bit of taco sauce on shell, cheese and place another shell on top. Also brushed with oil. Flip over when bottom one is golden brown. Repeat with other side, cheese will be nicely melted and they will be nice and crisp but not crunchy. To put them over the top, try adding bacon bits over the cheese.

Couldn't be easier! I do mine in a frying pan as opposed to the microwave, and use a Mexican cheese blend instead of just plain cheddar. You can add simple ingredients too, like sliced canned black olives, black beans, canned chunk chicken, and salsa for some easy variations.

As PP suggested, I fried the tortilla on the stove top in a little olive oil (1/4 tsp), sprinkled the cheese on, and let it cook until the cheese melted. A tad greasy on the first one, but fine for the second.
