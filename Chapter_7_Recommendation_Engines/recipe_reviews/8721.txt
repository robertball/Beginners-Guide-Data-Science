I grew up in Texas and remember eating this ALL the time as a kid.  My mom's recipe is almost identical, although we do a few things different.  First, add a couple of cloves of garlic to the onion and bell pepper and saute for 5 minutes or so to soften.  I also buy a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from my grocery store and debone the meat and use that instead of chicken breasts - easy and fast :).  Use only 1 cup (1/2 can) of broth, heat that in the microwave and dip the corn tortillas in this (which we tear into strips) before adding to casserole.  Lastly, our recipe has 3 cups of cheese, but we toss that with 3 teaspoons of chili powder and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper.  In a 13X9 pan, layer in this order, 1/2 the chicken, 1/2 the sauteed veggies, 1/2 the dipped tortillas, 1/3 of the cheese mixture, remaining chicken, remaining veggies, remaining tortillas, 1/3 of cheese.  Add the leftover broth (from dipping the tortillas) to the soups and Rotel mixture and pour this over the top.  10 minutes before baking is finished, top with the remaining cheese mixture.  Yummy, yummy, yummy.  If you like more/less spice, you can adjust the cayenne pepper and/or add Tobasco sauce and now-a-days, you can buy the Extra Hot or Mild brands of Rotel.  :)

Wonderful!  My mom had this recipe for years, and now I have it online. :)  Her steps are MUCH easier though, and you DON'T add the broth to the mixture (would make it too soggy, as others have noted).  First, mix the onion, bell pepper, and chicken together.  Layer half of it in a 13x9x2" pan.  Second, heat one can of chicken broth, and dip half the tortillas in (to soften them), one at a time, then layer them on top of the chicken mixture.  Third, add the remaining chicken mixture, then the remaining tortillas (again, dipped in chicken broth first).  Fourth, add the layer of cheese, and sprinkle with chili powder and garlic salt.  Fifth, combine the soups and tomatoes, then add that layer.  Done!  (One tip: I saute' the onions and bell pepper a little bit before mixing with the chicken - I found that if I don't, they aren't quite done enough, even after baking.)  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this using a few of the changes in other comments; cut tortillas into strips, decreased chicken broth to 1 cup and only used to dip tortilla strips, added 2 cloves of fresh garlic, pressed and sauted with onion and bell pepper until onion was translucent and tossed chili powder into cheese before sprinkling on layers. It was sooooooo excellent! Made one for my family and 1 for another and everyone wants more!!!! Next time I will use 2-3 whole chicken breasts and up the cheese to 12 ounces. Still it was EXCELLENT the way it turned out, just trying to tweak it a little more.

Being from Texas I've tried many recipes for King Ranch chicken casserole but this is by far the best my family and I have ever tasted. I did saute the pepper and onion before adding them to the cassserole so they wouldn't be hard. I also dipped the tortillas in the chicken broth and only used 1 can of chicken broth to the casserole and it came out PERFECT. The family is already asking when I will make this again.

I love this recipe!  My family has been making a similar recipe for years.  In my recipe, I use 2 cans of cream of chicken and no cream o mushrooms, & I go ahead and mix the chicken with the sauce rather than layering seperate (saves a step).  I also save some diced chiles and tomates to put on top layer for color.  I hope everyone enjoys this recipe as much as my family does.  It is super easy and quick but wows dinner guest.

This recipe has been in my family for years, but we do not do two layers - just tortillas in strips topped with chicken, topped with shredded cheese (we use 1 lb. Velveeta or mexican Velveeta is even better and so creamy melting)and then pour the soup mixture over all.  I usually make it a few hours before I bake it and the soup mixture always makes its way through the entire casserole and is never too dry at the bottom.  This also allows the flavors to blend well.  It also freezes or keeps in the fridge well this way if you want to bake it the next day or later. A total fave of all my boys!

This recipe is very much like mine. The differences: I use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies (Rotel). I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt; I also sprinkle ground cumin in addition to the chili powder. My family loves this dish.

I prefer to leave out the broth, use 3 cups of cheddar, and add about 1/4 cup coursely chopped cilantro, and 1 large chopped fresh jalapeno.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious. I haven't had king ranch chicken in a while..this was just like I remembered it. People complain about it being soupy, but I just let it cool down for like 30 minutes after I took it out of the oven and it turned out good. I think the answer to the soupy question is not using foil and letting it set after baking it. Do not use foil while baking it or when cooling it.

This is an incredibly flavorful and very easy-to-personalize recipe. I subbed a can of cheese soup for the mushroom, and sauteed the peppers and onions with some spices to soften them, and those worked great for us. I used the full amount of broth and while it was  soupy when hot, the extra liquid was thick and delicious, not watery at all. If you prefer drier tortillas/casseroles decrease the broth, but I think I'll stick to making it this way. Serving with tortillas and rice would work well. Thanks for sharing :)

This is very similar to my recipe which is a variation of the very original King Ranch recipe however, I do not mix the soups with the tomatoes.  I keep everything separate and make three layers.  I found it best to end up with the tomatoes and the liquid on top to protect the cheese from scorching during the baking process.  Top make a complete meal, serve with pinto beans and guacamole salad and Mexican chips.

We had some freezing temperatures today, and I felt like some comfort food when I found this recipe.  My husband was not thrilled about the idea of king ranch chicken for dinner, and my daughter was even less interested, but I made it anyway.  Surprisingly enough, my husband had two HUGE servings, and I got a "thumbs up" from the girls.  Looks like this one will stay in the recipe box.  I did not mix the broth with the soup for a thicker consistency and I added more chili powder.  As for the corn tortillas, I did drench them in the broth for a couple of seconds just to soften them up prior to placing them in the pan.  Yummmy!

For this recipe, I followed the advice of other reviewers and omitted the broth, except to dunk the corn tortillas in.  Instead of chicken breasts, I poached a fryer chicken and cut it up.  As I mixed my ingredients I noticed the recipe does not mention what to do with the corn it calls for, so I added it to my soup mixture.  Also, I used a can of corn instead of frozen.  I think that it would be easier and quicker to toss all of the ingredients, except the tortillas and cheese, in a bowl and mix it all together before spreading on top of the tortillas, without changing the results any.  If you need to save some additional time, I think salsa would work well instead of the canned tomatoes and chilies, onion, and bell pepper.  I only had a 2-quart dish available and it was finished cooking right at 30 minutes.  Also, if the dish seems a little ‘soupy’ let it set and cool a little more and the tortillas will absorb some of the extra moisture.  A very good recipe, I will definitely be making it again.

This has been a family favorite since the 70's.  We use more chili pepper and put all corn tortillas on the bottom, then the chicken, then the sauce and top with cheese.  I also saute the onion and bell pepper with garlic then add it to the sauce.  Fantastic!

I love this recipe! You can add more green chiles to spice it up, leave out the meat and use vegetable broth and 2 cans cream of mushroom to make it vegetarian, it is very versatile, but so good!!

It was really good! My husband gave it a 10! I followed the other suggestions and softned the tortillas in the chicken broth but I wont do that again I personally prefer them firmer than they were. I added more cheese. cooked the chicken on the stove top w salt n pepper n some garlic powder. I also added 1tsp. already diced garlic that u buy in a jar to the onion n bellpepper sauteed all 2gether (just the veggies that is) I would layer everything it it just tastes better. I did add about 1/2 cup of the chicken broth to the mix thats all u need cause it makes it much easier to pour n spread the mix over the other ingredients.

Love the recipe! I have made it several tines and have even used rotisserie chicken and crushed tortilla chips instead of tortillas. Will make it for years to come.

I made homemade corn tortillas today and later went searching for what to make for dinner.  I decided to try this recipe and we were not disappointed.  It was very cheesy (love that) and had a lot of nice flavor.  I tossed the onion in with the chicken when it was almost cooked through.  I am not fond of raw onion so this slight change pleased my family.  We will definitely have this again.  Thank you for the recipe.

The recipes called for a whole onion- but I thought it was a bit too much.  Other than that I liked it, but I probably will never make it again.

I really liked this recipe. Pretty much followed the recipe, except I did saute the onion and peppers, adding some cilantro right at the end. Tore the tortillas (pkg. of 12) into quarters, and layered per instructions. I did let this set-up after cooking, and even though I used a can of broth (about 1 3/4 cups) found the sauce just right. Husband loved, great left-overs!

My family loves this. I double the recipe, make 2 pans, and freeze one for later.  I made this exactly like the recipe the first time and it was great!  The next time I just mixed everything in a big bowl and then poured it into a pan.  It is just as delicious and much faster and easier to make.  We just tore the tortillas into bite size pieces and stirred them right in! This is not soupy at all if you bake it uncovered and then let it sit for 20 minutes after taking it out of the oven.  Thx for the recipe!

I wasn't really sure what to expect from this casserole, but, thought I would give it a try.  If you are a fan of King Ranch Chicken I am sure this recipe is wonderful.  For us though - we didn't like the texture of the corn tortillas in the recipe and it really had that "canned soup" flavor.

This recipe was great! My family gobbled it up!  I liked it because it was really easy and fast to make.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because I felt it was missing a few things.  Next time I'm going to try adding a can of black beans, and chopped cilantro and green onions after cooking.  I did add a cup of sour cream to the soup mixture before cooking.

This is SO yummy. The prep takes a little while but it's still really fun and easy. It's my boyfriends favorite, especially because you can eat it with BBQ sauce.

My family enjoyed this, not as much as my Mexican Lasagna but it was still good.  I reduce the liquid as my son has a bad gag and I was worried about the "soupiness".  I used 1 can of cream of cheddar soup, 1 can of chicken broth and 1 can of Rotel. I also added a can of black beans and a heaping cup of frozen corn to make it complete.  For seasoning I used 2 tbsps of homemade taco seasoning and 1 tbsp minced garlic. It was fine for the kids not at all spicy, next time I would add more. I also seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and taco seasoning before baking.  I had corn and flour tortillas and some taco shells in the freezer, I cut them all up into pieces, putting the corn on the bottom and the flour on the top.

Excellent recipe with great flavor. I have to admit I'm a Texas girl that's never really liked King Ranch Chicken. It was a little time consuming but well worth it! I added just a pinch of cayenne pepper to give a little kick but no other changes. It was super yummy!!

4 stars as written. I adjusted to our tastes-- no broth. Sub sour cream, about a cup, instead. 1 sm can tomatoes with chilies, 1 16oz can diced tomatoes. The liquid from the tomatoes made the mixture thin enough without the broth. Skipped the pepper, used more onion and my homemade Mexican seasoning. Layered in the cast iron skillet I cooked the chicken in--oh and used cojack cheese.

I thought this was to soupy and I wasn't real thrilled with the flavor but my hubby and my 2 boys devoured the casserole so I guess I'm in the minority here. Topped with lettuce and sour cream. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was great! I did sautee the bell pepper and onion before layering the ingredients. I also used a can of broth which is 1 3/4 c and the consistancy was perfect. Also to reduce fat I used 98% fat free soups and reduced fat cheese. I will definitely make this again.

Pretty good stuff though not "great."  It was a little soupy, yes, but it helps to let it sit for a bit, and it wasn't soupy at all the next day for leftovers.  I thought it was spicy enough and I even left out the green pepper and used plain canned tomatoes.  The second time I made this I used all cream of chicken soup, which I believe I liked better.  And I got in the middle of it and realized I had no corn tortillas and used flour.  I did like the flavor of that better, but they are difficult to cut with a fork while trying to eat it, so I don't think that works well.  I did use less tortillas than called for both times, enough to make the two layers without a lot of overlapping.

Delicious!  Family loved it.  Will make again soon.  Only thing I did differently was to tear the tortillas into about 5 or 6 pieces.  Also, I split the recipe between 2 8X8 dishes, refrigerated over night, and cooked one the next day for dinner, and took the 


other one to my parents.  They loved it too.  Easy recipe.

This was very good. I cut the recipe in half as I'm one person. I also had to tweek it a bit for what i had on hand and it turned out really good. I used one can of cream of chicken soup. Instead of chicken broth I used half a cup of milk and half a cup of sour cream. I still used the whole can of tomatoes. Normally I wouldn't do the following but I was not in a cooking mood so I used forzen grilled chicken strips by tyson and frozen chopped green pepper and onion. I defrosted the chicken strips on the stove in the skillet and for the last couple of minutes threw in the pepper and onion. I also used a mexican blend of shredded cheese and tortilla chips instead of tortillas. Put in the oven for about 20mins. Turned out really good! Will definatley make this again.

This was okay, as others stated I left out the broth and dipped the tortillas in it instead. Thickness was still a bit soupy, but better after it sat awhile out of the oven. I think if I made it again I'd leave out the tortillas all together and use rice instead.

This was a wonderful chicken tortilla casserole. Very easy to prepare with ingredients usually on hand, I used a bag of toasted corn doritos and it came out great. I used 5 chicken breasts instead of measuring and saved the broth they cooked in to make this. I used a frozen fajita blend (green & red peppers, onions) and sauteed that in a little olive oil until it was tender-crisp and then added a clove of minced garlic. I went ahead and put the garlic powder and chili powder in the broth mix. I still sprinkled a little over the top, but only a very light dusting of either, the majority of it was in the broth part. I made a pan of this for hubby's Christmas luncheon and he said everyone raved and there are no leftovers.

Not as tasty as I had hoped.  The tortillas got all mushy and I don't think the flavor was spicy at all.  It wasn't bad, we ate it - it just wasn't all that good.

I made it pretty much how the recipe called EXCEPT I did saute the onion and green pepper AND I mixed all the ingredients with the exception of the tortillas and about 1/3 of the cheese, together.  layer tortillas, half the mixture, another layer of tortillas, rest of the mixture, top with the 1/3 of the cheese that was left.  PERFECTION!  We lived in South Texas for six years and I have had this millions of times, this is the best recipe I have come accross.

This recipe comes the closest to the one I have been using for years. I use minced garlic instead of garlic salt and I also add a tsp of ground cumin to the mix.  Something else I add is fresh cilantro.  I use a 4 cheese Mexican blend that melts better and isn't as greasy as cheddar.  I read the other recipes and cringed when I saw them using chips, lettuce, flour tortillas.  I'm sure there are as many recipes for King Ranch Chicken as there are for curry, but this transplanted Texan prefers her chips with salsa, her lettuce in a salad and flour tortillas wrapped around a good taco truck burrito.

I made this tasty dish for my family and everyone loved it! I did follow some suggestions. I used one cup of chicken broth instead of 2 as I didn't want a "soupy" casserole. Also, I did not cover with foil either. In addition I sauteed the onion and bell pepper prior to mixing. One more thing, I mixed the chili powder and added one teaspoon of cumin powder with the soup mix. I don't like salty so I omitted the garlic salt and just added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to the soup mix too. If you have children who don't like spicy foods you can reduce the chili powder. However, the can of diced tomatoes and green chili peppers will also add to the spiciness of the dish.

Gave it 5 stars for the way I made it. This is basically the recipe my grandma gave to me years ago. I left out garlic and chili powder and used flour tortillas (I do NOT like corn tortillas).  Also, I mix all of the ingredients together (except cheese and tortillas) and then layer tortillas, mixture and cheese. My family loves this recipe. Also when I cook the chicken I boil it in water with herbs, celery, pepper and chicken bullion. Then instead of separate chicken broth I just use the liquid from the pot. Good Recipe.

This was really delicious. I followed the recipe fairly closely although I made changes along the way for personal taste. I used less chicken broth than suggested because I added it to the soup until it looked right. I didn't want it to be too soupy. I also just put enough tortillas on the bottom of the pan until it covered. I added the spices to the soup and just eyeballed it, but also included some extra spice. I put garlic and onion powder in most recipes. It does come out of the oven a little soupy, but if you can, wait the 20 minutes and it will firm up. I actually made mine the night before and then cooked it the next day and it came out great! I will definitely make this again :)

This is a great recipe, thank you!  I sautéed the onions, garlic and peppers in a little of the chicken broth and mexican chili powder as well as cayenne and black pepper.  Also added the chili powder, cayenne, pepper and cumin to the soup mixture with only a cup of the chicken broth.  I substituted the corn tortillas for chips and it worked out perfect!  Definitely let it sit for a couple of minutes. Even better the 2nd day!!!

I took some of the suggestions made by other reviewers and this recipe turned out excellent. I dipped the tortillas in the chicken broth, but did not add the broth to the mixture and I sauteed the onions in fresh garlic before adding them to the soup mixture. Also, I only made one set of layers in a 15x10 dish: softened corn tortillas (I only used 6), chicken, cheese, soup/tomato mixture, more cheese on top. I only used about 6 oz. cheese and that was plenty for us. The cheese tasted great blended with the soup and I'm glad I did *not* use velveeta, which is what I would typically expect in King Ranch Chicken. 

I also sprinkled some cumin, paprika and chili powder on top and left out the garlic salt, thank goodness, because the dish was plenty salty as-is. All in all a this is a delicious, filling recipe that tasted even better as leftovers.

This is the lowest rating I have ever left...I took others suggestions added more cheese...put sauce on the bottom. I guess if you like across between a chicken pot pie and Chicken helper  this would be the dish for you.  Not good at all.  No one in my family finished there meal.

I added black beans and did it with mild salsa for the tomatoes and pepper omitted the chicken broth used flour tortillas cut into strips, Mexican cheese, 1 tsp of cumin, 1tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and it was good my 13 year old loved it but I have high blood pressure and could taste all the salt so I probably won't make again unless it is for an event not in my home.

I love this recipe-I only left out the chili powder and just seasoned the chicken with a little garlic powder and black pepper.  I also substituted scoop hard tortilla chips, crushed, because that's what I had-it was great-of course, the chips softened during baking in the sauce, so it turned out great.  Love this recipe!

This was so tasty!!! My family loved it. I made a few changes I boiled and shredded the chicken instead of cubes.  I reduced the chicken broth by half based on other reviews to avoid it being to watery. I also omitted the bell peppers. I mixed the soup mixture and chicken before layering in the pan leaving some if the soup mixture to the side to pour on top. I topped the casserole with another layer of tortillas, sauce and cheese to really top it off. I will make this dish again.

I really wanted to like this and it has a lot of potential but it did not work out for me. I'm thinking I should have cut the tortillas into strips, cooked the bell pepper and onion before adding it to the layers and cooked it longer altogether. For me this was runny, the soup mixture didn't seem to set. Runny on top of crunchy undercooked onion and bell pepper made for a night of indigestion. Even the tortilla didn't cook, you would think 40min in the oven with the soup mixture would have turned them to mush but no, chewy. Will try this again but not this recipe.

It was yummy!!!
I seasoned the chicken before baking; salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, paprika.
It really made a difference.
Better when it sits for a bit, not directly from the oven.

It was a little too limp for me - next time I'll use chips as others have tried.  I'll also add much more spice - the mushroom and chicken cream was a little overpowered the chili and I want more flavor.  But still good.

This is almost identical to the recipe I got from family down in Kingsville, TX. The only difference that we make is to cut the tortillas into strips before layering, and we don't use chicken broth--just more cheese.

It was okay. My boyfriend and I liked it but we've had better. Too many tortillas! I also took others' suggestions and cut down the broth to only about 1 1/2 cups. Came out with just the right amount of moisture. Needs more cheese (according to my boyfriend)and I cooked for about an hour. I would recommend either covering the corners so your edges don't get too cripsy. I will make again but with less tortillas, a bit more peppers and onions, and more cheese for the bf!

Yum, this was great! I made 2 8X8pans and froze one. Things I did different...I sauteed the onions, peppers cubed boneless chicken with garlic, added a little bit of taco seasoning. Used broken taco shells soaked in the broth. then layered taco shells,chicken and veg, cheese. Poured the 2 soups on top then added xtra cheese. Left out the rotel, my son doesnt eat tomatoes. But I topped mine with hot salsa.

this is an easy and quick recipe, that I made with frozen chicken breast, which are very handy to keep around. I might mix the garlic salt and chile powder in with the soup mixture next time. A winner!

My husband and I thought this was very good, but a little too spicy for the young kids.  I followed other's suggestions to cut the chicken broth down to one cup.  The casserole was a little soupy, but after 1/2 hour of sitting out it was fine.  I would definitely make this again.

I read many a review about too much liquid/too soupy. I made mine a day in advance, and figured the corn tortillas would soak up liquid. So, I ended up using 1 1/2 cups broth. It was good, but maybe 1 cup would be better.

I used double cheese. I 8oz bag medium medium shredded cheddar and 1 8oz bag mexican blend shredded cheddar cheese. I mixed the cheeses in a bowl and tossed in the chili powder and garlic salt, to evenly distribute the flavor (rather than just on top). IT was great.

The recipe makes a big batch. Next time, I will split in into two smaller pans. 1 spicier for adults and 1 regular for kids.

I forgot bell pepper and it was still good.

We served with olives and sour cream with a salad and corn on the side.

Bonus, it was even better the next day (Saturday lunch).

We'll be making it again. This is the first mexican style casserole my husband has ever liked.

Great recipe! As others have stated, I've changed mine up a bit.  I always use flour tortillas (ripped into pieces) which I would think absorbs better than corn tortillas.  I use the broth from boiling the chicken pieces and then only about 1 cup.  I omit the onions and bell peppers – that’s just too much work for this simple dish! I use Tony Chachere's seasoning instead of the ones mentioned. Although this recipe has always been a family favorite - I switched to the Extra Hot Rotel tomatoes a few years ago and being Cajuns in Texas – we really liked the extra hotness!

This was good but the two cups of chicken broth made it a little bit too soupy. I would try it with just maybe one cup total. I also added some sour cream to the soup mixture to make it thicker. Great quick meal and nice and creamy!

Very good!  Had great flavor.  I did change some things.  I already had flour tortias so I used them instead of the Corn Tortias.  I increased the cheese to two cups.  I also put some seasonings in the soup mixture (red pepper, garlic salt & cajun seasoning)to spice it up.  My husband & I enjoyed it.  I will make this again.

Overall, this was very tasty.  Mine came out a little runnier than I would have liked.  Next time I will drain the Ro-tel tomatoes.  Some of my bottom tortillas were tough, so think I will put a small amt. of sauce in bottom first.  I wanted a little more umph, so added hot sauce to my serving.

I used already cooked southwest flavored chicken and doubled the cheese
and it was  easy, quick and delicious.  It was a real hit.

Quite bland I think...needed a bit more kick.  There was not enough cheese at all.  You might want to triple the amount of cheese the recipe calls for.  Having Wisconsin roots...there is no such thing as too much cheese!!

Great recipe!  I made it for a progressive dinner and it was the hit of the evening.   I would have liked it a little bit spicier.  Perhaps some extra jalapeno peppers or hot sauce on the side? Overall, though it was Muy Bueno!!!!!

Delicious recipe! However, I found I like it a little dryer and do not put as much of the broth as it calls for.  Preparation time could be alot shorter if you have a food processor and boil the chicken in advance.

I love this recipe. My only changes are to reduce the chicken broth to 1 cup and I also dip the corn tortillas in the broth. I also cook the onions and bell peppers in a skillet before mixing it with shredded chicken. Great recipe, it is even better the next day.

This is a easy recipe and I will use it again, but I will add a hotter version on the diced tomatoes and green chile pepper. I loved putting in the raw onions and green peppers, but my husband did not. So I might saute them some before I put them in the recipe. The recipe was a little soupy but the next day it was better. So if you eat it right away you might want to decrease the chicken broth to a cup. Enjoy

De.Licious.  I've had King Ranch Chicken once, so I don't have anything to compare this to -- but this tasted *amazing*.  I ended up boiling about 1 lb. of boneless, skinless chicken tenders in 4 cups of water with 2 bullion cubes, and shredding the tenders -- I wish I'd had more chicken!  After I took out the tenders, I then used that broth (which boiled down to maybe 3-ish cups, but I still just measured out 2 cups), and added the soups to the pot.  All I had on hand was a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, so I drained out that liquid & ended up using all of that, plus I used half a bag of the frozen bell pepper/onion mix from my grocery store -- perfect.  I sprinkled Mrs. Dash chipotle seasoning on top after everything + a bit more salt, baked it at 350 for 35 mins (then kept it on warm for the next hour bc we had to run out of the house) -- Fabulous.  Thanks for the recipe!

I literally JUST made this--it's not too bad. I'll happily eat it for most of the week, but I can see where there are a few issues.  First, I used more tortillas than was probably called for (I used corn tortillas, by the way). It does border on runny, but with all the extra tortillas they did a good job soaking things up. If you were to use flour tortillas, or just less tortillas in general, definetly cut back on the stock, and at least hold the lid of the rotel in place to drain the can a little bit.  Spice-wise, I found it a bit one-note. Extra onions and bell peppers next time, maybe.

This is a great recipe. Instead of the can of tomatoes with chili's ,I used a medium hot tomatoe salsa and use half the chicken broth.You will not need the chili powder.It gives it a nice kick.

This recipe was very good. It wasn't runny at all and stayed together nicely. I will add more chili powder and garlic salt next time. Maybe cook the chicken with some Tex-joy to add more seasoning. Overall a good recipe that will definetly be put into regular rotation. Thanks!

This recipe I have used for years, and do several variations. I like for it to have a real authenic mexican appeal. When I simmer the soups, and rotels together I like to add cumin,chili powder, mexican seasoning,a little garlic powder, and some fresh chopped cilantro.Sometimes I  will use tortilla chips instead of tortillas.Top with some mexican blend cheese for more zestiness, dried cilantro and some jalapeno slices.You can garnish with a dallop of sour cream too.

Sorry this dish just didn't work for us. I read the reviews and reduced the amount of broth as suggested, but still turned out very soggy and soupy. I don't think I will make this again.

I grew up in Texas & love this stuff. I disagree with the reviewer that said drain the Rotel, you don't. I did only use half of the chicken broth (homemade). Used Healthy Request soups to help with the sodium. Yum, & a great way to use leftover Beer Butt Chicken. Even better for lunch the next day.

Did not have a lot of flavor.  Also I used less than half the broth that was called for and that was a little too much.  If anyone else has the same experience I'll tell you what I did with the leftovers.  I took a smaller casserole dish and layered the original recipe,  then sour cream, chopped canned chile peppers, black olives and I added cumin and ground red pepper.  Added cheese just before taking it out of the oven.  NOW it was very good.

This is pretty easy to make.  I've added some changes of my own.  First, I use a 9x13 pan instead of the casserole and tear the tortillas in half or quarters to fit into the corners where the round edges don't fit.  I saute the onion before adding to the layers so it isn't crunchy.  I don't like bell peppers, so those are left out.  And last, I cheat by either using an already roasted chicken from the grocery or the chunk white chicken breast in the large can (2 cans, broth drained).  I find cooking it in the thinner pan (one I would use for lasagna) the sauce thickens nicely.  This does have the most authentic taste I have found!  Tastes even better the next day.  I usually serve it with a nice Spanish rice.

I tried this recipe for dinner two nights ago and thought it was wonderful! The only thing I did not do was add fresh onion and bell peppers (i did not have any).  I agree with the other reviews that it was a little soupy so I may add less broth if at all.  Overall it was really good and we all enjoyed it!

Just like mom made growing up.  Used white corn tortillas and a red bell pepper, very colorful.

This was excellent. I did make a few changes though. I didn't add the green peppers or the cream of mushroom. It was still very tasty. I will definitely be making this again soon.

This is a great dish. I did not get the recipe from this site, but it is almost exactly the same.  I do not add the green pepper (personal preference).  My recipe does not add the chili powder and garlic salt on the top.  I will try this the next time I make this dish.  I top it with a little sour cream (sometimes a little salsa) and serve with Mexican rice and beans.

My husband just loves this recipie.  He smiled like a kid last time I put it in the oven.  I usually make this with flour tortillas instead of the corn tortillas.  The corn tends to get a little mushy too quickly.  Other than that, I follow the recipie as written.  Not overly spicey (although not for weak stomachs), so for those that want a little extra kick add in a little hot sauce of your choosing.

This was only okay. I have had similar casseroles that were much better. After my husband and I tasted it, we thought it was a little mushy, so we crunched up some tortilla chips on top and added a little sour cream and that made it better.

I followed this recipe exactly and it tasted great!  I was truly surprised at the amount of flavor.  I was also worried that there was not enough soup mixture, but it worked out perfectly.  Only change I will make next time is reduce the amount of onion and green bell pepper or saute first to make them a bit less crunchy.  I did not find the recipe soupy once I let it cool for about 20 minutes.  Definitely worth making and I will make again.

My husband was skeptical at first but once it came out of the oven he loved it!  Didn't use what the recipe called for so this wasn't too soupy.  Only variation next time would be to combine chili powder in with ingredients for an all over flavor.

King Ranch Casserole is probably one of my favorite dinners. My mom makes it frequently and it makes for great leftovers. We have also made it for friends who have asked us numerous times to make it again! This is almost exactly like our recipe, although we use a whole chicken as opposed to just the breast, and we haven't thought to put garlic in it (what a great idea!). We also layer slightly differently: chicken, tortillas, sauce, and cheese, which makes it super cheesy (and tasty).

i would definitely cook this for an hour as opposed to the 30-45 minutes suggested. i cooked it for 45 minutes, 15 uncovered and 30 covered, and it was a littly soupy after the 45 minutes. all in all GREAT though, my husband LOVED it!

The family really like the recipie.  Next time I am going to take out the tortillas and chicken broth all together.  The tortillas were too soggy.  I'm hoping taking out the chicken broth will thicken up the dish.  Next time I am going to serve with chips for a crunch.

This is very easy to make.  My husband loved it! 

Things I did differently:
I marinated the chicken in lime juice, honey, chili powder, a little olive oil and pepper before sauteing it.  I left all of the juices from cooking in the chicken when I mixed it into the casserole.
I mixed the chicken in with the two cans of soup and Rotel to make it easier to prepare.
I sauteed the peppers and onions for just a couple of minutes so they wouldn't be crunchy.
I only used 1/2 cup of broth when mixing the soup.  The rest I used to soak the corn tortillas, which I cut into eighths, for just a couple of minutes before adding the tortillas to the casserole dish.  I discarded the rest of the broth.  I found this to be a perfect consistency.  It wasn't at all soupy...just creamy, and the tortillas were not chewy at all.
I probably used more cheese than it called for.

Things I would do differently next time.
Grill the chicken for more flavor.
Put more green chiles and chili powder in it...it wasn't really spicy enough for my taste (I live in Texas and am used to the heat!).

Other than that it was great.  I served it with a salad of romaine, a few beans (I used Ranch style pintos), corn, cheddar, salsa and a dressing of lime, honey, olive oil and ground pepper.  Very tasty!

This was just "okay" as far as my family and I were concerned.  I skipped the broth, let it sit and it was not soupy but it just tasted like rotell--not much else.  I even used 1/2 pepper jack cheese and it didn't do much for the flavor.  I'm not sure what we were expecting.

I'd rather spend the same amount of time/energy making chicken enchiladas for something spicy or a creamy chicken divan casserole for something savory.  
I'm glad I tried it as I had never had King Ranch before, but it just wasn't our thing.

Smells and tastes good, but the consistency was a little too soupy for me.  I'll keep the recipe but use less broth next time.  Also, I added a can of black beans for extra fiber and my husband loved it!

This recipe was really good.  It was the first time we had this.  It was a mix of a taco and enchilada casserole taste. Since I made it just for two we had lots of leftovers.  Since we like leftoevers we were happy... only to find out this dish doesn't reheat well. The tortillas get soggy and taste funky. So if you are making it for a few people, split the recipe up- cook one half and freeze the other half. This recipe was good, and we will make it again!

Very good...somewhat soupy, as others have mentioned, in spite of my using only 1/2 can chicken broth.  Next time I will also let it sit after baking like lasagna needs to.  I think I will also try making more layers (perhaps four instead of two?).

Made this today and my family just loved it.  I used Ro-tel.  I forgot the chili powder but then again, I don't like it.  I didn't use broth or bell peppers.  I used a mixture of jack and cheddar cheese.  It is a little bland, but still very good and comfort food.

Very good.  I used tortilla chips and they worked great.  Like others I did not use the broth, however, I did pour an additional can of Rotel tomatoes over the top of the casserole.  Since I used the tortilla chips I think I needed the additional moisture and it worked beautifully.

Awesome recipe, we loved it.  However next time I will do a few things different.  I let mine cook for 35 min & that wasn't quite long enough.  My onions were still a little crunchy.  Also, I will let stand for a few minutes after it comes out the the oven.  My boyfriend cut into it right away and that left it a little soupy. The soup didn't have time to thicken.  Great recipe though...Thanks!

I don't understand the hype with this one.  Boring, soggy, bland- and I even used halapeno cheddar.  And all the King Ranch Chicken Casseroles look approximately the same. I'm going to try the burrito pie next time.

I made this recipe as written. We really liked the flavors, but the texture was a problem for us. It was soft in texture and would benefit from some crunch. My son said he wished it were a dip that he could eat with tortilla chips. No one took seconds, I will be feeding the leftovers to our chickens today. I won't be making it again. If you try it, be aware that a 9"by 13" pan will not be large enough, my lasagna pan was just the right size.

Wonderfully good. Great flovor. The only changes I made were to use a freshly boiled deboned chicken and the strained broth from it. Also fresh garlic instead of salt. Yummy! Recommmended!

Note:  the recipe is for TORTILLAS not "Tortilla chips"!!!It helps to cut the tortillas in half and fit the flat edge along the pan for easier slicing.

I decreased the amount of broth used and put a small amount of the soup mixture into the pan before starting the layers.  I also used 1/2 as much chili powder and added cumin to this.  It was perfect!!  Will definatly make again.

Delicious. I used a 14 oz can of chopped tomatoes with no green chiles, and added some sliced black olives. Served with corn muffins. Great.

I thought this was really yummy..I had it years ago at a friends house in Houston (Texmex country)and could never find my recipe and this one came close.  I do agree that it was a bit dry and I doubled the cheese.  VERY YUMMY-even more so the next day!!!

Very tasty.  I have been raving over how good this recipe is for years and I had lost my copy of it so I hadn't made it in 5 years.  I found this one and prepared it and my oh-so picky husband loved it.  I recommend this to everyone!!

It was great. I added more seasoning. I added Cumen and the other seasoning, Garlic salt, and chillie powder to the soup mixture. Then I also added seasoning on top. Without it, it would have been bland.

Made this exactly as is, last night and it was delicious!  If anyone knows of a healthier alternative to the canned soup, I'd be interested in hearing about this.  We are doing our best to wean off the processed food but it isn't easy.

This was an absolute hit in our house! I worked with the ingredients I had on hand (so, no peppers and only half an onion). I also used tortilla chips that my daughter crumbled for me and shred a rotisserie chicken I got from Publix. It was so good, that the leftovers I’d planned to warm for the next night’s dinner did not survive. Even my pickiest eater (my daughter) got seconds. So good and so easy!

Instead of tortillas I used left-over bowtie noodles.  As someone else suggested, cooked onions and peppers until soft and used less broth. We  really enjoyed this recipe and will have it again.

As a south Texan, I want you to know that this is a very traditional King Ranch Casserole except for the excessive broth and chili powder. I would strongly suggest that you saute' the onions and green peppers prior to adding them. Otherwise they will still be too raw when the casserole is done....that is unless you like them crunchy.

Great taste; the whole family loved it.  A couple comments were that it was a bit mushy, and I notice this recipe had a lot of liquid compared to some other similar recipes, so may combine recipes next time only to cut back the liquid slightly.  Otherwise an excellent casserole for a snowy weekend!

One of my family favorites, we have tweaked the recipe to fit out taste.  For one,  we use flour tortillas and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, we also use velveeta cheese rather than the cheddar.  Make it at least once a month if not more often. We also mix it altogether before baking, no layers.

Came looking for this recipe since mine is still packed after a move. Grew up with this dish here in Texas but we especially made use of it the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas when everyone is so sick of turkey. Chop the leftover turkey in pieces then follow the recipe using corn tortillas dipped in warm chicken broth or the broth off of the turkey if there is any left over. It is a great way to disguise the left over turkey and a real change from the regular food festivities! We always looked forward to it.

So good! I followed the suggestions of others and it was a hit! I added chili powder to the cheese, 1/2 cup of broth, sautéed the onion garlic and bell pepper (red and green). I only wish it was a little thicker, maybe next time I will add sweet corn, more tortillas and less broth. But delicious!

Not my favorite flavor. To much chicken ingredients for my liking. Between the chicken soup, chicken broth, and the actual chicken. The sauce was very liquidy. I also added rotini to it, and good thing because that soaked up some of the sauce. Overall easy dish to make, I would just modify it a little more next time.

Not very flavorful and it didn't stand up much.  Kind of soupy.  It just wasn't something that I would make again.

This was great I of course used a rotisserie chicken and I made my own cream of mushroom soup.  it was even better reheated in the microwave.

The recipe, as it is, is good, but I added paprika, taco dip mix, and used a bag of frozen fajita mix vegetables instead of the chopped onion and bell pepper. I sautéed the veggies with some chicken stock and cilantro. It added another layer of flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I halved it & I omitted the garlic salt entirely.  I didn't have a problem with the casserole being too soupy or too soggy.  It looked great.  My problem was that it was so salty neither my husband or I could eat more than a few bites.  Since no one else here seems to have had that particular complaint, I wonder if the chicken broth I used was abnormally salty.  There would have been enough leftovers for another meal, but we ended up throwing them away since we couldn't eat it the first time.  I would like to try making it again, but I will use salt-free or salt-reduced ingredient next time.

Great recipe and easy to make.  I recommend using roughly half the chicken broth the recipe calls for because it was a little soupy.  Awesome flavor...I added some fresh jalapeno slices on top. Yum.

I made this just last week and eveyone including the kids liked it.   I did add my own twist to it by using what I had on hand such as a red and yellow peppers.  I also cut up flour torillas and added black olives to give it more color.  I used cheddar jack cheese as well.   Easy recipe to double for a crowd. My husband ate his by scooping the casserole with torilla CHIPS and making it a finger food.  Will make again.

Boy! this was great! The only change that I made was inadverdent --- I misread the recipe and used tortilla chips :) and it was still good. Well I also only used one can of chicken broth. Anyway, the flavors in this recipe were nice and balanced with just enough spice. Thank you!

This was average.  I have never had King Ranch Chicken before but I see recipes for it all the time.  The dish just isn't a "wow" to me.  I don't think it had anything to do with the recipe, it was just the dish itself.  I gave the leftovers to a friend and she loved it.  She couldn't get over how good it was.  So, it must have been me-it maust be a great recipe!

I thought this was a tasty, easy, good recipe. I added fresh cilantro as I actually had some on hand. As with other reviewers, I did things a little differently, and was very happy with the results. I do recommend baking the tortillas until crispy. Mine kept their shape and didn't disintegrate. I would definitely make this again!

Very tasy. I cooked 3 chicken breasts with about half a yellow onion and 3 cloves of garlic. I omitted a cup of chicken broth and used two cans of cream of chicken (instead of one of each). Otherwise I cooked it the same. 350 for 30 minutes!

We  adjusted this for 30 people and it worked. Also it was a great hit, what was left over people put in a bowl and took it home.  We used two big trays from the store, the kind that had an extra wire handles on the side, it helps because this dish when fixed for 30 people is heavy. We also prepaired it the day before and put it it in the fridge and took it out for supper, put it in the oven warmed it and cheesed it and loved watching folks eat a hot steaming meal.  We also boiled 4 chickens (whole) for this meal and it was plenty.

This is always a pleaser with my whole family of 6, which in itself is a miracle!  I prefer the tortilla's sliced into strips.  I just use my pizza cutter and zip through them.  I make a side dish of spanish rice or chips and salsa.

Very Rich and Soupy!  It is an OK recipe..I may make it again with some needed adjustments.  It ended up soupy even though I dipped the tortillas in the chicken broth rather than adding the chicken broth to the soup mixture.  It may have been better had I cut down on the soup a little and added more cheese.

I used corn chips instead of tortillas for more body and drained liquid from the Rotel.  I also used dried onions and they worked fine.  A big hit at our house, I think this is going in the dinner rotation!

I learned about this dish from a restaurant.  I keep the recipe almost as it is.  I do saute the chicken with olive oil, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I also saute the diced onions.  I add about 3/4 of the chicken broth.  As a cheese lover, I do double the amount.  Overall my house loves it and it is easy to make.

This was great!! I have little children and the rotel was a problem... so next time i will omit rotel and add only diced tomatoes and some spices.. chili or maybee taco seasoning.  I did do changes via other coments.  I made only a few layers, botom layer was tortillas dipped in broth, next was choped chicken, next was sauteed onion, green pepper and garlic, next was corn, then was a chopped up block of velveta cheese, topped by the soup/tomatoe mixture.  DELISH!!! definatly needed a little more than 30 min... next time will do 40 min at 350*

I used 15 corn tortilla with 1.5 cups of broth.  The flavor is excellent but it's way too wet.  Next time, I definitely will sauteed the vegetables first and cut down the broth.  The spice in Tomato/Chile is too much for my kids to handle, so next time I'll use regular 10 oz tomatoes.

If you haven't made this casserole, make it, it's delicious! If you like the flavor or chicken, green chiles, and tortillas, you'll love it. My husband who doesn't care for casseroles, eat this up; I have to make 2 casseroles. Don't forget to add a couple of cups of sour cream to the soup mixture, makes this dish much creamier and rich. 5 best basic ingredients are chicken, cheese, soup/s.cream mixture, tortillas, and chiles - all the rest of the ingredients like onion, tomato, garlic you don't need. Takes away from the authentic flavor of the dish.

Fantastic!  Heated and used 1 cup chicken broth to dip corn tortillas in before layering.  Used the other cup of broth to mix in with the soups.  Next time I will probably only use half of a cups because it was still a bit runny....but delicious!  Also used more cheese.  This is an absolute keeper!

this recipe was pretty good.  I definitely would have sauted the onion...pretty much like eating raw onion.  My family liked it..it was a good way to use up tortillas and left over chicken.  Very budget friendly too

This is comfort food.  I halved the recipe and used only the cream of chicken since DH does not like mushrooms. It was fantastic and we will make it again.

okay so like everyone else I made changes - I cut chicken broth down to one cup and dipped my tortilla strips in it first - I also made my broth with the chicken bits that were left in the frying pan that I cooked the chicken in just adding some bou. and added my soups to that and simmered for a few minutes. The chicken I used was maritnated in a southwest marinade. I enjoyed the end result but my family didnt care for it. I dont know if I will make it again but only because I was the only one who will eat much of it

Very good.  Husband said to add it to the regular rotation.  I did not add the chicken broth to the soups but soaked the tortillas in it instead.  I also grilled the onion when I grilled the chicken.

This recipe was delicious and perfect for a cold night. I put 2 cloves of garlic on top of the casserole before putting into oven and baked for 35 minutes exactly and I did not use a full can of the broth but close. I also used 3 cloves of chopped garlic and like another reader suggested, added spices to chicken before cooking it in a pan in EVOO. We will totally make this again! Thanks!

I made this recipe as written and did not care for it but boyfriend did like it.  The flavor was good, but it was soupy and next time I will cook the onion and bell pepper so it is not so crunchy (personal taste).

This was good, but it was kind of bland compared to what we usually eat. I guess given the high ratings, I was expecting more. It reminded me of very very mild enchiladas.

I changed the recipe a little, combined this one with Carol's King Ranch Casserole. I boiled the chicken in crushed red pepper and chicken and tomato boullion, and used the broth in the soup mix with green pepper, onions and chili powder and cumin. My husband couldn't stop raving about it--and eating it! Definitely a keeper! Next time, I want to try some enchilada sauce on top after the tortilla gets crisped from baking and add cheese on top of that.

I am not much of a cook, just starting at 42. I loved this!! I shredded the chicken after boiling it, added it to the pan with onion and garlic. Skipped the green pepper, cause the fam is not keen on it. I added a little salsa, chicken broth and the chili powder and cumin. I used flour tortilla's. I don't know if I have ever seen corn tortilla's in the store. My mistake. I did coat the torillas in the chicken broth. I used a cheddar Mjack blend, with a couple chopped jalepeno rings. My daughter loved it also. My hubby loved the flavor of the chicken mix, but didn't like the texture of the tortilla's. Too soft for him. My son wouldn't try it after hearing that. I was thinking of making it into a dip recipe for tortilla chip. The husband who is a cook and restaurant manager was excited about that. He was impressed with my effort which says a lot!

Very good!  I cut the tortillas in strips and dipped them in the chicken broth as others suggested.  I sauted the onion with some garlic and left out the bell peppers.  I also tossed the cheese with the chili powder and thought the 2 cups of broth was a good amount.  Next time, I think I'll try flour tortillas or crushed tortilla chips as others have done.  But, it was still very good!

Well... It was just okay.  The flavor was okay, the texture was okay... I was expecting "more" I guess. I did follow many of the other suggestions and cut back on the broth - I'm very grateful.  I'm also very grateful for the tip to let it sit. Follow both of those tips - dinner will turn out... well, okay.

This is an absolute favorite in my house! My husband scarfs it and brings it to lunch over the next few days afterwards. Rotel tomatoes are the only way to go with this recipe, and a few dashes of hot sauce adds a nice kick.

This wasn't as good as I expected from all the great reviews... was alittle soupy, even after sitting out a 1/2 hour. If I ever try this again, I'll probably switch up the kinds of soup, and use less broth, more totillas to soak up the extra liquids. It was just "ok".

I just moved to the South and this recipe is very popular here but it is called by the brand name of the tomato and chile mix.  I grilled the chicken breasts to add an extra layer of flavor.  I didn't shred them or chop them up but I left them in large chunks.  I also left some of the chips whole and used them to line the sides of the pan to make it prettier!

This was the first time I made this and we really liked it. I was able to freeze it - which I was a little reluctant to do because I was afraid the tortillas would get soggy but they didn't. The only change I will make for the next time is to saute the onion and bell pepper, they were a little too crunchy for me.

This is one of the better King Ranch Chicken recipes out there. It cracks me up that the bio on this recipe says that this is a food fit for kings! There actually is a King Ranch in Texas that this dish is named after, as well as a truck! Thanks for the yummy recipe.

So good! A nice change of pace. I would also use 1/2 cup less broth and cut the tortillas into strip. I would, also, love to add more veggies. Maybe not? Husband absolutely loved this! Kind of like a Mexican Chicken Pot Pie. Perfect doubled for Pot Lucks.

This dish was great.  Even my picky kids ate it.  I used fresh jalapenos instead of bell pepper.  Next time I will decress the amount of broth as it was a little runny.

This was a great recipe.  My family loved it.  I recommend using less chicken broth.  1 cup should do just fine.  It was a bit runny.

I changed the recipe a bit.  I sauteed onion and garlic and just added that and the chicken all to the soup/tomato/broth mixture instead of layering them all separate.  There was not NEARLY enough cheese and it was quite soupy.  My husband didn't like the softened chips in it, though that was my favorite part.  He suggested it would be good for a dip for tortilla chips or as the insides of a burrito, sans the chips.  Probably won't make this again, though.

This recipe is fantastic!  I made it for a potluck gathering and it was very easy to put together and everyone loved it!  My family has asked me to keep it in our "cook again collection".
