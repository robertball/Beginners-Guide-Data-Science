The flavor of this is very good. I doubled the green curry paste and added shredded carrots and red bell peppers for color. Also, I soaked my rice noodles in COLD water for 15 minutes, then cooked in hot curry sauce for approx 5 minutes - I think the hot water method would overcook them. Overall, a great recipe. Thanks!

This was pretty good but I had to add a bit of "flavor" to it.   It MIGHT be because I accidentally messed up and bought a green curry sauce that already had coconut milk & fish sauce so I used 6 oz of that instead.  The mixture tasted fine, but when I tasted it with the rice noodles it was bland.  So I added salt/pepper and some chili garlic sauce for flavor & heat.  After that it was great.  I also included a diced red bell pepper.  Next time I think I'll add ginger & garlic to the veggies while they cook.

We tried this with beef, and it turned out great!  We added snow peas, shredded carrot, and bok choy to stretch it.  I think next time i will try to cook it down or thicken it, though, as the sauce was a little too thin for our tastes.  I was surprised how much flavor it had with the few ingredients called for.  It didn't need any extra seasoning.  We will definitely be back for another try, thanks for posting it!

I doubled the recipe and found it to be rather bland, even though I had added in much more curry paste (I used red as I couldn't find green ones) and fish sauce... the chicken especially is rather tasteless. Don't think will be making this again.

I made few changes. I only had carrots and used egg noodles.I sauted chopped garlic and Ginger followed by adding only 1 tbsp fish sauce ,sugar ,and some soy sauce ( to kill the fishy smell).I added chicken into this mixture. Instead of adding coconut milk into chicken and noodles mixture, I added it to chicken mixture and let it simmer for few seconds for the flavours to blend in. I then added the noodles. Not a bad recipe. I will make it again.

This was very tasty. I didnt have green curry paste, but I had red. I minced 1 tsp. fresh ginger, 1 tsp. of minced garlic into it too. And I seasoned the chicken with adobo. I didnt have rice noodles so I used ramen noodles. Thank you!

This is my first review...and I had to tell you... this was amazing!  We just finished eating it and leftover for my 10yrs old lunch.  I love Thai food and the flavors were wonderful, so very easy make, and very easy to adapt for heat/spice. It's a great base to start with if you're new to Thai flavors.  And for the more experienced, you'll know how to kick it up if you want.

I love the flavors of Indian food with the various curry pastes and coconut milk. I used red curry paste and added some red cabbage and zucchini.

Added carrots, red bell pepper for color and texture.   Used only a pinch of sugar, and based on other reviews added red chili flakes.   The curry paste I used is bland...will look for a different brand in the future.    I added the noodles at the end as stated in the recipe...next time I will keep separate.   This is a good basic recipe that can be used as a jumping off place.   I will try other options in the future.

Yum! I added tons of veggies - carrots, red bell pepper, bok choy,  pea pods, garlic, green onions (instead of regular onions) in addition to the zucchini and mushrooms. I doubled the curry paste, added an extra T fish sauce and reduced the sugar due to personal taste. I diced the chicken as per the recipe, but next time will just cut into strips. This would be a great week night meal because it cooks up so quickly (especially if the veggies are sliced and diced ahead of time).

I will cut back on the fish sauce! The first time I made this it came out better. The second time I used the full amount of fish sauce- yuck!

Loved it with minor changes. I added garlic and a couple of Thai peppers for a little heat.  Thanks for a great recipe!
