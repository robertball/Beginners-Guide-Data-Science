I made this for a party for Memorial day. It went over well, but goes so far I had leftovers. Took more to family gathering and everyone loved it... even super picky niece who doesn't like anything. Made exactly as written except cooked in a round casserole dish instead of pie plate. Cooking time was off, finally turned oven up to 350 after about 35 minutes at 325 and that took care of it. I served it with the little triscuit crackers.

This was overly sweet for an onion dip. Next time I will totally eliminate the sugar.

Great dip but I agree don't add the sugar. I also added fresh ground pepper. The dip is good hot or cold.
