I made this into a 10 star dinner!  Never had rabbit before, but it was just so delicious. It was mostly the sauce that did it. I first fried up 1/4 lb. of bacon and used the drippings to brown the floured rabbit in, then put the bacon crumbled up into the sauce.  I added 1 c dry white wine instead of water.  I added 1 tsp. of dried thyme and 1 tsp. dried rosemary.  Also cut up 1 med onion and added to the carrots and potatoes.  I used all the called for ingredients and just made these extra additions. So I did alter the recipe a bit, but it really was a dish to remember.  Next time, I'll try it with chicken parts so my husband will eat it!

Have made this twice and it's wonderful. I raise California rabbit's and had to double the recipe for the bigger rabbit. My whole family rated this 5 stars.

My family loved this recipe. I did add a can of golden mushroom soup and extra broth. I came out like a rabbit stew. Thanks to the person that submitted the recipe because I love rabbit and never sure how to fix it. We served it over rice and mash potatoes. Both were great.

Absolutely phenomenal! The only thing I did differently was to brown the rabbit pieces in bacon fat, and I used half water/ half milk in the sauce. Will definitely make this again, although next time I will probably serve it with mashed potates. Thanks, Bluemonday!

I've never had rabbit before so I had no idea how to cook it. I didn't have access to cream of mushroom soup so I used a mushroom gravy instead and a cup of vegetable broth. The rest of the recipe remained pretty much the same and I served it with rice. Delicious, thank you!

Great recipe! Will be doing again but probably wont be using rabbit. (nothing wrong with the rabbit, just not enough meat) will probably use chicken. Only changes i made was using red potatoes.

Really let down.  Very watery, don't expect a gravy. Not much flavor. All the crust from frying the rabbit falls off and when you bake it.

I had never tried rabbit before. Me and my boyfriend were pleasantly surprised that it wasn't gamey & taste pretty much like chicken. This recipe was a good choice for a first time rabbit dish. It took me quite a long time to prepare though between cutting up the rabbit (wish I had a sharper knife), boiling, using the skillet & setting up the oven pan.  Luckily, my boyfriend was helping because I probably would have burned something in the process.

Great recipe! I  would highly recomend this one! I followed this recipe pretty close. I added a little bit of cayenne to my flour for a little kick.  I accidenly got roasted garlic mushroom soup but  didnt put any fresh garlic in the dish. I didnt have any carrots so I added an onion. Next time i will use all three root vegatables. The rabbit turned out tender and full of flavor!  I served it with mashed potatoes even though I used them in the dish. I will try it with rice next time like others suggested.

One of the best rabbit recipes I have ever made, we had no leftovers.
For sure we will make it again and if we have no rabbit we will make it with chicken.

My husband loves game meat. He brought home some rabbit, and I had no idea what to do with it. I found this recipe, tried it out, and he LOVED it!

A new favorite!  I used safflower oil instead of vegetable oil, red potatoes (left the skin on), and a pound of fresh mushrooms instead of the canned, but it came out perfect!  I was skeptical of the Italian seasoning, but it added just the right amount of flavor.  I might add a little salt to the sauce next time (probably because of the fresh mushrooms vs canned).  I think I'm going to try this with guinea hen or even pheasant.  Absolutely delicious.  Thank you for the new recipe!

This was amazing!  I just made it for Father's Day.  Only changes I made were to lightly brown the rabbit pieces in bacon grease after they were dredged.  I also had to make double the flour mixture and I used ground garlic instead of garlic salt in the flour mixture.  I added the bacon to the pan.  I cut my carrots and potatoes a little bigger - that was wise - and I made my own cream of mushroom soup - it would taste just fine with canned.  I cooked it in our Kamada (like a Green Egg) for about 2 hours.  This was so amazing that it seemed like my eyes would roll back in my head.  None of my changes would be necessary (except maybe the bacon).  Thank you!!!!!

I added a pound of fresh mushrooms, a shallot, and a habanero pepper, which I first sautéed in oil and butter - and then I threw those back in the pan after cooking the chicken with the liquid from the canned mushrooms to deglaze, and put that in the sauce.  Also added some celery, just because I had it around - I think an onion might have been nice.

Really great!  I wound up with way too many potatoes/carrots, mostly because my rabbit was 1.5lb instead of 3lb.  I did cut back on those things, but there's a lot extra.  Which is fine, the veggies and sauce alone will make a nice side dish with something else.

Love this - reminds me of growing up in Ontario, CA when a simple, rustic meal can be so lovely.  Only 4 stars because I feel like it was lacking spices (once I added my own spice preferences it was definitely a five - so a pretty easy fix).  Rabbit is a difficult protein to get right - this recipe makes it nearly foolproof.
ETA:  The second time I made this I replaced the cream of mushroom soup and mushrooms with frozen Wild Mushroom mix from Trader Joes and it was phenomenal!!!

Excellent recipe to refine to your own tastes!  We started raising New Zealands about a year ago and were trying to decide if we wanted to keep it up.  This recipe helped to decide a hands down YES!  Took light of some other's suggestions, and started the pot with bacon then adding a bit of lard we had rendered. 
 Fried them up nice and brown (had to double the flour mix), removed the meat, then de-glazed the pot in some homemade carrot wine.  Added the mushroom soup and other broth ingredients directly into that pan, then dumped the potatoes, carrots, and some onions into the soup mix.  Then laid the browned rabbit on top of it all, sprinkled the bacon pieces on top of the rabbit and put it in the oven.  I did add a bit of rosemary also.  Delicious.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

This is very easy and tasty.  The rabbit was so tender.  I cooked it in an electric skillet which was very easy and followed the directions except I used fresh mushrooms.  I shared left overs with my neighbors who aren't up to Cooking much these days and they loved it too, the next evening.

My husband brought home a rabbit from his last deer-hunting trip, because I like the taste but I've never made it. I made this recipe for him and the family for Valentine's Day and we loved it! Aside from cutting up my first rabbit, which was a bit of an adventure, this recipe was super easy and soo delicious. I also substituted a cup of white wine for the water as another reviewer said, used dried porcini mushrooms, and a lot of garlic, because that's how we roll, and WOWZA!! The sauce was superb. I nixed the potatoes and put onions, carrots, and celery with the rabbit, then served it over some good noodles with a salad. A big hit!

Delicious!  Added an onion and used white wine instead of water.  Will definitely be making this again.
