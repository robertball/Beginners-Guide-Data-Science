Used this as a dipping sauce for chicken and pork potstickers.  Didn't have any mirin, so I substituted dry sherry which worked out great.  I will be trying this with chicken tenders soon, but we actually enjoyed this sauce with the potstickers better than our typical peanut or sweet & sour dipping sauces.  It has just the right balance of sweetness and tang, and mixes up in minutes with ingredients I always have on hand.  I can see this being used on many, many things, just flat out tasty!

This recipe is my favorite sauce of all time! I use it for Chicken Tonkatsu and as a replacement for BBQ sauce because it just tastes better. I do not use alcohol in cooking so I sub the Japanese sweet wine with prune juice and it does great.

Had my doubts going in and they proved correct. I had all the ingredients at home and used precise measures. Ended up tweaking it with alot more soy sauce and powdered mustard and simmered in a pan until nice and dark, then put it through a sieve and cooled. For my own taste I added sriracha as well.

I tried this out when I couldn't find any tonkatsu sauce in my local grocery stores. It was okay if used sparingly, but had a weird aftertaste that we really weren't feeling. I eventually found my way to an H-Mart and bought some Bulldog brand tonkatsu sauce and use that liberally on all my breaded and fried meats instead.

It's not bad as a dipping sauce in and of itself, but has a huge catsup flavor and doesn't really taste like katsudon sauce. Maybe I'm just spoiled from going to Chinatown frequently. If you want a tangy -sweet sauce, this is fine, but not if you're looking for katsudon. My dinner was delicious with this, just doesn't taste right.

I make Asian food all the time, so I was excited to try this new sauce recipe. I was very disappointed! I will not make it again. I thought everything about this recipe was overpowering and that the flavors did not blend well together. I love bold flavors but both my hubby and I didn't like it all.

I couldn’t find my soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce. Used sugar free maple syrup instead of brown sugar. Used HP sauce instead of Worcestershire. It’s great and my husband loved it.

My family loved this! I feed six people, so I doubled the recipe, told everyone a little goes a long way: and they DEVOURED this. I served it with the  fried chicken breasts over rice, and will definitely use this as a go-to sauce.

Made as written. Very good flavor; the Chicken Katsu dish (also found on this site) is nothing without this sauce. Will make again, thank you!

I made this as per the recipe and it doesn't taste like katsu sauce that I've ever had. This definitely tastes like ketchup. I ended up adding more soy sauce & about 1 teaspoon of BBQ sauce that I had on hand that I thought would blend well with the flavors and it finally tasted more like the katsu I've had at Japanese restaurants. This tastes too tomato-y. I do like the color, thickness, and appearance of this sauce though compared to other recipes. This feels like it was missing something and I'm unsure what exactly that taste is and how to make it taste less like tomatoes.

Great starter recipe on its own, if not maybe a twinge heavy on ketchup.
After making it the first time, I adjusted the listed ingredients until I found a balance I liked, then stirred in just a bit of sriracha for a bit of a kick.

I love this! Instead of brown sugar I used 1 1/2 tbsp of raw, unfiltered honey. It was a hit with family. Thank you so much for recipe.

Not terrible in its own right but doesn't taste at all like real tonkatsu sauce. Consistency is off as well - the sauce should be smooth, this comes out almost lumpy.

This is a delightfully flavorful sauce, and with a few tweaks like salt free ketchup and coconut Aminos for the soy, very low sodium as well! I served it with the Tonkatsu pork loin recipe on this site and it was the perfect compliment.

This was a great sauce!  I served it with chicken cutlets, pounded very thin then coated with panko crumbs.  Fried of course.  The hit was the sauce!  It was used by our guests on tempura, shrimp and the chicken.  Will definitely make it again!

I had no idea how easy Tonkatsu sauce was to make. This is a delicious recipe. We always bought the Bulldog brand sauce, while good, but prefer homemade sauces. I used it to compliment the homemade Japanese potato croquettes. New favorite!

Good recipe, fiance loved it.  I swapped out the soy sauce for my soy sauce replacement (beef bone broth, red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar,  molasses, garlic powder, onion powder,  salt, pepper, fish sauce ), and the ginger for cinnamon for allergy reasons.  Worked fine.
