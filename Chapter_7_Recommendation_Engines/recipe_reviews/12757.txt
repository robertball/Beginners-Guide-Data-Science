This was really yummy! As shark isn't too available here, I used salmon instead and added in chopped green onions before cooking. As I don't have a deep fryer (and prefer not to fry), I skipped that step and just baked them for about 15 minutes(until edges were brown and crispy) - worked perfectly and was still absolutely delicious. Thanks Diana!

Okay, these were very tasty, when all is said and done.
However, they were a pain to prepare.  If you have the time and patience, go for it.

Very good!  I did kind of run with it, though.  I substituted tofu for fish and tried to "mexi-up" the seasonings, using lime juice instead of lemon, olive oil instead of canola, and cumin and chili powder instead of cajun seasonings.

I marinated the fish in different salsas, Mango,cranberry and limes for summertime and in the winter added peppers and squashes. It's a good way to get the kids to eat them without them knowing! 2 year old approved!

What a fun recipe! Very tasty with guacamole and sour cream. The taste of shark is very mellow and refreshing.

Really awesome!  I used the fish we caught recently at a local lake & some ocean perch instead of shark.  Great recipe.  Be sure to heat the corn tortillas well or they fall apart when trying to wrap them.

this recipe was very good.  the marinade was perfect.  i used rockfish instead of shark, but i'm guessing any firm whitefish would work.  i paired this recipe with a ten minute enchilada sauce.  i skipped the frying and went straight to a baking dish, smothered with the enchilada sauce, and topped it with cheese at the very end.  very good flavors

YUMMY! This is the 2nd time I used shark, and these were much better than the first time I tried. I will be making these again.
