This was interesting. I liked it okay as written.  I think I'll try it again but only use almonds. Also, I'll use more coffee ice cubes--it was too liquidy. It seemed to need more substance to offset the nuts and seeds. Some people may want to add sweetner, but I thought it was fine without. I used unsweetened almond milk.
