These were absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I used a slice of provolone and cheddar for each sandwich and grilled these on my George Foreman.  I made some garlic butter using 1/4 cup of butter, 1 tsp granulated garlic, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tbls parmesan cheese, dash of salt and pepper and 1 tsp oregano.  I mixed this together and spread it over the sandwiches before I grilled them.  They came out perfect!  I will definitley be making these again.  Thanks NYCDAVE for a very simple but tasty recipe.

I've made these several times and the sandwiches are always a big hit with my brood!  Just add soup or a salad and dinner is done!  I take the easy way out and make on stovetop.  I melt butter in a large skillet, and spinkle in garlic powder, onion powder and oregano.  I then add 3 slices of bread, sprinkle cheese on each slice and add top slices of bread.  After the bottom seared, I flip.  Also, I use a mixture of whatever shredded cheeses I have on hand: Italian, swiss, mozzarella and/or parmesan. If you need more sandwiches than your skillet will hold, wipe out skillet and add another round of butter and seasonings; otherwise, second round will taste burnt.  I omit the marinara as my boys said 'doesn't need it'.  Next time I will try with olive oil instead of butter to reduce the 'bad' fat content.  Thanks for a new twist on an old favorite!

Really great QUICK QUICK recipe.  I made the mistake of thinking that the stove would be faster for this, wish I had tried the broiler.  Definitely doing that next time, or using the sandwich maker, which this is also good with....I'm beginning to think that these are the only grilled cheeses my boyfriend wants now.  Be sure to use whole milk mozzarella for the best taste!!!

My 8 year old loved these! Thanks for the new twist on grilled cheese! PS Make mine on the griddle instead of in the oven. I even added a little Parmesan cheese to mine and it was delish (:

These were a nice change from ordinary grilled cheese and were almost as easy. I used softened margarine and mixed the garlic (I used 1/2 t) and oregano into it before spreading it onto the bread. I also just cooked them on my griddle. I thought this made them much easier than using a broiler as I tend to burn rather than broil.

This is the greatest grilled cheese ever!  I made these with "Italian Wedding Soup I" (from this site) for dinner one night and my whole family asked for them the next day for lunch.  They are amazing.

Great twist on grilled cheese, just like garlic bread with cheese in a sandwich form.  I dipped em' in "pizza soup II" (from this site) and that worked great for me.  Thanks NYC Dave!

These are good. Used regular, salted butter, Texas Toast, Italian seasonings + the garlic powder, mozzarella cheese slices and whatever spaghetti or marinara sauce I happen to have on hand. Have also pan fried these, the kids like them better that way.

5-star cheese sandwich.  I made it in the frying pan as I didn't want to turn the oven on.  Second time I made it I took another reviewer's suggestion to put a little thick homemade marinara sauce inside the sandwich; made it with cheddar cheese bread, used cheddar cheese, with a little sprinkle of Parmesan (had no mozzarella). Grrrreat! Will make it this way in future.  Won't ever be able to go back to an ordinary grilled cheese.

Here’s what I had on hand. Spelt bread, fresh slicing mozzarella and Trader Joe’s Vodka Sauce. I melted unsalted butter and added oregano, garlic powder & a little garlic salt, all to taste (pretend you’re making garlic bread). I brushed the butter mix on one side of the bread and tossed it, butter side down in a heated skillet drizzled with EVOO (for a nice brown crust). Then I placed a layer of thick sliced mozzarella on and topped with another slice of bread. I brushed the tops with the butter mixture and waited for the magic. Flip and brown the other side and done. Cut in quarters for easy dipping and serve with sauce. Here’s the reason for the long review: These tasted like THE BEST MOZZARELLA STICKS WE’VE EVER HAD. The grains in the bread crisped up and mixed with the seasoned butter just like Italian bread crumbs but better (this alone would keep me from using plain white bread). The fact that I sliced the cheese so thick gave a nice ratio of cheese to bread. They where so good, we picked up more cheese and regular marinara sauce (we liked it better with this) and made them the next night, served with Italian Wedding Soup (great idea from another reviewer!). As I write this I am starting to crave another one but I must control myself because these are not exactly diet food. I don’t think they would come out like this broiled, so I probably won’t try them that way. I definitely will, however, be making these again and again. Thank you NYCDAVE, what a treat!

Yummy. I was looking for some different sandwiches other than plain old grilled cheese. I used italian bread instead of white bread. I also just used I Can't Beleive It's Not Butter spray, and then sprinkled the garlic powder and italian seasoning on top. I don't have a broiler drawer, so I just put it on a cookie sheet on the bottom rack, and set the broiler to 'low' and it only took 2-3 minutes on each side.

Yum!  I used fresh mozzarella and added parmesan and a little cheddar.  Next time I'll use italian seasoning instead of just oregano.  So good though!  Paired it with Garden Fresh Tomato Soup from this site.  Mmmm!

Very yummy. Next time I will opt out on the vodka sauce, it is rich enough without it.  I also will just grill it open faced next time with a lid so the cheese melts as broiling it didn't quite get the crunch in the middle because I didn't want to burn the edges.  A couple changes, the butter spread I used fresh garlic, a little italian dressing mixed in with the butter, then sprinkled basil, oregano and parsley on top. I used sourdough (not recommended) next time I will use french or italian bread. I also added a couple pieces of bacon which went great with it.  All in all a good sandwich that can easily be a great sandwich.

I wouldn't want to give up the regular kind of grilled cheese but this was very good and a nice change. I used a slice of provolone and shredded mozz. and regular marinara sauce. The dipping sauce really makes it.

Didn't use the marinara sauce suggested, but the grilled cheese itself was made per-recipe. Delicious! So simple that I was a little ashamed I hadn't thought of it myself--but so good! Definitely a keeper for grilled cheese and tomato soup dinner nights. Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  Great recipe as is but can also be altered for your taste - I like to saute some garlic in olive oil until cooked, add the oregano and some fresh parmesan cheese to the mixture, and then coat the bread slices with it (in place of the butter - I think it's a bit healthier and very tasty) and then grill or broil them.  I also like italian blended cheese and thinly sliced tomato in the middle.  The dip is an added bonus!

This is our new favorite grilled cheese!  I also found grilling in a pan to be easier (less burning).  I mix everything in the butter (Italian seasoning and basil is a great combo!) and spread on the bread then brown like  a regular grilled cheese.  I also add a touch of shredded romano or parmesan cheese to the butter mix to give a crispier texture.  LOVE IT!!!

This is a great sandwich!  I used mozzarella SLICES and after I took it out of the broiler cut it into eight pieces (cut in half, then each half cut into four pieces) and served them with pizza slices... honestly it was almost just like restaurant mozzarella sticks.  The bread was very similar to the breading that coats the restaurant sticks.  Had these with a big green salad for lunch.  If you have a customizable broiler you might want to set it for about 350 or lower.  I left mine on the default setting of 500 (yikes!) and burnt the first two to a crisp in about 45 seconds.  The next ones turned out perfect :)

GREAT twist to grilled cheese! I mixed the oregano in w/ the butter instead of sprinkling it on top. Be sure to watch them under the broiler!! Mine were done in less than a min on each side. Dipped into pizza sauce and these made for a great treat! Would make these again when we're in need for a change!

I make my own version at least once a week. Instead of the garlic and oregano, I use Italian seasonings, and instead of white bread I use whole-wheat artismal bread.  It is comfort food.

I made it with garlic powder with parsley, whole grain bread and grated parmesan cheese instead, and it was a very good variation!

I used sour dough bread, garlic butter, and mozzarella cheese. Cooked it just like a grilled cheese sandwich. Yummy!

The first time I made these I made them exactly according to the recipe, but I felt it could use some improvements.  The second time I used sliced cheese, buttered the bread then just sprinkled it with the garlic powder and oregano, and then grilled it on a griddle like a regular grilled cheese.  They came out much better this way.  Grilling them cooks them more evenly than broiling and they are cheesier with sliced cheese rather than shredded.

I'm a college kid, and this recipe is fantastic when I want something quick and delicious! I make them in the oven as the recipe suggests, but I broil them down near the bottom of the oven, instead of the top, because I find they toast quicker than the cheese melts if I don't. Also, I use regular thin spaghetti sauce and add in my own spices instead of marinara. My friends ADORE this recipe and beg me to make it all the time. Also, I've tried it several times, and it's much harder to make if you cut a loaf of italian bread on your own, I suggest buying pre-cut bread, much easier.

Easy to make, and so much better than your every day grilled cheese!  I put minced garlic in the middle with the cheese, too, which added a nice twist.

Loved this! Never would have thought to dip a grilled cheese sandwich with sauce but it was good. Just used regular spaghetti sauce instead of the vodka sauce.

My whole family just loved this.  I did what others suggested, and mixed the oregano in with the garlic powder and butter.  I also served it with marinara instead of vodka sauce, and had a Caesar Salad on the side.  For the cheese I used an Italian blend of mozz, prov, and parm.

This is SO good! What a yummy twist to dip the sandwich in marinara...dippers are always a fun thing to do. I'm going to try it next time with already prepared garlic bread. Thanks!

This was pretty good.  The garlic and Oregano added just enough umph to make it special.  The broiler in my oven didn't cook it very evenly but I am sure that just doing it the old fashion way in a pan would have worked nicely.  I also used Texas Toast for the bread.

This was very good, it is a nice alternative to regular grilled cheese.  I added mushrooms in mine.  Also, instead of using the broiler, I preheated the oven to 400 degrees and baked five minutes on each side.  It was perfectly brown.

This recipe was easy and tasty.  I did spread pesto on the inside of my sandwich because we love pesto, and it tasted great.  I made two sandwiches quickly in my toaster oven for a simple, speedy dinner.

These are even better using freshly minced garlic. I like the stove-top method of cooking best for more even browning.

What a simple way to "upgrade" the traditional grilled cheese.  Did not use the vodka sauce, but just a traditional marinara for my kids, who absolutely loved it.  I made 2 for them to share and ended up making 2 more because they liked them so much.

I liked the cooking technique of broiling instead of pan cooking.  The bread was nice and crispy instead of soggy.  I used all mozzarella and think a cheddar would be much better.

How funny to come across this recipe - I have made something similar for years (w/out writing it down as a recipe) - it's a big hit here.  I will cut it into sections and the kids love it plain, with sauce, different cheeses (whatever we have), slipping in some bits of salami or pepperoni that need using up - yum.  Good stuff!  Love it because so much is ready all at once.  I also bake them instead of broiling sometimes at 400-425 about 5 minutes per side or until they are no longer soggy.

I was so impressed by this recipe!  I followed the instructions exactly except that I added some monterey jack cheese along with the mozzarella.  This makes the cheese creamier, not as rubbery as mozzarella tends to get. That was just personal preference, but you may want to try it. The vodka sauce with it was stellar!! Along with some soup, this makes a great lazy night dinner.

This recipe was great.  I added large slices of pepperoni and made it with cheese bread on the stovetop. The flavors went great together.  I served them with Italian Wedding soup.  My family liked them so much, I had to make a second batch of sandwiches. I definately will be keeping this recipe.

I've made these a few times now and they're great.  I do make a few changes, though.  I use wheat bread, and I layer the sandwiches like this: Garlic butter (on this site) on the outside of the bread, bread, vodka sauce on the inside of the bread, shredded mozzarella cheese, vodka sauce on the inside of the other piece of bread, bread, garlic butter on the outside of the bread.  I also cook them in a skillet like a regular grilled cheese.  Try them this way and I guarantee you'll love it.  Will make these again and again.  Thanks!

Paired with the vodka marinara sauce, this version of grilled cheese is wonderful. Sadly, I was out of white bread, so I had to use rye. It was still tasty, but next time I'll remember the white bread! Thanks.

The flavor in this sandwich reminded me of the Four Cheese and Tomato Panini served at a local food chain restuarant.  I prefer to use a crispy bun. I don't need to use the butter.  If the bun isn't crispy enough I crisp it under the broiler first.  The best bun I used was a tomato basil bun.  It added flavor. I spread mayo on first and sprinkled garlic, oregano and basil.  Italian seasoning would also work.  On top of that I put roasted red peppers.  I would have put a thin slice of tomato on next except I kept forgetting to buy one at the store.  On the other half of the bun I use a mixture of white cheese such as provalone, mozzarella, and swiss, depending what I have on hand.  I broil this and it turns out very tasty.  Sometime I'm going to try sauteing mushrooms, onions, green peppers or  red peppers with seasoned salt and adding that to the sandwich.  Sounds good to me.  Thanks for the recipe.

Nice change from regular grilled cheese. I used italian seasoning  in place of the oregano. I also added tomatoes just because I like them on my grilled cheese. Will definitely make this again.

This is by far the best grilled cheese sandwich ever. My kids beg and plead for me to make their everday after school snack. I can't resist myself either, it's definately a keeper. THANKS!

I'm a teenager and I decided to look for something that I could make my mom for dinner. Between this recipe and a ceasar salad, it was a great (and easy and inexpensive) meal to surprise her with after a busy day at work :)

I made this for lunch today and had it with tomato soup. I loved the Italian twist this recipe puts on the grilled cheese sandwich. The combination of the melted cheese with the marinara sauce and the crispy fried bread were finger lickin' good! The weather here has been awful for many days in a row (lots and lots of snow and cold temperatures) and it was nice to sit down and have some comfort food. Everyone loves a good grilled cheese and it was nice to have it done a little differently for a change. This was a great idea to makeover a classic!

Really good. I baked at 450, since I generally burn bread when broiling.  Just bake for 5 mine, flip, then bake for 3-4 more. Really good served with a tomato basil bisque instead of the sauce.

This was ok.  Maybe it just needed more garlic or some italian seasoning.  I'll stick to my cheddar grilled cheese.  It was worth a shot though.

Delicious sandwich! This is one of those that you wonder why didn't I think of this? It didnt' get as crispy in the oven as grilled, but it did turn out nicely and you can make so many more sandwiches this way. Thanks, I'll fix these again.

This is an excellent sandwich.  I don't care for the typical grilled cheese sandwich but this really hit the spot.  I could have eaten a half of loaf of bread using this recipe.  lol  I enjoyed this with a bowl of chili and look forward to many more.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I loved these! They're our new favorite sandwich. Instead of using the broiler we just put them on the skillet on the stove. They're easy to make and taste so yummy! I wouldn't say that the vodka marinara is necessary (it's so expensive) and that any marinara sauce will do. Plus, putting on  a little ham gives it a great taste too.

Great grilled cheese sandwiches!!  6 was too many for us, so we halved the recipe.  We like a lot of garlic so I doubled that and added a bit of parmesan cheese to the butter for some extra flavor.  Super easy to make and a nice twist on grilled cheese, will definitely make again.

This was amazing & good.  We had our neighbors over b/c it served more than our family could eat.  We had Bear Creek Chicken Noodle Soup with it on a cold evening.  The sandwiches were sooo good & soo easy.  It took me about 10 mintues to make dinner & my 7 year old son asked for another sandwich.  He usually east 1/2 & he ate a whole & wanted more.  Easy & YummY!  The Vodka sauce was amazing too, definately makes it even better dipping it in this amazing sauce.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

This is so easy and good! Pretty much the same as making a normal grilled cheese (I was too afraid to try the broiler) on the stove. I added a bit more seasonings and just served them as normal grilled cheese, no need for dipping sauce tho I bet its good. Even the kids loved it!

Love these!  I make them a little different.  I place a slice of provolone between 2 slices of sliced italian bread.  Mix garlic powder and shredded parmesan into butter and spread each side of sandwich.  Then grill on griddle.  Great for dipping in marinara as an appetizer or as garlic bread with spaghetti or lasagne!  Thanks for sharing!

This was the best!  I did have to put the rack in my oven to the lowest one to avoid burning from the broiler, but if you like cheesy garlic bread, you will LOVE this recipe!  I also tried two or even three cheeses and ALL were YUMMY!  Even my picky eaters ate it!!!

This was a nice change from the regular grilled cheese sandwich. My family loved them I did as others had done and put pepporni on mine and dipped them in Maranara sauce. Thank you for the recipe.

Wonderful, easy, quick recipe!  I made as recipe states, it was great.  I am very excited to try the variances that other reviewers have suggested (stove top, provolone, olive oil, etc.).  Thanks for a fantastic keeper!

I have made these grill cheeses several times and they are great.  I like to use fresh parmesan and mozzerella mixed, topped with pepperoni slices.  They are great served with a bowl of creamy tomato soup to dip them in.

Used fresh mozzarella and oregano - and instead of buttering bread, I used frozen garlic Texas Toast.  Baked per directions at 425 for about 3 minutes - flipped and cooked another 3 minutes.  Terrific!

I very much enjoyed this twist on an old favorite. I cooked them on the stove top. I mixed up some garlic butter adding oregano, basil and thyme. I also served it with cream of tomato soup (adding italian seasonings to it as well). It was a huge hit.

Delicious! I turned the broiler on too high, so my crusts were a bit burnt, so keep an close eye on the heat of the broiler! Other than that, it was delicious. I had it with tomato soup, and it was a nice way of jazzing up an old classic. I would defnitely try adding in a mix of Italian cheeses in it, and perhaps a bit more seasoning in it to jazz it up a bit more.

I was surprised that these were bland.  I added fresh basil and some fresh-grated Parmesan inside, I used roasted garlic bread, and I put sliced tomato in half of the sandwiches, but still they needed something to give them more flavor.  I thought they would be great, but they were disappointing.

What a great change to regular grilled cheese! Instead of doing the garlic/butter mixture, I used thinly sliced texas toast (lite) and sprinkled italian seasoning over the cheese. I baked them, and then to finish it off i sprinkled parmesan on top just as they came out of the oven. Wonderful!

Nice twist on a grilled cheese sandwich.  The only change I made was to add a two slices of Canadian bacon and a slice of provolone cheese.  Was a huge hit.

Delicous...and simple!  I won't bother with American cheese grilled cheese sandwiches again!  I softened the butter in the microwave but didn't let it melt completely because then it's not really spreadable.  I mixed the garlic salt and some Italian seasonings with the softened butter before putting it on the bread.  Used some sliced multigrain bread and grated mozarella cheese and "cooked" them up in a nonstick skillet instead of the broiler...easier to control burning that way.  I used the suggested marinara for dipping but probably won't bother with it again.

I couldn't wait to use this recipe. However, I altered it. I used Texas Garlic Bread, and used american cheese (all I had on hand) it turned out good. Next time I will do it like the recipe. Thanks for adding a new twist to grill cheese sandwiches.

I found these to be very bland.  Maybe if you used Texas Toast instead?  And definitely don't use the broiler; it's much easier to heat the oven to 400 or so and brown them.  Much less watching involved that way.

Very tasty twist on traditional grilled cheese.  I used the Easy Pizza Sauce I from this site for dipping, but sandwich was great by itself also.  Hubby and toddler wanted seconds.  Will add to quick lunch rotation.  Thanks!

This was really good.  My entire family loved it.  It was a nice change from the traditional grilled cheese.  I also served it with tomato soup.  I did add a little cheddar to it and baked it some and then broiled it.  I think there was too much cheese...we love cheese.  thanks, it was great!!!  Brenda

These went great with tomato soup instead of marinara!!  I didn't have unsalted butter, so melted margarine with 3 cloves of garlic, and mixed in the oregano with the butter instead of sprinkling on the sandwiches.  So easy and tasty!  This will be tomato soup's sidekick from now on!

Marinara dipping sauce! What a great idea. Betcha can't eat just one. Just for fun,second time around,I tucked in thinly sliced onion rings and tomatoes between slices of bread(in addition to the cheese, of course). Everyone loved it.

I only like tomato-based sauces in specific recipes, so I did not use the vodka sauce for dipping.  The recipe for the actual sandwiches was quite good.  I really liked the oregano, and I decided to add some parmesan cheese, both to the mozzarella and sprinkled on top for a parmesan crust.  Excellent!  I also liked how very simple this recipe was:  very easy and quick!

I've been making this for almost a year now! It's the ONLY way I make my grilled cheese sandwiches now! I don't measure the ingredients, just butter the bread and then sprinkle with the garlic, oregano and cheese! YUM! I usually dip in pizza sauce because I always have it on hand. Since finding this recipe I make regular grilled cheese's (with american) using the broiler method as well! Thanks!!!

MMMM! Such a simple recipe - such a yummy sandwich. Made me wonder why I hadn't thought of this myself. What a good idea!

I added sliced pepperoni's to mine and cooked in skillet (only cooked 1 sandwich).  Dipped in warmed left over pizza sauce.  Very quick, easy and YUMMY!

I did these in the pan as another viewer suggested (melted butter in my pan, sprinkled herbs, assembled sandwiches in the pan, cooked til done) and it cut the butter by a LOT. I would say maybe 1 tbsp per 4 sandwiches. We liked these a lot (I mean, what's not to like? It's a garlicky grilled cheese!) I served mine with Cream of Tomato Soup (from this site) instead of the vodka sauce (though I'm sure that's delicious too if you like vodka sauce!) Thanks for the recipe, you wouldn't even believe how many years it's taken me to get around to trying it out!

These were yummy!  When I sprinkled the oregano, I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese. Using the marinara sauce for dipping reminded me of mozzarella sticks…mmm!  These would be really good cut into strips for appetizers!

This recipe is good, but a little bland.  I even used fresh basil as others suggested.  I will try this recipe again using fresh garlic in the butter and a different marinara sauce.

This is a brilliant idea.  Make sure to do it in the oven though because I made it on the stove like a regular grilled cheese and think it would have been way better in the oven. I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because I was crazy about dipping it into marinara sauce but to each his own.

There are great sandwiches, I'm not a big fan of grilled cheese sanwiches so I was looking for something different and let me tell you this was it.  My whole family loved them, they don't taste like ordinary sandwiches the flavor is just awsome.  I will be making this on a regular basis.

Garlic bread meets grilled cheese = simply delightful.  Awesome buttery garlic kick to my tried-and-true grilled cheese.  I used 2 slices of monterey jack along with the mozzarella.  Yuummy!  Will definitely make these and other varieties again and again!

My husband and I just finished my first attempt at this recipe. It was very good and has the potential to be excellent. I used whole wheat bread because it was what we had on hand, but next time I will use a firm white bread. Also, it was my first time using the broiler in my new apt and it cooked way too fast. Luckily I was keeping an eye on it and pulled it out in time. I just lowered the rack for the 2nd side, but next time I might try this in a stove-top skillet. Even after all that my husband, who is an extremely picky eater, said it was awesome!

Great way to mix up the traditional grilled cheese. Careful with the broiler. Our two settings seem to be "warm" and "blacken".

Great recipe for adding a little kick to boring 'ol Grilled Cheese. It still seemed to lack something to me though. Next time I will try adding some sundried tomatoes or Capicolla Ham or even some spinach to give it more of a Panani flavor burst. That way, it feels a little more substantial.

These were very good...a different twist on the typical grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup.  We had to double the amount of butter in order to cover both sides of the sandwiches (we melted the butter).

I would have given these a four because it didn't have enough directions from keeping me from setting them on fire 30 seconds after putting them in the oven, but once I realized that I needed to put them on the middle rack everything was fine. My husband says they were a 5 and it was probably my stupidity that almost set the house aflame. I'll make these again, but put a note to put on middle rack.

These are fantastic! They were a huge hit with my 16yr old son and his friends after school. I had to keep making more. I did butter and season the bottom bread add cheese the the top piece of bread buttered and seasoned. Baked 6&1/2 min first, flipped and baked till golden(use convection if you have it).

This was really good!  I did not broil it but just grilled it in a pan.  I did add a little basil as well.  In lieu of garlic powder I used 'garlic bread sprinkle' for McCormik.  It's a blend of garlic, romano, salt and a few other things.  It worked well with this recipe.

Will definitely be making this often!  Thanks for the twist on a old classic!

Stellar cure for the blues!  I admit I had only block mozz and was feeling lazy, so I instead smeared ricotta, sliced off just a few chunks of mozz, followed the rest of the recipe and - WOW!!!  YUMMM!!!  Thank you!

it wasn't BAD...  but I am use to a lot of flavor on my grilled cheese. I know odd.  but I am sure if you added a little all season salt to each side it would be a lot better.

I don't even like grilled cheese sandwiches and these were awesome! I took the advice of others and made a butter garlic sauce to spread on them prior to cooking. I used a griddle and they came out great. Paired with some tomato soup these are a winner!

Our version of this recipe uses sliced Pane.  We brush the inside of each slice of bread with jarred Italian tomato sauce before putting the cheese between the slices of bread.  We serve it with Italian-esque soup made from condensed canned tomato soup made with milk, low or non-fat cream,  and Italian herbs.

I love this recipe! My husband always ask for seconds!

I make it at least once a week now, it also makes a great pairing with tomato soup.

One suggestion: for more flavor, add fresh italian salamis.

My girls and I really enjoyed this.  I put Basil and the garlic salt in olive oil and brushed it on the bread.  I also added thinly sliced roma tomatoes.  I bet it would be excellent with marinara, but we just dipped it in tomato soup.  We will definitely be keeping this recipe!

Traditional grilled cheese on the stove is much better. The crust on these were way too crunchy and dry.

I eat these at least 2 times a week and love them!  I came up with this recipe a few years ago but never thought to add oregano which gives it a little extra!  I've always used a basic marinara sauce or ketchup on the side but the vodka sauce sounds good too!

This was a great twist on the normal Grilled Cheese. Depending on your oven you may only need the sandwiches in for less than 2 minutes- mine burned but still tasted great!
Thanks for the recipe- will make again!

I needed to use up some leftover pepperoni, so I threw them in these sandwiches and they were delicious. My stepson ate 4 of them and gave them the two thumbs up! Thanks for the recipe.

These were yummy, I used my own marinara sauce.  Next time I would add more garlic and a bit of salt to the outside of the bread, and also some parm. cheese to the inside.  It worked well to make them on the griddle.

MMMMMM!
i want this all of the time!
so does everyone else.
i used provolone, asiago, and mozzarella cheeses.
texas toast garlic style worked well.
i cut the sandwiches to eat in a dip-style.
only used a bit of marinara per serving.
tomato soup on the side was also good for dipping.

I was looking for something a little different to dip in our soup and this little  number fit the ticket.  I will likely use more garlic and oregano next time, but still a delicious way to spice up your grilled cheese.

Very yummy. I changed things up a bit based upon what was in the fridge. I used sprouted wheat/barley bread, shredded soy cheese that was a mix of mozarella, cheddar and some other kind, and I used pizza sauce and minced garlic because my garlic powder was hiding. I brushed the outside of the bread with light smart balance margarine and gave it a spray of canola oil and then put the pizza sauce on the inside on the sandwich. Just delicious. Perfect dinner with a cup of creamy tomato soup.

This is absolutely fabulous & SO easy. I used whole wheat bread, my own garlic butter, low fat mozzarella cheese. I diced up 2 slices of turkey pepperoni to include in the filling with sprinkles of pizza seasoning & parmesan cheese. I loved the sprinkling of garlic powder & oregano on the hot bread; it added a great flavor. This is probably going to be the only way I make grilled cheese now! Thanks so much for sharing.

Oh wow, what an ordeal I had cooking this.  I followed everything except using frozen texas garlic toast.  I got everything ready (preheated my broiler) and put them in the oven.

I have a new oven and never broiled anything before, so after 3 minutes I smelt burning (thankfully I was standing at the oven) when I opened the door I saw flames a top my toast!  I yelled for my hubby and he pulled them from the oven.

I threw out the top pieces that were burned to a crisp, replaced with new bread, placed them lower in the oven and adjusted the temp (lower).

They did good but I had a problem getting the cheese in the middle to melt so I took the top piece of bread off and put them to the side, stood at the oven and watched the cheese melt, pulled them from the oven, put the top pieces back on and served them.

Very good and different - kids liked it.

I tried this recipe a couple of weeks ago - trying to find something different for the kids.  They absolutely loved it.  These are the only grilled cheese sandwiches they want from now on!
Thanks!

These sandwiches taste like fried mozzarella sticks, only way more healthy! Delightful and satisfying.

My fiance and I found this recipe last winter. It's great because so many servings are ready and hot at the same time. The recipe didn't mention what temperature to set the broiler to, and so had to experiment (nearly burning an entire pan). The second time we made this, we forgot that it's best with a firm bread. So, the sandwiches weren't as crisp with regular sandwich bread, but they still tasted good.

These were pretty good. Even with the spices and sauce they did seem to lack something. I added good ole Salame and Proscuitto. We'll be making them again.

This grilled cheese variation was a huge hit at our house. My family isn't always thrilled about changing an "old-time favorite." But really loved this one. Served with soup is our favorite so far.

My husband and I thought these were great.  I made them along with a tomato basil soup that I found the recipe for here on allrecipes.com.  The sandwich dipped in the soup was so good.

Excellent quick meal.  To make this even faster I used store bought garlic butter and shredded Italian blend cheese.  I put a bit extra garlic butter inside the sandwich.  My husband LOVED it.  I served with a chunky tomato soup and it was awesome.  Definitely a keeper!

This was a great lunch!  Just what I was looking for.  Instead of putting it in the oven though, I used a sandwich maker.  I put the butter on all the bread and just put it in the sandwich maker, instead of cooking one side, turning over and cooking the other.  Came out great!

So simple yet so delicious!  I keep ingredients on hand for this and make it whenever we are short on time or energy. I use a small jar of bruschetta sauce for dipping instead of pasta sauce.

This is actually pretty good.  Grilled cheese isn't something we eat a lot, but I definitely prefer this  recipes over traditional grilled cheese!  I've also used bread from the bakery & made my own garlic butter to spread on the slices instead of using texas toast.

Awesome! Great change from the regular old grilled cheese sandwich. I used a small amount of garlic salt & added a small amount of Italian cheese blend along with the mozzarella cheese.

After reviewing other grilled cheese sandwiches, I used this as a base & added to some dried basil along w/the oregano; I bumped up the cheese filling by mixing the mozzarella cheese w/cream cheese & mayo.  I blended into the mix 2 serrano peppers, seeded & chopped.  I had on hand some premade frozen garlic Texas toast, which turned out easy!  Served with a variety of olives as garnish on a salad-size plate, which I sprinkled w/chopped flat leaf parsley & cracked peppercorns.

These were awesome!  Much better than regular grilled cheese, or regular garlic bread.  I served it as a side with spaghetti, and the marinara sauce complimented it perfectly!  These will be a favorite in my house.

These were great dipped in some pizza sauce. To make it a little easier, I mixed the margarine, garlic powder and oregano and spread the top and bottom and just threw them in the oven.  I didn't use near the 8 oz of cheese called for. My daughter loved them!

This is an excellent and easy standby.  I too melt the butter for ease.  I prefer to use fresh mozzerella and it really does make a difference.  My boyfriend added sun dried tomatoes to his and loved it!

Three stars because of the amount of changes made to the original recipe.  I used the suggestions of many other people. I mixed the oregano into the garlic butter; added 1 sliced tomato, 1/2  red onion, thinly sliced, and 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil.  I served it with Classico tomato basil marinara sauce for consistent flavors.  This made it a 4-1/2 star recipe for my family.  Yum!

This recipe is going to be a keeper for our family!  I actually made it for the children in my child care.  I have to follow state regulations and include a protein in each lunch.  I decided to cook some ground turkey with onion and added that to the sandwiches.  I sprinkled on the turkey meat and used just a spoonful of sauce in each sandwich to hold it together better.  The kids loved the sandwiches and the dipping sauce.
I saved the leftovers for my husband.  He loved it too.

I loved this recipe. It was fast and easy and tasted great. The only think I changed was to bake them in the oven instead of the broiler. The broiler seemed to burn them too much.

Wow! Great idea! I used what I had so changed it a little but it is such a flexible, no-fail method. I mixed a little seasoning (bread dipping spice mix) with soft butter, spread that on the outside of the bread and used whatever cheese was preferred and grilled it on the stove. Served it with homemade tomato basil soup. Will definitely do again

This is AMAZING!  I made this when I wanted grilled cheese but had run out of cheddar cheese and really wanted something garlic-y.  I melted butter in a pan and used fresh chopped garlic, then put the bread down in the butter. I put mozzarella, feta, and asiago cheese on the face, let it melt, then added the top piece, flipped it, and tada!  Topped it with oregano and I'm craving a second and third sandwich.

We used sourdough white bread, colby jack cheese and also mixed minced garlic with the butter/powered garlic mixture. Let's just say, it came out AMAZING! Both me and my honey wished I made more!! Definitely making these again. They came out perfect. 100% better then the cheesy garlic bread you get in stores. Paired it with soup, tasted amazing. Thank you so much for the recipe!!

I made this sandwich a few times, and using the following ingredients per each serving... 10 thinly slices of pepperoni on one slice of bread, followed by a nice helping of shredded mozzarella on top the pepperoni, and a light sprinkle of garlic powder and dried oregano leaves over the cheese. I buttered the outside of bread slices with Shedd's Spread Country Crock (Churn Style), and browned them in a skillet on top the stove (rather than under the broiler). I also heated the pasta sauce before making the sandwiches, then set the pasta sauce (covered) aside while making the sandwiches. After the sandwiches were done browning, I let them sit for 3 minutes before cutting them in half, and dipping them in the pasta sauce. This was a nice alternative to the grilled cheese sandwiches which are usually made with slices of processed cheese.

These were a nice change from traditional grilled cheese.  I made 2 and did them on the stove in my fry pan.  Worked well.  I didn't even bother mixing the margarine with the garlic in a dish, I just sprinkled the garlic over top of the margarine on the bread and used my knife to mix it slightly.  Don't do this unless you really like garlic.  Sprinkled Oregano over that and fried them up.  Really good.

I only had a bite of a sandwich but my kidlets really liked them. I did make as is with the jar of vodka sauce, which I don't advise to do so. Next time, I would make these after making homemade vodka sauce.

Thanks for the great recipe. I did not have mozzarella. I used swiss because that's what I had, I also added tomatoe. I put garlic powder on the tomatoe, then oregano on the bread. It was tasty and still had the Italian flair.

These were a nice change of pace from our regular grilled cheese. However, be sure to either cook each side for only 1 minute or put your pan on the bottom rack instead of right next to the broiler element. Next time, I'll put a basil leaf on top of the cheese. I served it with the gorgonzola tomato soup from this site, and they were great together.

Better than GE average grill cheese. The recipe calls for more sauce than needed, so you can cut down.

We made this last night for dinner with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder. We also used a little paprika on it, but other than that, it was the same as the recipe. This is now a staple of our snack and light dinner diet.

My wife and daughter love the cheese-garlic bread at our local pizza shop; when I made these they stopped ordering from the pizza shop and now insist I make these instead. The taste is great and the prep is easy.

I really liked these.  We didn't use the marinera sauce, but I'm sure they would be even better.  My kids love grilled cheese, so it was nice to do something different with it.  Will make agin.

These were pretty good. Not a lot of nutrition. It was like making a meal out of mozzarella sticks. We liked them though. They were very easy. I just grilled mine on our griddle instead of broiling them.

Yum, these are wonderful!  I made them using a little George Foreman grill, and they turned out perfectly.  They were supposed to be served as a side with a soup dish that I made, but my family kept requesting more and more of these throughout the meal!

Made these last night and hubby went back for another. He loved them. I lightley buttered the bread and did sprinkle a little garlic powder on the buttered side. I used provolone and mozzarella cheeses, thin sliced tomatoes and sprinkled that with a little salt,pepper, and oregano. I cooked in a non-stick pan on the stove instead of baking. Great twist on a classic sandwich!

This was a good spin on traditional grilled cheese. I thought it needed more garlic, but that's just me. Also,I added Italian Seasoning instead of just Oregano. It was easier and I thought it added a nice touch. Quick, cheap, and easy. Could you ask for anything more?

Yum! I made these using whole grain flax bread. I spread them with margarine, and filled them with slices of cheddar & mozzarella, and sprinkled each one with a teaspoon of parmesan. I made my own tomato sauce from tomato paste, basil, thyme, garlic and oregano, and added a couple tbsp to each sandwich. While they were grilling I sprinkled the top piece of bread with some garlic powder. They were wonderful! My Dad said they were the best grilled cheese sandwiches he's ever had, and he even saved the leftover 1/2 sandwich. My brother said they were like "cheese pizza with a crust on top". I served these with the Roasted Red Pepper & Tomato soup from this site, and the meal was wonderful!

I give it a five but I made a couple simple modifications - I used presliced sourdough bread.  For the garlic butter, I used fresh minced garlic, a bit of salt and Italian seasoning.  I also used sliced mozza, and a meaty sauce for dipping.  We all loved it, and my son wants it all the time now.  Great recipe!

I think everyone will always change the fillings, so the best tip from this recipe was the garlic powder/butter spread. I put slices of fresh mozzarella and slices of muenster on each sandwich, with a bit of oregano. Didn't care for the oregano and will probably stay with cheddar or Velveeta...

I made this for my daughter, who loves grilled cheese sandwiches, 4 days ago.  She has asked for it 3 times since then.  I am going to the store today for more cheese, and she wants to try pepperoni on it.  Like other reviewers, I make this on the stovetop, because that's how I'm used to making grilled cheese.  I will mix up some garlic butter to keep in the refrigerator.  She also loves having the marinara sauce for dipping.  Thanks for the wonderful idea!

Great recipe!  I put some parmesan cheese, thin slices of tomato, and fresh basil with the mozzarella, and that made an awesome sandwich.  Thanks!

My husband and I thought this recipe was quite good. We made it on the stovetop instead of the broiler as others have done. We followed some of the suggestions others have made, such as adding a slice of provolone to the mozzarella and grating some parmesan on top. We will definitely try it again.

My family really enjoyed these sandwiches. They were easy to make and I served them with a quick chilled pasta salad. Great summer idea.

Awesome sandwiches! My oven is broken (yes we're in full crisis mode) so I had to make these on the stovetop in the traditional grilled cheese manner. I also used a leftover can of pizza sauce to dip them in as I had no marinara sauce. Thank you so much NYCDave for the new fave.

Made these with Texas Toast so all I needed to add was the cheese. Delicious!
