Just before adding the peaches, I took a tiny taste of the batter and realized, ugh, there's no sugar!  I was a bit surprised by that, because why make a dessert if it isn't sweet?  I added about 1/2 T raw sugar, which helped.  I saw that the other peach cobbler mug recipe on this site was the exact same, except it called for 2 T sugar. With the addition of sugar, I would rate this a 4. Not the best mug dessert out there, but I might make this again... I was thinking for breakfast.
