I followed the recipe and found it to be very bland, so I added garlic and cumin to taste.  So much better.  Just add whatever spices you'd normally use in a salsa.

This is such a light, refreshing salsa.  I didn't have fresh corn, so I took some frozen corn and sauteed it in a pan to get some color on it.  After I let it cool, I added the rest of the ingredients.   Used lemon juice instead of lime.  This is great for tortilla chips and wheat crackers and a perfect side for tacos and burritos.

I had such a taste for corn salsa and I had no recipe, A coworker of mine recommended this website and I made this one, I loved it, the flavors blended so well, everyone that ate it loved it too. The only thing I added was 2 gloves of garlic. It was so good, this one is definetly going in my cookbook!

Use 1 WHOLE jalepeno pepper.  Roasted the corn in the oven (it was raining out).  Nice -n- fresh -n- spicy!

I love this recipe for salsa.  I love eating salsa and being full at the end.  Thsi stuff is the best.  Play around with different spices and really set this off.  Cinnimon is great in it...trust me.

We love this recipe - the light flavor, some may call bland, is exactly what makes it perfect to marry with other ingredients whether it be grilled chicken or garlic black bean chips.  We did add one can drained and rinsed black beans for an additional texture.  Letting this marinate overnight helps all flavors to come together for an enhanced flavor.

Used 1 jalapeno, 4 ears of corn and most of the juice of 1 lime and a little more green and red pepper.  Awesome!

So-so... I started into this before I realized that is basically a no-cook salsa.  The ingreedients taste good, but it is lacking the unification of flavours that a traditional salsa has.  Next time I will probably toss it in a pot and cook until the tomatoes are basically liquid.  Roasting the corn was a nice touch though.

great starting point. I added cumin and dropped the red pepper. I like things spicy so I used two jalapenos and blended them. It was amazing!

Disappointingly bland. The proportion of ingredients seems to be off, as this had absolutely no zing and the corn flavor was too dominant.

I loved it...served on fish tacos. The rest of the family asked to go back to my "regular" tacos, so probably won't be making this one again. Flavors are great, though...be sure to use plenty of lime.

This was pretty tasty. I used 6 smallish  roma tomatos. Unfortunately I didn't have any cilantro but I made up the flavor by adding extra lime juice. Served it with a spice rubbed tilapia.

Very good salsa!  I didn't have any fresh jalapenos so I used 3 whole canned peppers, finely chopped.  I also added a few teaspoons of vinegar and a can of drained/rinsed black beans.  Wonderful flavor!

5 stars. We didn't have bell peppers on hand so just omitted them. The recipe was excellent regardless. Make sure you roast the corn as the recipe calls for. We'll be making this one again and again.

It was just ok. Not sure how to even fix the recipe. I won't make it again.
