I first learned how to make this when I was a little girl and the woman who ran the daycare had the kids work together to make it. Now, I make this with my own kids. I don't use walnuts, I use pecans. Sometimes if I think of it, I'll make a vanilla glaze to drizzle over the top after I've turned it upside down. This doubles well and honestly disappears in 15 minutes. My family loves this. It's a great substitute for people who love cinnamon rolls but don't want to spend the time to make them.

Boy does this bring back memories... This definitely is an irresistable childhood favorite and a great way to use Grands Biscuits. Not only is it fun to make, but fun to eat! I always use a bundt pan sprayed with Pam for baking so everything comes out with ease. I add the optional nuts and raisins along with 1 tsp. of vanilla to the butter and brown sugar mixture. When it's done, just invert the whole thing onto a plate and get out a ton of napkins!

A tip learned the hard way: don't use spray for greasing the cake pan. It's too much. Lightly spread some butter with a paper towel and it cooks better, and isn't as "greasy".

three tips to make it 5 stars...
First I would boil the brown sugar and butter for two minutes in order to get it to "carmalize".  Then pour it over the biscuits.  
Second...I would skip the "Grands" biscuits and instead use regular Pillsburg refridgerator biscuits (the kind that come in a pack of 4).  The "Grands" are too big and still taste too savory.
Last...I would skip the bundt pan and put it in a glass 11 X 17 pan.  I read reviews complaining of uncooked dough, and by switching out pans, I had no trouble with the 28-32 recommended minutes.

We loved this. Made it as directed, minus the raisins and walnuts (no one here will eat them but me.) I had no problem with the brown sugar mixture but as soon as my bread was done, I flipped it on a plate and let it sit there 10 minutes (still in the pan) so that the mixture would 'harden' onto the bread, not in the bundt pan. This one turned out so much better than the last monkey bread recipe I tried. Definitely a keeper!

I make with Pilsbury Grands cinnamon rolls, quartered and tossed with brown sugar, butter and pecans.  Add a little water to the brown sugar butter to get more caramel.  A favorite Saturday morning treat at our house.

What yummy gooey goodness on a cold morning. I did tweak this to my liking. I halved this. Then I melted the butter in the bottom of a large loaf pan and added the brown sugar and a tablespoon of milk to make a caramel sauce. I sprinkled pecans and raisins over the caramel and then layered the sugared pieces as directed. When it came out of the oven, I immediately inverted the pan to create a caramelized sticky loaf. Very nice!

It was an awful lot of sugar and butter and I actually ended up throwing some of the mixture away because after my 10 minute cool time, when I turned it out onto a platter, a lot of brown sugar mixture was still in the pan.  I wouldn't use as much next time - I'd probably use half the sugar and butter.  However, that said, this is a yummy treat to have once and a while.

We enjoyed this but the sauce did not "caramelize" in the bundt pan.  I scooped it out after done and put into the middle of the biscuits.  Next time I'd bake this about 3-5 minutes longer as the inside seemed a bit doughy.  I did add walnuts which made the recipe!

My family loved this! Only issue was I sprayed the pan and it would not come out of the pan. I sprayed it with non stick spray. Next time I will try butter or grease.

The only thing I do even a little different is to combine the butter and brown sugar over medium heat until it comes to a simmer and is fairly well combined. I lay half the biscuits (quartered and tossed in cinnamon sugar) in the greased tube pan, then sprinkle on half the diced walnuts and half the brown sugar / butter syrup. Top with remaining quartered cinnamon-sugared biscuit pieces and remaining nuts and syrup. This makes a special and delicious breakfast that my family inhales.

Simple, quick, and delicious.  I prefer to make in individual servings in a muffin tin, but it's delicious no matter how you serve it.

Pretty yummy stuff!  I could've done with a little bit more of the caramel sauce though.  I had no probs with the dough cooking through; I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9x5 loaf pan for 35 minutes.  I had 2 layers of dough chunks and it baked right to the top of the pan, perfect size!  Used raisins, pecans, and 50% more cinnamon than called for because I love cinnamon.

I've made monkey bread over the years, normally use the smaller refrigerator biscuits, 1st time using the Grands(R). One thing to watch for in the recipe is topping the brown sugar mixture at the end, please take advice, use a spatula to tuck some of the mixture down beause of over spilling in the baking process OR do what another person recommended she did, was put some of the mixture on the bottom of the pan. I wished I had looked at reviews before completing, would have saved me from burning the bottom of my oven. Other then that, good recipe ended up adding more cinnamon, because towards the last 4-6 biscuits I noticed the cinnamon was no longer ahearing to the biscuits and it was just sugar. But recipe is a keeper and it was quite good.

My family really likes this recipe, it's been requested 3 times this month!  I only make a half batch as there are only 3 of us and turns out perfectly. I also use an 8x8 baking dish as I don't have a bunt pan.  I made as is per directions the first time and it came out well enough.  My only suggestion is once you've added your brown sugar to the melted butter, heat it or place in the microwave for 10-20 sec to help the sugar melt.  This really helps the sauce caramelize and not come out still grainy.  I also like to double the cinnamon and/or use pumpkin spice in the mix.

Great recipe! However, next time I will heat the butter and brown sugar to make a syrup before pouring it over biscuit pieces, as it turned out more like a brown sugar crust than a glaze. This, however, did not stop us from devouring it!

I made a half recipe using just one tube of rolls for my little girls and me and we all loved these. I baked them in a large loaf pan and it did take a little longer than the recipe said, even with just half a recipe. They were a big hit and I'm sure I'll get requests for these again and again.

I love this recipe and have made it so many times now.  Rather than make one large bread, I use individual flat wax paper cups from sur La Tablle and bake for around 20 mins.  So much more easier to eat and they always get rave reviews

I made this for morning coffee when friends came over to join us, and it was a hit!  I opted for the raisins and used pecans rather than walnuts.  This is very rich, so a little goes a long way.  It turned out wonderfully sugary and gooey and tasty!  Yum!

Made or tried to make this for Christmas morning brunch. I had to bake it significantly longer (raw dough) and then finally some of the top and outside parts were done enough to eat with the breakafast casserole.  Don't know what I did wrong, (how can you mess this up), but surely something.  Don't know that I will try this again.

Skipped the baggie and mixed the cinnamon-sugar in a large bowl, then tossed the pieces in, half at a time. Used a bundt pan sprayed with Pam. The topping did come out a bit crunchy but the taste was great. My church group went through the whole pan in nothing flat. Will definitely make again.

Made it as directed and it turned out fabulous!  Great warm but still yummy even the next day.  Made a cream cheese icing to drizzle on top.  Best monkey bread ever!  I used a deep dish pie plate instead of a fluted pan.  Worked perfectly.

Wasn't what I expected. it wasn't the ooey gooey deliciousness I expected. I melted the butter and sugar together as suggested.  at that moment I suspected that it was way too much butter.  however I went against my intuition and poured into the bundt pan. 28 minutes later it looked very beautiful but not as tasty as I had hoped.

we love monkey bread, couple of things, you can make your own biscuit mix or use a baking mix recipe for biscuits.. don't have to use pillsbury anything. (I find it expensive - and its just easier to whip up my own) I do add sugar to my biscuit recipe though - couple of tablaspoons so its not so bread like, and then with brown sugar, butter and cinnamon, skies the limit - some apple chopped fine and heated a min or two in microwave before adding.  so Many variations, so useful for what you have on hand - even a few slices of banana or small pieces of peaches... will go wonderfully. this is a great recipe and works perfectly - although use your judgement on how sweet you like it - you might wish to cut back a bit on the brown sugar,,thanks for a great recipe!!

Phenomenal! I didn't really monkey bread it out, I just ate the biscuits with the stuff on top... easier to count the calories that way when you have actual measurements to look at.

pretty good, but the dough did not seem to want to all bake in a bundt pan, so the center came out a little doughy. I would suggest not to put it in a bundt cake pan.

This is absolutely the most delicious (and easiest) dessert recipe ever! I love that it just pulls apart for little hands. The only thing I did different was omit nuts and raisins. We don't eat either anyway. Yum!

This recipe was very easy to put together and the flavor was soooooo good!  I used both the raisins and the nuts and they added a nice texture to the bread.   I didn't get a gooey caramel sauce.  Mine ended up with more of a crunchy carmelized coating.  Also, you still get the texture from the brown sugar since it didn't dissolve.  It didn't bother my family because we liked the crunch. I cooked the bread for 30 minutes until is was a dark golden brown.  The outside was perfect, but, the bread on the inner ring was not fully cooked.  Not sure how to resolve that issue.  If I cooked it any longer the outside pieces would have burned.

All I've got to say is YUM! Actually, I have a little more to say. This is a fun and easy recipe to make with your kids. Little hands will have fun tossing the biscuit pieces in the sugar mixture and they will feel like accomplished bakers when they taste the finished product. You can change it up with different nuts, or other add-ins. It is a winner!

This went over AMAZINGLY well, it was gobbled up quickly.  My stepson says this is the best monkey bread he's ever eaten.  Definitely a keeper!  I didn't have any problems using spray on the pan, nor did I have issues with there being excess sauce.

5 out of 6 family members said this was ok. My son who eats anything ate one bite and hated it which surprised us. The biggest complaint is that my husband and kids could tell by taste that although this was "homemade but it wasn't homemade", meaning it wasn't made from scratch like they are use to. I did use butter instead of margarine and the reduced fat wheat grands. I do not think those minor changes affected the overall recipe. I had no issues with the brown sugar glaze and thought it was just the perfect amount.

Tastes like cinnamon rolls so I changed the second one to pecan instead of walnut. Both are good.

We really like this. We like making it in the Dutch oven when we go camping or at home on a cold winter day. I always need about 1/8 cup more sugar to coat the piece and we like a lot of cinnamon so I use about 50% more than it calls for.

Loved this!!!  As recommended, I caramelized the brown sugar and butter on the stove first.  I added pecans and a handful of raisins.  I baked it in an 8x11 glass baking pan and flipped it over onto a platter when it was done.  Soooo good!

I followed the advice of others here and added 1 tsp vanilla to the brown sugar and butter mixture after bringing it to a boil. I added chopped pecans and baked 28 minutes in a butter-greased bundt pan. The edge pieces are crispy and the insides nice and soft. Delicious and sweet!

I made it exactly as the recipe said but I can assure you for that amount of bread etc the time given was not near long enough especially at that temperature.

Took longer to bake than stated, but was quite delicious.  Needed A LOT less butter than recipe called for, and I think it would be easy to make adjustments to the ingredients to add different flavors.  High on sugar content so not something I will make often, but was a BIG hit with the family.

Halved the recipe , used a deep dish pie plate that I sprayed with Pam, I added the raisins to the melted butter and brown sugar mixture and poured it over the cinnamon/sugar coated  biscuits. I baked it for 28 minutes and immediately inverted them on a plate and then drizzled with powdered sugar glaze. They turned out perfect! I will absolutely be making these again.

This is definitely the tastiest Monkey Bread recipe! Just a tip--I do use a second teaspoon of cinnamon about 1/2 way through to make sure all the pieces get enough cinnamon. 
I made mine in the bundt pan and everything cooked through thoroughly. I pre-grease my pan because I don't like the taste of Pam. Use a sliver of butter on a piece of wax paper and go in and out of every groove in the pan. Works great. Use a rubber spatula to help remove. 
I would highly recommend melting the brown sugar and butter together to keep the syrup from being runny.

You can't go wrong with Monkey Bread!  When I make it for breakfast I can't help but pull gooey pieces off all day long.  I love to add an additional teaspoon of cinnamon and add chopped pecans.

It is just way to much sugar and I think basic biscuits, not the flaky, would have been better. I won't make it again.

I had a few modifications but still came out awesome and I will definitely do this again. I goofed the recipe by only using 1 can of biscuits so they were extra gooey and syrup-ee!  I used a 9" round cake pan instead of a bundt pan. I cut up the biscuits into sixths instead of quarters cause they seemed kind big. I cooked for the recommended time and they still came out perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly and after letting it cool for 10 minutes, I turned the pan upside down and the bread wouldn't come out. I had to pry it out with a butter knife and all the caramelized topping stuck to the inside of the pan.

Baking it now - halved the recipe and did it in a pie plate as someone suggested.  What a disaster.  I made it once before - whole recipe in a bunt pan - and had to put the inside layers on a cookie sheet to finish cooking them.  This time is just no different and it was barely 2 layers.  I have picked the outer layers off, exposing the under layers and I keep checking it and checking it...  It TASTES good but it's a mess.

We make this for breakfast on holidays and long weekends, I use a pie pan rather than a bundt pan. The pie pan helps it cook more evenly. I also add a 1/2 tsp of good vanilla to the carmal sauce after cooking it up on the stove to get a creamy consistancy. No raisins or nuts for us but the beauty of this is you can try different things. I also use the small biscuit dough instead of the grands and prefer it. Family just loves this.

Omg!!! Whaaaat an amazingly easy and tasty treat. I have never liked the pillsbury biscuits. I have tried numerous ways to make them and never was satisfied. But THIS is a winner! The only thing i changed was to boil butter and brown sugar for couple of minutes to have more caramelized color and poured it over. And i just packed them in a dish and heated for 35 minutes. YUUUM! Thank youuuuuu

I used the smaller biscuits, and and made them personal sized instead of one large loaf.  It was very good, I will be bringing it to church tomorrow and tasted a bit of it beforehand. I did end up adding a bit more cinnamon to the baggy towards the end.  It was quick and easy, I will most likely make this again.

This is one of my "vacation go to" recipes because it is easy to prepare and easy to pack.  I bagged the cinnamon sugar then bagged the brown sugar with a stick of butter and placed it all in another bag with the canned biscuits then wrote the directions on the bag. When ready I just pulled the whole thing out and whipped it up. Another great recipe to wake the family up to!

I made this today & I give it a 5 Star!!  My big bro came for a visit & I served this with tea, he couldn't believe I made it & he also asked for seconds.  I used part butter & I can't believe that it's not butter light & it carmelized beautifully.  Will definitely be making it again

This recipe is ok but the dough does not always cook completely in the time of the directiosn.  What I do is take small canning jars for my baking container, take the biscuit from the can and cut them into forths, coat the one forth biscuit in the sugar mixture, place 5 pieces of dow into one canning jar, pour the carmel mixture over the biscuit and bake for about 25 minutes. Turn the canning jar upside down on a piece of wax paper and let sit for a couple minutes.  What you now have are individual servings of monkey bread.  If cooking for 2 like I am, I will purchase one can containing 5 biscuits giving me a 2 day supply of monkey bread.  Just reduce the other ingredients for a one can batch of monkey bread.

This was good tasting but putting all that bread in a tube pan, for me, made me have to cook it longer to get the middle done, therefor causing the sugar to crystallize. Next time, I think I will put it in a shallow pan & bake it.

this was such a great treat! I need to use up some of the grands i had on hand and came accross this recipe. I used a mixture of the flaky layers and buttermilk homestyle. I did use a good amount of cooking spray in the bundt pan. I did bake for quite a bite longer then the recipe called for i baked mine for almost 40 minutes and it came out perfect. My advise is to keep checking it after 25 minutes to see if the inner layer in done then go from there. Next time i do not think i will pour all of the brown sugar/butter mixture into the pan. the top of the bread came out a little soggy. but all in all a great recipe
