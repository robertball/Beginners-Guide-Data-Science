This was wonderful! And easy! I added a little olive oil with my butter. I fried some fresh, minced garlic first for about a minute- just til it started to brown, then added the zoodles. I took the advice I read to only fry them for about 2 minutes, then I sprinkled some parmesan and fresh, diced basil- heavenly! Didn't have any pine nuts so left them out, and I skipped the red pepper.

Tasty and very easy. I had to sub walnuts for pine nuts because  that's all I had. The crunch of the nuts is essential to the success of this dish. I will definitely make this again.

Some times, less is more and this is one of those recipes.   Easy and fast to prepare, and the butter brings out the fresh flavors.  I love the zucchini just barely cooked.  Adjust the pepper flakes to your tastes.   A delicious way to change up the bounty of summertime zucchini.

Super easy and quick. My family loves things hot and a 1/4tsp of pepper flakes was MORE then enough. I added cherry tomatoes to skillet just before zucchini zoodles. Very delicious!

Yumm-eee! I didn't have pine nuts available or the cheese specified (used some grated parmesan). I added a little crushed garlic (everything is better with that as far as I'm concerned), salt and pepper. Mine was ready in 2-3 min; more than that would have been too mushy for me. Love this! Note to self: Easy with red pepper flakes. Second time making this was a little hot (and I like spicy, too). UPDATE 2/2/17: Had with the parmagiano-regiano cheese suggested, and it put this over the top!

no pine nuts in the pantry, minus the cheese, so I fried some spiral onions (crispy) which I had long enough in the refrigerator. Still delicious.

I liked this recipe.  I am not a fan of spicy so left out the red pepper this time.  Next time I will use a pinch of cayenne.  I did use salt, black pepper and garlic.  Although I had no pine nuts and forgot the cheese it still tasted great.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this per the directions, but added chopped red bell pepper and garlic. Everything's better with garlic!  There was a bit too much red pepper flakes IMO, so next time I'd cut that in half.  I'll make it again.

Quick and easy,  Used a lot less red pepper as most of the reviewers did.  Salt and black pepper,  crushed garlic .  Anything can be added.

It's easy to adjust the seasoning to your personal tastes.  I used a lot less pepper and omitted the pine nuts.  I had grated parmesan on hand so that is what I had used.  It was a healthy and delicious side dish.

I made this just as presented, I always have pine nuts so that was a no brainer, I did go easy on the crushed red peppers.  I don't know about anyone else but I found that one large zucchini was just enough for the two of us.  With a broiled chicken breast this took the place of a salad too.  I barely cooked mine so it was slightly on the crisp side.

This was delicious! I added a little sprinkle of cayenne pepper and used Romano since that’s what I had in the fridge.  I will definitely be making this again!

Cayenne or pepper flakes both is mentioned in description and the other in directions I was wondering if this recipe was not thought out properly (however I used pepper flakes) sorry but I was not impressed I think a start of a great recipe but there are other basic zoodle starters I would use first I would definitely use garlic if you decide you want to try this recipe :) my star shows my opinion

It was good! I made using ingredients on hand - no pine nuts, so I subbed walnuts, and used olive oil vs butter. I would make it again.

I also did not have pine nuts, and I didn't have pepper flakes. I made it anyway, and it is very good! It will be better with those ingredients, but enjoyable for now.

I didn't have pine nuts, but I made without and with a tiny bit of fresh basil. Delicious! Only needs about 2 to 3 minutes cooking.

I made the recipe exactly how it was written. Since I didn't have a spiralizer, I peeled the zucchini. I am not a huge zucchini fan but I mixed this with spaghetti and the combination was delicious and not too spicy.

I loved it made a few changes. Sauté shrimp and added a small amount of Chardonnay and reduced it down added shrimp and pine nuts. I also put the zucchini in a towel and squeezed as much liquid out as possible.

Delicious! The only substitution was sunflower seeds for pine nuts. Even my picky kids liked it. A great dish for zucchini that is low carb and high flavor.

we really enjoyed this dish with some minor modifications. like others i subbed walnuts for pine nuts bc that's what i had on hand and  i used a combo of butter and olive oil. i also added some chopped garlic and sea salt. bf thought this could have been cooked longer but i enjoyed the texture of the zoodles. looking forward to making this again. ty for the recipe.

My family enjoyed this - made with parmesan and w/o pine nuts.  Doubled the sauce, which was just a guess since the recipe called for "1 zucchini"..  "1 zucchini" is not helpful, since a zucchine can be anywhere from the size of a smaill pickle to the size of a cucumber.

I made this recipe exactly as written. My first bite seemed a little bland, but then that nice warm and the crunch of the pinenuts in my second bite changed my attitude entirely. Very quick, very easy to make, and is a nice refreshing use of zucchinis and the spiralizer.

Was more of a side dish than a main dish, but my family loved it. The recipe also has an error: it DOES NOT feed 12! The recipe, as written, only will feed maybe 2. Maybe. 

But, very very yummy.
