Altered a bit by peeling 4 large apples, adding 1 cup (approx.) chopped dried fruit and 1/4 cup raisins.  Split sugar (1/2 Splenda and 1/2 Dark Brown Sugar.  Baked in deep baking pan at 350 for 1/2 hour, covered lightly with foil for remaining time.  Lots of yummy syrup to serve with apples, cream, Cool Whip or Vanilla Ice Cream.

The next time I try to make this, I will definitely add a lot more cinnamon.  It shook more on at the end to make it taste better.  What's a baked apple w/out lots of cinnamon?
