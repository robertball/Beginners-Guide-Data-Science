Loved this and my kids really thought it was rice!  I was concerned, originally, that the rice would not "steam" just by putting it in a skillet, after shredding.  But, much to my amazement, it did!  I processed to rice size pieces and then added to skillet with a tablespoon + of sesame seed oil.  Didn't have red peppers on hand, so chopped a few carrots and added that instead. Then, after the recommended 8-10 minutes or so, I added in half of a standard tomato that I chopped.  Finally, I had roasted a chicken and had leftover lemon, olive oil, salt and pepper flavored juices and added that instead of recommend juices.  Tasted amazing and can see this being amazing with ANY juices/spices/combos!  I also added in a bit of fresh chopped cilantro, just prior to serving, for an herb and and b/c it was in my roasted chicken recipe as well.  Overall, was VERY pleased with taste, texture and feel of this recipe!

Half way through, I thought this would be a disaster, but the flavors melded beautifully! My only advice would be to have all vegetables prepped and liquids measured before you start the cauliflower. The cooking process goes quickly, and I would have overcooked had I not been prepared. Serve with something that just needs to be popped in and out of the oven or pan. This dish will take your full attention the first time around but well worth the effort!

Delicious and filling! I felt super energized by all the veggies, not stuffed like you feel from a whole lot of carby rice. The cauliflower base could work for all types of flavors: Asian, Mexican, anything depending on whatever spices you choose. It could definitely replace a potato side dish as well. For a less tart flavor and even more green, try using less lemon juice and adding some parsley.

This was delicious. I made this a main dish by adding ground chicken, topping with a little feta cheese, and served with zucchini on the side. Will make this again. Wonderful!!!!!!

Yum! Used all the ingredients (except for mint, as it didn't look good at the store this week). Also changed the method a bit (taste preference) I used a cheese greater to grate the cauliflower(works like a charm) only used a few drizzles of olive oil total and cooked the cauliflower rice first till it developed into a nice toasty brown colour. Removed from heat and saut√©ed the vegetables with the addition of garlic for a few minutes. Then returned cauliflower back to pan. When done I squeezed lemon juice over top and garnished with some black Olives and feta. I cannot wait to try this again with the addition of mint!

I felt this was a lot of work for a decent dish. It is a good Paleo side dish. Next time I will buy pre cut cauliflower florets to cut the prep time and the mess.

This was surprisingly DELICIOUS! I made it just to be healthy but this is something I well definitely crave. I added oregano, parsley, banana peppers and feta.  outside of that I stuck to the recipe and it was quick and downright tasty!

Just finished eating this. It was great. I already had some carmelized Vidalia, so used that instead of yellow. Per another reviewer's tip, used less lemon (about 1.5T) and threw in some parsley.  I left out the mint this time, but will add next time. Served with yogurt-marinated chicken breast. Light, but filling. Texture wise, it is half way between rice & couscous, although it may have been the blade I used. Oh, and I topped with a dollop of sour cream. What I'm thinking now is to use my leftovers in a wrap - cheese, hummus, spinach...it's on tonight! 

Thank you so much for the recipe :)

Other than using chopped regular tomato instead of cherry, followed recipe exactly. It is delicious! My new "go to" when we get cauliflower in the CSA box.

Husband, who is just below the line for being diabetic, has been trying to lose weight so I have been trying to cook low-carb items.  I served this under Greek chicken shish-ka-bobs and husband said it was good enough to repeat.  We both thought, however, that there was WAY too much lemon juice in the dish, making it a predominant flavor.  This is personal preference, of course.   Next time I will try lemon pepper seasoning or just a couple of Tablespoons of juice instead of 1/4 cup juice.  This will also reduce the amount of liquid going into it.  This dish runs the risk of becoming "mushy" as another reviewer commented, especially if too much liquids are added.  Texture counts!  We don't like mint as an herb so I put in oregano instead, which is also used heavily in Greek cooking.  Could add feta cheese, baby spinach, and Kalamata olives as well if desired.

As written this recipe is soggy. It also, has limited flavor  I will try it one more time using the recommendation that one reviewer gave - to prepare everything first BEFORE putting on the cauliflower. I believe the onions and peppers and tomatoes should be done in a different pan so you can get the cauliflower the right consistency.

I recently completed a 21 day fast and basically followed a vegetables and fruit diet and came across this recipe. This rice turned out great!  I also made chicken wraps and cut up an avocado to go along with the rice.  The meal was fantastic!!!  Thank you for sharing.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much my husband liked this.  I enjoyed it as well. I used riced broccoli as that was what I had in the house.  easy recipe with ingredients that I almost always have on hand.  I'll make it again.

This was okay. Didn't have the mint so maybe that would have changed the flavor? After eating most of it I added some Greek seasoning (recipe from here) and it was wayyyy better.

This was excellent and very fairly easy to make.  I agree with other comments that you should pre-prepare mixtures/veggies before starting to avoid over-cooking.  I also added minced garlic and mushrooms.   I only had dried mint on hand and added too much.  I will half the mixture next time.  However, I will definitely be making this a stable to my weekly routine.
