My family loved it!  However, I think it was supposed to be puffier than it turned out.  My fell flat and was dense.  Don't know what I did wrong....  We loved it nonetheless!  Would appreciate any tips on how to keep dish from collapsing.  Thanks.

Poured this into mini muffin tin instead for appetizer tray along with fruit and cheese.  Very good, very easy and pretty presentation.  One particular person ate the majority of them so I didn't get varying reviews but I enjoyed them and will make again.

I made this recipe for a group of friends and everyone loved it.  The "puff" look didn't last once the dish cooled, however.

I think this is worth 5 stars. It's easy, quick and really good! The wine gives it a nice, unique flavour. I made three changes -- first, I used a 4 cheese pizza blend of cheese (but I bet the swiss would be better), secondly, I added fresh ground pepper, and thirdly, I baked it in a muffin tin. As "muffins" these were baked for exactly 20 minutes and worked out perfectly. Good recipe, thanks.

This was definitely quick and easy!  Very tasty -- it didn't last more than 5 minutes on Thanksgiving!  I will be making this again and again since it is so easy and the ingredients are staples in my home.

Actually a good idea with the wine and cheese, even though the Puffs, which I made in a muffin pan because I wanted lots of little ones, turned out to be more like mini-quiches. Nevertheless ... tasty ! And I will try the recipe again.

Looks good; I haven't tried it but from reading the ingredients I see there is a lot of bulk for only two eggs. I would use four eggs, cut way dow on the liquid and flour, and get a better puff.

This was not what I was looking for.  It tasted more like a frittata or quiche.  I was wanting a stronger swiss and wine taste.

Great recipe!  Easy to make and very tasty.  Followed another reviewers advice and put in muffin cups for 20 minutes which worked perfectly.  I think this will go into regular rotation at our house.  Next time I will try adding some finely diced sun dried tomatoes.

Wish it would have stayed puffy! If I make this again I would add more spices...

These were fantastic.  We made them three times over the holidays and one of our guests called us for the recipe the next day.

This was good, not spectacular.  We had it for dinner, like a quiche, with a salad.  I would make it again as it was easy and pretty quick.

Yes..took it to a happy hour and it was gobbled up so I assume everyone liked it.  The hostess was very happy with the contribution.
