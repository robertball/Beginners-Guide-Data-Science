These are a bit of work to make but they are always so pretty it's worth the effort. I add 1 tsp or so of vanilla to my whipped cream to make chantilly cream and I would recommend adding a stabilizer as well (for anyone who hasn't used these before you can usually find them in the baking isle of the bigger grocery stores) if your cakes will have to sit for awile, otherwise the cream will begin to soften and fall.

These cupcakes were very good, you have to be careful not to leave your frosting out to long because it starts to lose its firmness. I would make again.

This is almost the same cake I make for my husband! His favorite!  
I use Betty Crocker Devil's food cake and bake in a 9x13 baking dish, cool it, and spoon on a 16 oz. container of Cool Whip, then spoon on 2 cans of Comstock original Cherries. I use Comstock brand because it is not to sweet and not to tart.  So I already love this version now I can make it a new way! I also refrigerate it.  Thanks Kathy
