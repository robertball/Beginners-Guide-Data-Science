I'm the original submitter of this recipe, many years ago. My name and account have changed or I would edit this recipe. Since I can't, I'll post the editing here. I've fine-tuned this recipe over the years, until it matches any I've ever eaten at restaurants in Springfield. Here's the changes:  Take out the baking soda, and just add 1T Corn starch, 1 t. Lawry's seasoned salt, and 1/2 t. pepper to your flour mixture in a ziplock bag.  To the eggs, add 2 Tablespoons of ice water, then beat.  Dip your chicken in the egg, then the put in the ziplock bag to throughly coat the chicken, then lay the chicken on your cutting board for fifteen minutes to rest. After that, fry in the peanut oil as per original recipe and drain.   Changes to sauce:  To the original 2 cups chicken broth, change the Oyster sauce amt to 1 1/2 Tablespoons, 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 Tablespoons corn starch. Heat all but the corn starch to boiling, then mix the corn starch with 1/3 cup of cold water until smooth. Stir slowly into the hot broth, and boil for one more minute. Put lid on and set aside.  Heat cashews only in the oven, for the amt of time on the original recipe, and sprinkle fresh, chopped green onions over the finished dish. Enjoy!  Teresa Merau

This is just like the cashew chicken at a little place in Pensacola florida.....I leave out the oyster and pepper when I make the broth and double the broth that you pour on top! This is really good.

I love going home to Springfield, MO to get this wonderful (and inexpensive) Cashew Chicken.  They just don't make it the same in other Chinese restaurants, but this recipe is the real thing.  If only it was as easy to make as picking it up at the drive thru!

If I could give this a higher rating I would.  I've been looking for this recipe for 20 years since I went to school in Springfield - it is a perfect replica of the local dish. My own personal opinion is that this recipe does need to sit for awhile after adding the sauce to let the flavors meld more, the next day is when I actually thought it tasted exactly like the local version.  My only other suggestion is to add some cashews to the sauce when it is hot, it softens these cashews up and lets the flavor of the nuts out. Then I still added more cashews right before serving to add the crunch.  I've also made it with low sodium chicken cubes since the salt level in this recipe is very high and it still had great flavor.  My son is now addicted to this and keeps telling me he wants to go to college in Springfield so he can have this everyday. Thanks for the recipe and the memories of Springfield.

This recipie is right on the money. This is a family favorite, and is a wonderful dish to enjoy. A suggestion, though: instead of using a teaspoon of white pepper, use only a pinch. The power of the white pepper is almost too much for younger/more sensative tastebuds, or so I'm told. =)

I live in Lake of the Ozarks (which is close to Springfield) and this is absolutely the best cashew chicken EVER!  It even beats out the restaurants!  The only change I made was to cut WAY back on the white pepper...I only used a pinch.  For those of you who are turning out oily chicken, use peanut oil, not vegetable oil.  It makes a difference.  Thanks for posting Teresa!

I lived in Springfield for 5 years and travel there quite a bit.  The sauce turned out with too much pepper flavor.  Overall, pretty good, though.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  My husband and I attended college in Springfield.  We graduated in 2006 and moved to Iowa. We have been looking for good Cashew Chicken ever since.  This recipe is perfect and tastes just like the Cashew Chicken in Springfield that we loved so much.  The only change we made to the recipe was to cut the corn startch down to two tbsp.  Otherwise, Perfect!

I love this recipe.  To lighten it up, I use chicken tenderloins that I lightly season on both sides with salt and pepper, then pan sautee in a non-stick pan coated with Pam.  It tastes just as good as the breaded and fried version and is much, much healthier.  It's even good when you omit the cashews (I never use 2 cups of cashews, just a tablespoon sprinkled on top of each serving to lighten it up even more).  Also, I never have white pepper around so I just use black pepper with good results.  The sauce is excellent!

I grew up near Springfield, so I was excited to find this recipie.  When I made it, I was only partially happy with the sauce and not happy at all with the chicken.  To improve the sauce, I would use half the amount of cornstarch to start, and then add more if neccessary.  The sauce was just way too thick.  My fried chicken nuggets turned out way too greasy and I was sick after eating a few.  I would suggest buying pre-made chicken nuggets and then either bake them or deep fry them.  I will try this recipie again and use baked nuggets.  I'm sure it will be quite good then.

My husband grew up in Springfield and craves Cashew Chicken.  We can't find anything like it where we live so we decided to try this recipe.  It is RIGHT ON!  The only exception is the white pepper.  It's too much and not needed.  Great recipe!

I made this last night for my boyfriend, who is a Springfield native and whose favorite food in the world is Springfield-Style Cashew Chicken.  Apparently there are a million variations on this dish even in Springfield, and luckily this recipe (with a couple of minor changes) turned out to be quite authentic and just the way he prefers it.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I cut the amount of cornstarch and sugar in the sauce in half, and I did not put baking soda in with the flour that I used to bread the chicken.  Frying in very hot PEANUT oil is crucial to the success of this dish - vegetable oil or any oil that is not hot enough will leave the chicken very greasy.  Note: this recipe doesn't make a lot of sauce, so I would double the sauce if you're making enough chicken for 4 people.

Finally i found a recipe that tastes like the real cashew chicken from Springfield, MO. The birthplace of chinese food.....I lived in springfield and this is what I miss the most. This is the closest you will get to the real thing. Florida doesn't serve cashew chicken like this. I have searched!! Alot of springfield mo people on this website, they know what I'm talking about!! Same with Sweet and Sour chicken, General Chicken, so on. If ever in Springfield try Mr. Egg Roll on S. Campbell or Diamond Head, YUM!!! Go Springfield!

I grew up in Missouri and went to college in Springfield, MO.  I have had Springfield Style Cashew Chicken A LOT! However, you can't find it anywhere outside of the region, and I live in Oregon now.  I decided to just make it myself after craving it for many months.  I was sooooo excited to find this recipe! I made it for my boyfriend, and his 5 year old daughter.  It was so spicy that she couldn't eat it.  I've never had spicy cashew chicken before.  The white pepper took away from the flavor of the dish.  So, I made another batch without the pepper, and it was Great!!!  Also, the 4 chicken breasts that I used were big. I would suggest quadrupling the sauce recipe to have enough for all servings.

I thought the sauce was right on, but the chicken wasn't restaurant style (maybe I need a fry daddy).  I was surprised by the flavor.  I will make again, but will add some seasoning to the chicken batter.

I grew up in Pensacola florida and thought this was just typical chinese, but when I traveled, no chinese restaurant had ever heard of it.  Some people named Chong owned it They sold it and the new owners altered it and it is not the same.  I was devastated and when I found the recipe on line I was ecstatic!I make my sauce in the pan where I fried the chicken and make a sort of roux to add extra thickening and flavor.

Stellar recipe!!  I made it with half chicken, half tofu (prepared just like the chicken) and it was great.  I also stir-fried some carrots and celery and added it to the mix.  I substituted a small amount of fish sauce for the oyster sauce, as I had none.  It is a mild sauce, but you could surely kick it up on your own. I must also add that the presentation is BEAUTIFUL--it looked like something you would get at a good Chinese restaurant!!  Def. make again!!

I made this for my husbands birthday as a surprise for him. He grew up in Springfield, MO, and everytime he goes back...this is the first meal he eats. It tasted EXACTLY like it should taste and he will ask for it now about once every week. I did have a little trouble with the cornstarch, but finally figured out the trick to it after calling a woman who lives in Springfield and makes it every week. By far...this is as close as you can get without having to go to Springfield!

Being born and raised in Springfield I was excited to try this recipe. I followed the recipe to a "T" and personally found it to be too sweet and peppery.... I would defineatly cut the white sugar by half and maybe use only 1/4 tsp. white pepper. The chicken itself was FABULOUS. I will merely make some minor modifications to please my family's palette the next time I make this recipe....thank you for the recipe!!

The sauce was right on, but I didn't care for the breading on the chicken.  Next time I will fry the chicken using a typical fried chicken batter.  My family loved it, we have been missing Cashew Chicken since we have moved from the Springfield area.  Now I will make it often.

Being originally from the Springfield, MO. area, I missed this favorite dish of mine since I had moved. I found this recipe very close to what is served back there.
 The chicken came out fantastic. I noticed one reviewer complained that the chicken was too greasy. I'm assuming the reviewer didn't use peanut oil to deep fry the chicken in as the recipe calls for, but instead used vegetable oil which will make the chicken too greasy. 
 The sauce I found to be a little too sweet and had way too much white pepper in it(I even halved the amount the recipe called for). Next time I'll try making it without any sugar and maybe just a small pinch of white pepper. I also used about half the amount of cornstarch as the recipe called for as it would have made the sauce too thick.
  So far this is the closest recipe I have found compared to authentic Springfield style cashew chicken.

I followed the recipe with her second review, minus the oyster sauce. It was my first time making cashew chicken and it was great, tasted just like what we eat here in Springfield :) I had to add just a little more cornstarch mixture to my gravy because I like it thicker, but the overall taste was wonderful. I served it on a bed of white rice with the toasted cashews and fresh chopped green onion.

Cashew chicken is my granddaughters favorite dish so we tried this together.  She did not want to add the oyster sauce so we left that out, otherwise we followed the recipe. She wanted onion, red peppers, celery, and carrots stir fried in this recipe and it was perfect.  It took us 1 1/2 hrs. to make this so the prep time was off but it was fun to make and we will be making this again.

This recipe is very close to the cashew chicken I had when  I lived in Springfield, MO.  It's very good and simple to do.  I did use black pepper instead of white.  Worth the time to make it.

We have tried many different cashew chicken recipies but this one is by far the best the only thing I did differnt was take out the white pepper as it was a little to spicy for my kids with it. My fiance' liked it with the pepper. But all in all this was VERY GOOD!

Absolutely fabulous!  The flavor takes me back to my years in Missouri!  The time and effort it takes to double bread the chicken is well worth it.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe so we can all enjoy cashew chicken, even OUT of Missouri!!!

Actually fairly bland, with not enough sauce to coat the chicken. The cashews were the only saving grace for this dish in my opinion. It involved several steps and really wasn't worth the effort.

I just realized (when suggesting it to someone on the Exchange) that I've never rated this.  I've made it many times and the only thing that I do differently is NO WHITE PEPPER.  The listed amount is entirely too much.  Other than that, this recipe is delicious and certainly tastes like the takeout cashew chicken around here!  Thanks!

This was sooo good!  I did make a few changes to get the fat content down.  First I mixed 2 cups of flour with 1/4 cup of cornstarch and sauteed the chicken in about 1/3 cup of oil until brown.  I removed the chicken and let it drain, then poured any leftover oil out of the pan.  I added the onion, and the sauce mix to the pan, cooked it til thick, and added the chicken back.  It wasn't as crunchy, but it was great.  Next time I'm just going to use sauteed chicken without any breading.

It's been many years since I've eaten Cashew Chicken like this and I don't remember the sauce having so much pepper.  If I make this recipe again I will cut the pepper in half.  We liked the chicken though.

This was a great recipe. I grew up in the Ozarks and found out quickly when I moved away that "cashew chicken" in other places was not the meal that I knew. The white pepper gave it a spicy zing. Next time I think I will reduce it just a bit.

I thought this was just OK.  I'm a Springfield, MO native, so my expectations are pretty high.  My husband, however, liked it very much.  In the future, I would cut way back on the white pepper.   1 t. was way too much.  I may also cut back on the oyster sauce as I like a less fishy-tasting sauce.  The chicken fried up beautifully and it made a nice presentation.

We love this recipe.  I've made a few modifications for our tastes: I only use 1 1/2 cups of cashew halves, I use 4 whole green onions and I reduce the amount of corn starch to 2T (can add more if needed).  Also, you need to use enough peanut oil so that it is about 1 inch deep in your pan.  Other than that, the recipe is AWESOME!  This recipe is requested quite often at our house.

I am sorry. I am from the Springfield area and no it doesn't taste like what I am use to. It had too much of a pepper taste to it and too much of a oyster taste.  
My husband liked it...but it is not what I am use too

I made this tonight and it was wonderful. I did add 2 T of peanut butter to the chicken broth before boiling and it really added depth. This will become part of my regular meal rotation even if it is kinda messy to make.

I live in Springfield and eat cashew chicken out quite a bit.  The chicken turned out well, however the sauce had WAY too much pepper.  Compared to the local sauces, I did not like it at all.  To purchase it out is about $4.00 per meal....so I will probably skip making this in the future.  A lot of work for a so-so sauce.

This was a hit with my husband.  The kids loved the chicken, sans sauce.  It was very much like what we remembered from college days in Springfield.  

Please note the comments about the white pepper.  I halved the amount called for and it was still very very peppery.  Next time, I will just put in a tiny pinch of the white pepper and adjust it from there.  I also think that I will add an extra tablespoon of oyster sauce.  (I did follow the updated instructions that Ms. Dennis added to the reviews section.)  

I'm not one to make any kind of chicken nugget/tender from scratch.  However, this was very much worth the effort and mess.  A friend recently gave me a deep fryer and I used it for the first time with this chicken and it came out incredible!

I was amazed at how the chicken turned out. This is the closest thing to resturant style I've made. The peanut oil was a great idea, and was the first time I've used it. I did add a bit of salt on top when served but next time I will add a little to the sauce. Great recipe, and easy. Thank you!

My wife and kids loved this. The second time I made it, my wife asked me to add diced water chestnuts, celery and some peas and carrots (not too much - all for texture and it's just the way she likes it). Just as good--didn't ruin the original recipe. I felt it was best served with fried rice but was good with plain rice also.

We are originally from Springfield, MO. When we moved to Tennessee. We could not find anyplace that made cashew chicken this way. We were so disappointed. I looked up this receipe about 10 years and have been making it ever since. You can't get ANY closer then this! If you go EXACTLY by this receipe. You will not be disappointed! I'd give it 10 stars if they had it!

I had breaded chicken tenders on hand so I did not do the chicken but the sauce seemed a little off to me. Much too much white pepper and otherwise seemed to bland for my crew. We live close to Springfield and have eaten our fair share of cashew chicken and this was not close to anything we've had.

This recipe is great... I've made it many times. In an effort to make it a little more healthy I have now been cooking the chicken in a skillet with light olive oil and no breading. Once the sauce is done i pour it over the chicken and add the cashews. It is very good, the family loves it. Also for those of you who have never used white pepper, it is extremely strong even for my family who like spicy foods. So, I would recommend to use a smaller amount.

The chicken itself was just as expected for the Springfield style. However, the sauce was not very good at all.

I made this recipe by stir frying the chicken in a tablespoon of oil instead of frying it.  Poured the sauce over and wa-la.  An amazing meal, quick and easy.

The best recipe I have found.  I lived in Springfield then and this is the closest thing to it.

I'm curious what springfield you got this recipe from.  This is closer to a general chicken than SPRINGFIELD, MO.  I would cut the amount of pepper. I would also suggest to many people trying this recipe to skip the flour, egg dip, flour, and go straight from the first flour coating to the fryer. Its way less messy.

The gravy was a little bit bland so I added a touch more soy and oyster sauces. I have never fried chicken in peanut oil before, and I was really impressed with how delicious, crispy and non-greasy it was. I'll definitely be using that in the future. Thanks!

The chicken was the best ever and deserves 5 stars by itself but the white pepper ruined the sauce and considering it’s not cashew chicken without the sauce... I gave it one star because I couldn’t eat it with the sauce. I strongly advise leaving out the white pepper.

What brand of oyster sauce do you use? I live in St Louis now but grew up in Springfield. The only thing I miss more than cashew chicken is my mom. I have made the sauce over the years but it's never the same. Oyster sauce I find up here it's too sweet.

I followed Teresa M's edits to the sauce and it was spot on to the Springfield Cashew Chicken I've had.  I really like some spice to this sauce so I added some cayenne during cooking it and worked go well!  

I also used tempura chicken from a Trader Joe's frozen meal and cooked it in my air fryer because I wanted something super easy and frying chicken is never easy for me.   This was a two thumbs up meal!

This reminds me of having Chinese food and it's so easy to make.  I did make some alternations: I didn't have oyster sauce, so I used soy sauce. I couldn't find white pepper at the store, so I used regular black pepper. I also swapped chicken broth for veggie broth and it came out fine. I used cashew pieces instead of halves. I just wished my sauce came out thicker and not clumpy. I would love to make it again.

This gives me flash backs of my college days, long ago. I cut back on the pepper and sugar in the sauce by about half and use fewer cashews. I also admit to cheating quite often and using Tyson chicken nuggets instead of going through the hassle and mess of coating and frying chicken.  Not quite as authentic, but still really, really good.  Don't forget the green onions - it isn't the same without them!  This is truly comfort food to me. Thanks!

I will not use as much chicken the next time or I will make more sauce.  Also I will not add as many cashews.  This was a very good recipe.  My husband liked it very much, and I plan to make it for company soon.

Made it just as the recipe dictated.  It was great.  The men in my family loved it and I will make it again.  Great flavor and the sauce was great.  My picky eater son just ate the fried chicken and loved it. It looks complicated but it was really so easy to make.  I suggest making the sauce first and roasting the cashews before starting the Chicken.

We lived in Springfield, MO and loved this dish that they had at the local places.  My surprise is when I got an email from this site with the recipe for this.  Had to make it and hubby said after his first bite...this is it.   It tasted just like what we had down in MO.

I have made several variations of cashew chicken, while trying to please my kids in satiable appetite. I had a few more things like carrots celery and water chestnuts all diced of course, this is hands-down the best cashew chicken recipe I have come across!

I really liked the sauce I did change a little I added broccoli and mushrooms, also breaded and fried the chicken in panko then cooked into peanut oil.
So I made the sauce, then fried all my battered and panko chicken placed all the done chicken in pan turned to highest setting and added sauce green onions (crushed cashews) sliced mushrooms and slightly cooked broccoli.  And tossed around for about 5-10 min. Then served atop of white rice.

I followed Teresa M's edits to original recipe. In my opinion, doesn't need the 1 1/2 tea. of sugar. I added 1 teaspoon and still thought it thrown off the flavor. Will make again- sans the sugar.

I never even knew this was a Missouri thing. I remember getting this a few times as a kid, I just called it breaded cashew chicken. found out the history of it and had to make it. I followed the recipe exactly minus the white pepper that I cut in half. turned out great. left overs were good too. had to bake the chicken to get it crispy again, and had to make a half batch of the sauce since the chicken had completely absorbed the original sauce in the fridge. All and all a good recipe.

I've made this numerous times, and we all love it! I actually got this recipe from a co-worker who'd gotten it from an employee at a restaurant located in El Dorado Springs, Missouri (approx. 80 miles northwest of  Springfield).   I read the review by the person who originally shared this recipe and the edit that she recommends, so I'll have to try making this again and see how it turns out.

Although this is very tasty, it is very hot/peppery.  I will back the white pepper down to about 1/4 tsp next time I make it.

I live just outside of Springfield, MO and of course I love cashew chicken. This recipe is perfect! I made it with the adjustments in the author's review. I did end up with more chicken than sauce so next time I will double the sauce or cook half of the amount of chicken. A+!

The flavors were amazing and the chicken was crisp, yet juicy. I would keep the recipe as is, except reduce the pepper and corn starch in the sauce by half. It was a little too thick and a little too peppery.

I follow the recipe exactly.  I like that is uses chicken broth instead of cubes...that makes it too salty for me.  I have never had it like this anywhere but my hometown!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is SO close. I've made this a few times and made adjustments every time, so I feel like I have this down for my particular taste from growing up just outside Springfield. This is my favorite DIY Springfield-style cashew chicken I've found, though it needs some tweaks, in my opinion. It's easy to make perfect, though. I think you need to double the sauce recipe; it simply isn't enough. I doubled the sauce, but kept the cornstarch slurry the same - otherwise the sauce is too thick. Also kept the sugar the same, otherwise it's too sweet. And as another reviewer wrote, it's too much pepper. Would recommend adding that to taste. And for anyone wondering, this works well with both regular and lower-sodium soy sauce.

The first time I had cashew chicken at my MIL's I didn't really care for it. She's from Springfield, Missouri so now I get it!

My husband wanted Mom's cashew chicken for Father's day and I ran across this recipe. He thought it was pretty close but said the sauce was heavy. (I am almost certain his mom has never had oyster sauce in her fridge!) Next time I will cut the amount down  by half.

OMG!! I moved to Florida from Springfield MO.  Let me tell you my daughter and I love this recipe.  It's a little taste of home.  Chinese food is definitely not the same here.  The other bonus is that this is really a 2 person recipe and we get to spend time in the kitchen together. :)

I followed the submitters April 13, 2009 version of the recipe. Being from Los Angeles, I have never tasted Springfield Style Cashew Chicken before. I was a bit skeptical, but it was a fantastic recipe -- very flavorful! Since I had no chicken broth on hand, I substituted with chicken bouillion and added thinly sliced button mushrooms and a pinch of butter to give the gravy richness. Next time I will be sure to have homemade chicken stock on hand.  I will also coat my chicken with potato starch instead of flour to give it an ultra crisp coating for frying.  I garnished my Cashew Chicken with red and yellow peppers and crisp green snow peas, as well as the green onions.  The meal was the perfect blend of crunch, gravy, color, and cashew nuttiness.    I will certainly make this "comfort style" dish again. It was a hit with my husband, too. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

Great recipe!  Chicken was great & the sauce was VERY close to Springfield... only a little bit salty.  Try this one tonight!  I'd suggest having 2 people make this (one for the chicken & one for the sauce) so it's done at the same time.

My fiance & I made this recipe for the family and we loved it, my teenagers said it needed to be added to our regular menu. LOL!. The first time we made it we had no white pepper and it missed that zing. So we had to make it again the next day because it was so good first time even with out the pepper. We used just a dash or so of regular pepper this time and it turned out perfect. This recipe takes us back to high school days at our favorite hangout. Awesome!! We did double the sauce it just didnt seem like enough.

OMG!!!!! I LOVE IT!!! Ive recently moved to a town that has about a dozen chinese Restaurants and not one of them makes cashew chicken this way. Which is the way i love mine, breaded of course, it reminds me of my favorite chinese place growing up. The first time we made it we had no white pepper so left it out entirely and it missed that zing. We added a dash of pepper or so bot the recommended amount and it came out great. This recipe is awesome!!!! My family loved it so much i had to make it two days in a row and it makes a lot. Just note when you change the servings for 2,4, 6 people etc., it does not adjust the second half of cornstarch amount needed so double check your measurements. we served over bed of fried rice and with the crab rangoon III recipe. ENJOY!!! .

Not too bad! Next time I will leave out the sugar in the sauce. I have lived in Springfield my whole life and have grown up eating plenty of Springfield style cashew chicken, and this recipe was a little too sweet. I also had to add a little more oyster sauce than called for. Overall a good recipe though!!

Trying to cut carbs, I just sauteed the chicken.  THE SAUCE WAS OUTSTANDING.  I made this for a former Springfield resident, and she said the sauce was just like it.  It was better than takeout.  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!

I don't normally eat cashew chicken, so I wasn't sure what it was supposed to taste like, but my husband assures me that it tastes just like what comes from a resturant.  I've made it twice now and both times I've had no leftovers.  I serve it with egg fried rice, the recipe is available on this site.

My family and I lived in Harrison, Arkansas for 10 years and always made it a point to get Cashew Chicken when we went to Springfield. I commented to my wife the other night that I sure would like some Cashew Chicken then got on-line and low and behold there was this recipe! I cooked it for my family last night and they ate it like they were going to the electric chair! Two thumbs up all around. The only thing I will change next time is to double the sauce recipe portions, other than that, it was just like good old Springfield Cashew Chicken! Yummy!!!!

Ok, I cheated and used   breaded chicken in a bag from Banquet that you make in the oven.  But-the sauce recipe was dead on perfect.  Just like we remember it.  Definately a do over at our house
