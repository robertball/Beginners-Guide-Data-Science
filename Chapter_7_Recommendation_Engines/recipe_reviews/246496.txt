These biscuits turned out pretty good. I used my own flour blend, and instead of vinegar I used buttermilk powder. I got sixteen biscuits and had them with gf gravy. Yum!

These are nice biscuits. They were soft yet held up to biscuits and gravy as well as being buttered and jammed. The texture is more cake-like than a dough. They are pretty good on their own. I did make a few alterations. I used buckwheat flour instead of millet. I made 10 servings instead of the original 15 biscuits. I don't know if this messed with the amounts of baking powder, but they didn't puff up at all. They came out of the oven the same height as when they went in. They were still light though. Thank you for the recipe.

If you love old-fashioned baking powder biscuits and are gluten free, these are awesome!  I needed to make some substitutions due to what I had in the house and yet, they turned out wonderful.  I subbed oat flour for the millet, and corn starch for the tapioca starch.  I may have rolled them too thin as I got way more than 15 biscuits.  But overall a great recipe!
