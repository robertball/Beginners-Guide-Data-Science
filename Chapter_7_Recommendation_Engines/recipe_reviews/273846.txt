Fantastic flavor! I doubled the cooking time and removed the chicken from the liquid to shred. I added just enough of the liquid to moisten the shredded chicken and added sauce. I would definitely make again!

Really yummy!   I gave the recipe 4 stars because I did have to cook the frozen chicken breasts longer than the recipe stated. I would recommend 20 minutes at pressure with npr. Since I live at high altitude, I had to cook it for 24 minutes. Remove the chicken to shred it. Then add enough of the broth back in to moisten the chicken before adding the bbq sauce. Great served on Hawaiian rolls with coleslaw.

Followed directions exactly - chicken wasn’t cooked thoroughly. Added another 4 min, then quick release pressure. Too much broth left. Removed chicken to shred, added 1/2 c. broth back to shredded chicken before adding BBQ sauce. Taste was good, but chicken was a little tough and I won’t make it again.
