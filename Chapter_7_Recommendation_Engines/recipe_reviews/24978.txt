Unbelievably good cake. Made this for a July 4th celebration and several people had two pieces at the party. The only thing I will change next time is I will save some of the sauce to pour over the top of the cake once I have removed it from the bundt pan. Even out the liqueur flavor throughout the cake.

This is a great "adult" cake to serve company.
Oddly, it seems less sweet than most cakes.
I have used any type of chocolate cake mix I happen to have on hand. Everyone loves it!

5 Stars for EASY - 4 for taste.   Second time I made, I didn't have all the right ingredients, so I modified a bit with crushed Chocolate Chip Teddy Grahams and peanuts for the crust, instant vanilla pudding instead of chocolate, and instant coffee diluted with water instead of liqueur - we liked it just the same.

Holy Toledo!  This cake is fantastic!  I used what I had or didn't have on hand.  I didn't have any pudding mix so I just cut the eggs back to 3.  I had both Coffee Liqueur and Creme de Cocoa so I put the creme de cocoa in the cake and used the coffee liqueur for the sauce.  Also, with the sauce I think I just used all liqueur and no water (it's been that kind of week), and I was running very low on margarine/butter so I used Cream of Coconut I had on hand.  FABULOUS CAKE!!  I was worried my cake would stick to my obstinate bundt pan so I dusted the pan with sugar.  The result of everything, including the sugar dusting, was a wonderfully sauced cake, a lightly crunchy coating, drool worthy sauce (what didn't soak into the cake making it super moist), a great texture, and a cake that holds itself together.  It was a little rich, but then again my makeshift ingredients were sweeter than called for.  At any rate, this is a new staple!!!

Wow! This was fantastic!!   You definitely want to poke many holes in the cake after it bakes.  I used about an eighth of a cup more of the coffee liqueur to pour over the cake.

Wow this cake is delicious . Followed recipe pretty closely except for: adding sugar sprinkled into the buttered pan along with pecans . Also since cake mixes are smaller now I added 2 Tbsp. Cocoa and a pinch of baking soda to the dry ingredients. This made it very chocolatey and took the edge off the sweetness. 
Made this for a book club Christmas Party and it was a hit.
Next time I will try using cold coffee in stead of water in the cake mix.
 Sauce / syrup was delicious addition and made the cake.

Unfortunately, I did not experience the great cake that so many of these other reviews talk about.  First, this recipe must have been written before the sizes of the cake mix and pudding have decreased.  Due to this, I put a slightly lower amount of oil and water into the mix.  Next, the cake tasted a lot like a straight box cake.  I had hoped the extra ingredients would have made it taste more homemade.  Finally, there was so much sauce and I could not get the cake to absorb much of it in the center (even with the holes).  The sauce ended up being a mostly messy greasy liquid around the cake plate.

Ever since making this for friends the first time, it's requested any time I ask if I can bring dessert!
