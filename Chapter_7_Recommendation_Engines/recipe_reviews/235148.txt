Ridiculously sweet and tangy. Almost too rich. Sweet on sweet on sweet was a bit much, I think. Once in a year type of thing.

My mom used to make this when I was a kid and I tracked down this recipe on a bit of a nostalgic trip. There are other recipes on the internet that call for pudding mix....avoid those and make this one! I followed recipe exactly, turned out delicious and rich, just as I remembered.

When I want dessert I want to know that is what Iâ€™m having...  this fits the bill.   It is yummy sweetness!    Over the top sweetness.   When I make it my sons devour it along with taking it to potlucks it disappears.   Like I said, straight yumminess

I only use about a half cup of confectioners sugar.  Can be used with any candy bars. Our family go to for birthdays!
