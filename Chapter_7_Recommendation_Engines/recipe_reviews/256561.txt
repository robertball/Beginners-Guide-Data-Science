12.27.16   I blended this, tasted it, and then realized I’d forgotten the grapefruit juice.  Added the grapefruit juice, blended again, and I must say that I liked it better without the grapefruit juice which IMO left a bit of an aftertaste.  I liked the freshness of this smoothie and the fact that you’re “drinking” healthy veggies, but this one didn’t win over my hubby.  If I were to make again, I think I’d skip the grapefruit juice (just personal taste preference).

The grapefruit juice ruins it.  Leave it out completely and this might be good.

I liked this, though I did feel that the grapefruit juice overpowers all other flavors. A little less of that, and I think this is certainly a keeper smoothie!
