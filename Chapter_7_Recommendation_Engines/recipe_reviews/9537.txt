This recipe is PHENOMENAL! An instant hit... melts in your mouth and is very esthetically pleasing! I cut into small squares and served in candy cups. Next time I would consider pouring into mini cups to set - like Reese's PB Cups. Will definitely repeat this one!

I made three batches of this for Christmas this year and was asked for the recipe multiple times. It was always the first candy to disappear form the plate. I use smooth peanut butter and like it best with white almond bark. It gets too soft with white chocolate chips. My son claims it's better than the Rocky Mountain Chocolate factory version,

Okay, maybe I did something wrong but I followed all of the directions and this didn't turn out. It looked terrible when I was done and didn't taste very good. It seemed like it was missing something. I ate one piece, and my younger sister tasted it. Not sure what happened but I probably won't try it again to find out...thanks anyway

5 stars on flavor, would line pan next time, hard to remove from pan without sticking.

Tastes wonderful!  I don't know what I did wrong.  I used a natural/organic peanut butter.  May be that was it.  This tasted wonderful but did not look pretty.  It was either too hard to cut or too soft  and crumbly.  I just couldn't get it out of the pan looking edible.

This candy is sinfully good. The only thing I did wrong (and I wish I'd followed my instincts) is to have not used parchment paper. I made these to give in holiday gifts and I lost a quarter of the batch because they stuck to the pan. Delicious recipe.

Very tasty and very sweet. 1 batch makes a whole lot of candy. I used almond bark and it melts nicely. Be careful of your milk chocolate though. Just heat it til it JUST melts. I burnt the first cup. I used a long fork to scrape the chocolate and "fling it" all over the white choc/pb mixture. Just keep scraping and flinging. It will not drip.

Yum!  I only had semi-sweet chocolate chips and it was still awesome.  I'll be adding to cookie trays for Christmas.  Thanks!

This was very good.  I don't know what I did wrong but mine kept crumbling and the different chocolate seperated from each other.  It still tastes very good.

Excellent!  So easy to make and everyone at work keeps asking me to make it again.  I didn't have chunky peanut butter so I used smooth and it was delicious.  I made it in mini paper cups and it worked out well.

I've made this for a few years with Christmas baking and everyone loves it (and it's even gluten free for those who need it as long as you check the peanut butter). I always make it in a 9x9 baking dish, and my only complaint is that it's always on the soft side and never really firms up. It does also have a tendency to stick, so you have to work it out of the pan a bit. Nonetheless it's delicious enough to keep making!

SOOO easy and tasty!  My whole family loved it, it tastes like a Reeses peanut butter cup.  I reversed the chocolates so there was less white and used one package (~20 oz) chocolate almond bark and 1/2 package white almond bark with creamy peanut butter, and added 1/4 cup peanut butter to the white chocolate so it would all set the same.  It turned out melt-in-your-fingers soft but still hard enough to cut and not be messy.  I don't know how the negative reviewers could have messed up something this simple but it's definitely going to be made again and again in my house!
