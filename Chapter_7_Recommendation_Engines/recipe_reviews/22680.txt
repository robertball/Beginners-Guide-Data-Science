I modified this recipe, I just needed more substance... so I added spinach, stewed tomatoes, tomato paste, garlic salts and chicken! Was great with the tortellini pasta, made it a nice italian soup with crusty bread on the side, Yum!

This tasted like water not soup. It needs a lot more flavor. I do not recommend this.
