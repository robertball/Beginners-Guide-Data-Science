Nice spin on the traditional "Insalata Caprese".  Tomato and basil are a classic combination and when paired with fresh mozzarella you have something so simple and so delicious you could make a meal out of this all by itself! The addition of the spinach is not only delicious, but is good for you too! I like to add a bit of sea salt along with fresh cracked black pepper. I NEVER refridgerate this and if you want to add a little pizzaz add some thin sliced red onion or spinkle with a bit of red pepper flakes- perfect served with Italian bread and a nice wine!

This salad was delicious. Just as a Caprese salad should be. I have made this a few times and find that using balsamic glaze instead of vinegar will take the bite off the dressing. It is much sweeter so it changes the taste of the salad, but it has a more rounded and mellow flavor.

good basic recipe to start with.  I kicked it up a notch by adding thinly sliced red onion, used cherry tomatoes, some slivered almonds(the kind thats used for salad toppings)and slices of roasted chicken with the spinach.  I didn't have mozzarella so used feta.  I also added garlic, basil,oregano, salt & pepper and about a ts of sugar to my dressing.  It was fantastic.  My daughter threw in some honey roasted macadamia nuts in her salad (instead of almonds)and it was even better.

Delicious salad that I eat all the time.  It's the exact same one on the South Beach Diet.  I think it's best when you use equal amounts of balsamic vinegar and olive oil and sprinkle on a little salt & pepper.   Highly recommended if you like spinach!

This salad is pretty good. I increased the amounts of everything so I could make a large batch & save for other days. Also, I made this into a tossed salad, unlike instructions speciify. Well, I decided to "splurge" and actually buy fresh mozzarella - maybe I'm too cheap. :D And, after having it for the first time in a long time, I actually decided that I like the "cheap" stuff better. The Polly-O brand of mozzarella is the best! It is soft, but has a great flavor. To the salad, I also added some dried basil along with the fresh. I love basil & also thought that it helped disperse flavor evenly. One funny thing is that, due to the balsamic vinegar, the mozzarella looked almost like mushrooms once everything was tossed. :) I added some extra EVOO after deciding that I used too much vinegar. I made this, then refrigerated it overnight and the spinach wilted nicely.

I had limited items on hand so I used romaine instead of spinach, dried basil instead of fresh and red wine vinegar instead of balsamic.  I just layered everything.  I know it would be better with the fresh basil but it was still very good this way!

This was a delicious side to the cedar plank grilled salmon for a truely summer time meal. The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle the spinach layer with a little olive oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper and then repeat after the layer of tomatoes and mozzarella to make sure all received a good splash. Kosher salt and pepper and a brief rest before serving make this dish a beautiful company presentation (the colors of the Italian flag!).

I couldnt find balsamic vinegar, but i got red wine vinegar and it was really good with the mozzarella and spinach, and i used salt and pepper that made the tomatoes seem sweeter. it was great with crab cakes and almond stuffed pears!

This was great! Used recipe pretty much as is. I had grape tomatoes and halved those. cut the mozzarella into smaller cubes and this just made for easier eating.  I did use extra basil (my family likes basil) and this was fantastic.  Loved that this extended the caprese salad.

This salad was very good although I used my own balsamic dressing and we tossed to me more of a salad.  I also added bits of bacon and it came out wonderful!

This salad is delicious.  I added more olive oil and some pepper for my own taste since I am an olive oil lover, but absolutely great recipe!

Pretty good! Next time I may just drizzle olive oil and forget the balsamic, but that's just a personal taste.  Nice take on the tradtional caprese salad.

Good idea, but the ratios are way off. I used half as much mozzarella, basil, and balsamic vinegar as the recipe called for. And it was still too much basil (for appearance and taste). I made it a second time halving the mozzarella and balsamic again, with just a light sprinkle of basil until it looked good - much better.

Perfect as written! Yum yum yum!! Caprese salad is supposed to be simple so I think adding anything else to it makes it a different salad.

I made some changes to this recipe using the greens that I had on hand. I used fresh mesclun mix from the farmer's market. I also added some fresh ground black pepper and sea salt garlic grinder mix. I used basil from my porch herb garden. Yum,yum,yum.

Outstanding summer dish!  Per other reader's comments I added a little red onion.  Did not use the balsamic - was afraid of the rest of the salad being overwhelmed.  Also mixed in a little cold pasta.  Absolutely delicious with the pasta and just the basil / olive oil.

Good salad but needs salt and pepper.  I only use half of the balsamic vinegar as I found it too strong tasting with 2 tbsps.

WINNER! Thanks to a the reviewer ideas: layered spinach, sliced mozz, thin slice red onion, sliced tomato, sprinkled s&p and dried basil, sprinkled with evoo and balsamic vinegar. YUM! served with six whole shrimp around the edge of each plate and Chicago hard rolls. A light, filling, refreshing, delish dinner. TEN STARS : )

Love this, just what a caprese salad should be!  I make this to the recipe, except I hit it with just a touch of salt and fresh ground pepper.  I follow South Beach Diet, I think that I am going to try this for lunch next week for a change.  Very flavorful!

Can't go wrong with this salad - we added some freshly ground salt and pepper but otherwise followed the recipe as directed.  Thanks!

Loved this one.  Attractive presentation.  Easy to plate individually ahead of serving time and keep chilled in frig.  I increased the balsamic vinegar to my taste.

Great salad!  My girls like their dressing a little sweet so I added honey to the dressing.  I also added cilantro to the salad.  My family loved it!

I was invited to a potluck a half hour before it started, and I needed a quick spinach recipe. This one was great! I just used it as a basis and chopped up the tomato and mozzarella, threw it all in a bowl and it was delicious!

I wanted something different than the usual caprese salad and I enjoyed the spinach base in this. It's a nice variation. Highly recommended. Thank you.

Unfortunately I had to sub in dried basil for fresh, but it was excellent even with the dried.   I made no other changes and I thought it was excellent.

I liked this recipe! I did make a couple adjustments. I added onion and zucchini, then tossed the salad with salt and pepper before adding the dressing. In the dressing I added a little garlic and lemon juice, then tossed it in the salad. Took about 10 mins to throw together!!

I love having Caprese as a greener salad.  No matter how I make it, I always add italian herbs to the oil (including a sprinkle of Aleppo red pepper flakes) and a quick grind of fresh black pepper.  When it isn't yet tomato season, I make this but use halved grape tomatoes and marinated mozzarella balls.  Unless I'm serving it at a party, I toss all of the ingredients together - it's delicious and easy!  I've also added a cup or two of cooked pasta (just add more oil and vinegar and basil), to make it a meal.   Yum!

Simple and delicious! You bet I will make it again! Hint: I did not have fresh basil leaves so I used Gourmet Garden's  fresh Basil "stir in paste" that comes in a tube in the fresh herbs section of the grocery store. It tastes the same as fresh leaves and keeps longer in the refrigerator.

This is a fast, easy, attractive and fairly tasty salad when I prepared it exactly as posted.  Thus the four stars. There are only two of us so with the leftover basic recipe I made the following changed/additions for the next evening.  To the greens I added a few slivers of thinly sliced red onion. To the dressing I added 1 clove of roasted garlic paste 1/4 tsp of dried Basil and Oregano and a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper.  The addition of the spices to the dressing made it a little more Capreseish to my taste.  Also, may I suggest preparing the dressing ahead in a small bowl and allow to sit while you prepare the main course.  This allows the flavors to blend a little.

I used big spinach; I should have tried the baby spinach. However, I thought the spinach did take away from the Caprese salad, just a little bit.

Very easy to make and extremely tasty.  I added a lot more basil and mozzarella because I love both so much.  Made with lemon cream pasta with chicken and garlic bread, this salad was an essential component to a wonderful meal!
