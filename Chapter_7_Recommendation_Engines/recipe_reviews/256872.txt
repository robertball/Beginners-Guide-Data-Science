I was a bit skeptical at first because the seasonings and flour had just been sprinkled on. While I was prepping, I thought 'I've gotta get my hands dirty, these babies look like they need a good rub!' But opted to follow directions precisely, leaving out the poultry seasoning and subbing that with a dash of sage. I also just drizzled sunflower oil over the drumsticks, as the cooking spray I had probably would have blasted the flour and seasonings right off of the chicken and all over the walls. I was astonished at how well they turned out! I let them bake covered for 3 hours and uncovered for 20 minutes since the drumsticks I used were still a bit frosty after leaving them thawing in the fridge for 2 and 1/2 days. The excess flour in the pan made me wonder, but the juice from the chicken cooked with it, turning it into a nice broth. I'll most definitely be using this recipe again. Thank you for posting this!

This recipe came out perfect.  I made a couple of changes based on what I had on hand and not from dissatisfaction with the recipe.

- Pan spray:  I mixed all of the dry ingredients together in olive oil, applying the mixture with a basting/pastry brush.
- Flour:  I crushed boxed stuffing cubes in the blender and sprinkled those on instead.

I followed all other instructions to the letter.  Be careful of chicken juice if you are using a shallower pan like I did.

The drumsticks came out great, very tender and tasty!

Made as written and these were fall off of the bone tender alright! These were great and I don't think the bbq sauce was even necessary.

Taste was great but when cooked according to directions, was still raw!!! So really, couldn't eat it but rated according to taste. At the end of the prescribed time, I added another 30 minutes at 375 and then another 15 min under the broiler.

Probably won't make again. Too much time for the final product.

Did it in a crock pot at high for four hours and had the BBQ sauce as a side to spoon on as desired.

Very tasty and so easy...just measure spices and put in the oven!!  I didn't have  Cajun seasoning so I used a spicy sweet chicken rub.  It turn out delicious , not sure it could have been better with the Cajun spice.  Will definitely make again.

I made this exactly as written, and it was a huge hit with the whole family.  Easy-peasy to make, and fall-off-the-bone moist too!

I followed the it was good. The chicken fell off the bone. Unfortunately I didn't have enough BBQ sauce as the recipe called for. Next time I will.

Fanastic!  The meat was so tender and falling off the bone.  Cooked in a crock pot on high for 2 hours, then on low for 2 hours.  Added the Bbq sauce halfway through the low setting cooking time.  The kids deemed this one a make-it-again meal.

I’m the only vegetarian in my family so family dinners are based off the opinions of my family and here is what they thought. My hubby and all my kids loved it. The only change I made was I used a different seasoning for the poultry seasoning and I did not add barbecue sauce the last 30 minutes. Besides that I followed everything else. They all said it was perfect and fell right off the bone. I’m adding this one as a keeper for future family recipes!

Made with rib rub because I didn’t have any Cajun rub. I mixed the spices and flour with olive oil and rubbed it on the chicken before baking. Delicious and incredibly easy.

Excellent!  I used ground flaxseed instead of flour yo stay compliant on Whole30.
