I've been making these for 30 yrs.I use a 16 oz. can of apple pie filling and 10 eight" flour tortillas.I warm them in the microwave for about 5 seconds to make them pliable and lay them all out -dividing apples equally.Roll up like burritos,quickly.I have a cookie sheet (lined /w/ paper towels) and fry 2 at a time.While still hot-dust with powdered sugar.This whole process takes about 15 min.I first began making this when our circle of 5 families would go out many miles away for our annual woodcutting.Each family (legally) needed a cord of wood.So everyone worked all day for the weekend and I made these (I call them Flautas) for extra calories.Easily 4 batches in an hour to take.It got to be a tradition and now too old to go cutting.Everyone still wants them for Christmas-we love making them and the grand kids know how to.Thought I'd share.

I had saved this recipe a long time ago and why it took me so long to make it I have no clue. These are absolutely amazing. Both the wife and I thought they tasted better than imagined and after frying the flour tortillas they had kind of a pie dough flavor to them. I recommend using a shaker for the cinnamon/sugar  in order to have more control of the amount. Make sure you add the cinnamon/sugar while the are still hot using tongs to turn. I drizzled the chimichangas with caramel syrup.

I've been making this for years but I do add a few things.

when rolling them up I add a bit of cream cheese to the center to give it a bite. 

to serve I cut them at an angle and add a scoop of ice cream (fried ice cream if I can find it) then drizzle with caramel sauce! very yummy and great for those super lazy days when all you want is junk food!

We REALLY like these!  So good and so easy.  Only thing I did differently is to use uncooked flour tortillas.  These are like little hand pies.  Next time I plan to try some pumpkin filling and some other fruits. I having one for breakfast right now, with a cup of coffee.  Delicious! Thanks for the recipe, this will be a regular in our house.

the taste was truly awesome, the only thing , the ends of the tortillas unfolded' But still nice light and easy recipe.
