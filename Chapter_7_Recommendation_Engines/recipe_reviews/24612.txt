This batter turned out very good. I thought it overpowered the cheese but it was wonderful with mushrooms and zuchini. Also make sure the cheese is frozen or it will melt and leak out of the crust.

This batter is very plain.It lacks consistency You would be better off with breaded cheese sticks.

This was pretty good. After dipping into the batter I rolled them in Panko breadcrumbs and then fried.

I just couldn't get them to stay solid. The cheese kept melting in the oil. It made a huge mess.

The batter is thin very thin. Most of the cheese stuck to the spatula while I was attempting to retrieve. Hubby ate them well it is fried cheese dipped in marinara but I do not recommend this method.
