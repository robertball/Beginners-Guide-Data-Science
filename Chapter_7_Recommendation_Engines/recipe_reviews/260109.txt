I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts because that is what my wife prefers, and that requires some changes to the recipe, but not such that it becomes unrecognizable from the original. I cut the chicken breasts in half and did not brown them. Chicken breasts tend to dry out fairly quickly. I then cooked them for 6 minutes instead of 11. They were perfectly cooked.

I added an extra pound of mushrooms, an extra tbsp of tomato paste, and used better than bouillon instead of bouillon cubes. If you go the better than bouillon route you will need to add salt. Bouillon cubes are salty by themselves. 

Finally, after it was cooked I removed the chicken, turned the instant pot to sauté, reduced the sauce and added some corn starch to thicken it even more. I then shredded the chicken into large chunks and returned it to the sauce for about 2 minutes.

Except for the added mushrooms and tomato paste I did little to change the taste, and I have to say it was and is wonderful. It is great the first time you eat it and better the second and third time. 

A great recipe. Thank you.

Winner winner chicken dinner! This really does taste like it has simmered all day, and there is such depth of flavor. I followed the ingredients exactly, except that I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before browning.  I added in the tomato paste before adding in the chicken so I could stir it around easily to blend it in.  My chicken thighs were rather large (8-9oz) so I set the Instant Pot for 12 mins instead of 11. Once the cycle was done, I removed the lid and simmered on LOW for 5 more minutes since the chicken was a little underdone. I then removed the chicken and simmered the sauce an additional 10-15 mins to thicken it up, as suggested in the recipe notes.  The herbes de provence really make this dish! Absolutely DELICIOUS!

Thought the chicken was stringy. I cooked a different but similar Instant Pot ecipe earlier this week that was a lot less hassle, and which just called for the raw chicken to be cooked for 11 minutes, then sit in NPR for another 11. If I were to make this again I would not saute the chicken  first. I would saute the  veggies and then cook the chicken without sautéing it.

Flavors meld together like they've been simmering all day in a fraction of the time. A couple of small changes - I season the chicken prior to sauteeing. Instead of chicken bouillon cubes, I started using Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base as it contains much less salt and seems to have more flavor. I also added a small jar of Mancini Roasted Peppers (drained). I also NEVER use QR (quick release) for any poultry or meat as I find the meat comes out tough & rubbery. I cancel the pressure, then let the pot sit & NR (naturally release pressure) 15-20min. With that said, this dish is wonderful served over garlic mashed potatoes or if keeping to a low carb diet, over mashed cauliflower. YUM!!  Thanks, Diana71. My family loves this!

This was very good ... I used frozen boneless skinless chicken thighs and increased the time to 13 minutes instead of 8 minutes.  I did not brown the thighs, because they were frozen.  I mixed the tomato paste with the stewed tomatoes; placed the frozen chicken thighs on top of the tomato mixture.  I seasoned the chicken with the Herbes de Provence, and then piled the sauteed onion, celery, and mushrooms on top.  Then, added the water and 3 tsp. of Tones Chicken Base.  It was on the salty side, as I don't normally add much salt to my cooking.  I think I will try 2 tsp. of the Chicken Base.

Delicious over cauliflower rice! I sprinkled some oregano and thyme in with the vegetables. Will add this one to the “make again” list.

It was delicious.  My husband loved it.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes.  I checked recipes for stewed tomatoes call for a little sugar.  I added 2 tsp sugar with a can of tomatoes.  It turned out great, I will use stewed tomatoes next time.

I definitely will make it again. I used an 8-pack of thighs, so I doubled all ingredients. No mushrooms on-hand, so I added diced zucchini and chopped kalamata and green olives. I sauteed the veggies, not the thighs. Inserted the trivet and stacked the thighs. About 1.5 cups of chicken broth, 14 oz can of tomato sauce, 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes, and a 6 oz. can of tomato paste was mixed and dumped over the chicken.  Eleven minutes of high pressure, ten minutes of natural release, and ten minutes to reduce on sautee with the spices added. Delicious! The thighs came out as tender as a big-box store's rotisserie chicken.

Lots of flavour, easy to make.  Will reduce chicken bouillon to 2 (was a little salty for our taste). Pick up the Herbs de Provence wonderful blend of herbs that really add to the flavour.  Will be sharing this recipe and making it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Nice flavor. Only thing I did differently was not to include mushrooms because I hate them. Will definitely make again.

Although I made a few changes based on what I had in my pantry, this recipe still warrants a solid five. Based on another review's recommendation, I used chicken breasts cut into chunks and did not saute them. I also diced three REAL carrots (not the carrot nubs everyone is buying these days) and made my own mixture of Herbes de Provence based on an internet search of what this mixture is comprised of and which, singularly, I did have at hand. In addition, I substituted a quarter of an ounce of sun dried tomatoes (not packed in oil) for the tomato paste. And instead of boullion cubes, I used Better than Boullion. After sauteing the veggies, I added everything but the chicken and pasta and put it under pressure for 15 minutes with a quick release and a good stir. I then added the chicken and put it under pressure for another 8 minutes, again with a quick release and another good stir. Finally, I added 3.6 ounces of penne pasta (with a good stir both before and after you cook) and put it under pressure for another ten minutes with a quick release. Served it with garlic bread, salad and parmesan for sprinkling and it was fabulous! The Instant Pot rocks!

This was a very simple and very tasty meal! I substituted Rotel for the diced tomatoes to give it some heat, then served the broth and veggies over rice along side of the chicken. Really good! Great recipe!

Incredible!  Didn’t have stewed tomatoes so I used regular canned tomato sauce. Still wonderful. An added surprise was the sauce thickened in the leftovers; made it even better.

This is one of my favorite recipes for my Instant Pot! I use chicken breasts and dredge them in flour, which helps thicken the sauce. I also use red wine instead of water which adds some extra flavor.

Amazing! This as all I can say about this meal! I made it the other night with the following modifications:
1. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.
2. I used Italian Seasoning in place of the Herbs de Provence
3. I used Better than Bouillon (2 teaspoons) instead of 3 cubes.
I did saute the chicken for about 6 minutes per side first in the Instant Pot (excellent kitchen device by the way!!) Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. Cooked the chicken for the full 11 minutes.
Can I say "amazing" again? This dish will make your family and friends drool! And it makes YOU look like a very seasoned and talented cook! Add this one to my "dinner list!" And it was SO easy! The taste was incredible!

This dish came out good. Next time I might cook it a bit shorter because the chicken was a bit softer than I would've liked.  Otherwise, it tased great.

Simple enough to make - this was the first thing I tried making when we got our Instant Pot, and it was a delightful experience. The chicken was delicious and tender without being over-seasoned, the sauce tasty. The flavors are subtle, which I liked a great deal - I could taste everything I put into the pot, none of the ingredients drowning out the flavors of everything else. I will say that the sauce is a bit thin at the end, so I'll probably do something to thicken it up in future - more paste, or cornstarch, etc, we'll see... but this will be made again!

This was my first attempt with my new Instant Pot and it turned out good. The sauce was really good.  I didn't have the tomato paste, so I had to thicken the sauce with corn starch, added some salt and pepper to the sauce and spooned it over the rice and chicken.  I made the stew with the leftover chicken and sauce, so I'm getting two meals out of this recipe.

I will make this again!  The whole family enjoyed this dish served over wide egg noodles with peas on the side.  Here are the changes I made.  I accidentally added the entire small can of tomato paste and I didn't have herbes de Provence so I used 1 teaspoon oregano and 1 teaspoon thyme instead.  I also used boneless thicken thighs without browning them, as some suggested, and  cooked  it  all for  13 minutes.  Since  I was leaving the house I let the pressure bleed off naturally .  When I came home I removed the tender chicken from the pot and turned on the saute feature. 
Once the sauce was bubbling I thickened it with a little corn starch and water. Then I added the chicken back to the sauce and served.

This was so good and really easy! It was my first time using my instant pot and I really enjoyed it. The chicken was so tender and delicious and it was so easy to put together! I might make a few changes the next time I make it, but that’s personal preference, not because the original isn’t great! I’m definitely adding this to my go to recipes!

Wow.  Was looking to use a can of peeled yellow tomatoes I bought by accident.  Being an average cook, here's what I did and it was DELICIOUS. 
Cento yellow tomatoes instead of stewed red
3 tsp minced garlic from jar (cleaning out fridge)
1 whole chopped onion
1/2 bag cauliflower
tiny multicolor potatoes - about 1cup cut in 1/2
Italian seasoning (never heard of herbs de province)

Followed instructions, just increased/added ingredients above.  Even boyfriend loved it, and to him everything is "good." 

Also followed another reviewer's advice to let the Instant Pot naturally release steam, so chicken fell apart. 

Reviewers are right - flavors blended beautifully and tasted like it cooked all day!

Changes:  1 sliced red pepper (could use 2), 28 oz can diced tomatoes and 1/2 c tomato sauce that I already had, a generous 1/2 c of red wine.  I also had some sun dried tomatoes on hand that I decided to throw in.  No complaints on that.  All yummy and good to go.

I thought the flavours of this recipe were excellent. My children both enjoyed it and my daughter who eats very little meat finished her entire piece of chicken thigh. The only change I made was to add an extra can of stewed tomatoes and I also threw in a can of artichoke hearts as I had some on hand. I did find it too watery but I didn't follow the submitter's suggestion to saute the sauce after the pressure cooking finished. Next time I will definitely allow myself more time to thicken the sauce at the end because that was the only downfall to tonight's dinner.

Simple and delicious! I used a package of boneless, skinless chicken thighs (6 thighs total) and diced tomatoes instead of stewed (as that is what I had on hand). Other than those to slight modifications, I followed the recipe to a "T". We really enjoyed this, and I will definitely make this again - but will cut the chicken cubes back to 2, or try the "Better than Bouillon", as suggested by another reviewer, as this was a bit too salty for our tastes. UPDATE (2-24-19): I just made this again, using chicken legs, and I cut the chicken bouillon cubes back to 1-1/2 cubes, and it was perfect!

Good basic recipe that can be customized to taste and ingredients on hand. Made with 2-lbs of chicken pieces and added a cut up green pepper.  Used a tablespoon of Better Than Bouillon instead of 3 bouillon cubes. Used dry white wine instead of water.

Cooked at high pressure for 10-minutes, waited 5-minutes and then opened the vent valve. Even the breast was moist and tender.

Excellent! Lovely flavor overall and very tender chicken. I've had chicken cacciatore many times in my life, in some cases cooked by native Italians; this rates as one of the very best preparations. Small changes I made: three cloves of garlic rather than two, doubled the amount of mushrooms, used only two bouillion cubes, and I heated the sauce after pressure cooking to thicken it a bit.

This turned out great. Only change I made was to add a dash of white wine and scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spatula before putting the chicken back in, which adds some extra flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

I cooked the chicken about 40 minutes, which was probably too long, BUT it fell off the bone! I did not use the celery. I used red fresh peppers, onions, salt and pepper. The chicken skin stuck to the Instant Pot container, but once I put the canned mushrooms and diced tomatoes in, I was able to loosen the bits and everything turned out well. I would probably put less liquid in it the next time. Otherwise, it was great!

This was my very 1st Instant Pot recipe. I followed it with the addition of artichokes and using cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end of cooking. I served it over Lundberg Jasmine Brown Rice (microwave pouch) and it was delicious. Next time I will try chicken breasts.

Mmmmmk, so this was my maiden voyage on my new IP Ultra.  In fact, it was my first ever attempt at using a pressure cooker.
This is gonna be a long review because if you are like me, a newbie, you appreciate lengthy details!
I read up on the IP before it was delivered and watched a bunch of YT videos. I "kinda" knew some of the challenges I might face (mainly the BURN issue) so I had a heads up. I also read the reviews here to comb through feedback for other issues.
I have made this dish traditionally so I already knew I'd probably alter it a bit.  I compared a half dozen recipes looking for additional ingredients I might want.
Let me preface this by saying my dish came out PHENOMENAL! Also, I was aiming for more of a "stew" texture as I'd be putting it over roasted spaghetti squash.

Heres what I changed:
3/4 onion instead of 1/2
4 cloves garlic pressed instead of 2 minced
2 tsp. Better Than Bouillon instead of cubes 
28 oz. can crushed tomatoes instead of 14 oz stewed
1/2 can tomato paste instead of 2 T

Here's what I added:
3/4 cup bell pepper ( I mixed green and red) and cooked with the celery etc.
1 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder... mixed together with the Herbs de Provence.
Mixed 1 TBL balsamic, 1TBL Worcestershire, 2 tsp Better than Bouillon, 3 TBL capers. Added when the "cubes" were to be added. 

I put my IP on Saute (remember this is my FIRST time ever) and watched as it preheated. The oil eventually started to smoke while preheating

I made this last night to serve over spaghetti and wow - it was terrific.  I used 3 boneless chicken breasts because that's what i had on hand and used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  I made the mistake of sprinkling salt and pepper on the chicken before i browned it - the additional salt was not necessary and i will omit next time.  I may also try adding a bit of red wine next time.  As other reviewers have suggested after releasing the pressure and taking the lid off:  put it back on saute while you boil the pasta.  It cooks down and gives a thicker consistency.  It's on regular rotation this winter :)

For a true cacciatore (hunter's stew), add some (half cup) diced smoked ham and about 1/4 cup frozen peas.  Otherwise, this recipe is spot on!

Soooooo good! The family loved it! Sautéed the sauce after to make it thicker and even had sauce left over! Used it over eggs for breakfast this morning. Delicious. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

I had to switch the steps around a little bit because I had frozen chicken breasts instead of thighs. Even so, it was delicious! (I cook in stages, I made it tonight, tomorrow I will make pasta to serve with it.)

How do I explain this? Both my husband and I initially agreed that it didn’t taste like anything special. However with every bite, we just wanted more and very soon we realized we couldn’t stop.

Made this recipe exactly as is and it turned out PERFECT in my 6 qt! It was SO good. 

I did get a burn notice once, but I turned it off, did the quick release and then gave a stir and turned it back on and it worked out great. It was slightly watery once finished, but I let it sit for a few minutes after opening and it thickened up, and once put over rice it was perfect. Would definitely suggest using the chicken thighs, they add so much flavour! This was only my second instant pot recipe I've tried but I will definitely make this again!

I used some additional spices like Herbes d Provence and Garlic herb seasoning. It was a little soupy so I added brown rice and it turned out excellent and VERY filling

I ate too much! It was good, but I think next time I will skip the browning step. I threw what veggies I had, including radishes (low carb). I let it natural release too, it was ready to eat in 30 or 40mins.

Simple and great! I added a red pepper and used chicken broth instead of water. I had 7 chicken thighs so I added an extra can of stewed tomatoes. Served it over jasmine rice. Impressive recipe in no time!!

It's a little longer than 1  hour cook, but that's OK.  It tastes outstanding since the seared skin soaks up the spices and tomatoes.  Note:  I left out the red pepper since the littles aren't much for that kinda thing.

This sauce was incredible!  I had to substitute 2 boneless breasts cut in half for the thighs, and green and red peppers (total of 1 cup) for the celery, just so I wouldn't have to go to the store.  I lessened the cook time to 6 minutes with 10 minutes NPR because breasts tend to be drier.   I highly recommend this recipe!  My husband and 20-year-old daughter agreed, it's a keeper.

I loved it...but I cut each chicken thigh into thirds.  I served over egg noodles also.  Reminds me of my German mom thinking she was cooking an exotic Italian dish,lol.

My family really liked this recipe, but we felt it was a little too oily.  We're going to try again with skinless chicken thighs and only 1 tbsp olive oil.  The flavor was great, though.

Excellent!  I made slight changes to the juices which I reduced down to a sauce.  First, I used 1/2 water and 1/2 old white wine for the liquid and added a tablespoon of cider vinegar.  Then to reduce the juices, I removed the chicken and "sauteed" the juices in the Instant Pot.  Also I added a cup of flour to thicken the juice. Then when it was the consistency that I wanted, I turned off the heat, let it stop boiling and added 3/4 cup of sour cream to make a sauce.  I had some day-old cornbread, warmed up and  plated  the triangle of corn bread, sliced it open, then placed a chicken thigh on each slice and poured heaping spoonfuls of the rich sauce over it.   I had had this type of dinner in Switzerland in the 1980's.  And the cornbread, instead of the typical egg noodle or rice as the base,  always stuck in my mind because I am from the South and had never had such a savory sauce and meat poured over cornbread before.

came out okay. A little heavy on the spices. Would I make it again, maybe, but with some changes for certain.

I'l make it again. Easy and tasty. Used chicken breasts and pressure cooked 6 minutes. Next time cook the 11 minutes and see if it makes the chicken just a little more tender.

I would also try some bell peppers - do they get bitter in the pressure cooker like they do in a slow cooker?

When I opened the Instant Pot the spice smell seems to much for my taste but when I tasted it after reducing the sauce It was Fantastic.   I made mine with skinless boneless chicken thighs and seasoned them with salt, pepper and onion powder I then sautéed them about 3 minutes.  I removed the chicken breast, and sautéed the vegetables that I added a 1/2 of a green pepper and 1/2 red pepper chopped to medium dice. Deglazed the pot with red wine and added a 1/4 cup of red wine with the tomato and tomato paste, used a natural release and everything was perfect!!!!!!!

Followed the recipe exact and it does NOT look like what the picture for the recipe. I attached a picture. The sauce is watery, even after I added cornstarch. The chicken came out pretty tender but even browning it didn't make it look crispy like in their picture. This recipe is NO GOOD. Wasted all of these ingredients for something that shouldn't have that many five stars.

I had to add red pepper flakes but it was pretty good.  I probably won't saute the chicken next time; it's usually not necessary.

Only my 3rd time using my multi-cooker and I needed to double the recipe so I was a little nervous. Fantastic!!! Everyone loved it.  I added sweet peppers but that was all. Definitely saved this recipe to use again.

Made from frozen so skipped browning and added 5 min to cook time. My mom who is the real cook in the family, really enjoyed it and was surprised by the flavor.

Delicious flavors. Next time I may add some diced bell pepper as well. After cooking, I turned the pot on saute mode. Then I mixed a tablespoon of cornstarch to a little cold water and stirred it into the liquid to thicken the sauce. Worked out great.

Excellent!  We deleted the mushrooms due to allergies, and the tomato paste because we were too lazy to go to the store to get some; cheated with dried onions and garlic and it still came out great, in spite of ourselves!

This was my first instant pot meal. I am NOT an experienced cook, so everything takes me  at least 3x the time estimated. But this was quick and easy, and DELICIOUS! I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and added about a tablespoon of sugar. (A substitute I found online.) I also added a about a teaspoon of salt to the sauce. It all worked great!  My husband and picky daughter both loved this dish, and my husband wants me to make it again this week. The only change I'm going to make is to saute two batches of chicken, and double the recipe! THANK YOU for making my first instant pot meal a huge success! I'll definitely be making this again soon.

This recipe worked out great. I loaded everything into the instant pot, set it and it was done when finished cooking. I did not get a good sear on the chicken skin when sauteing, but will probably just remove the skin in future - the skin wasn't very appetizing in the finished product. I added carrots for additional vegetable content.

Served two very good meals for the two of us.

Excellent recipe! Light and very flavorful. I followed exactly but I didn't have celery and I used thyme because that was all I had. I did let it NP release and the chicken was falling off of the bones! Keeper!!

Very good!!  I served it with linguini pasta. The only thing I added was a splash of white wine.   To thicken the sauce, I added  2 Tbs of corn starch with 2 Tbs of water (mixed).

Worked very well. A couple of options to consider:
- I added half a cup of halved green olives
- I also added a tablespoon of capers
- Topped with chopped parsley, and served with fresh grated Parmesan cheese.

The foundations of this recipe are good but the flavour really needs to be amped up to compare with traditional chicken cacciatore. I seasoned and sautéed all veggies separately to develop colour and flavour (yes, that meant using my cast iron skillet in addition to the instant pot),  and followed the poster’s suggestion to reduce the sauce on the finished product after completion.

Turned out really well. I did use an entire small can of tomato paste- 2 tablespoons didn't seem like enough. I also used chicken breast tenderloins instead of whole thighs.

I made with chicken breast tenderloins and I added two sprigs of fresh rosemary.

I loved the herby taste that the herbs de province and the additional rosemary gave to it.

I followed the recipe as written and was delighted with the results. I agree with those who  have noted the hugely positive contribution made by the herbes de Provence. I had never heard of this spice, much less used it,  but I definitely will look for other applications.  I served this for brunch, and all were as pleased as I. Kudos to the chef.

I make this frequently- I use chicken broth versus bullion cubes and Italian seasoning versus Herbs de Provence. I also, shred the chicken from thighs and mix - dish is a big hit and inexpensive to make!

I only rated it a 4 because it needed salt. My husband liked it though. I had left over sauce. I will re-purpose it for a spaghetti sauce tomorrow.  It was quite lovely smells after a hard day working in the cold. I WILL make this again and add salt and maybe a few other things. The base was great.

Ingredients are easy and the recipe itself is easy. This is delicious and it is now part of our weekly meals. We eat this over jasmine rice and it's so flavor and better than the one that takes hours. Definitely worth a try!

The only changes I made was to use skinless thighs and I had a bottle of Victoria (White Linen) marinara sauce open so used that in place of the tomatoes. It was a huge hit, over homemade egg noodles.  I did reduce the sauce at the end.

Fabulous!!  We used smoked, semi-sundried tomatoes instead of stewed ('cause that's what was on hand) and Could Not eat it fast enough.  Thank you for bringing this recipe into the world.

First IP recipe I made.  It was awesome.  I used six chicken thighs (sautéed two on the stove top and four in the IP) and used McCormick bruschetta seasoning mix instead of the herbes de Provence.  Family and friends loved it.  Will definitely make it again and again.

Made some changes: added diced carrots, used a tbs. of better than bouillon, subbed white wine for 1/2 cup of the water, and used Diced and Fire roasted tomatoes.  The flavor is delicious, but I found it a bit oily. Next time I would trim the fat off the chicken.

It was our very first use of the instant pot, but despite our own neophyte ways, this recipe came out really delicious, and with a wonderful fragrance. If it turned out this well when I didn’t know what I was doing, imagine the next time.

My first ever instant pot recipe and it rocked my world!  I did not make a single alteration.  NO NEED to season the meat before browning.  This recipe was so flavorful and impressive I became an instant fan of the instant pot!

This was probably the best thing I’ve ever made in a pressure cooker! I used boneless, skinless thighs, added double mushrooms and an extra 1/2 can of stewed tomatoes. Otherwise, followed the recipe-excellent! Also, served over cauliflower mash-so healthy.

This was excellent, and even better leftover! Will definitely make this again. My husband loved it. It was better with rice than pasta.

So very good.  Did not pre sear chicken as I used boneless skinless chicken thighs,  put on poultry setting 06 for 17 min as I doubled recipe.  added balsamic vinegar and sugar eyeballing about 2 tbsp of each. used Italian seasoning instead of the herbs de province.  super yummy.  served over egg noodles.  will make again

Very easy to make.  Instead of leaving the chicken thighs whole after cooking, I broke them for the shredded look.

I made this tonight and it was delicious!  I've been in search of a good Chicken Cacciatore recipe and this was the first time I've made a main dish in the in the Instant Pot.  Excellent all around!

Delicious, good depth of flavor. Reduced boullion to 2 cubes. Used 6 4.5 oz thighs and needed to simmer for a bit after depressurizing.

I made a bigger batch with 6 thighs and used boneless skinless chicken thighs because that’s what I had on hand. I should have made more. My family ate all the chicken and I saved the leftover sauce to eat with some chicken I’m cooking tomorrow. I thickened the sauce a bit and served it over pasta. I will definitely make it again!

I wish I had drained the stewed tomatoes prior to adding the chicken, bouillon, water and pressure cooking. I completed the recipe as is and the result was a watery sauce. Others have recommended setting mode onto “sauté” setting and stirring until liquid reduced and sauce thickens. I would recommended this highly. Otherwise the flavour profiles were yummy. I also did what other cooks had found and reduced bouillon to make dish less salty. Overall 4/5 stars from our household.

This recipe was the maiden voyage for my Instant Pot.  Absolutely loved it.  I cannot believe that you can make something in 11 minutes of cooking, that tastes like it was simmering all day.  The flavourings were perfect, authentic Cacciatore tasting.  The entire family loved it.

A keeper for sure but will cut chicken bouillon in half next time because overall a bit to salty for us.  This was the first meal I cooked in the Instant Pot and I love this new pressure cooker!

I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used crushed tomatoes and some fresh cut up, leaving out the tomato paste. I also added red bell pepper with the onions and mushrooms. I would recommend it.

Tasty and easy.  I made a couple of substitutions:
1) Used a couple of peeled fresh tomatoes in place of the can of stewed tomatoes
2) Used ~1/2 cup of salsa instead of tomato paste, red pepper
3) Used white wine (Viognier) instead of water
