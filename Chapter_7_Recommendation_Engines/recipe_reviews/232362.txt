The "one large loaf" pan I believe is referring to a tube pan as that would be the only pan large enough to hold this much batter and have a quick bread shape when sliced.  However, that thought came to me after I had baked them in two loaf pans.  Either way, this is a beautiful poppy seed bread that has a perfect crumb texture.  Definitely the best quick bread recipe I’ve made that does not use instant pudding.

This recipe definitely yields more than "one" large loaf.  Upon final mixing, I was a bit skeptical due to the watery consistency of the batter.  Tin foil loaf pans from the grocery store tend to bake the most beautiful quick breads (at least for me), so I used three 8" x 3.75" pans.  I prepped each one with a light coating of baking spray and filled them one-third full.  To my surprise, they raised like they should, high in the center and golden around the edges.  This recipe delivers a great punch of flavors and perfect texture.  You won't be sorry on this one!

I used two loaf pans as suggested by reviewers. Sorry didn't have any almond extract, but used another favorite of mine. I suggest some orange zest if you like and fresh squeezed O.J. or good quality juice otherwise. I made about half the glaze for pouring and made up a little heavier powdered sugar glaze for a drizzling pattern. Good tasting bread.

I've been making this same recipe for years and it is a really good. My recipe calls for two 8 1/2 X 4 1/2 pans instead of one large pan. The only other thing I might add is that I heat the glaze to dissolve the sugar, then brush the warm glaze on all sides of the loaves with a pastry brush.  The extracts really make this bread so don't leave any of them out.

I followed the recipe exactly and used a black teflon coated bundt pan. The top looked like the picture but the part in the pan turned darker. Now I remember hearing that dark cake pans also make cakes come out darker. I wonder if Ana Frodella also used a dark pan?

This cake has an excellent taste. I too used fresh squeezed orange juice and a little orange zest in the batter and topping. I had one problem though, and I hope someone can help me with this. I greased and floured a bundt pan, but my cake came out too dark, though not overcooked. Can someone tell me what I did wrong. Would that be the result of too much flour or butter, or both. I would love for my cake to come out as pretty as the pictures in these reviews, not just as tasty. Thanks to the person who posted this recipe, and thank you all for any suggestions.

This is a superb bread! It's really more like a coffee cake. I made it for company for breakfast, and they were CRAZY about it! It was gone in an hour. I've got another one in the oven as I write this review. I didn't change the recipe, except to add the zest of one orange. I think it turned out perfectly.

This was fantastic!  I brought this to a ladies brunch and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I followed the suggestion of a few reviewers and added a little orange zest to the batter, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I made it in a Bundt pan and it made a beautiful presentation.

Delicious!  I bet it would be even better if real almonds and orange zest were added. I used a bundt cake pan since there was so much batter.

I've made this several times as written, except I bake it in two 9x5 bread pans.  Everyone loves it.  Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe!
