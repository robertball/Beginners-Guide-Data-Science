This was way too vinegary for us.  I will stick with my mayonnaise-based coleslaw.

I halved the cabbage, had no celery (wish I had some), used much less sugar in the dressing (I don't like sweet dressings). I ended up with a delightful slaw. This recipe calls for too much dressing in my opinion (yes, I am counting the reduced servings).  Cabbage, mixed peppers, carrot, celery, with an oil and vinegar dressing spiced with mustard and dill makes for a lovely salad. You do need salt and pepper in the dressing too in my opinion.  Enjoyed it a lot but I took a star off for too much dressing which is too sweet.

I can't quite put my finger on what is missing for me in this recipe.  It's good, but it's missing a wow factor.  Maybe I need to let the dressing sit more.  Maybe it needs salt and pepper.  It's definitely worth it for those who don't like a mayo-based slaw, but for me it needs more depth to the dressing.  Hubby liked it!  That's a real plus!

Good slaw, but peppers seemed out of place. I think the next time I use this recipe it'll be without the peppers and onions.

I made this by the recipe.  It was pretty good.  The only thing i did differently is to dress it about3 hrs before serving.  We prefer the salad to have time to marinate in the vinegar so it softens the cabbage a bit.  Will probably make again and revise as i go.  Great starting place.

I have made this three times now.  As others did, I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I also ran out of cider vinagar so used half red wine vinagar and half cider.  It made the dressing a nice color and tasted good too.

This recipe was visually beautiful, and the flavor was slightly different than traditional slaw and excellent!  I also like that there is no mayo, making it a healthier recipe.
