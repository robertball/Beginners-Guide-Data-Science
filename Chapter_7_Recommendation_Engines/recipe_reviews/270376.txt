Made to recipe except only used 3 teaspoons of curry powder. As previous comment states 3 Tablespoons would be WAY too much!  Also cooked in air-fryer 400* for 10 minutes flipping them over half way through the cooking time. Great flavor and easy to make.

I was following directions and it didn't hit me it should have been 3 teaspoons curry! Adjust the curry way down and it should be good! I didn't add red pepper flakes.
