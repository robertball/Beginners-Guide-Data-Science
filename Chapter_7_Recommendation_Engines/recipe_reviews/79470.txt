I wouldn't recommend them if you do not have a food processor since making them as here described seems to be a lot of work. But with a food processor just mix dry ingredients and frozen butter (cut in pieces) in processor, process it a few seconds until well blended, add wet ingredients and pulse it until well blended, add raisins or any other fruits or chips you like, just pulse it a couple of times to mix, take the batter out, pat it flat and cut your scones. The batter needs to be well mixed but do not try to get it smooth – scones are supposed to look crumbly. Easy but so delicious! I omitted the raisins and added butter scotch chips instead - they were a hit. But I'm sure I will try a lot of different add-ons in the future. Great recipe!

I mixed these up using my food processor and the results were fantastic... and so easy..
put flour and dry ingredients in first... spin the butter around til it flakes... then add the sour cream, eggs and dried fruit..til it forms a ball... then proceed with the recipe as written.  I tried both apricots and cranberries... and the results were fantastic... So easy... and much easier than grating the butter.. and the handmixing... (I broke my right arm on November 3rd.. so handmixing anything is out for awhile.. makes holiday cooking inconvenient)... These could get to be addictive!!

What a wonderful scone recipe.  These turned out just slightly moist and not dried-out like other recipes I have tried.  The addition of the orange zest and cranberries gave them a delicious, subtle sweet flavor.  Like another reviewer suggested, I made these in the food processor so the dough came together very well, very quickly.  But sticky is an understatement!  Be sure you generously flour your work surface, hands, and knife when shaping and cutting these scones.  This is the best scone recipe I've tried and it's a definite make-again and again!
Update 11/12/07: I have made these scones no less than two dozen times and they are consistently a big hit with everyone, adults and children alike.  I will never consider another recipe for scones, this one is the absolute best.

Great recipe!  I used salted cold butter from the fridge and just cut it into the dough.  My first batch was made with grated cheddar, second batch with fresh strawberries and my third batch with ham, cheese and green onions (sprinkled cheddar on top) all in 3 days!  They went right away and they looked so pretty!  This recipe is great as a base - add whatever you want for the flavour of the day!

Excellent basic scone recipe.  It allowed for substitutions nicely.  I used half white and half whole grain flours to up the nutritional value (1/2 cup oat flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry four plus 2 TBSP ground flax seed.) I divided the dough in half and put chocolate chips in one half (alas, I hate currants and raisins!)and unsweetened finely shredded coconut & chocolate chips in the other half.  Mmm, yummy, and halfway healthy too. Some other suggested "additions" are: craisins and white chips, lemon zest and orange flavored craisins, hazelnuts and toffee chunks, walnuts and chopped dried apricots, coarsely chopped candied ginger and cinnamon, pecans and Kraftmaid caramels cut into fourths... use your imagination and create scones to die for!

I used this recipe as a base for my espresso cafe and they are one of our most popular sellers.

I increased the sugar from 65g to 75g however and I do not use frozen butter and then grate it.

I initially started following this recipe as it was written and found it to be far too time consuming and labor intensive with the frozen butter.  It may work fine for home users but when I have 8 other batches of scones to produce as well as 15 dozen batches of bagel dough that's proofing that need to be pulled and shaped at a specific time, grating the frozen butter seemed to be an unnecessary step.

I melt the butter and they come out perfect every time.

My oven (non-convection, exposed elements at 25' above sea level) I bake these 5 degrees F down (395f) and at exactly 15 minutes on every batch.

I also lightly top them with raw sugar before baking.

The Cherry-Almond variant, I add a few sliced almonds to the mix and on the top for a bit of "bling" and I drop the 155g of sour cream to 105g, otherwise the almond extract makes the dough a bit too soft.

I also make a Maple-Pecan, Bacon-Cheddar, Jalepeno-Cheddar and Sausage-Chive version.

This recipe is a great base for any scone you want to make.  I would encourage anyone wanting to make scones, either at home or in their restaurant/cafe to not forget that scones aren't always just a sweet treat with fruits, nuts and berries, you can make them into a great small meal by adding meats and herbs.

Don't be afraid to experiment!

I made these tonight for my family and they loved them!!!  The alterations I made was to used only ONE and a HALF cups of whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup flax seed ground up and 1/4 cup wheat germ.  This makes it super nutritious and adds a lot of fiber.  My kids said they were the best scones they had ever had!!!

These are the best scones I have ever eaten! I'm a top notch baker but even thought this recipe is easy, it doesn't skip on the flavor. The first time I made these, I did dried crannberry with orange zest. The second time, I did fresh blueberries with walnuts. I liked the cranberry recipe best. Bust my husband and daughter liked the blueberry. I made a frosting for the left overs. It had confectioners sugar, almond extract and orange juice. I dunked the scones in when they were completely cooled. And they were excellent with coffee the next day.

I used salted butter and they were fine. The hardest part was hand grating the butter and the whole mix with your fingers thing I didn't go for.  So this morning I grated the frozen butter with my food processor, switched to the chopping blade, added the flour and just pulsed it a couple of times.  Dumped in the wet ingredients and pulsed just until combined.  MUCH easier, (probably took a total of 1 minute) and texture is the same. These are excellent!  For the raisin version, I suggest adding a generous amount of cinnamon.  The cherry/almond combination is wonderful.
I also did a lemon/blueberry and a lemon/cranberry batch but definitely use fresh grated lemon rind along with  lemon extract.

What a great recipe! I loved the simplicity of the recipe and the tasty results. The texture WASN'T dry and hard as a rock like some recipes; it was tender and relatively moist. I loved it! I followed the cranberry-orange recipe, except I didn't have any oranges that day so I substituted the zest of 1 lemon. YUMMY! I tried it again with orange zest a second time, but I found that I preferred the cranberry-lemon combo. Since then, I've found that cranberry-lemon plus 1 tsp. vanilla is also tasty, as is just lemon (zest) and 1 tsp vanilla.

These are so good, and extremely versatile.  I added dried cranberries and white chocolate chips, and they were fabulous!  Will make these again & again.  12/29/08 addition--these are also fantastic with dried cherries and lime zest & chocolate chips and orange zest.

My mum was from the Isle Of Skye my Father hailed from near Galway coast of Ireland .Scones we know and this recipe is definetly it . Both ways are worth repeating weather using sour cream or yougurt just make sure the yougurt is full bodied.I suggest cranberry and lemon extract & a wee bit of lemon zest about half a lemons worth. Do not use fresh lemon juice it will break down the scone and make it mushy.The combination of cranberry rasins(good handful) and lemon extract is incredible and a good spring delite as opossed to the all familure cran/orange so popular in the autumn.you can make a thin fresh lemon glaze if you desire. Pare with a pot of Irish breakfast , English breakfast,Prince of wales ,Earl grey or Darjelling tea.This will please even the fussy motts.Cares & Prayers to your table

I made these exactly as stated except I substituted fresh blueberries for the raisins, and I was much more generous with the 1tsp of sugar when sprinkling it on top of these before baking. I don't have a food processor large enough for these so I just used my kitchen aid stand mixer. If you mix the dry ingredients then add the butter on low speed it takes a few minutes but it breaks the butter up into small, pea sized pieces. Then when you add your wet ingredients you only need to mix it on low for a few seconds, just until it barely starts to come together. Then I dumped my dough onto parchment paper, placed another piece of parment on top of it to form it together and then cut it. These came out delicious and butter-y. I don't think ill ever use another scone recipe again... but next time ill use 1/2 a cup of sugar in the dough (plus extra for on top) if I use fruit or nuts in these because they weren't quite sweet enough for me. Thanks for sharing!

Very moist, tender scone and ingredients and porportions were pretty much perfect. No need to grate the butter folks. Just cube up the butter, add to the flour and mix with your Kitchenaid using a paddle beater on low. After a few minutes, the butter will become pea-size then add your wet ingredients.  So easy to make in the mixer. I usually use regular salted butter and add 1 teaspoon vanilla. My favorite combo is making Orange Apricot scones.  I add tsp. orange zest to the flour mixture and finely chopped dried apricots. I then make a glaze using orange juice, powdered sugar and orange zest. So moist and keeps well all day.  I would suggest eating it all the same day or else it does get dry on day 2. I always get exactly 8 scones, bake for exactly 15 min.

I really wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars.  Tonight, I baked my first batch of scones and was delighted to find that this simple recipe was perfect and delicious!  The footnotes are a wonderful addition - as I smelled these baking in the oven, I immediately began thinking of how many different ways I could change them up.  The only thing "missing" from this recipe is storage suggestions...and I googled those :)  FYI - all sources are in agreement that scones are best at room temperature, but can be wrapped in plastic once cool and stored in the refrigerator for one day or frozen for up to 3 months (then allowed to thaw in its packaging and warmed in a 350 degree oven for 5 minutes before serving).  Anyway, thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I will definitely add this one to my personal collection.

These are the best and I make them all the time, always by hand and it is very easy. Once the butter is grated in, you just need to toss it around gently in the flour and that is all the blending it needs. I usually use yogurt instead of sour cream, but sometimes, if I don't have either, I add lemon juice to milk to make a sour milk and it turns out really well. I usually put an egg in a measuring cup and fill the rest with sour cream or yogurt and a splash of vanilla. The dough ends up softer, but I don't handle it too much and it always turns out. I often sprinkle the top with cinnamon and sugar just before baking and it turns out lovely and crunchy. I have used dried cranberries or chopped apple instead of raisins on occasion. After never having much luck with scones, it's great to have a recipe that my family and friends love!

Excellent recipe!  I needed a savory scone to go with chili for dinner, so I cut the sugar in half and added 1/2 t. garlic powder, 1/2 t. basil, 1/2 t. oregano, and 4 oz. colby cheese, shredded (abt. 1 c.) - added all this after working in the butter.  I also don't freeze & grate the butter - I just work it in with my hands until I get a coarse meal texture.  I will definitely use this recipe for sweet or savory scones!

I found these to be tasty but more of a cakey cookie than a scone. I prefer my scones more like biscuits, less cakey.

Amazing Recipe!  I make these for every event - always a hit!  The trick is - Melt the butter and add the wet ingredients and then the dry.  Keep it simple!  The recipe says to grate the butter - I found no difference off using melted butter.  I can make these in less than 5 minutes - they are addictive!

A wonderful treat! I used one container of greek yogurt (5 oz) instead of the sour cream. This added 15 gr. protein and a fraction of the calories and fat! They where perfect!

I love this recipe, and I have yet to try it with the currants or raisins ! My tip would be what my mother passed on to me--whenever you're making scones, the key is to handle it as little as possible. The perfection of a scone is in the lovely brown lumpiness, not in treating it like piece of pie.

"grate recipe" ;) actually, grating the frozen butter worked well, faster than cutting in. i just held a frozen stick of regular (salted) butter in its waxed paper wrapper. certainly would be easiest in a food processor though. these scones are delish! i've made with craisins and orange zest, also dried blueberries and almond extract, and will probably try more flavors as it is a perfect dough recipe in my opinion. always have the ingredients on hand. got great reviews from my co-workers, too! oh and i brush tops with milk and sprinkle w/ raw or turbinado sugar. enjoy!

My first time making scones and all I can say is wow!  I didn't use the food-processor method because mine is too small but honestly it's not hard at all to make by hand.    I followed the advice fron someone and added 3/4 Craisins (dried cranberries) and 2 TBSP Orange Rind.  I also sprinkled the tsp sugar on top like the recipe recommends.    I also made a glaze using 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 1/2 to 2 TBSPs orange juice and about 1 tsp almond extract.  Really good!!!!!  Will be using this recipe over and over again to make my own variations.

This was a very good scone.  I made these plain (without the raisins) and I also made some replacing the raisins with 1/2 cup frozen blueberries and another batch with 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.  I took these to a multicultural night for the England table and they were a big hit!  I used a food processor to mix the butter with the dry ingredients and then added that mixture to the egg/sour cream mixture in another bowl, folding with a rubber spatula.  At this point it still had a lot of dry crumbly pieces.  I then put the mixture onto some plastic wrap and folded the mixture about three times until it all came together.  The plastic wrap is great because it helps keep everything from sticking onto your hands!  If you prefer not to use plastic wrap, even if the dough still seems a bit dry/crumbly, it bakes up very nice in the oven.  Your scones won't look as "nice" but they are still very tasty!!!  Even though the recipe says 8 servings, these puff up quite a bit in the oven.  I actually made two circles and cut those into 8 servings each making 16 servings and each piece was very large after baking.

This was the very first time I've attempted to make scones but the results were amazing.  Where has this recipe been all my life?  I didn't have sour cream on hand but I did have a thick greek style yogurt which is similar in texture.  My children liked them so much much that they had seconds and asked if I had bought them at the bakery.  This recipe is a keeper.  Next time I want to try using chopped dried apples.  My son said with wide eyes, "That should taste like apple pie." Apple pie for breakfast sounds like heaven indeed.  Try this recipe, you won't regret it.

You don't need a food processor! It is so easy to grate frozen butter and does not take long at all. I think it would take longer to clean all the pieces of a food processor, than it would to grate the butter with a box grater and use a couple of bowls. Follow the recipe!

These scones are wonderful! Flaky and yummy and the recipe is so versatile. I have made them with raisins, dried blueberries w/lemon, and dried cherries w/ almond extract. All are sooo good!

In fact I think I will use the technique of grating butter for pie pastry, too.

You don't have to use frozen butter.  I used straight from fridge and cut into small cubes and added with all dry ingredients in mixer until crumbly. Then added wet ingredients, mixed well, then added a handful of dried cranberries, mixed well. This time did not top with sugar.   Have made in food processor and standup mixer.  I prefer the standup mixer because food processor dices the dried craisins too much.  UPDATE*****4/29/12***Made yesterday and today, using KitchenAid standup mixer and prefer standup mixer.   Came out perfect.  
You must try this recipe. Also, I add  1 TBSP. orange extract.  I like my scones to be extra fragrant. Give this recipe a try.

I changed this a bit but I'm sure the original deserves 5 stars too!  I used 1 C whole wheat flour, 1/2 C white, 1/4 C ground flax, 1/4 C wheat bran, only 1/4 C sugar, and 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cardamom and 1/2 tsp ginger.  To the wet ingredients I add 2 tsp vanilla or almond extract and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I've even used soy yogurt and they were still fantastic. After grating the cold butter into the flour I toss it around with my fingers then use a pastry cutter to cut it in.  I've made these without any fruit or nuts then made some with apricots then tried dried cherries and almond extract and also cut up fresh cranberries with almond extract. Even the variety with the raisins are delicious! Perfect everytime!!

I did some experimenting today. My outcomes show that this continues to be a great recipe! I made the lemon-blueberrie variation and the cherry almond variation this morning following the recipe exactly.  I also then made the simple raisin recipe only substituting non-fat plain yogurt for the sour cream and adding 1 tsp. orange zest.  All three batches of scones met high reviews by all the different personalities who were at my house and sampled all three, but I have to say that actually the batch made with the non-fat yogurt was actually lighter (most likely because of less fat content) but it still remained very moist and flavorful.  I will probably make all my scones with non-fat yogurt from now on.  I will see how the left-overs fare and will let you all know...later note: Yes! The left overs were still quite light and moist and fluffy!! Yum!

Very delicious Recipe.  My husband loved them!  I was always afraid to try a scone recipe but this was so easy.  Followed recipe exactly and flavored them with 2 t. orange zest and 1-2 t. orange juice.  Brushed the tops with egg wash and sprinkled with sugar. Will try this recipe with other flavors.  I bet the sky is the limit with what youcan flavor with. Using the food processor is a good idea BUT only if your processor can accomodate the amount of indgredients.  Parchement paper is recommended!!

I tried to make these and they totally burned on the bottom of the pan. I added more flour and lowered my oven temp a bit because I live at high altitude but they still really burnt and didn't seem to be getting golden on top. Also they didn't smell especially good in the first place...I'm wondering if its because of the sour cream. I have read several other recipes for easy scones and they all call for buttermilk or just plain milk or half and half.

I loved this recipe.  I make scones all of the time and take them to work.  The idea of grating the butter is great (no pun intended) and I will use that for other recipes.  I used buttermilk and 1/2 tsp cinnamon with the cinnamon chip scones.  Then I had to make a second batch with chopped "candy melts" in orange and green for the grandkids.  They loved em!  I sprinkled orange or green sugar on top before baking.  Just a note here - if you use the candy melts - for color and flavor - don't use the food processor to break them up - it does too good of a job.  Just chop them coarsely with a chef knife.  This is my new "go to" recipe for scones!!!

I've been searching for the perfect scone recipe and I've found it!!  I basically followed the recipe to a T, but didn't freeze the butter (the stick out of the fridge was very cold and VERY easy to grate- I recommend grating it b/c it made it so much easier to cut in to the dry ingredients) I also used Craisins and light sour cream.  The dough wasn't too sticky and was very easy to handle.  They taste slightly sweet and are light and crumbly.  YUM!

This recipe is very good.  Make it a little easier by using a pastry blender to mix cold butter into flour rather than grating it.  A good basic scone recipe which can be adapted with different flavorings.

Terrific scone recipe!  I have been intimidated by scones in the past (mine were always too dry) - but this is a great, simple recipe!

Grating the butter is key - odd - but important to get the butter evenly mixed into the scones.  Actually, i kindof forgot my butter for about 30 minutes until I worked it into the flour and it worked fine (albeit a little messy.)

I used cherry craisins and added 3 big shakes of dried orange peel.  The sour cream/egg mixture poured over the flour nicely and mixed up quite easily with the back of a spoon.  I barely had to use my hands at all.

I then split the mixture into two balls and flattened one to about 7" diameter (3/4" thickness)on parchment paper on a stone, patted granular sugar on top,  and sliced into 8 pieces.  Seperated them and then actually needed to cook them 15 minutes.  They were perfect and I love the smaller scone size!

Yum!  I added orange flavoring to the the sour cream and used cranberries.  Delicious.  Next time I will buy an orange and grate the rind in the dry mix.

I have used this recipe many times.  I volunteer at a Cafe where we make all of our food from scratch.  We raise money to feed children in our county.  Anyway, when I make these scones (I do cranberry/orange) they are gone in seconds as soon as they come out of the oven.  I don't frost them.  They are easy to make and delicious, too. And...... children are getting fed.  Love it!

Great recipe, but instead of sour cream try flavored yogurt.  Blueberry with blueberries, raspberry with raspberries, etc.  The container size is perfect and it comes out tasty and delicious.  I have tried Yopliat, Dannon and they all work

Simple can often be the best. These are beyond simple when you use a food processor, pulsing ONLY until butter is incorporated...I just cut frozen butter rather than grating. Then I added dried blueberries and the egg and sour cream (fat free) and pulsed a few more times and the dough comes together in seconds. I also added some orange zest...my husband ate three already. Definitely deserving of five stars...try these!

This is my staple scone recipe now.  I sometimes substitute low fat buttermilk for the sour cream. Our favorite verson is to substitute cinnamon chips for the raisins and add 1/2 cup toasted chopped pecans. Great with a bowl of fruit. Yum!

These are my 'go to' scones.  I have tried a ton of scone recipes and these are great.  I always change it up and add blueberries, a cinnamon crumb topping, mini choc. chips, whatever the mood.  I like to leave the dough as a circle and cut the scones, just pulling them apart slightly, they cook more evenly.  I also found good results when I wanted fresh scones in the morning without getting up much earlier, I made them the night before and baked them in the am.  They actually cooked a little more evenly.  I make this recipe almost every weekend.  It's great!!

I'm not very good at baking but LOVE eating fresh! This recipe is perfect for me (newbie).  It's easy to follow and very forgiving!  I used box grater for butter (salted). I skipped baking soda (ran out) and the scones still came out perfect!  I double serving size (for holidays party) so I didn't really measure everything 100% exactly as written in the recipe.  I was surprise that my scones came out moist, perfectly sweeten and very very good!  They were a hit at the party as well.

For Christmas party, I added pieces of dried cranberries and sprinkled with sugar powder and name it Snowberry Scone.

"The best scones I've ever had" according to my husband and I'd agree. My toddler loved them too. I didn't have sour cream so I substituted plain lowfat yogurt. I also forgot to add the sprinkled sugar at the end but it wasn't necessary. This one is going in my favorites!

This is a wonderful recipe, though I did make minor changes. Rather than grate the butter in, I simply cubed it and then used a pastry cutter to mix it in until the mixture resembled coarse meal. I made sure my hands were floured well and kneaded the dough a little bit so there was a more even distribution of moisture, rather than clumps of dry/sticky dough. I used milk chocolate chips instead. Cooked for exactly 17 minutes and they are absolutely delicious, very light and fluffy, with a buttery taste kind of reminiscent of shortbread.

I loved absolutely loved these. I read other reviews (using a food processor) but don't have one. Only change I may was using fridge temp butter. I grated the butter and hand worked the flour and all the dry ingredients, then simply used a fork. I didn't have sour cream on hand so used heavy whipping cream. The texture came out PERFECT (just like Starbucks). The oven temp and time (17min) right on. I also added a simple drizzle (3/4 cup confectioners and 1 Tblsp of hot water). PERFECT I will so make these again THANK YOU!!

This is the best scone recipes!  I have tried many different recipes.  Very moist & flaky.  I made the lemon-blueberry & the almond-cherry & plain. I also made lemon curd to top them.  (I used the perfect lemon curd recipe on Allrecipes.)  Also very good with rasberry jam & lemon curd on top.

These are wonderfully easy from start to finish.
I used fat free sour cream and fresh blueberries (i actually froze them first so the dough wouldn't turn blue), and they were perfect.  I'm going to try garlic parmesan next, and then chocolate cherry!
[edit] Every variation i have tried has been wonderful.  When i made the garlic parm ones, i used half whole wheat flour and it was a great savory scone!  I also made the blueberry ones with splenda instead of sugar.  The dough was harder to work with, but they were still delicious, and my family had no idea they were sugar-free!

I didn't freeze the butter because I didnt have time for that. I just used spoonfuls of country crock, which is real soft already and easily mixed into the flour mixture. I also used half sugar, half cinnamon/sugar mix and craisins. But before molding them to bake, i put the mixture in the fridge for about 5 min to firm up a bit so it wasnt so sticky to work with.  They turned out excellent, perfect with coffee! This is a great recipe!

I made the cherry almond variation and they were delicious!  No leftovers!  I used fat free sour cream and cholesterol free egg product and they still had a great texture and wonderful flavor.

I've used tons of recipes for scones over the years since scones are one of my favorite things.  I was actually looking for one similar to a recipe I lost but came across these.... These happen to be my new favorite recipe.  It's the sour cream that makes it I think.  I decided on a cranberry almond variaton when I made them.  Add 1tsp almond extract, and crasins instead of raisins.  Soooooooo good.

Great basic recipe that accepts variations/additions nicely. Here's what I like to do with this wonderful recipe to make it my own...I dice the 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter before I get started and put it in the freezer to chill, I use brown sugar instead of white, use vanilla greek yogurt instead of sour cream, put a little jam on top before baking and after baking drizzle on a powdered sugar glaze. I use my food processor...pulse dry ingredients, add chilled butter and long pulse a few times, stir the egg and yogurt together in a bowl and add to food processor bowl, long pulses just until the dough starts to come together. Pour onto counter dusted with flour and pat together to form a ball and continue to press into a circle, 3/4" high. Cut like a pie into 8 wedges and transfer to a cookie sheet lined with parchment. Using floured fingers, I press a circular indentation into each wedge and fill with approx. 1/2 tsp of jam (any fruit jam will work with this recipe!). After cooling a bit on a wire rack, I drizzle some powdered sugar glaze on top (approx.1 cup powdered sugar, approx 1 Tbsp of softened butter, 1/4 tsp vanilla and a bit of whole milk, stirred together, add tiny amounts of milk until you get that drizzle-icious consistency). Pour the glaze into a ziplock baggie and snip a tiny bit of a corner off, then let the drizzle flow out of the corner as you move back and forth across each scone.

These are the bees knees!  I make them often and always make 2 batches  (one at a time though).  Only use the food processor---no bowls needed! I typically add some sort of flavoring such as vanilla or lemon also. Just put in ingredients---pulse---add whatever fruits or such and pulse a few more times and DUMP it all on baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Pat lightly into circle and cut into 8ths----pull apart---do not let them touch and bake for about 15 min.  You will love them!

YOU MUST MAKE THESE - they are simply the best scones you will ever find on this side of the pond!  My favorite are the cherry-almond ones (lemon-blueberry are a close second).

I make these for two cafes.  WONDERFUL!  I make several different varieties by adding cinnamon chips, chocolate chips, peanut butter, orange extract/craisins, granola, white chocolate chips/almonds, cheddar/dill/garlic.  I do increase the sugar for the sweeter versions.  Grate the butter before you freeze it - duh.  Don't overbake.  Brush with melted butter when you take them out of the oven.  I serve with soup also.  Yum.

These are terrific. I make them plain or add a little almond extract and dried cherries. I had been buying a mix from Williams Sonoma because I couldn't find a good recipe--these are a staple now!

Oh. My. Goodness. I don't review very often, but this recipe is so incredible, I had to run to the computer to review!  When I actually tasted the scones, I genuinely giggled - they are THAT good!  I did tweak the directions, however, as I am much too lazy to do all that work.  I cut the butter into chunks, stuck it in the freezer for a while, then tossed them into my food processor (using the metal blade, I still haven't figured out what the plastic one is for).  I pulsed the butter until it looked pretty crumbly, then added all the dry stuff at once (including the zest of one orange), pulsed a while longer until it looked crumbly and well-mixed.  I then dumped in the wet stuff (I did also add a tiny splash of vanilla), pulsed it all until it came to a ball on the side of the machine, then  dumped it onto a floured cutting board.   I kneaded in some chopped almonds and dried cranberries, cut it into pieces, baked, and voila!  The most incredible scones I've ever tasted.  EVER.  

(I also drizzled a confectioner's sugar/water mix over them once cooled, but it's not necessary)

Thanks a million, Pam, for such an incredible recipe!

Outstanding!  I added a dash of cinnamon & nutmeg, leaving out the raisins.  Very tasty with a nice texture.  Not too sweet either.  Easy to make.

This recipe is super easy to prepare.  I've made it up several times and they came out great every time.  I omit the raisins and serve them with jam.  I will keep this one in my favorite recipes folder!

Fantastic base recipe.  I replaced the sour cream with low fat Greek yogurt (less fat, more protein) and used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular flour. I cut my dough into two balls initially, then flattened and divided each ball into 8 wedges, so I ended up with 16 medium scones instead of 8 huge ones.

Yum! I can't eat gluten and I was able to use this recipe with Better Batter All Purpose Gluten Free Flour. I used the gluten free flour cup for cup. I did add 1/4 cup milk for a bit more moisture, and a tsp of vanilla, Goodness! They looked and tasted just like regular ol' scones. My gluten eating husband enjoyed them just as much as I did. Thanks for the great basic recipe!

This was great. I used it without fruit as a topping on a cobbler. The crowd loved it, in fact I was asked to make it 3 times in a week. Just cook about 6 cups of fruit with about 1/2c of sugar and 2tbsp of tapioca in a pie pan for 20 minutes at 400 and then add these on top for another 15-20. Wonderful and easy.

I followed the recipe as in, except I substituted chocolate chips for raisins. 

I had to bake the scones for at least 10 more minutes than the recipe called for and they're still almost wet in the middle. 

The scones are pretty bland, as is. They really could have used some vanilla extract. Maybe even a little more sugar, but I prefer things to be on the more sweet side.

These are the absolute best scones! (And I've tried many!) I've made these for several showers and everyone always says they're the best scones they've had. I make them several days in advance and underbake them a little then freeze them once they're cool. Right before serving, I take them from the freezer, pop them in the oven for about 10 minutes, and they're perfect! LOVE THEM!!

I was impressed by this recipe. My first attempt at scones and they turned out great. I soaked the raisins in amaretto prior to adding them to the mix. I would like to try gran marnier next time. The variations are endless and this is another great addition to my recipe box.

Very simple to make...  so many options or flavors can use this simple recipe...

I've made cranberry orange (add a bit of orange zest and 2/3 C cranberries to dry mixture, glaze with Orange Juice, Zest, and powdered sugar glaze)...  I've made Lemon Poppyseed version..  similar to above, but with poppyseeds and lemon zest added to dry ingredients (+butter), and top with lemon juice, Powdered sugar, lemon zest and ALMOND extract...  YUM...  
So moist and perfectly tasty...  EASY EASY EASY.
Family comes to spend the night they know they'll get scones.

When my husband asked what I was making his response was a disappointed "oh biscuits" however after eating two he agreed they were light, fluffy and not a biscuit.  

Easy to make, I let mine rest in the refrig while cleaning up.  This let the dough rest and butter firm back up before baking.

I woke up one morning with a burning desire to make scones (for the first time ever, might I add), and this recipe made it easy.  They were just delicious.  I substituted fat free vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and that worked great.  They were delicious, and my family begged me to make them again.

Have been using this recipe for a little while and love it.  Got the exact same recipe from my friend Laura, and we agree it's the amount of butter and the texture the frozen butter gives the dough that makes this one of the best scone recipes around.  I have baked it a number of times, always adding something a little different and it always comes out great.  Cranberries, white chocolate chips and walnuts is a great combo, as is dried cherries, mini chocolate chips and Mexican vanilla.  I have even omitted the sugar, added minced garlic, a fresh squeeze of lemon juice and shredded parmesan cheese for a great savory scone.  Definitely worth trying!

I have made these a couple of times and they are really simple and yummy! A little sweeter and much more moist than any I have ever had while eating out. And, not being a fan of raisins, I added frozen blueberries from this years harvest and they were terrific!

I made a double batch of these, omitted the raisins and added almond extract.  Then I served them warm with apricot butter.  They were to die for!  The consistency was just "melt in your mouth" right and they looked like we'd bought them at a bakery.

I've made these scones a dozen times now. They are soooo incredibly delicious. Don't let the dough get warm from hand mixing or it's quite possible your scones won't rise to the occasion!! Don't forget a generous spoonful of clotted cream & jam to go with it. You won't regret it unless your scone becomes a vehicle for the entire jar of clotted cream!!!!!!

very easy recipe, very delicious, taste just like the ones I have tried at a local tearoom, very light, buttery, rich taste.  I served them with cream and blueberry and strawberry jam.  Delish!! I did not have unsalted butter, but just used salted butter and left out the salt, very easy! I did not use the raisins either, tasted good just plain with the fruit jam

This recipe is excellent.  I prepared the scones with dried cranberries, but had no oranges on hand so I left the zest out.  I used fat free sour cream and followed the advice of other reviewers and mixed it in the blender.  A quick way to a delicious breakfast!!

I've made the cranberry orange variation several times and they're better than the bakery!  Nice and moist and they freeze beautifully! I've made 16 smaller ones with this recipe and they were perfect too.

I made these for an English tea that I put on for a family member that was getting married (kind of like a bridal shower with an English theme).  It was the first time I had made these and they were a huge hit!  At least 6 people asked me for the recipe.  Not too sweet, not dry, and they melt in your mouth.  Delicious!

I made one change for future recipes.  The recipe says to cut the dough into 8 triangles, which makes awfully big scones.  I cut them in half again to make 16 scones and reduced the baking time to 14 minutes, checking on them during the last two minutes to make sure they didn't get too brown.  This makes a nicer size that will feed more people.

Delicious and easier than I thought.  I've made it several times.  Try adding dried cranberries and a little orange zest.  They some out tasting very much like cranberry/orange scones from an overpriced coffee shop.  Thanks for sharing.

Simply Delicious! I added craisins instead of raisins and they turned out great. everyone at my house thought they tasted as good or better than the scones that we love at the local bakery! I also added lemon cream cheese frosting to the top when the scones were done, and it was the perfect touch!

I love this recipe, it's so easy, and the scones are delicious.  I use fat free greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and add craisins, chopped almonds and orange zest.  I serve them with a bit of greek yogurt mixed with sugar or sweetener, and orange juice - this makes a lovely creamy topping!  Can't be beat.  I'm serving this for company tomorrow morning.

This is a very good, simple recipe.  I followed recipe and baking instructions except I used dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.  I put dry ingredients in food processor pulsed added slices of frozen butter and pulsed until mixture was in small chunks. It is IMPORTANT not to over mix! Then I dumped mixture out onto a large sheet of plastic wrap.  I used the wrap to form dough into a round circle about 3/4" thick and cut into 8 wedges.  I placed the wedges on a silpat on baking sheet and sprinkled with the sugar. No flour mess to clean up. I am looking forward to making these many more times!

Not a fan of scones, but these were delish!!  I omitted raisins and added a generous 1/3 c of craisins and 1/3 c white choc. chips.  Also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  Used fat free sour cream.  Didn't freeze butter.  Baked on baking stone for 20 minutes or so. . .  Perfect!!

This is a great basic recipe! I used whole wheat pastry flour, half the butter, and 4 T applesauce. It was pretty sticky, so I dolloped them onto the parchment paper like biscuits. :-) Also tried the variation of lemon and blueberry. one container of fresh blueberries, 1.5 t. dried lemon peel, 1/2 t. lemon extract. Great flavor and wonderful consistency.

Super yummy. I used cold butter and blended everything with a pastry cutter and then added the sour cream mixture. I also used dried cherries and added 2 tsp of vanilla.

Sooo Easy. I did not grate the butter, I chopped it with a knife until it clumped like large peas. I then split the batch in half. I made one half dried dates with orange zest and the other blueberries with lemon zest. Put extra sugar on top - that really makes it. Delicious!!!

awesome. I make a customised version of this by adding frozen mixed berries and chunks of white chocolate. You need to work quickly with the berries so that they don't thaw out and water down the dough. I usually eyeball the amounts but tend to use an entire large white chocolate bar and about a cup or so of frozen berries. It all depends on your tastes. 

Don't be too scared if the dough seems a bit more sticky than usual. I sometimes need to add just a touch more flour to make up for the liquid in the berries but they always come out fine from the oven.

I did not have sour cream so I added an equal amount of plain yogurt and an extra 1/2 tsp of baking soda to adjust. I had homemade candied orange peel that I chopped and added instead of the raisins. I followed CalJane's lead and used the food processor, super easy! The house smelled like heaven. I loved these scones! they were very simple, flakey and delicious. I will be making this again and again.-Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The best scones ever! I didn't have any sour cream but I was craving carb so badly I decided to give this recipe a try. I am really glad I did because it turned out soooo good! I added some peppermint in the spirit of Christmas, and it turned out fabulous! This recipe is a keeper!

I love this recipe! It is so easy! Like another reviewer I also just melt the butter instead of trying to cut it into the flour. My kids love them when I divide the dough in half and flatten it putting a layer of brown sugar and cinnamon between the layers and then seal them. Wonderful!

So far I've made Orange Cream Scones, Key Lime Scones, and Vanilla Bean Scones using this recipe! These scones always turn out perfect! I love love this recipe. I have never used sour cream but instead yogurt. I've used orange, key lime, and greek vanilla yogurt to make my scones. Such a great starter recipe to branch off from and create any type of scone to your liking. I love making a glaze for them as well. Powdered sugar (1 cup) and key lime juice along with zest was delicious on top of my key lime scones!

This recipe is incredible. I have used it without fruit for traditional English scones and with the fruit. Either way they taste incredible! For something different dust with powdered sugar. For English scones add Smuckers strawberry topping in the center & a side of whipped cream.

I cheated on butter. I really thought I had frozen butter but was wrong so I had to use 3/4 cup margarine and 1/4 cup butter. Next time around, I will use real butter and will probably try to replicate Starbuck's Pumpkin Scone.

This recipe was an OK recipe. Though i found them a little bit to dry, so I added a bit more sour cream . Much better. If you like moist scones, then I suggest that you would do the same. I added craisins to mine and it really perked them up.

The best homemade scones I've ever had!  Sour cream may sound weird, but makes them soft and moist and taste absolutely delicious. 

I recommend brushing tops of scones with an egg wash to get the tops golden and crispy, and topping with sugar in the raw instead of granulated white sugar.  I also used fat-free sour cream, which was totally fine. 

I also modified this recipe to make my "savory" scones.  I used 1/6 cup sugar instead of 1/3 cup, and instead of any fruit, I added 1/4 cup of cooked and chopped bacon, 1/6 cup diced chives, and 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  Those scones were super yummy too!!

THIS RECIPE is a KEEPER! I just made these scones and they are wonderful. Hubby loved them and they would be an impressive scone for company too.
I used the recipe for the cranberry/orange except used lemon zest (I didn't have an orange) and added 1 tsp vanilla as suggested by another reviewer. I also mixed them in my food processor. This made it sooooo easy! FYI - pulsed together dry ingred. then I cut the frozen butter into small chunks and pulsed, then added the sourcream/egg mixture, flavorings, and  lastly fruit. It only took a few minutes and it was nicely mixed.

These scones were simply delicious and very simple to make. Because I didn't have sour cream, I used butter milk instead. Added one cup of raisins, lemon zest, and added one tsp. of vanilla extract. I used cold butter, which I cut into chunks. The food processor made this recipe almost effortless to prepare. The whole family loved them; will surely make these again.

Unbelievable. These are DIVINE! I double the batch and make 1/2 cranberry with orange zest, and the other half I do with chocolate chips(semi-sweet) and cinnamon. I wouldn't change a THING about this recipe....except maybe take out the calories and fat! YUMMY!!!!

This recipe is so easy to prepare and tastes delicious.  The scones were the absolute rave at a babyshower/teaparty we had for our cousin.  Cannot recommend them highly enough.  Why buy scones when these are so great!!!

I saw this in the USA Weekend magazine and had to try it.  I made the Cherry/Almond version and the scones were wonderful.  I added a touch more almond extract than the recipe called for to suit our tastes.  It takes minimum time and the product is light and flakey.  I'm looking forward to trying all of the variations.  Great recipe!

No need to use food processor.  Just use your hands to mix the ingredients.  I didn't have any sour cream and so substitute it with yogurt and they tasted perfect.  Also put chocolate chips instead of raisins.

Every Saturday morning I get a a cranberry scone from a local baker...it is $2.50.  I just make this recipe with cranberry and orange and needless to say I will be saving $2.50 a week.  This scone base is so EASY!  Best of all I like the fact that I can change up the additions and have a variety.  I am going to try apricot and ginger next week and maybe something savory the following.

I used a food processor and it couldn't have been easier.  My one tweek is that I added a scant tbls of heavy cream as the dough seemed a bit dry.  I also added the cranberry and orange zest to the dry mixture and processed so it was slightly chopped and there is cranberry in every bite.  Theses litte changes worked beautifully and the scones came out perfect.  I will now have a yummy homemade scone on Saturday's and be richer for it!

These were so delightful! There's no need to freeze and grate the butter. I just took butter straight from the fridge, cut it into table-spoon sized pieces, and used a pastry cutter to combine it with the dry ingredients.

Very tasty and quite easy.  I did not have sour cream so I used greek yogurt instead.  I also omitted the raisins and added craisins and crushed walnuts instead.

Perfection! I altered by adding cinnamon, replacing half of the sugar with brown sugar and also added finely chopped pecans teeny bits of toffee.  Drizzled with Vanilla icing made from confectioners sugar. Light and fluffy.

Melt-in-your-mouth kind of scone! I've made many biscuits but it was my first time making "scones", and I have to say, it wasn't as messy as others have described it. (I followed the recipe exactly, except I used half wholewheat flour and cut the sugar to 1/4 instead of 1/3.) Comparing to the biscuits I make, the dough wasn't sticky (or messy) at all!!! (I've done a lot worse/messy work.) Instead of using food processor like others mentioned, I cut cold butter into cubes and started mixing with the dry ingredients using pastry blender (just the way I do when making savoury biscuits). As mentioned in the instruction, I thought the dough was waaay too dry at first, but as I was working with my hand(kind of "kneading" in a way I guess?), everything came together and although I was a bit worried that the scones would turn out dry, they didn't turn out dry at all! Moist and flakey, the way my family like them! I put vanilla extract and half dried raspberries and half dried blueberries. I wish I had orange or lemon, but I didn't.. I will make them again with chocolate chips, dried cranberries and orange zest, raisins, dried cherries, etc!

I made this three times, without the processor, just plain old mixing of dry and then wet....I even doubled up one batch and it is truly a beautiful tasting scone. Mildly sweet, great texture and a great scone plain or dressed up. Thank you. This will be my one and only. BTW, I used fresh cheese and plain yogourt instead of sour cream all times and it is magnificent.

YOU DON'T NEED A FOOD PROCESSOR! I made these by hand, using cold butter (not frozen), I cut it into little cubes before putting it in the mix. Also, I didn't have sour cream or buttermilk so I added a 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice to 1/2 cup of milk and let it sit for 15mins then mixed (this is homemade buttermilk).

These came out great! I've never made scones before but this was a very easy versatile recipe. Instead of raisins I made half  almond chocolate chip and half butterscotch chips. So good.

Excellent! This is very easy in the food processor as other reviewers mentioned. First mix the wet ingredients with the butter, then pulse in the dry ingredients, followed by the raisins, currants, or whatever else you choose.

SO simple! I can't believe how easy these were! And the whole family LOVED them. I asked how many stars they thought the recipe should receive out of five, and they said 6! lol I followed the recipe to the letter, except I cut the butter into tiny squares. I'm definitely making these weekly!

wonderful! Just do half whole wheat flour, half white flour to make it a little healthier. Also, do one egg white and 1 or 2 teaspoons of orange juice instead of just one egg to make it healthier and to also add an extra kick of orange flavor!

Really great recipe! Tried it with blueberries and lemon zest last night and going to do it with cranberries and orange zest tonight! :)
The only thing that you have to keep in mind is that the dough is REALLY sticky, so the counter and knife should have plenty flour on it. Used a pizza spatula to pick them up cause mine stuck to the counter anyway and it worked great.
Last night I only had 1/4 cup of sour cream and a bunch of french vanilla whole milk yogurt. So I used half sour cream and half yogurt. Worked out great if anyone doesn't have sour cream! :)

This is the best scone recipe I have ever tried. They are simple to make and delicious enough to make you want to devour the entire batch in a sitting! These scones have the most incredible flavor, perfect consistency/texture, and look cafe bought professional. My husband even told his friend that we had bought them from a bakery, and he believed it easily! The only thing I changed from the original recipe was using blueberry flavored cranberries (Craisins) instead of raisins because I do not like raisins. I also added slightly more than the 1/2 cup that the recipe calls for to be sure that there was plenty of the sweet berry in each scone. You must try this recipe!!! It will not disappoint

This is an excellent base recipe.  The texture of the scones is wonderful... Light and flakey.  They are sweet, but not overly sweet.  I don't have a box grater, so I cut the butter into the flour with a pastry blender.  It worked fine.  The possibilities with this recipe are endless.  I will definately make these again.  I recieved lots of positive comments on the blueberry vanilla scones I made.   While the recipe only makes 8 scones,  those things are huge!

First time I've ever made scones.  Took them to a brunch and they were a huge hit!  I made the cranberry/orange zest version.  I am a very new to cooking and baking and this recipe was SUPER easy!  I grated the frozen butter by hand (box grater) and worked the dough by hand.  Don't let the reviews recommending food processors scare you!  If I can do it ANYONE can!

This was a bit dry, but close to what I was looking for. I omitted everything except the sugar sprinkled on top (used decorative sugar for texture). That fact alone gets it a 5. Swapped out some of the plain white flour for wheat as well. Served with homemade jams/jellies and faux clotted cream and tea.

I use this recipe as the base recipe for all my scones. I just modify to try new flavor combos. I tried on today that was amazing. I used brown sugar instead of white. I omitted the raisins, added 1/2 cup of oatmeal to the dry ingredients, and 1/2 of maple syrup to the wet ingredients. They turned out amazing! I use a food processor when making these, so the oatmeal was not large or noticeable. Just an amazing flavor. Maple oat scones is what I call them!

The absolute best!  I made the almond cherry and doubled the almond extract.  Everyone loved them and devoured them despite their "low carb" diets!  I served these with the easy Devonshire cream, bumping up the sugar in that to 2 TBSP.  The best!

First off let me say WOOOOWWW!!!  These are the best scones I have ever had.  They were very simple to make and extremely flavorful.  No need for a food processor unless your ridiculously lazy.  The step by step instructions are well written and east to follow, plus using your fingers to work the butter into dough allows you to be intimate with your food, and spread the love to those you prepare the scones for.  The only different things I did was and a tad bit more sugar and a lil bit of cinnamon.  Thanks for this recipe, it's world class!

This recipe is fantastic! I used a food processor like most of the reviews said. I also added trail mix with yogurt chips, almonds, cranberries, and blueberries instead of raisins. It turned out fantastic! But the dough was a lot stickier than I anticipated.

1st attempt at scones, these were recommended by a friend.  Wonderful!  I *used plain yogurt instead of sour cream; *added 2/3 c. craisins *reduced to  1/4 c. sugar and *added tsp lemon peel. Will be making this again. THANKS

If you've found this, your search for the perfect scone recipe is over! Not that this recipe needs additional ratings to prove that it rocks, but I thought I'd share my healthier variation. I substitute Greek Nonfat Plain Yogurt for the Sour Cream - no fat, more protein, no difference in taste or texture! I tried with regular nonfat yogurt once and it didn't turn out as well because it wasn't a dense enough texture, so you must go with Greek. I also sub half whole wheat flour (the Trader Joes one is really good and not gritty at all). I usually make this with 1 full Teaspoon Almond Extract, 1/2 cup Toasted Slivered Almonds, and 1/2 cup Dried Cherries (chopped to distibute flavor more evenly). It's amazing even though that's not even one of my preferred combinations! Recently I began making a simple glaze with powdered sugar, warm water, a dash of lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Any variation you choose should be great with this recipe, though!

Absolutely delicious! I didn't grate the butter - too complicated. You also don't need a food processor like some reviews say. What I do is thinly slice the butter then chop them into tiny matchsticks, they weren't even perfect matchsticks either. Afterwards, I take a fork and roughly incorporate the butter into the flour mixture. Besides that I didn't change a single thing. I love this recipe. I now make scones and store them in the freezer for an easy breakfast, just pop in the microwave for about 1 minute and you're good to go!

Although I didn't find these that simple to make with the grating of the butter and working it in with my hands and all, it was a bit messy. But the deliciousness made up for any personal complaints (laziness) I can make about preparing them. I left out the raisins. It went great with the Easy Devonshire Cream recipe from this site and rasberry preserves, so yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

This is my go to scone recipe. Although I like Grandma's scone recipe, I find that the flavor and texture of this recipe is better. I do follow the direction from the other recipe about combining the sour cream and baking soda and letting it sit until frothy. I'm not sure if it works, but it's never failed me!

Perfect scones.  I diced chilled butter and cut in with my hands like making biscuits, no need for proccessors or frozen butter.  I added t. cinnamon and t. vanilla to dough then drizzled glaze of conf. sugar, maple extract, van. extract, and milk on top.  So cinnamon maples scones and wow...just like Starbuck's but better!!

My family loves these scones.  I make them with Splenda and Smart Balance and they are delicious!  I just squish the soft Smart Balance into the flour with my fingers.  No freezing and grating needed.  I also use a pizza cutter to cut the dough into triangles.  It is much faster and easier than using a knife.  I can't wait to try these with some added bran or whole wheat flour.  
Here is a tip for special days and holidays - push a small cookie cutter about 1/8 inch into the top of the unbaked scone.  When you bake it, the design will expand and look really nice.  My kids loved the little hearts I put on the scones for Valentine's Day.

This recipe really doesn't need another baker weighing in with effusive praise, but I can't help myself -- just like I can't help gobbling up these delicious biscuits. I've tried scone recipes from friends and magazines, but this is THE BEST! This morning I made the orange/cranberry variety, and they turned out perfect. They're so much better than the orange/cranberry muffins I pay $2.50 each for at a nearby coffee shop. By the way,I found grating the frozen butter no problem at all. I'm serving these to friends tomorrow morning, then will head back to the kitchen to make another batch!

Love this recipe. I usually make craisin with almond extract or lemon poppy seed. For the poppy seeds 1-1/2 to 2 tablespoons of  seeds is plenty.

UPDATE 02/24/14: One reviewer states not to bother if you don't have a food processor...IGNORE THIS ADVICE. I have been making these scones for years, exactly as written, without a food processor. It make take longer but it is certainly not hard, by any stretch of the imagination. If you do not own a FP don't let that deter you from making and enjoying these wonderful treats! They are delicious!

I just finished making a batch of each flavor. I've tasted one of each and I think my fave are the almond/cherry although all are delicious (even though I forgot the salt in the orange/cran batch)! I am hosting a bridal shower next weekend and the theme is an English tea party so I wanted to make scones from scratch. I am confident these will be a hit. If not, I don't have a problem eating them myself! The only things I did different was used salted butter (all I had) and soaked the dried fruit according to the flavor it went with (i.e. - soaked cranberries in 2T OJ, soaked blueberries in lemon juice) and threw the liquid in with the batter. I did an egg wash then sprinkled with sugar. I don't have a food processor so used an old fashioned pastry blender and it turned out great. Overall they were easy and delicious. I can't wait for the shower to see what the guests (and the bride-to-be) think of them!

Excellent scone recipe! this is my first attempt at making scones and it was SO easy! I used dried cranberries instead of the raisins and added some slivered almonds and a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. They were easy to cut and were so delicious. Thanks for the great recipe. I will make it again and again. The next time, I will use chocolate chips or cinnamon chips if I can find some.

Very good! Made several times now, all good. I used the grater the first time, after that I just used my pastry blender. It was easier and faster. Everyone seemed to love them. One tip, a shot glass cuts them the perfect size for a little girls tea party.

Hubby made thse for my Mother's Day brunch...they're wonderful! He whirled up some white chocolate chips in the food processor to break them down into smaller pieces (he neevr measures anything so I can't tell you how much) as well as the dried cherries. He didn't bother to grate the butter; he just froze it, cut it into chunks & whirled it in the food processor w/ the flour/sugar until it was pea-sized.  Our guests were very impressed w/ this recipe...thanks again Pam!

This is a great recipe, except for the really ridiculous part about grating frozen butter.  I just put the dry ingredients in my food processor, cut up the very cold butter into the processor and then pulse until its cut in.  Then add wet ingredients, pulse.  Then fruit and/or nuts, pulse.  Viola! Start to finish 5 minutes.  Great scones.

Absolutley Heavenly!  I had to arm wrestle my boys to keep them from devouring the whole batch. These scones are FABULOUS!  I mixed it up a bit by adding Milk Chocolate Chips and Cinnamon along with an additional 1/4c of brown sugar.  These scones are way of the YUMMY chart!!  It's a keeper....BIG TIME!  Thanks for sharing a little slice of heaven.

AMAZING! I've been craving scones so I decided to make them.  My picky husband was skeptical but after trying one...he went back for THREE more!  I did not add any fruit, instead I added 1 TBL cinnamon to the dough and then sprinkled cinnamon-sugar on top before baking.  Absolutely divine!  I'm making more today because the first batch was gone within one day!

This was the very first time for me to make scones today (actually just baked and tasted some right now!).  It was great to choose this recipe for my first scone!!  Taste is good, texture is good, everything is perfect for me.  I didn't have dried blueberries so I tried to use frozen ones.  When I stired in berries, the dough seemed very wet but it was no problem after baked.  I will definitely use this recipe again!!

Fabulous, wonderful! These were not the bland, dry and dense scones you sometimes find at coffee shops - they were tender, flavorful and easy to make! I did the Cherry Almond version and added 1/2 c chocolate chips. Wow.

I have made these scones three times this month.  They are so easy and quick not to mention versitile.  I have tried them with Cranberries and almond, mini chocolate chips and vanilla and cappichino chips and  hazelnut.  My next will be cinnamon chips when I can find them.

These are simply wonderful!   Very easy and all of the variations are great.  If you make these without the raisins, they are the BEST for strawberry shortcakes.   Pam is a genious.  Go buy all of her cookbooks.  I did.  I have hundreds of cookbooks (seriously) and hers never get shelved, since I use them almost every day.   I've had good luck using my food processor for these. I mix all the dry ingredients in the work bowl, pulse in the butter (don't mix too much), add the egg and sour cream, pulse to barely combine, then add the dried fruit and nuts.  Easy peasy!

Awesome recipe!
I baked cranberry orange scone for our Sunday brunch, and it was a hit! My husband loved it.
I sure will use this recipe again and again.

So simple (like the title) and SO yummy. I made the cranberry orange version...perfection. For that chocolate fix, I added about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips too...and about a tsp. of the juice from the orange I zested. Try it-- you'll love it!!!

Really good, and consistent results. I used my Kitchenaid mixer, and just crumbed in frozen butter chunks. I stopped short of full crumb in the mixer, so I could finish mixing by hand. I am not an experienced baker, and have had numerous, er, failures... But not here!  I have made these three times, all with great success. I prefer a smaller portioned scone, so I divide the dough into two balls, then cut out mini wedges.  Cook time is a bit shorter, maybe a minute or so.  Hubby wanted to know where I got them...he says they are better than the ones I normally get at the bakery!  Hurray!

These scones were so easy to make and a huge hit. I doubled the recipe, substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and added the zest of one small lemon. The butter was at room temp when I cut it in, not frozen, and I still achieved very good results. I was able to put a double batch together in about 15 minutes, very easy to make. They were served room temp with strawberry jam and clotted cream. My British in-laws raved about them. This was my first attempt at from scratch scones and I will use this recipe moving forward, it's a real winner.

This is the best scone recipe I have found; I've been using it for years. I usually make the combination that calls for the dried cherries and almond extract. (I do increase the almond extract amount a tiny bit for more flavor.) Scones are intended to be a bit on the dry side, but not "unedible dry." This recipe is just right. I'm quite sure it's the sour cream that makes the difference. I'm also kind of perplexed by the comments from those who think it's too hard to make these without a food processor. I've made this recipe both with and without a food processor, and neither way is labor intensive to me. The key to making them easier to mix by hand is to use a cheese grater to grate the frozen butter into the flour mixture. This makes it much easier to work the butter into the flour.

I love love love love this recipe.  It's so adaptable!  Don't have sour cream?  I've used vanilla yogurt.  Don't have eggs?  I've used EggBeaters.  Don't like raisins?  I have made so many combinations by now!  My favorites are white chocolate apricot (substitute dried apricots for raisins and then once they are baked, melt white chocolate and smear it on them!!) and cinnamon brown sugar (leave the raisins out, but add a healthy sprinkling of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and then before you put them in the oven, sprinkle with more cinnamon, brown sugar, and regular sugar)  YUMMMM!  But... caution.  Icing is a must on all scones in my opinion.  Just mix together some powdered sugar and water and drizzle it on them after they bake with a spoon.  It will take a little while to dry, but it's so worth it.  Sometimes I just eat them before it dries lol.  I use the food processor method.  SO EASY.  Pulse dry ingredients.  Cut up your butter into half tablespoon size and pulse it in there several times.  Add in your fixins and pulse that.  Then add in the wet ingredients (no need to pre-mix them) and pulse that until it looks like a solid mass of dough!  SO VERY EASY.

Just made this.  My first time making homemade scones.  I will stop buying them now.  I substituted lowfat plain yogurt for the sour cream (I did not have any sour cream) and did not add raisins.  I added cinnamon.  It has been great!!

This recipe was lovely to eat and so simple to make!  I made them for a Bridal shower and they were a HIT! These scones are more cakey than biscuity and they are perfect.  I used a Kitchen Aid mixer instead of grating the butter but if I'd had more time, I would have followed that part of the recipe exactly.  I made some other modifications too - instead of using a half C of sour cream, I used 1/4 C sour cream, 1/4 C vanilla Greek yogurt.

For the fruits part of this, I also some of my own partially dehydrated raspberries instead of the suggested raisins or dried cranberries.  I put the raspberries in at the very end and turned the dough over in the bowl only about three to four times to ensure that so that they wouldn't disintegrate completely but also so that I would get the full flavor of the raspberries.

If you want a little more 'umph' in flavor, I would recommend using an extract like raspberry (in this case) or coconut (something I'd like to try in the near future.)  I will absolutely keep this recipe and make these again soon.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

After eating the best scone I've ever tasted at a superb breakfast restaurant in Clearwater, Fla (called Wildflower), I was on a mission to duplicate. That one was not at all dry or crumbly but tasted soft and somewhat moist while keeping a scone's true texture. This recipe is dangerously close. It's excellent.

I didn't bother with grating the butter. Instead I melted it and stirred by hand into the dry ingredients. I didn't find it difficult at all to mix. Added the zest of one orange, a 1/2 tsp orange extract and 1/2 c dry cranberries when adding the sour cream mixture. Rather than fool with a floured surface and rolling all the dough (what a mess), I floured my hands and scooped a bit bigger than a golf ball amount of dough and pressed it flat and into a triangle in my palm. Used parchment and cooked exactly 15 minutes. So, so good! At Wildflower, I had a plain scone served with a dollop of raspberry jam on top and fresh whipped cream--I'll try that next! All sorts of varieties possible with this recipe. :-)

These were great! I made these in my Ninja blender. I put in the dry ingredients first and pulsed a few times to combine, then I added chopped refrigerated butter, pulsed some more. Then added the sour cream and egg and some lemon zest. I made my dough round on a pizza pan then pressed frozen blueberries into the top of the round. Used a pizza cutter to cut triangles into the round just before adding to the oven. I baked them about 19 minutes (a couple more than recipe calls for), then cut them again with the pizza cutter. The hardest part of this recipe was waiting for them to cool!

I was a little skeptical at first because the recipe was so simple that I had doubts about how they would taste.  Boy, was I wrong!  These are AMAZING! I've made them twice and both times they have been a hit!  First time, I used dried cranberries and white chocolate chips, yum!!  The second time, I use the rest of the white chocolate chips with diced up fresh strawberries.  Again, delish!  I also made them both at altitude, with no changes and they turned out just fine.  The only thing I'll do different next time is use raw granulated sugar to top them off with.  The regular sugar is a little to fine to create the crunchy texture I would have liked.

I made the orange cranberry version of this and they are seriously fantastic! I also whipped up a little icing (powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk) that I drizzled over them. Gorgeous and delicious! :)

I have made these SO many times & received ridulous amounts of raves on them. Ive never used the raisins/ currants, instead Ive used blueberries, black cherries, etc. I also lways make a glaze that consits of melted butter, powdered sugar, milk & vanilla. This recipe is amazing!

Wow these were better than the Nigela recipe I had been using for years. I used salted butter--its all I had--added 2 tsps of cream of tartar(always makes scones more tender) a tablespoon of white sugar, and omitted the raisins. I did not freeze the butter; used a  pastry cutter to mix it just until the dough held together. Tender, moist, and crumbly we gobbled these up quickly!

These Scones are fantastic! So easy to make. Be sure not to handle or mix too much after adding sour cream/egg. Just enough to moisten and form.

I wanted to try baking some scones after having some at a tea room. I'm not much of a baker and these were really simple to make. I didn't have a food processor so I grated the butter as suggested in the recipe and it was pretty simple. I made plain, chocolate chip and lemon blueberry. The were AMAZING! Everyone loved them and they were gone within the day. I used frozen blueberries instead of dried, it made the dough a little sticky and hard to work with. I was afraid they wouldn't come out well, but they were the best ones! I will definitely be making them again!

I LOVE this recipe!  So easy!  Have made it 2 times now and each time it's so yummy!  I add 1 cup of fresh berries.  You have to add a little extra flour once it gets to the floured board, but only a little bit to take down the sticky.  They turn out so yummy!!

This is the best recipe for scones.  So simple yet so delicious.  I have used this recipe and  made orange/walnut scones two days in a row  and cant wait to try another type next weekend.  Today I divided the dough into three equal parts and made 24 small scones.  Very light on the inside and a bit crusty on the outside, perfect.

These turned out great.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was actually quite easy to freeze the butter for about 10 min or so then use the grater.  I used the 1/2 tsp. of almond extract and dried cranberries in mine.  YUM!  Will definitely make again and try other flavor combinations.

Lovely, easy and forgiving recipe.  I have made this several times.  I used cold butter and cut it up using a pastry blender, much like making pie crust.  Normally, I use light sour cream with fantastic results.  This time, I used full fat plain yogurt and it was very good.  Crunchy exterior & soft fluffy interior.  Used 1/4 sugar with 1/2 cup frozen blueberries.

these scones are awesome. If you don't have sour cream you can easily use plain Greek yogurt. I've made them several times with different flavor combinations and it always works out well. LOVE THIS.

Instead of raisins, I mixed in orange rind and diced dried pineapple.  Also sprinkled some coconut and brown sugar.. turned out great!  Thank you to all who recommended using a food processor!

These scones were awesome! I made chocolate chip scones instead though. I also used fat free sour cream. These were delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is fabulous. I tried to use my food processor, as others have, but the frozen butter even after breaking it up, got congealed into the blades in the processor so I pulled everything out and used my handmixer. Worked like a charm and the scones were great. I actually mailed these to a friend as a thank you, and she said they were "To Die for!" YEAH! Btw, did next day air, and she got them the very next day still FRESH AND GREAT! Will DEF make again! YUM!!!!

I followed the recipe but used fresh cherries and crushed almonds on top.  I added a small bit of vanilla to the batter and a pinch or two of cinnamon to the dry mix.  They turned out fantastic!   I'm so happy with the outcome.

These are flakey and delicious. I don't think you need a food processor, either. I added chocolate chips or just cinnamon and sugar. They are best served warm and eaten the same day.

for a great savory scone - cut the sugar in half and add a handful of shredded cheddar cheese and a few snips of fresh chives - awesome! 
Made several variations - choc. chips; pecans and caramel bits; fresh blueberries. all yummy. I usually make two rounds and cut each into six for a smaller scone. 
Will try with Greek yogurt instead of sour cream next time to save a few cals!

By far best ever scone recipe.  My friends are always requesting that I make these for them.  The butter must be grated as specified.  Definitely do NOT add the raisins until after the butter has been incorporated.  It will make it nearly impossible to work the butter in.  These are just perfect the way they are!!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

This recipe was very easy to follow and basic. I used blueberries and sliced an actual vanilla bean pod ($8 at my local supermarket). My scones did not come out like the traditional scone (or the ones at Starbucks) but more with a bread consistency. Still delicious! :)

Excellent!! I made them as is and they were perfect. I added vanilla the second time around and they did not come out as good. I made them as directed and then tried what others recommended in regards to the food processor, either way it was easy to make, considering the yummy results!!

This was a very easy recipe. I didn't use a food processor like many other reviewers but it was still really easy. We put ginger, lemon zest, and lemon juice in them. Other than that, I didn't change anything. They were PERFECT!

I made fair scones from a mix yesterday. They were pretty good. Decided to try this recipe and compare it to the mix. Made a few subsitutions. Used margerine, french vanilla yogurt, and omitted the raisins. Both my dh and I did a taste comparison and this recipe won hands down. Ate it with butter and a mango/peach/orange jam. Yum!

Fantastic recipe. Had a left over egg from an egg wash and extra sour cream, prompting me to try these out.
You don't need a food processor for this. It's easy to do by hand and the scones are delicious. The less you mix, the fluffier they are, like biscuits. I think the sour cream adds a unique taste to these.

Excellent recipe!  I made mine in a food processor (process dry with frozen butter, add wet and process, then add fruit and pulse) which takes only minutes.  I added a bag (5 oz) of dried cherries, and 1 tsp of almond extract.  The scones have a perfect texture and flavor.

Awesome basic scone.  I did use my food processor, but not due to laziness.  I like the results.  Instead of raisins, I used dried cranberries and orange zest. I want to try them next with dried cherries with almond extract.  Will use this recipe over and over.

I made these without a bread maker easily. They were great and loved the pics taken as well. Caloric content isnt too bad either. I will make them again for sure and reading the other reviews will keep this as the primary scone recipe

I absolutely love scones and this recipe is wonderful! Have made substituting the raisins with strawberries, blueberries and chocolate chips. The first go, I grated the butter but found that I get similar results when using my food processor. I always keep a stick of butter in the freezer now as this is a super quick and easy breakfast on busy days!

This scone is awesome!  I've just finished baking and tasted it when it's warm with cream.  It's so good that I ate two in a roll.  

As I didn't have sour cream, I substituted an equal amount of yogurt for sour cream.  The outcome was perfect!

I wish I could give this more stars because it was amazing!  I did make some notable changes (to make it healthier and based on what I had in the house)--I used oil instead of butter, plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and dried apricots instead of raisins.  I also threw in a dash of lemon extract.  My only problem was they took around twice as long to bake.  This will be a great breakfast tomorrow morning!

I loved the recipe – and its simplicity :) (I did use food processor!)
I really wanted some savory scones (like some I tried at a nice coffee shop)
This is what I did for the savory ones: I halved the recipe, put the dry ingredients (I omitted the sugar) in the food processor, added butter and run the food processor. I added  (all very approximate, since I used my eye and didn’t think to measure it!) ½ tsp Italian seasoning, ¼ tsp rosemary and 1/4 tsp basil, 2 TBSP mozzarella and some parmesan cheese and run the food processor again.  I mixed 1 egg with ½ cup of sour cream and spooned about 2/3 of it to the food processor, I added as much as I needed to make the dough to form. I baked these on lower temp (350F) for about 20 min. Turned really well! I did increase the salt a bit and I feel that if you are using parmesan, you shouldn’t increase salt. All in all – the recipe really helped me to created really good savory scones!
I actually did the sweet ones too, following the exact instructions – these were perfect, we loved them!

Excellent!  I added extra sugar because we like them a bit sweeter.  I've made plain, blueberry/lemon, and cranberry/orange/walnut scones and they were all delicous.  I always keep a stick of butter in the freezer now just for this recipe.

Make this all the time! So easy to create your own variations.  My favorite is orange zest, chopped up pecans (a little vanilla) and dried cranberries.

These scones were very easy, and were excellent!  I used dried cranberries, instead of the currants, because that is what I had on hand.  Also, I only had about 6 1/2 T of butter on hand, and they came out fine.  The outside was lightly crisp, and the inside was moist.  I will always use this recipe for my scones.

Fabulous and so easy! I used 1/2 cup blackberries rather than raisins. I also added 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. Amazing! Will definately be making these again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is an AMAZING recipe.  We loved these scones.  I made them and then froze them individually so we could take one out at a time.  I reheated for 45 seconds and they are PERFECT!!  My dad was so impressed at how moist they were.   He didn't think it was a scone cuz he's never had one that wasn't dry.  LOL!

OMG...these are GREAT. I made them with dried blueberries. Didn't need to press to the side fo the bowl...just dumped the final crumbly mixture onto a floury surface and squeezed together and lightly pounded to form 8" disk shape. Then cut, painted with milk and sugared. This is now my favorite scone recipe.

I made the lemon-blueberry version, they were very good. I made one mistake though, patted the dough into the circle, cut in wedges, and left them in place. After the max baking time was up, the middle was still unbaked, so I slid them apart some and continued baking about 10 more minuntes. Next time I will not leave them in a circle. I also drizzled a simple mixture of lemon juice and powdered sugar on top.

My sister gave me a copy of this recipe that I have been using for a few years.  It's simply the best.  I wanted to share it with a friend but won't be seeing her to give her a hard copy & so I googled it & here it is!  So I emailed it to her.  My addtion or change is - I don't use sour cream  I use a flavored yogurt to go with the type of scone I'm making.  I add a little more of the dried fruits also and for the lemon and orange recipes - more grated lemon or orange.  I have gjven this recipe to a few people - it's the easiest/best even for a non-baker like me.

I just made these tonight, substituting dried apricots for the raisins.  I also used the food processor to make the dough.  It went together in no time at all.  I added all the dry ingredients to the processesor, put in my apricots whole and pulsed a few times to chop them in.  I mixed the sour cream and egg together in a small bowl and then poured it into dry ingredients, processing it until the dough formed a ball.  Oooh, that's some sticky dough!  .......They just came out of the oven.  Mmmm, they smell wonderful.  Yup, a taste test confirms that they ARE, in fact, yummy.  I can't wait to make these again using other mix-ins - especially the cherry-almond!  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Simply delicious! I used a food processer to simplify cutting the butter into the flour and substituted yogurt for sour cream. When I laid out the dough, I folded in fresh blueberries and dark chocolate chips. Skipped the dusting of sugar on the top.

I added some lemon zest and lemon extract for a bit of extra flavor, but I'm sure they would have come out just as tasty without the lemon!

I prepared this banana bread exactly as it instructs and the bread was a bit bland as far as sugar, and very dense. Almost dry! I baked it for 55 min. as supposed to 60 -65. I wasn't too thrilled with the recipe :(

Some of the reviews said a food processor must be used in this recipe or else its too hard/inauspicious. I used a fork and did not have any difficulties with following the recipe! Also, for me this recipe yielded at least a dozen if not more scones. I did not used raisins/ currants, still taste great!

Yes, the batter is STICKY but if you dust your hands in flour, you will be fine.  I cut mine into 6 instead of 8.  I also skipped the raisins and used a crushed up hollow chocolate easter egg.  :)  I grated the butter for about 1/4 cup then got frustrated and just finely chopped it- it came out wonderful!  Thank you for this recipe, will for sure be making again!

Just phenomenal! I made just one substitution- I used 1/2cup of plain yogurt instead of sour cream and it turned out just wonderfully. It was soft, crumbly, and moist! It was better than starbucks scones that I normally get.  O, I also made it into plain scones by not putting raisins. With a dollop of jam, these scones were just perfect.

I followed the recipe step-by-step but while mixing the dough, it did not "come together" into a ball so in the end it was very crumbly, falling apart on my Silpat.   It took more than 15-17 minutes (in my oven) to bake these; a total of almost 30 minutes to bake them to a golden brown.  Outcome: These Simple Scones were very plain-tasting and I felt that they were missing something -- perhaps pure vanilla extract or almond extract? Anyway I thought all the butter and sour cream would help boost the flavor a little but it did not. That said, I was very disappointed with the outcome.   I chose this recipe over Grandma Johnson's Scones only because Grandma Johnson's recipe was for 12 scones. Perhaps I'll try Grandma's recipe next. In the meantime, though, what am I going to do with these leftover scones?  I'm giving this 2 stars because it could have been worse...

Not much of a scone.  More like a cross between a cookie, scone and biscut.  But it is really simple.  There's got to be better scone recipes.

I've made this three times now in about as many weeks, and am quickly getting addicted.  I don't have a food processer, and the grating was getting difficult until I started using my "Italian restaurant" cheese grater - the rotary kind where you hold a handle and turn a knob rather than holding onto the butter itself.  It worked VERY well, especially when I cool the grater down in the freezer for a bit first (I keep reading about how keeping things cold is the secret to good scones).

Excellent scone recipe.  If you do not want to grate in the cold butter cutting it in with pastry blender certainly works.  Also, I usually put it back in the fridge for about 20 mins. to chill it again. For those of you who find the texture cake-like you must remember that a scone is not supposed to be like a biscuit.

I have used this recipe often and my family asks for it at least once a week. To make things easier, I melt the butter instead of grating it. The melted butter works exactly the same as the grated. I also tend to substitute the dried fruit for real frozen berries. The younger two at my house like that better. I have also put in wheat flour instead of white. The only difference here is that you need to put in a tiny bit more sour cream because the wheat flour is more absorbent than the white.

Lemon blueberry heaven! I made this recipe as lemon blueberry scones with some minor changes. I only noticed when I went to add the sour cream that I didn't have enough, so I used 1/4 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup of homemade buttermilk (whole milk + a squirt of lemon juice). I added 1 tsp of lemon peel to the dry mixture and 1/2 tsp of lemon extract to the wet mixture. I replaced the raisins with 3/4 cup of frozen blueberries. Instead of topping them with sugar, I made a lemon glaze with 3/4 cup of confectioner's sugar and 1 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice. They were SUPERB! I had a couple guests over for coffee, and we ate them all. They raved about them and asked for the recipe. I think I'm going to make another batch tomorrow! This will definitely replace my previous lemon blueberry scone recipe.

This is the best recipe! I have made these scones fresh and also have frozen them for over a month and put them in the oven, and both ways they are simply fantastic! I have gotten rave reviews from friends, family and co-workers. I have used dried blueberries, fresh and frozen-- all lovely, but for me, the frozen berries are my favorite, I add them in frozen, and as they defrost they give the scones a lovely purple/blueish tint. Simple, delicious, try them!

I can't seem to get this recipe quite right.  The scones come out all right, but not perfect.  My wife, on the other hand, knocks it out of the park every time.  Pretty much confirms to me that it's my inept over-handling of the dough before cooking it.  Edit: Nailed it this morning.  Till now my butter hadn't been cold enough starting out.

This is the scone recipe I've been searching for!  I made them twice this week.  The first time, exactly as written, for a ladies tea and they were a big hit.  I then made a half recipe for Easter Sunday breakfast for my husband and myself.  Since we try to watch what we eat, I used 1 tablespoon less butter, increased the sour cream (light kind) by 1 tablespoon, egg substitute for the egg, and slightly more baking soda for lightness.  I also used dried cranberries and blueberries in place of the raisins.  They were absolutely delicious and didn't taste lightened at all.  Reminded me of the scones I used to buy years ago at Timothy's in NYC.

This is the first time I have rated any recipe here. This recipe has more of a muffin-like texture. I must say that, for a first time scone maker, I am very very happy with the results! It was sooo easy and fast. I divided the dough in two parts. I added a tsp of cinnamon and one chopped apple to one part and left the other half as the recipe indicated. Both were mmmm delicious!   Thanks for the recipe! It is a great base and I will be making this over and over again with added fruit and nuts! THANKS!

Very good, I made the lemon bluberry kind. I did not have any sour cream so I used plain yogurt instead and it turned out wonderfully.

These turned out great.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and used blueberries instead of raisins.  Also, I melted the butter and mixed it with the liquid before adding to the dry - this worked great.  Why hassle  freezing and shredding the butter if you don't have to?

Wonderful recipe! We have a coffee shop nearby that makes these with white chocolate chips and raspberries or dried apricots. Now I can make a whole batch for what it costs for one at the coffee shop. Thanks!

I made these today and they are wonderful.  This was my very first time make scones.  I made fresh blueberry scones with a hit of orange zest.  I don't have a food processer and it wasn't needed at all to make these. I like to cook the old fashion way anyhow, as my grandmother did.  I will be making these on a regular basis.

I know I'm not adding much to the conversation, but I feel compelled to give  this recipe 5 stars. I always make the lemon-blueberry scones and they're fantastic. My coworkers go nuts when I bring leftovers on Monday mornings. My only suggestion: Mix the dry ingredients the night before to save a few seconds in the morning. Don't freeze the butter. Throw it all in a food processor and pulse a bit, then add the blueberries and pulse a few more times. And I do make an egg wash sometimes. These things are just plain delish. Enough said.

This is definitely a keeper.  Using frozen butter made these unbelievable flakey, with a nice, crisp crust.  I found the easiest way to incorporate the frozen butter was to dice it with a knife, then put it in the food processor with 1 cup of the flour until the pieces were slightly larger than pea-sized.  Then, I added the other dry ingredients and quickly gave them a whirl, before stirring in the wet ingredients.  (I used fat-free sour cream).  I made 2 batches, borrowing from ideas submitted by others.  One batch had fresh blueberries, lemon zest, nutmeg, vanilla and lemon extract in the scones, with a powdered sugar/lemon zest/lemon extract/non-fat cream glaze.  The other batch had cinnamon and vanilla in the scones, and a powdered sugar/creme brulee creamer/maple extract glaze.  I topped that one with glazed pecans.  Both kinds were a "wow" at a potluck.  I look forward to trying other variations.

Great scone recipe!  Nice & moist.  I did a Peach Cobbler variation by adding 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon & 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the scone mixture plus a little extra sugar.  I also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the sour cream mixture before combining all the ingredients.  Also, Instead of making traditional scone triangles, i spread the mixture to cover the bottom of a 9" square cake pan, coated it w/ a thin layer of real butter & sprinkled w/ a cinnamon, nutmeg & sugar mixture, then baked it.  When it was finished, i topped it w/ a peach cobbler topping & made some Devonshire cream to go with it.  Absolutely Delish!!  Works great as a peach cobbler without being gooey & runny.

This was one of the best scone recipes that I've ever made.  They came out perfectly moist and delicious.  I made the Orange Cranberry and Lemon Blueberry variations.  I was unable to find dried blueberries, but frozen worked just fine.  I also made some Apple Cinnamon ones and a Pumpkin Caramel version.  For the pumpkin scones, I used 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/2 cump pumpkin in the 8 serving recipe.  After they're baked, drizzle with caramel ice cream topping while still warm.  They were great.

I come from a family that eats scones at least once a month for as long as I can remember.  We have tried many different recipes but none of them have ever called for sour cream before.  It is the secret ingredient which solves the biggest problem with scones - them being too dry.  This is the new recipe my family will use from now on.  And they store great for up to 5 days.  So far I've made them plain (no raisins), with dried cranberries, dried cranberries with orange rind, coconut and mac nuts, and cinnamon.  Each time they were fabulous.  Also I don't put the sugar on top, doesn't need it.    update: So far the best combinations are cinnamon and chocolate chips, and dried cranberried with either lemon, lime or orange rind.

Grating the butter was great (much more efficient and effective than using a pastry cutter or criss-crossing knives).  To keep the butter ice cold, I put the shavings back in the freezer for awhile after grating it.  The scones were very tender and delicious.

I made these scones to take to a ceilidh which our Dragon Boat Breast Cancer Survivor Team hosted for 150 people and they were a hit. I made 4 times the recipe . Just changed the quantity from 8 to 32 and went from there. I have made a lot of recipes for scones, but I think these have to be the best . I will definitely make them again and can't wait to see what a single batch will turn out like.Thanks again All Recipes for another tested recipe.

Wow! This is by far the best recipe for scones I have ever made. 
I was looking for a perfect recipe that had ingredients that I had on hand, and this was perfect - however I did not use frozen butter, I used melted butter. I took the easy way out and didn't grate it. I found that using melted butter was easier to handle. The resulting scone was absolutely amazing! Sixteen minutes was the perfect baking time. Unlike a lot of other scone recipes I've tried, the middle of the scones were not doughy at all. 
I really like topping these with blueberry jam. 
Great recipe!

My mother in law is a scone addict and very pickey. She loved these as did the rest of the family. I usually don't like scones, but can't stop eating them. I used the food processor method, a real time saver. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I made these this morning to take to a family brunch.  I made the almond cherry version and this was my first time ever making scones.  They turned out amazing!!!  I made it exactly as stated except that I added about a tablespoon of almond paste with the butter and used turbinado sugar to sprinkle on top instead of regular granulated sugar.  Everyone who ate one said they were amazing.  My father-in-law  said that he didn't usually like scones because they were usually dry, but these were moist and yummy.  Definitely will make these again and again.

I love this recipe. It's super easy, contains only a few ingredients and is easily modified for different scones. I personally prefer lemon cranberry. I zest 2 lemons to give it an extra kick and use lite vanilla yogurt for extra flavor!

Didn't make any changes except sprinkling with additional cinnamon/sugar before baking.  Used cookinmom3's tips to make everything in the food processor and they were SUPER easy!  I liked that I had all the ingredients already in my cupboard.  Oh, I didn't have frozen butter so I used refrigerated and in the food processor it didn't matter.  Thanks!

If you like dry scones then this is for you! Unfortunately, for me the four times that I used this recipe, each time, the scones were TOO dry for my fancy. Perhaps its because I chopped my frozen butter instead of grating it like the recipe called for. I tried grating it, but it was too difficult for me. One review also shared the sam concern and that person ended up using their food processor. Ah, what a wonderful idea! Perhaps I'll try this recipe one more time, this time using the grater option on my food processor. Nonetheless, this is a dry scone recipe, so if you like dry, you'll like this.

so delicious!  I brushed the tops with eggwash and sprinkled with sugar, and used choc. chips instead of the dried fruit, and they were perfect!  This is a basic scone base that can be used with so many different fillings and flavors, rich and moist, a keeper!

Yum!!!  I made the orange cranberry kind, except instead of sour cream I used orange-cream flavored yogurt (because that's all I had)  I also drizzled an orange/sugar glaze over each one and they are just delicous!

Loved these scones. Made the cranberry orange version and served to my quilting group.  They raved about them! The frozen butter and sour cream must have contributed to their moistness. I used salted butter in stead of unsalted and brushed with egg wash and 1/2 teas. sugar per scone prior to baking. This gave them an almost glazed appearance.  Also cut them with a pizza cutter. I made an orange butter to serve with them which consisted of 1 stick of butter and 3 teaspoons of orange marmalade...yummy!!

Simply put, this recipe is perfect. I've made batches for work several times (blueberry-lemon is by far the favourite, though all combinations are lovely), and co-workers regularly ask me to bring them  in. They taste great fresh out of the oven and with a cup of coffee. The scones will keep up to 5 days in an airtight container.

Very delicious. I was looking for a Starbucks copycat recipe, and while this recipe wasn't the same, it was delicious in it's on way. These scones are more moist and have less sugar, but don't keep as well as Starbucks ones.

Yummy.  This was my first attempt at scones.  I didn't have any unsalted butter only regular. I should have reduced the salt by a bit to compensate.  I will next time. I did add the extra sugar like some suggested and then topped them with raw sugar. I used golden raisins. I also cooked these on a stone.  They cooked evenly and perfect. Everyone loved them and I will be making these often. Ü

I have tried many scone recipes looking for the perfect scone and this was it!  Scones were moist and perfectly sweet (I did put in 1/2C sugar and others suggested for a sweeter scone) and easy to make.  I made one plain batch and one with mini chocolate chips and my family loved them all!  Thanks for sharing.

Thes truly were "simple" scones. I added 1/2 cup of cranberries and the family gobbled 'em up.

Created the orange/cranberry for my 1st time ever -- didn't even cut them out, just mounded them (made about 12), and they are moist, full of "scone" flavor -- awesome!

These were so good! I added lots of chocolate chips instead of the raisins and they came out perfect! Beautiful and full of flavor - they also kept very well and were still soft, not crumbly, a couple of weeks later.

Wow.  These scones are to die for.  Moist and tender, they are just sweet enough with the sugar on top for a morning rush.  I made the Orange Sauce for Crepes from this site to go with, but found it to be overkill.  The only complaint I have is that I hate cleaning box graters, so I will just cut up the butter in small pieces next time with a knife.  Otherwise, her directions are superb.

EXCELLENT!!I also used 1/2C craisins and 1/2C white choc chips. In place of the raisins. Try buttermilk instead of sour cream too. It made no difference to the taste and/or texture. I have a divided scone pan (williams/sonoma) that works so much better than trying to shape this dough by hand. The less you mess with the dough the more moist it will be.

Really good. I used orange flavored crasins instead of rasins and also added chocolate chips. Would reccomend flouring hands when handling the dough though because it is REALLY sticky

I just made this recipe and the scones turned out perfect. I tried two other scone recipes and both fell flat, literally. After trying the previous recipes with cream and half and half ; sour cream and egg seemed like an unusual choice. But it worked!  I added fresh blueberries by pressing them into the already cut dough and put infused lemon sugar on top. Baked for 15 min ... the scones rose, were light and fluffy and cut perfectly.  I challenged myself and made homemade clotted cream and had to find a scone that was worthy.  I found it! Thanks.

Delicious! Easy to add your own fruit, nuts, chocolate chips or other goodies. Using a food processor makes this recipe easy as a snap! Add all dry ingredients, pulse to mix, then add cold butter and process until cornmeal texture. Add goodies, I used dried cranberries, pulse. Finally add the egg/sour cream mixture or egg/Greek yogurt mixture works too, then process until dough forms a ball. Total prep time is about 10 minutes.

I do it by hand, using a cheese grater to grate the butter, and mix it in manually to create the cornmeal-esque texture. It's certainly work but baking is work because it's finicky. I might attempt the food processor tonight since I'll be doing 4 batches (coffee, chocolate, lemon poppyseed, and plain) and my hands might object to doing that so many times :) I do add a bit of extra butter, about a tablespoon or two, to make them a little more moist which isn't in true scone form but is preferred in our house. All in all, this is a great, easy recipe.

I always shake up this recipe a little bit. I tend to lean towards a more savoury scone. Today I am using frozen herbed goat cheese and bacon. Adding 1 tsp of onion powder really adds to the savoury flavour!!!! (Cut back to 1/2 of the sugar). I top with a bit of grated cheddar before baking.

I made these yesterday.  We have a scone place near where I work and I occasionally go there and get one to have with my coffee.  They have a chocolate orange scone so when I seen this recipe I thought now I can try and make my own.  I followed the recipe except I put chocolate chips in instead of raisins and added approx. 1 tsp orange zest.  Well I won't have to go to the scone bakery now as these tasted just as good, if not better.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are definitely better than what you buy at bakeries but I was a bit disappointed as they are on the dry side. I baked them for 16 minutes and the bottoms were brown while the tops were still pale. I broiled them for another minute to get the tops golden. Maybe 400F is too hot for my oven? I wish they were a bit more moist but the flavor itself is very good. I might give them another go but lower the baking temp.

Great! added chopped dates instead of raisins in first batch, then chopped dates and chocolate chips in second batch Both were very good These were my first time trying to make scones and will be making them again. Also the grated  frozen butter was ingenious!!Will be using that trick every time I need to make crumbs.

These can be made ahead to free up your time on the day of a big party!  I baked these, froze them, and warmed them in a 350 degree oven for a little less than 10 minutes the day of the big party.  It worked beautifully!  I *hate* to clean my food processor, so I took a chance: I substituted Butter Flavor Crisco for the butter, and mixed everything by hand with a pastry blender.  The result? The most FANTASTIC scones I have ever made!  I used to focus the attention on the add-ins rather than the scones, because I took it for granted the pastry would be dry and bland.  Not these!  The only variety I have made so far is several batches with Craisins and white chocolate chips.  I can't wait to experiment with more flavors.  This is one of the best things I have ever made, and I believe it's the recipe I have received the most requests for.

I didn't have any sour cream so I used the same amount of unsweetened Greek yogurt, through a cheese cloth for about 40 minutes. I also used about 1/4 cup of whole wheat to make myself believe they are a little more healthy. These babies are so freaking tasty, I'm glad the recipe is only eight scones, or I'd eat 20 in one sitting.

My father-in-law refused to believe that I didn't buy these, they were so good. I've made them twice-- once with chocolate chips and once with raisins. Both were fantastic! I added extra sugar inside and on top, though, but only because we're all sugar addicts.

I doubled up the recipe for my High Tea. I did increase the baking powder to 3 tsp and the bicarb to 1 tsp (my rule of thumb is 1 tsp of leavening agent per cup of flour). When I mixed the sour cream/eggs into the flour/butter, it was way too dry, so I added about 1/2 milk little by little until my dough was coming together and a bit sticky. The doubled up quantity yielded 32  2" diameter scones, which I brushed with an egg yolk mixed with 1 Tsp milk before baking.
The taste and texture are wonderful!!! Maybe next time I will reduce the sugar a bit though but that's my personal taste.

3.5 stars. Batter was easy to handle; ingredient measurements worked perfectly. Texture was easily 5 stars. My disappointment was the lack of flavor. I rarely eat sweets, so I was surprised the sugar & salt didn't provide enough tastiness. Maybe that could be had with some vanilla, almond extract, or orange rind. Truth be told, I was a little embarrassed to serve them they were so bland. My guest liked them but recommended I add some vanilla to the batter if I bake them again.

I tried this about 6 months ago and make them regularly now.  Absolutely perfect!  I use the beater bar with my Kitchen Aid mixer - it is no fail.  I took the hint from the cafe owner - mix the dry ingredients, turn the mixer on low and drizzle in the butter . . oh my gosh, it makes these beautiful little clumps, just like finger mixing.  Then I put is much more goodies - a good 2 cups worth (usually a mix of coarsely chopped pecans, dried cherries and craisins and raisins - pretty much what ever sounds good). . and sprinkle the top with slivered almonds and sugar.   I keep wanting to frost them, but they don't last long enough!   Don't be afraid to try the mixer method as the cleanup is way easier than the food processor!

Excellent recipe!  I used my kitchenaid to mix in the butter, and it worked perfectly.  Scones were light and cakey inside, and flaky on the outside.  My son said these scones were as good as any he has made (and he's a professional chef!)  Recipe worked great, it may have been a dry day as I had to add a couple tablespoons of milk to the mixture to hold together.  Otherwise, this recipe is easy and product is delicious - a real keeper!

I have used this recipe each time I've made scones and it always comes out good and gets raves!  I've used it to make chocolate chip scones and rosemary Parmesan scones, omitting the sugar.  Each has been delicious.

I used brown sugar instead of white, and just cut in the butter like you would for a pie crust. The BEST scones I have ever had! They tasted like a brown sugar pop-tart!

I found this to be the perfect scone recipe.  It is great if you follow it exactly, but it is also very forgiving.  I didn't have quite the right amount of sour cream, so I put in what I had and then added some heavy cream and it turned out just fine.

I've also done the blueberry and lemon variation, as well as, cranberry orange, orange with chocolate shavings and apple butter with chopped walnuts.

I miscalculated on one batch and put in 1 teaspoon of salt and it was fine.

This recipe rivals those of a top Celtic bakery in the area!

Wow, just made these and had one warm out of the oven, mmm!  I will be making these again for sure.  I used low fat sour cream this time because that's what I had/use but will try with full fat next time to see if there is a difference (you're eating scones, so what's a few more grams of fat, lol!).  I made these with fresh blueberries and lemon zest and juice.  I also made a lemon drizzle icing for them and they were great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream and 1/2 the butter it calls for.  They still turned out pretty good.  I will experiment more with the butter.  I also added fresh blueberries.  This was the first time I've baked scones EVER and it was pretty easy so I will try again and again!

Perfect recipe for all those apt dwellers out there without food processors! I put the stick of butter in the freezer before putting together the dry ingredients and it was a snap to grate it.  Couldn't have taken more than 15 minutes to put together.  (And I'm not very adept at baking usually!)  Used the zest of one lemon and 1 tsp vanilla extract and they came out perfectly tasty! Pretty fool-proof recipe!!

I have making the same recipe for scones for many years and they are very good BUT this recipe makes a better scone than  I have ever had on either side of the pond. I followed the recipe exectly.  I ll never have to try another recipe for scones. This is it. The best.

What a fabulous recipe! I made them for a tea party but I divided the dough into four equal parts and cut them into 6 scones each to make 24 mini scones. I lowered the temperature to 375 and baked them for about 35 minutes. Thanks to 'Caljane' for the tip on making them using the food processor! * * * It was soooo easy and fast! But most importantly - they tasted GREAT!

I would give this recipe 6 starts if I could.  My 12 year old son made the lemon blueberry scones for me for Mother's Day and these were the best scones I have ever had!  Not too heavy.  Just the right texture.  He didn't use the food processor and personally I probably wouldn't either since it might make them a little tougher??  Just my opinion.

I like this recipe. Don't agree with others that you need food processor - not at all. Easy to use just your hands, first - when mixing flour with butter and then making the dough. First time I put my scones on the lower rack but they got burned on the b?ttom very fast. Second time I put it in the middle, this time they turned out great! I baked them for about 22 minutes  though...

These turned out amaaaaaazing.  I followed the recipe exact the first time.  The second time, I did the blueberry/lemon version and they were a hit!  I got many requests for the recipe and was told that they were better than bakery or starbucks scones!  I continue to get requests to make more of them.

yummy!

So these are wonderful, have made them twice in two days, and plan on making more for my daughters Irish Dance class tomorow morn. They were a hit at Wednesday nights class, even the teacher, 100% Irish loved them... Even the first batch I forgot the baking powder and they still were wonderdul... Making the Cherry Almond for tomorrow... YUM Way to good...



UPDATE August 1, 2012...
Our Irish Dance teacher request these most weeks, with different things in them, he loves them. I dont' mind making them at all, and I still grate the frozen bar of butter, much easier and it's fabulous... I've made, Cranberry White Choco chip, Cherry Choco Chip, Blueberry Lemon, Orange Cranberry, Cherry Almond, and thinking of trying the savory kind soon... Thanks again for a wonderful recipe!!!

I made these scones using my cusinart. They are quick and soooooooo easy.  Raves from my husband who can't get enough of them.  I use this as my base recipe and add whatever he is in the mood for.  Pineapple, blueberries, apples, etc.
I make two batches at a time and freeze. 
Tea and scones, can it get any better than that?

I felt these scones were very good.  I made the  cranberry/orange option and drizzled orange flavored glaze over the top of each scone once they had cooled.  I plan to try other flavors to create a tropical scone...coconut, almond, citrus, etc.  Update 7/20/19: Today I made lemon poppy seed with a lemon icing drizzle.  Very good!

Delicious and easy!  You definitely DO NOT need all of the egg/milk mixture, just add until dough is a good consistency to knead.  Also, I slit the dough in half and made a total of 16 wedges.  If you only make 8 they are huge wedges!

These were pretty good. I found them to be better the  next day. I will definitely make them again and try other flavor combinations.

Very tasty scones!  Followed the recipe exactly as written and was very happy with the result.  These scones are a little more "cake-like" and I prefer a little crunchier.  Don't know what I could do to make them crunchier but I am happy with these until I figure it out.  Made blueberry and choc chip.

Oh my Scone!!!!  These are so very simple but amazingly delicious!  I used dried cherries and 1/2 t vanilla extract, but everything else I did exactly as the recipe said.  Grating the butter was simple.  These are a keeper!

I cut all the ingredients in half (yes, I used half of an egg. It is possible) and ended up with 6 medium size  scones. To my first batch I added lemon zest (the zest of an entire lemon), and to a second batch I made I added apricots and pecans. I topped both with a drizzle of sugar glaze. I used milk and confectioners sugar or lemon juice and confectioners sugar. I made both batches in my food processor and they were a breeze.

A great scone recipe! Would have been even more perfect with some clotted cream. What I love about it apart from the taste and texture are the tips that are included in the directions so you don't mess it up. I'm accustomed to making scones but I wanted to try a new recipe (so rubbing in butter wasn't a biggie for me) so I stuck to the the stated ingredients (except the unsalted butter). Now that I know it comes out so great I'll try some variations on it.

Some people I know go crazy once I make these! When I made the cranberry orange version, I found that it didn't have enough orange flavor and the orange skins were too chunky. What I did the second time was put a splash of orange juice (I usually use milk because sometimes the batter is dry) and very finely shredded the orange skins. This recipe goes great with any type of jam!

I never made scones before but you would never know it.  This recipe made me seem like a seasoned baker. I received compliments all day long at work.  These are so easy and delicious!  The recipe is perfect as it is listed. I am used to making my Irish Soda bread working the ingredients with my hands so it is not an issue .  If a food processor is easier for you - that works too.  Whatever you do, don't be afraid to experiment with your additions.  I made separate batches of Chocolate Chip, Cranberry (Craisins) and Blueberry (I froze them first before adding to the mix) - all came out perfect.  THANK YOU  for this recipe - it is a KEEPER!

Awesome!  This is the most moist scone I have ever made.  I didn't like mixing it with a sore wrist.  Love the thought of grating the butter though.  I used salted butter, added grated orange zest, a teaspoon of orange juice concentrate.  I added one teaspoon of milk because I thought it was a bit too dry.  Recipe came out lovely!  A must make.  Love it!

The BEST scones I've ever tasted and worked GREAT in a food processor. I chose to sub dried cranberries for the raisins and add 2 TB grated lemon zest. YUM!! These were gone before they had a chance to cool! Also, for those out there aiming for whole foods, I subbed spelt flour for the full 2 cups of all-purpose and sucanat  for the sugar and was VERY PLEASED. You honestly couldn't tell! (apart from the dough being darker in color) Still VERY moist and just as delicious as any bakery scone!

Super easy recipe.  I took a previous reviewer's advice and substituted whole wheat flour and flax seed meal for the flour in the recipe, and I also made the cranberry/orange variation using my food processor.  These came out great!  I couldn't wait for them to cool when they were done.  I essentially grabbed one straight from the pan, and I was not disappointed.

Tried these for the first time today and they came out wonderful!  My friend said they are better than Starbucks :)  I used craisins, brushed the top with milk and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over the top.  They took longer to bake but I think that was because I made them thicker.  I loved the idea of shredding the butter, I will use that for many more recipes!  I didn't read the reviews until after they were in the oven, using a food processor does seem like an easier softer way!  Very happy with this recipe and can already see many ways to make it my own.

These are amazing. Unlike other reviewers, I preferred not to use a food processor. It was no problem to hand-grate the frozen butter into the flour and the scones were so wonderful. My hubby can not get enough of them. I made them with raisins, but think orange/cranberry would be wonderful; so they will be next :)

These turned out great! Very simple to construct. I beat the egg in the 1 cup measure then filled it up with heavy cream and milk and just a scoop of Greek yoghurt. 
I made half the batter with orange essence and dried cranberries and the other half with chopped apple and a ton of cinnamon.
After 13 minutes they were perfect
Both turned out fantastic! 5 stars well deserved

These are the flakiest scones I have ever baked or eaten (and I am a pretty accomplished baker).  I did not have sour cream on hand, but always have Greek yogurt so that was only substitution and it obviously had no adverse affect.  I also made a cream glaze with a little extra yogurt and some milk and brushed the top of the scones with it before sprinkling with sugar. I used Demerara sugar (for sprinkling only) since it has a prettier, big granule look.  My husband is used to eating good food and knows I am constantly trying new recipes, but he made a point of telling me I had to keep this one and write down everything I did so I could make them exactly the same again - he's so cute!

This is the easiest recipes for scones!! I did make my own swaps to make a healthier version: I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and Splenda brown sugar. For the butter you really don't have to grate it. I just cut up the frozen stick of butter into pieces and worked in the mixture with my fingers- less dishes to wash. This is a definite keeper of a recipe. Enjoy!!

I've made these scones at least a dozen times now, they are that good. The only difference I made in the recipe is that I don't freeze the butter instead I use chilled butter with the pastry cutter. I also like to add cranberries and pecans instead of raisins.

These were fabulous! Many thanks to the reviewers who gave the food processor suggestions. These were super easy using it. I made them with 1/4 cup pomegranate infused craisins (my favorite) and 1/4 cup white chocolate chips. Fabulous! I will increase the craisins back up to 1/2 for the next time. I also look forward to trying the variations I read about here. The possibilities are endless!!

I baked them in a silicone mini scone pan for 15 minutes in a convection oven set at 375 and they were perfect.

Followed it exactly and they turned out perfectly.  Made both the cherry almond and plain varieties.  A keeper for sure!

Amazing, delicious, addictive, so many add-ins to try. First was cranberries with sliced almonds, not extract. I subbed 1/2 cup plain yogurt for the sour cream with success. Pulsing dry ingredients in food processor is so simple and effective, it should be part of the recipe. For me these need no frosting, no butter, just excellent by themselves.

These were AWESOME, first time I have ever made scones, and they came out PERFECT. Simple, delicious recipe.  I added 3/4 cup dried sweetened cranberries (from fresh market, they are like jewels of honey in your mouth) and 1 cup of roasted chopped almonds. I also added 1 teaspoon ALMOND extract. After baked, I made a simple glaze to zigzag across. Confections sugar, cream, and almond extract. This recipe will fool others into thinking that you have been doing this forever! ALSO, I did not use a food processor, and I have a great one, turned out fine, less mess too.

This is the best (most delicious and versatile) recipe for scones!  I added huckleberries and grated orange rind.  YUMMM-O!!!  The recipe needs no tweaking, alterations or modifications in any way.  PERFECT as is!

very moist recipe!  I used salted butter and a food processor as others suggested and it was much easier that mixing the dough by hand.  I also added the zest of a clementine orange and 1/2 cup cranberries.  Then I squeezed the juice or the orange and mixed it with 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar to form a glaze; and I dipped the warm scones in the glaze.  Very yummy!

Followed Caljane's instructions about using food processor, and it worked fabulous. Truly is a simple and easy way to make light scones. Used Raisinets so got both of best worlds -- raisins and chocolate. Yum!

Awesome easy recipe (as long as you are using a food processor).  I use orange essential oil to give it an orange flavor.  Just add three drops to the eggs sour cream mixture before adding.

This recipe was really easy and delicious!!! It would have been easier if I had a food processor, but even so, it did not take that long...

I made a double batch and then split it into four bowls before adding the wet ingredients so I could add different kinds of mix-ins. I made a cheesy batch, a shredded coconut and almond, a chocolate chip, and a lemon batch. They are all tasty and I will definitely use this recipe again! Thank you! :)

Super easy and delicious!  My 3 year old even pitched in.  I used Fat Free sour cream and it still came out wonderful.  My daughter choose the "secret ingredient" of chocolate chips and we put it in a Demarle Teddy bear Flexipan and they turned out so adorable and pleasing to my toddlers.  Great recipe!

I made these scones on a sleepover with my friend twice. We loved them, they were amazing! 
We made some changes and they still came out great. First of all, we did not grate the butter and we didn't use frozen butter...that's just ridiculous. Then we substitued chocolate chips for currants! Yum! :)

Absolutely delicious!  I made these this morning and my husband, my kids and I all enjoyed them.  My 5 year old said they tasted better than the scones from Panera...and I agree!  I made them as directed, and it only took a couple of minutes to assemble.  I added orange zest (omitted the raisins) and made a glaze of powdered sugar and fresh orange juice.  Delicious!!!

This is my favorite recipe for scones. I always have to make two batches. One with blueberries for my non chocolate eating son, and the other with chocolate chips for the rest of the family. After every else eats all of the chocolate chip scones, they finish off the blueberry scones. In my opinion, these are better than Starbucks or any store prepared scones. I've also made these with dried cranberries and a tsp of orange zest. The results aren't about what I've added, but that the basic recipe is so customizable that even without the extra flavoring, they would taste great.

Made this today with fresh strawberries and lemon zest.  I sliced the strawberries and pressed them on paper towels between two plates with weight on them.  This way they didn't make the dought to sticky.  Glazed them with a lemon glaze!  Yum!

All I can say is: WOW!  I've had this recipe saved for YEARS but finally got around to trying it today.  I made the 'blueberry/lemon' variation (adding fresh blueberries at the end instead of dried) and I followed other reviewers suggestions and threw everything into a food processor (I used frozen butter) and it was perfect.  I'm glad I read in another review that "sticky is an understatement!" because I was afraid I didn't use enough flour, but once I managed to get them on the pan they came out PERFECT.  I just finished eating my second... and might go back for a third!  Thanks for sharing!

The best scone reciepe I have found yet! I made them with a butter cutter and one bowl. I also used plain yogurt because I didn't have sour cream on hand. I also chilled them once they were on the pan for 10 mins. before putting them in the pre-heated oven. Tender yet flaky!

I made these for our Mommies Group's big Tea party, and they were a huge hit!!  I also used my food processor to make it simple, and the whole recipe took all of 15 minutes to make.  I was a little worried that the dough was too sticky when I turned it out, but they turned out really well.  I used a little more than 1/2 c craisins, and zest of about 1/2 of a big navel orange.  I also added about a tsp ground cinnamon and a splash of vanilla.  I cut them into 16 triangles, sprinkled with sugar and voila!

These scones are delicious! Made these today with vanilla yougurt instead of sour cream.  Did not have frozen butter to grate so just diced up cold butter real small.  Formed into a disc, cut into 8 triangles and baked in scone pan.  Will definitely make these again!!!

I still can't believe how good these turned out. I got off work at 2:30am and raced home to bake these scones & watch the Royal Wedding :) I was eating one fresh out of the oven in around 40 minutes. Thanks to other reviewers for the food processor tip - it was SO SIMPLE. I never made scones before - usually my go-to is muffins. It's now scones!! I did the cranberry-orange variation, I zested a whole orange right in the bowl, not sure if it was the 1 tsp the recipe called for. I only froze my butter for about 5 minutes, and I used fat free sour cream. I can't wait to try all the other variations; someone else mentioned making ham-green onion-cheese kind, I'm very excited to try those next!!!

A wonderful tender, light tasty scone.  I have not always had luck with scones as they sometimes come out tough but these were great. I did them in my kitchen-aid stand mixer with the dough hook and I think grating the butter in frozen is the key!

I just finished making these scones, and they were fabulous! I made them plain (without any raisins or other optional ingredients) and they were still lovely. I'm unsure why people are pulling out their food processors for this; I just used my pastry cutter and refrigerated butter (not frozen). I look forward to seeing how these taste tomorrow when they aren't straight from the oven!

These were wonderful.  I have now made them with either blueberries or dried cherry/walnut.  Both were great.  Next I will try dried apricot.  This is now a family favorite.

Fantastic recipe and very easy.  I used an extra large egg instead and one half cup sugar instead of a third the second time I made them as I like them a bit sweeter.   Always a big hit at a brunch.

WOW...I didn't think making tasteful scones could be so simple!  Thank you for an awesome recipe.  I've made several batches and have used different ingredients.  I've made blueberry scones, white chocolate and pecan, orange/cranberry, raspberry/white chocolate, pumpkin/cinnamon and they are all great!

These were by far the best scones I've ever made.  Got rave reviews from the folks I made them for.  I'll be using this recipe from now on.  I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I used Greek yogurt.  I made the cherry almond variation, sprinkled them with sliced almonds along with the sugar.  They almost looked too good to eat.

Easy to make, with or without a food processor! I don't have one, but I just blended the dry ingredients, then cut in the butter with a fork (microwaved just a few seconds, still firm, but not fridge-cold), and added in the rest. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. They're just coming out of the oven now, and are perfect! Thank you!

Amazing and easy to make! These were so yummy and after reading the recipe, I was shocked at how easy they were to make! I used salted butter ( only because I didn't have unsalted) and still loved them! It's the first time I've ever attempted scones and I am so happy I came across this recipe! So so so good! Thank you for posting this recipe - absolutely wonderful! :) A new family favorite!

This is an excellent recipe!  I followed as written and was quite pleased.  I've used dried cranberries and will try a lemon-blueberry combination on the next try.  One thing that really stood out is how little sugar is needed, and yet the scones have a hint of sweetness.  This is a wonderful alternative to muffins and quick bread recipes that call for lots of sugar.

Possibly the best scones recipe I've ever tried. I substituted the sour cream with 0% fat greek yogurt and added a tsp of water to the mix. I have a pastry cutter so I just cut the butter into the flour before adding the sugar then used my hands for the rest of the recipe. I didn't add any raisins as I don't really care for them. I like my scones plain.

Just baked up my third batch of these babies.  LOVE this recipe.  I don't have a food processor, and did just fine without one. My second batch I didn't freeze the butter and found the scones didn't keep their shape as nicely as the others, they relaxed a bit and looked more like I just dropped them on the sheet instead of cutting them like I did.  The lemon zest is a great addition!

very easy recipe. i dont like rasins so i substituted crasins instead. the only thing is that it was a little hard for me to get it into a ball when pressing to the sides of the bowl due to being too crumby. so i just added a smidge more sour cream to get it to bind. overall this was very easy and tasty.

I made these a few days in advance of a brunch I was hosting. I baked them on a Thursday and put them in the freezer till Sat. night and served them on Sun. They were so easy and delicious! I made 2 batches. For both I used the food processor to mix the butter and dry ingredients. (cut the butter into small chunks rather than grate it.) For one batch, I mixed the liquids in with my hands and the other batch, I used the food processor to mix the liquids. The food processor was slick! Next time I won't bother getting my hands sticky. It mixed in seconds! I added the craisins after I used the food processor. I didn't want to chop it into bits. I can't wait to make these again!

this recipe is awesome!  i never make scones or biscuits in the food processor (makes for tough dough), so the butter grating method is ideal for me.  i love a good cranberry orange scone, so i use 2 t. of fresh orange zest, and 3/4 cup fresh cranberries (chopped).  i add the zest & fruit at the end when i stick my hands in the dough.  i like my scones to be free form, so i barely mix in the fruit and form each scone by hand, barely pressing each one into a slight triangle shape before placing on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  i bump up the temp. to 410 and bake for the full amount of time.  i like my scones crispy on the outside and soft and tender in the middle.  these alterations give me the perfect scone, every time!

Really good, and actually pretty easy without the food processor like so many of the top comments suggest. I used dried cranberries and they were delicious. I'll definitely be making these again for my family.

Really delicious!  Made the following changes: Used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  A little more liquid is needed if whole wheat is used, so I added 2T of additional milk.  Heated the milk slightly and stirred in 2tsps of instant coffee, and let that cool.   Used 1/2 cup Greek style yogurt instead of sour cream.  I added the 2T of milk (with coffee added) to the Greek yogurt/egg mixture.   Also added chocolate chips (2/3C) to the flour.   After cooling, I melted additional chocolate chips and drizzled the scones with that.  Definitely I would make this recipe again and again!!!  Such a versatile recipe:)  I'll make this next time used dried apricots with sliced almonds.

These were great and very easy to make. You can make them EASILY without a food processor and it's not that difficult. Anyone with little pastry expereince knows how to work butter into flour. Simply bring the butter to room temp before mixing in and you should have no problems I added 1 tsp of vanilla.
UPDATE: My favorite is lemon zest and blueberry but this morning I used 1 cup of Chobani Greek Yogurt cause I ran out of sour cream and it made the scones MUCH more moist and not as dry. Also the perfect time for me is 13 minutes on 375

Great recipe for a first timer.  We added orange extract and mini choco chips and loved it.  Do it in the food processor for sure.  We were ready to bake them in 10 minutes.

I heart these scones!!!  The sour cream makes them more moist than typical scones (which both my husband and I love).  Key is to not work the dough too much, or it loses that nice crumb when baked.  Every time I make these, we share with the neighbors, who absolutely adore them, too!  I find they don't taste very good the next day (they get soggy really fast), but since they don't usually even have a chance to cool, I still give them 4 stars!    I made a mistake with one batch:  do not use fresh fruit mix-ins.  I tried frozen blueberries, and I had a sticky mess of dough that didn't bake up right.  Only use dried fruit!

I am feeling like a genius! Even though others had suggested using a food processor, I did things by hand. Today, I used their suggestion and used my food processor! Talk about simple!! But I went one step further, and used a dinner plate the size of the round I was going to make. I floured it and had an idea of how large to pat the dough ball. And cleanup was as easy as sticking the plate and my food processor parts in the dishwasher! LOVE this recipe!

I love this recipe--it's easy and the scones are delicious! You can make up the dough & put it in the fridge, then cut and cook them in the morning, so they are hot & fresh! I like to make small triangles b/c it makes more. I usually use dried cherries & white chocolate chips...but have also used dried blue berries & white chocolate chips AND mint chips (Andes Candies) around the holidays! I think I sprinkle more sugar on top too!

Fave scone recipe EVER! So easy to alter! Chocolate chip and orange peel my all time favorite. Lemon peel and blueberry. Cranberry vanilla. And on and on and on... some sprinkled with sugar before baking, others drizzled with vanilla bean icing after baking! SOOO fun!

Excellent recipe. I added one cup of dried cherries instead of the raisins and brushed the tops with half and half before baking. Perfect scones. I like extra dried fruit in scones but these would be delicious just as recipe is given. Thank you for this recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I made the craisin/orange variety and used the food processor method. I like smaller scones so I cut it into 16 small wedges, and they came out just perfect. Using the food processor they are every bit as easy as any other breakfast biscuit or muffin! Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe to work off of! I wanted to make this as a snack but needed it to be healthier so I substituted 1/4 cup ground flax seeds for 1/4 cup of flour and used whole wheat flour for the rest (note- if you substitute flax seeds, increase yeast by 1/4 and decrease fat by 1/4). Came out wonderful and they were really easy to make. Will definitely make again.

Great and easy to make. I love that this recipe uses sour cream which I usually have on hand versus some of the others that use heavy cream! I would love to try the variations but I just made the basic and it was perfect! :) Definitely will make these again! :) Oh, and I didn't grate the butter because I didn't have any frozen so I just put it in with the flour mixture and chopped at it with my knife and they came out fine. If I had a pastry cutter I'd have used that but I don't...

These are delicious!  And I'm not usually a scone lover. I made a cranberry almond version with a lemon glaze (just what I had on hand)......I put all the dry ingredients into a food processor and gave it a whirl. Then pulsed in very cold, cubed butter until they were pea-sized in the flour.  Poured the flour mixture into a large bowl and gently mixed in 1/4 cup of sliced almonds and 1/2 cup cranberries to coat.  In a separate small bowl, mixed the sour cream, egg, and zest of half a lemon.  Mixed the wet with dry ingredients until JUST combined....The dough was VERY wet and crumbly.  Rather than rolling it out, I dropped ten 2-inch rough rounds onto parchment paper.  Brushed the tops with a little milk and sprinkled with sugar. Baked at 400F for 17 mins. When cooled, drizzled each scone with lemon glaze (1 cup confectioners sugar + 1 to 1.5 tbsp lemon juice).....These will be a staple in our house! Look no further for a scone recipe, this is it.

I used frozen blueberries, whole wheat flour, and a tub of Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I also used Earth Balance instead of butter.  I was a little uncertain how these would turn out with all the substitutions, but they were delicious!

I made them in the food processor, but since I was adding fresh blueberries, I took the dough out and stirred them in by hand.  I used maybe a tablespoon less sugar and used brown sugar instead.  I also used a little over half whole wheat flour and a couple tablespoons of flax seed.  Next time, I'll use all whole wheat flour.  They were excellent!

These were so easy to make and absolutely delicious! As per another reviewer's suggestion, I didn't freeze the butter before grating it; using the large holes on my box grater quickly resulted in a pile of long, narrow strips of butter on top of the dry ingredients. I then put the whole bowl in the freezer for about 30 minutes to harden the strips of butter, and when  I mixed them in with my fingers, the butter easily broke up into perfect-sized pieces. Because they're in season now, I substituted fresh blueberries for the raisins and added 1 tsp of vanilla to the sour cream-egg mixture. I was nervous about baking the scones on the lower middle rack because I was afraid the bottoms would burn with the rest underdone, but I followed the cooking directions as given and they came out absolutely perfect!! I will definitely make  again!

These are great!  A few tips: Put the dry ingredients in a food processor.  Take cold butter from the fridge and cut it up.  Add the butter to the dry ingredients. Place food processor bowl into freezer for about 30-60 minutes.  Remove from freezer and pulse together until crumbly.  Follow the recipe from there.

So good!  I clipped this recipe from a magazine years ago & finally made it tonight!  I made the cranberry-orange version & they are incredible!  I only had salted, sweet cream butter so I omitted the salt in the recipe & increased the sugar to 1/2c.  I also used fat-free sour cream, 3/4c cranberries, brushed the top with beaten egg & sprinkled it with raw sugar.  I got 12 scones out of this recipe.  Tender, sweet, cranberry goodness!

This recipe worked out quite well.  Only thing I decided to change was use less sugar (3 tblspn) and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  Turned out spectacular.  Also decided top used dehydrated strawberries instead of the raisins.  Simple easy recipe that I will continue to use/make.

I've always used light sour cream with no problems.  Delicious!  Also, be sure to use dried fruit.  Fresh blueberries make the dough too sticky.  : (

Much easier if you DO NOT pre-cut scones and bake dough uncut and cut after cooked and cooled. Much easier to handle this way.

My husband actually admitted he was wrong when trying these scones.  He loves scones and when they came out of the oven he said...those are too dry. He picked a little corner of one and said...yup those are too dry.  But I gave him one anyway to have with his coffee at work (I didn't want to waste them). When he gets home he says "honey...I have to apologize.  That was one of the best scones I ever had. Moist and delicious. When are you making them again???"  I used craisins instead of raisins and since I didn't have unsalted butter I used regular butter but eliminated the salt.  They really did come out yummy.  Very easy to make and extra delicious.  Thank you for a wonderfully simple recipe.   I can't wait to experiment with other flavors.

These were delicious!  I made them by hand as the recipe suggested and did not think they were difficult to work with at all.  I don't think dirtying up the food processor is worth it, it's very easy to work by hand and it reminds me of my grandmother baking before all the fancy gadgets were around.  I replaced the sour cream with Greek yogurt and I used 1/2 white chocolate chips and 1/2 semisweet chunks.  I also used a pizza cutter to cut the scones out.  I dipped the pizza cutter in water and stuck it in my sugar bowl and it worked beautifully.  I love this recipe and will make it again and again - I can't wait to try other goodies in the scones! Update :  I made another batch using butterscotch chips - my favorite so far!

I made these before my friend came over for coffee and she said that they tasted better than Starbucks scones. I made two kinds (split the dough in half): blueberry cinnamon and the other kind which was the best and disappeared the quickest: milk chocolate chip and white chocolate chip with a simple icing of powdered sugar and a little milk drizzled on. Easy to make, makes plenty, don't overmix.

I made this today for the first time - they were amazing!  I had salted butter, so omitted the salt in the recipe and used the recipe for the lemon blueberry. The texture was moist, a little crumbly and they were the best scones I have ever had. Looking forward to experimenting with huckleberries and craisins for the next batch!  Thank you so much!

5 stars for incredibly easy and straight-forward instructions. Perfect crumb... perfect amount of sweetness... flaky, buttery... I enjoyed this with orange zest and chopped white chocolate. In hindsight, I would've added more zest and possible a squirt of vanilla, but these will certainly go fast at work tomorrow! I brushed the tops with buttermilk and sprinkled with turbinado sugar (the milk helps the sugars stick). No need for a glaze or drizzle at all! Can't wait to make again!

So I used to work in this lil' Italian bakery just outside NYC and this guy's scones were to die for. I decided to try this recipe after reviewing a lot of scone recipes and reading complaints about sticky dough, not sweet enough, etc etc.  First off, this recipe is the basis for ANY great scone combination you can think of. I substituted the sour cream for strawberry yogurt (since I didn't have sour cream, or plain yogurt on hand. I omitted raisins and used about 3/4 cups of frozen cranberries instead, adding some ornage zest. After baking, I mixed 2 tbsp of icing sugar w/ 1 tbsp of orange juice, and lightly glazed the scones while hot! Ooh la la !!!

The most ingenius part of this recipe is the grating of the butter-- it yields a super-delicate scone since it all-but-eliminates the possibility of over-working the dough while trying to get those blasted bits of butter to resemble "coarse meal"!  Oh, and I only stuck my butter in the freezer while prepping the other ingredients, and it grated beautifully.  Definitely a keeper!

Wow. really good. Changed it a bit. I used whole wheat flour and added 2 tablspoons of lemon juice. Made a nice flavor. Smother it with stawberry jam and you will have a real treat!

Excellent!  I made some modifications.  I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup of wheat flour.  I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup (more than that would make it too sweet).  I didn't use frozen butter, I sliced up a stick of refrigerated margarine.  I did 1/4 cup raisins, and 1/4 cup craisins.  I didn't realize that I didn't have sour cream, so I used low-fat rasberry yogurt.  Next time I might use all wheat flour (no white).  I'm not sure why people are using a food processor.  Mixing the flour mixture with my hands took at most 45 seconds.  Mixing the egg mixture into the flour mixture with a fork took at most 30 seconds.  It would take a lot longer to set up the food processor and then have to clean it.  Maybe using frozen butter makes it harder to mix.  So use refrigerated margarine and don't use the food processor.  Also, with refrigerated margarine you don't have to use a box grater.  That way you don't have to clean the box grater.  (You can probably tell I try to minimize clean up).

This is a fairly simple recipe and tastes so good.  I've made it several times and made flavor adjustments each time.  I've added almond extract, orange zest, a layer of lemon curd, ginger and chocolate chips.  It's a crowd pleaser every time I've made it.  A little trick I've learned for getting the butter done quickly is to use a cheese grater on softened butter then freeze the butter overnight.  It makes them come together very quickly in the morning.

I literally JUST made an account on this site so I can review this recipe! This is my first time ever making scones and the simplicity and deliciousness of these scones warrants a rave review from me.  I didn't have a grater to grate the frozen butter so I just cut them up into tiny pieces, threw them into the flour mix and combined by hand. I also added dried blueberries (instead of raisins) into the mix.  The dough was a lot drier than I expected, which made it harder to shape and transfer onto a pan. I was really worried about how this was going to turn out because it did NOT look pretty going into the oven.  Final Product: DELICIOUS! Soft in the inside and a little crunchier on the outside, exactly what I LOVE about scones! My boyfriend and dad raved about them. I definitely did not expect so many praises on my FIRST batch of scones ever. This was a very simple recipe to follow, seriously almost fool-proof. Don't worry about it not "looking right" before you put it in the oven, it will turn out great!

Have made so many times for years and never rated it.  Best and easiest scone recipe!  Very easy to make different variations.  Everyone loves them and can't believe I make them!  Say they are better than the ones they've had at coffee shops.  Thank you!

These are excellent! Light, flaky and just delicious. I didn't put raisins in, just left them plain and did an egg, milk and salt wash before baking them. They go delicious with tea!

I am not a baker.  In fact I can easily say I'm horrible at it.  These scones seemed so simple I thought what can go wrong?  To my surprise they turned out great!  They were slightly sweet, not too dry.  Just perfect with a cup of coffee or tea.  My husband loved them as well.  I'm so excited that I finally have a recipe for a baked good that works!  PS Despite the fact that I did not use a food processor these were super easy and super quick.

I prepared mine in the food processor, it was easy and quick.  I did the orange cranberry variation. I did an egg wash, and on some I drizzled some icing that I prepared with powdered sugar and freshly squeezed orange juice. Fabulous, this one will replace my old recipe.

My goodness these scones were light and delicious! (I added the zest of 1 orange and dried cherries to the dry mixture before adding the butter, yum!) I brushed the tops with cream and sprinkled with sugar-oh my! Shiny and pretty! Thank you!

LOVE these scones - these are way better than anything I can buy from any coffee shop or grocery store. Great mix of sweetness, but not too cakey like so many store-bought scones are. This recipe is a staple in my kitchen - cranberry orange is one of my favorites, but blueberry is great, and so is lemon poppyseed. I usually make a large batch so I can grate the frozen butter using the grating blade in my food processor - then I either freeze the extra scones, or more often share them with coworkers or friends. They are always a bit hit.

Quick and easy to make. The only change I make is that I simply cut the butter into chunks and add it to the dry mixture rather than using a grater. Then I use my fingers to incorporate the two. Results are the same in the end. A versatile base recipe with some delicious variations. I've tried both the cranberry/orange and blueberry/lemon variations and they both turned out delicious.

My husband says these are the best he's ever had!  These are the first and only scones I have ever made.  Everyone loves them.  I have made them with currants, with semisweet chocolate chips and walnuts, and with dried red tart cherries and chocolate or nuts.  All are terrific! The only thing I do different is use vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.  Oh, and I also cook them on my preheated pizza stone.  I've tried cooking them other ways, but this is best in my opinion.  Occasionally the dough is too sticky, but it's easy to work in more flour until it's the right consistency.   I also love the tip for shredding the frozen butter.  It makes it so much easier to work into the flour, and I've used the tip with other recipes since.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Decided I wanted scones for breakfast this morning and this is the only one that I had all the ingredients for. They turned out great, and went together very easily.  I'm not a fan of raisins or currants in my scones so I modified the recipe slightly: - lightly chopped 1/4c of fresh blueberries - chopped up about 1/4c of white chocolate chips - added about 1/3c of flour (during kneading) to compensate for the blueberry juice - sprinkled the tops with turbinado sugar (so it was crunchier). - cooked them for about 25m since they were wetter  It makes for a sloppier dough, but get all of the ingredients in the original recipe assembled so you have your dough-ball, flatten it out, put the blueberries and chocloate on top, and fold it together a few times (this is where it gets messy).  During this step keep dusting the dough and the counter with the extra flour.  Keep lightly kneading the dough with the fresh flour until it's not sticky, then flatten and divide as described in the original recipe.  This works great with blueberries, as well as raspberries (frozen fruits are a lot wetter however, so you may need more flour)...not enough scone recipes out there with white chocolate.

Wonderful! I was in a rush, so I didn't have time to freeze and grate my butter. I did it the old fashioned way and cut it in with a pastry blender. They turned out perfectly! Some of the best I've ever tasted

Sorry, although these were very good, they are still not the best, and my quest goes on.  The best you can get are sold at a local gourmet shop near me in Kenmore, NY......if I could get the recipe, I would.  I have driven there just to get one.....9 miles away, they are that good and I usually get them plain.  However, they come to the shop parbaked and finished in the shop so no recipe. I did make these as many others did, using a food processor, & also used currants.  They were easy, & very good, but still not my favorite.....the local one's are like "butter, sugar, flour, dropped down from an English heaven" to me!  I may however, try to make these with cream or buttermilk instead of sour cream next time....maybe that's the difference in taste.

This was the first time I made scones from scratch and they came out great! They were not dry at all and even had sort of a creamy texture in the middle. I made Easy Devonsihire Cream (also on this website)to go with them and that was great, too. It only took about a half hour total to make them. While the scones were baking for 15 minutes, I made tea, carrot/orange juice in a juicer, the Easy Devonsire Cream, set the table and put on Dvorak. So in a half hour I had the perfect Saturday morning breakfast with my daughter.

I started baking scones just a few months ago, and have been on a quest to find the perfect recipe.  My quest has come to a delightfully happy conclusion with this recipe!  I've used this as a base for cranberry almond scones and lemon scones.  It's so versatile and easy - and the suggestion to freeze and grate the butter is pure genius! THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

Oh wow... these are great!  This was my first time making scones and I made the orange cranberry ones.  So easy and so good!  For the butter I couldn't grate, I chopped it finely.  The only thing I would recommend is to mix the orange rind into the egg/sour cream mixture first as it was hard to incorporate into the dough.  Will be making them again soon.

I made the following changes: used half whole wheat flour and half white, plain low fat yogourt instead on sour cream and I mixed in about 3/4 of a cup of raspberries and saskatoon berries that I had leftover in the freezer. I mixed everything in my food processor and I think it was a little to small for the whole batch, it pretty much pureed the berries into half of the batter so I took it out and kneaded it until the berries were mixed all the way through. I really liked how they turned out, a bit crusty on the outside and moist in the middle. I just realized that I put 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1/3, must have misread the recipe, I'll definitely make sure to correct that next time since these were pretty sweet.

In the past I have had some trouble getting scones to turn out.  This recipe made it very easy, even with a few alterations.  Instead of the raisins, I diced up an apple, and I decided to add 2 Tbsp. of marmalade.  These scones had perfect texture and outstanding taste.  Thank you so much for supplying a recipe which made scones easy and accessible.

This is an excellent recipe!  I used Smart Balance 50/50 butter blend in place of the butter and craisins in place of the raisins.  Also convection baked these and they took about 12-13 minutes.  Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipe.

I subbed 1/3 cup heavy cream for the sour cream (that's what I had in the fridge) and used cranberries instead of raisins. Also added zest grated from one orange. I glazed with 1/4 c powdered sugar and 1-2 t orange juice.

I have made this recipe no less than 30 times, and the results are perfecty every time!  I did however change the flavors to suit my family.  We use dried cranberries and orange extract, and sometimes a bit of orange rind to flavor them, as most in my family are not fans of raisins.  I have also changed out the cranberries for chocolate chips, which with the citrus flavor underneath is a nice and refreshing change!  If you need a classic and adjustable scone recipe...this is it!!!

These were delicious. I am not a big fan of raisins though so I substituted the raisins with chopped up white and milk chocolate. I melted the remaining chocolate and drizzled it on top of the scones when they were finished. Delicious!

These were sooooooo good and simple. Grating the butter is such a good idea. I didn't have to freeze it first though. Butter hardens more than margarine so it was already a perfect consistency. No prep work...YEAH! That also means I can make this whenever we want :-) I left out the raisins but will try adding dried blueberries.

I love making these scones because they are so easy and you can make so many variations of them. I like to put some Orange zest (i whole orange zested) and fresh cranberry's (about 1 cup dried or 1 1/2 fresh-fresh makes them moist)in mine then make a simple icing with a little orange extract in it to top them. (about 1 cup p.sugar and 1/4cup nonfat canned milk 1/2 tsp orange extract and mix till smooth.) SUPER yummy! I've also added a 12oz can of pumpkin to them and made a thicker icing to top those (powder sugar, canned nonfat milk and a little cream cheese about 3 oz and just keep adding sugar and milk until you get the consistancy you want)

These are insanely delicious!! This was the first time I've made scones and they taste better than the ones at Starbucks!  I added 2 palmfuls of dried cranberries and the zest of 1/2 a lemon. Instead of grating the butter, I cut it into small pieces. I added all the dry ingredients to my food processor then added the butter and pulsed a few times.  Then added the sour cream and egg mixture and pulsed a few more times until it formed a lumpy dough.  I added the cranberries after I removed the dough from the processor but I'm going to try pulsing them with the dry ingredients next time.

I used craisins instead of currants, and sprinkled in some vanilla - probably about 1 tsp. I also brushed the tops of the scones with an egg wash and then liberally topped them with raw sugar. I think it gives a much better crunch than white sugar. Thanks for a terrific base recipe! It's going to be lots of fun to play around with.

these turned out great!  i substituted 1 cup oat flour (for 1 cup all-purpose  flour), thick greek yogurt (instead of sour cream), 1 cup frozen berries (instead of raisins), and course raw sugar for the tops).  and i also used salted butter, because that was all i had, and they still were fab.

Super easy to make and turned out moist and yummy. I did use fat-free sour cream and substituted some of the butter with fat-free cream cheese. The first 2 batches I used 6T butter and 1oz ff cream cheese. They were perfect, so in the 3rd batch I used 4T butter and 2oz ff cream cheese. Moist and tasty! I will definitely do that substitution again next time.
I made the cranberry orange, the cherry almond (this could use a little more almond flavoring I think and I sprinkled the tops with slivered almonds) and I tried one batch with some cinnamon chips I had and chopped walnuts (these I sprinkled the tops with brown sugar). All 3 were very good!
This is a very versitile recipe and be made into any flavor. Thanks!

These were excellent - we ate them right out of the oven and they were moist! Like other reviewers I have found most scones to be dry and crumbly, but these were fantastic. I will make these again and again. I did not add raisins, because we don't like them in our breads, and I added a tablespoon or two of extra sour cream.

Very good recipe.  I changed it so I could use what I had in the house: I used 1 cup of wheat flour and 1 cup of self-rising, and added only 1/2 tsp baking powder, no soda, no salt, and then left the rest of the recipe unchanged.  If you use wheat flour, you should probably add a little more sweetener.

These scones came out really well.  I made a lemon-cranberry version with ~1 tsp lemon zest and 1/2c dried cranberries.  Other modifications: vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream, reduced sugar a bit (because of the yogurt), 5 tsp butter (salted) with 3 tsp vegetable oil (I ran out of butter), and finally half white whole wheat flour.  I think these are a lot healthier and the texture is still great.

these were indeed very good & very simple! i added 2 tsp. cinnamon for flavoring. however, my butter was only cold, not frozen & they turned out fantastic, so it's  a little unnecessary to freeze/grate your butter. great recipe!

Very good and very simple to make.  The only change I made was use yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I had.  I want to try use different flavor yogurt next time to see how it turns out.  I made two batches.  One plain cranberry and one cranberry lemon (made with True Lemon).  On one batch I cut and baked it and the other I baked without cutting them and cut afterward.  I think from now on I'll just bake it whole because it was less messy.  This is a great starter recipe that lends itself well to adding your own touches.  They are even better the next day.  Will make again.  Thank you so much.

Pretty simple recipe. This was my first attempt at making scones and I made sure to follow the recipe. I did combine the dry ingredients in my Kitchen Aid, then combined the wet and mixed it with my bread hook. Seemed to make the whole process less daunting for me. I added chopped apple and a cinnamon/nutmeg mixture to mine, which was apple-pie reminicent. I also sprinkled the cut dough with sugar crystals. Really good for a first try. My kids and I loved them and it really was no more work than putting together muffins or pancakes, for me.

I make this in small scone dimensions for my youth group Sunday School class and they are so excited when they see then scones!  The currants go over great and they are always delicious.  I now always keep frozen butter in half cup measure in my freezer for this recipe.  If you try it with almost frozen butter it melts all over the pan.  Frozen is best.  Cheese works great to but also melts around a bit. Use parchment paper for easy clean-up.

I made this for our mother's day tea party for our mom's group and it went over nicely.  I used apricots and orange glaze as one reviewer suggested.  I had prblems with the dough being overly sticky and had to add a touch of more flour.  In spite of my attempt the dough wsa still difficult to cut into triangles.  I patted them into cookie form and they turned out beautiful with glaze drizzled over them.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe always comes out great. I do add a capfull of vanilla extract to the sour cream mixture, and I add a heaping amount of sour cream. I hate dry scones. Other than that the recipe is just awesome, great with Devon cream and strawberry preserves. I have made versions with flaked coconut and slivered almonds and replaced used a bit of almond extract as well.  Yummy.

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. I've made scones before and they've turned out like bricks....not these! Melt-in-your mouth, and I even used lite sour cream! The only other change I made was to use craisins instead of raisins. Dee-licious!

I never thought it was possible to make a delicious scone, but now I do!  These are the best tasting scones I have ever had.  Very moist and a perfect complement to a cup of coffee or tea.  I have made these two times.  The first time, the only change I made was replacing the raisins with 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.  The second time I again used chocolate chips (at the request of my kids), used reduced fat sour cream, and added vanilla since I read several reviews where vanilla was added; but honestly, I didn't notice a difference in taste.  I don't have a food processor, so I grated a refrigerated cube of unsalted butter, and then placed the grated butter in the freezer until I needed it, and then mixed it by hand.  So easy to prepare and does not take long at all!  I will be making many more batches in the coming weeks, and hope to try other additions as other reviewers have suggested.

Just took these out of the oven and am very impressed. I have tried many recipes for scones using buttermilk, milk or heavy cream. This is by far the best recipe, came out light and airy. I never would have thought of sourcream. The only changes I made was 1 tsp. vanilla extract and used cookie cutter. Don't twist or else will bake lopsided; make sure that cutter is dipped in flour before cutting dough to prevent from sticking. Great base recipe, a keeper, just add whatever flavorings you prefer.

I didn't have enough sour cream so I replaced it with 1/4 c 2% milk.  It might have affected the texture of my scones but if it did I sure didn't notice.  I used 1/2 c mini chocolate chips and 1/4 chopped walnuts and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  So yummy, I totally plan on making them again and again.

Excellent recipe! I tried hard to mess it up (started grating butter on the small holes. forgot to cut into pieces, so I had to over work the dough a bit) and they still came out delightful!  Family loves them.  My only issue is the high fat content, but it's an extra special treat! Tip - Use raw (natural) sugar for the topping. Has a larger grain.

Made exactly as recipe stated (I chose raisins) They were surprisingly delicate & moist in the inside and wonderfully crisp on the outside. Loved the 'mechanics'/details of the recipe. Freezing & grating the butter was much easier than I thought it would be. And the dough was sticky but still very easy to work into a circle. Prep took only aobut 15 minutes and 17 minutes was perfect timing to lightly brown outside & inside was done. Can't wait to try different flavors (esp. cinnamon)with this great base recipe!

I make these scones almost every Saturday morning. I've tried several variations - my family's favorite is lemon. You just leave out the raisins and stir in the zest of one lemon. You end up with perfect light lemon flavor. YUM!

The best scones!  I have made all the varieties.  The cherry almond ones are my absolute favorite!  I try not to make them too often because I would eat them all!  I always have to make a batch of blueberry ones for my sister when she comes as she  WAS addicted to the ones from starbucks!  I do sometimes do without the lemon and add blueberry syrup in place of the vanilla for just blueberry scones. It gives it a little tint of color too.  All in all my whole family and friends love these!

My family LOVES these! Especailly the cranberry/orange.  I mix the egg and sour cream together along with the zest. It mixes in easier to mix in and the zest is more evently distributed.

I am just joining the many people who have raved about this recipe.  I avoided making scones at home for a long time because I thought they would be difficult.  This was a very easy recipe to follow and they came out perfect!  I added at tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla and used dried cherries and white chocolate chips.  They are perfect!  I will totally make these again.

I made the cranberry orange variation, but with orange extract because I didn't have oranges for zest. Also I didn't freeze the butter, I used it out of the fridge and cut it in with a pastry blender. I used reduced fat sour cream and they taste great. I brushed the tops with a little milk to make the sugar stick. The texture is light and fluffy, not dry and hard like many scones I've had.

I wish there were an option for 6 stars.  This was excellant and exceeded my expectations.  I will definately make this again.  I agree with another that the hand mixing was more than I would like to dobut not that bad.  Try it...it is worth it!

This is a definite "wow" recipe. I made with my 10-year old daughter, following earlier suggestions to top with a glaze. We made the orange/cranberry version, but increased the grated orange rind to about 3 teaspoons. This gave the scone a strong orange flavor we enjoyed. To make rolling out easier, we sandwiched the dough between two sheets of waxed paper. Then we sprinkled our round pizza stone liberally with corn meal (as you would for pizza). I peeled one layer of the waxed paper, flipped onto the pizza stone, then peeled off the other layer of paper. I cut the triangles of the dough right on the stone and just gently pulled them apart. We soaked the dried cranberries in about 1/2 cup water while we prepared the dough, then pressed the cranberries into the top of the dough after we had rolled it out. Our butter was cold, not frozen, so we were able to easily and quickly blend with our pastry cutter. I'm looking forward to sneaking in some healthier ingredients, but the white flour version is great for a treat.

Wow what a nice scone! I had never made scones before but wanted to try as I had become addicted to a wonderful cinnamon scone served in Starbucks in Korea. Now that I am back in Canada I can't find them anywhere! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the dry mix and 1 tsp of vanilla to the wet. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar over top and wow were they yummy. I ate two fresh out of the oven. Next time I will add more spice for extra kick and brown sugar to get a little closer to what I remember. Still for anyone that wants a mild cinnamon scone try this modification.

This is a great base recipe to add all the fixin's you want! I made some with craisins and white chocolate chips, Nutella,chocolate chips w/oats, and Blueberry. Its moist and not to sweet. I found if you wrap the dough before baking its easier to work with. This recipe is great as is and needs no tweaking except to add those personal touches.  Some other ideas I had were to put pumpkin in and drizzle with some cream cheese glaze.

Amazing and easy.  For a twist, add the grated zest of a lemon and 1/2 cup blueberries (gently fold in when dough is done), 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cups white chocolate chunks, the possibilities are endless.  My Irish neighbors beg me to make them when they come down for weekends! I also make them into "Savory Cheddar Scones" by adding fresh chopped herbs from my garden (thyme, chives, basil...) and 1/2 cup cheddar cheese to replace the fruit.  Save a bit of the sour cream and egg mix to brush on the top and srpinkle with freshly shredded parmesan cheese.

These were great with a bit of cinnamon added. And instead of grating the butter in, I dropped frozen tablespoons of the butter into the flour mixture and pulsed it in my food processor. I also made a simple glaze of 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 tblsp. milk and 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon and drizzled the tops while still a little warm. :)

wow, these are really good and it seems so far that I can't mess them up!  I even tried them with all w.w.flour and they still turned out great ( I decreased the cooking time by a couple of mins. to keep from drying out) I also tried some with fresh blackberries which turned out to be a really sticky mess but they still came out delicious! (I learned to freeze fresh fruit first :) You just can't go wrong with these.

I had a craving for hot scones with butter and jam, so I whipped these up one rainy afternoon, and my sister and I shared them over cups of tea. Delicious! Also, they were extremely easy to make... took about 20 minutes prep time, 15 minutes bake time and we were eating them within the hour! Instead of making them triangular shaped, I took round cookie cutters and cut them into circles... looks very pretty and they can fit into the toaster once they get cold and need a heating up! One tip I do have is make sure you get them out of the oven in time: I left mine in a little too long... they were golden brown, but a little crispier than I like.

The scones turned out delicious.  My husband could not stop raving about them.  However, I would not call them simple, even with the food processor, and cleaning up the kitchen afterwards took a long time.  Next time I might make a double batch since it was too much work for only 8 scones.

These turned out just the way I hoped they would.  I used craisins, and they were wonderful.

Great Recipe! Helpful hints, if you have a salad shooter, it will shred the frozen butter and don't try this with most fresh or frozen fruit.

This is a great recipe for scones and not hard to make at all. My family and co-workers give it 5 stars!  Everyone loved them!

Fabulous!  I have not been able to find a scone that I like anywhere, until now.  I made a double batch of the cranberry orange last night and they are perfect!  They were simple to make, and came out just as a scone should-not too sweet, dense and a great flavor.  I can't wait to try the blueberry lemon.

WOW! This recipe is easy and made the best scones ever.  The final result looked professionally baked and tasted fantastic.  Light with just the right amount of sweetness and flavor. I added some crushed walnuts as well as currents. Delicious.  This recipe is a keeper!

Wonderful! I did tweak the recipe quite a bit. I replaced the all purpose flour with whole wheat and used Splenda, frozen mixed berries and 1/2 fat free sour cream & fat free vanilla yogurt. I did however keep the butter. I needed an idea of how to make scones as I had never had them, but had heard how wonderful they are. Great basic recipe to help a newbie scone maker. Thank you!!

These were good and easy! Just the way I like em. We topped them with the clotted cream recipe(that was much sweeter than it is supposed to be) and it was delish.

YUM!!!!!!!!  I used the dried cranberry / orange / white chocolate chip variation and they're AWESOME!!!!!!!!!  I made the whole recipe in the food processor (used salted butter and salt and they're still incredible!) and they came out great.  I used the pizza cutter and made 14 scones.  YUM-O!!!!!!!!  Thanks!  My husband's in heaven!!

These were fantastic!!  I have a major craving for scones this morning (pregnant) so I made these and I am so pleased.  So light and flaky without using too much butter or sugar.  I added the zest and juice of an orange (just a light squeeze for the juice, didn't want to add too much liquid!) I'm going to make these all the time and try different variations!

Very good base recipe. I added orange rind, few tablespoons organe juice and some white chocolate chips and vanilla extract. I did an egg wash on top with the sugar sprinkles. Came out perfect and tasty. I also used whole wheat pastry flour too. You can have fun with this one.

Great, fast, and easy!  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white.  I added cinnamon to the dry ingredients, a little more sugar than was called for, blueberries instead of raisins, and a little bit of vanilla to the sour cream/egg mix.  And I also sprinkled the top with natural cane sugar and divided into 12 scones instead of 8 (use a pizza cutter to cut them into triangles).

I added a little orange zest and some golden raisins to the flour mixture and a tablespoon of orange juice to the sour cream.  The scones were a perfect Sunday treat with coffee while reading the newspaper. A new staple recipe for my baking file.

Oh my gosh!! Thank you for this AWESOME recipe. I feel like a professional baker...they came out looking so pretty! I substituted 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and used evaporated cane juice instead of sugar. I also used nonfat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It has tons of protein. I made the orange cranberry variation. I will make these many more times....even as gifts.

Great recipe! however, i think i might have moved my oven rack too low, causing my scones to burn on the bottom. otherwise, the scones are delicious! Just be careful that the scones dont burn.

Everyone who has tried these has asked for the recipe, or for me to make them at the next gathering.  My mom loves them with cranberries and white chocolate, my daughter loves them with mini chocolate chips, and my son loves them with a little cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top!

Simply Devine!!!


Perfect and EASY recipe to make whenever that is devine on your taste buds and makes you very satisfied. 

I used craisins and 1/4 tsp of orange EXTRACT and this came out WONDERFUL. Paired with strawberry preserves and clotted cream, this is devine!


PS - don't forget to have a cup of tea!

I didn't like these and I thought it was because they weren't good, but it turns out I just don't like scones!! I served these at a party and all the people that like scones, loved these. My husband loved them too. And they really were simple to make.

Delicious! I used dates instead of currants & powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar. Mine took longer to bake - 22 mins.  I would definately make these again.

This was the first time I ever made scones, and the turned out perfectly. They were easy and delicious and received rave reviews from my husband and kids. Most coffee-shop scones are just too sweet, but these were just right. Will make again and again.

I love these scones.  I've tried to make a raspberry - white chocolate version, but they get a little too moist.  Still taste excellent, though.  I make these each week and split them into 6 - I get to have one then and one each morning before work!

I have been to England on several occasions and have never had a scone this good. Unlike traditional English scones, these are very moist and slightly sweet. We ate over half of them the first night they were made. Absolutely fantastic.

These were excellent.  Intead of freezing the butter, I chopped it into little cubes while cold with a good chefs knife, then worked it into the flour mixture by hand.  This worked well.  I prefer my scones a little sweeter, so next time I will use 1/2c., maybe more, of sugar.  Overall, great base to include whatever add-ins you like.  Thanks for the post.

In school, groups of students had to research countries and my group researched britian.  As a part of the presentation we had to cook a food from that country to give the class.  I had all the ingredients at home to make these which was so great.  I doubled the recipe which was not that much more work.  I did not use raisins because i thougt that would turn off some people in my class and they still turned out great!  I made them 2 days before I had to present because I was going to be busy but the whole class loved them anyway.  They were even cold.  I was so happy, I suggest this recipe for any time and anything!  

One note though, I put wax paper under the scones and I think it started to burn in the oven with the high temperature so I do not suggest that.

This is a regular in my house.  I mix the dry ingredients in a food processor, add cut up frozen butter until it is in pea-sized pieces or smaller, and then dump it out to be mixed with the rest of the ingredients.  Instead of raisins I use frozen wild blueberries (wild blueberries are smaller).  I freeze these before cooking on parchment paper and then move them to a tupperware once they're solid.  Then I pop them straight into the oven from the freezer with a little sugar on top.  They take closer to 25 minutes to cook from frozen.

I must admit I was quite sceptic to try out this recipe as I have never made scones before but the reviews I read encouraged me to go ahead and I am glad I did coz it was so easy and fantastic! As per someone's suggestion I opted for yoghurt instead of sour cream and it was good. Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  I added the 1/2 tsp. of almond flavoring along with 1/3 cup of dried cranberries and 1/3 cup of white chocolate chips.  Couldn't stop eating them, and they're good reheated too.

These were really good. I intentionally took them out a little earlier so they were a big cakier.

I made the recipe as is... came out light and airy, not too sweet, delicious!! I am a baker but this is my first attempt at scones. Will definitely make it again... perhaps on a variation.  Simple and lovely!

I have made these scones a couple times. (Making a few different types each time.) the first time I followed the directions exactly, only subbing out flavors. I made chocolate chip, blackberry vanilla, and blueberry. Everyone raved about them. The second time I made them I had to make some drastic substitutions. I was low on AP flour, so I used self rising instead. I did not add any baking powder or salt. When I went to knead and shape the dough, I used AP flour. I noticed no significant difference in the texture, or the amount the scones rose. I also didn't have sour cream, so I soured milk (1 cup milk/1 tbl lemon juice) and used that. It made the dough a bit wetter, but I made up for that by kneading in AP flour. They came out extremely moist the second time, I may continue to use soured milk in lieu of sour cream. For my flavors I made chocolate chip, cranberry orange with orange royal icing (craisins and orange extract, next time I want to add in orange zest also), maple pecan with maple royal icing, and strawberry lemon with lemon royal icing. I took them to my kids school and when I went to get my plates there were only crumbs and comments about how moist and delicious they were.

This is an amazing basic recipe. I used food processor and added all the dry ingredients, then grated in the butter, then the liquid ingredients. (addendum: I actually like to put the dried ingredients together the night before, and add the rest in the morning before baking.) I added 1 tsp orange zest and dried cranberries. I made a glaze with powdered sugar and orange juice and drizzled on the top. I did have to cook longer than the recipe states, (more like 25 minutes or so..) but they were perfect! Can't wait to experiment with more flavor.

I made the cranberry - orange  version following the recipe. I doubled the amount of butter. I sliced and julienned the frozen butter with a knife instead of grating it. I tried to mix the mixture by using a food processor but it was more of a headache, since the food processor 's bowl isn't big enough to hold the ingredients, and the dry flour got push through the gap between its lid and its bowl, so the big mixing bowl with little effort of elbow grease worked just fine. I made the dough the night before, cut and shaped it into heart shape pieces, arranged them in a parchment lined  baking tray, covered them loosely with saran wrap, then baked them in the morning. They tasted delicious. I've saved the recipe so I can make it again. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

OMG!!!  BEST SCONES EVER!!!  My husband is a scone junkie.  He loves them!  I decided to try and bake him up some for a surprise knowing that they will be a fail (he truly is a  'scone snob').  I made these on Thanksgiving morning.  He woke up as the raisin batch came out of the oven.  I offered him a hot scone.  He took one bit and simply said, and I quote here, 'these are the BEST scones..DO NOT LOSE THE RECIPE!!'.  I just about fainted.  After reading the other reviews here is what I did:  I melted the butter (I used regular salted butter) and added all the wet ingredients into my stand mixer.  Beat until well combined.  I sifted the dry ingredients, then added the dry ingredients to the mixing bowl and mixed to combine the wet and dry ingredients.  With the mixer on the lowest speed, I added the raisins and mixed to combine.  I did use parchment paper.  I also made the orange -cranberry.  I added 2 T of Gran Marnier to the wet ingredients.  He liked these even better then the raisin.  Both turned out beautiful and light and just delicious.  Better then store bought!  You can adjust this recipe to be savory also.  Such a versatile recipe!!!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!!!!

Love this recipe! I did make a couple changes. I used butter from the fridge, cut into cubes and worked it in the flour mixture with a pastry blender. I also used vanilla Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I have found that if you mix the ingredients and then knead them on the counter a few times,  like when making buscuits, before shaping and cutting the cooked texture is wonderful.  I also bake on an airbake cookie sheet for 25 minutes. After they cool I have glazed them with brown butter frosting or a spiced glaze.  Can't get enough of these!

I've made this twice in as many days first with raisins and today with some pomegranate I needed to use. Other than I use Greek yogurt vice sour cream and I add vanilla (1 tsp) to the egg mixture, this is a great simple and fast recipe. I don't bother with grating the butter, I just cut it in, works well for me. Hubster loves scones with his morning coffee, these go well with my afternoon tea too!

Just like everyone says... delicious! This was my first time making scones ... ever... I just followed the video and I'm very happy with the results. It's not that much labor intensive, especially when you are just baking for fun. I cut them round like a biscuit. I think it looks better and gives better portions.

I made pumpkin scones with this recipe by  adding 1/2 cup Libby's pumpkin pie canned filling, 3 tablespoons sour cream (instead of half a cup), 1/2 cup raisins and used fresh grated ginger. Came out as nice light scones. Husband gave thumbs up. Make sure you freeze the butter for ten minutes before grating it into your flour mixture. And I scooped the scone batter with an ice cream scooper onto the greased cookie sheet (more like you would with cookie dough cuz dough was kinda sticky and wet),then put  in the freezer for 30 minutes before cooking. Dough hardened. I pressed these balls down a bit more like a fat cookie. And voila! (Apparently freezing before baking, helps the scones rise more and improves lightness so I read somewhere else on line). Yummm. I'll make again. I think I'll double the cinnamon and nutmeg next time around too.

I made this twice this morning. First time I made it written as is, except for substituting dried cranberries for the raisins. They were excellent. They are fluffy and have a great texture. 

The second batch was made to be a savory scone. I omitted all sugar and raisins. I added 4 oz shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and 4 tablespoons diced green onion. These are also pretty darn amazing. They came up a little fluffier since there was no fruit to weigh down the batter.  I also used a food processor for this batch and agree with other reviewers it is a great way to go.

I doubled the recipe and added slivered almonds and orange essential oil. I also cut in the butter with my pastry cutter as opposed to grating it. It seemed like a much easier option. They are divine!! It did seem at first as though the dough was too dry, but as I worked it, it came together perfectly.

This recipe was perfect! I followed it exactly but added craisins & lemon zest for lemon berry scones. It was absolutely delicious! Also glazed it with lemon glaze by simply combining the juice of half of the lemon, 1 1/2 cup of powdered sugar & tsp of vanilla. We are definitely making this again. The recipe made 8 medium sized scones.

Delicious and simple.  I'm a novice cook and this was my first foray into baking.  My family loved them and they have become one of the most requested recipes I make.  I don't change anything (and have even made mistakes with the recipe before) and they always turn out perfect.  The lemon blueberry version is our favorite. :D

I bake my own bread, but my mom loves scones so I tried baking some for the first time for breakfast on Mother's Day. I made her favorite--orange cranberry. So very easy and quick to prepare. They were amazing! Great recipe!
P.S. I made the lemon blueberry about a month later for my mom's birthday. Everybody loved them!

Update:
So this is my go to recipe for scones now. I use my Cuisineart to make the dough and it works great and in half the time. So far I probably made them a dozen times. They are everyone's favorite. 
Original review:
These scones came out great! Crunchy outside and soft fluffy inside. Easy to make too! 
I did use my Kitchenaid mixer to mix dry ingredients and incorporate butter and then added egg with sourcream and mixed it with the fork. I will use a food processor next time as it will eliminate the need to grate butter by hand and cut prep time in half. After mixing the dough with fork, you will need to kneed it with your hand a bit to make sure all the flour got mixed with other ingredients and prevent pockets of flour inside your dough (but gently and not too long). I have tried at least five different scones recipes and these are definitely our favorite. Saving this recipe for future use and will try different flavors as suggested.

These scones are amazing! I am a novice baker and these were very easy and really surpassed my expectations.  I used the food processor like most other reviewers. I did not have yogourt or sour cream, so I used a 1/2 cup milk that I soured with juice from half a lemon. I also added the zest from the lemon and frozen blueberries. I was nervous about these substitutions but it worked out! I would recommend to mix the fruit or whatever flavour into the dry ingredients before adding the wet, otherwise it is hard to mix them in once the dough ball is formed. These are wonderful, will definitely be making again!

I reduced the flour by 1/3 cup, and added back oatmeal. I used blueberries and cranberrys instead of raisins. 
My wife was very pleased with her Mothers Day Scones

Perfect scone!!!  I've made scones before but they always tasted cakey.  These have a perfect crumbly & crunchy.texture and moistness.  I grated the butter in my food processor and then added it to my dry ingredients. Not sure how much time I saved but worked out very good. Instead of raisins I uses craisins and walnuts.  I think they are even better than Starbucks scones. I highly recommend.

I make these all the time! They are delicious, easy to make and modify, and seem impossible to mess up. One time I omitted the egg, still good! One time I used almond milk instead of sour cream, still good! Also works well as a cheddar & green onion version (using less sugar). Easy to make without a food processor! Didn't freeze the butter, just chopped it up into little cubes and worked it into the flour with my hands. I don't mess with the last step, just flatten the stuff directly in the mixing bowl and cut in 8.
Looking forward to trying other combinations (blueberry & lemon, date & orange, cherry & dark chocolate, maple & walnut, pineapple & coconut, macadam nut & white chocolate, etc.)

These are very good! When I'm baking with raisins I like to throw them in hot water for about 10 minutes before I add them to whatever I'm baking. I did this, but made no other changes to this recipe and my scones turned out wonderful! Light flavor, delicate crumb, plump raisins, simply delicious!

Perfection.  My new go-to scone recipe.   Excellent texture, not too sweet.  I think grating that butter (used my food processor) makes the difference.  NOTE: I used plain whole yogurt for the sour cream because that's what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you so much.

Easy and wonderful.  I do this in the food processor and it turns out perfectly every time.  Don't add too much liquid (I tried adding some orange juice - about 3 tablespoons- and it made it too moist to flatten and cut into triangles.  I just added a bit more flour and made drop scones and they were very tasty, but not as light as the original recipe.)  After I cut the triangles I mix a bit of flour and sugar together and coat the edges of the scone before baking, makes a nice crunchy sweet "crust."  Fantastic recipe!!  Thank you!

I don't have a food processor, but these are worth the effort. I've made them 3 times, and they are better than anything you can buy. They look beautiful, too. Grating the butter is the most grueling part, but no issues otherwise. Highly recommend the lemon / blueberry version.

It is more cake like rather than a scone. Dough very wet and sticky as written ~ flour everything and still had to reshape once on cookie sheet. Used pampered chef grater for the butter it was not a bad option but I will consider freezing the cylinder next time to keep butter from getting warm and sticking.

I loved this recipe!!  My favorite scones have always been the Barnes & Noble Cafe scones and these have a taste very similar to them!  I also made these before getting the kids to school, so I'm glad it was quick to make. 

I did make some small changes.  I used light sour cream, substituted the fruit with dried blueberries, and just used refridgerated butter.  I'm going  to save this recipe for Easter brunch!

Wow these are yummy :) my first time making scones and they turned out really moist. I used fresh blueberries. I didn't use a food processor like everyone else did. from what I read from other reviews. I have a theory make recipes the way they're supposed to. will recommend these to my friends

These scones were delicious and the recipe was very easy to follow.I grated the butter in which was pretty much effortless. The only measurement I changed is that I added 1 cup of raisins rather than the 1/2 cup from the recipe because we like raisins in our household. I set the oven timer to 15 minutes initially then I checked it and they were slightly too moist so I added another minute. Then I switched the oven off completely and let the scones stay in the oven for another minute.
I had never made scones before and these exceeded my expectations and were certainly much better than those I would usually purchase.
I will definitely be making these again and the variations from the footnotes.

For some reason, scones have always intimidated me.  They stalked me in the hallway of "Things You Haven't Baked Yet", until this recipe.  A great basic, I added a splash of almond in with the vanilla extract, swapped the raisins with craisins and added a hint of dried orange peel.  Delicious!  Can't wait to try them with other flavors.  Also a pizza cutter dipped in flour is a great way to cut the dough into the well-known triangle shapes.

I have made scones many times but this is my favorite recipe so far!  I made orange cranberry and they came out moist....I also put a vanilla glaze with confectionary sugar,vanilla, and milk which put a little sweeter touch to it...making it like a dessert.

We liked these a lot and I didn't even have frozen butter. I just used what was in the fridge. No food processor either, really? Just mix all the dry ingredients by hand and stir in your wet ones. I, also, added a teaspoon of vanilla for a fuller flavor. The texture was amazing and I've tried a few scone recipes; some use heavy cream, others milk or yogurt, but this is the first one I've tried with sour cream. Makes a vey moist scone, not dry and crumbly. Also, you can brush the tops of the scones with melted butter or milk before baking. A drizzle of icing is also nice on the cooled scones. Put anything in them that you enjoy in your muffins, I used chocolate chips.

Yes, I've made this recipe time and time again.  I do like adding the cranberries and orange zest for a great flavor.  I also frosted them with a simple frosting with orange juice added as the liquid, and that gave them even more great flavor.

Really good! I have to say they were some of the best scones I ever had. But using a food processor makes the job a lot easier. And I had ran out of all-propose flour so I used a little bit of whole wheat and they still turned out great!

I was impressed that the first time I made them they came out great...  follow the recipe and you can't go wrong.  suggestion:  just be sure your bowl is big enough to mix the dry ingredients with the wet ones ... need room for your hands.

Delicious!!! Possibly the best I've ever had! I made the cranberry orange and added a bit of coconut and decreased the sugar. I also used spelt flour instead of all purpose, otherwise followed the recipe as is. Will definitely make these again.

We use this recipe a lot.  Very easy and very good scones!  We make them with different kinds of ingredients, but our favorite is with barberries, a little tart berry that comes from Iran.  They can be found in a lot of middle eastern or Persian markets.  The are sometimes known as zereshk, their Persian name.

I had volunteered to make 24 scones for a church function for this morning that started at 9 am.  So, last night I made three batches of scones, a low fat recipe from a book I have here, and I burned two batches.  The third, I watched very carefully and pulled them out of the oven at the right time, but they were dry and tasteless.  I decided I would get up early and make some muffins, instead, even though I had promised scones.  So, this morning I got up at 7 am and found this recipe and how many people tried it, so I decided to bite the bullet and try this one.  I made two batches, cutting each batch into 10 pieces instead of 8, and carefully watched them as they baked.  They looked nice coming out of the oven. (I didn't have enough dried cranberries left to put in both batches, so I put chopped walnuts in one and combined the chopped walnuts and the rest of the cranberries for the other batch).  To my and my husband's delight they tasted good right out of the oven.  But, I thought, the real test would be what they tasted like after they cooled and even hours later when they were very cooled.  I took my 19 scones to the church function (my hubby and I shared one to taste) and while the program was running, one of the ladies from the kitchen came up behind me and said they were the best scones she had ever eaten and wanted the recipe.  I guess I will be making these again for church functions and home, too. Thanks for the excellent recipe. :)

I love to bake and decided to try something new, which is exactly how I stumbled upon this recipe. I've made it twice in the last two days--first time with vanilla and orange and the second batch were cranberry/ lemon with white chocolate. Very easy to make, and mixing up what you out in them is half the fun. Love them!

These scones are absolutely fantastic!!! They are honestly better than anything you can buy in a bakery. I made them for a Christmas brunch and added dried cranberries. My son doesn't like scones because they are dry but these have a little moisture in them that makes them taste so great. You can make extras and freeze them. The only thing I did differently was to cut the scones in half. Instead of 8 scones, I had 16. Most people seem to prefer the option of the smaller size and eating more if they want.

I love scones and am always looking for the perfect recipe for them.  I think this is it!  Nice and moist but still like a traditional scone.  I always like to make my own version of clotted cream to spread on them.  Just sweeten sour cream with sugar and refrigerate while making the scones.  Absolutely heavenly!

I use this recipe as my base and then add fruit, nuts, flavors,... Because they are such a hit I pre-shred frozen butter a pound at a time, bagging each stick separately and storing in the freezer.

Thank you very much!!  I've had many wonderful compliments from students, parents, co-workers, family and friends. This recipe allows for substitution easily: I used Splenda instead of sugar and blue berries instead of raisins for my second batch. I made a batch of holiday cut out scones for my mom's co-workers and they all complimented "her daughter baking skills".  She was so proud!!  Every one has asked for the recipe.  I've been sending them all to allrecipes.com

I just made it, it's perfect! Super easy. I made it without the raisins but topped it with a cream I made (just mixed sour cream, sugar, and whipped cream cheese), and topped that with strawberry jam. Yum! :)

This is the first time I have made scones and this recipe is awesome.  I put dried blueberries and low sugar craisins in and added ( after all ingredients mixed so as not to get soggy) a handful of almond flakes.
I used Splenda instead of sugar and yes I hand grated the butter.  (food processor on my wish list) 
We served these with a few spritzes of spray butter and drizzled raspberry honey over them.  Absolutely delicious.

These are so delicious. I have made this recipe so many times with so many different flavour variations. The only thing I would change is that there is really no need to grate the butter. I found this to be a huge pain the first time I tried this recipe. After that first time, I have been melting the butter instead. I find it turns out the same way and tastes just as good.

Made the cranberry/orange version, aside from not being able to zest my orange on a cheese grater, this was wonderful. I managed to get about 1/4 of the orange zested with a vegetable  peeler, minced the peel with a knife, and then added it to the mix. I then juiced the orange, added a couple of teaspoons of sugar to the juice, and then drizzled that over the scones. I had no idea scones were this easy. Many commercial scones are far too sweet, these were just perfect.

I've made this recipe twice now (without a food processor) and I love it.  Using the box grater for the butter is such a good idea and easier than using a pastry blender. It always seems too dry at first, but as I work it with my hands, pressing it against the bowl into a ball, I think the butter  starts to melt a little and helps pull it all together. Since I don't use a food processor, I don't have any issues with the dough being sticky. In fact, I don't even put the dough on a floured surface. I just put it directly onto the cookie sheet, flatten it into an oval shape and cut it into 8 triangles. I separate the triangles a little to give them room to get evenly baked. No problems. The end product is delicious. (Also, I used dried cranberries instead of raisins)

Very simple to make, and simply delicious!  Add whatever fruit/nuts you desire, one of our favourites is chopped apple and walnuts.  A drizzle of lemony icing sugar wakes up the flavours.

Seriously the best scones I ever had and super easy to make!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used a food processor for the butter.  Mine is small, so I only put in a cup of flour in the food processor and used it to chop up the butter, then I mixed everything into a big bowl with the remaining flour.  I used dried cherries and vanilla extract.  I did not think it would form a ball of dough, but be patient and keep working it!

First time making scones and with over 1000 reviews and 5 stars, I'm glad I chose this recipe!  I used my kitchenaid stand mixer like others. I combined dry ingredients, added frozen cubed butter, but I'm sure refrigerated cubed would work just fine and put mixer on medium until I had small pea sized butter chunks. Added blue berries instead of raisins and mixed wet ingredients plus 1 tsp of vanilla like some others. Turned the mixer on some more and once it was mixed, pat out onto wax paper and followed recipe. I LOVE super sweet baked goods. These are not very sweet, but with the blueberries, it was still great. With less sweetness, my husband commented that one was able to taste the dough without being over powered by sugar. I agree. This is my first scone recipe and probably the last one I will ever use. This is going in the cook book tonight!

I just made these scones and I think they're delicious! I love scones and this is the best recipe I've found so far. I also made them in the food processor with great results. They're very light and they melt in your mouth. I'll be making another batch very soon!Yum!

Fantastic! I melted the butter instead of grating it and saw no difference in taste or texture, threw in a cup of chopped candied cherries, 1/4 teaspoon of cherry extract, 1 teaspoon of vanilla  and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, after baking I drizzled with confectionery sugar mixed with 1/2 and 1/2 and 1/4 teaspoon orange extract. They turned out perfect everyone loved them.

I love these! I often bring them camping because they're filling and don't need to stay in a cooler. They turn out fluffy and not overly sweet. My favorite variation on them is chopping up very ripe strawberries in place of raisins. Kneading in the flour takes some elbow grease but is totally doable without a food processor. I also just scoop the dough in lumps out of the bowl and shape it into triangles straight on the pan to save a bit of time.

There really wasn't much flavor with these scones. I made the dough in the food processor like the reviews said, and I added cinnamon and brown sugar and apricots. And raw sugar on the tops. However they just had a bland flavor, next time I will definitely have to increase the sugar. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. The texture was nice, I'll put some butter and jam on them and maybe they will be better.

DO NOT OVER-WORK THE DOUGH.  I mix the dough with liquids in five turns and do not use an electric mixer. I also sift the flour to aerate it, and use a LARGE mixing bowl for easier mixing.  And I prefer to use buttermilk.

First introduced to scones by my  mother -n-law :)
I followed the recipe and they are grrrreat! I did use a little mare sugar that recipe called for. Did not use a food processor, not necessary. Will experiment with different add-ons in the future. Will make again!

This is perfect for basic scones. They come out light and soft and not too dry, and it would be a great base for either savory (cheese, bacon, and green onion would be really yummy) or sweet (with the addition of vanilla and/or almond extract). The only things I changed were chocolate chips instead of raisins, patting out instead of rolling out, and I forgot to sprinkle sugar on top before baking. But very yummy!

We make these scones every week.  Instead of sour cream we use Noosa vanilla, honey or lemon yogurt (depending on what type of scones we make).  For Blueberry scones we use dried blueberries 5 oz, lemon zest and lemon yogurt.  For Cherry Scones we use dried cherries 5 oz, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and vanilla yogurt.  For Raspberry Scones use dried raspberries.  Raisin, honey and walnut are delicious, use honey yogurt.  We have also made Chocolate Chip Scones.
For a glaze, use cream cheese and jam with a little powdered sugar and a little melted butter.  Mix all ingredients and drizzle over scones. 
We make the dough and keep it in the fridge.  When we want scones we cut them and bake.  They are warm and delicious every morning.   ENJOY!  We are addicted to them.

Fantastic recipe! I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to the dry ingredients.  Then when I pulled the scones out of the oven, I split them open and filled with fresh cooked apples.  Delicious!

This recipe was absolutely amazing! It was moist and biscuit like just like how a scone should be! I put dried cranberries and 1 tbs of orange zest and they were DELICIOUS. Better than I expected. My family absolutely adored them. Needless to say, I will absolutely make these again.

I am not a person fond of baking. The times I bakes something have not been more than 10 (considering that I am at the age of 36, this is quite few :) ). I fell in love with scones when I tried them in Starbucks and whenever I like eating scones, I go there. Finally, I promised myself to try making them at home. This was the recipe I used; I followed the measurements as they are, but I was running out of sour cream, so I put 1/4 sour cream, 1/4 yoghurt. The dough came out a little sticky, but it did not effect the outcome. The scones were just like those that I ate in Starbucks. The recipe is so easy, and simple. I replaces raisins with cranberries, and added grated almonds. No need to have a mixer; and even I was able to make it with my own hands, and in 35 minutes including the baking time. Thanks for this recipe!

Not only was this recipe EASY, it produced TASTY scones!! I added more dried cranberries (because I love them) and orange zest than the recipe called for, but the orange flavor was still too subtle for my liking. Next time, I'll add even more zest :) I also made some other minor adjustments: I substituted baking margarine for butter and plain greek yogurt for sour cream; I painted the tops with melted (real) butter and sprinkled with corse raw sugar before baking. The best part of this recipe (other than it being so easy)... the scones are not too sweet, but rather quite perfect! Definitely adding this to my baking arsenal!

This is the best recipe I discovered in 2013.  Easy to make, even without a food processor to grate the butter.  I also found that I could make the dough ahead and refrigerate it (sealed tightly to so it didn't dry out) and bake it a little longer without compromising the quality.  Everyone who tried it loved that it was more moist than traditional scones.

best scones i've had! i added a tablespoon more sour cream, along with some golden raisins and craisins (also cold butter, cut in with a pastry cutter...didn't have frozen butter). took a few minutes longer to bake than stated in the recipe (about 22 minutes for my oven), but they were moist and delicious!

Freezing the butter ahead of time then grating it into the flour mixture makes these scones to die for!  I've tried a few different fruit substitutions, including chopped dried dates.  Yummy!

Great recipe! I made them with frozen raspberries and they are delicious!  Also, rather than pressing out the dough and cutting it, i used a muffin tin and divided the dough among the 12 cups (unlined).  So fast and easy and very tasty!

Great recipe. I put choc chips in half the dough and dried cranberries in the other. I didn't have sour cream, so I added vinegar to my milk . I also brushed the dough with milk before I sprinkled with sugar. Mine were done at 13 minutes.

Oh my goodness - are these ever good!!  Easy, peasy - I did not use a food processor just a good old-fashion bowl and fork. Why dirty all those parts on a food processor, right??  No need, these stirred up in just a couple of quick minutes and the only things I changed was my butter wasn't frozen, subbed plain Greek yogurt as I was out of sour cream AND I had to add 5 mins to the bake time to get them golden.  Despite all of that, these were excellent, great flavor and soft crumb with that crunchy, sugared top.  This is a recipe I have been searching for, for a very long time and it's a keeper!! I will be making these again.  PS:  Some of the reviews (no way could I read them all) mentioned the milk(s) they used?  There are no liquids in this recipe but they still come together quite nicely.  Thank you!!

Wow.  I'm not familiar with how scones are supposed to taste, but I needed something fairly quick so I used my processor as suggested by one reviewer to whip these up.  From the time I started collecting ingredients to when we were eating them was less than 45 minutes.  I added orange zest and craisens, then drizzled with a little powdered sugar/oj glaze and they were wonderful.  Not too syrupy sweet, crumbly but bisquit-like: Just a really good treat.  Will DEFINITELY be making these more often, and can't wait to try different flavor combo's... BTW: I only had salted butter on hand so I halved the salt and they turned out great.  Also, I put them on parchment paper and baked them on my pizza stone.  Perfect!

This is a great basic scone recipe, one you can be creative with.  I didn't have enough sour cream so I substituted non-fat greek yogurt with blueberries and the flavor was outstanding!

Lovely! I substituted dried strawberries (NOT freeze-dried), which I covered in hot water for ten minutes, then drained and chopped the berries. I made the dough itself exactly as directed. After baking the scones for fifteen minutes, I cooled them for five minutes, then covered them with a strawberry glaze, made by whisking together one cup of powdered sugar, one tablespoon of strawberry preserves, and enough milk to make a spreadable glaze. I almost forgot--I added 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract to the egg/cream mixture. Delicious!

My daughter and I just did this recipe moments ago and it was great!!
I don't have a food processor so what I did was to take the cold butter and cut it into tiny pieces which i mixed with my hands. 
The whole process was fun, from start to delicious finish. 
I highly recommend the orange cranberry variation!!

I use this recipe to make fig and honey scones, and also blueberry lemon scones. I use honey vanilla yougurt for the fig ones and lemon yogurt for the blueberry ones. I also add 1/4 cup white chocolate chips because there is no vanilla in the original recipe. Everyone asks me for the recipe.. They are a little cakey but i dont like my scones too dry. I add some milk in fact if the dough seems too dry. But you could adjust that as you like. Im very grateful for this recipe as it really inspired me, and its so easy! Thank you!!!!

Delicious.  I brought them to a MOPS group and each woman said they were the best scones ever - "so moist" and "not dry."  One girl looked up the recipe immediately.  I added chocolate chips and 1 tsp vanilla.  I also didn't have sour cream so I used plain yogurt like other people suggested.  I also melted the butter like I read others did - too busy to great/crumble in.  The result was the scone I was looking for in 5 minutes of prep time.

These are so good.  I made cranberry/orange.  I cut my butter into 1 tbsp  chunks (didn't take time to freeze the butter) and put in the food processor with the dry ingredients (including whole dried cranberries) and pulsed until coarse crumbs, then added the sour cream, orange peel and egg and pulsed again until dough formed a ball. What a breeze, no fuss, no mess, no nicking my knuckles on the grater.  They came out light, moist and full of flavor.  I will definitely make these again, maybe for Easter morning breakfast.

I made these once before and they didn't turn out. I just made them again, and oh my. They are delicious! I followed the basic recipe, substituting plain Greek yoghurt for the sour cream. Right before forming it into a ball in the bowl, I added 1/2 c. frozen blueberries and 1/2 c. slivered almonds. Baked as directed, then let cool. I drizzled melted chocolate mixed with orange flavor on top. Half of them received semi-sweet. The other half received white chocolate. Delicious with my cup of Earl Grey :)

Just made these yesterday with mini chocolate chips because that's my hubby's favorite and they were delicious as expected from all the reviews I'd read.  Grating the frozen butter is a FABULOUS tip, I'll never go back to doing it any other way! Poo-hoo to Caljane who gave the recipe only three stars because she feels a food processor is a must; just careful with your knuckles when grating the very end of the butter.  My tip: I like to make TWO circles with the dough which yields smaller scones, and more crunchy edges :)

I make these once a week for the kids breakfast during the school year.  I however add zest from whatever I have around be it lemon or orange.  I also add whatever dried fruit I have around.  These could be cranberries, cherries or even blueberries, you don't have to be locked into raisins, experiment!  I manage to get 10 from this recipe.  Lastly if you do not have sour cream plain yogurt works just as well

These were really good but after burning the first batch I found that 375 degrees for 14 minutes was perfect.  I can't wait to bake these again with different add-ins!

They were tasty but dry. I recommend cooking on a lower temperature, like 350. Otherwise, good recipe.

Made these scones this morning.  I didn't have any sour cream so I used soy vanilla yogurt, 1/4 c dried cranberries, 1/4 cup raisins and a tad bit of milk as the dough seemed a bit dry.  It delish and very moist not dry as another person commented.  I have some left over heavy cream and will use it in my next batch along with choc chips.  This was my very first time making scones! I did not use a food processor to make this.  I'm a firm believer in using hands to bake.

I make these all the time.  They are delicious and everyone who tastes them absolutely loves them.  I have made every variation you have listed, and have even sold them at bake sales.  I think they are even better after sitting in a sealed container overnight.  So moist!   I do use a food processor though; makes them really quick and easy to put together. I do not put them on the bottom rack, I use the middle.  I am afraid the bottoms would burn in my ovenWonderful with tea, or a cup of coffee.  I might have to try some of the additions others have tried.  Cherry Almond are my favorite!

Easy, forgiving, delicious.  Working the dough by hand is essential; it appears to melt the butter so as to setup the diugh.

Scrumptious.  I made the lemon blueberry version with a light powdered sugar drizzle.  I divided the dough into eight flattened balls and baked it in my Omnia stovetop oven that I use in the camper.  Mmm, fresh baked scones and cowboy coffee out in the woods!

I made this recipe with the orange zest and dried cranberries.  They are delicious, and I will make them again.  However, I will change up the prep method.  I usually try to follow a recipe exactly the first time, which is what I did here.  But I do not like grating anything on a box grater, and frozen butter is no exception.  And trying to mix the butter into the dry ingredients with my hands was a total mess.  So terribly sticky that a large portion of the dough stuck to my fingers.  In desperation, I sprayed a little Pam on my hands, and I was finally able to get a ball formed.  From that point on, everything went smoothly.  The next time I make this recipe, I will skip the grating with a box grater and mixing with my fingers.  Instead, I will follow other reviewers suggestions to use my stand mixer or food processor.

Fantastic recipe!  I think using a pastry cutter gives the best results.  I also add a 1/2 tsp. vanilla and a 1/2 tsp. almond extract (I did not use the raisins).  Amazing!

Made these yesterday, they were perfect!  I always warm the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds on high before adding it to the dry ingredients.  It's just easier for me to mix it in.  I use non-fat Greek yogurt in place of sour cream too.  Heavenly, fluffy and delicious on there own, or with some strawberry jam on them!

The recipe is excellent! I have no food processor, but the recipe is still convenient for me. I made softer scones than I did with other recipes of "British Scones." They are not as fluffy as biscuits. Note:I add the fresh cranberry(1/2 cup) to replace the raisins, and the dough became too sticky. Even though, they still are very delicious! I'll try it again with "DRY" currants next time!

Like so many others, this was my first time making scones.  Now that I see how easy it is (using the food processor), I will definitely be doing it again and again.  I made apricot scones, and they have been out of the oven for 3 minutes and I've already eaten one.  They are just the right combo of crumbly and cakey.  Not too sweet, perfect with a cup of early grey tea, but a simple glaze would sweeten it up enough for those with a sweet tooth.  Thanks for a new go-to recipe!

I just made the almond cherry with Greek yogurt instead of sour cream--absolutely delicious. I'll be making them every weekend from now on. I followed the recipe from one of her cookbooks, and she has you whisk the sour cream/egg mixture first, and then says to work quickly so that the butter doesn't melt before you get it in the oven--good tips. Also--I would not bother hauling out and then washing the food processor for this. It was quick the first time through, and it seems like one of those recipes you could whip out even faster with practice.

I love them! They came out light, melt-in-your-mouth ... I tryed other recipe for scones, but this recipe beats the others. 
I made them using a food processor, quick and easy, not counting the washing of the processor...
Made with 1/2 cup of Dates and 1/2 cup of white chocolate. Great combination.

these were fantastic.  i made a couple of changes: 
-- used brown sugar.
-- used 1 cup all purpose white baking flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup wheat germ.
-- used low fat yogurt instead of sour cream.
they were moist and flaky inside, not dry or gritty, despite the whole wheat flour and wheat germ

I made the blueberry lemon and the cherry almond scones. They were super easy and taste amazing. I make homemade biscuits all the time so instead of frozen butter I just used cold butter out of the fridge and quickly used my finger tips to incorporate it into the dry ingredients. The key is to work quickly so as not to melt the butter with your hands. The batter will be messy so have your sour cream and eggs pre-mixed so you can add them with messy hands. Scones are just sweet biscuits so you want a wet dough. Try to add as little flour as possible when patting out the dough for cutting. The less you handle the dough the better. I didn't have dried blueberries so I used frozen ones I had frozen from the farm. It was slightly messier than the dried cherries but tasted wonderful.

Absolutely amazing, simple scones!!! Honestly, these are just delicious. I did not use a food processor as some have recommended. I grated the butter into the flour mixture and then worked in the butter with my fingers. Turned out absolutely scrumptious!! :D

These are absolutely fabulous, I have made them several times and they turn out perfect everytime. sometimes I cut them out round with a cookie cutter and so they bake up a bit faster so I decrease the time. other than that i didn't change a thing. Mmmm. Enjoy!

Really excellent! Substituted 8 Tbls canola oil to replace butter and added blackberries with lemon zest.  I would like to try 1/2 WW flour for a healthier version and maybe white chocolate chips another time for a really yummy treat.

based on other reviews I didn't bother freezing the butter and used a food processer to mix the dry ingredients with the butter.  Work like a charm, but I think I may have mixed too much.

Made mine w/ dried cranberries instead of raisins and ~1 tsp cinnamon and splashe of vanilla.

Good, easy, but had a more cakey texture than what I think of with scones.

This recipe is easy peasy lemon squeezy with a food processor. I mixed all the dry ingredients plus the butter and then added the wet ingredients.  I folded in the add-ins while I was briefly kneading and pressing out the dough.  I also substituted Splenda for sugar and fat free plain Greek yogurt for sour cream for a lighter version of this recipe.  These were great. They lasted maybe fifteen minutes once they were out of oven and were immediately voted to be put in the family cookbook.  The possibilities are endless!

It was okay. Dough was sticky to the extreme. My family liked it, but I was expecting a bit more. Will probably try again with different additions this time.

Nice, light scones.  I used dried cranberries in place of the raisins though otherwise followed the recipe.  I used my food processor and it made the assembly process easy!

I made these for my daughter's afternoon tea baby shower-- What a hit!--I did the cranberry/orange version and made them Mini-size--rolled the dough to about 1/2 inch thick and into a rectangle--cut the rectangle into about 3 inch squares then cut them on the diagonal to make small triangles--(I over cooked the first 2 batches) But it worked perfectly the next time-- I decreased the temperature to 385 and baked them only 9 minutes--a drizzle of powdered sugar/water/concentrated OJ and a drop of almond extract frosting-**-But never fear-- the first 2 batches were also eaten--even 2 days later wrapped in the microwave for a few seconds they were delicious. I do agree with others-- I wouldn't want to do these without a food processor but with the processor it is SO simple-

AMAZING! Perfection. I used chocolate chips and they turned out just perfect, even using reduced fat sour cream. Definitely a 5 star recipe I'd gladly eat from any bakery or B&B!

I like how cake like and light these come out. I think they are plenty sweet and rich with the little sugar that goes into them. They are a hit with my friends.

So easy and so delicious! I made mine with craisins, as I am not the biggest raisin or currant fan. I should added the orange zest to give it that extra flavor kick, but it was still awesome. I highly recommend this recipe!

These were delicious. This was my first time making scones and they came out really good! I used salted butter instead of unsalted and Craisins as a dry currant. Yummy!

I made these following the directions for the orange-cranberry variation and they were amazing. I did not use a food processor or freeze the butter. I cubed the butter and used a pastry blender. They came out beautifully!!

Love this recipe!   It's simple and delicious.  I have only made the orange cranberry version and it is divine.  My only change was to add more orange zest, because I wanted a more intense flavor.  A word of caution, I doubled the recipe once and the dough was much harder to work with and the results were not as good as the single batches I made.  This is on my list of favorite baked good recipes.  Thank you Pam!

Edit:  you do not need a food processor.  I never use mine for this recipe, I grate the butter with a metal grater straight into the bowl, less mess.  Again, easy, easy, easy.

I, too, wish I could give these more than five stars - they are wonderful! I just wanted to add that I was so addicted after the first batch that I knew I'd want more at a moment's notice, so I made them up, cut them as directed and froze them on a cookie sheet. When they were solidly frozen I put them in a gallon freezer bag and stored them in the freezer. When I want to bake them I don't even bother to thaw them - just pop them in the oven and bake a minute or two longer than the original recipe directs. YUMMY!!! I've tried the original recipe as written, and the orange/cranberry ones. Let's see...only about a thousand other combinations to try.....

delicious.  i didn't have any sour cream, so i replaced it with vanilla greek yogurt.  i should have increased the cooking time a few minutes with the substitution.  otherwise, delicious recipe.  i'd probably up the raisins next time or add nuts.

great with a 5 oz container of greek yogurt of any flavor as a sub for the sour cream.  could use a little vanilla or almond extract with variations of dried fruit or some fresh fruit minced if you want to add a little more flour.

Having never made scones before, this recipe IS very simple and delicious.  They came out really light, whereas a lot of bakery scones I've had tend to be very dense.  I did use my food processor as suggested by a couple other people and then mixed it all together in my stand mixer which made it even easier.  Quick, easy and super yummy - this is going into my regular rotation!

I just made these, and my husband demanded I keep the recipe handy.  They're the best scones I've ever made.  I didn't have sour cream or raisins, so I substituted about 1/3 cup coconut milk and lemon zest from one lemon. Still turned out absolutely fabulous.

Wonderful recipe!  It is now my favorite scone recipe.  I substituted dried blueberries for the raisins.  I also used a pastry blender to mix in the butter instead of grating it.  Much less hassle with the same results.

Have made maybe 20 times. I am asked to make these regularly as they are perfect scones. Save yourself some time and mix butter with dry ingredients in food processor. I use the orange/cranberry scone recipe.

I was looking for a quick and delicious scone.  I have found it.  The frozen, grated butter is the key in these.  It makes it light and flaky.  They came out perfect!  Just don't handle the dough too much and they will be just right!  My daughters and I had a wonderful impromptu Easter tea together with these!  Enjoy!

Changed the recipe a little, adding a little more sugar and a little more sour cream.  Mixed it up without the use of a food processor although if I had read a review earlier might have used it.  But it still turned out great. Recipe was very easy to follow and it turned out wonderful.  I will definitely make this again.  It's so much easier than I thought it would be.

Made these for my French in-laws (who prefer less- sugary pastries), and they loved them. Didn't have currents or raisins, so substituted chopped, dried apricots. Grating the butter by hand wasn't that hard, so don't let it deter you if you don't have a food processor handy.

This is a good basic scone recipe, but I've made others which I prefer. To me they were a little bland; a splash of vanilla or some icing on the finished product might help. Knead the dough for about a minute to get it to come together. I made one batch exactly as written (soaking the raisins in apple juice beforehand). I then used this as a base for another recipe, adding a tsp vanilla and the juice and zest from a medium-sized lemon, omitting the raisins, brushing on a lemon-vanilla icing, and sprinkling with poppy seeds. This has potential.

These were excellent.  I didn't have sour cream so I used full fat Greek yogurt (Cabot's 10% fat) and they were perfect.  That was the only change I made.

Very fluffy, tasty scones. A great vehicle for jam or curd. Subbed Greek yogurt for the sour cream. Also skipped the raisins since I was eating them with lemon curd.

Wonderful recipe. I use different dried fruits combos such as  cherry, cranberries& orange zest, dried blueberries, and raspberries, and with all these combos a handful of finely chopped almonds or pecans for crunch. I have also used fresh blueberries and raspberries, delicious! I use a food processor to mix ingredients for dough and then add  in the fruit (fresh or dried) along with the nuts, by hand.

I've never made scones before.  Thought I'd give these a try.  I made this exactly as written, except I used strawberries because I had them and they needed to be used.  The texture was great, but the flavor seemed a bit bland.  Will try again with different fruits or chocolate chips and extracts.

Thank you. I made some scones out of a tube this morning and was so sad, I could only eat a bite.  I found this recipe, made them and am now a happy camper! I made cranberry orange, the whole family loves them!

My family LOVES these and I always get compliments when I serve them to guests. 

I usually make mini scones by splitting the dough into 2 rounds and then cutting 8 out if each. 

I have tried making them with quite a few 'mix-ins' as I call them, but the fan favorite is mini chocolate chips.

Best scones I've ever made. Followed the suggestions to do it all in the food processor. Dusted the currants with flour first, brushed the tops with buttermilk before sprinkling with Demerara sugar. Delicious, light, awesome and I am sure endlessly modifiable. A great recipe.

This is an easy and excellent recipe. I added  1 tsp of cinnamon with the dry ingredients. The butter is easy to grate if is it really cold or frozen. I found it works best to mix it with your fingers as opposed to a pastry blender or fork.

These were delicious.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I'm not a natural cook by any means, let alone a baker and these were so simple to make. I substituted chopped blueberries since I'm not fond of raisins and my boyfriend at three in one sitting.  delicious.  definitely a keeper.

I used yogurt instead of sour cream, and added some cloves, nutmeg and cranberries. Also vanilla. Tasted too sweet, I'll have to try making these plain and then re-rating the recipe.

These scones are superb for lightness and texture. I didn't have any raisins for dried cranberries so I used a fruit, seed, and nut trail mix. I picked out the whole almonds and pecan halves but put dried cranberries, small pepita seeds and small pieces of walnuts, which added a lot. The nuts and seeds were half baked instead of the "soft crunchiness" of nuts when fully baked in quick breads. I was hoping for a little more of a sweet flavor. But overall, the recipe is very good.

i had a huge craving for scones and so i need a simple and easy recipe. I tried this recipe and boy did these scones hit the spot! I didnt have sour cream handy so i used greek yogurt and they turned out great.  Just enough sweetness and so fluffy on the inside.

I had a now-former recipe for apple cheddar scones.  I decided to try this recipe for the scone base and it is SO much better.  I added some seriously sharp white cheddar and diced dried apples.  To half the batch, I added some sage.  I baked them in my mini scone pan.  YUM!

Super fluffy and excellent! I used a cookie cutter to make circles (which I prefer). I also added cinammon and vanilla and used an egg wash to give it a glossy finish.

I've tried several different recipes for scones and this one tastes the best.  The most wonderful thing about this basic recipe is how versatile it is.  Instead of 1/2 cup Sour Cream, I've used various flavors of yogurt, mashed banana, blackberries boiled down with seeds strained out and then thickened with corn starch, and even guava paste melted down with some water added.  In order to get a denser consistency, I use 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup bread flour.

I substituted the sour cream with orange juice and added dried cranberries instead of currants.  I used butter out of the fridge instead of frozen, grated it as suggested and mixed it with my hands. It did not take much it at all.  Even if I did have a food processor I think I would prefer the hand method.

Overall, a great easy base...I can't wait to try some of the savory suggestions.

My husband really really likes scones and he said these were the best he had ever eaten. Freezing the butter definitely helped. Thanks for the suggestion. I also chilled the dry ingredients before using my hands to rub the butter into the flour. Skipped dried fruit and added a little vanilla. Used a bit more sugar on top. I've made these twice and both times were equally wonderful.
Edit: I have since made these at least 15 times with good results. I vary the flavors for fun but use this as a base recipe. Bought bulk butter and sour cream almost exclusively for these scones. Next I want to try fat-free yogurt for something a little healthier. The only problem I've run into was probably a measuring error, getting the dough too wet. Be careful if you want to add extra liquid ingredients. Tonight I am whipping them up with my food processor instead of by hand and so far so good. The butter isn't as finely mixed as usual. I was worried about blending it in instead of cutting and rubbing like for biscuits. Both ways seem to work well though. Oh, and if you don't have a bench scraper, get one! They are so handy for pulling dough together and shaping, even cutting. Last thing if you haven't considered it: try using sugar to prevent club fingers. Sprinkle on dough before rounding with your hands.

I'm sitting here eating my amazing chocolate chip scone with ground pecans and loving it! I've been looking for a good scone recipe for a long time and I finally found it! You have to try this, I'm tempted to make another batch and send it to my twin who just moved to Portland! So easy and yummy and sooo versatile. Can go sweet or savory! Next time I will try herbs and asiago! To pat out I used parchment paper dusted with flour, eliminating a lot of the mess.

These are the BEST Scones I have ever made or ever eaten.  You simply cannot go wrong with this recipe.  Our favorite is with the dried cranberries and orange zest but we also love the raisins too.

FANTASTIC!! Very easy to make...and so good!!! I made plains ones, first. They were so good, that I made another batch-this time with half chocolate chips and the other half of the batch butterscotch chips. Handed them out to the hired men and they LOVED them! SO easy to make...and even easier to eat!!

Relatively easy i don't have a food processor but I used my vitamix to mix the dry ingrediants but the butter clogged up the blade but it got most of the mixing for the butter done.  I used fresh blueberrirs and white chocolate chips and subbed low fat blueberry yogurt instead of sour cream to cut down the calories. Tasted better than the store bought ones. Can't wait to try different favors. I think next time I will split the batter into 2 and add different flavors to it and then cut the circle into 4 instead of 8 do I can have some variety.

The scones were great! I did not use a food processor for this recipe just did everything by hand. The scones were very moist and flavorful. I added fresh blueberries and made a lemon glaze to top it. My husband doesn't like scones and ate 2 of these. He really enjoyed them.

This is a great and easy recipe! As others have suggested, a food processor makes it a lot easier to throw these together. I generally followed the recipe, with some exceptions: I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I used plain Greek yogurt, which didn't make them heavy like I was afraid it would (in fact next time I'll probably try it with vanilla Greek yogurt!). I also divided the batch and did half with chocolate chips, and the other half with frozen mixed berries (I hate dried fruit). 
They came out so delicious; my notoriously finicky boyfriend called them "better than bakery quality."
I will definitely be making these A LOT over the upcoming holidays!

BEST RECIPE EVER!!! I substituted non fat plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream (you can do that with any recipe) and cut refrigerated butter into pieces, then pressed down on it using a tool that I smash potatos with. This recipe takes 15 minutes tops. Don't bother with grating frozen butter-it makes no difference. Everyone asks me for this recipe. Definitely a keeper!!

This is my first review on this site. I just had to say these are absolutely delicious!! The only thing I changed was to use blueberries in place of raisins,only because hubby doesn't like raisins. Thanks for the recipe.

I've tried a lot of scone recipes and this one is by far the best.  Instead of sour cream I use greek yogurt, sometimes plain, sometimes flavoured. For my dear friend's bridal shower I made apricot craisin scones using fruit in the cup apricot greek yogurt and OceanSpray Craisins.  (note: if you use the fruit filled greek yogurt, you can decrease the sugar almost in half, though you do not have to if you like a slightly sweeter scone). I have not tried a variation that I have NOT liked, and every time I serve them I am asked from what bakery they came.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!!

I've made these scones for several events at our church and am always getting rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I like to mix it up a bit and add different items such as currents, dried apricots, lemon zest, cranberries, etc.  I like to create different combo flavors which would include an extract, dried fruit and a nut.  I've also done some with mini chocolate chips.  Never any leftovers and it's a recipe I will continue to use over and over again.  Also, this was the first scone recipe I ever tried and the first time I tried it I had to make scones for over 100 women.

Great recipe that is easily changes by adding different dried fruits and flavors.  My favorite is adding orange zest and orange-flavored cranberries.  Oranze zest and dark chocolate chips is another favorite.

This recipe was easy enough for a beginner cook, my husband, who didn't use a food processor. Dried plums are a delicious substitute for more sugar-Kadence dried fruits.

I have tried other scones, and they didnt work out.  These were so easy and came out great!  I used vegan shortening instead of butter and added walnuts and dark chocolate chips instead of raisins...

Wow are they good!

Great Simple Scones Recipe in 30 minutes.  I loved to make Simple Scones fresh and oven-baked for Tea Time.  I have adjusted the measurements to 4 cups.  Added 1/2 cup of cranberries and one cup of strawberry yogurt.  Garnished with Glazed Walnuts for a crunchy, nutty taste.  It is a winning recipe!

Absolutely Delicious!  I made these scones using the footnote for cranberry-orange scones.  I used Ocean Spray craisins and added 1 Tbsp. of orange zest and about 2 tbsp extra sugar( we like sweeter scones)  So good. Recipe made 8 scones as stated.  Excellent warm and the next day; a small spoonful of orange marmalade on top was fantastic.  These scones are moist, not at all dry like some scones.  We kept these overnight in a plastic container.  Try these you will not be disappointed.

I mistakenly bought cottage cheese instead of sour cream so I subbed 1 carton of vanilla Activia which was not quite enough.  To compensate I added two tablespoons of cream cheese.  Also added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon and used raisins and craisins.  Sprinkled top with cinnamon sugar.  Awesome.

OMGosh! These are the most delicious scones I've ever tasted! I made them today for a William and Kate Royal Wedding viewing that I was having at my house. They were SO easy to make. I made them in my food processor and it only took me a few minutes. I added a 1/2cup of sugar instead of 1/3 because I like them sweet, a little vanilla flavoring, cranberries, and almonds...delish! This will be the ONLY scone recipe that I'll ever need! Thanks

Thanks so much for this recipe!  I too used my Kitchen Aid (with the bread hook) and frozen, grated butter.  I used Greek yogurt rather than the sour cream (that's what was in the house:) and thought the texture and taste was perfect!  This is the first time I've made scones, and am very pleased with the result...allrecipes.com has certainly provided many successful treats!

My friends and I do a tea every spring, and I'm in charge of scones, lemon curd and cream.  I've used a perfectly nice scone recipe for years but it never makes enough and this year I wanted to make another recipe, too.  Wow, this blows the other one out of the water.  Tender, moist, a hint of sweetness, just lovely.  I didn't freeze my butter - no time - and simply rubbed it into my flour until it resembled crumbs, like I did for my other recipe - which, incidentally, is now history.

I am the food service director for an upscale senior living facility. I made one double batch using raisin and a single batch using chocolate chips for a St. Patrick's day gathering at the facility. I ised a 2 inch cookie cutter and both kinds came out wonderful. Everyone loved them and were gone in a flash. Thanks for sharing.

I'd been too intimidated to try baking my own scones until I saw this recipe. It was incredibly easy, and I did the crumbling of the butter by hand! The only thing I'm going to do differently next time is add a little less salt, because the half teaspoon provides too much bite for my liking, but other than that, these came out absolutely delicious. Can't wait to bake again with dried cherries!

Amazing scones! We did make a couple of modifications. Instead of sour cream, we used vanilla soy yogurt and added 2tbls spoons of honey into the wet mixture. This made the scones extra moist, flaky, and melt-in-your mouth.  The kids loved em!!

Great recipe. I made these in my food processor and they were very quick and easy.  Nice and moist.  Going to use them for strawberry shortcake tomorrow so I put the zest of one lemon in them and they taste great.  Next time I'm going to add fresh raspberries with the lemon. Yum!

These are wonderful scones with a perfect texture and sweetness. No need for a food processor--give your arms some exercise and do it yourself.  I love the fact that sour creme is used, and not half and half, as I never have that on hand.  Served with a variety of fillings such as  lemon curd, marmalade or whipped creme (from a can!--yikes) and washed down with some black tea--you'll feel like you are in Devon!

Not very sweet but a delicious plain scone! I love this recipe! I added an assortment of small dried fruits (raisin etc.) and nuts. To add some sweetness I drizzled a mixture of butter, powdered sugar, and white chocolate chips. Love 'em!

These were so good and so easy to make!  I made them in my food processor and it took no time at all to whip up a couple of batches.

I made one batch of orange/cranberry and one batch of mocha chip (2T instant coffee dissolved in 2tsp of hot water and 1/2 cup chocolate chips).  For the mocha scones, I used sugar free chips and whole wheat flour which made for a grainier texture.  Both batches were yummy!  Thanks for this sooo simple recipe!  I can't wait to try more flavors!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.  I think these scones are THEE best.  One of the nice things about this receipe is making it in the food processor then adding the wet ingredients.  I often mix all dry ingredients (adding the zest at this time if that is what I want) then put in a freezer bag, when I want fresh scones all I have to do is add the egg and sour cream and additional things such as craisins or cinnamon chips.  Sometimes I have four bags in my freezer just waiting.

I just made the orange cranberry scones.  I added chopped pecans to the recipe.  WOW !!!!!!!!!  My Mom and I just finished eating one fresh out of the oven.  Now I know what I will be giving  the neighbors for Christmas this year !  These scones are not just easy to make , but the flavor and texture are perfect.

These scones turned out perfect. They were moist and not too sweet. I even used fat free sour cream to cut down on some of the fat. They had a great texture. I added chocolate chips instead of raisins because I didn't have any raisins.

i just made the lemon blueberry version and added lemon glaze (lemon juice, powdered sugar, vanilla and butter, recipe under lemon icing on all recipes).  I also used about a tablespoon of lemon zest instead of a tsp for more lemon flavor. This is the best scone recipe i've ever tasted.   Thank you for the recipe!!

Terrific recipe--easy--I had no food processor to blend the dough-if you use a box grater as suggested, freeze that along with the butter.    I did not have sour cream on hand, but had some heavy cream, and used slightly less than the amount listed for the sour cream--make sure you calibrate your oven, as the difference between 12 and 17 mins can mean the difference between an under done, over done or perfect scone..

So delicious, and very easy to make! I made the cranberry-orange variation. I only got about 1/2 tsp of zest from my orange, so I added a bit of orange extract to make up the difference. Came out fine - perfect for Christmas brunch. They were a big hit with my family; my dad ate three!

This recipe is fabulous!  I tried a different recipe years ago and said to heck with it, but decided to give scones a second chance.  I doubled the recipe, added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the wet ingredients, and split the dough in two.  I replaced the raisins with a cup of chocolate chips in dough ball one and a tablespoon of dried lavender in the other.  Both sets turned out beautifully!

Both my husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I agree with dumping everything in the food processor.  This is the technique I used.  Was a it better (than freezing and grating the butter)? I'll never know because I'm not patient enough to freeze and grate the butter.  But was it good?  Definitely!

First time ever making scones. I made this recipe for friends who are scone freaks and they each told me independently they were better than the scones served at the best bakery in town! Wow! I used cane (turbinado sp?) sugar and substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream. I also tried making whipped cream for them, but it curdled, however it ended up becoming a fabulous sweet butter-like spread. A serendipitous delight.

So very good,  I like a cup of coffee and a scone since they are dry.  I love this kind of pastry but not my husbands favorite.  He did enjoy these.

I’m new to baking and this was easy to follow and turned out amazing. My husband and son do not usually go after scones but they loved these. I did alter the ingredients a wee bit. We only cook with whole wheat that we mill ourselves and I was in the mood for a savory flavor so I used ½ cup of cheese and 1 Tbls of Jalapeño relish instead of raisins. Also, I didn’t have sour cream so I used Greek yogurt. They turned out awesome!!

Great recipe.  I also used the food processor to put it together, dry ingredients first, then added in the wet.  I used frozen blueberries instead of raisins so I added those in by hand afterward.  The second time I made it I added 1tsp vanilla extract, and I think it was better like that.

My first attempt at scones!  These are tender, moist, just crumbly enough and perfect sweetness. I made them plain, (not a raisin fan) added a teaspoon of cinnamon to batter, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top for flavor.  I used salted butter and omitted the salt.  This recipe's a keeper.  Blueberries in them are next!

Quite good indeed. Recently learned that baking is somewhat of a precision art.   Food processed the lot as others have mentioned. Made two batches in a row, both with the zest of one orange added to the dry ingredients and fresh raspberries added a couple pulses before I turned out the dough. First batch I cut eight scones as suggested; second batch I cut 16 mini scones. They were very cute.

Excellent basic recipe. I substituted about a cup of elderberries for the raisins. Had to be more gentle with the mixing or the whole lot turns purple.

I add fresh blueberries instead of raisins and these are my favorite!  They aren't dry like other scones.  They won me first prize at the fair last weekend, make them exactly as written, with or without added fruit!

I used Smart Balance butter blend using a pastry blender until mixture resembled course crumbs. I like my scones with softer edges, so I rolled the dough into a circle on parchment paper then transferred to round baking stone.  I sprinkled the sugar on top and cut into eight slices with a pizza cutter and baked without separating them.  Simple!

This recipe is wonderful. It was the first time that I had made scones. I switched up the flour to half whole wheat half white and added cranberry's and sliced almonds. Delicious! I will definitely be making this one again!

Perfect! I followed the recipe with the exception of using the food processor for the dry ingredients + frozen butter only. These scones turned out beautifully. I am always hesitant to make scones because they are often a bit too crumbly and dry. These still had the perfect scone texture, without falling apart and without being overly dry. Will make again and again! Thank you!

SIMPLY PERFECTION! I created an allrecipes.com membership just so I could recommend this awesome recipe.  I could have eaten all 8 cranberry orange scones myself, but made myself share with my family (sharing is the nice thing to do).  I The only thing I would do differently is double or triple the receipe.  Don't wait for a holiday to make; do it now!

These are like the BEST scones ever! I used 1 cup of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour and used low fat sour cream. I didn't have any parchment paper so I just gave the pan a quick spray with canola oil cooking spray and they turned out perfect! This is definitely a keeper!

What a great way to make scones!  The grated butter makes a big difference!  I found that it didn't mix well and seemed to fall apart instead of make a ball.  however I think that is the secret to these scones.  The messy mixing means they are light, moist and taste!  Excellent! By the way I didn't use the currants or raisins.  This recipe was easy and delicious!

absolutely wonderful. I just made these and they came out perfectly. So easy and so yummy! Grating the butter wasn't as much work as other posters suggested. I added some cinnamon to the dry mix and some vanilla to the sour cream/egg mix. i also used craisins. I plan on making these over and over again. i can't wait to try different variations!

These were good, light and moist unlike brick scones I've had before. I added blueberries but I think next time I'd add something like white chocolate chips or a glaze on top since they weren't as sweet as I like scones to be. These would be great for accompanying tea or coffee though.

This is my "go to" scone recipe. It's very versatile and never fails to come out yummy! A hint: don't use frozen butter. It's too hard to grate on a box grater. Just wait until you are ready to grate and then take a stick of butter right from the fridge. Easy to grate and still cold enough to not change the recipe results.

Wonderful recipe! Not too sweet, and the sour cream added just the right tinge of tang to make it very very appetizing. I made the following modifications just because I like my scones a little bit crispy on the outside. Instead of all-purpose flour, I used wholemeal flour. And I added half a teaspoon more baking powder.

This was my first attempt at making scones.  The flavors for the blueberry lemon scones were amazing.  However, the texture was very much like a muffin top, but slightly crispy all around.  Very delicious and moist but not exactly what I was looking for.   Just read a recipe for Giada's strawberry rosemary scones..sounds delicious.

Really easy to put together when I used the food processor, but really not all that much more difficult when done by hand.  Great tasting!  I made one batch with cranberries, and a second with dried mixed fruit and walnuts.  Both were very tasty.  Looking forward to trying other variations.

I made these scones two times ... the first time I made them plain, and the second time I added lemon zest and poppy seeds. The scones were delicious both times with a perfect texture. This is a great base recipe for scones and I look forward to making them again with a variety of different fillings/toppings.

I make these Scones on a regular basis, they are wonderful and so easy to make!  Last time I tried using Whole Wheat flour and they turned out delicious!

These are amazing!  I've made all of the suggested versions, but my favorite is the cherry/almond.  Wow.  I've been baking these for bridal showers, baby showers, and everyday get togethers for years now.

These scones were perfect!  I made them for a mothers day tea, and they disappeared quickly with lots of compliments!  The texture is nice and moist inside with a slight crust on outside which i love.*I brushed dough with milk and sprinkled with sugar before baking)   The only thing i would like to see is a little more flakiness but overall excellent! I did dried cranberries and white chocolate chips for my add ins.  The bottoms were a little dark with my dark baking sheet as another reviewer mentioned.  Would definately recomend using parchment paper if you have dark baking sheets.

This was the first time that I attempted to make scones.  I usually do the first run-through exactly as written, but this time I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  So, I used a half cup of cherry pastry filling (not pie filling) and added a bit more flour.  They turned out really well and I can't wait to experiement with other goodie additions!!!  We ate them with a bit more pastry filling on top.   5 stars for taste, texture, and ease of prep!!!  EXCELLENT!!!

these scones were absolutely de-lish! as i'm writing this my dad is saying he wants another one. i put the butter in the food processer, too, because i had no idea what a box grater was. i used a mixture of walnuts, raisins, and chocolate chips. they are best right out of the oven with jam, but they can be plain too! yummy in my tummy!

Yummmmmmy! I made the cranberry-orange scones last night as well as the chocolate-chip scones. I've never made scones and these were simple and easy to make. I'm not really sure why people think its a lot of work to make them - I don't have a food processor and mine came out just fine. NOTE: I suggest you use a "light-colored" baking sheet to bake these on. I used a dark-colored sheet the first batch and the bottoms came out dark. The next batch I used a light bottom baking sheet and they were perfect!

Yummy :) My hubby loves em!   Just follow the instructions-- they're not hard to make, especially if you've made pastries, pie crusts, anything of the sort.  The butter doesn't have to be frozen wayyy ahead of time, maybe right before you gather your ingredients-- just toss the stick in the freezer.  It could be a little bit sweeter, but it's great if you want to top it with a sweet topping.  I would prefer to have a creamier milkier taste.... maybe some milk powder would help, but awesome recipe-- they came out wonderfully!

I made scones as directed and drizzled conf. sugar mix with orange zest on top. Also made them with cinn. chips and drizzled conf. sugar mix & cinn. on top. Both turned out great. If I can do this, anyone can. Just follow the recipe before going done a different path.

Easy and delicious! I sprinkled vanilla sugar over the top before baking and omitted the raisins. Next time I'll try adding chocolate chips. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent.  The only thing I changed was that in lieu of the raisins, I used the zest from one orange and a handful of milk chocolate chips.  They were great!

This recipe could not be easier. Threw all the dry ingredients into my food processor. I subbed one cup of WW pastry flour and added orange rind as well. Cut the butter into tablespoon slices and orange rind and pulsed until dough was coarse, then added dried cranberries and the wet ingredients and blended until it started to clump. Made 12 round balls and smashed with my hands. Cooked these on a silpat mat  and they done after 12 mins in my oven. This is a great recipe and my scones were better than any I have ever tasted.

The texture on these scones was A+!  These were so much better than "Grandma's" recipe on here (the one I have been making for a couple of years).  My only objection was the flavor; it was just a little flat, in my opinion.  I followed the recipe to a "T", but next time, I would like to try the orange/cranberry combo.  I will stick with this recipe from now on, simply because the texture was so lovely.  Thank you for sharing this!

So simple!  So yummy!  I added chopped dried cranberries and chocolate chips to this....sprinkled the sheet with suger before ressing out the dough....I cut them nice and small for my little girl's tea party and they were a total hit!  I had to fight the urge to have more then my fair share with my coffee the morning before the tea party.  Excellent recipe.....I recommend using the food processor.  Wonderful!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Simply perfect scones. I sometimes use dried blueberries in them or plain with some lemon curd on top.

I love scones so I was extremely happy to find this one. So far, I have only made them with golden raisins. They are juicier than the black ones. And I substitute sour cream with non-fat plain yogurt mixed with 1/2 tsp baking soda. It is less fat to intake. And I love European style yogurt better because it makes the scones nice and soft (not as crumby). Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I'd always been intimidated by the idea of making scones, and now, having made them, I have no idea why - they're simple! I didn't grate the butter based on other reviewers' experiences, but instead just mushed the frozen bits into the flour with my fingers. I added a dash of cinnamon to the dough and subbed cinnamon chips for the raisins and ohhh, what a lovely thing it was indeed that emerged from the oven. Baked mine for 14 min and that seems perfect. I'll make these again for sure!!

5 stars just from the EASE of this recipe- must use a food processor- though because it's just so easy!  They did come out way too sweet (and I like sweet!) and not salty enough, even though I used salted butter.  I made blueberry lemon w/ lemon juice (use zest, wasn't lemony enough and made it too wet!), frozen berries worked though.  Also made cranberry orange with orange zest and craisins.  Overall very easy and tasty!

Made the cranberry/ orange scones and they were great. We at them up within 20 minutes. Used my food processor worked well on shreading the butter, everything else went real smooth. Will be making them again within a few days. Better than Star bucks...

They have to be good if I'm actually reviewing them! I've tried a bunch of different recipes for scones, and all I can say is: Wooooow! So good, with just the right texture. Didn't have any sour cream, so used plain yogurt instead. Also added generous half cup of chopped frozen cranberries tosseds with 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar, and 2 heeping taplespoons of orange rind. Turned out fantastic, and good even the next day! Will surely be making them gaine this week!

I just made these for my husband.  I did use the food processer and it was great!!!  The only changes I made was that I used 1 c flour 1 cup oatmeal (1/2 c while mixing with butter then added other 1/2 c and did two pulses) I did not have sourcream so I used vanilla yogurt.  made 1/2 orange cranberry and the other half cocunut choc chips.  I got 12 each.  I was entering the information on my calorie calculator and when I looked up at the scones 6 of them were gone!!!!  My husband ate 6 of them within 5 minutes of them coming out of the oven!  They were delish! very easy and fast to make.  I will be making these in different flavors again!!! Thank you so much for the recipe Love it!

This is a good recipe, but really messy. The dough seemed to stick to everything, but it baked really nice. I forgot to put the craisins in the first batch, so I had to make another! They were yummy too!

These are delicious. The only thing I change is to mix the sour cream and baking soda in a bowl at the beginning of everything. Add the egg to the rest of the ingredients and then the sour cream mix. My favorite flavors are orange/chocolate chip (add orange extract and orange zest to sour cream mixture + chocolate chips at the end) and cinnamon (add 2 T cinnamon to dry ingredients + cinnamon chips at the end).

These turned out to be perfect scones, and they were so easy to make.  I took the butter right out of the fridge, and didn't have a problem with grating the butter or the consistency of the mix.  I added craisins because it was what I had on hand, but look forward to using blueberries the next time.

Don't know what the big fuss was about with people saying it would be too much work without a food processor!  Just make sure to grate the butter like the recipe says and then it crumbles easily into a nice dough.  I think it took me all of five seconds!  Great base recipe -- can't wait to add some fresh fruit to this one.

I made these for people at work and they loved them.  I used the food processor as suggested and it was surprisingly easy.  I had always thought scones were time consuming and difficult to make, but this way they certainly weren't.  I made some w/ mini choco chips & dried cranberries, some with just raisins, and some with cinnamon and chopped dates.  All were yummy.

Very good recipe.  I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't make it as written.  I used one cup brown rice flour, and one cup oat flour.  I added 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and a sprinkle of ground nutmeg.  I cut the butter down to six tablespoons, because rice flour doesn't seem to absorb fat very well. I thought they turned out very well.  They baked very nicely, and taste wonderful.

These scones are perfect!!    Suggestions:    1. Don't skip the step of freezing (or even grating, for that matter), the butter.  The texture is just perfec.   2. Use fresh fruits - I made these with raspberries.  Note that if using raspberries or even blueberries, the berry will break apart.  In order to make your batter not look hot pink, after rinsing the raspberries, toss them in a little bit of flower.  Even when I mixed and mashed these in the bowl as the recipe has you do with the dough,  the scones came out of the oven with that perfect golden brown color.   3.  Bake the scones on a pizza sheet (circular baking pan) covered in foil and lightly sprayed with Pam.  This way, the bottoms come out the same color as the rest of the scone.

as others have said -- very adaptable ! I substituted strawberry yogurt for 1/2 of the sour cream. Used about 1/2 cup of brown sugar patted into the top, and then sprinkled with cinnamon. The suggestion to melt butter and blend with liquid ingredients was a great one too. My NEW fave recipe !!

These were absolutely delicious! I made the cranberry-orange version, and they were wonderful. I ate three of them myself within an hour of making them! You really don't need a food processor for these. They're actually quite simple to prepare.

I love these! I didn't ever believe I could do better than the store bought stuff but defiantly worth making at home. I make them with the lemon zest and frozen blueberries they taste great I have made with frozen butter grated and just cold butter no difference in end product to me. Just use whichever I have at the time.

I made the Cranberry Orange scones and they're absolutely delicious!  I also made them gluten free substituting all-purpose flour with "Beth's gluten-free all-purpose flour" by Gluten-Free Pantry.  They're not gritty at all.  And I added a squeeze or juice from half an orange along with a couple tablespoons of the meat of the orange.   I didn't have any flour left to roll out the dough, so I just sprayed a cookie sheet with olive oil non-stick spray and shaped the dough into the square and cut it.  Then, I just spread the pieces out and baked!  Delicious!  I can't wait to have another one in the morning with my pumpkin spice coffee!

This is a great recipe.  I followed it exactly with the following changes, I used margarine (cold, not frozen), used the zest of one orange and 1/2 cup cranberries.  I like them sweet, so I used a 1/2 cup of sugar.  I used my food processor to make this and each time the dough turns out very moist.  I spoon the dough onto a floured sheet of parchment paper, shape, cut and whala... the best scones ever!

If you're debating about which scone recipe to try, I would definitely recommend this one.  I made the cranberry/orange and they were great, but next time I'll snip the craisins into smaller bits.  I want to make a pumpkin/nut (no raisins) scone with this recipe.  Any suggestions on how to incorporate the canned pumpkin into this recipe?  Thanks!

Phenomenal!  I couldn't find a good pumpkin scone recipe so I used this one and altered it a tad by decreasing the sour cream and adding pumpkin and some spices.  BEST scone I've ever had.

Wonderful recipe! I used the cranberry-scone alternative, with about a TABLEspoon of zest. Perfect!  And, as recommended by another review, my butter was cold, not frozen; it grated and mixed in with ease. I also used 3/4 c. APF and 1/4 c. whole wheat flour because that's what I had. The scones were light and just the right amount of sweet.

I love this recipe!!!  With the food processor suggestion, I am able to make these scones a couple of times a week, no problem!  I make the cranberry orange scones almost exclusively and I generally add more orange zest, up to a full tablespoon.

Excellent! I skipped all the grating and kneading. I just threw everything into my Kitchen Aid, except egg and sour cream. Had it on low cycle until it resembled course crumbs. Add dried cherries, egg and sour cream. Mixed until all combined. I had to put it on high for a few seconds to make sure the egg was incorporated. Plopped it by the spoonful onto the cookie sheet. Delicious, none left, didn't even have time to take a picture. Oh so moist!!

Wonderful recipe. My first time making scones, and I will definitely be making these again. I divided the dough in half and added raisins to one half and I broke up chunks of Dark cherry chocolate for the other half. Wonderful! (the only part that i did not like was grating the butter into the mix, but it was totally worth it.) Maybe I will try the food processor idea next time.

I made these scones for the first time to take to a coffee hour at church.  They were a huge hit!  I made the cranberry-orange variety and used 8oz of plain greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.  I used a pastry blender to blend in the butter since I did not have any frozen butter and I really did not want to wash the butter out of my box grater.  The dough was not sticky and I had no problem with it.  I even had a request to make these for all the church functions.

love, love, love these scones. i typically omit the raisins/currants, and reduce the sugar to about 1/4c. i divide the batch in half, then 1/2 tsp cinnamon + 1/2c chocolate chips to one part, and 1/2 tsp garlic powder + 1/2c shredded cheddar to the other -- a side and a dessert, with very little added effort. (i make them by melting the butter, by the way.)

Great recipe!  I had some fresh blackberries I needed to use up and thought this would be a great recipe to do so!  Although the dough is messy to work with, especially fresh berries (should have frozen them), there's not much effort needed for these scones.  Great tip on grating the frozen butter - way easier than cutting it in!  Will use again and again!

These were a little hard to mix without using hands and I had to add a tiny bit more liquid to get all the flour to bind, but these were very flaky, light and as many eaters claimed, "the best scone I've ever had.".  I made the cherry/almond variety.  I changed the recipe slightly by chopping and soaking (then draining) the cherries and adding about 2 tbs chopped slivered almonds (and a little more than 1/2 tsp. extract).

These are the best! I have not seen any other recipes for scones that have frozen butter. I think that makes all the difference. They are very flaky and delicious.

These were fabulous!!!  I realized that I did not have enough flour so I used half whole wheat and splenda  baking sugar and they still turned out great.  I also used a heart shaped cookie cutter too and they came out so adorable. If it seems like it does not have enough water don't worry just keep working with it and you will be amazed at how it really does form.

I followed this to the 't' (almost-I substitued bluberries fresh picked from my garden--the reason I was on AR looking up a good scone recipe--and hazelnuts).  They taste awesome.  No problem with working batter--you really don't need a food processor as someone suggested, but it would speed things up.  And the dough formed into balls nicely.  Very easy to shape and cut.  Baked nicely at recommended settings.

These are awesome!  I've made them THREE times in the past week.  I've made them with fresh raspberries, fresh blueberries and then w/ lemon rind.  Oh.  And every one of those batches had about a 1/2 c. of white choc chips.  Definitely use food processor, did NOT freeze the butter ever, used plain yogurt in lieu of sour cream, and just experienced success with using only 6 T of butter.  (I'm not a low-fat kind of person, but 1 T per serving at three batches a week was getting fatty and expensive!)  Last thing:  They don't dry out overnight.  They STILL taste great the next day!  Amazing.

Very, very good, and easy too.  I much prefer this recipe over others on this site.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla to the sour cream/egg mixture.

These were absolutely delicious!! They came out moist and soft and I loved them! I used some orange zest and craisins and I didn't have any eggs on me but I did have egg whites, so I used the equivalent of 2 egg whites and it turned out great! (not to mention a little healthier) These were so simple and I'm definitely going to make them again. Also, freezing the butter isn't necessary. I just took a stick straight out of the refrigerator and used a pastry blender to cut it into the dry ingredients. Thanks for the recipe! I love it!! :)

These scones are fool-proof and actually very easy. I've grated the butter straight from the fridge and used milk w/ vinegar instead of sour cream and it works fine. We like to use fresh strawberries or choc. chips, cinnamon & nutmeg (better than any choc. chip cookie I've ever eaten) instead of raisins.

I mixed as is except used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  1/2 cup is not enough.  These were just OK.  They are a little bland so I'm sure if you played with the recipe you'd get better tasting scones. I used a star cookie cutter and it made 24 scones.  It is what it is, simple scones, but I'm rating it a 3 only bec those who rated it high made their own variations of this recipe so it's kind of deceiving to give it 5 stars for such a simple scone.  I'm still looking for the perfect scone recipe.

These scones are ridiculously easy to make if you use a food processor.  Toss in the dry ingredients, toss in your berries/zest/nuts/chocolate, toss in your liquids, and the machine does all the work.  I like the look of round scones rather than cut triangles, so I just place the dough by big spoonfuls onto the baking sheet.  Great, versatile recipe!

Excellent recipe, and easy, too. Food processor is not necessary, although it is nice to know that is an option. If you are used to making biscuits from scratch, you will have no problem mixing this dough. I made these with dried blueberries and they were fantastic!

These are the first scones I've ever made and I'll never need another recipe! I used my mini food processer to grate the butter, then added it to the dry mix. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the mix and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. Mixed everything as directed and sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar mixture before baking. WOW! This is a true winner. Easy and delicious. I'll be trying other variations soon. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

These were really tasty!  They are however much better straight out of the oven.  So if you are making them for guests make them the same day you will be serving them.

I'm giving this 4.5 stars, as it's an excellent base recipe. However, I found another reviewer's suggestion of melting the butter and combining it with the wet ingredients to be a real time (and arm!) saver. I modified this substituting brown sugar for white & adding a teaspoon each of vanilla extract & cinnamon and they were a hit with both my husband and my (PICKY!) 3-yr-old.

These are excellent, I tried adding raisins in a few, blueberries, and cranberries, and one mix of the two. Their all delicious! They manage to be moist and slightly sweet all at once. I will definitely be making these again, perhaps adding some lemon or orange zest.

I've never baked anything in my life, and I made these and they came out great. They taste really good, and really weren't that hard to make! I did have a little trouble mixing in the butter because it was frozen, but that's probably my ignorance.  The Cranberry-Orange ones are especially great! :0

DELICIOUS! Very easy to customize to your tastes. Update: My favourite combination of flavours is dried cranberries (instead of raisins) and the zest of one lemon.

Wow!  Absolutely fantastic scones!  I made the cranberry-orange variation and I'm eager to try the rest.  The scone was perfect:  perfect texture, perfect taste (not too sweet, not too bland), and perfect appearance.  Even better than a local bakery!  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

wow I have never made scones before. I used lemon,poppy seeds and a little lemon juice mixed this into the sour cream as well as dried blueberries. It turned out better then I expected. Can't go wrong with this recipe. have to add that now when adding the juice from a lemon or orange I add it to the sour cream as well as an extra 1Tsugar. Best scones ever

I have made a few different scone recipes and this is by far the best.  It isn't too sweet so it can be used for various purposes.  I personally add blueberries instead of raisins and they turn out fantastic.  Also adding some cinnamon to the mix and using cinnamon chips works out well.

WOW! Used the food processor like another reviewer suggested. Used frozen butter, and cut into little chunks. Also made my circle and then put in the fridge for 10 minutes to set up... and make the butter hard again... and the tasty and buttery flavor was beautiful! Very light and airy... WOW - so good!! I'll be making a second batch this week! Thank you!

Wow! I never had even thought of making scones before but saw a picture and thought I would give it a try.  I was very happy with the results.  I had never heard of freezing and grating butter but it was very easy.  I could have put it in the food processor I suppose but didn't feel like setting it up. After mixing the dry ingredients and butter I froze everything until the next day when I added an egg and yogurt.  I substituted yogurt for sour cream because I can't get it here (I live in Portugal.) Turned out great! Can't wait to try again with other combos.

I have a Victorian Tea fundraiser this weekend and I decided to help make scones for the event.  I have tasted scones that other people made in the past that were so dry, you were choking on them.  So I decided that I would use this recipe with my first try.  I thought these scones were excellent - very moist and flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly and just substituted dried cranberries for the raisins. I bought some into work to let people sample them. They got rave reviews!!  So I will be making a couple batches for this coming weekend.  I look forward to trying the other additions of orange or lemon rind, dried cherries and almond extract, etc.  Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe!!

I won FIRST place in our local fair this summer with the Cranberry/Orange version of these scones!  These are the best scones- I make them 2-3 times a month.  A co-worker of mine requests them all the time.  I use a food processor to make mixing easier.  I LOVE THEM!

I made these scones tonight for company, and they were delicious!!  I didn't use frozen butter, just chilled, and cut it in with a pastry cutter.  Rather than raisins, i used 1/3 cup dried cranberries, 1/3 cup white chocolate chips, and zest of 1/2 an orange.  Can't wait to experiment with other variations!!

Great with the following changes: 1 C white flour and 1 C wheat flour, added 1/2 C chopped dried berries, substituted low-fat sour cream, drizzled with a simple glaze frosting.

These turned out great!!!  Used Light margarine, 1 tsp vanilla, and frozen blueberries.  Cured my craving. Will make again and will add some lemon zest for fun.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

These weren't bad.  I seemed to have tasted the baking powder/soda.  I used fresh blueberries (need to find dried blueberries.)  I'll try them again with orange flavored craisins.

I had some fresh cherries, and instead of eating them the way they are, I wanted a recipe. These scones are great! Better than that espresso place where I used to buy them. I added about 5 cherries, half, pitted and quartered. I put them in half the dough. The other half of dough is waiting in the fridge for some Reese's Pieces that my husband picked up. Should be great, and I will make these again!

Great scone recipe.  I made the cherry almond version and my family loved them.  The second time a made them a used dried cranberries instead of the cherries and they were great as well. A little drizzle of a simple almond flavored glaze makes them look beautiful.

I don't think I will repeat this.  I made the lemon blueberry version and used a food processor to shred the butter.  I found the texture too moist to make into a scone and I ended up adding a lot of extra flour.  Baking took longer than expected as well.  The taste was alright, but not spectacular, although I did enjoy the lemon/blueberry flavor.  The effort to clean the sticky gloop out of the food processor was too much, and I will return to my other scone recipe.

This recipe seemed like it might have been a little complicated to make.  I was worried that I wouldn't have mixed the ingredients properly but the scones came out great!  On the first try too!  I made the cranberry orange version and they taste fantastic!

These turned out great. I really liked the texture and they were not too sweet like some scone recipes can be. I will make these again and again and experiment with different flavors. Thank you for the great recipe.

The best so far. I used dark- chocolate chips and cinnamon and sugar on top... really great everyone loved it, although working the frozen butter was annoying.

These scones are scrumptious! They were easy to make and turned out wonderfully moist and flavorful. I used light sour cream and accidently used 1 TB instead of 1 tp. on top, but no one minds a little extra sugar. I didn't have parchment paper so I baked them on an ungreased cookie sheet and they didn't stick or burn. Great recipe.

These were so yummy!!! Instead of raisins I used dried cranberries.  This recipe was quick and simple to make!  I will definately be making these again soon!

UPDATE: 5/18/08
I tried "Grandma Johnson's Scones" recipe from here and I must say that it was even better than this recipe!  I think I'm going to stick with that one from now on, those scones were SO DELICIOUS!!

First time I made these I used white chocolate chips and fresh raspberries.  It was kind of hard to mix in the fresh berries without making a mess and breaking them apart, but they were DELICIOUS!  This time I used mixed dried berries and white chips and the mixing was much easier.  I added a tsp vanilla each time.  These are better than any scone I can find at the local shops and I will definitely make again and again.

They went together easily and came out very soft and tasty!  I didn't freeze the butter, and it worked fine.  I didn't have sour cream so I used an equal amount of vanilla yogurt.  I don't know if that made them better since this was the first time I've made these.  I used chocolate chips instead of raisins, and added vanilla extract.  I'm not sure how much, since I kind of just dumped it in.  All in all, it was a great recipe!

I really like this recipe. But I hate raisins so I left those out and I added a dash of vanilla.  (I love vanilla so I put a few dashes).  I also make a simple powder sugar frosting/glaze that I drizzle over them while they are hot. I get lots of compliments.

Made these for the first time today, it's the only recipe I've ever tried, and I don't think I need look further.  I used non fat sour cream, added vanilla, craisins and white chocolate chunks.  They are wonderful, I can't wait to share them.

I made the orange-cranbery version of these scones and they turned out wonderfully!  Super simple to make and taste fabulous.  The only thing I changed in the recipe is I added a little bit more sour cream than stated.  It didn't appear that the batter was quite coming together.  I added another teaspoon of sour cream and that did the trick.  Definately try this recipe!

This was an excellent recipe.  Very quick and easy to make.  I added milk chocolate chips as I ran out of berries and it was still delicious.  I found they were best eaten the first day.  I will make again and again and add this to my favorites!

YUM!!! I love this recipe. I grated cold, but not frozen butter and it worked great. I doubled the recipe and to half added lemon zest and frozen blueberries. To the other half i added chocolate chips. Both versions turned out super yummy! UPDATE: I just made these again and thought i would try brushing them with creme and then sprinkling sugar on them- WOW, the result was fantastic- the top got a nice shine and the sugar was nice and crispy. Try it- you will be glad you did.

Excellent recipe and very flexible. I've made it as is, with fresh fruit (cranberries), using different liquids (cottage cheese, yogurt, etc.) and it seems to come out phenomenally no matter what.

These scones are wonderful! I made them for an afternoon tea, and since everything was going to be miniature, I cut them into bite sized triangles. The other changes I made were instead of using raisins I used mini cinnamon chips and then I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top of each scone. They were an absolute hit at the party.

These were great.  I have only made scones a couple of times but this was my favorite recipe so far.  I tried the cranberry and orange (but I substituted lemon instead)  They were delicious.  Nice and moist.  I also cut them out with a heart cookie cutter instead because I made them for breakfast in bed for my hubby for Valentine's Day!  They are delicious and worth all the effort!

These were very easy to make according to the recipe!  My co-workers loved these scones.  I made plain scones without the currants, and I added about 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the dry mix to make cheese scones.  Both turned out really well.

This recipe is really wonderful.  I was visiting a friend for the weekend and didn't have a grater and they still turned out remarkably well.  I think they have our local bakery beat.

These were fantastic. I used half white, half whole wheat flour. I also used reduced fat sour cream. I made three different kinds: orange cranberry, cinnamon chip, and blueberry almond. All were equally delicious! The second time I made them, I split the dough into two patties, and made smaller scones. I liked them better that way!!

This recipe is the best scone recipe I have found. The scones come out flaky and moist. I added lemon zest to the currant version and topped with a mixture of sugar and lavender salt. Very yummy!

As another reviewer suggested, I made this in the food processor. I added vanilla to the egg and sour cream mixture. I made mine with crasins, white chocolate chips, and walnuts.

The scones were a hit!! I made one batch of plain, one cranberry orange and one almond cherry. Everyone loved them and they were amazing! My only complaint is having to grate the butter - it took forever and I cut my hand twice! I wish there were an easier way to do it. I tried using my chopper but the butter softened too quickly and got stuck in the blade - so that didn't work for me. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I'm not sure why, but I thought making scones would be difficult, and that I wouldn't be able to do it. I was so wrong! This recipe truly is simple. I thought I'd messed it up several times by not mixing ingredients in the correct order and handling the dough too much, but they turned out wonderful! I made the lemon blueberry option and added some cream cheese icing. I'm so happy that I know I can make scones now!

mmmm. I love these!! They're so delicious and so easy to make. I use dried cranberries instead of raisins, and double up the quantity! Sometimes I add a couple of drops of orange extract too. My friends ask me to make these all the time for a "special breakfast treat"!

This was such a simple recipe. easy to make, with incredible results. I made them for a tea party I had with my girl friends. They all raved about these, and said they were better than store bought.

Honestly, the easiest scones i have ever made. And the tastiest too!

Very good flavor. I used golden raisins. Don't omit the sugar on top of them right before baking. I used brown coarse sugar and cinammon. Also substitute 1 and 1/2 of the regular flour for whole wheat. Grandioso!!!

These were really good. I made them with craisins.  The first batch didn't rise as much as I had hoped.  They were a little flat. The second batch I must have patted a little thicker. They were really good. My guests all wanted the recipe!

I had never made scones before, I love this recipe.  Instead of using sour cream, I used 1/2 cup of nonfat vanilla yogurt and used dried cherries instead of the raisins, I also used chunks of white chocolate!  YUMMY!

these were p[erfect. I have made a few differet recipies for scones and this is my new favorite. We had just picked fresh blueberries so I used 3/4 cup of those in place of the rasins. I did not freeze them before hand like someone else mentioned. I just added them to the end. They did not turn the socnes blue at all- my 3 and 5 yr old ate 2 each right out of the oven.

Excellent! This is a good base for the cranberry-orange scones I wanted to make.  I have to use an extra egg everytime for the dough to come together.  I now realize, since I own a Breadmaker, that our Canadian all-purpose flour is a bit different than American flour and we may need less in some recipes.

I used half flour and half oatmeal, substituted Splenda for sugar, added lemon flavoring and lemon zest for the most tasty scone I have ever had.  So easy when it is all done in food processor.  Add dry ingredients to processor, toss in cold (not frozen) butter which is cut in chunks; process till crumbly; add other ingredients to make a ball of dough which is so easy to pat into shape, score or cut through, bake and enjoy!  Great recipe! Will try raisins or cranberries next but lemon makes a great scone.

This is such a great basic recipe. I've made many variations adding fresh fruit, dried fruit, and different spices and they've turned out perfectly every time.

We especially love the basic recipe for strawberry shortcake. Fabulous.

Great scone recipe, very simple, takes little time and really delicious!  My only advice: don't make more then 8 scones, otherwise they come out too small, and use an egg wash on the tops before baking to get the golden brown color.  Delicious with butter and honey!

I thought that this might not be all that great..since scones are not really something I (as an Australian) picture the Americans being known for..but I have to hand it to you..this is great!  A bit of clotted cream (found at any ex-pat grocery store, or Wegmans..) and jam and I am in heaven!!

These were good.  I would give them a 5 if they were as good as my favorite recipe, but these are just a little on the dry side. The flavor is very good, though.  I may try them once more in the future just to give them another chance.  I used mini choc chips and in half the batch I also added some chopped walnuts.  I'm sending these to work with my husband tomorrow and I'm sure they'll go quickly!

This is a wonderful recipe! I don't like raisins, so I substitute 2 tbsps of finely grated lemon rind.

The use of frozen butter is pure genius! Use your food processor for a super quick mix of the ingredients. Or, mix by hand ~ either way, you'll end up with wonderful scones.  A specail treat for breakfast or afternoon tea.

This is a great recipe.  I don't grate the butter though.  I just cut it into medium chunks right out of the fridge.

A few great additions I use for the orange cranberry variation are: 1/2-1 tsp. of orange extract in the sour cream mixture; and also sprinkling liberally with course grained  white sugar for a crunchy texture with each bite.

I've also bought lemon extract and almond extract to try with the lemon/blueberry and cherry/almond variations.

I recently bought a cast iron mini scone pan - this seems to help ensure (general) uniformity in portion sizes.  Which help - considering I can eat half a batch in one sitting!

It was just like the picture and tasted great. The frozn butteradded a nice zest because it came out of the oven just melted and warm. But there was not enough liquid and some parts felt rawish.

Oh my goodness these are GOOD!  I’ve never had a scone let alone baked one before.  I followed the recipe for the cherry almond scones.  The only thing that was troublesome was how amazingly sticky the scone dough was- I wasn’t prepared for that and ended up with dough stuck to everything imaginable.  You need to flour everything from your hands to the knife!  Also, I left too much excess flour on the bottom of each scone and ended up over browning the bottoms.  I’ll definitely try these again, though, because they are worth the effort!

They were very good, but a little bit too sweet (and I used brown sugar). They are very easy to make if you use a food processor! I didn't change anything in the ingredients.

This is a very easy recipe- the first scones I ever made came out beautifully! My first batch was cranberry/orange. They had a heavenly aroma and eating it warm out of the oven was "like buttah". And for my second batch I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead of raisins and a very generous 1/2 cup of sour cream. My Czech husband didn't know what a scone was, but now he's a big fan!

These scones are DIVINE! They are moist, flaky and have an amazing texture. You can add whatever you'd like to keep it interesting, my favorite is the zest of two oranges and substituting the raisins for dried cranberries. YUM!

I LOVE this recipe. I made these for my family and everyone LOVED them.

I used frozen blueberries, and fresh lemon zest and 1 tablespoon of fresh Lemon Juice.

They came out great.

Absolutely awesome!!  I made both the cherry almond and cranberry orange versions for a baby shower tea party and they were a huge hit!  I actually rolled each batch into 2 circles - dough was probably 1/2" thick, but it made smaller scones which were great for the tea party theme (baked for just 15 minutes).  

Definitely will make again with different mix-ins!!

I just made these this morning to have for breakfast with my roommate.  They're so great, I am taking the leftovers to my boyfriend's therapy gym for the therapists to eat!  I'm not a huge fan of scones, but this simple recipe has let me customize them to my own finiky tastes.

Wow!  Just got them out of the oven and they are wonderful.  Once I tasted the dough I kinda figured they would be.  I used Smart Balance instead of real butter and didn't freeze it, just cut it in like you do biscuits.  For the sour cream I used full fat.  Instead of raisins I used frozen blueberries that streaked beautifully when you knead it slightly into a pie at the end.  Overall they were great and easy to make.

These were great. Not overly dry. I added 1/2 almond extract and a 1/2 cup of fresh raspberries, when I was mixing the dough I was thinking what a huge mess (because of the berries) and I didn't think that they would turn out. Well they did and they were awesome! Next I am trying them with dried cranberries, almond extract, and white chocolate chunks. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made these for my boyfriend's thesis defense this morning. I made the dough last night, cut the slices, and baked them this morning. Although I didn't try one, they went over really well. My boyfriend said they were amazing, but couldn't comment on their scone-like-ness.

I made the orange/cranberry version and I highly recommend it to those who are typically not too crazy about scones because of their typically dry texture.  The orange zest made the scones moister and extremely flavorful.  I used zest of 2 whole oranges which is a bit more than the recipe calls for.  Freezing the butter after cutting it in half inch cubes is a good idea.

I expected scones to be dry, but these were quite moist!  I would like them drier to go w/ my coffee, but a great recipe none the less.  I omitted raisans and sub. 1/2 t. almond extract and sprinkled chopped almonds on top w/ sugar.  Divine.

Awesome! My family was skeptical when I announced we were having SCONES for breakfast, and they loved them! What a hit, and the recipe was so easy. I made the original raisin variety, and they were great -- the perfect cross between a biscuit and a muffin. YUM!

Fantastic!  I never knew that scones could be so easy to make.  I made orange-blueberry, and they were delicious!  I did not have dried blueberries, so I used some frozen.  I just picked the blueberries from a bag of mixed berries and voila!  They turned out very well.  Thanks for an awesome addition!

I never ate or made scones before.  Needless to say I was pleasently surprised!  So delicious!  I made them with raisins and both of my kids just loved them!  I will definitely be making these again!

One word. Heaven!!  The recipe is easy and quick with fantastic results. Sweet, light and flaky. I'm amazed and I couldn't be happier that I tried this one. We ate ours with Raspberry Curd and Lemon Curd. I also left out the raisins. Better then our local tea room. Now all I have to figure out is how to make some tea punch/british punch. 

5 stars!

These are so easy and turn out well every time.  Grate frozen butter into the flour, then work quickly.  That frozen butter explodes with steam in the hot oven and makes for light, lucious scones.  I use greek yogurt instead of sour cream because I always have it on hand.

Loved it! I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and used my food processor to mix everything. Super easy. The bottoms were a little over cooked, so next time I’ll either put them in for less time, or turn the oven a little lower. But I will definitely make these again!

The best scone recipe that I've tried.  Perfect amount of sugar, not too sweet.  Great consistency, not too cakey or too dry. I used fresh blueberries, added 1 tsp vanilla to the egg mixture and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top prior to baking.  I am going to toss the other recipes away and use this as my go-to scone recipe.

This is a moist and delicious scone recipe - the best I've ever had! The only change I made was increase the sugar to 1/2 cup and I used chocolate chips instead of raisins. The texture and taste were superb.

Maybe I didn't place the pan low enough, but I basically needed to double the time. Otherwise they seem to be as expected. Still waiting for them to cool, but I tasted a bit of one and it seems to be pretty good.

I didn't have access to any dried fruits besides raisins and prunes so I used frozen blueberries instead and although they were a bit messy looking due to the way the dough was stained blue when they started to melt during mixing, they still turned out fantastic flavor and texture-wise!  will definitely make these again and try out different variations!

I have tried several scone recipes and this one is the best so far, although I doubt I'll try any new recipes since this one is soooooo good!  I changed the order up a bit as I learned the more you handle the batter, the heavier the scones become (aka "rocks").  I cut the butter into the flour, then added everything else.  I was concerned because the dough didn't seem moist enough, but sure enough, if you keep pressing it against the bowl it comes together.  The scones are delicious!  I didn't sprinkle additional sugar on top before baking as I don't like too much sweet, and these scones truly didn't need additional sugar on top.  I suppose if you have a real sweet tooth it would be fine.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

I love these scones!!!  Even though I messed up and forgot to mix the egg with the sour cream and ended up adding AFTER I had the dough "together."  I also melted the butter as suggested by another reviewer.  The dough was stickier than it lookrf on the video, but turned out GREAT!!!  I made cranberry with lemon zest (I didn't have an orange to make zest from).

I've made these several times and they are always a big hit.  I have grated the butter as stated but that is work which is not necessary.  Took another suggestion to use the food processor and works perfectly.  For a tip, (after googling measurements), 8TBSP of butter is equivalent to 1/2 cup.

I used a pastry blender instead of my hands, so the first time I put my hands in was to push the dough into a ball. I followed all the other instructions exactly and it mixed easily and came out wonderfully - so well that I immediately made a second batch. Thank you for a wonderful scone recipe!!!

I used craisins infused with cherry and a bit of cinnamon on top with the sugar. 
Also, I'm cutting it into 16ths. 
But my friends at work are now bugging me to make these again. These are easy and a huge hit!

Oh man oh man!  Made these and they are THE perfect texture.  I did the cranberry orange and wished I had used more cranberries just because I like them.  Everyone enjoyed these immensely.  Used a food food processor with butter out of the fridge and they came out perfect.

I made these with dried blueberries and almond extract and used turbinado (large crystal) sugar on top to give it an extra crunchy. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written. It wasn’t nearly as hard as I thought it would be. And it turned out really great! It looks just like store bought ones and tastes even better!  Would most definitely make this again.

These scones are delicious!  I've been making scones for 15 years, making for my Tea Club, and over 200 for Teas at  
my church.  I have always used a basic recipe that uses heavy whipping cream, very cold butter, and no egg.  I recently tried a recipe using buttermilk and one egg, and it was wonderful.  Then I tried one with buttermilk and no egg, and MELTED butter!  No cutting in the butter! I switched to using a food processor this step a long time ago, which is very helpful to women with arthritis in their hands or fingers.  It was also wonderful.  But with the melted butter recipe, I put all the ingredients in my Kitchenaid...didn't even have to use the food processor, just the Kitchenaid.  Okay, Now on to this recipe.  Today, someone brought these scones to our Sunday Adult Class...one bite, and I was hooked!  I can't wait to make a batch  tomorrow.  I am going to try it with  melted butter instead of frozen and grated butter.. My husband has humbly offered to be the taste tester. :)  If it doesn't work, then I'll use the food processor with frozen butter, but into small cubes....I can't do the grating.  I have been served many scone recipes by the other ladies in my Tea Club and at friends' homes, but none of them have been better, or even as good, as these.  If you don't like the idea of cutting in the butter, either by hand or by food processor, then try melting it, and pouring it into the center of your flour mixture.  I don't see how it made a difference in the two

This is the BEST scone recipe bar none.  You can’t over mix these.  Always turn out, my “go to” recipe.  You don’t have to use frozen butter, butter from fridge is fine.  If you want to limit mixing, you can start to mix in a bowl then turn into parchment paper and use the paper to “press” rest together, rather than stirring.  This should cut down on toughness, but I’ve never had trouble with tough scones with this recipe.

Love this recipe.  I did not need to use my food processor.  I used butter straight from the refrigerator and mixed it in with the dry ingredients with my pastry blender.  Not hard at all!
Instead of fruit, I went for savory and added about 1/2 lb of chopped thick cut bacon, 1-1/2 c. grated Sharp Cheddar cheese (using the large grate, not finely grated cheese), and about 1/8 c. more sour cream to help mix in the bacon and cheddar cheese.  I kneaded it into a large round ball, flattened it to about 1/2" thick and cut into 8 triangles.  They may have been a  little crumbly, but not too much.  You could pick up the entire triangle and eat it without it falling all over, so I think they were almost perfect.

So good, I followed others advice and used a food processor with frozen sliced butter. It came together easily, mixed in sour cream & egg then kneaded it a couple of times. Didn’t have cranberries but did have dried cherries.Perfect! Definitely a keeper …highly recommend

Easy recipe that can be adjusted for a variety of flavors.  I have used dried cherrys and added almond extract and also chocolate chips with some added creme de cacao.  

I use an ice cream scoop to portion, flatten slightly, and then sprinkle with Turbinado sugar.

It was my first time baking scones and they came out beautifully even without the food processor (and it didn’t take that much effort either). I had no dried fruits so omitted them and otherwise just followed the recipe as written. These scones are supermoist!! A must try recipe!

I loved the recipe! It was so good and it was perfect for begginer bakers. It was very time consuming and I would make theese the night before. The only negative thing is that they didn't leave a icing recipe. It would be very good with icing.

I’ve made these at least a dozen times. Usually the blueberry lemon and sometimes chocolate chip. My family loves these. They freeze well and are a easy to bake from frozen for a Sunday morning treat! They come together effortlessly in the food processor and are very versatile. Love these scones!

Okay, I followed the recipe but also added some vanilla and almond extract . The bottoms were very dark if not burnt. I think we need a lower temperature and longer baking time.

I used some freeze dried blueberries in place of the raisins and even though the blueberry flavor wasn't there (fault of ingredient) the scones were AMAZING!!!! My husband even asked if this was an old family recipe and if I'd made them before. In fact, this was my first time ever making scones!  This is now my go to and I will be making them from now on

So delightful. I ate one after leaving it to cool for 5 mins and it was so soft and fluffy. I added chocolate chips and walnuts instead of raisins and it was lovely. 
I’ll be making this again and again because it all came together in no time! I’m thinking of trying a savory scone next time, same recipe maybe less sugar and more salt.

Lovvve this recipe and how versatile it is! The first time I made it we didn’t have any sour cream so I used vanilla yogurt...now I use vanilla yogurt every time! SO good. I have used frozen blueberries, frozen blackberries, and chocolate chips and all of them came out so well!!! I also brush some milk on and sprinkle that big sugar on top before baking for some crunch.

These were easy to make and delicious! I do not have a food processor, but this recipe worked nicely. I used chopped prunes and lemon zest as the additive. My husband could not get enough! I know prunes - yuck, right? But if you’ve ever had Polish pastries, you know this fruit has an undeserved reputation. Try it! You might like it.

I love this recipe for scones. I love the frozen butter and grating it technique. I think it’s way easier than trying anything in a food processor as others have suggested. Cleaning the grater is much easier than cleaning a food processor and this is much less work than mixing in room temperature butter with a pastry knife. Anyway the recipe is great as written and a good base to play with to make all sorts of different kinds of scones. My only problem is having self control in eating them when they come out. I have to give them away to save myself and my waistline.

After having a white chocolate almond scone in a local bakery, I set out to clone it. This recipe worked beautifully! If you have a food processor, use it! SO easy! Mix your dry ingredients, add butter & mix, add wet ingredients & mix, then add your extras—pulse a few times and you’re done! No grating butter necessary.              Now for MY version of the white chocolate almond scones, this is what I did: I used straight-from-the-fridge butter. I added 1/2tsp almond extract to the liquid portion of recipe, then instead of raisins, I added 1/4c almond slices & 1/4c Ghirardelli white chocolate chips. I sprinkled pure cane sugar on top & topped with a few almond slices too. I followed another reviewers suggestion and baked at 395 for exactly 15 minutes. These are light & airy & so lovely with a cup of coffee! The flavor is very subtle, though I suppose you could add a touch more almond extract if you choose. This was my first time making scones and it was so easy! I highly recommend this recipe!

Excellent recipe, everyone in my family loves these! I follow everything and experiment with different flavors. I use a pastry cutter and cold butter for the first part since I don't have a food processor.

I followed the recipe and they were so flaky and not super sweet but so good!  My husband makes the scones in our family and his seem denser.  I like the texture of this scone much better.  I’m going to try the other varieties like the lemon blueberry.

I made the cherry-almond variation, and they were wonderful. The sweetness level was perfect.
It was my first effort at making scones. I'll be making this recipe in the future. My husband loved them.

Excellent recipe I have made it many times, sometimes eight or ten batches to serve at church breakfasts.  If you have a food processor it is even easier.  Put all ingredients in the bowl with the blade and pulse until it just starts sticking together.  Dump it out onto a floured surface, pat to form, and cut to desired shape. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake as directed.  My wife's favorite!

Great starter recipe, I added 2 tsp baking power, seems to help get it to rise better. My husbands favorite is blueberry & pecan, mine is lemon zest & currant, I use the zest from a whole lemon.

Amazing.  I used food processor to pulse dry ingredients and frozen butter.  I also added zest of one lemon and fresh blueberries (coated with flour).  I felt the dough wasn’t really coming together so I added a small splash of milk.  Once done from oven I dizzled a lemon juice and powdered sugar frosting.  Delish!!!

I just made my second batch. My change notes are to: * just dice the butter *mix in mixer with hook *a bit more fruit *crystal sugar on top *make round thicker cookies so the inside is a bit more moist *350 for 15 minutes. Made the cherry almond and the cranberry orange. Both very good!

I made several varieties including some with lemon zest and fresh blueberries and another with mini chocolate chips, (1/2 cup).  With the blueberries,  I gently folded them in at the end.  After patting down I added a few to even out.  Delicious! Next time I will try the food processor.

I teach a cooking class at The Cordova Tutorial, Memphis Tn.  I have students from 4th to 12 grade in the class.  This recipe was so easy to make and the results were wonderful.  I put students in 5 groups of 3 students.  Each made a different variation using this basic recipe.  We had raisin, craisin, Choc chip, orange and blueberry.  They all turned out great.  Thank you!!!!!

Made these this morning for a tea. After reading previous reviews I was going to use my food processor but at the last minute opted for the purist, hand grated frozen butter. True it wasn’t that hard but so much butter remained stuck to the inside of my box grater I needed to grab some more to compensate. That said they were delicious and a hit with my guests, including one friend whose mother is Scottish and well versed in scones! (She was anxious to share my hand grating method!) the only changes I made were to omit the raisins, add a teaspoon of vanilla and sprinkle with Penzeys cinnamon sugar.  I also used a round biscuit cutter to make more scones to share.  I will definitely make these again - in my food processor!

Simply put these are the best scones I’ve ever made.  Easy to prepare and they are not dry like previous recipes I’ve tried.  I added a bit of vanilla and they turned out perfect!

These were so yummy, I followed the recipe except I cut the butter instead of grating it, I did use lemon zest and lemon juice and then made a lemon frosting and it was incredible! My husband loved them so much he barely wanted to take them to the offie the next day where his co workers also loved them! I'll definitely make these again!

We're doing a Ladies Afternoon Tea at my church in a few weeks, so I've been reviewing many scone recipes. I decided I wanted to make some for a taste-test, and  I found this recipe that doesn't call for milk as most of them do, so I decided to try it.                                                                        I am SO GLAD I did!  It was very easy, and they were delicious. I made them exactly as listed; tried the orange cranberry (craisin)variation since I didn't have raisins.  I did put a light egg wash on them(saw this in other recipes to give them a golden color), and sprinkled a little sugar on top of that.  I let them cool for about 5-7 mins before I did my taste test.                                                            
They were not dry at all;  I thought they were perfect. I broke them in half and put a little strawberry jam and cool whip(haven't learned how to make clotted cream yet!) on the first one I tried.  Second one, I wanted to try plain, and it was good.    I know some of the other reviews mentioned needing a food processor; it's not necessary.     I cut each TBSP of butter into 4 small squares and mixed them into the dry ingredients by hand, and it was easy.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!!!

This is such a simple and delicious recipe. I follow the recipe just as it is posted.  After the dough is made I separate it to accommodate what my family wants. I have added chocolate chips, dried blueberries, cranberries, apples and cinnamon, lemon and poppy seed.

These scones turned out wonderfully! I made 3 servings since they were for a class project, and the only adjustment I made was add extra flour. Instead of 2 cups per serving, 2 2/3 worked the best for me. Overall a great recipe that I will probably use again!

This was my first time making scones. For some reason, I thought they were more difficult to make.  This recipe is super easy and quick. And they turned out so nice and fluffy. I followed the base recipe as written. I did not use a food processor.  I added dark chocolate chunks and orange zest.  Family loved them!  I am going to make lemon blueberry tomorrow.

The orange-cranberry variation is outstanding!  I've made many scones over the years, but this is my favorite and most requested by family and friends.  The flavor and texture are just right.

I don’t own a food processor and these scones turned out great. So, it can be done!  I used a pastry blender. It was a little work, but it’s always a little work when I get that out. I followed the recipe EXCEPT I added a little over 1/2 cup frozen blueberries and I didn't think ahead enough to freeze the butter.  I used chilled, un-softened butter and I was happy with how they turned out.

This was a delicious treat for St. Patrick’s day morning. I made it exactly as written and the only thing I would change is the 20 minute prep estimate (it took me about an hour to get it in the oven).  Otherwise, my husband and I devoured a couple of them each with coffee—yum!

Super easy and super DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe measurements as is, but used Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream. I also added a few special ingredients for flavor variations. As for the butter, I used super cold, refrigerated butter (not frozen) and cut it into the flour mixture with a potato masher, then a pastry cutter once manageable. 

The results were spectacular! The scones had a light crunchy exterior and a soft, but not too soft interior. They literally flew off the plates and within minutes, only crumbs remained. 

My Flavor Variations:
Cranberry-Orange with dried cranberries and orange zest added to dry ingredients, orange juice added to wet ingredients, topped with an orange glaze (orange juice, powdered sugar).

Blueberry-Lemon with dried blueberries and lemon zest added to dry ingredients, lemon juice added to wet ingredients, topped with a lemon drizzle (lemon juice, powdered sugar).

Chocolate Chip with extra large semi-sweet chocolate chips added to dry ingredients and vanilla extract added to wet ingredients. 

Almond (wedding cake) with sliced almonds added to dry ingredients, almond extract added to wet ingredients, topped with sugar. (next time I'll top with powdered sugar; that will be better) 

Cinnamon Spice with cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice added to dry ingredients, vanilla extract added to wet ingredients, topped with cinnamon-sugar.

As you can see, I have a sweet tooth. Next time I'll try savory flavors.

next time I'll use no raisins or will soak them overnight to soften them up. tasted good besides the dried out raisins but had a wonderful time scraping the sticky dough off my hands and thinking half the dough was washed down the drain.

I used a food processor for the whole process as sometime else recommended.  I also used Bob Mills 1-to-1 Gluten Free flour... You literally use it exactly in place of regular flour..same amount, no additional ingredients.  All three batches that I made turned out amazing!  The Englishman I made them for tried both regular and gluten free and actually prefers the gluten free... Less filling and very similar taste and texture.  I highly recommend these with clotted cream or mascarpone cheese... And don't forget the jam! So yum!!. Start to finish was 30 min total... That's pretty hard to beat for homemade pastries.

Instead of making the dough into a single mass and cutting I will drop dough onto baking sheet separately. I feel patting down the dough toughens it. But this is an easy recipe and they were tasty.

VERY GOOD...and easy :-)  This was our first attempt at making any scones, ever, and we were happy with them.

We added apples and cinnamon to 1/2 and blueberries to the other 1/2.

I've always been intimidated by the thought of making scones as they can become tough with too much working. These were very simple and melted in my mouth.  I will definitely make them again.

These were great!  Easy to make with ingredients I had on hand, and they turned out perfect.  I subbed out the 1/2 cup raisins for 1/4 cup semisweet and 1/4 cup salted caramel chips.  The food processor didn't do a very good job of stirring in the chips which I added last, I had to knead them in and they were not uniformly distributed.  Could have used more chips though!  I can't wait to try other combinations.  KEEPER!

These were the best scones I have ever had. I used to go to a local tea shop with my girlfriends and we would order scones, they were always a little dry. These are not!  I substituted the raisins for  dried blueberries and dried cherries.

These scones are amazing!  I took other reviewers advice and melted the butter instead of grating.  When you melt the butter it makes this recipe incredibly quick and easy! It only takes me a few minutes to make the dough!  You don't need a food processor or mixer.  I follow the directions exactly except I mix the melted butter with the other wet ingredients.

I have made this recipe before with grating the butter and honestly I cannot tell a difference in taste or texture.  It is just so much easier.  I also wanted to use blueberries so I dried fresh ones in  a 225 degree oven for 3 hours.  Delicious!

They were fun to make, and they were delicious. The only thing I  changed was to divide the recipe to make 16.

This recipe is amazing. When you use craisins instead of raisins it is awesome too. It got very good reviews from my family.

This is the best recipe ever! I have made these countless times! Ive subbed buttermilk for the sour cream and it works great. I also use about half a cup of sugar because i like a sweet scone. Even made a hot cross bun version by adding 1/4 cup mixed citron  and 1 1/2 tsp mixed spice along with the raisins/currants. Divine!

Delicious every time!  I have used this recipe multiple times now and added different items since we don't like the raisins.  I found that fresh blueberries or raspberries are our favorite so far.  It works best to roll the dough out and then push the fresh berries in the top to keep from destroying them and making a mush mess of your dough.

I've made this dozens of times, always to rave reviews. I even invented a flavor -- "Hawaiian" scones -- which turned out so well I'd like to share: 

(...base recipe plus...)
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup diced sweetened dried pineapple
1/2 cup diced macadamias
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut

I also sub whole wheat Einkorn flour (300g) which I grind myself, and brown sugar (75g) for the extra acid (gives more lift to the leaveners). I had some bad batches (too wet, sticky) when I was measuring flour and sugar by volume, so I've switched to weight (the volume equivalents are 2 1/2 cups flour, 1/3 cup brown sugar, I think).

Cheers,
Chris

Great Recipe!  Really appreciated the extra options below.  Was not too sweet which is great for scones.  I didn't have sour cream so I used homemade full fat yogurt as a substitute.  Worked perfect!

This recipe is a HIT. Every variation I’ve tried has been delicious and my guests are always so impressed!

A couple things I did differently:
1. Cold butter cut into chunks works great
2. Mix dry ingredients in food processor, add butter til crumbly, add wet ingredients. Done. So easy.
3. Bake on center rack and undercook JUST a little bit. (I do 13 minutes and they are perfectly brown on the bottoms/edges and moist on the inside.)
4. Make a drizzle out of powdered sugar, milk, and flavoring to go on top once they cook.
5. For the lemon blueberry I use 4-5 drops of lemon essential oil- gives SUCH good flavor, and easier/quicker than lemon zest. (I never have lemons on hand but always have lemon oil.) ???????

Instead of grating the butter, I finely minced the butter and added in little portions mixing throughout. It seemed a lot easier to do it that way. Since they were smaller chunks the butter was easier to mix through with your hands also. I added cranberries and small frozen blueberries, I recommend eating them with whipped cream cheese also. Great recipe, will Ben using this one again!

Use the food processor like in the comments!
Cut in half for mini scones. And serve with clotted cream & jam  since these are delish but very dry without toppings.

First-time try for Christmas breakfast and these turned out perfectly.  The only changes I made were the following (NO changes to ingredients):
1) Refrigerated the dough overnight so I could bake them fresh in the morning.
2) Divided the dough in two before rolling into two circles so we could have smaller scones, but double the batch (16).
3) Baked for 14 mins.
Fantastic recipe - Enjoy!

This recipe is a family favorite that we make all the time. The scones are great for a heavy breakfast or a snack and they aren't too sweet! We like to put lemon and poppy seeds in the batter.

I made these as written except I just used a pastry cutter to cut in cold butter from fridge. Used currents and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before baking.  Great pantry recipe for a weekend breakfast!

I made the cherry and almond scones just as the recipe stated except instead of sprinkling with sugar I drizzled with a confectioner sugar topping - found it easy to make and delicious!

Great tasting recipe.  Definitely use a food processor to cut the butter into the flour.  I used vanilla Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and dried cranberries instead of raisins.

We made these this evening and used a food processor as suggested by some other reviewers- so easy and they taste amazing! We did lemon zest and cranberries in place of the raisins.

Made this exact recipe, but substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and added white chocolate chips as well. Did some research and scones are normally made into about 2.5” circles with a round cookie cutter not cut into triangles. They also cook more evenly that way. They were a HUGE hit! They also bake better with a cold batter. You can make the batter ahead of time and refrigerate before cutting. I wish I had done that since I made 100 of them.

Great recipe. The only thing I changed was melting a tablespoon of butter with a couple tablespoons of half-and-half.  Use silicone brush to play it to the tops of the scones and then sprinkle a little turbinado sugar on top before baking.

Absolutely the best scones. Easy to make with simple ingredients. Made with raisin and everyone thought they were the best. Today it will be cranberries and white chocolate chips.

I have made this twice now. It is a very good basic recipe.I used a food processor to cut the butter into the dough.  I also added a bit of orange zest along with the cranberries. It was a really nice compliment. Definately will do this again.

It’s a 3 eating it plain but it becomes a 4 or 5 if you dunk it in hot coffee or tea. All the flavors mingle it suddenly becomes much more buttery tasting.

This is by far the best scone recipe on the planet!  My scones are better than any I've tasted from a bakery, Starbucks, or from other bakers!  You can't go wrong.  I use this as a base for Cranberry Orange, Blueberry Lemon, and Bacon Cheddar Scones!  They are perfection!  People will beg you for the recipe!

Made exactly as shown.  Middle not cooked and top & edges burnt.  40 is too hot and 15-17 mins not sufficient.   Grating butter was messy and time consuming.  Looking for  my English mum's recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed in how they turned out. I had to ad quite a bit of flour to even get the dough workable. I’m going to try again, because the taste was delicious, but I’m doing something wrong.

I had Thanksgiving brunch at my home. This recipe was very easy to follow. I only added 1/2 cup of dried Ocean Spray cranberries because I didn’t want it to be too sweet. I also opted for no icing.  I made them the night before because I had a lot of cooking to do Thanksgiving morning.  They were just as good. I will definitely make this again.

I find it amazing that this recipe for SIMPLE scones received a 4-star rating!  I like to consider myself a rather accomplished cook and baker, and found that I couldn't incorporate all of the flour.  When I tried to cut the wedges, they fell apart, and when I tried to transfer the (so-called) dough wedges from the floured surface to the parchment-lined baking sheet, I tried using a pie wedge, gave up, and plopped the dough into one large disc, hoping it would bake into something reminiscent of an Irish Soda Bread.  Well, I must say it makes decent soda bread, but I had to bake it a few minutes extra, after cutting it into proper wedges, to simulate scones and allow it to bake through.

I love this recipe and agree with others that a food processor makes these really simple!  Use frozen butter and pulse so you don’t over-mix. Using a food processor I can have these in the oven in 10 minutes.  I serve them with homemade jam and sweetened cream cheese that I make by blending cream cheese with a little sour cream, powdered sugar, dash of orange juice and almond or vanilla flavoring. Perfect breakfast or afternoon treat.

The mixing of the ingredients never got enough moisture to be anything but crumbly and tastes rather dry on the palate.  It was more "meh" than "wow!"

These scones are perfect every time!  The sour cream keeps them them from being too dry.  
I do make a few changes to the recipe.  My only complaint had been the grating of the stick of butter, so this is what I do.  I keep the stick of butter in the refrigerator, cut it lengthwise into four strips, then cut the four strips into tiny chips, and put these chips in the freezer the night before I am cooking the scones.  I almost always substitute dried cranberries and orange zest for the raisins.  I mix these with the dry ingredients and butter chips in my food processor.  I live in Vermont so I also substitute maple syrup for the white sugar (I pretty much substitute maple syrup for sugar in every recipe that calls for the latter).  The maple syrup gets mixed with the sour cream, and egg.  I pour this sour cream, syrup and egg mixture  into the food processor while it is turned on and mixing the dry ingredients.  The dough is ready about the time the food processor bogs down! 
I have a non-stick scone pan that makes 16 perfect little scones                                                                        every time.  
This recipe has never failed to please!

This will be a standby at our house.  So adaptable.  I actually wanted to make something with the cinnamon chips I had, so made everything as it was, but grated a bit of fresh nutmeg in it, added 2/3 cup of cinnamon chips, and proceeded as directed.  Drizzled a bit of powdered sugar frosting over the top with a light dusting of walnuts.  They were a big hit!  So moist and soft.

Wow! What a great and easy bake! I made it vegan, substituting Toffutti sour cream and vegan egg mix... it came out wonderful! So tasty and easy (especially using everyone’s suggestions to use a cuisinart to blend ingredients) - can’t wait to make these again! Everyone loved them!

Yum! Super easy with a food processor!  I didn’t have sour cream so I used vanilla Greek yoghurt with cinnamon chips for one batch, and plain Greek yoghurt with lemon flavor and dried cherries for the other. They took the full 17 minutes to bake, but I squeezed 2 batches on a large cookie sheet with parchment paper. This will be my new go to scone recipe!!

If you are looking for a simple fool proof recipe this is it. 
Have been poring over recipes for scones and had settled on another recipe. Measuring out the 4 and 2/3 rd cups flour called for  into a bowl,  I was overwhelmed by the massive amount of flour staring at me!! A quick perusal online brought me to this recipe and it was  a cinch to make. Not having a stick of frozen butter did not deter me. Grating a stick of butter from the refrigerator on to wax paper, sticking it in the freezer while getting the other ingredients together did the trick.  There was absolutely no need for a food processor. Took not more than a couple of minutes to rub in the butter to the flour.  Yogurt mixed with half and half was the only substitute I made since sour cream is usually not a staple in my fridg. Thank you !

I really enjoyed these. They came out moist and light. I used my bread machine dough selection and monitored the dough until it reached the right consistency. I found the butter was not too easy to work with but eventually it all can

I have made this more than once and love them! They also freeze well (so I don't eat the whole batch!), still tender and light when briefly defrosted and heated in toaster over. I do not put in raisins, though, prefer them plain.

Love these scones.  Very happy with the results.  The only difference is I added fresh blueberries- crushed a few spreading out the dough.  Will definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe! I made the Cranberry & Orange, and the Blueberry & Lemon. Flavors are great. Be careful not to overwork the dough so you get the right texture. I will be making these again.

I made them for my family for breakfast. They said to definitely make again. It took about an hour to make because we doubled it. They are very filling. All ages up to an 11 year old would only eat one. They seem small while you are baking. But once you get them into the oven, they puff up to about 2 or even 3 inches thick. Very delicious. For flavor we did a cup of dried apples and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. It was more of a sweet cake-biscuit-donut-cookie. Tasted like apple pie. Was good. More for kind of a dessert than a breakfast though. Great recipe.

This is a very good, very easy recipe and I’ve made these scones many times. A food processor is definitely a must, I cut the butter into chunks and freeze them. Place into the food processor along with dry ingredients and pulse 3 times, for 3 seconds each time. I prefer to use craisons, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly, perfect results, each and every time

Love this simple recipe. Made them using vanilla Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and Bob's Red Mill all purpose flour.  They were light, tender and flaky and not overly sweet.

Loved this recipe with dried blueberries and lemon. I increased the amount of fruit by 50%...even double would have been okay. I don't like thins very sweet, but with this recipe, I think the extra fruit brings it up to the level of sweetness that I prefer. I also made it with dried cranberries and lemon, and another with 1/5 almond meal substituted for the flour, some almond extract, sliced almonds and dried cherries. Loved the recipe and will make it again. Tip: don't skimp on the sugar for the top, with the low level of sweetness of the scone, I think the sugar on top makes it perfect. I made 16 scones instead of 8 by dividing the dough and making two 6" circles. This was better for taking to a gathering where people like smaller treats. Baked for 11 minutes. Enjoy!

Excellent scones! Made cranberry lemon scones using Greek yogurt because I didn't have any sour cream and they were scrumptious!  I have tried MANY scone recipes and this is, by far, the  best one I have ever tried and the one I will continue to use!  Thanks for sharing!

Take heart if you don’t have a food processor. I cut my butter into chunks and worked it into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter like making pie crust.  It worked fine.  These scones are moist and easy to make, taking about an hour from start to finish.  It’s a great basic recipe that you can add what ever flavorings ( chocolate chips?? ) you choose to.

I have used pretty much this exact same recipe with minor tweaks depending on the flavour of scone in am making for 15 years. The sour cream keeps the scones moist and light for days.   The dough can also be portioned and frozen and it bakes quite well.

I had a large bucket of fresh picked blueberries and my daughter decided we should use some for scones.  I had never made scones in my life!  We were out of milk, half and half and cream but ran across this recipe calling for sour cream.  It was amazing!  We followed the recipe to the letter and used the video from time to time.  These are the best scones I have ever tasted and so simple to make.

I know when you modify you shouldn’t rate it but, I used what I had in the house and it came out great. Substituted the sour cream for coconut milk (cream) added cinamon and instead of dried fruit used one cup frozen blueberries added to the dry before adding the wet. Turned on a cutting board to incorporate instead of the bowl method suggested. Amazing 5/5 breaky

Added lemon extract and dried blueberries. They were excellent! I needed a recipe with simple ingredients as I don't have access to many things. They were moist, great for breakfast or afternoon tea.

These scones turned out so well. My friends all asked for the recipe. I added 1 teaspoon pure almond extract to the liquid mixture and used frozen raspberries for my currants. I gently folded them in as my last ingredient so they didn't get too juicy. I did not freeze my butter and the refrigerated butter seemed to work fine.

Simple ingredients and easy to follow instructions.  These turned out great. Used the food processor and subbed the dried blueberries and lemon zest.  Really great recipe. Thank you!

Delicious scones! I added chocolate chips instead of fruits and they were absolutely perfect! The simplicity is very convenient too. If you are going to make these, they are wonderful for afternoon tea.

My first. Not the last! Enjoyed hot right out of the oven and the next day with butter. This recipe debunked all previous perceptions that scones were a hard, dense, and dry pastry likened a pet treat. Substituted small frozen blueberries for raisins. Baked till very slightly brown on the edges and bottom and the middle remained moist and fluffy. Will have to fine tune the drizzle topping technique. The drizzle soaked right into the pastry. Any tips?

Good basic recipe with many possibilities. I took one reviewer’s recommendation to melt the butter to streamline the process and had good results. I will use melted butter going forward.  I added a cup of fresh blueberries and 1/2 cup of walnuts and they were very good! I also like the simplicity of this recipe. The recipe does not include a milk wash or glaze. It is simple and tasty but you can build on it according to your own preferences.

Made  these with my grandson this morning and they were a hit! Followed the recipe exactly, only blend butter and flour mixer in my Ninja blender to incorporate the butter more easily. Thanks for a good recipe! (Only my third time making scones, the first was AWFUL)

I have made this recipe using lemon zest and blueberries and also orange zest and craisins.  It is my family’s favorite treat, hands down.  I use my food processor to pulse all ingredients except the fruit. It is quick and easy this way, as others have mentioned. I had only bought scones before because I didn’t think I could make tasty scones with a good consistency. This recipe has consistently turned out delicious. Thank you for sharing it!

Very good! Scones need plenty of butter, this recipe is wayyyyy better than others I’ve tried. I used dried cranberries that I allowed to plump in hot water before adding in. I’ll be making this with red raspberries once they are available locally.

Followed recipe, but made circle scones rather than triangles. I took out the scone about 8 minutes into baking. Made a tablespoon sized crater and dolloped a one teaspoon sized serving of strawberry jam or peach preserves. Baked for another 8 minutes. Nomable.

As most of the other commentators advised absolutely nothing about this recipe needs to be adjusted.  My 10 year old made the raisin scones and added an extra 1/4 cup of raisins b/c we like raisins.  I made the cranberry and orange ones and put as much orange zest as possible from one med/large orange. These were super easy to make and absolutely delicious

Very good, though I cut out a lot of the hand work -  I partially thawed my butter, diced it up and let the mixer blend it appropriately. I tried hand-stirring the dough but ended up using my stand mixer briefly to bring the dough together. I realize that over-stirring or over-kneading will destroy the tenderness of a biscuit and while I might gather the ingredients together in the bowl, I'll let the stand mixer do the bulk of the work next time.  Tasty, tender - everything you want in a biscuit or scone.

These were absolutely wonderful.  I usually like to follow the recipe exactly the first time, but I didn't have sour cream.  I used yogurt  instead.  It still was wonderful.  I'm sorry, I ate half, but they were so good.  I did leave the rest for my partner and friend.

I’m always taking this recipe and adding ingredients. This time, I took chai tea, 6 teabags, and emptied them in the dry ingredients.  Instead of sour cream, I substituted plain yogurt. I added chopped pecans and raisins. Excellent!!

This recipe is perfect. I've made it three times already and it's been great each time. I subbed out the raisins for chocolate chips.

Made this about 8 times now. Folllowed the recipe exactly just added cranberries to the flour mixture and folded in chunks of cream cheese (one block) before forming the circle. Perfect basic recipe!! I’ve made it with mini chocolate chips too. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I made these with Namaste Gluten Free Baking Blend.  I used the flour cup for cup and used cold butter and  my food processor to blend. I  baked them at 395 for 20 minutes. They turned out fantastic!  I only gave 4 stars because, after all, regular flour is superior, but when you need to eat gf.....enough said :)

YUMMY!  I've been making scones for years, but my normal recipe uses whipping cream.  I had a little sour cream that I needed to use before a trip and came across this gem.  It will be my new go-to scone recipe.  A few tips - I didn't freeze/grate the butter.  I cut it into pieces and used my pastry blender.  I also didn't mix it in the bowl.  I find it much easier to knead on a flour surface than in a bowl.  Finally, I used a rolling pin to flatten the top before cutting into wedges.   Just makes them a little more uniformly shaped so they bake more evenly.  I added cinnamon chips instead of the fruit and topped it with a cinnamon glaze.

Don't know what everybody needs a food processor for because I just stirred it with a fork and I didn't break a sweat. Less mixing is better anyway.  It was very sticky so I scraped it on to a heavily floured surface and floured my hands. Pat, pat, pat...done!  Easy peasy!
Made cranberry orange scones...yum!
Changes:  added way more craisins, added 1 t vanilla extract into the sour cream egg mixture, brushed tops with almond milk and sprinkled raw sugar because we like it sweet. 
This is an excellent recipe...thank you so much for sharing it!

I don't use frozen butter or a grater. I cut butter with a knife then squeeze it into the flour. After dough is altogether I pat it into a rectangle and cut 3 even slices long ways and 4 short ways to make 12 squares. I then round them off between my palms with base on counter,   pinch tops, brush flour off bottoms and place on baking sheet. I bake them 13+ minutes at 400 degrees f.  Also, I sift the flour twice then re-measure 2 cups plus add a bit more. Best scones ever, so everyone tells me. 
If I don't have sour cream I use plain yogurt but a little less.

Delicious! I added 70% Ghirardelli chocolate at the "raisin" time, and the scones turned out pleasantly sweet. I mixed everything with a fork/my clean hands, and that worked fine.

These are delicious. I made them for a work function.  I had to try one. I made a batch of lemon/blueberry and another cranberry/orange. Perfection! I used frozen butter, but used the food processor as other suggested.  Made it very easy. Saving this to my favorites.

I made a batch on Saturday and my kids asked for it again on Sunday - they are so easy I no problem with that! I made lemon blueberry scones with frozen wild blueberries - it came together fast and easy. I didn't have any sour cream but substituting plain Greek yogurt worked a treat. Now that I have this basic recipe, I can't wait to try other mix ins.
Also, I have tried the food processor route and the grated butter route - I find the grated butter makes for a lighter dough and then I don't have to clean my food processor ;)

Mine were done at 400F in 9 min-at 15min they were very brown almost burnt and inedible so I made a 2nd batch at 9 min and they were a lot better.

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday and it won't be the last time. I wanted to use them more as a biscuit so left out the fruit and they worked perfectly. In fact my husband had 3 stating he wished he had room for more.

I have made this recipe 8 or so times now.  It is fantastic.  I did make one change; I did not freeze the butter.  I used regular cold butter and used a pastry cutter to cut it into the flour mix, just like you would any flaky pastry.  
The resulting texture is somewhere between an American cookie and an American biscuit.  I am not sure what texture scones are supposed to have.  I polled native scone eaters and there was no consensus about the texture.  Some like it dense and dry, and some light and flaky.  So, I guess it is really personal preference.  This recipe makes a flaky inside and dry crunchy outside.  It is the best scone that I have every had, but I really don't like the dense dry scones.

Super yummy! I found this recipe really easy & quick. I used frozen raspberries pressed into the top of the dough before cutting up into triangles. My whole family loved them, my 1yo couldn’t get enough!

This recipe is absolutely amazing, I've already made it three times and I will definitely be making it many more! I make the suggested variation using almond extract and dried cherries, but I will definitely be trying different variations as time goes on! With the cherries and almond, it is delicious, moist, and delightfully flaky. I found the longer I let the butter freeze the easier it was to grate and the better the texture of the scones came out, and every time I've baked them they've taken right around the full 16-17 minutes. I'm so glad I found this recipe!

A+++. Best scones I ever ate. Super flakey and delicious. Used crasins and orange zest. Grating the butter wasn't that hard and it blended together beautifully.  Thanks for this amazing recipe.

Wonderful recipie and so easy! No need for a food processor. With the butter frozen, it's so easy to grate.  Key to flaky dough-Don't overwork it when kneading. These scones are moist and so delicious! I wouldn't change a thing! 
But know your oven. Baking mine on the middle bottom rack nearly burnt the bottoms of the scones at 15 minutes. Next time I'll use the center oven rack.

I made it following the recipe exactly.  So soft, lightly sweet.  Wonderful.  Made again 2 days later using lemon zest and fresh blueberries as I couldn’t find dried ones.  Those I cut into smaller squares.  Loved them  will add a bit more lemon though.

This is my go to scones (base) recipe. Inclusions as desired. I follow the recipe as written until the very end where I make my own adaptation of topping, glaze what have you. This round's glaze is 1/4c brown sugar, 1T vanilla extract, 1T sour cream. whisked till graininess is gone and drizzled on.

Loved this recipe.  I made exactly as directed, but substituted cranberries and added orange zest.  Also added powdered sugar glaze with touch of orange juice.   Delicious!  Tastes a lot like the Starbucks scones but I think even better.

After trying many different skill recipes this has become my go to. I have made regular scones, lemon scones, bananas, and many other scones with it.   It’s super simple, easy to make and they turn out perfect.  It almost makes you feel like you know what you’re doing

This was a very easy recipe and so delicious.  I used buttermilk instead of sour cream which worked great.   I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  I brushed the tops cream and sprinkled coarse sugar and almond slices on top.   They turned out beautifully.  The trick is not to overmix or over handle the dough.    This will be my new go to scone recipe and I will just alter the add-ins.

I cant's say how many times I've used this recipe.  I've made them for fundraisers that were teas, for Christmas presents which I added to my cookie and gingerbread baskets, for some elderly friends who LOVE them, for me and my family and then some.  The first time I've made them was back in 2010 and made them countless times since. NO changes.  Sometimes I use raisins and sometimes cranberries.  It's a fantastic recipe.

Update 11/20/18 - I can't stop making these scones! Every time I make them, they are a hit and never last long. Not to mention how easy they are to make (I don't have a food processor and have done just fine through several dozen batches of these). This recipe is sublime as written, and can be customized very easily too. This time of year the requests just keep coming for these scones; so glad I found this recipe!



Original 12/6/17 - Made these last night as written, using one of the author's notes for variation. It wasn't complicated at all. The hardest part was grating the butter and not have it melt in my hands. Otherwise, this went together very quickly and easily, and it was my first time making them.  They were delicious, not too sweet, crumbly texture, and the oh so subtle hint of twang from the sour cream. I made them for my boss' birthday and they were a huge hit in the office! So much so, that someone else asked for them for their birthday in a few weeks!  I can't say enough good things about this recipe. If you are considering making scones, THIS is the recipe to use.

Not too sweet buttery scones.  I made them with dried cranberries and orange zest, with an orange glaze.

This recipe calls for 1 large egg, so I added 2 small ones. I used blueberries instead of the currants/raisins.  Perhaps that is why the dough was very sticky but I managed to get it kneaded with a  dusting of flour . The scones were not done in the time that the recipe called for, so I had to bake them about 20 minutes longer until they were golden brown. I didn't read any reviews which I should have done before preparing the dough. Otherwise, I  would have used my food processor to mix the butter into the flour. I found this recipe very messy and time consuming  and won't make these again but will  stay with my old 'trusted' one.

followed the recipe exactly, but I used another person's suggestion and melted the butter instead of scraping frozen butter into the flour. I melted the butter then whisked it in slowly with the sour cream and egg. then added that to the flour as instructed. I also added frozen blueberries at the last step, before spreading on the counter to shape and cut. for my oven, 17 mins at 400 was perfect.

I have been llonking for a while now for a good scone recipe and this is it. I didn't use the glaze but did use the Tbsp of sugar on top. They were so good!!!  I used my kitchen aid mixer with the paddle attachment; cut the butter up in chunks and let it stir while i mixed the egg and sour cream!! So easy.

These were awesome and it was my first time making a scone ever.  My suggestion, is be patient while mixing the dough.  It will bind nicely, just stay with it.  Followed recipe to a tee and it was perfect.

LOVE this recipe! I make the scones smaller than directed by dividing dough in two, making circles of each about 1/2” , cutting each round into 6 pieces.  I also put the scones in the freezer for 30 minutes before baking. It seems to help with the “rise.”  We really like the lemon blueberry scones.

Taste was excellent. I followed the recipe to a ‘T’. My one frustration was that an 8 inch circle didn’t allow a 3/4 inch thickness to they were more flat than I wanted. There just wasn’t enough dough to do what the instructions stated. I would have liked a taller scone. But otherwise excellent.

I didn't have enough sour cream so I filled the measuring cup the rest of the way with yogurt. turned out great. I love the trick to grate the cold butter. I do that when I make pie crust. it's quicker for me than cutting it in at room temp. so far I've done plain, raisin, and dried cherry. I add a teaspoon of vanilla and sometimes some cinnamon because my fam loves it.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I made changes to it from the beginning. I omitted the raisins and added chopped white chocolate chunks and fresh or frozen raspberries - a favourite combo.  The basic recipe is great and I use it to tweak my own variations like chocolate and dried cherries (add almond flavouring to bring out the cherry flavour) and blueberries and lemon zest/flavouring. I love great basic recipes like this.

I have made this scone recipe dozens and dozens of times. They are always a hit. I made vanilla, chocolate chip, cinnamon, lemon, lime, maple, blueberry, etc. I switch out a few ingredients to create different flavors. Sometimes, I cut the dough in half and roll out two small balls then press them out to create mini scones. This is a great basic recipe! I highly recommend it!

I thought about using the food processor (which can be a bit of a pain to clean), but opted for making these according to the method in the recipe. I didn't find them that difficult. I put in cinnamon and white chocolate chips, and kept all the ingredients very cold throughout the process. I brushed the tops very lightly with cream and then sprinkled with sanding sugar. They're light, with just the right amount of crumble. My only other suggestion would be to cut them into smaller portions with a biscuit cutter. 8 scones from this recipe are quite large.

made no changes; these are DELISH! light, buttery, flaky, this is a keeper!!! if the dough seems just too wet, add a T of flour at a time, or dust the surface of a baking mat or parchment. i've added marmalade, preserves, chopped strawberries, blueberries, cranberries - all sorts of stuff. this recipe is a GREAT base.  be sure to separate the pieces so each side browns nicely. you dont HAVE to shred frozen butter, just chop it up and use 2 butter knives or a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the flour. just dont let your butter soften!

Very good scones, I'm not a scone expert but these were really fluffy and good. I did make one change. I had no butter in the house so I used butter flavored crisco and they turned out really good. I will be keeping this recipe in my files for later use.

I love scones and so does my daughter, who is visiting this weekend.  I change the flavoring often, using dried cherries and almond flavoring this time.  I've used this recipe for years and love it.  I reduce the amount of butter from 8 tbsp to 6 tbsp.  I made a note on the recipe years ago, and don't remember why, but they always turn out the way I like them.  Other recipes just don't measure up.  Oh and I don't use a food processor.  I don't find these difficult to make at all.

Excellent scone recipe! I did it all by hand and although it may seem intimidating to make it without a good processor, it's worth the satisfying results! Fluffy and delicious- next time I will try the almond/cherry variation.

I've made this recipe exactly as written, as well as trying different fruit variations countless times and it always comes out perfectly! Guests always rave about these scones. I like to make them without any fruit and use them as the 'shortcake' in strawberry shortcake desserts. They are delicious!

Fluffy, buttery, delicious! The only tweak I made was to add a little orange zest to the batter and then drizzle over some orange glaze (juice of 1 orange and some powdered sugar) after baking. Will use this recipe again.

Everyone loved them.  Very easy and I agree with caljane , use a food processor.  
Can see so may possible ways to change the flavor.

I love this recipe!  I followed others' suggestion to use food processor and I add chopped walnuts in the mix.  My family and friends love them so much that I have to make these weekly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Made these for a shower and wow, were they good!  We even used a general purpose gluten free flour. We sampled them ahead of time so we made a second batch.  Decided to divide the dough into two rounds to make the wedges cuter and a bit smaller.  Hope you have great success too.

So easy to follow.  I am not a baker and my scones come out great!  My first batch I added maple syrup for maple sxones. Second batch vanilla white chocolate chip. Here is the latest version, marionberry white chocolate chip.  The marionberry was jam made from home grown marionberries.  I love how flexible this recipe is!

I made it by hand and it is easy! If you are making one batch or wven a double batch at home it is not at all difficult, coming from someone who doesn't like complicated and hard to make recipes. It comes together easily and fast if you follow instructions. Don't over-work it. Substitued 2% yogurt for sour cream and it came out very well.

I had been trying to find the best scone recipe and I gratefully bumped into this one. This was my first time making them, it's really good!! The best thing about this one is that it's easy to follow, I did exactly what the recipe called for. Made a second batch but with blueberries instead ( I used frozen) and my goodness the taste is incredible. I would add some eggwash on top to give them that shiny look.

I have made scones before and they were a little dry.  However, this recipe is by far the best.  They were fluffy and more moist and were delicious.  I don't like raisins so I used dried cherries.  Before baking, I also dabbed some milk on top of the scones and then added a little raw sugar.  YUM!

I've made these scones several times now and I have substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream.  Also I have substituted half of the white flour with either almond or oat flour and they have all turned out just as good as the original recipe

This is a very easy recipe. It makes a moist scone with nice crust.  I did the cranberry/orange alternative. This is a very versatile recipe that I will definitely use again.

I made this today with mini chocolate chips. They are so yummy! I used my food processor and it took like 5 mins. It was so easy, I decided to make a second batch with lemon and fresh blueberries. I didn't have enough sour cream for the 2nd batch so I substituted organic whole milk plain yogurt. It tastes the same as the original recipe. This will be my go to recipe. So easy and versatile. My kids loved both recipes.

Delicious! This recipe is a keeper. Used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream because it's all I had - it worked fine. Also, chopped up crystallized ginger as my dried fruit. So good!

Excellent scone recipe, appreciate that it calls for sour cream, which I more often have in my kitchen than buttermilk or heavy cream. I increase the leavener to 2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda to make more biscuit like, and usually use white whole wheat flour to make whole grain. Have varied flavors, favorites are orange zest + chocolate chips or lemon zest + currants or almond extract+ sliced almonds. Takes less than 10 mins to prepare with either  pastry cutter or food processor.

I don't normally like scones because they are always too dry but a friend of mine loves them.  I saw this recipe and thought  I would give it a try.  This will definitely be the one I keep.  These are so moist and delicious!!!   I thought I would just try one to see how they were, well,ended up eating 2 o f them.  My friend loved them too!

This is my third batch of these!  Everyone who has tried them--including my brother who said "scones are terrible dried up biscuits"--has loved them!  I've made them with dried cherries, orange zest and almonds, pecans, raisins and cinnamon, and craisins, pistachios, and lemon zest.  Not a dry one in the lot!  Not a crumb left either!  The only change I made to the base recipe was to use brown sugar in place of the white.  They are equally as good with a sprinkle of demarrera sugar on top as with a confectioners sugar and whipping cream glaze.  You just cannot go wrong!

Yum! Made for my 5yo school lunches as she loves scones, and I've had to hide then so she doesn't pinch them all now (we split one to taste test while they were still warm and now she wants more). Made an almond, orange chocolate version though next time I will up the almonds as they are a little lost in the mix. I will also double the recipe so I have more than 8. Will make again.

I'm giving 5 stars to the dough, since I didn't have raisins or dried currants and didn't use them. Ive made it 4 times now. Twice with frozen blueberries, and twice with jalapeno, onion, and cheddar. Delicious both ways!!!! This recipe is wonderful, easy to follow, and versatile. The first 2 times I made them by hand, the second 2 in my newly purchased food processor. The food processor was considerably easier (of course), and, I think, it also put out a better product.  I found them to be less tough. This will be my new go-to recipe for sure!!

My modification was to use dried cranberries, almond slices and a little almond extract.

I've made a few changes that have worked well.  If you are concerned with using white flour, whole wheat flour works just as well.  I didn't like the amount of raisins it called for so I used ¾ cup instead.  Chopping up dried apricots and using them works very well.  I also tried chocolate chips.

Made the cherry almond variation.  Friends all loved it!  I did use the food processor.  I found the dough was easier to work with than other recipes.  It cut nicely into wedges.   Also, used half white whole wheat for the AP flour.  You couldn't taste the almond extract at all, so I would add more if you are like me and you love almond extract!  I used dried tart cherries from Trader Joe, but honestly didn't think they tasted different from cranberries.  Cranberries are cheaper than cherries, so either find a dried cherry that actually tastes like a cherry or use cranberries!   Definitely make again!

These turned out great. Made them with raisins and used the food processor as suggested by others. I will never go back to grating the frozen butter!

Did not grate, used a wire whisk on Kitchen Aid mixer to cut butter into flour.  Then changed out whisk to regular stir paddle for mixing in wet ingredients.  I pat down my scones flatter, we don't care for slicing open.   Just drizzle a simple icing sugar topping over these scones and enjoy.

I've made this scone recipe several times. It's my go to scone recipe. My family likes chocolate chip, blueberry (defrosted frozen berries dried with a paper towel works in a pinch) and lemon using the zest and a squeeze into the wet ingredients. Perfect every time.  I use a food processor until the point of adding chips or berries. I fold them in by hand. Just dont over process. Easy clean up. Soft and light inside with crispy outside. Perfect!

"Scones of home" (Blind melon reference) - making these made me feel like a master baker that should open her own shop in the middle of town and shout from the rooftops, "I can bake!!!". Seriously easy - amazingly yummy - I want to keep making these using different variations of blueberry, cinnamon, cranberry, etc. I still can't believe how easy scones are to make - I would have made them years ago. I will add this to my bag of baking party tricks when I want to impress someone. Best recipe ever!

Yes I added a little bit of Lemon juice to the egg and sour cream. I did not use frozen butter, I used butter left out over night and used a fork to mix the butter into the flour mixture    and yes I will make these again....

I've made these several times.  After reading the reviews, I pulled out my food processor and got busy baking!  For easy clean up, I roll out the dough on a large cutting board and I use parchment paper on my baking sheet.  I've never had scones from the grocery store, nor have I ever had high tea in London, so I don't have anything to compare these to, but  I have to say these are very easy and delicious!

This was so good!  My first time making scones (I've had them in the past and they were always dry).  My daughter asked to make them to try them and they were great!  We made them exactly as the recipe states and we put the vanilla glaze from allrecipes drizzled on the top and loved them.  We froze the leftovers and I popped them in the toaster oven on parchment paper for 5 - 8 minutes on 350 degrees to reheat and they were just as good if not better!  Thanks for this great recipe, I'll be having scones often now!!!

Really good.  Crispy edges.  I wanted to make cinnamon scones, so  I added a teaspoon or so of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  I made 2 separate discs, and spread cinnamon filling in between the discs.  I then made a cinnamon glaze.  This recipe worked perfectly for the cinnamon additions!

Wonderful recipe and a definite keeper!  I didn't freeze the butter but cut it into small pieces and then used my pastry blender to incorporate into the dry ingredients.  Made the cranberry/lemon version and cut the scones into bite-size pieces.

These scones were outstanding. Sure maybe a little easier in a food processor, but really no big deal by hand. I promise it's well worth the effort. Not too sweet, and a great consistency. I added chocolate chips and it was the only change I made. Next time I'm going to do cherries and almonds as suggested. Thank you for posting this tasty recipe.

This was as easy as advertised! It was also messy but the scones came out just right! The only thing I did different was that I used chocolate chips because that's what I had for add-ins. I think next time I'll make an icing to go over the top but the sugar is nice when that's all you have.

I cut the butter into small squares rather that grating.  It seemed to stay chilled longer.  I tried a food processor once and I found it made the scones tough so I went back to the good old fashioned way.  Don't over work the dough or that will toughen them also.  I've made them with every kind of fruit out there, fresh or dried and they are all wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good. Great buttery flavor, but as another reviewer said they were almost too cakey to be considered a scone/biscuit. I still liked them though :)

This is a quick recipe that yields wonderful results. I made the cranberry orange scone that turned out moist and flavorful. I try to stick to the recipe as much as possible however, I did not have sour cream so had to do with buttermilk instead. I intend to try this recipe out with sour cream as well and update my review.

So delicious and easy to make!  I shaved the frozen butter on a box grater which made it so much easier to blend with the dry ingredients.  I also added a tsp of vanilla, orange zest and cherries soaked in milk.  I topped it with a dusting of sugar in the raw, which added a nice crunch.  Dense yet not heavy, perfectly moist and fragrant.

This is my "go-to" scone recipe! I throw all the dry ingredients in the food processor, give them a whirl, then add the butter (slightly softened) and whir that around. Next I add the dried fruits and nuts to chop them up slightly. Add the sour cream/egg mix and pulse until it comes together. EASY PEASY!! I think I take more time cutting them into triangles than I do making them, lol!! I do brush the tops of them with milk prior to baking and add decorative sugar to give them a "finished" look. Outstanding!!

I didn't have a food processor so I used the cheese grater method. Although it was time consuming, the scones turned out great! They were soft and not dry at all; a great addition to teatime!
 I used currants for half the batch and cranberries and orange zest for the other half. Personally I liked the cranberries and orange zest ones  the best. Great recipe! I will definitely try the blueberry/lemon combo next time!

Have made this recipe several times and my whole family loves them! Very quick and easy and an excellent base for other flavors. Just the right amount of flour and sugar where it is sweet but not dry. However, I find that using a 1 cup raisins provided better flavor. Also, using a food processor for the butter saves time. Instead of using my fingers to blend butter into mix, I used a pastry blender and it worked quite well, if not better. Other than that, an excellent recipe all around, even when made with gluten free flour :)

Amazing taste. I didn't expect it to be that moist, but turned out well. I added cranberries and sliced almonds and used half the butter, the other half applesauce, and was delicious!
I didn't use a food processor, just a fork.

I wasn't impressed. Needed more sugar, too bland. I used frozen blueberries instead.  Maybe it needs brown sugar.

Awesome recipe! I made caramel sauce and white sugar sauce to go with it! I highly recommend you do the same! Carmel recipe: in a sauce pan melt butter then add 1-1/2 cup of white sugar... Melt together for 2 minutes then add 2 tbs of milk. Perfecto! And white sugar sauce is just powdered sugar and milk mixed together! Enjoy!

I did make twice.  The 2nd time with a no name flower.  I think it does make a difference if you use a brand name flower.   I found the mix more clumpy on the 2nd bake.

Also, I added 1/2 raisins and 1/2 chocolate chips.   maybe 3/4 of a cup.  Everyone loved them.

Great recipe! It's a keeper, for sure. I just cut the butter in with the dry ingredients, no need for a food processor. A little hard work never hurt anyone.Just use COLD butter, not frozen if choosing this path. I didn't have enough sour cream so I had to top it off with some yogurt. I added raisins this time around, despite no one in my family liking raisins, they devoured these scones. They turned out wonderfully!  I just don't understand one little thing in the recipe - why not just say a half cup of butter rather than 8 tablespoons? I will be making these little gems many more times to come.

Definitely will make again. I like the texture and taste of them a lot. Lessened the sugar though and I added about 2 Tbsp of milk in order to bring the dough together. Cranberries (instead of raisins) & orange zest. With my oven I had to put them on a higher rack for the last 5 minutes of baking to get them brown on top.

These scones were soft and delicious!  They turned out even better the second time I made them because I didn't bake them as long.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and drizzled them with orange glaze.  I'll definitely make these again!

I've had lots of scones, but I liked these the best. Fluffy, not too dry, and just the right amount of sweet! I did as suggested and added Almond Extract to the Sour Cream, and substituted Dried Cranberries for the Raisins. I made them an hour and a half ago, and we're down to two. So good. Recipe made 9 three-by-four inch scones. Perfect for 4 people to share.

This is a good, simple recipe to start with. I used 1/2 c. margarine instead of real butter and it tasted fine. I added 1/2 t. vanilla and a dash of cinnamon to the dough.  I omitted the baking soda, and put in about two heaping teaspoons of baking powder. Instead of the sour cream, I used milk. You have to start with about 1/2 c. milk, and then alternate flour and milk until you get a dough that can be kneaded. I added 1/4 c. dried cranberries and 1/2 c. finely chopped walnuts. Knead on a floured surface about a dozen times.  I baked on an ungreased pan at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes, then frosted with a thin powdered sugar glaze. Good!

These are simple (no need for food pro) and oh so good! I used melted butter, added 1 tsp almond extract and 1/2 cup frozen blueberries instead of raisins, topping with sliced almonds. They were great but not enough blueberries. Was asked to make more so used 1 cup blueberries & 1 tsp vanilla instead. Found the 2nd batch blander; prefer the almond extract & almond topping better but definitely needs the full cup berries. Of course hubby disagrees, is already  asking for more of the 2nd batch so I showed him how to use the oven!

Best scones ever!!  I've tried most of the variations.  Super easy, no food processor required, really can't mess it up!!  I've tried it with the sour cream and substitute plain yogurt  a few times, I like the sour cream better.  
More substitutes I've tried are:
Salted/unsalted butter, I really can't tell the difference -- 
Frozen thawed/fresh blueberries or cranberries, seems the same -- 
I put some cinnamon or other spices into dry ingredients -- 
I like to squeeze 1/2 lemon or orange into wet ingredients makes little more moist, I like it better.  Still very good without it -- 
I sprinkle raw sugar and cinnamon on top before cutting into scones -- 
Super-duper easy, cannot mess it  :)

Love this recipe and have made it many times.  It is so easy to change the flavor!  Today I made 1/2 batch white chocolate, cherry, walnut and the other 1/2 caramel, white chocolate, walnut.  Just make the basic recipe and substitute whatever dried fruit, nuts and/or chocolate combinations that you like.  I also add either almond extract or vanilla extract for an additional bit of flavor.  Hardest part is grating the butter but well worth the effort.

Suggestions from Caljane were of great help. Using a  food processor and freezing a stick of butter before grating turns this recipe into a quick and delicious breakfast treat. And I love using Caljane's recommendation for using peanut butter chips. Have made these 3 times in 2 weeks.

Oh wow, fabulous, I swapped out the sour cream with no-fat greek yogurt and served with whipped butter and Ginger Preserves from Scotland.  I will definitely be making these again, especially for my Mum who's from the UK!

I've used this recipe twice and will never use another. Sour cream keeps scones moist. Remember to not overwork the dough & the thicker you form them, the thicker they'll cook up :-) Last time I made them, I doubled it & worked well. Don't change a thing! Ok, well I did add a 1/4 tsp almond extract & exchanged the raisins for craisins. (Once I traded half the craisins for mini chocolate chips & still worked great!) Fundamentally perfect.

I make them all the time. Sometimes I make then like biscuits, but every time I make them they are devoured before the day is out.

I am 74 years old and have never eaten a scone before so I decided it was about time to try to do so.  I don't have a food processor so I do all my baking the hard way--elbow grease.  I have to admit this recipe was just not that simple for me and I probably will not make them again.  They tasted all right--more like a biscuit to me but my husband liked them.  Pay attention to other reviews and keep your hands moist when working the dough--it can be very sticky and hard to remove from your hands!

Very easy to make using a food processor.  I've tried all different ones:  lemon blueberry, pistachio, and mini chocolate chip. Delicious every time.  I hope they freeze well.

Wonderful. Next time, I'd like to cut the butter in better, hoping to make them a little firmer. They were cake-y/ biscuit-y.

Turned out perfectly.  I made individual ones, approximately 16 and scored the tops.  Super easy even though my butter wasn't frozen, just very cold.

You do not need a food processor or anything special to make these. I grated the frozen butter and mixed everything together with my hands. They were super easy and turned out great!

Fantastic. . . and easy.  I appreciated what little amount of sugar was called for in this recipe.  Also, loved the texture. Will be my "go-to" scone recipe for sure.

Wow!  These are great.  I've never made scones before and made them exactly as the recipe is written and they came out great.  I put jam on the table in case someone wanted it.  Our friends used jam but my husband and I didn’t,  so they are good either way    Very tasty.

This recipe is so simple.  I made it all in my Ninja processor with the dough-blade.  I cubed the butter instead of grating before adding it to the processor.  

I also split the dough in half and tried two types of min-ins.  I did a blueberry-orange zest scone (1/4c. dried blueberries and 1/2tsp orange zest for half the dough), and a cinnamon chip scone for the other half (1/4c. cinnamon chip for half the dough).  Both turned out great.  Will be making this recipe again soon.

Easy and delicious! I used a the fine side of my grader to grade the frozen butter. The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I baked them until they were just barely starting to brown and then glazed them with a simple powdered sugar, vanilla, and cream glaze. The graded butter really is the secret to these yummy scones!

I made this recipe using Pomegranate Craisins and Orange peel. It was delicious. I used salted butter from the fridge, cut it into the flour with a pastry cutter. This is very much the same process as you use to make pie crust, cutting in the butter to a cornmeal consistency and then adding the liquid to make balls of dough that you then make into one ball. I made two batches tonight. The first was perfect, the second had too much liquid and became sticky. Be careful how much liquid you add. The generous teaspoon of orange peel really made a wonderful orange flavor. I used my pizza cutter to cut the scones. Worked  great! For a quick glaze, I used the juice from the orange, powdered sugar, a little vanilla, and cinnamon.  It was wonderful .  These scones make a wonderful unexpected treat for any occasion. Yummy!

This is a great scone recipe. Mine come out flavorful and moist every time I follow it as I have several times now. I use a little extra sugar (and don't sprinkle any on top) and golden raisins or dates. Unlike one review I read a food processor is not necessary as it's really that hard.

Fabulous..  I only had a little sour cream so I replaced what I needed with mascarpone so it is not as tart as they would have been with the sour cream.  I like the flavor so well, that when I make it again, I will use half mascarpone  and half sour cream.

I've been making this exact recipe for many years.  I grate the frozen butter in using a simple large hole grater.  I make it exactly as the recipe states, sometimes cinnamon/raisin, sometimes lemon/blueberry or cranberry /orange.  They all are delicious.

These are really good.  I made them with blackberries, frozen and folded in last.  I put chocolate chips in the ones for my teens and he inhaled them.  Baking times was right on-about 17 minutes.  I will make these using variations in the future.  I think bacon, cheese and green onion would be good.

These are super easy to make.  I substituted yogurt for sour cream and omitted raisins. I have made it twice, the second time I divided the batter in half and cut each half in eighths.  We prefer the small ones.  Next time I will add blue berries or maybe add some cinnamon.  Highly recommend.

I did 2 things that I think were great. First, we used a half cup of chocolate chips in the scones. Second, we put a scoop of homemade ice cream on top of our scones when we served them.  Great recipe!

Fantastic recipe! I used strawberries instead of raisins. I let them sit in a bit of powdered sugar first to bring out the sweetness. I also used kefir instead of sour cream as it was all I had on hand. Great with a drizzle of white chocolate on top.

I substituted greek yogurt because I didn't have sour cream and it turned out amazing! Extra protein made it special too. I also used Truvia instead of regular sugar. Brushed off top with milk for browning effect! I t was soft and yummy!

I've made these scones countless times and they're always a hit! My dad requests scones for pretty much every holiday, or really just any time I visit my parents. Definitely don't bother mixing these by hand because, as others have said, it's so easy to whir up in the food processor. I do mix the liquid ingredients separately before adding them to the food processor, though, so I don't have to mix the entire dough quite as long. I always add vanilla to the liquid, and I've changed up the mix-ins many times. Chocolate chip scones are always a favorite, and I've made blueberry lemon, cranberry orange, etc.

Wonderful!  Have made recipe just as printed and also made it several times just tweaking for personal taste and creativity. Have shared with several friends.  Everyone always raves about my (these) scones!

Really like this base and have made these a bunch of times now.  I sub about 1/4 white whole wheat flour and use low fat sour cream.  I think my favorite flavor so far was strawberry/pecan but my husband's favorite is dark chocolate chip.  I've been meaning to try bacon/cheddar.  The moisture of fresh fruit does need to be countered with a little more flour.  I grate the butter at fridge or freezer temperature and it's messy but fine.

I made it by hand, and grated a stick of frozen butter. It wasnt such a big deal for me. 
I also used plain (organic Stonyfield) yogurt instead of sour cream, and it worked out very well! 
Added to my personal recipie binder and plan on making again, and again. Next time I will try with apples and cinnamon.

Best scone recipe I have ever tried. I always use light sour cream and I almost always make the orange cranberry ones because we really like them. As others suggest, the food processor makes it oh so easy and fast. I just made two more batches tonight.

This was great- I used the food processor, like other reviewers suggested. So quick and easy. I doubled the recipe for the processor, then split and hand mixed in fresh blueberries in one half and fresh strawberry/peach in the other half. They're perfect!

These are ridiculously good and very simple. I have no idea why the one reviewed said to not make them if you don't have a food processor, because they're really not very labor intensive at all. Maybe they're referring to the grating of the butter, but that takes all of 1 minute to do. I've tried the cranberry orange variation, and also have made them with 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead of raisins and they are EXCELLENT.

This recipe was so easy with excellent results!!! I've never made scones, so I was looking for a beginner's type recipe. I used a food processor for the butter as recommended by others.  My scones came out perfect, not dry at all!!! I just didn't cut them equally but who cared, they taste great with my homemade peach preserves. I'll be making them for my Afternoon Tea party!!!

I added lemon zest, divided the batter in half, added cranberries to one half and frozen blueberries to the other. These scones are amazing. Lime/cranberry, fresh strawberries work well

Excellent! I made two batches. For one I used cranberries instead of raisins. The second I added ground nuts and some sliced almonds with the cranberries.   I Will make these again!
Note, I made these dairy free by using margarine instead of butter and non dairy sour cream.

I I used this recipe in my classroom for the last four years. Everyone loved it!
I modified it for my food allergy by substituting Bobs Red Mill all-purpose gluten free baking mix for the regular flour. I also subbed Carbmaster Vanilla Yogurt for the sour cream. They turn out better than any other gf scone I have ever had!  I also used toasted pecan pieces and cinnamon chips in place of raisins and candy chips or zest. Excellent every time!

I made both cranberry/orange and cherry/almond. I added more of the fruit and nut ingredients than called for. My family and girlfriends loved them! As well, not difficult to make. However, I did grate the butter in a food processor the 2nd time.

I made these scones again today. This is my go-to scones recipe. I substituted stevia for the sugar with no discernible difference. Today I added dried blueberries, cranberries & raisins with some finely chopped walnuts. Wonderful. Thank you for this recipe.

To cut out some calories,  I substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream. They are still just as delicious (and now no guilt about drizzling a little confectioners sugar icing on top). This is a super easy and QUICK recipe- using a food processor, I can get them into the oven in under ten minutes. I use a Silpat instead of parchment paper.

All time go to recipe that scone recipe that we love.  I substituted sour cream with any yougurt you have.  Added orange zest and will add whatever we have to compliment them.  Blueberries, Craisins, Chocolate Chips and they are always a hit.  They are more moist than other scones, somewhat of a cookie texture but a hit none the less.

These scones were the best I have ever eaten; light and flaky, a slight crunch on the top. This will be my go-to recipe. I substituted the sour cream for greek yogurt (since it was what I had on hand) omitted the dried fruit, added cinnamon, and sprinkled on cinnamon sugar right after pulling them out of the oven. Delicious!

I made this with gluten free flour and cranberries and it still turned out pretty well. I also didn't use frozen butter but just cold refrigerated butter. Aside from that I followed the instructions to a tee and they turned out as I'd hoped

I will definitely make this again! I am a somewhat new cook and these came together so quick I was amazed! And the best part is they taste great! I love the trick of grating the frozen butter and may use that in other recipes where cold butter needs to be cut in. I opted for cranberries but didn't have an orange, and used the large decorating sugar and I LOVE them!

I did not have good raisins so I added 1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts instead.  I lightly glazed the top after baking with a mix of powdered sugar and concentrated lemon juice.  I served these at a family gathering and received many nice comments from relatives.  It is a great recipe--I do not use any appliance--just hand mixing and I use the butter straight from the refrigerator. One can add so many delicious combinations of ingredients to this easy, versatile recipe.
  A side note--I recently chopped up leftover fresh cranberries to add to this recipe and I added 2 teaspoons orange rind. Used same glaze but brown sugar instead of white. Actually excellent results. Great recipe.

Made it exactly as described, other than I forgot to put in the raisins. Best scones I've ever had. Make this recipe, seriously. Note: I put on a little icing drizzle but don't actually think they needed it. These were just the right amount of sweet without it.

I followed the recipe for the cranberry orange variation of this scone recipe, and it was perfect! They are better if you drizzle  them with a simple confectioner sugar glaze and let them sit a couple hours though, they soften a bit. 
  If you use the food processor as others have suggested, you can be eating these 30 minutes after you measure your flour, very quick and tasty treat!

Just finished my first batch and I'm amazed at how easy and how perfect they turned out!  Changed:  guessed at my sour cream amount as it was frozen, but I must have been close.  Made almond and cranberry, adding chipped, dried out marzipan, ran almonds through hand grinder then baking in oven as it heated up, added littlest pieces to dough and saved largest to press into dough before cutting.  These were better than bakery quality scones!!!  Thank you.

Fantastic!  I did as another reviewer suggested and cut my butter into my dry ingredients with my food processor. So super easy!  I would think this  recipe and method would work great for biscuits too! Just cut back the sugar and leave out the fruit, pat out the dough and use a biscuit cutter.

Delicious! It was my first time ever making scones so I followed the recipe exactly (I did NOT use a food processor like others said they did, because it does not need it). They turned out great and I made two batches at once. I can't wait to add different flavors to the next one, maybe cheese and chive.

A great recipe.  Used the processor for mixing dry ingredients and then the wet.   Later added the raisins when kneading with little flour on the counter.  Everyone love the taste and texture.  Looking forward to try other ingredients when I make these again.  A winner !

I've never had a scone before, but my family has. I made them for Father's day, yesterday. We all loved these, in fact my family told me that these were the best they ever had! Wow, what a nice compliment, and thank you for the recipe. I used a food processor, which was recommended by other reviews. And I used the currants, which I've never had  before and I like them better than raisins! Thanks again for such an awesome recipe, I will make these again!

Soooo yummy! I used plain goat yogurt instead of sour cream and gluten-free flour instead of regular. As recommended, I used a food processor. When adding the currants, I transferred the mix to a bowl and used a fork. My family loved them and had them with tea. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!

Quick, easy, all ingredients at home, and best of all: delicious! 

I used frozen blueberries instead of raisins, and Swedish "a-fil" (sour, runny yoghurt/thick milk; called "acidophilus" in the US) instead of sour cream.

I loved this recipe super fast and easy.  I used vanilla yogurt and some whole milk instead of sour scream. I also don't mix my dried ingredients and butter together too much. The key to keeping scones moist but still not cake is to not over mix it. Just at the butter and use a potato masher to mix it up until its clumpy. Also, freeze the scones for 10 min before putting them into the oven! :D

It was a great recipe, especially the cranberry orange ones!  I did change a few things. It seemed like it needed a bit more sugar, so I added a teaspoon and it made all the difference.  I also added a glaze on top made of orange juice and icing sugar, I recommend  it.

I have made these with chopped dried cherries, with dried blueberries, and with dried cranberries.  They were all delicious!  I also tried a glaze on them. Using almond flavoring makes them more like a cookie with a soft center and tender crispy crust.  Really good!  Love playing with the recipe. Addendum:  I freeze the butter and use a box grater and handle it as little as possible.  If it gets soft I put it in the freezer for a little while.

Made these three times now.  Great recipe! I like 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup rolled oats and soak and add half a cup of dried mixed berries or craisins.

This was my first time making scones. I changed the recipe a little by using a blend of whole grain flours (Bob's Red Mill 10-Grain blend mixed with coconut flour and oat flour--about 2 cups), flax meal (1/4 cup), and regular flour (about 2 cups). I also used honey instead of sugar, so the dough was too wet, and I had to add about a cup extra flour. No problem! I used craisins and about a tablespoon of orange zest. I only needed to bake them for about 13 minutes. When they were finished, I drizzled them with a simple orange glaze (1/2 t zest, 2 T fresh orange juice, 1 c powdered sugar). People loved them!

I have been looking for a good basic scone recipe for a while and now I've found it!  I didn't use a food processor as many here recommended but used cool butter that I blended with my fingers.  It took a little bit of work but the dough came together beautifully.   I also used craisins instead if raisins.  These scones are simply delicious and I will be making them again for sure.

I LOVE these and so does my family! I don't use my food processor, I find getting my hand in the dough feels great, and its not super hard. I've made them adding different ingredients, I.E.... lemon poppyseed is a fav., also using some protein powder I also used coconut yogurt instead of sour cream (lactose intolerant)....... the possibilities are endless!

Have made this several times. Great recipe. Was short on sour cream and did half sour cream, half buttermilk with the egg.  I cut the butter in with a pastry blender.  No need for a food processor. It was delicious. We like them with dried cranberries or chocolate chips.

After reading some reviews I made it in my food processor, they came out great. I used mini chocolate chips per my sons request. Next time will doc raisins and white chocolate then move on to some savory ones with cheese and chives...

For some reason I was craving scones and wanted to make some - even though I had never made them before. This recipe was so incredibly simple and easy. The only change I made was adding the "generous" teaspoon of orange rind but instead of cranberries, which I didn't have, I added about 1/3 cup chocolate chips. These scones are truly heavenly, thank you for sharing!

I substituted frozen blueberries for the raisins (since I cannot eat raisins) and made a lemon glaze to drizzle.  The scones were very tasty.

I subbed 1/3 cup chocolate chips for the raisins and used vanilla yogurt in place of sour cream since I was out.  Served with honey butter. They were great. I will be making these again very soon. Great base recipe for variations! Lemon blueberry or orange walnut are next!

I found grating the butter to be unnecessary as the butter just stuck back together as soon as I started mixing. A pastry blender would work just as well. These were absolutely tasty!

I made this by hand;  it was easy to grate in the frozen butter.  That's a great technique that I'll use in other pastry recipes.  Lacking sour cream, I substituted nonfat Greek yogurt.   I used dried blueberries, lemon zest,  and a dusting of vanilla  sugar.  They baked up flaky and tender.   My family loved them.  Try this recipe;  don't be put off by the machine recommendations.

Perfection even without raisins or other flavor additions.  I probably sprinkled 2tsp white sugar on top otherwise followed ingredient list exactly but used the easy, peasy food processor to mix everything, patted out directly on a Silpat, cut gently into eighths and then baked 17 minutes on cookie sheet.  Just now sitting with a 2nd warm scone and a fresh cuppa tea, life is good!

These were so easy to make and delicious! I didn't realize I was supposed to use frozen butter and had softened it instead, so I used a pastry blender to work the butter in. Also, my butter was salted, so I omitted the salt. I used craisins in place of the raisins in one batch and the other batch had no fruit. They turned out perfect and all of the women at my Bible study wanted the recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Followed the recipe except I used frozen blueberries with lemon zest for one batch and frozen cranberries with orange zest for the other batch and they both turned out amazing!  I sprinkled a little sugar on top and put a sliver of butter on top so the sugar Carmelites as it makes for a delicious topping since I don't put any kind of glaze/frosting on them.

These scones were delicious and very easy.  I made them in a food processor as recommended by others.  I bake quite a bit, but this was my first attempt at scones.  I added dried cranberries and about a tablespoon of cinnamon (because I love cinnamon).  They were very simple and fast and turned out great.

This was my first time ever making this. I like it, but it came out a little bland and dry. I didn't have any raisins to put it in. I did have chocolate chips, but remembered them after I already had them in the oven. So next time, I think I'll try several different things; such as strawberries with whipped cream, chocolate chips in half the batter,  and raisins in the other half.

There's always next time! Cie la vie!

came out pretty good anyway!!

I would highly recommend this recipe for anyone, like myself, who has never made scones before. A friend who use to be a chef and knows how much I like to cook suggested I try to make scones. I was a like nervous at the thought but after using this recipe I am glad I did.

Great recipe. Simple and delicious. I made the orange/cranberry variety. Like one reviewer, I used melted butter and mixed it in with the wet ingredients. I was scared at first because only one reviewer had done it but I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. In my opinion, the extra effort required to use grated frozen butter isn't worth the slight difference (if any) in texture.

I made these exactly as the recipe called, however I omitted the raisins and just made them plane with a little sugar so that I could have them with jam and marmalade. They turned out amazing. I did not use frozen butter but extremely cold refrigerated butter. I had no problem getting the dough to work. I will make these over and over. I'm not sure what other reviewers meant by the Dough being messy, I had very little mess to clean up and the Dough was very easy to use.

So easy to make and takes no time at all! I tweaked this recipe a bit. My husband seemed to think the first time I made these, they came off a bit dry.  So, instead of raisins, I used fresh blueberries and a squeeze of fresh lemon.  Then I covered with a lemon buttercream drizzle (per my hubby's request). They were a big hit with my boys! Love making these for weekend brunch!

This is the first and only scone recipe i've tried. I've made cranberry, pecan, and chocolate chip. Simple and delicious recipe. One tip I have is if you like a less moist more crumbly scone, mix your dough way less, like almost undermixed. When i knead the dough a little more the scones are slightly cakey which is my personal preference.

Delicious and very easy.  No kneading required.  These were fluffier and easier to work with than the Grandma Johnson's Scones recipe.  I doubled the recipe and made two circle-loaves without incident.  Highly recommended.

Absolutely love this recipe. I passed it to my family and friends and its very popular now. Two things I learned to keep in mind. 1. Use refrigerated butter, not from freezer because they wont turn out soft. Refrigerated mixes way better with flour. 2. Don't over-press it in bowl. Be very gentle. The dough doesn't have to look like cookie dough - all smooth.

i made a couple changes.  I added grated orange peel from one orange to the batter and I always make a mixture of cream/milk and sugar and brush it on the top of the scones.  It makes a nice glaze when baked.

This is an excellent recipe  and I will make it again!

This is my kind of scone! Biscuit-like, quick and easy in mixer. The first time I forgot to mix the orange zest in with the craisins, so I just put it on top with the sugar, and it was great! Made it again, with lemon extract, lemon zest and craisins--and liked it even better! I also like to use plain Greek yogurt.

Quick easy and fun!  I added mini chocolate chips to my first batch and today I'm going to make a double batch for the family since I'm traveling for work this next week.  Needless to say, they were a big hit!  Thanks for a quick, easy, delicious recipe!

I'm just repeating others' reviews, but this was a snap in my food processor. Took 5-10 min tops. I folded in fresh blueberries as I patted out the dough, before I cut them. So easy and so good! Kids gobbled them up.

This recipe is perfect. I have contemplated putting a tad bit more sugar but they turn out just sweet enough to eat with my coffee. I did not freeze my butter but instead creamed it at room temperature with the sugar and sour cream mixture then slowly incorporated the flour while mixing with my hand mixer, then eventually mixing the last 2 cups of flour with my spatula (I made a double batch), and eventually finishing off with my hands. I will make this again and again!!!!

This is a great recipe - it came out great and allows for basic changes!  I chose to use cold butter (not frozen) and cubed it, instead of grating.  Worked it into the dough with a fork - old school style.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.  Since I was going for an orange flavor, I also added apprx 1 tsp of grated rind and 1 Tbsp or fresh orange juice.  Also topped with an orange glaze icing.  Yum yum!!

I made them by hand and they came out amazing!!! I didn't think about freezing the butter so I simply cut it into small cubes and mixed it into the flour using a pastry blender. 
I use to make scones before using 1 whole cup of heavy cream ( imagine the fat content) but I like these much better!!!! Totally a keeper!!! Can't wait to try out the other variations!!

This is the recipe my mom uses, and now ive started using too. We follow the first four steps and then instead of rolling them out just take bunches and plop them on the parchment paper. They rise up nice and fluffy. I have made them using sour cream or plain yogurt and they are delicious either way!

I made these scones as written out the first time last week and found they were delicious as is. Tonight I decided to add additional ingredients.  Besides the raisins, I put in 1/4 cup of blackberries (very messy) and ~1/4 cup of sliced almonds. I had to put in additional flour to compensate for the added moisture from the blackberries. They came out moist and delicious. Next time, I'll use blueberries! Yum!

Throughout the years I've made several scone recipes.  I left scones alone for many months then decided to try again and made this recipe.  I sent a couple of scones to my mom and sister and my mom called me and said that these were the best scones I've ever made.  I tried grating the butter once but find that it's too messy.  Instead I put the butter in the freezer for a few minutes then cut it into small pieces and use a pastry tool to work it in a little but because the butter is hard, it doesn't turn into breadcrumbs and I leave it alone and it still comes out good.

This is a great basic scone recipe. I've added cranberries and white chocolate chips, frozen blueberries, currants, and they turn out very well every time.  I brush mine with milk and sprinkle coarse sugar on top, it's a nice crunch of sweetness, instead of adding any frosting.  I will make these again and again!

Simple recipe (made just as stated the first time) and great results! Tried the orange/cranberry suggestion this time and cut them into 16 smaller scones to take to a family dinner. I will be using this recipe again and again.

Sprinkled a bit on cinnamon to top. Grating the butter wasn't sooo bad. No need for a food processor if you don't have one (which I don't).

It is very nice scone. Even though it is too sweet for me. I guess I am more a biscuit person :-). This is good for a afternoon tea to substitute cakes. Very satisfying.

Wow! This recipe is delicious. Got a little messy mixing with your hands, but worth it. I put chocolate chips & coconut in mine. With a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Then sprinkled cinnamon on top. Dipped the cooked scones in a powdered sugar & cinnamon frosting. Yumm!!

I WILL make these again! I've had lots of trouble with scones in the past. These are perfect! 
I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and I believe 8T of butter is equivalent to 1/2C. I loved the idea of using a grater to cut up the butter. 
This was 'fast & furious, but fabulous!' (My motto)

I've made this recipe literally once a week since it was first published in USA Today.  It's not the traditional British scone (which is drier) - it's more of an American cream scone.  I use the large holes of a box grater to get the butter just right, and I haven't had any trouble doing these completely by hand.    If you're not going to eat them all on the day they're baked they're great frozen and then thawed and warmed in the toaster.

Instead of raisins, I added half a cup of both dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.  Really good!  I usually dislike trying to "cut-in" butter/flour mixture but the technique of grating frozen butter works fabulously!!!  Light and fluffy...will definitely make again!

Love this recipe! I made cranberry  orange and I  did a frosting drizzle. So easy and so yummy. Why couldn't you grate the butter first then freeze it , like a few hours before prepared? I grated mine on a mandolin slicer, be careful.

I didn't have sour cream, so replaced it with 2% greek yogurt. Also, omitted baking soda and doubled baking powder. Replaced raisins with chopped frozen dark sweet cherries and dark chocolate chips, as well as added orange zest. I make scones regularly where I work and this recipe turned out very similarly. I always make them by hand, no processor as the friction will soften the bits of butter and make for a tougher dough. I probably will not make again as I prefer the recipe at work that uses no egg. Though this was still good.

Like some reviewers said, it was tasty but the texture is more cake-like.  It was so easy to achieve with food processor.  Here is my procedure: 1) put all the dry ingredients including orange zest (if any) into the bowl and mix. 2) just roughly stir in raisins or cranberries and make sure they are coated with flour individually and not clumped. 3) cut in butter. It is fine to have little butter pieces. 4) add in sour cream/egg mixture and mix till a dough form with some but not much gluten. Don't overmix. 5) flour a 8" springform pan and pat the dough in. 6) flour a workbench and dump the dough from the pan upside down to the workbench to smoothen the top. 7) move it back to the pan and chill for 15 minutes (frozen butter will creat more steam which will help to puff up later when baked). 8) move it out onto a floured workbench and sprinkle 1 tsp sugar on top. 9) slice and bake for 14 minutes. I used 125 gm plain flour + 46 gm oat flour + 56 gm whole wheat flour to replace the 250 gm all purpose flour.  My girl and my mother in law like the orange cranberry version very much while my huppy like the traditional raisin version more. He likes the wheat flavor. Note: you may want to reduce the sugar used if using sweetened dried cranberry.

Best. Scones. Ever. These are unbelievable as-is. I always add a touch of vanilla out of habit, but it is not necessary. They come out perfect every time. I've made these 6 or 7 times and they are always wonderful, regardless of which flavors I use. Fantastic!

I read one review (before I made the recipe) that said the result was too cakey. I couldn't agree more. In my mind this is not the consistency a scone should have. Taste is ok. But could use a tad more sugar.

Delicious! Easy to make without freezing the butter.....I cut cold butter in by hand with a pastry cutter. You do not need a food processor at all. I made cranberry orange and glazed with orange zest glaze instead of sprinkling sugar.  The egg sour cream mixture was a great ingredient instead of cream/milk. Yum!

Absolute 5 star recipe and I feel they are accident proof!  They are perfect as is, but my favorites are when I really change the recipe and make many healthier high protein, high fiber, little to no processed ingreds.  I have made these countless times and I rarely make the same way twice.  I always make in my food processor bc important to use the butter while still frozen.  I'm always sharing these and everyone raves about them and my husband never tires of them.
I always substitute 1 cup of white flour with 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and replace the 2nd cup of flour (this is where is its creative and accident proof so far) with 1/3 ground flax seed, 1/3 cup oat bran, 1/3 cup steel cut oats,...etc, just to total 1 full cup.  Then 2 scoops vanilla protein powder. Instead of processed sugar, I use pure maple syrup along with the wet ingreds and a teaspoon of vanilla extract.
I often substitute the sour cream with plain greek yogurt.
I add raisins, chopped dates, any dried berries, chopped figs...really anything you like and always add more than the recipe calls for because I love lots of fruit in mine.
My new favorite addition is 3-4 tablespoons matcha green tea powder for that extra antioxidant kick.
I LOVE THESE!!!!

I made a batch of these for an unexpected guest. They were so good, I made another right away. It is super easy and quick, 20 minutes to make, 20 to bake. I did it without a processor. I think using one is extra work, especially on clean up. Grating the butter is a great idea! I used a bag of salad toppings I had: glazed nuts and cranberries. Delish.

This is a great recipe.  I skipped the raisins and added fresh frozen raspberries. As they bake the juice favors the whole scone.  A great recipe  to throw together quickly if company drops in.

Wonderful recipe. I read all the other reviews about grating the butter and here is what I came up with. I take a cold stick of butter from the fridge and grate it - takes 2 seconds, and all I have to wash is the grater. I put that butter in the freezer while I get the ingredients out and assembled. Mix in butter and the hundreds of different combos of add ins (thanks all for the ideas) and add the liquid. I do the first mix with a forks as the poster suggested and then use my hands to get it to a ball. It is loose but all that butter melts and holds everything together. Today was milk chocolate and cinnamon chips with some extra cinnamon added to the dry. My best combo yet. Thanks!

I had never made scones before and these were fabulous.  I took the butter right out of the fridge instead of the freezer and it was fine.  I also tried another reviewer's advice and just threw the ingredients in my food processor.  So easy.  I made plain, and then threw the bottom of a bag of white chocolate chips in a batch.  Both were delicious.  I can't wait to try different flavour combos. They are sticky so the parchment paper on your cookie sheet is key!

I tried melting the butter as another reviewer suggested.  So much easier.  Made the whole wheat version suggested by another reviewer with slight modifications (based on what was in my cupboard) - 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flower, 1/4 cup wheat germ, 1/4 oat bran.  Not all my attempts to substitute whole wheat go well, but this one turned out great.  Used chocolate chips.

Really delicious. Grating the butter teally helps to incorporate it if you don't use a food processor. I made them without adding fruit, but made fresh whipped cream and had them with cream and apricot preserves!

great recipe!  Try using powdered sugar instead of flour when rolling out the dough.  You don't need icing and it gives the scones a tender sweet crunch on the outside.  This recipe is easy to be creative, I've made cinnamon white chocolate chip, pumpkin, chocolate chip just use your imagination it'll be great!

I've tried a lot of scone recipes.  This is by far the best one.  Very light and tender.  I made mine with lemon zest, fresh blueberries and a simple lemon juice powdered sugar glaze.  Everyone in my family thought they were incredible.  I will use it from now on.

These were so easy to make and came out great. I used lemon zest and Craisins. I did everything in my Ninja. I served them with strawberry jam and English clotted cream. Hubby ate two. I can't wait to make them again. Mini chocolate chips will be next.

This is one of my old stand-by recipes.  I make at least three times a year, usually in the summer.

I was blessed by inspiration to chop up and add a half cup of left-over trail mix my family seemed to have lost interest in.  While making this current batch it suddenly occurred to me that adding a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon would be a nice touch (It was probably my Kitchen Angel - Thank you, Kitchen Angel!)  It really brought all the flavors together.  This recipe is going into my collection for good!

This recipe is very easy and the ingredients come together once the egg mixture is added.  
I substituted sugar with Splenda and omitted the raisins and added raspberry extract for a layer of flavor.  This will compliment nicely when the fresh jam is added at time of eating.

I made this recipe for some friends with one modification: I used a heavy cream-milk-lemon juice mixture to substitute for sour cream, because I did not have any on-hand. I divided the batter in half, reulting in two batches: orange-chocolate chip and strawberries and cream scones. For the strawberries and cream version, I used food-processor-minced frozen strawberries. Because the strawberries were frozen, the yielded scones were more moist (something like a scone-cake hybrid), which I topped with a milk-powdered sugar glaze drizzle. The orange-chocolate chip scones (made with orange zest) maintained the typical consistency and texture of a scone (i.e. slightly dry), which would go well with tea. All in all, they came out well!

I add the zest of one lemon to the sour cream mixture and use frozen blueberries as my fruit. I cook the round for most of the time and then cut it into triangles and continue cooking so that it is moist and the middle gets cooked.

I love these! The only thing I change is adding a little bit of cinnamon and a few more raisins. They always come out delicious.

I used dried cranberry to make the scones. The turn out was great, crunchy on the onside and moist inside. The only challenge I had was to grate the butter in this summer weather. butter melts too fast, making it hard to grasp and grate. in the end I simply used a fork to cut small pieces of butter into the mixture, and followed it with hand mix. I like the simplicity of this recipe. I will try tune the taste with other mixtures (onion & salt, nuts etc) later. thanks for sharing!

Loved these! I made them in my food processor, and then added blueberries instead of raisins. I finished them with a drizzle of powdered sugar glaze. Yummy!

This recipe is great.  I prepared the dry ingredients before bed, then finished the recipe in the early morning. Friends at work loved them!  Made just as written; then a second time with cranberries and orange zest.

After making as is, (they were delicious but time consuming), I've altered the recipe to make it more user friendly. I simply cut the cold butter into little pieces and cut it into the dough.  I also melted it once and mixed it in with no adverse effects to the recipe.  So the grated butter step can go. I also now use Greek lemon or vanilla yogurt in place of the sour cream.  We make these a couple times a month.  They never last passed them morning we gobble them up!

I made it using blueberries on Wednesday.  It is Satudary and I have made the recipe three times... It is delicious!!!  For the non scone lovers, to the scone friends, to the not to sweet, but need something, this is it.  I cannot wait to try it with other fruits.  I make a lot of desserts, and cakes, these you really should double the recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing ( my daughter, family, and friends thank you too!)!!!

Made this recipe as shown, but added a diced apple and a teaspoon of cinnamon. Wow. I won't bother trying another recipe. Ever. Fantastic. I didn't use a food processor but cut room temp butter into the dry ingredients with a pastry cutter. They were flakey and not at all dry.

Everyone loved these! I made two batches; one with almond extract and raisins and the other with chocolate chips. Tried the butter both ways (frozen or not) and the batch with the refrigerated butter came out better.

So good - cut butter in (do not use mixer) so the scones remain dense and flakey. I added almond extract and dried cranberries? They were delicious..

I had never made scones before and was asked to make scones by a friend.  Everyone loved them.  I did leave out the raisins as my son doesn't like them.  I did add 1tsp of cinnamon  Other than that I kept the recipe as is..

I didn't like the raisins in it but I can't wait to try something else.  And it looks like a lot of work but it's not. I'll never grate the butter again though. What a mess! Simply cutting it in would work just fine.

I tried this recipe and was surprised at how easy it was. I am not a baker but love scones. I used dried blueberries and added a little vanilla extract. I think I would add a little more sugar or substitute Brown sugar next time. I let my butter get to room temperature then added to the flour mixture. (No problem without the grated frozen way) These were really good and had a moisteness I liked. Thanks for the recipe!

Super Terrific Recipe and I used a Gluten Free flour mix!!!  Substituting these flours can yield mixed results but these were great. I used my dough hook to help mix, since I don't have a food processor.  I also added a few raspberries, since I love them.  For those of us with celiac disease or others who cannot tolerate gluten finding a recipe that adapts well is a gem!

So easy, so tender and flaky! Mine didn't turn out very moist like some other people's but they were just what I expected (except flakier, yum!) and were delicious with some butter on them :) Made them within less than 40 minutes in food processor, and that includes clean-up time!

I cut the butter into a 1/2" cubes before freezing them. I mixed the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and butter cubes in a food processor. I used butter milk instead of sour cream. The results were amazing! Very simple yet versatile recipe!

Excellent basic scone recipe. It was my first time making scones but they came out really well and my family loved them. I used cold salted butter so i ommited the salt and used coconut milk instead of sour cream. They were perfect.

Just out of the over the cranberry and lemon scones. I put a little extra sugar in and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I also brushed the top with buttermilk that I had and sprinkled the with sugar before they went into the oven. Also I soaked the fruit in hot water first to plump it up and drained.Had to use a little extra flour then as it was too moist.  I cooked it at 350 for about 18 mins. Very delicious!!! I have others in the oven that I followed the recipe a little more closely but did use buttermilk instead of the sour cream. I'll let you know how that is. Kids love them... with butter of course.

i reduced the flour to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup quick cooking oats. i also cut back on the sugar and added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to the dry mixture. i substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream and added a little milk and a little vanilla extract. they turned out very well! although grating the butter early in the morning does seem to be time consuming, i'll definitely use this recipe again. if i had a food processor for this size recipe, i would definitely go that route.

Wonderful. These came out perfectly! I am a huge scone fan, but had never made them myself before this. I added cherry juice infused craisins and white chocolate pieces in lieu of the raisins.

This recipe is easy & very tasty.  I just used it make pumpkin scones with butterscotch & white choc chips.  I forgot the egg without it effecting the outcome. But the pumpkin & sour cream totaled 3/4c so I added quite a bit of flour & chips on the board. Made glaze with 10x, pumpkin pie coffee creamer & almond extract. Got 24 scones. Its a keeper!

I made these scones and they were absolutely amazing!! I did change it up a bit though. Instead of sour cream, I used buttermilk. Instead of raisins, I used frozen blueberries. It was a bit messy, but they turned out amazingly light, fluffy, and moist. I wish I had taken a photo of them, but they didn't last long enough for me to get a photo of them. Haha!! Also, a hint: If you find yourself in a pickle (like I did) without an egg, you can substitute 2 TBS of Water, 1 TBS of Vegetable or Canola oil, and 2 tsp of baking powder, trust me...no one will notice the difference!! :) Enjoy!!

I love this recipe! You don't need a food processor, just take the chilled butter and work it into the flour with your hands. Instead of adding white sugar I added brown sugar, and Instead of raisins I added dried cherries and cinnamon, I brought them to a tea party and they were gone within minutes. This scone recipe goes great with the Devanshire cream recipe. I'm going to make more scones tomorrow!

This is an awesome scone recipe! It is my goto scone recipe -  So fast, easy and adaptable when done in the food processor! Made the recipe as is - just changed up the berries and nut additions. The family loves them and they disappear very quickly!

These scones are amazing. I follow the recipe but I add pecan's or blueberries instead. I have read some reviews and I'm going to try some other add in's. I'm obsessed with these I make them all the time. Oh I also use my food processor instead of grating the cheese.

I made this today and within an hour they were all gone. I used cranberries instead of raisins and used the good processor as other reviewers suggested. I also used brown sugar instead if white sugar. They came out really great. I have a request to make more.

These scones were delicious, but they were a little cookie-ish to me. I baked mines without raisins, and instead blended up some strawberries in the batter. Strawberry scones are nice, give it more of a breakfast taste.

I make this recipe all the time. I alternate between using creme fraiche for the sour cream. I love the richness it adds. Also I change raisins for other things often balancing liquids for fruits. They are always delicious!

This was my first time making scones and it was much easier than I expected. I used  frozen cherries that I pitted the night before and 1/2 tsp of almond extract. I will definitely use this recipe over and over again. Can't wait to try more variations.

These were okay. I have only made a couple of other types of scones in my life and they were way more flaky like and rich tasting. These were more like a slightly cakey overly-sweet biscuit. The tops of them appeared more bumpy than smooth to for some reason. I suppose, because of the stickiness of the dough. I think heavy cream, instead of sour cream, is the only way to go with scones. Only change I made was using golden raisins instead of regular. I just like their flavor lately. For some reason mine darkened on the bottom rather quickly despite baking on parchment. They went from underdone to overdone, on the bottom, in only about 2 minutes time. Towards the end I would keep an eye on them.

Very forgiving recipe.  I didn't have enough sour cream this time so I substituted coconut yogurt of all things... still came out fantastic.

These are very easy to make, and tasted wonderful. We made them with fresh blueberries and lemon zest.  The fresh blueberries did make them stick to the parchment paper a bit, but the flavor of the fresh blueberries was worth it.

Easy with a food processor.  I didnt freeze the butter.  Cakier texture but still great. Don't need to lower the rack on my oven.  Cooking time is accurate.

Perfect texture and flavor.  I omitted the currants because I didn't have any on hand, and added 2 teaspoons of almond extract.  Topped them off by drizzling a delicate glaze made up of 1/4 cup orange juice and 1 cup powdered sugar whisked together.  This is an excellent base recipe that can be adapted for numerous add-ins and flavor variations.  A food processor definitely comes in handy for mixing these together.  This will be a definite keeper!

Melts in your mouth! I made these without any of the dried fruit and they were delicious.  They would make a fabulous strawberry shortcake.

I didn't have any sour cream, so I used a 5.3 ounce cup of peach Greek yogurt instead, and they turned out wonderfully! I also sprinkled a tiny bit of sugar on top of the scones before baking them.

These were moist on the inside, they didn't rise much and were more flat--not light and flaky like other scone recipes. On the other hand, it was very flavorful.

I just made these this a.m. Fantastic! I substituted cream cheese for sour cream, fresh strawberries for the raisins and added white chocolate chips. 20 minutes at 400°F for that golden brown crust...and yes, the food processor was a godsend! Enjoy! Tomorrow, I am using fresh banana and chocolate chips. Thanks all!

Great recipe and easy to alter, if needed.  And boy, did I need to! I altered the recipe to include using leftover Cherry pie filling.  Left out the sour cream and the raisins.  Did everything else as was called for.  Was very moist and delicious!

I hosted a Mothers Day Tea this Mother's Day and I couldn't find scones in our local bakery, I built up the courage and attempted this recipe!  I wasn't sure if my family would approve, but one of my brothers who "Hates Scones!" Absolutely loved them,as did the rest of the family. I see that others used their food processor to mix it, I thought it was a piece of cake, and that's coming from a NON BAKERY! Haha, I followed the recipe, and added cinnamon to the remaining sugar and sprinkled it on top and added white chocolate chips.
I will definitely be making more in the near future.

Of all of the recipes that I have tried from allrecipes over the years, this is our very favorite.  When prepared as written, it delivers foolproof, wonderful, flakey scones.  Every time I make them, my husband gets a dreamy look in his eye and says that I should open a bakery.  Now that I've been making them so regularly, I use the base to make my own variations, such as lemon poppyseed.  For the reviewers who say that this recipe is labor intensive, I feel just the opposite.  I am able to hop out of bed, throw the ingredients in a bowl, mix by hand just a little and have a hot homemade breakfast for my family so quickly.  I LOVE these scones.

I doubled the sour cream and they were deeeeeeeeeliciousss!!!
They are also good with chocolate chips instead of raisons and also try cutting one into 2 halves and toasting and then sprinkling cinnamon sugar on top. They are really good!

This is the BEST scone recipe I have EVER tried! I have made these scones many times and they always turn out perfect! If I am making these for a party, I like to spilt the batch in to two balls and make 16 mini scones. I never sprinkle them with sugar, but I do like to make Devonshire cream to go on them. It is Heavenly! I also like to try different mix-ins. The suggested variations are great, but my favorite is mixing in mini chocolate chips! Yum!

I just finished making these, substituting dried cherries for the currants. They were dense like you'd expect a scone to be, yet light and buttery. I did sift my ingredients, so I'm not sure if that had any effect on my batch. They were so easy and quick to make up, and I'm sure they'd impress guests.

This is a fantastic recipe! Rather than using a food processor, I cut cold butter into cubes and used a pastry cutter to incorporate into flour mixture. I didn't have sour cream so I used vanilla Greek yogurt. The scones turned out light, moist and fluffy. Very delicious!

This recipe is wonderful I love to bake and i made these scone for a church breakfast and they were a hit.they were so good that a few people placed orders for a few dozen.the scones were moist and tasty and it lends itself well to any add on you would to try . I just made it today and added poppy seeds and switch out the vanilla for lemon peel and juice and it was wonderful.

I have made these scones for breakfast whenever we have company, which is often, and always get rave reviews. My personal favorite is to use cherries with almond extract. I use a pastry cutter to work in the butter and it is much easier. Definitely recommend this recipe!

I make these almost weekly. I use light butter and nonfat yogurt to make them healthier. Many variations are delicious. I like tropical (coconut extract and dried tropical fruit), cranberry almond, & white chocolate cherry the best

My kids and I love the scones! I needed to add more moisture to the recipe because of the weather in NJ today, so I added a little bit of orange juice. I did not have any raisins, I added sliced almonds in place of them. I will be making this recipe again and again, but will add other ingredients to change it up. Thank you for posting the recipe!!!!

This recipe was super easy! Very yummy and perfect with the Easy Clotted Cream. I did leave out the raisins as I am not a big fan of them in baked goods...I think I will substitute blueberries my next batch. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I loved this recipe and used light cream instead of sour cream and it was great. I've also used craisins instead of currants (delicious) and once omitted them and just added the zest from an orange which was just as good (I've done it with lemon zest as well when I replaced the currants). Great basic recipe that is adaptable and easy. I also used my food processor which took half the time.

We love these, we do not have a food processor and did not feel they were too much work, The first time we added orange zest and choc. chips, those tasted much better cold. So many ways to try them today its orange zest and cherry craisins. Yum!

This was OK.  I'm going to change it up next time using Tyler Florence's scone recipe from Food Network.  I'm going to drop the egg and the sour cream and use 1 cup of heavy cream instead.  The texture will be less cakey.

Tried this recipe today and it turned out great.  Made a few modifications, instead of sugar I used maple crunches , also added one teaspoon of lemon extract to the egg sour cream mixture.  What a great compliment to the raisins.
Also, added a little lemon extract to the powdered sugar and milk, for the icing.  Fun to make...I will definitely use this recipe again.  Kallie

This recipe it's fantastic!  I did not have any problems using cold butter and a metal pastry blender, as I do not have a food processor.  I have now made these in many different variations...dried fruit, frozen fruit...it's all delicious!  So easy and they are eaten up within hours!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Best ever basic scone recipe! I omit the dried fruit and add 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips instead. Makes an awesome dessert plain or served with vanilla ice cream.

Excellent recipe! Don't over mix though. The scones are light and fluffy. I added almond extract and orange extract along with Cherry Craisins. I brushed the tops with milk and sprinkled raw sugar crystals on top; no need for frosting of any kind. The scones were devoured immediately!

Love these & so does my family!  This is a relatively easy recipe. The dough seemed crumbly At first.. I almost added an extra egg.. But refrained and I was glad i did. The more you work the dough it comes together. I replaced the raisins with dried cranberries and added lemon zest.... Will definitely make These again!

It seems to be important to follow the technique exactly as described, mix by hand.  Substitutes in ingredients don't seem to matter that much.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and it turned out really great.  Added dried black currants instead of raisins, a bit more fancy.  I will absolutely make them again!

I really, really enjoyed this recipe! My boyfriend loves the scones and keeps asking me to make more. I didn't change anything in the recipe except the add-ins. The firs time I used raisins and the second time I tried raspberries. This recipe is awesome. I will keep using it-next time I'm adding butterscotch! Yumm!

These are quite good. I eschewed both the cheese grater AND the food processor and instead used a pastry cutter to cut the cold butter pieces into the flour mixture. Quick, easy to do this way. I added chocolate chips (instead of raisins) for my husband, who loves chocolate chip scones.

First time making scones. I used refrigerated salted butter (was all I had at the moment) and I used 1/2 sugar instead and added raspberries and white chocolate. They were absolutely yummy! They were gone within hours of making them. I'm making more today, ham and cheddar :)

I love this recipe . They're moist and turn out perfect every time .. Although I did change a couple things . I usually add blueberries not dried fruit . I double the sugar and I add 2 tsp of cinnamon to compliment the Blueberries. I also use frozen Margarine . Family and friends ask for them over and over . I hope u enjoy them as we all do .

Just made these. They are delicious! These are cake-like, not your typical scones. I left the raisins out and added 1 cup blueberries (stir these in last) and the zest of 1 lemon to the batter. I don't have a food processor so cut the cold butter into small cubes and cut it into the dry ingredients with a pastry blender. After the scones cooled I drizzled glaze on them (lemon juice, 10x sugar, unsalted butter, lemon zest). I will make them again, trying other flavors.

Fantastic! For those who do not have large food processors:
I cut my butter into little slices/pats before freezing. Next day, mixed my dry ingredients in my stand mixer; diced my frozen butter (honestly takes less than 2 min; it doesn't need to be perfect but just small bits of butter) with a knife and slowly mixed it into the dry. Used my hand to squeeze it together a bit more and followed the rest of the recipe as is. Not too much clean up and I added cranberries and orange zest and they were wonderful - not too sweet!

Had no problem making these by hand. I increased the baking soda to 1/2t. I've used the basic recipe and added 2t of cinnamon and mini cinnamon chips, dried blueberries, orange zest and dried cranberries, and lemon zest and poppy seeds. It's amazingly versatile.

Made these with a chocolate/coconut twist and they were a hit.
First I substituted 1/2 C of cake flour for a 1/2 C of All Purpose flour.  Then I added to the dry mix ~1/2 C of mini chocolate chips and ~1/2 C of sweetened shredded coconut.  To the wet mix I added a teaspoon of coconut extract.  Thought they were better than the StickyFinger mix from World Market.

I loved this recipe.  I did not have sour cream but used an equal measure of Ohobani Blueberry Yogurt and they turned out great.  I loved the hint about using the shredder to cut up the butter as this was the part I never did well before.  YUMMY!

My neighbor made these and they were awesome!  i asked her for the recipe and was amazed at how easy these were to make.  i followed the reviews and used a food processor.   WOW!  i don't even bake and these were perfect!  i did cut them smalled (pretty much did 16 slices instead of 8) and i only baked them for 10 minutes.  PERFECTION!!!!!  i also did a glaze on top and loved them.  tried the blueberry lemon and cranberry orange....can't wait to try more combinations!

THESE ARE GOOD!MINE TURNED OUT A BIT CAKEY BUT VERY VERY MOIST! I ADDED A TSP OF ALMOND EXTRACT,DRIED CHERRIES AND SPRINKLES SOME SLICED ALMOND OVER THE TOP BEFORE BAKING! I MIGHT TRY A DIFFERENT RECIPE JUST TO COMPARE THE TEXTURE OVERALL A GOOD RECIPE....

Amazing scone recipe! My first time making it and I followed the recipe to the tee, except I used blueberries instead of raisins. I'm not typically a big baker, but I took other peoples' advice to use the food processor and they were right- it made a huge difference. Especially after you grate the butter, it did a nice job of mixing everything together well. Everything was perfectly blended in seconds, with just a few pulses. Delicious scones. Thx for all the tips! Would definitely make it again.

Incredible!  These scones are moist have a wonderful buttery flavor.  I have made this recipe at least 20-30 times, most of them by request from people who I've made it for before.  It has gotten rave reviews every single time.

In place of using a box grater for the butter, I cut butter straight from the refrigerator into the flour mix with a pastry knife.  I don't find it to be too much work at all.  Cranberry with orange zest is one of my favorites, but I can't wait to experiment more and more!

My first try at making scones, and it went great! I used the beckygentile variation because I had chocolate chips, and more sour cream and sugar sounded good to me! I doubled the batch and just used a whole bag of regular chips instead of minis. I didn't need to flour the surface I put the dough on, and actually had a little pile of flour left over in the bowl, so I'll probably do scant cups next time. The texture was amazing with the extra sour cream and I can't wait to make them again!

Dan's new favorite scone recipe! He likes it even better than the grandma's scone recipe. I think it is a bit less cakey and less sweet. I like both scone recipes. We added raisins to this one. Use the food processor (don't try to grate the butter!).

these are so amazing! if i could give them more stars I would. I make the recipe exactly as is and they turn out perfectly every time. I usually make it just with raisins but i tried the cranberry orange flavour and it still was delicious! i can't wait to try other combinations with this recipe!

I made the orange/cranberry version this morning.  They were delicious; slightly moist, light and flakey.  I did add a little vanilla and some additional orange juice to the sour cream/egg mixture to total 3/4 cup of wet ingredients.  I made a glaze of melted butter, orange juice and powdered sugar to spread on top.  Husband just loved them.  Can't go wrong with a Pam Anderson recipe!

Everyone loves these. I make the cherry almond. The only minor change I have made is, I simmer the dried fruit with a little water and sugar (I never measure) then drain the fruit and let the outside dry a bit. They are more like fresh fruit then in the scones. Also, I used 3/4 tsp almost extract. They turn out perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

They are quick and easy to make: my recommendation is to chop up the butter, then cut it in with a pastry blender rather than a fork (I suppose the recipe's silliness on grating frozen butter is what made those before me turn to food processors!)  I substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream (same taste and texture, but so much healthier), and used frozen wild blueberries instead of raisins, and they are fabulous!

This recipe rocks! So simple and quick and were a big hit at my baby shower. Agree with others that without a food processor this would be more difficult. One slight change after making one batch is that I moved the tray to the center rack. Thank you I will definitely make these again!

I followed this recipe with one minor change - instead of raisins, I used dried cranberries. Served with lemon curd these scones are to die for! Soon after discovering this delicious treat, my son was diagnosed with Celiac disease and he thought he'd never get to eat these again. I tested a batch with gluten free baking mix and had fantastic results! I don't own a food processor and all my baking is done by hand - with great success I might add.  If you're going to bake these delicious scones, remember - don't forget the lemon curd!!!

This recipe was awesome. I don't have a food processor as others suggested, I made them old fashioned style, no technology and they were still great. The first time I made them I added walnuts and dried cranberries. They were awesome.

Made the orange and cranberry version. Followed the recipe exactly. Will add more cranberries next time.  Used the zest of almost the entire (medium size) orange.  The hint of orange was great. Very good!

Just made again and this time I used my kitchen aide   I will definitely go back to doing it by hand. Not much harder and I felt like I overworked my dough with the mixer.  Also tried with fresh cranberries. Will toss them in sugar next time. Were pretty tart.

Just finished this recipe substituting frozen Maine Blueberries for the raisins.  Awesome taste and texture, the blueberries were still frozen when I folded them into dry ingredients.  I also tried cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on top.  I will make these again.  Also, want to note that I followed the recipe as described(I did not use a food processor) and did not find it anymore difficult or time consuming than a biscuit recipe.

Very easy recipe! These turned out great. I cheated and used my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix these. Grating the butter was super easy. Didn't feel like it took any longer than cutting it into pieces. I added dried blueberries, lemon zest and slivered almonds for one batch and diced peaches and cream cheese for the other.  Both turned out great! Everyone enjoyed them.

This recipe is fantastic.  I have been making it for years as written with almond extract and cranberries instead of raisins.  When I went to make the last batch I realized I was out of sour cream so I substituted vanilla greek yogurt and the recipe still turned out great!!!

This is a brilliant recipe! I replaced one of the cups of flour with ground almonds and used maraschino cherries instead of raisins.... totally delish, although they didnt hold there shape brilliantly...I think they were of a slightly wetter consistency than is the norm for scones, maybe I should have used one and a half cups of flour and half a cup of ground almonds??? I cut it into triangles, which you could still tell when they were finished but if I had have used a round cookie cutter I think they would have looked very messy! I will make these again but in a bigger batch next time. Thanks for this excellent and very easy recipe:o)

These are awesome scones! Just the right texture for a scone, NOT a muffin-scone, or whatever one calls a scone that tastes like a muffin. And you do NOT need a food processor to make them! I have made them now a dozen different ways, all good. I do substitute Greek yogurt for the sour cream and Splenda for the sugar. Fantastic!

I loved these. I used them for a party and had a few left over and the next day they were as good as the first day. I liked the crunch, sweetness and saltiness.

One of the best scone recipes I've used.  I had to sub buttermilk for the sour cream, and I just cut in cold butter rather than grating frozen.  Still turned out great.

Have never made scones before and not much of a baker, so take that for what is worth, but I thought the scones from this recipe were great. I followed others suggestions to put the egg in the measuring cup and then add liquids but it still needed at least 1/2 cup more flour (I wasn't measuring at that point) as it was too moist to kneed. I used 1/4 heavy whipping cream and 3/4 almond milk. I also added some dried orange rinds that I had grinded previously into a powder for some orange flavor. I also had to cook an additional 7 minutes to get them "golden brown" but ovens vary.  I will definitely make them again.

The recipe was easy and it turned out great!  Just like you get at coffee shops.  I omitted the dried fruit because I don't like the texture, used pecan pieces instead.

Better than expensive coffee store scones!  This timeI used Greek Honey Yogurt instead of sour cream, pomegranate Craisins and orange zest.  Light and flaky.... Husband loved them.

I'm not what you would call the greatest cook, but I was surprised by how easy this recipe was to make. They turned out perfect and delicious and my whole family loved them! Instead of raisins or cranberries, I added fresh blueberries and it turned out great. Am making them again this weekend and probably will a lot in the future.

Just finished making these scones and they turned out great! I would recommend not using frozen butter but just very cold butter. I did these in a food processor and my food processor couldn't handle the frozen butter but my blender could. 
I added cranberries, raisins, white chocolate chips and orange zest! 
Mine took about 19 minutes in the oven to cook - a little longer than the recipe stated. 
The mixture at first is quite sticky but if you use plenty of flour on the counter/surface and your hands then they turn out great. 
They were much easier to make than I expected! I will definitely be making more of these with more flavor combinations!

Love this recipe! Have tried several variations and just cannot go wrong with ths simple recipe. We substitute the sour cream with Plain Greek Yogurt, so adds more protein to our morning. When you family asks for these every week you know they are good. They do turn out moist unlike other scone recipes. 
Trade: Greek Yogurt vs. Sour Cream
       More Baking Soda vs. Baking Powder (more cookie like)
       Essential Oil vs. squeezed juice
       Dried orange vs. fresh (I soak the dried orange in the egg and yogurt mixture to re-hydrate)

These are excellent! I've tried several different (highly rated) scone recipes with not so great results. These scones taste very much like the real thing. I didn't grate the butter, but cut it in with a pastry cutter. Also the dough was a bit dry (probably due to my lazy flour measuring), and I used a tiny bit of buttermilk to get it to come together. Dried currants, while sometimes hard to find in the south, are much better and authentic than raisins. 

Add some Irish butter and homemade preserved and you've got a yummy breakfast or tea time treat!

This is by far the best scone recipe I have found.  I made the orange cranberry variation.  We didn't have any sour cream on hand so I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead and they came out great!

Great recipe and a big hit at home and work.I substituted whole wheat flour and yogurt (in place of sour cream) as that is what I had on hand. I used orange infused cranberries and sliced almonds for a change. Sprinkled white sugar out of oven rather than icing.

Delicious! Have searched for a scone recipe for a long time and this one was right after the first try.  I used fresh blueberries and the effect is as good as with dried fruit.  These scones are part of our weekend morning coffee ritual (and weekday if there are any left )!

My mom fought with scones for months. Hers would come out more like a pancake. I found this recipe and have made them 1/2 dozen times already. I love the almond/cherry version! The processor is the way to go. I spend more time cleaning up than the actual process itself! I love quick & easy & good when they are all rolled together!!!

I have a Salad Shooter and I used the grater attachment to shred up the butter.  After that crumbling the butter into the recipe was a breeze.  Also I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins since my kids won't eat them.  They were delicious.

This was fabulous.  I made this in my kitchenaid, once using softened butter to see if I could eliminate the grating and I still had fabulous results!  Mixed dry ingredients in the bowl, added the softened butter and on low until crumbly, then added the fruit, then wet ingredients.  This was delicious with dried cranberries and some orange zest and a squirt of the juice.  A nice crumbly scones texture, but not overly dry.  I am making them again next weekend for guests!

Excellent! Followed the directions (including grating the butter).  I sifted dry ingredients before adding butter.  I also added frozen blueberries and walnuts.  SUPER EASY and DELICIOUS recipe, thank you! Grating the butter was not difficult, took maybe 5-7 min.  It was worth it in my opinion. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

Wow, my first attempt at scones and I'll be making them again soon.  My food processor is too small so I did mine the "old fashioned" way by cutting in cold butter with a pastry blender.  Worked like a charm!  Our favorite bakery sells cherry & white chocolate scones so that's what I made and I may never buy them again!

This is one of my favorite recipes on allrecipes.com.  Like other reviewers, I use a food processor.  It takes minutes to put these together.  I love making these on a cold winter morning for breakfast.

I made these using a food processor and they turned out very good, but I think I'll try mixing by hand next time to give it more "crumble". I believe the processor made the texture too fine, or else I processed it too much. Mixed in minced dried apricots and orange zest for a great flavor. No more scones at Starbucks!

Great recipe! I make scones for my hubby's birthday breakfast every year. I have yet to unpack my cookbooks and so had to find a new recipe. Was a little apprehensive as we have tried many over the years. This one is perfect and we will use it again and again. I will try some variations over the next few months......

Love this recipe, but you absolutely need a food processor! I like to substitute the raisins for dried cherries or blueberries. For cherries I add a tsp. of almond extract to the sour cream mix. For blueberries, I add 1 tsp. of vanilla. They have become a fast family favorite. Try them with your favorite jam and Devonshire cream.

After trying a different scone recipe a few years ago, and having them come out flat as a pancake, I decided to give scones another try. I followed the recipe as is and using a cheese grater on the frozen butter and it took hardly any time at all. I like using my hands when I bake. :) They actually rose nicely, and came out very tasty. My only complaint is that they burned a little on the bottom, my oven runs very hot, so for the next time, I will try cooking them at 375 instead of 400. :)

I have been making these scones for years! I don't use sour cream mostly because its not a staple in my fridge so I use plain or vanilla yogurt and they come out fantastic!! Made them all ways but espically like the cranberry/orange in which I double on the zest!I make them on average two times a month and often share them with my two friends who also make them!_Barbara

Great!  Used a mixer to mix butter and flour mixture together.  Formed scones in circles directly from mixed ball.

This recipe is fabulous. I liked it a lot, the only thing i change it was that i omitted the raisins because I don't like it, so i made simple scones. Really delicious with cream cheese, or butter, jam, etc. you must have to try (:

Delicious!! If you're like me and have had limited success with scones, try this excellent recipe. Grating the frozen butter is a stroke of genius and I'm going to try the same technique in other pastry. By the way, I didn't use a food processor and the dough came together very well.

I have been making these scones for Christmas Breakfast for three years in a row.  I am a HORRIBLE baker.  Not even I could mess these up!  This year I even acciddently mixed in the sour cream before mixing it with the egg first.  I even used baking soda that was not the freshest (translate, I found it in the back of my cupboard) and they still came out delicious!  One thing I tried this year was doubling the recipe and then cutting the dough into two portions.  I mixed in chocolate chips in one and thawed out frozen cranberries in the other.  Both were perrrrrfect!  My family were hard pressed to pick a favorite.  Thank you, Thank you Pam Anderson!

A really delicious recipe! Perfect if you like your scones to be sweet and have a cake-like texture. The outside has a perfectly delicate crunch, and the inside is moist. Being out of sour cream at the time I used peach yogourt instead. This worked quite well and resulted in a light peachy flavour. I also added a touch extra baking soda and powder (a personal preference) so they came out very light and fluffy.

I made the Lemon-Blueberry version to go with some Lemon Curd I'd made recently. So delicious, even without additional accouterments! 
To address the review by melissathebaker who found the scones too cake-like, I found that as the days passed (I was the only one eating these, so they lasted several days), they got a little more dried out, even stored in a Snapware container, and became more of the biscuit-like texture she was seeking and never got stale. 
Highly recommend! I'll be making up a dry mix pack to go with the lemon curd I canned as a gift for a friend.

The gg makes it cake-like, which was fne for us. I used my food processor up until the fuirt, doubled the sugar because my husband likes sweet, and used blackberries instead of raisins. They were still not very sweet but were very good.

Turned out perfectly and are delicious!  I didn't fancy any of the variations at the bottom of the recipe so I added 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips and diced up a pint of fresh raspberries!  I put the raspberries in the freezer for an hour before adding them to the mix.  The dough was a little sticky so I added a little more flour.  Amazing!

Amazing I love these scones!!! I used a food processor to make the dough and I let the dried fruit get shredded into the mix and it was still very good!!  I would totally recommend them 100%! I made a double batch the other day and used cranberries instead of raisins so yummy!  I also really enjoy them with fresh fruit such as strawberries.

This recipe is simply the best scone recipe out there. The scones come out slightly moist, and not dry like a certain large Seattle-based coffee shop's scones. I don't even bother with freezing and grating the butter. Just throw it in the bowl cold and work it with a pastry cutter until the mix looks sandy. My husband LOVES these, and I usually make at least one batch every weekend. They don't last through Sunday, though (because he and my 2-year-old go through them so quickly). All variations are wonderful, but my favorite so far is the cherry almond. My husband prefers chocolate chip. Even if you don't usually like scones, try this recipe. It's hard to go wrong here!

This recipe is one of the best simple scone recipes I have found! Easily allows for substitutions. I made as described (without a food processor). They turned out slightly crisp on the outside, slightly moist on the inside, just like a little sweet biscuit. Round 2, I made Pumpkin Chocolate Chips scones, substituting the sour cream with canned pumpkin, the raisins with chocolate chips, and adding 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Just wonderful!

Wow, these were great scones!  I made the cherry and almond type, these are awesome.  I did make them by hand as my food processor is a mini, and it wasn't big enough.  I did not feel that these were a lot of effort, it was quicker then making pastry...way quicker.
I'm off to make another batch!
Cheers

I made these with salted butter, cutting the salt called for in half. I didn't freeze my butter, and simply cut it in with a pastry blender. These are very good, and pretty simple to make.

I love this recipe and even tweaked it a little by adding 1/2 c. toasted sliced almonds, 1/2 cup dried cherries, and lots of orange zest!  Oh yeah, I also sub 1/2 whole wheat flour for all purpose flour.  Yummers!  Best scones EVER

I loved this recipe!  I made mine with dried blueberries.  I think I will try fresh blueberries next time for added flavor.  Also, I may not have rolled my dough thin enough because it could have used closer to 20 minutes.  However, the slightly underdone dough worked out nicely for reheating in the oven the next day.

Claire made these for Tea Club with the orange/cranberry variation.  She actually used a honey tangerine and did add a bit of the juice (about 1t)These were delish.  Nice and moist.  She divided the dough in half and then patted out circles and cut into 8 so recipe made 16 smaller scones.  Sprinkled with turbinado sugar prior to sectioning (Sugar in the Raw). Did not need to significantly increase cooking time. Thanks!

So easy!  I made the lemon-blueberry variation noted at the bottom. I added more lemon zest and more blueberries.  I will most definitely be pulling this one out for when guests come over or when we visit friends.  My sister thought they were professionally made (pat on the back).  Anyone can make this recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

It was very good. Use a food processor! I did not freeze my butter, but I did cut it up in small squares and then stick it in freezer for 15 min. It turned wonderful! Great scones!

Don't let the wildly sticky batter scare you! This is a fantastic recipe and the tast is wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I am still trying to decide on the amount of salt needed but other than that- these are easy and always seem to impress my guests!

this was my first attempt at scones and i'll definitely do it again!  relatively easy prep and moist...which is not always the case with scones.  i added 1/2 cup of dried berry blend ( grapes, currants, cherries and cranberries).  very yummy.

Perfect basic scone recipe!  Like so many other reviewers, I put the dry ingredients and butter in the food processor - a few pulses and the frozen butter is perfectly incorporated into the flour.  I omit the raisins (my husband doesn't like them) - but I've done sweet scones by adding chocolate chips or cinnamon, and savory scones with rosemary, cheddar and chives, or whatever else I have in my cabinet.  Very versatile!

So fantastic.  I used my stand up mixer to incorporate the butter and it worked beautifully.  Instead of raisins, I used fresh organic raspberries.  I worked them in trying my best not to break them.  When they came out of the oven, my husband who is a health nut, gobbled one right down.  We both agreed they were fabulous.  This will be my go-to scone recipe for sure.  You have to try it!

This was the first time I have ever made scones. I am so impressed. They taste absolutely perfect. Not too sweet, not too dry. I do wish i had a food processor, grating the butter was a bit of a pain. I substituted 1/4 cup of flour with a 1/4 cup ground flax seed to add some fiber. I made half the dough chocolate chip-almond (extract) and the other half walnut-date.

Have made no less than a dozen times and they turn out perfect each time! I leave out the raisins and sub in whatever I want. Combos I love are dried cherries/choc. and orange zest/cranberries. Have also  used fresh fruit with great success.

These are outstanding scones. I had been in the habit of buying scones from a nearby bakery when I came across this recipe. These are way better than the bakery scones. I did everything as stated in the recipe and they turned out perfect.

As is, these are good, but my old recipe is better, but both are still not the moist, soft scones that you can find at The Bread Poet's; there for only 3 stars.  So after some tweaking to my old recipe and this one, I came up with a versions that when cooled should be just like what I'm looking for.  (My 4 kids won't let them sit long enough too let them cool, little stinkers).  Also I just made simple orange scones to all the version and to this recipe.  I added no raisins but zested 1 large navel orange, then 1 tsp of orange extract and some vanilla as I thought it had it (oops, all the other version I have made in yrs. past had vanilla :$ ) Oh and I used reg size silicone muffin pan filled 2/3's full and made 10 scones each time. Baked 400*F for 14 mins and brushed tops with buttermilk, butter, or a buttermilk-egg wash all before baking. Thanks so much for sharing. :)  GREAT STARTER RECIPE!!!! :)

This was a great scone recipe, I had to change it slightly because I didn't have sour cream, I used 1/4 cup greek yogurt and 1/4 cup half and half it worked great! Even my British Boss loved them. Thank You!

Perfect scones! Just the right texture!  I put a total of 1/2 cup of sugar (1/3 white, the rest brown), 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and then used 1/2 cup cinnamon baking chips instead of raisins.... SO delicious!!  I can't wait to make these again!

This is the scone recipe I've been searching for!  Perfect texture.  I made it without the raisins/currants, but it would surely be tasty.

The grated butter is such a great way to cut butter into flour without overworking it, especially in warm climates.  I might pull out the food processor next time, because grating a slick stick of butter by hand seemed really dangerous.

This is the best scone recipe I've tried so far. I chop the butter into the dry mix in a food processor and then add the sour cream/egg mixture and pulse a little more and it makes the lightest scone dough you've ever seen. The food processor makes the whole thing a snap to put together. You can add anything to this recipe but my favorite is a Tbsp of orange rind and a Tbsp of orange extract then glazed with confectioners sugar mixed with orange juice and marmalade - yum! Also, make 2 discs cut into 8 for 16 bite sized scones and bake for 10mins.

This is so easy to make my family loves them. I made them by the recipe and with blueberry and lemon zest as a reviewer suggested. They are fresh and light, my favorite for when visitors come to town.

Made the cranberry orange scones. Lightened it up a touch with light sour cream.  Added a few more cranberries. Delicious! Will certainly make again.

I made the lemon blueberry version this am and it was the first time I used this recipe. It was fantastic! I used my food processer as many others suggested. The only change I made was that I swapped the sour cream to a 1/2 c of heavy whipping cream b/c I didn't have sour cream on hand. Everyone loved these scones. Quick prep and bake time with awesome results. Happy baking all .

Wow! This recipe is wonderful. I always make the lemon-blueberry scones. I was eating them at a restaurant and decided to make them myself to cut down on spending. They were 10 times better than the ones at the restaurant!!! I found that trying to grate the butter was too time-consuming, so I grated it refrigerated instead. They tasted just the same. I decided to try grating some additional lemon rind on the top of that scone, and that made it taste even better! I usually ice mine. I just use milk and powdered sugar. I highly recommend this recipe. This is the only scone recipe you need.

I just finished my very first batch of scones and I loves them, the recepie is easy and it takes very little prep time. I didnt have a food procesor so I used a fork and for the butter I just put it in the freezer for an hour and used the fork to cut pieces and then used it to mix it with the dry ingredientes. The dough did come out sticky and it was hard to cut so I put it in freezer for 10-15 min and then used a floured knife to cut it and it was much easier. I did low the temp of the over to 350 and baked them for 18-20 min since at 400 my oven was browning them too fast. Over all after a bit of trail and error they came out great!!

I would rate this 10 stars!  This is a fabulous scone recipe.  Loved the suggestion of using the food processor for the butter.  I substitute chocolate chunks for the raisins and these go fast, so I have to always make two batches!

These are very good. I followed the recipe exactly except for the raisins.  We don't care for them, so I used dried cranberries instead.  I'll be making these again. Thanks!

This is definitely a five star recipe.  I made it in the food processor like other reviewers had suggested which made it super fast and easy.  None of the ingredients needed adjustment and there are endless choices to customize.  I split the batch in half and made chocolate chip and cherry almond.  Both were FABULOUS!  Thanks for posting the recipe!

I have made these numerous times and love them.  I have used cold butter - cut into sections over the dry ingredients, and using a Pampered Chef pastry blender (sharp edges) have been able to get the mixture to a crumbled blend appropriate to add the sour cream and egg.  I add a bit more sugar.  I finish the mixture by hand to get the dry and wet blended well.  
I bake them on a baking stone - and cut them into slices that end up yielding 16 (smaller portion = less calories :-)  
Just finished a chocolate chip version.  Delicious.

These scones were better than some of the other ones I've tried on this site and also better than Paula Dean's recipe I once tried.  I made the recipe as ie, but substituted blueberries picked fresh from the bush instead of raisins.  Yum, everyone ate them up at my brunch, none left over.  I'll be making these again and again!

I have made these quite a few times, each time they yield delicious results!  I'm not sure why other reviewers make it seem like these require a lot of effort to make if you don't have a food processor...I have never used one and it takes me from getting all my ingredients together to putting them in the oven 10mins max.  Very simple and easy recipe! So don't feel like you can't make these by hand, you can! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe! Now off I go to enjoy one with a cup of hot tea =)

These were great! Don't have a food processor - did it by hand as per the instructions and it wasn't too much work at all. Used yogurt instead of sour cream and added chopped dried cherries and chopped almonds and a touch of vanilla! Just great!

So delicious! I also used a food processor and it could not have been quicker or easier. For my additions, I used the zest of 1 orange and 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips. This is a keeper.

I used chocolate chips and followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was delicious! My first attempt at scones and my toddler loves 'em. Next time, I will sprinkle sugar on top before baking because I like stuff with crispy sugar on top.

This is a great basic scone recipe. I use plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and mix everything in the food processor. I've had success adding dried cranberries and orange zest, dried mixed fruit and almond extract, and chocolate chips. My family loves these, even my picky 8-year-old.

Love these! I've tried them with chocolate and caramel chips, as well as cheese and, of course a whole bunch of dried fruits. It's simple and always comes out great.
Oh, and once I tried replacing the sour cream with yogurt. It worked! It still tasted really good, and the texture didn't change much.

A food processor? Please ladies your grandmothers would be ashamed. Roll your sleeves up and shed your rings! Easy recipe! I used buttermilk instead of sour cream and omitted the egg. Also I shaped them like biscuits, indented the tops and put in some homemade apple butter (an idea I got from thejoyofbaking.com). Very delicious!

These were good...however, I'm looking for a scone similar to a local coffee shop. They are sweeter and dryer. These are "bread-like" inside. They are by no means not good...they're delicious. Just not my final choice.

I made this just as the directions said, and turned out perfectly. I made mini scones and added frozen blueberries. They were delicious. My friends seemed to like them, too.

Grating the frozen butter makes these really flaky.  Everyone loved them. I did the cranberry-orange for a more festive scone. Yummy!  Will make them again.

This is the best and easiest scone recipe ever.I used the food processor, didn’t freeze the butter, and only had a quarter cup of sour cream so I added low fat milk to make a half cup and still they came out great.They were flaky and not at all dry. I did top them with cinnamon sugar instead of plain sugar.I will try them again with different add ins. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Never really liked scones. I thought they were dry and tastless.But after reading some reviewsI thought I would try them. Made some with craisens and again with mini chocolate chips and both were wonderful. Going to make some right now!

These were really good. I do not have a stand-up mixer or food processor, so I did it all by hand. I did use about 3/4 cup sour cream, and I am so glad I did, because even that was really dry and hard to work with. But, the result was a VERY moist, crowd-pleasing scone. I am excited to experement with some of the variations folks have suggested. Cranberry almond will probably be first!

This was excellent. I followed all the instructions but added fresh blueberries at the very end (instead of raisins) and it worked great!!! (2 thumbs up). I suggest you add the fresh fruit at the very end (before cutting the pieces) so the fruits are not ruined.  It was easy even by hand.

The perfect scone recipe. There is no need for any other. Freezing and grating the butter is easy if you are making a small batch. Otherwise, a food processor works great too.

Very simple and amazingly good.  I added 1/2 cup toasted almond slivers as well as the raisins and it made a nice contrast in texture and flavour.

I'm giving it 5 stars because I wouldn't change a thing. SO easy to make. Grating the butter from frozen is a snap. I've made these a few times and each time I add a version. I've made the lemon/blueberry, but also made a chocolate chip/toffee bit version and a pumpkin version (with two glazes ala Starbucks ;) I've got requests to make them for work. That's for sharing this recipe!!

Wonderful! Everyone else already said it all. I would like to add that this is a very forgiving recipe as I had to substitute for what I had on hand. I strained some home cultured Kefir and substituted for Sour Cream. This meant adding a little extra flour and increasing the baking time by almost double for a double batch being baked at the same time. Success!

SO good!!  I love to bake and cook, but this was my first time making scones.  I've always thought of them as so dry and boring until a friend of mine made them a while back and they were so delicious, so I thought I'd give them a shot and I'm so glad I did and found such an excellent recipe.  I was low on ingredients so I had to use half sour cream and half yogurt (not sure I would have been able to tell the difference had I used all sour cream) and I decided to just make plain almond ones with 1/2t. almond extract.  I could eat the entire batch.  Next time I'll add a tad more extract for a smidge more flavor, but they were otherwise perfect.  There are many other variations I want to try, both sweet and savory!!

Excellent basic recipe.  The scones were crumbly, moist and delicious. I made the scones exactly as written with the exception of not freezing the butter and using a food processor.  Thank you for sharing.

Very good and very easy to make. I made the cranberry orange version using my food processor. I cut up the frozen butter into chunks and pulsed it with the dry ingredients then added in the wet and pulsed some more till it just comes together. Dumped it on a floured cutting board, formed it into the circle and cut it into 8 pieces. I skipped the sugar on top. After these cooled I drizzled on an icing that I had made with (not exact measurements) 1/3 cup confectioners sugar, 1 tsp milk, about half a tablespoon of room temp butter and a little bit of vanilla extract. Mixed it up all up and placed it in a ziplock bag, cut a corner off and drizzled away.

Just made these and they came out delicious.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  I just ate one with lemon curd from Trader Joe's and whipped cream.  yummmy. Next time will make some with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract or orange extract, or maybe with lemon extract. Endless possibilities.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I used my Kitcheaid stand mixer.

There's no need to skip this if you don't  have a food processor.  This is super quick and easy to make with a bowl, fork and your bare hands!  I followed the recipe exactly (my butter was only in the freezer for about 5/10 min and it still worked great) with the exception of the raisins.  I added fresh rasperry jam and a smidge of butter to the finished product and the turned out fabulous!

These are awesome!  My husband and parents love the almond/cherry version!  I've tried many versions, but these are the best so far!  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! I did cranberry-orange and substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and they were fabulous.

I hate to be one of those people, but I didn't have sour cream on hand. I used natural yogurt and half cream I had left over in the fridge (and needed to do something with the natural yogurt). But none the less, these are amazing. I cut mine into wedges and rubbed a mix of milk with the remnants of cream and yogurt left in my measuring cup to top them and they are golden brown and delicious. Crisp on the outside and soft and sweet inside. Next time, I'll reduce the sugar and add cheese because I like savoury over fruit but I will make these again, and try it with the zest and the fruit. And I used my food processor for the whole thing so thanks to those who posted that tip.

These make the house smell great as they are baking and they are just as good to eat too!  I would top them with the larger sugar crystals instead of regular sugar.

Yummy and tender. I subbed vanilla yogurt for sour cream, since that is what I had. Also, used frozen blueberries and 1/3 c. cinnamon chips for my add-ins. I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon with the dry ingredients. I used a large cookie/muffin scoop as my batter was messy and baked on silpat liner. Probably should have measured the yogurt more carefully. The scones ran into each other, but easily separated as they cooled. Made 12.

I made these for a tea party and they were a hit!  I've made them with both raisins and craisins, both were very good.  I cut each circle into 16 triangles rather than 8 as I thought the scones were too big before.  Enjoy!

This recipe is awesome! You could use just about anything you want to make these - sweet or salty/rich. I used pecans and made homemade caramel sauce for drizzle on the top. I plan to make a cheesey garlic version as well. I highly recommend these scones!

Also very good, I use this recipe's add-ins to Grandma Johnson's Scones recipe and it is a big hit!  I also used the hint to freeze the butter and its much easier this way!

These simple scones are simply amazing! I've made them multiple times before.  Try substituting the currents for chocolate chips, or fresh sliced strawberries (although the strawberries can be harder to mix into the batter you can make it happen with some delicate folding). Tasty and versatile!

The best scones, my kids and friends just love them.  I added chocolate chips besides currents or dates. And I roll them thinner and use cookie cutter to make fun shapes. :-) Thanks.

These were wonderful! I followed the recipe except I used salted butter and did not grate it - simply cut it into small pieces (by the way, 8 tablespoons is 1/2 cup of butter). I did not use a food processor and it was no problem.  I added fresh cranberries and white chocolate chunks and then drizzled melted white chocolate on the scones when cooled. Delicious!

I LOVE making these scones!  They are so light and just a hint of sweetness!  Cutting in the butter is a pain, I grant you, but worth it.  I sprinkle with cinnamon sugar most of the time before baking.  Sometimes I'll stir in chocolate chips or butterscotch chips for a sweet dessert treat.  Always a winner and they looks so pretty!

This recipe was great! I used choc chips instead of rasins and I didn't change a thing else.  The scones came out moist and flavorful.  My husband enjoyed them so much!  Grating the frozen butter and mixing it by hand was a pain, but I survived.  Next time I will use the processor like others did.

Thank you! I got so many compliments! What I liked most was that you were clear about the dough being sticky etc. The only thing I will do differently is in terms of time management. I will turn the oven on to preheat after step 3, before sticking my hands into the flour. Then again, ovens are different. So work with your oven. Thank you!

This was an excellent, fools-proof recipe!  My 12 year old daughter made them for her tea party and they looked so professional...great look and flavor.  She used dried orange-cranberries and it was a perfect balance of flavors with tea.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just love this recipe.  I've made it 20 or 30 times, it's so easy.  As a matter of habit, I put extra butter in the freezer.  I let the butter sit out for about 15 minutes before I start grating it to make the grating go easier and quicker.  Blueberry is our family favorite.  Also, sometimes I substitute cream fraiche or greek yougurt for sour cream, which seems to work perfectly well.

Very tender and moist. I just used cold butter and cut in with a pastry blender thing. Also, I left out the dried fruit and put orange zest in and brushed the tops with leftover cream before sprinkling with sugar. I will be using this as the base for all my scones from now on!

This recipe is not only great, it is very versatile. I made different versions/flavors. I made one with chocolate chips, blueberries with lemon zest. My son's liked my creation of cinnamon, sugar and raisins. I think it helped that I drizzled it with a little powdered sugar, vanilla, mixed with cream to make a drizzle sauce. (Royal iceing). Reminds me of a cinnamon roll. I think you can actually roll it out in a rectangle, spread with butter, sprinkle with a cinnamon & sugar mix, then roll up like a log, then cut like a cinnamon roll. Next time I make these. I might save a portion and try this idea. I doubled the recipe, because I made these before and they went so fast. I not only cut mine from that pizza shape, I then cut that into a triagle so I even have more and it's less calories. They made a special treat, and they are so easy to make. Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe!  As other reviewers suggested, I used a food processor for the dry ingredients and butter then transfered to a mixer with a dough hook for combine all ingredients.  I omitted the raisins and used regular crasins and grated orange peel.  Brought then to a bake sale - HUGE HIT!

There's a restaurant in Charlotte, NC called Pewter Rose that uses butterscotch scones to draw people to their weekend brunch. They even sell their own mix there. I made these scones when we were snowed in, using 1/3 cup raisins and 1/3 cup butterscotch chips and they were incredible. Bye-bye, Pewter Rose, I can do it myself.  It was so easy to grate the frozen butter in Cuisinart, then add dry ingredients, mix and add wet.   Thanks very much for the recipe.

I love this recipe. I've made cranberry orange, which were excellent, from the suggestion. I've also made chocolate chips scones by adding vanilla extract and somewhere between one and two cups of chocolate chips. Strawberry is good too. I used fresh chopped strawberries I had on hand, but was sure to drain them and decrease the liquid in the recipe.

These must be fantastic with salty ingredients to replace the raisins (like parmesan or cheddar with oregano and basil). They were great as written and the dough itself is so fragrant with butter when you work it with your hands, almost any ingredient you would want to add could work. Worth working with your hands just to get that great aroma waft out of the dough.

This recipe was fairly simple.  I had to use some substitutes for the cran/orange recipe. They were as follows:  I didn't have enough craisins so I used half craisins, half golden raisins, I was out of sour cream instead I used vanilla yogurt.  I threw the butter in the freezer for just about a half hour and it worked out just fine.  Serve with a hot beverage and you will have happy eaters!!

These were very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and was so happy with the results.  They're best warm out of the oven, but they do freeze well and taste great defrosted and warmed up in a toaster oven.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Absolutely amazing!  I tried several top rated recipes from this site before deciding on which ones to make for my baby shower party.  This one won hands down..I was hesitant to try it because it was 'simple' and how can simple equal exquisite?  Well...this one is great...easy AND exquisite!

Fantastic. I added in craisins and candied orange peel. Was a perfect snack to bring to class. I didn't bother sprinkling suger on the top, they were sweet enough. Nice and crumbly.

I've seriously made this recipe like 20 times and I love them every time. I tried a bunch of different combinations, but I have two favorites that seem to be a hit with everyone.  1. Cinnamon. I really don't measure much with spices so forgive my estimates, but I use about 1/2 cup of cinnamon chips and add a 1/4tsp of nutmeg. I've also put a pinch of allspice in. That was pretty nice. I'm thinking of trying a pumpkin scone, adding a bit of canned pumpkin with all of the same spices (probably not the chips though).  2. Orange and cranberry. I changed the footnote recipe a bit to bring out more flavor. I add 1/2 cup dried cranberries (craisins) and 2 tbsp. of orange marmalade to the sour cream and egg mixture. Because the marmalade will make it sticky, I just keep extra flour out to get back to the right constistency. This is my personal favorite! The orange zest just didn't cut it for me. I'm not very good at "zesting," and when I did you could barely tell the scones had orange flavor. I'd say like 2 tbsp. of orange juice (and a bit more flour) should do the trick too.

Delicious. I've made several batches: cranberry/orange, lemmon/poppyseed, date/nut. I use my kitchenaid, slice cold butter into the dry ingredients and let the mixer do all the work. Awesome scones!

This is an excellent scone recipe! I used 3/4 c. dried blueberries and added about 1/2 c. white chocolate chips. They were delicious and the kids loved them too! I split the dough in half and made two smaller mounds so that the recipe would yield 16 smaller scones. They turned out to be the perfect size!

easy recipe with lots of room for variation. I subbed heavy cream for the sour cream. I used dried dried cherries and chocolate chips but look forward to other variations. This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe produced light scones with just the right amount of sweetness. I added about a tsp. of vanilla to the sour cream and egg mixture. I also added a 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries to the flour mixture. To give it that bakery look I sprinkled some coarse sugar on top. The sour cream flavor goes very well with the vanilla and blueberries.  Good stuff!

These were delicious!  I used the recipe (minus the sugar) as a base and added grated sharp cheddar cheese and 4 pieces of cooked, chopped bacon.  I didn't have any sour cream, so I substituted 1/4 c. heavy cream.  Dough came together beautifully and scones are perfect!  So crispy on the outside and tender and flaky on the inside.  I can't wait to make my next batch!

The flavor of these scones was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly. My only complaint is that I have followed easier recipes for scones, and as I made these I swore up and down that I would never do this again. However, when I tasted them? The texture and the flavor were superior to any bakery scone.

This is a good basic recipe for scones. I added 1/2 cup white chocolate chips that I melted with a bit of milk to the dough. Did not add raisin but substituted 3/4 cup cinnamon chips.   After cutting and placing on baking tray I brushed the tops with alittle healvy cream sweetened with a little white sugar. After baking I glazed with about 2Tbsp powdered sugar mixed with 1 Tbsp Milk.

Wow! we made these on the first snow day here in Beijing.  They were awesome.  I threw in some cinnamon and nutmeg, and subbed cranberries for currents.  OH.  and i used plain yogurt instead of the sour cream.  So easy and so good.

Great scones recipe! My recipe calls for cream or half and half but I didn't have any on hand and didn't want to go to the store, these were just as good and was able to use what I already had.

My food processor isn't big enough to fit everything into, so I wound up having to do this by hand.  Even still, it turned out great!  I don't mind playing with my food - it's fun to get hands deep every once in a while, so this one was fun to make and tastes better than the scones I usually pick up at the coffee shop.  Great recipe!

Awesome scones.  People think I am crazy when I tell them I put sour cream into it.  My wife and daughter are constantly asking for them!

They were a little more moist than i thought traditional scones should be.  One suggestion is if you don't use a food processor make sure you freeze your butter or it'll get too soft in the process. I also doubled the recipe and found out that you need to put your dough in the fridge inbetween baking.

These were suprisingly delicious.  I was surprised because the dough was so sticky, I didn't think they would turn out at all.  I would definitely add more flour on the board when I press them into the circle.  I omitted the raisins and added frozen raspberries and white chocolate chips.  That was a delicious combination.  I baked them a few extra minutes.  They turned out great and had a great flavor.  I will be making these again.

4 stars because I had to make a few changes to get these right.  I tried 3 times before getting the perfect scones.   The first try, the scones turned out very dry and didn't rise much while baking.    The second time I used about 1 tbsp extra sour cream, and put about 1/8 cup less flour into the mixture, since flour was getting added while I handled the dough anyway.  These turned out great, but were still not quite dense enough to be perfect.  The third batch was perfect because I used half whole wheat flour, half all-purpose flour.  I added lemon zest and cranberries for the flavors.  This final batch was 5 stars.  I made the scones as described, without a food processor, and they turned out just fine.

I decided to make this after my husband went to a meeting that served cran/orange scones. He said that he liked this even better! It was easy to make, and these disappeared within a few hours. To add a little something extra, I rolled the scones (fresh out of the oven) in sugar crystals to coat the top or drizzled lines of frosting on top. Wonderful!

Very tasty. Quick and easy to make, I used my food processor. I did not add any fruit in mine, but had them plain. These are more like a cookie like biscuit than scone to me, but still delish. They are very moist, fluffy and sweet. I think of a scone as being more of a bland biscuit. But I will still make these again. I might try omitting the sugar and making a savory one with cheeses, yum.

Perfect every time. I never change the recipe at all. I use my food processor and add dried cranberries and orange peel. I always make the orange butter to go along with the scones. I don't usually care for scones at the coffee shops, they always seem to be somewhat dry. These are perfect every time! A keeper!

So easy and so delicious! The name suits this recipe well! I switched some ingredients to make this a bit more healthy. I used a food processor to mix the dry ingredients (but used less than 1/8tsp salt because there is salt in the spread I used), and then added Smart Balance Spread from the tub (8Tbl), and processed. Then I added yogurt/egg mixture, and processed. Then folded in the dried fruits. Baked at 400 for 15 min as the recipe stated, and the results were phenomenal! Simple and delicious! Definitely a keeper!

AWESOME! I followed the recipe nearly exactly(even freezing the butter for 1hour and grating in a cheese grater) because I had never made scones before. The only difference was I added some vanilla extract, almond extract, and dried blueberries.  I used Turbinado sugar because I had it on hand. These scones tasted better than some I have had at coffee shops! I have frozen most of them because the batch is so big. They taste just as good after they thaw. WOW

This is a very good recipe for scones. I used the cranberry alternation and just squeezed some orange juice into the sourcream and egg and they came out delicious.

Last weekend at our church we had an engagment party for an English Lady. And since I am the "baker" of the group I was elected to make the scones...oh no. The ones I made before were dry, tasteless and a waste of my time and money to make. So needless to say I was a bit worried to be making them for someone who eats authenic ones everyday.  These turned out GREAT! using my food processor made everything so easy. prep times was under five mins ( I had over 50 to make) I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the egg and sourcream on the "plain" ones. I keep my extra flour in the freezer and used that along with the frozen butter and they came out so good! Thank you for this recipe!

These are the best! I substitute plain nonfat yogurt for the sour cream and they turn out wonderful. Everyone who tastes them, loves them.

I have made these scones now for what seems like forever!  My kids love them, their friends love them, I love them... I never add anything to them, and the only changes we've made is to add 1 or 2 tsp of vanilla and changing up the amount of sugar depending on what I'm using them for.  Great recipe!!!!

I made this recipe with the raisins. These were okay. I guess what I mean is, they're just too simple tasting. The sour cream does help with the taste, but overall, its not something WOW-ing.

I absolutely loved these scones!  I made the almond and cherry but substituted buttermilk for sour cream and mixed them till they were just mixed (I find over mixing baked good make them tough).  My friends and family were doing the happy dance when I served them with clotted cream, cherry jam and butter...with a pot of hot coffee...it was heaven!

Yummy!  Great base recipe that can be adapted many different ways.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, and added orange zest.  Delicious.  Can't wait to try lemon blueberry and lemon poppyseed versions.  Dough came together exactly as the recipe described.  Grating the frozen butter worked perfectly for those of us who don't have a food processor.  Seemed quicker and easier than cutting it in with a pastry blender.  This receipe is definitely a keeper.

My first attempt at scones and they were so good I delivered a batch to my foodie friends, who are very picky. Next time I may try a food processor, as others have suggested. I made mine with frozen blueberries and they were great!

I used cranberries and lemon zest, and the scones were delicious.  The ladies I served them to at my book club really loved them.  They're even better warm!  I followed the directions verbatim, and it wasn't too much work, but I can see how it would have been faster if I had used a food processor as some other people suggest.

WOW. These were outstanding! I made two batches on mother's day for my mother and mother in law. I used salted butter that wasn't frozen and just cut it in and that turned out to work extremely well (I currently don't have a food processor.) The first batch I made with Craisins, semi-sweet chips and white chips - my mom RAVED about these! The second batch I made with fresh blueberries and they were a little lacking in sweetness in my opinion, but my mother in law loved them. I'll try adding a little more sugar next time if using blueberries, but other than that, no variations are needed at all!I will definitely make these again!

My son had a class assignment to make a  food for one of his classes that represented a country that his family originated from.  So, we could choose from Scotland, Wales and Germany.  Scones are found in both Wales & Scotland so scones it was.  I didn't find it difficult at all to hand pinch the butter into the flour mixture--acutally, mixing it was very easy.  The only problem I had was that the scones tasted salty and the sweetness was overpowered by this salty taste.  I added a teaspoon of salt as was directed in the doubled recipe (16 scones), but if I make these again I would reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. at most.

These scones were absolutely delicious! I made mine plain, and they were to die for! I followed a previous commenter's advice and made them in my food processor. So easy! I served them with Easy Devonshire Cream (also found on allrecipes) and strawberry preserves. Yum! I can't wait to make them again!

By far, the easiest, simplest recipe for perfect scones. Grating the butter, however, is tough by hand, but worth it. I'm wondering if anyone has tried to make a lemon poppyseed version?

I followed the instruction exactly.  The result was wonderful, light and tender scones that are flavorful.  P.S use butter, it makes a great difference.

This was a good moist scone recipe.  I always add white chocolate chips to my scones though, just to sweeten them a bit.  I also did not have quite enough sour cream so I substituted strawberry flavored cream cheese.  This was a very subtle flavor, but surprisingly good!

I didn't have any raisins at the time, so after I put the triangle slices on the cookie sheet, I slit the top and stuffed strawberry jam in it. When the scones were done, I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top and served.. YUMMY!

These are delicious! Perfectly lightly sweetened. I only made slight changes: I had to add about 2 extra tablespoons of sour cream, I used brown sugar intead of white sugar, and I added 1 tablespoon of fresh grated orange zest. Mmmm! I will make these many times again.

Super easy and great tasting. the second time I made them I used 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of all white flour, added 1 tablespoon of milk to the dough for moisture and used 1/4 cup dried blueberries and 1/4 cup dried cherries... they came out PERFECT!!!

Best scone recipe I have. Sometimes I make it without the rasins and sometimes I add nuts, cranberries and orange rind. I think the method of grating the frozen butter is the secret. My daughter thinks it is the sour cream.

This recipe is fantastic. Made it for some visiting friends and they absolutely loved it. I did not need top make any changes.  Next time though I will use a healthier alternative to butter. Loved it. Love it!

These came out PERFECT! I had to use Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream but they were not missing a thing. I also added the zest of one lemon. Excellent!!! I have since made them with sour cream and orange zest. They always turn out perfect. Only problem is, I can't stop eating them. YUM!

This scone recipe reminds me so much of the scones my father made for my siblings and me growing up. I was initially hesitant to try this recipe, however, glad I did! These are excellent and SO easy to make...with a few modifications: I used regular butter instead of the recommended and I used my hand mixer to do the mixing and it did very well.

Followed the recipe to the T. Piece of cake to grate the frozen butter. The dough came together perfectly. I made the cranberry orange scones and they were very moist and delicious.  Husband said they were very good but a little bit more sugar next time would put it over the top.

Loved this recipe!  Very easy in a food processor.  I used chocolate chips and made them a little smaller than the recipe said, cooked them about 4 minutes less.  My kids took them to their international festival where they were a big hit.  Great recipe!

These are the best scones, EVER!  Foolproof and delicious.  I can't count how many times I have made them and they always are a hit! The hardest part is grating the frozen stick of butter and how hard is that!!!!

This was my first time making scones.  This recipe was simple and turned out perfect.  I made the cranberry/orange variation and we loved it.  The portions of the scones are huge (the size of a piece of pie), so I will cut them into smaller pieces in future recipes.

I made this last weekend for company.  It was my first time making scones and I think it was the first of many more times to come.  Very delicious and deceptively easy.  Using the food processor made this recipe ridiculously easy.  Can't wait to make cranberry orange scones this weekend!!

This recipe makes perfect scones every time. I've made many variations now, although my favorite is sweet almond kernels (whole) with Trader Joe's triple berry blend.

I LOVE this recipe. It is easy and uses ingredients that I almost always have on hand. I have made these for many occasions and always get rave reviews. My husband prefers them with chocolate chips but I also like the Lemon Blueberry and Orange Cranberry versions but I double or even triple the rind. The only other adjustments I make, I sub 1 cup whole wheat flour and add 1 teaspoon vanilla.

I spend $4. a day on a Zingerman's Cherry Scone on my way to work in the morning, now I don't need to. This recipe is PERFECT.

Update: Have made these many times, and am always impressed. On Christmas morning I opened up a container of moldy sour cream, and I used a cup of greek yogurt, and about an 1/8 of a cup (I eyeballed it) of buttermilk instead. Came out perfect. Nice, light, and fluffy. Always my favorite. So good.

I omitted the raisins and added 2 tsp orange zest and @ 1/2 cup chopped almonds. Very tasty. I also used a food processor for the butter rather than grating it.

I have to add to the number of positive reviews for these scones. 

I made them as stated, except added a bit of almond extract and dried cherries that had been softened in water. Family raved and this WILL be our new favorite recipe.

I made these by hand just like the recipe said (no food processor) and it was so so easy! These are delicious! I find it hard to believe that something so simple can be so divine! I added dried cranberries, white chocolate chips and almond extract. There's a party in my tummy yummy, yummy!

I had these scones with lemon curd, which I found the recipe on this website as well. They were heavenly delicious!! Also, they're very easy to make. I didn't use a food processor because I didn't have it. But I still made the dough with an ease. Thank you so much for the fabulous recipe.

Substituted margarine and Sour Supreme to make it lactose free, perfect! Definitely go with the food processor route, too.

Every time that I make this recipe, everyone raves over them. I do add a corresponding glaze for whatever dried fruit I put in it eg. a lemon glaze over a dried blueberry scone. This is a wonderful base recipe.

I used 1/2 cup yogurt (raspberry, actually) instead of sour cream and 1/2 cup combination of pecans and toffee bits instead of raisins.  To counter the sweetness of the yogurt, I sprinkled a little salt on top along with the 1 tsp sugar.  They turned out great!  Enjoyed with tea.

Wonderful recipe, and so easy! I made one batch with poppyseeds and lemon, and another with dried cherries and dark chocolate chunks. My kids think I am the best baker ever, and I put these in a basket with some homemade biscotti and banana bread for a charity auction at my husbands work. They got rave reviews!

A winner!  I made a double batch and they disappeared the same day.  My kids loved them.  I added dried cranberries and choc. chips.  Next time I'll add orange zest.

I make these scones ALL the time, and they have gotten rave reviews every single time.  I like to mix up the goodies, sometimes using dried cherries, sometimes using cinnamon chips. This recipe is easily adapted to varied pantries, too.  It is BY FAR the most popular thing I bake.

I loved this scone. I tried blueberries with lemon zest the first time, and cherries & almonds the second, but these could be delicious plain. I like to brush mine with cream.
Thank you for a great recipe.

I used cherry craisins and 1/2 t. almond extract.  Would use more almond flavoring next time.  Mine were a little dry at 15 minutes.  Will have to keep a closer eye next time.  definitely put raw sugar on top before baking.

EXCELLENT and easy. I used Almond flavoring and white chocolate chips! I think the almond flavoring made it.  

Also tried butterscotch chips, those were good too. 

Brushed with a beaten egg to give them golden brown color. 

These were Delicious! I did not have a mixer and it was just fine with using a small hand held butter masher, and then hands.

Chose this recipe over the other popular recipe since this one seemed to have helpful, detailed instructions. VERY EASY!!!!!!! I cut in half, and and kept the egg whole so I think it made the dough too sticky. Rather deformed and struggled to get them off the counter. Made with mini chocolate chips. My brother ate pretty much ALL of them ^_^ THANK YOU!!!!!

I love these scones. I used cherry-flavored dried cranberries and almond. I melt white chocolate and then drizzle them when cool. You can also make mini scones by following the directions. Once you have 8 regular size scones cut, you can cut those into 3 triangles, making mini scones. Bake for 14-15 minutes rather than the 15-17 recommended. Great for baby showers or any crowd.

This is by far the best scone recipe I've found.  Very quick & easy and moist.  I like making them with orange-cranberries and a hint of vanilla.  I always brush egg whites and sprinkle raw sugar on top for a nice brown color and slight crunch from the sugar crystals. It ain't the same without it.  Yummm!

I made the cranberry-orange version, and I must admit to being disappointed in how little sweetness these had.  I tasted flour a little too much, as well.  I will definitely make these again, but I will double the amount of sugar.  TIP:  Cut the butter into small pieces prior to freezing--this makes it work well in the food processor.  I will definitely make these again, but I will double the amount of sugar.

These are a huge hit!  I've tried cutting up cold butter rather than grating frozen butter; both work but it's almost easier to grate the butter.  I've added 1/2c cranberries with orange zest or 1/2c blueberries with lemon zest; both work well.

Just a really good recipe. I did add 1 tsp. vanilla though. They were light and easy to mix up. My dough was a tad soft but I think that was because I did not have my butter frozen. I used my food processor to mix. Thanks!

We love this recipe.  No exotic ingredients so we usually have what we need to make them and they taste wonderful!  I tried the food processor this time and WOW! I'll never go back to hand mixing again :)

Great recipe. I used dried cranberries and used a glaze made with confectioner's sugar and orange juice.

I just made these and couldn't wait for them to get to room temperature.  I ate them warm, so I don't know if the texture hadn't "set" yet, but I'm used to my scones being a little more crumbly.  Mine turned out a LITTLE bit cakier than crumbly, but it could be the changes/mistakes I made.  First of all, I totally forgot baking powder, so I only had baking soda in the mix (still puffed up fine).  I subbed fat free greek yogurt for sour cream.  Instead of white flour, I used 2 c whole wheat flour, which made the mix drier since it absorbs more liquid, so I did have to add about a tablespoon more yogurt.  My flavor variation was that I added a 1/2 cup of chopped assorted dried berries and 1 tsp of almond extract.  The taste is really delicious; aromatic, lightly sweet, nutty from the whole wheat, airy/light, not too heavy or dense, moist... yum!  The texture is not bad, just not what I expected from a scone, but let's see what it's like when it's cooled down.

Excellent recipe.  Followed exactly and was thrilled with the ease and final product.  Also made these with craisins, and microplaned the zest of one orange into dry ingredients, absolutely delightful!

Addendum: I have now made this recipe or variations of it, no less than 30 times! It is a favorite of many co-workers.....they request them on their birthdays....for potlucks etc! My daughter's favorite version is Chocolate Chip Banana....mine is still Dark Chocolate Hazel Nut...another favorite is Pumpkin Chocolate Chip. 

Original Review 2008: I found this recipe yesterday morning and since then have made 5 batches. I have made 2 batches adding 2/3 c raisins and 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 batch adding 2/3 c white choc chips,1 batch with 2/3c white choc chips and 2/3 c dried cranberries and finally, 1 batch adding 2/3c dark choc chips and 1/2c chopped hazelnuts (my favorite!)I also used an egg wash and sprinkled the tops with washed raw sugar  before baking. Today is Easter and everyone is raving about the scones! Can't wait to take them to work tomorrow,if there are any left overs! Will make this one over and over for years to come!!

First time I've ever made scones. I read a lot of recipes before I found this one. I'll make this one again and again and again! I added 1/2 tsp almond extract and used orange flavored dried cranberries instead of raisins. Brushed the tops with egg and milk and sprinkled on some special sugar. They were fantastics.

excellent recipe.  I misread the recipe on my first try and added a whole tub of 16oz sour cream!  It was quite messy but the result was still yummy.  Texture was very soft as you can imagine and was very good.    
After that, I made more following the recipe carefully and it was wonderful. 
I cut in butter in the food processor until it resembled cornmeal.  It was much better!  I will make this again with cranberries, blueberries and dried cherries.  Thanks!

Very good! Even my Mom loves it! I added a bit less sugar, I think I'll add full amount next time. I put golden raisins instead for more sourness and mini chocolate chips. Will put more raisins next time. Otherwise, perfect scones.

These are really good! My English husband has been in a baking mood lately and baked these.  We both really liked the flavor and moistness of these scones.  They should be a touch saltier (to the sweetness it has) but was still very nice.  Next step: making them for the in-laws!

I had no sour cream but decided to make them anyway, came out very moist and crunchy on the outside! (sort of biscuity) I also snuck in a few chocolate chips.

I'm a grandma, and my Irish grandma used to make scones for me 50 years ago, but she just "threw things together," she said, no written recipe. Well, I just "threw this recipe together," like it said, and it was (Shhhhh!) better than hers! Now, that's going some. No food processor, so I smooshed the butter with a fork. Topped warm baked scones with buttercream frosting left over from a cooking spree with my daughter-in-law. I'm passing on old family recipes to her. Can't wait to share this one with her!

Good recipe.  I made mine wih blueberries and lemon zest.  They came out great.  They baked for about 17 minutes.  I will make these again.  However, I felt the dough was a little too sticky.  Also, the amount of utensils needed was daunting.

I have made this recipe a lot and love it. I have tweaked it a lot and make two variations: Cherry Almond Vanilla, and Blueberry Almond. For both I use about 1/4 cup of ground blanched, skinned almonds. I have used skinned as well, they just have noticeable dark skins throughout, but still taste great. I also use 1/2 to 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup dried plus 1/2 cup fresh blueberries or cherries, using all fresh fruit is too messy. The cherries are of course pitted and sliced in at least half. I rehydrate the dried fruit for about 10-20 min in boiling water, drain and use. I also use lite sour cream. Finally I add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract. I use a 3 T cookie scoop to size them somewhat similarly. With wet hand I roll them in a ball and flatten them. I coat with a egg wash and sprinkle with sugar in the raw or turbinado sugar. With the scoop, it makes about 12 scones.

Perfect, perfect, perfect.  Didn't change a thing.  I used the orange zest/cranberry recipe.  Easy, quick, and delicious.  Great for tea or BREAKFAST.

These are so easy to make!  I bring them to work all the time and always get asked for the recipe.  My favorite is cranberry with orange zest.

This were so easy and so good.  I made them for a brunch and they were truly the hit of the meal.  I used the suggested variation of orange rind and chopped pecans.  I can't wait to make them again!

This recipe was GREAT! I made them with some fresh rasberrys and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, will always use this as my base recipe for scones.
