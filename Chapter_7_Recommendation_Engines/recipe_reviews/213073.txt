Great and simple. A word of warning: Do NOT use a smokey BBQ sauce with lil smokeys.  Use a sweet bbq sauce.

I have been making these for years.  The only thing I do differently is mix equal parts grape jelly, BBQ sauce and ketchup.  This also works just as well with cut up beef hot dogs.  Adults and kids alike love these.  I love them especially because they're fast, easy and can be prepared in advance.

I have been making these for parties for years!  People can't seem to get enough of these.  I always use apricot jelly but I'm sure grape works just fine too.  These little things seem to be addictive no matter how you make them.

I have been making this for 15 years. My x-wife had this recipe. Funny to see it again here. Nobody believs me when I say I used grape jelly in it. I take it to pot lucks all the time and it is one of the first dishes to go. Just took it to a b day party last month and when my girlfriend saw me putting grape jelly in with the links a sause, she grosed out and said no way she would eat it, and that I ruined the links she spent all that money on. After hearing all the great revievs from party goers she decided to give it a shot. She loved it!

A household hit for any occaision! I use equal parts of grape jelly and BBQ sauce. I also make this with prepared meatballs from the grociery store. This is also good using both meatballs and lil smokies. Just make sure the sauce covers the meat. This gives a little more variety when making for a party.

This is in the crockpot as we speak. It's not a holiday without these wonderful little gems. I did saute a little onion and garlic in butter, then added the grape jelly and my own homemade barbeque sauce and peppered it up a bit before pouring over the Lil' Smokies. OMNOM.

I was very skeptical about this recipe so I tested it first.  Funny how the taste changes as it cooks.  After an hour the smoky flavor from the bbq sauce was so overwhelming I thought this was a big mistake but after 2 hours the smokiness was slight and balanced and delicious.  I couldn’t believe it.  I reheated them the next day in the microwave oven and they were still perfect.   Strange but this works !

I love these little yummy appetizers and have eaten many sauce variations, but my favorite is a combination of grape jelly, catsup, pineapple, a little sugar and......diced jalapenos!

These did NOT taste good. I used Famous Dave's Sweet N Sassy with grape jelly over miniature buffalo sausages. I wasted a bunch of sausages and had to come up with a "plan B" for my party. Will use a recipe with ingredients that aren't so bizarre. The grape jelly was just too much.

These are delicious, I make them all time.  My only note is to choose a bbq sauce that is smokey instead of sweet.  If you chose like a honey bbq sauce (we normally prefer that one) the grape jelly is too sweet.  Also, make sure to cook them at least two hours, after the first hour the taste isn't full yet.  But watch them because if they get dry and shriveled they are nooo good!

i feel bad for motherhoodgroove. someone had basically gave me this same recipe years ago and I admit I thought it sounded weird. I found this recipe on here and made it for my daughter class(picky 4th graders) I made a huge crockpot full of them and they were all gone, every single one. I even had kids asking me for the recipe so they could have their moms make it. which was pretty funny. so tonight I am making them for the class again. im sorry but you cant change ingredients or the kind of sausage you use and expect the same results

I have been using this recipe for years! People hesitate because of the grape jelly, but this is really what makes it a great recipe. I use a bottle of Heinz Chili Sauce in place of the barbecue sauce though. Love it!

Made these for the superbowl, every last one was devoured. They were delicious and so simple too! I've also used a mix of smoked sausage links and cut up beef hot dogs with equal success. Yum!

Very good! I was skeptical of the jelly, but it gave it a nice sweetness, and it was a good contrast to the BBQ sauce. As always, we used Head Country sauce, and if you're an Okie like me, that says it all. ;-)

My mother, and other Southern hostesses, have been making these at least since my childhood well over 30 years ago. They were a fixture at parties, along with cheese straws, deviled eggs, etc. Yum.

Extremely simple and foolproof. This was the only thing at my stepsister's baby shower to not have leftovers. I suspect that brown sugar would go just as well as the grape jelly (if you don't have grape jelly on hand) since it's there primarily for sweetness. People really liked this. Thanks for sharing!

Love these!  I use a can of Cranberry Sauce (jellied kind), and a bottle of Chili sauce.  Mix together and add to slow cooker w/lil smokies.  Always a favorite at get togethers.  No measuring needed.

I did mine on the stovetop, stirring frequently til the sauce thickened into a beautiful gel (which it does because of the jelly). I used Sauer's brand barbecue sauce because it's extremely sour, almost no sugar in it, a thin tomato-vinegar sauce which is popular here but maybe not so much elsewhere. These were terrific, thanks for sharing!

I have been making a recipe like this for 30+ years.  The difference is I use a bottle of yellow mustard instead of the barbeque sauce.  Delicious!

These guys are lil, but pack a big punch! My family and friends loved them. There were no leftovers! I've tried them as a guest at parties and finally decided to find the recipe to wow my own crowd. I LOVE this site, and wouldn't look anywhere else to try something new. Thanks for sharing!

Made these for pumpkin carving.  They were really good and as easy as it gets.  I did add a little more grape jelly than called for as the BBQ sauce I used had too much spice for our little guy.  We loved them.  Thanks!

These are so awesome!  My mom also makes them with apple jelly and adds just a little dash of mustard and it still turns out great.

I use some chunky pineapple and purple plum jelly along with the sauce.  Don't spill it in the floor of the car like I did one time transporting it.  What a sticky mess!  My grandson who is 30 adores these.

I love the smokies, I use 4 pkgs of Hillshire farms little smokies, 2 beef and 2 original. Drain off the juice, put them in the crockpot with small jar of grape jelly and 1 bottle of Heinz Chili Sauce. put in 2 small bags of plain meatballs (not italian). then pour 1 small bottle of Sweet baby Rays  Sweet and Spicy, and 1 small bottle of K.C. Masterpiece over the top and let er cook.  Awesome.

Made these in the slow cooker for Christmas appetizers and they were a big hit.  I made half cocktail smokies and half meatballs and they were both excellent.  I used frozen turkey meatballs and this recipe couldn't have been any easier.  I used a 14 oz package of smokies, a 24 oz package of meatballs, 6 oz of chili sauce, 18 oz of regular Bulls Eye barbeque sauce, and 16 oz of grape jelly.  Using a little more ingredients made sure the meat was covered during cooking.

This is good but I like my aunt's better. She uses Grape Jelly and yellow mustard instead of BBQ sauce. Also delicious with meatballs.

Good flavor and simple to prepare.  I mixed smoked and regular weiners as well as frozen meatballs to try the recipe.  All were great.  This recipe is a "keeper".

This was good, but I think 3 hours on high was way too much.  The smokies were sort of shriveled and dried out.  I would recommend that you cook them on low or at least reduce the cooking time to an hour or so.

I've had this exact recipe numerous times at company potlucks.  Loved it enough to make it myself.  I also love the Reviews containing variations in the recipe.  Very helpful to see how it turned out for them.  Never thought about Smoky BBQ sauce with smoky sausages being overwhelming on the smoky.  Might have to try the Cranberry sauce or the Apricot jelly.  My palate won't tolerate the Buffalo flavoring  but that's OK.  Someone else's palate will be able to enjoy it.

I had found this recipe elsewhere, but want to review this because it had the same ingredients. The only thing that was different was the other one called for 16 oz BBQ sauce. I think that was a little much so I will be using 12 oz next time. These disappeared fast between my DH and three boys ages 5,3, and 2. I used Sweet Baby Rays but ran out of the regular BBQ sauce so I used 1/2 regular, and 1/2 sweet and spicy. I will be making this again, and will be using the 12 oz instead of 16.

These were awesome. I did notice that my barbecue sauce was a little strong, so I wound up reading the reviews and finding adding Ketchup as an extra recommended ingredient, which I used to soften it, and then they were perfect.

I like to use the turkey links instead of the regular beef smokies. Nearly half the calories and they taste wonderful. If I'm taking it to a bigger party, I'll use half beef half turkey. Mmm mmm mmm!

Did not like this recipe...the sauce was a sort of a mixture of sweet and sour, which normally my family likes, but this just had a strange taste. Will not make again. :(

Have also used chili sauce in place of the barbeque sauce or a can of pineapple chunks and barbeque sauce or a can of consumme.  This is a very forgiving recipe as you can also use meatballs in place of the little smokies.

Oh. My. GOSH! So delicious. Where has this recipe been all my life? Easy to make and can't even tell it has grape jelly in it. I followed the recipe exactly using Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy sauce, Smuckers Concord Grape jelly, and Hillshore Farms all beef mini sausage links. I will most definitely be making these again for potlucks and get-togethers.

I'm thinking I should have used less liquid ingredients then called for - the sauce was a little runny. Or...MORE Smokies. Yes, that's it...!

Use equal parts  barbecue and jelly! Also you could double the amount of meat for this amount of sauce, there’s so much sauce left over that I’m running to the store for more weinies so the sauce doesn’t go to waste.

We liked this, but it was a little too sweet for my taste. I might brown the sausage next time because I prefer that texture and may cut back a little on the jelly to reduce the sweetness. Would be good with chopped onion added as well. Very easy to make, and my husband enjoyed it.

I have made little smokies with bbq sauce for years so I thought I would try then in my crock pot.  They were not as good as grilling them and adding the sauce.  It it took days to clean the slow cooker.  Never again.

Made it per the recipe and it came out great.   We added a 3rd bag of the meat and had to scale up the sauce.   Just do it - make this 3 step recipe and don't second guess or over think it.

I know the idea of grape jelly sounds crazy, but these are so very good!  And talk about easy!  I'm pretty sure the only way it could get any easier is if it said to eat them straight out of the package.  And the ingredient portions are really easy to adjust for larger or smaller portions.  I used Kraft Original barbeque sauce and Smucker's grape jam.  Perfect!

Love this recipe, it can get expense with the little smokes if you have a crowd. I now drain a can of Dole chunked pineapples and add to this recipe. It's a crowd pleaser and I never have any left over.

I followed the recipe exactly and all I can say is Meh. I made them for a BBQ and people tried one, but did not go back for seconds. It tasted like a little smokie cooked in flavored hot dog water. I stopped off at a gas station on the way home from the BBQ and threw the leftovers in the trash.

I have been making this for 40 or 50 years. It was one of the "eaties" I served at my first little gathering. 

This time around, we wanted it and didn't want to go to the grocery just for a jar of grape jelly, so I substituted apple jelly for the grape jelly.  Not quite as sweet as with grape, but still very good. We enjoyed it thoroughly.

I made this recipe one time as written and it turned out ok, however, the second time I made it we used apple jelly instead of grape and it definitely gave us the flavor we wanted. Have made several times now with the apple jelly.

So easy!!!!! Another alternate, is use cocktail sauce instead of BBQ or Ketchup. You just can’t go wrong if you mix sweet and tangy no matter what the flavor.

Made these for a birthday party.  I used little meatballs that I bought instead of the cocktail weiners.  It was so good.  Everyone loved them!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce.   One batch was made with Sweet & Spicy barbecue sauce, the other batch was made with Honey Barbecue & regular barbecue sauce.  Soooo good!

Super disappointed. The flavor was bland, the sauce was runny, and it was not sweet enough. It was really easy to make, but I wish I would have chose a different recipe.

Instead of BBQ sauce I used yellow mustard according to taste. Went over big time! Original was great. Maybe next time I'll do BOTH styles.

I used 2 packs of cocktail smokies, 1 big bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce,  and  half a jar of Welch's grape jelly. I cooked it for 2 hours on low. There were only 2 smokies left when the company pot luck was over. I call it a win!

Seems kind of plain? Not sure if there’s a certain bbq sauce and/or jelly that would make it better. Pretty good, but not sure if I would make it again this exact way. Would need to spice it up a bit.

I have a question because I’m seeing so many opposite reviews about what to use. Which version would be the least sweet? With the grape jelly and chili sauce or the grape jelly and bbq sauce. Concerning the bbq sauce though which kind Smokey or sweet? Or would cranberry jelly  be better? Out of a can like for thanksgiving? I’m not sure but I do know I don’t want sweet I want savory but still good. Without a red sauce like ragu. Thx so much for your help.

I've been making these for years with meatballs. I use hot ketchup though and grape jelly. They are always a huge hit. Today I am making them with little hotdogs not smokies just the hotdogs which I am sure it will be fabulous. Next time maybe i'll try the BBQ sauce..

I used hickory smoked bbq sauce which is where I probably went wrong. They just didn't taste as good as the ones I've had at parties, church, etc. The sauce was watery and the flavor lackluster. Suggestions for making it better would be welcomed!

I tried Nor's customization and it was awesome.  G'ma's Sweet Chili sauce and jellied cranberry.  Wow!  A big hit.  Just added a garlic clove, pepper, and a couple of jalapeño slices.

The flavor wasn't good at all. I ended up adding an equal amount of ketchup, a Tbs of dark brown sugar, a couple/three dashes of Tabasco and a pinch of cayenne. The Tabasco and cayenne really didn't give it any heat, just flavor. They were delicious after the changes

This was a good, quick, easy way to make something the kids enjoyed.  I wouldn't say it tasted just blow-your-doors off fantastic but it was a fabulous addition to our Super Bowl party.  I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

Very good and a party favorite for years.  I add a small amount of yellow mustard to cut the sweetness

This was a hit! 
I used Sweet Baby Ray's Raspberry Chipotle BBQ sauce and grape jelly.  I just measured to taste.  The Sweet Baby Ray's gave it a nice smokey kick.  Turned out great and so easy in the crock pot!

I halved this recipe and used Sticky Fingers BBQ sauce, and used half grape jelly and half pepper jelly. It was wonderful, especially with the Belgian waffles I made for brunch.

Excellent! Quick, easy and delicious. They were a hit at our football party and everyone  was surprised when I told gem grape jelly was mixed in. There were none left at the end of the day.

These were good but my kids were not wild about them. I followed the recipe exactly. I would try these again maybe cutting down the grape jelly by half or more. Thank you!

Made this recipe for the first time today and everyone absolutely loved it. To add my own twist, I added fresh chopped garlic, smoked paprika and red chili flakes to give it a hint of spice.

Delicious!  I make it exactly as written. My kids request it several times a year and I also make it automatically for every big sporting event.
