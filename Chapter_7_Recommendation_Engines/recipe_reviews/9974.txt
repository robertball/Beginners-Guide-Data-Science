My kids think these are a strange texture, but agree they taste like you're eating mint chocolate chip ice cream.  Quite rich and would be pretty on a plate of Christmas cookies because they look different than most cookies.

I  needed to use up some egg whites and thought I'd try this.   I love the ease of just popping it in the oven and leave it for the night.  It is very sweet.  I didn't have any mini morsels so I took regular chocolate chips and rough chopped them.  I think I would have liked it better if it had no nuts.

Very good. And easy to make.  One star less because the ingredients are not listed in the proper order.  It is so annoying when this happens.  I find I have to write the recipe out in the proper order and then check it off against the original list to ensure I haven't missed anything.  Anyway, I enjoyed the baked result.
