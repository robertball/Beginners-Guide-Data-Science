Yes, this is my recipe, but I just wanted to say/change one thing.  I'm not sure if I submitted it this way, or if it was changed, but I don't use green pepper in this dish.  I always use a red/yellow/orange pepper, because it needs the sweetness to balance out the hotness from the sausage and jalapenos.  Plus green peppers make me burp! Also, the way this is written, you should be able to get 6-8 servings out of this easily. Enjoy!!!

My whole family loved this recipe!  One problem...the recipe calls for a 12 oz. jar of jalapeno peppers.  Talk about a 3-alarm fire!!  Wayyyy too much peppers...a 1/4 of a jar will do just fine.  Also, I used turkey sausage to cut the fat.  Enjoy!

I LOVED this dish!! I made a few changes (no peppers or jalapenos, used tomatoes instead, and added some italian seasoning, skipped the cornstarch part because my sauce was thick enough already) I wasn't a fan of the italian sausage we got, so I ate mine without - still fantastic! Beware, however - this is not a "fix it & forget it" recipe - you're basically working on it right up until it's ready. If you're making it for company, I'd make the sauce a little while ahead and let it simmer or pan-cook it to reheat, and make the pasta right before serving. Excellent!!!

Although I changed the recipe a bit, the recipe was loved by all family members!
I omitted the jalapenos, green peppers and used sundried tomato sausage in place of the hot Italian. Wow!  Easy dish to modify and a GREAT starting point to a meal.

Loved it--the only change I would make is to use Cherry Peppers as it was not hot enough with the Jalapenos.  Will make it again.

I just finished making this dish and I have to say that I am disapointed.  It lacked so much flavor I had to totally doctor it up with salt,pepper, garlic & onion powder along w/paprika.  I also had to add a full cup of wine as well.  No cornstarch needed since it was thick enough too thick in fact that I had to add almost a whole can of chicken broth.  I didn't had the spice since my 5yr old will be eating it so not sure if that had anything to do w/the end result.  It made an awful lot so we'll have to make due.  Wish I wouldn't have wasted my ingredients or the 2 hrs it took to complete the dish. Won't be making this again.

I had leftover roast chicken and BBQ'd Italian sausage so I decided to use this recipe.  I sauteed the onion and garlic like the recipes says then I added 2 garden fresh tomatoes, the white wine and my leftover chicken, sausage and the boiled potatoes.  I added some chicken broth as well.  I didn't have any peppers but I added a few red pepper flakes for flavour.  I also omitted the cornstarch.  The recipe turned out great and my husband and 3 kids all liked it (which is not easy to accomplish!!).  This was a great way to use my leftovers and I will definitely keep this one in my recipe box.

Holy smoke!  WAAAAAAY to much jalapenos, on top of hot sausage.  I only added 6 oz jalapenos and it just about killed me.  And I LIKE spicy food.  Other than that, it was so-so.  Don't think I'll make it again.

I had leftover chicken and potatoes and decided to give this recipe a try. It was just ok. I did use a cherry pepper instead of jalepeno and a yellow pepper, not green. The boys enjoyed all the meat but the sauce was only passable. Should have put the wine in my glass instead :)

If you have leftover chicken and/or italian sausage this is a great recipe to go with that.   I skipped the green pepper but added sundried tomatoes and a can of chicken broth (adjust the cornstarch until you get the right thickness)  Top off with some pine nuts and fresh parmesan.  Also, a whole jar of jalapenos seemed like overkill so I just chopped up a few hot cherry peppers.  Good stuff!

This was only so-so for me. As another reviewer already noted, WAAY to much jalapeno pepper. Also, it didn't seem very "italian".

Looked and smelled good, but didn't form the sauce like the recipe said. Was tasty, but not overly and seemed to be missing 'something'.

I made it with the sun dried tomato sausage and orange peppers and banana peppers - for the kids' sake.

It was good.  It was still a bit spicy for the kids, but I'll likely make it again.
