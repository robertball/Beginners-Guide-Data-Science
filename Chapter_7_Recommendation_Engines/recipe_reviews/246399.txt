This dough came together perfectly.  I didn't need to add or reduce any of the liquid and it patted out to the perfect consistency.   I cut the recipe in half and made larger biscuits, so, my dough gave me eight biscuits.  They took 17 minutes to cook and were golden brown.   My biscuits did not get too dark on the bottom and were lightly browned with a slight crunch.  The inside of the biscuit was dense and not fluffy like I like in a biscuit, but, more than likely that is my fault.  I typically tend to work the dough to much and end up with a tough biscuit.

Really delicious biscuits! I was looking for a recipe that matched one I had lost and this came the closest to what I remembered. These are really light and flaky and easy to make. The only changes I made were to up the buttermilk from 1 1/3 cups to 2 cups, so they weren’t as dry and also I added 1/4 cup of white sugar. They are excellent!! The added buttermilk really made a difference, but it added about 5-8 minutes to the baking time. 
I have made these biscuits twice now, even adding shredded sharp cheddar cheese to have them alongside my chowder. Really, really yummy!! I’m keeping this recipe!!

These were fantastically delicious. I'm never backing biscuits without a cast iron skillet again!

Except for halving the recipe, I followed directions exactly. Have made a lot of biscuits in my day, and most often in my trusty cast-iron skillet. The biscuits from this recipe were unfortunately rubbery. Maybe it's a matter of personal taste (or texture preference) but these were far from my favorite.

easy peasy
I didn't have cream of tar tar so I used 1 teaspoon of white vinegar and were perfect.

Bring back memories of our family to rise early wake-up and enjoy coffee and breakfast at the table with eggand bacon sausage and bacon on on a good morning.
