Just what I was looking for - I substituted bowtie pasta for the spaghetti, and added mushrooms - it was a nice break from dressing, gravy, mashed potatos, etc.

Very good - easy and flavorful. I used whole wheat pasta and my husband could not tell.

Great flavors and easy to make. I substituted harvest pasta to stay with the seasonal theme.
