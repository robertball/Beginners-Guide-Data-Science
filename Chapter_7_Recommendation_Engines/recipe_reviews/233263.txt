I used a different baking method (rolled mine into a log and refrigerated for about 2 hours, then sliced and baked for 10 minutes at 325), and added chopped maraschino cherries to my dough. For half of my cookies I melted milk chocolate and spread it over the bottom halves and sprinkled with chopped almonds, the others I left plain. We really enjoyed both versions! Very soft, tender cookie - and so pretty with the chocolate and almonds!

Made as the recipe stated apart from not adding the white corn syrup to the milk chocolate - and took the shortbread from the oven 7 minutes early. Surprised how well they cut and didn't crumble. Husband said they may be the best cookies ever - which is high praise, indeed!

DO NOT BAKE FOR 30-35 MINUTES!!!!!!!! I found that 10-15 minutes was plenty for these cookies, even leaving the ends a little more then golden brown and I needed to throw those pieces out. I still ended up with 20 cookies instead of 24.
