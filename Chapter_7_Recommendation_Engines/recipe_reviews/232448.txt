Refreshing, refreshing, refreshing!!! It is delicious and because the honeydew is naturally sweet I didn't have to add more sugar than the recommended and I neither changed anything to this recipe.

Refreshing and so light tasting!  I made with cantaloupe instead, as that is what I had.  I also substituted mango juice for part of the water. 5 Star drink for our girl's luncheon!!!
