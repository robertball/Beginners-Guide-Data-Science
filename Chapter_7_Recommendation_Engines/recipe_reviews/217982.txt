This is definitely a crowd pleaser! Fill them with your favorite toppings or with nothing at all. I used the beef filling from the recipe except that I added a handful of golden raisins to it. My daughters loved them!

My husband is from Puerto Rico, and after eating so many delicious Puerto Rican meals, this recipe made my mouth water as I read it.  Our 4 yr old daughters devoured this!  I used Adobo to season the tostones/plantain after the 2nd frying. We also made our own sofrito and froze the extras- well worth it and easy!!  This recipe is a keeper!

This was delicious! I was crunched for time so I smashed all of the plantains in a glass baking dish, topped it with a beef, green onion, and cheese filling and baked for 10! It turned out great as a pie!

Watched the video. Very easy to make. The boys loved smashing them.
