I was born and live in Baltimore Maryland and worked at three fine dining resteraunts growing up. A maryland crab cake is crab meat, mayonaise, eggs,bread crumbs, and spices, the BEST is the McCormick crab cake classic recipe its nots cheap  but it allows the rich clean flavor of the crab meat to come through in the finish product if they sell the seasoning in your supermarket try it..p.s. A MARYLAND CRABCAKE IS BROILED NEVER FRIED OR PANFRIED

The pancake batter (which BTW is not original to the "true" Maryland crabcake, masks the flavor of the crabmeat.

Wow! This is an awesome and amazingly easy recipe!

I served it on a bed  of romaine with a chili mayo sauce drizzled over the cakes.  Yum!

Hint to all use Bisquik instead of pancake mix. The consistency was perfect!

Old bay automatically makes this a five star recipe and if you are not from the Eastern Shore of MD where we good country folk live and breathe seafood, yes you would beleive that you broil a real MD Crabcake and not fry it...NOT SO! ALL of the BEST restaurants on the Eastern SHore fry them...Old Mill, Suicide's...can NOT wait to get back! And for the lady who said it was a crab pancake, use less pancake mix. There are MANY variations, you may want to try bread crumbs. I have even done them with Hawaiian rolls. No imitating a MD Crab cake!

The sweetness in the pancake mix goes well with the crab.  I added a little Old Bay instead of parsley.

This was not as good as I thought it would be. The pancake mix made it too doughy, but if you don't use as much as recipe calls for, it won't stay together while cooking in oil. It tastes more like a crab pancake.

I am a not so very good cook, or so my kids tell me, and despite the fact that I am almost sure i messed this up just a bit, they tasted fantastic! Super easy and really yummy! Thanks
I did use old bay instead of parsley as well, and LOVED the fact that I could cook this with things I had on hand!

This is the best MARYLAND CRAB CAKE recipe that i have ever used. I've used it 3 times and everyone loves it. I made two changes. one I used Old Bay instead of parsley and I didn't use mayo (never have any) and it still came out great! Thanks Robert for this fantastic recipe!!!

It is a wonderful recipe, it's very quick and easy and they looked gorgeous when I put them on the table.... even my picky 3 year old wanted a taste!!!! I used canned crab meat because that's what I had on hand.... next time I will definitely use fresh and a little Old Bay seasoning.  Perfect 10!!!!

This is the easiest and best recipe I have tried. We could easily taste the crab and the pancake mix held it together nicely. If it is doughy, you probably used too much pancake mix. This will be the go to recipe for crab cakes.

Very easy and delicious….I substituted walleye for the crab meat and sautéed onion, parsley, garlic and shredded carrot and added it to the flaked walleye, kept the other ingredients that the recipe called for.

I'm a native Marylander living in California. I'm also not much of a cook. With the understanding that these are *not* what you're going to find in a Baltimore restaurant, they are nevertheless super tasty and a cinch to make. Another reviewer has condemned the pancake mix as altering the flavor and texture one would expect from a crabcake. That is true, but I think the crab still stands out, and I'm looking forward to making this recipe a lot. I've also prepared this recipe as crab bites, to good effect.

I basically followed this recipe but I have a total aversion to frying anything. So I found another All-Recipes crab-cake recipe that called for cooking them with a pat of butter on the griddle...best of both worlds! Just grill 5 minutes on each side. (I also added minced onion and a little Old Bay seasoning to the mix) I loved the fact that I could use my 7-grain pancake mix too!

I had about a half pound of crab to use and gave this recipe a try (scaled down -- thanks for that feature, AllRecipes).  I'm not a crab cake purist, but I thought it was delicious.  I did not fry the cakes, though; I sauteed them in a little olive oil.  I wanted a crispy texture, so I patted some panko crumbs on the outside before I put them in the pan. I had no yellow mustard, but Dijon worked fine.  I added about a teaspoon of Sriracha and served them with a spicy remoulade.  I'll be making these again!

I was simply disappointed with this recipe. My heart just broke. I've had many a crab cake. And this one had less breading to the recipe that I was tickled pink about. While mixing the ingredients prior to frying, the flavor was rather descent. 1st off...3 cups of oil to fry in?? I couldn't believe that. It was way too much, I tried with 1 cup and when I put in the 1st one...it spread and broke apart all over the pan. It wouldn't hold it's shape at all in that much oil. So I cleaned up the mess and tried again by cutting the oil down to 1/2 cup in my frying pan and used an ice cream scooper to portion out each patty...it worked better as I didn't spread each all the way until I saw I was getting a nice color on the bottom and they were staying together better. While they looked beautiful...they ended up loosing the flavors all together. Totally and utterly flavorless. I'm still totally shocked. The only way my family would eat them was to whip up some Garlic Dill Aioli and spread over the top to add flavor. As is, I won't be making these again. Sorry, and to think I don't ever remember Maryland Crab cakes like this. Somethings a miss here.

I was fortunate enough to have married a beautiful girl from Maryland almost 46 years ago. It was by her at Hausner's Restaurant on Eastern Avenue in Baltimore that I was introduced to my first “Maryland Crab Cake.” It was at Hausner’s that I fell in love again from the first bite, of the crab cake that is! From that eventful moment on, I have had many, many crab cakes at many many fine restaurants, in many, many cities. Even in Maryland, every restaurant you visit says, "Maryland Crab Cake" yet they are as diverse as the Caesar salad is in Tijuana Mexico, and Southern California...or even Maryland, if it comes to that! Now, almost every crab cake I've eaten is very good, as is this one, even though they are all very different. The only thing they have in common is they all start off with crabmeat.  A recipe is really only a single moment in time, and no recipe can ever be prepared the exact way every time! I just don't believe in taking perfectly good "backfin" crab meat, and “flaking it!”

This Jersey girl has made a lot of crab cakes but this will be my only recipe from now on! I love Maryland & have vacayed there many summers. Hubby & I have critiqued many a crab cake dinner.  Some fried, some broiled. This recipe is the bomb! I read the reviews & added Old Bay & cut the Bisquick to two tbls. Yum!

Absolutely loved this recipe and was a huge hit today! I made a few of them before serving them and decided the grip I was serving needed a little more kick to it so I added more hush puppy mix, added shredded cheese, cayenne pepper, garlic, natures seasoning and sugar. They inhaled them literally, 120 of these gone within 20 minutes!!!

Fantastic recipe!   Absolutely loved it and so did everyone else!   Use bisquick as it has no "pancake" flavor.   Will make this time and time again!

Very easy recipe, no fillers, just what i was looking for.  I coated it with bread crumbs before frying it to give it a good crisp.

I love this recipe!  I've made it a couple of times now and I make it just like the recipe states without any changes.  I made it for my in-laws and they were disappointed that I didn't make enough.

Made this quick and easy recipe last night. I used Bisquick mix and I had to use dry parsley because I didn't have fresh. It was quite good. I followed the ingredient measurements exactly so if I need to make alterations in the future I know what to base it on.  I used 8 ounces of lump crab meat and 8 ounces of claw crab meat . VERY simple and tasty go-to crab cake recipe for me!

This is not a Maryand style crab cake. The pancake mix masks flavors, and easily forms a weird texture.

I tried this recipe and modified it a bit. I used lump crabmeat, added sour cream, old bay and a bit more dry mustard. I think next time I'll add corn and a pinch of lime juice to the batter.

I have lived around the Chesapeake bay all my life.  This style cake is by far the best. I like to add some finely chopped/minced veggies  like peppers and/or onions.

They fell apart, tried to salvage by adding more egg and cracker crumbs, helped a little.

Following the recommendation of other reviewers, I used 2 Tbl  of pancake mix.   I didn't like the consistency with the pancake mix, it was a bit spongy.  Flavor wise it was very bland, even using a slightly stronger polish mustard,  a touch of Worcestershire, a good shake of Nature's Seasonings and an extra tablespoon of freshly chopped parsley.  Rather than frying, I baked the cakes at 375 for about 25 minutes.   They were good, but not outstanding.

I haven't had crab cakes in a long time and have been craving it. It turned out okay with frozen crab meat I've brought at Aldi's back in February. They tasted delicious for five crab cakes. Real easy and tasty too.
