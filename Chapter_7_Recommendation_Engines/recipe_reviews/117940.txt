Yummy! I changed the recipe slightly - had no cream of celery soup on hand, so instead, I used cream of onion, and only one actual onion instead of two. Would put more sausage in next time because that's the best part! Delicious. Will make it again.

Very nice, filling supper. I used blanched corn that I had in the freezer and put it in when I assembled the dish. I also added garlic, pepper, paprika and caraway seed. My family loved it! Thanks!

This was good, solid comfort food.  I used turkey brats and only did 2 layers, although I'm not really sure why layers are necessary at all.  It all gets mixed together anyway.  Some people may find it a bit bland since there really isn't any seasoning in it.  We just added pepper.

Excellent, my family loved it.  It is comfort food.  I added more sausage and pepper and paprika to give it a little zing.

This was pretty good. It took over 7 hours for my potatoes to cook though. I cut the recipe in half and used 2 red potatoes, 1 large smoked sausage, one whole can of cheese soup, peas and carrots, and I left out the onion and cream of celery soup out (we don't care for it). I was worried this was going to be bland so I added garlic to every layer. This might be more flavorful with nacho cheese soup.

This ended up very watery . . . it was more like soup.

Did not like this at all. Taste was bland and once cooked it was just a pile of mush. I will not make again.

Nothing special about this one.  Everyone ate it, nobody complained, nobody asked me to make it again.  So I won't.

A nice warm comfort dish. I think it would be good with broccoli too. I did add some seasonings. Salt, pepper, garlic. My three year old ate it too. Thanks for sharing.

Filling and delicious - we like things a little spicy, so I added a generous sprinkle of Mrs Dash Extra Spicy and used a spicy italian.  Stretch the recipe a little by adding a bottom layer of potato.
