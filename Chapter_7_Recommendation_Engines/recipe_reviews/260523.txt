I have made these before and they are pretty good- however eggs are not vegan.  Vegetarian, yes, but not vegan.

I made it with 1 egg, 1 banana, and vanilla. These were ok banana eggs, but not pancakes. I was still really hungry after eating them. Maybe two eggs and a banana might be better? To make them pancakes next time I may try almond flour...

I did understand why this would appeal to some people---my granddaughter who is into everything healthy thought it was better than I did.  So I'm rating this for myself.  The cooking time must have been off because it was not very well done, and when I tried to make it brown up better, it just didn't work for me.  I did use the optional vanilla, but it could have used a little baking powder and maybe some cinnamon.  I really do appreciate the idea, and this would appeal to many people, so don't just go by MY review!  :)

I made it with only egg and banana, and they tasted fine, but turned out very soft. If I were to make it again, I would add flour to bind everything together better.
