I am sold on using cedar planks to cook fish. I followed the recipe except that I had a nice 1 inch thick steak of fresh caught Alaskan Halibut instead of cod. I also used Fines Herbs and lemon pepper along with seasonings specified in the recipe. The honey butter gave a nice golden finish to the fish. The trick is to soak that cedar plank in water for at LEAST 3 hrs. In my case I soaked it overnight. My meat-grilling husband loved this recipe and told me to make sure and buy more fish. The flavor was superb. Thanks Trishie for sharing this on your blog!

I was skeptical about the honey but I gave it a shot.  I made it for 2 servings as the recipe indicated and I made 6 more servings without it.  We did not care for the cod with the honey and nobody finished their portion.  The other servings were just OK.  Wont make again.

This was not very good.  Something just wasn't right with the honey flavor.  Will not try again.  Cedar planking is a great way to grill fish but I will try other seasoning.

I used fresh caught catfish instead of cod (got the okay from the recipe submitter before doing so) and we enjoyed this. We liked the honey butter  along with the smokey flavor the cedar gave it. I did add some black pepper and some extra parsley but that is just a personal preference.  Thanks Trishie for a great new way to eat our catfish!

Tried this out last night on some Ling Cod I brought back from Alaska. I liked the hint of sweetness from the honey and rosemary, and added a 1/2 tsp Old Bay to spice it up a bit more. I ground all the seasonings up in a mortar and pestle and then sprinkled them on both sides of the fish steaks. Yum. Cedar planking is the way to grill fish. Good, quick and tasty recipe.

Since I didn't have an outdoor grill and a plank, I've cooked it on the skillet  with olive oil for 20 minutes over medium-low heat and passed on steps 1 and 3.  I also don't fish and fresh fresh are expensive, I've used Aldi's frozen cod which turned out okay.  I might make this again.

I was a little afraid of the honey, so i decreased the amount to just a little bit.  It added just a slight touch of sweetness, which  made it nice.  i wouldn't have liked it any sweeter.  The cedar did not overpower the flavor of the cod.  It was a nice complement!  I will make it again.

Excellent!  I had only used a plank for salmon, but this turned out yummy!  Will make it again!

This was a huge hit at the potluck I bbq'd this at. I used basil and oregano instead of rosemary and parsley, just because that is what I had. I will for sure make this again.

Very delicious recipe. My family enjoyed the slight sweetness from the honey , but especially the smokey flavor from the cedar plank.  I love grilling fish this way.
