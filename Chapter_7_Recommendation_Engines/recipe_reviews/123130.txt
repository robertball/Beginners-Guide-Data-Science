I was very skeptical, but these were really ALOT like the elephant ears you'd get from the fair.  All the other recipes on this site called for yeast and tons of ingredients and required rising time and I'd doubt if the slight difference in taste would be worth all the trouble.  A really great recipe!!!

I have been craving an elephant ear for over a week now, and this recipe just hit the spot!  The key to the decadence is to brush them with butter before you add the cinnamon and sugar.  Since you're eating fried white flour, you might as well add the butter and enjoy it!  YUM!

Four stars for a great taste similar to one found at your local carnival, yet done with such simplicity. No mess, no wait, no complaints!

I make this all the time for my son.  The only thing I do differently is that I have to cut the tortillas so that he can eat them (he is only 2 and giving him a whole one would just be a disaster).  Not my favorite, but definately great when you need something quick and easy.  Thanks for the post.

COOL!  I just tried this and scaled the recipe to 2 servings, just to be safe.  It turned out great.  I needed to cook it longer to get it brown.  On the 2nd tortilla, I added a drizzle of honey to get the sugar to stick better, and it worked wonderfully.  Not as decadent as the fair, but definitely something that made my day!  VERY EASY TOO!

These are SUPER EASY and they taste good.  Of course not like the carnivals, but its a great quick treat to make.  This recipe is actually from the cookbook Tate of Home and I originally saw it in there and tried it.

Very good, and cheap to make. Great for a party or if you have kids. I cut them in half, but for small children I'd do quarters. Reminds me of the twists from taco bell.

I've been making these for years only because I didn't want to pay for them at a restaurant. I make these to go along with mexican dishes. It's nice to have something sweet after something spicy. I cook mine so they're crunchy but not dark.

So easy and so yummy!  Not quite the same as you get at the carnivals, but great none the less :) If you're a brown sugar lover like me, try half white sugar and half brown. I tried it and it was fantastic!

Great easy recipe! My mom used to make these for us when we were little and I wanted to make them for my kids and this was the perfect home recipe. The kids loved them and my 5 year old was able to help put the sugar coating on, which he really enjoyed. We used a cinnamon blend that included nutmeg, allspice, ginger, orange peel & cloves in addition to the cinnamon and it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

Easy and tasty. Just be very careful when frying in a skillet, and make sure to let the oil get hot enough.

I used to manage a Taco Bell and after frying in the morning, we'd fry a few soft taco tortillas and sprinkle with cinnamon/sugar for the twists.  So easy and so good.

These were very easy to make. My kids were not big fans. They were passble but I would not serve them to company. Too much of an oily taste for me. I probably won't make these again.

I make these often when someone wants a little something sweet. I simplify the process by spraying with cooking spray and placing in my toaster oven for about 5 to 7 minutes then sprinkling with the sugar mixture. My family always enjoys them.

These are a Mexican comfort food traditionally called buñuelos and if you can't make the tortillas your self try using a gordita tortilla makes it so much better, so fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Also try mixing up the toppings, honey, bananas w/ chocolate syrup are really good!!!

Very quick and easy. Not the same as authentic elephant ears, but a terrific recipe in its own. Thank you Terry! ***UPDATE*** These work just as well with whole wheat tortillas.

I had to use corn tortillas because that was all i had. Still pretty good and I am sure with the flour tortillas It would be a 5 so that is what I gave it. 3- or 4 if using corn tortillas.

So easy, and very tasty!!!  We were at a baseball game today and my kids were begging for elephant ears...being cheap, I said "we'll make them at home tonight".  So grateful for this recipe - close enough to the real thing in a matter of minutes! :)

nice treat, close to the fair thing. My 7 year old loved them. In Canada, we call 'em Beaver Tails. Drizzle with lemon juice for a Killaloe Sunrise flavor.

These elephant ears are great! My husband was very skeptical, but after he tasted them, he loved them. They are delicious and easy to make.

I ended up having way to much on the stove to fry these into the bowl shape I wanted so I ended up shoving them down into a jumbo muffin tins and baking them at 425 instead. They turned out very good and I imagine they would be that much better fried plus they are super super easy! I used them for a "serving dish" for fried ice cream.

I did not tell my kids that these were elephant ears, just in case they'd be disappointed in the crispiness. They loved them! They said, "You could make these and sell them!" and "You're a good cook, mom!" 

I have made elephant ears from scratch before, and this was so much easier and just as tasty. I will never make from scratch again.

OMG!  These hit the spot!  I tried them three different ways. The first one I cooked I sprinkled with powdered sugar. Very tasty. The next one I brushed melted butter on then sprinkled with the cinnamon sugar mix. Heavenly!  The last one I brushed with butter only then cut into wedges to dip in honey like a sopapilla.  Loved it!

Verdict:  The cinnamon sugar was my favorite and tasted the most like the fair version. The honey will be my go to substitute.

I tried this for the first time tonight and thought it was excellent!  I made three ears, one for each of us and each turned out a bit differently.  The first one I took out too soon (so not as puffy and a bit softer), the 2nd was perfect, and the 3rd was just slightly overdone.  They tasted yummy anyway, but if your first one doesnt turn out right, try again.  I think it takes a few times to get the right timing and heat setting.  One ear was plenty for each of us - very filling!  And cutting it in half is way easier to eat as well. Come to think of it, the 2nd ear was cut in half before cooking, so maybe that's why it turned out so great - it puffed up better.
