I loved this recipe! So did my husband and kids! I had a huge zucchini, and was looking for something new. This was awsome! I think it would also be good with some hamburger meat or sausage with extra cheese melted over the top. mmm I can't wait to try it! Oh, it was also very easy to make.

Excellent recipe!  Only thing I did differently was to add 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning in place of the parsley.  Even my kids loved it!  I will definitely make this again!

This was very good.  My veggie loving daughter loved it, and my veggie hating daughter tolerated it.  I enjoyed it.  It was very comforting on a cold evening.  I think it could be used with a variety of vegetables.

I really liked this.  The combination of flavors and textures works well.  The only changes I made:  added 1 sliced shallot, 2 tablespoons parmesan cheese and I substituted 1/3 cup flour with 2 teaspoons baking powder for the 1/4c biscuit mix I didn't have.

Pretty good, I increased the baking mix to 1/2c. and omitted the butter. I also added a large garlic clove minced.  A nice side dish to grilled London broil and Crispy Cucumbers and Tomatoes in Dill Dressing from this site. Will probably make again. Thanks!

Not really a souffle. Not bad, but not much to it.

I used fresh garlic because I didn't have powdered.  I also added jalapenos because I wanted a kick.  This is incredibly delicious!  It's the best use I've found for that late-season zucchini.

Zucchini Souffle Haiku: "Not quite a 'souffle', but still, this is darn tasty! Had to change the cheese." I had all of the ingredients available other than the cheese, so I used half parmesan, half mozzarella. I also had a sad chunk of onion and some getting-close-to-slimy baby bellas in the fridge that I needed to use, so I lightly sauteed them in butter, and that was the butter in the recipe's ingredient list, so I just sprayed a 9" glass pie pan w/ non-stick spray. Mine was done in about 40 min. so I would recommend checking well b4 the 45-60 min. directions. Very very tasty brunch w/ fruit, and the leftovers were even better.

I tried this recipe to use up some extra zucchini I had on hand. I served it to 4 kids, aged 4-7, who all loved it and had seconds. I loved it too and will definitely make again.

This gets 5 stars because it's so easy, and very adaptable! This time I added a chopped, seeded jalape√±o & some finely chopped onion, and topped with a little salsa. It was very tasty. Oh- and I doubled the bisquick & added 1/4 cup of milk to make it fluff up a little more this time. My sister used goat cheese and thyme as her herb-cheese combo. We love this recipe idea, thanks for sharing.
