Very tasteful.  Requires a bit of work, but certainly some of the best we have had.

I made these last night and marinated the meat like suggested....after cooking the meat definitley needed salt. The flavor was OK-the lime was too overpowering for my Husband and I didn't use as much as the recipe called for. I guess I expected more and wasn't impressed at all.

Don't waste your time or ingredients! My fiance and I made this dish tonight and literally ended up throwing the whole thing away because we couldn't stand the taste. The lime was way too overpowering and was really hard to stomach. It's a good thing we had left-overs otherwise we would have rather gone hungry.

I used this recipe for New Years.  I decided to make half a batch of beef and another of chicken.  I cut back on the lime juice and adjusted some of the other ingredients "by pinches".  The beef was OK but the chicken was awful.  Don't know what I could have done differently but it was truly a waste.  Don't make my mistake!!

Awsome recipe!  But what can you expect from Southern Living Magazine. My brother thought he was eating at an "authentic" Mexican restaurant.  Everyone enjoyed this dish very much.  I served them with Dee's famous salsa and re-fried beans.
