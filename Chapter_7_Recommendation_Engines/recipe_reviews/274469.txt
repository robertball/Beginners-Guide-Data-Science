Absolutely delicious, and a great way to have cookies ready to serve within minutes for unexpected guests.  They are buttery, with just the right amount of sweetness.  Very easy to make too!  Very versatile recipe - use pink or blue sprinkles for a baby shower, red and green for Christmas.  The chilled dough is also yummy (even though I know I shouldn't eat it, given the egg).  I'll be making these again and again.

Great cookie. I bake cookies at least 4 times a week for a program I run so any corners I can cut, I do. I always skip the “creaming” process and melt my butter and/or shortening. I know baking  experts will say that affects texture or rise, but this has never been the case for me. For this recipe I did the same and cookies were a hit. Similar to a shortbread but slightly less dense. Second time around I did mini chocolate chips directly mixed  into the dough.  Thank you for the recipe. Helpful to have a specific freezer cookie when baking so much every week!

Nice easy little butter cookie.  Sliced best when very chilled or even still a little frozen
