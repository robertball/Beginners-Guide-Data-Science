I suggest thawing the frozen strawberries a little [otherwise it takes forever to blend them, I know because I'm speaking from experience]. I also made it 1 cup of rum, it just tasted virgin without the extra half cup. Otherwise this recipe is pretty delicious! I also recommend making the cream from scratch, it just makes it even better, and then swirl it into the drink versus just on top! :]

My blender wasn't big enough to accommodate the entire recipe at once. I had to divide the recipe and combine when done, but it tasted wonderful!

Great recipe. Thaw the strawberries a little before using or it's a little too frozen to sip through a straw. I lower the amount of sugar used and it still tastes great.
