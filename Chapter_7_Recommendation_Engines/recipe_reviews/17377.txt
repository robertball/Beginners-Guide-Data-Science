I made this recipe and it was yummy.  However, I suggest that you only fill the muffin cups 2/3 of the way, instead of 3/4 because they end up looking like muffins (way too high), rather than cupcakes.  I will also probably lessen the milk a bit the next time, because it came out too soft and was disintegrating people were eating it.

These cupcakes are pretty good, but nothing exceptional.  Also, the instructions are misleading; they say to cream 3 Tbsp. of butter with 1 1/2 cups of sugar. It's virtually impossible to cream such a small amount of butter with 8 times the amount of sugar!  The butter will never get creamy, but will stay overly grainy and sugary from all that sugar.  A much better and simpler way is to melt the butter and add it to the wet ingredients, and then add the sugar to the dry ingredients. The best part about these cupcakes is they are lowfat!

Very easy and tasty (with and without icing).  I found that it will make 30 cupcakes (don't fill each cup as full as stated, closer to 1/2).  They will be the perfect size for icing.  If you aren't planning on icing them you could make 24 cupcakes.  I made these with the help of a 3 yr old and a 1 yr old.  They both love them!  I did need to bake them a bit longer (about 10 min) but our oven usually needs a bit longer so others might not not need to.

WOW! These were awesome! They are very cake-like and soft, and are amazing without any icing. 
I filled the muffin cups about halfway and they rose right to the top of the cups and made 15(I halved the recipe).. there really wasn't a size problem for me. Thank you!

AMAZING!! i have been baking for a long time. it a passion of mine... let me tell you these cupcakes are deadly. i could not get enough. i was searching for a new chocolate cupcake recipe and i came across this one... i was a little hesitant at first, due to some of the reviews. but wow. almost tastes like a brownie... i guess i should probably mention that i did change the recipe a little. i used 1/2 Cup of butter instead of 3 tbls. that just didn't make sense to me. and like other reviewers i only filled half way and made 20 large cupcakes, they came out so perfect. i cant even say it enough. they are moist and flavourful and the top is almost crisp. oh so good. i cooked for a little less than called for and i also cooked them at 325.. i used a classic butter icing. yum! in fact i might just have to make them tonight.

Ok, the recipes says it makes 16 cupcakes. I made 18 and had TONS of batter left over. Not only that, but even with the cups half full (large cups) they over flowed. And fell. And were that kind of too moist texture.

Not well done at all.

These turned out so good!  I had some buttermilk to use up so I subbed that for the regular milk.  I recommend it if you've got some on hand.  I frosted with a rich semisweet/bittersweet chocolate frosting.

These were quick and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly, and mine came out moist, with a good flavor. I decided that they didn't really need any frosting. I brought some to a friend to surprise him for his birthday. About half a dozen people tried them, and they were all impressed. Somebody asked whether I'd used a mix.

I thought this recipe was great!  They were moist and fluffy, the perfect amount of flavour, and they're low in fat.  What more could you ask for?

This recipe is great! My cupcakes came out light and airy. The batter was the consistency of thick mousse.
I made 3 changes:
1 - I used almost double the butter. It made creaming the sugar much easier and added a creamy flavor.
2 - I used a full TBSP of vanilla

I will also say that the yield is much higher than stated - I filled my cups 1/2 way and got almost double the amount of cupcakes. They rose beautifully.

If cooking in silicone pans, add about 3 minutes to your cooking time.

bland & dry. The batter tasted good but the end result was like chocolate day old bread. i wish i would have read more reviews before wasting my time. Like someone else said... you cant make fluffy that little bit of butter with all that sugar. (THAT should have been my cue for the dry result) ALSO.. people who rate the recipe 5stars AFTER they make their changes should not be rating at all. That is a new recipe and you are leaving this one with a lie. im ticked i wasted my time.

This recipe saved my sanity and my daughter many tears. I promised her chocolate cupcakes for school (now today), but fell asleep around 10:00pm.  No worry; I'll run the 24-hour market and get a box cake mix...except when I got there at 1:15am it was closed! New hours are that they close at 1:00am. OK, now I'm panicing and running to a 7/11.  In defeat I came home, said a prayer and got on AR and found this recipe.  I'M NO LONGER AFRAID OF BAKING CHOCOLATE CAKES!!!!!  The cupcakes were incredibly easy to make, I had all the ingredients on hand and they are tasty (at least from the batter) and gorgeous. No sunken middles.  I didn't change a thing. Thanks for a great recipe and for saving the day!!!!!!!

Very unsatisfactory recipe.  It says it makes 30 cupcakes, but really it only makes 16.  If you fill the cups 3/4 full as the recipe indicates, the cupcakes dome too high.  The muffin cups should only be filled a scant 2/3 full for the proper height.  The flavor is only so-so and the texture is dry and too dense.  They were extremely easy to make, which is why I chose the recipe.  But I would not make them again. I made these for my son's second grade class...if I were making them for adults with more discriminating palates, I would toss them and start over with a different recipe.

OK That's it! This is the best recipe for chocolate cupcakes from now on. I used margarine instead of butter and replaced the vanilla essence with chocolate essence for extra choc flavour and they turned out beautifully. My new silicone cases worked a treat with a fine mist of canola oil before filling, no sticking and no need to run around picking up paper wrappers in the aftermath. No frosting required. Perhaps a little dusting of icing sugar if you can't resist making them prettier. The recipe made 26 nicely sized cupcakes for all the little kids at playgroup.

In cooking, just like in clothes, you will always need basics. This are a fabulous basic cupcake, perfect for dressing up or dressing down. The only bad thing about this cupcake is that it dries out over time, but by adding chocolate chips to the batter, you extend the moistness by a few days.

This was a poor recipe. The Cupcakes were more candy like than cake. This is due to the fact the butter sugar ratio is WAY off. It is impossible to cream 1 1/2c of sugar with 3 tbls of butter AND the recipe really makes 24 cupcakes. This recipe is not worth repeating.

Yum Yum! There's just something about a good chocolate cupcake and a cold glass of milk! This is a good chocolate cupcake. I read through ALL the reviews and decided to try the recipe "as is". I was happy that i did because it came out perfectly...chocolatey tasting and moist. The only thing I did do that others had suggested was to fill them 2/3 of the way full instead of 3/4. Doing this resulted in the cupcake rising just over the edge of the cupcake papers...perfect! I used unsweetened cocoa powder from King Arthur Flour, so it was a good quality cocoa powder and the flavor of the cupcake was all chocolate! Thank you!

I made this for my daughter's birthday party last August, I liked it so much, so I have decided to make it again this month for my other daughter's birthday party! I make my own Vanilla Buttercream icing for the top. I love it that it is lowfat too. My children love chocolate cupcakes and these were perfect for us!

Be very careful with this one. Make sure you are not just greasing your pans, use cupcake cups, these will totally stick. I would also recommend filling these up only about halfway, rather than 3/4 of the way. These will rise a lot, and eventually fall if they get too high.

This recipe was genius. They're very chewy and chocolatey which makes them delicious. I would recommend using a chocolate glaze and putting vanilla wafers flat on top of each cake. The wafer makes it have a crunchy texture. The glaze is a twist on the traditional creamy frosting. These were all around delicious!

The batter tasted so good, but these cupcakes didn't work out in the oven.  They overflowed/exploded and then caved completely in the center.  I had to throw away the entire batch and clean my oven.  I don't know how anyone got this recipe to work, because I specifically experimented with filling the cups to different levels.  The ones filled about halfway plumped up so beautifully to a crown, but then a minute or two later exploded just like the others.  Something is wrong with the chemistry of this recipe.

I made both these and the "Easy Chocolate Cupcakes" from this site and these won hands down. Great flavor and texture. The butter creamed into the sugar just fine. Not creamy, but light and fluffy as stated. I agree with others not to over fill them. I got 24 cupcakes from this recipe.

I was stuck without a cake mix and needed to make some cupcakes...cruised the cupcake aisle here and found these.... not bad, I did up the cocoa by a 1/4 cup and also used more milk (about a 1/4 cup as well) to make up for the extra dry ingredients.  Nice chocolate flavour, I filled the liners up a bit too much and they really puffed up, but I don't mind (more cupcake to eat!) :D Thanks for the recipe, may tweak it some more but wanted to stay really close to the original for the first time making it.

Loved this recipie. So very easy. I added milk and white choc chips, but did over fill my cups which I don't reccomend. Next time may use castor suger as it blends a bit easier with the butter.

I thought they came out amazingly! It was my first time making cupcakes since usually I would make cookies but they tasted delicious! The moisture was perfect and it wasn't super sweet. I did what others have suggested: melting butter and combining the wet ingredients first, then adding the sugar. I also added less milk - 200 ml. overall it was great!

Made these and added little moustaches of icing sugar for Movember fund raiser at work. Everybody loved them, I was hoping to have a couple left over for myself, but it wasn't to be.  I did have to use a bit more butter than the 3 tablespoons.

Delicious chocolate cupcakes with a light brownie taste going on. Not overly chewy, but chewy enough. I only used 1/2 cup of cocoa, and added 1 bag of instant vanilla pudding mix. Soooo good.

I did not care for this recipe!  As others said- they overflowed the cups, and then sank in the middle.  Unfortunately, I only saw the rave reviews before I tried this.  I looked at some other recipes- they all call for 1 teaspoon of baking powder, not the 2 in this one.

Baker beware: I made the recipe exactly and my batch yielded 24 standard-sized cupcakes instead of sixteen. The cupcakes are delicious and have a great texture. Simple and easy to make. Will definitely bake again.

i added semi-sweet chocolate chips and a couple teaspoons of  instant coffee (added to the milk to dissolve). i did have to bake for an additional 7 minutes, similar to the experiences of other users.  I topped it with vanilla cream cheese frosting.  Thanks for this easy recipe. =)

This is the BEST chocolate cupcake recipe of ALL TIME! Its NOT crumby or dry, and the cocoa powder was just the right amount to make the cupcake have that melted chocolate taste! It is extremely moist and basically melts in your mouth. This cupcake is now my signature chocolate recipe and everybody loves it! super easy too! LOVEEEE ITTTTT!  P.S i added about half a tablespoon of butter(maybe less) more to ensure extra moistness.

I used brown sugar instead of white, and just put 1 cup instead of 1.5 cups. Had just the right amount of sweetness for me! I baked it for 17 minutes and it turned out very moist inside. Perfect!

I just made these tonight.  I tasted the mixture before baking.... DE-LISH!!  I tested them at about 17 min...not cooked, so left them in a bit longer but my oven is horrible so ended up just a bit over-cooked.  I have no doubt these would be great so long as your oven works better than mine!  I topped them with a Raspberry Swiss Meringue Buttercream with a Raspberry on top.  Will definitely make again and hopefully not overcook them....

After reading most of the recent reviews, they were correct.  I made these as directed.  They are dry and very little taste.  I put peanut butter frosting & was not able to even taste the chocolate cupcake.  Very blah.  I will be trying another recipe next time.

Fantastic. I only used 1 cup sugar. For the 3T butter amount, I just beat it with 1/4 cup of sugar at a time, to blend it. It was very grainy of course, but by mixing it a little at a time this way, it worked just fine.

These cupcakes were great! Easy to make! I was able to get about 22 cupcakes. I substituted greek yogurt for the butter and they still came out tasting delicious. Also made a simple raspberry frosting for it. Everyone gobbled it up!

These cupcakes were soft and moist, and very tasty. Just perfect! I'm sure all the ladies at work will hate me tomorrow when I bring them into the office.

Not really sure where everyone's problem is with the cupcakes overflowing and falling. I followed the recipe, it made about 16 cupcakes, and they didn't overflow at all-- this recipe makes very moist and tender cupcakes. Yummy!

I followed recipe exactly and found it perfect.  Not too sweet (as we prefer it). And texture was moist and soft.  Bakes perfectly well rounded tops so its easy to frost. THX!

I was fairly dissapointed in this recipe.  I made it exactly as it says, and did not end up with good results.  There was enough batter for 18 cupcakes.  I put too much batter in the first batch that went in the oven... 2/3 full... they overflowed.(My own fault) So, the second batch I did 1/2 full, which looked to be perfect, but the crowns were so hard!  They were also very dry... not the moist cupcake I expected.  Will not make again.

I made two batches, one right after the next. They both tasted awful. The consistancy was weird- though the cupcakes were done (nothing left on a toothpick) whene aten, was like oatmeal- gooey and thick. The flavor wasn't great either. I am still looking for the best chocolate cpcake recipe. This was not it.

These were good but nothing special. I thought they were kind of dry by themselves. I put some whipped cream on top of them and that made it somewhat better. However, I don't think I'll be making this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing though.

ummm well they rose over the top when i put them 3/4 full, making them look like mushrooms. also, the inside tastes like fudge (it never did cook all the way through) and the outside is rock-hard. i dont think any of the modifications i made made it do that. i added 1 tblsp of melted semisweet chocolate, but thats it.

There was a major problem with sticking with these.  I also found that they needed to be baked longer. The flavor isn't that great either. Honestly, I would skip over this recipe.

Great recipe, definitely one thats easy to customize.  I added chocolate milk and followed a few of the other reviewers tips as well. Had to add an extra 5 min. but thats mostly due to my oven. Thanks for the recipe!

I remember making this recipe with my uncle last summer, and I made it with chocolate ganache. I remember it being very simple and easy, and I was going crazy just now trying to find the same recipe. I'm 13 years old, and it was really easy for me to make with barely any help. The batter was delicious and my aunt and I were eating it with our fingers. I think this is going to be my go-to chocolate cake recipe for the rest of my life. Thanks for putting it up, well done!

Suggestions;
First, sift together all the dry ingredients *including the sugar*. Melt the butter. It's cool, these aren't cookies. Add the milk to the dry ingredients first. Add the eggs one at a time. Add the melted butter. Add vanilla. Fill these between 1/3 and 1/2 full. They came out perfect. Filling to that level, I got 22, which is great because I need to make 33 and I know now that I can halve the recipe for the next batch and get exactly the right amount. By turning the temp dial to between 375 and 400, I was able to cook these in 22 minutes.

Was very good! My granddaughter had a birthday, so I made this with the chocolate buttercreme frosting for her basketball team.  It was a hit!  The girls loved it!!!  I don't like chocolate, so I had to get the grand kids to taste for me.  The girls thought that homemade was baking out of a box!!!!!  Wow!  When I told them I hadn't used a box mix in decades, they were tickled pink!  I told them I usually baked from scratch.   A Few of the girls asked me to be their new grandma!  Lol

I followed the recipie completeley and they turned out really bad. They were sunken in the middle and looked like they had exploded! I also had a bunch of batter left. I put the rest in a cake pan and that even came out bad. I would not make them again and do not reccomend to anybody.

I have not rated any recipes yet but I had to put in my opinion on this one. As I highly rated cupcake recipe this was extremely disappointing. I should have known better as two parts of the recipe struck me as odd: 1) the lack of butter and 2) filling the cups 3/4 full. So what I ended up was with mediocre chocolate muffins. These are not cupcakes.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for—simple and delicious.  I needed a chocolate cupcake recipe suitable for children, to eat and to make. I kept finding ones that were fancying up the cupcake or included coffee or ones that required a boxed cake mix.  Do I really need the internet to find a recipe if I have a boxed cake mix?  Thanks Rachael Ray, but no thanks. Seriously, I don't know how that woman has been so successful.  Anyway, this recipe was great.  The cupcakes came out moist and delicious.  I did add some chocolate chips and a tad more butter to make the butter/sugar combo a little fluffier.  But overall, I would recommend this recipe to anyway looking for easy yummy cupcakes.

Tried this recipe and found the cupcakes taste good. I agree with the previous reviewers that you should fill only 1/2 way and not 3/4 full.
I would decrease the sugar and increase the butter to 1/2 cup. Three tablespoons of butter is not enough. I also added 2 teaspoons of vinegar to the milk or you can use lemon juice. Overall, I would use recipe again with the above alterations. Made 18 cupcakes, but probably could yield 20-24.

These had a good chocolate taste, cake-like, cleanly removed from pan and muffin cups.  Followed the recipe with 2 minor changes - as recommended by another reviewer - melted butter and added to wet ingredients & sugar (reduced sugar to 1 cup) to dry ingredients.  Filled about 1/2 way and baked for full 17 minutes.  Ended up with 12 large cupcakes and 12 mini cupcakes.  Topped with Chocolate Ganache Frosting. Yum!

They came out with a more brownie than cake texture, but no one complained about it.  I did add orange zest.  Will make again.

recipe is very chocolaty and yummy. The 16 serving was a perfect amount for my 12 cup muffin stoneware. I filled them 3/4 fill and cooked them 4 minutes more then recommended and they came out moist. I sprinkled a caramel sprinkle to add a crunch.

I did all the correct directions and measurements and , the taste was not sweet at all they were extremely bland and such a disappointment after spending 30mins preparing and baking them... i do not reccomend this recipe if you are looking for a sweet and normal tasting chocolate cupcake

It's a keeper!  Used Rodelle Baking chocolate and cake/pastry flour.
Easy to make with my 4yr old grandson.  Delicious, chocolate flavor, moist cake.  Needed 5-10 more minutes baking time.

Not a good taste.  They are bland.  They are nothing special at all.  They are missing something.  I tried twice and no one liked them.  Sorry.

This is a very rich, true chocolate cupcake. If you want a milk chocolate cupcake or a lighter chocolate taste, this is not the cupcake for you. If you're like me and love chocolate, this is a fantastic moist cupcake.

Tips:
When the recipe says "cream together the butter and sugar" they don't mean cream. They mean mix really well. The butter is not going to cream because the ratio of butter to sugar is too low. It's going to look like more of a wet sand (clumpy sugar) than your normal cream. That's fine. The end result is delicious, and the cupcake gets the extra moisture when you add the eggs in the next step.

I also filled the cups closer to 2/3rds full, and it worked out perfectly. I paired it with a fantastic rich buttercream frosting.

I haven't tried them yet, but making enough for 8 cupcakes on the recipe and filling the cups to about 2/3 full made enough for 12 cupcakes.  I'm sure they will taste great!

After 20 minutes in the oven, they are a disaster.  They have overflowed the pan and don't show any signs of being done...  Regardless of what they taste like when they come out of the oven, they are not going to be pretty little cupcakes...and I filled the muffin cups just 2/3 full.

I did not care for this recipe. I baked a batch hopeing they were good from looking at the reviews but the cupcakes were not moist and were very DRY! I'm mean VERY DRY!! It also was way too chocolatey. They didn't even taste like cupcakes. Luckily, my frosting made then decent enough to finish eating. But I really was confused because everyone else said theses cupcakes were good so now I'm upset. But, I HIGHLY DO NOT RECEMMEND THIS RECIPE.

I baked a mini batch of these cupcakes (8 servings) following the recipe as closely as I could. My batter was a little bit runny, but the cupcakes baked beautifully. The cupcakes were moist, but not very chocolatey. I don't think I'll be making these again.

not bad... it was moist and tasted good.  Like other reviewers I found that 3tbs of butter could not cream the sugar - so I added more butter!  finally after doubling the butter i gave up.  They still turned out quite good.
I added peanut butter chippits and made a peanut butter frosting  -  my husband loves it frosted, but I prefer it without.

This is a good recipe! The flavor is awesome! However, since all ovens are not created equal, I would suggest that you adjust the cook time slighty. I baked mine for 15 minutes exactly and they were very dry. Overall, I love the recipe and plan to use it again!

These were a disaster for me because I filled the cupcakes 3/4 full:  then they came out like muffins, but the outside edge stuck to the pan and I had to cut them out.  Unattractive.  Then the next batch were too soft.  They looked worse because they caved in with the frosting.  Wish I had read the other reviews first! Lessen the milk and fill just over 1/2 way full.

I made this cupcake this morning with my twin toddlers. They are easy to make. I followed the recipe as it is, no frosting and came up with 24 cupcakes. I added marshmallows in the middle and was a bit scared it might get too sweet. It turned out perfect, this recipe doesn't make your cupcakes very sweet at all. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great cupcake.  I was able to make 19 using this recipe.  Used a basic buttercream on top.  One change I made - I wanted them reallllly chocolate-y and rich - was I folded in about 1/3 of a bag of chocolate chips before I poured the batter into the cups.  These would probably be good even without the chocolate chips though.    My daughter is an extraordinarily picky eater, quite the critic, and immediately gobbled one up.  Will definitely be making these again.  Thank you!

This recipe was fairly good. First of all I think there should be more butter, while mixing it, it had the weird texture of snow. Second way to much cocoa and not enough sugar or butter. If I was to add more butter, sugar and less cocoa, I believe this would of been a great recipe. Like another reviewer below said use only 1/2 cup of cocoa, a whole stick of butter instead of half, and maybe another 1/3 or 1/2 cup more sugar the cupcakes would of been moist and yummy. I appreciate the recipe it was good, but not great. It's all about trial and error.

Made these last night. I followed the recipe exactly, except for increasing the butter to 1/2c as others recommended and only filling the cups halfway full. Frosted them with a chocolate buttercream frosting. They were light and fluffy and moist. The kids loved them! Thank you for a great recipe!

Relatively easy to make and perfectly good. Mine were maybe just a little dry. Definitely have that cakey, bitter cocoa taste with a hint of sweetness. Next time I might seek out a more chocolate cake texture and taste, but if you are using a sweet frosting this could make for a good balance.

These are super great!!! I picked the recipe at first because I had all the ingredients, and now I'm glad I did. I didn't add all the sugar it called for. But I didn't shorten it by much. I just used 1 1/4 c. They still came out great!

The perfect chocolate cupcakes. Yummy! I will be making again and again for birthdays. Do as follows: use paper liners, make sure eggs and butter are at room temperature before creaming, fill cups halfway if you want to frost them. Delicious with sour cream chocolate frosting!

Easy to use recipe, very forgiving to overbaking -- I baked until it cracked several times and it was still moist. I actually decreased the amount of sugar to a cup then made a quick icing (3 TB of butter, 1.5 cups or so of icing, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, splash of vanilla, milk to thick consistency) to give the bright sugary burst to complement a deep chocolate flavored base.

All in all, this is an incredible recipe as long as you follow it exactly. I started making these cupcakes, and then I went through while they were baking and read the reviews. My cupcakes turned out amazing. I didn't substitute, or change anything. And I wouldn't. I exaggerated absolutely everything (creamed the butter and sugar, using really small amounts at a time when adding the milk and dry mixture) and I baked them for an extra 5 minutes. I filled them 3/4 full still as well. My cupcakes turned out amazing! The sugary crust was incredible, they didn't fall apart at all, They stayed perfectly in tact while i cut holes in them to make a pudding middle. they are perfectly flavored, sweet and chocolatey, but not enough that it is overwhelming (this is before the pudding, i tasted it just in case) .

These cupcakes are super moist, light and very full of chocolate flavor! Try icing with a pink peppermint butter icing for a special taste sensation.

I followed the recipe exactly.  If you make 18 cupcakes they will overflow the liners considerably, which isn't bad if your children like the frosted tops more than the cake bottom!  It does present a problem getting them out of the tins, however.  If I make these again I would spray the tin after I put in the liners OR make smaller cupcakes. These cup cakes do not mound up on top - they are flat, almost concave.  I was a little disappointed when I took them out of the oven, but they looked okay once frosted ( use extra heavy amount of frosting to make them look mounded on top), and they tasted very good.  I don't make cupcakes often, but it was a request from a grandchild, so I did.  I will keep this recipe on file because they WERE tasty, but if I make them again I will know better what to expect. I live at 5200 feet elevation.  I don't know if that makes a difference in the outcome.

These were nice little gems to feast on. Soft and moist, not too sweet, but not as chocolaty as I would have liked them to be. It's a great recipe though and I will make it again but I'll experiment with adding more cocoa powder or maybe even some chocolate chips to the batter. I also only filled my pan halfway and they rose pretty high. I frosted these with Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting (also from this site) It was nice. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy!  I made with wheat flour and used applesauce instead of the butter.  Very dense and chewy!

were by far the prettiest cupcakes ever. however, they could have been a bit sweeter, even when paired with sweet cream cheese frosting.

These are basically a rich, thick fudge brownie in cupcake form. I followed the recipe and cooking timings exactly and they turned out perfect. I was afraid they'd be too dry, especially after I stuck the toothpick in, but once cooled and I bit into one it wasn't the case. I don't recommend this recipe if you're planning on filling them with cream filling, or using very much icing.

They were OK right out of the oven, but that was it.  Once they cooled they were dry, and after being refrigerated for a day (I had to because of the cream cheese frosting) they became like little cupcake-shaped air pockets.  I was hoping for a denser, moister cake, and this was not it.  I followed it exactly as the recipe indicated, not making any adjustments.

A good, simple cupcake recipe! I multipled the servings by 1.5 to theoretically make 24 and ended up with 30 cupcakes after filling the cups about 1/2 full. Next time, however, I'd fill them a bit higher - the few I filled a little more ended up having a taller, nicer shape.  I frosted mine with a small amount of chocolate buttercream frosting - a great addition.  Overall, a great, semi-moist cupcake. I'll never again look at store cupcakes!

A great basic cupcake recipe.  I was looking for a simple chocolate cupcake recipe that was moist and tasty and this is it!  Some reviewers said there is nothing exceptional about this recipe, but I disagree.  This recipe may not be fancy, but sometimes it's great to have a classic recipe, and this is it!

I thought these had a very good taste to them. After reading the reviews I started out with less milk, and wound up adding more as the batter was too thick. To me, cupcake batter is the same consistency as cake batter- fairly runny. I also subbed applesauce for butter (same measurement) - maybe that thickened it up? I made mini cupcakes, and they did muffin-dome up a little, but I don't think that's a bad thing- and I think they will go over well with the kids at the school party!

I made these for my son's first birthday party - all the little babies and moms loved them! I made my own light icing by beating until fluffy some cream cheese, butter and icing sugar, with a drop of blue food coloring.

Yummy! This is a fantastic recipe. I substituted the milk for buttermilk (because I had some in the fridge) but made no other changes. They are so light and fluffy and very easy to make. I frosted them with 'Chocolate frosting 1' and sprinkled them with sprinkles. This is now a permanent recipe in my collection!

This recipe was just "OK". The flavor could be a little better, it was kind of bland, and the cupcakes came out dry even after following the recipe to a T. I had chocolate frosting so that helped, but I think I'll try a different recipe next time. Thanks for sharing though.

I was a little hesitant about trying this recipe due to previous reviews, but I was in charge of taking cupcakes to work. I thought I was helping by adding mini morsels to jazz it up. The cupcakes were so so in my opinion, although I received compliments, I think the people were just not wanting to hurt my feelings. Wish I had just used a box mix. Thank you.

These cupcakes are so good that they do not even need icing. Very moist and chewy. I added chocolate chips to the recipe & they still turned out delicious.

Very easy, I did melt butter and used 4 tbsp, I was short a little bit of cocoa, and they are still good, so can't wait to try with correct amount!!!  Only fill 1/2 full, as they will rise over top if more is used

The batter turned out runny and I had to add extra cocoa, because it is way too sweet, some lemon juice to turn the milk into buttermilk, extra flour because of the runniness, and extra baking powder to make sure it comes up.

This recipe was amazing! The cupcakes were very moist, and very sweet. I used half unsweetened cocoa powder and half hot chocolate mix, because I ran out of unsweetened cocoa powder. The cupcakes did turn out sweet, but I still loved them. Tip: They also work great with buttercream frosting, incase you were looking for frosting ideas.

I had extra French buttercream frosting left over from filling macarons, so I thought I'd make some cupcakes to use it up. But the result is a spongy cupcake that tastes like it's a low-fat, gluten-free abomination. Sure it can be fixed with buttercream frosting, but almost anything can, n'est-ce pas?

All the proportions are suspect: most egregious is the doubling-up of baking powder, which adds to the bitterness, since baking powder contains acid. That might be OK if alkali Dutch-process chocolate was specified, but it isn't.

This recipe is simply not up to the level I've come to expect from this site.

Very dry. They lacked rich chocolate flavor.It helped to top them with moist butter cream frosting but barely.I made them again, this time adding more milk and baking for less time. I got the same result. Now I use a chocolate cake recipe and make it into cupcakes instead.

I made this recipe exactly according to the instructions, and found the batter too runny; the recipe almost certainly needs more flour and less in each cupcake.

As the recipe stands, it's delicious if put in the microwave in a mug for about 2 minutes on high. In the oven, though, it spills outwards and takes longer to cook than it calls for. Honestly, I think this recipe may have been devised at a high altitude, so at nearly sea level, this didn't work correctly at all.

Tl;dr: the flavor of this recipe is amazing, but the consistency is horrible. I suggest adjusting flour and milk levels accordingly.

Absolutely the best chocolate cupcake recipe I have made thus far! I even made it as a cake, filled two 9" round cake tins and they turned out wonderfully. Just had to adjust the cooking time accordingly.

These cupcakes are very tasty, especially with a buttercream frosting. One thing I noticed is that when the cupcakes are baking, if it's more than 1/2 way full, it'll bake right over the top of your holder. I recommend filling it 1/2 or a little less. Very delicious overall.

I just made these cupcakes for my son to bring and share with his kindergarten friends. I love chocolate, these cupcakes taste too much like cocoa powder to me though, not like chocolate. The taste is not balanced at all and too sugary. May be good frosting can save them, but it is too late in the night and my kids are sleeping, I am not in the mood to wake them up while using the mixer to whip up frosting. I am still in search for good chocolate cupcake recipe.To be fair they are moist, I got 26 cupcakes, filled the cups 1/2 full. Followed recipe exactly as written, except melted the butter and used 1tbsp more butter, I will let my superpicky son try one cupcake tomorrow and post an update on how he liked it.

I've made this recipe multiple times now. It's definitely my go-to cupcake recipe. Yes you can cream the sugar and butter - I usually use a mixer for 4 mins. I use 1 cup white sugar and half cup brown (just personal preference).  Aaaand I've been known to add chocolate chips (soooo good). The result is a firm and kinda sticky outside with a soft delicious center. I ice them thick and they're sinfully amazing. I've made them for birthday parties and I never have leftovers.

These were great!! I used this chocolate cupcake recipe and another idea from another cupcakes recipe and made these chocolate cream filled cupcakes! I used a basic whipped cream cheese frosting as a filling. Made these for a friends son's birthday party into sport balls all the kids loved them & the adults!

First time trying the recipe I always make it exactly the way the recipe states.  I partnered it with cream cheese icing and it was a hit with the boys in my home.  The cupcake was light and fluffy, made you feel like you were somewhat watching your calories.

This is an easy and tasty recipe!  I added a tablespoon of brewed coffee to enhance the chocolate flavor, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  I also only filled the muffin cups 1/2 full like other reviews suggested.  I would definitely use this recipe again!

This is the best EVER cupcake recipe!  My cupcakes turned out super smooth and chocolatey. The only change I made was making it with dark chocolate cocoa powder instead of regular and I think it made it much better.

I am so upset right now.  I shouldn't HAVE to read all of the reviews on a highly-rated recipe to find out that the recipe is wrong!  I filled the cups as directed, and they overflowed.  Couldn't hardly get them out of the pan, and then when I tried to trim the excess, they disintegrated.

Great recipe! I needed something quick, easy, and tasty for a last minute get together and this fit the bill! While I thought it was really good as is I do agree with other reviews to cut down the cocoa to just 1/2 a cup instead of 3/4 cup. Thanks for the recipe!

this is a very good recipe. the only thing i did differently was to add 5 tbsp butter to make it easier to cream. this would make around 24-30 regular cupcakes (depending on how much you fill each cup) but i don't think that's a problem. i just poured the rest of the batter into my daughter's mini cake molds. and they all turned out yummy, with or without frosting!

My 10 year old needed to make cupcakes for her American Heritage Girl meeting and we used this recipe. They turned out really moist and tasty. I also used 1/2 cup of butter and I used sour cream instead of the milk. With those changes it is a 5 star recipe I will use over and over.

I followed the recipe exactly, right down to every sift, cream, stir, and beat. The cupcakes were dry and stuck to the wrappers like cement. They also completely overflowed and turned into giant brick-like muffins instead of moist dainty cupcakes.

I tried them again today, only I doubled the butter and added a quarter cup more milk, and I only filled the cups 1/3 or 1/4 of the way. This time they turned out perfect, so the only flaw in the recipe is the butter. I think the author made a mistake recording the butter, because 3 TBs simply isn't enough to provide proper moisture to not only prevent the cupcakes from sticking to the wrapper, but to keep the cupcakes moist.

Unfortunately I didnt try making these cupcakes before bringing them to a Christmas party. Although the flavor is good I believe the ratio of butter to sugar is off enough to make these a bit dry. Thankfully I have a tendance to pipe the frosting! Will not become a go to recipe for me.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I only had dark chocolate unsweetened cocoa, but I think it worked well with it. Otherwise, no changes were necessary. Great consistency for cupcakes and sweet without being too sweet.

This is a perfect and simple recipe. The cupcakes rose properly and were moist and delicious. I didn't have any eggs, and the only substitute I had readily available was 1/4 cup water for each egg, which I replaced with coffee instead (I usually bake chocolate cakes with coffee anyway). The cupcakes turned out beautifully.

These cupcakes were yummy! Very moist and chocolatey. Although I did make a few changes: I put all the dry ingredients and sugar in a bowl and then blended the two eggs, vanilla and butter in a seperate one (It comes out better if you completely melt the butter). Then I alternately added the milk and dry ingredients/sugar to the egg mixture. Also, I only filled up the cupcake liners about 1/2 full and they were still pretty large. I got 18 cupcakes and a small amount of batter left over.

I changed the recipe to 24 servings and ended up getting 36 cupcakes. Cups filled half way to 2/3.  They are very moist and cake like. topped with a Marshmallow& cream cheese chocolate frosting made from scratch. They are delicious and very versatile on toppings.

So this was the first time i baked anything from scratch and I have to say .. these cupcakes are DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly.. and was able to get 18 cupcakes exact. was a bit worried before i started to prepare these as I read some other reviews and saw persons getting batter enough for 30 cupcakes..don't know how that happened. I thought the cupcakes had a lovely vanilla-cocoa flavour! my fam ate them all up!  i covered mine with betty crocker chocolate frosting and it was a great compliment to the flavour of the cupcake! 5 stars for me!!!

Very simple recipe. I added one extra tbsp of softened butter. Baked them for about 25 min. Filled the trays till half the level. All in all, simple and tasty. Thanks for putting up the recipe.

Delicious!!!! I added an extra drop of vanilla extract and a pinch of cinnamon. I read that they were too moist so I didn´t add all the milk but I think they would be even better with the amount in the recipe (1 cup of milk). They are great, not too sweet, so good with cream cheese icing. And I got 16 big cupcakes from one batter

I followed this recipe to the T, and they didn't come out at all! They weren't sweet at all, but I used the milky way frosting & the fluffy peanut butter frosting. The frosting makes this cupcake. It could be better, but at least it tasted like a cupcake.

Followed the recipe exactly and everything turned out great, it tasted really good and the cupcake was moist! The only problem I faced was that the outer part of the cupcake had not completely dried (or cooked?) after taking it out from the oven, but I did not put it back into the oven as I did not want the cupcake to lose its moisture. Regardless, I will definitely make this again! :)

My 20 year old daughter made these and was very disappointed! Too much sugar in the recipe - way to sweet and they came out flat in shape. She followed the recipe exactly. We're at about 300 ft above sea level if this makes any difference.

I had to try 3 times until I made it because I live 2600 meters above sea.  At the end I had to take out the baking soda and baking powder.  They were great still I will make another try with just a little to see how it goes.

This muffins were extremely dry and seemed more like a brownie/dense/muffin crossover. Definitely not light and fluffy, which I expect from cake and cupcakes. Flavor wasn't the best, but is not bad. It's just getting past the texture to truly enjoy it. I'd definitely tweak it.

This is a great basic chocolate cupcake recipe.  I agree with other posters, however, that the directions and serving size is a little off.  As another suggested, I melted the butter and added with the wet ingredients.  Using a hand mixer, I beat everything for two minutes (like the directions for a boxed cake).  I was able to get 24 perfect sized cupcakes from this recipe, instead of 16 as is stated.  But the overall taste is good and this will probably be my go-to chocolate cupcake recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I made for a bridal shower and they turned out very well. I also followed another reviewer's advice and used buttermilk in place of regular milk. These are very moist and delicious.

I followed the recipe and used buttermilk instead of milk and came out with a rich chocolate cupcake my family raved about.

AWESOME Cupcakes!! I dont like chocolate cake or really chocolate in general but these are great. They taste like brownies, crispy crust too. 80% of the things I try to cook come out wrong, so this recipe is pretty idiot proof.
I followed the recipe except I used margarine and melted it first. 
Baked for 15min and they came out soft and moist. 
Tried some with strawberry pie filling in the middle, with cream cheese icing and a strawberry glaze, yummy!

Yum yum yum. This recipe ended up making 24 good sized cupcakes, and after baking for around 18 minutes they were superb! I topped them with Rachel Ray's cupcake frosting recipe, and that was great. Love love love.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used STARMER's tip to separate the sugar and butter and melting the butter. I made about 50 mini cupcakes and they were pretty good. The first batch wasn't that chocolatey or sweet, or not for me anyways so I added more cocoa powder and sugar. The second batch was a little sweeter, but next time I'd like to make it sweeter. I think it is good with frosting though since that makes it sweeter. Overall, it was a good recipe. Btw, this is my first time making chocolate cupcakes from scratch.

This recipe turned out ok, but nothing exceptional. . I put so much effort to make this and it yield 20 instead of 16. It was too moist and people said the consistency is wrong. It was impossible to mix 2 tblsp of butter with all that sugar. I had to add a lot more butter for it to blend together. This recipe is not very precise

This is a great Chocolate Cupcake very dark chocolate. I paired it with PB frosting and I saw the comments about they were a bit dry.  We placed the cupcakes in the micro for 16 sec before serving it makes it taste like a moist molten cake.  I will make these again!

They tasted very good. The texture was super light, I'm guessing because of all the leavening. I had to bake for about 19 min in a convection oven, and the tops were a bit hard, which I covered with buttercream frosting. I think I would like a bit more texture in my cupcakes. It made 17. I was scared to fill the cups too full for fear of overflowing, so I filled them about 1/2 way.

These are delicious! I made them with normal cocoa powder and added another teaspoon of vanilla and the cakes came out the perfect sweetness (for me)
BUT The best part was that I made them with cream cheese icing and sprinkled miniature chocolate chips on top. Everyone at the party said they tasted like heaven in a paper.

They're in the oven...I  made a few changes..I used Buttermilk in place of reg. milk...also I seperated the eggs, added the yolks to the butter/sugar mix and whipped the whites seperate until they were nice and fluffy and folded the whites in to the mix at the end.  I added 2 cups of butter milk.,ill follow up and see how they turned out! They look good so far!

I really liked these! I was looking for a chocolate cake mix that used cocoa powder as that was all I had on hand, and these turned out very nicely. Yeah, it wasn't possible to fully cream the butter and sugar, but it really wasn't an issue. I liked that these did require so little butter, as I topped these with saturated fat laden buttercream frosting anyway (mmmm!). I would definitely make again.

I liked these, but they were just a tad dry. These have more of a darker chocolate taste.  We used milk chocolate icing and I'm glad because it sweetened them up a bit.  We also filled them with "whipped cream filling," another recipe from this site.  Very good combo!

I accidentally left the butter in the microwave while I made this recipe. I mixed all the wet ingredients and all the dry ingredients in two seperate bowls instead of three (I don't have a hand mixer yet!) and just forgot the butter in the microwave. They still turned out wonderfully. A little more like brownies, but awesome with icing.

These are wonderful!  I got 24 cupcakes out of it, though the last one was pretty skimpy.  I made the recipe as posted but with 4 tbs of butter rather than 3.  As other reviewers have noted, creaming the sugar with that little butter is very difficult; I gave up and added the first egg pretty quickly, which helped a lot.  I'll definitely make these again, and might add a bit more extra butter next time.

I followed the others and only added 3/4 cup of milk, if that. It was a hit at my daughters school. Everyone wanted the recipe!

These are the BEST cupcakes I've ever tasted! I followed the recipe exactly except I used buttermilk instead of milk. No need to increase butter. The batter will turn creamy after adding the eggs.  They turned out very moist and super light! Almost like souffle in the middle and a little bit crisp on the outside. I topped them with vanilla frosting but they taste amazing on their own.

I've made this about three times now. The first was for myself, and to share with neighbors. The next two were for a group I belong to. I guess the consensus is around a 4-star rating. I made the recipe exactly as written, except that it took about 19 minutes to bake since I'm at a high elevation. This was the first time I'd ever baked cupcakes from scratch. I'd planned on frosting them, but they came out so moist and chocolaty that I ate/served them as is. They are very good for basic chocolate cupcakes; but others who prefer dryer cupcakes might want to adjust the recipe.

The recipe worked well for me, tasted good.  I used Canola oil instead of butter and mixed the eggs, sugar and oil at the same time in a mixer until they became creamy then added the other ingredients. I agree with the reviewers who said not to fill the cupcake holder or muffin pan to more than half with the batter or it will spill over when baking. I would also add more vanilla and a little cinnamon or even orange peel or ginger for more "punch."  Will definitely make again.

I whipped and folded in the egg whites at the end and I added 3 packets of instant coffee, they are very delicate and make sure you grease your pans REALLY well if you are not useing liners. I made 46 mini cupcakes.

Not sure if I did something wrong or not... But I substituted 1/2 cup oil instead of milk for a lactose-intolerant friend, and the batter turned out extremely thick.  I tried baking 2 of them anyways just to see, and they looked great but were still batter on the inside!

YUM! These cupcakes had a very chocolate-y, rich taste to them. They were crusty on the outside, and soft on the inside. I would definately use this recipe again. Just follow the recipe, and you'll have a guaranteed success in the world of cupcaked making!!!

These were awesome! I used 4 Tbs butter instead of 3, and they came out great. Having never made chocolate cake or cupcakes that didn't come out of a box, I was very surprised at how good the batter was when licking the spoon - reminded me of my childhood when my mother would bake.   We will definitely be making these again, and I will never buy another pre-packaged box of chocolate cake mix again.

These were very chocolaty,  I made 2 changes; cutting the sugar in half, and using egg substitute instead of eggs.  They turned out pretty good.  We decorated them with vanilla sugar icing, that put the sugar back into them! =) Next time, I am going to fill them with peanut butter and make peanut butter cups.

this recipe was quick & easy!  surprisingly moist and very good when you first bite into it.  but I thought it left a bit of a funny taste in my mouth afterwards, which is why i took a star off.  I agree with the other reviewers that the recipe makes way too much - I halved it and made exactly 12 cupcakes (batter filled halfway).  Some other changes - 1) instead of creaming the butter with the sugar, I melted it, and added it to the eggs when cool.  2) couldn't find my baking soda, so I left it out.  3) added walnuts to the bottom of the baking cup before filling with batter.

I can understand why some reviews say this is bland. The cocoa powder doesn't give much flavour so I added semi sweet chocolate chips. I also used self raising flour instead and it turn out moist and soft not dry. But overall I followed the proportion of ingredients stated in the recipe and the results turned out good.

Following advice from other reviews, i halved the recipe (this produced me 13 cupcakes) and added less milk (1/6 less). The result was perfect, although it took a little more time than stated.. about 3 minutes. I just whizzed everything up in the food processor, topped with marshmallow icing. Super easy, super delish :3

They are dry and I also agree with the people who said they fall apart. I think it's because of the small amount of butter. Regardless, cupcakes are really a vehicle for frosting and they certainly accomplish this goal. They're tasty enough and went deliciously with the fluffy peanut butter frosting. Hopefully they sell well at our school bake sale!  Oh yes, I filled each cup slightly less than half full and this was perfect. They rose above the edge of the cup, but not too much. One recipe made 2 dozen.

Good flavor, just a little dry and dense.  I followed the instructions perfectly, so perhaps this is just the way of the cake, or some of my ingredients weren't fresh enough.  Still, wonderful flavor and go great with peanut butter frosting!!!

The cupcakes didn't hold together, and didn't taste that chocolaty.  They were nice and fluffy, but they tasted better as batter than as finished cupcakes.

So easy!  I followed it while making the roasted leg of lamb.  I undercooked it just slightly and added strawberries and chocolate frozen yogurt :P

I followed the directions exactly and they turned out great. I'm going to frost them with store bought choc frosting. I just wish I had more milk in the fridge to wash these down with. LOL.

Good recipe. Cupcakes were better the next day. I may use less milk next time as the cupcakes were falling apart as ppl were eating them.

My 7 y.o. daughter and I made these for a church event.  We thought they were so delicious!  Definitely do NOT fill the cups more than 1/2 full!  We got 24 normal-size cupcakes out of this.  They taste almost brownie-like, so if you want a cake-like mix, this may not be for you. We topped them with the Quick and Almost-Professional Buttercream Icing recipe from this site.  I was also pleased with how low-fat these are.

Amazing- easy and super yummy, I followed the recipe exactly and had rich and moist cakes that held together well with perfect spongy texture.. we even ate them all without any topping. I found trying to fill the cases 1/4 or 1/3 full of batter gave me cake mountains and filling them halfway made perfect for cupcakes to be decorated. This is going to be my new choc cupcake recipe from now on. Thankyou!

These were SO good! kind of fudgier and chocolatier than cupcakes from the mix. Everyone loved them! ... if you use buttermilk (and i recommend you do!) you  might have to bake them for about 5 minutes extra. when i took them out at the recommended time the middles were still liquid.

Wow!  These are great!  Moist, fluffy, and chocolaty.  :)  They taste great frosted or plain.  Amazing.  I used 1 cup of cocoa instead of 3/4 cup - otherwise I stayed true to the recipe.  Will definitely make again and probably make my chocolate cupcake staple.

Fantastic!!! I don't know what people are complaining about with this recipe. I followed the directions exactly as stated and fantastic. I was able to make 18 cup cakes using the large liners and filling 1/2 way. I was really suprised not to get more after reading the other comments I had to really scrape the bowl to get all 18.
I plan on using the recipe for my halloween treats when I get them done I will post a picture.

Thank you so much for the fantastic and really easy recipe.

I tried making these cupcakes for my daughters birthday this weekend, but I couldn't even finish the recipe. The butter/sugar ratio was way off...the butter didn't cream at all after mix for a long time. I was very disappointed. It needs either way less sugar or more butter. And probably less baking powder.

These had good flavor but I had a hard time finding the right cook time. Each batch seemed to take about 10 minutes longer than the time stated in the recipe, some are moist and some are dry. This is probably my fault, because reading through the recipe I really can't find anything wrong with it. I'll make it again and hope my first experience will help me with my second.
Thanks for a nice simple recipe.

The taste was good but I did need to bake them for about 22 minutes to make them firm.  That was the reason for the lower rating.

The cupcakes were great! I can't have dairy, so I substituted soy milk and soy butter. They were, hands down, the best chocolate cupcakes I've ever had. And like everyone else says, don't fill them up 3/4. They'll rise too high. Absolutely wonderful!

They were yummy, but definitly needed to be cooked longer because the middles were still soggy after 17min.  Also, they weren't as fluffy as I had hoped.

I used this recipe on a whim... it was just an after dinner "I feel like making cupcakes" thing and I thought I would change it up a bit, rather than using my tried-and-true. The only change I made was to add some Hershey's chocolate syrup (from the can) to make things a bit more rich and moist. The resulting cupcakes were yet dry and rather bitter. I topped them with extremely rich buttercream frosting to even out the tastes, but the cakes themselves still crumbled from lack of moisture. Everything I bake is always raved about... I'm glad this was just an experiment for private consumption!

Great, simple recipe.  As other bakers here suggested, I filled the cups up to 2/3 instead of 3/4 (made exactly 16 cupcakes) and baked for 19 minutes. I thought it had great flavour; remember, the recipe is only as good as your ingredients; maybe it was the cocoa powder the other bakers used..?

I tried this recipe today, and I thought it was really rather tasty! I made an addition of my own (some Hershey's raspberry flavoured semi-sweet chocolate chips) and they turned out wonderfully. One thing that was a little disappointing was the yield - I got 16 cupcakes, which is a far cry from the 30 suggested in the recipe, but the taste and texture were spot on. It was dead easy to make too, so we will definately be making these again!

These *were* easy, and I was pleased that they used ingredients that I had on hand. But I wasn't terribly impressed with the flavor or texture. Overall, good compromise if you need a quick fix.

This was a wonderful chocolate cupcake recipes.  I increased the amount of butter to 1/2 cup and filled the muffin cup to 1/2 as suggested by other reviewer.  Baked at 17 minutes at 350 degrees.  The cupcake was soOooOo good and moist even after 3 days.  I was very chocolately but not too sweet and made 20 cupcakes in one batch.  I will be keeping this recipe as my go-to chocolate cupcake!

Fantastic even without frosting.  As most of the other reviews said, this recipe makes way more than 12 cupcakes (probably twice that many) and you should only fill the liners about half full if you want them to be flat on top!

It was alright. The cake was a bit lacking in chocolate flavor, and a bit too crumbly for my liking. But not too bad in a pinch.

The tops of the cupcakes were moist, but as soon as you bite into them they were very crumbly and dry. I added vinegar to the milk to sour it. I'm not sure if that was the issue, but I'm told that buttermilk / sour milk makes things more moist. The good thing about them is that they tasted very chocolatey!

This is the first time I've made cake/cupcakes from scratch that ended up sunken in the middle. I filled the cups to 2/3 full based on reviews, but they were still overflowed and sunken. At least the overflow was onto the cupcake pan and not the oven.  Also, it took about 10 minutes longer to get fully baked.  

With that said, the cupcakes tasted good even if they looked horrid. I am not sure if I will try again or not.

Delicious and easy. I used only 1 cup of sugar (who needs 1 1/2 cups of sugar?! Holy cow!) and it was great. I followed the recipe and chose to make 20 cupcakes, although I think it could have easily made 24 cupcakes. Mine were the perfect size. I frosted with a homemade chocolate butter cream frosting.

My cupcakes turned out badly. Even though I did use the mini cupcake pans they overflowed and then sunk ugg! They did taste okay, I just guess they were not good for my altitude (6,000 ft.) I'm going to try and cook them at 300 and see if it helps. I hope so!!!

i kind of turned theses into muffins, pouring a bit more batter, you'know. so i don't know, but they're kind of blan, i can't really taste much. tbh it kind of tastes like raisins.  it's not bad though, idk what i was going to expect if i didn't add frosting or anything.
could just be me or something.

also it says it makes 16 cupcakes, i made over 30.

This recipe is awesome for a quick and easy chocolate fix.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and they turned out wonderfully.  The best part is that once you decide to make these, you don't have to wait long until they're done.

Very good recipe! It is perfect if you are going to be adding icing or frosting because it isn't too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly and came out with 12 regular cupcakes as well as 24 mini cupcakes. I brought the mini cupcakes with mint frosting and shaved chocolate to rehearsals to share and they were gone before lunch!

Loved them! They are more of a devil's food flavor to me which I love and was really complimented by homemade buttercream icing. YOu can easily get 24 cupcakes out of this recipe. The first batch I filled 3/4 up and they overflowed and the tops came off on some. I would fill 2/3 instead and that'll get you at least 24 cupcakes.

I wanted a recipe for chocolate cupcakes to replace the one I had been using. I love the texture of the cupcakes with this recipe, but the flavor was a little too blasé for me. However, it is so much better than the other, that I will use it until  I find one I like better.

Super delicious.   Easy enough for my thirteen year old to make.  We didn't use any frosting, and loved it!

The first time I tried this recipe, it turned out better than my original chocolate cupcake. But I still wasn't satisfied with its texture. It needed to be more moist. So I substituted milk with heavy cream, and the all-purpose flour with cake flour, and it was amazing! Everyone loved it. A friend of mine whom I have given these cupcakes as a gift described it as [a bite of] "heaven"! 

Just a little caution, since I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour, it won't give you a beautiful dome shape. But, according to my taste buds, it will give you a softer cupcake. Also, I baked them for 25 minutes because 15 minutes will give me cupcakes that falls apart when I eat them. 25 minutes gives me cupcakes with a bit crunchy outside, and a moist inside. :)

This chocolate cupcake recipe IS moist and fluffy, if you follow it down to the T (AND if you do not "over-mix"). If you want it sweeter, I would suggest adding chocolate chips in the batter, or even a nice frosting. This is now in my favorite non-vegan choco-cupcake recipes thus far.

I made cupcakes for my daughter's birthday for her class, and the kids love it!. In the past I usually used a different recipe but most of the kids will eat only the frosting. But this time they finished the entire cupcake. I guess I am going to use this recipe from now on.. 
I agreed with most of the reviewers, fill the batter only 1/2 of the cup otherwise it will overflow. 
I did the cupcakes the night before and they were very moist next day.

Made this with a friend for Halloween, and they were perfectly moist and soft... and yeah. These are my favourite chocolate cupcakes I've come across. We received so much praise from friends and co-workers about them. I made a homemade butter cream icing to go on top, and it was divine with it. I'm making them again, that's for sure.

These cupcakes turned out dry.  Had to adjust the baking time because at 15 and 17 minutes the toothpick came out with batter on it (cupcakes were standard size). They did have a nice deep cocoa flavor, but that did not make up for the dryness.  I am surprised by the good reviews. Used another recipe for pumpkin cupcakes on the same day, and they turned out moist and delicious.

I used this for an activity I was going to. Everyone loved them, they were delicious! They stayed very moist even after a couple hours and they we're really tasty! Though, some of the cupcakes did not bake all the way, but that could just be my pan. And the top of the cupcakes hardened a bit also. But overall, they were very good!

These turned out beautifully.  I followed the suggestion to substitute buttermilk for milk and they are moist and have an amazing texture and flavor.  Looking forward to seeing what my coworkers think of these tomorrow.  I'm planning to top them with caramel frosting and pecans for turtle cupcakes.

Absolutely delicious! They do rise quite a bit... I would only fill the cups about 1/2 way (or even a little less!) next time.

Added an extra couple of tbsp of butter as it wouldn't cream with just 3.  They did exactly what the bad reviews said, puffed up and then sank in the middle.  They turned out more like cakey brownies instead of cupcakes and there's no way I would waste time icing them.  Will not make again.

I used this recipe for mini cupcakes in a mini cupcake pan (from Wilton). I set the temperature at 350 f. and baked these for 9-12 minutes, and they were perfect! We gave a ton to our neighbors, because this recipe made a lot of mini-cupcakes. 
If you're going to make chocolate cupcakes, do try this recipe!

It' okay. I too, thought that it was impossible to cream only 3 tablespoons of butter with that much sugar, so I added a little more butter. I also thought that the batter was a little too thick, so I added a little bit more milk. Having done that, I just barely squeezed out 2 dozen cupcakes. They tasted fine to me. They were some quick cupcakes to bring to my son's school the next day for his birthday. Most kids who like chocolate don't care if it's low fat or not, as long as they taste like chocolate, and it does.

this was the best recipe ever.  I made extra large cupcakes about 8 of them, I also used this recipe for regular sized cupcakes about 20 of them. As suggested, I wouldn't fill these more than half way, especially if you plan on frosting them. These taste almost like brownies they are so chocolaty.  I also made these for my in-law for mothers day and some other mothers and everyone loved them.

I was rushing for a last minute dessert, halfed recipe, melted butter, and just dumped everything into a bowl and mixed by hand.  I did use coffee extract and threw in a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips - aside from that, stayed true to recipe.  Baked up beautifully with deep dark chocolate flavor in exactly 16 minutes.  Nice, light, fluffy and yet with an interesting brownie-like chewiness.  Absolutely delicious!  Don't let the other reviews scare you away - these were awesome!

I was looking for a mocha chocolate cupcake recipe and found this. It was really good, however I did use 1/2 cup of butter and added 1 tablespoon of coffee to give it the mocha flavoring I wanted. I made 24 large cupcakes with this recipe, and iced with chocolate fudge buttercream (a recipe I also found on this site). Delicious!

I made these and they were gorgeous!! Except for I usually use Hershey cocoa powder, but only had Toll House. And it does make a difference. In my opinion, the Toll House was meant for brownies, chewy. So, for cake recipes use Hershey cocoa powder. I did not like the cake, but I am going to try again and hopefully it will work out better. My family loved it. I put homemade sprinkles and yellow-lemon icing on. Will defenitley try again.

I halved this recipe and just threw all the ingriedents into the bowl and mixed them up.  These were some of the most moist "from scratch" cupcakes ever.  Not sure why all the negative reviews, but I thought these were great!  They rose nicely and they tasted fantastic!!!! Will be making these again!

It was very soft and good tasting and raised to double its dough size. I followed the recipe, but increased the butter (as another review suggested) to 1/2 cup. The original recipe gave 16 muffin-like cupcakes, which I loved!

I made these with melted chocolate instead of cocoa and added it to the wet ingredients. I also used buttercream as well. They came out REALLY tasty, but the instructions aren't the best. I added my egg in with the sugar and butter, because like I read in another review, there was just no way I could cream it together. When I added everything together it was the best looking cake mix I've saw! - it was really light and fluffy. Mine didn't poof up like muffins, but it might have been because of the substitutes I used.

Great chocolate muffin. My advice is to use cooking oil instead of butter, makes a moist and fluffy consistency. Before baking, drop several pieces of chopped chocolate on top, slightly press into the mixture for a fudgy effect after baking. I had to increase baking time to 25 minutes for a perfect choc-muffin.

I can honestly say that these were the best cupcakes I have ever had in my entire life. not only were they incredibly easy to make, but they also had an amazing texture and tasted like hot chocolate. I am certainly using this recipe again!

When I cooked these, they puffed up way to high and then I took them out and they sunk completely.

Yummy and moist. I read a lot of the reviews and watched the video before I made these tonight. I halved the recipe and it made 10 cupcakes. The butter quantity is correct, watch the video it does not turn creamy it is still sugary and once the egg is added everything combines perfectly. I also added a little less cocoa as other reviewers suggested (also didn't have enough). This is a lovely recipe. The texture is very moist, love them. They really don't need icing. Thank you, will make again.

I think these cupcakes turned out great. They smell wonderful and the texture is unbelievably smooth. I halved the recipe and followed the reviews that said to add less milk. I found that I needed a bit more milk for a smoother consistency so I added it about 4 tbsp at a time until I was happy with it. They definietly do puff quite a bit in the oven but I think that's fine; the texture is beautiful and moist!

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I doubled the ingredients and followed the recipe exactly.  Makes a perfect chocolate cupcake. They look and taste great.  Topped them off with a cream cheese frosting.

These are okay.  Nothing amazing.  Thought they could be a little sweeter but that's my personal preference!  I'm sure I can make up for that in a sweet frosting.

The cake is very moist and tastes good, but I think it needs more chocolate. Next time I'm going to put some chocolate chips in and put in a little more cocoa powder. But it turned out really great, and when I added buttercream frosting and some sprinkles-mmmmm so good.

I have made these cupcakes on two occasions (one week apart to note the weather/humidity hadn't changed) and I found it to be very frustrating.  

The first time I cut the recipe in half and they came out almost perfect.  The flavor was spot, but even my fast cooking oven took the full 17 minutes and the cupcakes were oohey gooey...too oohey gooey.  Also, cutting the recipe in half should have made 8 cupcakes, but it made 10 with a little batter left over.

The second time I tried to make these I followed the directions exactly as shown and these were a nightmare!  It made 20 cupcakes, 6 of them caved in on themselves, 4 of them rose over the liners, 6 of them cracked and I had 4 pretty good ones.  I baked them for 18 minutes, rotating the pan half way through and all of them came out too gooey, even the cracked ones.  Thankfully icing was able to cover that, but sunken cupcakes?  That's embarrassing.  

I'm willing to accept that some of this can come from over beating, but I think the measurements are a little off.  I might try it again, but play around with the measurements because the flavor was there.  It just needs some tweaking.

if there was a way to make this review private i'd use it. 

used 1 cup of whole wheat flour instead of  white, carob instead of chocolate, and 1/4c half and half with water instead of milk. 

was way too sweet and had a greasy texture.

These were pretty dry....I'm pretty new at baking so maybe it was my fault but I've definitely had box cake mix cupcakes that were more moist than this....wouldn't make them again. they aren't bad though, just not that good either.

These were fine without any frosting, but there were a few complications. Somehow, I managed to mistake 3tsb for 1/2 cup of butter! In my opinion it's impossible to cream that much butter with the sugar, but the cupcakes came out great still. I only made about 13 cupcakes though, and the batter was pretty thick.

At first I found the cake too soft and thought it felt apart to easily. But when they had sort of settled and cooled for a few hours they were a perfect consistency. I recommend them with creamcheese coconut frosting. Also, the 3 tbs of butter may seem like too little but I suppose it's what gives them their lightness.

Not bad but they came out a bit too dry. More muffin touch than cupcake airy. We needed lots of milk to get these down. 3 stars cause they were tasty and the recipe is worth tweaking. Points for the low fat.

While the recipe is simple and the cupcake baked up perfectly, it was extremely dry and bland.  I don't know why.  The only thing I changed was substituting buttermilk for the milk.  I don't know......

Easy to make, and look fantastic. The only flaw is this recipe states that it makes 16 cupcakes, while really there is enough to make a solid two dozen full-sized cupcakes.

The only changes I made to the recipe was to reduce the sugar by half and I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 buttermilk.  I decorated them with Vanilla Buttercream Icing, a few chocolate sprinkles and pumpkin gumdrops and took them to a Pumpkin Carving party!  Everyone loved them!

The cake has a good texture, a bit heavier than expected. Use the best quality cocoa. I used hershey's and I don't like how overpowering the taste has become. I would suggest a different type of chocolate. On a few of the cupcakes, I pulled the pan out half way through and put some chocolate chips on top, then put it back in the oven.

Sis and I made some on the same day and her little kiddos wolfed them down. Thanks Ladan!

This recipe was not what i thought it would be like, I follwed the recipe to a T and I had to bake them for 10 extra minutes and the still dropped and I don't have a old over either, but you couldnt tell after they were iced and in the end they did taste good.

I am a young baker that has just began to bake and I made these for my school-mates. I must say this is a great cupcake! I can say that It could use a little more chocolate flavor. It is very moist and it did overflow so be cautious. Great for beginners!!

I lowered the servings to 10 and that was enough for 1 dozen, which was plenty. The cream was okay, I didn't think it was anything special, I was expecting something different, since everyone raved about it. I did add rum instead of vanilla extract, and that gave it a subtle extra flavor.

This was an easy and quick recipe.  I made these for my son's class for his bday.  They were a hit!  Even with having to substitute some ingredients.

I was going to purchase some cupcakes, but was haunted by that notion so I got up at 11pm and made them.  I had all ingredients except chocolate so I substituted it with Nestle Rich Chocolate Hot Cocoa Mix.  I even had just enough baking cups :-).  The kids loved the smell and the taste of the cupcakes (Hot Cocoa Cupcakes) and the icing (sharon's buttercream icing).

These were so wonderful! I am not a cook, but these were easy and wonderful. I topped them with marshmallows which added some extra goodness. But I think they would be wonderful without marshmallows. Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed the recipe and just substituted buttermilk for the milk, and added 2 teaspoons of brewed coffee.  And just made it an even 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Mine needed to bake 18-20 minutes.

The 3 Tbl softened butter and sugar do get a moist and fluffy sandy texture instead of creamy.  But, once you add the eggs it is fine.  I got 18 cupcakes out of this batter and it was like a mousse/pudding consistancy and yummy.  I do like that this is a low fat treat and I didn't need to load up on butter or oil.  I made a vanilla cream cheese frosting and they taste very good.  The do taste good without icing.  They were moist and fluffy.  Will be making again!

Recipe calls for too much baking powder. Even 1/2 full, they overflowed and did not bake right. Going to look for a better recipe...so disappointed!

these cupcakes are a little bland. i followed everything exactly except i put a hershey's kiss in the middle of the batter before baking and only made 12. would probably be VERY good with the right icing as im eating them without any icing. as for making them, they were easy to mix and bake but the only downfall was that they expanded a lot and there was way to much batter. mabee use the 12 muffin recipe for 16 and only fill the cups about 1/2 or possibly 2/3. overall i'll use the recipe again for a quick snack. thanks !

Soft. Moist. I agree with another reviewer who said there wasn't enough butter to cream with the sugar. Better to melt the butter. I halved the recipe and still could make 14 cupcakes.

Perfectly fine cupcakes. I love that there is so little butter (though I used canola anyway) The recipe definitely makes more than 16. Next time I will attempt a cream filling.

These were more like brownies, but that's fine because I like brownies. I'm not exactly sure why, but they came out very puffy, but then they deflated and had big holes in them. I didn't have any frosting, so I filled them with peanut butter, and it was quite good.

I made these for my friends at work. They loved it! I topped it with the cream cheese from the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe. Great combination.  I had also added about a 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips into the batter.  I tried a lot of recipes, this was the best!

15-17 minutes was not enough time. They came liquidy and too soft. I had to leave them in the oven for twice that for them to be fully cooked. They barely came out of the paper liners, as well. They were still pretty moist on the inside.

Cupcakes came out more "brownie" like. My fault, maybe so I will try again?. Did notice that most photos showed the cupcake dense or brownie like. But there was a few that did look very good, that is more like a cupcake texture. Darn I'll experiment more.

Based on the reviews, I made these cupcakes with less milk (3/4 cup vs. 1 cup) and my cupcakes turned out very dense and heavy, like little a baseballs.  If I try this recipe again, I will follow as directed.

I made these tonight in preparation for my kids' Hallowe'en parties at school.  I haven't iced them yet, but they are very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly, but did cut back on the milk a little as another review said.  I ended up getting 21 cupcakes and not 16 as the recipe states, filling just over half full.  That's okay though, the more the better.

The cupcakes tasted good, but I filled my cups 3/4 full and the part that came over the top stuck to the pan, I was hoping for the rounded top and these flattened out...had trouble getting them out.  I was hoping for a moister cupcake, but like I said the flavor was good

Made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and ended up with enough batter for 30. I measured a full ice cream scoop per cupcake and they came out PERFECTLY! I added a tablespoon of Kahlua to the measuring cup, and then continued to fill the cup with milk. The Kahlua gave the chocolate a little depth, and they were moist and wonderful! A cream cheese frosting (from The Joy of Cooking cookbook) on top made it even better! I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is not really a cupcake recipe...it is more like a brownie. They taste really good, but shouldn't be labeled as "cake" maybe a brownie cake

I love how it is soft and not overly rich, yet chocolatey at the same time.

Easy from scratch recipe. I used whole wheat flour and Splenda for a more "nutritional" version. They still turned out well. Not too sweet, but definitely chocolatey!

LOVE this recipe!  Super yummy and easy!  I followed the advice of many before me and used more butter, I kept the sugar the same, and tried to only fill the cups 1/2 full.  The cupcakes turned out great, the flavor is amazing (GREAT chocolate flavor!), and I can't wait to pass them out and excite everyone's taste buds!

These cupcakes were fantastic! I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and added 1/4 tsp of orange extract and the result was a perfect balance between moist and crumbly, and the orange complemented the chocolate so well. I will definitely make this my standard chocolate cupcake recipe.

We've made this a couple times.  The first time we made the cupcakes using the exact recipe.  They turned out splendidly.  We used silicone baking cups and a small glass cake pan to make cupcakes & a small cake.  The cupcake had a bit of difficulty coming out of the baking cup, but we believe that was because we didn't let them cool long enough before removing them.    The second time we cut the sugar to 1 cup and changed it to 3/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  We used 1/4 cup tofu in place of one egg.  We added a bit more cocoa because there was cocoa in our tofu (we tried to make tofu pudding and couldn't get small enough chunks, so we used it in this recipe!)  The next time we make this, we are going to try to replace both eggs with tofu and maybe cut the sugar a bit more (3/4 cup?).    Overall this is a delightful recipe.  It doesn't need frosting-it is very sweet by itself.

Great cupcake! It comes out light, airy and chocolaty. I've made this several times and it's my new go-to cupcake recipe. Good thing it's lowfat because I pile on a mound of white chocolate buttercream.

I just made this recipe and I agree that its really good.  At someone else's suggestion, I used 1/2 cup butter. They were delicious. I also increased baking soda from 1/4 to 1/2 t. by accident and they were very fluffy. I believe in using the best ingredients so I used cage free eggs and NOW brand organic cocoa powder available at heath food stores.  I filled the cups 3/4 and got 19 cupcakes, I suppose because I increased the butter. I plan to make make 1/2 with plain cream cheese frosting and 1/2 with chocolate cream cheese frosting.

Good cake recipe, and listen to people who say only fill the cups 1/2 full.  These things explode out of their cups when they bake!

I agree, they are way to moist and filling the cup anymore than 1/2 full will result in a very ugly cupcake. I think if I use this recipe again I will add more butter and less milk. I may also add a little instant coffee to make them taste more chocolatey. They did however satisfy my craving for a cupcake and weren't awful. Mine just weren't pretty.

Pretty tasty. Dissolving the cocoa powder really brings out the rich flavor without it being overpowering. Simple, fun recipe.

I made these cupcakes for a friend's birthday. They turned out really well. My friends really enjoyed them! I followed the advice from other reviews and filled the cups (two inches) about halfway instead - which came out perfectly. Amongst the people I shared them with, the general consensus that they're better with frosting. Also used the original measurements, which made 24 cupcakes.

These were great!  I was skeptical about making them after reading all the reviews, but I don't understand why people had such problems!  They turned out great for me, which really made my day, considering I scoured the internet for a chocolate cupcake recipe and really hemmed and hawed about making this one.  Don't worry about the bad reviews, follow the directions and they'll be great!  I did alter the recipe by changing the servings, but they are fab!  :)  Can't wait to get them all frosted for my girlfriend's baby shower tomorrow!  Thank you for the recipe!

Yummm!  Very tasty and they came out with a nice texture.  I didn't have eggs so I substituted 2 Tblsp of ground flax seed mixed with 6 Tblsp of water.  Made them healthier too!  I also decreased the sugar to just 1 cup and used 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt and 1/2 cup skim milk.  I followed another reviewers suggestion of just melting the butter and adding it to the wet ingredients.  This worked well.  The kids enjoyed them and I'm sure I'll make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cupcakes came out beautifully!  The taste wasn't anything special but it was good and kind of addicting.  I topped it with cream cheese frosting. They taste great plain too. Looked picture perfect, I will definitely be making again!

These are very moist and get great reviews when I bring them in to work. They hardly need icing! I agree that filling the tins 1/2 full is ideal.

I think the real lesson here is to remember that, unlike cooking, baking is an exact science and recipes should be taken from professional websites instead of ones where any random person can post a recipe that gives everyone gets such extremely varied results.  My results were not awesome.  Something's missing in this recipe...I'm not sure what.

Delicious tasting cupcake. However, I made this recipe twice and both times they fell in the center and were extremely difficult to frost because they fell apart. I definitely recommend filling the cups only half way as other reviewers suggested. When filled half way, they still dropped, but are delicious anyways. I also recommend not frosting these.

Awesome recipe! I improvised based on what I had on hand. I traded the cocoa powder for a mix of unsweetened and regular melted chocolate and adjusted the sugar to 3/4 cup to accommodate. Used margarine instead of butter and only 3/4 cup of milk based on another review. These turned out fabulous and I had a difficult time keeping my fingers out of the batter! Made 12 overflowing cupcakes (I only had a 12 muffin tin)and topped them off with a chocolate mousse frosting; although they would have been just fine on their own.

This is a great quick recipe, requiring ingredients most people have on hand. I do agree with an earlier post that the directions are a bit misleading. The ratio of sugar to fat is off for "creaming."  The cupcakes still turned out okay.

These were ok if you don't have a cake mix on hand.  But nothing special.  I will keep looking for a different cupcake recipe.

I make cupcakes at least once a week and I did not like this recipe. It did not turn out. Spilled out all over pan. Will not make again. I gave it 2 stars because the pieces I picked out of pan tasted ok.

I bought a wilton giant cupcake pan so I had to change the amount of servings and I had to bake it at 325 degrees instead of 40.  I changed it to 40 servings because it was a even 5 eggs being used and I can measure the other ingredients fine.  The extra was just used to make little cupcakes and I baked those in the correct 350 degree temperature.  The cupcakes came out great and delicious.  It was very easy to prepare.

I made these and we all enjoyed them.  I accidentally added 1 egg too many but they turned out fine.  I added chocolate chips and gravity got the best of them and they are all at the bottom, but gave it a nice fudgy finish!  I will use this recipe for my go-to chocolate cupcake recipe.  Oh yeah, I used applesauce to sub for the butter.

These were awesome!  Very moist, I'm not sure how anyone had something bad to say about them.  The only changes I made were less sugar because I added some hersheys chocolate syrup to the mix, and I subbed a cup of almond milk in place of the regular milk and vanilla extract.  I also used hot cocoa mix with marshmallows instead of cocoa powder for a little extra something.  I had to cook them a little longer than the recipe suggested but other than that the recipe worked out for me, the serving size was accurate.

On the recommendation of other reviews I only added about half the milk the recipe called for, and the batter was still pretty runny. The cupcakes were really flat on top because of that, but they tasted fine. I think this recipe really only needs about 1/3 cup of milk. Frosted with cream cheese icing they were yummy!

I've been looking for a yummy chocolate cupcake and this is it! The ones I've tried all turned out too spongy, but this one is just right.
I did everything the same except I used Half&Half instead of milk, and instead of 1/4 tsp soda and 2 tsp powder, I did 3/4 tsp soda and 1 1/2 tsp powder to make it chewier. I don't know much about baking, so I'm not sure if it changed how it would have turned out, but they were just how I wanted them!
I don't like things to be very sweet, and this wasn't. They balanced with the very sweet chocolate butter cream frosting I used.

I just made these over the weekend and they were so easy to make.  They were yummy and moist.  I took the advice of others and used less sugar.  I used a little more than a cup of sugar.  I filled the batter only 3/4 full and it was just right.  I was surprised that my leftover batter from my first batch that I left in the fridge for a few hours still worked and turned out great.  Definitely would use this recipe again.

I've never made cake from scratch before.  This recipe was easy to follow and tastes really good.  The only thing I changed was I put 1 tsp of vanilla in instead of 3/4, but that's because that's all I had left in there..ha ha.  I'll never buy box cake again.

Quick and easy! They turned out great and are even delicious without icing. It yielding 12 large cupcakes with a bit leftover so it's good to know I can pare it down if I need to make smaller ones. 
This will now be my standard recipe!

i made this recipe at 1am because i had a sudden urge to bake chocolate cupcakes. now i used a couple of substitutes like i used half and half instead of milk and i used this hot chocolate mix that has cayane pepper in it since i didnt have any coacoa and i felt like experimenting and the cupcakes came out wonderful. they werent to sweet and they made me 24 cupcakes. the baking time was about five minutes konger than said but other than that this is a wonderul recipe and i would definately make it again

These were delicious!!! I just couldn't stop eating them. I halved the recipe and made mine in a oversized muffin tin and the recipe made just enough to fill the tin, 6 giant cupcakes! however I should have left them in a few mins longer the middles were still a bit goey, but when they cooled that just tasted like a fudgy centre...mmmmmmmmm!

This is my favorite chocolate cupcake recipe, i have used it like 4 times, at first the i filles the cupcake cups with too much batter and it raised high, but now i got the hang of it and they are perfect and delicious and everyone eats them all in a day.

These cupcakes turned out extremely well.  Next time I'll fill the cups to 2/3 rather than 3/4.  They're good enough to have wuthout frosting!  Nice chocolate taste, not too heavy, pleasant texture.

I am a novice baker but had to make cupcakes for my daughter's sale at school.  These turned out great.  The recipe was easy to follow.  The cupcakes were very chocolatey but not too sweet.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and only filled about 2/3 and the final sizes were perfect.  I will definitely make them again.

The batter might seem runny - but follow the directions!  These are so light and fluffy, my new fave!  PS - I used 1/2 cup of 5% cream and 1/2 cup 1% milk... just for a little creamier taste.

I needed a recipe that can be a base for my black forest cupcakes. I just increased the flour by a fourth of a cup, added 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar (to make it moist) with the milk, half cup of cherry preserves and 1/4 cup of brandy (or cherry liquor if you have it at hand). I frosted it with dark fudge and crushed cherries. Quite good too. =)

I baked these cupcakes last week and they came out great.  They tasted great, held together properly and rose nicely.  I iced them, but they would have been great with or without icing.  For me the recipe made about 28 cupcakes!

This was delicious!!  I am vegan, so I used egg replacer instead of eggs, and margarine instead of butter, and they were delicious!!  A bit hit, everyone who tasted them fell in love with them!  I filled the tins under half way and made 21 moderate to small sized cupcakes.. but they are so rich it's good to have a small serving!!  15 mins at 325 was perfect for me.

Pretty good cupcakes, although I used a little less cocoa powder.  Otherwise I got an overwhelming taste of cocoa powder and not enough of the cupcake.

The cupcakes crumbled when I tried to take them out of the pan.   The crumbs tasted good, although they didn't hold together....I wouldn't use this recipe again.

I decided to make these cupcakes after a late night snack attack but wasn't too impressed with the results. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a few chocolate chips to them & having to bake them a bit longer than stated & they came out a little on the dry & crumbly side. I frosted them with "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" from this site & they tasted alright as a snack, but I wouldn't give them to anyone or use it for entertaining.

I just tried these and was pretty disappointed. I'll end up throwing most of them away. They have the texture of cornbread and don't have a great taste. I'd definitely recommend going with either a cake, a brownie, or a better receipe if you're looking for a good chocolate dessert. I won't try this one again.

I followed the recipe to the T.  I thought the cupcakes turned out on the dry side but everyone that tried them said they were great.  I'm definately going to try this again to see if my dry outcome was a fluke.  I found this recipe so easy to do.

These were fantastic cupcakes! They were nice and light and yet they didn't have a wimpy flavor. The only thing I changed was using 1/2 Splenda, 1/2 sugar and reducing the amount of cupcakes. I had a hard enough time getting 24 out of my batch, I don't know how Iadan expects us to get 30.

Very yummy cupcakes!  I used a bit less milk (6-7oz?), made 12 x 3/4 full muffin tins, and they baked in 25 minutes.  Moist and a bit chewy, not too sweet.  Perfect even without icing.  I'll be making these again.

These are ok.  I probably won't make them again, though.  They were moist on day one, but very dry the next day.  They weren't bad, just not the best chocolate cupcakes.  Also mine took longer than 17 minutes, more like 20 for half-full cups.  One more thing, the reviewer before me who said they skipped the butter-melting step was pretty smart, since there is NO melt-the-butter step.  Heelllooo??!!

awesome cupcakes make sure you do not over cook and i also took the other reviewers suggestion and  skipped the melting butter step and added the cocoa to the dry ingredients.  i aso doubled the recipe and made only 24 cupcakes will for sure make again and again

I loved the chocolate flavour of these low-fat cupcakes.  I iced them with chocolate frosting and they were gone in a flash!  I would have given these 5 stars, but I had to cook them quite a bit longer before they were done, also make sure you fill the muffin cups closer to 2/3 full, as this particular batter likes to rise a lot!

This chocolate cupcake is so easy to make. I added light cool whipped topping and ground almonds for garnishing. My friends love it. :)

They came out very sticky and didn't taste good at all. Luckily, I only made them to practice cake decorating, so that worked out. I wouldn't use this recipe again.

We love this recipe. I make this with my 4 year old and it is simple enough that she can help. We add one of the buttercream recipes from this site and she thinks she is a rockstar. Her friends and our neighbour keeps asking ‘her’ to make them again! We follow pretty much exactly and they are moist and nice and chocolatey. We recommend!

Incredible cupcakes! They don’t take too long to bake but they turn out delicious. The only thing I did differently was add the sugar to the dry ingredients instead, like a comment below me mentioned.

I also upped the butter to 1/2 cup, which gave a nice upper crust and tender inside.  Very chocolatey and yummy.  With ice cream, did not need frosting.  Judged a hit by everyone!

This recipe is great! Super easy. Made mini cupcakes + one big cake, both turned out just fine. Decorated them with frosting and candy corn, in true Thanksgiving spirit! I will definitely make them anytime I need a good cupcake recipe.

I followed directions to the letter and it was a mess! First off DO NOT fill 3/4 full because they will go over the tin and stick to the tin. They were also so soft that they fell apart trying to take them out of the tin.

Found the recipe really good. I'm a novice baker, just recently started baking and everything worked out perfectly. I used margarine instead of butter and added in a little more than what the recipe asked for. Got the perfect cupcakes. I halved the recipe and was able to get 24 small cupcakes.

Reduced milk to 1/2 cup rather than 1 cup. Indeed, it was a thicker batter, but that was quickly taken care of with the addition of 1 can of cherry pie filling, which is a heap of wet ingredients in itself. Best chocolate cherry cupcakes I've baked that haven't wept when pulled from the oven!

Vanilla clashes with cherry, so I used almond extract instead, which amplifies that cherry trademark taste.

I found these actually a bit on the dry side, and a bit crumbly. I've made other recipes before, I would not each for this one again.

Great recipe... and of course I made a few changes. (We usually do.) Since I have a wheat allergy, I made the following changes:
1) I used "Pamela's Gluten-Free +Vegan Artisan Blend +Whole Grain 1 to 1 Wheat Flour Replacement Flour" (That's a mouthful but worth it.) Likewise, I used gluten-free baking powder.
2) I also upped the butter to 5T and added a whole banana for moisture to cream with the sugar (which I put only a cup and maybe a pinch.. the amount of sugar that this called for was insane.) We like the banana and chocolate combo- otherwise, I would have gone with 6T of butter for sure.
3) I also added chocolate chips and a good old squirt of Hershey's syrup for luck.
I was able to get 22 out of the mixture. They baked to perfection in about 16 minutes @ 350 /convection. Once cooled they were topped off with a dark chocolate drizzle. When cooking recipes, you have to be creative and adjust for your own needs.

Wish I'd taken time to read reviews.  Butter and sugar amounts to not "cream" and need to be adjusted.  Paper liners for regular sized muffin cups should only be filled 1/2 full at the most...I ended up with mushroomcakes.  Could have had over 18 cupcakes.  Flavor chocolatey!

I made these for my daughter’s class at school for her birthday and they were a huge hit! It made 25 cupcakes with this batch and I only filled them a little over half full to make sure there was room for the frosting. Thanks for this recipe! We will make these again!

They turned out soft and moist.  Good over all. Used a medium size-,  12 cup- tin and ended up with quite a bit of leftover batter.

Not a huge fan of chocolate cupcakes, but I decided to give a try. I have to say, I’m pretty impressed! I halved the recipe and put all the batter in 8 cupcake holders. This was a mistake, as they overflowed and spilled out onto the baking tray. Other then that, they are good, easy cupcakes and I would recommend trying them out.

I made these delicious cupcakes and followed the recipe to the T.  They sew exceptional. The rose just like I wanted them to and I finished them off with white buttercream frosting.  They were a hit with my family and the party I took them to. I simply doubled the recipe and was just a few short of 4 dozen. Tku for a wonderful, easy chocolate cupcake recipe

I had followed the recipe and did not make any changes.  I have to say, it was not my favorite. The texture came out to be a cross between a brownie and a cupcake, which sounds good but it wasn't.  The flavor was nice though.

This recipe makes super chocolatey cupcakes, which I loved! I am glad I read the reviews because I knew to whip the cream separately from the cream cheese. The cupcakes came out perfectly - light, not dense and chocolatey without being overly sweet. This may be my go to recipe for chocolate cupcakes but I would be interested to see if anyone used the recipes to make a cake and what the results were!

These cupcakes are so good! I was very wary about making it because I have had past problems with other chocolate cupcake recipes and they would turn out very bitter and weird. This recipe didn't. I followed the recipe exactly, and then I used cream cheese frosting and a raspberry on top of each. I will definitely make these again.

I didn't make any changes and it was dry as heck. It made you thirsty as a camel in the desert. I think the recipe should have canola oil instead of butter.

I made these cupcakes taste is good but Cup cakes sink in the middle during  baking inside the oven. I tried to remove this problem with considering the points may effect the  process  for example, I kept the succession of mixing materials,  I did not beat it too much, I did not open the oven during baking, ...but the results were same:(

I followed the recipe and these came out with the crumb of Muffins not Cupcakes. If you want a very generic chocolate muffin this is the recipe for you.

This was a horrible recipe. Baked for the minimum amount of time and the cupcakes came out so incredibly dry. I suggest adding more butter, or really watching your oven when it gets to be between 10/15 minutes. horrible.

I used a whole stick of butter, because you can’t cream 3tbsp of butter and that much sugar. Also only fill the pan 1/2 of the way. But I definitely love them. Not too sweet.

I need advice.  I followed the recipe to the T.  The taste came out amazing but they fell in the middle and either stuck to the paper or even when I sprayed and floured another round they stick too.  What is wrong?

The cupcakes were too moist and were practically falling apart which was horrible. They also puffed up too big which made them hard to get out of the container and hard to frost. They were tasty but the recipe wasn’t very good

I dont like this recipe. I followed the instructions exactly. The butter and sugar were impossible to cream until fluffy. I personally thought there was too much sugar and they were dry.

I really enjoyed this recipe and it was tasty. :) I didn’t have any regular white sugar so I used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar instead. I think it worked out good. I did try to make mini cupcakes with the brown sugar batter and once their baked they don’t come out of the pan easily even though I sprayed the pan beforehand. Other than that, I think that this recipe works well and would definitely use this again.

Just made these using Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 Gluten Free Flour Blend!  We made MINI CUPCAKES so had to reduce the baking time, and 12 minutes was perfect! The batter seemed rather thick (compared to other cake mixes I've made, or store boxed cake mixes) but I held off adding more liquid. Glad I did, because the texture and flavour tuned out great.  They were moist, not too crumbly (great for Gluten Free!) and will definitely make these again!

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had to double the butter in order to cream it with the sugar.  The cupcakes were absolutely delicious, soft, and moist.

This recipe is not good. The baking powder was way off. They stuck to the pan and collapsed into themselves. WARNING!
do not try this recipe without first changing the ratios.

This was an amazing cupcake! I had to add around 1/2 cup of butter though and decreased the sugar and milk a little. These are so moist, and the recipe made 30 cupcakes easily. I did what others did and only filled the cupcake wrappers 1/2 way. They only needed a little icing. (I used orange buttercream, and they are amazing!)

The batter is awesome and it made more than 12 cupcakes. I added an extra tablespoon of melted butter because the butter and sugar would not blend. It worked well. I pored in half the dry ingredients and all the milk then the rest pf the dry ingredients. They did not rise as much as I wanted to though.

I have made these cupcakes a couple time and the first time i was impressed and my family loved them but the other couple times i made them they were very crumbly. When they were very crumbly I made them into cake pops. The cake pops were very good and i strongly suggest them!

I have made this recipe twice.  It was a good sale with my family.  It is very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and would not change anything.  I will make it again.  It made 24 cupcakes.  Just fill the cups half full or they will run over and make a mess.

Just made these.  followed everything except i also usrd 1/2 cup butter instead of 3 tablespoons. They are moist and taste good! They just stick a bit too much to the muffin liner. I was able to make 20 with the batch

Absolutely loved the recipe. You're a genius, may God bless you always. My last try was a disaster so tried your recipe this time, they came out all puffed up and soft . Thank you so much.

They taste Amazing. Listened to other reviews and increased the cooking time and only filled the cups 1/2 ways. Not sure what another commenter meant but this are very chocolatey.

The finished product made 20 cupcakes instead of 24 like I would have preferred and tasted quite bad. I don’t quite know how to explain it but the flavor wasn’t like chocolate at all.

I doubled the recipe and used margarine instead of butter. It made 47 cup cakes.  I followed other reviewers and filled the cupcake pan 1/2 full and baked at 350 for 15 -17 mins.

I made these following the directions exactly (with one small exception of filling the cup up all the way because I was too lazy to get a second pan dirty). The flavor was great. Not sure if I over mixed or something but they were quite dense and more brownie like then cake like. Could be I cooked them too long? They definitely needed more time then listed but, as I said, I did fill them right up. Very yummy, not sure what to do to make them fluffier, I will have to google that next time. I will definitely be using those recipe again, thank you for an easy to follow, tasty recipe.

I don't know what happened, but they expanded up and out of my pan, and then sank. They were gooey half filled cupcake liners with the other half melted all over my pans and oven.

Very intense dark chocolate taste.  They puffed up just right.  I used an ice cream scooper to fill my cupcake liners, so about 2/3 up.  Good, but not my favorite.

You cannot cream that amount of butter with the amount of sugar required. The cupcakes rise way too high and then fall flat.

This recipe is so simple. I like the fact the you use less butter, and put in milk with this recipe. But I don't not recommend storing these for longer time,  finish eating them up in a couple of days. I think because you put milk they won't last longer. 

I have seen on the upper tray the cupcakes were done, but the ones on the lower tray in the middle it was still wet. I would fill up only 1/2 and bake 17 min at 325.

Cupcakes were rich like a brownie. I would use less sugar when I make these again. I don’t like dry cupcakes that have a bland cocoa taste.....this recipe was the complete opposite!

This was a really easy and simple recipe and the out come was great but if you are  perfectionist like me or want a more traditional cupcake look (more dome-like top) then i suggest you fill the liners up 1/2 way or 2/3 the way up and bake them at 325F for a bit longer. I made one batch at the recommended 3/4 the way up at 350 and instead of rising they flattened out and spread like cookies and the outside seemed to be cooking a lot faster than the insides. I fixed the amount in the liner and the temperature and they looked a lot better.

The bake time of  15-17 min was not enough. I took the cupcakes out and they were still jiggly and liquid in the center. I put them in for five more min and they turned out fine. Soft and chocolatey, all around a decent cupcake I was proud of. Be aware that you can't really cream the butter and sugar together, as there isn't enough but to actually make it creamy. But when it looks like the sugar is soft and yellow and you can't see any butter chunks, move on and add the eggs. I may fill my tins a little less next time.

Amazing recipe. I used it twice and it keeps impressing me again.  I didn't change anything in it, but I like to keep a few more cupcake cups at hand than 16,  furtherly I advise any big chocolate lover ( or not! ) to use this recipe!

I thought these were great cupcakes. I made them for my husbands birthday party as a chocolate option and everyone loved them.  I even made them a week ahead, froze them and iced them the day of.  I did follow reviews and fill the cups 1/2 to 2/3 full instead of 3/4 and cooked about 5 minutes longer then the instructions. Will make again!

I needed something fast, I measured the ingredients, handed it to my 20 year old daughter.  They were EXTREMELY dry! I've baked my whole life and my daughter has been most of hers, not sure what happened.  It took an extra 15 minutes to bake as well.

This was a super easy recipe (which was appreciated)! I ran out of vanilla without realizing it, so I decided to replace it with rum extract. I do not recommend this decision. The cupcakes were still delicious, but my entire house now smells like rum! But it was very easy to get creative, and that's always a good thing!!

These were OK - came out dry, probably in part because I followed the directions and filled the cups 3/4 full and the cupcakes were HUGE. I ended up with just 12. And then had to cook them longer until they were done. They were sturdy enough for a lot of icing, so that helped the flavor.

I was very sceptical, having never used all purpose flour and that much milk for cupcakes. Also, as others have said it doesn't seem feasible to cream it with that amount of sugar. However, I followed the recipe 100% and they came out perfect.  So happy with them. DO NOT fill 3/4 full unless you want huge muffin style cupcake.

Yum!  These cupcakes are delicious! I used a bit less sugar and only filled the liners half, as I read the other reviews. They came out perfect! My daughter loves marshmallow fluff frosting, which tastes great with these cupcakes.

I made these exactly as the recipe suggested. I was a bit concerned with the little bit of fat and these possibly being dry, but they aren't. They are pleasantly moist and light. My biggest issue is that they just don't really taste chocolatey enough.  I would be interested to add some mini chocolate chips next time to get that gooy chocolate flavoure when you bite into them.
I used a Pampered Chefs large scoop which measures 3Tbsp for each cup. I also used one Pampered Chef stone muffin pan and a metal muffin tin pan. I found that the ones in the metal pan rose quite considerabley than the ones in the stone pan, they seemed too cook slower and did not rise past the pan edge. 
No muffins stuck to my pans, but I oiled them all very well.

Have made this recipe several times and it always comes out. I use it most often to sub for box cake mix (yuck) in the Cinco de Chili cupcakes on this site. I just add the ancho chili powder and cayenne to the batter. I am also trying it with a salted caramel icing from this site. It yields about 18 - 19 cupcakes for me.

It was good but like others said do not over bake. My oven cooks unevenly and while some cupcakes were great others were a bit dry. I use an ice cream scoop to fill each liner it was a little more than half full, which was a prefect amount. 
I added 1/2 a stick of butter instead of what it called for, increased the cocoa a few tablespoons,  and instead of milk I added heavy cream, plus 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. I also add 1 teaspoon of coffee granules, which is for almost every recipe with chocolate. (It's usually dissolved in a small amount of the recipes liquid). Overall, very good. Will make it again... undercooking them slightly.

Wonderful recipe!  It will be my chocolate cupcake recipe from here on out.  Here are some notes from what I did.

I. One person said to add less milk.  While I would agree if you plan on making and baking all of them in one setting.  I did that at first and agree they were a bit too soft for what I like.  I would say that the milk amount is perfect if you plan on refrigerating them and making them when the batter is cold.

II.  Sift the flour and cocoa powder!  I didn't.  While they were still great, I think they could have been fluffier and the batter smoother if I wasn't too lazy to do so.

III.  I think you can add  to them because the recipe allows is.  I added 3/4 a cup of dark chocolate chips (used up the bag) and it added so much more chocolate flavor.  I think adding nuts or fruit would add so much more depth to this than  just your standard cupcake.

IV.  I didn't add any frosting.  My wife and I hate the stuff.

My 15 year old made these. I advised her to double the butter as 3 tbls butter wouldn't have given these cupcakes enough moisture. The result was moist and chocolaty cupcakes. 
She frosted them with Buttercream icing from this site.

I loved this recipe! It was so good! It tasted like a brownie (unfrosted) and it also tasted very good with the frosting I put on it. My family liked it a lot. I would definitely make it again sometime. I agree 3/4 was to much batter for one cupcake. They came out looking like muffins. some of them deflated. But other than that they were delicious!

I used slightly less sugar but next time, I am definitely going to use the full amount of sugar. Since I didn't add enough sugar, the icing was the perfect finish for the cupcake!

I made the cupcakes half sugar, making it more bitter, but also more delicious. Everyone at my party loved it(including me)! I will make it again for my teachers at my high school!

Best chocolate cupcake is amazing! My kids and I devoured them! I didn't change the recipe at all except for adding a couple tablespoons more butter. I frosted it with the quick and almost professional buttercream icing. I will definitely be making these again!

I listened to the reviews on here and used 1/2 cup of butter. Make sure to add enough milk so the cake is moist (I made the mistake of not adding enough and it cam out too dry). It definitely tastes better with frosting.

These cupcakes are exceptionally delicious. However if you add half of a mashed avocado and bake the cupcakes for an extra five minutes it makes them even more delectable and creamy. They will end up tasting like a brownie, and if you top them with chocolate frosting they are even more amazing.

Terrible recipe! I was cautious because I read the reviews before I made them, but decided to try it. The batter was perfect like normal cake batter. However, when I went to bake them they quickly overflowed even though I filled them half way! They also cooked on the edges and not in the middle, which was all gooey and watery! Do not make these, it'll be a waste of your ingredients

It was very good and I will definitely use this recipe some more.  I did notice that after a day, the cupcakes were a bit watery or soggy or something at the bottom.  Not too big  of a deal though.

This only gets 4 stars. The taste and moistness is wonderful. However, the 350 F baking temp is too low. Due to this low temp, I had to bake the cupcakes for more than 30 minutes, making the outer edges tough and unappealingly chewy. With my second tray of cupcakes, I baked them for 15 min at 375 F and they were perfect!! The baking temp needs to be corrected.

While making these for the first time I cursed this recipe. 3 tbsp of butter is an odd measurement for butter. Also, 1/8 tsp is an odd measurement as well. So there was a bit of guesstimation. In the future, to make things easier, I will just use 1/4 cup of butter. And another reviewer was correct in that you cannot cream the butter and sugar. You're basically just evenly distributing the butter through the sugar. Also, next time I will try 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup honey to cut down on sweetness. 
Now, that brings me to flavor. O. M. G. So flippin yummy!!! Tastes more like a brownie than chocolate cake. I added some cinnamon and the batter tasted like hot cocoa.
Like other people have said, only fill the cups half way. 3/4 is way too much for a reg size cupcake pan. Unless you're into that. I am. But it made it so I had to add 5 min to the cook time. I regret nothing, and have no desire to share these with anyone.
I made a pretty simple, not too sweet, lightly spiced butter cream to go with them.
I about died when I ate one.

Although the taste was awesome, tastes like brownies, Just like so many others stated, the cupcakes rose and fell. I was making these for a friend's birthday and I couldn't give them to her.  My family did enjoy the rejects however. They really are tasty!

Sigh, disappointing. I don't like to leave bad reviews, but I have to be brutally honest here. 
First off I had to add way more butter than was called for.  You cannot cream sugar and butter with that little bit of butter. Second, I improved (or at least I thought I did) upon the recipe by adding a whole melted Hershey bar as well as a splash of coffee to bring out the chocolate taste, but the cakes had hardly any chocolate flavor whatsoever. About the same as anything you get out of a box.  I have never experienced that before with other recipes. Generally, adding any actual chocolate and coffee make the taste way better. Also, I filled the baking cups 3/4 way as instructed and they overflowed and pretty much turned into hollow muffins. Several of them even fell apart and I had to put them into the garbage disposer. :(  Luckily, I made a yummy coffee icing from another recipe on hand that sort of saved the ones that were intact. If you are a super chocolate lover, I would avoid this recipe.

These were delicious. I made them gluten free by substituting the wheat flour for rice flour plus 3/4 tsp xanthan gum. Works perfectly. One important note though -- the baking time is given as 15 minutes at 350, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. You're going to be inserting that toothpick continuously for the next 10 minutes. So just set the timer at 25 minutes and save yourself the trouble. The original recipe poster must have had an oven that ran really hot. My oven is true to temperature and I baked mine for 25 minutes exactly. Typically cupcakes take a lot longer than 15 minutes.

The cakes are good but it made much more than 16. I made 12 and still almost filled them up to the top. I did have to put them in for a little extra time and they didn't really puff up very much. They didn't have that much chocolate taste to them but were overall pretty good.

Overall structure was great, no crumb when removed from liner, Moist and  brownie like. Creaming is a method, where the fats and sugars are combined, the end result in this recipe leaves it crumb like. Much unlike a cookie dough. Finishes great with any method.

I really liked this recipe! I put carrot and chocolate chips in as Well. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup because of the butter measurement. I just think that this recipe should be more accurate. Anyhow it's a wonderful recipe I'll come back to it. I enjoyed it very much.

First time trying this one. They came out well. I put an Oreo in the liner before adding the batter. I also used dark cocoa instead of unsweetened & threw in a package of instant fudge pudding mix (and added only 1 cup of flour). They were very dense and chocolatey. I did some other tweaks but overall it's a good recipe.

This came out yummy. But I used 1/2 cup milk instead of 3/4 cups. Instead of filling 3/4 cup with the batter, I filled it 1/2. And I had about 1/2 cup cocoa powder. Used that. Turned out  to be just fine. Soft and tasty.

We did this for my daughter's birthday, it was simple and didn't take long. Came out tasting great - we made a buttercream frosting to top it off. Hard to go wrong with that combination!

These are amazing!  You'd be tempted to add more flour but don't!  I used sifted cake flour which made them extra fluffy.

These cupcakes are really delish.  They are very moist, just the way I like cupcakes to be and very flavorful.  I followed the recipe as written, except that I melted the butter before creaming it with the sugar, as one reviewer recommended.  The recipe made two dozen cupcakes, and I baked one dozen with a cherry in the middle of each and topped them all with cream cheese frosting and a Hershey's Chocolate Kiss .  Everyone loved them!  This recipe is definitely worth using time and time again.

Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! However instead of 3/4 I did 1/2. Also, I melted the butter and added it with the wet ingredients, and the sugar with the dry.

I followed every step and put an exact amount of ingredients that is mentioned. Cupcakes had a really intensive chocolate taste, were extremely fluffy and soft. I ended up with making nearly 50 of them instead of 15 :-) As they were very sweet I used fresh lemon butter cream for decorating and it was a perfect mix. And a glass of warm milk just made it perfect.

The cupcakes were super moist! Instead of all-purpose flour, I used cake flour, I find it makes the cake extra moist. They were delicious with the whipped cream cheese frosting, which can also be found on this website!

Love the cupcakes! They turned out light and moist. The only adjustments I made are cutting down the cocoa powder used to 1/2 cup  and substituting buttermilk for milk (as suggested by other reviewers). This one is a keeper for me.

This is so flavorful and so chocolaty! I made the following changes:
1: I add 1/4 cup 72% dark chocolate chips. 
2: I use 2 espresso shots (60 ml) with 180 ml fat-free milk to make the flavor stronger.
3. I reduce sugar to 1 1/4 cup 
The result is very intense chocolately cupcakes..... maybe a little too flavorful, I may omit chocolate  chips next time and try to use applesauce to reduce calories from fat., but the original recipe is good enough as it is.

I filled it about 1/2 instead, but if you prefer larger cupcakes do what they said.
I loved the recipe. I made it with strawberry icing, and it all tasted amazing together. 10/10 would make again.

Cupcakes took a lot longer to cook than instructions said. I left some in for 10 mins longer then they turned hard after they were finally done. Did I do something wrong??

I made it, they are good.  My mix was a little tick but I just mix a little more of milk and they came out good and tasty.  This is the third recipe I have tried and it is the best so far.  Thanks for sharing.

The cupcakes were vert tasty, made the recipe just as written. I'm making them again today, but I will only fill the muffin liners up to 1/2 instead of 3/4. There was a huge muffin top and very hard to get out of the pan! But yum!

The cupcakes taste good, but definitely only fill the liners halfway!! I did the 3/4 and this is a disaster. They overflowed and now i have batter everywhere and terrible looking cupcakes.

The cupcakes did turn out well, but it ended up taking about 25 minutes to cook them instead of 17, and I had to keep putting them back in. They do taste delicious though.

They came very very dry, I even did the 1/2 butter instead as suggested in the reviews. I sifted the ingredients and added the dry to wet ingredients as directed. They looked great but, they are just too crummy and dry not and not for me.

I baked this recipe as directed, and it made 24 cupcakes instead of just 16. I only filled the cups 1/2 full, and they rose perfectly. The cupcakes were fairly delicate, but could stand a decent amount of frosting (I made chocolate buttercream).

I made these Chocolate Cupcakes and they turned out delicious!!! The only thing that I recommend you do is to pour a little less batter in the cupcake liners than what the recipe calls for. I am definitely going to make these Chocolate Cupcakes again.

If you do not have vanilla frosting, you can use chocolate like I did.  They also taste good with GS Thin Mints on the bottom.  Overall, delicious!!!

This recipe was close to perfection but the one change a added was 1/3 cup more of milk to make the cake more moist. I used a simple Vanilla buttercream frosting to tie it all together and topped it off with chocolate chips. I will DEFINITELY be making this again.

This recipe is definitely a keeper and recommended. However I did not use salt and used almond milk instead of regular milk, the second time I made them. The results tasted the same.

I made the recipe exactly as asked and followed the steps as the video. They turned out so good. My kids said, "It is a do over!" I will say that I was confused at first on how only 3T of butter would mix well with that much sugar. But the eggs made it work.  Next time I will try some applesauce for butter, to make them even more healthier.  Do not expect them to taste the same as the cupcakes made with oil.  Try out the recipe AS IS you will not be disappointed.

I made it, it was really yummy. The problem that the cake was seperated from the cupcake liners and it did not raise although it was so soft and fluffy.  it did not look like a cupcake.

Just ok cupcakes, didn't think the texture was right. Chocolate flavor was strong, but seemed off to me.  My husband thought they were good, a little strong for my toddlers.

This was our official first cupcake ever made on our new cupcake business and tasted so yummy with cookie dough frosting on top. We topped it off with a chocolate ganche and chocolate filling. Tasted amazing!

The batter was good. At first, the cupcakes rose really high and then they sank to the bottom of the pan as soon as we took them out of the oven, and they were still batter.

These did not work out at all. They rose way too high and then fell, which prevented the layer right beneath the top from cooking all the way through. I put them back in to try to get that part to cook and it just wouldn't.

These cupcakes taste good but simply will not stay together.
They crumble before coming out of the pan.

These weren't the best cupcakes I've ever had. A bit dry, and honestly bland tasting. For the amount of cocoa powder in relation to other dry ingredients, I expected a more chocolately flavor but ended up with a faint taste instead. Still edible, but not awesome.

I loved these cupcakes! They were very good and had just the right texture : light and fluffy, slightly moist. The only thing that I would want to change is the sweetness. I think they should have been sweeter.

Wonderful flavor and texture. Only used a 1/2 cup of the cocoa to keep them moist, and filled the cupcake papers slightly under half full, they rise quite a bit while cooking. Wonderful with a simple cream cheese frosting and ground semi-sweet chocolate drizzled on top.

Pretty good!!!! The best cupcake recipe. I made some changes because my family doesn't want it too sweet so I cut the sugar in half of the original amount. Made some mocha cupcakes with this recipe by substituting mocha powder instead of the cocoa powder. I also changed the amount of butter to 1 stick of butter of 8 table spoons instead of just 3 because it is impossible to cream the sugar with 3 tbps of butter. Thank you so much!!! Love baking and definitely love these!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and they sank in the middle. After reading on line on how to prevent this I came up with either the oven temp was too high or I over beat the batter. I first tried turning down the oven and still the sank and took longer to bake. So I figure I over mixed the batter. I suggest adding all the flour at once after adding all the milk at once and mix less! The flavor was bland and dull. Not very chocolate at all.

These were great! i didn't have the overflow problem that others had. filled them up about 2/3 and they rose to top perfectly. The only substitutions i made was to only add half the butter and half applesauce and i cut the sugar down to 1 cup. They were great!! Will definitely make again

Where as I found this cupcake good, I felt it had a texture more like a brownie. It also did not rise like my usual cupcakes do. I check my expiration dates and they were fine.

I made this recipe and it was delicious! We paired the cupcakes with homemade peanut butter icing!  The only thing we had to change is that the recipe says to add 3 Tbsp but it is virtually impossible to cream with only that amount. I suggest adding  about 4 Tbsp to 5. Also at the end we realized that our batter was a little thick so we added about a 1/4 cup of milk and that really helped to thin it out

When I made them I added dark chocolate morsels and topped it with a chocolate whipped cream I made. The cupcakes were moist and tasted amazing. Positively sinful!

Great cupcakes! I'm nine years old and love to bake, but these were the best! One change: instead one cup of milk, make it with one and a third cups. Otherwise, they are great!

The cupcakes managed to turn inside out, meaning they look like cups. I feel as though that I am the only person that somehow did this. I think they would be better brownies than cupcakes.

I made this recipe last night & the only thing I changed was the amount of butter. Instead of 3 TBSPS, I use about 6. The sugar does not blend well with only 3 TBSPNS. I did not like these cupcakes. I felt it was too heavy on the cocoa side, leaving my cupcakes a lil bitter. Also, if u fill the cups 2/3 full, u will get muffins. The only cupcake that came out looking like a cupcake was the cup I filled closer to a 1/4 full. Maybe too much baking powder in the recipe. Also, the cake is very crumbly & baking for 17 minutes dried out the cake. Or maybe the lack of oil. Overall, it's a nice basic recipe that needs some tweaking to make the kind of chocolate cupcake I am craving.

When I made this I used apple sauce instead of butter and Vanilla flavored almond milk instead of regular milk, then added a dash of hazelnut coffee creamer. Came out tasting like a chocolate truffle in cupcake form! So moist!

They turned out a little dry, but aside from that they're delicious. I'd recommend using powdered sugar/confectioner's sugar though maybe. Mine turned out a bit... "crunchy" cause of the sugar, which I certainly did not like. Will definitely be making this again!

These were delicious! I'd messed up the first time by melting the butter instead of softening it. It makes a HUGE difference in the texture of the mix. This time, they were fluffy and tasted great without any topping. I'm making these for my dads birthday and they taste even better if you add chocolate chips to the batter :) I'd definitely make these again.

Im one of the unlucky whose cupcakes  over flowed & never cooked all the way through. Burnt on the bottom of the oven. Maybe cause I  I had to use Fat Free milk to avoid the store.

These were fine cupcakes, nothing extraordinary.  The instruction to 'cream' was misleading as some people mentioned. I had to cook my cupcakes for 20 mins, not the suggested 15- 17. Good recipe.

Moist and yummy. Used only 1 cup of sugar but increased the butter to half cup - as advised in the comments.  Did not even need any frosting. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe

My 3 stars actually stand for how dry this recipe resulted. I forgot to read the reviews so I followed the directions for filling up the cups. As others point out do not fill the cupcake molds as indicated. I feel like if you just fill each cup by half full will do it.  I used the chocolate ganache recipe from this website for decorating them. I sprinkled coarse sugar and put one glaze decoration and it looks perfect for the holidays. This recipe is not bad just needs more butter to moisten up and be heavenly!

Very simple recipe to follow for a novice like myself. they turned out perfect! I added banana butter cream icing to some and they worked well. my batter made 24 with a little batter left so that's the only adjustment I would say is needed.

I followed the recipe exactly, and they were good - very light texture. The cupcake itself is not real sweet and chocolatey. I paired them with Creamy Chocolate Frosting also on this site. The frosting is very sweet - actually more sweet than chocolatey. I doubled the recipe and made 3 1/2 dozen cupcakes that were level with the top on liners. I will use this recipe again and modify the frosting.

I made these cupcakes for Halloween and they were a HUGE HIT! Everyone loved them. I would just recommend filling the cupcake pan only half way because 3/4 makes them huge. I also didn't add salt but it didn't change the taste at all. But, other than that, GREAT CUPCAKES!

the recipe was good, the vanilla taste was too much for me so next time half as much or no vanilla at all. It is impossible to cream so little butter with so much sugar so you shouldn't say cream.

Super rich and decadent chocolate cupcakes!!! I gave 4 out of 5 stars because the batter was super thick at the end and bent my wire whisk! Lol. The chocolate is very, very rich! I think next time (yes, there will be a next go at these babies!) I will add less cocoa powder and a wee bit more milk so my whisk won't bend again! Hehe, overall,  me and my daughter loved making these!

4 stars because I changed a few things. 

We are dairy allergic, so I changed the "butter" to 1/2 c and added half dairy free sour cream half dark chocolate soy milk. I also changed the sugar to mostly white with about 1/4 c brown for added flavor. This is a great basic recipe, but with my changes, it was moist and full of flavor! This will definitely be my go-to for cupcakes! I also baked donuts in my Wilton donut pan and they were delicious as well!

I did not care for this recipe. I have made a number of recipes from this site and have made things from scratch before. In my years, I have undercooked things, ovecooked things, burned things, but nothing prepared me for this. I guess most others that tried this recipe had great success with it. When I saw the rating and that it had over 800 reviews, I figured it would be wonderful to try. I made the recipe as the directions stated, with the ingredients listed. I didn't change anything. The baking time seemed to vary a little between reviewers, so I just went with the time listed on the recipe. The amount of batter to put into the cups also varied with reviewers. I ended up filling the cups about halfway. Once in the oven, the cupcakes did okay at first. When I checked on them again, they had expanded up and over the cup edges and the batter was spreading across the cupcake pan as they all started to connect into a giant mess. The middles of them still looked a bit raw from my view through the oven window, so I continued to let them bake. By the time they were done, the batter had risen, overflowed and the middles had sunk down into the cups.

The amount of baking powder makes them puff up when baking and then cave in a bit when they cool, like perfect little bowls for ice cream! Add a small scoop on top and these cupcakes are somehow even more amazing. Moist, rich, delicious,and easy-to-make are some adjectives that come to mind!

I made these while babysitting my brothers, and they loved them! They were good as far as taste, but they weren't moist. Looking at the past reviews, I had to agree with not filling them as high, as they got very tall. Great easy recipe!

I thought the texture was chalky, but the taste was ok. I wouldn't try it again but my sister liked it. I think that with a few moderate changes to the recipe would make it taste good, but a big thing was that 3/4 of the muffin tin is way to much so I suggest you use less.

I made the recipe exactly as the directions say.  DO NOT fill the cups 3/4 full!! 1/2 full or a little less is perfect.  3/4 is definitely over full and made a mess.  

They taste wonderful, though!  I was worried they wouldn't be moist with so little butter involved but they're great.  Happy with the recipe!

I've made this twice now. The first time, I made it exactly as the directions and the batter was fluffy. The second time, I mixed all dry together then added the butter/liquid mixture. Not as fluffy but still worked out well.

The first time I made it, I went with the 15 min baking time, didn't seem like it was enough and let it go for another 5-7 minutes. When I took the first two trays (12 cupcakes) out of the oven, they sunk, HARD. Didn't really cook. The second two trays (10 cupcakes total), I baked for 30 minutes and they turned out well.

The second time, I just baked everything for 30 minutes and had no issues.

I also modified the recipe slightly each time. I added some raspberry sauce, I found in a cheesecake recipe, injected into the middle, and topped them off with cream cheese icing. I like how they turned out this way.

I'll keep this recipe and make it again.

Just tried out this recipe and exactly like what most commented...fill the cups half full, use 1/2 cup of butter and I melted it in the microwave and then poured it into the sugar which I reduced to 1 cup. That way I didn't have to use the mixer. I split the batch in half and added chocolate chips to the mix. My niece tried it and she preferred the one with the chocolate chips! All in all an easy recipe that makes lovely cupcakes!

really delicious!!!
the cupcakes are soft, moist and rich. my friends and my family luuuve them! i didnt give 5 stars because i made some adjustments after reading other reviews: i used 60g of butter & only 1 cup of sugar. this would yield about 18 cupcakes =) oh i also added 2 tbsp of orange zest.
great recipe. definitely a keeper!

Glancing through the reviews I realized I'd have to make a few adaptations. I did 4 tbsp butter and about 7/8 cup milk. The cupcakes turned out beautifully moist and flavourful! I also added a bit of finely chopped chocolate mint. It gives just a hint of mint flavour to the cake and was a huge hit with my family! I also added a bit of chocolate mint to the frosting recipe I used but that proved to be too much mint flavour for my family (though I still quite enjoyed it)!

I actually tried out this recipe with a few changes-it worked out great!!!
You just have to use common sense on your part-
don't mix a tiny amount of solid butter with sugar.
Just melt the butter and add both to your batter.
It won't really matter at the end-same great taste no matter what!

It was very very good ! I followed the recipe almost exactly except I subbed theregular flour it calls for cake flour ( has salt, baking soda and powder already in the flour so saves me time in the kitchen. will definitely be making again since my daughter loved them ( she's not much into desserts ).

This recipe didn't work at all the batter spilled over the top making a huge mess in my oven. I was very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it.

We made these and I thought they were great even without frosting. They were very soft and fluffy. They did fall apart easily but they tasted great!

As unfortanate as it is to say, these did not work out at all for me! I had to bake something for my youthgroup tonight, and I told everyone I was going with chocolate cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly as said- and the cupcakes came out concave in the center, and stuck to the cupcake liners! LOL. :-O Make sure, if your going to try out this recipe, that you spray the cupcake tins on the surface. If the cupcakes overflow, they'll be as hard as a rock on the surface and will have to be chizzled off! ;-) Hopefully your experience will be better that mine.

Awesome! It is the answer to my cocolate cravings. Wonerful flaver. I used cake flour instead of all purpose and they turned out just fine. Only filled the cups halfway. Nice results so I can put iceing on them without the frosting trying to run off.

I should have read through more reviews; these did not turn out. The top was hard as a rock and sunk in, and the inside wasn't even done. At first I thought this happened because I put some chocolate chips in the batter, but after reading some other reviews I see that I'm not the only one who had trouble. I read that opening the oven while baking, overmixing and overfilling can make cupcakes sink in, but I know I didn't do any of those things, so it has to be the recipe. I wouldn't recommend making these at all.

These cupcakes taste good, moist, rise perfectly,beautiful color, if you don't have a sweet tooth, reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup, use good quatily cocoa powder, add in some instant coffee, it will bring out the chocolate flavor, frost it with chocolate or vanilla frosting and they're great to go.

Absolutely lovely recipe and results.  I did however make an adjustment, I melted the butter and mixed it with the eggs and vanilla, and then sifted the flour, cocoa, leavening agents and sugar together, then added the dry ingredients and the egg mixture, and the milk in alternately, I ended up with 12 regular size cupcakes and a small tray of 12 mini, big ones for the big people and tiny ones for me the diabetic.  I will use this time and time again.  I made lemon frosting for them, and the mixture of dark chocolate cake with tangy lemon frosting was heaven.

I thought they tasted amazing but my friends (all of them Germans. I mention that because I've noticed that Germans seem to like less sugar then Americans. I'm not its not true for everyone, but I've noticed this in the last year that I've lived in Germany) thought they were too sweet. I didn't even use frosting, but instead powdered sugar. I thought they were wonderful!

I made this recipe twice and the second time was better because I added  about a cup of choclate chips to give it a more chocolate taste  the first time I tasted the cocoa powder and cocoa powder does not taste great but other than that my family loved it.

These were some pretty good cupcakes! So after going through a lot of the reviews and deciding to make them, I also took the advice of some others and used 1/2 stick of butter instead of 3 tbsp. While I was beating the butter and sugar it was crumbly which I kinda freaked out about, but it was ok so don't worry. Also, minor adjustment but I filled each cup about halfway full and they were the perfect height, not spilling over like a muffin. They were a tiny bit dry, but it was probably my fault for not watching them close enough while they were baking. I made some vanilla frosting and sprinkled some crushed candy cane on top and they were the perfect Christmas treats! :)
My only advice is watch them super closely becasue they will probably be done in less than 15 minutes.

I liked this recipe due to its simplicity however I have to disagree with the people saying use less milk. I used all of the milk and ended up adding more to the batter. My cakes were a little bit dry but still very good, great recipe!

I made a batch of these last night. I had to add extra sugar as I found the batter to be rather bitter still. In hindsight, I wish I had substituted melted semi-sweet bakers chocolate for the cocoa powder. I think it would have produced a smoother flavor. These taste quite good though, I used a cream cheese icing for them.

My 12 year old daughter wants to start baking so we tried this one and it was very yummy.  A little on the dry side but loved the crunchy outside and with frosting was perfect!  She had fun making this recipe.  Also instead of just creaming the butter and sugar we creamed it with an egg at a time and it worked out perfectly.  Thank you

I baked these today to take to work for co-workers who are leaving. I used 1/2 cup of butter to cream with the sugar. As suggested elsewhere I only filled the cups halfway and it made 2 doz. regular size cupcakes. Otherwise, I used the recipe as is. Moist and wonderful. I'll use this as my go-to cupcake recipe from now on.

Wonderful taste, better than brownies. Unfortunately half of mine caved in. Next time I'll raise my oven temp just a bit and wait till the eggs and milk are at room temp. I probably overmixed the batter too, because they were very dense, not a packed-full-of-chocolate kind of way, but in a bordering-on-chewy kind of way. I also whisked the dry ingredients because I didn't have anything to sift with. I'll attempt these again soon, the flavor is so worth it!

It's really great! I especially like that it's very fluffy and moist. Though, the serving size is more than expected. It says 16 but I was able to make 30 cupcakes. Still, it's all good. More for me!

This was this first recipe I've tried for cupcakes from scratch...easy and delicious. Really light and not overly sweet. I topped with a cream cheese frosting but they are good without frosting too. I'll never use a boxed cake mix for cupcakes after trying these.

I followed this recipe exactly (except for the baking time) to make both mini and regular sized cupcakes. They came out very well! They were not moist, but not dry either. I did cover them after baking to reduce moisture loss, though. The flavor wasn't anything special or exciting, but was adequate. This is a good, simple chocolate cake recipe.

I didnt have a probably with this recipe at all. I just looking for a quick easy recipe for the timing being. I made the cupcakes and everyone said they loved them, more than other recipes ive used. All I did to change the recipe was add a little bit of vegetable oil because I feel that makes it mor moist and it did. Love this recipe!

Tasty! They were easy to make and quite filling.  One cupcake hit the spot for me. The consistency was between a brownie/cake that I found perfect! I used a almost double the amount of butter called for, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Will make again! Thanks for sharing :)

Great recipe! However, I couldn't seem to cream the butter and sugar. It might be because I was using margarine instead. Nevertheless, after adding the egg and the milk (i used around half the amount of milk, and I used rice milk instead), all the sugar managed to dissolve. As mentioned by the other reviewers, the batter would rise up high, so it's better to fill around half of the muffin cup instead of 3/4.

These cupcakes are so tasty, it doesn't need to have a frosting anymore. Anyway, I think the ingredients are not enough to make 16 cupcakes,mine only made like 12. It looks wrong at first, because you can't cream the sugar with only 3 tbsp of butter, but still, I followed the same ingredients but still turned out so good.

The unbaked batter tasted delicious so I had high hopes.  But not only did they sink in the middle, and overflow the cups, but the consistency was dry and tough. I doubled the recipe, so in the hopes of salvaging half of it, I poured the remaining batter into a brownie pan.  Pretty sure this is a total loss. So glad that I did not waste my time and more ingredients by making the frosting for these pitiful cupcakes.

I made mini cupcakes using this recepie. They came out very nice. The only 2 problems i have were that they sank the first time i made them, and one of the trays overflowded. I think those problems were not due to the recepie, but me as unexperienced baker and my old fashoned gas oven with hard-to-control temperature settngs. It took about 25 min in my oven to get them ready. And they dont sink anymore/)))
As for cupcakes the taste is very rich and texture is soft and light. Perfect to my taste. I made chocolate brigadeiro topping (condenced milk cooked togethter with chocolate and a splash of heavy cream) and they complimented each other perfectly. Thank you for the great recepie!

Just took these out of the oven. They are a bit dry and lacking in the chocolate department. Not horrible by any means, and you can tell they aren't a box mix (which is good), but I think they need more fat in them.

Didn't turn out.  First off, if you fill them 3/4 full, they WILL overflow.  Fill them only have way.  Secondly, they will raise up HUGE and then fall in the center, making for very ugly cupcakes.  I don't think that 3 Tablespoons of butter is enough.  As for taste, it wasn't the best.  Not a cupcake, more like a brownie.

The cupcakes didn't come out well. They over flowed and sank in the middle. The flavor was good but the cupcakes were crumbly.

I followed the recipe to a T and it ended up horrible. They taste good and everything but they sank big time and overflowed out of the muffin tin indention. They looked more like tiny pie crusts than muffins.

I followed this recipe exactly, only I halved it. My cupcakes didn't rise at all and I know my baking powder and soda are not duds because I use them all the time for other stuff. Maybe the cocoa powder made it to alkaline or weighed it down. I was suspicious of this after making the batter because it was dense like brownie mix. Or it could be the alternating milk and dry then mixing and it became an over mixed gluten blob. I can't help but wonder why others got such rise for their cupcakes and mine became hockey pucks. I will try other recipe next time.

I made these cupcakes for my daughters basketball team and they loved them so much they asked for more! It was a super easy to follow recipe and they came out great. Swapped the cocoa powder for more flour and increased the vanilla to 1tsp and made vanilla and chocolate!

Although they are chocolatey, the cupcake was way too dense for my taste.  I was looking for something more airy. I also have to agree w/some regarding trying to cream 3 TBSP of butter.... I'll be looking for a different recipe

These cupcakes are pretty good. They're nice a chocolately without being overwhelming. My biggest objection to the recipe is that it makes 2 dozen cupcakes, not the 16 it advertizes. As other reviewers have said, you should only fill the cups 1/2 to 2/3 full if you don't want your cupcakes to overflow the cups and look terrible.

I have made these cupcakes 4 times in the last few months. At first they tasted great short of me filling the cup as reccomended. The second time again tasted good but forgot to pay attention the the measurments for filling the cups an over filled again (my fault) . Third time I made them I remembered not to do so but they didnt taste as  good as the first two times an didnt hold together well. The last time I made them they came out to appear perfect but as I bit into them an ate them realized there really dry an dense. I reread through the reviews seeing as I need chocolate cupcakes for a baby shower this weekend an see a lot of changes I did not see the first time. I do feel I will give them a try my next go around but will be seeking another recipe for this weekend cause I can not bring myself to have another defeat from this recipe as I did my sons birthday party in Sept. I strongly suggest to anyone here to read the changes others have made an try tweaking this recipe as they have.

I did not care for this recipe. I made the mixture did everything it said and I put it in the oven. I took it out and the cupcakes sank, then I decided to cook them for 3 more minutes so they burned!!!

Good cupcakes, but don't fill them 3/4 full. I should have read the other reviews before making them. They go up and out of the cupcake paper. Otherwise very good!

I found that this recipe, as is, was not chocolatey enough.  It would benefit from some added cocoa or chocolate chips. I would also have to shorten the cook time. 
Will try again with some changes.

Great only thing is I added half a cup of butter because it was really grainy and I added coconuts inside and on top it was delicious

Yum! These are delicious! I halved the recipe and added semi-sweet chocolate chips, and made them in my cupcake maker on the first try. Were tasty without frosting too. This one's a keeper :)

These are awesome cupcakes! I put sprinkles on them, they are moist. Also, I didn't have butter, so I used grapeseed oil, and they still tasted good.They also looked beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-walrus:)

Over all I would say this recipe is a keeper.  I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and used dark cocoa powder.  They turned out very good, as long as you don't over bake them! Otherwise you will have dry cupcakes, which is what I noticed most of the negative reviews were on.  This is a good basic cupcake recipe, nothing too fancy.  Also be aware that you cannot cream the butter with the sugar,there just i'snt enough butter called for in the recipe...however once you add in the eggs everything will come together nicely and clump free.

This is super easy recipe and really quick to make. But it seemed to be lacking something.  I want to say it is salt that was lacking.  It was a little dry ,but still held it's shape nicely.

very chocolaty and delicious, you could eat them without icing.  after reading reviews, decided to try more of a buttermilk flavor and added lemon juice to the milk since i did not have buttermilk on hand.  worked out great!

So good!  Great chocolate flavor. Soft in the middle, so put in the freezer to set up and it helped.  Had all items in the kitchen to make it, nothing to crazy to add. Kids put in chocolate chips, made it to soft in the middle, but can not go wrong with chocolate taste.

I was out of baking powder when I made these, so I ended up using a little cream of tarter and additional baking soda to make up for it. It turned out well. I was a little concerned that the batter was thin, but after cooking, everything was fine. While these are good by themselves, I think I will try making some icing for them in the future. A quick and easy to make recipe that I'm sure I'll use again. Thanks for sharing!

These were perfect! They have a fabulous dark chocolate taste and were super moist, even after spending the night uncovered in the fridge. The only change I made to the recipe was I used closer to 2-3 tsp of vanilla, but I at least double the vanilla in everything! Will definitely be making again! Pair perfectly with peanut butter frosting!

Absolutely delicious! As I am from Holland I first wanted to use the metric amounts..but in the movie you can see a mug of milk of 250ml... which in the metrics is 235ml (which is actually correct)... so started doubting. I used a cup (lucky me.. I have those). And that was already very moist... plus I got about 16 big cupcakes and 12 mini cupcakes out of the amount.. so a lot more than the recipe is mentioning...But the kids loved it!

It is a very easy recipe, however it made 18 cupcakes and I would recommend putting less mixture in a cup, because they grew big like muffins. I altered the recipe a little. I used less sugar, and replaces cocoa powder with Hershey's chocolate syrup, and added almond extract instead of vanilla. It was delicious! I frosted them with whipped cheese cake frosting. I will make them again!

I am sorry, not sure what went wrong, but it was a total waste of my time and energy. The batter seemed really nice. They baked horrible. First they were rising nicely, then they fell apart leaving a hole in the middle. They were also sticking to the cupcake liners a lot. Had to throw them away.

I was not crazy about this recipe. I think there wasn't enough butter or oil added because mine came out extremely dry. It was definitely chocolaty enough, but it stuck to the paperliners and the tops were crusty.

I liked this these.  Made 19, and didn't overflow.  A little crumbly.
Also, saw another review about blending the small about of butter with sugar.  I did this by starting with 1/2 cup of sugar, and blending and adding the rest of the sugar gradually.  It was kind of a grainy blend, but it worked well.   I will make these again

I did not like these at all, however my kids loved them. They came out more like brownies than cake. They were very dense and thick. I do believe the only reason they came out moist was because instead of using milk I used buttermilk and added some sour cream to the mix. I read a few reviews were they came out dry and I didn't want that to happen to mine. 

I also added extra cocoa powder to give it a more chocolate flavor. I thought that homemade peanut butter buttercream icing would go well with them but unfortunately I was wrong. Although once again my kids loved the combination.

So I will give them 2 stars only because my kids loved them so I happy that it was not a total lost cause. The ONLY way I will make these again is if my kids ask me.

Disappointing...I greased my pan instead of using cupcake wrappers and they stuck and fell apart. Flavor is not very sweet, it's kind of blah.

I followed the recipe exactly except used 1% milk. They turned out really well; I will keep this recipe and use it again. It made 20 cupcakes and they  are delicious even though I used store bought frosting.

These where my first cupcakes that I've ever made (I come from Europe and cupcakes are just coming here from USA) and I have to say  they are amazing! They are moist and perfect for every chocoholic. My niece and nephew loved them and I put some rum over the ones for us grown ups.

This recipe is good! Just as other reviewers had mentioned, it is impossible to 'cream' the butter and sugar together but it isn't necessary to melt the butter. When the butter and sugar was thoroughly mixed, I added the eggs and everything was fine and dandy (not as fluffy as it would have been if the butter was mixed, but creamy enough).   The recipe yielded 14 cupcakes for me and the cupcakes turned out moist.   Oh, I decreased the amount of sugar by 75g, (about 1/2 cup?) and it was just right.

Before making this recipe, I failed twice at attempting to make 2 different chocolate cake recipes on this site into chocolate cupcakes.  Finally, I decided just to make one called chocolate cupcakes.  While these were a little on the dry side the second day, they were pretty good right after making them.  Topping them with a homemade chocolate butter cream helps a lot with that.  Overall, the kids I was serving these to really liked them, and they were gone at the end of the night.

These looked good on the outside, but tasted not so good.  Firstly,  I subbed oil for butter as some suggested.  Secondly, the batter made about 24 as I only filled the cups about halfway.  Finally, they came out really dry and not w/ rich flavor.  Not even the peanut butter icing I made helped.   On a good note, I did get some compliments from guests, so I'll give them a third star for that.  They were middle-of-the road.

I was a little disappointed with these cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly with the one exception of using 1/2c butter per other recommendations. The flavor was great but the texture of the cupcake was not light and fluffy like it should be. It was rather chalky.

Super easy recipe. Made these for my son's 2nd birthday party. Used the 1/2 cup butter as suggested by other reviewers...and doubled the recipe. Yielded 33 good sized cupcakes with filling the liners about half way. Lots of compliments! Used the recipe for "Quick and Almost Professional Buttercream Icing" to frost them (double the recipe).

I needed an quick and easy, yet great tasting cupcake for my son's birthday party the following morning. I was very impressed with the moist texture and chocolatey taste. Just wish it had been paired with a frosting recipe to top it off!

Decent cupcakes.  I wanted to make the Mini Oreo Surprise Cupcakes on here to take to a party tonight, and I don't have chocolate cake mix, so I used this recipe.  Worked just fine.  They aren't incredible, but not bad cupcakes.  they are easy and quick, which certainly helps.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not usually one to leave negative feedback, but these were the worst cupcakes I've ever made. When I tried to lift them out of the cupcake pan, they all broke in half. Not a single one came out intact They weren't moist at all, and they didn't taste like anything special either. I had made these as a gift for a friend, but they came out so badly I was too embarrassed to give them to him.

Not bad, not bad at all. Used a smidge more butter and a smidge less milk. Dissolved the soda in the milk instead of mixing with dry ingredients. Iced with vanilla butter cream icing and topped with a disk of marshmallow fondant. The household loved them :)

Good taste but much too dry.  I didn't have any problems with the cupcakes exploding or collapsing in the middle.  In fact they looked great so it was disappointing when I bit into one.

This recipe was great! I didn't melt the butter but I did mix it with the wet ingredients, and I used about 1/3 cup of milk instead of 1 cup. I mixed the sugar with the dry ingredients. I frosted them and decorated them and they were absolutely delicious and didn't fall apart TOO bad. I think using actual shortening will help make them more firm.

These were great - super easy to make.  I didn't have baking powder to had to sub with extra baking soda but the consistency was still very good.  Topped with vanilla butter frosting....mmmmmmm

I am so disappointed. I am up till 11 at night making cupcakes for my 3 year olds birthday tomorrow and these cupcakes are not what i had in mind at all. I followed the recipe to the T but they are soooo dry. But then again i should've known better since it only called for 3 tbsp of butter. This is my first recipe from this website which has turned out so bad. I am giving it 2 stars because the cupcakes looked good...and i made 20 cakes out of the batter

Reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and reduced the cocoa to 2 tablespoonfuls because I used dutch pure cocoa powder, and used low fat milk instead of whole milk. The cake rose quite a bit, was light and fluffy and moist. My husband complained that it had a spicy aftertaste though, and I'm not sure how that got into the cake. The are fudgy from the fridge and are still tasty the 2nd day after baking.

They were amazing!! I used the Chocolate Frosting l for the frosting and they were sooo good. But you should fill them 1/2 full or less unless you like scraping off crusty cupcake off the pan.

This cupcake recipe was good. Make sure you don't overfill the liners - maybe fill 1/2?  They really tasted like brownies though - very yummy!

The only change I made to this recipe was cutting it in half. I don't know what went wrong, but the cupcakes didn't hold together very well. However, the taste and texture were perfect for turning them into cake balls!

A very moist and rich cupcake.  Love that it's so low fat (but doesn't taste like it).  Planning on using the Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting on them today.

I will make these cupcakes again and again! They turned out perfectly, even though I used skim milk and substituted the butter with margarine.  I halved the recipe (changed number of servings to 8 instead of 16) and it made one dozen cupcakes--I followed other reviewers' advice and only filled the cups 1/2 full.

These are very good cupcakes. I halfed the recipe and it made 14 so the originial recipe probebly made way to much. i also had to cook them a little bit longer (about 20 minutes). The flavor was good though, and they were very easy to make.

Very good chocolate cupcakes. I followed some of the others' advice and added less milk.
Then I added some chocolate chips to the batter. It was delicious to have a small pieces of chocolate in the cupcake.

I made these cupcakes last night and they turned out great. the only thing i change was i added a little more butter then what the recipe say and cream only cup of sugar and added the half with the flour. Also to keep the cupcakes form sticking to the paper i spray it with non stick baking spray frist.

The cupcakes tasted great, but they were very hard to pull away from the paper.  Very messy to eat.  I added one more Tbs. of butter and I used dark chocolate cocoa powder.  I had to bake them longer than indicated.  Filling the cups 3/4 full made them spill out.  They also were flat and sunken in the middle.

Used a reviewers advise and melted butter instead of creaming. Cupcakes were hard to remove from greased muffin pan. Not very flavorful, and added frosting to save them. The next day it was a hockey puck.

These cupcakes had a good taste, but they were NOT moist.  My homemade icing is what made them OK.  I made them as written, baked them for 16 minutes and I used an oven thermometer, so I won't use this recipe again.

A good chocolatey cupcake but if you fill the tins too full they spill over and then they fall apart.  I made mini muffins with them and baked a little too long, however overall everyone loved them.

Just made these. I couldn't stop myself from licking the mixing bowl after they were in the oven! I usually have more self-control, but the flavor was incredibly chocolaty without being super-sweet (like found in most chocolate cupcakes). DELICIOUS! I thought these would be winners for sure...until they came out of the oven :( The incredible flavor was still there, but the texture was odd. Moist but a little clumpy. I followed other reviewers' advice and used half & half instead of milk, 3/4 teaspoons of baking soda, and 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder. BAD IDEA. Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly and hope for better results :) FYI, all was not lost! Still awesome with a tall glass of milk.

i made a few alterations: only used 1/8 tsp of baking soda, added 1 tsp of coffee instead of the vanilla extract since i did not have any more vanilla on hand, used only 1 cup of sugar, and made 12 large cupcakes. also, i did not frost them with any icing... they came out light tasting, with a good flavour, and relatively moist. but, i would have preferred them more fluffy and light, more sweet (next time i will try them with all of the recommended sugar) and  more moist. nevertheless, this is good recipe.

Cheers :)

Not as chocolatey as I was hoping for.  Would try to maybe add mini chocolate chips or pair with a fudgy frosting.  Good texture.

These cupcakes for some reason tasted too bitter to me, but my husband liked them. If I make them again I will throw in a little more sugar.

Totally disappointing, especially considering the mostly rave reviews. I cut the sugar from 1.5 cups to 1 cup but they wwere still way too sweet. I tasted the sugar far more than the chocolate. The texture was decent though still not as moist as other similar recipes. I made 20 cupcakes instead of 16 and they all domed nicely and pulled cleanly off the liner. I surprisingly prefer the vegan chocolate cupcake recipe from a popular vegan cupcake book (don't know if I can mention the name, search online for it). I don't think I will use this recipe again unless I'm feeling adventurous and reduce the sugar again by A LOT.

I've never made chocolate cupcakes, so I decided to try this recipe.  I will never look for another chocolate cupcake recipe again!  These were so moist and so chocolately!  I made my own buttercream frosting and added some cocoa to the recipe for the ultimate chocolate cupcakes.  We made 16 and in the last ten minutes, we've eaten 1/2 of them!  GREAT!

Just made these and they turned out pretty good. It did take longer to cook then the suggested time but other are good. I also cut up a snickers bar and put a chuck in some of the cupcakes and they turned out pretty good too.

These cupcakes were chocolaty and delicious! I have almost no experience with baking, but I found these easy to make. I iced them with cream cheese frosting, and put a raspberry on top, but they would have been great without it too. They were a big hit with everyone who tried, them, and I will definitely make them again!

This is a good recipe, but I agreed with some of the other reviewers on a few of the points, a) These could have been more chocolate-y, and b) They rose inconsistently. BUT these came out pretty good, and although I was mild on them, everyone who tried them loved them. I would make them again, but would try a frosting to go with them.

This was my first time making cupcakes and for some reason they didn't rise! Can anyone help me out? I followed the recipe exactly but yet... nothing... No high altitude or anything :( 
I haven't tried them yet (have to save them for a b-day party) but i'm sure there's nothing wrong with the taste - they just don't look that pretty

Thanks

Made these for my dad's birthday and they were perfect! Chocolatey and moist, just the way everyone in my family likes them. 

I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and got 18 standard cupcakes out of the basic recipe after filling each muffin cup 3/4 full. The dough rose to a slight dome.

I decorated the cakes with buttercream icing.

I found that even though the cake rose up very well, it was rather dense and dry. I think this recipe can do with a little more butter.

I think we need powdered sugar for this coz the butter did not cream well and the cake did not rise! Well, I guess it's common sense to use powdered sugar for cakes but I missed on that! Anyway, my disappointment did not last long coz these cakes were deliciousss! A very good recipe. Thanks!

This recipe isn't too bad. I used 3/4 cup of milk instead of the full cup, which may have been the reason that they didn't turn out quite as moist as I would have liked them to be. Also the chocolate was a bit too bitter for my liking, but they are still enjoyable none the less. I used an ice cream scoop to scoop the batter into the tins (it filled half way perfectly in everyone), which turned out to be the perfect amount for me, since the cupcakes rose a bit over the top. I think this is good recipe and would recommend it to others.

I thought these turned out great!! They're a wonderful light version, but you would never know! 
They're also very easy to make. 
I made a vanilla creme frosting to go on top. Tastes wonderful!!
Great for birthdays!

I had quite the adventure trying to make these. First I didn't have enough cocoa powder so i had to wait until my mom went shopping to get some more. Once I had the cocoa I mixed it all together and put it in the muffin cups it wasn't until I was done that I realized I forgot to put the eggs in, so back into the bowl everything went. Once the eggs were in and the mix was in the muffin cups again I realized that the pilot light in the oven was out, so my mom lights it and I try to preheat the oven. After 15 minuits the oven still wasn't warm and after some playing around with it we realize that the only way for the oven to heat up at all is to turn it on all the way so we baked the cupcakes by alternating the oven on at full blast and off. eventually they cooked and although they wern't quite right they wern't bad next time i hope that they'll work out properly.

actually surprised by this recipe. very good. followed it exactly. except i forgot to add the vanilla extract. nontheless it was awesome. when i took em out fo the oven i placed a piece of chocolate on top and it melted deliciously. this recipe made me 36 cupcakes. hmm.... thats a lot. i think its cause my trays are small. or i only filled the cups 1/2 way. very very very good cupcakes. i made them again today, this time without the cocoa because a friend of mine is allergic. they care even better, but might cut back on the sugar, it was quite sweet. thanks for sharing the recipe

Easy to make. I used only 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2. I don't know what the difference was but the cake was divine.  I added on the 'best white icing ever' recipe ontop. With a glace cherry atop each cup cake. My 3 year old (who helped me) and other siblings loved it!

These are actually really yummy for how low fat they are.  I used cake flour and it made them just melt in your mouth.

easy-to-make cupcakes!  I made them plain and used raisins instead and added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg powder.  They were awesome!

These are good if you like a very rich chocolate cake.  A little heavy for my taste - I will try a devil's food recipe next time.

I have never been too fond of cupcakes. But because I had a craving for cake late one night. I decided to give this recipe a try. 
These cupcakes were good, moist, and satisfying. Do top with your favourite icing, as it wouldn't be quite the same if you don't.

ok, this was good, but i felt like the chocolate flavor was lacking.  i used special dark chocolate cocoa for a more "chocolate-y" flavor, but i guess it just wasn't enough.  i won't make this again unless i can find a way to make it more chocolate-y.

These cupcakes were pretty good.  Not real sweet though.  With frosting on them though, they were pretty good.

I admit that I indulged in an few grams of substitution. But the overall product was undesirably bitter. I'll have to try this one again though, to get a full idea of its glory.

This was the first time I have made a cake from scratch rather then the traditional boxed cake mix. I don't particularly care for cake and frosting, its usually just too sweet for me. I followed the recipe exactly, but I made one small addition….I added about three “pie filling” cherries to the center of each cupcake then covered with batter. I was hoping they would be similar to a Black Forest cake. The flavor was more like a dark chocolate then a sweet chocolate, which is great, but the texture was very dry for me as well. Not sure why this happened. I am definitely going to make again and decrease the cooking time maybe…? Lastly, does anyone have any suggestions for a “not too sweet” topping for these cupcakes? THANKS

Yum! These cupcakes are definitely more dark chocolate tasting rather than the conventional sweet cupcake taste. I guess it depends on the cocoa you use. The cocoa I used was a combo of Dutch process and natural cocoa. I didn't make these with frosting, just sprinkled some powdered sugar on top. Everyone said they loved them without frosting.
