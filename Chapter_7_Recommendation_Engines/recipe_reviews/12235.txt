Okay, here's the deal.  One of the best, most simple raspberry pie recipes I've come across.  A couple of things to share with you. First, I've read about "watery" pies. One thing that contributes to that, would be the ripeness of the raspberries (more moisture). Another thing, would be the amount of water that might be left upon washing them.  If they are not thoroughly dry, that moisture (along with additional water used in the recipe), might make for a more "watery" pie.  I used 4 tabelspoons of water (instead of 6) because my berries were still wet from washing. I also added an additional tablespoon of tapioca. As far as tartness, that I've seen people mentione...again, it's the ripeness of the berries and it's hard to tell if you're buying them in the store and can't taste them.  So try a berry before making the pie at home.  If it's too tart for your liking, add more sugar than the recipe requires.  I added an additional 1/4 cup (total 1-1/2 cups).  I also brushed the crust with egg white ~ yummm....a perfectly golden crust!  This was awesome ~ the whole pie gone in two days (with just two people ~ yikes!)

This pie was a big hit!! Ate while still hot in the middle, and not at all runny. I followed the directions pretty close. I used 2 bags of thawed raspberries and thawed deep dish double crust pie shells. I used 2 heeping Tbl sp of the tapioca and mixed it with 4 Tbl sp of the juice from the berries. Drainded the berries and added to the tapioca. I mixed 1 and 1/8 C sugar with the corn startch and cut in the butter until crumbly. Gradually folded in with the berries and poured into a the bottom pie plate that I already prepped in the oven for a few min. Put the other crust on top cut out some holes and brushed with egg whites. I poured some of the remaining sugar over the crust and stuck it in the oven. Cook time was great followed to the second. Will make this pie again and again. No mess no hassle. Keeper!!

I have been baking for 33 years and on numerous occassions have sold my baking at Christmas and other special events.  I have NEVER heard of adding water to a fruit pie, but I thought I should follow the recipe as others rated it very high. Made this last night with fresh raspberries and it turned out to be a soupy mess!  Husband and the kids ate it but I couldn't.  Don't know if I'll make again or not.

I made this pie last night for my husbands' birthday--and he really loved it. I thought it tasted a little like jam, but it was still pretty good. The only thing was that I used frozen raspberries, completely thawed and drained and there was A LOT of water. I didn't add any (the recipe calls for 6 tablespoons) and it was still a tad runny. So remember that if you make this with frozen raspberries!

I liked this recipe because the pie was not runny at all. I made a raspberry pie the week before with flour instead of the cornstarch and tapioca and it was very runny which make the crust soggy.
This one was very good with the berries staying in the pie and the crust stayed crisp.

This is my go-to pie. I am an avid pie baker, and this pie by far receives the most compliments. Personally I enjoy the tart yet still sweet flavor of this pie, and my recipients have complimented me on it as well. Its sweet, yet still retains the natural tartness from the raspberries, without being too tart or overly sweet.  I have made this pie several times, using both frozen, fresh or 50/50 fresh/frozen raspberries. Never have I had a pie turn out runny or even juicy. My favorite way to eat this pie is cold out of the fridge, perfect for a summer day when berries are ripe and the temps are high! If you like raspberries or pie (or if you're like me and LOVE both) then this is the best recipe to use! 

Its very important if you are experiencing a runny pie, that there are adequate slits for steam to escape. I prefer a lattice top, as it hides imperfections in your crust, and is less likely to break, as well as lets l plenty of steam escape.

Furthermore its importants to let the raspberry, tapioca, cornstarch, sugar mix sit for a bit. I make my crust during this time, so my raspberries usually sit for 30-45 min. I also use less butter. 4 tablespoons is a bit much for my liking, so I usually use around 2 and dice the butter up and spread onto the top crust. It will give the crust a nice color, and the excess with drip into berries while baking.

Very nice pie.  I added a bit of lemon zest to the filling to bring out the raspberry flavour and brushed the top with milk and sprinkled it with sugar. Came out beautifully.  Make sure you leave it to rest and cool completely before cutting, as it will be runny as other reviewers have mentioned.

This was sooo good!  My berries were tart, so I added an extra 1/4 cup sugar.  Used frozen pie crusts, but it was still so fresh and wonderful tasting.  My husband said to throw all other recipes out and only use this one!

Very tasty recipe, but next time, I'll add less sugar and more cornstarch.  Tasted like jam, almost, sooo good, but a little runny.  Thanks for the recipe!

i couldn't find my grandmother's recipe for black raspberry pie, but i wanted to make some, so i went ahead and tried this because it was similar.  i used 3 cups of berries instead of 4 (they barely fit, 4 would have overflowed for sure), used UNTHAWED frozen berries because you can't get fresh black raspberries here, used only 3/4 cup sugar, did not use water, used full amount of thickening agents for the reduced amount of berries, otherwise they would have had to increase.  i made my grandmother's pie crust, which is amazing.  you really need a scratch crust for this, that store bought stuff doesn't compare and your pie won't be anything special using it.  i used a milk wash, then sprinkled sugar on top.  i tried the two temp baking method, but did 10 minutes and 40 minutes, for perfect golden doneness.  adding water and too little thickening ingredients are why people are getting soupy pies.  i cut mine open hot from the oven, because i'm impatient like that, and the filling stayed in my pie piece perfectly.  also, for people saying they thought the filling turned out like jam, try using frozen berries as well as less sugar.  my berries stayed whole and the pie was nice and tart.  i think my changes make a 5-star pie easily, but as written, 3-4.

I made this pie as written except that I only used two tablespoons of water and the pie was still too runny. I let it set for 8 hours before cutting which should have been more than enough. The filling also tasted a bit too tart for my taste although that may have been the fault of the raspberries (I used fresh). I may try making it again using no water at all.

I used raspberries that I had frozen over the summer.  I thawed them, mixed with the cornstarch, sugar, and tapioca, and poured it into the crust. I didn't add any water.  It was the perfect consistency and tartness.  Thanks!

First time making a Black Raspberry pie and will NOT be the last!  This recipe was EASY and so good!  I did rinse my berries, and only used 5 TB of water, and I did let the fruit mixture sit for about 25 minutes before adding to pie shell and it set up beautifully.  I preferred a crumb topping, so I cut some cold butter into equal amounts sugar and flour and sprinkled a fairly thick coating on the top.  It created a slightly crisp, sweet layer that is just perfect.  The only changes I made were omitting the one TB of water and I didn't add butter to the filling. I also used a deep dish pie plate and had NO messy boilover problems!  This went right into my written recipe book!  THANK YOU!

LOVED this recipe!! It was the first fruit pie I ever made, and it turned out delicious!  I used the "Best ever Pie Crust" recipe (my second time....still working on it), and it really turned out great!  I used fresh raspberries, and Splenda instead of sugar (only one cup).  I didn't need the extra water, I just rinsed the raspberries with water, and the mixture seemed wet enough.  No runny pie! I even forgot the butter accidently, and it still was fantastic.  Will definitely use this recipe again and again!!

Finally!  A berry pie that doesn't run all over the place when cut. I was a bit worried when I took the pie out of the oven because it was very loose and jiggly but after cooling overnight it was perfect the next day. Made them for a church dinner and not a piece was left over.  I did change the cook time - 1 hour and 15 mintues at 350

Great recipe. I used frozen raspberries from our bushes from last summer. They were still mostly frozen so I omitted the water. I added a little more sugar though, personal preference. It disappeared quickly!

Very good, though I did make a few changes based on other reviews.  I used thawed frozen black raspberries (didn't drain the berry juices), no water, 4 T. cornstarch and 8 tsp. tapioca (8 tsp. = 2 T. and 2 tsp.).  I had no issues with the pie being too runny.

Made this pie with a few changes:  I marinated my raspberries with 1/3 c sugar and 2TB cherry liquor for an hour before stirring in the balance of the sugar.  I did not add in the water, but I did add in the liquor marinated juices.  Also added in a 1/2 TB more tapioca.  Came out a tad runny, but not worth complaining about!  Tasted fantastic.  I will make again.

This is an awesome recipe that I have used with blueberries, raspberries and blackberries.  Just line the bottom of your oven with foil to catch the juice that will spill if you do a lattice top.  Cover pie loosely with foil at the 15 minute mark to keep the top from getting too dark.  It will still brown and you have to turn the temp. down at this time anyway.

I agree with others..next time I will not add water. A bit sweet for me but otherwise tasty. I will make again with 1 cup of sugar...Update..perfect as recipe states after 8 hours.

This pie is wonderful! The only change I made was to cut the water to 4 tbs, since I was worried about the filling being runny. It set up beautifully with no "glommy" taste from too much thickener. Thanks, Susan!

I just finished eating a portion of this pie--would like to call it a slice, but considering that I had to eat it with a spoon...

I had high hopes for this pie.  I read the reviews and was worried about it being runny.  I used dry, fresh raspberries, added one extra tablespoon of tapioca, added and extra 1/4 cup of sugar, and used 5 tablespoons of water.  It still turned out runny!  The flavor is nice, but the consistency ruins it, unfortunately.  If I make this pie again, I would consider not adding any water at all.  

Hopes this helps.

My husband discovered some black raspberries in the woods across from where we live.  He picked them and brought them to me to make a pie.  I looked through all my cookbooks, my grandmother's handwritten receipes and found nothing.  Of course, my grandmother's generation used "a pinch of this and a pinch of that" and I remember her pies and how good they were hoping to make one as good.    I decided to look at allreceipes.com and came to this receipe.  I was skeptical, but tried it.  I am happy that this receipe turned out so well.  I do believe you have to use your own "cooking experience" and make it yours.  But, thank you and I will use this receipe again.  Never get discouraged...... experiment and have fun with it!  My husband rated it a "10"!

Great recipe!! If possible make a few hours before you need it. It sets up nicely when completey cooled. Everyone loves this pie. I used no water and 2 tablespoons of tapioca pudding instead of instant tapioca.  Enjoy!!

My elderly neighbor made this and brought us some last evening insisting that we try it and it was FANTASTIC!! I asked her if she changed the recipe at all and she mentioned that she only used just under a cup of sugar because the berries were particularly sweet.  Five Stars!

I've used this recipe twie now and love it.  My husband loves it too.  It was also my first pie and I was looking for simplicity.  I have found, though, that to keep it from being runny, let it cool completely.  of course, there's nothing like having it fresh from the oven, but after we put it in the fridge and have leftovers, it has definately solidified.  Good both ways, but hot, be prepared to chase the filling.  Very yummy!

So good! I have raspberry bushes in my yard and I've made three of these pies this summer. This pie is a huge hit with everyone who's tried it. I followed the recipe exactly. The pie comes out of the oven soupy, but if you let it cool, it firms up to perfection in about half an hour.

This would probably be excellent with fresh raspberries, but it ended up being like a raspberry jam pie when I made it with my frozen raspberries.

This turned out great. Instead of using a crust topping, I did a crumble topping.   I didn't find it too runny (and I used raspberries from the same batch where my jam didn't set).   However, I did have filling run out of my pie when filled. Next time, I'll use less berries or a deep dish crust.

LOVED this recipe. I made it after getting a ton of raspberries and blackberries at a u-pick farm. I usually don't buy raspberries because I never know that to do with them.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, which I thought added a nice depth to the flavor, but forgot the butter. Never mind; I will buy many raspberries from now on to make this wonderful pie!

Made this with 5 cups black raspberries from the garden and substituted black currant juice (also from the garden) for the water.  It made a superb pie.  Consistency was perfect; the combination of flavors sublime.

This pie is great. I will agree that adding water is not necessary if you rinse the raspberries thoroughly. Raspberries are like little thimbles. They hold water like a cup. I like that this pie stands up when you cut into it. I dont like the contents to spill out when you scoop it. Solid recipe.

Loved it! I used fresh black raspberries from my garden. I made one and a half times the called for filling amount to accommodate a deep dish pie pan. I did omit the water, because my berries were very ripe and juicy, but made no changes to the recipe and this was perfect in both flavor and texture, and not runny at all. Perfect.

First raspberry pie made by my 11 yr old with minimal help and it was awesome. Used a  deep dish double pie crust from the freezer section. Followed the most helpful review by adding more sugar to my tart wild black raspberries, and an extra tablespoon of tapioca to thicken. Layed the top pie crust flat on the back of a baking sheet and used a pizza cutter to slice the crust into 1/2" strips to make the lattice top. Googled how to make the lattice top, SO EASY. Used an egg white to wipe down the lattice crust to give it a sheen and it looked and tasted magnifico. My daughter was impressed with herself as was everyone else.

The filling turned out perfect. As stated before you have to base the water on whether or not you have just washed the berries. My filling set perfectly with no runny mess. I didn't have tapioca and used flour in place. Turned out fine. My daughters want only this raspberry pie now.

Simple recipe, great results. Based on the reviews I used frozen berries (unthawed), omitted the water, and used a little less sugar (heaping cup). Baking time was right on!

With all the great reviews I took a chance and made it for my family reunion without a test run. I did add a teaspoon of lemon zest and that did the trick to keep it from being too sweet. It was a hit!

The pie was absolutely not runny. It held together even though I cut it while it was still hot (which I normally do not do). It is so important to let the filling sit for at least twenty minutes to allow the juices to come out of the berries and to allow the tapioca and corn starch to do their absorbing and thickening. I followed this recipe exactly and for my taste it was overly sweet. I would cut the sugar to no more than 1 cup next time I make this. Aside from reducing the sugar, this is an excellent recipe and I would certainly make it again.

Raspberries are my favorite fruit, but I never had a raspberry pie that I really liked until I made this recipe. I've made it a few times and it has never turned out soupy or runny. My parents aren't big pie fans, but they request this pie at nearly every family get-together. I do a lattice crust, brushed with an egg white and sprinkled with raw sugar. The pie is sweet, but you also get the tartness of the raspberries. I also like to top my slice with whipped cream. I'm actually preparing to make this pie right now for my dad, who requested it for his belated Father's Day cookout. Thanks for the recipe, you have me and my family hooked!

This was a pretty good, simple pie.  I made it with a scratch flaky crust and it was great.

I have made this pie MANY times and it always turns out delicious. The first year I made this, I took it to a Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it and raved about it. Now, I am begged to bring this pie every year.

Amazing! I made this for my fiancee and he loved it! We like it a little tart, so I didn't use as much sugar -- just over one cup. I also used 2 packages of frozen raspberries, and halved the amount of water I put in. I let it sit for a little bit and it was incredible! Not runny at all!

The family gave this rave reviews. Really good recipe! I strongly feel you don't need to add ANY water if you just rinse the raspberries and then mix them with the other items. Am I the only one who had too much filling? I couldn't use it all. A recommendation: cook the pie on a cookie sheet lined with foil - if any pie filling comes out, you've saved yourself from a huge mess.

Oh my, yes! Simply delicious and easy to make, especially since I use refrigerated pie crusts (never mastered it).  Tastes like grandma's pie that sat in the windowsill to cool.

This was my first fresh berry pie and it was fabulous. Maybe because I picked the berries myself:) *Note to all the virgin pie makers - put a pan under the pie to catch the juices that will spill out during cooking - or put a piece of foil under the pie.* I didn't dry the raspberries after washing and I added water so it was pretty runny in the baking process. It was great after it cooled for 12 hours. Yum!

I love to cook but pies have been my least favorite thing to make.  This recipe made with our fresh raspberries and the phenomenal crust recipe Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust found on Allrecipes have given me a new confidence in pie making.  This pie thickens up so nicely.  Give it a try and I hope you'll agree!

This pie was absolutely fantastic! I had to substitute fresh blackberries for raspberries because the grocery stores were out of fresh raspberries. My fiance loves pies and he said this one is a definite winner. I agree - I love anything with berries. GREAT with vanilla ice cream. Delish!

Excellent and delicious. I couldn't find raspberries in quarts, so I bought 3 pints. I also forgot to put the butter between the raspberries and crust, but it was soo delicious anyways.

This was the best black raspberry pie I or anyone eating it has ever tasted!! I used the basic flaky pie crust recipie (doubled) from this site and it came out flaky and delicious. I brushed the top with egg white and sprinkled it with sugar, which made it  gorgeous. I only had tapioca flour, so I used 3 TB of it and 2 TB of corn starch. I also added about a half teaspoon of cinnamon. This recipe is forgiving, too, because I forgot to turn the oven down from 425 degrees. Altogether, AMAZING!!!

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  A nice change from apple or cherry.  I used fresh raspberries and added maybe a tad more tapicoca, came out perfect.  Let sit for a while before serving and add some ice cream on the side- YUM!

Extremely tasty! The first pie I have ever made on my own, and I think it came out pretty darn good.  I used 2 packages frozen raspberries (10oz  each maybe?) instead of the fresh because it is January afterall.  The pie filling does seem a little runnier than I would like, but I have popped it in the fridge so hopefully it will harden up a bit. Really not a problem though if it doesn't.  I also used the double pie crust recipe that is on this site and it is wonderful!

I fixed two of these pies for Thanksgiving to use up some of my berries.  It was fantastic!!!!  I used a bigger pie pan so I had to use 1 1/2 times the berries to fill the pan, but it was GREAT!!  Glad I found this recipe, THANKS!!!!

Excellent recipe.  I live near a big patch of uncultivated black raspberries, which I don't think are as sweet as commercially grown berries, but they are abundant and I like to use them when I can.

I overfilled the pie (which I didn't know you could do). Also I left the top crust out for too long before hand so it was difficult to work with. Totally understand why lattice crusts are a thing! Tasted okay, definitely needed ice cream in my opinion but my bf enjoyed the pie without it.

Very yummy! We went raspberry picking, and I had a bunch I needed to use quickly before they got squishy. Based on the other reviews, I used an extra 1/4 cup sugar (so, 1.5 cups total) and cut the water added to 4 tbsp. It was perfect.

I was glad to find a recipe like the one my mom made, I did add (and subtract) some ingredients.  If you think you'd like to use less sugar, don't use LESS than 1 c. since raspberries can be tart.  I didn't add the water (why dilute the yumminess?) which meant I didn't need as much flour - works just as well as cornstarch.  Finally, I added 2 T. of cinnamon and 1 T. of lemon juice.  I hope this helps.

The flavor was great but something went terribly wrong where the inside was just raspberry soup.

I've made this recipe twice with raspberries from my backyard, each time it was fantastic.  Definitely a keeper!

It was too runny, and too much filling for a store bought deep dish crust, messed up my oven. The only things u changed was using only 2 tablespoons of water (juicy berries), and I added an extra teaspoon of cornstarch and an extra tablespoon of tapioca ( to compensate for my extra juicy luscious berries). I cut the sugar to 1 cup and it was still way too sweet, sorry, but I won't do this one again

The only thing I changed was that I used only half of what was called for for butter.  I used my own pie crust recipe... times were perfect.  The first thing you notice when you take it out of the oven is the wonderful aroma of cooked raspberries!  After it cooled, we had it with a tiny bit of ice cream.  It was awesome!

I followed the instructions exactly, except I used frozen berries and increased the berries to 6 cups. My pies have been received with only compliments by friends and relatives alike. Also I only used 4 tablespoons of water. Turned out perfect. A very good recipe.

I loved this pie! My kids weren't big fans of it because it is quite tart and has seeds. I served it with vanilla ice cream and thought it was delicious - and a great way to use up the raspberries from the garden! I would definitely scale back the water when using fresh raspberries (or eliminate it if the berries are very ripe and getting mushy), and eliminate the water completely when using frozen/thawed/drained berries. I also added an extra TBSP of tapioca which helped thicken it up.

I have used this exact recipe for many, many pies.  I just made 6 of them and put in the freezer unbaked!  Wonderful, perfect every time.  Bake frozen pie at 400' for 30 minutes, drop temp to 350 and bake 35-45 minutes.  I put pie on cookie sheet with foil to catch spills.  Let cool completely.  Perfect every time.

Good, but not great. A good way to use up surplus raspberries from the garden but overall was soggy and lackluster.

I've used this recipe three times so far and with great success. I made the first with red raspberries and the next two with black raspberries. All were delicious and much enjoyed by those I shared them with.  The only change I made was to reduce the butter to 2 tablespoons. One more thing: don't be afraid to use the 6 tablespoons water. The thickening works. I think it probably is important to let the mixture sit for about 30 minutes before adding it to the pie shell and baking.

My boyfriend brought me three quarts of black raspberries that he picked from his yard. I made two pies off this site and this was the better of the two. When I made the filling it seemed rather skimpy so I added another 50%. The biggest problem was when I baked it and it overflowed. I added much less water and ground the tapioca to a fine powder. Within hours the pie was ready to slice and serve and was not the slight bit runny. The pieces held together perfectly and the flavor was good. Thank you.

Very, very tart pie.  I made with fresh raspberries, and followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the water.  I still had to eat each piece with ice cream to cut the tartness.  Also, you must let the pie set for at least 6 hours before cutting, otherwise it will be a watery mess.  I do not think I will make again.

This is so tasty.  Made the recipe using blueberries and it was also great.  No matter how juicy the berries are, the tapioca and cornstarch thickens just right.

This is delicious.  Many think you can't make a pie out of raspberries, too seedy.  But I had so many raspberries from the garden and didn't need and more jam or raspberry vinegar and tried this recipe.  We all loved it.

Great recipe!!I usually make berry cobblers but since I tried this recipe,I'll be making this pie. Make sure you let it cool completely before cutting. I have tried it with and without the butter, both ways taste great. Always taste test your berries.I agree with the other comments that the amount of sugar depends on the berries. If your berries are tart add a bit more but if your berries are sweet a little less. Overall this is a great recipe!!

Great recipe!   I made this pie yesterday and we have already devoured the pie.  When I took the pie out of the oven it was a bit runny, but after sitting for an hour it thicken right up.  Excellent with vanilla ice cream.

This is the first pie I've ever made and I chose this recipe because it seemed very easy and I knew I was going to be struggling enough with the pie crust.  In that way it did not disappoint me.  It took just a few minutes to prepare.  But, though it tasted good enough, I didn't find it to be anything special.
