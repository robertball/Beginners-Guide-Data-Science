After taking a while to review all of the carrot cake recipes on this site and others, I finally decided on this one but made a few adjustments that made the cake come out absolutely perfect.  I would give the one I ended up making 5+ stars, but since I had to change this recipe a little I only gave this recipe a 4.  Anyway, to change it, I added 1 tsp of baking powder in addition to the 1 tsp baking soda (so many other recipes called for both).  I cut down the oil to 1 cup and it was still wonderfully moist.  I used a 1-pound bag of carrots to grate and it was roughly the 3 cups that was suggested and I omitted the walnuts (I don't care for nuts in cakes as they take away from the moist texture, in my opinion).  I baked it in two 9-inch round pans at 325 in my convection oven for only 35 minutes and they came out perfect.  If using convection I wouldn't go any more than 35 minutes before checking it.  And I used the cream cheese frosting II recipe on this website vs. the one in this recipe because I thought that it was way too much sugar as opposed to cream cheese.  One more thing that I think made mine really yummy-- I used Pampered Chef's Korintje Cinnamon spice for the 2 tsp cinnamon and it gave it such a true cinnamon taste.  Edited 10 years later:  This, with the above modifications, is still my favorite and most-requested cake to make.  I make it every year for Easter and birthday's and it's everyone's favorite.  Great in cupcake form, too!

This was good, but there are some serious changes that need to be made to rate it as five stars. First, you must add 2 tsp. of baking powder. Second, 1 1/2 c. of oil is too much, even for a southern cook. You could easily cut out 1/4 or 1/2 c. of oil and still have an incredibly moist cake. I cannot comment on the frosting, since I used cream cheese frosting II from this site instead. With these changes, this recipe is probably five stars. Tip: 1 lb. of carrots equals about 3 c. shredded. Also, I liked this as a layer cake. Next time, I will probably make three layers, rather than two.

With all the great reviews, I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. I was surprised the recipe did not call for baking powder, but prepared it exactly as written anyway. It seems I was correct, because the cake was too heavy and flat. The flavor was very good, so I WILL be trying this again, but adding at least a tablespoon of baking powder. As a sidenote, I followed other reviewers advice, and made the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe. It was EXCELLENT, and I gave it five stars!!

Incredible!  I made this for my best friend's birthday because carrot cake is her favorite.  I substituded the 2 cups of cane sugar for 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups of cane and added a tsp of nutmeg.  I used a 9x13 glass pan.  I also used a thicker cream cheese frosting that I had seen on this site.  Turned out marvalous.  She loved it and so did my other co workers, there was hardly any left for her to take home.  This was the first from scratch cake I have ever made.  Will definatly be making this again.  It was just so easy.

Pretty darned tasty! I used maybe ½ tsp cinnamon (allergies in the house) and I added a few shakes of nutmeg to make up for it. I also used only 1 cup of oil. I used more like 3-½ cups of carrots; and, as suggested by other reviewers, I used Cream Cheese Frosting II. It was fabulous and moist and gone in two days! Oh, and it took around 45 minutes at 350 for a 9x13 pan. Thanks for sharing, Autumn/Fall!

I made this cake for a birthday at work and EVERYONE loved it.  It was moist and delicious!  I added raisins and pecans (two people at work are allergic to walnuts).  I baked the cake in two 9 inch rounds which drastically cut down on the cooking time.  The cakes were done in 35-40 minutes not the hour 20 stated in the recipe but I did not use a bundt pan.  I would definetely make again.  Double the frosting recipe to frost a layer cake.

This is an excellent carrot cake!  Dense, moist, and flavorful.  Hubby raved about it 'til the end.  I reduced the oil by 1/2 a cup, added 1/2 cup of natural applesauce, and omitted the walnuts, as neither of us like them.  I used my Ninja to make the carrot really small (personal preference) instead of just grating.  I opted to cook in a 9x13 pan at 340 for an hour.  Next time I might add more cinnamon, but that's mostly because I like cinnamon and also to play with recipes, lol.

The frosting is another story.  I made the recipe version and quickly realized I'd just made a yummy glaze (probably great on a bundt/tube cake), but not a frosting, so I started over with the Cream Cheese II Frosting (minus 1 cup sugar), which was much better, especially when storing the whole thing in the 'fridge, which is how we like carrot cake.

This recipe was a standard Carrot Cake Recipe. I added one extra teaspoon Cinammon and a teaspoon nutmeg to give it more spice. The only Thing is I think it wasn't "Carroty" enough. Maybe some Carrot Baby food would give it that extra oomph, like other recipes have you do. All in all though not a bad recipe.

This was the most awesome carrot cake ever - I took it to a party and it was consumed in no time. My warning to you all is to be careful NOT to use low-fat cream when making the cream cheese frosting - low-fat cream DOESNT WHIP and so will give you a runny mess... read the cream package carefully ;)

I was surprised, that with all the seemingly positive reviews, I had to change so much of the recipe in order to get a decent cake... What I ended up with was a five-star cake, but as there were so many changes I had to make, I could not call this a five-star recipe.

This is my first attempt at carrot cake. I did cut down the oil by 1/2cup and replaced with applesauce. Was one of the best carrot cakes I have ever had. Great recipe.I need look no further for another recipe.This is the carrot cake I will always bake. Use the cream Cheese Frosting resipe by Janni. It takes it to a whole new level of yum.

Very good cake although I changed some things: Used whole grain flour (to feel less guilty), 2 teaspoons of baking soda instead of one, no vegetable oil (disgusting), 1 cup of butter and 1 teaspoon nutmeg. It came out DELICIOUS!

I wish I could give it more stars... I made a couple of changes.  Only used 1 cup of vegetable oil, added 1 tsp of baking powder and took OUT the walnuts. (yuck).  As for the frosting I used a recipe on here called Cream Cheese Frosting II... it turned out amazing!!!!  I brought it to work the next day and my co-workers see me as some Betty Crocker of sorts... I told them that I'm kind of a big deal around here. hahahahaha. JK.

Moist and delicious!  My whole family loved it.  My son wanted it for breakfast the next morning.  Next time, I will try to cut the vegetable oil with apple sauce.  The frosting was excellent as well.  It was the first time I use heavy whipping cream and it gave the frosting a smooth texture.

Filling cake, good consistancy.  Remember to coat the walnuts and carrots lightly with flour to prevent sinking.

I substituted Enova oil for the vegetable oil and Splenda for the sugar, making the cake a bit more "diet-friendly." Very moist. I'll make this again!

I have never understood the purpose of carrot cake opposed to just your basic cinnamon based cake so I decided to make it for myself to see if there really is a difference. This was my first time makin carrot cake. Well, there is no difference. Carrots add absolutely zilch to a cake except make it healthier, but flavor and texture wise they're a pretty useless addition. Anyhow, everything came otu really good. Tastes just like a cinnabun! This is the best frostign I have ever had in my life too! I did make some changes by decreasign soem fo the ingredients because I coudl tell before I even made this that many of the amounts were unnecessary. Instead of 2 cups sugar I used 1 1/2 (since the frostign is so sweat). I used no salt. Used 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda as I have found w/ all baked goods recipes to add at least a half teaspoon more then called for as it makes a huge difference in how moist the item in question is. I used 3 instead of 4 eggs and only used egg whites (as always). And for the frosting only needed 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar as a half cup more would had been unbearably sweet. Insead of using a tube pan or 9 pans I simply used a large casserole dish and it came out great and cooked in less then an hour. Came out super moist and flavorful.

I would give this 10 stars if I could! It was a huge hit! In order to make it more carrot-y, I add about a cup more carrots and it really helped in making it moist.

I made this almost as written. I did exchange 1/2 the oil with applesauce, (Had to use regular as out of unsweetened, made no difference.) This was amazingly good. I made the frosting with half and half instead of the heavy whipping cream and it was fabulous too. It seemed to make a lot more than the cake really needed, but was oh so good to catch the drips. The only thing different I'll do is add an additional cup of carrots because we really like a lot of carrots.

Made this for my boyfriend's 30th birthday (who, by the way, is an absolute carrot cake obsessivo!) and he can honestly say it is the best carrot cake he has eaten.  I have since made it for my family and my sister (also a carrot cake lover) says it's the best she's ever tried.  It's true that the words "so moist" and "delicious" keep on coming up when people try to describe it. I simply used the store-bought pillsbury cream cheese icing.  I will never use a different carrot cake recipe when trying to impress family or friends! Yummmmmmmmm!!

A first for me. I was pleased with how it turned out. A little surprised, though, at the amount of oil in the recipe. I love it and will make it again, but I'll try changing it up to make it a more healthy recipe.

Very moist cake - would recommend.  I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp allspice as I like a bit more spice in my carrot cake.

This cake was pretty tasty overall but I would definitely not cook it the 1 hr 20 minutes - I might say shorten it a bit.  I've also read some other reviews and noticed some nice suggestions to better improve the recipe.  I also probably would not put 1 cup of chopped walnuts but maybe 3/4 cup but that's my opinion.

I wanted to surprise my friend with her favorite cake and boy did I do just that! It was a great recipe, but I followed the advice of a couple other chefs here and cut the oil to 1 cup and added 1 tsp of baking powder. Since I like my cake with a little spice, I added an extra tsp of cinnamon and a dash of allspice. I also went with the Cream Cheese Frosting II, but I cut that recipe down significantly since our family doesn't like a lot of frosting; it ended up being light like cinnamon rolls and it was just the right amount. We also used whole wheat flour and organic sugar cane with the cake, and it turned out with just the right texture. Success!

I'd never made carrot cake before and this was super easy and delicious! I was a little freaked out when I saw how oily the batter looked, but I guess that's just how carrot cake batter looks because it turned out perfectly. I didn't want to mess with the recipe my first time around, so I did it exactly as written, but made cupcakes instead of a whole cake. The recipe made 2 dozen cupcakes which I baked at 350 for 30 minutes. I served them up to my book club that evening and they devoured them all, while giving me lots of compliments on them.  (I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe on this site by Janni which was delicious, but made so much frosting that I had enough left over to make another cake or set of cupcakes! Gonna do that tonight! Yum yum yum!)

UPDATE: To use up the rest of the frosting, I made a cake tonight in a bundt (tube) pan. I changed it up this time though, just for fun. I did 3/4 c. oil and 3/4 c. applesauce; added 1 tsp. nutmeg and a tiny bit of ginger; and cut down on the walnuts a little bit while adding about 1 cup of raisins. It had to bake the full 1 hour 20 minutes like the recipe says. It turned out just as yummy as the first time I made it! Seems like you can't mess this one up!

Lovely cake. I made it with pecans instead of walnuts and halved the recipe to make one 9inch round cake. Topped it with cream cheese frosting II. nice and moist. Didn't find it too heavy or light.

This cake was very flavorful, very moist and very good! It kept for a loong time in the fridge and was even wonderful for breakfast. I didn't bake it for quite as long as instructed. I also added a little sour cream to the frosting recipe. Will definitely make again.

I was very pleased with this cake, moist inside and cruncy outside. I found the creamcheese icing too sweet - next time I would use half the sugar to make it taste more "cream cheesy".

I made this exactly as the directions indicated.  Its delicious.  Plenty sweet, even for my overactive sweet tooth.  The trouble is (and the reason for the three star rating) that I cannot get the cake layers out of the pan.  I made it in the nine inch round pans and baked as indicated for 40 minutes.  I tried to depan the first layer right away -- no luck.  I let the second layer sit for 15 minutes thinking maybe it needed to cool a bit before depanning. Still no luck.  Both layers came out in chunks and pieces.  I greased the pans generously with standard solid crisco, so I can't figure out what went wrong.  It IS tasty, though!

Came out very well using our 10 inch tube pan and baking approx. 50 minutes. (After 40 minutes, it appeared done, but when I cut a slice, it was not; it looked baked but still smelled like batter. After heating the oven again, and then cooking 10 more minutes, it was perfect.)  Moist and enjoyable cake.  (Note:  I didn't make the frosting.  Used approx. 5 large grated carrots.)

One of my best friends, and my husband, both have birthdays in February and they both love carrot cake.
Somehow I lost the recipe I have used for years and decided to look on All Recipes to see what I could find. They both wanted it kept simple and no nuts...this cake was very moist and flavorful. I did however, add a tsp. of baking powder suggested by others and a 1/4 tsp. Allspice. ( I did not use the frosting recipe listed with the recipe. )

I followed the suggestions below the recipe and came up with a fabulous carrot cake. less oil,baking powder, and baking soda, and lots more spices. Ginger,nutmeg, allspice, and ground cloves, added so much to the flavor.  The original recipe was a nice base, and thanks so much for the helpful reviews.

I made this cake for my mothers 65th birthday/ Easter dinner. It turned out moist and delicious. I used cream cheese frosting II because so many people suggested it. Very good! I also love this recipe because you can add almost anything. I added ripe apples and figs along with the carrots. I also added nutmeg. Follow the suggestions they helped a lot but otherwise this cake was easy and sooo good!

This cake was perfect!  Very moist and simple.  I don't really like pineapple and coconut in my carrot cake - just carrots!  I baked it in a 9 x 13" pan at 340 degrees for about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Poured it in the pan, sprinkled 1/2 cup walnuts over 1/2 of the cake and mixed them in a bit (most of my family does not like nuts).  Perfect!
(I did use the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site like another person suggested.  Very good!!)

This cake was fantastically delicious!  I used less powdered sugar than the frosting part of the recipe called for, because I didn't want it to be too sickly sweet, and it turned out wonderful.

Everyone loved this cake.  The cake has a great flavor to it and the cream cheese icing isn't overpowering with the addition of the cream and vanilla.  I only made a few changes by substituting  butter for the oil and added an egg to keep it moist (I prefer butter in my cakes).

Not bad.  I quite liked this one.  I thought the frosting was far too sweet and hardly had any cream cheese taste to it, but I must admit, the cake itself cooked up perfectly and VERY moist.  Tasted good too.  I wish it told you how fine to grate the carrots, as I'm afraid I grated mine too fine as it was hard to taste.  BUT I will make adjustments on future tries.  My suggestion to you: Double the cream cheese on the frosting and taste as you mix to see if it's how you like.

I made this cake last night and it was so simple yet so good. I even made a mistake and put in a half a tablespoon of salt instead of a half a teaspoon of salt and it was still fine. I made one change--added half of the cinnamon and made the rest allspice. I also added golden raisins to half of the batch, and they were wonderful! Great recipe! I'd never made carrot cake before.

Very soft and fluffy! I followed some earlier reviews and add one banana as secret ingredient, used 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour and used only 1 and 1/2 cup sugar. I regret that one coz I did not find it too sweet. Will use the whole amount next time. And I thought the cake needed some more carrots. Maybe 3 1/2 to 4 cups? The walnuts gave it an awesome taste. I got a 9 inch cake and 12 muffins with this batter. Will definitely make this many times over inshaAllah. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful! I took the advice of using Cream Cheese frosting II - and it was so great.  I had co-workers telling me it was the best carrot cake they had ever had!  Making again this weekend.

I made this for my dad, who is a carrot cake freak. I added 1/2 cup of coconut & 1/2 cup of raisins & it came out really,really good. I have little ones, so I made a few cupcakes and they too came out really good. Would and will make again!

A somewhat dense carrot cake enhanced by the addition of walnuts.  It was dry on the top, so I may try a lower oven temp next time.  I used a different cream cheese frosting, but this is a good cake.

Initially it appeared to be too much shredded carrots, but it cooked up just fine. I made cupcakes instead of a cake and the edges were a little cruchy. Tasted great, the ingredents were perfect.

FABULOUS!  This was super moist, sweet and tasty.  I made it for my daughter's birthday and there wasn't a scrap left.  Skip their frosting though and make homemade cream cheese frosting.  The combination is heaven.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I didn't actually make the cake...I just made the icing.  I don't know if I just really like cream cheese but I had to add my entire 8-oz pkg. to make it taste good.  After that it was very good!

I have always loved carrot cake, but this is the single best and most moist recipe for it I have ever had.  I used 1/4  cup less of oil than called for, only because I ran out, but this worked so well--I'll just keep making it with that much less oil.  :)  Thank you--This is just wonderful.  :)

My first time making this. It turned out awesome and everyone raved over it. I didn't have a tube pan, so I used a cake pan and reduced the time about 10-15 min.  I will make this again.

Very good cake! It was my first carrot cake and everyone loved it for our Thanksgiving diner. I just added the 2tps baking powder and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup after reading the most helpful critical review. Also omitted the walnuts. Easy and delicious!

Added raisins, cut the oil to 1 cup and subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for the rest of the oil to reduce fat and since I had 4 cups of shredded carrots, went with it.  Turned out awesome.

Excellent, moist delicious cake.  I added extra walnuts on top of the cake.  Next time, I am going to cut the oil in half and use unsweetened applesauce to make it a bit healthiear.  I made mine in a 13x9 pan and it was perfect!

Unfortunately, I chose this recipe without reading the reviews because I was in a hurry! Too much oil, I should have reduced it.  It cooked 10 min past the recommended time and still wasn't completely done.

Not too pleased with the frosting either.  Had to add more sugar to have any consistency and still not firm enough, Next time I'll try one of the other recipes!   Brenda 08/11/2013

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used it to make muffins. I substituted the sugar with Splenda blend for health reasons.  I baked at the same temperature for 25 minutes and they came out perfect. I used a pampered chef muffin pan and got my 24 servings from this recipe.  I enjoyed without the frosting.  I read the reviews before baking and decided to give it a shot. Soooo not disappointed. Thank you for the recipe..  Kashmir

Amazing!  I made it for a bridal shower, and one girl told me she doesn't like carrot cake and that she got a slice to be polite.  Planned to only have one bite....ended up eating the whole thing and raved about how good it was.  People at the shower wanted the recipe.  So good.  I used a different icing recipe, but the cake itself was so good.

I make this recipe on a regular basis and it always turns out great. I do, however, add a tsp of baking powder. I usually make it in two rounds and bake in my convection oven at 325 degrees for 38-40 minutes. Now, if I could figure out how to eat more of it and keep my weight down ...

I have never made carrot cake before, and decided to go with this recipe.  DELICIOUS! By the suggestion of others, I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking power, and cut down on the oil to one cup and added a 1/2 cup of applesauce.  It came out great!

Delicious! I made these cupcakes for my Mum's birthday and they were a huge hit. The only thing I added was a dash of nutmeg to the batter & then topped the cupcake with cream cheese frosting. YUM! I'm sure I'll make this again... and soon.

Love this recipe. I use 1 t baking powder in addition to the baking soda, 1 cup of plain applesauce and NO OIL are my only changes. My grandchildren LOVE it. We baked one on Saturday and my granddaughter was shocked that there were actual real carrots in the cake. She thought it was just the name of the cake. :-)  I make my frosting by combing 1 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 heaping teaspoon of vanilla and just a little over 2 cups of SIFTED confectioners sugar. Baked at 325 in dark cake pans for 35 minutes and it was perfect (gas oven). I always sprinkle chopped walnuts on top just to make it a little prettier. Try this cake, you will not be disappointed.

I made this cake as a surprise for my mother, and she loved it, as did everyone else in my family! I did not have any heavy whipping cream on hand, so instead I used regular creamer. It seemed to work just as well! I have a nut allergy, so I also left out the walnuts, and it was still great!

This cake was delicious! I made it for my husband for father's day and he loved it! We also had other family and friends over and they loved it too! I too decreased the amount of oil to just 1 cup and only baked it for 30 minutes in two 9 inch pans.

I also used the frosting from the cream cheese frosting II recipe and that was fantastic!

I do not like carrot cake: I just do not like vegetables in my desert. I made this for my husband's birthday, because it is his second favourite cake (the first being prune cake). And he loved it, his family loved it, and even I liked it a lot. The cake is moist and has nice flavour. I did the frosting as suggested in this recipe, because I preferred to use cream rather than butter. I used almost 1/2 cup heavy cream and one 8oz package of cream cheese. It gave me just enough frosting for a two-tier 9in cake. An excellent recipe - thank you!

Doubled cinnamon, did not add nutmeg.  Baked two rounds.  Used a whipped cream cheese frosting from allrecipies.  It was amazing.  Lasted one week in the fridge without drying out.

The cake part of this was really, really fabulous!  The icing was a disaster which is why I am giving it 4 stars.  The directions were not very clear, I think you are supposed to whip the heavy cream for awhile.  It does not say to, so I didn't and I wound up with a runny mess.  So I threw it out and used the cream cheese frosting II recipe and that was great.    I hate when reviewers are like, 'oh this was a great recipe but only with my 500 adjustments...'  This is a GREAT recipe, and I added two things:  1)doubled the carrots b/c reviewers consistently state there was not enough; and 2) I added a ripe bananna.  It took me 50 minutes to bake it.  I will definitely do this again!

The most amazing carrot cake recipe I've ever tried! I made it for my birthday and my co-workers wouldn't let me take any home...I had to make another cake that same day for my family. My family will not allow me to take the cake to work.   I did add 1 tsp. baking powder and used only 1 cup oil like other reviewers recommended. For the frosting I used the Cream Cheese II recipe like a few other reviewers. Outta this world!!

This is the best recipe for carrot cake yet.  I always substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil; the cake is a little more dense but healthier and very flavorful.  I only had raw almonds instead of walnuts; I chopped them and dry roasted them in a pan...added a very yummy flavor.  This is a keeper; thanks so much!

I also used just 1 cup of oil.  Also changed frosting to 2 pkg. cream cheese, 1 stick of butter, then 2 cups of powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Much better frosting for this I think.

I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups in the cake and 2 cups in the cream cheese frosting.  Still very sweet; I may even just use 1.5 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting next time.  Also, instead of baking the walnuts into the cake, I sprinkled a layer on top of the frosting in between my two cake layers and then sprinkled another layer on top.  It was very pretty and you could taste the walnuts and the texture better than if it were baked in the cake.  If you're at high-altitude, I recommend you use only 3 eggs (if you like a super moist cake and don't want to risk a collapsing cake) and keep the oil at 1.5 cups (even though other reviewers recommend reducing it).  The batter will seem gelatinous, but it will bake up super moist and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had never made carrot cake from scratch before, as I am not a fan of it, but OH MY WORD! this is a great recipe! I, too reduced the oil to 1 c and added 2 t of baking powder and a handful of raisins. I baked it in two 8 inch pans, and it overflowed a bit, but turned out so yummy! Used the Cream Cheese II frosting as well. I am converted!

I agree with the other viewers as far as cutting back on the oil and adding baking powder. I added 1 c of oil and 1 tsp of baking powder and it came out great. I also decreased the walnuts to 1/2c and added 1/4c of flax seed. It turned out very moist and absolutely delicious.

My whole family enjoyed this cake.  My husband ate more than his fair share!   I modified this recipe by adding raisins.  Next time I make, I will add more cream cheese to the frosting and a bit less sugar.  It was too sweet in my opionion.  Other than that, it was one of the best carrot cakes I have eaten!

I made this to use up some carrots and it turned out pretty well.  I added a teaspoon of baking powder like most the people suggested and it came out great.  There is a lot of oil for my taste and I remember a trick my mother would use when making carrot cake and that is to substitute apple sauce for the oil and that cuts the calories in half (or more) I'll have to try it that way next time I make the cake.

I think this is a fab cake! I have made it twice in cupcake form.  Just so you know to anyone who didn't try the frosting it isn't too sweet.  Its very delicate tasting.  I prefer it to the other recipes that have butter.  Plus I have seen some recipes that have 4 cups of powdered sugar to pkg of cream cheese.  This came out perfect.  I am currently researching recipes for a cupcakery I plan to open and I can tell you I will be using this one. I love nut and the first time I used pecans and walnuts and I put more in than what this said.  The second time 2 days later my husband asked me to make it again but I didn't have any nuts so I diced up apple.  Turned out beautiful both times.  My husband is a sheriff and all his co-workers are my taste testers.  They claimed this one a winner!

This recipe is amazing!  I have made it time and time again, it has become my default recipe for carrot cake.  From the start, I followed the recommendations by TRindell (other than cutting down on the oil, I left that at the original recipe amount).

I have made this in a bundt pan, as mini loaves, in two regular size loaf pans.  I always use the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe, sometimes with the addition of pineapple.

After making several carrot cake disasters, this one is it!

Undoubtedly the best carrot cake recipe ever!  I add a little dash of ground cloves for a bit of spice! I have used pecans instead of walnuts from time to time.  Last Thanksgiving I made the cakes a day ahead, placed them in Tupperware and traveled from Florida to Louisiana with them and made the frosting once there.  Superb!

My husband's favorite cake is carrot cake, and I was looking for a killer recipe.  I decided to try this one, since it didn't involve raisins or pineapple, which he hates.  I omitted the nuts, but did everything else the same.  It turned out WONDERFUL - so very moist.  The only change I will make next time is to cut the oil and probably only use a cup.  It was a little too greasy. But the flavor was perfect.

Followed recipe to a tee.  I used only 2 cups of grated carrot.  But the cake was scrumptous, mosit, fluffy, and delicous.  Will make again.  Loved the frosting especially.

I absolutely love this cake!  I do make a couple small changes, though.  I stick the carrots in the microwave a couple of minutes to make them sweeter, and I add ground hazelnuts to the icing.

EXCELLENT!  WONDERFUL!  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 1tsp of baking powder per previous review and 1/4 cup of raisins.  I also made in a bundt pan and it only had to bake for 55 minutes.  I did make a different cream cheese frosting recipe. SIMPLY DELICIOUS!

Wonderful!  I used pecans instead of walnuts and cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups to suit my taste.  I adjusted the frosting by using 6 oz of cream cheese and only 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  The frosting was very easy to spread on the bundt cake but it set up well.  The cake was really delightful.  I took it to a potluck with a whole table full of desserts and it was snapped up immediately. Everybody was telling people "You have to get a slice of that carrot cake."

This turned out to be one of the best carrot cakes I have ever had.  There was a ton of frosting, so I might cut that down next time, but either way it was great!

Moist, delicious, easy and everyone raved about it.  I used Splenda for Baking to reduce sugar/calories and you couldn't tell the difference in the taste at all.

Absolutely perfect! I used pecans because I didn't have walnuts, worked out great! This is the first time I've tried to make a carrot cake from scratch, this will be my permanent recipe for it!

Very good though I believe the recipe should read one 8oz package of cream cheese rather than 3 oz.

Delicious! Very moist and yummy! I didn't use this recipe's Cream Cheese Frosting. I've been trying some of the other popular ones on this site and so far, I think I just like store bought best. I made these as cupcakes for my son's 1st birthday and they went a lot faster than the chocolate and yellow cupcakes! The cupcakes took about 25 minutes to bake.

The cake recipe was awesome just as it was! I followed the advice of another member, and used Cream Cheese Frosting II instead of the one listed, and it was just the right one.

This is AWSOME. I have never cooked a carrot cake before, and i had no idea what I was doing, (thus when I got to the icing and realised I had bought COTTAGE cheese, instead of CREAM cheese.) Either way, it was easy and fun and tastes great. As i'm typing this i'm actually eating it!!!
I love it, i'll make it again, (though I didn't use this much oil, only a cup,) and it was still moist and beautiful. YUM YUMYUM!!
ps. My icing was just icing sugar and vanilla and cream.

This was my first-ever carrot cake & my first-ever cake from scratch -- so I was incredibly happy when it turned out really well!  I made it for my husband's birthday, and everyone had great things to say about it.  

I was doubtful about really being able to frost the cake while it was still warm, but I was pressed for time & so tried it.  There were no problems.  (Whew!)  In fact, I would say that the frosting was the best part about this cake.  It was a great consistency and spread very easily, and the flavor was wonderful.  I would definitely use the same frosting again, while I might look around for a carrot cake that was a little healthier for next time.

Made this cake for my Mom's Bday yesterday.  Was a hit!!  I trimmed down the recipe by using 3/4 C of applesauce and 3/4 C Safflower oil (high is VitE) instead of 1 1/2 cup of oil.  This was also easy!  Did not try the icing.

I made this cake for my co-workers (without nuts) and everyone was raving about it saying how moist and delicious it was.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  I used lite cream cheese and the frosting came out just as good.  I definately reccomend this treat!

This is my second time making this and it is always a huge hit. I did use a full 8 ounces of cream cheese with the 2.5 cups of confectioners sugar because I felt the icing was too sweet otherwise. I also made this with gluten free flour due to the fact that I have an allergy. Turned out perfectly with the GF flour! Tried and true recipe!

I used this recipe flat out for my grandma’s bday, and she LOVED IT. I took it out of the oven much earlier and it was still not as moist as I was hoping, but that easily could’ve been some incorrect measurement, etc. I also added little embellishments with white chocolate and walnuts, (mainly to cover up my terrible frosting job). I’d definitely go for twice the frosting. I made a layer cake with only two layers and I had to make a second batch of frosting to cover it all. Although, I think that anyone only doing 1 layer will be fine if you’re not too generous. Otherwise, I absolutely loved it, and so did my extended family. Additionally, that frosting is TO DIE FOR.

This is my 2nd bake ever. Recipe was easy to follow... assuming you do better than I did and get the ingredients BEFORE you start the process. :P Otherwise, it's a good process. My icing looks like  and I'm hoping it doesnt taste grainy.

This was delicious! I will make it again, probably using less coconut. I have several family members that are not a fan of coconut. I was afraid that I cooked it too long, but it was perfectly moist.

I made this cake today using (2) 9-inch round pans.  I recommend baking for only 35 minutes (mine stuck to the pans).  Also, I would double the icing recipe.

Simple recipe that turned out delicious! Read the reviews befor I made this and I took the advice from others by reducing the oil to 1 cup and used 1 tsp of baking powder in addition to the baking soda. Since I made these changes I rated it a 4/5 because according to others it is not a 5/5 as is. Still saving this one in he books to make again with these positive changes. I made my own cream cheese frosting, not the frosting from this particular recipe. I used two 9 inch pans baking them at 325 for 35-40 minutes.

I will make this again - great way to use a lot of carrots.  I made the recipe almost as is; I used more carrots than called for, to get rid of what I had, but it didn't change the flavor.  If anything, the cake was very moist and had a perfect consistency.  I made in 2 8" cake pans, and put the left-over batter in mini-muffin tins.  This cake was so good I ended up not putting any frosting on it, we ate it plain and it was delicious!

I made this exactly as the recipe is written. It was a huge success however I felt it was a little dry. Next time I won’t bake it as long and I’m confident that will solve the problem.

I've been practicing some items for a birthday party I'm hosting.  I'm an advanced-beginner at baking.  The recipe was EASY and was a HIT at my office (they are my test subjects).  I made it in three 9" cake pans and used the cream cheese icing (I think #2) from this site.  AMAZING.  Taste, texture, consistency, and moist.

SUPER YUMMY! I read comments and only did 1 1/4 cups oil and added a teaspoon of baking powder. I suggest doubling the icing if you plan on a layer cake.

Good balance of flavors! I added baking powder, as others mentioned. I should have put in less oil - it was too greasy as written. Next time I'm adding coconut flakes.

Loved it!  Was so easy to make and so very moist.  I always put more pecans than called for, which I did again.  Made it in a bundt pan, and instead of cream cheese frosting, I made a glaze and dribbled it on.  Glaze:  2 cups powdered sugar and a little lemon juice, just enough to wet the sugar,might have been a tablespoon, and then just drizzle on.

I use unsweetened applesauce for most of the oil. I also add coarsely chopped walnuts and shredded coconut to the batter. What a wonderful treat!!!! Canned, drained, crushed pineapple might be a yummy addition too.  I'm sure you wouldn't want to put more than 1/4 c. In the batter.

Couple of changes - 1/2 cup oil, 1 cup unsweetened applesauce.  Frosting - 8 oz cream cheese softened additional heavy cream (TBSP) for consistency.

I made it but took the recommendations of others and only used 1 cup of oil but then changed it to 1/2 c browned butter and 1/2 c oil.  I baked it in 2 9" pans for 35 minutes and frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from All Recipes.  It was perfection!

This is the best carrot cake recipe!  It's simple to make and the icing is also great.  My family asks for it for birthday celebrations.  I make mine a layer cake, double the icing and refrigerate for a few hours so the icing hardens up.

I made this carrot cake. It's very moist and tasty. I did make a few changes by substituting the flour for cake flour, only using 1 cup of vegetable oil and using 3- 9 inch cake pans. Baking the 3 cakes at 350° for 25 minutes. My husband loves it.

I normally use the Sam's Famous Carrot cake recipe on here (if you haven't tried it, you must!) but I didn't have any pineapple and was in a pinch so I tried this one as a back up. I would say it's "Just ok". I wish I would have read the other reviews so I would have known to add baking powder and reduce the oil, because it really did need it. It came out dense and oily.  I don't mind dense carrot cake per say, in fact the Sam's one is pretty dense, but this one just didn't have the flavor I was looking for. I would say this is a good stand by easy recipe though if you just want to make something quick. I would say, add the baking powder, reduce the oil, and add more cinnamon than recipe calls for. I also did not use the frosting recipe and used the Cream Cheese icing II one (it really is the best).

This cake turned out very very good! Was light and fluffy and good flavor!
I used the posted recipe as a base but made a few changes as recommended in the comments:
Cake:
I used no walnuts.
I used only 1 1/4 cup Canola Oil.
Added 1 cup of dark raisins.
Added 1 Tbsp. Baking Soda.
Added 1 tsp ground Nutmeg.
Added 1 tsp ground Cardamom.
Frosting:
I used a version of the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe but changed the ratios to:
5/8 cup Cream Cheese.
3 Tbsp. Butter.
1 Cup Confectioners Sugar.
1 tsp vanilla extract.
This was enough to fully cover  the top and sides of the cake baked in a 9" Bundt pan.
Next time I will try it with a jar of carrot baby food.

My kids know I love carrot cake and asked me to find a recipe. After much looking, we settled in this one. My 12 and 13Yo made this cake as per the instructions with two small changes. They swapped sun-maid Raisins for the walnuts and did have the carrots in a Parmesan grater making more of a mush than strings. Well after they completed it and iced it I have to say this is truly a very moist cake and probably the best carrot cake I can remember eating!  We will make this again!  Note we did use a convection oven set for baking.

I've made this cake several times! Making it for hubby's b day party Saturday!!! It's so moist and delicious and everyone asked for the recipe every single time! I recommend this recipe over any other carrot cake recipe because I have made several different ones and this by far is the best!

I just made this cake today and my family and I loved it! The only adjustment I made was not adding heavy cream in my frosting, other than that I think this recipe deserves 5 stars!

First carrot cake I've ever made and turned out  GREAT! Even the kids loved it. I did use a different cream cheese frosting recipe just because I didn't have whipping cream. I'll be sticking to this recipe

I am "famous" in my family for my carrot cake, but I lost my recipe that I have used for decades. To this recipe, I added 2 tsps of baking powder per previous reviews, and used Cream Cheese Frosting II.  The second time I made it, I only used 1 cup of oil per other's suggestions. It was delicious and my family loved it even more than before.

I agree with TRindell's review. This carrot cake was great with her suggestions. Everyone really enjoyed it-- and it tasted even better the second and third day. I made mine in a 9x13 dish and used a half recipe of the Cream Cheese Frosting II to coat it. Very nice. Finely grating a pound of carrots can be taxing work, but other than that this recipe was very easy. I will be making it again.

WOW!
I just made this cake and can't stop eating it!

I did make a couple of alterations, as per other reviewers, but I'm sure it would still be a 5 star even if I'd followed the recipe as written.

This is what I did...

substituted 1/2 the oil for applesauce,
added 2 tsp baking powder,
added couple rasps of nutmeg,
added mashed ripe banana,
added chocolate chips and raisins as I didn't have walnuts,
no icing as I was just too lazy

I used this recipe to make my dad's birthday cake (with this being the first cake I had attempted from scratch,) and absolutely everyone said it was hands- down the best cake they had ever had!  I myself definitely agree.  Highly recommended!

I love this cake but I have never made it according to the recipe for various reasons.  I read the reviews and reduced the oil down to 1 cup (actually I am in Germany and do metric so 1/4 liter).  And I add 1 tsp baking powder.  It seems to work, I have never thought the cake was too heavy.  I have trouble adding the right amount of carrots because I don't have a kitchen scale so I just guess.  Everytime I am done though, I wish I'd added more carrots. There are two Cream Cheese II frosting recipes.  I use the one that has tons of sugar. It is good with this cake.

This cake is the easiest and the moistest. I love it. I get raves every time I make it. I do not use nuts or rasins. As for the frosting, I make mine a little different so I cannot comment on that portion of the recipe.  This is a keeper in my book.

This was fantastic. I made it for my husbands birthday and both him and my father claimed it was the best Carrot Cake they have ever had. I was out of vegetable oil so I use EVOO instead, and I only used one cup but it turned out perfectly moist. I also doubled the frosting recipe and made it a layer cake. Instead of using 6oz of cream cheese I used 8oz. I am about to make it again tonight, but I am going to make cupcakes instead! I also found a recipe for cream cheese frosting that uses 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 mascarpone so I am going give that a shot.

Best carrot cake ever! I actually doubled the frosting recipe and used 8 oz of cream cheese. There was a bit too much confectioner's sugar so that is why I added the last 2 oz of cream cheese so keep it tasting like cream cheese and not sugar. I left out the nuts and used them as decorations up the side of the cake. Overall...AWESOME, MOIST CARROT CAKE!

Very moist and flavorful, just added pineapple chunks, fresh grated ginger, and shredded coconut with a cream cheese topping with toasted coconut flakes with butter and brown sugar.  People loved it!!!! Very easy to make, just for fullnes beat eggs until fluffy, then add the rest of the ingredients.  Great recipe!

Excellent- I did as many suggested- cut the sugar and oil in half. Perfect! My husband even liked it- he was hesitant to even try it because it had carrots in it, but then ate his fair share!!

great cake, i did only 35 minutes in two round pans and that was almost too much; i just used the yummy cream cheese frosting II from this site instead of the one listed on this recipe, the only thing i added to that frosting as a change was 1/4th cup heavy whipping cream, so great :) alli

Loved this recipe! Very easy. I made it in a Bunt pan and made a glaze of 1/2 a stick of butter melted and powdered sugar. It was great!

This is an outstanding cake recipe! I made it for my dad and he had to have another piece (so did I)! The one thing I disagree with is the putting the frosting on early and that doesn't affect the taste! This is a divine cake for any occasion at all!

The cake was great, but only gave it four stars because of the cook time.  I thought an hour and 20 minutes sounded like too long.  I checked it at one hour, and it was completely done.  My oven doesn't normally cook fast, so I will always shorten the cook time.

This is by far the most moist and delicious (not to mention easy ) carrot cake I have ever had.  I double the recipe and make a stacked 9 1/2 x 11 layer cake for big birthdays!

Good cake. I reduced the oil and sugar, and added a little more carrot, as well, the other tablespoon of backing powder as suggested. I also used a different frosting using Neufachatel cheese. It was delicious. Thanks!

This was one of the best carrot cakes I have ever tasted. I did make some adjustments to this recipe. I reduced the oil to just 1 cup. I added four four ounce jars of baby food carrots. I used the 1 pound bag shredded in my food processor and added 1 tsp of baking powder. I also doubled the cinnamon and added a half tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 ginger.

I made cupcakes with this recipe for my husbands birthday.  It is very close to my mom's zucchini bread recipe... and, not surprisingly, tastes a lot like it as well.  I used a 'trail mix' of sunflower seeds, pepitas and raisins instead of walnuts and added just a bit of vanilla.  I ended up using canned cream cheese frosting because I didn't have the ingredients to make my own but they turned out fantastic!  Cupcakes only need to cook for 25-30 min.

My cake turned out to be a carrot omelette. It was eggy and weird. After reading all the good ratings here, I suspected the fault lies in me. Double checked on the ingredients and realised that the measurement converter on this site is faulty. The recipe calls for 1 cup of sugar and 2 cups of flour. As I use metric measurement, the recipe says 400gm of sugar and 250gm flour! Being an amateur baker, I did not sense something was wrong. I'll still rate this low because the converter should be correct. What a waste of ingredients. Nevertheless, I'll try this agian, with the correct measurements.

The carrot cake was moist and came out perfect at the given temp. and time (which is rare). I used this recipe for the cake and used the Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting recipe on the site. It was delicious!

This was the first carrot cake I ever made.  I added 1/2 c coconut and 1/2 c raisins and I used the cream cheese frosting II.  I made it for a friend in school that loves carrot cake.  I have received rave reviews from people I didn't even know tasted it.  The most common comment was "It was the BEST carrot cake I've ever had.  Tonight is my husband's birthday and I made it for the second time.  I know he's going to go crazy over it.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is a lovely flavor and texture, and the frosting is the perfect hit between sweet and creamy. My only criticism is that some spiciness would have been good- maybe the addition of ginger or nutmeg would do the trick.

The cake was nice and moist with a lot of flavor, but the frosting was too sweet.  Next time I would make a different cream cheese frosting or use premade.

This is a great carrot cake, not quit elike my grandma used to make but pretty darn close. I didn't use the icing suggested with this recipe. I opted for Cream Cheese Frosting II (also on this site) because that recipe was more like my grandma's. 

The only thing I can suggest for the cake recipe, add some brown sugar. This cake was much lighter than I remember carrot cakes being and I think it is because there is no brown sugar in the recipe. I am making this again for Easter (today), this time I will add 1 cup of brown sugar and see how it turns out.
Great cake, thanks for teh recipe.

Cake itself was delicious. Didn't care for the icing -- not enough tang since it is cut with the whipping cream. Will make again, but with a tangier icing.

The cake was phenomenal.  So moist & flavorful.  I baked two layer cakes...one for my husband's office & one for my office.  I only had enough icing for one cake (and that was after doubling the recipe), so I used the Betty Crocker Cream Cheese Icing on the other cake.  I have to say, Betty's is better!  The icing recipe here was too sweet (even for MY taste!) & the texture wasn't thick enough to stick to the sides of the cake.  I ended up with icing dripping off the sides of my cake plate & it didn't make for a nice presentation.  If you make this cake, try to find a different cream cheese icing recipe.  But the cake is the best carrot cake I've ever had!  This will be a recipe to hand down to future generations!

Made this cake for my boyfriend & took it into work for him.  Everyone loved it, huge hit!  I did add a tsp. of baking powder as per one review.  I also used the cream cheese II recipe from this site.  Excellent cake!!!

This got a genuine and un-solicited "Wow!" from my husband. Excellent recipe! I'll make it  several times a year I'm sure!

This carrot cake is so moist and delicious.  It was also extremely simple to make... and I am a real amateur baker.  As recommended from the reviews, I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II.  Yummyyy...

I work at a cafe in a college town and I am always looking for new recipes. My fiance was hounding me to make a carrot cake with cream cheese frosting.  Usually I wouldn't blink about making my special guy something, however I didn't know how well a carrot cake would go over. At any rate I chose this recipe, baked it, put out a sample at my job and cake sold out before my shift was over! P.S. My guy and I shared a piece it is delicious!!!

This cake was AWESOME! I made it for a christmas party and everybody loved it. It just came out of the oven and was so warm and moist, but amazingly stayed that way for the entire party! It was an easy cake to make, and i added my own cream cheese frosting which made it delicious!

I wasn't crazy about this carrot cake, and I do love the stuff.  For starters, I felt it was WAY too much oil.  May try subbing some for applesauce next time.  I also thought it definitely needed the walnuts (we tried without, as my husband doesn't care for them); I also added nutmeg.  The cake collapsed some, although I did follow the other directions precisely.  I also found I had to cook it longer than stated.  It was okay and got eaten, but just definitely not my favorite carrot cake.

This was by far the best Carrot Cake recipe I have ever had the pleasure of making.  I used two 8" pans and in less than an hour I had a wonderful cake.  Everyone loved it!  Used my own recipe for the frosting, but all the same a great cake!

Delicious!  I made the cake JUST as the recipe called for, no substitutions or alterations and it was perfect!  Very moist!  I didn't care for the frosting too much, so I made a different cream cheese frosting - but I will make again for sure!!!

Wow, very yummy cake. I never usually make carrot cake....but this one was great. I actually held the nuts(not a great fan), and for the icing, I did not add the cream, I added a bit of milk, and only added maybe a cup of sugar instead of 2 1/2. It was still very very good. Thanks.
