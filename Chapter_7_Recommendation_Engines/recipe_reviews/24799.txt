this was awesome, I did do a couple things different thought.  Like some others i did add some water to the mayonaise and mustard so the coating was not as thick.  I also used prepared mustard instead of dry mustard.  Also some people did make the comment the the dipping sauce was bland, well that is the making of honey dill sauce all you need  to do is cut back on the mayonaise add a little more honey and add some dill and it will be delicious thats what i did.  FYI if you don't have the buttery round which i didn't one time that i made this, i used  a combo of pretzel  and corn flakes and i gave a awesome taste i have made this recipe several times already and i never seem to have the crackers. YUMMY!!!!!!!

This was an awesome recipe! Moist, tender and very flavorful! I made it as a main dish by using pounded out chicken breasts (halved) and increased the cooking time to about 35 minutes. I modified the recipe by adding dijon mustard (a few tablespoons) to the final dipping sauce and thinning out the mayo/mustard dredge with some olive oil and regular mustard. I would suggest making more of the sesame/cracker crumb mix because I didnt have quite enough. Great job Erica!

These we SO easy to make and turned out INCREDIBLE!!!  I used regular mustard instead of the dry and added a little more than it called for.  VERY GOOD!  I also added a little mustard to the dipping sauce and thought it added a little more zip.  Even my 3 and 5 year olds loved it!

My grandkids love chicken tenders.  We just buy the thin chicken breast and cut into strips or you can buy the chicken strips. To give them more nutrients we replaced finely grated carrots for the onions and used miricle whip in place of mayo.  In place of buttery crackers we used regular non salt cracker crumbs mixed with 1/2 teaspoon to one table spoon of honey.  Mix honey, miracle whip and crackers together and coat chicken, then spray shallow pan with pam or a little oil.  Bake coated chicken for about 18 - to 20 minutes or until done.  For dipping sauce they use honey or barbecue sauce.  They loved it.  Thanks for the post.

I made it with nonfat yougurt in place of the mayo to reduce the fat content, and it was good.  My kids loved it.

Everyone raved about these chx strips, and the kids -- 3 & 5 -- loved them. Add some of your favorite mustard (we used ballpark) to provide a little kick to the dipping sauce.

this was a very easy and tasty recipe.  I used finely chopped onion and dijon mustard instead of the powders. The dip was a little bland so I added dijon and paprika to spice it up.  I will definitely use again with a sweet and sour dip.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone liked it.  I think the dipping sauce is a little too rich, though.

The flavor of these is GREAT, my only complaint is that the breading kept falling off so easily. I didn't use the sweet sauce suggested, just dipped in honey, but when I dipped all the breading fell off into the honey so I started drizzling it over the strips...still delecate to the touch but drizzling helped keep everything together.
I DEFINATELY reccoment this recipe, but I'm going to search other reviews for tips on keeping coating in tact. Also, make 20% more coating mix than you think you'll need; I ran out & had to finish up with bread crumbs on my last few chicken strips.

This was fantastic!  I did not modify the recipe, but I did have a problem with the breading falling off the chicken after it was baked.  Any ideas on that problem?

Delicious!  I cut 3 boneless breasts (almost 2 lbs) into finger-size strips, put them in a baggie and spooned the mayo mixture over the chicken.  I just mooshed it around in the bag to coat all the pieces.  For the crumb mixture, I used 2 sleeves of Ritz, the 1/2 c. toasted sesame seeds, plus a little garlic powder and fresh cracked black pepper.  I covered my pan with parchment paper and sprayed with a bit of cooking spray.  It took about 20 mins for the strips to be done.  The amount was plenty for four adults.  For the sauce, try 2 parts mayo to 1 part honey, and add some dried dill weed.  I used 1/2 c. mayo, 1/4 c. honey and about 3/4 tsp. dill weed.  We loved the flavor and nice crispy crunch of these strips.  Thanks for sharing the recipe! :)

I thought this recipe sounded tasty but kids said it was bland. I even tried to step it up a bit by using crushed french fried onions in with the cracker crumbs. I found the dipping of the chicken in the mayo mixture messy because it was so thick. That didn't make it any easier for the breading to stick. I used all the mayo in my dipping mixture so I didn't make the sauce. Our dipping sauce was ranch dressing and bbq/ranch combo sauce.

Anything where the picky 8 year old says " This is the best chicken I ever ate" gets 5 stars in my book!  I ran out of crackers and substituted with goldfish crackers!  Worked like a charm!  Next time I might use the multi color ones just for fun!  Thanks for sharing!

It was not such a hit by me. I baked instead of frying, but the sauce was not great.

Mediocre at best. I used the honey mustard sauce from aussie chicken and that made it more tolerable. There was really nothing that special about this dish.

LOVED IT!! i had to alter the recipe a bit because I cooked only enough chicken for myself, and I added a little water to the mixture before dipping the chicken as another reviewer mentioned to make it less thick.. i also added some mustard to the dipping sauce.. A+ !! Thank You! I will be making this again!!

I didn't particularly enjoy this one, though my husband thought it was tasty. It lacked flavor of some sort, even though I did my best to add extra flavor. In the end the only flavor that really shone through was the salt on the crackers. IF I ever tried this again I would make the following changes: *Dredge chicken in cornstarch or flour first *spice up the mayo mixture (I used sour cream/lite miracle whip mixture) *use flavored bread crumbs instead of crackers or a mixture of the two *toast the sesame seeds beforehand *make another dipping sauce entirely. Hope that helps someone!

This is an awesome, awesome homemade chicken recipe.  I would probably only give it 4.5 stars because I had to tweak it a bit.  I added prepared mustard instead of powdered.  I also added 1 tsp of garlic powder and matza meal instead of bread crumbs.  It was amazing and my kids ate it.  I used low fat mayo and it turned out excellent.  I will look no further for a good chicken finger recipe.

This recipe produces very moist and flavorful strips and I love that they are baked, not fried...but like everyone else, I could not get the coating to stay on them!

Made this for friends and everyone thought it was good. I had to make more of the cracker/sesame seed mix than the recipe recomends. We all thought that the dipping sauce was a bit too sweet.

These were really tasty.  I had to thin the mayo/onion/mustard mix with water to dip the chicken.  I also added mustard to the dipping sauce.  It was alot of work to dip all of the chicken nuggets.  I think next time I'll just make whole chicken breast halves instead.

YUMMMMMMMM!  I followed the advice of several reviewers:  I also made mine as the main meal, and replaced the dry mustard with Dijon mustard in the dredging sauce.  I'll be honest, when I read about the mayo/honey "sweet dipping sauce", I was a bit skeptical how it would taste.  It seemed such an odd and unappetizing combination of ingredients.  But it was absolutely delicious with the cracker-coated chicken strips.   Try this recipe as an appetizer or main dish.  You'll be glad you did.

I liked these, my son even did too. I did not have any dry mustard, so I subbed dijon mustard for some of the mayo and it worked. I would suggest putting a light coating of the mayo mixture on the chicken, if you lather it on, they will turn out more gooey than crispy. Overall these were a very flavorful method for making a healthy alternative to fried chichen. I made them more low-fat by using low fat mayo and reduced fat club crackers.

Found mayonnaise dip awkward. Maybe I put on too think of a layer?  But I found the coating would come off in clumps wherever I touched the chicken.
Base on other reviews I add ground ginger and sesame oil to mayo mix.  Still not especially strong flavor, but they all got eaten at the potluck!

This was OK.  Was a bit of a pain to make though and it wasn't super-impressive so I don't know if we'll have again.  We used panko bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs and added some dijon to the sauce.  We cut the chicken into nuggets instead of strips and they still took longer to bake.

This was an easy pleaser for the kids and hubby. I did use prepared mustard.  I only had herbed crackers in the pantry so I used those, and it came out terrific. Pleasantly surprised with the mayo/honey dip too.

Very good recipe!  Not like the stuff I've had at the Chinese restaurant but exactly like the title.  Changes I did - Increase the ritz crackers to 2 cups of crushed instead of the 1 1/4 as suggested. Also the mayo was a bit thick and I added 2 tbsp of water to it.  You can cut the chicken into chunks too.

I omit the sesame seeds as I know the kids would try to pick them out!  I make a dip of equal parts of honey and dijon mustard.  These are very moist and yummy.  Great with sweet potatoe fries!

The chicken strips are excellent. However the dipping sauce needs to be "kicked up" a bit. I prefer another honey-mustard dipping sauce that is on this website.

This was good. I'd make it again, but I think I'd mess around with the dipping sauce a bit. It was a little too thick (and/or sweet)for me.

I love this recipe for chicken strips, though I have to admit I always make them without the sauce on the side. The proportions seem a little difficult to get right since I always just use whatever amount of chicken I need to use up, but that's not the fault of the recipe. Sometimes the coating doesn't stick too well, though. I do think the type of cracker matters... I used saltines a couple times since I had no Ritz, and it didn't stick as well. Also, I tend to pound the chicken breasts to be more even before cutting into strips.

My husband and I liked it, but the kids would not eat it because of the sesame seeds. The sauce didn't really have any flavor besides mayo. Overall I wouldn't make this again. But thank you for the recipe.

I found this recipe delicious and easy to make. I cheated with the crackers and added 1/2 cup of dijon mustard to the dipping sauce and found both my changes come out excelent.

I substituted the crackers for bread crumbs, added coarse ground pepper to the sesame seed blend and a couple dashes of cayenne to the mustard & mayo blend.  I thought the taste and texture was great.  The calorie/fat content is a little high, we used a light mayo to help reduce that.

Won't make again. My boys weren't wild about these and the amount of Mayo used was a bit of a turn off to me. Fine for 1 try, but I'll keep searching.

Turned out okay - just a little bland. May try again with some added spices. Good for a healthy version of chicken fingers.

Nothing spectacular.  We all thought it was a little bland - chicken & sauce.  I did add some mustard into the sauce after trying it first and that helped a bit.

I made this recipe with 1-inch chicken cubes instead of strips, also added a little 5-spice to the first blend (as well as accidentally using fresh instead of dried onion - about 1/8 of a big onion), and for the sauce I added a dash of sesame oil and some dry mustard. Then I diluted the sauce with water and served the chicken over salad with grapes, tomato, onion and cheese and used the sauce as a dressing.  Very delicious and satisfying. Definitely worth trying again!

I usually try to follow these things to the letter, but Ritz made this a little unhealthy. I did the mayo/mustard thing (with Miracle Whip Light and prepared mustard) and minced onion. Then I crushed bran flakes--added lots of fiber and whole grain, and mixed it with sesame seeds. Baked for about 20 minutes; no sauce necessary, it was so moist and tasty; the mayo-mustard thing was enough.

These were awesome.  I didn't have sesame seeds the second time I made them, but they still came out great.  The dip is delicious.  I also added a little more honey to it to meet my tastes.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. I thought the chicken could have been a little crispier, that may have been my fault. I suppose i could have fried the chicken but my husband is on a heart healthy diet. I thought it was a perfect recipe for him. Fortunately, my husband and very picky children loved this recipe so i will definitely make this again and again.

This was a great recipe!  It was very easy to make and everyone loved it.  I had enough to feed myself, husband, 6-year-old, and three teenagers with some left over.  I liked that the strips were smaller, it really made the chicken go a long way.  The dipping sauce went perfect with the chicken.  I used the other reviews suggestions and used a little mustard in the sauce and it was perfect.  I think next time I make this I'll toast the sesame seeds a little for the coating.

Pretty good, my husband liked it and he's not fond of mayo. I used Miracle Whip, and had to use some whole flaxseed because I was low on sesame, but it came out really good!(I used whole wheat saltines, too, in place of Ritz) I skipped the sauce (*way* too much mayo!), and made a sweet and sour sauce instead. My kids really liked it too!

Tasty, but so full of fat we wouldn't serve this again without some changes. I would want to buy chicken tenders next time to make this quicker.  Anyone have a way to lower the mayo content, etc?

this is such a simple and delish dish! I have been making this recipe for 2 years and 3 kids still get just as excited everytime i tell them i am making it. I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers: 1. add a little water to the mayonnaise to thin it out a bit. 2. I add seasoning to crackers (my choice is garlic pepper) 3. ENJOY!

This was GOOD, but I wouldn't say it was the best.  I did the chicken exactly by the recipe, and it was plenty juicy, just a little strange with the mayo mixture under the cracker/sesame seed mixture.  I didn't water down the mayo as some suggested, b/c I thought it was easy enough to get on the chicken.  I did alter the dipping sauce slightly, b/c as written, it just tastes like slightly different mayo.  I added an extra tbsp of  honey and about a tbsp of dijon mustard.  That made it edible, but nothing to rave about.  My 2 year old did love these, so I will probably make them again.

The chicken was good but the cracker crumbs were too rich. Maybe that's just my family though.

These were very good! I followed the recipe but used some onion powder bc it was all I had on hand and regular yellow mustard for the coating. I also did what others have said and added some regular yellow mustard to the dipping sauce which makes it nice and tangy.

I made these twice.  Once as recipe states as a tester and my family loved them (I did not make the dipping sauce). The second time was for a party I was having and I ran out of sesame seeds. As another member suggested I used flax seeds.  They were just as wonderful (and a little healthier). Both times I used a jar duck sauce which worked out great. Thanks for a great recipe.

The chicken came out really moist.I added some seasoning to the sesame/cracker mixture to give it more flavor. We all liked this dish.

Excellent recipe, a hit with even the little ones! I used a little less mayo and used French's Sweet and Zesty deli mustard for a little more flavor. I also used aquarter of a packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix in place of the onion- also for more flavor!

I loved how easy this was to make and made for very moist and flavorful chicken that my family loved!  In all fairness, I didn't make the recipe exactly as written.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder prior to coating it with the mayo/mustard mixture.  I also used prepared brown mustard instead of mustard powder and added a bit of  nutritional yeast  which added another dimension to the flavor of the coating.  I also used panko instead of butter cracker.  I baked for 17 min. and the results were fabulous!

The coating tasted like sesame seeds & buttery crackers.  Department of the obvious, I know.  I added some garlic powder & pepper, but it really didn't do much.  I was hoping the mayo would somehow end up crisping the coating, with it being mostly oil.  It didn't, but the chicken was very tender & moist.
