I am obsessed with this soup! I made it at my restaurant and people went nutso for it! Simple ingredients turned into something magnificent. Unless you are feeding a hungry restaurant crowd, I would suggest scaling the recipe back because it makes a large quanirity as  written.

Used AR's "change servings" feature and scaled this down to 4 servings.  Was a little shy on the milk, so I added a bit of heavy cream (maybe 1/4 cup) I had left in the fridge.  Used baby bella mushrooms (1 lb), and added a little more flour to reach the mushroom soup consistency I like.  I gave the soup a pretty good grind of fresh nutmeg.  Although it's a subtle background flavor, I think it's essential and sets this recipe apart from others.  This soup is mellow but still rich and has that earthiness that I so love in a good mushroom soup.  Not only is this easy to prepare, it's DELICIOUS, and I wouldn't change a thing.  Going into my Favorites folder.

Good job Joe!  This was great stuff that Hubs and I thoroughly enjoyed!  I added minced garlic to the mushroom onion mix tho’ I’m not sure I’d say it was a critical addition.  Only because the milk I used was reduced-fat, I compensated by using equal parts half-and-half and milk to give it a little more richness.  Loved the hint of nutmeg– it was a distinct but subtle touch.  Mainly because I had them to use, I threw in some fresh chives along with the parsley – I liked the little bite of flavor they added.  Had I not added the chives or the garlic, however, I doubt I would have enjoyed this any less.

My first thought on tasting this was that it was lacking something but we enjoyed it.  The next day it tasted even better.  We scaled this down to 4 servings.  The soup takes about a half hour or so to cook rather than the ten minutes it states on the recipe. The next time I fix this I will simmer the onions in the butter for 3 - 5 minutes until tender then add the mushrooms and simmer for another 10 and go on from there.  This will be my go to recipe for mushroom soup.

This soup is fantastic! I scaled it down to 4 servings and I wish I had  made more. I followed the recipe as best I could, but I made at the last minute and did not have fresh parsley, so I used dried parsley. I added the dried parsley with the broth and added 1/4 cup of dry white wine. Other that that I made no other changes. My husband loved it and he is not a mushroom soup lover. We both agree that this soup will be on our monthly rotation. Thank you so much for this great recipe!!!

Worth way more than 5 stars. I'm the only one in my house who eats mushrooms (I married a heathen!), but I make up for the lack by liking them A LOT, and this recipe satisfies my cravings. When I'm eating a mushroom soup, I want mushroom flavor, not 11 herbs and spices, and this recipe delivers. I scaled it down to 1 pound of mushrooms because it was just me eating it, and finished the entire pot in 2 meals. The recipe is a keeper!

Easy and delicious. I made this overnight in my crockpot. In the morning I froze 2/3 of it and used the rest to slow cook beef stroganoff. Wow!

I had mushrooms on hand that we're on the brink of going bad.  Once again I turned to AR for suggestions. Like all of the recipes I have saved, I had all of the ingredients for this recipe on hand less the parsley.  I was able to have the ingredients, and soup done in approx. 20 minutes.  This soup is fabulous.  I did not use the sour cream or parsley, and it was still fantastic.  Thank you for your submission.  This will definetly be made again.

Very, very good. Like others, I halved it. I made Chef John's from this website and preferred this (Joe's) recipe for taste and a bit healthier. I did use Chef John's method though of cooking the mushrooms thoroughly first at high heat until caramelized, and then added the onions. I also blended half the cooled soup, but didn't really need to.

I scaled down to four servings.  I added a small clove of crushed garlic to the onions and mushroom mixture.  I used a rich skim milk (that always thickens nicely in sausage gravy) but the soup really didn't thicken up, even after adding about 2 tablespoons more flour, even after using the immersion blender.  Tasting immediately after it was cooked, I decided to sauté about 4 more ounces of sliced mushrooms to have a few whole pieces in the soup.  Although this soup was decent,  we prefer the Golden State Mushroom soup on AR.

Quick and tasty! I followed the instructions and added about a dozen dashes of Franks. Then, just before serving I used my immersion blender  for just a few seconds to finely chop some of the mushrooms.

This is a very tasty and easy soup to make.  I have a hard time following instructions and this recipe was no exception.  I had only 1 lb of mushrooms so I scaled the recipe to fit that.  Then I added a few carrots, some celery and a kohlrabi (all chopped) that I found in the fridge.  After everything was simmering I felt it needed dome zing so I added a couple big pinches of dried thyme.  So I have no idea what the original recipe tasted like but mine came out great!

Sized this to feed 6 and then followed the recipe pretty closely. Found I had to add a little more seasoning, few cloves of garlic with the onion, a few shakes of thyme and garlic salt. I used 1% milk so it didn't thicken a lot, but I used my immersion blender and that seemed to help. You could use this as a base and throw in a few other vegetables or rice or chicken and make it a full meal.

Excellent flavor. I scaled it to 6 servings and made it as written.  Easy to make as the ingredients are on hand. I threw some reconstituted gourmet mushrooms from Costco which added interest and flavor. Also, I added a bit of garlic to the leftovers. Thanks for sharing this recipe it’s now in the our soup rotation.

We liked this soup.  I cut the recipe in half. 5 c. Milk 5c  low sodium chicken broth,  1/2 cup + 2 tbsp  flour. And half the mushrooms and seasonings.  I put a dollop of sour cream just before serving.  I used small, sliced crimini  mushrooms.   I followed the recipe as written .  This soup has a good flavor and needs the salt. We thought the soup was very thin. So, if you half the recipe, use more flour.  I actually thought the soup smelled and tasted good with just the milk before I added the broth. Next time I'll add less broth.  Because the soup was thin, the sour cream dollop sunk into the soup and formed curds. The sour cream adds to the flavor and needs to be added. Thicker, and cooler soup would solve the problem.

This is a great soup recipe, you can make it by the recipe and it is good.  Or you can add into the mushrooms (after they are cooked), leftovers, tonight I added leftover pork sirloin roast cut in little cubes, and leftover mash potatoes, delicious, and a great way to make leftovers seem like an entirely new meal!  We always say we are going to add some cheese too, but it is so tasty we never do!

Quick and simple recipe with a nice earthy flavor. I, too, scaled down to  4 servings. The only change I made was using a mixture of milk and half and half, cause I only had 1% milk and that wouldn't give the soup enough creaminess.

Made 4 servings... Used half & Half instead of milk. Also used @1 lb. Babybella mushrooms (be sure to wipe with a damp paper towel, then slice or chop) & added 1 Tbsp extra flour to reach the mushroom soup consistency we like. Also I  gave the soup a pretty good grind of fresh nutmeg. Although it's a subtle background flavor, I think it's essential. Just before serving, I used my immersion blender for just a few seconds to finely chop some of the mushrooms. Sprinkle @ 1 Tbsp bacon bits on top before serving.This soup is easy to prepare, & delicious!

Fabulous recipe!  I cut the recipe in half except for the flour (I like my soups thick...and honestly would like it thicker) and added garlic but only because my daughter requested Garlic Mushroom Soup.  However, garlic is not necessary!  I will definitely make this again....and again!

This soup is fantastic. I made it with button and oyster mushrooms. I also substituted half the milk with half and half. This will be my mushroom soup from this day forward. Thanks Joe!!

Delish.  I oven roasted the shrooms before slicing and adding to onion mix.  This is really good.  I will make it again.

I had a couple of pounds of mushrooms that I bought from Sam's club and was afraid they'd go bad, so I found this recipe, and OMG this is the best cream of mushroom soup I've ever had!! So, with 2 pounds it's 8 servings and it still made a big pot. The only thing I changed was half heavy cream and half milk instead of using all milk.

Just had this for dinner with salad and crusty bread. Fantastic! the only changes I made was to use stock instead of broth because that is what I had on hand. After adding the nutmeg I used a hand emulsifier to break up the mushroom pieces. I didn't completely puree it, just enough to break up the mushrooms evenly. Husband and kids loved it.

This is soooo good!  Didn’t change much; just added garlic and at very end gave it a shot of sherry.  Yumm.

I really love mushroom soup but most purchased have too much salt. I have made this recipe several times and it is just perfect and thankfully I can enjoy it without worrying about too much salt

Fantastically delicious and easy recipe! Have made multiple times scaled down to four. We prefer thick soup so I generally find it needs 1/4 cup more of flour. And rather than slicing mushrooms, I rough chop. Delicious as written or with a mix of mushrooms. Thank you for the great recipe!

After scaling down to four servings, I followed the recipe and was underwhelmed. I prefer a cream base so If I try it again, I'll use cream instead of all milk and finish with white wine.

I scaled it down for 8 servings.  It then called for 4 cups milk (I used whole milk) and 4 cups chicken stock. I used about two cups of the stock. I like my soup on the thicker side. also added about This recipe is great! Thanks!

Will make again.  Very yummy.  I halved the recipe and used a bit less of the liquid than called for.  I did add some 1/2 and 1/2 since I was using 1.5% milk.  I also used the immersion blender to partially break up the mushrooms.

I made this soup today and was not disappointed! The only change I made was that I used half heavy cream and half 2% for the milk and I did not add the nutmeg (not a big fan of nutmeg). It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

I use this recipe for my cream of mushroom soup whenever I make a casserole. I prefer not to open a can since there is so many preservatives and sodium. The time difference is worth it and as a soup it is just fabulous!

Because I was using skim milk, I added 1/2 cup of half and half.  Because......  what cream soup isn't better with a little extra fat.

Good fast and easy soup with not to many ingredients. That said next time I make it, it’ll be in a slow cooker and let it take it’s time. I made extra so we had leftovers for whenever anyone wanted some and man it was so much better the next day!

I scaled this down to 4 servings, using a combination of sliced shitake and regular mushrooms. I like things spicy, but this had WAY too much pepper for me. I suppose in anything, it's best to add such things to your own taste preference...add less and more if needed. I used half milk and the rest was half-n-half. A delicious and easy soup, one I'm sure to make again. Dzienkuje, Joe!

Very good soup that was extremely easy to make. My family loves it so I'll definitely be making this often. I found I had to use a bit more flour, but other than that followed the recipe. Thank you for a new family fave!
