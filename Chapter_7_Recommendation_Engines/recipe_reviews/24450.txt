Mum Mom used to make this when I was little and it's gone on for years. One day I'll teach my kids how to make them.

3.29.18  I cut this recipe in half, used a 1-1/2‚Äù cookie scoop and ended up with exactly 18 cookies...spot on!  The one thing that I think is desperately missing in this recipe is vanilla extract, and I think it greatly affected flavor, or lack thereof.  The addition of that single ingredient could take this from 4 to 5 stars.
