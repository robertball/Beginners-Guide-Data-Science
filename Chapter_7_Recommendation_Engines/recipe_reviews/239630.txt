Great dish!  After cooking the meat and other ingredients for the recommended length of time, I layered the Fritos and meat topping with cheese and baked for 15 minutes at 375 degrees.  I also added some chopped cilantro. Definitely a repeat!

Fritos Pie Haiku: "Wise man with mouthful. Eats the Fritos, mumbles 'yum'. Yes sir, this is good." I love putting Fritos in the bottom of my bowl b4 spooning my chili in, so I figured this recipe would be a win. And I also love Ranch-style beans. Served mine on a pile of lettuce so my plate wouldn't be so brown, and so I wouldn't eat quite as much as I was strongly tempted into doing.

Instead of ranch-style beans I used a tri-bean mix of black, pinto and kidney beans and I added some fresh jalapeños, crushed red peppers and garlic salt, because we like it spicy... Very easy and good ole school treat

I had a lot of fun making this. I ad libbed just a little bit by adding spicy Doritos all crumbled up and I layered it in a 6 x 10 pan. Like the other person who reviewed I also used kidney beans. This recipe makes a lot so enjoy.

Great recipe. Followed the recipe. I’ve made this a few times and I don’t think it needs adjusting. Very economical meal, and makes a lot of chili with just a pound of beef.

I have never made Fritos pie before. 
This recipe is a great one only I had to tone down the chilli powder and added sweet peppers instead of green peppers.... Bon Appetit we will

Thanks

I just had dental surgery so I was unable to try this dish when I made it. my husband on the other hand really liked this and told me I needed to make it again.
