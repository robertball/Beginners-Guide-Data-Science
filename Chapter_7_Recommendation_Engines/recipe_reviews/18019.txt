My 6-year old loves pepperoni pizza, so I made this as a pre-birthday treat.  I make my own pizza dough and had some leftover, so I used it instead of the frozen bread dough.  Here's a tip to help avoid excess grease (especially if you are a pepperoni purist like me and won't use turkey pepperoni) - lay pepperoni out on a double layer of paper towels and microwave for 15 - 20 seconds, then cover with 2 more paper towels and blot.  I do this when I make pizza and had very little grease when I baked my bread.  Brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with a little garlic powder and kosher salt before baking.  Great appetizer - I'll be making this for Super Bowl.

I started with fresh pizza dough from my grocery store which makes this a quick & easy weeknight meal. I omitted the egg step(not needed), then added a thin layer of fresh baby spinach to sneak in some veggies & substituted some prosciutto for half of the pepperoni. I also drizzled with olive oil & sprinkled with more Italian seasoning & a little grated parmesan cheese. I served with marinara sauce to dip. Very good results!

This always goes over well at my parties - there's never any left over.  I usually use Pillsbury French Loaf instead of the frozen bread dough (it takes less time to cook), and I have substituted turkey pepperoni for the regular.  I actually like the turkey pepperoni better, because it make the pepperoni bread less greasy.  My most finicky eaters never knew the difference.

This receipe turned out quite well.  I added some pizza sauce to it and used Pillsbury's French loaf which cut the baking time in half.

I've made this 3 times now.  I've used frozen italian bread loaves and also pizza crust frozen bread loaves. Both worked fine. I add garlic powder to the egg mixture and coat heavy on the inside and lightly on the outside.  Whatever you like on your pizza, throw it in there!  I like to use deli sliced pepperoni, mushrooms, green olives, mild peppers and mozarella sliced or shredded.  We dip it in pizza sauce or ranch dressing.  Great "game day" meal.  Passed the picky husband test and you can't beat that!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Don't forget to brush with the egg! You'll get a puffy dome and everything else will sink to the bottom. Still tastes wonderful, but didn't help the presentation. =) Will definitely make again.

Highly recommended recipe. First I used a recipe for pizza dough that I found on this site to make the dough in the bread machine.  As the bread becomes close to being done, I brushed the outside with a melted butter / garlic powder mixture for a great taste!

This was good sliced, spread with pizza sauce, and heated.  It would be nice to know how large of a rectangle to roll the dough before adding ingredients.  Next time I'll use more cheese.

So yummy!  Made homemade bread using a calzone recipe and added italian spices to the dough instead of to the filling.  Had several partial block of cheese so I ended up finishing off some cheddar, mozzarella & romano into the filling.  Turned out great.  Thought it might be too dry without any sauce, but it is actually very moist!  Great quick & easy recipes!

Delicious!!  My family and I love it!  We will have this bread Christmas Eve with Oyster Stew!  The turkey Pepperoni made the bread delicious, but not greasy.  So easy to make and perfect to make with children, as they can help place all the goodies on the bread!  Only one tip, if you hope to get 10 servings out of the recipe, double it!  My husband and I finished 1/2 the loaf ourselves!

this bread is excellent and so easy to make.  I used the Pillsbury French loaf, doubled the amount of pepperoni and mozzarella, added garlic powder to the beaten egg, and also added some browned Italian sausage.  I also brushed the egg/garlic mixture on the surface of the dough, and it browns up nicely and makes the bread extra crunchy.  I didn't think the pepperoni made the bread too greasy.  The next day, we reheated the leftovers in the toaster.

I have also tried making this bread with the Pillsbury refrigerated pizza dough.  It gives it a chewier texture, which we like.  Since the pizza dough is smaller than the french loaf, it took less than 30 minutes to bake.  This is a good option when cooking for 2 people or less.

My favorite variation of this recipe is to spread pesto all over the inside of the dough (instead of the egg mixture) and topping it with pepperoni and cheeses.  It takes the flavor to a whole nother level.  However, because of all the olive oil in the pesto, you need to make sure the bread is completely sealed.  Otherwise, the oil will leak out (but that's also really good since it makes the bottom of the bread very crunchy!)

This is very simple and easy. I didn't use the egg but did use tomato sauce. I did not roll the bread, infact I used fresh french bread. I didn't have to bake as long either.

This recipe is awesome. I have never made pepperoni bread(or any other bread for that matter). It was easy and the results were great.
 Everyone at our Thanksgiving gathering were 'guinea pigs'.  I made it, did not taste beforehand, everyone commented on how good it was.
They loved it. 
This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very easy to make.  Used Pillsbury French Loaf, and it came out perfectly.  However, it definitely needs 2x the amount of mozzarella!  And a marinara dipping sauce is a must!

This came out excellent. My wife said it was the best she'd ever had! The only thing I did different was that I melted butter over the top at 40 minutes and baked it for 3 more. - perfecto!

Hint: It's VERY important that you roll the dough out thin, but not too thin. I rolled one of mine too thick and it was really dry tasting. I rolled the other one too thin and the sauce was coming through. Be careful!

This stuff is fantastic.  You can put anything that you like on pizza in it.  It's especially good with Italian sausage.  Instead of putting tomato sauce inside, as some commenters suggested, use it as a dip on the side.  Kids LOVE it!

HOT DOG, this was GOOD!  My husband, who usually says everything is "fine" actually called this "outstanding"!

I thought this was very, very good.  Next time I will put sauce in it, just to see how it turns out.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!

This was delicious.  I used Pillsbury pizza crust (classic, not thin) and cooked for 25 minutes at 375 degrees and it came out perfect.  40 minutes would have been way too long.  Other reviews mention increasing the cheese and/or pepperoni but I think it's great the way it is.  You can actually pick it up and eat it with your fingers.  If there were any more filling it would be messier and would require a fork.

This is A-W-E-S-O-M-E (did I mention this is AWESOME??!!!??!)!!!!! Made this for my bf and I Sun. night. I wasn't in the mood to make anything elaborate and this fit the bill perfectly! Other than subbing Pillsbury refrigerated Italian bread for frozen bread dough, using deli-sliced pepperoni (as opposed to using the small "pizza" rounds) and adding ~ 1.5 t garlic powder to my beaten egg (which I only used about half of...) I followed Martha's directions to a T. I was thinking of spreading some pizza sauce over my bread dough (before layering the pepperoni/cheeses), but decided not to - and I'm glad I did. If you decide to do this, BE SURE to use a VERY small amount, otherwise, your bread will end up soggy. Oh, I also brushed the outside of my "pre-baked" loaf with some of my egg wash and sprinkled with a bit of mozza/parm cheese, but the end product would have been just as delicious without these additions (IMHO). I baked my bread at 350 degrees for 27 minutes (according to the directions on the loaf of refrigerated dough). My bread was golden brown and slightly crispy (which is just the way we like it!). Served with Italian pasta salad and some pizza sauce for dunking! Thanks for sharing this EASY and DEEELICIOUS recipe!!! My bf said that this was the best thing I've made in a while :) I will definitely be making this often!

I've used the basic recipe for years..Thanks to my mom. I always add a thin layer of sauce..usually leftover from spaghetti dinner early in the week.
I also sprinkle a little bit of garlic salt on top of the bread..gives it a good flavor.
yum!

I love this fun and easy recipe. Tastes great and I like not having to measure anything. I just add as much cheese and pepperoni as I like and we're good to go. I also like adding a bit of mozzarella on top of the bread w/ a dash of italian seasoning. I served this with buffalo wings and used maranira sauce for dipping the bread. This recipe is definetly a keeper. Thanks!!!

Sooooo good, both family and friends loved it.  I added garlic to the beaten egg and also brushed the outside of the roll with the egg mixture.  I made 2 rolls--one using only turkey pepperoni and cheese and one with turkey pepperoni, ricotta cheese, olives, mushrooms and double the amount of mozzerella cheese.  Everyone liked the second roll better.

This has potential but something made it too sweet.  I think it may have been the bread - we used a Pillsbury French Loaf.  It had a hint of sweetness and I didn't like that aspect of it at all.

Wonderful!! I used my breadmaker to make pizza dough. Then used the dough for the pepporoni bread.  I didn't use the egg wash. Also mine did not take 40 minutes, mine was done in 20 minutes. I made this for a Friday nite supper and my kids loved it. I used 1 can tomato sauce, 1 clove garlic, 1 tsp of Italian Seasoning covered in microwave for 1-2 minutes. Fish out the garlic and you'll have an excellent mariara or pizza sauce.(Racheal Ray's recipe)!! I'm making this again tomarrow for Super Bowl, at my hubby's request!! Great recipe!!

This pepperoni bread is a HUGE hit at my fiance's work Christmas party every year. They tell me I can't come unless I bring the bread! However, I will give a few suggestions (that I got from others on here) on how I make it and it is delicious. First, I use the Pillsbury French Loaf. Now, it can be a little stressful rolling it out because sometimes it gets really sticky, but I find if you keep it in the fridge until the second you are going to unroll it, it's fine (also flouring your hands helps too). I also use turkey pepperoni instead of the regular pepperoni. It doesn't make the bread greasy and it tastes just as good. Also, once it's all rolled up, I brush the egg wash on top of the dough and sprinkle it with some parmesan cheese and the bread comes out nice and golden when baked for about 20 minutes. This is the perfect way to make this pepperoni bread and it will be a hit! People will be begging you to make it for all occasions!

Great idea - super easy. I used a little more of the pepperoni and cheeses than called for because that's what I'm like. I egg-washed the top of the bread and sprinkled a little parmesan on it. My 15yo said, "Huh. We should have this more often." So we will. Thanks! :)

My husband and daughter loved this bread.  I barely got a piece.  Two things I changed.  1. I did not use the egg basically because I forgot. 2. I cut the pepperoni slices into small pieces and sprinkled on with the cheese.  I served this with homemade marinara. This is a keeper. Thanks Martha

Awesome, I didn't use the frozen loaf of bread but used Pillsbury pizza dough because that's what I had in the house. I followed the rest of the recipe and served it with a small bowl of marinara sauce.

I have already made this twice in the last two days and have ingredients for a third! I used a pillsbury french loaf and brushed on the egg, then sprinkled on the italian seasoning. I then put on the mozzarella then parmesan so they could melt on the bread, then topped with the sliced pepperoni. The second time i made this i put on the italian seasoning and rolled it into a ball and then rolled it out with a rolling pin so the seasoning could be in the bread. Delicious!

I used the Italian Bread For The Bread Machine resipe from this site, instead of frozen bread dough and added more pepperoni.  This was the final recipe in our untraditional thanksgiving dinner for this year and it was GONE IN 10 MIN'S!  When I removed it from the oven, the seam had not held well and it looked a bit odd, but that simply didn't matter.  It smelled so good, our family and friends were eating it before the lasagna was done!  GREAT recipe!

Wonderful bread but I was a little disappointed that she used frozen bread. It's much better if you use one of the Italian herb bread recipes on allrecipes. Gives it a whole lot of flavor. Kind of tastes like a calazone.

Great recipe! I used bread dough I made in my bread machine instead of the frozen variety. I also diced the pepperoni. My friends and family loved it.

I used the Pillbury French Bread in my first attempt. I thought I could roll this out to be a rectangle but couldn't seem to. It was too narrow and long. So I cut it in half widthwise and made it wider that way. It didn't "look" that good as the seam where I joined the two came apart. :(

However, my husband LOVED it! 

My next attempt was using the Pillsbury Pizza dough. This rolled out nicely to a rectangle. My husband still liked it but it didn't have quite the same taste as the French bread. If I make it again (which I most likely will), I'll either use the French bread or try making bread from scratch.

Really good and turned out about twice the size I was expecting!  My husband requested I make it again the next day so we can keep it in the fridge for him to nibble on.  I served mine with pizza sauce for dipping and I did use the frozen bread dough.  I sprinkled a little parmesan on top before baking and will definitely make again!

I made this using TI2GR's herbed Italian bread recipe instead of the frozen white bread dough called for, which gave the recipe a definite flavor boost.  I followed the measurements for the filling exactly - there was enough pepperoni but not enough cheese - will double that next time. Instead of using the beaten egg, I spread the bread dough with olive oil and sprinkled that with Italian herb seasoning.  This is the perfect nosh to take to a concert in the park.  Will make again.

This was just ok for us. It was fun to make and came out just beautifully, but I think there's too much dough vs filling. Also, the Italian seasoning was a bit overpowering. A spectacular marinara dipping sauce wasn't enough to sell this for me and may have upped the star value for Hubs.

Once your bread is thawed, this takes only minutes to make.  I am glad that I checked on it before the 40 minutes because mine was golden brown and perfectly cooked in only 25.  Four of us had 1 loaf gone in less than 10 minutes.  Awesome!

This was so easy to make and everyone loved it! I didn’t measure any of the ingredients, I just added the amount of cheese, pepperoni and seasoning that I wanted. I think it would be good with a few black olives and fresh mushrooms added to it. I forgot to brush the inside with egg the first time I made it but tried the egg on the inside the second time. Really didn't see any difference in the outcome so the next time I will forego the egg wash on the inside. I brushed the outside with an egg wash and baked it for 20 minutes, removed it from the oven and brushed it with a mixture of melted butter, garlic salt, Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese.  Returned it to the oven and continued baking for the remaining 20 minutes.  Dipped in a jarred pizza sauce and served with a nice salad this makes a nice “simple” meal. Kids loved it as well as the adults. One recipe is plenty for mom and the kids but if dad’s home you might want to make 2.

This was an easy and fun recipe.  I used a refrigerated thin crust pillsbury dough, which worked really well.  It was baked through after about 15 minutes and tasted great!

This was gobbled up fast at my party last night and it was very easy to make. I could not find any frozen bread dough at any grocery stores so I ended up getting pre-made pizza crust from Trader Joe's (Not sure if they have that outside of California) and it turned out wonderfully! I'll be making this again for sure.

This was great and easy.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used the Pillsbury French bread loaf and it cut down on a lot of time.  I also made this bread with just grilled veggies makes a good meatless alternative and you can really put whatever you want in there.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great football food! 5 stars for the idea alone. I used the Pillsbury Italian loaf refrigerated bread dough and starting at the seam was able to unroll it into a rectangle, brushed with the egg and made layers using Genoa salami, provolone cheese and swiss cheese (thats what I had in the fridge) rolled it up and put on sheet, brushed top with egg. Baked about 20 minutes at 350. Yum! Can't wait to try it with the pepperoni.

I altered this recipe by using refrigerated pizza dough stretched/rolled out almost to jelly roll pan size, placed 5 slices mozzarella cheese and pepperoni down the long middle, then folded the two outside thirds over the center third and tucked the outside seam under the roll. Then brushed on 1 tbsp melted butter and sprinkled with italian seasoning, parmesan and garlic powder.  Baked at 375 for 20 - 25 mins.  Made two the first time with no leftovers, made three last night with enough left for one lunch.  Makes a wonderful take along "fast food" dinner for our busy family of five (two teens, one pre-teen).

Yummy!!!  I used Rhodes bread dough which you can find at the super center.  I've made it twice once exactly like the recipe - and once with marinara sauce instead of the egg.  Both were delicious!  Mine baked in 20-25 minutes.  Everyone thought it was amazing!!! Mmm...

This is a very tasty recipe and was enjoyed by my large family.I did make my own bread dough which added to the time it took to prepare but it was well worth the wait.I also had to cut the baking time down to about 2o-25 min.in my electric oven.I also rubbed margarine and sprinkled garlic powder over the tops of the hot rolls when they came out of the oven. I will most definitely make this recipe again and again! Thanks

My kids really loved this. I may have rolled these the wrong way though. I rolled them from the wide end and I think they should have been rolled up from the shorter end so it would hve more rolling up. I was getting frustrated at the rolling part. They were really good anyway.And I will definately make it again. Thanks!!!

This came out very well.  My kids (teenagers) loved it.  Used Pillsbury thin pizza crust, microwaved pepperoni on paper towels first to get rid of grease and did the rest as they recommended.  First time making it I didnt put any pizza sauce in it.  2nd time I did put a little bit and I prefer it without.  I also prebaked the crust for a few minutes like the package recommended to try and keep the center from being mushy and it worked pretty well.  Dont overcook though---it will cook.  Browns golden with the egg whites brushed on!!

Easy peasy- used prepared pizza dough from local grocery store, layered everything up, rolled it up, and baked (mine was done in like 20 min).  Took it out of oven and to a friend's house covered in a kitchen towel to keep warm.  This ended up being a very good thing because it actually kept some of the moisture in as it cooled and softened up the crust which had been quite hard when I took it out of oven.  Great recipe- it was gone in like 15 min!!  Plan to make a few at a time, then can keep one in the freezer to reheat when needed!

Fabulous. It's a great recipe because you can mix it up how you want. The first one I made I added some colby jack cheese but kept to the rest. The second one I made, I added green peppers to. I'd like to try it with some spinach and pesto sometime. Yum!

YUM YUM YUM!  I made this for a work potluck and it was the first thing to disappear...and it was the very first time I made it.  It's so easy and delicious.  One coworker called it incredible.  I'm making it again right now for my husband because I didn't bring him home any leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy.Of course I changed a few things to make it even easier.     I made two batches but I used the pillsbury pizza dough for both. When I just followed the recipe, the bread was a bit dry. For my second batch I brushed some sauce on the inside of the dough and after it was rolled, more on the outside. I thought it was much more moist but not really saucy. Thanks for the idea!

Great recipe!  I ended up making three in one day.  Family said they liked it better than delivered pizza.  I used french bread dough from a tube.  Rolled it out and sprinkled dried italian herbs and garlic powder.  Then sprinkled on parmesan cheese followed by turkey pepperoni and grated mozzarella cheese.  Rolled it up and lightly brushed it with olive oil, dried italian herbs and very small sprinkling of kosher salt.  After it was cooked, dipped slices in marinara sauce.  I will make this over and over again!

So, so good. Microwave the pepperoni was a great idea. I did it for 15seconds. I also use pizza dough, all ready thawed. It only took 20 minutes to cook. I brushed the outside with egg, because it has protein and will brown. I was afraid the oil would have burned. I sprinkeled a lot of garlic powder, and little bit of basil and oregano. I sprinkled the basil and oregano a little more heavily in the inside. This is a keeper and will make again. So simple.

I love this bread and have made it several times. I use Pillsbury thin crust pizza dough and it makes this a very quick and easy meal! I spread olive oil on the dough, then sprinkle the italian seasonings, cover with the cheese an pepperoni and roll it up. After brushing the top of the roll with egg white, I top with onion flakes and more italian seasonings! It smells delicious as it bakes and is sooo good!

The bread (used pillsbury french loaf) was WAY too sweet for the recipe.  The bread in the middle never really got finished cooking- I left it in the oven about ten more minutes trying to get the bread in the middle done but  that made the top of it too dark.  There was too much bread in the recipe anyway.  The italian seasoning was overwhelming.. way too much of that as well.  This was not at all what I expected. We did not enjoy this at all and I do not plan to make it again.

This is awesome!!! I used a Pillsbury pizza crust and turkey peperoni. Not only did I brush the inside dough with egg I also brushed the outside with egg and that gave a nice glaze. I will be making this again and again! FYI, if your pizza crust/bread dough develops a rip as mine did just cut some of the excess dough off the end and patch it up.

DELISH!!! I made so many mistakes while making this & it STILL turned out GREAT!!! Couldn't get enough of it. My daughter had a sleepover and instead of ordering pizza we made 'pizza bread' of course we added extra meats, it was FAB!! Thanks for this, I'll be making this over & over again! :-)

These were pretty tasty but I have some advice. We used the garlic cresent rolls, and I don't at ALL advise this. The garlic flavor really overpowered the rolls. Also we used reduced fat pepperoni and it was fairly dry. Next time we'll probably use the regular pepperoni or more cheese. Also, we used 1/2 slice of provolone for the rolls and this came out really great. The flavor and texture of the provolone was wonderful. We didn't really like the texture of the cresent rolls but had difficulty finding a loaf of dough or pizza dough. Had we the option, I would have used a tougher, thicker dough.

My kids enjoyed this more than my husband did.  I didn't have time to thaw out bread dough, so I took someone's advice and used the refrigerated, Pillsbury bread loaf that comes in a can.  It didn't roll out very well and was difficult to roll up.  I think the dough was a bit too gooey and thin.  We ended up with a crazy looking loaf of pepperoni bread, but it still tasted okay.  I made it again, but this time I used crescent rolls, pinching the ends closed, and those turned out pretty good.  If I make this again any time soon, I think I will try it with the frozen bread dough.

I sometimes will add bacon bits on top of pepperoni and I use the reduced fat pillsbury croissant. My husband loves it!

I have made this recipe for years now for every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It's truly a hit with adults as well as kids.  this year I made one with sausage as well and the pepperoni one was still the hit.  I am requested to bring it for New Year's Day! I always use pizza dough instead of bread dough and it comes out perfect!  I usually let the dough rise for an hour or so before rolling it.  I will definitely try turkey pepperoni next time....

We really liked this. It is very easy and you can make it so many different ways. You definitely have to have some marinara sauce for dipping. I used the Pillsbury loaf recommended by other reviewers. I also used more italian seasoning to suit our taste. My husband asked why I didn't make more than one : ) Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I usually use both ham and pepperoni and both swiss/mozzarella and cheddar cheese. For my hobby I add jalapenos. Also I brush the top of dough with beaten egg and sprinkle the top with sesame seeds. Everybody always loves it. This is very versatile rec, u can add whatever you have on hand and it will taste great.

used pillbury french bread loaf -- makes it easy because you can unroll the loaf. the kids and adults loved this; i also made one with soy cheese and meatless pepperoni and it was just as successful. i don't think you need the egg. but i think using pizza or marinara sauce as a dip is a great idea because it was dry. a fast, easy, and fun treat.

I used 2 of the Pillsbury French Loaves.  I couldn't quite figure out how to unroll the dough so I just doubled it up and used a rolling pin on it to flatten it out.  I spread a bit of pizza sauce on each rectangle, sprinkled some minced garlic on, turkey pepperoni, mozzarella and parmesan.  I forgot the Italian seasoning!  It still turned out great.  Be sure to watch the oven if you use the Pillsbury French Loaf.  It cuts the cooking time down to about 20 minutes.  Yummy!

First of all I had to use a ball of frozen pizza dough because that is all I could find at the supermarket. For never having worked with it before once I got it rolled out to almost jelly roll pan size it was a super easy dish. I forgot to add the parmesan in the filling but it was still delicious. Made this for a super bowl party and it was scarfed up. Before baking, I brushed the top w/ olive oil and sprinkled italian seasoning, garlic salt and parmesan on. Will definately be making again.

This was fabulous.  Instead of frozen bread dough, I made my own (Italian Bread Baked on a Pizza Stone from this site).  I made a couple of small changes -- after rolling it, I put it on a pizza stone and placed it in a warm oven for 30 minutes to rise just a bit.  Also sprinkled with a little garlic powder before baking for 35 minutes.  Amazing!!

i have to admit, i cheated.  i used the pilsbury french bread out of a can, unrolled it, added a bit of pizza sauce i had left, and it was great.  i did not roll it, i made diaganol slits in the bread and criss-crossed them.  great recipe thanks.

Real good substitute for pepperoni rolls (a local delicacy). Hint: Use homemade bread dough, and go heavy on the parmesan. I like to slice the pepperoni bread thick, coat with pizza sauce and toast in the oven for a few minutes. Try adding some hot pepper sauce to the pepperoni layer before baking for a nice change.

Awesome & easy!  Using frozen dough tasted fine to me.  I used less parm. cheese, and had to reduce the baking time to 25 minutes because my oven cooks fast, but otherwise I left it exactly the same and my husband raved about it!  A definate keeper!

This was very good. I could eat the whole loaf by myself if I wanted to. It was tricky actaully rolling the dough because the cheese would spill out to the sides but I will definitely make this again.

The first time I made this recipe it turned out really dry.  I tried it again today and instead of using the egg I used olive oil on the inside of the dough before adding the pepperoni and cheese.  After I rolled it up, I put olive oil on the outside and sprinkled it with garlic powder. It turned out so much better than the first time I made it.  Also keep an eye on the baking time. Mine was finished around 30 minutes.

like a few others have mentioned, i wasn't sure how large the rectangle should be. I made one large log (rolled a few times), but the inside seemed to be raw and doughy...overall taste was ok. Needs a lot of garlic in my opinion. I'll try it again and make two logs and will add about 1 tsp of garlic powder over the top.

i used a pillsbury french bread roll in the refrigerator section, which cut the cooking time by 15-20mins. My family really liked this esp. my picky toddler. The italian seasoning was too much for my bf and I.  i'll be making it without any next time. thanks for the good, fast, recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I had no idea making pepperoni bread was this easy.  I got 2 pizza dough balls from my local pizzeria.  Each ball will make 2 nice size loaves.  Before the first 2 could even completely cool my family had devoured them.  I was glad I got an extra.  Great dipped in marinara sauce.  Thanks, I will be making this regularly.

Not flavorful enough.  Still good, but I will add more cheese and some more italian seasoning next time.  Also want to play with the crust a bit....my bread dough puffed up a bit...wasn't as dense as I would have preferred.

Nice outcome.  Used the Ricardo's Pizza Crust recipe and added a little bit of tomato sauce.  My husband loves bread and pizza so this was a great combo.  When I made it a second time I just used some refrigerated biscuits for the dough and we had little individual rolls.  Also ran out of shredded cheese, but used string cheese and that worked pretty well.

The flavor of this was just ok=( I don't know why we didn't like it. I did everything exactly like the recipe stated and still didn't have great results. The bread was over cooked on the outside and not done enough on the inside. It seamed like a lot of bread with little filling to me. I'm sorry, but I won't be making this one again=(

This bread is wonderful! Not only is it easy to make, it tastes great and looks beautiful! I didn't have any frozen bread dough, so I used the recipe for Italian Bread II on this site and made my own. My family really enjoyed this; some of them liked it dipped in tomato sauce. Thanks for such a tasty recipe!

This recipe is awesome! I'm 13 and I go to a farmer's market and sell baked goods. This is always the first item to go! I do not add the Italian seasoning though, and I brush the top of the bread with a little bit of the beaten-up egg so it gets a nice brown sheen as it bakes.  If you use home-made pizza dough like me, make sure the dough is not to sticky, or else it gets hard to roll up. I've also substituted salami for the pepperoni, and that was a big hit!

This was really quick and easy after you get the bread thawed.  I used a regular frozen bread dough, and it turned out really nice.  Make sure you squeeze your seams securely.  Mine ended up coming undone and exposing some of the innards, but the cheese just browned at that part so it almost enhanced the deliciousness.  A great bread to freeze and have on hand for salad/pasta night when it's too hot to cook.

This was amazing.  So easy to make and tasted wonderful.  I was surprised that you don't use pizza sauce in the recipe, but after making, it's not needed.  Highly recommend the egg.  Makes it look beautiful and not flour coated. ewww.  Perfect reciept just the way it is!  YUM.

Quick and easy.  I used pillsbury pizza dough, lite sausage and pepperoni.  It took 10 minutes to assemble and I baked 25 minutes.  Will make again for a quick weeknight dinner or snacktizer for family gettogether.

I couldn't find my pepperoni bread recipe so I used this one.  My picky husband loved it.  I used the french bread dough as suggested and instead of egg, I used a mixture of melted butter italian seasoning and garlic powder.  I also added hot sausage.  After I wrapped the dough, I brushed the outside of it with the butter mixture.  It was tasty.  Next time I'll try with different cheeses.

I made this tonight using a pizza crust recipe from this site; I used a mozz/cheddar mix shredded cheese, and much more than 1 cup - easily two; used almost an entire 6 oz pkg of pepperoni, and threw in some fresh sliced mushrooms. We didn't have italian seasoning, so I just sprinkled some basil, oregano and rosemary over the layers, instead. I also mixed in some garlic powder with the beaten egg and brushed on inside and over the top. This rolled up nicer than expected, i was extremely pleased. Topped with a sprinkle of parmesan, basil and oregano and BAM! What a hit this was - we also served with marinara for dipping, which really made it, in my opinion. Thank you!

Amazing!!!! I made this as an appetizer and my husband ate so much he had to skip dinner! For a few changes, I used prepared refrigerated pizza dough (it stretches so nicely to the size whatever size you want) and for filling I used pepperoni, ham, mozzarella and swiss cheese. The taste was unbelievable and I have requests to make it again soon!

good!  I used the pillsbury french loaf instead of the bread dough so it only took 30 min.  I also only used 2 oz. of pepperoni and that was more than enough.  I couldnt imagine using 4 oz.  I added some tomato sauce also to the dough after brushing it with the egg, then layered my italian seasoning, pepperoni and mozarella.

Growing up, my grandma would take me to this great corner bakery near her house that sold amazing pepperoni bread.  This isn't nearly as good but it's close.  I used turkey pepperoni instead and pizza dough instead of bread dough.  My husband and best friend loved it.  Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe exactly as it was called for except that like many reveiwers, I used the Pillsbury refrigerated french loaf instead of the frozen bread dough.  It did cut baking time significantly, and tastes great!! The pepperoni bread came out wonderfully, and I will definately be making it again.  I can't wait to try different things with it, and switch up the ingredients a little bit; it's a very flexible and YUMMY recipe!!

Excellent. I used homemade bread (Mama D's Italian bread), from this site and it worked wonderfully. I also warmed up some homemade sauce that my husband and I made earlier in the week and dipped the bread into and it was fabulous!!

sooo good!  i added chopped scallions, chopped mushrooms, browned Johnsonville sweet italian sausage, and seasoned with garlic powder and a pint of salt in my beaten eggs.  together with the cheese, this was definitely salty enough just to eat on its own so i didnt see a need for a marinara sauce dip and instead i just used good quality extra virgin olive oil as a dip.  i took the suggestion of other  reviewers and used pillsbury french loaf and turkey pepperoni to cut down on the grease.  so delicious im still thinking about how great it tasted.  next time i will try with chopped purple onions and olives

LOVED IT! And so did everyone else.  I made two loaves and they were gone in no time.  I did one with pepperoni and one without.  I used the pillsbury dough rather than the frozen kind so it didn't take as long to bake either.  Served it with pizza sauce for dipping.  I will make this one again, I'm sure!

I used crescent rolls (gave it a much lighter, fluffier taste) and added italian seasoning & garlic salt.  About 5 minutes before it came out of the oven, I sprayed it with butter spray and sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

I have made this with both the frozen white bread dough and the Pillsbury French loaf and both are yummy!  Most of the time I use the Pillsbury because I like to be able to make it without planning.  Turkey pepperoni is also really good in this recipe because it cuts down on the grease.  Dip in your favorite pizza sauce and you are set!

What the girls didn't eat at the slumber party, they finished the next morning!  This is a very versatile snack; there is no limit to the things you can add.  I served marinara for dipping on the side and added a lot more mozzarella.

Excellent bread!  I had no parmesan so substituted a handful of cheddar instead and used Pillsbury pizza crust instead of frozen bread dough. Definitely do not cook for more than 25 minutes if you make the dough substitution. This will be added immediately to the recipe box.  Thank you.

Just wanted to add I have now made this as described using the Rhodes bread with actually even better results. Next time I might take it out of the fridge (after thawing overnight) a little earlier so it can rise before being rolled out. Great recipe.

My family loved this!  We made it as a snack but we decided that this could be a quick delicious meal during the week; just add a salad.  It was super easy with wonderful results!  Another idea that we are going to try is to make cheese garlic bread in this same manner.  Thank you for sharing.

I had a last minute function and needed a crowd-pleaser to pass, so I chose this recipe since it appeared to be the simplest with the least amount of ingredients to purchase or dig out of my cabinet. I started with fresh pizza dough from the grocer rather than frozen due to my time constraint. Roll, twirl, repeat, easy. Then I grabbed every partial pack of cheese in my fridge and loaded it on. (white American, parmesan, mozzarella, & provolone). Then I layered it with turkey pepperoni (zero grease factor), sprinkled it with Italian seasoning, rolled it up tight, cut a few steam holes in the top, rubbed a bit of egg, then sprinkled a bit of cheese & a bit more seasoning, and popped it in the oven. Two loaves fit on a large cookie sheet with non-stick foil on the bottom to catch any oozing cheese. I also made a meat-free version with pesto sauce and cheese. I sliced it in one inch sections, wrapped in in foil, an headed to the tailgate party. Four large loaves of this pizza bread were inhaled in less than 30 minutes. This recipe is definitely a great way to use up leftovers in the fridge. I'm thinking about trying a breakfast version for trips. Anyway, best wishes...Enjoy!

This was awesome! I made some changes though that me and my friends really liked. instead of using bread dough I just used pizza crust. Then i just cut that into strips to roll everything in. I guess they are more like pizza roles this way but it's amazing! You'll want to set the oven to about 350 if using pizza crust and cook for about 20 minutes or until golden brown on top. I also added garlic powder and green peppers! Marinara to dip is good but also an Alfredo dip is delicious!

This is very similar to the Pepperoni Bread I have made for years.  I recommend grinding the pepperoni in a food processor rather than using the round slices (the loaf rolls easier and makes a nicer presentation when the bread is sliced).   My recipe is a little bit more simple; I use the frozen bread dough but I brush the rolled dough on the inside with a minced garlic paste before the main ingredients are added and just use pepperoni and shredded provolone cheese, roll the dough lengthwise (from the long side) and brush the loaf with egg to get a nice golden, shiny finished product.

Used Pillsbury dough that you roll out (the only difference) and it was good.  Think using regular bread dough would be better!  Dipped it in pizza sauce after!

I used the thawed bread dough. I brushed with the egg, but I don't know why..?? I just did it because it said to. (I don't cook) But this is so easy that even I can do it. I used ham, turkey, pepperoni, and salami for the meat and used sharp cheddar, pepper jack, and parmesan cheese. I layered them all, rolled it up. Seam on bottom and baked for about 35 min. I did spray a little pam olive oil on the top and sprinkled a little garlic salt before it went into the oven.
It turned out wonderful!

My husband looooved this and I was pretty happy about it as well. I used pizza dough I had in my fridge already and baked for 25 minutes. Fantastic. Next time I will try it with bread dough, if I can find some frozen stuff anywhere. The store I regularly go to does not carry it.

This was amazing! It tasted just like the pepperoni bread you would buy in a bakery. My boyfriend and I devoured the load even though it was a little burnt. I boughty a country loaf and mistakenly cooked it for the normal time that this recipe calls for. If your looking for a nice snack to make, you should definitely try this recipe out.

I love this recipe.  I sautéed in olive oil garlic and several varieties of "slightly on the hot side" peppers that had been chopped and spread that mixture over the bread before the pepperoni.  I skipped the egg wash inside the bread because of the olive oil.  I also didn't use any cheese.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is great, and going into regular rotation. I used Pillsbury pizza dough and added salami along with the pepperoni. It was tough to resist adding olives, mushrooms and sauce but it worked out beautifully.

I made this for dinner with my boyfriend and it was absolutely delicious! The only difference we made was, right before putting it in the oven, we brushed some melted butter over the top and put the Italian seasoning on top of that instead of inside of the bread and, about two minutes before it was done cooking, we sprinkled more cheese over the top because we like a lot of cheese, haha. Deliziosa!

AMAZING! What a cool idea! MY husband the pizza fiend found them perfectly enjoyable and is requesting that I make these twice a week, once for his lunches and once for his dinners! I think I am going to start experimenting with them and add other ingredients than the pepperoni too! SO much fun!

This was a yummy "starter" recipe.  I used my own bread dough from scratch, but followed the recipe as written after that.  Was good.  Next time I made with more fillings, as my family asked for more!  Definitely a good one!

This was a quick, easy recipe that tastes fantastic.  Don't forget to brush beaten egg on dough first before putting on pepperoni, cheeses, & spices.  Just before putting in the oven I sprinkled italian seasonings and parmesan cheese on top then baked.  YUMMY!!  Thanks Martha!!

This was a huge hit! Everyone at my house loved it, including my picky little brother (who also has stomach problems.. this didn't affect him at all). I used frozed dinner rolls and let them defrost/rise over night then rolled that. The next time I tried it, I used a gluten free bread mix (I didn't have time to defrost bread and I don't have some at home) and it just was awful. It doesn't let you roll it like a jelly roll. So, be mindful of which bread you use

I used pillsbury Italian bread dough and I thought it was too heavy.  My husband loved it.  The ingrediants are great, i just have to find the right dough to make it with.
Update:   I made it with Pillsbury thin crust pizza dough...EXCELLENT!  increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars.

Very good,  my only complaint was that the bread seemed kinda hollow, like it didn't rise all the way.  It was crispy on the outside, but there wasn't much on the inside as far as bread.  I do agree with removing as much grease as possible from the pepperoni first.  My kids loved it!

This was amazing and very easy to make. I did make a few changes/additions. I used the Pilsbury thin crust pizza dough and brushed the dough with about 1/2 of pizza sauce, also added some green peppers and mushrooms. It was done in about 25 minutes and delicious.

I have been making this recipe for years! The last time I used the French Bread recipe from this site and it was even better.  I spread the pepperoni between paper towels and place a weight on top (usually a cook book) and let sit for about 1/2 hr. to absorb some of the grease.  I have also subbed thin slices of cooked eggplant for the pepperoni for vegetarians and the meat eaters have gobbled that up as well.

This recipe has been in our family for about 26 years. Im one of 4 children and It was always our favorite meal to make as a family. If you have young kids, participating in this together is half the fun.

I've made this recipe 3 times now and it has come out great each time.  I use the recipe "Pizza Dough 1" from this site instead of frozen.  The first 2 times I added Italian Herbs and Spices to the dough but the kids weren't crazy so this time I made a kid version with no spices..

Made my own pizza dough then followed the recipe, rolled it up pretty tight so there wouldn't a lot of air pockets, then brushed with remaining egg wash and sprinkled with garlic powder and a little parm cheese.  Very very good... and no air pockets!

Great recipe! Be sure not to overextend your dough and be sure to seal up the edges really well! I ended up with a "pepperoni bread aneurysm" it was ugly but delicious! And for those of you who have not yet tried turkey pepperoni, it's wonderful, give it a try!

This was OK only - I added pizza sauce in side, I'm glad I did or I think it would have been dry.  If I Make again, I will try to roll tighter.  After it finished baking (I let is sit for 10 minutes before cutting) there was alot of air between the layers.

Excellent, quick, easy, and had great flavor too! I used pizza crust from a can and it was ready to go, no rolling out needed. I brushed the top with the egg wash too and sprinkled garlic salt on very lightly and then some grated parmesan cheese. I baked for 15 min at 400* and it turned out great as you can see from the pic. It tasted great too. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this recipe. I tried it with the cresent roll that they have with no lines on them because that was all that they had at the store. Unfortunately, the bread was too doughy for me. I have tried it twice more with the french bread. So yummy! I don't really follow the amounts of the ingredients. I just cover the dough. This last time I forgot to put the italian seasoning on the inside. So, after I rolled it up, I put the egg wash on top with some garlic powder, the italian seasoning, and some parmesan. I let that cook until it looks brown, then I place an aluminum foil tent on it so that it can still cook without burning the top (my oven cooks weird). I serve it with some marinara. Thanks for the recipe!

It even tastes great warmed up the next day.

Simple, delicious and filling. So cheap to make! I used the 3 pack frozen bread dough because it was cheaper than Pillsbury. I took the advice of another reviewer and covered the bread with foil once it was brown on top (20-30 minutes in) so it could finish baking without burning. I overstuffed mine as well and have leftover bread for my lunch today.

Like many of the other reviewers I used the Pillsbury french loaf dough and it only took about 20 minutes for the outside to get nice and brown. I used more cheese than the recipe calls for, and a little more pepperoni but I think next time I will use less pepperoni since it was a little too overwhelming. Otherwise it came out perfectly with a warm gooey center and a crispy outside. Thanks!!

Easy and good.  I did overstuff it, but that's not abnormal with me . . .I am just never satisfied with the amount of ingredients . . . .I added a bit of spaghetti sauce to it and brushed the top with egg.  Came out golden brown.  Thanks.

This is good bread.  I followed the recipe exactly, had no problems with any of it. I found the bread to be best when still warm from the oven, or reheated in the microwave. I  warmed up some pizza sauce to dip the bread in, also.

This was good, but not enough pepperoni. I belive this would be a 5 star recipe if the peperroni was doubled.

We love this!  It's nice for a party or a simple family dinner.  We serve it with spaghetti sauce for dipping.  I do find that it tends to brown on the outside before the inside is done, so I cover with foil for the last 10 minutes.

Delicious. Made with frozen pizza dough ball (in freezer aisle), and did use the egg wash. Highly recommended to satisfy that pizza craving!

I used pizza dough for this and sprinkled the filling with garlic and onion powders but didn't use the egg. Brushed the top of the loaf with evoo and a little more garlic powder. A huge hit with the family ShawnaRae and thank you so much!

I spread 1/2 cup of marinara on the dough and then followed the recipe using Pillsbury french loaf.  AMAZING!! I wish I had made two!

I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars because it was really salty - and I like salty food.  Anyway, used Pillsbury dough, turkey pepperoni, and mixed the cheeses and Italian seasoning together, and used some of the leftover egg on top.  This made the top really brown before the rest of the bread was fully baked, so may not do that next time.  My husband kept saying "Can't you just make a calzone?" because he didn't think he'd like it, but ate almost the whole thing himself.  Served with pizza sauce for dipping, which he said made it better than it would have been without.

This bread is wonderful for a crowd! Made it for the Super Bowl and not a crumb was left! Very easy too, I like others used Pilsbury refrigerated pizza dough (couldn't find frozen bread dough) and it cooked up in 20 minutes at 375... wonderful! Thanks!

Delicious pepperoni bread!  I added a bit more pepperoni and mozarella cheese than the recipe called for - - hey, if you are going to be bad, be really bad!  I brushed the outside with the leftover beaten egg I had.  It only cooked at 375 degrees for 25 minutes when it looked brown and done.  It makes a lot which is good if you are serving a crowd.

Super fast recipe for a quick meal!  I used the Pillsbury french loaf but thought it was really hard to roll out to a decent size.  Going to try the suggestion of making bread machine dough to use.  We also added just a little sauce inside on the second attempt and it added just the right zing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is pretty good...if you like the idea but not the spiciness or the pepperoni, it's OK to just make "Cheesy Bread". Seriously, I've done that, and it's amazing. You can use your favorite melting cheese, too!

I made one bread with ground sausage and it held better than the pepperoni.  The pepperoni bread oozed after about 15 min.  Using turkey pepperoni might be better, like some of the other reviews said.

Yummy! My whole family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and served with  sauce on the side. I wouldn't change a thing just be sure to seal your seams well. I made two loafs & didn't do a good job sealing one. After 30 minutes I had conjoined twins in the oven, although it still tasted great!

This was sooo easy and good.  I used a Pillsbury French Loaf and added sauce like others suggested. We will be making this often.  Make sure if you use the Pillsbury French Loaf you cut down on the cooking time.  I forgot that it would take less time, but luckily just happened to check on it after 26 minutes.  At that point it was pretty brown on the outside.

All I have to say is "WOW!!". I've never made pepperoni bread; in fact, I've never even HAD pepperoni bread!  I wanted to use up some extras that I had in the fridge.  I'm glad I chose this recipe.  Full of flavor and great for snacking.  I doubt the loaf will make it through the day!! The only thing that I did different was I made my own bread.  I didn't have any frozen dough on hand.  Not as easy, but it was fun and delicious.  My family loves it too.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!

This is so good! I put a little bit of pizza sauce on the inside, mozzarella cheese, green onion, diced red pepper, parmesan, and pepperoni. I used the pillsbury dough in the can and it came out great--more than enough for two. We dipped it in pizza sauce and it was great. Note: Be sure to lay it out in the direction you are going to roll it up--I was rolling sideways, not so easy to maneuver.

I grew up on this stuff...my grandparents live in Maine and there was a bakery there that made this.  It was all the grandkid's favorites.  The bakery has since closed done and I have been looking for a good recipe like theirs forever.  This is not it.  The Italian spice is not nesceasary, but I do like the egg on top, not needed in the middle.  I like to buy a box of make it yourself bread mix the italian seasoning inside it along with the parm.  Then roll it out, layer the pepperoni side by side and top with a white and yellow chesse combo.  It is much better that way and great dipped in Ranch.  This is far from the best.  However, it is a good base for those of you who have not tried pepperoni bread.

I brushed the dough insides with melted butter mixed with onion powder, sprinkled minced garlic on top of that, then spread a light layer of basil pesto followed by pizza sauce and then the turkey pepperoni and cheeses. I rolled it up and brushed the outsides with egg and leftover butter mixture. I also used the pillsbury french bread, as other members suggested. I loved it. Quick and simple!

This recipe is WONDERFUL. The only change I make is to put pizza sauce in the roll with the other ingredients. I am constantly asked to make this -- in fact, people request it so frequently that I've had to intentionally make it less so that I don't get sick of it. It's SO good. I typically end up making two at a time when there are more than four people over. SO good

made this with my grociers pizza bread found in bakery (Publix).  chopped pepperoni, sprinkled Italian seasoning also on top after the egg wash. Drizzled lightly with olive oil when out of the oven.  Very good.
Next time, will allow to rise 1/2 hour prior to baking, add a little cooked Italian sausage along with pepperoni. 
My DH loved this.  The two of us wolfed down most of it so will have to bake two for a football party.

I LOVE this bread.  It was so good, this is a great substitute for breadsticks or even pizza.

Thanks for this easy recipe. This was a major hit with everyone. I made a couple changes, here's what I did: I couldn't find the Pilsbury French Loaf, but I did find the Pilsbury Italian Loaf. Because this came with garlic spread, I figured I might as well use it. I unrolled the dough, spread that on, layered some good quality salami, grated mozzarella and sprinkled some oregano. Baked for about 20 minutes and served with Pizza sauce for dipping. SO GOOD and so easy - will be making this again. (Goes great with an italian meal. - Check the recipe for Baked Ziti I) Delish!

This turned out really well and tasted great.  Next time I will use Pillsbury French Loaves instead of going thru the hassle of thawing, etc.  I will also add some sausage and maybe some italian ham.

This is such a good idea.  I make the dough in my bread machine.  It is so yummy, even my 20 month old niece loved it!  Can't wait to make it again.

Wish I made two of these. Between 3 people, this was gone in minuetes. First, I cooked the pepperoni on a bacon rake in the microwave at 20 second intervals,just so it wouldn't get so greasy in the bread. Didn't really measure anything,just put it on to my liking. Delish.

Delish!  I made one normal and one with crushed red pepper, yum!  Make sure you bake with the fold on the bottom as I got that wrong the first time and it oozed out quite a bit.

This is easy and tastes good warm or cold.  I always make it and take it to football tailgates and everyone raves. The only think I do a bit different is add a bit of sliced onion for more flavor, but is perfect without.  Thanks for sharing!!

This was very good, but we made a few changes which made it perfect.  We doubled the cheese, and added 1/2 pound of cooked pork sausage (well drained) and a 2.25 ounce can of drained sliced black olives. The cheese flavor really came through, and the sausage and olives gave it a real pizza flair.  We also placed foil under the bread after 20 minutes in the oven to keep the bottom from over-browning.   NOTE:  I forgot to add that we also doubled the pepperoni.  We made this just yesterday, and used 1/2 turkey pepperoni, which has 70% less fat, and 1/2 regular pepperoni.  We couldn't tell the difference.  It was delicious.  Next time, we'll try all turkey pepperoni....that's quite a reduction in the fat content!

Great recipe submission! However this should be called a Stromboli. I have been making this for years.. My husband and children love it. I often add other fillings depending on what I have on hand. I will be making this (in the form of a snake) in addition to my Halloween dinner.

Very good for dipping. I didn't have any frozen dough so I made my own using the Parmesan Herb bread also on this site. Made this for friends so I didn't try putting the sauce inside. Afraid it would end up soggy.

The dough used does make a difference as some are sweet. Pizza dough (check size bc some are enough for 2 loaves) or thawed Rhodes frozen bread dough works well. Cooking the thinly sliced pepperoni for 30-60 seconds evenly arranged on top of paper towel and with additional  paper towel over top (which absorbs grease as it cooks), reduces amount of  grease from the pepperoni, so bread isn’t as greasy.
Egg inside is not necessary, and putting sauce inside can make the bread soggy. I use 2 cups of mozzarella and less Italian seasoning. I also bake on parchment paper instead of greasing pan. Mine was done after 25 min.  Great dipped in sauce.

Served Marinara on the side. 
I did add some Italian seasoning to the top of the bread which was so good.

Very good and I'll make it again for sure.  Next time however, I think I will load it up a little heavier with pepperoni and cheese. It is also a good idea to make a few small slits in the top of the bread to let the steam out as it bakes which will eliminate an air pocket between the bread and the content. This is a great thing to serve as an appetizer or with a meal.  Hard to go wrong with this recipe.

Very tasty and easy. I did use the egg and then spread pizza sauce on it.  I also cut slits in the dough after I rolled it up and let it rise for 30 minutes . It's not necessary. Will make again when we want pizza. It's really just as good as take out and added a salad. I also added Italian seasoning.

I brushed with olive oil and garlic salt.  I added mild pepper rings to give it a little spice.  Always a winner in my family and when sliced thin and put on a plate it looks amazing!  My husband Loved it !  You can use pizza sauce as a dipper!  You can't go wrong with this one!

This was great. I used Pillsbury French Bread. A little more tough to flatten but really good result. Done in about 25 min but my oven runs hotter than the setting. Very good and quick snack for parties for kids and adults!

Turned out really well. Pretty straightforward and easy recipe. I just ballparked the ingredients. Didn't measure. Served this with marinara on the side and it was great. Now that I know how easy and tasty this is I'll be making it more, and experimenting with variations.

Followed the recipe and a tip from one of the reviews that recommended microwaving the pepperoni for a few seconds. The tip was great...made it less greasy but still full of flavor. Will make again

Was very good. I doubled and was gone by morning with my family. The only thing I would change is the bread. The frozen loaves I used weren't stretchable to the size I think I needed. I will probably make my own dough next time. Very yummy and fun.

I made this for my family.  I used fresh whole wheat pizza dough from Trader Joe's and baked it on my pizza stone.
I also brushed the egg wash on the top and sprinkled poppy seeds on top before baking.  It looked very nice served with a salad and tasted great.

I substitute fresh pizza dough with the pizza dough in a can.  After I spread the dough out in a cookie sheet, I use a pastry brush and spread on a thin layer of  garlic butter.  Then add Italian seasoning.  Layer pepperoni and cheese (lots of it).  Roll it up.  Brush on an egg wash.  Bake for 40 minutes.  When out of the oven, brush on a little garlic butter and sprinkle some parmesean cheese.  Yummy!!

A nice alternative to sandwiches. Very easy and adaptable but watch the cooking time. Mine was ready in under 30 minutes. The almost 3-hour ready time listed here must be a typo or somethng. You can choose the kind of bread you use, add different kinds of cheese,  and make it more or less spicy. I made this with my adult son, who has severe autism. He liked the method but found it awkward to roll, so we added pepperoni as we rolled. This way they stay in place and don't squish out ahead of the roll. Another alternative would be to use diced pepperoni instead of sliced.

Looked beautiful right out of the oven, done in 25 minutes. Disappointed in taste, lacked flavor. Bread came through over everything else.  Even provided pizza sauce on the side for dipping. Left me wanting an actual pizza. Would not make again.

Great versatile  recipe!  I used canned thin crust pizza dough....skipped the egg wash....just a little olive oil and season for the top.   Mine was done much faster, probably about 20 minutes.  I also used swiss and parm and salami and pep.

I made this on a Sunday evening for something more after a big Sunday dinner. It was the perfect amount of meat and cheese and bread. I was worried that the inner bread in the jelly roll would not be cooked and that pretty much happened. I'm sure my old oven needs a moe experienced cook. Maybe a less hot oven. I took it out when the outside was pre-burnt lol. Still was yummy - like my adult son said - it won't be the first time we are raw dough in the middle of something ?? I used Italian bread in the poppin' fresh tube and like the flavor with the pepperoni and cheese. I served it with pizza sauce from a jar for dipping. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This vanishes as soon as it is cool enough to handle! I use Rohdes frozen white bread dough. I leave out the egg, and brush the inside and out with a mixture of olive oil, melted butter, garlic powder, and italian seasonings. There isn't a whole lot you can do to screw this one up! Great classic, just as I remember it from my childhood!

4/14 used rockland bakery pizza dough, excellent. halved it.  put egg on top also and kosher salt and it. seasoning.  everyone liked it. but it did open at the seam.  i didn't roll it i just folded over, next time roll it. 12/19: layered, salmi, provolone and pepperoni and rolled up long and skinny better, really good. dip in tomato sauce.  make for holiday party next year.

Take the time and make your own pizza dough.
(Bobby Flay's is very good}
The pizza dough works better.
I have been making this for years. I use provolone, pepperoni, and mozzarella (add parmesan or/and romano if you like) . Roll up and brush with egg wash, make slits on top of the bread. Sprinkle top with italian seasoning.  Bake at 400 for 20 mins. 
Still working on the sides splitting at times :)

This came out fantastic, we ended up making a 2nd one instead of a pizza.  I did make a few alterations to my taste.  Bought a bag of 1lb dough from Stop & Shop ($1.75 I think). Used  3/4 cup mozzarella and 3/4 cup of 2% mozzarella since I like things cheesy.  I only sprinkled a bit of grated parm.  My fiance laid the dough out and then covered with the egg.  I heated in the microwave 6 big slices of genoa and 10-12 slices of margherita pepperoni one 2 paper towels and dabbed after.  I put down 3/4 cup of mozz and some parm and a bit of seasoning, then put the meat another 3/4 cup of parm with a bit more seasoning.  After we rolled it we dabbed a bit of egg along top and I sprinkled a bit of parm/mozz with some garlic along the top and baked.  It was fantastic!

I make meals from this site all the time.  but never rate anything.  As my meals never turn out the way i think they are intended to.  This one however came out beautifully.  So much  so my wife thought i bought one.  

I used the microwave the pepperoni trick and also used the french bread loaf.  It was so easy and tasted awesome.

Great recipe.

I thought this recipe was good. I used 1 dozen bread dough rolls, for the recipe written as is. I tested some with the seasoning, which I wasn't sure about and I decided not to use it. It was too over-powering. I always made these with just pepperoni, but I really liked the addition of both the mozzarella and parmesan. I used a finely grated parmesan instead of shredded and whole milk mozzarella. I think, it worked well. I also made some as is with the egg wash and 2 cheeses, but added little bit of of spinach on top for a vegetarian version. I baked them on parchment at 425 degrees for about 10-12 minutes.

Everyone loved it. I used frozen bread dough, stretched it to fit my jelly-roll cookie sheet, brushed with egg, added garlic salt, basil and oregano, then pepperoni and a bag of "Italian" shredded cheese from Sargento. Rolled it up, topped with more egg wash and some pepperoni. Baked only about 30 minutes, only 15 of it at 375, backed it down to 325 for the rest as it was getting too browned. Served with spaghetti sauce on the side to dip in. Enjoyed by all!

Awesome! Very tasty, a tad on the dry side.  I will make it again, and can't wait to play with the fillings....I'm already thinking about chicken and asparagus, or sausage and scrambled eggs, or beef and broccoli:). Next time I will put in a couple tablespoons of some kind of sauce (my daughter, and I dunked it in ketchup, and it was yummy)

Very yummy!  Brushed the outside with the leftover egg and sprinkled with more parm.  Kids liked it dipped in sauce.

Be sure to use the egg!!! First time I tried this, it was much too puffy. Also, add a little more italian seasoning and go heavy on the cheese!

Really good!  I prefer the frozen bread dough over the refrigerated french bread dough.  I put frozen bread into a glass loaf pan and covered with plastic wrap.  Put into the refrigerator and it was ready for use whenever I needed it. When done, we served a favorite spaghetti sauce and ranch dressing as dipping sauces. Also made half the loaf with browned ground italian sausage.

Not only does this make excellent pepperoni bread, but it can be easily done on short notice without making a big mess (for a guy, that counts for a lot!)

I made 2 of these for a bowling banquet tonight...one of them was exactly according to the recipe.  The other, I tweaked....the meat was half pepperoni and half hard salami, and I added mild banana pepper rings.  They were both a hit.

I'll be making this again, and again.

I love this pepperoni bread. My family gobbles it up. So fresh and looks so professional. I use store bought pizza dough and they come so light and airy. Would recommend for any get together.

Good and easy. Hubby and both little ones ate it - always a good sign.  I used 1/2 of leftover pizza dough recipe and it wasn't quite enough to feed everyone. Next time will use whole recipe of dough.

i used a 1 lb frozen bread dough and followed another reviewer's idea to cook the pepperoni first in the microwave and blot the extra grease. it turned out amazing and not greasy at all!! one note, it only had to cook for 25 mins. hubby loved it so much we had it two days in a row ;)

I thought this was pretty good and my husband thought it was all right. Because it is so similar to a calzone, I think I will just stick with the calzone and add some more ingredients in it. Thanks for the recipe though.

So easy and so so yummy. I served with leftover jarred pasta sauce and some ranch dressing. The whole family enjoyed even the kids. This was my first time using frozen pizza dough, and I really liked it. The outside was crispy and the inside was soft and chewy!!! Will make this again and often.

This bread is awesome!!! I used regular pepperoni because I couldn't find turkey but would have loved to use it. I forgot about the egg so didn't do that step but I doubt it made a difference. I took it to work and it was gone in 20min and everyone was asking for more, definitely a huge hit!!! Will be making again and again!

The only thing I can really think of that I would do differently is to put some sauce into the roll. It did need to be dipped so everyone ended up with their own little bowl of pizza sauce.

This was very tasty! I did use a tiny bit of olive oil in place of the egg on the dough and added a bit of garlic! I did an egg wash on the dough once it was rolled up and it turned out a perfect golden brown! Wish I could've taken a picture but we dug in to quickly! We dipped it in pizza sauce! Will make again, had a great flavor. My hubs was a bit skeptical of there being no sauce on it but he was very pleased with the end result!

Excellent. The Italian seasoning definitely gives it more flavor than previous breads I've made... However, it is pretty much impossible to mess up pepperoni bread

I made this using the Tasty White Bread recipe from this site. It turned out great. I used the powdered Parmesan from the canister and skipped the egg. It was still very good. I would recommend using homemade dough, as it is cheaper and easier to work with than frozen dough. The Tasty White Bread recipe is very easy to make and rolled out well. If you use fast-rising yeast it's also pretty quick.

I also used the refrigerated pizza crust for time and ease issues.  It turned out great.  I baked for about 25 minutes using that crust.  I did use the egg and it was fine, but may use olive oil next time.  I agree that I will make this again with salad for a fun, easy meal. Oh, I did serve it with pizza sauce for dipping.  Everyone loved it!

My son and I loved this recipe! The egg did not make it soggy and it was not dry without sauce, as written in other reviews. It was terrific just the way the recipe is! I did use a suggestion and cooked the pepperoni on papertowels about 30 seconds in the microwave to cut some of the grease. Good job!

Easy and delicious.  I made twice in the same day and preferred the 2nd loaf as I used room temp dough and decreased oven temp to 350 and only cooked for 30 minutes.  Office mates LOVED it and had two request the recipe!

This was good, like others I used the Pillsbury french bread and turkey peperoni, and served it with some warmed marinara to dip it in. I enjoyed it and my husband LOVED it. I will definitely make it again but with all those calories just as a treat. :)

I thought this was going to be somewhat hard to make, but it was so easy and quick!! I served it at a party with pizza sauce for dipping and it was a huge hit. If you are making this for a crowd make sure you make more than one...they are not as big as you might think!

Thanks for a great crowd pleaser. I made two of these for a large birthday party and they flew off the plate. I used refrigerated french bread dough and also added some garlic powder to the egg wash. Served with pizza sauce for dipping!! Will definatley make again and next time I might try sausage too.

I used the Pillsbury French loaf bread as well- couldn't find frozen bread. I just placed pepperoni and cheese until it looked "right" and sprinkled rosemary, oregano, basil, thyme, and some red pepper over the bread. Very good! My husband said I could make this again, and that is always a good sign.

OMG,my DH, the pizza fanatic, is in love with this stuff. I use the refrig french bread load, because it is so much easier, and just as good. He can eat an entire loaf, so I dont know how well leftovers keep, because we never have any!

Very good and easy to make. I used the thin crust version of pizza dough and only had to cook the roll for just over 20 minutes. I added some garlic salt as well and it turned out great.

Awesome! I've made them several times and you almost can't mess them up.  Even when the bread doesn't seal all the way, it still works!  Maybe add some garlic salt to the filling?? VERY popular with company.  They think you worked like a slave on them.

Had some trouble getting the dough to roll out to a rectangle and to get it to seal (stretchy stuff!).  It did eventually pop in one or two places while baking but the end result was still great.  I didn't measure anything, just using what I had on hand.  Added a bit of garlic powder and a little olive oil to the egg wash.  My husband and son loved it.

This is a good, quick pizza roll to make.  I liked the pepperoni in it, although, it can be greasy.  Next time, I'll try it with a few veggies. I ended up using refridged dough because my store doesn't carry the frozen dough.  Go figure.  Very tasty.

I made this for a party and after putting out the first batch people literally lined up to get some of the next batch when it came out of the oven! I left out the Italian seasoning because my family finds that a bit too much. I also used some sweet Italian sausage that I had made in sauce and that was just as tasty!!!!

We were surprised at how really good this was, and we both ate more than we should have.  I never used frozen bread dough before and you can't beat it for ease in making this recipe.  My mouth is watering for some more as I write this.

This was wonderful! I omitted the egg, didnt want to bother with it but did put a little olive oil in its place. I added green pepper and onion with the pepperoni and it was absolutely delicious!!

This was great! Per the other reviews, I doubled the pepperoni and cheese.  I personally thought there was too much cheese so I won't be doing that again but doubling the pepperoni was perfect.  I used frozen bread dough and found that I only had to cook it for 25 minutes.  
I will be making this again!

Very good recipe...simple..family all liked it. Dipped it in pizza sauce. I used Pillsbury Pizza dough to make it quick. I also added some ham, sliced mozz. instead of shredded, some round black pepper and italian spices plus diced some fresh tomato. When serving, placed a paper towel under it to soak up some of the oil/greases. Thanks for sharing

Mmmmm!  We very much enjoyed this.  I used turkey pepperoni, and brushed the top of the bread w/ a little olive oil, and then grated some parm. cheese on top.  Quick & easy.

I doubled the amount of pepperoni based on others' suggestions. My boys could not get enough of it and they actually got full. In their words, "Mom, this is better than pizza. You should make this more often!". Thanks for recipe.

Very good.  I've even changed the meats and cheese in this one.  Worked well on our family day to the zoo.  Will use again when we need to go out or even to the park on a picnic.

Very tasty.  I also added some homemade pizza sauce.  I used the frozen bread, but I think I may try the Pillsbury French Bread everyone's talking about.  Definitely a kid-friendly dish!

I used Pillsbury French bread to cut down on time, but followed the rest of the recipe to a "T". I thought it was a 3 star recipe, personally, but my step-son ate the rest of one(half) and asked me to make another and then ate half of that one.  He really enjoyed it.  I will give it a four star rating because of the easiness of the recipe, but I thought it was just o.k. Thanks for the recipe.

It was my turn to bring the food for our monthly Team Meeting at the office. I made two of these, using the Pillsbury refrigerated french loaf dough--no rolling required! I used one beaten egg which was enough for both loaves.  Then I sprinkled half of the Italian seasoning on the dough, a sprinkling of the olive oil, then half of each of the cheeses, topped with the pepperoni.  I finished by sprinkling on the rest of the cheeses, olive oil and seasoning before rolling it up.

My coworkers LOVED this treat!  Both loaves were gobbled up in no time.  Next time I make two loaves, I'll make one all vege for those who don't eat meat.

I have made these several times and using the french bread dough makes this recipe quick and easy. You can also add whatever you'd like to switch it up a bit.  I recently made calzones with turkey and ham w/ american cheese and when it was out of the oven I cut it in half and added tomatos, lettuce, and Italian dressing. It was to die for.

My husband and I really weren't crazy about this.  The recipe calls for WAY to much italian seasoning.  It overpowered everything else.  As others suggested I used the french bread dough and found it very hard to work with.  Would not make this again!

This is soooo easy and better than anything you can order from your local pizza joint. We use turkey pepperoni, black olives and banana peppers (along with all that gooey cheese). Added minced garlic to the egg wash and used that along with more italian seasoning after we rolled it up.

This was delicious!  I can't believe the entire thing was eaten by two people!

I used the shredded Italian cheese mix, sprinkled in a pinch of garlic power and added ricotta. I took the advice of other reviewers and used the refrigerated french roll. 

I also served this with the "best marinara sauce yet" recipe from this site.

Made this for the Super Bowl. Was very good and super easy to make. Did not use egg wash and used Pillsbury French loaf.  I also served it with marinara sauce. This will become a regular of mine.

This is a fantastic recipe!  Every bite just melts in your mouth.  I will definitely make this again.  Based on the other recommendations, I used a Pillsbury's French loaf and it turned out great.  The only change I will make next time is to double the recipe because it was barely enough for my family (2 adults & 1 child).

This was a nice recipe to make. I could not find the frozen bread because of where I live they only sell it during the holidays. So I used frozen pizza dough and it took less time to cook and my family loved it.

This recipe was a great hit! My kids and the sitter gobbled it all up. I varied it a little only brushing the outside with the egg as well as with italian & garlic seasoning. I also put bacon in one end of it instead of pepperoni to satisfy one of my children. If making it for myself I would had added some mushrooms as well. Definatly will make again!!

I used the Italian Herb Bread I SUBMITTED BY: Ann Barr instead of frozen bread dough and it turned out perfect. I made dough up as per recipe and let it do the first rising. Then I punched dough down and rolled into rectangle shape. Since dough had seasonings I omitted Italien seasoning and doubled mazzerella, everything else I left the same. I rolled it up like a burrito and and then lightly stretched it to make it longer. I baked according to directions.  We used pizza sauce for dipping.

Fantastic recipe! I made my own crust, from a recipe also on this site (Premium Pizza Crust) and brushed the top with garlic. I added a few tablespoons of Vodka sauce to this as well, just so it wasnt dry. It was wonderful, and all gone in one sitting.

Delicious!  I used home made pizza crust and every crumb was devoured!  Thanks for a good recipe!

I used crescent rolls and sealed the edges with a rolling pin.  Next time I will double the ingredients because the bread overpowered the filling.  I served it with marinara sauce for dipping.  I will make this again.

This is a very easy, fast and yummy recipe.  I brushed dough with basil pesto before rolling up, used pizza cheese blend and brushed top with egg wash.  Also added a little garlic powder to the egg wash.  Very good.

I made this one for my boyfriend because he's a pepperoni fan and he raved about it.  He ate half the loaf when he came home from work last night.  I followed the review that someone else gave and bought a fresh pizza dough from the bakery.  I added a bit of prosciutto and some finely chopped olives.  It literally took less than five minutes to assemble and throw into the oven.  In my oven it took about an hour to fully bake but the pizza dough ended up turning out like bread.  We dipped it in marinara sauce.  Not a meat or pepperoni lover, I actually like this one and I'm having it for lunch today at work.  Next time I'll make this one for him, and I'll try substituting the pepperoni with roasted vegetables as I think those might work with this recipe too.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit! I didn't use the egg wash; didn't need it. I made it for company and served it with marinara sauce for dipping..two thumbs up all around!

I didn't even know they made frozen loaves of bread, I'm used to making my own. Ventured out to buy a "frozen loaf" and threw one in the fridge to thaw overnight. Added some pizza sauce on the rolled out bread next day, and some mushrooms with the pepperoni and cheeses. Coated the rolled up top with egg, parmesean and garlic powder. Looked so nice when it came out of the oven, but for one bulge on the side where it started to burst. Honestly, this isn't my favorite, which is weird since I love anything pepperoni. But it is still a winner in my books because my boyfriend couldn't get enough of it and the kids absolutely loved it. I'll make it again, but I'll make something else for me on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

All in all a pretty good recipe. We were really excited to try it, but were a bit let down by the flavor. I will probably try it one more time.

Hubby was going to watch the football game tonight, I just got the call from the guys, it's a hit!!!  I did a few things differntly but the idea is yours and I thank you.  
I used pillsbury pizza dough, grated garlic and melted butter, brushed the dough; then brushed it again with the italian dressing; layered it with pepperoni, sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fried/breaded chicken cutlets, rolled it up and used the egg wash.  Cut on the bias it makes a great presentation.  You can be sure I will make this again.  Easy, fast and oh so good!

This recipe was fast and good.  It will be a keeper at our house.  I also used the Pillsbury Italian bread loaf that others mentioned, simply for time savings.  Husband loved it and suggested we try canadian bacon, swiss cheese and a smear of mustard next time.  Works for me!

when making this I also add some hot pepper rings,  (put these on paper towels to remove the juice from them.) Depending how hot you like things you can sprinkle on a few dried hot pepper seeds.   gives it a nice bite

I made 2 loaves for New Year's.  Most of the first loaf was eaten.  It was spicier than I expected (I used sandwich pepperoni from the deli).  All in all a good recipe, but I'd add more cheese and/or make my own dough next time.

I goofed and used crescent rolls instead of the bread dough.  The filling popped the seams while I was rolling it up, even though I tried to seal them, so I had to use a second package of crescent rolls.  It turned out rather doughy, probably my fault.  It was an OK recipe, nothing spectacular.

I had no idea if this would turn out because the dough was kind of hard to work with (pillsbury french bread) but it ended being a hit.

I made this recipe just as written, using the Pillsbury french loaf and I thought it was good. It rolled up nicely and looked pretty on the appetizer tray after being sliced. I might like to kick the flavors up a notch next time, but nothing to complain about as is. Thanks for the recipe!

This was soooo easy! I used two loafs of refrigerated french bread dough, and was able to freeze the second loaf for later in the week. I also used turkey pepperoni. My daughter doesn't like pepperoni, so we will be replacing it with Canadian bacon next time. Also my husband likes things more spicy than the rest of us wimps, so he requested a nice spicy marinara sauce to dip it in next time. :D Enjoy!

Pretty good.  At the recommendation of other reviewers I used turkey pepperoni as well & glad I did.  The family liked it a lot, so will probably make again for them.  It was quite simple too, which is nice!

This was my first time making pepperoni bread and it was AWESOME!  I used the Pillsbury French Loaf.  It turned out great, but I'm going to experiment with different bread.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out great and is a very easy recipe. My 5 year enjoyed helping me make this from start to finish. I will definitely make this again and would experiment with different ingredients for inside the bread -- maybe spinach and feta?  Thanks for the recipe!

My four year old had a blast helping me make this recipe and even more of a good time eating it. We experimented with different toppings (he loves pineapple) and everytime we've made it, it's been a big hit.

Extremely easy to make!! It was gobbled up before I could even try it, but I was told it was very good. I didn't have any parmesan, so I used extra mozzarella.

I am trying different recipes for a Christmas Party and this one was a hit with my husband.  I also could not find the frozen bread dough so used the French loaf and cut the baking time to 30 mins...it turned out perfect. I can't wait to try different meats and I will be making this for our party.

Good recipe.  I made my own bread recipe and did not use the frozen.  I think it would have been better split into 4 loaves rather than 2.  Simple and good recipe though.  Really good dipped in pizza sauce or my favorite, olive oil and seasonings (like they serve in restaraunts).

This is a great bread to accompany an italian dinner!  I didn't roll mine tight enough and it opened a little, but it was still wonderful.  It reminded me of the calzones I used to get when I was a kid.

My kids LOVED this.  Very easy to make.  I made one with mozzarella and I put pepper jack in the other.  I also used turkey pepperoni so there was very little grease.  I presliced it and wrapped it in foil for a picnic.  A huge hit that pleased four picky kids!

Updating this to note that I also make this with pre-cooked Italian sausage, and I add chopped fresh basil.  This is SO easy and always a hit - it's my go-to for picnics and potlucks.

This was fantastic.  Great and easy, everyone loved the flavor.  I did add some minced onion.  My Mom said it was just as good as Tim Hortons Pizza Bread.  Will definitely make agian.

Thanks for an awesome delicious and easy recipe.  We really missed pizza night since we moved and resorted to cooking our own, I have made this a dozen times in the last month all to rave reviews.  I use turkey pepperoni and serve with a side of sauce. yum!

The italian seasoning really sets this pepperoni bread apart.  I dust mine with parmesan cheese and another sprinkle of seasoning when I put it in the oven.  This is a real winner with the kids, and would be great with tomato sauce to dip in, although I have never needed that.

This was FABULOUS!  I expected an ordinary pizza, just rolled up, but something about it was unique.  I added a few black olives before I rolled it up, and also served some spaghetti sauce on the side for dipping, though it was good with or without it.  This will definitely become a regular at our house!  Thanks so much!

i made this bread and everyone loved it, the only problem i had with it was that the bread formed a large bubble and the cheese was oozing out, but after it was cut it was not so noticable.

So easy and delicious!  I heated spaghetti sauce and we dipped the slices in.  Our family...2 adults and 4 young children...easily ate 2 loaves one evening for a quick meal and both were all gone.  I made 4 loaves the next night for a party and they went even faster!  Lots of "How'd you make this?" and "I'm going to make this!"  A definite keeper!  I did not have time to make the dough this time, but I plan to try this soon with an herb bread recipe.

I made the Parmisian Herb Bread that another reviewer suggested.  This turned out awesome.  I had some pepperoni and mozerella left over from some pizzas I bought and used the crust to make chicken pizzas.  I was wondering what I was going to do with them.  This was a great way to use them up.
