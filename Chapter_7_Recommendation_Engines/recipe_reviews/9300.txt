My Mother used to make these mini cheesecakes with one difference; she would drop a whole vanilla wafer in the bottom of the cup cake wrapper; instead of making a crust.

I don't know what I did wrong, but I felt for someone who has never made cheesecake before, that the instructions were not clear enough. For instance, are the wafers supposed to be crumbs or just small pieces? Either way, mine floated to the top. Also, my gas oven usually takes less time to cook, so I have to always adjust the cooking times but with this recipe, how do you know if itâ€™s done? When it browns on top? When the fork comes out clean? I had no idea. I used regular cups because I couldn't find the mini ones, and cooked it for 10 minutes, but was unsure if they were done or not so I cooked them another 3 minutes. After they had cooled, they tasted great but the texture was terrible. It was grainy and gel like. I left them in the fridge over night, and it became firmer, but still had the terrible texture. Was this because it wasn't cooked long enough? Over cooked? Or was it because the wafers floated up into the cups and maybe changed the texture? I hate to give this recipe such a poor rating, but the instructions were terrible for someone who has never made cheesecake before. The taste was good though, especially with the "cheesecake" flavored cream cheese.

I have used this recipe for the past 25 years it is called "Cheesecake Petites" and it really goes over big at whatever event large or small.  I used the alluminum cupcake cups because they are sturddier when baking and when transporting the goods!

This is such a quick, delicious and impressive looking dessert. I did not have the small muffin tins so I had to use regular size. I also used a typical graham, butter and powdered sugar mixture for the crust. I kept the baking time and temp the same and they turned out great. Topped some with cherries, others with Reese's peanut butter cup cut up and other with cherries garnished with flaked chocolate. Everyone loved them. Yield: 18 mini cheesecakes

These are absolutely fabulous!!! I made them ans took them to a baby shower one weekend and then because they were so good and so simple to make, doubled the recipe to make even more for a wedding shower the next weekend.  Everyone was calling me "Martha Stewart" and was so impressed by the presentation.  Of all the desserts at this shower--this one was gone first with people begging me for the recipe! When I told how simple they were, no one would believe me.  I do have some comments, though that I hope will help...first when you process the vanilla wafers, which is so easy, it makes a lot, so you will have a lot of extra crumbs.  I even used a heaping teaspoon in each, more than double what the recipe calls for.  it made a nice base.  I increased the vanilla a little bit, just because I like the flavor of vanilla, and also you will not need the whole can of topping either.  I used cherry, blueberry and I also macerated some fresh strawberries to top the mini-cheesecakes.  I would suggest to use a ratio of 1+ 1/2 filling to base & topping.  These are so delicious, you will not be left with any extras! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is an wonderful recipe.  I added 1/3 cup of cocao powder to make it a "chocolate" mini cheesecake and it tasted fabulous.  I also ended up removing the paper cups so the presentation was much nicer.
Great recipe!  Definitely a keeper.

We revised this recipe a bit and added crushed almonds to the crust, used almond extract instead of vanilla and and piped whipped cream cheese and confectiners sugar with a dash of almond extract on top of weach mini cheesecake.  My 11 year old entered these in our local fair with these modifications and won first place.  This is a great recipe.

These are yummy and a great taste of cheesecake.  I used the vanilla wafer, easier and works great, and instead of pie filling, I top each cake with whatever jam I have on hand (blueberry, raspberry) and I usually make half plain for the jam and the other half I add mini chocolate chips, and place a few on top after baking.

Made this for a graduation party in 4 styles: blueberry topping on plain, peanut butter cup (added about 1/2 cup peanut butter and a bag of mini chocolate chips to batter and then sliced up Reese's PB cup to put on the top), oreo cookie (added 8-9 oreo cookies slightly broken up into batter with crushed oreo cookie as a topping), and pumpkin cheesescake (added a small can of pumpkin pie mix to batter). It was a hit. All 200 disappeared quickly with many compliments.

I made these in regular muffin size, baking them for 15 minutes, and they were perfect! I doubled the recipe and added the juice of one lemon, and I beat it for about about 5 minutes on med-high, then scooped into tins to keep them uniform. I also added about 4 TBS of melted butter to the finely chopped wafers to make the crust hold together. These are incredible alone, but even better with the chopped strawberry with lemon zest topping I made - 1 pound strawberries, 1/3 cup sugar, and the zest and juice of 1/2 lemon. Yum!

Pretty easy recipe. I used a graham cracker crust (about a whole sleeve of graham crackers with 2Tablespoons of butter and 2 Tablespoons of sugar). I didn't top it with the cherry pie filling, instead I cut up fresh strawberries and put a slice on each one. These freeze really well (without the strawberries)! Just take how ever many you need and I let them sit on the counter for about 5 mins to defrost. Warning: they are so addicting! lol

Good cheesecake flavor - each recipe to make with few ingredients. The crust needs butter to hold it together. It crumbles without it. This recipe is also a great one to use if you're in a hurry.

Like so many reviewers I've been making this recipe for well over 20 years. It's a Christmas staple and because I double and triple the recipe I freeze most of them. They thaw in a matter or minutes so are very handy if company or cravings pop in. Also, like so many others I use a whole cookie instead of crumbs for the base. Using a graham crust changes the flavour so I never use it. This is a perfect basic recipe to build on according to your imagination. Try spooning a bit of sugar sweetened sour cream on top. Divine. Add a bit of lemon juice to the cream cheese then top with well drained canned pineapple bits. OR top baked cheesecakes with lemon pudding and garnish with fresh pineapple or any fruit you wish. Thank you for submitting this great basic recipe and thanks to those reviewing and adding your own twist.

I'm glad I tasted these before taking them to our Christmas gathering..I've always used the recipe for Lindy's Famous Cheesecake and make a full-sized cheesecake for the holidays, but I was afraid to try and convert the baking time to make mini's this go around - I should have trusted myself and tried anyway.  This recipe was almost completely tasteless - some grated orange peel & lemon peel might be what it needs to perk it up - and definitely don't just dump all the ingredients in and mix together, add the eggs one at a time and blend completely smooth between each one.  Mixed as directed in this recipe gets you lumpy bumpy batter.  I'll be adjusting the bake time the next time I try making mini's - this bake time was so short there was no characteristic slight browing on top.  I was so disappointed and I really was hoping not to be.

I followed the cheesecake part of this recipe exactly. But used the mini phyllo shells in place of the vanilla wafers. Then drizzled a little caramel on top and finished with crushed bits of either Snickers, Heath, or Reese's PB Cups. I also used Neufatchel cheese to cut some of the calories and fat. I took all of them to a holiday potluck and they were devoured. Many rave reviews, multiple requests for the recipe, and they were so easy! I will definitely make these again.

I used mini vanilla wafers (left whole) in the bottom of each liner.  I topped ours with crushed toffee bites on half and the other half with cherry pie filling.  Took these to a wedding shower this afternoon and 5 people asked for the recipe.  So easy to make and so good.

They tasted great and thats the 3 stars. But.....the problem was they would not peel off the wrapper, it just all pulled down like it got smashed or something when you tried to take the wrapper off. I cooked these according to the directions and refrigerated them overnight so I'm not sure if I just didn't follow the recipe right or if that's just the way they are.

My mother has been making this recipe for years it was always a favourite during the holidays! Although to make things easier ( since this was mentioned in a comment below) you do not need to crush the vanilla wafers, simply place one single wafer in the bottom of each liner (aluminum liners work best)

Much like a previous reviewer, I have no prior experience making cheesecakes.  After my adventures, here is some advice for those who would like more detail.  The MOST important thing is to start with a smoothe batter.  Soften your cream cheese in a bowl (without its foil wrapper, obviously) in the microwave for about 45 seconds before trying to mix it.  It should look good and limp before you try to blend it up.  A cold, lumpy batter will not even out or 'melt' together in the oven.  It will keep whatever lumps you start it with, and if the lumps are too big, the wafers will rise up to the surface, and you will end up with some very funny looking cheesecakes (didn't stop me from eating them!) You will know it is beaten well enough when the lumps are no larger (preferably smaller) than small peas and the batter has small bubbles at the surface - if beating by hand, use a whisk and whisk it HARD for several minutes.  I used full size cupcake foils, and found that 20-25 minutes was the right amount of time.  You will know they are done when the cakes are slightly golden in the deepest corners of the folds at the edge of the cupcake foil, and the entire cake surface will be  rounded. The round surface will collapse after cooling, leaving a nice cubby for fruit or other toppings.  I topped the batch that was successful with a small amount of Dickinson's seedless raspberry preserves and slices of blackberry and raspberry.  Although the recipe was delicious, I'm going to donk it a

SO EASY.  I did not used the papers and I put a whole cookie in the bottom of the pan for each one (they fit perfectly).  Next time I would double the cream cheese mixture as there wasn't quite enough in each one.  Delicious

I used the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake recipe and this recipe to make the perfect mini cheesecakes.  I mainly used the time and trimmed the white chocolate raspberry recipe to serve 6 to make 12 cupcake sized cheesecakes.

These were super easy and great.  I thinked I worried about it too much when making it.  I did use Chocolate Graham crackers and crushed them in a processor as crust.  I took half the cheescakes and swirled some melted Semi-Sweet morsels into them.  Just straight chocolate melted in a microwave, I put a dollop on each and used a toothpick to swirl it in.  I also probably could have put more into each cupcake liner, but this was my first time and I was playing it safe.  I was very happy - made for Valentines and everyone loved it.  I honestly do not know how you could go wrong.  Also I make New york style cheesecake all the time, it takes 5 bricks of cream cheese and everyone is right you need to let the cream cheese get to room temp,  but I have many times microwaved my cream cheese with no adverse effects.  I am not saying cook it, but put it on a low setting and keep checking it - once it is getting smooth - I take it out and it always works fine, this is just good for those times when you forget to take it out early and are in a time crunch.  I microwaved these because it was a last minute thing.  Everyone else is right the skis the limit with what you can use as topping, I did a dollop of choclate, cherries and plain.  I will start making these more oftern - so easy and quick.

This was by far the easiest and best tasting desserts I have ever made. I only made one change and that was to put the whole vanilla wafer in the muffin liner and not to crush it up. I will be making this dessert for every party we go to.

This has become a standard recipe at my house. I know if my husband gets a sweet tooth, these little guys are done quickly and perfectly each time. You can put whatever you want on the top, which makes it seem like a different dessert each time. I have taken this them to dinner parties, work and given away to neighbors and every single time I am asked for the recipe. I usually make them in a standard sized muffin pan with liners and just watch the time...usually five more minutes is all you need. Love this one!

These came out excellent! I used a mock Oreo crust (I submitted the recipe, so look under my name) and filled 24 regular cupcake liners. I only baked them for 14 minutes (until the sides are firm, but the centers are still wobbly), so for mini muffin tins I would guess the baking time is too long!

This was a great recipe! I made these tonight for a work function tomorrow, and I made the following adjustments. Instead of vanilla wafers, I used cinnamon sugar pita chips, which I crunched up and mixed with a little melted butter. I baked at 325/350 (my oven runs a little hot), and I left off the cherry pie topping and added a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar. Fantastic. Turned out exactly as I hoped.

This was the very first time I attempted cheese cake and they were simple to make and yummy! Made them for Thanksgiving and they were the first to be devoured! I was so proud of myself.  I appreciate the recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

The finished product tasted okay. The problems with this recipe are--1) Be sure the cream cheese is softened before you combine with the other ingredients. Otherwise, you get unsightly lumps of cream cheese throughout, which did not improve by pushing the mixture through a sieve. 2) If you don't mix melted butter with the cookie crumbs, the crumbs will NOT adhere to the bottom. 3) Using a whole cookie as some suggested, would not work in the pan/liners that I used. The cookie is too large.

Made exactly as written, and they were perfect!  I'm making 200 and freezing them for an upcoming event.  The night of the event, I'll quickly top each with cherry or blueberry pie filling.

Sooo delicious!! im a terrible baker and these came out great! i did tweak a little due to what i had on hand.  I crushed shortbread cookies, added sugar, cinnaminn and a little melted buter to form a crust.  No need to bake this first, i put cheese mixture right on top and cooked for about 18 minutes.  Came out OK after baking, but after sitting in the fridge for 24 hours..OMG!!!  fabulous!!!  i know its tough, but give it the time in the fridge..you wont regret it.

Try these ideas for the fillings!!
I did some creative thinking and came up with some ways to make these little cheesecakes even more impressing!
I did 6 types: APPLE PIE (added a little cinnamon to batter, apple filling on top) ORANGE (added a little little bit of orange juice to batter and grated orange zest on top) PEANUT BUTTER (added a little bit of peanut butter and mini chocolate chips to batter and ground Reese's on top) and MOCHA (added a little instant coffee and mini chocolate chips to batter and a few mini chocolate chips on top.) The last two types I did were just as the recipe called for with cherry and blueberry filling on top. They were AWESOME! Everyone LOVED them and they were too cute!

I absolutely love these little desserts!  They are so easy and you can do so many flavor combinations.  I split my recipe in thirds and did one with pumpkin, pumpkin spice, and gram-cracker crust; one with an oreo crust, cocoa, and chocolate chips; one normal with two different toppings.  My guests demolished them!  Next time I'll try more flavors!  Thanks for the great recipe!

PERFECT CHEESECAKE! This was honestly probably the best cheesecake I have ever tasted. I expected it to be decent, but it beat my expectations for sure! I recommend this recipe to anyone who likes cheesecake, you won't be disappointed! The only thing I suggest is to use Philly cream cheese the store brand doesn't cut it, I've made it with store brand and name brand and it deff. makes a difference. And make sure the cream cheese is room temperature or it just gets chunky not smooth. This is deff. a keeper for me!

This was a super easy and really yummy recipe. I left the Nilla wafers whole and they worked perfectly. Once you pour the cheesecake mixture over the cookie, let them sit for 4-5 min so that the cookie gets a little soft. (Otherwise, the center of the cookie was still crunchy) These baked for 11-12 min in my oven. Also, I didn't bother with a water bath and they cooked evenly and the cookie didn't burn. I took them out of the oven and placed the whole muffin tin on a wire cooling rack inside my fridge, which cooled them off quickly, allowing me to free up the pan for another batch.

Easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception and that was instead of crushing the vanilla wafer, I just placed it top down in the paper wrapper.  I also used a pastry bag to fill the cream cheese filling.  Much easier than using a spoon.

I make a hybrid of this and Bon Appetit's mascarpone cheesecake with balsamic strawberries (recipe available at epicurious), and it was a huge hit! The bon appetit recipe  makes a large cake, so I ended up with two dozen cupcakes. Since the recipe I used called for eggs, I had to bake longer--I baked for 30 min, and I sat the muffin tins in a sheet pan and filled about halfway with water (the water bath kept the cakes from burning due to the longer baking time). I made an almond biscotti crust with store-bought biscotti, and I used strawberries instead of pie filling, since they are in season.  A wonderful and very easy dessert.

Loved them.  I added some crushed pecans to the batter, then after they baked and cooled, hollowed the centers out just a tad and put some chopped banana in them, then drizzled caramel sauce on the tops.  They won me 1st prize in a Bake-Off at work like this!

My grandmother made this recipe for many major holidays, and I now carry on the tradition :o).  I suggest aluminum cupcake liners because they are sturdier and add to the presentation.  I use Comstock pie filling for the top and made 1/3 with cherry, 1/3 with blueberry, and left 1/3 plain for Christmas.  They were a big hit! Also, it's much easier to drop in a whole Nilla Wafer on the bottom for the crust, and they come out just as good!

I made this recipe over the holidays however I made full sized cupcakes rather than minature.  I used light cream cheese, light cherry topping, and reduced fat vanilla wafers and it was great.  I did not crush the wafers, but rather just lined the cups with one wafer.

I give this full marks as it is so easy to prepare & and so yummy. I did add 1 teaspoon of all purpose flour because I like my cheesecakes to be 'firm' & easy for children to eat it without being messy and also I keep it in the fridge overnight and it taste even better.

These are just like the mini cheesecakes my mom's been making for years.  Rather than crumble the vanilla wafers, I plunk a whole wafer down each paper muffin cup.

These are always a hit, and they are so easy to make.  I actually doubled the batter so they came out a little bigger, and because not everyone likes the fruit toppings I added mini chocolate chips.

These were really good! One of the better mini cheesecake recipes I've tried. I made the standard cupcake size and it made about 16-18 of them. I made a double batch for two back to back Thanksgiving dinners and they were a big hit at both!

I chose this recipe due to not having a correct cheesecake pan. WOW! Am I glad I did. These were the easiest things to make and they didn't make it to dessert for Christmas dinner. I sat them on a platter with a bowl of cherry pie filling and the whole family had them gone in no time. Thanks for sharing!

These came out great, but it's kind of a pain if you make a traditional graham cracker crust and press it into the bottoms (which I did anyway).  The rest was super easy though, and the recipe is versatile.  This time I mixed in toffee bits.  I took a bunch to my doctor's office, and then they understood why I have gained so much weight during my pregnancy!

These tasted great! Very simple but great cheesecake taste. Next time I make a large cheesecake I will use this recipe to replace the one I currently use. Also loved the vanilla cookies crumbs on bottom instead of graham cracker crumbs.

Ok....I made graham cracker crumbs with butter and sugar and just a tiny bit of cinnamon.  Tamped them down with a (clean) prescription bottle bottom!  I made half plain and half chocolate.  Flavor is good, texture a little thick, I baked them for the required time but my oven runs a little hot.  The chocolate ones are okay...not my favorite.   I also didn't have paper cups so just sprayed my mini muffin pans with Pam w flour, and they came right out.   This recipe definitely deserves a second and maybe third trial!!  Easy to prepare and fun.  I'm pretty sure I'll end up loving them once I make them more!

This is a nice basic mini cheesecake recipe that can be adapted in countless ways.  I added canned pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices.  I also used gingersnaps for the crust.  The individual portions were nice for traveling to multiple Thanksgiving dinners because I could make just one batch and not have to worry about taking a fresh, uncut cheesecake to each place.

I just made these and they turned out perfect. There was some cracking on the top but I topped them with cherry pie filling and you can't even tell. My husband said they were awesome and he loves cheesecake!

I made these for a bridal shower yesterday and they were the first things gone on the dessert table. Everyone kept telling me how wonderful they were. Perfect bite sized treats. I followed the recipe exactly except I cut it in half.   I will defintely make them again for an easy go to dessert recipe that is quick and a favorite. Perfect for bringing to a picnic, BBQ, dinner. Very presentable as well!

These are so easy and delicious.  I made it last Christmas and took it to a friend's house for dinner.  Everyone raved about them.  I used the mini cupcake cups (foil), and they were so cute and delicious.  Thanks.

Easy to make and a big hit for the holidays. I used cherry pie filling and blueberry pie filling and made half of the cheesecakes each flavor which made for a nice and colorful presentation.

I made this recipe for Christmas and everyone LOVED it. I put some melted butter in the crumbled vanilla wafers (I was afraid they wouldn't hold up if I just crushed them) and used strawberry and cherry pie filling.

Fast, easy and tasty.  Made as directed, but used a mixture of graham cracker crumbs and vanilla wafer's.  I had them both, so used them.  Did find that I had a lot of leftover cherry pie filling.  I used it the next day in a jello salad, so it didn't go to waste.

Used vanilla wafers for the crust, but had to crumble them because they didn't fit in the cups when using my miniature muffin tins.  Great flavor, though, and always a hit!  They added nice color to my dessert buffet at a baby shower.

Amazing!!! Everyone loved it for thanksgiving so much so I'm making it for Christmas. The crust did fall apart like another reviewer said, but i think it might be because I put a little too much. The only changes I made was instead of regular sugar I put natural sugar from Colombia and I used animal crackers instead of vanilla wafers... so good. oh and I did not put a topping it was delish ;)

totally a hit! I made them the first time last night and it came out PERFECT as I expected.  I used Red Ruby Cherry toppings and they are sooo beautiful, and mouthwatering... I also used graham for the base - 2 cups of crushed grahams, 8 tablespoons of melted butter and 8 tablespoons of white sugar...and cream cheese should be in room temperature.. i baked them for 20 minutes... will definitely bake this again :)

I'm not a good dessert-maker, but this recipe is so easy.  The flavour is wonderful, the texture light.  It will definitely become a regular for me!

This is my first attempt at making Cheesecake and I must say, this recipe was simple and the cakes tasted great! (I used a graham cracker crust) I did a little research before I started.   I read 'Baking Cheesecake, Step by Step' and 'Perfect Cheesecakes' in the Top Related Articles section to the left of the recipe.  The tips really helped.

These are great little cheesecakes! I made mine using the filling directions here and topped on an oreo crust (about 2 cups crushed oreos- with the cream, and about 3 T butter pulverized in a food processor) They came out perfect!!!

Great recipe! It was quick, easy, and versatile! I used muffin tins half with the vanilla wafers with a little melted butter and the other half with crushed oreos with butter. I topped with either fresh blueberries and strawberries or hot fudge syrup with mini chocolate chips. I definitely recommend putting the muffin tin a cookie sheet with water to prevent cracking! Everybody thought I was a professional!

These are always a hit at potlucks.  It makes you feel like you're "pigging out" less!  I do variations that don't usually involve pie filling.  I drop a whole Oreo as a crust, and top with a fudge ice cream sauce.  A Nilla cookie with ice cream caramel...ginger snaps...your imagination is as far as it can go with this one.  All you need is a small round cookie really.

These had a very odd texture. I tasted the batter before they were cooked and it was yummy, but after cooked the cheesecake just didn't have the nice smooth cheesecake texture. And had kind of an eggy flavor. I mixed the batter well with my mixer so I don't know what happened to it. They're not terrible so we will eat them, but I won't be making this recipe again. I'm glad I just made them for home and not to bring somewhere.

I brought these to a bachelorette party last night and they were a hit. Everyone skipped the meal and went straight for desert. Because it was a somewhat "romantic" theme, I added chocolate chips and used strawberry filling on top..... then decorated the serving platter by placing chocolate covered strawberries between each mini cake. This was such an easy recipe and I will definately use it again!

Best cheesecake I've ever had. I have used this recipe several times, however I bake regular size cheesecakes and use (store bought) graham cracker crusts. I have been told many times that this is the best cheesecake people have ever had, and I have given out the recipes several times. 
I'm not sure if this is something that your suppose to do when making cheesecake, but I have found it helps make a very smooth creamy cheesecake. Before blending everything together, I melt down the cream cheese by microwaving it in increments, and stirring, so it doesn't burn. That way, everything blends together smoothly, and the results are amazing.

This recipe was very simple and delicious! You just have to make sure you don't over fill them with cream cheese.  I found that if I put a little less filling the cheesecake deflates in the center more, leaving you more room to put the topping.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now and it always disappears. I crush the wafers and add chopped nuts and melted butter to give it an extra crunch. I also add lime or lemon zest and extra vanilla to the cheesecake batter. If you just do the whole wafer it just comes out soggy. This is a great easy recipe.

These were good, but didn't quite have the cheesecake consistency I was hoping for. I did a graham cracker/butter crust in the mini-muffin pan. I did lots of different flavors: cocoa with almond extract, peanut butter, plain with raspberry jam, lemon juice, peppermint, and also mixed and matched layers of those together. They were all yummy, but it just wasn't cheesecake-y enough for me to want to use for Thanksgiving this year. However, I would use the recipe again for just a quick and easy treat sometime because my kids totally loved them!

These are awesome!! I've made them SEVERAL times now. At both family and work functions, they went FAST! I put the wafers into the blender to crush them to dust. I lined the cups, pressed the wafer crushings with a spoon to pack down tight, and poured the filling on top. Once it is baked it forms a nice little crust for your mini pie. VERY easy to make. This was the first dessert I ever made and it is a hit!

Made these for a bake sale--very easy and good taste.  Not a really great "cheesecake" taste but close enough in a tiny, portable mini-cheesecake that it was a big hit.  Used graham cracker crumbs and butter, pressed a small amount into the bottom of mini baking cups and filled with the mixture.  Then topped with a spoonful of cherry or blueberry pie filling.

I use this recipe all the time. I double the recipe and use regular size cupcake pans.  I use an oreo cookie in the bottom of each cup instead of crushed wafers (or lemon sandwich cookies when I am using a fruit topping).

Just Awesome ! Made some changes and turned out wonderful. Used crumbled chocolate sandwich cookies with equal amount of melted butter for crust. Added 1/3 cup of cocoa as suggested by someone to batter. Filled lined muffin tins for two bites cheesecake. Baked at 360 C for 30 min and toothpick came out clean. Let it cool and refrigate when ready to serve I added fresh banana slices topped with cherry pie filling and fresh whipped cream with some cookie crumbs sprinkled ontop. Its was a huge hit. Enjoy

Made this recipe as a treat for the teachers at school, and it sure was a hit.  I ended up making them in regular sized cupcake cups for a larger portion.  I also substituted the wafers with some graham cracker crumbs and butter.  Instead of pie filling, I used seasonally colored white chocolate chips (very cute, green and red swirls) that melted when the cake was still warm.  The time had to be extended a bit since the portions were bigger, but only by about three or four minutes.. check with a toothpick every now and then if you make a change in the size!

Over-all, very nice recipe (although the paper did get soggy for some reason, and there was some condensation I'm not use to on top) that everyone enjoyed.

These were easy to make and turned out to be decent. They make a nice generic base to add whatever type of topping you like to spruce things up a bit. Taking the time to melt some butter in a pan with the cookie crumbs and then pressing the crust into the muffin tins would make these turn out with a more stable and better tasting crust.

Not only did these taste *amazing*, but they were incredibly simple and quick to make. A great alternative to making one large cheesecake - and more fun to eat! Making these for a New Years party or buffet would be a fun idea. Guests could top their individual plain cheesecake with a variety of simple toppings: cherry pie filling, fresh berries, caramel, chocolate sauce, etc. 

When I made these, I used standard muffin tins lined with parchment cups and filled the cups about half-way with the cream cheese mixture. Instead of the vanilla wafers, I made a lightly spiced graham cracker crust. When they were cool, I topped the cheese cakes with either chocolate ganache or cherry pie filling (my yield was 20, so I made eight of each... and the remaining two were eaten before they could be topped!) Both were delicious.

Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very good and very easy.  As other users have said, make sure cream cheese is definitely at room temp.  Also, I like to use the regular size muffin tins...you can taste the cream cheese filling more.  And I just put one whole wafer at the bottom instead of crushing...saves time and still tastes great.

You go girl, these went great at a shower we gave and made each a different flavour, we made strawberry, cherry, choc. etc.  The winner of a certain game got first pick.  Very fun and very delish.  Thanks again.

This was SOOOOO good! Everyone in the family loved them! I followed the recipe exactly. My husband liked them so much, he thought that maybe we can sell them if we make them a little bit bigger. This definately is a keeper. I love it!

I made this for a school potluck and everyone loved them. But I've noticed that if you buy Nilla Wafers they are too big to use whole as cheescake bottoms, so come prepared with a ziplock baggie and frying pan for crushing.

I have been looking for a simple and delicious cheesecake recipe for fried cheesecake. This recipe is perfect! I omit the vanilla wafers and just pour the batter into the paper liners and bake as directed. When cooled, I peel off the liners and place two or three onto an 8" flour tortilla. I then wrap them up "burrito" style and secure with toothpicks and pop them into the freezer. Come time for dessert, I put the frozen "burritos" into 2" of hot oil, and fry until golden brown on both sides. Drain, dredge in cinnamon sugar, then drizzle with caramel sauce and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries! Perfect recipe!

Very good and easy to make. Refrigerated overnight to allow moisture from cream cheese to soak into wafers, and allow "easy peel" from muffin papers.  Since cakes were so small, I only put one cherry on top to allow the taste of the cheesecake to come through.

I LOVE cheesecake. Nothing says perfect like little serving size cheesecakes. Say goodbye to cutting sloppy slices of a large one. I've used this recipe at least twice since I came across it last week! And my friends and family can't get enough of it! The only thing I did differently was that I stuck with traditional crushed gram crackers and melted butter for the crust. I just don't like to stray from the most delicious part in my opinion.

I revised to Full-Size Lemon Cheese Cake. I was a bit hesitant at first as I am not sure I have ever made a cheese cake except from a mix, but I just went for it! I used a per-pared graham cracker crust and made the filling exactly as the original recipe except that I added 1 Tablespoon of Lemon juice. (I think I could have added 2 T. for more Lemon flavor). Baking time was a guessing game. I ended up baking it at 350 degrees for 30 Min. then turning down the oven to 250 degrees and baking for 5 more min. This was sufficient. I have never been a huge fan of cheesecake but I really loved this one! It didn't even need any topping as it was good the way it was!

These were very simple and easy to make kids enjoyed them! Only problem was crust..should have added butter and sugar to crust to keep from falling out of liners. I also made topping of whipped cream, strawberries, and chocolate chips in processor (my version of chocolate covered strawberries topping). These went faster than I could put them on the table for the family. Even hubby enjoyed them! Thanks for this quick and simple recipe and hope to make more soon with different topping and flavors.

I made regular muffin sized mini chzcakes. Yielded 10. I used lemon wafers for the base, just put it on the bottom whole. These were delicious, and everyone was impressed and liked them. I will def. double the recipe and make again for a gathering or pot luck.

Made these for a baby shower and they were really easy and pretty tasty. I found mini Nilla wafers and just dropped those in the bottom as per other reviews (I used mini muffin pans). Turned out very cute- especially with a drizzle of cherry pie filling glaze and a single cherry. The filling was yummy, but I agree that a traditional graham cracker crust (or an Oreo crust if doing chocolate) would have knocked these out of the park (the Nilla wafer was good, but a little blah in comparison).

I made these cheesecakes but had to completely improvise. I thought they were delicious, but the recipe was unclear about the cupcake size. I assumed they were regular cupcake size not the super small ones, so my ingredients and cooktime had to be completely changed. Oops! Make sure to specify the mini as SMALLER than the cupcake size.

These were super yummy.  I put caramel topping and toffee bits on my mini cheesecakes.  The only thing I would change is that next time I'll add butter to the cookie base.  I used graham cracker crumbs and when I bit into it, some of the mini cheese cakes had a crumbly base instead of  a nice crust on the bottom.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used my own cookie dough and neufchatel cheese so that it'd be lower fat, and I even used fat free condensed milk with no difference in taste whatsoever.  They looked beautiful, and I got tons of compliments!  The only problem I have with this recipe is keeping them in the refrigerator - I keep eating them!

Excellent recipe! I made these for my husband to take to work for his birthday. He kept im'ing me every few minutes with a play by play on the compliments that were being said to him. I used cherry pie filling and and blueberry pie filling. Next time, I might try strawberries (let them set in sugar and lime juice overnight for a syrup coated strawberry).

Very delicious, but the crust does not stay together well. Would add some butter to hold the crumbs together or just use one whole cookie since they are mini.

Really great tasting and very easy to do, I have always done it with actually putting the whole waffer in the bottom, it still tastes great with less work! May need to cook a couple of minutes longer however.

This recipe is wonderful.  It is a beautiful looking desert, looks fancy!  I too used crushed graham crackers and tasted great.  Be careful not to overbake the cups.  I used regular size muffin cups and perfect amount for an individual dessert.

i made these using a tsp of flour (to firm them up a bit) and a bit of extra vanilla. 

i also used the Vanilla Wafer Crust by Carol, which was really easy, (just use back of spoon to press down into cupcake tins).

I made one batch for 15 people and everybody absolutely loved them. there were even a couple leftovers for the next day.

(i topped some with seedless strawberry jelly, and some with chocolate shavings, both were great)

some good news: i also totally overcooked my first batch; they were brown by the time they came out, but they tasted just as great as the properly baked 2nd batch :)

I don't crush the nilla wafer, place it in hole, and it forms a nice bottom.

this recipe is so easy to make. my family & co-workers LOVED them. now i have to bring them to an upcoming christmas party. it's better if you make it a few days before so the cheesecake can settle and harden a bit. i used actual graham cracker crust instead and i find that it tastes better than the vanilla wafers.

Yum. They look cute and taste great. I used chocolate wafers instead of vanilla, because who doesn't love chocolate? Watch the cheesecakes carefully, so they don't overcook. Standard cheesecake rules apply for these minis. The cherry pie filling is nice time saver. Jam also works if you don't have it on hand.

I cut the recipe in half and used a homemade graham cracker crust and homemade strawberry topping. 

The cheesecake recipe is great, not too sweet and full of flavor. 

The cooking directions where also right on. For best results let cool before removing from paper.

I'd also recommend pulling out the creamcheese early to let it soften.

couldn't ask for a prettier dessert. I have made these three times and always receive compliments. I use regular sized muffin cups and instead of crushing the wafer, i just drop a whole wafer into each cup. Perfect fit. They are delicious, simple and beutiful with a fruit topping.

I've been looking for this recipe for years and I was happy to see it on this site!  I invited our neighbours over for coffee a few weeks ago and served them these mini cheesecakes.  They couldn't stop eating them and took some home with them.  The next day I gave them the recipe.  Thanks for sharing a classic!

These were a hit at a New Years Eve party I went to. I added melted butter to the wafer crumbs to help them stick together. They came out great. Great texture!

Excellent and so easy to make. My mini pans are the same size as the vanilla wafers so I just drop one in the pan, flat side down and add the filling. You might have to shave a little off the cookie with a serrated knife to make. If I can make anything a little easier in the kitchen without compromising the taste, I'll do it. I usually use cherry and blueberry pie filling but was disappointed with the blueberry, not enough fruit, mostly sauce. I found a wonderful recipe here on All Recipes for blueberry topping. Whenever I serve these everyone just loves them and thinks I spent hours slaving away. If they only knew. Thanks Janice

I have made these several times; so easy!!!  They are even better with just 1/2 cup sugar; it helps the cream cheese flavor to come out.  I serve with fresh sliced strawberries sprinkled with splenda.  Yum!  Always popular at potlucks

Very easy and tasty dessert. If you live where there are Kroger supermarkets you are in luck. They sell Kroger Brand mini vanilla wafers that fit right in the bottom of the mini cupcake pan liners. It is a perfect fit!!

A nice presentation - but did not taste quite like cheesecake - wasnt rich enough.  The crumbled wafers did not work for me either - I crushed them to almost a powder and the mini cheesecake base did not hold well together.  I would recommend using a whole wafer.  This recipe was very quick to prepare.

This was an incredibly EASY and scrumptious recipe!  It is also a great recipe to play around with to appeal to different tastes - depending on what you use as your "topping".  I did use the cherry pie filling and they looked very pretty and YUMMY!

I tried this recipe today, before Thanksgiving, and I was glad.  I did the crusched vanilla wafers instead of the whole wafers.  My  husband, the human test kit, didn't really like them at all.  There wasn't enough cheese cake taste to them.  He said they weren't sweet enough.  I think I'll stick to the regular cheese cakes from now on.

These were a huge hit at a recent party! I did choose to use a graham cracker base & almond extract instead of vanilla but followed the rest of the recipe as is. I definitely will start making these when bringing a dessert to a get together!

Made them plain, no toppings. No quite as good as an old recipe I can't find but still very good. My only problem was I couldn't find the mini cupcake holders so had to use the regular size and the vanilla wafers got lost in them as they were too big. But still tasted good and had to cook a little longer.

These mini cakes were a big hit. I used regular muffin trays so needed to add cooking time. I also added lemon zest to the mix to make the flavour pop. I was worried about adding the vanilla wafer crumbs without anything to bind it so I added melted butter and pressed the mixture to the bottom of the paper muffin cups. Thanks for an easy, great recipe. Iâ€™ll definitely make these again.

Wonderful recipe! I made full sized cupcakes. That creates about 18-20 cheesecake cupcakes. The baking time was longer because they were bigger, it was 25 minutes instead of 15.

I used less sugar and added a squeeze of lemon juice. I also made the crust with graham crackers and butter. They came out pretty good. Not the strongest cheesecake flavor in the world, but a nice treat considering the size and cook time.

I used regular cupcake sized tin. I placed a whole wafer in the bottom of the liner. I also added1 tsp of lemon juice along with the vanilla. They came out great! Topped with Lite Cherry and Blueberry pie filling, they looked so festive and I got lots of compliments!

It was easy to make though I wasn't sure if the Wafers should be crumbs or powder. I settled for in between and the base didn't hold together as I expected. But it tasted great.

This recipe was a huge hit. However, it is important that the cream cheese (and probably the eggs) are at room temperature. The batter was terribly lumpy and it took incredibly long to work the cold cream cheese lumps out. In the end, with cherry pie filling on top, the mini cupcakes were beautiful and festive. They tasted much better the next day. I was afraid they would get soggy so I added the cherry topping just before serving.

Also, I learned they are done when 'nearly set" (if you gently touch the top and it barely makes an imprint, they are ready to come out of the oven). I canâ€™t comment on the nilla wafer crust as I used a graham cracker crust.

This is a very good recipe. The only thing I changed is that I added a tablespoon or two of melted butter to the crushed vanilla wafers, then refrigerated the pan after I pressed a teaspoon into the mini cupcake liner. I think chilling them as well as adding butter, helped the create a good base crust. They baked beautifully and the liner pulled off nicely without anything falling apart. Also, for the people complaining that the mixture was lumpy, make sure to use room temp cream cheese, and mix each ingredient well before adding another.

I added 1/4 cup melted butter to cookie crumbs. I will use graham cracker crumbs next time just because I prefer the flavor. I also used Oreo cookie crumbs in some for a nice mix. I used blueberries on some and strawberries sliced thin on the others. It was a fun 4th of July dessert that everyone loved! I lined them  on a tray and made it look like a flag.

Great recipe.  Now that wafers come in mini size, you don't need to crush them! Just drop a mini wafer in the bottom of each of your lined mini muffins and proceed with the recipe.  Super easy and delicious. I topped mine with a dab of sliced strawberries and sugar.

These are Awsome! And to comment on Cheri whom made them in a different size tin cup... more liquid usually means more cooking time, the recipie says 15 mins for small Tins not 10-13 for a big Tin. ..You have to much liquid for so little crumbs as well I believe. ..Try it and follow Direction completely .  They do come out Devine!

Mini cheesecakes were a hit! They vanished almost as soon as they were finished. 

This recipe was a simple procedure and in total it took me 25 minutes. I used a beater to blend the mixture until it was light and fluffy.

Substitutions:
*Vanilla Wafers-Crushed Graham Crackers
*Cherry Pie Filling-Crushed Graham Crackers
Tips:
Make sure to let cream cheese get to room temperature before trying to blend ingredients. This helps the mixture easily combine. Don't move on to baking until all lumps are out of the blend.

While the taste was good, the texture didn't turn out well at all. I think the cream cheese should have been completely softened, that way maybe the batter wouldn't have been so lumpy and it wouldn't have been so grainy in the mouth. It had a very mild flavor, not quite with the tartness I was hoping for. I enjoyed it alright, but three of the kids didn't even eat theirs past the first couple bites. You win some, you lose some I guess!

Best mini cheesecake recipe ever. Like, I'm not even kidding. It tastes amazing and all my friends couldn't help but gush about how cute they look. They've never actually seen mini cheesecakes this small and that's what makes this recipe so great because not only do you get complements about how this tastes but also about how this looks. If cream cheese weren't so expensive I'd make a triple batch because these babies run out fairly quickly.

The cheesecake filling was delicious. I did add the juice of half a lemon and the flavor turned out great.  I dropped a Nilla wafer in the bottom of the baking cup instead of making the cookie base. Baked in regular muffin tins and added a couple minutes to the  baking time. My kids and I loved them.

I loved these. I added cookie crumbs (oreo crumbs and vanilla wafer crumbs) to them as I mixed the batter and they were delicious! My sister took these to her school the next day for a birthday treat and they all loved them! Excellent recipe as I love to bake and am only 12. perfect!

Excellent!  Used aluminum cake cups, also followed others suggestions.  I made full size cup cakes and it only made 20.  So in the future I will use 1/2 box of vanilla wafers and butter mixture.

I tried this recipe and it was great. This was my first cheesecake but it was easier than I expected. I made them with vanilla wafers and I could taste the cheese  cake that much but I think that was because I used half  crumbs and half cheesecake. I think next time I make these I will try the graham cracker bottom and less of it. Overall it's a great recipe but the crushed wafers instruction part of it was pretty vague but it was delicious.

This was my first baked cheesecake recipe, my family loves my no-bake cheesecake recipe but I wanted to try something new.  They adored it.  I made half plain with cherries and the other half chocolate, both were great.

I don't know what I did wrong but mine did not turn at all like the photo.  They stuck to the paper, sank down into the paper and I'm not sure they could be eaten at all.

used mini vanilla wafers for the bottom and these turned out great. Advice be careful and not get the cream cheese to watery or the wafer will float to the top. (Doesn't effect taste or presentation.) I doubled the recipe and still used only about 1 can of pie filling. I used cherry and blueberry  and it went first. Will definitely make again.

These are absolutely wonderful!  I used regular cupcake pans (made 36, with doubling the filling part).  I topped some with cherry pie filling, strawberry & kiwi slices and the remainder with chopped pecans, caramel and a chocolate drizzle.  I'll definitely be trying various combinations of these this holiday season!

I have made these several times & absolutely love them! I use regular size muffin pans & line with the foil & paper liners. I crush the vanilla wafers, then melt about 1/4 cup butter and put a teaspoonful over the crushed wafers. I add about 1 tsp of lemon juice to the main mixture. These are so easy & delicious!! Sometimes I add chocolate morsels, or a morsel mixture to the batter, sometimes, I just add a topping. Anyway you top them, they are awesome!!!

Absolutely easy to make.  It can be prepared within 15 minutes and another 15 minutes to bake.  Big on presentation but low on budget.  I have made these twice within a month and received raving compliments on both occasions.  I reduced the amount of sugar for the cake only because it is my personal preference, otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T.  Thanks for posting and sharing this recipe!!!

I love this recipe to give a perfect snack sized cheesecake. Instead of using vanilla wafers I did make a graham cracker crust to go with it other then that I followed the recipe to a T.

made these for bake sale last month, cookie too small for full size cupcake liner so made one with butter and van wafers.  Topped with cherry pie filling.  By popular demand, making them again for this month's sale. Yum

I made these in cupcake size. this reciped made 14. 12 were done with a graham cracker crust, with no paper cups, just cooking spray. Had no problems getting them out either. I filled them to the top, then got a bit scared cause they looked too full, but when they cooled and settled it was perfect for the pie filling. The last 2 I did in paper liners with the vanilla wafers, and I have to say I didn't like it as much. Great cheesecake recipe though, the family ate them up too! Thanks!

I ran out of cookies (was cooking for the masses) and so I used graham cracker crumbs in others. Turned out well and everyone enjoyed them. Even those who didn't like cheesecake.

These were definitely VERY good! i was in a hurry and just making them for fun so i didn't let the cream cheese get to exactly to room temperature so my batter was kind of lumpy and the end result not as pretty but they tasted really good! I served with homemade strawberry jam-ish topping on some and on others just three fresh raspberries and some chocolate drizzle garnish. I added a little butter to the vanilla wafers as suggested and it turned out perfect! definitely recommend taking the time to crush the cookies. very good I will make it again since i'm a cheesecake freak and this is so easy!

These were so easy and came out perfect.  I had never ventured down the cheesecake path before, but this recipe showed me how easy it can be.  I used lady fingers as the crust and used normal cupcake size instead of the mini and it all came out delicious.  I used mini chocolate chips in half of them too.

Quick and simple recipe.  I used the regular sized muffin pans and used cookies for some of the crusts and graham cracker crust for the rest. I added fresh peaches on top of the graham cracker crust and topped with the cream cheese mixture then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Very tasty! Be sure to use room temperature cream cheese. A nice light cheesecake recipe that makes enough for a crowd.

This is a fantastic recipe & so easy!  I reduced the quantities as I only wanted to make 24 and I used vanilla bean paste instead of extract and put about 2 tablespoons of maple syrup just cause I love maple syrup.  I also put sliced fresh sweet strawberries that I marinated in a little balsamic vinegar for about an hour just to make them even more sweeter and they were absolutely delicious!  They were so little that they were just one mouthful of pure delight.  It was like having a chocolate or something.  I also tried a few using strawberry waffers and they went really well with the fresh strawberries.  Somehow I managed to have a couple left over and they were even better the next day.  I have made these twice now and it most definitely will not be the last...thank you for this recipe :)

It tasted very good! i like how they were smaller and you could put some away and was easier to like take somewhere. The only thing i would really change would be the filling kinda mix things up or mix and match the fillings and make a mixture of them all. I would recommend this to anyone! it taste very good and a nice little pick me up!

i made this recepie and it was great! then i made it again with a twist. i added 1/4 a cup of baking coco and used gingersnaps for the crust topping it with pieces of candy canes for a decoration. my pickie eater of a man asked for seconds. this is a dessert that has quickly made the holiday table and because splenda works just as nicly in place of sugar i will make it again and again for any guest that comes over....though one tip if you wish to convert this to a full size cheesecake i would add a little melted butter to the crust to help it hold i would say 1/4 a cup would do that job nicely.

I added a little butter to the nilla wafers to make the crust because I was afraid it wouldn't stay together. I also used a regular muffin tin rather than the mini kind because that's all I had. My co-workers raved about these cheesecakes and one coworker told me they were perfect because they "weren't too sweet."

OMG, these are so easy and so tasty.  Make these instead of the box kind whenever you are craving cheesecake.  Just as easy and a lot better.

This was super easy to make and they were absolutely delicious.  They weren't quite as good as a real cheesecake, but almost and for the easiness factor, definitely worth it.  They've been a hit everywhere I've taken them.

This was great my kids gobbled them up, and they were a hit at a party I had. Next time I will do half with blueberry topping. My husband doesn't like cherry.

Thanks for the great recipe it was so easy! I poured this into an already made pie crust for a bake sale at work, we sold it by the slice. It was gone within an half hr! I will be making this again for sure, but maybe try it your way

Great way to have cheesecake quick and easy. The only changes I made were to add some lime jest and lime juice to batter. No fruit tipping. I also just dropped in a vanilla waffer for ease. Husband and father-in-law couldn't get enough. I also cooked in a water bath, no cracks, done just right.

These cheesecakes are yummy.  I put toffee bits, chocolate chips and strawberry pieces on mine.  If you do use cherries, make sure you chop them up first to make them easy to eat. These are a big hit with company and my boyfriend.
