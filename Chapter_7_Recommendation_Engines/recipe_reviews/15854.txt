This is almost identical to my grandmother's recipe, but hers calls for 3 cups rhubarb, only 3 T. flour and two eggs.  This might eliminate the spill-over encountered by another reviewer.  It shouldn't be runny; be sure to cool completely before cutting.  This is, in my opinion, the ONLY rhubarb pie to make, ever!!!!

What a wonderful pie!  In fact, my fiance cannot have enough of it! ;)... The only thing negative about this pie (except the fact that it disappears too fast!) is that the "custard" almost always goes over the plate during cooking, even with a deep-dish one!! I think the trick to overcome this difficulty is to put the rhubarb in a conic shape, so there is more room for the custard.  Once cooked, it is all "leveled".  I also tried to put 2 eggs instead of 3, it worked fine, but you still have to do the conic shape.

I changed this recipe just a little and it turned out great.  Instead of 4 cups of rhubarb, I used 2 cups rhubarb and 2 cups sliced strawberries.  After 50 minutes the pie was nice and brown and looked done so I took it out of the oven and cooled for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  When I cut into it, it was still liquid inside.  I had no choice but to throw it back into the oven to try and salvage it.  I baked it for 30 more minutes and much to my surprise it was still wonderful.  Next time I will bake it for at least 60 minutes no matter how brown it looks.  Also, this fit perfectly into a deep dish 9" pan, although it came right to the top.

I used frozen rhubarb, so I pre-cooked the fruit, flour and all splenda in micro at High for about 9 minutes, stirring at 3 min. intervals. I added 2 TBLS cream to the eggs and stirred that into the filling. Microwaved on 70% power for a few min. and baked for about 45 min in oven. Lovely! and Yummy too.

This pie is so good.  I made it for my dad because he requested it, not knowing there really was such a thing as rhubarb cream pie.  The hardest part of making the pie is the crust.  The best part of the pie is the "cream".  Delicious!

I just went to a family reunion-lots of farm wives with rhubarb recipes that are "just in their heads" They wont share. Now I've found one that will hold up to theirs. Fantastic!!

My mother-in-law has been using this same recipe since she was in college! I just made it for the first time yesterday. I made two! It took under five minutes (once the rhubarb was chopped) and was a snap! My husband was thrilled, as this is his all-time favorite dessert. I'm intimidated by pies, so I put off getting the recipe. I will probably make this at least once a week all summer!

This is an old recipe -- I know my grandma used to make it. However, when I make it EVERY TIME it is RUNNY!   So soupy you can't really even cut it but have to "scoop it out."  It's still delish though.

Made the pie exactly as the recipe. It stayed together fine. It was not runny at all. Baked for 55 minutes. It did not overflow out of the pie dish. I did use a deep dish pie pan. I will say that I personally did not like the pie. My husband and my mother however loved it. My mother has already requested it to be made again. I asked my husband what star to give it, and he said 4 stars. My mom I am sure would have said 5 stars. I like nutmeg, but think it has too much of it for my taste, and was a strange combo rhubarb and nutmeg. 

I am going to try another rhubarb cream pie without nutmeg. If you don't like nutmeg do not make this. You can taste the nutmeg a lot.

This is a wonderful pie meant for a DEEP Glass pie pan.  I often do this recipe and cheat I keep frozen pie crust in the freezer. I  add three eggs 3 cups rhubarb 1 tsp of flour and no spices pre heat the oven to 400  bake it at 400  for 10 minutes then drop the temp to 375 for 50 minutes the trick to this pie  is the same as a Quiche  insert a knife into the center if it come out wet and clean it it ready  to be cooled.  On the other hand if it still is gooey  reduce the temp on the pie to 325 and continue baking till done. this way your crust doesn`t over cook.. A short bread crust is always the best with this pie .. but for quick and easy...keep some crust in the oven  pie  from ingredients to oven in under 5 minutes  I use frozen rhubarb all the time  just thaw a bit  no need to cook just mix with the eggs, flour and sugar. This is a wonderful thank you gift...for any occasion..

I have been using this recipe for years and have been told many times it is the best!! I now buy my pie crusts and they are smaller than homemade ones so I usually double the recipe and divide into 3 shells. The baked pies freeze just fine. I also use a crumble topping instead of crust so cut back on the sugar in the pie to 1 c. and use 1/2 c. sugar, 3/4 c. flour and 1/4 c. marg. crumbled together for topping. Personal preference is to cut back on the nutmeg as well.

Haven't made this cream pie for many years, and this one was runny.  I think the rhubarb might have to be just wiped with a damp cloth before using, rather than washing it.  Rhubarb is mostly water, so any water clinging to the stalk would make the filling too runny. I'll try it again when I can find some more rhubarb!

I think I will stick to regular old fashion rhubarb pie with no eggs and no nutmeg and low sugar for a tart rhubarb taste.  This recipe sort of tasted like a cross between a quiche mixed with potpourri.

This is a wonderful, simple recipe. I made mine in a cast iron skillet and had no problem with "overage". Very good by itself and even better topped with vanilla ice cream. This is definetly a keeper.

I made this pie and followed the recipe to the letter.  Was in the over for less than 30 min, and almost burned the pastry.  I would suggest reducing the cooking temp to 350 after 20 minutes or till the filling has set.   Looks d-lish.

Very good mix of sweet and tart, and just mushy enough after cooling for a few hours in the cold storage. I did use about 3 cups rhubarb and a normal pie (not deep dish), and it didn't overflow. Added some ginger for zip.

This is identical to the rhubarb pie recipe that my grandmother uses. I just made it today with some rhubarb that she gave us from her garden, and my family LOVES it! My father even said that my piecrust is almost better than grandma's! Which is high praise indeed, because my grandmother is almost family legend for her pie! Even my sister, who is VERY picky and never tries anything new liked this!

I needed a quick, cheap, and thoughtful idea for Father's Day, and I found it with this recipe!!  This pie turned out fabulous and it was very easy to prepare, even for a college student!  My dad is a long time fan of strawberry rhubarb pie, I'm sure this one will win him over as well.  Thank You!!!

I changed the recipe a bit: 2 eggs instead of 3, cinnamon with a dash of chinese five spice because I didn't have nutmeg, added some sliced apple and I made a basic crumb topping with brown sugar, oats, flour and butter.  It is cooling now...

Perfect quantity for Pyrex deep dish. I made two extra for both neighbors and got great raves. One has never been a fan of rhubarb and loved it. I sliced my rhubarb thin on the diagonal to keep it tender and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use the nutmeg.  I put the filling into 30 tart shells and baked them for 25 minutes.  They set well with no run-over.
