This is THE BEST!!  I am proud to tell you that I was able to convert this to a bread machine recipe (okay, if that isn't truly a big deal, please don't burst my bubble, my nickname in high school was blonde roots).  I put the water, milk, sugar and melted butter in the machine first, then stirred in the yeast and let it all sit for 5 minutes.  I then piled the rest in as directed BUT I DID increase salt to a teaspoon and I DECREASED THE FLOUR to 3 1/3 cups.  I set the machine on the dough cycle and let it go!  When it was done, I put the dough in an oiled bowl and let it kinda rise again.  I followed the recipe the rest of the way as written.  It does taste a LOT like Pita and it is soooo good!!   THANK YOU!!!!  ***Added 7/3/2007, this recipe has been a family favorite. This is one bread that my kids actually bargain with me to make:). The ONLY thing I do different is I use my Wolfgang Puck Bistro Grill and fry this bread in a bigger batch. Thanks for giving my family something to reminisce about:).

This bread turns out almost identical to pita.It is extremely easy to make, but takes about a day to double in size. I reccomend spices or add-ins, for it is rather plain (but nummy!). Make sure not to roll it out too thin -- soft tastes great!

This is a fantastic recipe, I've used several different recipes for flatbread, and this is by far the easiest I've ever used.  I made a few of these with different additions, such as sun dried tomatoes, garlic, cinnamon&sugar and cranberries.

Very nice, clearly written recipe.  The end result was similar to Syrian bread.  The dough was very easy with which to work, and the stove top cooking was much less cumbersome oven baking. The bread itself can be used in a variety of applications. The recipe is a "find" and I will be using it often. Thank you, Kasienko

Kinda like pita bread, except I couldn't get it to cut like pita.  A little oily but very good all the same.  This will go bad pretty fast if you don't keep it in the fridge.

Turned out great. Reminds me of the fresh baked flat breads you get in Iranian restaurants.

Unfortunately, this hardly turned out the way I thought although I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted like Indian Bhatoore. The taste was fine but not like pita bread. I baked these in the oven and my husband found them better that way, at least saved on oil calories.

WOW! Very different. Very good. We love pita and this was similar but soft and puffy! The nutmeg gives it a very good taste, but not like you'd imagine. We'll be making this bread a lot! Thank you for this unique recipe.

amazing! I really did think I had nothing any more to discover about bread, but I was wrong!! very quick and easy way to prepare bread, and much more thrifty than having the electric oven on to bake it in. The bread itself comes out like pitta bread; it is a bit bland, but you can work around it I suppose. It freezes famously and I think it could also be cut to have a sandwich of sort. thanks for the recipe!

My mother made these when I was a kid many years ago.  She served them with butter and syrup like a pancake only much better.

I am not a baker.  That being said, I tried several recipes for flatbread from this site and found them lacking (for my ability).  This was, by far, the best and easiest recipe.  I did not use the nutmeg because I did not have any on had.  I tried them very flat and a little fluffy; baking and frying.  Baking makes it very crusty, as does rolling them out real thin - but less oily.  The ones I rolled out but not too much fluffed up during cooking.  I cut one of each in quarters and very gently opened it with a knife.  It worked just like pita bread.  Tasted better, in my opinion.  For the viewer that said the bread was bland:  maybe so, but store-bought pita (in my opinion) is bland, so.....  This recipe, however, wasn't as dry tasting as the store bought kind. I am so excited to have found a recipe i could actually follow with great success and am looking forward to adding garlic (to the butter) and other herbs for a different taste.

I have made this bread several times and really enjoy it. I didnt let the dough rise at all last time as I was in a hurry and it still turned out great. I also kneaded it for a few minutes and it still turned out great!

Thank you for the wonderfull recipe. The directions are clear and to the point. I followed the recipe as written, even to the point of NOT CHEATING on the kneading time. First batch is already gone. I am working on a second batch.

Heaven. The nutmeg adds a interesting flavor, and this bread tastes like naan bread.
