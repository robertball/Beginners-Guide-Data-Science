Excellent!  After I patted the pickle slices dry, I put them in flour; then egg; and then the bread crumb mixture.  I then put them on a parchment paper-lined pan and put them in the freezer for a couple hours.   I think that really helped the breading to stay on.  You may also omit the pepper(s) if you want it kid-friendly or you don't like spicy.  Minus the peppers, it tasted just like those at the Quaker Steak and Lube restaurants!   I found that the dill pickle slices work much better than spears.

These were fantastic!!! I added some dill weed to the bread crumb mixture, and worcestershire sauce to the beaten eggs. I'd recommend double dipping so you have a good crispy coating. They turned out great! Will definitely make again!!

I have fried pickles all the time, but I never added any spice.  These are great.  The ones I make I coat in cornmeal, because I first had them at a catfish place that did the same, but now this way I have a different way to fry my pickles..

My kids and husband loved these.  It was a fun after school snack, and I was able to cook and clean all within 15 minutes.

YUM! I've only made the pickles that were battered before, so I wanted to give this a shot to compare...these were way better, IMO! I LOVED the spicy kick of these! I halved the recipe, but only used 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper because my little guy was eating these too! We really REALLY enjoyed these and I will be making these often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Update: Made these for my FIL for a Superbowl appetizer. He really did not like them, but I thought they were good! I think fried pickles are an 'aquired taste'! Note to previous reviewer: I think that this might need paprika, maybe 1/4-1/2 tsp.? I am combining this recipe with one a friend gave me, also hers uses beer combined w/ egg to dip in. Might try that, too. Will update on taste.

Great but adjusted a bit.  For the bread crumbs to stay on the pickles and for a crispier crust, dredge in flour and then egg, back to flour and the egg then bread crumbs.  I thought the amount of cayenne was a bit too hot so next time I would cut it back a bit.  Otherwise, simple and flavorful....will make again :)

Made as written except that I used my deep fryer and these turned out great. Not ALL of the breadcrumb mixture stayed on no, but it was the perfect amount that did in my opinion. I served these along side of grilled burgers and this was a nice change from french fries.

Great tasting but I found it kind of hard to bread all of the pickles. Any suggestions on how to make it easier?

Perhaps it was the cheap pickles I used, but next time I will try a batter that also includes flour and milk. The bread crumbs added texture though, which I liked!

These are awesome!!!  I am not sure why one reviewer gave them 1 star for difficulty???  Quick and easy to make!!!  I also agree with another reviewer that they need more batter.  Next time will double dip them.

I am a fried pickle FANATIC...I've had them lots of different places and lots of different ways and I, personally, think the bread crumb version is FAR FAR better than the flour or cornmeal versions.  It makes a nice crunchy coating without being weighed down by heavy flour batter or gritty cornmeal.  I've been looking for a good bread crumb recipe and this is it!  Although, I do prefer spears for more of the pickle flavor.

These were awesome! Instead of oil I just filled the bottom of the pan with Pam spray and cooked them 3 at a time and then filled the pan again with Pam, for a healthier version! Turned out yummy!! Will make everytime I'm craving something sour and spicy!!

This was an awesome recipe. Plus it was super easy. I made no modifications, followed the recipe exactly, and they were FABULOUS!! My kids raved over them!! I have 14 month old twins who couldn't get enough of them...regardless of the spiciness!! We will be having these again!! Thank you for sharing!!

This was OK but a pain to make. Flavor was similar to the Deep Fried Pickles we enjoyed at Sanford's, a chain in the mid-West. I probably would not make again due to the labor involved vs. the "just OK" results.

OMG, I love pickles just as is, but when I came across this recipe from my foodie friends here, they suggested me to try this, and I LOVE THEM SOOOO MUCH, i loved the idea of spicy fried pickles, followed as is, but i served with a homeade thousand island type dressing instead of ranch since im not a huge fan of ranch. plus the sweetness of the dipping sauce balanced the spicy pickle since i added a lot of cayenne!

great recipe!  I added a bit more cayenne pepper for extra spice.  The family loved it for the football season kickoff.  I will use this recipe often.

Egg free & Peanut free version (youngest has allergies): Instead of the egg, use 3 tsp. egg substitute powder mixed with 4 TBSP water.  Instead of peanut oil, we used regular vegetable oil & they were still delicious!!!

I changed the recipe just a bit.  Instead of making them spicy I used 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 1/4 tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp natures way seasoning.  Also, I first dipped the pickles in plain flour first, then the egg mixture and then the bread crumbs.  Got a stomach ache from eating so many.  Yumm!

This is a really delicious item.  My son cut whole pickles a little thick, but even then, the dill isn't overwhelming.

These taste close to the ones that the restaurant in town makes that cost $5.00 for 8 small pickle spears.  I added a little Worcestershire and salt.  I still feel they need a little something but I can't pinpoint what it is.  These are really good though and a lot less expensive than ordering them.

I am an amateur when it comes to cooking anything, so i messed this recipe up pretty bad.  I replaced italian breadcrumbs with panko breadcrumbs and added italian seasoning to make up for it lol.  It was a huge mistake.  They were not even edible.  Lesson learned

These were delicious, I had a hard time getting the breading to stick to the pickle, I let the pickles soak for awhile. They stuck better, but still the breading fell off when they were being eaten. Still very good!!

This was a first for us.  My kids had these at a restaurant and wanted to try them at home.  The seasoning was good and I used home made breadcrumbs.  We used a jar of store bought pickles and some that I had canned myself.  Both worked and fried up nicely. They did like this version but will try the batter dipped variety next.

I thought these were easy and very tasty.  I made them almost exactly as the recipe suggests but I added about a quarter of a teaspoon of salt. I dipped them in Peppercorn Ranch which was a little spicier.

Awesome recipe, quick and easy. Definitely better than driving into town to eat them. Tastes best in a smoky ranch sauce!
