Zucchini Tots Haiku: "So here is the thing. These were just adorable, like their namesake 'tot.'" My daughter and husband perked up at hearing "Tots!" w/ dinner, and I thought these wouldn't disappoint, as whether it's shredded potato or shredded zucchini, we love both smooshed, baked and/or fried in any shape. But these were just too heavily seasoned w/ too many unnecessary spices and herbs. I'm just realizing now that I used parmesan cheese instead of cheddar too, and maybe I'm glad for that since all of the flavors seem to jive in a more Italian style than cheddar-ey. The texture was more soft and quiche-like, even though I baked them closer to 30 min., so if I was to make a similar recipe, I would drastically simplify the spices and herbs, possibly increase the bread crumbs, and bake a little longer. But they were cute, and maybe would've been better suited as a quick hors d'oeuvres bite, rather than a full side dish.

These were ok.  There is a lot going on seasoning wise, too much in my opinion.  These took longer than 20 minutes to kind of crisp up.  Thanks for the interesting recipe, but if I were to make these again, I'd cut back on the spices and use a blend of Italian cheeses.

Very tasty. I only put in oregano, not all the other spices. My reason for only 4 stars was I expected the outside to get crunchier.

These were the perfect solution to a lot of zucchini from the garden.  I used Seasoned Italian Breadcrumbs, but otherwise followed the recipe

Needs a bit tweaking to individual tastes, but easy enough to do. Good.

Delicious! I prepared the recipe for the first time and served the tots to my relatives as an appetizer.  We all loved the flavors.  Perfect recipe -- easy to make.  I chose sharp provolone cheese and may try cheddar next time.  Also, after reading the reviews I baked them at 375 for 20 minutes and the texture was perfect.

We liked these a lot!  I was looking for something different to do with zucchini, and these little gems fit the bill!  Plus, I love the herbs, particularly rosemary and sage!

Good flavor but needs more substance. Maybe I'll add extra bread crumbs next time. Also a tad overseasoned.
