This is easy, and you have to understand that you sacrifice taste for ease of prep and cooking. This as written is OK and makes a decent breakfast. The sharp cheddar and some salt/pepper to taste gives it some needed flavor, and it sets up nicely. I did take it down to 325 and let it bake for another 10 minutes, and the crust did not burn. If you want to spruce it up, you certainly can. This recipe screams for needing some sauteed onions and garlic. However, I didn't have the time to do that this time. If I were going to make this for guests, I would take the time to add some other ingredients/spices or find a more complicated recipe. Thanks Lilacs, I had a good breakfast this morning, and my toddler ate it up too. *Update-I have made this 4 times now. I use 5 eggs and a nice scoop of Miracle Whip. I add some onion powder, garlic powder and turmeric. It's so easy, and DD loves it. I freeze portions, and they reheat well in the microwave.

I didnt follow this recipe exactly, i sauteed onions in a tsp of olive oil on low heat until they were clear. After i layered the zucchini on the pie crust i sprinkled the onions on top. I then added the egg mixture, which i put a sprinkle of salt and pepper in. It was great!

Have to agree with others about bland taste. Very good starter recipe. I too added extras. Sautéed onion and bell pepper. Added fresh tomatoes to the mix also.  I don't do creative cooking, but with this I could do no wrong. I made it again and mixed the eggs with the zucchini and cheese.  After pouring into pie crust I added more cheese to the top.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I didn't have a nine inch pastry shell in the freezer and didn't have time to prepare my own, I ended up using the mini pastry shells I did have. Baked it for slightly less time, but they still turn out delicious. Very simple. The small size made them easy to pack to go to work for lunch

I am giving this recipe 2 stars, one for quick and one for easy. I was planning on serving this at a New Years Eve gathering so i might try it again, with the recommendations of the other reviewers. I'll add some sauted onion, cheese inside of the egg mixture and a little garlic salt, for more flavor.

I added mushrooms, chopped onions, a small can of chopped green chilis, S & P, garlic salt, and added a dollup of sour cream on top of each slice - salsa optional. Extra cheese on top, it was delicious.

It was a great start and I incorporated the advice of the other comments. Added salt and pepper, grated onions on top and I used Mozerella and parmesan instead of cheddar. Delicious and a great way to use the large zucchini. Baked at 325 for 40 minutes

I thought it was great, but I did add some salt, pepper, and turmeric on the zucchini before adding the eggs. Will definitely make it again.

I add onions and a small chopped hot pepper. I add the cheese and then pour the eggs over all. My family loves it and it’s super easy to make.

This was really good but I hate to rate something that I made changes to.  I used the basic recipe but decided to add some mushrooms and half an onion sauteed in a little butter to the zucchini and egg mixture.  Then I put a sliced garden tomato over the top of that mixture before covering with the cheese.  It was really quick to put together and tasted great.  I would make it again the same way.

The previous reviews are correct, this is a good basic recipe. I added sauteed onions, bacon and sun-dried tomatoes. With those additions the quiche was great. I also recommend you remove some of the moisture from the zucchini.

Ehh.  I added salt and pepper, bacon bits and more cheese and eggs.  Still was pretty mediocre, in my humble opinion.

This was very easy to make!  I didn’t have pie crust so I made it crustless.  I added seasoning to the egg mixture, salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder.  I think next time I’m going to use fresh onion, add some bisquick and use parm cheese instead of cheddar.

I added corn and salt and it was delicious!  Even my daughter who said she hated quiche when I told her what I was making liked it!  I also cooked it 15 minutes longer and hotter than stated as I don't like mushy quiche.

I used zucchini noodles and went crustless. Very easy to make and baked up beautifully.  However, I found it to be very blah. I would add fresh ground pepper with a little light salt. That is just my preferred taste.

Followed recipe but added 1/2 of yellow onion that I softened up in olive oil, a little bit of garlic powder and salt/pepper.  Very tasty!  I will make this again.

Made this recipe, after reading reviews, tweaked it to suit us, added 1 sautéed small red onion and garlic, also added Pampered Chef crushed garlic and peppercorn rub about 1 tsp sprinkled over the zucchini before adding eggs. It is still a quick dish, cooked about 10 minutes more than original recipe but every oven is different, would make again.

This was okay but not great. I sauteed some onions and added those as a layer above the zucchini. I also added salt and pepper to the eggs before pouring them into the dish. The flavor was good. For some reason my pie crust didn't cook through all the way on the bottom. I might tweak this one some more again next time...maybe add some peppers or other seasoning.

As a person who really doesn't like to cook, this was a GREAT recipe! it was real easy and tasted great!  the only thing was, after 30 minutes, it was still very sloshy. I ended up cooking it 50 minutes and it was perfect, (except it was a little long for the crust.)
