Excellent cheese enchiladas, just like we get in the taquerias here. This is authentic Tex-Mex. I had enough chili gravy though for two pans although we used it all, it was a bit too much and the next time I'll cut that in half. I used an American-Cheddar shredded cheese blend. I didn't fry the tortillas in the oil, just heated them in the microwave to make them pliable. The second time I made these I did fry the tortillas which takes only a couples of secs per side except it is harder to work with a hot hot tortilla. I was afraid they would be greasy after the frying, but they turned out great after all. I also used half the sauce the second time and it while it wasn't plentiful, it was still adequate. Thanks Rhonda, this recipe is going to get a lot of use in the future!

I tripled spices and added coriander another mexican seasoning- and instead of using tomatoe sauce - I had a can of diced tomatoes that I pureed cut sugar to 1 tsp. - did not add flour and this recipe was great! My husband even enjoyed it and mentioned how good it was!I changed recipe becuase of everyone stating it was pretty bland and mine had a great taste.  Doubled recipe and froze second batch for an wasy dinner ranother night! Come in heat corn tortillas, and put together for casserole, heat and eat!Really enjoyed this! Great for cooler nights!

Wow, I hadn't made enchiladas in a while and this was so easy. I loved that it didn't call for canned sauce. I didn't use the flour, I had a couple of tablespoons tomato paste I had to use up and that just worked perfect with the other ingredients. To cut the fat a little I used super lean ground beef, and I actually used the meat as the filler instead of cheese and topped with the rest of the sauce and sharp white cheddar.

I'm from Texas and let me tell you. This recipe is a staple in Texas. This recipe is almost right - except for the tomato sauce. Leave it out! Brown your flour before you add it to the mixture and use coarse ground chili meat instead of the ground beef. Be sure to drain the fat from the beef. Do not add sugar! And your tortillas should be yellow corn and make sure you fry them in corn oil to the point of a slight crisp..reason being - the tortillas will become soft once you put them together. American cheese works best and I top them with diced onion before I put them into the oven. Good Luck! Jennifer

I've never eaten enchiladas quite like these, but they are excellent. Spices are just right for me, but easily adjustable if you like hotter or milder. Easy to cut in half if serving only two, as is the case for wife and me.

This recipe was just "o.k."  My family was crazy about it.  Amazingly enough even with all the spices added it was rather bland...maybe add more salt.  The recipe says the flour is divided but I could never figure out why so I added the whole half cup to the 2 cups of water.  The meat sauce turned out fine but the enchiladas stuck to the bottom of the dish.  Maybe put some meat sauce on the bottom before putting in enchiladas and then pour remaining over top.  Interesting idea for enchiladas but probably won't be a staple in my home.

This chili type sauce is very common for Tex-Mex style enchiladas, as is Using American cheese. I sauted half the ground beef with some garlic powder, minced onion, cumin and lots of chili powder to use in the filling.  Also reduced the sugar and no flour as others suggested, and upped the spices in the sauce as well.  These tasted a lot like those at our favorite local restaurant-which are wonderful!

I only had 1 pound of ground beef, and so was forced to cut the recipe in half, but there was still plenty of sauce.  This got rave reviews at my house, and I will definately make it again.  It takes a little extra time and effort to lightly fry the tortillas, but it is well worth it. Not only does it make them pliable, but it makes them taste freshly made - something that cannot be achieved with a quick microwave zap. And once you do it a few times you get very efficient.  You just lay them out on paper towels and let them cool a bit before handling them.  Thanks for a delicious and budget friendly recipe!

This recipe is good, like another poster said, it's a bit bland, I added green chilies to the sauce and put the beef sauce into the tortillas itself. My husband loved these, first time making enchiladas.

I usually use a spice pack to make my enchilada sauce but was out and tried this recipe. I reduced the water by half and omitted the flour and sugar. These turned out to be very flavorful and moist. I'll never waste my money on the spice packs again!!! AWESOME!

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  I grew up in south Texas and have lived in Arizona for the past 25 years. Here, the mexican food style is Sonoran and much more "harsh" when it comes to sauces and seasonings than what I had as a kid and young adult.  As a rather novice cook, I try to follow every new recipe as close as possible.  I read several reviews before I try a recipe, and almost all have great ideas that I sometimes use.  Longing for that Tex-Mex flavor of my youth, I tried very hard to stick to this recipe to the letter, but circumstances drove me to small variations.  First, I couldn't find bulk American cheese (only those individually wrapped slices), so I chose equal parts of Colby and Monterrey Jack. Second, I had a pound and half of boiled London Broil I wanted to use up, so I shredded that and used it instead of ground beef.  Also, I have a cast iron griddle that I used to heat up the tortillas rather than frying them...I still used a spot of oil between every third tortilla and they were pliable enough to roll without a problem.  I will definitely make this again. My girlfriend and her daughter loved this dish. The next time I will put chopped onion in some of the enchiladas, as I remember they were done years ago.  Some reviewers of this recipe recommend doubling the spices. I'm not sure I agree. To me, Tex-Mex is more about the subtle blend of flavors rather than an over-powering burst of heat. If you want more heat, add hot sauce.  Thanks, Rhonda!

Being from San Antonio, Tex Mex is everywhere here. Some restaurants have fair enchiladas and some will make you never want to go back. If you are looking for an awesome at home version of original Tex Mex enchiladas, look no further on this site!! These were incredible. They had just enough spice to them, they were super creamy on the inside because of the American cheese (dont use Cheddar) and my family devoured all of them. I doubled the batch and made 24! Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe, will be our "at home" version of enchiladas from now on! Great topped with a few diced jalapenos! Yum!

This almost inside out recipe caught my eye. I'm glad I tried it, but equally glad that I read reviews first. I had to really modify based on other reviewers stating..."lack of salt and bland".  I highly suggest using chicken stock instead of water to fix this.  That alone would probably make it acceptable, but I did much more.  I keep homemade " mini cubes" of pureed, canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce in my freezer since they are very spicy and I don't want to waste a can when I need to add  a little punch to something. I tossed one into the sauce. I reduced sauce. I did this by eyeing measurements- approx. 2 1/2 cups stock and about 3/4 can tomato sauce.  No sugar.  Less Cumin. 2 TB flour added to browned meat thickened the sauce just right.  Added fresh minced  garlic & cilantro, and minced white onion to meat before browning. Tossed in a pinch of kosher salt.  Used a mix of American and Colby Jack Cheese.  Pretty much followed the remaining general preparation of this recipe as written and topped with green onion. It made a great meal and I'll make it again with these same changes.

I made this last night. It was very simple and cheap! Based off the previous reviews stating lack of flavor I made some alterations.

I only had a pound of meat so I was forced to cut the recipe in half. I sauteed onion just before putting the meat into the pan (which is something I almost always do when cooking with ground beef) and I doubled the salt and added some shakes of cayenne pepper and garlic powder to the mix. Bomb! 

I didn't fry the tortillas but I warmed them over an open flame and that worked just fine. Before filling the tortillas with cheese I dipped them into the meat sauce (in full enchilada style) and added a bit of the meat mix to them as well. 

Finally, before popping it into the oven I covered the dish in diced onion and freshly-chopped cilantro. Complimented the sauce very well. I will be making this again, it's very easy to play with the spices which is a plus. Great base recipe!

These were the Shhhh!  I grew up in TX & wanted to put the hype to the test.  I was very pleased as were all 6 daughters and wife!  We have picky eaters and everyone loved these.  I made too much sauce but it turns out it is perfect for a chili dog !  yum.

Omgosh! I cooked these last night and they taste just like the ones I used to order at El Chico's when I was a girl.  I only used one tablespoon of chili powder so they'd be less spicy for my girls but they still came out delicious!

Very Good!  My family of 6 all agreed I should definitely make it again! The next time I do, I'm going to try adding onions to the meat mixture and perhaps even inside the tortillas with the cheese.

I will admit I reduced the water to 2 cups, did not use oil for the corn tortillas and used cornstarch instead of flour as the thickener due to gluten intolerant family members. With that said, this was amazing. I did not change any of the intended flavor with my alterations so I am giving this a 5 star! My family raved about it and said the end result was like eating authentic tamales (and they LOVE tamales!! Thank you for a great recipe.

These are excellent. Used 1 pound lean ground turkey and added 1 finely chopped onion and jalepeno pepper to meat while browning. Replaced the water with chicken stock. Used a dash of cinnamon with the other spices. Also added diced green chilis with the cheese before rolling into the tortillas. Very good recipe. Thank you:-)

You know it's good when everyone at the table eats it!  We don't have good "Tex-Mex" where we live so this is my go-to recipe when we're craving enchiladas!  Only one change, I shred colby and pepper jack cheeses for the recipe instead of American.

So good! My husband and I ate every bite of this over 2 days. He's already asking when I will make it again. I did add green onions inside the rolled tortillas and on the cheese on top, but other than that I didn't change anything. Next time I think I will add some more salt.

It was good, but not what I expected.  I think it was a nice change for us to eat something different.  I added onion, and peppers, minced garlic to the meat.... I added the seasoning, but it was so bland I had to open up a pack of taco bell seasoning and add some to it... Maybe I didn't make it right... or it could be it was just different than what I am used to...

everyone that tries this when i make it asks for the recipe. it really is quite good... super easy. the only thing i recommend is this: half the cumin and add just a little more paprika and chili powder instead. here's why: all the cumin makes the sauce taste like taco seasoning packet mix. halfing the cumin lets you taste the garlic and lighter flavors a little more than ALL cumin. thumbs up for a great recipe!

These taste almost exactly like the enchiladas I grew up eating. For our tastes, though, there is about twice as much chili as we need, so I saved it for another batch. These are *very* Tex-Mex...mild, not spicy, which makes them the ultimate comfort food, in my opinion. They are quick, but if you want save even more time, just layer this for a casserole. Either way, so tasty.

I made a few changes to the recipe.  I added only half of the tomato sauce and then substitute the rest with salsa.  I omitted the salt, flour, water and sugar.  I didn't fry the tortillas. I put some tomato sauce in the dish and I rolled the meat inside the tortillas.  The rest of the meat were just put at the top and then a layer of cheese. It was quite good.

I used this as a base recipe.  I used flour tortillas (more common in Canada than corn) and filled them with beef and cheese, instead of putting the beef in the sauce.  I used my own favourite seasonings, and put some taco sauce in with the tomato sauce (medium or mild depending on what is available and who is eating it).  I really love these, and everyone I have made them for loves them too!  I am sure the original recipe is fantastic, I just wanted to try them the way I made them.

I followed the recipe exactly and found the meat sauce a little bland, as others have.  Adding sauteed onion and some Arizona seasoning (2 tbls) from Penzey's made this dish much better. 
I was puzzled by the flour being divided, though.  No mention of what to do with the second part.  I added it to the meat as it browned.  That made the meat mixture nicely thick after adding the tomato mixture.
I'll definitely make this again with the enhancements I cited here.  This might be a good pot luck dish.

Very good Tex Mex flavor--the best recipe that I have found so far.  I grew up in South Texas and now live in Florida--haven't found any good Tex Mex here so I try to make the dishes that I grew up eating at home.  I used Gebhardt chili powder which I think gives an authentic flavor.  Definitely will make this recipe again.

Regardless of the amount of seasoning they really weren't flavourful.  I followed the recipe and didn't make any changes.  I went ahead and fried the tortillas as well.  I'm not sure what it's missing but I was expecting a robust flavour...they were good but just needed some more flavour.

Really enjoyed this recipe overall.  We substituted 20oz ground turkey for the beef, added an extra 8 oz tomato sauce for some of the water, and used 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper in place of some of the chili powder.  This combo was good and very flavorful, but Hot on the spicy scale (for the midwest) maybe a solid medium for those of you who are used to spicy.  Next time I would try a tsp of Cayenne.

I have never attempted to make enchiladas because I had been told it was time consuming and difficult to match the ones at your favorite Mexican resturant...well, wrong and wrong again. This recipe was quick and easy and the family and I loved them. My only regret was that I didn't double the recipe so that I could have more leftovers for lunch.  Definately a keeper.

Good with the exception of the flour and water. It made the sauce too pasty and thick.  Plus it made twice as much sauce as needed and I used a lot.

Excellent!  I did as another reviewer did- decreased the water in half and did not add flour or sugar.  I used flour tortillas.  Added 1 onion chopped up,   Everybody loved it. I MADE THIS A SECOND TIME- I didn't have enough chili powder and only added 1 Tablespoon and it was great that way too.

I followed this recipe with only one substitution - I used Monterey Jack cheese instead of American. Overall, I think it is a good base but it definitely needs more spice IMO. Next time I think I will add some cayenne pepper to the mix.

Very good and simple to make.  I had to add about 2x the amount of spices to get the taste I like.  Next time I would recommend more tortillas rolled into smaller (taquito) size to offset the amount of cheese and sauce.

I made 1/2 flour and 1/2 corn. My husband and I liked the flour better. My 11 year old daughter did not like at all. I think it needs a lot more spice. I will not be making again. Thanks anyway.

This was really YUMMY!!  I had to make a few minor changes due to ingredients on hand.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce, and I added a packet of Goya Sazon seasoning.  I did not have american cheese, so I used a pouch of Kraft Nacho pre-shredded cheese and Mild Cheddar shredded cheese.  I also used flour tortillas because I personally do not like corn tortilla's...that is a personal preference.  I probably used more cheese than the recipe called for just because we LOVE melted cheese!!  I also made sure that I cooked down the sauce to get the consistency that I preferred.  I also used left over eye of round roast diced up....what a great use for left over beef!!  The whole family loved this...can't wait to make it again!!  Thank you!!

BEST enchilada's i've ever had!  I used 1 lb of ground beef.but kept the spices exactly as called for.  I was hesitant to use flour mixed w/ water.  But what it does is act like a roux.  The meat sauce was a dark rich brown, and when you add the flour/water, it lightens the color up a little and i guess makes the sauce a little thicker. I used 1 cup of water for the meat and 1 cup water with maybe 4 tbsp flour mixed.   For those complaining the chili was runny, i think the flour/water makes it thicker. Because you can see just by making the sauce how runny it is before adding flour. ALSO, the corn tortilla's can be heated on just a plain heated skillet. They are just as pliable, heating according to instructions on package. I did use El Pato spicy tomato sauce which gave it a kick.  If you can't find it, then kick up your tomato sauce yourself...can't be that hard.  I hate my Chili, but NOW i've found a new chili recipe...So i've found 2 recipes in 1.  Lol!  Hey! Thanks for posting, made my day.

Really good enchiladas!  I'm new to cooking so I thought for sure I'd mess this up (seeing as how I've burnt water before), but it was a piece of cake.  I subsituted the tomato sauce for red enchilada sauce instead thinking it would be spicer...little did I know I bought mild sauce.  Want to make these again, but really make them spicy the next time.  This is a definite recipe keeper!  Thanks!

Good and less fussy to make than many enchilada recipes. I did add an onion, 4 cloves of garlic and cilantro to the meat mixture as others have suggested. Also, just heat tortillas in the microwave - easier.

Terrific!  I make dinner for 80-120 people and had 1 gallon leftover spicy chili, so I just lined 3 chaffing dishes with corn tortillas (not fried) and layered on top: 6# shredded cheddar cheese, 1 gallon chili, 6# shredded pepper-jack cheese and sliced black olives.  Served with tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream and "mexican bean and rice salad" (with avocados and lemon).  It was de-lish!

These are OK, but nothing special. I doubled the spices as others suggested, and I agree that without that step they would have been much too bland.

Not even all that cheese in the center could save these enchiladas.  They are terrible.  I am from Texas and this is NOT Tex Mex.  It's terrrrrible.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!  As others had suggested, I doubled the spices including the salt (not the sugar.)  I can't imagine how bland and watery it might have tasted without doubling!  I used a Mexican cheese blend instead of the traditional Tex-Mex American cheese.  That is the only switches I made to the actual recipe.  Though I did have some refried beans and a 1/4 of an onion on hand that I threw into the tortillas.    OO and I found I had more than enough of all ingredients to just roll up 6 extra tortillas.  SUPER yummy!  I only gave it 4 stars because the spices needed to be doubled.

I wanted to use a full 3 lbs. of ground beef, so I used the calculator and used those amounts. The only change was I used 4 c. of water instead of 6 and a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce.  Had to use my extra large lasagna pan to fit it all! Also heated the flour tortillas for a few seconds in the microwave rather than use the oil. Topped with a combination of Colby and Monterey Jack and sharp Cheddar shreds. It came out wonderfully! We will definitely be making this again. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I was born and raised in Texas and miss Tex-Mex food. This receipe wasn't that hard to make and can easily be changed to the taste of the person making it.  I made it to the receipe's instructions, with the exception of using only 1 lb of ground meat, and it was good. I think next time I will add some sauteed onion into the cheese enchiladas for added flavor and will try the short cut of microwaving the shells instead of frying them. My husband, who can be picky and fearful of trying new foods, loved these enchiladas! If the sauce taste a little bland and a little extra of the spices.

Great recipe. I used flour tortillas instead of corn. I also made 12 enchiladas and baked them all at once instead of only 6. I added refried beans to the tortilla with the cheese. I didn't think it was spicy enough, but I used taco seasoning instead of individual spices, which could have been my problem. This recipe is a keeper!

This was very good. My fiance loves mexican food and freaked out over this. I doubled the spices and added another 2 cups of cheese (I'm from Wisconsin). I put this in a 9x13 pyrlex dish and I did not have a problem with these sticking. However, the pan was heaping so I put some aluminum foil underneath when baking. I'm glad I did because there was some overflow. Also, I'm not sure how 2 Tblsp of oil can last for all 12 torillas. I ended up using about 1/2 cup total.

This recipe is so delicious! It was everything I was hoping it would be. I found the spices to be just perfect, and I like my food flavorful, not bland. This makes an awful lot of sauce, so the next time I make this I will use half and freeze the other half for another meal. Great dish!

I added a whole tomato, half onion, jalepeno, and cilantro to the beef while cooking. Also added a bit of comino. I used cheddar and american cheese. Only gave it four stars because the gravy was a bit runny and the tortillas were crunchy on the bottom. Probably my fault. Overall, delicious!

I grew up in san antonio.. meaning I grew up with this tex-mex style enchilada.. I have searched for a recipe like this forever... I gave 4 stars only because I added a LOT more of the spices and more salt as well as a can of mild rotell to the meat & onions to the cheese.... the taste is spot on... I plan on making these again and again.. brought back some great memories,THANK YOU!!

I make  this at least twice a month. I do increase some of the liquid and spice ingredients to make a little more sauce. I strain the meat from the sauce and use it to make a pan of beef enchiladas along with a pan of cheese enchiladas. My family loves it!!

The sauce came out a bit bland. Ended up adding quite a bit more salt plus cayenne pepper. I was surprised the recipe doesn't call for onions or bell peppers, so I added those as well. The sauce mix came out too watery. Not sure what went wrong with that. Otherwise, good recipe that just needs a little tweaking.

This was really good.  Of course I made some changes.  I used EL PATO brand mexican tomato sauce- it has a kick to it.  Also, I used cheddar and asadero cheeses instead of american.  My husband said it was the best homemade enchiladas he's ever had.

I only had 1 pound of ground beef, so I used a can of kidney beans and a can of corn to help make up some of the bulk of the meat. It is a great consistency and I think it would be a little too thick if we'd used a full 2 pounds of beef. I used 16 oz of tomato sauce rather than 8 oz, and only 2 cups of water and it's still a little bland. Next time, I'd use 24 oz of tomato sauce and only 1 cup of water. I also added a small onion and 4 cloves of garlic to the beef mixture. Otherwise, followed the recipe as written and the spices are just right for my kids and a little less spicy than I'd like. My only real issue with this recipe is the lack of flavor to the sauce. The spice is there, but the flavor seems diluted by all of that water.

This recipe was Okay.  The flour REALLY thickened the sauce, a little to much for my taste causing the enchiladas to be really really heavy.  If I make this receipe again, I think I will omit the flour so the sauce will be a little more spreadable.

I’m from Texas and we all love our Tex-Mex and this recipe is awesome. I made this for my hubs back in April, he loved it and I made only what we needed with leftovers for another meal and froze the remainder of the chili sauce. Which was better the second time around. I finally, was able to make it for my sons and their wives. All four of my boys cook and they all want the recipe. The only thing I would change is the sugar, I’m going to reduce, maybe omit it the next time I make these. It says, serving 6 but I fed 10 and it made 29. We had a few leftovers.

I usually add a bit more water and flour to the mix. Sometimes mine comes out without much gravy without it. Also do not skip the oil on the corn tortillas. You will get rock hard enchiladas.

I have made this several times for my boyfriend and every time I  turn around he requests these. The first couple of times I made them in to enchiladas. After a while thought I found out it is just easier to make it like a lasagna. I also started adding extra cheese. We also get American Boar's head cheese from the deli and fresh tortillas from the bakery. He said it tastes even better now

Overall the taste of the dish was good, but the chili got too thick and heavy, which overpowered the enchiladas.  I would like to make it again, but will cut back quite a bit on the flour to may be 2 T as opposed to 1/2 cup.

I took the advise of some of the comments and used flour tortillas instead. Came out perfect!

I doubled the seasoning and it was still so, so bland. I was very disappointed. My boyfriend loved it though which is why I give it two stars.

I added some Cardamom, and used chicken broth in place of the water,  but pretty much followed the recipe.  My boyfriend said it's the best homemade enchiladas he's had.

I thought it was delicious and so did my husband who is a picky eater. I do think it needed ,maybe, a tad bit more salt. Although my husband did not.  I only did 1lb of ground beef so i halved all ingrediants. Next time gonna change cheese l like a creamer cheese.

This recipe is dead on Tex Mex style! He is super picky about enchiladas and he LOVED these. I will definitely make again. I did not use the flour or sugar, but next time I will at least use the flour and extra water for thickness of the sauce. Delicious!!!!

Wonderful!  I made as written and it is very close to my favorite TexMex restaurant.  I might experiment with replacing about 1 cup of American cheese with Cheddar or Jack and see what that does.  It tastes even better at the next meal.

Overall, I thought sauce was really good.  To me it seemed as good as what I would expect from a restaurant, maybe a little on spicy side for my taste right now (pregnant with constant heartburn), but the kids and hubby did not complain.

I am not an enchilada fan because I have never liked the red sauce.  I was very skeptical but my husband loves cheese enchiladas so I told him to make it and I would taste it.  I asked him to put mine in flour tortillas and he used corn for his.  They were absolutely delicious!  I took them for lunch the next day and they warmed up great! This is definitely a staple in our home!

I've made these several times now and they are a HUGE hit in our family. I do use shredded cheddar cheese instead of American, but that's the only change other than 3 not 4 cups of water. Excellent!!!

Based on reviewers comments I food processed a small can of tomato sauce and a can of rotel and added it instead of one plain tomato sauce. I also increased the spices by a little. The whole family enjoyed it.

Made this tonight and followed the recipe almost exactly. The only change was that I used 2 cups sharp cheddar cheese and 2 cups colby jack cheese instead of american and I warmed the tortillas in microwave. My family loved it!!

I didn't have chili powder, so I made my own. 


For tomato sauce, I used equal parts tomato paste and water, with a little salt added in.

Both my sauce pan and baking dish were too small, so I used only three cups of water.

My family loved this. I used grated cheddar because that is what I had. I will definitely make this again.

A big hit with the kids!  I halved the meat/sauce amounts and it was still plenty for covering.  I probably used more cheese than called for, as we like the enchiladas quite cheesy!

This was a pretty nice dish. I tried to make it exactly as written. My ground beef was 85%, the cooking oil was "vegetable" (soybean), and the tortillas were packaged as a little smaller 5 1/2" size. Also, since the only American cheese I could find was already in slices, I used mild Cheddar instead. I did notice a tiny mistake in the recipe: I saw no reason for the flour to be "divided" as mentioned in the ingredient list. This made a very filling dish, which lasted me for four dinners. It was kind of mild (I love spicy food), but still had lots of cheese, meat, tomato and tortilla goodness. It actually took me back decades to a boxed "Taco Casserole" dinner I had a lot when I was a kid - though the form was slightly different, the taste seemed to be almost identical. Not an awesome recipe, but I did enjoy it a lot.
