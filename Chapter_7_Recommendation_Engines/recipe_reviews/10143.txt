Great frosting. i used it on top of chocolate cupcakes and it was fantastic. I tinted all different colours and it mixed really well. It was a bit too stiff to work with so i put it in the microwave for 15 seconds and it was slightly more creamy. It holds its shape really well. So tasty!

I just tried this after finding out that I was out of shortening to make the buttercream frosting I usually use for cupcakes/sugar cookies. I am impressed! I used powdered (reconstituted) milk and it still turned out great. It set up quickly and spread wonderfully. I will use this instead of the other since I never really liked tasting the shortening anyway!

The frosting was tasty, though it was a bit too sweet so I added more butter and less sugar. It was also good with cocoa and melted chocolate.

Nice, basic and dependable butter cream frosting, but just a tad on the sweet side if you use all the powdered sugar called for.  I stopped at 3-1/2 cups and found it just right, although as little as 2 cups would have worked too.  I didn't measure the milk, as how much you use depends on how you plan to use the frosting, and in my case I piped it, so I'm sure I used less than the recipe directed.

Good basic butter frosting recipe. I suggest adding the milk and sugar slowly checking for taste and consistency until it reaches your liking. Easy to add  ingredients to this icing to make unique flavors. For example, mix in: 
Cocoa powder = chocolate icing
Instant coffee + cocoa powder = mocha icing
Lemon juice = lemon icing
Lime juice = lime icing (great on coconut cake)
Orange zest = orange icing
Dollop of Peanut Butter = pb icing
Maple Syrup = Maple icing

This was so easy!!  My cousin and I made this at 2 am to frost a lemon cake.  We added lemon extract and yellow food coloring to the frosting, and it was really good!  Just make sure you put in enough of the powdered sugar, or it will get a bit runny and drip out the sides of the cake... Still tastes good, but looks kinda weird!  Also, I'd recommend sifting the sugar before putting it in the frosting.  We didn't do this because we didn't have a sieve handy, but I think it would have eliminated the somewhat gritty texture (that's why I gave it 4 stars).

I halved the sugar in this recipe and all my family still said it was way too sweet. It was kind of grainy although I beat it very well.

This recipe is extremely easy to make. I used 4 cups of confectioners' sugar instead of 4 1/2 cups. I also used fat free milk. The frosting is very sweet but delicious. I recommend not making the frosting ahead of time. The frosting gets this weird textured if sitting to long.

My kids really enjoyed making and eating this frosting!  We ended up using 1/2 cup butter, an extra cap full of milk and an extra cap full of vanillla extract to make it perfect.

Loved this frosting.  Came out a great piping consistency.  Tried to duplicate the candy corn colors for fall, but messed up the color order.  They still came out cute, and my daughter's volleyball team loved them!

This was my first try making icing. I added extra icing sugar because it seemed a bit runny to me. I used a few drops of food colouring and then put it into plastic sandwich bags with the tip cut off to pipe it onto cupcakes and it was great! The icing hardened to keep its shape.  I'm really happy to have a recipe without shortening that I will definitely use again.

GREAT! This is so good: I had my family eating just frosting. Because I was making a coconut cream cake, I added...coconut. Spread on white cake. This is amazing! :)

Very good!  It didn't get all hardened up and crusty and did not require refrigeration like most homemade frostings said.

I was looking for a frosting to frost "Amish Cookies" from this site and this one seemed to fit the bill. Nothing beats butter for frosting and the sugar is easily adjusted for the amount of sweetness you desire. I only used 3 1/2 cups sugar and, despite that, actually had to add a little more milk to get the right consistency to pipe onto my cookies. This is a recipe I will definitely use again!

This was such a good recipe.  I don't think I'll bother looking for another butter frosting now that I've discovered this one.  The texture was perfect and it tasted great.

These are the exact ingredients my grandma taught me how to use! I didn't even know a recipe was needed. We always just eyeballed the ingredients. If it was too wet we added more powdered sugar, too sugary and we added a little more butter, and if too thick we added more milk about a teaspoon at a time. I don't think that it is the best frosting, as it is so super sweet, but it is a very simple frosting that even a kid can make. Cocoa can also be added to make a chocolate version. Although, this frosting will not harden up like a royal or cookie icing, unless the cookies are froze! So, don't plan on using if you're trying to make fancy cookies to take some where and need a hard type icing.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out just right.  I iced my cupcakes and they looked absolutely beautiful.  For me, personally it came out too sweet... Which I should have known before hand by just reading the ingredients.  Next time I think I'll try a different frosting/icing recipe and save this one for homemade cinnamon rolls.

My family has been using this all my life. We never had a written recipe, just "a glob of butter, a splash of milk" etc. If it turns out too runny you can add more sugar, too thick you can add more milk. Instead of using vanilla you can use orange, banana, almond extract etc. Some people say it comes out grainy and to sift - I've never sifted; use a hand mixer. It fluffs it up a bit, too.

I used sour cream instead of milk, with great success. Tasted fantastic! Also used a bit more butter than was asked for, 1/2c. Made this way, it was thick and spreadable, but also pipe-able! Everyone really enjoyed it. Be sure to use it on a cookie or cupcake that is not too sweet. This frosting is plenty sweet. =)

Quick and easy recipe for frosting.  Cut the recipe in half as I didn't need too much (only needed some to write on Humungous Cookies from this site).  Even cutting the recipe in half, I used less than half the amount of icing sugar, probably only 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 1/4 based on half recipe.  Found it sweet enough this way.  Good stuff!

A good, simple butter frosting.  If you prefer a bit more of a buttery flavor up the butter a bit or add butter flavoring.

Good Icing.  I added double the butter because it was still really thick and tasted really sugary and less buttery. I aslo had to add a little more milk, but only like a teaspoon to get it to a spreadable consistancy.

I think I did it wrong, it came out way too sweet and not very buttery tasting.  Easy to make tho.

This was perfect.  I used about 4 cups of sugar and it was the perfect consistency for piping.  I also added 1t cinnamon for chocolate mocha cupcakes with cinnamon buttercream frosting. UPDATE: when I served my cupcakes directly out of the refrigerator, the icing was very dense. In my experience, it's best to pull it out about an hour before serving and allow it to soften a bit.

Great recipe! Finally a frosting recipe I can use over and over with my sugar cookies!  I did use almond extract since I didn't have vanilla at the time.  It turned out great and my hubby isn't the almond flavor type, he said it tasted like a "hint" of almond, and wasn't overpowering, he loved it.

This is maybe the sweetest frosting I've ever had!  It made the roof of my mouth tingle.  I like that, but be advised if you don't!  It looses points because it didn't set up well for me and slid off the cake.  Probably need to keep it refrigerated.

This recipe is fantastic!  So delicious and better tasting than frosting made with shortening.  It thickened up and I decorated my cake with no problems (including piping with various tips).  I used slightly less sugar and adjusted the milk accordingly, it worked great.  I also used mostly vanilla and added some almond extract, I recommend it as it added such a nice flavor.

i used these to frost cupcakes for a bridal shower.  loved the taste, but it wasn't a great choice for decorating.  it wasn't stiff enough for some of the piping i was doing but it worked well enough.  thanks!

Ultra sweet...but what do you expect with all that sugar. Anyway for those who stated that it was gritty, you MUST sift the powdered/confectioners sugar while mixing the ingredients. It makes all the difference.

This is hands-down the BEST frosting I've ever used! The ONLY change we made is the addition of about a tablespoon of milk, but other than that, it's perfect as-is. Just sweet enough, and not buttery or greasy, like some of the shortening-based frostings. I'll use this recipe forever!

I'm not sure why this is called a butter recipe since there is absolutely no butter 'taste'.  It basically tastes like powdered sugar -- very, very 'sickly' sweet.  This might be good for sugar cookies, but not much else.

We love this frosting!  It is so easy to make and frosts so nicely.  Beats the canned frostings to heck.  I had only a few cupcakes to frost (4-6) and I reduced the servings to 12 and it was the perfect amount.

Yum. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  This time I was in a hurry so I read the ingredients, threw it all in a bowl and beat it - still turned out perfectly, even though I didn't follow the instructions.  Kids are enjoying the beaters right now!

I never beat in the remaining sugar.  It was sweet enough as it was, and the consistency was fine.  There was certainly enough frosting to frost a cake.  Easy and everyone liked it.

Great recipe! It was very sweet, but I made it for a spice cake that wasn't very sweet so it worked perfectly. I suggest if you do not want it as sweet halving the milk and the sugar or it won't be the right consistency.

I changed this recipe so much that I am not sure it is even the same recipe, but I loved the way I made it.  So here it is:  4 cups powdered sugar.  1/3 cup milk.  1 stick melted butter.  1/2 large lemon juiced.  Mix together starting with butter then alternating liquids.  It was thin, but zingy and yum, yum, yummy.

Yum! I whipped this frosting up in no time at all. I decided to replace the vanilla with almond extract and smear it on top of pink cupcakes for Valentine's Day.

Ok flavor, but it looked like when a cream sauce gets too hot and separates. I did use Almond milk rather then regular milk, so I don't know if that was the difference. I also only used 2 cups of sugar. I probably won't use this recipe again.

I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar and wasn't able to sift it and this is absolutely the best frosting ever. It puts my favorite bakery's to shame...I will def be making this my go to frosting!! Even with the less sugar this is still firm enough that would be great for decorating cookies as well :)

not the worst frosting in the world but it was sicky sweet.  It might be better for icing cookies but i used it for a cake and not so good.  Luckily it was just the crumb coat so I can use a different recipie for the final layer.

Overall this is a good recipe. However, it is really sweet and I'm even a sweet tooth. I'd use a lot less sugar and add more butter. It was easy and fast to make though. And looked great on my chocolate cupcakes.

I didn't like it.  Then again, I've yet to find any home made frosting that I like.  With how much powdered sugar you have to put in it, costwise it's just as cheap to buy a can of good frosting at the store!

Good taste wise.  A hair thick at 1/4 cup milk. Like other reviewers I ended up using 1/3 cup and it was perfect on my red velvet cake (Hershey's from this website).

this is a great basic recipe...I added a little bit more butter than the one-third cup because it was really sweet and it was perfect.  Easy to color or decorate.

I used this for an orange cake, and it was wonderful! I did have to add a little more milk because it's very thick, and I also added about an extra 1/4 tsp vanilla. Very easy to make.

Making this frosting is easy and quick. My daughter and her best friend think it is the best frosting they have ever tasted. Will make it again and again.

Good although it tastes like plain confectioners sugar.  I would add more flavour.

I used vegan butter and cashew milk as many family are vegan and lactose intolerant.  It came out good. I used it on a Santa Clause pumpkin cake. It is a little sweet so next time I will try to lessen the sweetness if possible.

It was good! But didn’t have as much taste as I wanted. I’d add some vanilla or another kind of oil and some salt!

I found a bundt cake on this web site ("Too much chocolate cake"), try it, it is SO moist, I'll never try another, the recipe is the bomb. I do a different flavor cake and icing each time I make it. This time I made a Cherry Chip cake. I usually "doctor" up canned frosting to enhance the cake. I had no canned frosting so off to Allrecipes I went.  All the recipes called for crisco, and or flour, I didn't want to use those. Then I came across this one.  Very simple ingredients, I substituted Almond extract for the vanilla extract. Oh my, I have used this combination of ingredients many times for frosting and the frosting NEVER tasted like this. It must be the order in which you mix this. It is light and heavenly. The almond flavor went beautifully with the cherry chip cake. I will never doctor up canned frosting again. This is the one!

Made it per instructions with the exceptions of doubling the butter and I also used 1/2 a vanilla bean and heated it in the milk. Afterwards I let it cool and scraped bean out. It gave the icing a nice authentic vanilla flavor.

Super easy to make and perfect texture. I used a little less sugar and a little extra butter for my preference, but that's the best part.  I love recipes that are flexible.

this butter frosting was so bad. It was grainy and way to sweet. This felt like i was eating watery grits but worse. I do not recommend this frosting for you . You mine as well go to the store and get icing.

The frosting was a liquid and tasted a lot like powdered sugar. But I don't know if I added the right amount of sugar.  But I would add shortening to it.

I used 3.5 cups of confectioner's sugar. It is plenty sweet. Since it is not 4.5 cups, my frosting was a bit on the thin side. So I had to put it in the fridge for a bit to frost my cupcake better.
It  tasted okay.

there was way to much sugar in this recipe and I mixed the icing very well and i could still taste sugar grains in the icing. Not the best icing.

I had never made frosting before and wanted to make home made frosting for my daughter's birthday party.  I found that you don't really need to sift the confectionery sugar.  I made a batch with milk as directed above and then made another batch with half and half.  The consensus around our house was both were good but we preferred the half and half version.  It was a little smoother and not so sweet.  I also only used 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  With those little tweaks, I thought it was perfect.  I have been eating left over cupcakes just so I can eat up all the frosting all week.

It was Amazing on Cupcakes. I put it in the microwave to soften it and I used extra butter. Yum!

It was really good and really sweet even though I only used 2 cups of sugar. It was really nice and creamy, but I forgot the vanilla, I think it was good without it too, though.

It got a bit runny and i couldn't just throw it in the bin, so I added more flour, and put it in the fridge, then it got better, I decorated them on cookies, the best, I'm definitely using this recipe again!

Excellent! Added additional sugar to make stiffer for a frosting gun. Need to let it sit up a bit before you use. I put on cooled cupcakes, but the frosting ran on the first ones. By the time I did the last one though, it was setting nicely.

WAY too sweet, as many of the reviewers said. Delicious frosting and great consistency when you first taste it, but once on cupcakes we couldn't handle how sweet it was.

Way to sweet, no butter flavor at all more like you can only taste the powdered sugar. Could not get the right texture for piping or decorating at all, way to runny. Over all I would not make this again I think I will stick to my original recipe that uses butter flavored shortening.

Amazing! Great consistency and I added about 1 teaspoon more of Vanilla extract to make it have a bit more flavor. Other than that, quite a perfect recipe.

Stood up well for decorating. Took the gel dye without changing consistency or thinning out! Taste was much better than the gross crisco kinds but still wasn't the best. It was very sweet, so could use some tweaking. I will have to play with it to get a better flavor, without changing its decorating capability.

This is probably the best frosting recipe I've tried so far. Had a delicious flavor and everyone loved it. I used less confectioners sugar than called for and it was plenty sweet enough. I think if I had added all of it, it would have been too sweet. I also didn't bother sifting it. We had it on chocolate cake.

Took the advice of many reviewers and cut the sugar. I used 2 cups then gradually added around 3/4 cup more to get the consistency I desired. Still very sweet but tasty. I used it on a date and nut chocolate cake, couldn't stop eating it!

Decided to bake some cupcakes thinking I had more powdered sugar (I didn't) and I don't use lard so in a pinch I searched and found this recipe. I scaled it down to 18 servings and the amount was perfect, I even had a little left over! This is very much your favorite aunt's buttercream home frosting, if you are expecting bourgeoisie icing this ain't it, keep searching. But if you like me don't mind using homemade once in a while it works! This would work for a kid's party or for cookie icing but I wouldn't use it on anything fancy!

This was the first frosting I ever made and I'm really happy with it! It's smooth and spreads well, and to the one who gave it 2 or 3 stars for being too sweet, obviously it's sweet, it's mostly icing sugar, but it would be perfect for kids or parties! I'm 25 and don't find it too sweet at all, it's perfect, but my pallet loves sweet things, if you aren't a sugar type of person, it might be too much for you! Maybe balance it with a less sweet cake of cupcake.

I had some eggnog in the fridge. So I decided to modify this recipe to make eggnog frosting. I just substituted 1/4 cup + 1 1/2 tsp eggnog for the milk and vanilla. Delicious! Such a great texture. I topped chocolate eggnog cupcakes with the frosting and they were a hit.

Very good recipe. I did melt the butter completely as opposed to having it at room temp. This helped to mix the sugar in completely. I wouldn't suggest this during the summer time. Since it's a bit chilly in the house these days the frosting did not stay in a liquid state.

i always have a hard time with consistency when i make frosting, but this was spot on.  I paired it with apple spice cupcakes, so i used buttermilk instead of milk because i had some to use up.  This so creamy and fluffy and yummy.  i have to admit that i used my mother's fancy stand mixer, which might have aided in the fluffy part.  I also like that this is a small recipe, because i always have tons of frosting left over, but never remember to halve it.  yummy! will make again.

Just what I was looking for in a frosting!  I used almond extract instead of vanilla to frost a pumpkin spice cake.  Nice and thick.  I didn't sift the sugar, and i'm still satisfied.  I can't stop eating the frosting out of the bowl!

Was looking for a butter frosting for Hubby's sweet tooth and this was perfect. Easy to make and just sweet enough. Even subbing cocoa for some of sugar made it chocolately good. Thank you.

Pretty good. It was very sweet, though, so I probably should've used something else to frost my super sweet cookies. Oh well. Also, instead of vanilla extract, I used peppermint.

This frosting was pretty easy to make, it used readily available ingredients and looked pretty. All in all, I found it to be WAY too sweet and other than that it didn't really have much of a flavor. I felt almost ill from the sweetness. It was borderline inedible.

The frosting is really sweet, so it is perfect for something that isn't super sweet.  Its a great, fast, easy frosting.

Fluffs up really light and nice.  I changed butter to 1/2 cup to make it less sugary and more buttery.  It turned out great!

Awesome recipie.
I was making an angel food cake and didn't know what to put on it. I substituted the vanilla extract for hot chocolate powder! *the same kind that you use to make the hot chocolate you drink (i put in about 3 heaping tablespoons of hot chocolate mix which helped the texture also)*
It was soooo easy and went well even tho it is a bit sweet the chocolate and the light angel cake balanced well!

Absolutely delicious!  My only complaints about the recipe are that one, it is not really a butter frosting, not a butter flavor at all, and two, the "48 servings" only covered about 18 cupcakes with a normal amount of frosting :(  But the taste is just too good to give it any less stars.  I've even replaced 1/2 cup powdered sugar with 1/2 cup cocoa and it turns out to be a nice light chocolate flavor, yummy!

This frosting had a good flavor.  My only complaint was it turned out more like icing than a frosting,  I will try again and just add more powdered sugar.  I did cut this recipe in 1/2, since I was only using it for writing on a cake.  So maybe thats where I went wrong.

The flavor was very good.  Only thing it was a little runny.  Had to add more powder sugar.

This frosting was alright.  I made multiple batches of this and it came out different everytime.. too thick or thin, too hard or too soft.  It was rediculously difficult to spread on a cake. It's tasy though.  i'd reccomend this for cookies rather than cake.
