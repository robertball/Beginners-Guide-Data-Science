The recipe states the cheese is optional but I feel it is necessary and more of it. I ended up adding double the amount in the end. While the taste was okay, the corn did not belong or at least not a whole can. I also found it odd to use cream of chicken with the ground beef so I used cream of celery instead. This was just okay for us and I blame it on the corn.
