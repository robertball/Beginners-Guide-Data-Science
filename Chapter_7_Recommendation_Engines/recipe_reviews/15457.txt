I love bean pie but I really didn't like this one. This recipe didn't say anything about the "skins" of the beans. It says to "mash" the navy beans. Mashing did not get rid of the skins and they made the consistency of the pie horrible. Maybe if the beans were pureed it would be ok. Also the pie wasn't sweet enough for me so I would add more sugar if I made it again.

A great treat! Sounds a little unconventional but it is delicious! I first heard of this type of pie from a friend and never could find the recipe. Now that I have it I'm sure it will replace Pumpkin Pie as my family's favorite for holidays!:-) Thanks for sharing!!!!!!

A very good tasting pie and one that is unusual. Your friends will have a good time trying to guess what it is made with.

I will not be making this pie again. It has a very mealy texture and you can taste the beans. I processed the beans in a food processor until completely pureed - actually I think pureed navy beans would make a very good sandwich spread if mixed with some seasonings.

I was skeptical at first but I gave this recipe a try. The pie is really good. Very much like a pumpkin pie but with more body. I will make this one again.

Do not add hamburger! This is a desert like sweet potato pie not a meal. I've been eating honey bean pie for 39 years. However, pur√©e your pre-soaked navy beans. I wouldn't use sugar but the ingredients list is proper.

Definitely use a food processor/blender for the filling. There's a persistent bean taste but I only find it bothersome when accompanied by mealy chunks of bean. This tastes pretty sweet to me- I might try less sugar next time.
