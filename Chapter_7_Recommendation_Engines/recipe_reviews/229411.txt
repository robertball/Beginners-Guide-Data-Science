Tried this one for Thanksgiving and boy was it a hit! My kids loved it. I did cheat and use a cookie crust already made but I had no problems with the layers.. Will be making this one often!!

I must preface my review by saying that my kids loved this, but my husband said "eh", and I decided it definitely wasn't worth the calories after one bite.  My son asked for this dessert in lieu of a birthday cake and it was very simple to make-  especially since I purchased a premade Oreo crust at the store.  I might make this again if I needed to make several options for a large group because it was so simple, but it did nothing for me.
