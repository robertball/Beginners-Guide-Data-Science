The salad was very good. I am not a fan of the flavorings/herbs. I will not be keeping this in my rotation.

excellent recipe but missed something in the instruction part. Most cooks would know how to put it together anyway but that is why I  gave it 4 stars. also cut back on pickle relish due to my own personal taste. this is a very adaptable recipe.
