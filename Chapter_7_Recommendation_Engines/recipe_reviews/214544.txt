This is so easy and very tasty, my very fussy family even liked it. I added a bit of fresh ginger the second time I made it- awesome!

Delicious!  I used fresh rosemary and added fresh thyme, along with a clove of minced garlic.  Only marinated about 1 hour and it was still wonderful!  Will definitely make again!

This recipes is delicious.  I changed it a bit, I only add a little bit more than half a cup of soy sauce since I didn't have anymore.  Besides when using soy sauce I always try not to use the exact amount since to much soy sauce is to salty.  Did use the right amount of the other ingredients.  I was able to marinate 6 chops. Instead of grilling chops I browned them on the stove top and poured in the remaining marinate.  Let them simmer until the marinate became a glaze.  They were delicious.  Tip eat them warm cause after words they get to dry.

I was worried about the soy sauce being overpowering, but it wasn't, the pork was so good, and flavorful.

This is a great recipe!! Some folks mentioned it being too salty so I used just a little less than a cup of Low-Sodium soy sauce. I also added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and half of a small onion to the marinade... the cut of pork chop I used was ribeye boneless and it was VERY tender... even hours later when it was reheated!

Quick, Easy, Delicious! I used thinner boneless center chops and grilled them inside on the cast iron gas range top grill (care of Bobby Flay). Even the sometimes picky princess (aka our 13 year old daughter) loved them.

Great recipe, but instead of using just soy sauce, try using 1/2 cup Dale steak marinade, which is mostly soy sauce with some ginger and garlic already mixed in. Add 1/2 cup water to dilute because this stuff is pretty concentrated. Add some fresh diced rosemary and garlic. Delicious!

My wife and I made this with bone in chops. We added slightly more brown sugar. It was so delicious we laughed at eachother while after dinner we picked up the bones and tried to nibble the meat off of them. Absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I made this last night for dinner and my family enjoyed it.  The pork chop was tender and juicy.  I started with just 4 tbsp. of brown sugar and I added about 1 tbsp. of minced garlic.  I tasted the marinade before adding the pork and found it plenty sweet with just the 4tbs of brown sugar.  I only marinated the pork for about and 1 in the fridge I took the meat out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter for about 20 min.  It was too cold to grill so I used my grill pan the get the grill marks and then put the meat in a 350 degree oven for about 12-15 min and it turned out great. Will make this again.

Looks like my review is in the minority here....but I followed this recipe exactly and  although the chops were moist I found the soy made the chops way to salty ( and I'm a salt lover ) and the rosemary was way to over powering for me and my families taste.

This is so yummy!  I grew up eating pork chops cooked under the broiler with lots of salt and pepper. I love them that way. But this recipe has such great flavor and gives me a chance to use the fresh rosemary from my garden. We've had it a couple of times now. Great flavor and so easy!

This was a winner! So easy and good. I added fresh ginger, and used fresh rosemary. I cut back on the soy...b/c of sodium, but it still turned out excellent!

These were tasty and I'll make again. I'll use less rosemary (personal preference); I used fresh rosemary. I used 1/2 cup of soy sauce and made up the difference in liquid with chicken broth. Like others,  added some garlic and ginger, too. I also used six thick boneless pork chops.

I LOVED this recipe.  I only had 1/4 cup of soy, but I used another 1/4 cup terriyaki and 1/4 cup water and then added a little evoo (It seems to hold moisture in w/ my chicken marinades), and still used 2 tbsp rosemary and 5 tbsp brown sugar.  We LOVED it...I am only sorry I had nibbled on crackers beforehand, b/c I couldn't eat all mine.  :(

Can't wait to put these on the grill.  The weather wasn't in my favor tonight.  Baked these and served with rice, sauted onions, and garlic.  That was the perfect match for this cooking style.  YUM!  The grill would have brought out the sweet more, but this was great in the oven as well.  The grill will get the full 5 stars for this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

The chops tasted like soy sauce. We like soy sauce so that was ok. They weren't bad but they weren't great. Next time I would follow some of the changes other reviewers made, including adding some ginger and garlic, fresh rosemary, and maybe some other liquid to dilute the soy sauce.

This tasted good but the marinade ruined my natural bristle pastry brush. I had to throw it out. I washed it so many times but the sticky marinade would not come out.

Edit: I made this again. I don't think it takes on a good flavor unless it's marinated overnight. This time I had marinated it in the morning & it wasn't as favorable as last time when I had marinated overnight. I did use a silicone pastry brush this time & had no problem with stickiness in it. That being said, I don't see a point to basting them while cooking, I don't feel it adds much to warrant standing there, repeatedly basting the pork chops.

I make up multiple batches of marinade-style recipes like this, and found this especially well suited to freezing. Even after omitting water, the amount of marinade is plenty to season 12 chops divided between 3 bags. To use marinade as glaze, I pour it into a saucepan and boil for a minute while the chops grill. 

Although fresh ginger and garlic make tempting additions, I like this without. We put Asian and teriyaki flavors in other recipes, this is special because it is different. 

Am setting up plans now to make up more batches with friends this weekend.

This recipe was delicious!! I used fresh rosemary from the garden, lemon juice, and drizzled some clover honey over the top allowing only an hour to marinate. Despite the limited time allowance due to last minute meal preparation it was the perfect combination of sweet and fresh!! Paired with rice it was best new recipe I tired in a while. I would recommend this recipe to a friend.

I am a huge fan of pork chops!  I am also a huge fan of soy marinades and rosemary, separately.  But this combination just didn't work for me or my family.  The marinade completely overpowered the pork flavor.  I guess I like my marinades to be more subtle.  Also, as I was eating it, I couldn't actually figure out if I liked the flavor or not.  I will not use a soy sauce and rosemary combination again.

I have a hard time making flavorful chops. I made the recipe as is and used boneless 1 inch chops and grilled them for 6 minutes a side. These were delicious!!!

This is a great marinade.  I used low sodium soy sauce and added some minced onion and garlic.  I will definitely make this again.

I used a bit more water than soy sauce and added about 1-1 1/2 shots of Jim Beam and it was a HUGE hit! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I've never cooked pork chops on the grill before and now I don't think I will cook them any other way. These were so tender, juicy and flavorful. My family really enjoyed them. Definately a keeper. I finally found a way to make pork chops that aren't dried out.

The whole family loved this recipe.
I saved the marinade to create a sauce by first straining the marinade and then bringing to a boil; boiled 3 minutes; skimmed off foam and then thickened with cornstarch. Very good!

We don't like to grill often, so we made the same marinade (adding a tablespoon of chopped garlic and a tablespoon of time, as one of the below reviewers recommended), scored both sides of the pork chops, and let it marinate for six hours. Then we cooked them--carefully--in the pan, and they came out AMAZING. Tender, flavorful--everything combined beautifully. 

Only one caution--we didn't find them to be too salty, but we really enjoy salty foods. Those who are less into salt or are watching their sodium might want to cut down the amount of soy sauce used.

This was great!  Initially I was concerned about the amount of soy sauce, but it did not overpower.  Added a nice salty flavor that complimented the pork well.

The flavor of these chops was really good. The only thing was that were so juicy that I couldn't really tell if they meat was finished cooking, which made me feel uneasy about eating it. I would definately use the meat thermometer!!

These were outstanding.  I didn't cook them in the oven and I didn't marinate them for hours, but I shake em around in a plastic bag in the marinade for like 20 minutes.  My friend that ate them was impressed, and when I ate the leftover the following day, it was even tastier.

Might want to add some additional brown sugar to the remaining marinade and reduce it down to have more or a sauce for basting.  If you can, use fresh rosemary and bruise it before putting in the marinade.

I love this recipe and have been using it for years. However, the calorie count is totally off. A half pound (bone-in) pork chop is about 500 calories.

Love this recipe!  It was easy to make and tasted fantastic.  Any concern I had about the soy sauce flavor overwhelming the dish vanished with the first taste.  I added minced garlic.  Will make this again.  It is what we refer to at my house as "guest ready" -- a winner!

I gave this a 4 because I revised the recipe a little bit. I would have given it a 5 otherwise.   I used a thick bone-in pork chop, made a pocket and stuffed it w/fresh rosemary, sage and basil.  I added sliced fresh ginger and fresh garlic to the marinade.  Husband says it was  "outstanding."

I had 2 chops and I actually 1/4tered the recipe.  Agave syrup instead of sugar.  1:1 ratio.  Excellent!

This was easy to make. I followed the recipe except the rosemary as I only had 1 tbsp left. It still turned out well. My picky eaters (5yo and 4 yo) loved it. I’ll make this again. Thanks!

These were delicious and very moist. I tried the receipe as-is. 
I also added some garlic powder, bits of onion flake, and liquid smoke. I would suggest to add the liquid smoke..I added a tsp, and it made this "pop".

This was DELICIOUS! I only marinated for 45 minutes as that's the time I had available and it was still lovely. I'll be making this again with the proper time for marinating.

i have made it twice the first time it did come out a bit two salty, but the second time not so much. this what i did i mixed the brown sugar, rosemary with 1 and a half teaspoons of white pepper, 1 tablespoon of  grated ginger (fresh) , 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard then in a separate bowl i mixed the soy with the water then slowly added the soy/water well blending it into the brown sugar blend. before putting the pork in the marinade i pounded the pork to make it soft the rubbed a notch warmer then warm honey into the pork. honey has a special ability that will tenderize and sweeten as well as balance the texture and seasonings . its basically like a bridge for the meat and seasonings.

It was amazing! I added 2 extra tablespoons of brown sugar, some garlic and half an onion to the bag mixture. Six minutes on each side with our BBQ. Thank you for this recipe! It's now a weekly meal for our family.

This has become one of my go-to easy weeknight recipes - only change I usually make is to add some garlic. Start them marinating in the morning and they're ready to go in next to no time that night. Such great payoff for very little work. They are, of course, best on the grill, but they've also done very well on the stove.

I followed the directions except for substituting coconut aminos for soy sauce to make it gluten-free. This was yummy and the pork chops did not dry out.  I used a meat thermometer rather than a timer. We will have it again, but it won't go into weekly rotation.

Too salty. The chops were tender but the saltiness of the soy sauce was overpowering. Will not be repeating this one.

Delicious!  I added a tbsp of worcestershire sauce and only had a half hour to marinate, turned out very well all the same.  Make sure you grease your bbq grills before hand, the sugar will make these stick otherwise.

We made this last night exactly as penned and the family gave it a 10! My two boys, 3 and 8, ate this right up! Although I can see adding a bunch of other complimentary flavors to this (i.e., ginger, garlic) I think it is nice as is--otherwise you might just end up making a mongolian sauce instead of allowing the rosemary to shine. Thanks!

My family loved it! I added some garlic, ginger and sesame oil and sprinkled lemon pepper on each chop as we put them on the grill and they came out moist and delicious.  This is definitely a recipe to be used over and over again.

I made this used all ingredients with like lil over half cup of soy sauce, added bit of Worcestershire sauce, 3 cloves of garlic, some chopped onions in marinade. Let it marinade for lil over an hour then grilled it over the stove. Had bones so it cooked bit longer. Kids even loved it n asked for more! Unbelievable! Rosemary is bit different for us but I feel like we've been missing out. Thanks!

I made this for my wedding rehearsal and everyone loved it! Took a full boneless pork loin and cut my own chops to about 3/4 to 1 inch thick. Marinaded overnight (11-12 hrs) then grilled them right before serving. My dad said the only way to make them better was to wrap them in bacon!

Excellent flavor...was skeptical about the amount of rosemary, thought it would be overwhelming, but REALLY delicious.  Marinaded chops all day.  Served with vermicelli noodles and a veggie stir fry (you could easily use the reserved marinade as sauce for the stir fry...we didn't need it grilling the chops)

Very easy and pretty tasty.  I'm not much of a cook and tend to over cook pork on the grill, however this turned out just right...I followed the recipe exactly.  Husband said it was OK.....he prefers his pork chops extra dry and crispy.  These were moist and flavorful....a keeper.

This was amazing. I added 2 cloves of garlic and some fresh ginger along with the use of fresh rosemary. Also I reduced the remainder of the marinade with a little cornstarch which really turned out great. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Turns out great as long as you add about 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger. One fat garlic clove, pressed, also enhanced it. With those changes it's super good, and the soy sauce is not at all overpowering; for those who found this too salty, I used low-sodium soy sauce and that worked just fine. I did not add any extra salt, but it was not too salty either. Just right. Marinated three hours.

This recipe was seriously delightful. We cut the recipe in half, marinated our pork all day, and they turned out really moist and tasty. We also added just under a 1/4c of vinegar to help soften the meat.

The family really liked this even though I didn't get to marinate for the full 3 hours.  I'd make it again.

I hate to be one of the very few naysayers in the bunch, but I too didn't care for this recipe. The texture of the meat was altered bc of the several-hour salt-bath (soy sauce) and the flavors didn't seem to come alive as the recipe stands. It could have benefited from fresh grated ginger, orange zest, and scallions instead of rosemary. Also the marinade was far too much volume for the meat. I think swapping balsamic for the soy might have brought out the rosemary more.

Very simple recipe - I just reduced the soy sauce by a tiny bit and even so found it a bit too salty for my taste. Otherwise tastes good. Have heaps of marinade left over - could've marinated twice the amount of pork chops with it... Next time will add more fresh herbs than just rosemary.

Excellent flavor! I put it together, froze it, then defrosted it when ready to use. As it defrosted, it marinated.

I used half cup regular soy sauce and one cup water.  I added some garlic and black pepper.  It was still a bit too salty for my taste, but was succulent and juicy.  I also used fresh rosemary.  I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

After growing up with my grandmother cooking pork chops the same old way (breaded, salt, pepper, and dry dry dry!) I figured I'd finally try preparing them myself.  I too was afraid that the marinade would be to salty, but it was perfect and kept the chops moist.  Instead of brushing the remaining marinade, I used it in a reduction sauce with half a cup of merlot, chopped onion, and thyme.  And for my sides, I grilled up some broccoli in canola oil with cracked salt & pepper, and mashed potatoes seasoned with oregano, sour cream and parmesan cheese.

I will definitely be making this again in the future. Can't wait to cook it for my parents!

Great recipe. The sauce tasted like the glaze of honey baked ham.

This was a delicious recipe!!  We added garlic to the marinade as well and let it marinate overnight.  It was a bit cold out to grill, so we baked it in the oven and it turned out great.  The three of us finished all of them.  I found the marinade made too much, so we threw it in the freezer to use for next time we make these.  Which will be pretty soon!

This was awesome !!!!! At first I was skeptical when I measured out the soy sauce because I thought it would be to salty but it was perfect . For people who want it a little sweeter they can always add a little more brown sugar. But overall it was quick simple and taste great. P. S? The small packets of pork hops they serve at HEB are great for this recipe cause they're easier portions to handle.
