We used apple sauce as a butter substitute and it was a wonderful taste addition--just took a few extra minutes to cook through.  This cake is quite tasty for those of us used to turbinado & whole wheat!  We decorated our circumfrence with berries & it made for a wonderful congratulations cake for my 3 1/2 year old who just started to READ!  :-D  Will make this regularly--thank you!  No eggs!  What a treat.
