This is a very easy and quick meal to throw together in the slow cooker. I found it a little too sweet, but my husband thought it was wonderful.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Smoked BBQ Sauce because it's what I had, but would imagine you could control the sweetness by using a different kind of BBQ sauce. I served it over rice and would make it again.

tasted too tomato-ey to me. I decided to take pineapple juice from can of pineapple in it's own juice, with about a TBS of cornstarch and a TBS of brown sugar and make a slightly thick sauce in a sauce pan and adding to it. Family loved it. I think I might try this recipe again, with slight variation to ingredients.

Needless to say this was one of the most delicious meals I've had involving chicken. Having never used a slow cooker before, the preparation was quick and painless. For those who want more bang and less meat, I would suggest adjusting this recipe to include two of each bell peppers, and decrease the amount of sauces to 3 quarters, as there was just too much chicken, and was a little too spicy for our typical Western tastes.

I tweaked the recipe a bit. Instead of using barbecue sauce I actually used sweet and sour sauce being that this is supposed to be sweet and sour chicken, made more sense. I also used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and it came out perfect! Served with rice, it was delicious

This was OK.  I didn't have chili sauce so I didn't put it in.  I would think that by using a BBQ sauce that you liked you could make it as sweet or as spicy as you want.

Just tried this tonight...after reading reviews decided to use Stubbs original bbq sauce,  and it didn't end up too sweet.  The chili sauce gave it too much heat though, and In my families' opinion took away from the other flavors. Next time I will try removing chili sauce, maybe replace with a little ketchup and  a dash of soy sauce, which may make the sauce thicker. Overall, quick, easy  reciepe,  (great with brown rice) will definitely try again.

Too much of a barbecue taste for me. I was looking for something a little more sweet & sour not tangy bbq.

My husband loved this dish (he's a fan of sweet foods)!  I was sure to buy an original recipe BBQ sauce (nothing with extra sweetness like honey varieties) and served it over plain steamed rice.  I particularly liked the color of the dish - a nice, rich, and warm.  I'll definitely make this again as it was a big hit in our house.

We made this for dinner this week and it was really, really good. Some people here raise an issue about the taste not being "sweet & sour".  I think it's because of the type of BBQ sauce being used.  If you use a regular BBQ sauce, not a flavor it'll work out ok otherwise you won't get the sweet & sour taste. I used Sweet Baby Ray's. Depending on how much spice you like with your food should drive what type of Chili sauce you buy - we used medium and it was a little bit spicy - the adults liked it, kids said too hot. I put the chicken in frozen and shredded it at the 4 hour mark - cooked on low. It was done at the point but it was too early for dinner so put the crockpot on the warm setting until we were ready to eat - per the original recipe it says to cook for 8 hours on low & that would've been way too long. I think because of cooking on low for only 4 hours the onions were still crunchy. Next time I will either saute the onions or switch to onion powder. People complained about the recipe being watery.  Mine was not.  Maybe the people with a watery recipe didn't shred their chicken?  Or put the pineapple juice from the can in?  Shredding the chicken allows the meat to absorb the awesome flavors.  Must do in my opinion.  We served it over white rice, but easily could've been done over brown rice. Super easy to put together and it was really AWESOME.  The only thing you need to watch is the cooking time and highly recommend putting the chicken in frozen.

I'm a garlic lover but the 2 tbs of minced garlic is way too overpowering for me. I didn't add the chili sauce so maybe that would've worked better with it...I don't know. Right now I'm forcing myself to eat it. Obviously, my own personal tastes because others liked it.

Easy to make. Traded the chili sauce for ketchup and soy sauce. Seasoned my chicken with chili powder. Just the right spice. Not too sweet and not too spicy.

One of the best recipes I've ever tried...was a little curious as to how barbecue and chili sauce would make a sweet and sour sauce, but it does. Instead of canned pineapple, I cut up an actual pineapple. I used Sweet Baby Rays hickory barbecue sauce...can't believe how easy it turned out, and how good it was

It's really more of a teriyaki chicken. My family ate it but when asked if the recipe was a keeper, they said to scratch it. We'll try another Sweet & Sour or Orange Chicken recipe next time. Not so good.

This was good. Not great. just a tad too spicy for me. Most people would say it wasn't spicy at all, but for me it was. I will make it again, got to leave out the chili sauce I think. I don't know, any suggestions to make it less "spicy"?

Loved this dish! Took some hints from other reviews and lessened the amount of liquid I used. I only used about 1/2 cup of chili sauce along with the bottle of BBQ sauce. I chose a BBQ sauce without reference to sweetness. Only used one kind of pepper as that’s what I had on hand. I did use more than a pound of breasts as my package weighed more. I shredded the chicken before serving and put it over rice. I’ll be adding this to my regular menu.

Very yummy! I used chicken breast cut into cubes instead of tenders, bite sized I thought would be better & cook time was only 3hours on high! Also used almost 2lbs of chicken and there is still more than enough sauce! Also added the juice from the pineapple, more flavor! A tad spicy but the fam loved it!

I made a few changes to the recipe and it turned out great! First, I did not include the pineapples as we don't care for the sweetness. I also used a hot BBQ sauce (Stubbs) to give it some kick but realize that may be too much for some people. Lastly, I used a lot more chicken (2 lbs.) than called for and shred it.

I thought this was delicious! The chicken was so tender and juicy. I didn't have chili sauce, so I put salsa in a blender and couldn't tell the difference. I have a lot of leftover juice that I'm not sure what to do with. But besides that, it's a great recipe!

It was ok. I followed the directions exactly, but it just had too much pineapple flavor for me. Most of my family liked it, so it was just my taste buds that disagreed. If you like sweet recipes, than this is the one for you, however it was not for me. It just depends on what you like.

If you want to make it a more sweet and sour chicken, omit the barbeque sauce. It is very easy to make your own. You start with Ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, low sodium soy sauce and a touch of white vinegar. I do not have exacts, as I watched my grandma make this over the years, and never got measurements. I would say start with 1c of ketchup, 1/4th cup of mustard, 1/4th cup of packed brown sugar, 1-2T of soy sauce and 1T of white vinegar. Adjust it to taste.If you want to make your sauce a little thicker, add a cornstarch slurry. Another thing to add is a small amount of the juice from the can of pineapple. If you do not want the chicken "run off" in your delicious meal, sear the chicken.

My husband made this today and I LOVED it. He used MC Masterpiece BBQ sauce( after reading some of the reviews.) He shredded the chicken after 4-5 hours in crock pot at low setting. and added a second 8 oz can crushed pineapples. Tends to be watery, so he mixed 1 Tbls of brown sugar and 1 Tbls of corn starch with some pineapple juice from can and added to thicken. YUM YUM. Served on brown rice. I give it a 5 star.

It was so easy and the chicken and vegetables were so soft and tender. I used the whole can of pineapple but I think next time I will add more chicken. It’s an easy and very tasty meal.

I made this dish with a minor change. Substituted the BBQ sauce and Chili sauce for Sweet and Sour sauce "Panda" brand. 
The final result was a bit soupy for our likey so I left the left off crockpot for a couple of hours and things started to thicken up. 
Family like and we would have again.

This was a great recipe. I used homemade chili sauce (tomato sauce, brown sugar, and vinegar). Also used Snubbs which was great since it made this dish spicy. Also fresh pineapple. Yum!

The taste was a little overwhelming, not really sweet at all! Sweet and sour chicken is actually sweet and sour, definitely going to try again with a few tweaks, thanks for sharing :)

I followed the directions and I have to say it was disgusting!  Way too sweet- the chicken no longer tasted like chicken but so over done it tasted like pork.  I had it cook for 8-10 on low which def didn't help but what a waste.  I have to throw it all away!

This sweet and sour chicken was really good BUT I did make a few changes. I used chicken tenders and used the Kraft tangy barbeque sauce so I got more of a sweet and sour taste and it wasn't overly sweet!  Plus I put over  stir fry noodles(Thai kitchen)

I like another reviewer thought it had a strong tomato flavor... still very good though.  I used Stubs Original BBQ sauce because it was one of the few that didn't contain High Fructose Corn Syrup and Heinz Chili sauce (tomato based).  The sweet and sour sauce consistency was thin so I thickened with a cold water slurry of potato starch.  Next time I will cut back on the Chili sauce and only use 2/3 of what is called for.  I would also increase the amount of peppers and maybe use a 1/4 to 1/2 pound more chicken.

I used a mixture of baby bell peppers and extra onion, and overall this meal was easy, quick, and good. However, the sauce was a bit too sweet, but I think that has to do with just finding the right sweet chili sauce for my tastes (I used the Panda Express brand). Great base recipe for variations!

I needed to serve a large group (12 people), so I tripled the chicken, but doubled everything else...or else it wouldn't have fit into my large crock pot!  But whoa...this was SPICY!My friends were all downing drinks to cool their mouths.  I opted for the "low setting for 8 hours" to accommodate my work schedule & the chicken was a little dry.  The flavors were fine if you could get past the heat.  I will not make again.

Really easy to make and my family enjoyed it.  First time making it and my they all thought I made it before. Maybe next time I'll marinate it for a few hours so the chicken will get more flavor when it's in the slow cooker. Thanks for sharing.

In the beginning I added 1 sliced carrot and omitted the chili sauce. It looked like it might get dried out by the end of the day so I added 1/2 c water & I was glad I did. (8 hrs on low made the veggies a bit mushy tho.) When it was done I thought it needed more chunks so I lightly cooked a zucchini, diced, and added it to the mix and it is wonderful! I also added a few more pineapple chunks.

The recipe calls for WAY TOOO MUCH CHILI SAUCE. The meal was too hot for my family to eat. I had a bowl with rice and the chili sauce overpowered everything. Won't be making this again.

It was to much sauce for me and my family. I did have to modify it, the next time I will use the leftover pineapple juice and cut the rest of the liquids in half. I am also going to try adding my chicken from frozen instead because this time my chicken was overcooked. other then that...this is a great easy, easy dish to make during the week.
