I was in search of the pink lemonade pie I had growing up and this came pretty close. I made a shortbread gluten free cookie crust using the butter cookie crust recipe here on AR. I made it as a 9x13 instead of "pie". I also used a full tub of "cool whip" instead of half.  I placed it in the freezer to firm up. I pulled it out of my deep freezer about 30 minutes prior to serving. I skipped the coconut because i'm allergic.

After four hours in the fridge it was still soupy.  A couple hours in the freezer did the trick and it set up nicely!  Great flavor for a summer pie - easy too!

Delicious pie, light and creamy, consistency of 'soft peaks.' Followed recipe except I let lemonade concentrate thaw to room temp, then measured 3/4 cup. Refrigerated overnight on bottom shelf. Company loved it, too. A new summer staple.

I made this recipe on 10/15/14 for a " THINK PINK " event. Instead of using a regular pie crust, a graham cracker crust was used.I did use the optional food coloring. And after chilling  for four hours it still wasn't firm enough,so a couple of hours in the freezer did the trick. I liked where the taste was a very good combination of sweet and tart. " Keep Smiling :) "

This recipe is so simple and easy.  It's a great recipe to use when you have a last minute dessert to make.  I didn't have lemonade so I used a Caribbean Cherry juice which was also good.  I'm excited to try it with lemonade another time.

I made the pie exactly as the recipe stated.  I did put it in the freezer for two hours before serving.  It was perfect!  Very rich; serve small slices.  But it was absolutely fabulous.

Super easy, just make sure you have enuf time to freeze it fully. I had extra filling I had to use on its own.

This is a refreshing summertime dessert.  It tastes just like Lemon Icebox Pie just without the merengue.  If you don't like lemon desserts, this is not for you.
