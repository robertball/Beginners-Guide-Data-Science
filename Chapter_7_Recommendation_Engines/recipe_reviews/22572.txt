As with the other's who reviewed this cake I made some alterations following their lead. I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup; used a 15 oz can of pumpkin and added 1/2 tsp. of Nutmeg. I baked mine in a bundt cake pan for approx 45 minutes. I then made a glaze using 1 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 stick butter, 2 cups powdered sugar and milk; spooned it over the top and let it slide down the sides. I made it for Boss's Day and everyone is going crazy over it and how moist it is. I will be making this again and again! Thanks!!

I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and used a whole can of pumpkin like others suggested.  I also used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp cloves, for great results!  I baked it in a bundt pan and it probably baked for 45 minutes, then I made a glaze of powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk.  My co-workers raved about it, and my students devoured the rest!

This cake was superb. It was moist, tender, light, rose high in the pan, and kept well. No frosting is needed.  However, for more spicyness, I added 1 extra tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. ground ginger, and 1/2 tsp. ground cloves (pumpkin pie spices). A great all-around spice cake. Thanks!

My husband has asked for this cake over and over again since I made it.  He LOVES it.  This is a 5 star with the following tweaks....I used a whole can of pumpkin, reduced the sugar to barely 1/2 cup and added 1 tsp pumpkin pie seasoning, 1 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp cloves.  It turned out just right.  I used a bundt pan and baked 45 minutes.  I topped it with a cream cheese frosting.  I will continue to make this every year.

Wow, I think this cake is going to replace my pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving this year! Followed some suggestions and reduced sugar to 1/2 c. (plenty sweet), used the whole 15 oz. can pumpkin, and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves. Baked 45 min. in a bundt pan at 350. Iced it like the glaze on a krispy kreme donut (whisked together 1/2 c. confectioner's sugar, 4 TB milk, 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 TB melted butter and drizzled over the top.) The texture, the taste, the smell -- all the warmth of Autumn in a delicious dessert.

Very easy and delicious.I added a little nutmeg ,a 15 oz can of pumpkin instead of 1 cup and 5 more min. to cooking time. Try cream cheese icing or french vanilla cool whip, both are wonderful. I will add this cake to my dessert menu for Thanksgiving.

This was an AWESOME cake!!  It was a huge success, my husband even said it might be the best cake he ever had!  A friend said that she always thinks of pumpkin desserts as heavy, but this isn't.  I used egg whites instead of whole eggs.  A serving suggestion:  I swirled a non-fat caramel syrup  on the plate, placed a slice of cake on top, dusted with powdered sugar and added a dollop of fat free frozen whipped topping for good measure.  MMMMM!!!

I don't care much for pumpkin, but this recipe is out of this world - just add a homemade cream cheese frosting.

This has to be the easiest cake i've ever made, and as a male in the house, I have just been elevated to the 'chef' image with this recipe. I made three small changes,I used a lemon cake mix, I exchanged the amount of pumpkin for a 15 oz can, and the spice I changed to pumpkin pie spice. It was also a real hit at my church sunday morning, with a nice lemon icing drizzled across the top of my bundt pan cake!! Excellent, what else can I say!!

This was really good. I followed a previous suggestion, and only used egg whites and used only 1/2 a cup of sugar. I used a spice cake mix and added extra cinnamon. It turned out great. I will definately make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Used a white cake mix, substituted brown sugar for white, used a heaping teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  Delicious! Moist, tasty, easy to make.  Wife made a cream cheese frosting for it.  Outstanding.

OMG!!! This is a wonderful cake! I did change a couple of things. I used brown sugar instead of white, eggnog instead of water, 15 oz. of canned pumpkin pie mix instead of plain pumpkin, and additional cinnamon, and some nutmeg. I made a glaze with conf. sugar, and eggnog. Everyone loved it

Improve your glaze for a pumpkin cake by adding 20 drops of yellow food coloring and 5 drops of red food coloring. It makes the prettiest pumpkin orange color!!

This is incredibly easy and one of the best cakes I've ever tasted! I am a big pumpkin fan and this satisfied me. I made the following changes: used a 9x13, 2tsp cinnamon, a whole can of pumpkin, reduced to sugar to 2/3cup, 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg and allspice and replaced oil with applesauce. EXTREMELY moist and tasty! Doesn't need icing but I cheated and used a tub of cream cheese frosting. Will absolutely make again....this has soared to my favorite recipes list!

this cake was amazing!! I added  1/2 tsp clove and 1 tsp nutmeg. I also used one less egg as my cake mix called for 3 and the 14oz can of pumpkin makes things a little wet. I made a cream cheese glaze using 4tbsp butter, 1/2c. cream cheese, 1c. powdered sugar and 4tbsp milk, blended together and drizzled over top. I took it to a dinner party and nothing came home with us!!! so good, thanks for sharing. Will make this again!!

This was like a cake version of pumpkin pie and I loved it!  As someone else suggested, I used 15 oz. can of pumpkin instead of 1 cup.  I added: 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. cloves and I baked in a bundt pan for 45 minutes.  I would suggest making it a day ahead cause it's much tastier after it sits a while and although I tried a caramel glaze that I failed, this morning I'm having it with Cool Whip and that is all you need on this cake along with a cup of coffee.  I'm making it again for Thanksgiving, putting it in my recipe gift books and THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

very moist. I emptied one single serving size of applesauce into a 1/2 c measure cup and filled it the rest of the way with oil--still plenty moist. my husband said this was the best homemade cake he ever had and he usually only likes chocolate.

Like others I used a spice cake mix. I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup, doubled the pumpkin and added the cinn.  I baked it in my bunt pan and it came out perfect!  I made a cream cheese frosting, colored it orange and drizzled it over the top. To finish I filled the hole in the middle with pumpkin shaped candy.  It looked wonderful and very festive!

Awesome!!  Easiest cake ever and perfect flavor!  Will make this again and again and again.  We tried it warm with butter and also added a powdered sugar icing/glaze and both was was excellent.  My whole family was in love with this and that is a rarity!  Thank you for the great recipe!

I made this late one night when I needed something extra for our kids fall festival.  I got so many request for the recipe I lost count. I made the changes per other reviewers, reduced sugar to 1/2 c, used entire can of pumpkin and added pumpkin pie spice and dash of clove.   Two days later made again and took to work, 24 cup cakes gone in 10 minutes, entire breakroom was quiet because everyone was busy eating them up. Again everyone asked for recipe, I had two people to tell me that they would pay me to make them some.   This is super moist.   - I also used cream cheese frosting from this site -- super fast and easy to make.  I like how you can add less or more powered sugar for your taste and desired texture.

So good.  I used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice - only alteration.  Topped with cream cheese frosting.  Everyone raved.  I also raved, and I'm totally a "is it worth the calories?" girl.  This is WAY worth the calories.

SO MOIST and delicious.  By far the best pumpkin cake I've had or made.  Very flavorful, although I did add perhaps 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (which I would recommend). There is no need to frost it, but if you do, cream cheese frosting would compliment it.  I made this for my office, and it was gobbled up in a snap.  Great for potlucks - will definitely make many more times.

Delicious! The only things I changed were that I used Spice Cake mix instead of yellow cake. I didn't have to add the extra cinnamon and I added only about 1/2 cup of sugar. I used a whole can of pumpkin. It was very moist and delicious.

This turned out excellent!  I borrowed ideas from other reviewers and added a 2nd tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I then topped it with a drizzle made of 1 TBS of butter, 1 1/2 C confectioners sugar and 2 1/2 TBS milk.  (mix in bowl, heat in microwave for about 15-20 seconds)  Turned out great and was a big hit!!

I'VE MADE THIS CAKE SEVERAL TIMES TO TAKE TO WORK AND IT'S A "HIT" EVERY TIME.  THE HARLEY GUYS I WORK WITH DEVOUR THIS WITHIN A FEW HOURS.  THEY LOVE IT!  THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENTLY WAS, I USED 3 TEASPOONS OF PUMPKIN PIE SPICE INSTEAD OF CINNAMON.  THIS IS A GREAT TASTING AND VERY MOIST CAKE!

I just made this and it is deliciously moist...in fact needs no icing.  I used 1/2 c. sugar and a whole can of pumpkin, 2 tsp cinnamon because I love cinnamon. I am going to make this for Thanksgiving as I am always in charge of desserts and along with the traditional pumpkin pie will also be a pumpkin cake..yum! thanks!!!

I made this cake and brought it to work today.  It was a hit.  Everyone was raving about how good it was.  Thank you! Oh, I used 2 tsp of the pumpkin pie spice as one poster suggested.

Delicious!! So moist and yummy. As other reviewers have suggested, I substituted unsweetened applesauce for all of the oil, and added more spices (1/2 tsp ground cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp allspice). I topped the cake with a basic vanilla frosting with cinnamon whipped in. Would be delicious with fresh whipped cream with cinnamon, too! I will definitely make this again.

When we made this cake we didn't have yellow cake mix on hand, so we substituted spice cake mix and did the rest according to instructions -- no need to add the traditional pumpkin pie spices as we'd planned. We then iced it with canned cream cheese frosting. It was delicious, moist, and tasted like a "scratch" cake with very little effort. We'll definitely use this one again!

This is awesome.  I used Smucker's Baking Alternative instead of oil, and Egg Beaters in place of eggs (to be cholesterol-friendly), and it was still unbelievably moist.  I also had no cinnamon, so I used pumpkin pie spice.  Note: Add some chocolate chips if you want some kick. Fantastic!

This has become my go-to cake for get togethers with friends. It always is finished to the last crumb with lots of compliments. I reduced the sugar slightly, increased the pumpkin, and added pumpkin pie spices as other reviews suggested, but feel that's just a matter of taste. I don't recommend using cooking spray on the bundt pan as I had trouble with the cake sticking. I went back to greasing and flouring the pan and it slipped out perfectly. I highly recommend this cake!

Awesome recipe...Not sure why people get annoyed when reviewers change the recipe than rate it ~ this is one of the things I LOVE about this site!! I did the same as others and used the entire 150z can of pumpkin and added 3tsp of apple pie spice, used apple sauce rather than oil and no water. Also reduced the sugar to maybe 1/3 cup. Cinnamon Cream cheese ribbons up and down the sides and it was to die for!

Tried it and will make it again. I first made it  with out icing and  was told it needed some so I made a powered sugar glaze. Im bringing one to a graduation party this weekend and I think I will color the glaze orange. I will make a very nice looking and tasty cake. My son who does not eat pumpkin got curious and tried it ! He loved it also.

My kids love pumpkin bread but this is so much more moist!  The ends seem to get tough when I make bread.  I make it for an easy breakfast.  We warm it up an put a little butter on it.  Make the house smell yummy.  

I alter it some:  1/4 c oil, 1/4 c applesauce, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp of cloves, allspice and nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  The rest the same.

This recipe was easy.  I used only 1/2 cup of sugar which was still plenty sweet.  The texture of the cake is strange, even my husband agreed.  I used 4 teaspons of pumpkin pie spice.  I also made a cream cheese/conf. sugar glaze.

As others suggested we used the full can of pumpkin, reduced the sugar to 1/2 c, added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and of ground cloves, added 10 min to bake time (used a bundt pan). and This was a huge hit at our house. We will make this again.

I rated this recipe 3 stars when made as is.  Having read the other reviews though, I decided to tweak it a little.  I used spice cake mix, 1/2 c. sugar, omitted the cinnamon, and used a whole can of pumpkin. This modified recipe I would definitely rate 5 stars. I made it for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews from my guests.  Easy and delicious!  I made a cream cheese glaze for it, but I think that was too much. Next time I'll go with a simple dollop of cool whip. I will definitely make this again, often!

I made this cake once and also thought like the others that it wasn't very flavorful, but my sister in law makes it and she uses pumpkin pie filling instead of just pumpkin and hers turns out great.

I know I should only rate this as made to the exact recipe, however it was pretty good with the adjustments I made. I am a huge pumpkin person! I added the whole can of pumpkin, reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and put not quite a whole tablespoon of cinnamon and pumpkin spice in it, I used a cupcake pan and made about 20. I cooked them for 20 mins @ 350 and they were nice, warm and very moist. I used the cupcake liners and it was the only mistake. Next time I will just spray with Pam, as the bottom stuck to the paper.It may have been that they were just still to warm. I had to eat one while putting them in my carrying case. I didn't have powdered sugar but next time I will be prepared so that I can ice them! YUM!

I baked this yesterday afternoon. We had company for supper and everyone bragged about how moist and delicious it was. I wanted to bake something using what I already had in my pantry. I was really pleased with the taste. I used applesauce instead o f oil and I only had 3 eggs.I  used a 15 oz can of pure pumpkin. I mixed and baked in a bundt pan. Delicious/ will bake this again. Will be great in the fall!

This was an easy, tasty recipe. I followed some of the other reviewers and used 2/3 cup sugar, 1 15-oz can of pumpkin, 1/4 cup milk instead of water, and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I live at high altitude, so I added a scant 1/4 cup flour and baked the cake in a heavy-gauge Bundt pan at 350 degrees for about 30-35  minutes. A dusting of confectioners' sugar is all you need, but the cream cheese glaze or a caramel glaze would go well too!

I absolutely LOVE this cake.  It's one of the best cakes i've ever tried.  The only problem I had was when baking in a bundt pan, it sticks.  I thought it stuck the first time because I only sprayed it with cooking spray.  So the second time I greased and floured the pan, thoroughly, but it still stuck on the sides and the center.  It's still edible, just not as pretty.  I was going to take it to my fam's christmas dinner, but I am going to make another one and use a 13x9 cake pan instead.  I will keep the messed up one for my house. (yay!) I also decreased sugar to 2/3 cup and used 15 oz of pumpkin.

Made this cake for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I followed some of the other suggestions and used two cups of fresh pumpkin, 1/2 a cup of sugar and included some nutmeg and cloves. I iced it with some vanilla icing and voila! One of the best cakes I have ever made and will be sure to make again.

Awesome recipe and so easy too! I made 24 cupcakes instead of a 9x13 pan and only baked it for 20 minutes instead. I also decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and substituted the cinnamon with pumpkin pie spice. It came out perfectly.

OK, following other people's suggestions I did this:  Decrease sugar to 1/2 cup, increase water to 1/2 cup and use one whole can pumpkin.  For spices, I blended 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp. cloves and mixed with dry ingredients.  Then add wet ingredients.  Bake at 350 degrees for 45 min.  Came out so delicious and moist - even more so next day!  You MUST use Cream Cheese Frosting II.

Good , moist cake.  I'm not sucha  fan of pumpkin pie and my boyfriend hates sweet potatoes and is allergic to pecans, so I made this for Thanksgiving.  I added a lot more spices--ginger, more cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.  I baked it in two round pans and frosted with cream cheese frosting.  It's good, but not spectacular enough for a Thanksgiving meal.  Ill make it again, but not for Thanksgiving.

I made this in an emergency and it was a hit at the office pre-Thanksgiving potluck.  The only thing I did different was add about 1/3 cup Captain Morgan Rum to the batter.  I sifted powdered sugar on the top just before serving.  The LOVED it.

This cake was very easy and very delicious! I used a whole can of pumpkin and i substituted egg beaters for real eggs and i couldn't even tell a difference. My only complaint is that I wish i put more cinnamon in it because I couldn't really taste it. But overall it was awesome.

Ah. Maze. Ing. So moist, and the pumpkin flavor is just the right amount. I made a simple chocolate glaze to go over top since I love pumpkin and chocolate together, but would be wonderful by itself or with a cream cheese icing.

Wow, this is a snap to put together, and so MOIST! I used 1 can of pumpkin (15 oz) and was surprised that it wasn't more pumpkin flavored (was a subtle pumpkin flavor) - added nutmeg, cut back on the sugar some (the cake mix is sugar'y enough) and made in a bundt - served with whipped topping. We all loved it - sent Mom home with leftovers (and she's a chocoholic, so that says a lot!)

Our favorite cake EVER!  I follow the recipe exactly and always use the Pillsbury yellow cake mix that contains pudding in the mix.  This time I made the cream cheese frosting from this site and adored the end result.  So soft and moist!  Pumpkin haters can't even tell it contains pumpkin!

Very easy and very delicious cake. I also used the entire 15oz can of pumpkin and only 1/2 cup of sugar. Even so I found it was a little sweet and next time I will try even less. I used 2 egg whites and 2 whole eggs,eye-balled the cinnamon and added nutmeg as well. The cakes were very light and not too pumpkin-y. I will be making this again!

I made this exactly as it said and iced it with butter cream icing. My husband and I loved it so much we almost fought over the last piece. A very nice way to eat pumpkin other than in a pie.

Reduced the sugar as suggested, used whole can of pumpkin, used spice cake mix and reduced cinnamon so I could add some pumpkin spice.  It looked beautiful and tasted delicious...better than any other pumpkin cake I've had.  Definate keeper!

While this cake was easy and moist and I had no problems with it. I am giving it a three because it just did not have that much pumpkin flavor. So if you like your pumpkin real subtle, this is the cake for you. Oh, and I also reduced the sugar, like the other post have mentioned.

I've made this several times with a little change, I bake it in a bunt cake pan,  mix softened cream cheese, eggs, sugar, vanilla and add it to center before baking.  Makes it almost like a pumpkin roll.

Pretty easy cake and had good results. I left out the water and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I wish I would have reduced the sugar, because this was too sweet for me and I generally like things sweet. I mixed all the ingredients EXCEPT the cake mix until smooth, I added the cake mix last, mixing just until the dry ingredients are incorporated. Over mixing will definitely produce a heavy/dense cake.The addition of a little cloves and ginger would really make this cake shine. Or just use pumpkin pie spice instead. I will make this again, but with less sugar.

Cake was delicious! I added a bit of unsweetened applesauce and pumpkin pie spice for extra flavor. Baked in bundt for about 60 minutes (55 minutes wasn't enough for my oven). I also made a cream cheese frosting (1/4 C butter, 1 8oz pkg cream cheese, 1lb sifted powdered sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, and milk to thin) and drizzled over the top, then sprinkled with pumpkin pie spice. Delish! Everyone loved it and kept going back for more.

This recipe was SUCH a hit with my daughters grade 3 class, that I wanted to make another batch for home...  I just happened to have a boxed "Butter Pecan" cake mix in my cupboard, so I substituted it for the yellow cake... SO delicious!!!! I did them as cup cakes, frosted them with whipped cream cheese icing and sprinkled a tiny bit of cinnamon sugar for garnish.  They're amazing!

Loved this cake!  I did use the entire can of pumpkin was my only alteration. I baked as a layer cake and iced with a cream cheese icing that my daughter tinted orange.  Sooooo moist and mildly pumpkin flavored. The whole family loved it. Even my skeptical husband and my pumpkin hating daughter.

I added a whole (29 oz) can of pumpkin as other reviewers suggested, but it was VERY dense, but tasted great with a glass of milk.  It needs more than 1 cup, but not quite as much as a whole can.

My kids asked for a cheetah cake, but I didn't have any red, yellow, or orange food coloring.  I found this recipe and added chocolate chips -  success!  I love how easy it is to impress little kids. :)

Fantastic recipe - and SO easy!  It is even better with the addition of traditional pumpkin pie spices.  I use 2 tsp cinnamon blend (Pampered Chef), to add a bit more flavor.  Rave reviews, especially when paired with whipped cream/cream cheese frosting.

I made this for work and everyone just loved it.   I did use a 15 oz can of pumpkin which made it extremely moist.  By making a cream cheese frosting, the entire cake seems like it is made from scratch.

This cake was so SIMPLE to make, and SO DELICIOUS!! It gets even better after sitting in the fridge for a few days--tastes more and more like pumpkin pie! I used Cream Cheese Frosting II, and serve it with either whipped cream, ice cream or both!  YUMMY!

I made this cake for Thanksgiving this year. My husband went nuts over it. I followed what some others had suggested and used the entire can of pumpkin. I added two extra tbls of flour to the mix to. I also added powdered nutmeg and ginger to it. I will be making this one again.

WOW!  So easy and good.  Did the 1/2 cup sugar and whole can of pumpkin as other reviewers suggested, baked it in a 9x13 pan 5 minutes longer and topped with homemade cream cheese icing. SO moist without being heavy.  A bit more bland than I would like, so will try the spice cake mix next time.  This recipe is a keeper!

My daughter & I made this the other day on the spur of the moment.  We only had 1/2 box of yellow cake mix. I used 1/4 cup of Pumpkin Butter from Wm Sonoma. Used the whole can of pumpkin & also used a smaller amount of brown sugar. Baked 45 mins in Bundt pan.
No frosting.

Her husband LOVED this. I had it for breakfast & put it in the microwave for 15 sec & slathered it with butter.  YUMMMM

I used this recipe to make a bundt cake.  As other reviews have recommended, I used the spice cake recipe and 2/3 cup sugar.  I topped it with a maple glaze recipe.  This was a delicious combination!

Delicious!!  I added the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin and used the recipe for cupcakes.  Baked them at 350 degrees for 23 minutes and they were perfect.  Topped them with canned cream cheese frosting and they were a hit!  Highly recommend this easy recipe!

I made this for one of my roommate's birthdays and it was gone in a day. Another roommate requested the same cake for her birthday a week later! Soooo good. I did use spice cake mix, which seemed to work just great. Frosted it with the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site. To die for.

I was impressed with this cake, but watch the baking time! I too used 15 ounce can of pumpkin and increased cinnamon, added nutmeg. It states to bake for 45 minutes, but my cake was done at @37 minutes. Since ovens are different, I would suggest checking the cake at 35 minutes, and add more time as needed. You do want the cake to be moist.

I followed suit and "tailored" this recipe by adding 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp ground cloves and one more tsp of cinnamon.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, too.  I will try it again with a sugar substitute and sugar combination.  This got rave reviews at the office potluck and at home!

I made this cake tonight as a "practice" for tomorrow night's Thanksgiving dessert, since I wasn't sure I'd like it. On the advice of other reviewers, I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup and I used a whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin. I'm not sure this will last until tomorrow night! It is so moist and delicious it may get gobbled up tonight (pardon the pun)! But so what? It's very easy to make, and I can just whip up another one. Try this with a nice powdered sugar glaze. Simply dee-lish!

I made cupcakes and they were done in 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  I used the whole can of pumpkin and 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also added 2 teaspons of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of ground clove.  Topped with Cream Cheese icing II and my husband loved it!  He doesn't usually eat desserts, but he had 3 cupcakes!

This recipe should get 5 stars just for being quick and easy, but the cake is incredibly moist and delicious too!  It literally took me about 10 minutes to mix it and get it in the oven.  I used only a scant 1/2 cup of sugar, a whole 15 oz can of pumpkin, a little less than the 1/2 cup of oil (it doesn't need it, it's so moist), and 1/2 tsp each pumpkin pie spice & cinnamon.  Baked it in a bundt pan for 50 minutes; topped it with Vanilla Glaze from this website (but it would be amazing with cream cheese frosting!). Took it to work and got rave reviews.

Surprisingly my kids loved this. I didn't even put icing on them - I made them as cupcakes. 

I did add more spice, and subbed the veg. oil for applesauce.

Really good cake mix cake.  I used the whole 15oz can of pumpkin b/c I didn't want to waste any of it.  Only used 1/2 c sugar and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinammon.  Next time I would use closer to a tablespoon of spice instead of a teaspoon (personal preference).  Quick and easy and flavorful cake.  Thanks!

Made the recipe using spice cake mix. The cake is very moist. I do not recommend adding sugar and cinnamon. The cinnamon overpowers the taste of pumpkin and the sugar makes it very very sweet for my taste. Next time I make this I will omit the sugar and cinnamon. Overall very moist.

This cake was very easy to make and tasted just perfect. It was very rich in a lot of flavor, so rich in fact my family and I could only have a small piece of the cake. Although I did modify it by using the suggestions that others made for my final product like 1/2 cup sugar, spice cake mix, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, 1 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon. and whole can of pumpkin(15 oz). I will definently be using this recipe again. Thank you Michele :]

I followed other users' advice and modified the recipe a little bit. I downed my sugar to 1/2 cup and used light brown instead of white. I also used 1 3/4 cups (same as a 15 oz. can) pumpkin because I really love pumpkin. Also, to be cholesterol - free I substituted my eggs for whites only and used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil. The cake is super-moist and still light and fluffy! I will definitely be making this over and over! :D

I made this last night and really enjoyed it.  I took the advice of others by using a whole can of pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon, cutting down on the amount of sugar and using light brown sugar in place of white sugar.  I baked it at 325 for about 50 min.  I topped it off with some drizzled on glaze which it didn't even need.  Thanks for sharing.

Thank you Michele for a great pumpkin cake recipe. With the yellow cake mix added, it gives it just the right cakey flavor with the yummy pumpkin. I traded out the cinnamon for pumkin pie spice. Awesome!!!

This cake was a hit my sister made it for our garage/bake sale and added cream cheese frosting to it, they sold out quickly!
My husband loves them we like to make them into muffins and add a little cool whip or cream cheese frosting. Yummmy!

I must have missed something -I made this cake twice just to make sure I hadn't errored the first time.  Not the greatest tasting cake out there.  Very bland -and not the best texture.

I made it today and we just love it.  It was so easy to make.  Most of all, the husband and two kids love it.  I served it topped with some cream cheese frosting.  Thanks Michele for sharing.

I made this exactly like the recipe stated, and I thought it was wonderful!   I have made it twice,  I prefer the Pillsbury moist yellow cake mix, over Duncan Hines.   I sugar the pan and flip bundt cake over on a cake plate.  

On the second go around, I tossed in crushed pecans.

I've made this several times, and it's always been a huge hit. I top it with a maple cream glaze and praline pecans or walnuts. So good!!

I made this cake, but made it sugar free!!  I used sugar free cake mix. I also used some of the reviewer suggestions.  I used the whole can of pumpkin.  Reduced the sugar, I actually used 1/2 cup stevia.  I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon.  Everyone loved the cake, they didn’t even know it was sugar free. Yummy.

Very good, moist cake.  I followed the suggestions of another reviewer and used a 15 oz can of pumpkin and reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup.  I also spiced it up a little by adding 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a little allspice.  I baked it in a greased bundt pan but it stuck to the pan so next time I'll grease and flour the pan. I frosted it with a cream cheese/butter frosting.  It got rave reviews when I took it to the office and there was not a crumb left at the end of the day.  This cake is better and moister the day after it is baked.

I made some changes to the recipe and it turned out great. I used a 15 ounce can of pumpkin, I subbed butter for the veggie oil, put in 1/4 cup sour cream and used my homemade pumpkin pie spice mix, 1.5 tsp. The glaze I made was 4 ounces cream cheese, half a stick of butter 1&2/3 cups powdered sugar and about a tsp of vanilla. Y’all this turned out so dang good. Make it. You’ll be happy you did.

I accidentally followed the directions for the cake box so I added a Cup of water instead of the recommended 1/4 cup. I added 3 eggs instead of 4. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, cloves, and the result was amazing!

Worked well, both with regular cake mix and gluten-free.  The picture shows it with some kind of a light drizzly icing...I wish the recipe would have included it!

I used one can of pumpkin and about 1/2 cup sugar, added more cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, ginger and tasted the raw batter to see if I had enough spice.  Made a cream cheese frosting with 3 oz. cream and 3 ounces butter and added some vanilla extract and about 2 Tsp. pure maple syrup and just added confectioners sugar to make a nice consistency.  I made two layers one for home and one for work.  The home cake got 5 stars.  Tomorrow the coworkers will comment, but they will eat just about anything.

This was a very good cake, especially for the autumn season.  I took the advice of other cooks and used the whole can of pumpkin and added the additional spices (allspice, ginger and nutmeg) and used 2 tsp of cinnamon. Also cut back to 1/2 cup of sugar as suggested by others.   Best after 1 or 2 or more days in the refrigerator.

I made this cake for my son's birthday. The entire family loved it.  It is not very strong on the pumpkin, but still very good. I made my own vanilla glaze for it. Highly recommend this recipe.

I loved it and my 7 dinner guests, without exception, raved. Following the suggestions of some earlier folks I used a spice cake mix and a full can of pumpkin (15 oz). Oil , eggs and water were as listed in this original recipe, but  I did lower the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I went ahead and still added a dash each (not a teaspoon) of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves even though it was a spice cake.  YUM! I baked it in a bundt pan -45 mins, and sprinkled confectioners sugar on for decoration. No icing is necessary for this lovely, moist cake that manages to taste light while still being pumpkin rich.

A very moist cake but hardly any pumpkin taste to it.  Next time I make it  I will add less sugar (or maybe no sugar at all) and all.  I put a cream cheese frosting on it, so that makes everything better!

Even better.. substitute a box of SPICE CAKE mix for the yellow cake.  It is a bit more dense...  but more intensely flavored.

Made some changes.  Use white cake mix, 15 oz pumpkin and 1/2 cup sugar with the other spices people added.  Pretty sweet next time I would use 1/4 sugar.

I made the recipe as is, but I did add 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg - it was amazing! Very moist and tasty. I am making it again, but this time I am adding a cream cheese filling to bake in the center of  the bundt cake (8oz cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 egg).

I do a lot of baking from scratch but sometimes I use a cake mix and doctor it up.  Based on the reviews, I decided to try this recipe.  I was very disappointed with it.  Despite all of the doctoring, it still tasted like a yellow cake mix.  Like was suggested, I used a full can of pumpkin and added more spices.  I also topped it with a glaze made out of milk, powdered sugar,  cinnamon, and a bit of vanilla.  The glaze helped but not enough.   I was disappointed that I could still taste that it was from a mix but I gave it 3 stars because it still went over well.  A good cake for a crowd that isn't used to home-baked goods I guess.

Very easy & very yummy!  Good alternative to the many pies that were expected on Thanksgiving.  I made a simple maple glaze & it was perfect, not overly sweet.  Definitely would make again!

Following previous poster I made the following mods and loved it: cut to 1/2c sugar; upped pumpkin to whole 15oz can; used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp ginger, and 1/2 tsp cloves; baked in bundt pan and topped w/ cream cheese frosting/glaze. wonderful!

I followed some of the reviews: 1/2 cup sugar, a whole can of pumpkin, a little bit of nutmeg and cloves. It was DELICIOUS! I received so many compliments! Wonderfully moist, perfectly spiced, and above all: ridiculously easy. I frosted mine with a very thin layer of cream cheese frosting, and it was perfection.

I added pumpkin spice and 1/2 cup sugar  instead of the 3/4 cup  and it was still a little to sweet for me .

I made this in cupcake form and it they turned out very good!  I did use the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar and added 1 tsp nutmeg. The cupcakes had to cook about 20 minutes at 350.

I thought this had no pumpkin flavor. If I look up a recipe for pumpkin cake it is safe to assume I want it to taste like pumpkin.  I will definitely avoid a boxed cake mix recipe next time.  I used a 15 oz can as other reviewers suggested.

Yummy! One of the other reviewers had this really good glaze recipe posted and I also used it:
1 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 stick butter, 2 cups powdered sugar and milk.

This cake tastes delicious. I did tweak it a little. I cut the sugar back to half a cup  and added some Pumpkin Pie spice. I think this cake was a little too moist. It fell apart. I think the water needs to be omitted. It was over moist if that's possible. But all in all, it was a good cake.

I have made this recipe twice now and I love it! I went by what other reviewers said and used the whole can of pumpkin puree both times. Because of this, you have to cook it for longer, 50 - 55 minutes instead of 45. I put it in a bundt cake pan like so many before me. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice. The first time I used yellow cake mix and the second time I used white cake mix and I believe I prefer the white cake mix better. I also put chocolate chips the first time and pecans the second time. Mmm!! I'll keep this and continue making it!

This cake  was dry and lacking taste. I had added all the recommended changes, including more pumpkin, less sugar, more spices. The addition of applesauce in addition to the oil might have helped.

I reduced the sugar a bit more to 1/2 cups. I also used a whole can of pumpkin and adjusted the spices to 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon cloves. 45 minutes in a bundt pan. Finished off with a maple cream cheese glaze and chopped pecans. My family went bonkers over this. Made it twice in one week!

I took everyone's advice and used the whole can of pumpkin, decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, & 1/4 tsp cloves.  I also added a package of instant vanilla pudding and about a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I used a cream cheese frosting on top.  I took it to work and it was gone in less than 3 hours and had compliments galore!!! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

As recommended, I reduced the sugar, used 15 oz pumpkin & added nutmeg. Such an easy delicious cake! Only problem is that with many recipes that call for an 18.25 oz box of cake mix, it is difficult to buy that in the stores now that the cake mix manufacturers have reduced the size to 16.5 or 15.25. I just wonder if this recipe will still work with the smaller size.

I made this cake and it was delicious. I read other reviews and based on what others wrote, made the following changes. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, added 15 oz pumpkin, decreased the oil to 1/4 cup and spiced it up with 1tsp Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ginger. So, I guess I really didn't make this cake, but the basic recipe is a good easy one that is very flexible. Yummy.

I you don't like reviewers who change the recipe, don't read this! I happen to love changes and that is exactly what I am looking for when I read reviews. I forgot the water and sugar! Didn't miss it-probably because I added a bag of white chocolate chips and a bag of cinnamon chips! :) I used applesauce instead of the oil. I doubled the recipe and made 12 muffins, one round and one big sheet of bars. They're SO good!

Made the recipe as written, except I used a bundt pan (baked for 52 minutes) and glazed with a thin orange glaze.  I did add 2 Tbsp of flour when I noticed my cake mix was 15 oz instead of 18.  This cake was good, but I expected more flavor and density.  Maybe I should have made a spice cake instead.  We'll definitely enjoy this cake anyway.

Thanksgiving or Holiday party must, especially topped with buttery, pecan & spicy streusel. I used to make this in when I was in college and I'm so glad to see the recipe again. I used spice cake mix, instead of yellow, but still added the cinnamon, plus 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Very simple and delicious.

This is an excellent cake. I made it to give to 2 special people I have not seen in a long time and their families loved it! I read many of the reviews and changed mine too. I only put a 1/2 cup of sugar, and used applesauce instead of the oil. I also used a whole can of Libby's pumpkin. I also used 3 eggs instead of 4 because my box of cake mix asked for 3. I topped it with canned Cream Cheese frosting that I thinned out with milk and sprinkled the top with pecans. Everyone LOVED it!

I followed others advice and reduced sugar, added pumpkin pie spice, and used whole can of pumpkin.  I used milk instead of water and melted butter for the oil.  I made these into cupcakes and topped with salted caramel frosting, drizzled with caramel sauce, added fall colored sprinkles, and topped with a candy pumpkin.  Big hit with the work crew!!

Very moist!  I reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, used who,e can of pumpkin as suggested. I didn't have pumpkin spice so I only used cinnamon, they are a bit bland, need more spice!  I made cupcakes (yielded 30) baked for about 17 min.  Topped some with cinnamon streusel, some with caramel frosting. Yummy!

This is incredible. Moist and delicious. Just won 2nd prize at the local fair with it. I didn't bake it nearly as long as the recipe said, as my oven cooks hot. I baked it in a bundt pan because I thought it would give me a nicer looking slice for the fair. I didn't ice/glaze it at all, but my brother suggested cream cheese icing like you would use for carrot cake. We might try that next time we make it.

I used this recipe and instead of yellow cake mix I used a spice cake mix and topped it with creame cheese frosting.  The family loves it and ask for it all the time.

I definitely give this recipe 5 stars! Excellent and super easy. Perfectly moist and beautiful as a bundt cake with some powdered sugar on top. Excellent!

Loved this recipe! Used the holiday French Vanilla Cool Whip to top it with and is absolutely PERFECT. My brother is requesting for his very own, so I'll be making 2 more today one for Thanksgiving tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe and it was delicious!  I followed some recommendations used a whole 15oz can of pumpkin, 1/2 cup of sugar, pumpkin spice and used Duncan Hines moist classic yellow cake mix and cooked it one day ahead of serving and it turned out great!!

This is a very good cake; however, I would give it 5 stars if it had more pumpkin flavor.  I made it as is cutting the sugar to 1/2 c.  Next time I will do as other reviewers suggested and add a whole can of pumpkin and I may leave out the sugar altogether.  A simple cake to put together and serve as a wonderful fall treat!

I tried this recipe 3 times...all three times, it was very doughy and when I made it in the bundt pan, it fell apart when I turned it out. I omitted the water. the last time I added 1/4 c flour.  I need a pumpkin cake suitable for decorating for a wedding.

In my haste to bake this recipe, I forgot the sugar completely. I fretted, but hoped that the cake mix would be sweet enough. It turned out moist and sweet. Everyone loved it. Even my pumpkin-hating hubby liked it (I told him it was spice cake!) I added powered ginger, allspice, cloves and nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. You honestly do not need the sugar at all, especially if you are going to sprinkle the top of powdered sugar or drizzle with icing. Everyone said that any more sugar would be too too sweet.

Very good and easy cake. I did take the advice of others and added only 2/3 cup sugar and a 15 oz can of pumpkin. I also added a full bag of chocolate chips, which made it really yummy. I baked it for 55 min in a stoneware bundt pan. Everyone said it was really good...some ate seconds. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was absolutely delicious I did make a few changes though I use applesauce instead of cooking oil and I use the whole can of pumpkin instead of just 1 cup instead of making a cake I made cupcakes I cook them for 20 mins at 350 and they came out perfect.

Following others suggestions, I added a 15 oz can of pumpkin and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I wanted to make it a chocolate pumpkin cake, so I added 1 cup mini chocolate chips to the batter and topped the cake with a chocolate glaze after cooling.
 To make the glaze - Melt 2 tablespoon semi-sweet or unsweetened chocolate(I use semi-sweet), with 1 tablespoon margarine. 
Add ¾ cup powdered sugar, ½ teaspoon vanilla and 4-6 tablespoons hot water and mix until smooth

After reading a few of the reviews I too made a few changes, I also added the full can of pumpkin, extra cinnamon, nutmeg and a little ginger, I also added walnuts. I kept the sugar as stated in recipe and it was fine. I did it in a two layer pan and once cooled put cream cheese icing in the middle and on top only. My family Loved it, it was so moist and tasty. this will be one of my thanksgivng Desserts this year !!!

Pretty tasty and easy! I followed the posted recipe as far as measurements go, but I added a little extra cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, and a tiny pinch of allspice.  I frosted it with a cream cheese frosting.  It was pretty tasty and very moist. I couldn't taste much pumkin flavor though.  I might try using pumpkin pie mix instead of plain pumpkin.

Made this cake b/c I was craving a pumpkin dessert.  Four stars only because I tweaked it.  Added cinnamon, allspice & nutmeg.  Also decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and, because I had it, used 1/2 cup of coconut oil instead of the veggie oil.  Whole can of pumpkin used too!  Very moist!  I'm wondering if I can make a sweet potato cake using the same methods as this one??  Stay tuned!

I don't like pumpkin, but my husband and three kids DEVOURED this! I used the whole can of pumpkin (15oz), baked them in a muffin tin (24 muffins) and topped them with a powdered sugar/vanilla/milk glaze. A huge hit....will be making another batch tomorrow!

I made this a few times over the holiday season & got rave reviews! It's about impossible to tell there is a cake mix involved. A truly delicious dessert that is sure to please! I used a rich home made cream cheese frosting on top of the cake, which added to the great taste of this recipe!

FANTASTIC recipe! So very easy to put together. I didn't have regular pumpkin puree but had organic pumpkin pie puree and because it had all the spices in it, it added tons of flavor. Very moist and very pumpkiny taste. Awesome!

My husband  NEVER compliments anything!!!! I was looking to make something using things I had in the house (not much since it's very close to shopping day and I was out of almost everything but I did have a can of pumpkuin and a box of yellow cake mix). I made this cake and served it. I thought it was one of the best cakes I've ever had, but of course hubby just ate it and said nothing (my usual hint that it was "a keeper recipe") We ate it for several days and when we were eating the last 2 pieces, DH said, "What kind of cake is this? I've been trying to figure it out. Is it a cinammon cake? Did you buy it? What is it?" I told him that I didn't buy it - I made it. Then he said, "Whatever you did, keep doing it 'cause it's the best cake I've ever had." Believe me, I'll keep making it. Thanks for the recipe! If I could rate it more than 5 stars, I definitely would!!!!!

I followed the alterations that others had made and used the extra pumpkin in it as well. This cake is SUPER moist and loved by all. When creating the glaze you can make it thicker or thinner. I believe that creating a light glaze is the best so it will drizzle nicely over the cake. AWESOME RECIPE!!!

Very good. I used less sugar and more pumpkin, like some others suggested. Also added extra spice, but I'm not sure that was necessary. Also Regular powdered sugar icing to drizzle was a bit too sweet for this cake. Next time I'll try cream cheese icing.

The cake was very moist and turned out beautiful. I followed others' suggestions and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and used an entire 15 oz can of pumpkin. I don't really care for pumpkin, but my family enjoyed it for Thanksgiving. Not too sweet. I used a rum cream cheese glaze, which can be found as part of another pumpkin cake on this site.

This cake is an EXCELLENT cake for the holidays! It is very very moist and the flavor is incredible! As others did, I used 15oz Pumpkin, 1/2 tsp Nutmeg, 2 tsp Cinnamon. Can't wait to take it to the family dinner!

While this was super easy and quick I did feel it needed more spices and I did add more than called for but I will try again with a spice cake I did love how simple it was to throw together I frosted the cake with cream cheese icing from ar: EDIT... I made this again with the spice cake mix and wow was it good! Will make it like this from now on..5 stars!!

I have an allergy to dairy products, so I'm always on the lookout for recipes that don't include them and this one is one of my favorites by far! I love pumpkin, but can't have most pumpkin pies, etc., so this makes a great subsitute. I'd definitely recommend using the full can of pumpkin like others suggested, reducing the amount of sugar and adding more pumpkin pie type spices. I just use Duncan Hines Classic Vanilla frosting from the can (there's no dairy in it) instead of cream cheese frosting and it still tastes great! I even introduced this recipe to my best friend and it's now a reoccuring treat at her family holiday parties, too!

Wonderful, moist cake. 'loved it so much, we made it two days in a row. I altered by adding to the recipe a mashed banana, about 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and about 1 tbsp light brown sugar.  And on top, I sprinkled a bit of dark brown sugar before baking.  When served, we like to top it off also with some powdered sugar. This cake is great, thank you.

So moist and yummy!  I used 1/2 cup sugar and a whole 15oz can of pumpkin like others had suggested.  I then used the cream cheese frosting II on them.  They taste so good they don't have to have frosting but the cream cheese frosting made them to die for!  I made them as cupcakes and mini cupcakes.  The mini baked for about 15 mins and the normal size for about 20 mins.  They are great chilled in the fridge.  I'm going to have some mini muffins for a thanksgiving hor duerve (spelling)

THEY ARE DELICISIOUS

I made this for a dessert buffet and it was popular. I thought the cake mix crumbs  tasted like cake mix. I'd love to have a similar recipe that did not need a cake mix.

Tasted REALLY good, the texture was odd however. I expected it to rise up more and be more cake-like. It was so moist and so dense it almost was like pumpkin PIE cake. But it tasted soooo good. I used more cinnamon and less sugar as other suggested. I also used a store bought Buttercreamm Icing as if it wasn't rich enough. yummy:-)

This is super yummy and super easy!  I whipped it up right before dinner, had it baking during dinner in a bundt pan = fresh out of the oven!  I put a cream cheese frosting on top, I'd wait a bit until it cools more completely, most of the frosting slid right off, but it is SCRUMPTIOUS!  My husband and I ate half of the cake last night.  Give this recipe a shot!

Sorry, but I really thought this cake was lacking something.  It turned out beautiful, although mine needed to be baked closer to 55 minutes.  It just didn't have any "personality".  Maybe adding nuts or chocolate chips to the batter would liven it up.  I definitely think it needed a frosting or glaze (not called for in the recipe).  As written, it was just a little too blah.

This is a great cake. I did use the spice cake mix and only 1/2 cup of sugar,and a whole can of pumpkin, but followed everything else as suggested. I also made a cream cheese frosting for the top, and finely chopped 1/4 C. of walnuts and mixed 2 Tbl. brown sugar with a pinch of cinnamon and sprinkled it on top, what a great cake. I am the only woman where I work and all my "boys" loved this cake. I brought home an empty pan. Thanks for a really great cake. I will be making this one again. =)

I made this for my Sunday School breakfast and people loved it.  I only had 4 pieces to take home.  It's very moist and not too sweet!
