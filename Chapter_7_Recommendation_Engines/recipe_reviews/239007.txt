I was surprised by how tasty this was! I didn't have flax seeds so used chia seeds instead. Really delicious and delicately sweet and gentle tasting. Thanks!

I liked the flavor of this smoothie, especially after adding some cinnamon. However, the texture wasn't that great, and the smoothie was not very cold. I would add some ice next time. Also, I think it would help to freeze the zucchini. The serving was big.

I used vanilla protein powder and 1 cup almond milk (because I'm allergic to dairy). It was a little too sweet for my taste. When I make it again, I'll use hemp protein or regular whey protein.
