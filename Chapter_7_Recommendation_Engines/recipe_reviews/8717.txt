Just a note:) when cooking meats such as fried chicken, that has a crust and using eggs, use only the yolks. The egg whites can cause the crust to burn before the meat is completely done cooking

Excellent!! The only thing that makes it better is brining the chicken. Soak the chicken in a brine of 3/4 cups salt to 3 quarts of water for 2 hours, no more or the chicken will be salty. Brining it makes it more tender and gives a crispy skin. Try it!

Wow. I have tried to make fried chicken many times different ways. On the stove, in a deep fryer, in an electric skillet. This was the best, simplest way to prepare it. Now, don't think it's supposed to look and taste like KFC. Deep fried and pan fried produce two very different types of chicken. This had a thin, crisp coating and was nice and juicy inside. I don't have a lid for my skillet so I just used aluminum foil. I do think the seasoning is a bit bland. I served this with creamy gravy I made from the drippings. I will use this method again. Anybody can do it and it didn't even make a mess! Really.

Wonderful recipe!  A few modification: used 2 cups vegetable oil, added 1 tablespoon garlic powder and 1 tablespoon paprika.  I coated the chicken in the flour mix and then dunked it in an egg batter.  Then I recoated with flour.  My chicken came out extra crispy, moist, and juicy!  Thanks Marily.

This was just like my mom used to make.  It was good and basic.  An iron skillet is really a must.  I didn't really change anything.  In the end, I drained off most of the oil and made cream gravy with the drippings.  Great over rice.  
I also looked at the Fried Chicken Recipe by Shirley.  They are very similar and combined the instructions for both recipes.  I gave this one an extra star because of the great tips it included.

I DID IT!!!! I finally did it! I finally fried chicken and it turned out!!! I did everything this recipe said however I didn't have an iron skillet so I just used the heaviest skillet I had and it worked out great. I also added some onion and garlic powder as well.  Otherwise I followed these instructions and finally I have made chicken as good as my Grandma's! I always look for fried chicken recipes but they usually use bread crumbs and other stuff. I couldn't find one that was simple like this, just like my Grandma makes hers. So a million thank you's for this! Every single one of my three kids and my husband devoured this.  I'm 30 years old and this is the first time I've actually successfully fried chicken...I'm a real grown up now!!

I was craving Fried chicken, so when i came upon this recipe i was stunned to see how simple it looked. I loved it. I did add a little more salt and pepper, and i used oil instead of shortening. I will be making this again. AND so true about the cast iron skillet. didn't stick at all!

Couldn't be any easier to make this recipe. I used a teflon frying pan and shortening and had no sticking issues. I think the trick is to use shortening and NOT OIL. I also added a bit more salt and pepper.

Great flavor and crust.  I did marinate the chicken in buttermilk overnight and add seasoning salt, paprika and garlic powder to the flour.  Don't forget to make gravy to go with it.

I didn't have a cast-iron skillet, so I used a regular one.  I think the cast-iron is the key because my chicken stuck to the pan a little.  Other than that, the chicken was really good.  Mine came out pretty juicy and the coating was crispy.  I'm going to try this again (with the cast-iron skillet) for my next family get-together.  Thanks, Marilyn!

Thanks so much for the tip on using a heavy skillet. I always had problems with the chicken sticking before. I marinated the chicken with buttermilk and garlic for a couple hours before coating with flour and frying. Delicious and juicy!!

A cast iron pan is the secret. Either a skillet or cast iron dutch oven.  I used my cast iron dutch oven.  Less splashing.  I did brine my chicken. [1/4 cup salt per 1 quart of water for 2 hours.]   Also, put a little cayanne in the flour mix & let the chicken sit on a rack for 15 minutes after breading it.  This helps the breading stick to the chicken while frying.  Kitchen smells like  "KFC".  Will definitely make again.  I love no brainer recipes.

This is same as my basic recipe. Sometimes I just use Wesson Oil. I always use my electric fry pan, as I am always doing large batches. Would use more seasonings and add paprika and garlic powder. I also soak my chicken in buttermilk for several hours (makes it very moist). And, the main key is to have your oil SIZZLING hot BEFORE you begin. This helps to keep the batter from falling off. Sometimes I just give the chicken a good browning on both sides and then pop into a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes or so to finish it. This is always helpful for large batches, if not enough room in fry pan.

Easy process for someone who doesn't usually fry like me. Take the time to brine the chicken. It makes it EXTRA juicy. [1/4 cup salt per 1 quart of water for 2 hours.] Extra seasoning is a must. Otherwise, the breading is bland. Try Emeril's Essence in the breading and on chicken moistened with milk or water before you bread it. Try hot sauce in the brine or use Hot Paprika in the batter. I like powedered garlic in the breading too. Prepare to be impressed with yourself. This recipe is a blessing.

This recipe is simple, yet delicious.  The chicken is nice and crispy, tender delectable meat and with just the salt and pepper as a seasoning allows the natural flavor of the chicken.  I notice the cook didn't say how to handle the chicken as it cooks.  I learned Fried Chicken should be "Turned" only Once in the pan.  Once the edges of the chicken becomes golden brown, Turn the chicken allowing the other side to brown, then remove the chicken from the pan, allowing the chicken to properly drain its excess oils.  Nice Recipe!

My first real success at frying chicken. (After many failed attempts!) I do not have a cast iron skillet, but by using crisco instead of oil, did not have a sticking problem. I added some paprika and a little more salt. I also did brine the chicken for about 45 minutes before cooking. (I did not have 2 hours to do it right.) It turned out perfect. My husband told me it was just like eating out, but better. My best friend happened to stop by and grabbed a piece. She said it was the best she had ever had. I made this with the traditional mashed potatoes from this site. The best part is, the ingredients were already on hand. This will be a staple recipe in my house from now on! Thanks for posting.

I tried adding additional spices like garlic powder, paprika and onion powder as other suggested, but I really prefer the simple salt, garlic powder and pepper taste.  I season the chicken prior to rolling in flour.  Your chicken will retain the flavor/seasonings this way.  When you sear the chicken to the oil heated on medium high for at LEAST 5-10 min., and then simmer for 30 min. (turn once), that will give you the juicy chicken with the tender inside and deep golden brown crisp on outside.  Also, I used a regular skillet, and my chicken did not stick.  The key is to simply let your skillet with oil heat up for a good 10 min. before adding chicken.

I love this recipe and so does my family. I found that soaking the chicken in either milk or buttermilk overnight really helps to make it melt in your mouth!

5 stars for the method!  Like many others, I upped & added to the seasonings.  My son, who hates it when I attempt frying chicken LOL, LOVED this chicken and it's because of the method and timing.  My other attempts produced undercooked inside/overcooked outside and vice versa.  The timing here is right on.  I did use shortening, which for me crisps the crust better than oil.  I always fry chicken in a cast iron pan.  This attempt came out perfect - even with boneless, skinless breast meat.  I also used a tip learned from hotmama44's review regarding using only egg yolks (I thinned it with a little water).  Thanks hotmama44 & thanks Marilyn for the submission!

Perfect Southern Sunday Chicken!  Green Beans, creamed corn, sliced tomatoes and biscuits.  OMG, good eating that brings back memories.  This doesn't need anything but pepper and salt to flavor.

Sounds  good. but pepper the chicken first to make the chicken skin tough.  And don't forget the paprita in the seasoning.

I made this for dinner this evening and it turned out GREAT.  I combined several hints and tips from other users to make my own special combonation.  I brined the chicken (drumsticks) for about 2 hours in salt water, then soaked it buttermilk.  I had a box of Zataran's Chicken Fry and used it instead of the flour and spices. Basically it's the same thing anyway.  I put the Zataran's  in a bag and coated my drumsticks two at a time, frying them 4 at a time in a heavy skillet in light olive oil.  I made 8 total and served it with scalloped potatoes, green beans seasoned with country ham bits, and a ranch n bacon pasta salad.  For dessert I made a yellow cake with chocolate frosting.  I served beer and soda with the meal.  It was fantastic, the best fried chicken I've made years.  I don't recommend double-dipping the mix, esp in egg...it works much better the simple way.  Thanks to all the other members who posted their tips, you were a big help.

This recipe almost got 3 stars instead of 5 (I would like to give it 5 ½).  

Per the advice of others I added onion powder, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and paprika.  I bathed it in icy salt water.  I then took a 3 hour nap.  Afterwards I deep fried it in vegetable oil instead of pan frying it.  It turned out to be the prettiest looking fried chicken I’ve ever seen.  (here is where the 3 stars come in)  I took a bite out of the first batch and the taste was very salty.  So I rinsed the other uncooked pieces in fresh water and cooked another batch and it was still too salty.  

I decided to go to the store to get some chicken (I used all drumsticks).  This time I used less salt and bathed it for about 45 minutes.  I really believe the reason it was too salty the first time was because of the amount of salt I used instead of the amount of time it sat in the water.

This batch, still looking good, was awesome.  This was some of the best fried chicken I’d ever had and the next day it was even better (6 stars).  I cooked the drumsticks for about 18 to 20 minutes.  It was probably done cooking at about 15 minutes but my wife likes all her meats well done.

This was my very first time cooking this recipe along with a mash potato recipe I got from this website.  The mash potatoes were a 5 star too.

This is the way I was taught to cook chicken by my Mother and she said this was the way her Mother taught her. I am 64 so it has been in our family a long time. An iron skillet is a must.

I brined the chicken and added more seasonings to the flour.  Goya adobo is a great multi purpose seasoning.  Delicious recipe!

So easy.  I used oil because it was all I had.  I also coated in egg yolk per another reviewer's recommendation.  Worked perfectly!

This recipe is PERFECT! Thank you so much for sharing! I took the advice of another reviewer and brined the chicken for about an hour. We are big chicken eaters and I have been wanting to try brining and figured this was the perfect opportunity. The cooking time was perfect, my first batch of 5 legs I cooked 15 minutes longer because I was afraid it would not be done...BIG MISTAKE..it was dry and way over done. I did the next batch of 5 EXACTLY as the recipe said and it was juicy and crisp and absolutely PERFECT.

I've been frying my chicken this way for years! I don't like all the gloppy mess of eggs and milk. I do add a few more seasonings though. I use McCormick Montreal Chicken seasoning and McCormick Unseasoned Meat Tenderizer. My chicken always comes out juicy,tender, and full of flavor. I also use Crisco Butter Flavored Shortening to fry mine in. The technique is what earned the 5 stars. Enjoy! You wont be disappointed!

I am a first time cook....my husband usually does all the cooking....so I made this one my first real attempt. My husband had seconds and my 5 year old, who does not like meat, actually ate a whole piece of chicken. Excellent meal which I will make again!

This is the way my grandmother made chicken and this is the way I make chicken though for my family we use and elelctric fry pan so I don't have to make so many batches.  I add more salt and pepper, poultry seasoning garlic and onion powder, paprika, and a dash of cayenne pepper to the dredge.

This was the first time I was ever able to make fried chicken not burnt chicken.  The cast iron skillet is the key.  Very very good.  My husband and daughter loved it!

Marilyn: This is just what I needed, The technique is perfect. The med high heat, then the lid cover to add the steam, then the browning,Thank you so much, wow, i think I have it now. I do admit, I got a little scared with just salt and pepper, so I added a small amt of garlic powder and some poultry seasoning, It was very moist, and worth the time in my opinion. Thanks, Pedinurse.

this recipe was a great idea. Im my buttermilk I added all the ingredients listed but added season salt ,lemon pepper,Accent, and parsley flakes (dried). It was the" bomb" as stated by my family.  I also omitted the seasonings and added powdered ranch dressing after I dipped the pieces into the b, milk. Just roll in the ranch dsg. powder that you buy in the pouch.

I give the recipe itself 3 stars, but the cooking method is 5+ stars. Total time from freezer to table was 5 hours but the time I spent actively cooking was way less than an hour.  
I took the frozen drumsticks(that was all I had) and put them in a ziplock with 2 quarts of water, 1/2 cup of sea salt and a splash of tabasco. I brined them for 3 hours. Then I soaked them in a cup of "buttermilk"(regular milk spoiled with a couple teaspoons of cream of tartar) and another splash of tabasco for another hour.  
Then I rinsed them off and dried them well. I seasoned the chicken with pepper and a cajun seasoning blend. I also season about a cup of flour with more pepper and cajun seasoning(I didn't measure how much).  I put this in a ziplock and shook the drumsticks in the mixture one at a time.  I then let them sit out on my cutting board for about 20-30 minutes to make sure that the coating would stick.  
I used my dutch oven and put two cups of oil and let it heat on medium high for about 5 minutes. I put the drumsticks down and let them brown for about a minute and a half on each side then I turned down the heat to low and covered the dutch oven with aluminum foil and let it cook for 20 minutes. Then I took the aluminum foil off and turned the chicken once more and turned the heat up to medium to finish crisping up the other side.  Then I let the chicken drain on paper towels for 5 minutes. The chicken was amazing.  The outside was crunchy and the inside was moist and flavorful.

It was so good, I could've become teary-eyed knowing that I made it myself!  I could never fry chicken the way I wanted to before this recipe.  Out of habit, I added a few onion ring halves on the top of the chicken while they fried;  this recipe itself is what made it all come together perfectly.  Thanks so much!!

This was my first time to fry chicken.  I even live in the south and used to raise meat chickens!  I used two iron skillets for one chicken.  I put plenty of crisco (didn't measure) and did as one person suggested and let it get good and hot before putting the chicken in.  I also added paprika to the spices.  The kids said that it was better than KFC!

Very simple & very tasty. Used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and oil instead of shortening - still turned out a treat. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was good as a basic recipe. I found that I prefered to add many different spices to tweak it a bit for added flavor. As is, was just a bit bland.

If you are not going to be using cast iron, be sure to lower your heat even more than you would have with the first batch. For some reason my secon batch cooked too fast and I burned it just a bit. I would like to try this recipe again with cast iron. Only reason I deducted a star is because I thought it needed more spice.

I followed this recipe very closely but the chicken came out dry and tough. I'm not sure what went wrong. Possibly because I used skinless breasts or maybe cooked too long / too hot?

I used Ziploc bags instead of paper bags, which tore more. Instead of a whole chicken cut up, I decided to buy a pack of chicken legs and a pack of chicken breasts. It turned out wonderful!

This is how we always fried chicken growing up in the South. The cooking method described in this recipe is spot on! A good, "seasoned" cast iron skillet is a MUST! It's the BEST heat conductor.We use seasoned salt instead of regular salt.We also use a little garlic powder and a pinch of MSG (Accent). Also, sprinkling a little bit of the seasonings on the raw chicken before flouring gives it more flavor. We never used a recipe or an exact amount of seasonings, we just seasoned to taste.

The chicken was good, but not crispy enough. For my second batch I put the chicken in the flour, then in egg, and then back in the flour.  This made it more crispy.  I also added about 1 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning. The chicken was moist and tender.

This recipie worked out great.  I was so excited to have my first perfect batch of fried chicken.  I seasoned the chicken with some mesquite seasoning before shaking with the flour mixture. Also for the 25 minute period I set the stovetop on low, because my pieces were kind of small.  Excellent chicken.  Thanks!!

This is similar to the way I've fried chicken for 45 years.  Since I usually cook for at least 10 people, who always eat at least 2 pieces each, that involves a lot of frying!  I dredge my chicken in the seasoned flour and place one layer in the hot grease, browning on both sides.  I then remove that layer and brown another layer, and continue browning layers and removing them until the last layer.  When I turn the last layer over, I add the previously browned chicken on top of that layer, and cover the skillet.  (I often use two dutch ovens since I make so much.)  I then turn the heat down to low and let it all cook about 15 minutes.  I then remove the lid and all but the bottom layer of chicken.  I turn the heat back up to medium high and crisp up that layeron both sides, then remove it to a wire rack over a jellyroll pan and place it in a 200º oven to keep warm while I crisp up the rest of the chicken, one layer at a time.  Everyone who has eaten my fried chicken claims it is the best they've ever eaten.

best home fried chicken ever! husband adored it. i took another reviewers advice and coated the chicken with egg in between flour coatings. made the chicken nice and crispy. i also went with 2 cups of peanut oil instead of shortening. would give it 5 stars, but more seasoning is def. needed for flavor.

Wow!  I actually made fried chicken that turned out right!  I've been trying now and then for years with no success, but this recipe was just what I needed.  I did season the flour more than what was called for in the recipe, but I wanted to stay true to its simplicity.  I used seasoned salt and black pepper to taste.  I also decided to use a pack of thighs instead of a whole cut-up chicken so that all of the pieces were evenly done at roughly the same time.  I will likely try using breasts too, so it will be little healthier (haha!).  I used a cast iron skillet; it really does make a difference.  
  I had originally planned to try some "fancier" recipes with batter, egg, etc in the near future, but I think I've found a winner here.  Any recipe that makes my husband this happy gets 5 stars from me.

Love this chicken, just like I learned to make from my mom & Grandma. For extra flavor I add poultry seasoning to the flour mixture.

Yummy! Could use just a bit more seasoning if you want more flavor. I used vegetable shortening because it is all I buy. I made chicken tenders for the kids (much shorter cooking time for those) and chicken drum sticks for hubby and I. Perfect cooking time on those! Very good. I also dipped the chicken in an egg/milk mixture before coating in flour.

well I didn't post a picture because there was none left. Finally I have found "my" recipe for FRIED CHICKEN! No messing around with milk, eggs and all the messy stuff. One definable advantage to this recipe is this chicken is just as delicious cold. Thanks Marilyn for posting this--guess whats for CHRISTMAS DINNER?

So good and so easy. I just got a new cast iron pan, and I'm excited to use this recipe over and over!  I added some paprika and thyme to my  flour for more flavor. For an even thicker, crispier crust, coat the chicken in the flour mixture, then in egg, and then in flour again. Delicious.

Delicious! One star off for seasoning. I knew S&P wouldn't do the trick. I did the salt brine for 2 hours, rinsed, and patted dry. Seasoned with Old Bay, and shook in the flour. The rest just as described. Who knew fried chicken could be so SIMPLE?!?

This was excellent, and my husband told me multiple times how much he loved it.  I did brine for 2 hours before cooking, and that did seem to add tenderness and moisture.  It didn't crisp up quite as much as I thought it would, although I followed the directions to a tee.  Advice on that?

The cooking method in this recipe is right on the money, although the recipe lacks seasoning. But that is where we come in and add our own special touches. I like to try different seasonings and always like to add garlic. I also like to dip again in the flour mixture after dipping into an egg mixture. Taking the lid off made the crust crispy and we all enjoyed this very much. Thank you!

I've always cooked my chicken this way except for one little thing:  I salt &  the chicken BEFORE flouring it.  This to me makes all the difference. Once I put the chicken in to fry I pepper it.  Try it--see if you like the results!  Good ole' Southern fried chicken--you just can't beat it.

I think this chicken is awesome but I only gave it four stars because I think there are some changes I need to make next time before I give it 5 stars.  First, I love the Crisco idea, been eating fried chicken my whole life and never used crisco or covered the pan but I think these are key. I feel it made a big difference and I too soaked the chicken pieces in salt water for an hour prior to cooking and after flouring, I let rest for about 20 minutes while I peeled and cut the potatoes for the mash.  My only problem was this.  The chicken got a beautiful golden brown on my first fry, then when I covered it and put on low, my lowest setting not the med. low, it got way too dark for my liking and I was afraid the chicken would get burned before it was done so I took it out and put in the oven for about 20 more minutes so the breasts would cook through.  My husband said the legs were too dry so clearly I needed to take them out sooner but my white breasts were very moist and totally delish.  I don't know if just using the pan method would actually crisp up the chicken that had gotten all gooey and greasy from covering the pan and I don't want that so I may have put them in the oven just for that reason unless they dry out on the paper towels..will have to see next time.  Other than using a few more spices like garlic and onion powders and paprika, I kept everything the same, also used a cast iron skillet. Long story short, great chicken and I will try and get it right next time!

Very good, needed a bit more seasonings (should have read the other reviews before I made it!) The shortening is what makes this recipe so good, I think, I've tried frying chicken in oil before and never liked the results.  This is a definite keeper!  Hubby says it's just like his grandma's fried chicken.

Awesome!  I was shocked at how well my first try at "real" fried chicken turned out.  Thanks so much for sharing!  I did have a problem regulating the temperature of my skillet, but I'm a novice so not recipe's fault at all!  I'll keep trying until I get it right!

Very yummy. I'm a college student and living on my own for the first time. This was my first attempt at fried chicken and it turned out great. Easy recipe and so good that I went home to make it for my parents. The pan makes all the difference, defnitely use cast iron.

Although the outcome was good, I think additional seasoning is needed to give it an extra kick.
I really liked using the shortening rather than oil to fry the chicken. It was less messy and did not splatter like oil will.

I know all about this recipe, it was MY grandma's recipe, too!  There's just no other way to make good fried chicken.  And it is true, you do need a good iron skillet, or it's just not the same.  I love the Christmas Day idea, too, I might have to adopt that tradition.  ENJOY!!

Truly a Southern fried chicken.  Perfect instructions.
Please don't mess with a basic thing like SOUTHERN fried chicken.
Want eggs.?  Scramble a few, but don't roll chicken in them.  Yuck.

This is the basic recipe I've used all of my life. It's also the one my Momma used. And her Momma before that. And...Need I say more? I like to salt and pepper the chicken for an hour or more before coating it, and I let the chicken 'set up' after coating (let it rest for 20 minutes or so, in a single layer, before frying--the coating will stick better). I use a bit more salt and pepper than is called for here, and I often add a tablespoon or two of cornstarch to the flour (it makes for a crispier coating that lasts), but it's still the same basic recipe. You can fool around with it, add your own combination of spices  (in her later years, Mom liked turmeric and sometimes cumin), and I've played around with it, too. Eventually, I just start craving this recipe. In fact,I'm cooking it right now:)

My six year old told me I could do better when he tasted this chicken.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the crust was very crispy and stuck very well to the chicken.  Having said that, it was VERY bland and that was after I added additional herbs and salt.  I also  marinated the chicken in buttermilk for about 40 minutes before I fried it.  I would add more salt/seasoning to this recipe.

The second time, I did follow the tips from other users to brine the chicken in a half cup of salt to 2 quarts of water for an hour, added 1 tsp of paprika to the mix, and after flouring the chicken I put them on a pan until the coating was gummy, it took 45 minutes for me, I fried them in canola because I didn't have shortening. It sound time consuming, but most of it is waiting.

This was my first time ever making fried chicken.  I did use twice as much shortening - just thought it needed more to properly fry.  I think this just really needs more seasoning!  Taste was very bland to me.

I made this recipe to rave reviews from my boys! I doubled the pepper though, and added a tsp of Chili Powder.  It was the yummiest & easiest recipe!  I even made a gravy from 3 tbsp pan drippings, 3 tbsp of the leftover flour mixture, and 2 cups milk. I have never made gravy, and I couldn't believe how easy & tasty it was!

I am a good cook, though admittedly not a fryer of chicken.  I followed the recipe, I thought to a "T", in a cast iron skillet, but the chicken turned soggy during the covered phase and when I increased the heat, the skin stuck to the skillet, so that when I was done, I had greasy chicken with no skin left on.  Certainly not challenging the recipe, would just like to know what you think I did wrong.

This is the only way I knew to fry chicken growing up - my Mom's family is from the south and from the cast iron skillet to the simple ingredients this makes by far the best fried chicken you will ever eat - my Mom wets each piece of chicken under the tap before putting in the flour - it helps the more flour to cling.  The other necessity is to get the freshest and least processed chicken you can find.

Easy and delicious. My only "constructive thought" is: I found the chicken needed more salt and seasoning, so I'll add more next time. Otherwise, it was better than any other recipe I've found so far for fried chicken.

I used a non-stick skillet and cooking oil. No problem sticking what so ever. I, too, added some garlic powder and paprika. (No need tho). Delicious, moist and crisp.

needs more spice it's a little bland on it's own. i used the suggestion of only using the yolk to coat chicken with and it works out great.

Finally, the perfect fried chicken!  Three elements are key: Crisco, a cast iron fryer with lid, and proper timing.  While others prefer garlic salt, onion salt, and other flavorings, I prefer the gold old Southern staples of salt and pepper.  Mmm!  Thanks for teaching this male Northerner how to fry chicken like a true Southern cook!

This was SUPER. I scaled it down for two and I didn't have any shortening so I used bacon grease instead. (I keep a cup of bacon grease in my fridge at all times) I soaked the chicken in buttermilk and hot sauce while at work. I peppered the chicken before placing it in the paper bag. The chicken came out so moist and tasty. Thanks!!!

Just plain 'ole good stuff. I must admit we are a savory seasoning lover family so I added some onion powder, garlic powder, fried chicken seasoning, and cayenne pepper to my chicken and the flour batter before frying. This was definitely a WINNER!!

This is a recipe that stands the test of time for my family too.  We have also placed the chicken in the oven once it has been browned.  The reason for this is the quanity we prepare at one time.  We have a large extended family.  The one huge difference is the reduction and then increase in heat.  The chicken is moist, pleasing to the eye and easy to prepare and clean-up after.  If you like a little extra flavor boost add a little paprika and garlic powder.  Yum,Yum!
Thank-you Marilyn for an awsome recipe.

not bad... I might make again.  Based on the reviews, I covered in flour, then egg and flour again.  It was crispy.  It didn't have much flavor.  The chicken was moist though.

We did this a little different.  We injected a chicken the night before and deep fried it with this recipe.  It was the best and cripiest chicken we'd ever had.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  We'll be using it again and again.

I have chicken thawing at home and wasn't sure what I wanted to do with it, until I remembered this recipe.  My Mom made the best fried chicken, but of course she doesn't use a recipe. I have never had any luck trying to recreate the taste and texture of her chicken until I tried this recipe.  It came out just like Mom's, maybe even a little better!!!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe and all the great tips!

YUMMMMM!!!  I made this tonight, and hubby loved it!! I added a Tablespoon each of garlic and onion powder to the flour, and since all I had was butter flavored Crisco, I used 1/2 cup of that with 1/2 cup canola oil, and it was great!!! Try it, it's easy to make and tastes great!

This a recipe I use all the time except I use season salt (instead of salt). I add garlic and onion powder and chile and paprika powder.

The only thing I did was improvised using tender flaky lard as I didn't have other on hand all and all I think it turned out great better then what thought it would and I also tried egg yoke and put some bread crumbs in with flower.

This is the way my mother and grandmother both made fried chicken. It's also the way my husband's (also a multi-generational Georgian) grandmother made fried chicken and they raised chicken on their farm. I'm from the deep south (5th generation Georgian) and this is the only way I had fried chicken until the fast food places came along. It makes for a thinner crust, and to my mind is much more the traditional deep south fried chicken than one where you use eggs to make a thicker crust.

The recipe did not call for eggs, and so the flour mix fell off the oil immediately. Also, I wish it stated that a cast iron skillet is necessary for the chicken if you don't want it to stick to the bottom of your cookware. I will try again eventually, changing it a bit, but todays skinless chicken twas not praiseworthy.

This fried chicken was much easier to make then I thought it would be. I added cajun seasoning and garlic powder to the flour instead of salt and pepper. I think I might flip half way through next time. I didnt use a cast iron skillet but I will try it next time. Delicious!!

i did not have a problem with sticking i used a regular pan and just added a tad bit more oil. i LOVE this recipe i have been trying to find a good one for fried chicken and not that i found one my boyfreind says its a keeper lol. i did add garlic salt and cayenne pepper and also as one other reviewer mentioned i dipped in flour then in egg yolk then back in the flour which gave the chicken a more crunchy coating in the end very good!

This recipe is exactly as my mother and grandmother and great grandmother made it from East Texas. I usually just use season salt instead of salt and pepper. This is the way it was done on a farm with no frills!

Real tasty chicken!  Took about an hour total from prep to finished cooking.  Definitely wish I had added more salt and pepper.  Crunch and texture were great, but flavor was a little flat.

mmmmmmmm!  Just like Mamaw makes in KY.  I pulled the skin off a few chicken legs, dipped them in milk/egg wash, and heated up some crisco!  I don't own a cast iron skillet, so I just fried 'er up in my omlette pan.  MMMMMMMMMMMm

Great recipe!  I added a few seasonings, which can be to anyone's liking.  I have tried frying chicken many times but it never comes out right.  Thanks to your timing, it came out PERFECT!!!  I can see that this will be a favorite at my house.  Thanks!

This recipe is the standard for those of us south of the Mason/Dixon line.  I tend to use more pepper than called for, which gives it more kick. But, of course, most folks in the south don't measure, per se.

This is the only way my mom would fry chicken except she started using vegetable oil instead of lard.  My mom would always soak the chicken in water with salt and pepper in the fridge during the day(brining). For the longest time I would only eat her fried chicken. Now that I am grown and she is no longer here this is the only way I will ever make my fried chicken.

This is fantastic chicken.  I use boneless skinless breasts and add poultry seasoning and cayenne pepper to the flour. I also use vegetable oil instead of shortening, and everyone loves it.

With my chicken, I soak the chicken in butter milk. About 2 to 4 hours.If you don't have butter milk make your own with milk and adding vinegar to it. And I use a little more salt and pepper a TBSP. each.

My husband asked for fried chicken, so I looked around this site and decided on this one.  I'm very glad I did.  It was very easy to make, crisped up beautifully, and tasted great.  I followed the recipe as stated, except I didn't use cast iron, I just used my largest fry pan.  He loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is fine, but closer to "bland" than tasty without some spice tweaking.  Seasoning the chicken before dipping it in the flour helps a lot.  I used a garlic salt/paprika mixture, descreasing "regular" salt so as not to make the chicken too salty.  Reducing the heat after browning works perfectly.

Definitely need to add more salt and pepper than the recipe calls for, I sprinkled extra on mine then placed in the oven for about 10 minutes. (My oven was already going at 400 deg.F)  Lots of work, but well worth it!!!

Made this for dinner last night.  It's very good, but like other recipes I've tried, not much flavor.  I even added more spices to the flour mixture, which helped.  Will add more next time.  There will definitely be a next time, this was easy and the chicken was very moist.

I love fried chicken when it's done right and this one is definately one of the best I've had.  I do think it definately needs more salt, I would add a tablespoon and not just a teaspoon next time.  As some steak lovers are not big on salting their steak, I'm not big on salting my chicken because I think it takes away from the chicken's natural flavors, but I definately think this recipe needs more salt.  I loved it though!  Also, I added 1/2 teaspoon of Paprika to give it a little bit of a kick!  It was yummy :o).

Just like mom used to make!  Quick, and oh so simple and easy to make.  My chicken came out so tender, and so crispy.  The cast iron skillet is definitely the key to making this recipie turn out perfectly.  I will be making this yummy chicken again and again!

Great core recipe. The cooking instructions are on point. The seasoning, I spiced up more as well as seasoning the chicken itself before dredging. Because of this, I rated 4 instead of 5 stars, but do not let that deter you!!

Just like my mother and her mother before her. I still make it this way. Shortening is the best but I usually use vegetable oil and add 2 to 3 Tbls real butter. Gives a nice golden brown. The lid and slow cooking makes it so tender. Always salt and pepper to taste. Everyone’s taste is different !! Great recipe ??

This is the best recipe I have ever made for fried chicken. I have made it a dozen times. And for National Fried Chicken Day it is a winner as always.  As for other reviewers, there is no egg in the recipe??? If you don't follow the recipe it won't turn out the way they made it.

I decided to make this because of the great reviews. Not sure what happened to this chicken but I followed the recipe and it was terrible! The only adjustment I made was to add some garlic and cayenne powders. Yes, my shortening was HOT when I put the chicken in the pan (my husband the chef asked me 1st thing!). It browned but then the coating turned to mush when it was in the 25-minute covered cooking mode. It did not crisp up in the final stages of cooking (after the cover was removed). My whole kitchen smelled like greasy KFC and the chicken actually tasted bland and greasy. There was no crust. I couldn't eat it. I would have given it 1 star but it was easy to prepare. I will not make it again.

What a coincidence.  The recipe and process is very similar to our family favorite Fried chicken. 
The only difference are : 
1. we marinate the chicken with Tumeric and salt before coating it with all other dry ingredients. This give it a better taste, brighter color that looks very appetizing and good for the tummy.
2. We cook using vegetable oil (not shortening). 
Give it a try using our family favorite variation. 
Yummylicious!!!

Great recipe.  Easy and delicious.  I used canola oil in a Teflon dutch oven and had no sticking whatsoever.  Just be sure the oil is hot enough that drops of cold water dance.  I added a touch of garlic powder, paprika and cayenne.  Awesome.  We rarely eat fried food, so this was a big treat.  Along with milk pan gravy over mashed potatoes, corn and coleslaw...strawberry shortcake for dessert.  Comfort food doesnt get better than this.

This was my first time ever making fried chicken. I brought it to a potluck where there were multiple people who grew up eating authentic southern soul food and they RAVED about it!  It was a huge success. I made some modifications to the recipe after reading other reviews: 1) I brined the chicken in a solution of 2 quarts water and 1/2 cup salt for about an hour before cooking (would have done 2 hours but I didn't have time); 2) I added 1 tsp garlic power and 1 tsp paprika to the flour mixture; 3) I dipped each piece of chicken in milk before dredging it in the flour mixture; and 4) because my cast iron pan was not nearly big enough for the amount of chicken I was making, I just fried the pieces in the pan long enough to get them nicely browned on each side (which took about 7-8 minutes total per batch) and then I put them in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes to finish cooking. I used an instant-read thermometer to check for doneness. This method produced chicken that was perfectly cooked through, very moist and flavorful, and crispy on the outside without being burnt. The only downside is that the bottom of each piece got a little mushy because of being in the pan in the oven, although that didn't detract from the deliciousness. If I make this again, I'll try putting a rack in my glass baking dish and baking the chicken on the rack to avoid this issue.  Thank you for a great recipe!

First two star I have given.  There is just better ways to fry chicken.  I think if I did this again I would leave off cover and add more spices. Very plain and not as crispy as other fried chickens I tired. I think its because of moisture building up when the cover is on.

Loved, loved this recipe! I took others advice and brined my chicken (only for 1 hour since that's all I had time for). I couldn't keep my husband and brother-in-law away. I thought I'd have left overs, but guess not. Thanks Marilyn!

I've always had a hard time making fried chicken and basically gave up on trying to make it. When I found this recipe I decided to give it one more try and I'm glad I did!!  I didn't use a whole chicken and instead bought a package of legs because they are the favorite in my house and they turned out yummy!

Delicious! I didn't use the shortening because I didn't realize I was out and I live about 30 minutes away from any store so I just used the oil I had on hand and I needed to use up some chicken strips I had so I fried those and they turned out great. They didn't need the whole 25 minutes to cook though since they were small. Thanks!!

delicious !!   I was raised on chicken fried this way.  Tastes best fried with the skin on & using shortening or lard instead of vegetable oil. We enjoyed this very much but because of fat & calories, will have this only occasionally.

The shortening worked like a charm.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into large chunks, so my cooking time was less.  The chicken was very moist inside and crispy outside.  Delish!

Excellent! I agree with the May 18 posting to brine the chicken in salted water for about 2 hours before cooking, This will keep the chicken juicy when fully cooked.

This is just like my mom makes.  Another variation is to put the fried chicken into a dutch oven with lid when finished frying, add water & simmer.  It makes its own gravy & is so tender & juicy.  I'm not sure of the amount of water, I add a little (1/2 cup) & keep checking.  When I was a kid we had fried chicken just like Marilyn's recipe at least once a week.  I especially loved it when mom took the extra step to make it this way.  The chicken is so tender & you won't be able to eat it with your fingers.  It's a bit messy to eat, but soooo good.  I think I'll make some tonight.  Every piece will be your favorite piece.

it was good and easy. I did soak in a homemade buttermilk (1 tablespoon white vingar in measuring cup then fill to 1 cup mark with milk). I also added more seasoning to the flour mixture. Turned out really nice.

This was great. I made modifications with seasonings but that is a personal preference. Still worthy of 5 stars. I didn't have an iron skillet but used frying pan and made lid with tin foil. You don't want to cover completely as it will soak up all the oil. I also let sit in milk for 1 hour. Awesome. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

I love this recipe. I didn't have shortening though so i lightly coated the chicken in mayo before I tossed them in the flour. The chicken came out SO tender and juicy and i cut it up to put in salad and my husband said he wants this one again for sure!

I thought as this was cooking that I would not like the taste. The smell of the shortening seemed overwhelming so that I thought the chicken would taste like it.  WRONG!  It was wonderful!  My husband the fried chicken lover thought it was the bestest!  Thanks for the sharing!

I followed the recipe step by step ( mind you there are not that many) and it did not blow my socks off. I did not have a cut up chicken on hand, however I used organic chicken wings and drumsticks. Had to season the chicken with lots of S&P. Also, I put it in a brine for 45 minutes before.

I've made this dish several times and 
ALWAYS get it requested again.  My problem is my DH likes Spicy chicken and I can't seem to get it spicy enough.  I've seasoned before flour, seasoned after flouring but I just can't seem to get it spicy enough.  I will try as Lynn A suggested and hopefully it works.  I still Love this recipe because my chicken is always cooked all the way through.

this was my first recipe from this site...and my first time frying chicken.  OMG! i grew up in a house w/2 grandmothers and never learned how (imagine that). anyway...my husband wasn't thrilled about the texture.  he wanted cruchier. :( i followed the recipe to the letter adding more garlic and paprika and season all (for flavoring.  the flavor was fine but the skin was too soft.  i even double- floured after dipping in egg.  what did i do?

I could never get it right before and this is right on the money.  I seasoned it a little differently but my main concerned was how to get it crispy and and flavorful.  Now I know the secret.  Thanks!

I followed this recipe to a tee and my chicken came out uncrispy for some reason. I don't know what I did wrong. I've tried to make fried chicken before and it's never crispy enough. It was delicious though. I made up a sauce of part bbq sauce and part red's hot sauce. MMM MMM Yummy!!!

Very good! The directions that are written in detail are the key to success in this recipe. I added a few more spices, such as seasoned salt. Thanks, Marilyn!!
