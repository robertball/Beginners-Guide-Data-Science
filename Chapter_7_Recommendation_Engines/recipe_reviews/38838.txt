Great Flavor !!!! Made this last night for dinner on my George Foreman grill.I did everything according to recipe.I marinated a thick Ribeye steak for about 9 hours and sliced a large portabella mushroom for the sauce.It was soo delish !!!! I often sautee mushrooms or onions with our steak but My DH always uses steak sauce anyway but with this recipe no steak sauce was needed. He loved it !!! I thought it was a bit sweet but very tasty. We will definately be having this again. I made this again and had a different taste - The cocktail sauce you use makes a big difference in flavor. Thank you for sharing your recipe

I did not change any of the ingredients but I did change how it was cooked. Instead of on the grill, I cubed the steak and let it simmer in all the marinade in a large skillet. After the steak was a little over half way done, I added the mushrooms and let it continue simmering. I served it over rice and it turned out great. The only thing I am going to do different next time is add some sliced onion to the mix.

Based on what I had in the refrigerator, I substituted Heinz chili sauce for the cocktail sauce, poked holes in the sirloin steaks, and marinated in a freezer bag overnight.  YUM!  Great recipe.

I don't know if this is new to the site or not...but it's EXCELLENT!  Everyone, try this.  You don't have to marinate too long (I added extra garlic, because I love it soo much) and you still come out with tender, tasty steak.  I broiled in the oven, 6 mins on each side.  Mmmm!!!

This was just ok for us.  We marinated for about 8 hours and then grilled the steaks outside. I think I would like it better if I would have cooked the marinade in a saucepan and then served as a side sauce for the steak. It was something different though, we usually use "Perfect Marinade for Steak" from this site and it's really good.

So great!  The second time I made it I added a whole onion as well.  I broiled my steak for 5 minutes on each side (medium rare).  Yummy!!

Excellent! I didn't have mushrooms so I just used it as a marinade. It was easy & really tasty. I used less cocktail sauce just because I only had about 1/4 cup but it was still really good. Thanks for the recipe.

This marniade is pretty good.  Makes a sweeter steak, which is nice every now and again.

When I combined all the ingredients for this recipe and tasted it, I thought it was still a little bland. Since I like my marinades super flavorful, I added another clove of garlic, about a teaspoon of fresh ground pepper, a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce, and a drop of hickory flavored liquid smoke. Turned out fabulous!!! The reserved sauce cooked up with mushrooms really topped off the dish, I will definitely be using this recipe again. Next time though, maybe I'll swap out the honey for pure maple syrup, yummy:)

I like this b/c it is different than my traditional olive oil, salt and pepper marinade.  My bf questioned the combo and then praised it after tasting it.  Nice change from the usual and very tasty!

I tried this last weekend on a London broil.  It was fantastic.  London broils can sometimes be chewy and this was the case with mine; however, the sauce made from the marinade at the end was superb!  I will try it on steaks next time.  Thanks Erin for a wonderful recipe!

This is definitely a keeper for steak marinade.  It kind of reminded me of the sauce that PF Changs uses on their equivalent to General Tso's.  I only marinaded the steaks for about an hour and cooked them on the George Foreman.  Excellent!  We're trying the marinade on chicken tonight! :)

This recipe was OK.  Although I marinated my sirloins for a solid 6 hours as described in the recipe, the marinade didn't seem to add much flavor.  But I like the marinade a lot as a steak sauce.  This recipe has been added to my recipe book under sauces.

Never piece the steak, true steak lovers know that's day 1 stuff.  The pros never ever poke holes in thier steaks. Other than that it's a tasty marinade.

This was delicious! Used Porterhouse steak and portabella mushroom with green onions in the sauce. Only let marinade for an hour but still was very flavorful. I pounded the meat to tenderize it before marinating. I also baked the steaks at 350 in an iron skillet, always keeps the steaks very tender.

Holy smokes - this was yummy.  I added a little fresh cracked pepper and some montreal steak seasoning to the marinade.  Marinaded it for 24hrs. So good. I was very surprised at how extremely yummy this was. I think it is my new favorite marinade of all time. I didn't make the mushrooms/sauce out of the reserve.

I have been on a diet for quite some time now. We decided to cook out, and my boyfriend was looking for a marinade that was "diet friendly." Let me just say, this was the BEST marinade I have EVER tasted! We used it on chicken instead of beef. We simmered the chicken in the marinade for about 1/2 an hour, and then cooked it on the grill. I will never use any other marinade! This was FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!

I wish I could give this more stars, but we just didn't like it very much. It was too sweet for us. The marinade tasted great, but I think once cooked, the tomato brought out more of the honey's sweetness. I'm not sure if reducing the honey would make a difference for us. My only change was to add more garlic and garlic powder to the marinade, and I wasn't going to reduce the marinade for a sauce (no time) so I left the shrooms out. Oh! I used Craig's Cocktail Sauce recipe which uses A1 steak sauce, and I like the flavor this added to the marinade...

Used this marinade for steak that we had with some friends, it was a great hit.  Made a double recipe and cooked the mushrooms in fresh sauce instead of reserving the extra, always a little nervous saving my marinade that has had uncooked meat in it.  It was a great hit and will do it again.

Really didn't like the sweetness of this one.  It might have been better without the honey. Tried the best steak marinade in existence (also on this site) the week before and it was pretty good!

love this.  I skip the shrooms and use this on steak tips, marinating them for a few hours before grilling.  Always a crowd pleaser!

This was awesome! The only thing I did differently is baste the steaks with the marinade at the end of grilling because we didn't have time to let it sit 30 minutes. I cooked the sauce as directed but added onions. Next time I'll try marinating the steaks first. This is a keeper!

This one was just okay for me. Thought the marinade tasted rather strong. Maybe needed less soya sauce. Don't think I'll make this one again.

This was great.  Followed recipe exactly.  Used tritip steak (because it was on sale). Marinated for about 4 hrs. Will make this again.

This was unbelievable, very good.  I was a little nervous with the cocktail sauce, but I think that is what added to the secret ingredient.  The aroma lingered for hours and we wanted more.  I will try this on Chicken or maybe even pork next time ! More of an asian taste !Thank you !

Wasn't totally sure about how this marinade was going to turn out (smelled interesting) but actually tasted great!  Didn't pierce the steaks, just marinated over night then grilled them for dinner, and they were tender and flavouful.  Also, skipped the part with the mushrooms as hubby doesn't particularly care for them.  I'm sure we'll be using this one again :)

very good! i didnt have cocktail sauce so i made my own with a 2/3 cup ketchup 2 tablespoons horseradish and a squeeze of lemon. i didnt have time to marinate but did pour about half over the steaks and mushrooms and let them cook about 10 minutes and served the extra beside the steaks. this really worked with the cheap cut of steaks i used for dinner.

I cooked this steak for dinner last night it was absolutely delicious. I don't have a grill so i cooked it in a skillet on the stove with the sauce. Came out delicious. My husband loved it too.

Really, really good! My boyfriend and I were both a little weirded out by the cocktail sauce but I was really wanting to try something different so I just went ahead with this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly except for the mushrooms as we don't like mushrooms.  However, I did use onions instead and  mixed that in with the boiling sauce.  It came out very tasty! We used a good cut of steak and while I did like the sauce, it kind of overpowered the steak's flavor.  I would recommend using the recipe for preparing a cheaper cut of steak and you would still get the same results as with a more-expensive cut since the flavor of the marinade is so strong. I will use this recipe again in the future! It would also be good to prepare the marinade and mix into a meatloaf, as well -- just an idea!

Another keeper from my husband.  I used angus steaks and beat it to flatten it out.  Delicious!  I did eliminate the mushrooms since he doesn't like then, and I couldn't find any that looked good.  I also used syrup instead of honey.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good, my daughter at two pieces....so I'm happy. It was kind of a mix between bbq chicken and TGI Friday's Jack Daniel's sauce, BUT not AS good. I aslo added onions along with the mushrooms. Def. good enough to make again, but nothing to rave about.

EXCELLENT!  Was a little leary of the ingredient mix, but thought I'd go for it since it got such good reviews.  Followed the recipe exactly and broiled the steak in the oven.  I even made an extra pan of the sauce/marinade with mushrooms because I always like extra sauce.  My parents were in town and they loved it too!  This is definately one of my favorite recipes!!! THANK YOU!

Great steak marinade (I let it sit for two days on some average quality rib eyes) and they were delicious!  I only give it four stars because the extra step of boiling down the extra marinade to make a sauce was a waste of time and didn't complement the dish at all.

Fabulous recipe! Provided great flavor to the steaks I made tonight. The only alteration I made to the marinade was to substitute chili sauce for the cocktail sauce because I was using what I had on hand (both are tomato based). I let these marinate for 8 hours while I was at work. I reserved none of the marinade and didn't make the mushrooms that this recipe called for. Instead I made the Soy Sauce Glazed Mushroom recipe from this site (see my review of that for my changes). The combination of the two recipes was amazing, but the steaks would be good without mushrooms too. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was SO good. My husband and I aren't much for marinades on steak, but these ingredients sounds so 'odd' that I just HAD to try it! VERY good! I can't think of grilling steaks any other way! The only thing I changes was I used approx 1 Tbs of garlic powder because I didn't have the actual garlic. Worked out great! Thanks for sharing! =oD

MMMMMMMMMMM, this recipe was delicious.  I have been looking for a good steak marinade and this truly was great.  I marinaded the steaks over night and then threw it on the grill the next day.  It was mouth watering good.  Thanks

This was really good.  I expected it to be a little more spicy though and next time will add some red pepper flakes or ground red pepper.  Would be great on chicken also as well as pork.  I'll make it again!

Very nice flavor. I did change the recipe a tiny for a few reasons. I forgot to add the cocktail sauce, and I left out the seasoning salt. I also used a low-sodium soy sauce foe health reasons. I was short on time when I found this recipe so I only let it marinate about 15 minutes. The flavor was still very nice and the steaks tender. This is a keeper!

Love this marinade, but I always make a few changes. First, I use this recipe for one whole steak (porterhouse not sirloin). It leaves a lot of marinade extra for the sauce. If I had 2 steaks, I would double the recipe. Second, I make my own cocktail sauce without horseradish using a recipe from genius kitchen. And my last and favorite change is adding red wine to the mushroom-marinade mixture to make it more delicious and sauce-y instead of BBQ-y. Cook off the alcohol and its soooo good. Great for when its too cold to grill.

This is a great marinade for any kind of steak.  Made it just as the recipe was put together and the only thing I might add is a little liquid smoke.  Love it.

This was delicious. I made a few substitutions (coconut oil in place of olive oil), and I made my own cocktail sauce (substituting limes for lemons because limes are superior in every way), and I didn't perforate the steaks as I like my steaks rare and gotta have that warm pink center. Cooked on the stove top in a skillet preheated for 45 minutes, 2 min per side. 10/10 would cook again.

I don't know when I enjoyed a steak this much. I intended on following the recipe as written but was a bit confused on the cocktail sauce. I wondered if it was meant to be the sauce you dip shrimp into and thought that may be odd so I used another suggestion on here to use chili sauce. I also didin't have any fresh mushrooms so I sauteed some thin onion slices and when they were almost tender I added a can of drained mushrooms. Not my favourite but still mighty yummy. It's the sauce that is over the top delicious. This will become a new keeper in our meals. Thanks for sharing.m

First glance at this recipe I thought, Coctail sauce, really?  I had all the ingredients (minus soy sauce)so I figured why not!  I marinaded some cheaper sirloins for 2 days and grilled them outside on the BBQer to medium rare. They came out FANTASTIC!!!!  This will definately be our choice for marinade from now on! Thank you so much for this great recipe!

OMG! We hesitated making this recipe with the cocktail sauce, but it was the secret ingredient!  The sirloin marinated for (7) hours yesterday since 1/2 an hr. for sirloin is not long enough, maybe for ribeye. We grilled it for dinner with garlic mashed potatoes and it was wonderful!!!  We have tried many steak marinades on AR and this is the ONE!

I have to admit that initially I was dubious about this marinade, but the ratings were so good I decided to give it a whirl.  It turned out fantastic!  My husband puts BBQ Sauce on EVERYTHING, and he ate the steak as-is!  I was shocked.  I'm a big horseradish fan, and this totally met us in the middle.   The only thing I changed was to add only one TBSPN honey (well, and omit the mushrooms completely), worried it would be too sweet.  It wasn't at all.  I marinated it for about 2 hours, and it was perfect.  We'll definitely use this one again!

This sauce is absolutely DELICIOUS! I know it would have tasted fantastic on the grill, but my sisters and I cooked it on the stove top adding it to a mushroom and onion stir fry. YUM!

This was delicious and so simple.  I had all of the ingredients in my kitchen.  I marinaded my inexpensive steaks for an hour and then grilled them on my small camping grill.  My family wants me to make this recipe again very soon.  I did not make any changes to the recipe.

This was an ok recipe. Followed it to the letter, everyone liked it, but no over the top reaction.  It tasted like steaks had marinated in BBQ sauce, although they were very flavorful. My family likes the 3 pepper rub for flat iron steaks better!

Over the summer, I've tried numerous allrecipes beef marinades. So far, this one is my favorite. True, it is different than most, because of the sweetness, but what an interesting, different flavor. My family all enjoyed the t-bone flavor, marinated for 24 hours. Still, none of the three even tried the mushroom sauce. Nuts. It rocked my taste buds with intensity. I prepared a double batch of sauce on the side, so I didn't have to wonder if I boiled the mixture used for the steaks long enough.

This is by far the best marinade I have ever made.  We had this tonite for supper.  I maridnaded the steaks for about 5 1/2 hours and they were fantastic.  My 14yr old raved.  I will be using this again and again.  I did double the recipe and used chili sauce instead because that's what I had on hand.  Very, very good.  Thanks much.

My husband has recently gotten into grilling and I have of course encouraged this. Today he asked me to find a marinade and as an avid user of this site I came here. We chose this recipe because we had all of the ingredients, but we will continue to use it because it is phenomenal. We are planning on having people over next week for steaks so that we can have it again.

This was quite unusual.  Followed directions, except I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  The steak was tender and tasty, but as a mushroom lover, not so sold on the mushroom sauce. I may have used too much horseradish in the cocktail sauce. Would I make again....maybe.

This recipe was great!  Since I don't like mushrooms I substituted them for diced red, green, and yellow peppers.  It was a great combination and I will definitely use this recipe again in the future.

I have to admit I was skeptical; I don't know why. But this was fantastic! Without a doubt I'll be using this again. I made this for Mother's Day and my mom loved it! The mushroom sauce is great, which is saying a lot because I hate mushrooms.

OMG, this was amazing.  As others mentioned, we also used spicy cocktail sauce.  Marinated overnight on rib-eye's.  Love mushrooms on our steak, this was a nice change in flavours. Definately will make again.

This recipe is fantastic.  Who knew with cocktail sauce.  I followed the recipe, except  I separated the mushrooms into there own bag.  I added a little extra horseradish for a little extra kick.    I served it to friends and they all were amazed. I will be using it again.

Tandy and tasty! We omitted the mushrooms and enjoyed this without making any changes. I had everything on hand already so that was nice too.

Hi everyone, this is my first time using this site.  This recipe sounds good.  I don't have the 2/3 cup cocktail sauce or mushrooms, but I'm trying it anyway...I need to BBQ steaks in 45 minutes from now, so this recipe was the closest that met my needs.

Not really that great. The flavor was really good, but it didnt work right with steak. Would be really great over pork though.
