I can't honestly rate this recipe because I made several alterations.  I didn't want another spagetti noodle recipe so I made it with ZITI.  I also STEAMED my own SPINACH and added MUSHROOMS and fresh diced TOMATOES (which gave a juicy burst of flavor, I'll add more next time). I couldn't find artichoke hearts canned so I didn't bother.  I also used ITALIAN 5 CHEESE BLEND to give it more parmesan flavor.  I SAUTED fresh ONION and GARLIC that I had on hand and also put those in instead.  I also didn't have paprika.  So..with the changes I made....I LOVED IT and my family enjoyed it as well.  I will definatly make again with my alterations and maybe throw in some chicken for the carnivore in the family.  Thanks for the base for a tasty dish!

We all enjoyed this recipe.  It tasted like spinach artichoke dip with pasta - It was very good.  I did also sautee some onion and garlic instead of minced onion and used shell pasta instead of spaghetti.  Will make again.

This has a nice flavor but I made some major changes. First, I was looking for a rice casserole for Christmas dinner, so I replaced the spaghetti with 1 cup of cooked rice. Then, I only used 1/2 the box of spinach, it was plenty. I also added 1/2 can of corn. Turned out great!

I thought this was really bland.  It's the first recipe I've found on this site that has had a high rating but disappointed me.

With a lot of extra seasoning it could possibly be saved, but I don't think I'll be trying it again.

I loved this more than I thought I would. I used 8 oz of spagetti, 3/4 cup sour cream, I used 1 can of spinach, Omitted Artichokes, I used 5 velvetta slices of cheese that I ripped into 4's,1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, I used real onion minced. It was great. My husband doesn't like spinach but loved this. I will be making this again.

Really yummy! I substituted cheddar for the Monteray Jack and Parmesean, and I left out the artichoke hearts (even though I love them! I didn't have any). I also used a lot of fresh spinach rather than frozen. Delicious! I would call it Spinach Spaghetti and Cheese.

Both my husband and I thought this was a great tasting recipe.  It is quite easy to prepare and cooks up quickly.  I even e-mailed this one to my daughter who also loves spinach and cheese.

There just seemed to be something missing from this casserole.  I did add some garlic and half of a small onion, as well as whole wheat noodles.  My 13 month old loved it, though!  I may try it again with some marinara poured on top.

I loved the flavor combinations in this. I did double the milk sour cream mixture as I could tell it was going to be to dry and it needed even more that that. The noodles really absorbed it. I used rottini noodles instead of spaghetti.

I used spiral pasta, fresh onion, and fresh spinach.  I also added 1 tsp of garlic. I browned the onion and garlic in olive oil, added the spinach to wilt it and added this along with the pasta to the sour cream mixture.
All else was the same and I baked it as directed.  Thank you for the really good recipe - I'm sure the original is also good, I just can't help myself. :)

Yum! Easy and delicious! The changes I made were to use plain yogurt instead of sour cream, I sauteed a chopped onion instead of using the dried, I used the entire can of artichoke hearts, and I used shells intstead of spaghetti. I think any shaped pasta would be better than spaghetti. We will be eating this again!

I really needed an idea to use spinach and artichokes in something other than a dip. This person was on the right track. Definitely needed another dimension of flavor to it, so I added diced tomatoes. Also, sauteed garlic, onion, and mushrooms in EVOO, added italian seasonings as well. I used half of a package of spinach and it was plenty! I also substituted mozzerella for the monterey jack, and nixed the paprika. Oh, aaand used mostaccoli instead of spaghetti. Tasted amaaaazing!!

I gave this 2 stars, my husband gave it 4 stars, so I rated it the average!  This was fine, but a little bland for our palates.

This was so wonderful!  Easy, too!  To lower the fat, I used fat-free sour cream, skim milk, and omitted the Monterey Jack cheese - would do that again (the cheese wasn't even missed!).  I omitted the artichoke hearts as well (didn't have any on hand).  I used 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  Be sure and add the salt, pepper, and minced onion when blending the milk and sour cream portion - makes it easier.  This went wonderfully with "Angela's Easy Breaded Chicken" from this site.  The second time I made this, I used penne pasta instead of spaghetti (was easier to eat!) - I doubled everything and used a 13x9x2" pan - had enough to go with 5 chicken breasts!  Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out perfectly!  I made it for a date and she was very impressed.  The only change I made was to use Mexican blend instead of whatever cheese the recipe called for.

I made this with penne pasta, added a handful of sliced mushrooms and some red onion.  I loved the texture but it still lacked something.  I think next time I will try it with a stronger cheese, like a sharp cheddar.  My vegetarian boyfriend loved it!

If I'm going to eat this much fat in one sitting, it better be tasty!!  But since neither spinach nor Monterey Jack cheese has a "strong" flavor, as the recipe contends, I found the meal to be disappointing.  I recommend adding garlic (fried in olive oil until golden) and the mistakenly omitted onion.  Though I didn't try it, mushrooms and fresh tomato would add significantly, too.

I mistakenly used fresh spinach (uncooked) - it was interesting!  I adjusted the covered cooking time by adding 10 minutes to compensate.  Although is was messy to toss, it was fresh & good.  I would also break up the spaghetti pasta next time I make it - and I will make it again!

This was yummy! I added ground turkey breast, because I live with a bunch of carnivores, and used whole grain thin spaghetti, low fat sour cream and mozzarella because that's what I had in the fridge. Delicious! This will be added to my rotation - or some variation;-)

Great recipe!! I made this the first time for our vegitarian friends, it was a big hit! My husband, the meat eater, recommended adding some chicken in with it next time, turned out great! You could also use bacon too, I am sure that would be yummy :)

All I could find was marinated artichokes so I drained and rinsed them for the recipe. Because they were still so salty, I didn't add any salt. Will definately make this again.

My husband, 16 month old son and I all loved this!  I made a few modifications - I broke the spaghetti into thirds before cooking which made it more manageable.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I didn't have the onion called for, so added fried onions (the dried kind from an Indian grocery.  This really added a zip!  I also substituted and Italian blend of cheeses for the Monterrey Jack.  The flavor was awesome!  I will definitely used the fried onions next time as well and perhaps add in a few more artichokes since we love them so much.  This is surely a keeper!

I'm trying to get my 16-month old twins to eat more veggies.  I made this recipe last night and they were devouring it!  the changes I made:  I used fresh spinach (I don't like cooked spinach, myself), pepper jack and cheddar cheese and I used whole grain noodles.  YUMMY!  I'll be making this again but beware; it's very filling!

This was ok.  I used fresh spinach that I steamed and chopped, and didnt have any artichoke hearts so I left that out.  Kind of bland and if I were to make it again I might tinker with it a little bit.  Seemed to have some possibilities, but didnt really excite me.

1.  I am not sure where the prep time of 10 mins came from, but it takes longer than that just to shred the cheese.

2.  I love Spinach and Artichoke Dip, but where is the flavor in this recipe?  All I could taste was spinach and nothing else. 

I would not waste my time making this recipe again - it was an hour of time wasted.  Not recommended.

Definitely cheesy!!  Really liked it.  Great for getting the kids to eat spinach.  Any pasta will do I used bowtie.

YUM-MY!!! The flavours were wonderful. However I did add some pasta sauce, and without it I probably would have given this four stars. It just needed a bit of tang, and the sauce did it. The basis of the casserole was great, though. I love spinach and cheese, and I would definitely make this again.

I liked this dish. I like the mixture of cheese and spinach. I made it with the artichoke hearts because I never had them and thought I'd see what they taste like. Needless to say, I didn't much care for the artichoke hearts. But to each his own. I would make this dish again minus the artichoke hearts.

I really liked this. It's spinach artichoke dip pasta - what's not to love? For those that said it was bland, the recipe says to season to taste, so is it the recipe's fault that you didn't?

This was tasty... good base recipe to add other items as well. I used a different pasta shape and greek yogurt instead  of sour cream. Next time I made this I think I will add ground turkey to make a one dish meal

I have made this many times,I really enjoy it and it's great as leftovers. I took another reviewers suggestion and broke up the spaghetti and I buy the artichokes in the jar with oil little seasoning I wash them off and slice them up, I usually just use whatever cheese I have around this is a keeper for me

This is a great casserole... I used fresh spinach, which makes the prep time a wee bit longer.  But once out of the oven, it was worth it.

This was yummy!  I added more artichokes because we like them so much, and we ate it for supper and lunch the next day!

When I saw this recipe I thought oh gross.  That was because of the spahetti.  What a shock.  It was truly delicious.  I can't wait to make it again.  My daughter and mother had some and they raved about it.
