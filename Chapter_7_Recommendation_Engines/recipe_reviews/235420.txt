I have made this many, many times and eaten brisket many more times. I can say, without reservation, that you should only cook brisket to the well done state. Brisket that is medium rare or anything less than well done, is impossible to chew.

This recipe seems to call for 6 lbs of meat, for 5 servings?  Or maybe a 2-3 lb brisket?  Obviously the amount will greatly affect cooking time.  I used a 1.75 lb brisket, and did not alter amounts of the other 2 ingredients (figured I could use leftover jus to make French Onion Soup).  Knowing it would be less cooking time than suggested, I cooked for 4 hours and the meat was well done.  I wish I had stopped at 3 hrs, when I had checked the temp and it was 142, between medium rare and medium. I also topped each sandwich with provolone (sharp, fresh-sliced). Hubs went nuts for this dish, and asked to put it in our rotation.  Next time I'll plan on cooking for 2.5-2.75 hrs to get it to medium rare only.  Good recipe - thanks!

I love this recipe and have made it several times with a variety of brisket weights. It turns out great every time and guests love it! I like to toast the bread slightly, apply the meat, top with provolone, and then broil in the toaster oven until cheese is melted. I just throw it in the crockpot before I leave for work, come home, scape off any fat that I can, and then use two forks to shred the meat.

This is a great meal to please the man in your life!  Hubby loved it, and it couldn't get any easier than throwing 3 things in a crock pot.  I do suggest spooning off as much grease as you can from the sauce before serving.  We used a home made onion soup mix which worked great, and smelled delicious while it was cooking!  Served on whole wheat rolls this is an epic manly dinner!

I've been making this for a many years.  The only thing different that I do I add a splash of Worcestershire sauce it brings more beef flavor to your Au jus  sauce . But is so very good.  It would be great to serve at a party.  And I would serve with crusty  rolls.

Could you cook it on high for say 3 or 4 hours if you don't have as much time?

Had to use chuck roast since I couldn't find brisket that didn't already have corned beef seasonings on it. Made some extra au jus just in case since our family really like the dipping part. Added some Worcestershire as one reviewer said and just made a positive additon. Wonderful.

This recipe does not taste like my original idea of fresh oven roasted beef sliced thin, but it was delicious. And the flavor held up well for another go around for leftovers the following night. This would not be the case if I had done roasted  beef..it always has a "dead" taste the next day. So, thumbs up!

Wow - this was super simple and a big hit with the men in my life.  The meat was more shredded than "sliceable".

Cooked 3 hrs on high and 4 hours on low since roast was frozen. Way overdone. Would prefer a thicker jus.

I used a 3.5lb brisket & cooked it on high for 3 hours & it was medium well to well done.  The meat didn't have 'a lot' of flavor, but of course one you dipped it into the au jus, it was delish!  Really easy & soooo tasty on a tasty telera roll.  My husband loved it & kids did too - even the super picky 5 year old.
