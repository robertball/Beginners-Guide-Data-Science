I used in a bread machine (for a 2 pound loaf) by following the general directions: ie: wet ingredients first, dry ingredients next and yeast lastly. result was excellent. One suggestion  to make is after the dough has kneaded in the machine, cut off about 100 ml. of dough for the 2 pound machine to ensure it doesn't rise past the lid and adversely affect the baking of the centre top. The bread was moist, flavourful and texture was great. I like this recipe even better than regular raisin bread as it was more moist and flavourful.

I'll be honest, I'm not sure exactly what the carrots added. Maybe a little extra sweetness from the natural sugars?... At any rate, the bread is lovely. I only gave it the one rise as a whole lump of dough before separating it into the loaf tins, and it worked fine. I also substituted 3 cups of whole wheat flour for the white. Lovely fragrant bread was the result, with great texture. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone as it is easy to make and produces excellent results. One thing... the instructions skip the step where you add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients! Not that hard to figure out, but just a wee glitch I noticed.

Great bread! This was a real crowd pleaser and have made it many times since finding the recipe.  No changes. No substitutions.  It's terrific but best as toast.  Thanks and enjoy!

I made half of this recipe, and I made one 8x4 loaf and 3 mini loaves. They turned out great. I think it helped that I added extra spices to this--about 1/4 t. extra cloves and nutmeg too. I also added 2 T. gluten because I made this with half whole wheat flour. I squeezed the excess water out of my carrots because I worried that the extra moisture might throw the wet/dry balance off. I don't know whether it would have or not, but the bread turned out plenty moist and really tasty.

I used half whole wheat flour.  This recipe makes a good product, but I didn't find the flavor much different than bread with raisins in it.  I will use this as a basic recipe and adjust spices/flavors.

I would recommend an egg wash on the loves to give them a nice shine.  Mine also made 12 large rolls and a full loaf. Yum.

A little unique but VERY GOOD!! I love it. The carrotts and raisins add to the moist texture. A wonderful toast bread. I wonder if I couldn't have squeezed three loaves out of the dough as was a lot of dough there. Made 2 very nice ones. Thanks for the recipe!

Great! Our humidity + locale tend to rise breads higher - we decreased yeast by 1/8-1/4 tsp for perfect results. Just as great that slightest bit "heartier".

I feel pretty bad rating a recipe so low when others have rated it so high, but it really wsn't very good. The recipe has good potential, but no flavor as written. I added chopped figs and walnuts instead of raisins, and that was probably the only thing that saved this from going in the trash can. You can barely taste the spices and it definitely needs more sugar. Also CUT THE RECIPE IN HALF! I cut it in half and it still made a monster loaf. But thanks for the idea, I'll continue to toy with this one. :-)

The flavor of this bread is fantastic... And the recipe is quite forgiving! Ok maybe I'm getting quite good at bread disaster management. I ambitiously threw this together while cooking dinner and realized while it was "rising" that I had forgotten the yeast!! I read some blogs and I'm definitely not the only one who has done this. I added instant yeast to the dough and kneaded it in thoroughly. It did rise, though unevenly at first, so I decided to give it a long slow rise in the fridge for a few days. My silly yeast-less fiasco had prevented me from being able to finish that night anyway. I chopped the dough into about 15 rolls and let them rise an hour in my oven's proof cycle then baked. They are actually fantastic, lightly sweet and extremely flavorful with a dark crisp crust and moist crumb. When I was throwing the bread together I did plump the raisins in juice for a min in the microwave then dried them a bit. I also added slightly different spices based on what I had. Did I mention that I used almond milk and egg replacer? Thanks for the recipe!

this does make a good bread, although I have to agree with the reviewers who said it isn't full of flavor.  It really isn't, and although it's a nice white bread, there really isnt' much to distinguish it.  Maybe more sugar or seasonings would punch it up a bit.  Still, it was a good bread for Freezer French Toast this morning, so that works for me.  Thanks for the recipe.
