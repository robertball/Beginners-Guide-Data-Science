I found this salad dressing to be good but not quite there.I suggest adding to the dressing 1 tbs honey, 1 tsp rind less orange marmalade and 1 tsp Dijon mustard.
This is a fantastic salad to accompany any seafood grilled, fried or bbq.

Very good!  I added a heaping TBSP. of honey to the dressing and it was perfect, light and refreshing!  Toss in some sunflower seeds  and you are good to go!  I will be having it again tonight and will be adding some feta and some dried berries!  YUMMY!

This is sooo good (I'm eating some now while I type this). I added a couple drops of Tabasco to the dressing - otherwise made it as written. Thanks!

The salad combination was nice, though I like more ingredients in my salads for variety in each bite.  I used nectarines instead of oranges, and the additions of feta cheese and avocados rounded out the flavor. The dressing was far too sour (which I should've suspected when I saw that there was a 1/4 c of lemon juice with no type of sweetener); about 2 T of sugar mellowed out the tang without being overly sweet.

That was the most amazing dressing I've ever had, let alone made!!!  I had fresh peaches, so used them instead of oranges, and it was so delicious.  I also toasted some pecans.  This dressing will be a staple in our house from now on!

i really enjoyed this.  i just happened to have a bag of spinach and a huge excess of navel oranges.  i really really liked how simple it was, but delicious and fresh. i will use this dressing from now on for any salad.

This recipe's dressing was really light and special - not overpowering like many of the balsamic/wine vinegar recipes. I didn't use radishes because I don't like them and instead of using nuts (like some of the reviews mentioned ) and for the color factor I used all sorts of sprouts (cabbage, onion, alfalfa, mung bean)it looked beautiful and tasted delicious!

the mung bean gave a great nutty flavor to the salad - and I was too lazy to rinse the spinach from sand - so I used regular iceberg lettuce (just as good, the mung bean provided the nutty flavor that I lacked from not using the spinach)

This recipe was great... the fresh fruit made all the difference. Also, to contrast some of the citrus flavoring I used some feta cheese with the recipe and it was a wonderful combination. I also made it with some crutons that I made from some left over ciabatta bread and it was great.

Excellent salad.  I served it tonight at a July 4th BBQ and everyone that ate it commented on how good it was.  When I told them the ingredients, one guest told me he hated blue cheese but didn't taste it.  I don't know how he missed it, but the overall combination of flavors was yummy.

This rating is for the dressing only. It's only ok, and a little sub-par ok at that. I think it would benefit strongly from the addition of sugar and vinegar, which I will surely be adding to the leftovers tomorrow so that we'll be excited to finish this batch. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this salad!!  I can't get enough of it.  I tweak it a bit based on some of the other reviews.  I add about 1 Tb of honey to the dressing.  I also use just fresh spinach, use mandarin oranges instead of regular, and I add toasted walnuts and feta cheese.  I also use a whole avacado.  Today I didn't have any radishes, so instead I added chopped kohlrabi.  Great salad and dressing.  Thanks for sharing!!

I took this to a Bible Study and everyone liked it. I adjusted it a little based on what was in my kitchen but the dressing I did exactly the same and it turned out great.

I found this recipe and decided that we would use it for prom so I did a trial run at home. I liked it alot but I am not sure how well I liked the oil in it. I did add some things: avocado, slivered almonds, feta cheese, and honey and I thought it was amazing. So easy!!

I didn't find this salad that great at all. The dressing needs something, I was expecting more from this salad.
