I am a Bengali woman and we are famous for our Rusgullahs. It is my favorite desert ever.  One thing you can do is instead of using lime juice you can use 2-3 tablespoons  white vinegar to create milk solids and that way you wont have to worry about rinsing the milk solids. And also you don't really have to make the simple syrup in a pressure cooker. You can actually make it in a large pot. 
But either way it will be an awesome authentic Rusgullahs.

A fine dessert for an Indian meal. I made 3 different syrups for 1 batch of rasgullas: Cardamom (per recipe), Rose, & Saffron.  Exotic, heavenly!

I made these yesterday. They were surprisingly easy and the taste was interesting. They weren't bad but I probably won't make them again (although the two women from India that I work with really seemed to enjoy them). It was a bit like eating vanilla flavored squeaky cheese.
