I used this recipe to make my very first Thanksgiving turkey this year. It turned out super tender and was a HUGE hit! The 14 lb turkey was literally picked clean by the end of the night! 

I followed the recipe for the most part but made a few small changes. I made the overnight brine as suggested but replaced the water with chicken broth. The next morning I prepared the turkey for the oven per the recipe but added more seasonings. I added onion and garlic powder, seasoning salt, rosemary, pepper, and sage to the olive oil mixture for even more flavor. I also placed pats of butter on and under the skin of the turkey prior to roasting.  I removed the foil tent from the turkey 45 minutes prior to the end of cooking time (which was 4.5 hours). This was a very easy recipe and well received by all. You won't be disappointed!

I made the brining liquid for the turkey and it was OK--can't say that it added any taste to the bird, but the turkey was nice & moist.  
I did find that the unstuffed 16lbs  turkey was cooked in 2.5 hrs, rather than 3.5-4.5 hrs @ 325º.   I pulled the turkey out at 160º (though really wanted to pull it out at 155º) and because it was done so early, I let it rest for over 2 hrs.  Still very hot when we finally cut into it, so don't think you have to time it so perfectly.  The turkey was very moist and cooked through.

Very simple and easy to make. Flavor was delicious and meat very moist. I roasted in the Big Green Egg with soaked Apple wood chips for smoke and it turn out perfect. I've used other brines in the past that required more preparation and to be honest didn't give any better results. My wife said this by far was the best brine and roast I had done, so happy wife, happy life!

Ive made this brine for my fresh Turkey for the past 3 or 4 years.  I will never make a Turkey any other way.  It's the juiciest Turkey I've ever made. I don't t change the recipe at all except to add rosemary and  sage. Thanks so much for posting this recipe and this year will post a picture of my bird!!

Hands down, this is the best turkey I have ever had! I was intimidated by the brining process and, frankly, the turkey baking process, but this one was a piece of cake. I didn't have a large enough container for the fridge, so I used my large ice cooler overnight. I slightly decreased the amount of water in exchange for a 3 lb bag of ice (some ice I put in a zip lock so it wouldn't dilute too much).

I tried it on two turkey breasts at half the recipe and man was it delicious.  We're looking forward to trying it on the whole turkey this Thanksgiving!

Wow! This turkey was the best yet. The bring was so easy. I had it in the brine for about 24 hours. Didn't change a thing. Very moist and delicious. Will definitely make again. Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

This is the only way I will ever make a Turkey. I received so many compliments from people who never give them, in fact they're critical! This was so juicy, I was blown away at how easy and delicious. Thank you for saving Thanksgiving.

The first time I ever brine anything and the poultry did come out very juicy. I brine four chicken breast with bone therefore scaled down the ingredient by a quarter. I added some garlic salt and rosemary to olive oil mixture.

This is by far the best Turkey we have ever had! It made our Christmas Dinner amazing. It was juicy and tender, not too salty and just a tad sweet. I can guarantee this will make it to our table for every Christmas from here on out!

This is a great method.  The apple juice and sugar will lead to an overly browned skin - use an aluminium foil tent to prevent over browning.  Use a good thermometer to judge doneness - the internal temp should be at least 165 in the thickest part of the thigh.    Very good indeed!  
Thanks!

This was delicious. But I could not find a big enough, food grade, container for the turkey. Note to self; turkey roasting bags.....not a good idea for it! Lol. Probably would've been amazing if I could've properly soaked it.

I followed the I instructions, however I made some changes on the spices and the amounts of these, it turned out "ridiculously" savory and moist, my first time to cook a turkey and it was a total hit, amongst the other thanksgiving expert cooks. So very pleased with it, thanks for sharing this recipe !

This turkey was delicious!  I added some black peppercorns, bay leaves and garlic to the brine.  After brining, I rinsed my turkey and soaked in fresh water for about 15 minutes to eliminate saltiness.  Used herbed butter under the skin.  It was so juicy which I attribute to the brining process!

I put onions, carrots and garlic in the roasting pan with dark beer.  Everything was delicious.  Never brined before and it was a game-changer.

Best of all the brines! I have used this brine for 4 years now and absolutely love it. Instead of stuffing the turkey, I put 2 peeled and cored Granny Smith apples and 1 quartered sweet onion in the cavity. Great brine, Lauren. Thank you.

I will absolutely make it again.  I just made an 8 lb. turkey breast.  The only thing that was different is that I basted it with a beer.  It was the most tender and moist that I’ve ever had!
