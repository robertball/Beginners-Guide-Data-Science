When Bush the First declared he hated broccoli, it was obvious Barbara had never whipped up an Easy Broccoli Quiche for the old boy.  This is a good recipe which turns out just how I like my quiche--fast, cheap and tasty.

As for the "wetness" and "wateriness" issue raised by some other reviewers: Ladies, ladies, ladies!  This problem is easily solved.  First, repeat after me:  "I will not purchase frozen broccoli.  I will not purchase frozen broccoli.  I will not purchase frozen broccoli."  Your turn.  Good, thanks. 
 Secondly, do not SPRINKLE in the cheese, put it in first and PRESS it to the bottom of the pie crust, forming a sort raincoat for the crust--a cheese raincoat, if you will.  If you feel silly for not thinking of this yourself, do not despair.  I consider myself somewhat of a wetness expert, for two reasons. First, I reside in the Pacific Northwest, where, when it isn't drizzling, sprinkling or spitting, it's most likely raining, pouring or (on rare occasions) hailing.  As for the second reason I consider myself a wetness expert...I live with a two-year-old.  'Nuff said.

Most people who gave this recipe a high rating did so with significant changes.  The recipe as written has many flaws.  Even though I used fresh broccoli, mine came out soggy.  One onion is too over powering -- 1/2 an onion is plenty.  Plus, 30 minutes was much too short.  I needed to bake it for 50 minutes for the middle to set and for the crust to get flaky.  The "Quiche" recipe on this site does not have any of these problems and can be modified to add broccoli.  I will not be making this again.

Thank you!!!  This recipe is excellent!  I have made it twice in the 2 weeks I had the recipe.  My husband and I love it!  I changed the recipe to our taste.  I crisped 4 slices of bacon first.  I used 2 1/4 cups of fresh broccoli, 3/4 of a onion minced (whole onion I thought was too much), 1 bell pepper thinly sliced, 3/4 cup of mozzarella cheese, 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of evap milk, 3 eggs (I don't like eggy quiche), 2 tbls of butter, 1 garlic clove minced, 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese to spread at bottom of crust, 1 homemade pie crust (Stephanie's basic flaky crust at allrecipes).  I followed one of the reviews about cutting down the milk and eggs and also adding the bacon, bell pepper and cheddar cheese.  This made it fantastic!  I also followed one of the reviews and mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl and I sprinkled 1/4 cup of cheedar cheese at the bottom of crust, poured in the contents and let sit in the oven until it set.  If you are not using fresh veges or homemade pie crust you are missing out on the best tasting quiche you have ever had.  Next time I am going to try using other things like, spinach, chicken, etc.  Thanks again.  Be Blessed

Excellent! However, I the result was no longer vegetarian for us as I made a few changes. First, in addition to the 2c broccoli, I added 1/2c fresh sliced mushrooms and 1/2c chopped green bell pepper and sauted them with the onions and garlic in a little butter. I also added 1/2c diced ham. I upped the eggs to 5 and reduced the milk WAY down to 1/2c. Once the eggs and milk were mixed, I added all veggies and ham and poured into the pie crust. I had to bake for apprx 45-50min and the quiche was set but I had no sogginess as a few others had previously mentioned. With a side of hashbrowns, this made for one heck-ova breakfast! Until now, I thought the only person who could make the perfect quiche was my mom....well mom, with this recipe experience...I'm gaining on you! :) Thanks Sara!

I served this at a ladies' luncheon and it was a huge hit!  I subbed in frozen chopped broccoli, thawed and drained, to make the preparation quicker.

I made this recipe per the direction of previous reviewers, and that's what my rating is for, not the original recipe here.  I used 3 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, 1 cup broccoli, 1/2 of an onion, and sharp white cheddar.  Mixed all ingredients together before putting in pie crust.  Cooked for about 45 minutes, until cheese turned golden brown on top.  This was delicious and easy.

Ok this recipe as I made it tasted amazing...so many compliments at our bridal party brunch...however the methods of cooking need to be overhauled. This actually makes 2 quiches. I took two packages of chopped frozen broccoli and microwaved until completely thawed. I added almost 1 onion (smallish so not to overpower) chopped and the butter to a skillet and cooked the onion through. Then I added the broccoli and the garlic. I unrolled both pie crusts in a pack and sprinkled a quarter of a package of shredded cheese over the bottom. Then I added half the broccoli to the pan and covered it with another quarter of the cheese. I beat 2 eggs with 3/4 cup milk and a tad more butter and poured that over the mixture. I tried to season everything with salt, peper and any other herbs I felt appropriate when I was cooking the broccoli. I did the same in the second pan with the other half of the ingredients. I baked for about 30 min but check often because all ovens are different. Was not too much for the pan as some suggested nor was it too wet. I used disposable round cake pans that are a little deeper. If you want to pre bake the crust a couple minutes so to avoid a gooeier crust that may be a good idea. I have no idea how someone could make it the other way it would have been too difficult. Will make many many more times.

Absolutely delicious. I actually didn't have a pie pan, but I wanted to try this pretty badly so I used a 9x9 inch (square) pan, made a pie crust recipe on the site (Stephanie's basic flaky crust), rolled it flat and pressed it into the bottom and sides of the pan. After that I followed the review tips and pressed the cheese on top of the crust before adding the veggies, added a diced red pepper and cut the milk to 1 1/4 cups. Since the 9x9 pan is deeper it took about 50 minutes rather than 30, but there was more than enough filling to fill it, and it was without a doubt the best quiche I have ever tasted... and I've tasted many. Will definately keep this recipe and use it often!

Very good, my husband loved it!! I cut the milk down to 1 cup and used a 9 inch cake pan instead of a pie plate which was perfect. Instead of putting the broccoli in the bottom, I added it into the egg mixture along with 2 1/4 inch slices of chopped up Blackforest ham and I substituted 2 small green onions for the 1 regular onion. I sprinkled half of the cheese in the bottom of the pie crust and stirred the rest into the liquids. I did not find it too wet at all, in fact I found it was very easy to slice and serve. The baking time had to be extended to 45 minutes in my oven.

tastes really good. I brought this to a potluck and I got a lot of positive feedback. I suggest using less onion, less egg-milk mixture, more broccoli and more cheese. Half of an onion should do it and if you use the exact amount of milk in the egg-milk mix, it will start leaking out of the pie tin/crust once it's in the oven, unless you are using a very deep-dish one. I actually put in about 2 1/2-3 cups of broccoli, instead of just 2. Also, add 1/4 cup more cheese.

This is super easy! I baked it in a Casserole dish since I am on a low carb diet.  I recommend using a small onion (about the size of a Tangerine. I added crumbled Applewood Bacon and omitted the melted butter.   I also want to add that Quiche should not be eaten hot! It should be served at room temperature or slightly warm.

This is an easy quiche that's OK, but not something you will wow your dinner guests with.  Here are the changes I made to the directions after reading other people's feedback:  Put the cheese at the bottom of the pie pan (protects the bottom from becoming soggy), use 5 eggs and only one cup of milk, add chopped ham.  Use fresh broccoli only (the frozen stuff holds too much water).  Bake for 45 minutes.

I made this quiche tonight after reading a lot of the reviews, and with some adjustments it turned out great.  My husband was skeptical at first, but after he took his first bite he loved it.  As other reviewers suggested I made these adjustments:  used store bought roll out dough for crust, pressed cheese layer into crust, pre-baked crust for a few minutes before adding filling, used a little less than 1 cup of milk, used an extra egg, omitted the butter and used olive oil, added a cup of chopped mushrooms, used a mixture of half cheddar and half mozzerella cheese, and only used 1/3 of the onion.  I actually had enough filling to make 2 quiches; I made one tonight and put the other in the freezer for another night.    Next time I think I will add some diced ham to the mix.

This recipe is not very good as written. If it had said to use aa deepdish pie crust and only half the milk then it might have been good. Since it did not, I ended up with way too much liquid and it bubbled over during baking.

Too wet and the appearance scared off the guests.  There was nothing I could do to even "make" it look good.  I've read the hype/reviews and understand the dry/wet ingredient factor but when it comes down to it, this is not a well directed recipe.  It had potential.  Like many others, lol.  I am a Quiche gal but can't seem to remember my measurements, relying on this site to get me through.  This one didn't do it for me.  Sorry.

Pretty flexible recipe with regards to veggies and cheeses.  Cheeses: 1 cup of cheddar cheese + 1 cup of mozzarella. Veggies: 1 cup of broccoli florets (fresh) and 1 cup of chopped fresh baby spinach. I baked the pie crust on 375 with a layer of cheese on the bottom for 7-9 min first, then added sautéed vegetables (salt, pepper, garlic), + 4 eggs mixed with 1/2 cup of milk. Bake for 45 min. Couldn't believe it came out perfect, considering it was my first time every making this or anything using pie crust!

Yum! I knew I liked quiche, but I didn't know I loved it!  I kept everything the same except I used half Mozzarella cheese, and half cheddar.  (I think cheddar just tastes better with eggs!)  I even packed a slice of this for my lunch at work!

Great recipe! I changed the recipe since I have a high cholesterol rating. I used liquid(no fat/no chol) eggs,  skim mozzarella and lowfat milk. It still came out great! I can once again enjoy quiche!

This is a super quick and yummy recipe but can be easily amended to meet your veggie tastes. I pressed cheddar and monteray jack cheese into the pie crust. I used only 3 eggs and 1 cup milk.  I sauteed garlic, onion, broccoli, a few mushrooms and bell pepper in butter and olive oil and then mixed the vegetables in with the milk/egg mixture before pouring the mixture into the pie pan.  I then sprinkled a bit of cheese on top and baked in the oven.

This quiche looked great but just tasted OK. Didn't enjoy the broccoli in it as much as I thought I would. Next time I'll use spinach instead. Just a personal preference I guess. 3 eggs and 1 cup milk worked fine.  Added some cooked bacon and sausage and only used 1/2 of an onion. Be sure to chop up broccoli in small pieces and cook well. Broccoli doesn't cook much more in the oven. I prebaked my pie shell (450' for 7 min.) and the crust came out perfect - not gummy on the bottom. The mozzarella cheese was a bit chewy and I even used some cheddar with it. Next time I'll use swiss/cheddar. Used very little salt because of the meat I put in but 1 teaspoon of salt seems like a lot. Recipe doesn't need the last tablespoon of butter. If you really love broccoli this one may be for you.

If I could give it less, I would! I was very wary of the 1 1/2 cups of milk. I should have listened to my gut. This was no quiche...it was soup with a thin egg layer on top! I baked it for over an hour, until my crust began to burn, and it never set. Disappointing!!!

Great Quiche!  The only thing I did different was saute onion, garlic and broccoli without the butter and I added 2 tbsp of flour to the egg mixture.  It came out in the right consistancy...delicious!

This turned out great after following some of the reviews. I used fresh broccoli, added fresh mushrooms and red bell pepper, used a combo of mozzarella and sharp cheddar, 3 eggs, a cup of half & half, lots of fresh cracked black pepper and the recipe for Flaky Butter Pie Crust (on this site) in an 8x8 deep dish... I think it took about 40 minutes to set, and was absolutely delicious! A tad eggy... could have been a bit more custardy, but that's easily rectified! LOVE this recipe, with the crust! Thanks!

This recipe is on the verge of greatness!!! To make it great I would change two minor things. First off, I generally use a 3/1 ratio of eggs to cream. This has always worked for me and I find no reason to change it. Second is more of a tip. Always put the cheese on the bottom of the crust before you pile in your fixins. This will keep the crust from becoming soggy and falling apart. I learned this last one the hard way. I also would skip using the additional melted butter simply because it really doesn't need it. But that's just my taste. Other than that this recipe is a winner. I always go to it for a good basic quiche.

I've used this receipe for a few years now, and am just now taking the time to post my feedback. The fact that I've used it for years should speak for itself, however here is my two cents: 

It's easy and delicious!! It bugs me when people write they loved the recipe, then say they changed everything about it. However, I have to admit to making some adjustments myself: I never use frozen broccoli, I always slightly steam the broccoli then add it to the pan to sautee. The only other adjustment I've made is to use different kinds of cheese; usually a 4-chese blend from the store. And, I have to say - it's never been ready in 30 min, always takes at least 45min. 

Other than that, this is a terrific recipe! It's in the oven right now for a potluck at work tomorrow, and I know it will be a hit!

This was really good.  The broccoli was enough to fill two pie shells.  I used only about half the onion and added a small can of mushrooms.  I also used sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella.  I pressed some into the bottom of the pie shell before baking, as others have suggested.  Because there was so much broccoli, I prepared two batches of batter.  I made one pie and 6 mega muffins without crust.  I used 3/4 cup milk in each batch.  The pie baked for about an hour at 400 degrees, and was not runny at all.  The muffins baked for about 30 minutes at 400 in a silicon pan and came out great.  I highly recommend making this as muffins for a great and easy breakfast or portable lunch.  It's slightly bland, though, which is why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.

Wow, used the advice to press cheese into the crust to create an moisture barrier and save the bottom crust. This was my first successful quiche! Love it!

By far the best quiche recipe I've made, and it's a definite keeper! The biggest change I made was making it without a crust.  Just be sure to grease your baking dish first (I use a canola oil spray).  For the filling, I suggest using fresh broccoli only; the frozen kind adds too much moisture.  I also double the recipe (but only 2 1/2 cups of milk instead of 3), as this quiche heats up very well the next day or two.  Be sure to adjust your baking time accordingly; doubling the recipe adds about 10-12 minutes to the baking time.  Sometimes I use different cheeses--like Mexican blend, etc.--for variety, and it always works well.  I've also made it with diced Canadian bacon, and it was great!  I highly recommend this recipe!

5 stars if it's made with a few changes. I took advice of others...fresh broccoli, 3/4 cups milk, 5 eggs and half an onion. I also used a 2 cup bag of cheese since I used 2 pies (not deep dish) Made 2 easily and wasn't runny at all...GREAT taste. Even my hard to please husband loved it! Cooked it about 50 minutes. Will be making again.

I would love Sal to show me how he can fit 4 eggs and 1 1/2 cups milk together with2 cups of broccoli in a 9 inch pan! I usually don't follow the recipes exact but decided to do so this time, and what a mistake! I have enough liquid for 3 quiches! The onion should be reduced, the broccoli should be probably 1 1/2 cups and either don't use milk or use max of 1/2 cup.

We LOVE this recipe but have one problem with it: too much batter! We use 2 standard frozen pie crusts and had enough batter to make a third quiche. After making that mistake twice we half the amount of milk, eggs, and butter. I've tried this with other cheeses as well and the original mozzarella is by far the best.

Very light and nice. Like other reviewers I decreased the milk (I used evaporated milk for a fluffier quiche) to 3/4 C. I also used sharp Cheddar and added a dash of Nutmeg. I also topped with sliced fresh tomato and baked it at 400 degrees for 30 mins. Will most certainly make again.

This was wonderful, but I made some changes. I made my own pie crust (don't be intimidated - there are some really easy, really yummy crust recipes out there) and put a mixture of mozzarella and cheddar cheese on the bottom so that the crust wouldn't get soggy. I cooked a couple of pieces of bacon, then threw the veggies in with it instead of using butter. I also added mushrooms. I only used 3 eggs and about a cup of milk. If I had used 4, I think it would not have fit in the pie crust. I topped the whole thing with a small sprinkle of cheddar and it was incredible! Even my picky sister loved it.

Following the advice of many other reviewers, I cut the filling to half an onion, a heaping cup of broccoli, 3 eggs, and 3/4 cups milk. I also substituted cheddar cheese in place of half the mozzerella. The quiche cut cooked perfectly in 45 minutes, cut easily, and tasted delicious. My husband and daughter finished their first piece in record time and went back for seconds. We will definitely make this recipe again.

I agree with previous cooks...this is a good idea but the specifics of the recipes are off...I used a frozen deep dish pie crust and still had problems with egg/milk mixture pouring over (and yes i poured it really slow)...Here is how i made it work: First-use a really small onion or 1/2 of a larger one, used shredded cheddar instead of mozzarella and use only 3 eggs and 1 cup milk, I also added mushrooms and a little extra seasoning (like garlic salt in addition to regular garlic)...After all these changes my meat eating husband declared it a winner!

I've made this twice. Delicious both times, and very simple. It takes mine an hour to bake, so I put foil over the top during the second half to prevent burning. I also press a layer of cheese in the bottom of the crust before adding everything else to prevent sogginess. Works great.

This quiche is WONDERFUL! I used one of the suggestions and chopped the broccoli in small pieces, and all I had was 2% milk and so I added about 1/4 cup of heavy cream to the milk to make 1cup.  It was perfect. I also used Marie Callendars pie crusts.  I can't wait to make this recipe again.

It was very, very yummy. I am a huge quiche fan to begin with so that tells you I know a good quiche when I have one. I used cheddar cheese in mine. I also sauteed my broccoli first in a little evoo, salt, pepper, crushed garlic, fresh diced tomatoes, and portabello mushrooms from a can. One day I'd like to try and make my own crust for it.

Wonderful!  Used hand mixer to get eggs and milk really fluffy.  Mixed spinach, asparagus, onion and cheese into egg and then poured into crust.  Topped with sliced tomato.  Beating the eggs made a huge difference in how fluffy the quiche turned out.  Will definitely make again with many different veggie combos.

The measurements for this recipe are WAY off.  The liquid ingredients did NOT fit in the pastry shell, made a huge mess and took much longer to cook than the directions stated.  Don't watse your time on this recipe.

This was a really good quiche.  I omitted the crust and the whole mixture fit in a 9 inch pan round dish just fine.  I added bread crumbs to the top of it as suggested on another quiche recipe.  It gave it a nice touch.  Thanks for the recipe.

We were really pleased with this quiche.  We were needing a quick dinner for company and had all the items on hand.  We have been avoiding cow's milk so we subsituted "Silk" soy milk for the cow's milk.  We made 1-1/2 times the egg and milk mixture and made two pies using the 9" deep dish frozen pie crusts.  We still had some mixture left over, but not much.  We weren't real careful when measuring the broccoli, as it is a matter of taste.  Also, I had a couple of leftover spicy Italian sausage links that needed to be cooked, so I removed those from their casing, browned that in the pan and added that as the bottom layer on one of the two quiches.  That worked well, as did the regular quiche.
Like many other reviewers, we had to cook this more time, I would say about 50 minutes.  Also, as with all quiche, this is better if you can let it sit for a while to firm up, or if you can serve it the next day.
I think this will be our default quiche recipe going forward.  Do not hesitate to use the soy milk if you are avoiding real milk!

Followed previews reviews and only used 1 c broc., 1/2 onion, 3/4 c. milk, 1/4 t garlic and 3 eggs. It was terrific! It definitely could've used another egg, but it was great.

Delicious lots of compliments on it. Just a tip from Julia Child cook the pie crust till almost done and you won't end up with a soggy bottom. I sometimes keep my quiche for several days and never a soggy bottom. and this pie crust the bottom stayed nice and flaky.

I made this for an event and was told it won best dish of the night!  I did as another reviewer suggested and put the cheese in the bottom of the crust before pouring the egg mixture in.  I also used half mozzarella and half cheddar and made sure to use fresh broccoli, not frozen.  It does need more than 30 minutes. I think I gave it 40.  Wonderful recipe!

Excellent and easy quiche.  I did make changes per other reviews and had no problems with it being soggy.  I used 3 eggs, 3/4 cup of milk and 1/2 onion.  I also baked the crust before adding all the ingredients.  I also had to bake for 45-50 minutes.  With these changes, it turned out great.

This recipe certainly earns its stars for flavor and easiness!  However, the portions are off.  When I made this the first time, I had enough to fill 2 whole 9" pie shells with the egg/milk mixture!  The quantities of onion and broccoli are perfect.  I used only 1 cup of cheese, and it still came out plenty cheesy for me.  The CRUCIAL measurement changes:  *3 eggs instead of 4 and 3/4 cup milk instead of 1 1/2.  This makes a perfectly measured quiche, and it saves on the extra ingredients.  (I would like to note, though, that I wasn't using a 9" deep dish, which isn't what the recipe called for anyway.  If baking a quiche in a deep dish pie shell, the original quantities probably are best.)

I used 1 cup heavy cream instead of 1 1/2 cups milk, and it set after cooking 45 min. I give it 3 stars only because it tasted great, but only 3 because of flaws with the recipe. I used a deep dish pie crust, and I still ended up wasting some of the milk/egg/cheese mixture. I don't know why I didn't read reviews before trying this. Will definitely modify this some more if I make it again.

Yum , I had my girl friends over today and we all loved it. Its a keeper for sure.  Only used
l 1/4 cups milk after reading reviews but I am sure it would have been fine anyway. It's a keeper for sure, thanks for sharing

This recipe was not successful without a few changes. 1 large onion was WAY too overpowering and 1.5 cups of milk made the quiche too wet. The second time I made it I added only 1 cup of milk and used 1 small or 1/2 large onion. It also needed to be baked for about 45 minutes, not 30 as the recipe states. I also decided to use sharp white cheddar instead of mozzarella. With these changes it was delicious! Clearly this is essentially a totally different recipe. That's why I only give it one star based on the actual recipe, which did not turn out well.

Some other people have noted that this recipe has a few flaws and I wish I had taken note, before I made mine. 30 minutes is too short at 350 degrees. I ended up with my oven at 380 for the last 15 minutes and it took a total of about 45 minutes. I also would reduce the milk a bit next time. The flavor is good, but had I known how long it would take to cook through I would have started my dinner earlier.

I agree with many others who review this recipe. It has great potential, but needs a fair bit of tweaking:
less milk 3/4 c is plenty or use 2 pie shells
fresh broccoli not frozen 
1/2 onion
mixture of cheeses - a cheddar adds some bite
I added 1//2 red pepper for visual interest
I added ham on one side (for hubby)
Bake at 425 for 15 min, then 350 1/2
With changes it gets 5 stars :)
Very yummy!

Fabulous - BUT 

NOTE: 50 minutes required to fully set!

Otherwise, easy and delicious, even for a newbie to cooking!

Gone in 48 hours! This was a very easy and quick recipe to make. Perfect as a "base" for using up any left over mushrooms or any vegtables.  I like to add more cheese on top of the egg.

I just whipped this up in a few minutes this morning, and it was so easy and super delicious.  My tweaks (because I can't resist tweaking) were to use white pepper (more finely ground and blends nicely with eggs) instead, and added a little cream to the milk for silkiness.  The recipe does not specify size of onion, and I only had a huge one so I used about a third.  I think 1/4 cup of onion makes sense.  Great way to use up that extra pie crust from the 2-pack ;-)

I thought this was kind of bland and a bit eggy. I would decrease the eggs by one and add a few other veggies like mushrooms or asparagus.

Very easy to make. Changes made...used only 1-1/4 cup of milk, 5-cheese Italian shredded cheese mix, just a dash of salt and pepper, and baked for 40-minutes. Came out perfect and tasted great.

1) Way too much onion; half an onion is plenty.   2) Thaw the crust for at least 10 minutes and prick all over with a fork. Then, bake the crust at 400 for 15 minutes BEFORE adding the filling. If you don't do this second step, your crust will come out raw... yuck!  3) Use whole or 2% milk and FRESH broccoli; this will solve many of the watery-ness problems.  The only reason this recipe gets 1 star (in my opinion) is because the mozzarella was unexpected but complemented the broccoli nicely.

This turned out great...I did have to bake it for 55 minutes before the middle set, but it was definitely worth the wait. I also blind baked the pie crust on 350 for 15 minutes before filling it, and it turned out perfect.

Easy recipe to follow that makes a great quiche.  I made two quiches by increasing the eggs and adding in some turkey bacon (4 slices crumbled) and some crab meat.  Used swiss and shredded cheddar, too, and seasoned with Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.  My husband and son both loved it - what a surprise!

This is one of my favorite quiche recipes because it's so easy and so darn tasty! I get compliments everytime I make it. Even my husband liked it and he's not a quiche fan at all. Oh and it's even tastier when you use the Basic Flaky Pie Crust submitted by Stephanie found on this website - YUM!

This was delicious! I used broccolini instead, added mushrooms, and used a mix of leftover cheddar and swiss cheeses. The only problem I had was that there was way to much of the egg/milk mixture to fill a 9 inch pie shell with so it overflowed all over the baking sheet. Next time i'm going to use two 9 inch pie shells or make a smaller batch of the egg/milk mixture. Other than that problem I really liked this quiche. Thanks!

This turned out really well, but lost a star because 1 1/2 cups of milk was way too much - I ended up having to drain it out of the quiche before I baked it. Probably just one cup would have been right. And it needed about 5 extra minutes of baking time.  Other than that, good.  I recommend it.

I found the proportions of this one to be fine....and it tasted great!  I used Buttermilk...I had to use it up so I figured why not. I also browned 4 slices of bacon and mixed it in with the broccoli before putting it into the pie shell. It's just not quiche to me without bacon!  Pre-baking the shell for 10 minutes made it perfect.

I made this for a light lunch. I used my great pie crust out of the freezer. The quiche turned out great but for me the broccoli was not enough. Next time I will use double amount. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good! Following the advice of other reviewers, I guarded against soggy crust by pressing some cheese into it before adding the broccoli. I used only 3/4 cup milk - had I used more, I would have had too much liquid for my store-bought pie shell. I used skim, and will be sure to have at least 2% around next time; even though the quiche had a good consistency, it had a watery taste... not rich enough.

Like most have said, to fix this, press some cheese in the bottom of the crust, cut the milk down to 1 cup and expect to cook 50 min.  Those things changed, it is good.

My daughter needed a recipe for quiche that would be ready from scratch (shortcrust pastry had to be made yourself too) and on the table in an hour lesson for her food technology class, WOW absolute perfection in her first attempt, all her friends were struggling as they had to blind bake theirs first, this idea of layer the cheese at the bottom is perfect and the crust was cooked perfectly, the recipe really is quick easy tasty and impressive, will definitely be using time and time again!

I made this for my husband and we both loved it, even though I'm not big on quiche normally.  The brocoli is great in it!  I think this recipe would be very easy to adapt.  I used a premade, frozen shell which was the same size as called for, however, it was too small for all the filling, so I had a LOT left over.  I suggest making your shell in a truly deep pie dish if you can.

I enjoyed eating this quiche!  It was very tasty and easy to make.  I did make a few modifications of my own and as recommended by a few of the reviewers: (1) I used 3 cups of chopped broccoli just to finish off what I had in my ref, (2) I used a 3:1 ratio of eggs to milk, because folks said this was the best ratio for quiche, (3) I used a combination of sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheese, because I like cheddar cheese on broccoli, 
(4) I used 2% reduced fat milk and I didn't add the melted butter to cut down some of the fat, (5) I added my favorite spices - 1/4 tsp thyme and a pinch of cayenne pepper, (6) I placed some of the cheese on the bottom of the crust first to minimize a soggy bottom, (7) I baked it for 45 mins, (8) and I sprinkled 1/3 cup parmesan cheese on top after it was done and broiled it until it was  golden brown for a nice crispy crust.  Next time, I will use less onion as it was a little strong, and less salt as the butter and cheeses were salty enough.  Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the reviews I made this using 5 eggs, cut the milk down to 1 1/4 cups, and increased the broccoli to 2 1/2 cups. I also used colby jack cheese since I was out of mozzarella, and pre-baked the crust before adding the quiche filling, for about 10-15 minutes in a 350 F oven. But it baked up beautifully in 50 minutes, and was perfectly set and tasty. All of my children gobbled it up, and my pickiest eater even went back for thirds! A real yummy hit, so delicious, and one I will be making over and over again! Thanks!

Fabulous!  I've made it a few times, experimenting with different cheeses, adding cream once, etc.  It turns out great every time.  Next, I'm going to try different veggies!

All I had was baby swiss, but the quiche still turned out great. I used the tip about pressing the cheese into the bottom of the pie crust, and I didn't have any water problems. It took a good 45-50 minutes at 375. I also added a few crispy strips of bacon.

Very good & easy.  I read the reviews and used 3 eggs + 3/4 c. milk, but it wasn't enough when I poured it in so I added 1 more egg and 1/4 c. more. I also used sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella and baked it for more like 45 minutes.

This is a great quiche -- just make sure ALL of the water is out of the broccoli or else it makes the quiche watery.

Outstanding!!  As others suggessted, I used only 3 eggs, 3/4C milk, and a deep dish frozen crust.  It was superb.  Everyone at our holiday party enjoyed it, even the children.  Thank you!!!!

Fantastic flavor!  I did find it to be somewhat liquidy, so next time I won't use as much milk.  I also added shredded cheddar cheese... yummy!!

Wonderful!  Definatley use a deep dish crust or two regular crusts.  I added a handful of sharp cheddar with the mozzerella.  I would also give the broccoli a rough chop before sauteing.  Increased baking time to 50 minutes.

This had a good flavor, but felt there was too much broccoli and not enough egg...will cut down on the broccoli next time.  Also, this will be enough for 1 deep dish crust or 2 regulars.  Will make this again with some changes.

Great quiche recipe. I don't like when a quiche tastes too eggy and this one is perfect. The only changes that I made were to entirely omit the butter and I used pre-shredded, bagged nacho cheese (which added a nice kick). Oh, and I found I had too much egg mixture so I just filled the crust and tossed the rest. I will definitely make this again.

I thought the quiche was really yummy  :) I also made two pies from the mixtures...and I guess the crust might have been soft in the middle--but that's not even something I even noticed. The only thing I changed was that I added extra mozzarella. The second time I made it, i used spinach and cheddar cheese and combined the egg mixture with the spinach before pouring into the crust---it was YUMMY!!!! Thanks for the recipe-I'll be using it all the time.  :)

This is the first quiche I have ever made and it was great! I used frozen chopped broccoli. It did take 50 minutes to cook. It turned out excellent. My husband even ate it and he doesn't like quiche. I've made this crustless to be gluten free and it turns out well. ALso experimented with adding different veggies which also works.

I made this my own little twist too and scored it on my own creation.
I used:
3 Large Eggs
1 c Milk
1 T Flour
1 Small Onion 
1 1/2 T Salted Butter
2 C Fresh Broccoli 
Shredded, Mild Cheddar Cheese 
Pinch of Salt
Pinch of Pepper
1 Ready Made, Roll Out, Pie Crust 
1 Clear Glass Pie Dish

I sautéed onions and broccoli in butter until the broccoli was tender and onions were a light Carmel color.

I used Pam spray to lightly coat the glass pie dish, rolled out crust and layered with enough cheese to cover bottom of pie crust.

I placed onion and broccoli mixture ontop of cheese.

The remaining ingredients were bet with a fork in a bowl and then gently poured ontop.

I placed it in a 350 degree oven on the third shelf and set my timer to 30 minutes.

I took foil and covered the edges o the pie dish and crust as not to turn too dark, put back in over for additional 15 minutes.

I checked it with a toothpick inserted in the middle to see if it came out clean and dry.

Eggs continue to cook for a bit so I left it to cool for another 20 minutes ontop if the stove.

It's delicious anytime of day!

Enjoy.

This was a simple recipe to make a delicious quiche. The only serious deviation I made from the recipe was an adjustment to the baking time. I noticed that most of the other reviewers mentioned that they increased cooking time as well. This recipe uses a generous amount of milk so longer cooking times are needed to ensure doneness. Some others suggested laying the cheese on the bottom of the pie crust to prevent sogginess. This made for a very creamy result!

Sprinkle cheese into the crust first.  It will melt and create a cheesy force field keeping the crust from getting soggy!

I am giving it this rating because of the choice of ingredients but otherwise needs a lot of modifications - in which case it would be a very different recipe.  Those that rated it high changed it a lot so can't go by that......sorry

Served this Quiche for Easter and it was a hit. Pastry pie crust frozen Marie Calandar better quality suggested.   A few changes 40 min to cook.  2 different quiches 1 with Crab (imitation) filled the bottom of the pan about 6-7 oz,added sauted onions and mushrooms then swiss cheese.  
2nd quiche: Spinach 7 oz fresh saute'd first, saute'd mushrooms 1/4 c & sauted onions topped with Swiss cheese. 3/4 c of heavy cream and 3/4 c of milk. PS also added 1/4tsp of nutmeg. Layered as noted in this recepie.  Enjoy

Well, it is what it is. I thought it was a little bland. Next time I will use sausage, bacon, a little thyme and rosemary and marjoram with a touch of nutmeg. I DID add onion powder, but it didn't help. I used a crust from this site that is the best crust I've ever made in my life. I also added green bell peppers. I will make this again because it is easy and honestly, not bad at all. Also, you can put other stuff in to please your own taste.

Pretty goodd, but not particularly easy commpared to most quiches. The cooking time seemed off to me, and I baked it for 50 minutes for it to be done. It was also quite watery, even after sitting for a while. Thanks!

I doubled the recipe so I could make one pie for me and one for my parents. I accidentally omitted the last tablespoon of butter, plus I doubled the garlic and added 1 1/5 freshly chopped red bell peppers. The results was delicious! I think you could basically put any vegis in this quiche, as long as you have some kind of cheese, garlic and onions. I highly recommend buying the deep-dish unbaked pie shells. Also, and this may be because I added the extra vegis, but I ended up with about 1-1 1/2 cups of extra milk/egg mix (which I used to make vegis scrambled eggs). This is definitely one of my new go-to recipes!

I've made this a few times now and it is a hit! As others mentioned, there is too much milk in the recipe, and that seems to be the way all quiche recipes are written, for whatever reason. As long as you cut back the milk to around 3/4 cup, this will bake perfectly. The proportions on the other ingredients don't really matter then, I have used different pie crusts, and tried different amounts of broccoli, and once omitted the onions. None of that matters as long as you get the milk ratio right and keep it low.

Yum! The only reason I'm giving ita 4 instead of 5 is due to my husband's complaints.  He said it was alright but didn't like how 'oniony' it tasted.  The funny part is that I didn't even use an entire onion, just a teaspoon of minced dried onions. Go figure!?  Anyway, great dish and I will be making this again.

I struggle here - I rarely give 5 stars. This recipe may be a 5. It was very tasty and lived up to its name - easy.  I particularly liked that it had more veggies and less eggs than most quiche recipes.  And to the guy who recommended not using frozen broccoli because it can make it watery.  I say you can use frozen, BUT you must thaw it first and then make sure to pat it dry very well in paper towel before using.  Anyhow, thanks for sharing the recipe, sal! It's a keeper.

Made the recipe as directed, except used monterey jack cheese as it was what we had, pressed the cheese into the crust before adding the filling, and then sprinkled more on top before baking. Even my real men don't eat quiche husband liked it! Very little liquid when cut warm; might try to cut back on the milk a little to dry it a bit.

I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it. (I'm not big on quiche.) I made it with cheddar cheese though, because we were out of mozzarella. The only complaint I have about the recipe is that all the ingredients did not fit in the pan. Once it came to pouring the egg mixture in, I was almost out of space. I filled it to the brim and still left a bit out. It still turned out fine though. I also used frozen broccoli left over from the previous night's meal, and about a quarter of a red onion.

I made this tonight for dinner and I added some ham I had leftover and used cheddar cheese.  I made 2 quiches so I used 8 eggs and 1 1/2 cups whole milk. I feel the problem with this recipe is the cooking temperature is too low to make the crust nice and set the center, I baked at 400 and 30 minutes was fine, let it sit for 5-10 minutes to finish setting up.

I think this may be rather bland just as is.  Here is what I did differently.  I added celery, and red bell pepper for color.  I made a homemade pie crust and pressed it into a 9" springform pan and baked it for 10 minutes.  I also used 4 eggs and 1/4 c of heavy cream.  Everything else was pretty much the same. It's a good base recipe though!

Sorry to burst the five star rating, but I was not impressed with this recipe.  The quiche was good enough; it's the recipe I have a problem with.  I was skeptical when I saw that it took only 30 minutes to cook.  Any quiche that I've ever made took between 45 and 50 minutes.  I will give the author credit in that she *does* say 30 minutes or "until center has set".  And the "center was set" at 45! I think the original cook time should say 45 minutes....especially when you are preparing this as a quick meal, thinking you will be serving it at a certain time.  Another thing to make this easier; use frozen chopped broccoli vs. fresh.  You can always have it in the freezer (same as for the pie crust).  Sorry, but I'll be going back to my original quiche recipe!

Maybe I did something wrong? This was awful. There was far more vegetable mix than would fit in the pie plate so I had to transfer it to a casserole dish. Then it took 2 and a half hours to cook, just to get the egg mixture to a slightly firm consistency, by which time the top was about as golden brown as a lump of coal. I checked and rechecked the recipe and instructions about a thousand times, and it doesn't seem like I missed anything. Complete waste of time.

Great starter recipe - made some changes based on other reviews and made 2 quiches - For each quiche - I used 3 eggs and 1 cup milk, 1/4 c onion, 1 c. chopped fresh broccoli and 1/2 cup cheddar and added 2 strips bacon chopped...Had to bake an hour until the quiche was set. Thanks!

I took the advice of the other folks who reviewed this, made a few changes and it turned out great!  My changes:  3/4 cup milk, 1/4 C onion, 2 TBL chopped red pepper, 2 chopped fresh mushrooms, a dash of thyme.  Also, I did  combine all the ingredients in with the eggs and milk, then poured into the pie pan.   Baking it for 50 minutes was perfect.  I just served it and there isn't a crumb left!  Thanks for the recipe.

Love this recipe but it needs to cook MUCH longer than 30 min.  45-50 min minimum and then let set for 5 min before cutting.  Roasted red pepper is a nice addition as well as changing out the broccoli for asparagus.

I am sorry I did not read the reviews before trying this recipe..   The proportions are way off.... way too much filling for the 9"..  even a very deep dish...  Since I have not read a single person's reviews who have used this recipe as is or without complaint... I would certainly revise it or take it off.

Very good quiche. I added an extra egg and kept the milk the same and it was still too much: not as soggy as I feared, but I think a scant cup would be good with four eggs. I used fresh broccoli and definitely cooked it with the onion in the skillet first: as much as I love cooked broccoli I dislike it raw so that step was important to me, if I were to chance frozen thawed drained broccoli I would just plop it in with onion powder instead of chopped onion. I didn't understand the reasoning behind a little bit of butter in the pan and a melted tbsp in with the egg... just added that tbsp to the broccoli and onion and got a richer saute. I used cheddar cheese (preference) and layered it first in the crust as a reviewer mentioned: I actually got the best bottom crust ever out of a quiche (regardless of the high milk content of this one) so I will definitely layer that way again (Thanks!). I may play with the egg mix in this quiche but I loved the technique for using fresh broccoli: thank you for sharing.

I think this recipe is very good but the egg and milk mixture is off.  I will use 3 eggs and 1 cup of milk next time.  It makes too much.  I use sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella.  After I saute veggies,  I add 1 cup of cheese to mix and stir then fill the pan after pre baking crust for 7 min at 350. I then top with more cheese.  Takes longer than 30 min to cook.  Almost an hour.  Thanks for sharing.  We enjoy it.  I serve with salad.

I have made this recipe about 40 times and it is always delicious!  As to any negative reviews, seems these people are subbing in frozen broccoli.  Don't do it!  Buy fresh, preferably organic, and make the recipe exactly as written.  The only change I ever have to make is to add on some cooking time.  Mine usually takes closer to an hour.  And it does make a lot, so you'll need a deep dish pie pan.  Otherwise, it is perfect!

The flavor wasn't bad, but this recipe definitely needs adjusting. I was fine with the basic ingredients, although not mixing the cheese into the egg mixture means the cheese will sit on top of the quiche and not be incorporated. I like the fact that it only uses four eggs, instead of the six in most other recipes. The biggest issues are with the baking. Either blind-bake the crust, or increase the baking time to 45 or 50 minutes, because 30 minutes is not long enough to fully bake the crust on the bottom. Mine was completely uncooked. I will make this again, but only after I tweak the custard mixture (maybe a big less milk and more cheese) and find out the optimum baking time to get the crust done on the bottom.

Yummers!  The great thing about this recipe is that you can play with it and make it suit your own tastes by adding your own flair.  We like it with ham and whatever kinds of cheese I have on hand.
Makes great leftovers too!

Very Tastey! I DID thaw FROZEN broccoli in the microwave, strain and pushed down to get the water out. WORKED PERFECTLY and took less time to soften while sauteeing with the GRATED 1/2 onion. (the onion flavor melts right into the quiche when grated!)I also added honey maple ham and threw in some fresh basil. I substituted heavy cream for the milk and WOWZERS! THIS QUICHE turned out SLAMMIN! Afew TWEAKS and it can be even better than the original recipe! Marvelous! My taste buds thank you.

The only thing I did different to this recipe is I used cheddar instead of mozarella. Other than that, I made it exactly as it said. The pie crust was way too small for the amount of ingredients the recipe called for. After adding the broccoli and cheese, there was no room for the egg mixture in the pie crust! If I make this again, I will half the ingredients!!!

I cooked the veggies in PAM to cut down on the fat. I used fresh broccoli and tried the "cheese raincoat" suggestion, but it still turned out a little watery. Delicious, though!

This was good but I made some changes.  I used colby jack and extra sharp cheese instead.  I made mine without a crust do to time constraints.  It came out a bit watery  though.  The recipe does not list a pan size but says to use a 9inch crust.  When I poured my batter into a 9inch pan it overflowed and was way too much filling.  Next time I will use a 10inch pan.  Overall this was tasty but needed some alterations.

I really enjoyed this dish. I used 3 eggs, one cup of milk and added button mushrooms finely chopped and chili flakes.
Yum!

My husband couldn't say enough about how good this is.  I followed the other reviewers' recommendations--fresh broccoli and cheese on the crust.  Easy and perfect.

It was my first quiche and it tasted fine except I think 1 tsp of salt was a bit too much. Next time, I'll remove a pinch from the 1 tsp and see what happens.  Thanks for sharing. Nerry

I followed others' suggestions and put a layer of cheese on the crust before pouring the veggies on top.  I also used a mix of shredded cheddar and shredded italian - i only had some of both.  I had just run out of fresh garlic, so I had to use garlic powder, but it still tasted great!  I also used only 1 cup of milk instead of 1 1/2 since some said it was a little runny.  I added some diced ham as well.  This was my first quiche (and pie in general) and I was very happy with the results!  Will definitely be making it again!

Super easy and loved by all (including my "real men don't eat quiche" brother). Used 3 eggs and 1 cup milk, 2 1/2 cups broccoli, sharp cheddar mixed with a three cheese blend, and added 1/2 cup diced turkey ham. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this twice and made changes to improve the second time I made it.  First of all, the cook time should be quite a bit longer....it should bake for about 45 minutes to an hour.  Cook until the top is medium golden brown.  Also, I increased the eggs by one and decreased the cream by 1/2 C.  This helped it not be so liquid-y.  All in all, this is a GREAT recipe and the second time, I used a colby jack cheese which was VERY yummy!  Seems like this recipe is very versatile and good quiche recipes can be hard to find!

This quiche tasted delicious.  My picky 3 year old had seconds and is now asking that we make more!  I agree that a deep dish pie crust is needed.  Also, I had to bake it for 45 min for it to set.  My biggest problem was that it was very soggy.  Taste was great, but I've got to figure out how to dry it out a little!

This is very tasty.  I used a 9-inch, deep pie plate and found that 3 eggs and one cup of milk was plenty.  I also used cheddar cheese and it turned out great!  I do find the baking time off though...my quiche took about 45 minutes to set completely.

Everyone loved this recipe. I added a few strips of bacon and chopped mushrooms. Just like whenever i make quiche my pie crust wasnt deep enough, i will make sure i get a bigger one next time. Also i didnt chop my broccoli as well as i should have. i added an extra little bit of cheese on the top an put it back in the oven for a few minutes. will definatly make this again. Maybe next time i will melt cheese on the vegis before i put them in and use less onion

Great!! made for christmas brunch  2006, everyone raved!  used onion powder instead of raw onion - one guest does not like onions, but the onion powder added great flavor without having to crunch into the onion.  will make again!!!!  very, very easy!!

Delicious! I added two eggs since I noticed other people said it was too liquidy, and I had to use two 9-inch frozen pie crusts, because it made too much filling for one. Maybe one deep dish crust would work well also.

I added some carrots to the mix for color. I chopped all of the veggies in the food processor before baking, so that I could feed it to my 2 year old easily. It gave everything a nice uniform texture.
I followed other reviewer's advice and put a layer of cheese over the bottom of the crust. I wasn't pleased with the results- the quiche had strata like the layers of the earth.  So the bottom was chewy-cheesy. I think the "soggy crust" problem is from people using frozen brocoli instead of fresh. I used fresh so I think I didn't need to do the "cheese protection" layer.

This is a definite keeper!  Great texture, cooked up beautifully, and was very tasty.  I would use a small onion next time, and I used maybe an extra 1/2 cup broccoli and a 1/2 cup sharp white cheddar on top, but other than that, it was perfect.  I had to bake it 10-15 minutes longer.

I read the reviews and decided to keep the ingredients amounts as is, but to increase the baking time. This quiche came out heavenly. It was light and fluffy...just perfect. The minor adjustments I made were: Cut the butter in half, increased garlic, and decreased salt. I needed to bake it for 50 minutes in order for it to set. I left it to cool for 10 minutes before eating. This was great!!!! I did use a very deep dish pie pan. I didn't have time to make a crust and didn't have a refrigerated one on hand, so I used refrigerated cresent rolls to make the crust. If you do this, cover the edges of the crust with foil. The crescent roll dough really burns easily. Great recipe. Someone mentioned this recipe has too much broccoli. We felt it could actually have used more. However, it was a delightful recipe that we really enjoyed. Thanks for sharing it Sara.

Very good and my 16 month old daughter loves it. I did change it a bit: less milk because it is very liquidy, I almost puree the brocoli so my daughter won't notice it as much, more cheese!  Very delicate flavor.

Yummy but needed a bit of tweeking...here are my changes: I used a pastry sheet and needed to blind bake prior to use, make sure it has completely cooled before adding filling. Not being a veggie I cooked up streaky bacon and ham in the butter, then added onion mushrooms, garlic and broccoli - make sure its all cooled before adding to pastry shell. I only used 3 eggs and 3/4 cup milk otherwise it's too much mixture. I used 50/50 mozzarella and Colby (cheddar) cheese - just mozz made the quiche to liquidy. Needs baking for at least 45 mins. Yummy - hubby and 3yr old daughter just love it!

This recipe turned out really good.  The only change I would make is PRE-BAKE THE CRUST!!!!!  Make sure it is almost all the way done before you put the filling in.  The crust DOES NOT bake hardly at all one you put the filling in.  If the edges of the crust seem to get a little too brown for your liking, cover the edges with some tin foil, this will help it not burn.  I chopped up and fried a few slices of bacon and then added the onions, garlic, and broccoli.  I used half and half instead of milk.  Also, I combined all the veggies and eggs together and then poured them in the crust.

This was easy.  I baked the crust 10 minutes, cooled it, filled with all ingredients and then froze.  Then we used it as a quick meal while we moved houses.  I thawed 45 minutes while we worked and then cooked acc. to directions.  It was too much broccoli for me, next time I wouldn't add so much.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe.  I did make modifications.  I did not use a crust, so I sprayed glass pie pans with canola oil non-stick spray, which worked great.  I had to cut the fats, so I used fat-free milk (reduced to 1c) & cheese (1/2c mild cheddar & 1/2c mozzarella).  I omitted the salt & pepper.  I used 10 ounces of frozen spinach in place of broccoli, only used about 1/2c chopped onion and added a 7 ounce can of mushroom pieces.  Sauted just like the recipe said.  I mixed the sauted items in the bowl with the egg mixture before pouring into the pie pans.  I used 2 pie pans and had 2 thin quiches, which cooked in 30 minutes.  I made it again tonight, only in 1 pan, this time.  It took about 40 mins to bake.  Thanks Sara for a great recipe.  I'll be using this often!!  Tastes great served with salsa!

Proportions in recipe are totally wrong.  The first time I tried it there was so much egg mix, that it overflowed in the oven.  You need to use 2 deep-dish pie shells instead of one to even make this recipe work at all.  I also suggest adding cooked ham for extra flavor.

Very easy to make. You can easily substitute the broccoli for other vegetables or meat. I found that it took awhile for the quiche to set - so it was better the next day after refrigerating it!

This recipe is easy and delicious. I have made it several times. Sometimes I substitute fresh spinach for the broccoli, which I think is better and the cooked onions give the quiche a wonderful flavor. I buy vegetarian pie shells and I can only find them in shallow dish and one recipe will make two shallow pies.

I made this last week and it was excellent. I used a combination of mozzerella, chedar and parmesan cheeses and served it in a pretzel crust found on "All Recipes". The crust did not get soggy like quiche crust often does.

This was the first quiche I've ever made and it was quick and easy.  My BF loved it but I did use frozen broccoli that I rinsed and drained and left out the butter completely.  The cook time turned out to be 55 minutes because the quiche was still "jiggly" after 30.

I was hesitant to make quiche since it seems so fancy and difficult, but this could not have been easier.  The flavor was excellent; however, it did take much longer to bake than the 30 minutes.  If I would have divided it into two pies it might have cooked faster.

Thank you Sara for the best quiche recipe ever! And thanks to all the other reviewers for their comments & ideas - It is hard to find a quiche recipe with no pork (or meat) products in it! 
I used my food processor to mince 1 large onion (drain juice b4 adding to mix though) then I added fresh mushrooms to saute with the broccoli (frozen worked well) - really the ingredients made enough for 2 9" pies - also used sharp cheddar AND mozzarella (buy the pre-shredded finely shredded worked best - and make the recipe even easier) this quiche was so excellent that even my "Real men don't eat quiche" husband raved over it!!! I will make it again & again & AGAIN! Thanks so much :)

My very picky 6 year old ate this quiche. Added red peppers, cut the milk to 1 cup, put cheese directly over the crust and baked for 45 min. It was perfect.  Yum.

I have made this recipe many times. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe calls for. Since then I've added my own little tweaks. Trust me, either way it's a great recipe. What I normally do is add a shallot or a leek and reduce the onion to a 1/2. I also have a problem with broccoli quiche not having cheddar, so I use half mozzarella and half cheddar cheese (about a cup of each). But as I said, this is a great recipe. It's been delicious and a crowd pleaser every time!

First time I've ever made Quiche from scratch...I doubled the recipe and it was way too much for two pie shells. It did take 50 minutes, but it was very tasty and I'll make it again.

This. Quiche. Tastes. Amazing. I would give it five stars except there is WAY TOO MUCH filling. The recipe doesn't say to use a deep dish crust so I didn't, but next time I most definitely will. Even so, I know there will be extra filling. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used frozen broccoli, much less cheese (because I ran out of room in the crust) and four slices of bacon which I fried and crumbled. I cooked the broccoli in the microwave, drained, patted dry and chopped smaller. I sprinkled 2.5 ounces of Mozzarella/Cheddar blend on the bottom of the crust (just over 1/2 cup). I mixed the 4 eggs with just under 1.5 cups milk with my immersion blender. Do this! Trust me! This is what makes the quiche light and fluffy. I cooked the onions in the bacon grease from the four slices of bacon I fried. I stirred the onion/garlic mixture and the bacon crumbles into the eggs. I sprinkled maybe a little over a cup of broccoli over the cheese and then poured the egg mixture over top. I ran out of room to add anymore cheese but I didn't miss it. I had enough extra egg mixture and some extra broccoli to fill a ramekin and make a mini crustless quiche. The quiche was done at 45 minutes and the mini took 20-25 minutes.

Used these modifications: I used 3 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, 1 1/2 cups broccoli, 1/2 cup of diced yellow squash, 1/2 of an onion, and Monterey Jack cheese. Mixed all ingredients together before putting in pie crust. Cooked for about 45 minutes, until cheese turned golden brown on top. It turned out wonderfully and used up veggies in my fridge!

Very yummy! I read the reviews first and adopted various recommendations from others. I used about 1/3 cup less milk than the recipe called for and smashed the cheese into the crust. It was awesome! I will definitely make this again!!!

I made this last night and found it to be excellent.  It was a little wet for my liking so next time I will add a tablespoon of flour to the cheese before adding it to the pie crust.  I make many quiches and most of them to add flour to the cheese to absorb the liquid the vegetables give off.
Will be making the again. Great for dinner with soup or salad.

I improvised on this one a whole lot but the base and the simple steps made it super easy. Used loaf of cheddar cheese bread instead of pie crust(because thats what I had)also meaning I had to use 3 more eggs because it absorbed most of it.I used coconut milk, works well. Used 3 mozzarella sticks and a slice of american cheese lol (once again its because its what I had) Used Artisian Broccoli and shallots. My dude was like OMG Yes! he's a chef so I feel pretty good about this :)

I really love this quiche and it always gets rave reviews. I reduce the milk to only 1 cup and I press the cheese on the bottom of the quiche and place everything else on top, to prevent a soggy crust.  It takes close to 45 minutes to cook until set (in my oven).

I had to cook this quiche longer than 30 minutes, and only used 1/2 onion. Also, I used Colby/Jack cheese because it is what I already had. I also cut of the broccoli finely because we like it better that way.

Way too much onion and milk.  Couldn't fit all the egg mixture in the deep-dish crust.  I needed to add another 10 minutes of cooking time before it was cooked through.

It was good. Just less onion. The other reviews are silly.30 minutes is perfect. Too much cheese like reviews is not good. More broccoli even better. Follow original recipe and enjoy.

Turned out delicious but I followed other's advice and put the cheese on the crust instead of on the filling. I don't know who's oven can cook this in 30 minutes. I had to cook it about 50 minutes before the middle was set.

I did try this recipe and loved it.  I have made quiche before and this was the most flavourful.  When I made it the second time I had some bacon bits and some left over ham on hand and threw that in.  I did use cheddar cheese as that is what I had.   Will definitely make again.  Oh, the boyfriend ate 3/4 of it on his lunch break, lol.

I rarely give reviews, but I felt one was necessary in this case. The quiche had good flavor and with a few changes could be a good recipe. I reduced the milk to a little less than 1 cup and if I make this again I will reduce the cheese to less than 1 cup too. There was WAY too much cheese in this and I that is something I never thought I'd say. The pie crust never cooked, despite the fact that I had to increase the cook time by an hour! After an hour and a half, I ended up taking the quiche out and just removed the soggy crust. Next time I will bake the crust first, at least partially.

Used this as a basis for my quiche and it worked very well.  I added mushrooms and omitted the onion. I didn't use quite as much milk as it called for but might try that next time.  It was quick to make and the end result was yummy!

This has become a favorite in my family! The kids ask for it for breakfast the next day. I have made this recipe many times. It is great  as written! I have made it a few different ways. I have substituted sausage instead of broccoli, yum! Also, cheddar is a nice cheese for this quiche.

My 1 1/2 year old son and I love this recipe! I used frozen veggies (thawed) and added chopped green pepper and mushrooms. I fried those in a non-stick fry pan, using no butter or oil, on medium for about 15 minutes. I like to take my time while cooking, so you might be able to speed up my method. When the crust was ready I beat 5 eggs and added a few drops of truffle oil. Yes, truffle oil. Layered the bottom of the pie crust with shredded cheese, added the veggies and some chopped ham, then poured the egg mixture on top, very carefully. More cheese, feta and shredded, and baked at 325 for 1 hour. I don't know why it takes so long, but it does. However, it is DELICIOUS! This is my second time making it in as many weeks. A BIG THUMBS UP!

I made this tonight. I did not change the measurements on the milk and eggs. It makes enough for 2 crusts, which is great because we LOVE quiche so having 2 is awesome. Doubled the broccoli since we were using 2 crusts. Used 1/2 of an onion and added some garlic  and 1 tsp of curry powder. Used sharp cheddar because I did not want to go back to the store. 1 2-cup bag of cheese was enough for 2 pies. The curry gave it a very nice flavor. Saw that on another recipe on here. It was great!

Very easy recipe for the average chef.  My husband loves quiche, but is allergic to swiss, one of the most common ingredients found in store bought quiche.  I thought I would try my hand at this dish.  He really liked it.  It was a little soggy, but only a little.  I would try reducing my milk or try baking the crust like other suggested.  I added garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Also added a random amount of pepper.  I didn't use the butter in the egg/milk mix because I ran out of butter in the middle of prepping.  Also followed suggestions of a number of reviewers and cooked it about an hour.  So, I modified only slightly, sticking to the recipe overall. Oh and if you are wondering what to pair with it.  I served my quiche with an arugula/spinach salad with yellow onions grape tomatoes, cucumbers, and olives dressed with zesty italian.  Also added a side of canned sliced peaches.  It was an easy meal and what we had in the house.  Initially I was going to do the old "speghetti-dinner" tonight, but I was glad to try something different!

Made a few modifications based on some on the other reviews, noting that even with adding significantly less milk then the recipe asks you still end up with more liquid then needed or will fit into a pie crust.  Next time I will be using three eggs rather then four and a 1/4 cup milk.

I loved this recipe!  Although I made some changes.  I used 1 cup of mozzarella and 1/2 cup of parmesan, some dried basil and parsley, and homemade pie crust.  I also used a shallot instead of an onion and added some olive oil.  It took 50 minutes in the oven instead of 30 but was well worth it!  My family loved it.

i too refined this a bit. i used margarine to saute the veg. I sauted one small yellow onion-finely chopped, half a red pepper-finely chopped, 1 clove of garlic-minced and 2 cups of roughly chopped, thawed "frozen broccoli". I placed the crust in the pie pan, coated the bottom with shredded mozarella. then evenly spread in the sauted veg over the cheese. My egg mixture that I poured in last- 5 eggs, 1 cup milk and s&p to taste.

I have no idea how this recipe as written got this many stars. I followed some other reviewer advice and pressed the cheese into the bottom. I used less liquid because as written it wouldn't even all fit in the pie crust. I cooked it for 50 minutes and it is still so liquidy. I'm now cooking for 10 more minutes and hoping for the best but will not be using this recipe again.

I didn't chop the broccoli but steamed it until not quite done and lay it in the bottom of the partially cooked pie crust. I also use the stalks of broccoli just peal them and cut into chunks. I used 3 different shreaded cheeses; swiss, sharp cheddar and mozzerella. I mixed the cheeses with the egg mixture and poured it over the broccoli. Dot the top with butter. It was really good with a homemade whole wheat crust.

Wonderful and easy. I've made this several times and it's consistently good though I've made several changes. I prefer to use heavy cream instead of the milk for a richer flavor. I also use half Monterrey Jack/half Pepper Jack instead of the mozzarella and I add a couple tbls flour to the egg mix to make a thin batter. Great starter recipe though. Thank you!

Beautiful and delicious!  I sometimes add a bit of shredded carrot and/or zucchini depending on what I have and what the kids need to eat more of.  In a standard 9" pie plate it makes a bit too much to use all of the egg mix, but it comes out beautifully and seems to take closer to 40 minutes to set.  Lovely overall.

This was amazing.  Completely delicious.  I also cooked some apple cured bacon and then crumbled it up and added it in to the mix.  I cooked the quiche for more than an hour, though, so you may need to cook longer than specified in the recipe.  But it was so tasty and was very healthy, I think.  I ate it for three days after I cooked it.

I had no ideas for dinner tonight except a head of broccoli straight from the garden.  Typed broccoli into the search and this recipe came up with pretty good reviews.  Only thing I changed was 3 eggs and 1 c. milk, some mozzarella on the crust before filling and a cheddar blend I needed to use up.  It was excellent, the two of us ate the whole thing.

The first time I made this I forgot to add the milk and it turned out great.  So the second time I made it I added the milk thinking it would be even better... boy was I wrong!  There was way too much liquid for the pie plate this time and the consistancy wasn't as nice.  I will make again, but without adding the milk.

I love this quiche, but in place of the broccoli, I generally substitute greens, usually spinach, but sometimes chard.

It definitely has to cook longer than 30 minutes.  50 seemed to do the trick nicely.  I've made this a couple of times, first sticking to the recipe (with a 4-star review) and then making the changes that give it 5-stars in my book: 3/4C sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella, 1/2 onion instead of a whole, and saute some pancetta/bacon in with the onion and broccoli.

I followed this recipe almost to the "T" except I also reduced the onion amount to abuot 3/4 of an onion as it did seem like too much and I'm glad I did. HOwever, I ended up with way more milk and egg mixture than I needed (it simply would not fit into the pie shell after putting all other ingeredients in first) and had to throw about 1 cup of that away. This was a huge bummer because I paid extra for organic ingredients and they got wasted. It did turn out tasty and I would probably use again but reduce the milk/egg mixture by half.

Great flavour!  Used a boxed pie crust, added 1/4 cup of red pepper, 3 eggs and 1 cup of whole milk.  Very rich, would use lighter milk next time.  A little soggy after baking about 35 minutes, bake longer next time.

Very good... definately simple enough to make... I did read the other reviews before making just as a percaution and made changes as I felt need... I used a deep dish pie pan.... 2 cups of monzarella cheese sprinkling some on top of the pie crust under the veggies... I also used frozen broccoli (to do this I partially thawed it and added to the onions and garlic after they were partially good.. I cooked some of the water out of the broccoli but kept it a little hard) everything else I kept the same... other than the cooking time mine took 50 minutes and it was perfect.. with the combination of changes suggested by the other reviewers this recipe is AMAZING...

I'm rating this based on the actual recipe, with only one change-- adding 1t. of flour to the milk mixture.  The flour helped to bind it a bit-- i'm thinking it's more of a 3 1/2-4 stars.  Needed some extra seasonings after it was cooked, but everyone in my house liked it, and it was good.  I didn't have a problem with the mixture not fitting into the pie crust, however, i did fill it to the top, and it didn't overflow. It was to the TOP.  Baked for the recommended time and it came out great.  There was a bit of liquid at the bottom of the piepan when I cut it though, and I even thought I cooked the broccoli and onions well-- The bottom crust either didn't cook right or it was just too thin (Pillsbury deep dish)- but It was hard for me to find my crust! Other than that-- my husband who "Isn't into quiche" at two pieces and my daughter ate 3 pieces over two days as well. I'll probably make it again.

I made it as called for except that I didn't add garlic, turns out I didn't have any! It was still delicious. There was too much egg for my pie crust, probably could have made 2 quiches!

Everyone loved this on Christmas morning but I used cheddar instead of mozzarella and it went over great with even the little guests

Great.  Simple.  Takes longer to bake than stated in recipe but that's not a problem.  A couple of ideas for those who had problems with soggy crusts:  1) make sure the crust is either frozen or at least very cold,  2) fill it and put it in the oven right away, 3) divide the cheese and put half at the bottom and half on top of the vegetables before adding the custard.  You could also try adding a little flour to the custard (in this case 1/4 C.) to ensure it sets properly.

This was a very good recipe, but I did change a few things. First, I used grated swiss cheese as a bottom layer of the quiche. I think mozzarella is too light of a taste for this tarte. Then I sauted the onions, garlic, and broccoli as directed, but at the very end I added some smoked ham. For the milk mixture, I used cream in the place of the milk, but only 3/4 cup and big spoon of crème fraîche and only three eggs. I skipped the extra tablespoon of butter and only added pepper as the ham gave enough salt. Finally, I for the last 10 minutes, I sprinkled some swiss on top and put my oven on broiler to gratiné the cheese.

great recipe! i steamed my veggies before adding them into the crust and i added red peppers.  i agree that half an onion is plenty. i had to cook longer than 30 minutes, so just check the center to make sure the quiche is ready.  i will definitely make it again!

I tweaked things a bit (see below) and it was the PERFECT amount for the crust size and it was SO DELICIOUS! I've never even made a quiche before and thought this recipe was easy.  Here are the changes I made: Used 1/2 cup of milk (not 1 1/2) Baked some cheese into the crust before starting  Used cheddar cheese  Added crumbled, crispy bacon  Mixed everything together before adding it.

Was very easy! I made my own pie crust because I had forgotten to get some at the store whoops, probably taste better fresh any how. I also didn't have enough fresh broccoli so I used 1 cup fresh and 1 cup frozen. I am the type to put ketchup on most quiche and I am happy to say that this one didn't need any ketchup! I think the next time I make it though I am going to add some mushrooms!

This recipe uses WAY too much milk and the baking time needs to be bumped up to an hour or it will never set. I added an extra egg (and I was already using jumbo eggs) and it came out wet and looked like curdled milk with broccoli chunks in it. Also, I think the crust needs to be prebaked because the only part that cooked was the edge. Not a fan of this at all.

I made with spinach instead of broccoli and sauteed vegs in olive oil instead of butter. I added red peppers for color, two packages of pre-cooked bacon, and because I didn't have milk, I used one can of evaporated milk. I also wanted to make two pies so I added 3 additional eggs. I sauteed the onions, garlic, red peppers, and spinach, added in the cooked bacon, and mixed into the egg and milk mixture. I took other reviewers' suggestions and put a layer of cheese (swiss and sharp cheddar) in the premade pie crusts and baked for about 7 minutes and then let cool. I then poured the egg, milk, vegs, and bacon mixture into the two crusts and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes. I then covered the top with a mixture of swiss and sharp cheddar cheese and baked about 5 minutes longer. Oh my, this is the most delicious and easy quiche my family has ever eaten. It received 5 thumbs up from everyone, followed by many requests to make it again in the very near future -- even by my husband who said he didn't like quiche!!!

This comes out perfect every time.  Definitely put a layer of shredded cheese between the bottom crust and your egg mixture.  The sky is the limit as far as fillings are concerned.  I have added many combinations of meats, vegetables etc. and it always comes out great.

Just made this quiche last night. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I read the other reviews and only used 3 eggs and used a 1/2 cup of grated parmesan and 1 cup of mozzarella. Delicious! It's even better the second day.

This recipe was pretty easy except that I had to make pastry dough for the first time and I used another recipe for that. But let me tell you that it came out great! I used someones idea to put the cheese on the bootom to keep the crust from getting soggy and that worked great and I also put some cheese in the mix as well as on top! My husband and I loved it!

FANTASTIC!!  I made some changes to the recipe.. I added sliced ham, and some red and green pepper. Instead of putting it into a large pie crust, I made mini-quiches using little tart shells, perfect for throwing a couple in a ziploc to take for breakfast on the go!

I steamed broccoli, skipped the garlic and substituted onion powder because I hate chopping things (heh!), but otherwise followed the recipe and found that it took at least twice as long to fully cook. I was so hungry that I had to snack while I waited for the egg to set. :

I don't like mozzarella in my quiche so instead I added half swiss and half cheddar cheese. To give it more flavor I added some chopped ham. With these changes, it's a 5 star.

Taste is good if not great, however texture was on the runny side. Not firm like I was hoping.  I added ham but I don't think that was the problem. Crust on bottom was soggy and no amount of extra oven time was going to firm the thing up.

I loved this quiche! I added 2 roma tomatoes to the broccoli mixture while it was cooking to get some of the water out. My only suggestion would be to use 3 eggs instead of 4 and a cup of milk. Mine was overly full and made a mess in my oven. Also, we served it with a dollop of sour cream on the side - yum!

I liked the idea of this recipe because the cooking time was short.  Big mistake.  I baked mine on 360 for 1.5 hrs!  It was way to soggy in the center and seemed very unappetizing to my  husband and I.  I used fresh broccoli so the ice from frozen wasn't an issue.  Next time I will try what another recipe suggests.  Covering the crust with foil, baking it for 5 min at 450, then reducing it to 350 and bake for 5 more min.  Then you add your contents and bake for 40-45 min.

I wonder if any of "allrecipes" cooks or experts have  ever try to make this - and after that have they try to taste it - I do not think so, otherwise people who tried this recipe would not make so many additions to it or so many alternations to it.  Please try it, before you post it as yours trusted recipe - do not try to lose your reputation.  I did not care for this quiche at all.

This recipe is okay for a base to work from but after making it twice, it needed some changes.  I have perfected it for my family.  I pre-bake the pie crust  for 7 minutes at 450, crust turns out perfect at the end, not soggy at all when you do this.  I used 2 cups of cheese (half cheddar, half mozzarella).  Milk should be reduced to 1 cup.  Use 3 cloves of garlic.  Perfect with these changes.

This is delicious and did not turn out soggy!  I put the cheese on the bottom, as was suggested and only used half of an onion.  It only took 35 minutes in my oven and it held together very well when I cut it!  I plan on making this again sometime soon!

This recipe has lots of potential, but as is it doesn't work. Way too runny, needs more time to cook, and the crust gets soggy. I would follow other suggestions to reduce down the amount of milk to 3/4-1 cup and half of an onion, bake the crust for 10 minutes before filling it, line the crust with the cheese, and cook it 45-50 minutes.

I had never made a quiche at home before trying this recipe and now I wish I had been making it all the time.  Luckily I made 2 for dinner because they were both gone!  I have since used this recipe as a base for other ingredients and have not found one that hasnt been delicious.  I do follow the advice of other reviewers and make a cheese barrier at the bottom to help keep the crust from becoming soggy.  We have yet to have a soggy crust so I guess its working. Thanks a lot...this one is a keeper!

I attempted my first quiche, and I admit, it turned out very good! Based on other reviews, I baked the empty pie shell for 5-7 min. at 350. I then pressed the cheese into the crust to prevent it getting soggy. I also sprinkled some fresh parmesan cheese on top of the quiche when it had ten minutes left. I give 4 stars to the original recipe; 5 stars to the recipe with minor modifications!

I pretty much followed this recipe with the exception of adding a little ham.  It cooked forever and was watery. It did not set up well, like quiches that I have had before. I used fresh, not frozen broccoli.  I think it's coming out watery due to the large amount of milk.  I made this BEFORE i decided to serve it at a bridal shower and I will NOT be using this recipe.  Flavor great.  Presentation not so great.

I made the recipe as stated above, using fresh broccoli and did not turn out well AT ALL. It was very wet and soggie, and it was not ready in 30 minutes. I noticed that anyone who gave this a good review made major changes. Thumbs down for this recipe as is.

This is a very good quiche recipe.  I made it about a week or two ago and it turned out fabulous. With all of the "wetness" issues I should say that my quiche turned out almost dry.  The trick is to use fresh, non-frozen broccoli.  Frozen broccoli has too much water in it and that melts down into the quiche.
I also suggest that you may want to add extra salt.  It was a little bland until we put extra salt on it and then it was fabulous.  This recipe takes a little effort but is better than microwavable junk food. Definitely try it, if you don't like it, you can always order a pizza! :) Good luck.

I really love this quiche! I have made it for a few brunches and everyone loves it. I had to cook longer than the recipe calls for, so plan ahead for that. I have also made this ahead, cooked it the night before and left in on the counter overnight, then just warmed it in the oven in the morning and it turned out great!

My way is even easier.  I used a box of frozen chopped broccoli (thawed of course), 3 eggs, 1 cup soy milk.  If you chop the onion and garlic small enough there is no need to saute anything since it cooks almost an hour in the oven.  I put the cheese on the bottom as suggested by previous reviewer and mixed everything else and put on top of the cheese.  I did add a little Mrs. Dash to the mix. It took 50 minutes to cook completely and it turned out great!!

Instead of broccoli, I put ham and pineapple. Although, you should bake the pie crust first and only use fresh pineapple instead of canned. If you like hawaiian pizza - you'll love this one too.

This is the best quiche ever!  It is so easy and so tasty.  I modified the recipe by adding a bit more broccoli, 3/4 a cup of half and half instead of milk, and 3 eggs instead of 4.  Also added some veg bacon and cheddar on top. So good!!

I also made the mistake of making this and not reading the reviews.  I made just as the recipe says and there was too much beggies and cheese that when I added the eggs, I could only add half the mixture and it spilled over the crust and got the bottom of my oven all messy.  I had to cook it  much longer than the 30 minutes.

I made this quiche as an appetizer for Easter.  Everyone absolutely loved it!  After reading reviews, I decreased the the milk to one cup, and used the suggestion for pressing some cheese to form a shield.  It was also easy to make.

This quiche was a big hit with my girlfriends, but I did make some changes. I reduced the butter to 2 Tbs total, used 2 eggs and 3/4 cup of egg beaters, and I used 1 cup of 1% milk and 1/2 cup of skim. I also used about half swiss cheese and half cheddar, because I didn't have any mozzarella. Next time I make it, I'll reduce the milk by about 1/2 cup.

Excellent. Threw in some frozen yellow squash and used jack and cheddar cheeses since that's what I had available. Was good for the in-laws. Second time I made it, I added some cooked and crumbled sausage. Delicious!

MMMmmmmm so good!
After using some suggestions from previous poster: fresh brocoli (obviously!), pressing a layer of cheese into the pie crust before adding egg mixture, and adding all ingredients together. 
And also using a few adds of my own: sautee portabello mushrooms and spinach with the broccoli!
This turned out fantastic! A definite save!

This is a wonderful base recipe!  I had a few spears of fresh asparagus around so I diced them and plut them in with a bit of cooked diced bacon.  Just make sure that when you add extra ingredients to adjust the liquid amount to compensate.  This is certainly a keeper.

Very Easy and Good.  Even my quiche-phobic husband tried it and ate half of it....there went my leftovers I was hoping for!  I took the advice of others and only used 1 C. milk, used only 3/4 of an onion, and increased the broccoli to 2-1/2 C.  Turned out perfect after baking for about 50 minutes.  I don't know why some people are saying this will make 2 pies.  I used a deep dish frozen crust and everything fit just fine, so don't worry!
Oh, it's even better with Oscar Mayer Real Bacon bits in it too! I've made this recipe 3 times in the past couple months for dinner!

This was delicious and very easy! I wish I'd read the other reviews though - I used a regular pie crust and only half the egg mixture fit in it - I ended up throwing the other half of the mixture out and as a result, the quiche didn't hold together well (too many veggies). However it was so good that we ate the whole thing - just 2 of us!! I'll be making again tonight in a deep dish pie with a medley of veggies and extra garlic - thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe. I'm not sure why some people found this to be enough for two pies; I only made a half-portion, and it was not enough for the pie crust I made (just a standard, 9" pie crust). I used the "Best Ever Pie Crust" recipe for the crust.

This quiche came out picture perfect and the texture was great, but that's were it ends. It was way to bland even with the addition of extra garlic and a tsp of Italian herbs. Perhaps using a mixture of mozzarella cheese and cheddar would give it more flavor. Also, the broccoli tasted bitter and it needed to bake 45 minutes.

This was my first quiche ever, and I was surprised that it worked so well and easily. The only changes I made were to use both mozzarella and mild cheddar. Next time I would probably use a little more broccoli. It took about 50 minutes to cook completely and needed to cool for 5-10 minutes before cutting into.

This is the first time I've ever made a Quiche and it was delicious! We added about 1/2c. diced ham. As someone else mentioned, the egg/milk mixture was too much. I would cut the egg, milk and butter in to half next time.

This was decent but not as great as I had hoped.  I think I should have dried out my broccoli more because my quiche turned out watery too.  Tasted better leftover.

I give this 2 stars, Husband gives it 3. He's not a big quiche fan, so I'm not surprised he wasn't blown away by it. I, however, LOVE quiche, and I really didn't like it. I thought the broccoli was bitter. I'll stick with my favorite cheese and onion quiche. Oh, and again, I am amused by the reviewers who give this 5 stars.... after adding bacon, a variety of cheeses etc etc. If you do that, IT ISN'T THE SAME RECIPE. Jeez...

YUMMMMM!!!! Served with a fresh garden salad and was a big hit! Did make a few "slight" changes though.Instead of fresh broccoli, I buy the big bags of Birdseye broccoli florets. I defrosted some and chopped them up. For the pie crust, I used the roll out and bake pie crusts you buy in the refrig section and baked for about 15 minutes before filling. I used the given amount of eggs and milk in the recipe, and used 2 regular 9 inch glass pie plates so I had enough 2 quiche's, which means "left-overs" and fine by me (smile). Also I added the egg and milk mixture to the rest of the filling and mixed together before pouring into the pie crust as recommended by others. This was my first attempt at a quiche and you can bet I will keep this in my recipe box and will make often. It was quick, easy and most of all so yummy!!

Good stuff!  I too reduced the milk (3/4cup), added mushrooms, carrots and used 1/2 mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cheddar, threw in a dash of hot sauce and it was delicious!  Tasted like the veggie lasagna from stouffers.  Thanks a lot!

I made quite a few changes: used 1/2 onion, no garlic, roughly 3/4 cup of broccoli, sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella, 3 eggs (based on previous comments here), and 1 1/4 cups milk. Also added fresh chopped chives and a no-salt herb mix. Had to cook it about 50 minutes. Turned out well.

This was great...you defintiely need to bake it much longer than 30 minutes. There was enough to fill two shells, instead I used one deep dish shell. I also added chopped spinach, used low fat milk and cheese and light butter to cut back calories.

This is the first quiche I've ever made, and it turned out great!  I did change the recipe slightly though.  I used cheddar instead of motz, and I used a combo of broccoli and cauliflower and no onion.  I cooked it for about 35 minutes, some people have complained that they didn't think it cooked well, but keep in mind that quiche is not supposed to have a firm texture (in my experience at restaurants).  Too much egg mixture was created, I would recommend using 3 eggs, 3 1/3 cups of milk (give or take).  I used skim milk, and cooked my veggies in water instead of butter to reduce the fat content.  All in all, I thought it was delicious!

The quiche tasted good but was far too soggy.  Infact, there was way too much egg mixture, I probably could have made a second quiche with it.  In the future, I would probably reduce the amounr of milk and eggs.

I wasn't sure this would turn out, but I followed the advice of the reviewers and bought 2 shallow pie crusts and kept everything else the same (substituting one package of frozen spinach for the broccoli). It was DELICIOUS! I would highly recommend this recipe for a moist and yummy quiche. I could only find shortbread crust in the baking aisle, so that made it a little sweeter :)

FANTASTIC! This was so good! It was really easy to throw together and had a wonderful taste. I did add some extra cheese, because my family are big on cheese, but there is nothing else I would add, it was fantastic. Thanks!

Very good!  I made this with homemade pie crust (much better than commercial)!  I substituted co-jack cheese for the mozzarella, and added crisp cooked bacon pieces.  Our easy and colorful side dish was sliced tomatoes.  My family really enjoyed this.  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you Sara for the wonderful recipe!  My husband who is a beginner cook made this and it was scrumptious! Even he was surprised & impressed.  He added crumbled bacon and mixed vegetables with egg-milk mixture rather than pour it over top.  He also cooked it for 45 minutes.

I loved this recipe - I used seasoning salt instead of regular salt which gave it a nice flavor.  I also found that it needed longer to bake (at least 40 min.) and a shallow 9" pie pan was too small.

This was easy and tasty. I added bacon and zucchini and we enjoyed it quite a bit. A keeper. Note: If you buy the deep dish crust instead of the regular then four eggs shouldn't be too much.

This was a very versitle recipe. I too used it as a guide. I substituted spinach for broccoli and added bacon. Next time I will ditch the mozarella (not enough flavor) and add swiss and ham instead. I used the full four eggs and milk and made two quiches. My three young boys ate this and asked for seconds so it's a keeper. Great way to hide those veggies!

Well, I must say I didn't follow this recipe exactly.  I used it only as a guideline and it turned out very well.  I improvised and added both cheddar and swiss cheese. I didn't bother adding garlic, but I'm sure it would have tasted great with it.  I also made my own pastry crust, so it had a real homemade taste and feel about it.  My pastry crust stuck to parts of the pan, but that's another issue altogether.  All in all, it was a very good recipe.  I got rave reviews when my guests tried it.

Everybody took seconds, and my kids loved it too.  I added fresh mushrooms and had two crusts ready since the other comments mentioned there was a lot of liquid.  There was plenty for two pies.

My 9-inch pie crust would not fit all of the egg mixture and I only got to use half of it. I don't know if i need to do a deeper-dish version or measure my vegetables more carefully!  But it tasted great anyways!  Next time I'll lower the onion content though.

AMAZING START. I have made this numerous times and finally got it to darn near perfect. This is a lovely recipe, but it needed some slight tweaking, otherwise you'll end up with a soggy (but still yummy) dish. My recommendations are to cook the crust beforehand for about 5 minutes and only use one cup of milk, and 1/3 - 1/2 of an onion (depending on size) instead of a whole onion. It takes 50-55 min to cook. This dish is divine and very easy, anyone can make it!

The secret when adding broccoli to any baked dish is to STEAM it first. It will keep that beautiful bright green color and will not make anything soggy. Better dishes through tricks ??

I changed some things. I pre-baked my crust for 10min then layered it with sliced mushrooms and cooked  chicken cubes. I then put the broccoli - which i sauted with half an onion and garlic, over and the liquid mixture. I used 2 eggs and about a cup of milk/cream/chilli flakes mixture. I then added mozzarella and a little bit of chedder on the top along with some macon. Baked 45-50 min and came out pretty amazing - even my 3 year old asked for more. Will be making this again.

Used suggestion to pat cheese  in bottom of crust and then mixed some in egg mixture.  I put a lot of  the broccoli mix in two deep dish crusts then poured in egg mix.  Used 6 eggs, 3/4 almond milk, made 2 great yummy quiches.  Cooked 45 min.

I took the onions and only used about 1/2 CUP, cooked with butter on the stove (Irish Butter). I added about 1 cup of cook potatoes as well (chopped). I also flavored the 2 cups of broccoli with some butter and salt to taste  and I added  2 egg whites and than made sure to reduced the milk to just 1 cup. Hopefully  that helps! Enjoy!

Subbed 1 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp garlic.  Cut out all butter and pie crust, used frozen brocc, cooked, then drained. Used 6 eggs, cut the milk down to 1 cup. Used cheddar, maybe a cup. Added a few pieces of thin sliced deli ham. Amazing!

Delicious! A few small tweaks to the original recipe. Half an onion instead of a whole. An extra tsp of minced garlic. Only one cup of milk rather than 1.5 cups. I covered the bottom of the crust in cheese and added the remainder in with the veg mixture. I think it took closer to 45 mins to bake. I had no issues with the quiche being too wet.

While this is a good base recipe, the measurements and directions are a bit off. I suggest cutting the amount of milk or half and half that you are using to ¾ of a cup. Be sure to put some of the shredded cheese (I used ¾ c mozzarella and ¾ c white cheddar) on the bottom of the pie crust BEFORE adding the broccoli mixture. I also used 1 extra egg for a total of 5 , and baked for  40 minutes. I would advise placing the pie on a baking sheet while cooking in case it bubbles over. After following the advice of reviewers I got a 5 star quiche!

I brought this quiche to a party and received all positive reviews. I myself thought it was quite good!

Not sure what everyone's issue with this recipe was. I followed this recipe directly as suggested, with only two minor changes. My broccoli florets were not good, so I just used the stalks and cut them into smaller pieces. I also baked this in a metal pie tin, making the baking time shorter, at about 35 minutes.

I still used all of a medium sized onion, and this did not seem like too much. I guess the broccoli proportion may have caused there to be an overflow for other people, since I did not use nearly as much. 

I think a huge key to this recipe is beating the eggs well and stirring in the hot, melted butter. This causes the egg mixture to cook slightly before you even put it in the oven.

Really, really good! I admit I added some bacon. Reduced the milk and added an extra egg. Made a quick bisquick crust. Baked for 45 minutes and it was absolutely perfect. Husband was impressed, said he'd be happy if he got this at a restaurant. Taking a slice for lunch tomorrow. Yum!

I followed the directions exactly. Turned out great, and really tasty, only it took at least an hour for it to set in the middle. (Not so great on a hot day!)

Tasted good, but the recipe was way too soggy in the middle.   I baked it an extra 10 minutes and it was still soggy. Perhaps less milk or switching to a more viscous base like cream would make it better.

This is a good recipe but like most, you have to modify to your tastes. I used half an onion in each pie, broccoli, cheese and bacon. And it did take 50 minutes to cook and set. Delish!

So easy and so delicious. Must use fresh broccoli as other reviewers have said. I also added some some garlic with the onions and broccoli. I reduced the milk to one cup and added sausage. The family loved it. This is a keeper!

I followed this recipe according to directions. It was wonderful! I wanted to use up some brocolli I had cooked the previous night. I did throw in a few ham pieces but that was just to give it a little extra flavor, This is the best quiche recipe I've ever used. Thanks for sharing!

Final result was delicious, but I made several changes. I only used about 1/4 cup onion, 1 cup fresh-chopped broccoli and 1 cup chopped portobello mushrooms. The 4 eggs and 1-1/2 cup milk is way too much. A deep-dish pie crust would probably work better. Used 1/2 cup Vermont white cheddar and just 1 cup mozzarella. Also, I would recommend prebaking/browning the crust a bit to keep it from being soggy.

I give it a 5 for flavor but this will definitely NOT be done in 30 minutes this way.  Next time, I'll use a lot less milk, more like 1/2 cup. I will also cover it for the first 15 minutes and uncover it for the last 30. Be sure to put a pan on the bottom rack of the oven in case there's dripping!  For fun, I added a dash of parsley and dill weed to the egg mix.

I really liked this.  I didn't give it five stars because  I made it with my own touches. I don't eat gluten so I just buttered the pan and dusted it with rice crumbs (I actually use a huge pyrex bowl- The bottom is basically the size/shape of a pie pan, but I don't have to worry about overflow).  My kids aren't crazy about onions (which makes it easier to make) so I just added additional spices.  I also used leftover broccoli and cheddar cheese.  My kids gobbled it up.  Easy as pie!  Made it two days in a row because it's such a quick, easy and nutritious meal.

Very yummy. I used a frozen pie crust and fresh broccoli. I wish I had added bacon or ham. I didn't add the full amount of cheese and it was a little runny. Had to bake for over 30 minutes.

This was my first quiche I ever made and it came out fantastic! The only issue was the time listed. I put it in the over at 350* for 30min and it was still runny after the 30min. I ended up cooking it for almost an hour before it was set. It still came out great and was a big hit with my boyfriends family! Highly recommended!

I made this for my husband and I on Easter morning. It was delicious and both of us had 2nds :) I took the advice of one of the reviewers about baking the frozen pie shell  until lightly brown then cooled it slightly added the shredded mozzarella cheese on the bottom of the pie shell.  Sautéed my broccoli, garlic, onions, and red peppers with olive oil.  Beat the eggs and added half and half with salt and pepper and garlic powder. YUMMY and thank you for sharing and will definitely be making it again.

Reduced the milk to 1 cup, pressed the cheese into the pie crust and baked an additional 15 minutes with no problems.  We weren't crazy about the mozzarella cheese and egg combination.  If I try this again, I will use mild cheddar.

This is just delicious.  It makes a filling evening meal with a side salad.  Quick to make, too.  You do need to use a deep dish pie crust, though, as the regular size ran over.  We used garlic powder and powdered onions because of our aging stomachs.  We used fresh broccoli and only the florets.  Chopped pretty fine.  Added 5 minutes to the stated time, but it was perfect.  Don't know why there were some poor reviews.

I made this this morning and it turned out wonderfully.  I added a cup of cooked ham with the broccoli.  What I would do differently is that I would add absolutely no salt to the egg mixture.  With the salt in the pie dough, the cheese, and the ham, I really didn't need to add any at all.  My daughter and I enjoyed it and I would highly recommend it.

I followed the recipe exactly. The milk/egg mixture overflowed. You probably need to at least halve the milk. Otherwise, it was good.

I tried this recipe as an alternative to my usual recipe (cheese as the first layer over the crust, no onions).  Unfortunately, I much prefer my usual recipe.  My other recipe's cheese-on-the-bottom finally made sense to me when I tasted this one. The crust on the bottom had become completely soggy from moisture coming out of the onions.  Going back to my usual recipe, which turns out firm and delicious.

The result came out great, but it needed to bake waaaaaayyyyy more that what was told.  I can't imagine that everyone who made this didn't have the same problem.  It was so wet at 30 minutes.  I had to put foil on it, for it to bake more without burning the top.  I am looking for another recipe, as this one took too long.  Additionally, I had to wait too long for it to set and solidify when I took it out the oven.

First of all, I think this recipe is made for a DEEP dish pie crust. I had 1 cup of the egg mixture leftover because it was way too much. Secondly, I only had to use 1 C of the mozzarella cheese. My advice would be to either use a deep dish pie crust, or if using a standard crust, cut the liquid ingredients in half (2 eggs, 3/4 c milk, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper). Other than that, it's a great recipe and very tasty!!

This was good, though I felt like it needed some kind of kick, maybe a little red pepper spice.

We really enjoyed this.  I used this recipe as a basis to use up some vegetables in the fridge that were on the verge of going bad.  I had a little bit of broccoli, a red pepper, a few mushrooms and a little bit of spinach.  I actually got two quiches out of the recipe.  I cooked both of them.  One we ate immediately and the other was popped inside a gallon freezer bag and frozen.  To reheat it: Place FROZEN quiche in 375 degree oven for 25 - 30 minutes.

This quiche is amazing. My husband wants me to make it for his dad when we go visit next exclaiming that it is by far the best he has ever had. The broccoli makes it. Love this!

From past quiche experience I cut down the milk and cheese as there is no way it would fit into a 9 inch shell.  i also cooked it on convection bake and it really didn't set until another 20 minutes passed.  My husband thought it was tasty though!

Made this for dinner last night. Pretty much followed the recipe. Only change was adding chopped ham. Thought it was missing something. Husband said bacon would have probably made the difference.

I love making these for a quick lunch or yummy breakfast. We've also used asparagus in place of the broccoli. My son, who HATES eggs, will even eat this because it's cheesy enough for him to forget the eggs. :)

This was very good.  No major changes other than one whole onion would be overwhelming.  I used what I had in the fridge, 1/4 of an onion and it was plenty. It also took a full hour to cook through, not 30 minutes.  My oven is cooking to temp, so that's not the problem.  I think you could get away with a bit less cheese and salt too.  The salty mozzarella and a teaspoon of salt...it was plenty salty.

Great recipe!  I added some sausage to make it dinner and used frozen brocoli and added a 1/2 cup zucchini.  I cooked it about 20 minutes more than called for - a total of 50 minutes.

I am lazy so just didn't use a crust at all, and mixed everything all together and baked it. I did the recipe as written except used slightly less onion, and 1 1/4 cup milk instead of 1 1/2. The only change I'll make next time is to cut back on the salt a bit. Yummy!

This was very easy. I used leftover broccoli that was drained and chopped up finely. Reduced milk amount and added Parmesan cheese about 1/2 cup.  Very yummy.

This is fabulous. I just got done making it. I added bacon, used 3% milk, added one more egg, I cooked it longer than 30 minutes and used mild marble cheese. It was my first time making it. It smelt SO good it woke up all my roommates. Thanks a MILLION!!!

Delicious, economical (college students take note!), and a great dish for using whatever is in the fridge! I used the Julia Child ratio and ended up using only three eggs, then added milk to equal 1 1/2 cups total. Like some other reviewers, I put a layer of cheese on the bottom of the crust, and also needed to bake @ 45 minutes. Thanks for this recipe

Very easy. The son gave it 2 stars, daughter and hubby gave it 4 stars. This filling is enough for 2 quiches. I did press the cheese into the bottom and I had no sogginess at all. I think bacon would be a wonderful addition to this.

For just my husband and me I halved the recipe.  I added more salt and pepper than the recipe called for.  I also used one refrigerator pie crust and three mini-pie pans.  I had to 'piece together' the last crust, but the three mini-pans held the halved recipe perfectly.  I used frozen/thawed broccoli and it worked fine.  My husband said this one was a 'keeper.'

So yummy! I thought the amount of milk would be too much, but it comes out great every time! Just be sure to cook it thoroughly- in our convection oven, this took just under an hour to cook, but it did not come out soggy at all. We used fresh broccoli, and we added a pastry top (my husband loves the flaky pastry). Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this as a basic guideline and altered it quite a bit for a perfect result.  I used 5 eggs instead of 4, half and half instead of milk (lowered the quantity from 1 1/2 cups to 1 cup), substituted cheddar cheese for mozzarella, left out the garlic and substituted leeks for the onion.  I baked it for 45 minutes and it was perfect!  Even my kids loved it!

Decreased the amount of milk to 1 cup, prebaked the pie crust with half of the mozzarella at the bottom, and added some chopped ham and red pepper.

Didn't have access to a grill, so I baked it @ 350 degrees for about an hour.  Came out great.

Really good, I did make a lot of adjustments to fit my personal taste. Double the garlic ( I do this for every recipe). Seriously caramelize the onions;- I took about an entire hour to do so. Use  the head of FRESH broccoli, literally no stalk. I tore the top pieces apart by hand after cutting away most of the trunk/stalk. (Sorry I'm not familiar with anatomy of broccoli) In the pan in which the onions were sauteed-after removing the onions, saute the broccoli & garlic together until soft. I also used extra cheese.(2cups total) one cup of mild cheddar and one of mozzarella. This was then spread over the bottom of a pie shell which had been lightly buttered. The onions were layered on top of the cheese and then the broccoli finally followed by the egg. Instead of milk I used 1/2 & 1/2. I doubled the recipe and the adjustments and added an extra egg filled two pie shells and took the quiches to  two thanksgivings as an appetizer. It was very well received.

I don't know what the person who gave it one star is talking about. This recipe is SOOOOOO easy and delicious. And it's such a GREAT basic recipe that you can just do a few alterations and make many different kinds of quiches with it. THE BEST!!!! Thank you for posting it. So easy and not as many ingredients as other quiches I have tried.

My first attempt at quiche, but not my last!! Super easy, super delicious. I pressed the mozarella into the crust as suggested by another review and did have some egg mixture left over. I also used frozen brocolli and added cajun seasoning. Even my picky hubby loved it!

Turned out great with a few tweaks.  Took the suggestion to make two 9inch pies, added cubed up chicken (boiled with garlic powder for 20ish min) and more broccoli and  it came out delish! I even had someone go back for 3rds. Great first time making quiche!

I have never made Quiche before. It turned out very soggy, I would say use half the onions, a little less broccoli and  closer to 45-50 minutes baking time. Also be careful, the filling overflowed it can be very messy

AWESOME! I left it JUST like the recipe because this was my first go-around at quiche. I followed the advice of someone else to push the mozzerella down against the dough, and it totally worked. I sprinkled just a bit of cheddar on top of the egg mixture at the very end, but I don't know if it really made a difference. The recipe is GREAT just like it is...and it's SO easy it inspires you to try it again with experimentation. =)

I follow this recipe exactly as written, except for the fact that I omit the onions, out of personal taste. Most of the time I don't use a crust, either just so that I can save calories. This quiche has delicious flavor... soooo good. If using frozen broccoli, do NOT forget to thaw and drain it, otherwise it will be watery. An excellent recipe that gets a lot of use in the chilly months! :)

Super Tasty! I would give it five stars, except that the recipe is a little misleading. This makes TWO deep dish quiches, not one. I followed other reviewer's advice and added a layer of cheese at the bottom to keep quiche crust from getting soggy and used fresh broccoli. I alternated layers of the broccoli mix and cheese. I cut milk to 1 cup and added a teaspoon each of oregano and basil. All of which are very minor alterations, however had I tried to put all this into one quiche, it would have been a disaster. So great recipe for TWO quiches.

Great recipe. I decreased the amount of milk to 3/4 cups. Next time I also think I will be mixing the veggies, cheese, and eggs and pour that into the crust, as my eldest says he would prefer to have all the items mixed instead of in layers. Taste-wise, excellent. I made two pies and the kids loved it.

This was delicious. For the rather novice cook like me- be sure to cut the broccoli very small so it can fit in a pie dish. Also this took about an hour to cook vs. the short amount of time reported.

I wish I had read the reviews before I tried to cook. I only had one cup of milk, but I'm glad I didn't have more, because like others said, it was way too liquidy. I live at a high elevation (over 4,000 feet), and I've never made quiche before, so I thought it might be a problem with the elevation. I put it back in the oven at 375 for about 10 minutes to no avail. I finally took it out of the oven and put it in the fridge because I have to go to work, but I'm not optimistic that it will set up enough to eat for dinner.

I never made a quiche before and this turned out well.  I shared some with neighbors who also loved it.  It does call for a bit too much milk though.  I just used 3/4 C. and it set up ok after cooling.  Using any more would have been disastrous.

I thought this recipe was delicious! I referred to past reviews and used 3 eggs and 1 cup milk and I pushed some cheese into the bottom of the pie crust first.  I did have to bake the quiche for 50 mins at 355 degrees before it was no longer runny inside.  I'm giving this recipe a 4 and not 5 stars as I had to make some modifications based on previous reviews.  I will make this again

I followed the recipe closely the first time and it was ok. The second time, it was much much better. I used only 1 c. milk and reduced the cheese and butter in half. I also added in some chopped ham. I would prebake the crust for 10 mins though and the put foil around the edges because the crust had an uneven consistency - the bottom was soggy and the top part was perfect. I baked it for 40 mins. Yum yum! We ate the whole thing in one meal too :) I'm making this again next week for sure.

This was awesome!  I did cut the milk down to 3/4 of a cup like someone suggested and it came out great.  I didn't have a crust and didn't feel like making one and it was great without it.  My husband was loving every bite of it!

Mine turned out perfectly. I stuck more or less to the recipe except for a little less onion and salt. I added some spicy mustard because I thought mozzarella, eggs and broccoli would be fairly bland. I couldn't taste the mustard at all but maybe it sharpened up the taste of the cheese. I just nuked frozen broccoli florets, roughly chopped and put them in the bottom of the crust (I didn't saute them w/the onion) w/the cheese over and poured the egg mixture over all. I mooshed it all around a bit w/a fork to be sure the eggs contacted all the solid bits. Perfect! Not at all wet and plenty tasty.

Easy, cheesy, and delicious! I've made this recipe a few times and sometimes add Swiss cheese into the mix.

Awesome! My husband and I loved it.  I made a homemade crust. Placed a layer in the bottoms of a large muffin pan then continued to follow this recipe. :)

Good flavor, though we only used half an onion, and didn't have mozzarella so we used cheddar.  I brushed the crust with butter to keep the water out of it.  Tasted great!

Delicious as it is! I might try adding some corn next time to get it a bit of sweetness and a little crisp, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!

A great way to use up leftover cooked broccoli - served with hot rolls and fresh pineapple - yum!  I had to bake it for about 45 minutes because it was still too jiggly after 30 minutes.  All 3 kids and husband liked it too.

This didn't work as well as I had hoped. I used fresh broccoli, and reduced the milk to 3/4 of a cup. Still too much liquid, even after letting it sit for 15 minutes. I'll try it again, but with less milk.

I of course made modifications.. and in my daughters words "yummy yummy". Fresh broccoli is a must but I didn't cook it first.. just made sure to cut just the tops and they were fairly small.. was too  lazy to cut up onion and left out the garlic also. I used half a container of feta cheese pressed into bottom of crust (deep dish) then poured in the egg/broccoli mixture (I used cream) and topped that with a package of tomato and basil flavored feta cheese. Also seasoned it with salt, pepper and herbs de provence. YUM!

You really, really, really don't need as much onion as the recipe calls for. Also, it's much better if you don't add butter to the egg mixture and use olive oil instead of butter to sautee the vegetables. Also, I'd say use a different kind of cheese that goes better with broccoli like plain Gouda or like the quiche Lorraine, some Gruyere.

Wow, I actually made a quiche!  I made as directed except I added some chopped ham and pressed the cheese onto the pastry before adding the veggies.  Did have to cook it a bit longer than 30mins though.  I also used ready made chilled pastry as I didn't have time to make my own.  Will be making my own quiche from now on, no more store bought stuff!!

Recipe needs some major adjustment.  I followed it as written and yet it took up two 9 inch crusts.  End result turned out tasty, though.

Loved the recipe however I did make a few adjustments.  I didnt use the garlic because I didn't want it to be too overpowering so I used a dash of garlic powder instead. The quiche  did need to bake longer than 30 minutes..I baked it for 50 minutes :) Overall great recipe!! :)

My favorite basic Quiche recipe - easy to adjust for any ingredient - for vairety try cheddar, bacon, sausage, potatoe, mushroom, spinach, herbs, or swiss for very easy simple quiches.  Try seafoods like shrimp and crab for more elegant fare.  The combinations are endless.

I have made this time and time again. I couldn't be more pleased. I do choose to make my own crust simply because its really not hard to do and my family appreciates so much more. I choose to use white cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella but this is just a personal pref. of mine. Its not only an easy recipe but GREAT tasting as well, thanks for the post!!!!

Really delicious.  I did what some other reviews did and added about 4 strips of crumbled bacon to the veggie mixture.  I also used only 3 eggs and baked a light layer of chedder onto the bottom of the crust and mixed one cup of sharp cheddar and 1 cup of pepper jack.  My boyfriend who thinks that quiches aren't "food for men" asks for this all the time now!

Excellent!  As with many other reviewers, I pre-baked the crust only for 7 minutes with a layer of cheese pressed into the bottom.  For the filling, I only added 1/2 an onion.  I included 1 1/2 cups of broccoli (frozen, but thawed and drained overnight on paper towels) and 1/2 cup of chopped mushrooms.  I used three eggs and one cup of milk.  Instead of mozzarella, I used a cheddar and mozzarella mix.  I cooked for 45 minutes and then added a light layer of cheese and baked for 5 additional minutes.  My preschooler loved it!!

Despite following others' suggestions, my crust still came out soggy and there was too much egg and milk mixture and had to keep some out.  Next time, I would reduce by one egg and maybe add a few less veggies.

Very good, even my picky husband who made a face when I told him I was making quiche, said that he really liked it and went back for more. I served it for lunch for my husband and 2 kids ( 4 and 2) and myself, we ate every last bite.  I am for sure going to make it again once a month or so.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I pretty much made it as is and the only thing that needed to be changed was the cooking time as 30 minutes is not enough to set the quiche.  I may have been more liberal with the garlic, but other than that, this recipe is great as is.  I took to a gathering and everyone wanted the recipe.  Enjoy!

After reading reviews I just barely cooked my broccoli and was prepared for more than just the prescribed half an hour, but cooking the broccoli turns out to be completely unnecessary (my barely cooked broccoli turned out very mushy) and you should give this quiche atleast an hour to cook.  But it tasted great.

I have never made a broccoli quiche. It was really yummy and super easy. I will probably start making this a couple times per month. It is still good the next day for leftovers too.

Unlike many other reviewers (as far as I can tell), I actually made the recipe pretty much as written, in terms of ingredients, and it came out great! I followed others' advice of pressing some of the cheese down before pouring in the mixture as well as stirring everything into the egg/milk mixture, instead of pouring it over the veggies. This recipe is tasty, relatively simple, meatless, and doesn't require a ton of crazy ingredients - all good things in my book!

EASY quiche recipe.  I adjusted only because of what I had on hand and because I can't follow instructions :)  I prebaked the pie crust for abt 10 minutes.  Sprinkled 1/2 cup of mozzarella over the crust, topped with vegetable mixture, and poured mixture of 3 eggs, 1 cup milk and 1 cup cheddar cheese over all.  Baked 45 minutes.  Looks and tastes delicious, and so easy & quick.  Will use again for a vegetarian dish.

This is an excellent recipe with its basic ingredient list and ease of preparation.   I used 1/3 of a very large yellow onion and diced it with a good knife set.  I used instead 1 tablespoon of fresh garlic (long slices like in marinara sauce and then chopped them into  little squares).   Also, I used course ground Malabar Black Pepper - very nice flavor.   And I chopped only the broccoli florets (fresh).   When I sauteed the broccoli, chopped onion and garlic I used extra virgin olive oil: no butter.  It took approximately 15-20 minutes to fullly soften up.  Then I sliced up the broccoli pieces so that the floret tops would mix in with the quiche mixture.   Instead of adding melted butter at the end, I used 1/2 cup of Half and Half and 1 cup of whole milk.   Bon Appetite! Great recipe!

It was ridiculous just how easy this was! My husband swore he wouldn't eat quiche. I made it anyway and he asked for seconds! Next time I think I'll make a regular quiche though with things like ham and cheddar instead. I wasn't a fan of the broccoli.

Used some of the recommendations of others.  baked 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese on the the crust for about 10 minutes to set.  Used frozen broccoli (gasp!!) and turned out great!  I thawed completely and dried w/ a paper towel.  i sauteed w/ green onions and diced yellow peppers.  Was very good!  I will consider adding feta cheese or possibly turkey sausage.

I've used this recipe and pretty much added anything to it.  I always have extra egg mixture... if you are using large or extra large eggs, you probably can cut out an egg. You really can't mess this up.  And, I've never had problems with it being soggy.

This was pretty tasty. I only did one cup of milk and I added cheddar cheese, mushrooms and red peppers.  I tried the basic crust from stephanie but I will need more practice.

We loved this quiche!  I added some mushrooms to the sautee, just cause we love 'em.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to thaw out the pie crust, so I left it frozen.  Quiche came out great!

Great, easy recipe.  I modified slightly by adding some ham and used a bit more cheese than recipe suggested.  I also added a bit of Montreal Steak seasoning for flavor.  It was delicious!

I made this quiche today, but my way.  After reading the reviews, it was obvious that some changes needed to be made.  I used 2 1/2 cups of fresh broccoli, bell pepper, chopped mushrooms, a mixture of sharp cheedar and mozzarella, one whole red onion (they are not overpowering and cook up well), added, to taste, some lemon pepper while the veggies were sauteing.  I used 1 1/2 cups of milk because I made two quiches.  I added the cheeses to the egg mixture, left out the extra butter, and cooked for one hour.  My husband, who does not eat quiche even ate some.  Great taste and held together very well!!!

Easy and very tasty recipe. I did what another reviewer said which was to put the cheese on the crust first and then top with the broccoli mixture so as not to make the pastry soggy. My husband loved it!

I don't think this is any EASIER than any of my other quiche recipes, but it's definitely delicious!  Made a whole wheat crust which really enhanced it.  DEFINITELY use fresh veg - it makes the whole quiche!

I agree w/ the other reviews. This is only a great 'starter' recipe. I used a homemade crust,5 eggs, about 1/2 c. milk,and FROZEN veggies (peppers, mushrooms, & brocolli). I buy & freeze sale items.I microwaved the veggies.A deep dish pie plate has to bake about 50 min.& my filling only filled the dish about 3/4 full.No sogginess for me. This was my husband's breaksfast this morning and he liked it. I will use this basic recipe over and over. thanks!

I used this recipe to make mini-quiches -- they were delicious! I just grabbed a box of Jiffy to make the crusts, and pressed them into a 9-serving cupcake pan. Then I followed previous reviewers in pressing cheese into the crust to prevent wetness. It takes more cheese than the recipe calls for (more surface area), but it's worth it.  Half the recipe for the broccoli filling and the egg-milk topping filled my mini-quiches perfectly. They were done in 25 minutes at 350, and I sprinkled a little Parmesan on each one 5 minutes before they were finished. Yum!

Love it! I use a frozen pie shell from the store. Could not be easier, and yet it seems impressive to company. Also, quite budget friendly as well since eggs are cheap. Great for a brunch. Pair with a mimosa, and you're all set.

This was a really good recipe. I modified it a little bit to make it lower in fat, but it still turned out really good. First of all, I really like the combination of broccoli and asparagus so I used half the broccoli and subsituted the second half with asparagus. I prepared it the same way though. I also used 2 eggs and 3 egg whites instead of the 4 eggs. If you do this I would suggest using a cup of milk instead of 1.5 cups because mine was a little watery and didn't solidify quite as much as I would have liked. I also had to cook it for 45 minutes at 350, rather than 30 mins. Turned out to be delicious though!

I wasn't really impressed with this... the quiche that I've always had (from others baking it) had a more creamy and rich flavor... this just didn't do it for me.  I'll probably use either cream cheese or heavy whipping cream next time and maybe add some bacon, but not as much garlic.

Even adding extra garlic and frying the veggies in bacon fat and added the bacon it turned out bland.  I also sub'd swiss cheese for the mazz.  I gave it 2 stars because it was easy and held together well.  ALICK's advice about the cheese raincoat was invaluable!

It's easy.  Quick and easy to be exact!  Excellent recipe to add to or change ingredients to your liking.  I did have plenty to make two quiches as others have also noted.

This is awesome!  I made the following changes:  used 2 1/2-3 cups of broccoli, doubled the minced garlic to 2 tsp. and used 2 cups of Italian blend shredded cheese.  I served it with freshly baked muffins and a variety of fresh fruit.  Yum!

We weren't impressed, honestly. I made the recipe as given except divided into 2 pie crusts instead of one. Just didn't have much flavor.

I used 3 eggs and 1 cup of milk, next time I will reduce the quantity of milk. I omitted the 1 tablespoon butter at the end. And I used a frozen deep dish pie crust, which I baked for about 5 minutes prior to adding the mix. I had to cook it for 45 minutes because the middle was still liquid after 30 minutes. Delicious quiche nonetheless. Next time I will add bacon or ham.

I made this for my family on Christmas Eve.  It was easy, however, everyone in my family said it was "o.k." So I probably won't make it again.  Maybe too much onion and not enough cheese.  ( I am guessing).

From reading the reviews I amended the recipe to 3 eggs and 1 cup of milk, also used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella and it did take 50 minutes like some other reviewers noted. We added chicken in it too - was a great dinner! First time I made it and will be sure to do it again!

I have never attempted to make a quiche before and this turned out awesome!  I only used 1 head of broccoli and it turned out great.  I also didn't have any mozzarella cheese so I just used sharp cheddar.  Oh, I also used red onion.  It had a GREAT flavor although hubby said it was a little watery??  I might try decreasing the milk a tad... Also, after sauteeing I didn't have enough butter left in the pan to pour into the quiche...I must have done something wrong??  It turned out great and I plan to make this again and again...

My husband and daughter both "don't like quiche"....but they loved this recipe and had two pieces each!  I cut the onion down to 1/2 a cup and the broccoli to 1 cup and it seemed just right to me.  Also used half and half instead of milk.  I used a nine inch pie plate and had too much to use it all...it would probably be perfect for a 10" pie plate.  This puffed up so nicely and wasn't runny at all.  It DID take 55 minutes to set the middle.  I would make this again!  YUMMY!

Easy to make and pretty good.  Took 40 min. to cook rather than 30.  Wish I would have pre-baked the crust for a few minutes as it was soggy.  Otherwise was delicious.

I thought that this quiche was excellent. I added a bit of Tony Chachere's to the egg mixture for seasoning. It was soooo good!! We HATE spinach in my house, so it was nice to find a new way to eat boring ole broccoli. The only thing I might change for next time is to bake the crust for 10 or so minutes before adding the filling. Anyway, great recipe and we will make again and again.

I loved the quality of this quice and got raves from my roommates for sunday brunch! Although I added 4 slightly boiled asparagas cut into small pieces in the mix, also placed small thin cheese slices ontop and broiled the quiche at the end for a few minutes until bubbly and golden brown.

This quiche is very flavorful, especially the next day. However, we found that it took much longer to bake, about 1 hour; may depend on the oven. It was quite runny, which may have been the cheese, but we wanted to be sure the eggs cooked through. Also added cooked, chopped ham, which was excellent.

Very good and easy to make.  My version tries to be a little healthier and took into account everyone else's suggestions.  First, I made Stephanie's Basic Flaky Pie Crust with one part whole wheat flour and four parts all purpose flour.  This was pre-baked at 450F for 7 minutes.  Second, I added a large bell pepper and stir-fried all the vegetables with PAM spray instead of butter.  Third, I only used one cup of cheese, 3 eggs, and 1 cup milk, and omitted the melted butter for the liquid ingredients.  Finally, I combined everything and poured everything into the pre-baked pie shell.  It took about 40 minutes in the oven and it was delicious!

This was bland.  I did not have a problem with wetness like other reviewers, but I followed the reciped exactly as written.I will probably add something like Mrs. Dash the next time just to give it more "zing" or change cheese to a pepper jack.  Lastly, it took my quiche about 45-50 minutes to finish baking.

This was my first attempt at quiche and it came out wonderful!  I only used 3 eggs and 1 cup milk as suggested by some other reviewers and I used pre-made pie crust and frozen broccoli.  I also used cheddar instead of mozzerella. The flavor was wonderful and not at all soggy.  I will make this again for sure!

This was a delicious! I changed it up a bit as suggested by the other reviewers. Added 3/4 c more broccoli, cut down the milk to 3/4 c, cut down the onions to about 1/2 cup, added 4 slices crushed bacon, 2 eggs and 3/4 c egg beaters, mozzerella on the bottom of the pie, and chedder cheese on top. Baked for an hour. Turned out great! i brought this to work and people ended up getting seconds! thanks!

This was my first quiche and I was surprised at how easy it was! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious! My only tip: use a deep dish pie crust! I cheated and used a regular store-bought one and some of my egg ran over the sides.

As written, this recipe would have been 3 stars. Luckily, I followed the other reviews and used 3 eggs instead of four, 3/4 cup of milk(I would use 1 cup of milk if I were to make it again though), and 1/3 a cup of extra broccoli. I also used a mix of Swiss and mozarella but only used one cup(even 3/4 would have been fine). To further lighten it up, I only used about a ts of butter total. With all those changes, the quiche( which none in my family had ever had before) was still a little too heavy for my family's tastes(We never combine eggs and cheese) What's ABSOLUTELY critical is either a good homemade pie crust or just skip the pie crust altogether. Don't use a storebrought pie crust unless you've managed to find a good one because in my experience they've all been nasty.

This was great!  I had to make some tweaks though.  1/2 onion is plenty (and 1/2 Tbl. butter works fine, and is lower in fat that way).  I used a 5 oz. tub of lower fat feta instead of mozzarella (just a personal preference), and mixed in a sprinkle of dried basil, savory, oregano, chives, and marjoram spices to the feta.  I used only 1 cup of milk (1 1/2 cups would've made the dish overflow).  I decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. (feta has salt already), and used only 1/4 tsp. pepper (1/2 would've been too much for me).  I also left off the Tbl. butter - just not needed, and only adds to the fat.  I baked for 50 minutes instead of 30.  Great base recipe - thanks for sharing!

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews first. I used frozen broccoli oops, made it too moist. The flavor how ever was wonderful. I added bacon at my husbands request and it paired well. Next time I will fresh broccoli as called for.

I pressed half the cheese into the bottom crust before filling as another reviewer suggested and it was a fantastic idea that I will do in all my quiche's from this point forward.

I cut out the butter and used chicken broth  instead to soften the broccoli.  I used twice the amount of chopped (very small) broccoli.  I used fat free half and half to mix with the eggs; also added a few dashes soysauce.  I sprinkled the cheese over the pie after baking it for a bit.  This is a keeper.

Very yummy!  Next time I think I'll make it with cheddar cheese though, and definitely put the cheese on TOP of the pie crust before the veggies.  I didn't like burnt cheese layer on top.

The veggie flavor was amazing though.  I don't know why others said it was bland because it was full of flavor.

This recipe is fantastic!! I am new to cooking, and having just moved in with my boyfriend so I'll have to do better than cereal for dinner. I actually forgot to buy a pie shell, so I almost gave up until on the whole thing until I found a super quick and easy pie crust recipe on allrecipes.com!! I also used 1% milk to make it a bit lighter, but it still came out really delicious!! One thing I am thinking of adding next time is diced cooked bacon to the egg mixture. This has given me a lot of confidence in the kitchen!!

Quiche itself could have had slightly more flavor, but was a nice comfort food. And the cheese layered over the crust was amazing; great melt in your mouth texture.

This was the first quiche I've ever made, and it came out perfectly! I followed another user's advice and made a layer of cheese on the bottom of the crust before I poured the rest of the ingredients in, and I had no problems with sogginess. I highly reccomend this recipe, especially for amateurs like myself!

So easy and sooo tasty!!!  I followed one of the other reviewer's suggestions and fattened up this dish with a little diced bacon and 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese.  I also used half and half instead of milk and skipped the butter completely.  I was using a frozen pie shell, and ended up with enough filling for 2 quiches.  My initial plan was to freeze one for later, but my husband and I loved this quiche so much that we made quick work of the leftovers!

Since I was making an 11' quiche, I used 4 cups fresh broccoli, 6 eggs and about 3/4 cup milk.  I made sure the broccoli was dry before the saute to help keep the quiche from becoming soggy.  I followed the cheese rain coat suggestion but used colby-jack. I also upped the salt and pepper, especially the salt.  I used a homemade crust and added some oregano to the egg mixture.  I had to cook it for 50 minutes before it was really set.  Next time I think I'll add some nutmeg too.  Very tasty with the help of all the reviews.

Perfect flavor. Only change was that I only added 1/2 the amount of salt and pepper recipe called for.  I found there was not enough of the egg mixture to cover broccoli or fill pan.  I let the quiche sit for 5 minutes but it still did not set well for serving and fell apart when transfering to plate.  I wonder if more eggs and less milk would help firm up quiche.  Will definitely try again.

Was very good but I ended up with it taking closer to an hour to cook and the bottom of the crust was a bit too wet. Im not sure if this was the fault of me, the recipe or the crust. Its happened before with other recipes so Im thinking it wasnt the recipe. Anyway, over all it was very easy and quite tasty and I will make it again, so Im giving it a 5.

This recipe is almost perfect as is, I followed the recommendation of another cook who advises to press the mozerella down over the pastry and it worked out like a dream!  A HUGE hit in our family and a regular brunch item now!

A nice, basic quiche. I cut the liquid down to three eggs and one cup of milk. It needs a large, deep pie pan to fit everything.

This was the first quiche i've ever made and it was great! Took the advice of other reviewers: used frozen pie crust and baked it for a few minutes before filling, used a combo of cheeses and a little cayenne for added zip. Had to bake for an hour before the middle was cooked. Surprisingly delish and easy!

I have made this recipe countless times for company......and just for my husband and I.  We love it!  I usually add an extra cup or more of the broccoli/onion mixture and cook the broccoli until just tender.  I also always add cheddar cheese in place of the mozzarella.  VERY GOOD!

Great, but only four stars because this actually makes two regular nine-inch pies, or one very deep dish pie. We cooked one and froze one for later. Wonderful!

This is a good recipe, but a little bit too wet.  I'll make it again, but next time use less milk.  I used 3 c. broccoli and reduced-fat mild cheddar cheese.  I'll also try it with a shredded potato crust next time.

This was the first time I have made quiche and I am so glad I used this recipe.  I added ham because we are a family of carnivores and they all LOVED it.  I did not find it watery at all.  Used home made pie crust and fresh broccoli.

I made this along with a quiche lorraine for my vegetarian daughter.  The other recipe called for a prebaked piecrust, so I did the same with this and it was not soggy at all.  I chopped the onion broccoli and some red pepper and carrot (for colour) in my food processor to make it quicker to cook.  It was very good, my daughter really enjoyed it, but I prefer ham or bacon in my quiche.

Overall it was good. I would add an egg next time and cut down the veggies. There was too much filling and my quiche came out kinda watery and not all that eggy. But it tasted good nonetheless. Good recipe, just needs tweaking

I thought this quiche was quite good.  I followed the recipe as is except I added some leftover deli ham and a pinch of red pepper.  I don't understand the complaints that the quiche is watery.  I used fresh broccoli and had no problem.  It took 55 minutes to cook until set!  Also I used half and half.  I find if I use my regular milk (skim) it turns a bit watery.  Great basic recipe to use with different fillings!  Good work!

Ok I altered this recipe A LOT.  Left out the brocculi entirely and added mushrooms, red bell peppers, and more onion.  It was awsome!  A good base  to add whatever you like best.  Will definatly make again.  I should have made two pie crusts because there was enough to fill two, had to throw some out :(  But imagine if i'd had the brocculi, it takes up much more space.

I had to laugh at the number of reviews observing how this recipe was totally altered by all the raters, but given 5 stars!  Well, I won't give it 5, only 4, because I followed one of the raters suggestions and added 1 more egg (for 5 total) and poured the mix into 2 pie shells, and baked them for 45 minutes.  Everyone here liked it, and I have another to go around in my fridge.

Quiche took at least 45 min to cook, so was not ready at dinner time.  Also, why are there so many five star ratings that then list the many changes made to the recipe?  If you change all the ingredients and the cook time, then it is not the same recipe!

Great recipe.  My husband, who usually doesn't like quiche or vegetables, liked this.  I, too, found that the ingredients didn't fit into one pie shell, so I made 2.  I prebaked both store-bought regular shells for 10 min. prior to adding the sauteed veggies.  I also used frozen broccoli, and had a little egg/milk mixture leftover.  It took 45 minutes to cook the two simoultaneously.  Will definately make again.

Excellent quiche recipe.  I did make some changes - I never added any butter to the eggs.  I used 2 cups of cheese, a mixture of swiss, mozzarella, and sharp cheddars.  I added 4 strips of turkey bacon cooked crispy and crumbled.  I also used about a 1/2 of onion (seemed like an awful lot) put 2 med. sized spoonfulls of garlic and added mushrooms and extra pepper.  Turned out really yummy and put it all in one deep dish pie crust.  It did end up needing to cook 50 minutes to be done.

This was actually a very good base for quiche. I prebaked the pie shell for about 10 min then let it cool while I cooked the veggies. I added 6 slices cooked and crumbled bacon. Only used 3 eggs, half and half in place of the milk, swiss in place of the mozzerella and I added some nutmeg with the salt and pepper, oh and I didn't add the melted butter. SO overall very good many compliments. Thanks

Great quiche recipe!!  I added crubled bacon & 1/2 teaspoon of mustard & left out the onion.  My husband does not like quiche & he went back for seconds & love it!!  You could do this recipe with spinach, I think the possibilites are endless!

This is a good base recipe.  I changed so many things though that I pretty much made up my own recipe, which I plan on submitting on this site.  But, to give credit where due to this recipe -  I used frozen cut broccoli instead of fresh (easier, and i had it on hand).  I also used a Deep Dish Pie Crust which I pre-cooked for 10 min.  I also cut back on the milk to 3/4 cup and used 3 eggs.  Still had too much filling, but that could be because of all the extra goodies I added.  Husband gave rave reviews, had thirds, and doesn't even normally like quiche!   This is a good recipe for first time quiche makers.

I made a quiche, and it was easy!  I was so excited.  I followed others' suggestions and used 3 eggs and eliminated the melted butter.  I also added diced ham.  I found I had to bake it for a whopping hour and 15 minutes, but it turned out very well - some added bread crumbs on top gave it a nice crunch.  I thought it was a little too rich - I might try it again with egg whites and only 1 yolk.  I also used a store-bought crust - Pillsbury.  It didn't cook completely on the bottom - I'll pre-cook it next time for 10 minutes before filling it.

Great quick supper. I used two frozen pie crusts - the recipe worked to fill both (shallow round shape). I used frozen broccoli florets, chopped. I adjusted liquids based on others' comments to 3 eggs, 3/4 cup milk. It was perfect and finished with a golden crust.

YUM!! I made this with the "no roll pie crust" from this website and it was SO good! I did modify the recipe to my own liking.  I used sharp cheddar cheese and added crisp crumbled up bacon in addition to the broccoli.  The advantage of using your own pie crust, I molded it to a cake pan so it was nice and deep.  My friend came over and as I was chatting to her, I forgot to put in 1 and a half cups of milk, just 1 cup*LOL* no matter, it turned out perfect!  I baked for only 40 minutes and the consistency was just right! thank you!~ I will be using this recipe for a good base!

Yuck.  I think this would've been MUCH better had the egg mixture been combined with all the ingredients prior to putting it all in the pie crust.  The crust was soggy too, I think it should've been baked a bit before filling.

This quiche was really good - I also added crumbled bacon and changed the cheese to 1 cup mozzarella and 1 cup monterey jack.  I had enough to make 2 quiches one slightly larger than the other. My 8 year old daughter loved this quiche and asked me to make it all the time.  It was fairly simple.  I put all the veggies into the food processor to chop them fine and to have less mess.  I used a home-made pie crust that uses oil instead of shortening and no need to roll out. I Will definately make this again.

A great basic quiche.  My husband who thinks I forgot how to cook was very impressed.  Wherever the recipe called for butter I spritzed some olive oil instead.  I also used frozen broccoli florets to get out of chopping.  Although this was good it lacked something in the way of flavor.  As weird as it may sound I wanted to add chili powder.

This quiche is great. The only alteration I make is to use 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 sharp cheddar cheese. I usually make it night before, then just reheat it the next morning. I took it to work for a holiday brunch and several people asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe!  I use this every time we have a brunch with family & friends.  You may have to adjust your cooking time depending on your oven and altitude, but otherwise it is a great guideline for a wonderful quiche.  You can mix and match other ingredients you have on hand as per your own personal taste, you just can't go wrong.  I have tried this with Feta cheese instead of the Mozzarella and it was FABULOUS!  Give it a go! Thx Sara ;)

Looked great, tasted ok. Found the onion I used was too sweet and it made an odd contrast to the rest of the egg mixture.   Also, made about 2x too much, and was left with all sorts of left over egg mix--if I make this again,I will cut in half the proportions.

I didn’t really like the consistency. To much broccoli the egg didn’t hold together.

Had to cook the quiche for MUCH longer before it set.  I took it out after 45 minutes but it probably could have used five more.  Nonetheless, it was quick to make and tasted great.  I cooked it for a brunch wtih some girlfriends--all vegetarians--and they loved it.  My friend Laura ate so much of it we nicknamed her 'fatty.'

This was only eh...reading the other reviews, I have many of the same complaints.  There was too much egg stuff; I had to make scrambled eggs out of the rest of it.  The broccoli and mozzarella didn't do it for me as ingredients, it could use some ham, more veggies, and maybe some Cheddar cheese.  Also, it needed a lot more time in the oven to stop jiggling.  I'll make quiche again, but I'll only use this recipe as a basic guideline.

I served this for brunch and made 2 different quiches. One just like the recipe, the other I used spinach and mushroom instead of the brocolli.
It was great! Everyone liked it.

This is a good base recipe for a simple quiche.  I used to hate quiche but was asked make some.  I found this recipe and I am now a quiche fan!
I have made this a few times now with different variations on the veggies and cheese. All were delicious!
I do find that this recipes makes too much filling, so I add a bit more and make two quiches instead. That's why it doesn't have a higher rating.

Very good, but due to the vegetables at the bottom, the crust was very soft in the middle.  Overall, great tasting though.

I made this last night, and reheated for breakfast this morning. Turned out great! I added fresh basil from the garden, mushrooms and bacon. After breakfast my boyfriend asked if we can have it again tomorrow!! I will defiantly make this again, as it was a big hit!

Great recipe, a keeper for sure.  I used a jiffy crust, and next time I plan on using a refrigerated crust (saves alot of time!!).  I think I will also reduce the milk to 1 or 1 1/4 cup.  It is a great and very quick recipe that is going in my recipe book!!  Thanks for the ONLY quiche recipe I will ever make!  Juli

Great flavor without all the fat from heavy cream.  I even omitted the additional butter at the end and it tasted great.  I had bit of problem with it setting up, maybe because I used low-fat mozzarella and low-fat milk, but tasted 
x-lynt!

Very good. The recipe made enough filling for an 11" deep-dish (or with extra broccoli and onions another whole 9" pie). Otherwise, very easy to make and prettily baked, as claimed.

This quiche was delicious and a big hit with everyone.  I added a little bacon to the veggie mix and sprinked a few crumbs of it on top before baking...just for some added pop! :-)  It was very good.

Delicious! I made this using leftover fresh cooked broccoli, and it turned out wonderful.  I also sprinkled the broccoli mixture with some parmesan cheese before adding the mozzarella, and I increased the mozzarella to 2 cups.  Even my 3 year old loves this, and she likes to help assemble it, too!  Thanks!

I've made this quiche several times & always a winner!  I add cauliflower with the broccoli, don't bother in sautéing the veggies, just make sure the pieces are small & same size.  I ALWAYS ADD 3 extra eggs as we LOVE our eggs.  Delicious, delicious !

Most of the 4 & 5 star ratings have major modifications!!!! The recipe ended up needing 2 deep dish pie crusts. I used 2c fresh broccoli & 1/2 an onion. It was still wet... cut back the milk. Needed the full 50min for bake time.

This was "ok". A large pie plate is needed (more like a fruit pie plate) as the ingredients ran over and the cooking time needs to be a little longer so it won't be under-cooked in the center.  I don't see this as a five-star and there are other recipes that are far better than this one.

With any recipe on ALLRECIPES, I always read thru many reviews.  I don't want to waste time making a dish that doesn't taste good to my liking or is a complete flop.  So, sometimes I'll tweak it based upon other's experiences to avoid this.

WHAT I LIKED:  This quiche is simple, easy, and can be used as a good "base" to switch out the veggies/meat/cheese type.  For this, I used broccoli, onion, both cheddar & Italian blend shredded cheese.

WHAT I CHANGED:   I didn't use melted butter.  I used 1 cup fat free half/half.  I used 1/4 large white onion.  I used 6 large eggs. 

PREPARATION:  I did what other reviewers suggested, I baked cheese in the bottom of piecrust (frozen crust shell) to keep the bottom firm.  I cooked the onion, veggies, butter, garlic in pot until soft.  In the other bowl I beat the eggs very fluffy, added garlic salt, dash of salt/pepper, bacon crumbles, and cheese.  Then I combined the veggies to the egg mixture and stirred.  I noticed the batter was nice & thick, so didn't worry about cooked consistency.  I filled the pie shell to top.  Placed on cookie sheet just in case it dripped over.

COOK TIME:  I baked at 350 for 45 mins.  Let completely cool on stovetop.  Placed onto cake plates to serve.

REVIEW:  This quiche turned our perfect!  It's fluffy, flavorful and looks good.  I'll be using this exact method next time alternating the veggies!

As other reviews point out, this is too watery. I followed the recipe as written, but it never set. I cooked it for 60 minutes and the top browned, but as the image shows, when I removed 4 pieces, enough liquid remained to fill in the missing places 1" deep. Several guests refused to eat it, but I made my boys eat it. The taste is fine, but 1 onion is pretty strong.

I substituted chopped cauliflower for broccoli and added 1/4 lb. sausage for added flavor. Salt and/or pepper to taste. Used half & half for milk and only needed 1/2 cup. A delicious way to enjoy cauliflower. Used lots of onion, garlic & cheese as I do for many recipes. Yum!

I used a combination of extra sharp and monterey pepperjack cheese in place of the mozzarella.  Will make this dish again, however, I'm going to use a little bigger pie plate as it started to spill over as it baked.  I put a cookie sheet under it so I wouldn't have a baked on mess in the oven to deal with.

I used frozen broccoli- thawed it and chopped it up.  Added some Fresh Mozzarella cheese and a bit of shredded colby jack  to color up the top.  Added small slices of grape tomatoes. Yummy!

I’ll pretend the recipe called for 1/2 cup milk and almost 1/2 cup evaporated milk. 1 1/2 cups milk I thought was way too much. I used 5 eggs and a full smaller onion.  I put cheese on top and the bottom and  poured egg mixture on top.   My kids both  loved it!

This was a delicious quiche recipe! My 7 year old loved it! Because quiche is so versatile, I opted to use fresh (not frozen) baby spinach in place of the broccoli. I also added about 1/4 cup or less of crumbled turkey sausage (cooked) for a heartier dish. I baked it for 40 min, but had to pop it back in the oven for an additional 10 min because it was really runny. I will still make this in the future and it was still delicious, but even after a total of 50 min, the bottom was very watery. Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe overall!

I've made this several times with various vegetables. I'm familiar enough with the basic ratios of ingredients that I can adjust the needed liquids to match variations in veggie size and amounts and how they cook down. That means that this is a forgiving recipe that's hard to mess up.

I made this as is.  (I bought a pre-made pie crust and defrosted for 15, baked for 15 covered in foil) and then assembled the quiche.  It was yummy and a big hit.

Would add bacon or ham and bake it in a deep 9inch pie crust. I had a bit of extra batter left. Was a hit. Kids liked it. Will make it again.

I did make some adjustments per previous reviews...2 1/3 cups broccoli, about 2/3 c onion, ~1T garlic, 1c milk, 3 eggs, 1T Montreal chicken seasoning . Pressed in cheddar “cheese raincoat” first, spread veggies, top with more handfuls of cheddar, poured eggs and milk, baked at 350° for 50 minutes.

I used a deep dish 9” frozen Pillsbury crust. I found that this recipe overflowed my crusts. Next time I will only use 1 cup of dairy. I did sub the milk for half and half to make it extra rich.

We loved this.  We went Keto with it and did not include the crust and added bacon and spinach.  No issue with wetness as the fresh broccoli was cooked in a wok under high heat (which tends to dry it out).  We also used the bacon grease instead of butter.  Lovely bacon flavor throughout.  And we carmelized the onions under low heat before adding the broccoli.  This mellowed the onions and added some sweetness to the dish.  Net (for the whole pie) 1760 calories of which 920 were from fat.

So yummy!!!  I had everything in my fridge but the cheese, so I used what I had...havarti...and that was perfect!  I added a bit of nutmeg to the egg mixture and a few shakes of Cholula hot sauce.  Baked until just set and let it sit for about 5 minutes before diving in.  It's a good thing I'm the only one home so nobody can see what huge bites I'm taking.  You won't regret making this one!

The only change I made was adding leftover ham that I had on hand.  I used a very small onion and baked it for 50 minutes.  I love quiche so I was very happy with it.  My husband, who claims he does NOT like quiche, ate about half the pie!

This is a great quiche recipe. Leave out the onion and garlic; they're not necessary. The broccoli version is very good, but I have also made many other variations... My favorite so far is ham and spinach. So delicious!

Glad I put this on a cookie sheet, as a good amount of it spilled over. Did not puff up as expected. Overall, the taste was good, but wouldn't make again.

This is a good recipe but I thought the recommendation for milk was too much.  And I saw in the comments that others had made the recipe and it was too soggy.  So I put 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1 and 1/2 cup milk and it turned out perfectly.

I used cheddar instead of Mozz for more flavor.  Definitely watch what size dish you put this in or your cooking times will be all goofed up.  My first one was too thin because of the dish size and thus the egg mixture was overcooked by the time the crust was done.  I would definitely put this on the bottom shelf of the oven as well to get that bottom crust good and done.

This Quiche gets the most compliments at my New Years Brunch! I do make a few changes to suit everyone’s tastes = use 1/2 mozzarella 1/2 sharp cheddar and add either ham or bacon. It bakes up fantastic and waits patiently on the counter for guests to arrive and make up their mimosas before we sit down to eat.

Yummy!  it came out perfect.   Not too wet, or dry.  I did steam the broccoli first, then added everything to the pan.  It smelled so good we cut it and ate it without taking a picture!   lol!

I have made this but I put a little spin on mine, I cut the milk down to a cup and I made a broccoli and cheese the first time. The second time a couple of sausage and egg, you can get so creative with a quiche and my family loves them!

I added some asparagus, because it was in the vegetable bin. I used a mix of cheeses, and some chopped turkey, also because they were in the meat and cheese bin.  Turned out quite tasty.  Nice flexible and easy recipe.

I love this simple recipe. The only changes for me is I blend up the sautéed ingredients (broccoli etc) after I sauté them in olive oil (not butter). Then I mix it in with the milk and eggs. I have to make it this way because I have picky twin toddlers who will only eat their greens if I blend them up. If you don’t have picky toddlers, it’s really not necessary to change the recipe. So good!

Personally, I loved it! I feel it had lots of flavor, just be sure not to over cook the broccoli and then you will have a nice bite in your mouth and texture. My hubby made the comment, "I think it is good, but would be better with bacon in it!" but then it is no longer vegetarian.... MEN! Gotta love em and their fondness for all things pork!

This turned out great! The only thing I changed was adding a bit more seasoning to the broccoli- salt, lemon pepper and some herbs de Provence. I also patted the cheese into the crust along the bottom in case it was soggy (it wasn’t) and mixed the broccoli and cheese together to make it more evenly distributed. This was my first quiche so I have to say I was glad this was so easy and tasty!

I followed this recipe clearly. Like others said, it was way too much liquid and it made such a mess in my oven. Also I had to cook it almost 2 hours for it to set. The consistency was not like quiche at all. One review said it was like a messy egg pudding on the bottom but looked like quiche on the top.  I would COMPETELY agree and also add a soggy crust to that.  I was very VERY disappointed.

This thing was pure milk and onion. Cooked for 45 minutes and still not well done. Ended up throwing it away. Don’t understand how a baking time can have a difference of 20 minutes. At 30 minutes mine was still raw.

This quiche is a keeper.  It was so easy to make and quite tasty.  My only change would be to use 3 eggs, as it had too much egg mixture.  And yes, I would use different vegetables now and again for a change.

Overall this recipe is just OK. I like how simple it is.
I love onions, but one whole onion seemed a lot for a quiche, so I used 3/4.  Even that was too much. I would agree with another review I read that recommends 1/2 of an onion.

WAY TO MUCH ONION! I even took out some and it still was to much. I believe that is what made it so soggy on the bottom, because mincing onion and then cooking it makes it more Watery. I even did a blind bake to the pie shell first because some people said it was soggy. I think I am also going to experiment and put a blend of cheese on the inside bottom of the pie crust. 

But this recipe needs to be changed and lessen the onion in it.  Then there would get better reviews.

I definitely did not use mozarella cheese with brocolli.  Cheddar cheese is the only way to go.  it tastes so much better, as mozarella has no taste at all

This is a staple in my house for breakfast now. I’ve made it several times and it’s so good! It also freezes well (uncooked). I just tried a lighter option this morning without a crust for a healthier option... and it was just as amazing!

We loved it .  The next time I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables (broccoli, carrots, water chestnuts, etc).  I cooked the vegetables in the microwave following  the instructions on the bag and added them to the quiche.   It was even better and is now my favorite quiche recipe.

It was good but 1 tsp salt is way too much.  Cut back to 1/2 tsp.  I had too much liquid for the frozen pie shell I used so I will cut back on the milk by 1/2 cup next time.  My husband loved it.  A lot of onion but that was fine by us because it gave it a sweet taste.

If you are using a glass or ceramic pie pan, its' best to cook your pies closest to the bottom of the oven. They don't get as soggy this way.

It was easy and delicious!  I would have to make two changes: I would use 1/2 cup minced onion and a DEEP DISH PIE CRUST as I could not fit it all into the 9 inch one!

I've made this a few times now. You can adjust the onion and garlic to taste. I use fresh ingredients and cooked for 50 minutes. Let sit for about 10-15 before eating to let the juice absorb. I eat on it all week. Love it.

The only change I made was to not add the extra bit of butter. It was very good but not outstanding. And yeah, it was a little soggy.

This quiche was amazing!  I used a deep dish pie shell and read a few of the reviews before making this recipe.
The bottom was not soggy so I wouldn't worry about that at all.
I used five eggs and one cup of half and half, a dash of fresh grated nutmeg and used a combo of extra sharp shredded cheese and gruyere...broccoli, onion, garlic and added fresh mushrooms.
I baked at 375 for 45 minutes.

Easy, not having to bake crust.  Made it with plain yogurt, more egg whites, added mushrooms to the sauté, plus Cabots aged cheddar!  Yummy.

This was delicious and healthy! So many recipes use condensed milk and heavier cheeses. I did make a few changes...I always make my own crust.( I like Ina Gartens recipe.) I baked my crust for 5 minutes before filling.  I cut back the onion to 1/2. 
I will definitely make this again. Thanks for Sharing:)

Yes, I customized it. I'm thankfully past that beginning to cook stage and able to see a recipe and modify to my tastes without worrying it'll come out funky.

I took a cue from Marim's review and used 1/2 onion (chopped & sauteed), 3 eggs, and 3/4 cup of milk.  I also used a 14oz frozen broccoli bag (microwaved in the bag for about 5 min to thaw) and 3oz white cheddar (next time I'll use 5-6oz) and a frozen pie crust (left to thaw while I was preparing everything else). Added some fresh ground salt and pepper (no garlic) and it was good to go! Took about 50min at 375F but it was a beautiful color and tasted delicious. I'm definitely making this again!

And all I really needed was the amount of milk/eggs to use. With that known, I feel confident I could use that base and make any type of quiche I desire!

Excellent dish!  However, I will say that the instructions provided have to be interpreted through a lens of common sense (unfortunately between my girlfriend and I, there was ZERO common sense to be had).  


The onion we minced was rather large, and probably was a bit too much, quickly filling up most of the tin.  The eggs we used were "jumbo" sized, resulting in a large amount of egg mixture.  The 9" pie crust was placed slightly off-center, so when folding the edges over to make the crust one side was smaller than the other.  


All of these factors combined resulted in the pie tin being over-filled with liquid, and during the baking process one side of the pie crust gave way and the liquid flooded out like a dam giving way to a lake.  After cleaning it up and removing some extra liquid from the quiche, we put it back in to bake and it came out GREAT (albeit with a misshapen crust)!  The onion flavour was definitely strong, but not too overpowering.  


Lessons learned: 
• If there's too much liquid, you don't have to add it all.  Microwave the leftover liquid, it's basically scrambled eggs.
• You don't need to use a whole onion unless you have a really small onion.  1/2 to 3/4 of an onion is plenty
• Make sure your pie crust is centered on the tin, so that the crust will be evenly high all the way around.
• Common sense is not something I am familiar with.

I usually read the reviews before cooking but didn't here.  Sure wish I had!  I KNEW the milk seemed like way too much and it absolutely was!  Took forever to cook through and set.  I would recommend five eggs and only about half a cup of milk, one cup if you like more fluff.

This quiche was very good with a few minor changes.  I used just one cup of milk and it fit perfectly in a deep dish crust.  I used half mozzarella and half cheddar.  There was a little too much pepper in my opinion.  I also used half of a medium onion, as opposed to a whole onion.  I will make again with less pepper and cook for 45-50 min.  Be sure to let set after taking out of the oven.  Delicious!

Great recipe.  I ended up reducing the milk to only one cup because my pie crust was too full.  I also used Coby Jack shredded cheese because that is what I had on hand.  I also used a frozen pre-made pie shell.  This is a keeper!

Terribly proportioned ingredients in this recipe require severe modifications witch that it constitutes an entirely new recipe. You much milk, garlic, and onion is called for, and it requires about 45 minutes cooking time. Would not make again without severe modifications.

Made a double batch - used 2/3 of the milk and still had egg/milk leftovers so next time will cut the milk even more. Otherwise, it was delicious and easy!

The taste of the veggies is actually very good. But when I cooked it 50 minutes, it was still soupy. So I cooked it another 30 minutes and it still was very wet. I can only imagine that 1 1/2 C of milk must be a typo. Wish I had thought to cut down to 1/2 or 3/4 C like other users but I did not read the reviews before making.  The raving reviews must have made lots of changes to the recipe.  What a bummer.

I made this according to some of the comments I read which included the following changes: 3 eggs, 1 cup cheese and half a cup almond milk. I put half the cheese on the prebaked ready made crust and mixed everything else together and poured into crust. It turned out perfectly. I think I could have easily added the 4th egg but do not add more liquid and it doesn't need the extra butter! I used a small head of broccoli, green onions and jalapeño monterey jack.  This recipe is very versatile! It cooked in 50 minutes.

I overdid it with some herbs I used. I suggested to those who were eating it to use a touch of cranberry sauce with it to cut the herby taste. It was lovely! I shall make this one again.

Having to sauté the veggies before adding them was a little more involved than expected, but the assembly was easy enough. The result was delicious. My husband would have given this 5 stars if it had bacon in it!

Loved it!  I used mozzarella cheese slices on the crust before adding the broccoli mixture to help prevent soggy crust.  I also used some shredded cheddar on top.  Delicious!  It doesn't keep long in the fridge.  Best to eat it fresh the day it's made.  I'll be making this again sometime.

Followed actually recipe (unlike many 5* reviewers).  A soggy, dull mess.  I would suggest 1/2 cup less milk and 2 more eggs.  I love onion, but I would reduce onion to about 1/2 cup (or half an onion).  Cook for about 45 minutes.

I also like to pre-bake my crust about 10 minutes at 450 so it's not soggy with dishes like this.

It vanished last night! I made it pretty much exactly as directed, though I found the quiche needed more time to cook. I also highly recommend pre-baking the crust.

I made this, as written, except I used 1/2 the broccoli and I used evaporated milk, as that's what I had. I chopped the broccoli very small before cooking it with the onion and garlic, so it wouldn't make the quiche watery. I also warmed the milk slightly before adding it to the egg mix. My old recipe had that, and I went ahead and did it, even though I don't know the purpose. We really enjoyed it.

Good but made some changes. To address the soggy comments in others reviews - I made 2. The first I baked the crust first on 450 for 7 min before proceeding with rest of recipe steps. The second I didn't and just put half the cheese in the bottom of the pie crust before adding Eggs and broccoli. Both came our the same and perfect, so it's a waste of time to pre bake the crust. Also I used 5 eggs for each one and only 3/4 cups of milk. I used half sharp white cheddar and half manchego cheese. Convection oven bake on 330 for 50 min. Let rest. Serve with frisée salad. Delicious.

I found this recipe online and thought it looked really easy and good.  I had some broccoli, cauliflower and asparagus that needed to be used.  Cooked it, put it in deep dish shell.  Put cheeses on top, and when I went to pour liquid over it was way too much.  So it is baking now and I'll see how it turns out.  It seems like I may need to bake it longer.  The taste will be fine I'm sure.

It turned out quite good and tasty.  I blind baked the crust first and followed another reviewer's suggestion to use the cheese as a buffer for the egg/milk mixture.  I only had frozen broccoli (fresh that I had frozen myself) on hand so I made sure to remove as much water as possible first and sauteed it separately from the onion and garlic so it was not soggy.  I also used a mixture of Monterrey jack and cheddar cheeses instead of mozzarella. Finally, I did add the melted butter to the egg/milk mixture as directed but would not do again as I ended up soaking up the extra butter that was pooling at the top of the quiche once cooked

This was very easy and quick, however I found it to be a little watery.  Next time I will add a tablespoon of flour to the egg mixture... I believe this was due to the fresh broccoli.  I also changed out the mozzarella for cheddar and it came out great.  Nothing was left :)

The suggested cooking time was way way off...cooked it 60 minutes, and still was soggy. Way too much onion, by about a third. Tastes good though....may try again and blind bake the crust first....

Was an easy recipe to follow . . . tasted good!
I put a layer of cheese on the bottom but the crust still turned out wet. Next time I would pre-cook the crust slightly!

This was really good. I didn't make any changes this time, but I think next time I'll prebake the crust a little bit. My eggs were set and the top was golden brown, but the bottom crust was a little underdone.

Should have read the reviews before making it.  I used fresh broccoli and ran into many of the same issues others did.  Too many ingredients for the pan/crust... soggy (should have used 3/4 cup of milk instead of 1.5 cups).  The quiche was still tasty, but the consistency was disappointing.

I made this without making any changes to the recipe.  I put it in the oven for 45 minutes and I wish I had left it in the full 50 minutes because I would have liked it to be a bit firmer.  Overall, I thought it was really good, but I did add some cheddar cheese on top of my own plate because I thought it needed a little more cheesiness.  Definitely will make this again!

I did not make any changes to this recipe and it was delicious. I did use a smaller Vidalia  onion. I used a 10 inch ceramic deep dish pie plate to bake this in and it filled it perfectly. It did take 60 minutes bake. I will place part of the cheese on the bottom next time as the crust was cooked but a little soggy. Don't let a few negative reviews, from people who probably don't know what they are doing in the kitchen, stop you from making this Quiche.

So easy and can use the veggies and cheese you have in the frig. Great template for a savory and tasty quiche that's done in about 40 minutes and you have a nice warm dish for dinner with a green salad. Highly recommend !

This was so delicious and easy! I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the onion, half an onion is plenty. I also cut the milk back to about 3/4 cup. I used a little more garlic because I like the flavor. I also used extra cheese, I lined the bottom of the crust with 1/2 c mozzarella. I let out the melted butter by accident. It all fit in a large pie plate and I cooked it for 30 minutes. Very tasty and I will make again!

made this in a square 2qt casserole dish because i already had all the ingredients running around and didn't want to buy anything else. 

This is the first time i've made quiche and it turned out pretty good, though i did make a few changes and will likely make a few more next time. 

Things i did this time:
-Made my own pie crust cause square dish
-5 eggs instead of 4(because the dish is deeper)
-Extra onion
-Extra garlic(like, double)
-Double the pepper

Things i'll do next time:
-MORE PEPPER(double was NOT enough)
-Less milk, probs just 1 cup; it was just TO moist for me personally

This is so simple! But I did change it up a bit. 3 eggs, 3/4 milk, 1 cup broccoli, 1 cup chopped spinach, 1/2 an onion. I put them in muffin pans (it filled about 11) perfect for my family breakfast and cooked them for about 40 minutes. I sprayed the pan with nonstick and they just slipped right out!

Excellent flavour.  Added some Italian Sausage and made into 2 pies so that we had a hearty supper quiche.

We loved it!  A note of caution, though.  We used a store bought frozen pie crust, and didn't realize it was slightly sweet till we noticed some sweetness in the quiche.  Strange  combination, a slightly sweet pie crust and a savory quiche.  Next time, I will make my own crust.  That way, I know what I'm getting!

Made a half portion, keeping all ingredients proportional and made this in my toaster oven.  Only omitted the melted butter in the final step.  As is, pretty good!  A tad salty, so either I'll decrease salt or leave out salted butter next time.  Bottom dough was not soggy, but might try some previously mentioned tips to get it a bit crisper.  I let it cool for an hour after baking for 35-40 min.   It set well and was not too liquidy.  Overall, very pleased.

I added ham to the mix and used 3/4 of a white onion. I used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. Also I had plenty of egg/milk batter left so my recommendation is make a little less than what the recipe calls for.

I made this crustless, spraying my glass pie plate lightly with cooking spray. I bought extra-large eggs by mistake, so I only used three (and still scaled the recipe down to three eggs). I combined the mozzarella with some cheddar and monterey jack cheese that needed to be used up. I put aside about 1/4 cup to top the quiche before putting into the oven. I tossed the remaining cheeses with four tsp of flour (did successfully with another recipe) and layered that on bottom of pan. Then topped with combine sauteed broccoli and onion and egg/milk mixture. I also used 1 1/4 cups of whole milk.  Baked at 375 for close to 40 min.

Came out delicious!  I didn't have any milk so I substituted 3/4 Cup heavy cream + 3/4 Cup water.   Worked Out great.  I baked it for a good 50 minutes at 350 F, until set.  Everyone loved it!  Making it again today, per family request.

Used spinach instead of brocoli,  reduced the amount of onion,  and used garlic salt rather than minced garlic.  This was my first ever quiche,  and it turned out great.  I cooked it for 40 minutes.

I was looking for a broccoli mushroom quiche after I had an excellent one at a little mom and pop breakfast/lunch cafe. This one was awesome! I used 5 eggs and 1/2 cup milk based on others reviews of it being too soggy. I also added 1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms, chopped to the broccoli/onion/garlic mixture when cooking on the stove. I pressed 1/2 cup of mozzarella into the crust and sprinkled another 1/2 cup on top of the veggies in the crust. Baked for 45-50 minutes, the center was perfectly set and there was no sogginess. We had this for breakfast and lunch for a week. Even my meat loving husband loved this. It is delicious.

Came out great! Added crumbled bacon, and didn't do the garlic. Also used a frozen pie crust. Otherwise, followed recipe. Took about an hour to cook through, which I expected. Will definitely make again!

This recipe filled two Pilsbury premade pie shells. I substituted half and half for the milk. It took 65 minutes to bake through. I cooked the pie shells before adding the filling. I covered with foil to bake. Many raved about it!

Excellent quiche! 
I normally mix my vegetables and cheese into the eggs then pour it into the pie crust but I like this method way more. It ensure an even distribution of veggies and cheese!
I made broccoli salad earlier that day and decided to use the chopped up stems to make a quiche. I also included mushrooms and tomatoes. 
I also only had three eggs left so I poured those in before realizing I forgot to add milk to the mixture... I only had a bit of milk left so I drizzled it over the eggs and popped the quiche into the oven for exactly 50 min. I ate one slice of quiche before deciding that I liked my quiches to be a bit more burnt so I popped it back in for another 10-15min.

Excellent!  Used bacon, sauteed broccoli, mushrooms, onion and garlic in the drained bacon grease and melted butter.  Six eggs mixed with 1 cup milk and half and half for 2 quiches...  Cheese pressed to bottom of pie plate on the crust.

The top came out to dark. It didn't look anything like the picture.The filling ran over the crust. I also added some small pieces of scotch bonnet peppers to give it a little spice.. I think this recipe could have made two quiches and not one.

This recipe was delicious! I used this recipe as the basis of making my first Quiche. I used about 1 and 1/4 cups milk because some reviewers said what was listed was too much. I mixed in some cheddar cheese with the mozzarella. I also added garlic powder, onion powder, and crushed red pepper to the egg mix because I like a lot of flavor. it definitely needs the full 50 minutes ! I will definitely make this again.

OK... I didn't read the reviews first, which was a mistake. But after 1.5 hours, this was mostly set so I sliced it and put it back in the oven for another 10 mins. It looked delicious... I like really browned cheese. I wanted to give it one star but when I finally tasted it, it was really very tasty. But I was beyond starving, so I'm not sure if that was why! I will definitely try this again just with way less milk. :D

Once I combined all the ingredients in the 9 inch deep dish pie crust, not all of my egg mixture would fit!  I don't even know if enough of the egg mixture got in it to even solidify.  Thank goodness I was making two quiches (the other was chicken) or the left over egg mixture would have went to waste.  I think the onion was too much.  Needed only half of an onion.

Great recipe. Very easy to make.  I added mushrooms. I would also recommend using a deep dish pie crust if you like a lot of vegetables. I used a regular crust and put too many vegetables in.  Then it overflowed when I poured the egg mixture on. Totally my own fault. I am not a skilled cook, and thought a quiche was way beyond my culinary reach, but this one came out great! I will definitely make it again!

Used 1/2 tsp of onion powder & 1/4 tsp garlic powder for the onion & garlic.  Used light butter. Also, I used smoked salt instead of regular salt. Center was set for me in 35 minutes. Crust was not quite as firm as I hoped. Next time, I will bake a little longer. Delicious, pretty quiche! Thanks!

We made this for a late dinner and found it amazingly quick and easy to prepare!  I kept mine simple using just cheese and onion.  So delicious and easy to do.

I followed it exactly and added some diced ham. Even after adding a layer of cheese at the bottom it was pretty wet. So maybe next time I'll do less milk. Also needed more baking time! Otherwise, good flavor!

This is the perfect recipe to use as an outline and make changes: i addd spinach, mushrooms, etc. I also don't cook veggies first and I find they come out fine after 45-50 min of baking.

I made this last night for dinner and everyone loved it. I changed it up a little by using swiss cheese, added cubed ham steak and baked it for 45 min. I used fresh broccoli and it came out perfect! Will be making again.

I made the recipe as is and wasn't impressed.  The overall taste was good (we like onion), but the crust was still raw after baking.  Next go around I will press cheese into the crust and bake it for 7-9 minutes at 350 as suggested by other reviews.  I think I will add an extra egg next time also.

I adapted it as well as made it as a crustless version.  I diced up three small potatoes, minced four mushrooms, and doubled the broccoli. Then I added three eggs and 1/8 cup flour to the mixture.  I also used cheddar rather than mozzarella, but I only used 3/4 cup. I baked it in a 9x13 dish for 30 minutes at 360.  The kids and hubby applauded! So, that means it's a keeper!

This was a great recipe!  I do agree with some of the other reviewers where they say it was too soggy. I used fresh broccoli and followed the recipe to the tee. Next time I make it I'll probably cut back on the milk-egg mixture. Hopefully that will help!!

Make sure you use fresh ingredients!  I used frozen vegetables, cooked, frozen shrimp; thoroughly thawed all, cut up and put the shrimp in the sautee pan with garlic and onion for a quick seasoning/sear, patted all down with a paper towel.  30 mins later, it was still uncooked.  I had to keep brushing the top and crust with butter to keep it from burning--and after an hour, its was just done, brown on top and the crust underneath was a bit soggy.

This recipe calls for too much milk. Cooking time is too short too. Baked for 40 minutes and microwaved just to get food on the table. Came out runny with fresh broccoli as well. Keep looking for a broccoli mushroom quiche recipe. This is not a good one.

I made this tonight. Turned out delicious! I didn't have a 9" round pan so I used a brownie pan, which did screw up my pie crust usage. I "made" my own pie crust using a box of Jiffy pie crust mix, which will make enough dough for 2 crusts. After some surgery I ended up with bits and pieces left so I threw them in slices on top. Definitely use fresh broccoli and don't worry about chopping or mincing (onion, garlic) perfectly. Everything is hidden in the quiche anyway. Mine came out fluffy and flavorful, despite there not being that many spices in recipe (only salt and pepper). This was so easy and yummy I will have to make it again

This is an easy recipe to follow for making quiche.  I did not have any broccoli so I used fresh baby spinach in it's place.  I feel like with this recipe you could substitute many different veggies or meats.  It does take much longer than 30 minutes for baking however.  Mine took closer to an hour.  It was a good dinner for a cool fall day.

I used fresh broccoli and only half the called for onion.  I thought the combination of the two did not taste good together at all.  The part I thought was the worst was using shredded mozzarella cheese. I left the quiche in about an extra 20-30 mins because it wasn't browning at all however the cheese still didn't melt!! I used kraft mozzarella and not only did it not melt it caused the quiche to be watery BC its a highly processed cheese. If I were to make this again I would use a better cheese (maybe like a cheddar) and just broccoli.

This is a good basic recipe for Quiche, but it doesn't come out right from the directions provided. There is a lot of water, and I used fresh veggies. I had to cook it for about an hour to cook off some of the excess water(plus dabbing it with a paper towel even after all that extra cook time.) It turned out edible, but not as good after all the fuss. If I were to try this recipe again, I would cook the broccoli and onion(and use half an onion-a whole onion is WAY too much. Trust me, it turned into an onion Quiche.) a little bit longer to try and cook out some of the water. I would have put the cheese on the bottom(it's hard to cut when all the cheese is on top because it creates a brown crunchy layer). Everyone said to do that to help keep the crust from getting soggy which doesn't matter, the water has to go somewhere. I always try the recipe as instructed first though; it was not the best idea. I would use 3 eggs and 1 cup of milk. I'm not sure what pie crust the poster used? I got a 9" as recommended- it spilled through the holes in the crust and overflowed all over the counter(partially my fault,I should have poured slower), and I still had leftover liquid. Line the oven with aluminum foil on a lower rack, to prevent burning material on the oven's heating elements. Overall, it came out OK. I will move on to other Quiche recipes though.

This came out better with frozen broccoli. You really need to cook it well and get as much moisture off the broccoli after it is cooked. Otherwise, your piecrust gets soggy. Went over well with the family.

I don't know how to cook or bake, but this recipe really was easy! I substituted garlic powder for the minced garlic, but the rest of the recipe was really idiot-proof. I didn't have to worry about messing anything up, so that was nice. I highly recommend for husbands who can't cook (i.e. me) and want to surprise their wives with a nice breakfast!

Overall, way too salty.  I should have known better, but with the butter and cheese additional salt was not necessary.  Also, the garlic was a little overpowering---maybe a dash of garlic powder would have been enough.  I also thought there was too much butter (there was a shimmery layer of it on top after cooking.)  I like the basic idea of this, though, and might make again with some changes.

Basic recipe is great!  And thanks to all who added suggestions! I steamed veggies (added carrot along with brocolli, onion) instead of softening in butter. I added Braggs Sea Kelp Delight seasoning to liquid instead of salt/pepper. I used the pie crust recipe on this site and lined it with cheddar cheese. Baked for about 35 minutes.  Fabulous! And can be altered so many ways...even my husband LOVES it!

Made it exactly as written, except I had no onion so just added some dried minced instead. My teens and I thought it was delicious. I used partially cooked, chopped, and drained frozen broccoli and it was fine.

This was really really delicious, I took ALICEK's advice and also used only 1/4 C of onion. This is a recipe that I ll enjoy experimenting with, thank you!

Excellent recipe. I made it exactly as the original recipe states, and it is delicious. I left out a star because it needs to cook longer. After 30 minutes, it was was a puddle on the bottom. Either cook it for longer, use less milk, or both. Unless you like your quiche dripping wet, in which case carry on.

I did not read the other reviews before preparing this dish, which is unusual for me.  As mentioned by another reviewer, this dish is extremely flawed as written.  I will not make that mistake again.

I've never made a quiche before, just thought it was easier to buy them in the store.  Tried this one for dinner and it was WAY BETTER than anything I could buy.  Doubled the amount of broccoli so it was more like a broccoli/cheese pie than a quiche, but it was perfect.  A keeper.

Definetely needed to cook longer.My crust was still a little uncooked on the bottom. The other solution might be to precook the crust. Other than that you can add anything you want and make it your own, just don't pile too much in the quiche or it won't cook as fast as it should.

It was okay but not well executed for the time factor. There probably needs to be a warning on this recipe to NOT USE FROZEN broccoli. I did and the pie came out a bit wet. Flavor was excellent however.Only change I made was adding cooked chicken and a splash of hot sauce for a bit of a kick. With all of that said; will try this again using FRESH broccoli. No doubt it will need to bake 45 min too. The trick of putting the cheese on the bottom will be tried too. Don't give up on this recipe however.

This was good. A little salty, so I'll cut the salt next time. I also found it a bit runny but after leaving it in for an additional 15 minutes, it was fine. Also, I recommend a deep pie dish if possible...if not you'll have leftover egg/mlik mixture.

First time making a quiche and it turned out fabulous! followed the recipe to a 'T'. Not sure why people had mentioned there was leftover ingredients - if you adjust the recipe according to your number of servings it should work out fine. Definitely use fresh broccoli, not frozen. I will try different variations the next time around :)
Thanks for sharing!

Overall, the flavor was excellent and very easy to make.  Good for weeknight cooking or something quick to whip up for brunch.  Yes, it was a bit soggy on the bottom but that can be fixed with experimenting.  I made 2 minor changes; I used 1/2 cup of diced onion (instead of 1 whole onion) and I added 1/2 cup of finely diced carrots just to add a little color into the mix.  The basic recipe is a keeper!

Great quiche! Unlike some other reviewers, I don't think this recipe had too much onion - just make sure you truly "mince" the onion and sauté it for long enough that it gets sweet. I agree with the others that there is too much liquid - the bottom of the crust got soggy, and I had a bit of an overflow disaster in the oven as the egg puffed up. Next time I will probably do 2 or 3 eggs and just 1 cup milk. Also, if you like your quiches to be veg-focused, you might want to add more like 2.5 cups broccoli, but make sure to adjust appropriately so it doesn't overflow!

This quiche is very good, however mine was not vegetarian. I had four pieces of cooked bacon, leftover from a previous meal, so I chopped them up and added them. I chopped the broccoli and onion quite fine, used TJ's 21 seasoning and a sprinkle of Lawry's chile and garlic spice instead of the black pepper, and only put in 1/2 tsp of salt. I subbed pepper jack and sharp cheddar cheese as I didn't have mozzarella. I used a 9" deep dish pie plate and didn't have any issues with all the ingredients not fitting. The cooking time was way off for me. Instead of 30 min. my quiche took 55 min.

I have made this a few times but changed it up and did 3 egg whites, 2 eggs, kale or spinach instead of broccoli... amazing.  Also - I buy a 2 pack frozen crust & this mix makes 2 quiche... or I'm doing something wrong :) love it tho!

The recipe was easy to follow though i used what was on hand. I used a bag of thawed broccoli/cauliflower mix that i food processed down a bit. I used the four eggs but only one cup of milk and no extra butter. I had mexican cheese mix on hand so that is what i used. i didn't use much as i don't like things too cheesy. I needed forty-five minutes for the quiche to set.

As a base recipe, pretty good.

Replaced eggs with egg beaters and baked for at least 55 minutes in my oven before the middle was set. Not sure if that's because of the egg sub or my oven temp. Great versatile recipe!!

Good.  My son ate 3 big pieces.  I liked it and it was easy enough but I wouldn't make it again.  I did change a few things so my enthusiasm might be less because of those changes..  I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic.  All of the egg mixture would not fit in the dish and I'm not sure if I mixed the eggs well enough.  I used one cup of heavy cream and 1/2 a cup of 2% milk.  It took FOREVER to cook.  I enjoyed the leftovers more than I did the fresh out of the oven taste.

I made this for my turn at making dinner for my family during the week, and everyone loved it! My friend happened to be over that night, and he said he would try it, but I could tell he thought it was going to be gross. He actually went back for 2 extra servings! This was an awesome meal.

Yummy, its a family favorite, the only thing I did to add a little pizazz is add bacon bits.. The combination of the two is delicious.

This is fantastic! I've made it twice already, once w/chedder cheese and once w/bacon and mushrooms. You can do so much with this recipe! I will make this again and again!

This is the first quiche I have ever made and I loved it. My kids loved it too. My husband doesn't like onions so he wasn't crazy about it. I may use a little less onion next time as there was quite a bit. I did use cheddar cheese instead though. Overall, a great recipe and will definitely use again.

I was looking for a way to use up some broccoli, heavy whipping cream and a pie shell left over from Thanksgiving.  I thought this would be an adequate way to use them, but it turned out to be one of the best quiches I've ever had.  The only change I made was to use heavy whipping cream instead of milk.  This will be a new Meatless Monday staple in our household.

I was really happy with how this came out but I didn't use onion bc I didn't have one. From what I've been reading, I was better off not using one. It didn't come out soggy, however the baking time was way too short. I added a cup and a half of shredded cheddar on top of the shredded mozzarella. It came out great. Keep it in the oven until the top starts to brown and you should be all set.

I gave this 3 stars because it worked perfectly with the modifications suggested by other reviewers, but I suspect the original recipe would be quick runny.  With 5 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk it turned out great.  I also added some goat cheese to give it a bit of extra flavour.

Ok, I'm good!! I had not created a quiche for around 30 years. My husband took over the cooking 'chores' while I was working and he retired. Now, I am retired and he is not well. I have rediscovered the kitchen and now....this website. I loved dragging my laptop to the counter and the ease and subsequently awesome quiche this recipe this one turned out to be. The best part, leftovers make a terrific breakfast.

A very attractive dish in a glass pie pan! I did a slight variation of the ingredients by adding some peppered bacon-and no mozzarella so used cheddar & provolone cheese instead! Then-Oopsy-poopsy! I forgot to add the melted butter so drizzled it over the top! Yummy and so pretty!

I actually did not have any issues with sogginess. The filling WAS a teenie bit too much for the crust. I just left a little out so it wouldn't spill over while cooking. I made homemade pie crust and did not prebake it and it still cooked ok. My issue with the recipe was the flavor. I found it to be bland...but that just may be a matter of taste because I prefer foods with strong flavors and spices. Also I felt like it was too eggy. It was kind of like eating a broccoli-onion omelet with a crust. I give it 3 because it is easy and OK.

So, I followed the recipe to the T and it came out perfectly! I put the quiche mixture into a 10x13 casserole dish and it did not come out liquidy at all. It was very light and fluffy. I made it 2 times in one week, it's that good! The only thing is, that 30 minutes is too little time for the quiche to cook. It took me about 50 - 60 minutes. Other than that, it was delicious.

I made this last night for myself and my husband and we loved it.  I slightly changed it to suit our tastes by doing a mix of cheddar and mozzarella and by adding in bacon.  Was even great leftover.

OMG ... made this quiche for dinner tonight, but I did make some substitutions, did not  have fresh broccoli, so I used a 12 oz bag of steam fresh broccoli cuts, which I microwaved and added to pan. I also used 1/2 cup egg substitue(approx. 2eggs) and 1 reg. egg. I also used 3/4c 2%milk and combined 1/2 mozzarella/1/2 cheddar cheese. I pressed 1/2 of the cheese on bottom of pie crust , added the broccoli, and the egg & milk, topped with remaining cheese. Bake 350 deg. for 45min and it was awesome. Will definately make again and again.

Took way longer to cook that I hoped!  I made 2 so I knew it would take longer, but it was about an hour.  I added "real crumbled bacon".  Very tasty...but plan about 2 hours before you are eating!

Like many of the others, I too had a soggy crust, even after following the directions to a "T". So I tried this a second time but cooked my crust first and had amazing results. Thank you!!

Very tasty! However, this took much longer than 30 minutes to bake (closer to 50 minutes).  Also, I bought a 9" deep dish crust and ingredients were left over. Will use less than 1.5 cups of milk next time.

I just made this recipe for dinner tonight.  I give it a 5 for taste, but it took at least an hour for it to cook all the way through.  I made this almost to the written directions, but made a few changes.  I added some chopped ham, and instead of mozzarella cheese, I used cheddar cause I thought it would taste better with the broccoli .  Other than taking longer than expected, very yummy!

Very good recipe. It is indeed esay, and very tasty. I do have to agree with another reviewer tho. It did take 45-50 minutes, not the advertised 30. But I've never had a quiche take the recomended amount of time in my oven. Still, overall very good.

My father in law doesn't like broccoli, but he ate all of his breakfast when I made this! It was so flavorful, I probably would have eaten it cold, but it sure is yummy warmed back up in a toaster oven. Do yourself a favor and make two of these at a time, because you'll want to eat it for more than one meal.

I made some of my own changes as well. I didn't really follow the the amount of ingredients closely.  Instead, I just threw in what I thought, and used white cheddar and swiss cheese.  It was delicious! I can't wait to make it again.

I've made quiche many times before with all kinds of cheeses that came out pretty good but this one was really YUM! I did make a change on the cheese though because my intent was to use up gruyere that I had. Per other reviewers, I sprinkled parmesan on the crust before topping with the vegetables (onion, broc and red pepper), used 4 eggs with 1 1/4 cup half and half - my quiche dishes are deep dish so the amount of liquid was fine. I think it was the gruyere that really gave it the great flavor.

I found this to be a really tasty recipe but one the proportions were way off.  I had a ton of egg/milk mixture left over and there is too much onion.  If I had to do it again, I would probably use a third the amount of milk for a more eggy quiche.

My changes: whole wheat crust, bacon fat instead of butter, cut the cheese in half. It took me 40 minutes to bake instead of 30.

Husband (not so fond of broccoli) loved it, 2-year-old loved it (but she loves broccoli), and I loved it. I can see how some people would think it's too much onion, but our family loves onions so it was just right. I had no problems with a soggy quiche. It was tender and yummy. :-)

The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because I believe there was a mistake in the recipe. People should know this. I wonder how many people wasted extra milk and egg because the amount of milk it calls for is way too much. If you want to follow the recipe this way, then make 2 quiches but you'll probably want to double up on the broccoli too. Anyway, though I had to throw away about a cup of milk and egg mixture, the resulting pie (which I did bake for 50 minutes as others said instead of the 30 minutes) was very tasty.

I made this twice: both times I stuck to the original recipe.  The 2nd time I changed the cheese to a combo of swiss & cheddar.  Both times I was disappointed in the overall result.  It needs more of a custardy texture to be a quiche.  The layering doesn't seem to work.  I'm hoping I can find another all veggie quiche.

I used a pre-made pie crust with this recipe. The recipe made WAY too much to fill the crust. So it ended up being way too much broccoli and onion, not enough egg (plus, it was a waste of my eggs). Then it took closer to an hour to bake rather than 30 minutes (and I DO have a separate thermometer in my oven, so I'm confident the baking temp was on-target). Overall not a BAD recipe, but could use some refining and tweaking.

This quiche was wonderful!  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that I had too much egg mixture to put in the pan.  Other than that it was great!  And I did not have the cheese, but that did not seem to make a difference!

Not impressed to find that the amount of milk on recipe actually will cause it to overflow :(  I later read other reviews and saw that a few people had decreased the amount of milk to 3/4 cup...would make it again BUT with LESS milk for sure!

Wonderful! I actually found that there was enough filling for 2 piecrusts, so I just topped it up with a bit more of the egg/milk mixture. This is surely a keeper!  I am uploading a pic of the pies for all to see :)

Brought it to a potluck today it everyone raved about it!  I didn't have a pie crust and used a packaged pizza crust that I had and parbaked it before adding the filling.  Still turned out great!

This recipe is AMAZING basically as is! And it is so easy. I didn't change the recipe like most people do. All I did was cut the amount of broccoli down, and I used only 1/2 an onion (I felt like anymore broccoli and onion than that wouldn't fit in the pie crust). And also, mine had to bake for like 50 minutes to cook through the middle. 30 was way too short. Other than that, the quiche came out amazing!

Good recipe but I made a few adjustments that will turn this dish into WOW.  First, it will take more like 45 mins to bake rather than 30. I also used 1 shallot and 1/2 onion instead of 1 whole onion. Switch out swiss cheese for that extra sharpness rather than mozz. And finally add a pinch of nutmeg for a touch of French flavors.

I love quiche! But this is really easy and fast to make ahead! Some of the family doesn't care for broccoli so I parted the pie in half and added other ingredients to the other side and made two in one!

Delicious!  Used a little less milk (1-1/3 cups) and baked about 45 minutes in my convection oven.  Combined cheddar and mozzarella, used fresh broccoli finely chopped.  Husband loved it!

This recipe was wonderful. My quiche came out fluffy and flavorful. The timing was right on - just 45-50 min from start to eat.  I do suggest boiling the broccoli for ~4 min before sauteeing with the onion and garlic. Also, I would use 3/4 of a small onion - do not use a whole large onion as it will overpower the other flavors.  Overall easy, tasty and good for you!

I didn't need to change anything.  I did leave out the 1 Tbsp of butter just because I didn't think it was necessary.  I also did not use a pie crust because my husband has a gluten intolerance and I didn't have time to make a gluten free pie crust.  The quiche turned out great even without it.

first quiche recipe, and it's really good. it's a nice vegetarian dish. The only problem is that it overflowed, so i need a bigger pan/ to stretch out the pie crust better next time. it's not especially appealing looking, but still very yummy.

Absolutely delicious. nice and light and fluffy. Did not use garlic or onions, and replaced sauteed broccoli with grilled broccoli, zucchini, and squash that were soaked in olive oil and a blend of herbs and spices. definitely one of the best quiches I've ever had.

This was excellent and very easy to make!  I took some others' advice and added some red bell pepper and cooked it for 50 minutes instead of just 30.  I also used a mixed cheddar/jack cheese mix instead of mozzarella.  Turned out fabulous and got lots of great feedback at an Easter brunch I brought it to.

I did not care for this recipe. I only added 1 cup of cheese, but the rest of the recipe I followed exactly.  It was like quiche on top and milk/egg/pudding consistency on the bottom. Not trying this one again.  Let's go with Betty Crocker!!!

This was really good and I'm rating this on how I made it.  I had to use what I had on hand and this is what I did.  I used onion, red pepper and zuchini sauted in butter along with some left over ham.  Used 4 duck eggs with heavy cream.  Seasoned with season salt and spinach and herb mix.  Used a combination of monterey jack and colby cheese.  My teenage girls even ate it and loved it.  I diced the veggies very, very fine and  omitted the garlic.  This is a very versatile recipe.  Thanks.

i did not have onions . i added a little spinich which i probably didn't drain enough. i added the cheese after i poured on the milk egg mixture so it just melted on top. maybe i cut it too soon, it was a bit juicy probably from the spinich and melted butter. but very good. learn from my mistakes.

Added more broccoli.  Prebaked pie crust 10 minutes after brushing with dijon mustard before adding filling.  Adjusted measurements to scale down amount based on previous reviewers comments.

I made this recipe as-is and had some problems so I'm only giving it 3 stars.  The main problem is that the egg mixture was too much for the 9 inch pie crust and it leaked out.  Also, I was lazy and used a store-bought crust instead of making my own.  That was a mistake, although I can't fault the recipe for that.  The crust was very doughy and fell apart.  I'd try this again, but with some changes.  I'd make my own crust and maybe cut back on the milk so the filling sets up a little better.

Delicious! I made this for the 1st time today. The only changes I made were: I pre-cooked the pie crust for 10 minutes (to rule out any sogginess), I added ham, 2 more eggs & an additional 1/2 cup of milk so I can make 2 quiches. It worked out great. Hubby loved it & so did my girlfriend who came for lunch!

My husband said this was the best quiche he'd ever had! I added 1 bell pepper, only used 1/2 of a small onion, and sauted them in 2 TBS olive oil. I only had 2 eggs, so I used those and 1 C evaporated milk. The quiche was fantastic!

I thought this was pretty good, however, I tried to make my own pie crust.. and it was horrible... to the point where I told hubby he didn't have to eat it.. ... so basically, I ruined it for myself.. but the Quiche itself was pretty yummy. Oh, and my pie dish wasn't deep enough.. so it ran over.. it was a huge mess... hah!  Oh well.. live and learn I guess.. Thank you for the recipe, I'm sorry I didn't do it justice ...

Yum!  Made according to directions, except used frozen chopped broccoli and had a bit of Feta cheese that I added with mozzarella.  A little messy as egg mixture dripped over edges, but very delicious!  Would make again!

My changes: 3/4 cup egg beaters, 3/4 cup milk and added 1 teaspoon chicken bouillion for flavor. Layered all cheese on bottom of pie crust, then added cooked veggies and topped with egg mixture. Big hit at a babyshower.

I followed as listed and it worked fine.  I did need to cook an additional 10min since it was still watery in the middle. (I did used frozen broccoli and drained most of the water out and added garlic while cooking broccoli)

Great and easy to make! You can make substitutions as you see fit. I made a whole wheat crust for mine and added some more spices. I do agree with pressing the cheese at the bottom of the crust first before adding egg mixture. Will definitely make again!

The amounts are way off.  I used a 9" deep dish frozen pie crust and it overflowed in my oven and made a huge mess.  This was after reducing the milk to 1 cup as was suggested. Yes you can reduce the liquids further, however, I suggest you reduce all amounts by about 25% for a more balanced pie, unless you want far more broccoli mixture than egg.   Didn't have a problem with soggy crust, but I baked for 50 minutes.  Wasn't even close to done at 30 minutes.    It was tasty and looked good when it came out, but clearly the recipe needs some adjustments, which is why I only gave it 3 stars.    BTW I subbed cheddar cheese and added some crumbled veggie bacon which I think improved the flavor a lot.

I made this last night with limited ingredients in my kitchen.  I made it exactly as stated except I didn't have a pie crust (so I guess I made a fritatta?)It was good and the eggs were light and fluffy.  My only issue was that I got a lot of water in the pie plate when it was done.  Not sure where it came from since the broccoli was cooked with the onions.  Mine was set and cooked in the 30 minute time frame.  The only thing I can say to the reviewer that it didn't set in that time is all ovens are different.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good and fairly easy.  Needs a fair amount of salt and pepper if you're into strong flavors.  Mine turned out a bit watery, perhaps because I used soy milk.

This recipe was very tasty! I used olive oil instead of the butter in the first step and omitted the butter completely in step 3. I used 1 small onion and frozen broccoli, which I parbroiled and drained on paper towels to get the liquid out. I used 1 cup of milk and 3 eggs, and also patted some mozzarella on the bottom of the crust to prevent the crust from getting soggy. I combined the rest of the cheese (mostly mozzarella, but I substituted about 1/4 C cheddar- I think it really benefited from the bit of cheddar) with the eggs and milk. It overflowed in my oven, making a huge mess, so next time I would leave some ingredients out and make a smaller one in addition, but it was still really delicious!

This was very light.  It took longer than 30 minutes to bake, and for the last 20 I upped the temp to 375.  I added about 1/2 cup less cheese.  The recipe also made more egg mix than the pie crust would fit.  I will probably use 1/2 cup less milk next time.

Recipe is good but does need a few changes. I cut the milk back to 1 cup, turned temp on oven up to 375 and cooked it for about 45 mins (30 mins is NOT long enough). I have read that one onion is to much, I don't like onions and removed it all together. Easy dinner!!

My husband and I enjoyed this quiche very much.  My only changes were the substitution of cheddar for mozzarella.  I placed half the cheese on the crust before filling.  I also sprinkled the top with some parmesan.  I found it necessary to bake for 50 minutes.  I will be baking this again tonight with a Mexican blend of cheeses because that's what I have on hand.

This recipe was fine.  There's no reason to layer the ingredients like the recipe says.  Add the veggies to the egg/milk mixture.  Also, next time I may cut down on the amount of milk.  Just not neccessary.   The recipe does take abou 45 minutes to cook.  Definately not done at 30.

I really liked it.  I followed another person's instructions regarding the cheese coat on the bottom of the crust and cut down on the egg/milk mixture like someone else suggeted.  It was very good.

We found this recipe to be on the plain side. I feel it was because it has mozzarella cheese when we are used to a stronger flavored cheese. Mostly a personal preference thing. Following others advice I used less milk and I put in 1/4 c. cream. I baked for 40 minutes and though it is not a great recipe for the most part it is pretty good.

Absolutely delicious!! I was tempted to give a 5, however, as one review stated, one whole onion is too much and yes, the crust was soggy and there was butter on the bottom of the pan when I made my first cut. I also had to bake it longer, eyeballing it to ensure my crust would harden. I will def make this again with a few changes, and with a second one to have enough! My husband, who is a "meat and potatoes" guy loved it! Kudos to the submitter!

I used this recipe w/ the oil pie crust recipe and made individual quiches in my muffin pan. It turned out really delicious, next time I think I'll ad some bacon to really rev up the flavor.

Taste was good but it was very soupy, and there was too much pepper. The recipe never stated what size pan to use (I used a 9 in pie pan), and covered the edges with foil and then removed it for the last 10 min of cooking. I never did get the quiche to set all the way.

Had a little bit too much liquid after reducing the amount of milk.  It took awhile for the center of the quiche to set.  It tasted pretty good.  I think it would be better if cheddar cheese were added.

This recipe was very good. I did one thing different.  I only used 1 cup of fat free milk instead of the 1 cup and 1/2.  I also cooked the pie crust for 10 mins before I added the incrednats.  I will make this again..  very good.

it was very yummy!  it took a good bit longer to cook, though.  I think part of the issue was what I thought wasn't firming up enough was actually partly the cheese.  I think it spent an extra 15-20 minutes in, but even still, it wasn't over cooked or burnt.  everyone loved it!

The filling was very good, but the bottom crust was rather soggy.  If I make again, I will prebake the crust and then protect crimped edges with foil after filling.  I liked using a mix of cheddar and mozzarella for a little extra flavor.

I followed a couple of the suggestions of other reviewers, and used less milk, and used fresh broccoli, putting the broccoli into the crust, fresh, not cooked, only sauteeing the onion and garlic.  I also add diced ham and use a mix of shredded jack and cheddar, not mozzarella, just a preference.  I go by the words, "when the center is set" to tell if it is done, not a strict 30 minutes in the oven.  This is VERY good.  I always make a whole wheat pasta salad with artichokes, olives and Italian dressing, for a side dish for this quiche.  After making it, I end up with a bit to clean up in the kitchen, but for the nights following, all I have to do is pop a slice of the quiche in the microwave and have pasta salad out of the fridge, easy dinners for the nights following.  Plus, after this quiche being in the fridge at least overnight, the flavors blend or get stronger afterward...it tastes even better heated up as leftovers.  thanks for the recipe.

Super Easy recipe and tasted very good. I used a blend of mozarella and cheddar cheese. It was a little bland for me. Next time I would like to add more seasoning like onion powder, and a dash of cayenne pepper. I baked for 45 minutes. This recipe makes 2 quiches.

My first attempt at a quiche... I didn't love it, but I have to blame that on mistakes I made in my attempt to modify the recipe. 1. I used a prepared frozen pie crust I hadn't used before, that turned out to crumble at the slightest touch. 2. I used way too much onion. 3. I beat the eggs and milk together, so the finished texture was more like tiny bits of scrambled eggs with bits of broccoli and onion, set in a pie crust... it didn't hold together, even after refrigerating leftovers. I want to try it again though.

This is a great recipe as is !!!
Easy and Tastes Great, I have made these 8 at a time for the senior center and they all love them...The Cook has taken the recipe from me and made it for his family and is now in rotation at the center...I have made this many many times and comes out great everytime.I have to make my friend 2 when I make them, she freezes one as do I until a few weeks later when I make another 4 of them...Any soggyness people are speaking about might be due to elevation levels works great for me just as written...
Thanks so much...

This was a wonderful recipe - my whole family loved it!  I made 2 quiches and a couple little changes...a cup more broccoli (I'd actually add more next time), half the milk, one large onion for both quiches, and I added a can of carrots split between the 2 pans.  It turned out great, and I got only two suggestions for improvement:  My husband thought it'd be good with some meat(ham was suggested),& my son thought of adding something for more flavor.  Rosemary, maybe? He likes fresh herbs.

This recipe was very good. This was the first quiche ive made and was pretty impressed. I made this with the 'easy pie crust' recipe and it only took 45 minutes from gathering ingredients to popping it into the oven. i did cook it an extra 10 minutes tho, b/c i like the top nice and brown. thanks

the recipe says to put the broccoli in first, then the cheese, then the egg.  this make it hard to serve.  mix the all ingredients together before putting in the crust.

I thought this was awesome! I added 1/3 cup of romano cheese and 1/8lb of deli sliced genoa salami to the egg mixture and put it in the blender for about 5 seconds.Then I added the egg mixture as directions said to the pie crust and then topped it with some grated mozzarella cheese.It took about 45min for center to set. As soon as the pie cooled off it was gone!!!Need I say more.

Very bland, followed other reviewers advise and used half an onion, fresh broccoli and a cheese barrier against wetness. Purchased a deep dish frozen pie crust, and I couldn't get all the egg mixture in it. The quiche cooked about 50 minutes, probably could have used another 10 to 20. The only reason I gave it a 3 was because my very picky 3 year old ate about 5 bites covered in cheese.

I used frozen broccoli and doubled the amount. I baked it in a muffin pan in  "oil crust" from this site. The kids loved how cute they came out! (I used skim milk as well)

Wonderful!!  We added about 1/2 cup ham and 1/4 cup green pepper.   We also used half swiss and half moz cheese and cut the milk to 1 cup.   It cooked for about 45 min and was the best quiche I have had in a long time!  Everyone loved it!

Wow, my family was hesitant to eating Quiche, "what else are we having" they said...then it was "is there more?"  Fabulous!  I added a diced chicken breast and a few tablespoons of real bacon bits.  Definately going to "my favorite file!"

Great recipe, or so I thought until I tried a different one using these ingredients.  If you want to use this though, make sure you use fresh broccoli.

Despite using fresh broccoli, the resulting quiche was a little watery. I also decreased the eggs to three and the milk to one cup. The quiche also had to cook about ten minutes longer. I recommend this recipe, but also highly suggest using the amount of eggs and milk that I did. Over all, a good recipe that I will make again!

This is definitely a delicious and easy recipe which I have made many times; the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the middle of the crust has never been done. My attempts at pre-baking have so far been unsuccessful, but I do recommend the recipe to more experienced bakers!

The recipe is soo delicious. My only tip would be to be really careful when pouring the eggs over the broccoli. I poured too much and it made quite a mess in my oven. You may also want to cut back on the milk that you add to the eggs.

This was really good, but I thought there was too much onion, according to the original recipe.  Next time I'll do 1/2 an onion finely chopped.  We used Swiss cheese instead of mozzarella because that's what I had on hand and I thought that was really good.  So very good...next time I'll reduce the onion, add some celery and maybe add some herbs.

I may have made a mistake and followed another's review.  I used 3 eggs with 1 cup of soy milk to 1 cup of cheese.  It was way too spongy.  I prefer a more fritatta texture.  I may try sticking to the recipe but will need to add more spice.

Thought this recipe was very tasty. Like other reviewers, I used 1 cup milk and 3 eggs, and used cheddar because I had to use it up. Came out great, especially considering this was the first quiche I have ever made.

Delicious and easy -- this was a great recipe. The only thing I'd change is to use a deep dish 9" pie crust next time; I had a lot of filling left over that wouldn't fit in the crust. Otherwise, it was spot on!

This REALLY needs sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella.  It was very bland AND watery.  Next time I'll use cheddar and cut the milk down.  I did precook the broccoli and onions, but next time I will cook them a bit longer to get more moisture out of them.  Other that that, it was worth making again.  My picky family gave it mixed reviews.

I brought this to an easter brunch and received loads of compliments on it!  I suggest chopping the broccoli really well so that spreads throughout the quiche, rather than having big chunks.  I pressed the cheese into the crust (as suggested in other reviews) and then sprinkled another layer over the broccoli before pouring the egg mix over it.  Then I sprinkled onion powder on the top.  My oven is old, so I needed to cover it with foil halfway through to avoid burning the crust, but all in all, this recipe is super easy and REALLY good!!

Great! I added red peppers and used Stephanie's Flaky Crust recipe. Could use more broccoli and maybe some mushrooms or other veggies as well.

I thought this quiche was good although it was a little bland for my taste.  Maybe next time I will try a more flavorful cheese.

I used a hash brown crust instead of pie crust - 3 c. shredded hash browns drizzled w/ butter, bake at 425 for 20 min. or until brown - also used sharp cheddar instead of mozz. cheese, 3 eggs & 3/4 c. milk. i thought it was a little bland, but great base! thanks!

This was my first attempt at quiche and while it turned out pretty good it was a little soggy (though I took the advice of others and pressed a layer of cheese to the bottom before dumping the veggies into the crust) and a little loose despite the fact that I cooked it 50 minutes, however, that may have had something to do with the fact that I used 2% milk (all I had). I also cut down on the onion because I don't like a strong onion taste.

Made this for a Christmas brunch.  I really liked the flavor this recipe called for by cooking the fresh broccoli in the garlic & onion. (I used onion powder - tasted just as good as fresh onion).  As other reviewers suggested I used a cheese blend rather than just mozzarella.  Will make this again.  I'll try adding some sausage and/or mushrooms.

I have varied it adding leftover chopped chicken, ham or even just top it with fried onions and bacon. Very good !

I agree with the ladies - mine turned out watery too.  I followed the recipe to a T and still watery.  Next time I will increase the ratio of eggs to milk.

Yummy....made this with soup last night and it was very good...I only had a bag of frozen broccoli on hand which I steamed in the microwave first. I sauteed my onion and garlic in a lil evoo. I used 3 eggs and 1 1/2c. fat free half and half, and used some mexi cheese blend and some shredded mont. jack cheeses. I also pre-baked my pie crust for 10 minutes. Very tasty, will make again!

Great quiche recipe! I use a frozen pie crust so that i can make this fast. I also add less broccoli and one boiled sliced potato instead. I use cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. This is a good recipe for making variations on. You can also freeze this quiche for later.

This quiche was excellent! I would suggest adding just a little less cheese because it melts and really starts to expand in the oven. I didn't have any over-liquidy problems with the quiche and it was very tasty!

Was pretty easy and very good.  Set up nicely and reheated well.  Husband was concerned that there would be too much broccoli, but there wasn't.  I added some three-cheese italian mix (not the Kraft canned stuff). Also threw in some chopped deli ham for some meat.  Will do this again when I crave quiche.

I used a frozen pie crust...let's work smarter, not harder, shall we?! I used a steam packet of organic broccoli and just put it on top (still frozen)of the sauteing veggies when they were about half done and put a lid on top to let it steam.  I also put a layer of parmesean on the crust before pouring the filling in and it was fabulous and EASY!!

Very good and very easy.  I used leftover broccoli (not frozen) and 1 cup half and half instead of 1 1/2 cups of milk.  The mixture fit fine into a deep dish pie crust and set perfectly, but I increased the baking time to 45 minutes. I also have used Cheddar cheese with great results.

Really tasty. I used much less than a whole onion, maybe 1/4. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon cumin. I cooked it at least 45 minutes, and next time I might reduce the milk and let it go even longer; it was still pretty liquidy after cooling for several minutes. Using the ready-to-bake pie crust makes this soooo easy. I'll definitely make this again. My husband actually said, "This is amazing!"

This quiche was ok.  I think the garlic took away from it.  Also, it needed a sharper cheese.  I would use cheddar next time.

I modified this recipe a bit and it was delicious! Here's what I did: Sauteed some onions and about a teaspoon of minced garlic in butter. Added fresh cut asparagus, when that was close to being cooked but still firm, turned off heat and spread it all on the bottom of the pie crust. I used half whole milk and half heavy cream instead of all milk. Used sharp white cheddar and a blend of asiago, parmesan and provolone for my cheese, and I tossed the cheese in about 2 tablespoons of flour before adding to eggs and milk. I used sea salt, white pepper, black pepper and about a half teaspoon or so of oregano to flavor. Make sure you use fresh uncooked broccoli. This was the best tasting quiche I've ever had. Wonderful consistency, too!

It is great with Cheddar Jack cheese.  I tried it first with the mozzarella and didn't like it.  The rest was perfect.  I loved the fresh broccoli. I will be making this again!

My first quiche and it was fantastic! I did have to bake an extra 10 minutes but that could just be the electric stove (do you ever get used to one of these?). I used a ready made pie crust and I think it took away from the flavor. Next time I will make my own. I also used onion powder instead and it added a much better flavor. I think this is going to be one of those dishes that will evolve into so much more over the years. Can't wait to try it with ham as some other reviews have suggested!

This was delicious! The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star instead of 5 is that I had to cook it longer than the recipe said in order for it to firm up. Other than that, it's a great quiche!

Absolutly Delicious! Instead of using 1 1/2 cups milk, I used 1 cup half n half and 1/2 cup milk, and also added mushrooms to the mix. SO GOOD! I will for sure make this again! YUM YUM YUM!

I did make a few adjustments for personal taste, but it came out a little too watery.  It had to cook for more time than stated.

This is a great recipe! It looked so easy I thought I'd give it a try and it was the first time I ever made a quiche and it turned out perfect! I made a few changes but I basically followed the instructions. It was a huge success at my house.

Tasty and fairly easy to make!  I think this might work well in a deep-dish pie crust, as when I poured in the egg mixture there was too much and I had to stem an overflow.

This is a good basic recipe.I did use the modifications suggested by other reviewers (3 eggs + 3/4c milk). However, I found there to be way too much salt in this recipe with these modifications. Next time, I would definitely cut down to 1/2 tspn only. But I think this also had to do with the reduction in milk and eggs.Anyway, good recipe. I was afraid to make quiche but no longer with this recipe..

I thought this quiche recipe was fine, but not the best quiche I've ever eaten. I did make some changes, however. I used a frozen deep dish 9" pie crust. I added some tomatoes and put in less broccoli. I've made it a few times, and used feta cheese or a "quattro formaggio" mix from Trader Joe's. I also used 3 eggs with 3/4 c. of milk, and added italian seasoning into the egg mixture. So, my variation on the recipe was quite a bit different, but pretty tasty. Good luck!

Very good. I reduced the milk to 1 cup, and I am glad I did. The bottom of the quiche was still wet, even after 35 mn of cooking. But this aside, it was tasty and quick.

This quiche is scrumptious!  I also baked the pie crust ahead of time. I added a little canola oil to the butter and first sauteed the chopped onions until light brown, added the garlic and some mushrooms.  As others had suggested, I also added 4 strips of turkey bacon and used a mix of mexican style cheeses.

This was delicious!  Much better than any broccoli quiche I have ever had.  I made a crust from scratch and put it in my deep pie dish and all of the filling fit just fine.  Take the time to make the crust yourself and you won't be sorry!

I was looking for a quiche recipe to try (have never made one before) and took some ideas from several different ones, then happened upon this - which was exactly what I had done!  My only addition was Boca Burger's Italian Sausages sliced down.  Very yummy served with stewed tomatoes and salad!

This was just all right. A bit too much broccoli (even for this self-professed broccoli addict!), but a good basic recipe for alternate fillings.

After reading other comments, and only having regular depth pie crusts, I upped the cheese to 2 cups and eggs to 5 and made two quiches. Loved it last night for dinner, and also had a piece for breakfast. Yum!

Great Recipe! I have a huge deep dish pie pan so I added alot more ingredients.  Instead of broccoli I used a 10oz pkg of spinach, added 1 cup of cooked, chopped turkey, used 2 tbs. olive oil instead of butter for the onion and garlic which i increased to 2 tsp.; and only 1/2 of a medium sized onion. I also used 6 eggs and increased my baking time.  It came out wonderful!!! thanks for sharing this, I was looking for a base quiche recipe to create my own and this one was perfect.

I love this quiche. It's a snap to throw together and easy to change the ingredients for any meal or occasion. We love it best when we add left over chicken to it and have it with a salad for dinner.

I had enough of the mixture to fill 2 frozen pie pans. I also added some cooked bacon. The pie crust was done before the quiche had set and so I had to overcook the crust. It was still good but will try a different crust next time.

Excellent, excellent!  I only used 3 eggs, 3/4 cup of milk, and added six slices of bacon.  This pleased everyone - husband AND my boys who are 2 and 4.

Thank you for this awesome easy recipe.  I make it a lot as the family love it and it doesn't take long at all to make.  I always make it for any friend who's just had a baby and they always appreciate it.

My one major change to this recipe is to pre-bake the crust.Also, if you are purchasing a crust, go for the deep dish, the bottom of your oven or pan will thank you. Other than that one issue, I would have to say that this is a pretty good recipe. My daughter, who is a VERY picky eater, loved it. Very tasty and very easy.

Best quiche I have ever had.  Light, tasty, and even better the next day.  We added bacon, and that just made it even better.  This was so easy to make, anyone could do this.  The flavor just explodes in your mouth.  I highly recommend this dish, and will make it many times in the future!!!

I made this for work and everyone loved it.  I agree with others, it makes more than one deep dish.  I used two pie pans, and had to add extra cheese and one extra egg. Plenty of broccoli.  I mixed 2% cheddar and mozz.  Add mushrooms.  Wonderful! I never made quiche before (I was scared) but I won't be now!

I like it because it's a 'lower' fat recipe.

This Quiche is great! I made it last night for my boyfriend and I and we ate the whole thing! :) I'm a big Quiche fan, and this is may favourite by far! I did as others said and cut the eggs down  to 3 and only used 3/4 of milk. I used a deep pie crust and all ingredients fit perfectly! It's easy to make and you can adapt it to your own taste! Thanks Sara for an amazing recipe! :)

This recipe tasted good, but the quantities are off.  The milk/egg mixture was way too much that I threw some out and the quiche still overflowed and made a mess of my oven. I might try this recipe again, but I'll use a deep dish pie crust.

This recipe lives up to its description, though I prefer to assemble the ingredients in a large bowl before placing in the pie crust. I used a ready made uncooked pie crust. BTW, My husband loves this recipe.

Reduced the egg/milk mixture per earlier suggestions and added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of mustard...was delicious and easy!  I cooked it for 40 min, browning the cheese to a gratin.

this was the first time i have ever attempted to cook. im fairly inept at making food, unless it involves a microwave. so...i came online hoping to find a simple, yet tasty recipe. This recipe was so incredibly easy, and cheap..which is important. My roommate was giving me a really hard time, but once she tried it, she couldn't stop raving about how good it was. I think i gained some respect from her as far as my cooking abilities are concerned:-P well...i totally recommend this recipe and am definitly going to use it again. TRY IT!!

Had no problems at all making this recipe. Steamed the broccoli because it was easier and I don't use onions. Not sure why people cut recipe in half. I did but had to make the extra called for because it didn't cover the filling. But I did use a deep dish crust so that may be why. Got good reviews from family and it was truly simple to make. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I added mushrooms to the mix, which were great.  However, I think you need to spice the vegetables up.  And the egg mixture was way too much.  I'll cut it in half next time.

In an effort to eat more vegetables, I bought the huge bag of broccoli at Costco and was trying to figure out how to creatively use it up. This recipe is quick, easy and adaptable. After reading other reviews, I cut the eggs back to 3, the milk to 1 cup. I was out of mozzarella cheese, so I substituted 1/2 cheddar cheese, 1/2 pepper jack cheese. I skipped the salt and melted butter. Thought it tasted very good. I did use a deep-dish frozen pie crust and had no problems with it overflowing.

Mmmmm-mmmm-mmmmmmmmm! I added diced chicken to this with a combination of montery & jack cheeses & it was fantastic! In fact...I accidentally left off the last portion of melted butter & it was still superb! Even our guest loved it! I'll have to make 2 of these next time to be sure we all get enough!

I poured the batter into individual sized pastry crusts and they were a hit at the party.....the only suggestion I have is to reduce the salt a bit.

Delicious.  I made a few modifications:  (1) Pre-cooked crust for about 11 minutes (2) Sharp cheddar instead of mozzerella (3) only 3 eggs and 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c cream and skipped melted butter (4) added chopped ham.  My 5 year old loved it and my husband, who isn't a big quiche guy, had seconds.

I was short on time,so I lightly steamed the broccoli and then added the rest of the ingredients (I substituted a can of evaporated milk for the milk and always add 1 t. of dry mustard powder to any recipe with cheese). I did not saute the veggies in butter or add  1 T.butter at the end (I forgot)as directed, but the quiche still tasted great and I got rave reviews. A lowfat and tasty version!

This quiche is the perfect balance of homemade deliciousness, and simplicity of something store bought.  I am glad for the reviews, and help with adjusting the amount of milk (3/4 C) and eggs (3-4).
I actually made this DAIRY FREE, because of an allergy within our family.  It was still INCREDIBLE.  (No cheese, and dairy free margarine instead of butter)
Delish!  Thank you Sara.

This won rave reviews in my household (well, okay, one of the kids did not like the broccoli but loved the rest of the quiche).  My husband, who usually says of anyone's cooking "It was good" said tonight, "Wow, that was great!"  He felt the quiche was worthy of a 5 star restaurant.  A note to add, not about the recipe, but about the pie crust:  I am a die hard "make the crust yourself" person because I do not like the pie crusts in the grocery store.  That is, until tonight.  Under diress I bought a package of Marie Callender's (sp?) deep dish pie crusts.  It was wonderful, better than any pie crust I've made myself.  They go very well with this recipe.

My chef's hat is off to Sara.  Very good recipe!

Very EZ & Great Tasting Recipe!  I cooked my quiche for about 45 minutes at 375 degrees.  I also pre-cooked my pie crust for about 15 minutes before adding the egg mixture.  Make sure you cool the pie crust before adding the egg mixture.

I used 3 eggs, 3/4 cup milk and cooked for 55 minutes. Turned out great! HOWEVER, look at the pie crust before buying. DON'T use a graham cracker crust. It gives it an odd cheesecake aftertaste... :S

Very good and easy.  I only wish I had read all the way down to the review that mentioned that it takes more like 45-50 minutes.  We ended up eating later than I would have liked...but then I couldn't STOP eating because it was so good.

Easy to make... It was good. Found it was more for a breakfast or brunch than a dinner.  Would add more garlic or onions for more flavor. It took more time to cook then it says on the recipe.

I cooked this for the family I work for and they loved it! To make the prep. easier, I chopped the onions and garlic when I had some free time, covered and kept them in the fridge until I was ready to start dinner. I also used frozen broccoli. I ended up with enough filling for 2 pies. I served the quiche with fruit salad and muffins. The family liked it so much, they had the leftover pie for breakfast and packed it for lunch! Thanks for the recipe.

This was good.  Not as easy as I'd hoped, but not exactly hard.  Next time I would reduce the pepper by half, since I found it a little spicy for my taste.  However, I'm not a spicy food lover in general, so take that with a grain of salt (or pepper--hehe).  Also, it may have been my oven, but I had to cook it an extra 10 minutes before the filling was set.

This recipe was good. I added cheddar instead of mozzorella, just because its my favorite. I also added a couple dashes of tabasco to the egg/milk mixutre and some diced ham I had on hand. Pretty tasty.

Easy and tasted good. Cooked at 375 for 35 minutes and came out perfect. The only thing was the crust was a bit soggy - maybe precooking the crust would solve this?

Was very good.  Very high in fat and calories though.

This recipe was easy and turned out very nice. Would be good for company. You can easily add crumbled bacon or diced ham if you prefer your quiche with that flavor. Would not hesitate to make this again.

I loved this recipe!  Next time I would add more cheese and bacon as well.  It was easy and looked beautiful.

Very good - used frozen chopped broccoli.  Had extra egg mixture - but none the less very good quiche.

Made two of these recently, used skim evaporated milk . Add bacon to one for our meat eating friends and the other one as is. Was a hit from both sides. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe-- I cut the fat by using less butter, less cheese and skim milk.  Added mushrooms.  It was delicious-- but it did take longer than 30 min. to set.  More like 40.

Yummy! I sauteed my onions in olive oil instead and added fresh mushrooms and didn't use any garlic. Served at a brunch and was well received

Very easy, very tasty -- though for some reason the bottom of my crust turned out mushy.  I'm sure it's my problem, and no fault of the recipe.  I added cooked bacon crumbles to the broccoli and reduced the cheese & butter.  I'll make this again (and try for a crisper crust!).

Very Good.  Change the Broccoli with Spinach and reduce the amount of liquids (milk & eggs).
Very tasty!!!!!

Hah hah, now everyone thinks I'm a master cook. :)

Anyways, it turned out really well. The only problem was that I had too much egg and milk mixture and had to siphon off a bit of it before I could get it across the kitchen. But otherwise it was perfect.
