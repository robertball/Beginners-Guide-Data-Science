A good starter recipe.  Really no need to boil the potatoes first....that's just another pan to wash.  I use an electric skillet.  Melt a little butter and add a little oil.  Throw in the diced potatoes, with the skin on, and as much sweet onion as you like.  I use vidalia or mayan.  Skip the green pepper.  Then just get happy with the spices.  We like celery seed, a touch of cumin, a dash of paprika, salt and pepper, garlic powder, whatever we happen to grab.  It always comes out deelish.  Definitely good for breakfast, lunch or anytime.  For dinner we might throw a little gravy and maybe some shredded cheese on them.  Always crispy if I leave the lid on.  I don't have the problem another reviewer has with them not crisping.  Maybe it's the nonstick electric skillet....don't really know.

Finally the perfect fried potatoes. I have been trying to make fried "taters" and they always either come out too mushy, or not done enough. I was scanning through recipes and came across this one where you boiled the potatoes a little bit first before frying. I tried it and it worked perfectly. Have done it several times and they came out perfect every time!!
I used regular potatoes and fried with a little onion..served with pinto beans and corn bread

Thank you!

Great recipe! I left out the green pepper as I didn't have any on hand. I added a little garlic and used smoked paprika instead of regular to give it a different flavor - excellent!

Great flavor-I modified the recipe by cutting the potatos first and microwaving them for 8 minutes, instead of boiling them; it cut down on time (and the mess!!!)

WOW! Did this recipe get some activity this past week (smile:))! All the publicity promted me to make these for lunch to go with our homemade corndogs. I followed another's advice and used regular baking potatoes, which I peeled, cubed and then cooked in the microwave for apprx 10 min (just to speed up the process so that they would better match the cooking time of the corndogs I was making).  Also, I added half of a chopped, red bell pepper. This tastes just like those O'brian potatoes you can purchase in stores and although those are a little more convenient, the taste of these are much better. I sprinkled a little cheese to melt over my serving while my boyfriend and daughter used their extra ketchup from their corn dogs with theirs. A good side to any meal: B/L/D! Thanks Verona!

I had a craving for some home fried potatoes and this recipe hit it on the nose for perfection. First I microwaved some regular potatoes-much easier.  Then I peeled(I prefer no skins) and when cooled chopped into little cubes.  Next I chopped up 1/2 green pepper, 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 onion into little cubes and sauteed in my electric skillet with some olive oil for 3minutes then added a couple of dabs of butter and sauteed for another 2 minutes.  In went the potatoes with black pepper, salt, paprika, garlic powder and whatever spice you like and  mix it all up and I added a few more dabs of butter(love butter).  I let it cook for 10 minutes or more on each side on med/low setting.  Easier for me to break it up in sections with spatula in the skillet to flip it over- so each side is nice and brown.  A must try-YUMMY!!!!

Your absolutely right Verona...these are yummy!  We don't add the veggies (although they would taste great), but fry the potatoes in bacon grease.  I hope no one's heart skipped a beat when they read that.  But it is delicious!!  Try this with biscuits and grave..a real southern meal.

YUM!  Just like O'Brian style potatoes that my mom used to make.  I used green & red bell peppers.  The smell of these awoke the kids this morning, they smelled so good!  Thanks Verona!

The recipe is great but the easiest way to cook the potatoes is to spread all the ingrdients on a baking sheet and bake for approximately 20 minutes. They come out crispy an delicious.

Very good - made it "breakfast for dinner" tonight with omelettes and cinnamon rolls. I used regular potatoes and microwaved them for 5 minutes instead of boiling. The whole family enjoyed them!

A great recipe. I prepare the potatoes and then freeze them on a baking sheet to prevent them from sticking together. After freezing place the potatoes in a Ziploc bag and use them at your convenience.

5 stars for the method.  I didn't follow this recipe to a tee, I was looking for a method to fix a lot of potatoes for a large group without it taking forever in the skillet.  I boiled the potatoes (5#) for 15 minutes as called for, then cooled them and put in ziploc bags to take on my trip.  The morning I was to cook breakfast I cut them up, then sauteed the onion and set aside.  Then I fried the potatoes with pepper and seasoned salt and added the onions back in when the potatoes had some crisp on them.  Resounding success.

Great potatoes. KS girl here so I have def made my share of fried potatoes many different ways including these. Frying in bacon grease is also excellent. I keep saved grease in fridge for many reasons, mostly when I am too lazy to thaw & fry bacon for green beans, baked beans, etc. Sorry, getting off track here. I was actually only leaving review to add a little trick my gramma taught me. No boiling. Instead, after frying a bit, pour in about 1/8c or so of water in really hot skillet of taters and cover. Steams potatoes the rest of the way thru. I then fry a little longer to get the good crunchy bottoms my daughter and I like.

Here is my usual way of making this kind of potato dish. I usually slice them into smaller pieces then fry them in bacon drippings. Make sure to add alot of salt (garlic salt) and pepper. I skip the boiling part all together. If you find it needs to cook more thoroughly just put a lid on it for a bit. I start my potatoes going then add in my onions and Italian Seasoning. The seasoning makes is SOOOOO flavourful.

I don't review many recipes but I use this site alot and consider the reviews carefully before I make a recipe. Numerous reviews lose their credability if people like myself don't even believe you tried the recipe. Therefore, when it comes time to hit the "was this review helpful" button, I'll think seriously before selecting yes.  No matter what, I'll still love this site!

Perfect home-fried potatoes! I used russet potatoes and baked them the night before at 350 degrees for an hour.  I used both red and green peppers and bacon fat for frying.  Couldn't be better!

I love this recipe but there really is no need to boil the potatoes. Especially if you have a good nonstick skilled or electric skilled. I just drizzle some evoo in the pan make sure the oil is hot throw the potatoes in season and cover for like 10 minutes then remove lid. Cook until golden brown. We use paprika and some cayenne pepper. We like our potatoes a little spicy.

Excellent. Boiling the potatoes first made all the difference, as did cooking the two parts of the recipe separately. Even my picky 12 yr old girl liked it and even ate the bell pepper!

Delicious! I brought this to a brunch party and the whole tray was gone in about 10 mins. The only thing I changed is after frying on the skillet for about 15mins, the potatoes didnt feel quite done so I put these in the oven at 425degrees for additional 20 mins. Yum!

A great basic recipe. There's really no need to boil the potatoes, I just softened them up in the microwave.  What I really like about this recipe is the fact that you get potatoes that are crispy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside.  Sure this doesn't have much going on in the way of spices, but those of us who want to play around with different spices and flavors can do so easily.  I added garlic (can't have potatoes w/o that stuff) and some cheese melted over the top. Thanks for the recipe!

You can make this a dinner dish by adding sliced smoked or Polish sausage to the potatoes. I've been making this dish for many years and it's a keeper.

Awesome potatoes! I didn't have any bell pepper on hand & only used a little bit of onion. My husband doesn't eat anything with onions so I didn't tell him & he didn't even notice. I also used Idaho potatoes.

These potatoes are delicious.  I put a little chopped garlic in as well since I can't cook anything without garlic.  I cooked them in my electric skillet on 350 deg. with a cover and they were crispy and delicious.

These potatoes are excellent. I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made them, cooked them a bit longer/at a higher heat to make them crispy on the outside. The second time I made them I added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, chili powder, and red pepper flakes in addition to the paprika to give them a spicy kick. Delicious!

These are the best home fries I've made. I used leftover baby red potatoes, quartered. Once the potatoes were cooked, I moved half the potatoes off to one side of the pan and added onions & green pepper to the other half, leaving the plain side for the kids. Everyone loved them.

This is how I do my breakfast potatoes- However, I seem to never get that crust on the outside, it just gets all cooked and soft. I used half each of red and green bell peppers, my potatoes were smaller so used 6-7 and skipped the parsley. For seasoning I used Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, seasoned salt and chili powder. YUM!

I replaced green peppers with red peppers and the result was delicious. I also cubed the potatoes before boiling them to cut the boiling time. Perfect home fries.

IT came out DELICIOUS!! I made this whole recipe for just me and my fiance and I had maybe two scoops and HE ATE THE REST IN ONE SITTING!! The things I changed I cut and peeled russets instead of red potatoes (my fiance doesn't like the skin) and I only had russets in the pantry.  I used minced garlic and seasoned salt.  It was terrific...I'm SO GLAD I found this recipe!!

I have made fried potatoes many times the way my mom does, but this (sorry mom)is so much better. I had to omit the green peppers and parsley because I didn't have them on hand and I'm sure it would have only enhanced the flavor even more. I also added garlic powder and season all. But the texture of the potatoes is perfect...exactly what I was looking for! Thank you!

Delicious. I followed another reviewers suggestion to microwave the diced potatoes for 8-10 minutes instead of boiling. Will make again.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for when looking to make breakfast potatoes. I had to leave out quite a few of the ingredients as I was out, but it still came out beautifully. I only ended up using red potatoes, olive oil, salt, pepper, and paprika. I just learned to steam cut up and cubed potatoes in a small amount of water to cook them faster, which is what I did. I also accidentally added minced garlic to the water from changing directions after I had already added minced garlic to the potatoes, but it turned out to be a happy accident.

These were pretty good actually the best home fries I've ever made....the flavor was just a little dull for my taste so I added some sweet smoked rub and it was great! The boiling was the key for me. I have tried making home fries before and they always fell apart...but this time they were perfect. Thanks for the recipe :)

I tried something a bit different: 2 potatoes for my fiance and I of which I popped them in the microwave for no more than 3 minutes (i would peel them beforehand if you don't like the skins). While they're in the microwave, I preheated a nonstick skillet with both butter and olive oil PAM spray on Medium. Added the cubed potatoes and turned up the heat to HIGH to make them real crispy (on my oven it's a 8 out of 9). Once most of the sides were really crispy I began to add the seasonings: parsley, oregano, parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. DELISH! We served them with a side of ketchup and will  definately be making these again!

These were pretty good...I baked instead of fried them. Shook up all the ingredients in a Ziploc with a bunch of olive oil to coat, then put them in the oven at 425 for about 30-40 minutes, turning once.

Yum! 
As a note, boiled fried potatos have a different texture than dry fried potatos. Yes, you can skip the boiling but there will be a slight difference in texture. Still yummy, though :)

We really enjoyed this recipe. I added minced garlic and sauteed with the onions which gave the potatoes a nice flavor. 
I put as many green peppers to my liking since other reviewers mentioned that there may have been too many. This recipe is easy to adjust to any cooks' liking. Thanks!

Yum! Hubby just went wild for these!  I made extra to save but he ate them all at dinner!  I did make a few changes:  NO GREEN PEPPERS (to "bitter sweet" for the dish, in my opinion), added a few cloves of minced garlic, and dried parsley instead of fresh.  Also added some cayenne powder to spice it up a bit more.  I had to do most of the prep early in the day...here is what I did.  I used my mandoline to make thick potato juliennes, then boiled them until almost tender, and blanched them.  I put the onion, oil, spices and taters into ziplocs and tossed to coat, then tossed into the fridge.  When it was time for dinner I just put the mix into the skillet and cooked 'em up!  These will be great to use with the foodsaver!  One more note:  for my serving, I used fat free margarine instead of the oil.  I thought it was great and a lot less fat/calories!

This was good but I felt that the potatoes, itself, lacked in flavour.  I added some crumbled bacon to the mix to liven it up a bit.

...I woke up extremely hungry this morning..came across this recipe and it totally hit the spot!  I used about 10 very small red potatoes so this cooked up really fast...yea!  Very good recipe..can use whatever potato, pepper and onion you have on hand.  I HAD to use butter for frying and added a dash of garlic...thanks for helping  tame the hunger pains!!

White potatoes worked well with this recipe.  This can be made for breakfast or dinner.  But I think next time I'll peel potatoes prior to boiling them.  Skin was a nuisance when cooking in the pan.

This is my first recipe that I've used from this site and it was a hit. Like many others, I was weary of using green peppers but I'm glad I did. They added great flavour to the dish. One thing I did differently was that I added garlic powder a few times during the frying and I fine it helped quite a lot. Thx..this is a keeper

Very good.  The only changes I made were to use green onion, boil the potatoes in canned vegetable broth and add 3 slices of crumbled bacon before serving.  My husband's favorite potatoes.

I was skeptical because this recipe was so simple and called for very little seasoning. But i guess this is a prime of example of less is more. These were great....

Never thought I'd be rating home fries, I make them often. But, while browsing around I noticed this post and decided to try them.  I only had 2 Yukon gold, 2 large red and 1 sweet potato so had to make due.  Microwaved for 10 minutes then put them in the fridge until dinner...followed the rest of the recipe as written and the two of us having breakfast for dinner ate every last one!  Never doing any of my "old methods" again...Thank you for sharing such a simple but worthwhile recipe.

Very good!  I modified this only to suit what was in my kitchen.  I used small reds and fingerling potatoes, a white pepper instead of green, omitted the paprika and parsley, and added about a teaspoon of Herbs from Province.  I also added a little butter to the potatoes while they were cooking.  They came out excellent!

These are great.  If I want to serve them as breakfast potatoes, I complete step 1 and step 2 the night before and refrigerate the potatoes and peppers/onions in separate containers until ready for step 3.

The best home fries I've ever made! I followed some other suggestions and microwaved the potatoes for 7 minutes and let cool before cubing them - it really did the trick! Will for sure add this to our regular breakfast rotation. Thank you!

The par-boil step is quite crucial, actually. Also, if you have time, refrigerate your par-boiled potatoes to make it easier to handle. Make potatoes in two batches rather than crowd in the pan. This will promote faster cooking and better browning. A dash of chili powder doesn't hurt anything, either.

So easy and satisfying. A great starter recipe to tweak to your tastes. We love this. I also don't boil the potatoes first but I suppose it would speed up the cook process. Either way- this is delish!

Cooked this recipe on vacation.  Didn't have all the ingredients.  Didn't have parsley.  Substituted red bell pepper for green.  Used Tabasco instead of paprika.  The home-fried potatoes were popular with everyone, including my 7 year-old, who normally won't eat potatoes.  Will definitely try this recipe again.

Added red pepper to go along with green pepper.  Also used Russett potatoes instead of red potatoes.

For a little added flavor I also added some sausage to the home fries.  It was really good, but next time I'll use spicy Italian sausage instead of regular sausage (for added kick).

I fried an egg over the top of each serving...incredible!

I substituted about 1/4 tsp. Cayenne Pepper for the Paprika since we didn't have any, and added two eggs in.  I think it would have been delicious even without my changes.

Everyone loved these at our Christmas brunch this year.  Very easy recipe - boiled the potatoes the night before, then popped them in the fridge.  Chopped them up right before frying.  Yummy!

These were an easy recipe to make for my family seems how they love fried potatoes. They thought these were really good. I have made them like this before. You can really do a lot of different things with fried potatoes, and it's always fun to try something new. Thanks for the recipe.

Good, simple recipe! I'm not that familiar with cooking potatoes and really wanted to check to see times and whether or not to boil first, and this answered all my questions. I skipped the paprika, used dried parsley, and added rosemary and garlic powder. Yummy, easy way to start your Saturday!

I didn't have a whole green pepper so I threw in a little bit of red too and I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dry. These turned out good but next time I make them I'll probably throw in some cayenne pepper to give them a little kick.

These were excellent.  We had them with the Authentic Mexican Breakfast Tacos from this site.  I added a dash of cumin and a dash of garlic powder, but besides that followed the recipe.

These taste a lot like the pan fried potatoes I get at a local German restaurant.  Very Yummy!!!  Next time I will try just making the potatoes without the bell pepper and onions.

I just made this for breakfast and it was delicious!  I used whatever was on hand so I made it with russet potatoes, garlic, onions and leftover ham.  Microwaved the potatoes to save time, then pan fried the potatoes separately from the onions/garlic and it turned out brown and crisp! Just make sure the potatoes are dryish.  A pinch of salt/pepper and ham added a lot of flavour to the dish.  Will make it for my husband tomorrow! He's going to love it.

Great way to make homefries a little bit faster. I omitted the green pepper and cooked in a cast iron skillet so i could use less oil.

It came out so perfect!! I added a touch a latina flavor by adding a pouch of " Sazon Goya with culantro and achiote".  It gave it a nice color so it doesnt look so pale anda nice extra taste.  Dont over cook the potatoes because once you add all the ingredients to it, it will break apart. Once I added all the seasoning to it I lowered the heat all the way and left it in the pot for an extra 7 minutes so it can take up in all the flavor.  Make sure you mix it every so often so every potato has a nice flavor!

Simple recipe. Good dish. If you bake the potatoes instead of boiling it, they will be drier in texture.  I fried the potatoes a few minutes longer than suggested for a crispier texture. Used a sweet yellow onion. I have made this three times- with green or red peppers alone and a combination of both. I liked the result of using both peppers. But don't overdo it with the vegetables... too much water from the peppers + onions will make your dish mushy. I added some garlic for a punch.

We find it's also great if you add an egg or two and fry it up together with the potatoes.  Only add it at the end though because it doesn't need much frying time but it adds another flavor as well as a bit of protein.

This is the perfect home fry recipe! I also cooked my potatoes in the microwave to save time. I added a seasoned pepper that is awesome, just a little added flavor & served it with sauteed squash and the brown sugar meat loaf. Awesome!

Great recipe!! Simple and quick. I cooked my potatoes in bacon grease/oil and cooked an addition 10 mins until the potatoes where soft and and extra tender. The bacon added a great flavor!

These were very good. They did come out a little more soft then I wanted, so I just cranked up the heat and cooked a little longer. Very yummy though!

Ok, I have to say, I deviated from the recipe in the sense that I roasted all ingredients together at the same time instead of cooking them separately, then mixing together. But it was pretty good, sort of like a soup without the liquid. Next time I will also add garlic, I think it will give the dish more flavor.

Probably the best home fried potatoes I've ever made. Boiling them first is definately the way to go, it cuts time, they don't get too brown before they're ready, and it takes nothing away from them. Red potatoes are also a nice touch. I did however add the peppers and onions to the potatoes half-way through cooking to save time, and I added a few cloves of garlic that I just smashed with a large knife without cutting them, so I could remove them later before serving. That was just my personal preference. This is the only way I will be making home fries again.

Great recipe!!! This is really a hash brown but with a fabulous dinner twist - the onion and pepper really make this dish!!! I used red peppers as I did not have green  and seasoned more to satisfy my personal taste. Will definitely make again!!!

Wow! These potatoes were absolutely delicious. I first tried them as a side next to fried chicken, then as a brunch served with sour cream. I can see myself making these again and again. I did add some garlic powder, as per previous reviewers, and just fried the onions directly with the potatoes to save time - there's no need to do it separately.

Good recipe.  Next time I would slice the onions instead of chop (personal preference) and cook the potatoes just a little longer.  (I had 4 large red potatoes and they could have used a little more cooking time.)  The taste was very good.  Made with Sausage Smothered in Red Cabbage from this site.   Thanks

This is the best recipe I've tried for home fries.  The secret is the pre-boiling of the potatoes and cooking the veggies seperately.  Make a big taste difference.  My husband generally prefers rice, but really enjoyed these.  Thanks for sharing your secret!

I feel like it takes me forever to make this recipe, but it's really really good.  A whole onion is way too much for my liking- I don't use any more than a half.  But  everyone I've ever made this for has loved it.

WOW!!!  SOOOOOO YUMMY!!!  This recipe turned out just wonderful.  I used regular potatoes, and I cut them before boiling them, but the spices in this recipe went together perfectly.  I would not change a thing.... great recipe!!!  Thank you sooo much, this one is a keeper.  Although, my potatoes did turn out a little soft, they were still delicious!  mmmm mmmm good!!!

Average recipe.  I wanted crispy home fries, but these came out soft.  I know others found that happened also.  Tasted fine, but I wasn't in the mood for "soft" home fries.  Nothing "wrong" with these, but I won't make again, I'll look for a better recipe.

This was an excellent potato dish. I cheated and bought pre cooked diced potatoes which I'm sure cut down on cooking time. The seasonings were perfect and they went great at my breakfast for dinner meal. I will make these again.

A great basic recipe & easy to follow! The home fries came out crispy and soft, although I used regular potatoes instead of red ones. Thanks!

I added a clove of garlic minced with the onion (and left out the pepper, since I didn't have one).  I plan to melt some cheese over the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow.

A great ending for a potatoe! I'm always on the lookout for something easy but tasty instead of plain old boiled potatoes.

I left out the pepper (don't like it), and added a pinch of garlic salt and seasoning salt.

Great recipe!

I didn't like it at all. It's so bland and flavorless. I followed it to a T. Will never make it again; surprised it was rated 4 stars; it doesn't even earn a star.

We have a new family favorite.  I diced the potatos prior to boiling to save time - did not have to cool them prior to cutting and they cook faster as they are in smaller pieces.  Otherwise, followed the recipe to a tee.  Great!

AWESOME!! The only thing I did different was I didn't add the bell pepper as SOMEONE in my family doesn't care for them:).  I can tell you that if they are this good without the peppers, they have to be spectacular with them!!

This will be my go to for breakfast potatoes! Did like other suggested, diced and microwaved before pan cooking. I might consider adding some spike or 21 Salute seasoning next time.

I've never had great results, in 25 years, making fried potatoes.  I found this method of the parboiling first to be the solution! Came out great.  I used some frozen peppers from the garden, as well as a huge Peruvian onion. Seasoned with some Lowery's, parsley, garlic powder. Great results in my cast iron pan. Perfect on doneness and crisp. This will be my method from now on!

Good recipe. I made some modifications to the recipe for convenience and taste. I left out the green pepper.  I had some finely diced raw potatoes left over from another recipe, so I used them. Only needed a minute to parboil before frying in a combination of olive oil and butter.  Added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the potatoes when I added the paprika. The tiny dice (both 1/8-1/4 inch ) turned out a nice and crispy dish!

I love potatoes in every form, but this recipe is among the best of them. Simple and easy, I particularly like the freshness added by only adding the onions, green pepper, and the parsley for a minute at the end. This recipe is going into my staples!

Loved the reviewer suggestions to microwave the potatoes instead of par-boiling them.  I saw one that said 8 minutes and one that said 10 minutes.  However, what people need to take into consideration is the size of the potatoes, how many potatoes and the wattage of their microwave. I used 4 medium sized peeled red potatoes; had to cut one in half that was a little larger, poked each one with the tip of a sharp knife, then nuked them in a 1100 watt oven on high for 6 minutes.  This was about a minute longer than needed, although they were fine. I used bacon grease instead of oil, otherwise, followed the recipe as written.

The cool thing about this recipe, is that you can adapt it easily; throw whatever you like in there, or whatever you have. It's a good solid recipe. In my case, I used leftover boiled potatoes from supper the day before. I didn't have bell pepper, my husband had eaten all of them for a snack, lol. And I didn't have time to cut up and cook the onion. While cooking the potatoes in oil, in a cast iron skillet, I added minced onion, garlic, cracked grated pepper, smoked paprika, and a dash of kosher salt. I had to cook the potatoes a little longer than in the recipe, but they were good and crispy all over and we really enjoyed the taste. No leftovers! :) I enjoyed reading the variations that everyone else did. Next time, I['m going to try another reviewers suggestion of baking them in the oven on a cookie sheet and compare the flavors of cooking in cast iron versus baking in the oven. Happy cooking all!

I used yellow potatoes, and cut them up before boiling. I had to substitute the olive oil with vegetable oil (didn't have olive oil). Also used half of an onion and half of a green pepper. Added a pinch of garlic powder.

only reason it's not five stars is that I disagree with the times given.  My peppers and onions were still crunchy after five minutes, it took at least 10 to get them relatively soft.  Also the 10 minutes at the last step was at least 20 for me.  Maybe this is for a gas stove?

Anyway, try it with some melted provolone on top!!

I was looking forward to trying this recipe because I love homefries with onion and bell pepper. I followed the recipe, the smell was intoxicating, but for me the end product was only okay. It lacked flavor.  I wonder if using some flavor-infused olive oil when frying the potatoes would do the trick.  I am going to also try and add a little more seasoning, maybe some roasted garlic.

I made these quite a while ago- as I recall they were good, but a bit bland and didn't have the crisp I was looking for. The BIGGER problem was that when I put the potatoes in the skillet they popped and sizzled- sending hot oil airborn the whole time I cooked- Ow... I discovered that chopping them and baking about 17 minutes (I think I settled at 375) and Then tossing them on the skillet... mmm... perfect. For those who fuss about an extra pot- I use an oven safe skillet.  I simply pull it out of the oven, use the spatula to free up the potatoes and put in enough oil to fry.

Love these!  I use a cast iron skillet - seems to crisp things up better than others.  No onion or peppers; no boil; I usually use Yukons b/c we love them sooo much!  I peel and throw all of the seasoning in the bowl with the peeled potatoes, them throw them in the skillet.  Because I don't like to boil them first, the fry time takes a bit longer than this recipes call for, but awesome nonetheless!  BTW... I use a great Mediteranean sea salt seasong from McCormick!  Makes these even more wonderfull!!

Delicious and easy!  I also microwaved the red skins instead of boiling, just as effective and much easier.

These were pretty good.  I used a red bell pepper and dried parsley.  I think these need a little more seasoning and then they would be perfect!

This is the greatest way to fix fried potatoes for a crowd --- like 16-20!  I merely increased the amounts (by a lot) and sliced up the spuds BEFORE boiling.  Everyone loved them.

In my opinion these were quite bland, but I'm giving them four stars because hubby said they were quite good. The only change I made was too add a little garlic powder. If I make again, I will make sure the potatos are cut very small so they get more spice coverage, I'll add some cayanne for kick and I will probably serve with grated chedder cheese.

This was so good, especially with ketchup on the side! We didn't have parsley (but that wasn't needed after all). We only had Yukon gold potatoes and that worked out great.   Instead of the all oil for frying up the potatoes we used 1/2 unsalted butter with 1/2 oil.

Very good. I used half red and half green pepper for colour, substituted some fresh cilantro for the parsley, and added 5-6 drops of hot sauce for kick, but otherwise followed the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

This is a decent recipe, and the flavor is all there. I didn't have a green pepper so I used a red one- and it was still delicious! I would just caution that the potatoes might need a little more than 10 minutes of pan cooking to be well done and even a little pan-crunchy on the edges. I really liked this recipe!

these potatoes are so! good! I will  definitely make these again. Also, when you make baked potatoes make some extra and then the next day or so you can have these, by just cutting up the leftover baked potatoes. makes them really quick.

These tasted great with some cumin, but I had to fry the potatoes a loooong time -maybe 30-35 minutes- before they even started to brown, and then an additional 10 minutes before they looked ready to eat.  Anybody have any idea why?  I only rate the recipe lower because I was expecting a shorter cooking time.

Pretty good. My potatoes took much longer to cook than the recipe states, which threw off the timing of the rest of the meal, but the taste was fine. Thanks!

I used leftover baked yukon gold potatos and they turned out wonderful. I have used the boiling method before and they seemed a bit too soft. The potatos held up really well while frying in canola oil and the flavor with the onions and peppers was definately a crowd pleaser. Don't forget to have some Tobasco on hand :)

Flavor: 5 stars!! Yum yum restaraunt quality. everyone in the family loved them. 

Just gave 4 stars because the potatoes stuck to the bottom of the pan, and didn't get crispy on the outside like I had hoped. Still delicious though!!

These were really great potatoes!  I had to boil my potatoes a little longer because they were a little big.  I also was not sure how "firm but tender" they needed to be but I think you should go a little on the firmer side so they don't get too mushy when you fry them.  The combination if the spices was just perfect except I did use seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  I also sprinkled a little shredded cheese on top before I served them.  It was perfectly melted!  Definately try these!

These were very good.  I added season salt from Tastefully Simple and added a little bacon grease (I know - very bad for you).  Turned out very good.

Wonderful receipe. The olive oil gives it a wonderful flavor and helps cut down on the bad stuff.

Similar to what my family often makes.  I used less onion and green pepper due to preference.  Very good.

This was just okay.  It was not good, but not bad.  Most raters liked it much better than my family did, so maybe we just don't have a taste for potatoes prepared this way.

I really liked these, but make sure you use 4 GOOD size potatoes. I had way too many peppers and onions and not enough potatoes!

Really delicious.  I would cut back on the oil slightly.  But otherwise, very flavorful, even when reheated.

These were pretty good. My husband loved them, but I did not care for the lack of flavor. I boiled the potatos a little longer than what it called for and glad I did. Will most likely try a different recipe next time.

Left out the green pepper, used olive oil and regular potatoes and seasoning salt instead of regular salt. Husband loved the potatoes served with a London broil.

These were yummy. Next time though, I would leave out the green pepper - it gave the potatoes a bit of a bitter taste.

This was a good, basic recipe not requiring alot of ingredients.  Make sure you add plenty of salt,pepper, garlic powder as they cook or they tend to be a little bland.

I cooked the potatoes as stated in the recipe, and they tasted good, but the centres turned out hard as a rock.  Maybe I'll boil them longer if I make them again.

My husband said that these were okay, but that maybe I should have sliced the potatoes a bit thinner to make them crispy.  They were quite soft, but this may have been my fault.  I covered the pan while cooking them - should I have left the lid off?  I thought they were quite nice actually, but I will probably continue to look for a recipe closer to what my husband wants.

I finally found a great recipe for home-fries!  Like another reviewer I also diced the potatoes before I boiled them to save time.  I added a vidalia onion because they are in season (yummy) and just added the seasoning until it tasted right.  My son added cheese and real bacon bits to his and loved them.  Thanks for the recipe!
