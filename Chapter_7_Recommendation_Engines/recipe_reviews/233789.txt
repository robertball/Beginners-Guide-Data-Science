I am vegetarian so I substituted the fish with a mock spicy sausage- green onion for yellow onion- also had to sub the yellow and orange peppers for a green bell pepper!! Everything else was the same! Just used what I had at home!! Just the right amount of spice and sweetness!! Thank you for the recipe- my neighbor gave me a bag of fresnos and I had no idea what to do with them-- now I have a better understanding!:)

I fell in love with this recipe. I've made it twice now, and plan on making it a third time tomorrow. Changes I've made are as follows:
-after trying it the first time, I now leave out the anchovies. Just didn't like the fishy taste that is noticeable when scraping out the left over juices from the pan, lol.
-I add in Italian sausage to balance out the meal (love my protein). To fit the circle theme, I boil them on their own first, cut them into circles, and throw em in to the sauce.
-I couldn't find Fresno chile pepper, so I used a really hot jalape√±o...next time using less because it was almost too hot to handle.
-I just used tomatoes for the tomato component. Whatever I have on hand is what I use (fresh, diced canned, whole canned, or crushed canned) because I don't like pre made sauces.

Five star recipe, people!!

We found this to be an enjoyable low calorie meal, but I thought the sweet and spicy flavors would be more bold.  Tasted most strongly of canned tomato sauce, but the zucchini, peppers, and pasta were a nice array of textures.  Not something I would make again without a lot of changes, but I really liked the concept.
