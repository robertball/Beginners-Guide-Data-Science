Made this mostly following the recipe... I did wing it a bit and didn't really measure stuff. But it came out fantastic. My husband is a chef and he LOVED it. My 5 yo daughter had a friend over after school the next day and insisted I serve some leftover chicken as a snack. Haha guess it was a home run... Will serve again soon...

Made this with no changes and it turned out great! The only thing is that it took a bit longer than expected

Delicious! My family enjoyed this very much. My only change was in using dried thyme and oregano. It's easy enough to make too. Next time I will skin the chicken though.

A bit too watery. Tastes like a bland version of chicken cacciatore without the delicious peppers.
