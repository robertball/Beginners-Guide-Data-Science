In response to steffunny, if you will add the following, I think you will like the dip much better:
1 cup finely chopped onion
1 cup finely chopped celery
1 cup finely chopped green bell pepper

I thought the same thing as you and added the above and it was great!!!!

This was good, and it was a hit with my visitors.  It seemed to me like something was missing, but I could never put my finger on it.  Oh well, thanks for sharing!

I've been making a variation of this since I was first married... it's so simple and it's so good!!!  Who needs a cracker?  :)  This does make a LOT, so halve it or invite a crowd to share!  I will also say that I thought it needed just the littlest bit more PUNCH... next time I'm putting in half a teaspoon of horseradish.
