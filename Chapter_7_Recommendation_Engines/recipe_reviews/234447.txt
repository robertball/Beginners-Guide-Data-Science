I really liked this as a warm side dish. I added the chopped apple at the end as a personal preference and forgot to add the cheese, not sure it's needed.  A nice change from rice.

I absolutely loved this dish!   I did, however feel it needed more sweetness and more flavor in general.  I added a bit more maple syrup, toasted the pecans and added fresh lemon juice in the end.  I brought it to a pot luck and it was devoured with many asking for the recipe.  I'm making it for another gathering tomorrow!  So healthy, too! (I, too left out the cheese)

This salad is great and very easy.  Just my style!  Made with the cheese the first time, not  great, especially warm.
Try cold using Feta. Use less oil.

The first time I made it exactly as instructed.  It was good, but a little too sweet for my taste.  The second time, I omitted the apples, syrup, and cinnamon, and put in 1 tsp of lemon juice.  I liked it much better that way.

Very nutritious, everyone was full after one serving. Completely forgot to add the Parmesan, but it was perfectly fine all the same. I did make a lot more dressing than indicated in the recipe for it to really be tasty.

This was amazing!  I could eat this everyday during the fall!  I added cheese, it was a bit salty, so if you add the cheese cut the salt In half.  I will definitely be making this again!  I loved it!!

This is not my favorite quinoa salad.  I think the maple syrup and the chicken broth are the parts that killed it for me.

Excellent - I've made it without the cheese, usually, but I think feta could be good.  Also switched out the pecans for sliced, toasted almonds and was equally as good as the pecans.  Love the dressing.

Loved it!  Used walnuts instead of pecans, because it's what I had available. I did roast them before mixing them in, which I think helped.  Delicious and light!

I liked this dish a lot but I did make some slight changes.  I tossed the chopped apples in a squirt of lemon juice to keep them from browning.  I used walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had on hand.  I also used 1 tablespoon of pure maple syrup (the real stuff, not maple flavored corn syrup) and I omitted the cheese because it just sounded like it would not pair well with the other ingredients. 
It's true this salad is on the sweet side, but I liked it.

Awesome! Of course I changed some minor things because of diet, but overall I followed the recipe and it was fabulous. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, I roasted fresh cranberries instead of using dried cranberries and I skipped the Parmesan cheese altogether.  Excellent recipe.

I liked it. I looked for a recipe similar to the Trader Joe’s apple quinoa salad, I think I used way too much dijon so the taste is overpowering...

I was a little hesitant about the amount of mustard, but this turned out wonderful. Like many other reviewers, I left out the cheese and did not feel that it would have added to the flavour. I took the leftovers for my lunch and it was great at room temperate as well. Very filling!

The family enjoyed this dish! I added the juice of one orange for more liquid and in hopes of keeping apples from turning. It still looks good as leftovers!

Made this recipe exactly as written, except I did not add the Parmesan cheese, as others suggested. It tasted pretty good, but....
Since that cheese is salty, I did add some salt, and  added some extra Maple Syrup.  The sweet vs savory was wonderful Served it cold, but warm would be tasty also.
Will definitely make this often.

I served this salad cold. I did use the Parmesan cheese and added canned chicken. Instead of making the dressing I used Wishbone Sweet and Spicy Honey Mustard dressing. My family loved it. Will be great summertime light meal.

This was just ok for me.  Fine for a side dish, but not tasty enough to make again.  I didn't get any sweet flavors out of it - it was all savory and I think I would have liked it more if the maple syrup & cinnamon popped more.  It does give me the idea to make again with the apples, pecans, cinnamon, but to use a sweeter base and omit the savory portions.

Made it for a dinner at a friends house, and it got rave reviews. I thought it tasted even better the second day!
