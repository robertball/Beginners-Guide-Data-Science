this cake was very moist but no matter how much you spray and sprinkle the pan with sugar it still came out of the pan in pieces. Very good cake pieces though

Since the only other review mentioned how the cake stuck to the pans, I used parchment paper in mine.  The loaves slid right out!  After 65 minutes of baking the centers seemed to be still liquidy so I turned off the oven and left them in for about another hour.  I used a quart of home canned spiced peaches instead of commerical peaches.  I always sprinkle Turbinado sugar on top of sweet baked goods and I did with this too.  When baking, after 35 minutes, the tops seemed to be getting too brown so I covered with foil.  Upon first taste, it tasted like plain pound cake and it was very moist.  We'll see how it is after it cools completely and sits for a day.  Thanks!

Made this for a recent party and this recipe was wayyyyy too much which went in the favor of my co workers because I made 1 bundt pan and 1 loaf pan.  I only got great compliments.  I had to restrain myself for eating too much.  Delicious and moist.  I ran out of sour cream so I used plain greek yogurt and it worked just as well.  Making this again tomorrow for Thanksgiving but 1/2 the recipe will be plenty.  A must make!

I've made this a few times now, using a variety of pans, and enjoyed it thoroughly each time. I tried it once replacing the peaches with pears, and it came out a bit lacking in flavor, but moist and otherwise good. Second time, I used a combination of peaches and apricots, and the flavor was sublime.  I don't have a loaf pan, but I've experimented and found these were a bit dry as cupcakes, but good as a 9x9. My favorite version was in my cast-iron skillet, with fresh peaches, a touch of grapeseed oil, and a sprinkling brown sugar on the bottom. Peach upside-down cake! Phenomenal.

It turned out really well. Very moist and very very good. I made it with a cream cheese frosting and that really helped balance the sweetness.
