I have been searching for this recipe for years.  It tastes just like what I used to get in a hometown buffet that closed when I was just a kid.  It is one of my favorites!!

My family has made this for as long as I can remember but we call it glorified rice.  Instead of the whipping cream and sugar I add cool whip to it.  Also, it helps if you make the rice the day before so it is completely cooled.

I really liked this recipe. Instead of the whipping cream and sugar, I used coolwhip. Big mistake! I will definitely will follow the recipe next time I make this, other than my mistake, it was delicious!!!!

Thought this was just okay.  I think I like it with nuts better then rice.  It did last serval days in the frig.  Could easily make it 2 or 3 days ahead.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and although I liked it, people just kinda passed by it in the buffet line. I may make it again though.

I've not tried this yet...but this is my Aunt Mae's recipe that she passed down to me.
Yes~! I'm so glad to see it here. Instead of Pineapple..she would use peaches..or even a can of mixed fruit.
