We had some butternut squash come up "volunteer" in the garden this year and I've had to find ways to use it (did roasted, paleo porridge and whipped so far). I don't know what kugel is, but I DO what pumpkin pie is! This looked similar . . . I roasted the squash and then pur√©ed the flesh when it was cooled. I used farm fresh eggs, gluten free flour, 1/4 cup organic cane sugar + 1/2 cup pure maple syrup for sweetness, 2 T. butter + 2 T. coconut oil (melted), 1 t. cinnamon and 1 t. pie spice. Mine took about 45 minutes in the oven (mine is slow). I ate a piece immediately for breakfast. Delicious! Sort-of like a custard pie. Thanks for the recipe!

My kids thought this was the best pumpkin pie ever.  I loved it too.  Easy enough.

Too sweet?  My (adult) kids thought so.  I loved it, but they thought it was too sweet and too eggy.  It IS very rich/heavy.  If the kids had liked it, I'd give it 4 stars.

Easy and yummy, this recipe made excellent use of the butternut squash from the garden.  I added the cinnamon to the batter and next time I will add a little ground clove.  Thanks for sharing!

Way too much flour. I get kugel from a local kosher restaurant and it is much lighter in texture.  Next time I would roast the squash to increase the sweetness and cut down the sugar and flour by half.

It tasted great but the consistency wasn't a hit!  It was too rubbery, thinking I must have done something wrong..  Over beaten or over cooked .... Who knows ?

I never heard of Kugel before and I like it. Next time I am going to add pumpkin pie spice.
