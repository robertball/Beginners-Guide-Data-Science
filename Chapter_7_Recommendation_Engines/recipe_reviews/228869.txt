Good dinner! I loved the quick prep and minimal heat for these hot, humid summer days! I personally found it too much raw garlic...but I still had seconds :) I couldn't find a 16 oz package of pasta so I got two 9 oz packages, and it was waaaay too much; I put about 1/3 aside for another meal. The portions are very generous, think this could easily be 6 main dish servings. Thanks so much for the recipe, JJLuke!

Yummy, and so easy! Husband, 4 yr old, 2 yr old and I all enjoyed it. Only made 2 minor changes: sautéed the garlic in olive oil before adding, and stirred all the veggies (rather than only half) into the warm noodles before topping with remaining ricotta and basil.

Even in the fall I love raw vegetables! I followed as best I could...but just added things that needed to be used. Minimal changes with broccoli, mushroom, green and red onion. I used maybe a quarter the amount of pasta because of preference, and cottage cheese for ricotta. ( I realize I sacrificed a lot there but trying to keep things light ) My college daughter saw the dish chilling in the fridge for dinner and ate half of it. She took more home as well. So I guess that means I will be making it again......thank you for sharing!

Simple and delicious! We folded all the veggie mixture into the pasta instead of saving some for the top. I also didn’t use fresh linguine since it wasn’t on sale this week. Hubby and all the kids liked this recipe.

Very light and refreshing. I love the crunchy zucchini and yellow squash mixed with the creamy ricotta cheese. Loved it!
