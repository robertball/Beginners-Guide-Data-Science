This did nothing for me. The marinade smelled great, but I did not think it did much for the chicken. My husband liked it, but I will not make this again. It was too mild and bland for me.

I used this marinade with fish.  My husband thought it was really good.  I didn't like it as well, but I am not feeling very good, so that might be the reason.

This was so good. I made 3 breasts and my family wanted more. The chicken was super moist. Thanks for sharing.

Spot on!  I used this on Top Sirloin Steak, it would be great on pork, chicken or fish.  Thanks for a good recipe.
