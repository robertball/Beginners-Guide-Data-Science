This is one of my favorite rib recipes. Last saturday I prepared these for a guest list of 40. I had three bbq's on the go. I did something different though. I added mesquite wood chips and let them smoke the whole time. Oh and a trick to removing the membrane: use a dry butter knife and scrap into the membrane at the small end of the back ribs..then take a piece of paper towel and grip that sucker and tug...should come off every time in one piece.

This is the PERFECT spice mix, and the best way to season the meat. Trimming the membrane off is crucial, and actually not that hard to do with a flat boning knife if you insert it parallel to the rib and directly over it. Once you get the first few done, you can grab the membrane and just tear it off the rest. 

But for the preparation, I prefer to SMOKE the ribs Southern-style on a Weber instead of doing them in the oven. The key to this is that you put all the coals in a pile on one side of the grill, then all the meat at the far opposite side. Add the soaked hickory chips and the seasoned meat (no sauce yet) and close the lid quickly, close down the top and bottom vents to about 1/4 open, and leave it that way for an hour. Then, add more soaked chips (adjust the vents if needed) and start basting the meat with the barbeque sauce once every 15 minutes for another hour. Close the lid as quickly as possible every time, as the chips will want to flare up and you want to try to avoid that. 

I've done this at least a dozen times now, and it comes out perfect every time, with the crunchy carmelized sauce on the edges and the meat very tender and juicy.

(1-29-06)This was my first time cooking baby back ribs and what a success! This recipe is very easy and very delicious! Don't be afraid it will fail you--it more than lives up to its five-star rating!  Here are my tips: We had close to 6 pounds of Costco baby backs--very meaty. The butter knife method of removing the membrane (described by another reviewer)worked perfectly. Thanks! I made double the dry-rub and took suggestions by other reviews to decrease the cumin (I used a little over 1T for the double batch and increased the chili powder accordingly) and rub the mixture into the meat a bit (2-14-07 update: take the recipe's caution about not rubbing it in too much seriously. I put too much on my last batch & it was overpowering). We followed the grilling instructions to a 'T'!  Our ribs were perfectly cooked in just under two hours.  Because we had double the amount of meat, I did peek after an hour and 20 minutes to see the progress.  Based on the recipe description, I could tell we needed more time.  We cooked them for about another 20 minutes (next time I won't have to peek!) then added the sauce. I made the sauce in Scott Hibb's Amazing Whisky Grilled Baby Back Ribs recipe 
(5 stars!).  After adding the sauce we grilled as instructed. DELICIOUS!  My husband, who claimed to not like baby back ribs, LOVED these. I loved these! My 6 and 3 year olds loved these. The cooking method, the rub and the sauce are winners! TRY THIS ONE!

This was my second time for this recipe and it rocks!  I used baby back ribs, about 6 lbs so I doubled the rub. I cut down the amount of cumin and added onion and garlic powder. They sat in the refrigerator with the rub on them for a day and a half. I slow cooked them in the oven at 300 degrees for 2-1/2 hours then grilled last 15 minutes with BBQ sauce.  They were the best, fell right off the bone. Look out Tony Romas! Mmmmmmmmmmmmm - the best !

This recipe is *soooo* good!  I have been on the lookout for a good rib rub recipe and this is it!  We can't always bbq were we live, so I cook my ribs at 175 degrees farenheit for appx. 6 or 7 hours.  Yes, slow cooking in the oven.  Don't boil them first!  Never do that!  Just rub them, let them slow cook while you're going about your business.   Then in the last 15 minutes, remove your ribs from the oven, up the heat to 450, slather on a good bbq sauce and let them cook another 10 minutes then serve.   These are downright succulent.  Oh and thank you JEREMYM for your fantastic tip on how to remove the membrane!  Such a helpful tip!!!!

The rub was ok, although I did add oregano and thyme.  But an hour is not nearly what grill masters have in mind when they say ribs should be grilled "low and slow."  Hubs was right - one hour was not long enough for these to be "fall off the bone tender," so at that point I turned it over to his expertise.  There should be nothing quick about barbecued ribs.

Oh my goodness, these are WONDERFUL. We have made them 5 times now and I must say they are foolproof. They key is, you must follow the instructions EXACTLY. Each step is important and the key to these  is to shimmy the membrane in between each rib. I had never thought to do that before and I believe that is what makes these ribs so tender and flavorful. My husband is very picky about his ribs, he even dislikes Tony Roma's ribs, but these he gobbles up and wants to make them all the time. We also add garlic powder and kosher salt to the rub for a little extra flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!

I must say I was a little skeptical, as I've married into a family of Texans and have heard stories of all the steps a proper rib cookout should entail - well, these were really great!  I actually just used an inexpensive, store-bought (gasp!) BBQ sauce, but next time I'll plan ahead and make some of Bubba's Best BBQ Sauce (here on allrecipes.com) and really knock 'em dead.  Great ribs!

This made a memorable picnic for our family today.  Because of a time constraint,yesterday morning, I baked them covered in the oven at 375 for 2 hours with the dry rub. Then before lunch today my husband finished them with the sauce on the grill.

WOW!!! we have never had any luck grilling ribs...but after using this recipe i know we will never have any problems again! This recipe is the absolute best!!! I used the 'dry butter knife' method for removing the membrane and that worked like a charm!! i only used about half the amount of cumin(because thats all i had on hand) I dont think i used more than half of the dry seasoning mix and the ribs just turned out so flavorful! i was a little worried about being able to keep the grill lid shut for a whole hour without peeking...lol...but once that hour is up and you open that lid...the ribs just look amazing!

 im not the 'griller' in the family so everytime i heard it sizzle underneath the grill lid i thought for sure it was the meat catching fire...but to my relief it was just the meat juices hitting the HOT aluminum foil! LOL

these ribs are the BEST and im sure we will be making them again very very soon!! thanks!!!

These ribs were awesome.  Very flavorful.  Easy to prepare.  The texture of the ribs was as if a professional chef had prepared them.  I followed the recipe to a T, except I used commercial BBQ sauce and added a good amount of bottled hot sauce.  I like them a little zippy.  The rub was excellent.   To remove the membrane use a very sharp small knife on the edge of the rack in the middle.  Shimmy the knife with the blade down between the meat and the membrane.  Once you have a good size opening, grip it and pull back across the rack of ribs.  It will pull off.  On the grill make sure you put the ribs on the top rack of the grill.  Also I used heavy duty foil and folded a lip around the foil edge to catch the oil.  It worked fine, make the piece of foil wide enough to cover the area under the ribs.  I did not open the grill even though was tempting.  No flames.  Make sure the temp is on low.  These were great enough to impress company!

I need the grill for other things, so I used the spice rub and baked three racks in foil (each in its own foil packet) for 2 hrs at 300 deg.  Then I took them out, let them set till I was ready to use them, and put them on a medium low grill, flipped them, sauced them, and AMAZING.  Going before they hit the table. Note:  to remove the membrane take a sharp knife, run it along the middle of the smallest bone on the bony side.  Separate it carefully and then just pull it off in one swoop.  Works every time, and no coming off in pieces.  Enjoy and bask in the glory.

I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE, ONLY ADDING SOME ONION AND GARLIC POWDER. I BAKED THEM AT 250 FOR 2.5 HOURS (WE HAD TOO MUCH GRILLING GOING ON TO COOK THEM ON THE GRILL FOR AN HOUR.) TOOK THEM OUT OF THE OVEN, SWABBED THEM IN BBQ SAUCE AND GRILLED THEM UNTIL CRISPY. EVERYONE LOVED THEM AND WERE EVEN PICKING THE CRISPY CRUMBS OFF THE PLATTER!! GREAT RECIPE, WILL BE MY BABY BACK REGULAR FROM NOW ON. THANKS!
7/6/10 update: I tried baking them early in the day as we had a lot of company coming. I removed them from the oven, opened the aluminum foil, added the BBQ sauce, resealed the foil and let them sit on the counter for several hours until we were ready to cook them. Fall off the bone tender & delicious!!

This rub is the best.  The ribs turned out great.  We had to try this recipe a couple of times to get the technique to grilled ribs, but once we did it was great.  We served this with Homesteader conbread from this site.

I had to look pretty far back, but here is the method everyone talks about: use a dry butter knife and scrap into the membrane at the small end of the back ribs..then take a piece of paper towel and grip that sucker and tug...should come off every time in one piece. Going to try this tonight.

As another reviewer put it, the hardest part of this recipe is not opening the grill.  Yes, a bit tedious to prepare, but worth all the effort.  My husband loves them this way, just make sure that they are baby backs, no sub will do.  Thanks Bonnie!

After reading the favorable reviews by people who chose to bake these in the oven, I decided to give these a try. I rubbed the ribs the night before, then wrapped them tightly in plastic wrap, at the suggestion of a friend. The next day I baked them uncovered at 190 degrees for about 5 hours (until tender). I then poured on the barbecue sauce and turned up the oven to 450 degrees until the sauce started to brown. They were fantastic- moist and tender.  I'd like to try this next with boneless country-style ribs. Super simple and absolutely foolproof when done in the oven.

Very good, I was scared to over rub the spices and I think went a little to conservative...next time I'll rub it in a little more... I baked in the oven at 300 for two hours and then 15 mins on the BBQ with the BBQ sauce added....they were a big hit!

I love love LOVED these ribs! This is coming from a girl who has previously refused to eat ribs her entire life! I finally decided to take a stab at making them for the other people in my life that love them and the results meant that there were no leftovers! The tip about removing the membranes? GENIUS. The rub? Awesome! I added a little bit of garlic power and a few chilis to the rub - we like ours spicy..and then i mixed in half a cup of pure maple syrup into the cup of bbq sauce..which made it the perfect combination of sweet and spicy!   I also opted to make them in the oven as it's getting chilly here and didn't want to stand outside at the BBQ. I did the rack of ribs in the convection  oven for 2 hours at 200 degrees and then another 2 hours at 250 degrees..then I cranked it up to 450, cut the ribs apart so they could get really saucy and doused them in sauce....I let them cook for 7 minutes..took them out..turned them..doused them in sauce again and let them bubble and get sticky in the hot oven for another 7 minutes...and oh my god..they were SO GOOD! I will DEFINITELY be making these again and again..this recipe has turned me into a rib lover instead of a skeptic!!

This just wasn't meant to be... first i THOUGHT i bought baby back ribs but i had beef ribs.  I decided to go ahead anyway.  The rub smelled great.  Then i went to grill and the top piece was missing.  So i put them in the oven for 2 hours at 250 degrees covered and on a rack so they didn't sit in the liquid.  I took them out and covered them in bbq sauce then grilled them on low till both sides were the color i wanted.  They were WONDERFUL!!!  Can't wait to use these with actual babyback ribs!! The only things i changed was i added brown sugar to the rub.  It leaves a crust and seals in everything!!

The really unique thing about this excellent recipe is the technique of removing the membrane sheath....something I'll continue to do no matter what seasonings I'm using. (It's EASILY done with a pliers!!) Also, the method of 1 hour/no peeking makes it carefree.  I used a 3 burner gas grill with one turned off so the meat could lie atop, the other 2 burners on "lo".

I have been using this recipe for 2 years and it has become THE BBQ RIB RECIPE for my large extended family!  A few tips for those trying it for the first time:  

*removing the membrane is a must and is easy to do
*do the spice rub in advance of cooking and wrap the ribs in plastic wrap to allow the spices to permeate the ribs.  I usually do it in the morning and let them sit in fridge all day.
*for great extra flavor we use an aluminum foil packet (large one) of soaked mesquite chips placed on coals when we turn on the grill.  They are smoking by the time the grill is really hot.  Soak them as long as possible and leave some water in the packet.  Punch holes in top of packet with a fork to allow the steam to smoke the ribs.
*ABSOLUTELY do not open the grill while cooking!

We usually put two racks of ribs on the top rack of grill and 4 split chicken breasts (also with the rub) right on top of the aluminum foil drip sheet. They are wonderul!

We use Sweet Baby Ray's on both the ribs and chicken breasts after we take them off the grill and place in warm oven along with garlic bread to heat while getting everything ready to serve.  

They are perfect and well deserving of five stars! We usually serve with marinated coleslaw, potato salad and garlic bread.  A great company recipe as everything is made ahead and you can visit while they are cooking.

Have tried this in the oven and while good, nothing beats the grill method with the mesquite flavor.  Have also tried the hickory

I don't normally submit reviews, just read them, but I had to submit a review on these ribs!!  These were so easy and turned out wonderful!  I was a little nervous about removing the membrane (after reading about the difficulty some people had), but I followed the advice from one review and used a butter knife and scraped back a little, grabbed it with a paper towel and tugged.  The whole thing came off in one piece!  I used about all the "rub" for a 3lb. rack and cooked it on the smaller "warming" rack on my gas grill, with foil beneath.  Good thing that foil was there or I would've had a real mess!  I set the grill just a little above low, to maintain a temperature of 300 degrees and DID NOT LIFT THE LID.  I applied BBQ sauce the last 5 minutes and let that cook into the ribs.  It created a BBQ glaze that was beautiful!  Nice presentation!  I got a big "WOW" from my husband.  I have been looking for an easy, delicious rib recipe for a long time and I finally found it!  Will definately make these again.

I have used this rub before on pork loin and it is fabulous. I left out the salt, there is enough in the barbeque sauce. I unfortunately didn't have any gas for the grill and wasn't willing to build a wood fire in the other grill so I put them in the oven.  I wrapped them loosely in foil with non stick spray and cooked them at 350 for 2 1/4 hours.  I then put the barbeque sauce on them and back in the oven nicely wrapped in the foil.  Turned down the oven to 300 and cooked for another hour or so.  I didn't trim them or fuss at all and they are the best ribs ever!  Definitely a keeper.

Since finding this recipe only 3 weeks ago, we have probably made the ribs 4 times, they are that good!  The biggest thing that sets these apart is the membrane removal - I never knew about the membrane before - which is probably why my old recipe for ribs were always chewy and grisly - the membrane is on the underside of the ribs.  I used the butter knife/paper towel method other reviewers spoke of, works like a charm.  The rub is delicious, but if I'm short on time McCormick makes something called "Pork Rub" - a blend of spices in a jar, very similar to this recipe.  We use Jack Daniels Original Sauce.  My parents came up for dinner last weekend and asked me ahead of time to put chicken on the grill too because they "don't eat ribs" - well, guess who ate most of the ribs?  =)  If you want to try baby backs, use this recipe!!!

So very good!  I cook tons of ribs and this was such an easy/good tasting recipe (advice to keep lid shut - very important) I will do again
TIP - easy way to get membrane off - use dull knife like butter knife, slip gentely under membrane and work back and forth, use paper towel to grasp and slowly pull, repeat with dull knife as needed. Should come right off!!

These are awesome!  I have made them on the grill and also in a slow oven.  It's a very favorite of all.  I add a bit of seasoned salt to the rub.  Delicious and always tender.  Whenever I tell my grown up kids that I am making ribs, they come running!  Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

I have never cooked baby back ribs before because I thought they would take too long.  What a quick and easy recipe!!  Very good taste.  I do not have an upper rack on my grill, so I was unsure where to put the foil but I just put it on the cooking rack and put the ribs directly on the foil and they turned out great.  I will definitely make these again.

Awesome!  Thank you Bonnie.

I have always been daunted by making ribs as they have usually burned.  Rub was great, and thanks for the tip on removing the membrane. It was way too cold to use the barbecue (-42)so used the oven.  I lined a baking sheet with foil and placed racks on it.  Lined up 6 slabs of ribs and cooked at 325F for about 2 and half hours.  Every half hour I drained the fat from the pan and turned the ribs.  Used a Canadian Club whisky barbq sauce and basted it twice in the last half hour of cooking. Baked potatoes as well and all the gang could say was "ooh baby, the best ribs ever! Better than Tony Roma's"  We  will never head out to buy ribs again! The 3 teenagers and a husband were still raving the next day!

I will make them for our Superbowl party, but will have to use 2 pans to feed 10 people. So I plan on cooking at 300F for 3 hours and switch racks.  The ribs are cooked when they shrink from the bone and you can wiggle the bones.

These ribs had some nice zip. I cut in between each bone to make appetizers for a large group.  They were easy to prepare ahead of time.  I added the spices a few hours before cooking to give them a little more kick, then put them on the BBQ right before my company arrived.  everyone raved about the ribs, even the big football fans that know their ribs!

I used the dry rub (all of it) and marinated the rack overnight in about a cup of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce overnight. I wrapped the rack tightly in foil and baked them at 300 for two and a half hours. I finished them on the grill, basting them with more sauce, for about 15 minutes. The end result was awesome. GREAT RUB! Not too spicy at all, and it gave the ribs a great flavor. Thank you!

I cannot believe I've never reviewed these ribs.  Since I've started making them, no on in my family would dare to order ribs at a restaurant.  These are just that much better (and much cheaper - buy them at Costco) I do it a bit differently, as I like to bake them in the oven on about 300 degrees for a couple of hours after applying the dry rub.  When they are done, I put on the BBQ sauce and throw them on the grill to get that nice crust.  Delish!

This is a great and easy way to make some ribs.  If you have trouble getting the membrane off, just find a video of it online and you'll find its easy as all heck.  Also, I added 1/2 table spoon of cayenne to add a little kick.

Perfect, meat was juicy and falling off the bone. I left out the chili powder for my daughter and instead used garlic powder. We all enjoyed these!

10+ - I was not able to use a grill but followed reviewers who made this and also had to use an oven.  Put the rub on as directed and then baked the baby back ribs in a 325 oven for 1 hour - turned them over and cooked another hour.  Slathered barbecue sauce on after the 2 hours and broiled them 
for 5 minutes.  These were the most outrageous, tender juicy ribs I have ever made - and I have used many recipes from this site.  Can't wait to try the 1 hour method with a grill. I will definitely make these ribs again over the week-end.  Thanks Bonnie Q!

This is the BEST recipe for Baby Backs!  I took the advise of another reviewer and kept the grill at 300 degrees (which on my grill was about medium).  They turned out so delicious and tender.  I am so glad I read the reviews and finally found out how to remove the membrane (super easy using butter knife and paper towel - came off in one piece).  My only concern prior to putting on the grill was whether to put the meat side up or down.  After looking at other's comments and not finding the answer, I put the meat side up.  Not sure if this matters, but they came out perfect.  My husband was skeptical when I told him how I was grilling the ribs, but when he took his first bite, he was a believer.  This is the only way I'll cook ribs!  Thanks for sharing Bonnie.

These were great.. I must admit I didn't do them on the grill: I did the rub, wrapped in tinfoil & put in the oven at 300 degrees for 3 hours - then put in a crockpot with BBQ sauce for another 2 hours.  My friend the chef said they were some of the best ribs she's ever had!  They fell right off the bone!

I always thought that the best ribs must be made slowly until they are tender on the grill only. This, however, always results in burned ribs that never get very tender even if you use foil wraps and such. But I've read enough recipes to know now that the secret is in this boiling process beforehand. I didn't have this recipe on hand when I made these but I do give this recipe 5 stars for the unique technique of removing the membrane. No one else ever mentions it. And it does just pull right off once you manage to get a good grip on it. Pliers probably would work well. I didn't use the rub, I didn't marinade. I just boiled in plain water and grilled with some good quality BBQ sauce out of a bottle. They were the best I ever made. Next time I will try the rubs and marinades because even though the meat came out very tender the meat could have used a little more infused type flavor. The sauce was wonderfully sticky and gooey as it should be but the BBQ flavor was all on the surface. Thanks for the technique Bonnie. I'll never be reluctant to make ribs again.

Ribs turned out less tender than expected.  Also, this cooking method leaves the ribs fattier than other methods.

Really simple & easy recipe for some great ribs. I added garlic salt instead of regular salt as we like our garlic in this household. They looked like the ones you see on shows about rib cook-offs! Used the butter knife method for removing the membrane & it does work well. Will be making these again!

These ribs were amazing!  The BBQ on low was about 250-300 degrees.  I did open the lid once to put baked potatoes on and gave it an extra 5 minutes.  Spices are just right and then brushed the bbq sauce on at end and gave it another 5 minutes to set. Thanks Bonnie, wouldn't change a thing and am thinking this combination will be good on chicken too!

FINALLY, I can make ribs on the grill.  For years I've only made them in the oven because I like my ribs tender, and found that they were too tough on the grill.  Now I finally found a recipe that showed me how to do it and have tender, but not too tender (as my oven ribs were) ribs.  I'm so excited.  I don't always use the dry rub suggested (I'll put my own concoction on there) and put BBQ sauce on them as suggested here.

I followed the suggestions of removing the membrane with the butter knife and it worked great! I used a Weber gas grill and placed my aluminum foil over the "V" inserts and grilled the ribs on the main grill.

My mom recommended the recipe.  It caught our grill on fire and charred the ribs.  Awful!

I did not use the rub listed here (I came here for the timing, not for the recipe), but the method and timing worked excellently for me. I used my Salt Lick BBQ rub, but not too liberally. Cooked it on the upper rack of the grill with the foil below (great idea), then moved it to the bottom for the last 10 minutes (5 on each side) with one coat of sauce per side. It was great timing (even with opening and closing the grill to move around my corn) and came out tender and delicious. As a Texas-raised, Cali-living girl, this really hit the spot this past Memorial Day weekend. Well done!

only giving this 3 stars because of the changes i would make to recipe to suit a different flavor profile.  too much cumin/chili powder/paprika ... just overpowers really.  i ended up putting in brown sugar to cut the intensity of the other flavors.  also, i did as others had suggested and baked these in the oven for about 90 min @ 350' before searing bbq on the grill.  they were fall off the bone tender and aside from the dry rub ... very very good.  we managed to scrape some of the rub off, which made them better.  next time, i will use something all together different for the dry rub - i definitely think they need something while baking - just not this one in particular.

I cut the slab of ribs in half and grilled on gas grill with heat coming from both sides of the ribs, not under.  It took 3.5 hours to finish.  Good tasting thing

These were pretty good but they needed to cook much longer.  A rib is ready when the  meat pulls away from the end of the bone...almost 3 hours.

Really nice.  Did one set without the rub since my sister hates spice.  They still tasted good but not amazing like the ones with both rub and sauce.  I used the Jamaican Barbecue sauce from this site.

Made this over Memorial Day weekend and ended up having to bake them in the oven as another reviewer recommended due to threat of rain. I actually only used the dry rub and didn't add the wet sauce because the rub smelled so good. They were falling off the bone and tasted fantastic! Can't wait to try them on the grill!

Excellent! Let them sit in the fridge overnight with the rub then baked them at 350 for 3 hours. Slathered with sweet baby ray's and grilled for about 15 minutes were so tender they were falling off the bone. Have made twice in the last month and I am sure to make them again in the very near future.

I usually do ribs in a smoker with a dry rub similar to the one in this recipe. But I was feeling lazy one day and decided to use this grill method. It turned out OK. You need to have a grill that is just slightly vented when shut. Many of the new gas grills have a large vent opening in the back when the lid is shut. This tends to let too much dry heat flow across the ribs and increases the cooking time. I’ll try this again but use a drip pan filled with 2 cups water, 3 cups apple cider and a can of Coca Cola to add moisture to the closed grill. The cider mixture reduces and mixes with the drippings and creates a great base for your homemade BBQ Sauce.

I didn't believe it but my baby backs turned out just like the ribs from a pit BBQ! Until now I had always pre-cooked my ribs in the oven and finished them on the grill. No more! My husband is from Texas and half way through dinner he paused and said "You aren't going to cook them any other way are you? They taste just like home." Need I say more? I kept the grill temp. at 300 and cooked them for an hour and 1/2. These ribs were tender and delicious without being over cooked and falling off the bone, which we don't like. I even threw several chunks of chicken on the grill with the ribs and they also came out perfect. I haven't been this excited about a new recipe in a long time. Thank you so much for posting this 5+ star recipe!

We never make ribs without this rub now -- OR without removing the membrane - what a difference that makes. We struggled at first, but finally got the hang of it (hint-use a regular table knife-not a sharp one). Terrific recipe! I cook them in the oven as often as on the grill and they're great that way too!

These were good, but a little dry.  They get an 'A' for being easy, but we prefer the tenderness of boiling them first.

The spices smelled really good, and the cooking method seemed like a good idea... but a little on the dangerous side.  The drippings in the pan caught on fire and started quite the blaze after 30 minutes of cooking.  Luckily I caught it in time pulled the ribs out of the inferno with really long tongs.  They were a little charred on one side but not done, so I finished them in the oven.  I'm sure they would have turned out great...had they not caught fire.  Oh well, good luck to everyone else- and be careful!

This looked so wonderful up until the last 10 minutes.  All the grease that pooled on the foil liner caught fire and almost burned the grill...we almost rolled the grill into the pool.  Needless to say, the grease was a problem, and what resulted was $25 worth of black bones.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  I have never cooked ribs before and these turned out just beautifully. I followed the directions exactly, exept for I did not use as much of a seasoning as the recipe makes.  For barbeque sauce used KC Masterpiece Hickory one and it added a very nice touch. Thanks a lot, have made it several time already!

These ribs are fantastic! We have already made these twice this summer. No more burned ribs and the meat is so tender. The rub adds a special zing. This is the first recipe I added to my recipe box.

Wow, I have always avoided cooking ribs, but this recipe took care of that. It was so easy. The hardest part was not looking during the hour cooking time. Will make these again and again. Made Cowboy Mashed Potatoes yummy.(from website)Even the grandkids couldn't get enough. Thanks for the great recipe.

For years I have been trying recipes for ribs, most requiring plenty of effort and time. None of those recipes turned out as well as this one. I can't believe how little effort was involved but they tasted like I slaved for hours. I love this recipe and will use it again and again!

These ribs were delish. The only change I would make is to take it easy on the cumin.  Otherwise, yum, yum.

I originally tried this recipe a couple of years ago.  I believe that the secret is to start with good quality ribs and removing the membrane is absolutely vital to them coming out tender.  It works well with whatever rub you like.  So far I have not found any better recipe.

The instructions say to remove the membrane by snipping it between each bone but that is very tedious work.  I start at one end (usually the smaller end) and strip the full length of the rib in one go.  It saves a ton of time and is far less frustrating.

Good. I expected more flavor but it was flavorful. It was very easy to make and grilling on low for an hour made the meat perfect. I will definately make this again but maybe add some other seasoning that I like to the rub.

I made these ribs in the oven with my Le Creuset braiser...they turned out picture perfect.  If only I had taken one to show you...next time.  Add a bit of olive oil and a splash of water to the Braiser for a self basting wonder.  The Recipe was easy to follow.  I had the oven on maybe a touch too high (475-500 F) but the ribs turned out pretty good.  I'll lower the heat a bit next time and see what that does.

These are WONDERFUL! So easy and very fail-proof! I followed the recipe exactly and I would not change a thing. If you like a sweet BBQ sauce-Sweet Baby Ray's is excellent. Thanks so much for such an easy rib recipe!

These ribs made a mess on the grille from falling off the bone!  Slow cooked in oven on 175 for 5.5 hours and then grilled them. Excellent!

I made this recipe for my husband as I don't like ribs.  I rubbed the stuff all over the ribs, poured on the KC Masterpiece honey bbq sauce, wrapped them in foil, and let them sit in the fridge for about 24 hours. The next day, I cooked them in the oven at 300 for 3 hours.  Then when my husband came home from work, he stuck them on the grill and coated them with more sauce.  He said the taste was awsome and they fell off the bone.  I will definately make again.  Thanks!

Finally, I can bbq ribs! These are 'to die for' and sooo easy which is the best part. A sweet chicken and rib q sauce glazes them the best and the sweet complements the spicy. Thank you for a great recipe!!!!

I will have to say this is the easiest and best rib recipe that i've tried. I followed the instruction to the tee with the exception of cutting the cummin in half.  I fired up the gas grill until it reached 350, shut of one side and turned the other side to low. I put the ribs on the side without the direct heat and let them cook.  They were fantastic!! Thanks for sharing.

These are DELICIOUS! I used a light coating of mustard on the ribs first before the rub (my dad swears by this..) and they were great! I really like Austin's Own Mild BBQ sauce (HEB) because it has a lot of flavor, but it's not too hot for the kids. These taste straight out of a BBQ restaurant!

These are perfect!  So easy and they turn out beautifully.  I used to boil my ribs first and then grill them to make them tender but cooking them low and slow for an hour on the grill this way made them extremely tender.  The spice mixture is great.  WARNING: Make sure you cook on upper shelf of your bbq.  If you don't have an upper shelf make sure you put the ribs fatty, meat side up and turn off one of the burners or most likely your meat will catch fire.

I honestly couldn't believe that ribs could turn out so tender after only an hour on the grill... but I'm convinced now!  These ribs turned out so great, two days later, my family is already begging me to make them again.  One TIP - if you're using a larger grill as I was, try to maintain your grill temperature at 350 degrees F.  This may require you to turn the grill to medium or even medium-high.  Otherwise, I'm afraid the ribs would have been very rare after only an hour.

GREAT RECIPE!

I cooked these a few weeks ago for my husband and myself,  He is not a big fan of ribs but he love these, they were delicious..I am cooking about 8lbs of ribs for Father's Day. Should I increase the cooking time? I will be cooking on a gas grill.

This was my first time making baby back ribs, so part of my disappointment may come from that and I won't blame the recipe.  The flavor this recipe created was awesome, we just found that the meat was drier than we would have liked.  Will probably try again and hopefully not overcook the meat...

The rub gave the meat a fantastic flavor, but my ribs needed to cook way longer than an hour.  I had them in an hour and fifteen minutes, and they looked ok but cutting into them one of my two racks was underdone.  I've thrown the pan of them into the oven for a while to finish them, and hopefully they will be ok.  I think my grill was set TOO low, so next time I will monitor the heat a little better.  Great potential, though.  Taking off that membrane was a hint I'd never heard before, and it really made a difference!  I'm hoping to be able to upgrade this review to 5 stars the next time I make them -- just need to cook them long enough!

I preheated the grill to about 400 degrees and then followed the remainder of the recipe, but the ribs were rather tough. I finished them in my crock pot.  The flavor is excellent. I did use less cumin and put a honey flavored bbq sauce.  I intend to make these again, maybe increasing the grill time another 15 minutes or so. Thanks, Bonnie. This is a keeper. 
I am editing the above.  I tried this recipe a 2nd time and increased the pre-heat time to 500 degrees and grilled the designated time. It did make a difference. I could hear the sizzling, but was determined to not open the grill.  The extra heat made a difference.  I cannot wait to make these again.

We tried these this past weekend and they were great.  I will leave them in half an hour more to see if they get anymore tender.  The rub was wonderful too. Moist and tender.  Definately worth a try for anyone that loves ribs but hates to watch them for hours.  Also might try some soaked hickory chips on the tinfoil and see if we get a smokey flavor.  What a great recipe.  Thank you

The flavor on these ribs were great.  My ribs were a little tough but I am wondering if it was just the cut of meat.  I did like the ease of the indirect heat not messing up my grill and cooking them slow and long.  I have boiled ribs first in the past and then grilled but this was nice to not have to mess with boiling them.  2nd time I made these I did it in the oven on 315 for 2 hrs covered on a stone jello roll platter then added BBQ and raised temp to 350 for about 15 min uncovered.  I only needed to use half the seasonings and even then the cumin was a bit too strong for our taste.

This is so delicious! I used this recipe on thick bone-in pork chops and barbecued them for about 15 minutes. I smothered the chops in bbq sauce and transferred them to a 170 degree oven for another hour. They were extremely tender and tasty! I keep a shaker bottle of this spice mix in my pantry now!

we really wanted to BBQ something other than burgers and came across this recipe. I wanted to give a try but my husband was a bit reluctant due to the fact that we cannot open the lid for one hour. Well, i insisted and the Ribs came out AWESOME! I cut down on the cumin and wished we added a bit chili powder to give it an extra kick. I cannot wait to grill this again but i will lower the temp from 350 to 300 and keep the lid close for an additional 1/2 hr to see if it falls of the bone tender.

I've never cooked ribs before and tried this recipe tonight. They were really good. 

I was looking for something fairly straight forward and these fit the bill.

The rub was good but I added a few things like garlic powder and light brown sugar which gave them an amazing taste. 

They were tender but not fall off the bone tender. Not sure how I can change that. I heated my gas grill up to about 600 and then turned the heat right down to low as I put them on. They seemed to cook at about 450 for the full hour. Next time I might try to keep the heat a little lower and cook them longer. I did have them on the top rack away from the direct heat as well with the foil underneath.

Regardless they were REALLY good and something I would serve to company no problem.

Can't wait to eat them again.

Delicious!  Based on other reviews, we played around with the seasoning a bit and cooked the ribs for almost 90 minutes.  This recipe is a keeper!

I have tried ribs so many times without any success, so when I found this recipe with all the great reviews I thought I would try it one more time. I followed the recipe exactly, but the ribs were not even close to being done. I had to finish them off under the broiler, but then when we tasted them the dry rub was so awful we couldn't even eat them. This was the last time that I will ever attempt to cook/grill/prepare ribs. The only thing that worked in this was how to get the membrane off and that wasn't even in the original recipe!

Terrific recipe - I've been using it ever since I found it. Variations I've tried include substituting chipotle chilli powder instead of regular - gives a nice smoky flavor; adding some fresh garlic; smothering the ribs with dijon underneath the rub; as well as cooking the ribs on the crockpot prior to finishing on the grill. Everyone LOVES these ribs!

I followed the cooking directions and used a rub here in Austin (Rudy's).  Cooking directions on ribs are the key to good ribs...these were incredibly moist and tender...the guys devoured them.  I don't like meat (and they always tease me when I eat it)...Well, we wiped out two huge racks, the teens, the hub, me and the teens friend. Good stuff..made it on the Weber..with smoke chips.  Awesome!

I used this recipe for the seasoning and will rate it as such. The in-laws and better half loved it. I thought it was good, but a different taste to ribs that I wasn't prepared for.  I did not grill the ribs, but instead baked them for 2.5+ hours at low temperature, then spread on the barbecue sauce and broiled them for 7-10 minutes, until sauce was bubbly. The meat was tender, but not quite falling off the bone--I like to pick my rib up and eat it, not cut it on my place with a fork! Try this seasoning for a different taste--you just might be pleasantly suprised.

This recipe is AMAZING!!  I have never cooked ribs before and this recipe was simple and delicious.  My entire family raved about it.  I used the paper towel technique to remove the membrane and it worked like a charm.  I also didn't realize that I did not have an upper rack to my grill until I went to go fire it up.  No worries-- Just cut two layers of foil to fit before heating the grill.  Once heated and ready, I laid the precut pieces of foil on the rack and placed the ribs meat side up so that the juices would have a place to pool under the ribs instead of the meat frying in its own grease.  No problems at all!  Turned out amazing! Highly recommend!!

Wow this is awesome!  I added 1 TBSP of Garlic and onion powder to the rub, and I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce.  I will certainly be making this again.  And thanks for the tip with the butter knife and paper towel.  Boy was it easy that way!

This is a great recipe.  The ribs come out tasty and tender without having to bake them in the oven beforehand like a lot of "grilled" rib recipes call for.  Be sure to use a quality bbq sauce for the basting in the last 5 minutes.  We like KC Masterpiece.

These ribs turned out awesome.  I actually cooked on indirect LOW heat for about 4 hours.  The meat fell off the bone.  I will try a bit less chili powder next time.  Just my personal tast preference.

This recipe has made me a star!  The removing of the membrane is the best cooking tip I have ever seen! I have even used pork spare ribs with this, once I mastered the skills.  I have never had them catch on fire. I heat my grill, prepare the ribs, then, when open the grill to lay out the foil, I reduce the heat, place the ribs on the top grill, and then I do not open it for any reason. I know that some grills don't have a super low setting, and that is what you need to do this recipe. After the hour, I TURN OFF THE GRILL, then I open it. Baby backs are always done, the spare ribs take a little longer, so if they are not done, I remove the old foil, lay in new foil, THEN TURN THE GRILL BACK ON and close. When they are done, I slather them with sauce and just let them sit for a little while, on the unlit grill, the heat usually is enough to finish them off. I swear by this recipe, thank you so much!!

It was quite tedious triming the membrane from the rack of ribs.  It might be easier if you cut each rib into individual pieces.  I followed the  directions exactly and after 30 minutes on the grill, my ribs were on fire.  Probably not the direction's fault but I may just have a very hot grill, even on low.  While they were a tad charred, my husband said they were the best ribs he ever had and I thought they good too (just too burnt for me).  I'll make the recipe again but will probably bake them in foil first and then finish them off on the grill.

I made this recipe on father's day for my husband and my dad (I usually don't like to deal with the rib mess).  However, I ended up wishing I had bought more ribs to cook because they were so wonderful - tender, too.  I only put the spices on the meatiest side.  It was plenty spicy - great combination of spices.  Thanks, Bonnie!

The meat was falling off the bone...delish!

Spices on point, however kept on grill for 2 hours over indirect heat then added butter, wrapped in foil placed back on grill for 1 hour. Awesome Ribs, let everyone add sauce if they wanted.

I used this rub to make baby back ribs on my Weber Spirit gas grill for the first time - first attempt was good, second was out of the park.  The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was the cumin, so even without that it was absolutely great.

The rub is not super spicy, so family members with a blander preference were happy with it.   The grill's lowest temperature is 250 deg F. running one burner, so cooking is a bit shorter.  30 minutes one side, 45 minutes the other, wrap in aluminum foil and return to grill for 1-1/2 to 2 hours.  Dee-licious!  Couldn't be easier to fix.

This is a fantastic rub for ribs and chicken wings.   I use it with “a really good BBQ sauce” from this site.   I did not make any changes to the rub.   It is fantastic as is!!!

Finally, a recipe for baby back ribs that can be done on the grill without pre-baking in the oven.  I read many reviews and so many bake in the oven.  I guess no one lives in the desert where summer temps average about 108--we do not run the oven at all in the summer, makes the house unbearable. This recipe was great for us and now we will have ribs more often.  I did cut the chili powder in half and subsituted with garlic powder to make a little less spicy.  Oh, and use the smoked paprika too.

I had my doubts, but was proven wrong! This method worked great on a charcoal weber. I built a hot fire on one side, piled a bunch of charcoal up, and laid the ribs on the opposite side. No need for foil as any drippings were not landing on hot coals. I did open it more than once and they were fine. Thought it would take much longer, but nope. These ribs are killer!

Flavor was good--added garlic powder and celery seed to the mix, which they sat in overnight--but they definitely need more than an hour on the BBQ!!  They were cooked after an hour, but no where near fall-off-the- bone.  Wish I'd read more of the reviews first.  Will try again, but with a much longer cooking time!!

We tried this last night and it was so good. It was so easy to make too. Just put the rub together and put it on the ribs. Set the ribs in the grill and leave it on low for an hour. Add some BBQ sauce and voila! Magnifico!

Very delicious. I felt like I was at Famous Daves.

Definitely want to bake before putting on grill.  I would recommend 90 minutes at 350 degrees.  I put on the warming rack on my grill which worked just fine.  Watch your grill temp closely.  I had to shut off three of the four burners to keep the temp down.  Put them on direct heat the last ten minutes.  the rub worked great.  Gave the ribs a nice crisp texture on the outside.  There were no leftovers.  Will definitely do again and will experiement with cooking times and temps.

I made this for some beef baby back ribs. I used a lot less (just enough to coat the ribs), added some olive oil for it to stick and two grated cloves of garlic. Very tasty. Feel free to put a thick layer of this rub on because the flavor is really good when it soaks in.

THANK YOU BONNIE Q.!!!!!!!!!!! These were the most amazing ribs!! I love baby backs but we don't have them often due to price, but when I get them I worry how well I will cook them. No worries ever again with this recipe. I did have a snaffu and had to adjust so let me tell you what I did. I doubled the dry rub because I had about 7.5 lbs of ribs. I didn't use it all either. I added 2 tsps. of cinnamon (just because I like it on pork). I only had about a half cup of sauce but I stretched to cover them all! I started my Q before I started preparing the ribs. When I went out to put them on, I was out of propane!!!! WHAT? Crumb!! I brought them and put them on cookie sheets and covered them with foil loose on the ends and baked them at 350 for the hour. Then I uncovered them, and they smelled AWESOME, and added the smidgen of sauce I had and put them back in while I finished the rest of our dinner, about 15 minutes. SERIOUSLY?? BEST EVER RIBS!! THANKS AGAIN!!!

I prepare these the night before in the oven.  I warm them in the oven before putting them on the grill for the barbecue.  I used Scott Hibb's Amazing Whiskey Grilled Baby Back ribs recipe for the barbecue sauce while heating over the grill.  They are amazing. The meat falls off the bone.

This is a fabulous recipe!! I cooked this for about 18 people so obviously I added to the recipe. I did a few things different as well. The membrane is easy to pull of as stated in anthers review. Once you get it started just pull and it peels fairly easily. We're not very fond of 'chili" flavor so I reduced it a little and added onion powder as well. I slow cooked the ribs in the oven for 6 hrs at 200 degrees due to the fact of having 3 slabs to cook at once. Then I put them on the grill for 45 minutes and slathered them with BBQ sauce. Everyone LOVED these!! They were falling off the bone and the texture was amazing!

Very easy and delicious!  Great recipe when you haven't planned on having ribs and can't marinate them overnight.  Next time I want to try them with out the BBQ sauce and just have the dry rub.

Used a different rub, but the technique is outstanding.  It was hard not to peek. We will be cooking our ribs this way from now on.

I followed the directions exactly. I was afraid the ribs would be too spicy but stillI used most of the spice mix. My husband said "These are the best ribs I've had in a loooong time". The membrane removal was a bit tricky, but paid off. The ribs were tasy, juicy and tender.  Thanks for the great recipe. I will definately use it again! :)

These were wonderful.  I'm usually afraid to try to fix ribs because there are so many methods and so many recipes but we just decided to give this one a try.  I'm so glad we did!  We used the oven method b/c my husband was afraid they would burn on the grill and baked them slowly and they were just delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'm going to try the grill method some day when he isn't home :)

Really, really good. The only thing I added were some soaked mesquite wood chips giving the slabs a great smoky flavor. Entire family said these were the best we've made at home.

I followed the recipe exactly and they looked picture perfect, tasted just OK, but I was quite disappointed in how tough they were.  My husband likes his ribs to fall off the bone and these definitely didn't.

Used the seasoning and instructions, added Scott Hibb's Amazing Whiskey Grilled Baby Back Ribs sauce during the last 15 or 20 minutes. I think they could have been grilled longer, but i didn't use enough charcoal. Taking off the membrane (fascia) a must, especially that between the bones. Hard work but so worth it!

This was AWESOME!  We put yellow mustard on the ribs before putting the rub on - which worked out really well (next time I think I'm going to use dijon mustard - think it'll be that much better), and I think I'll use a smidge less cumin as we found it to be just a bit too much for our taste.  Excellent recipe - can't wait to make ribs again this weekend!

Very good and very easy recipe that the family really went for.  I was surprised by the full flavor of the rub yet it did not overpower the pork.  Pork ribs are from pork and should taste like pork and not just the sauce or marinade.

Made this for  Memorial Day gathering and it went over quite well. I used about 9 lbs of ribs so adjusted accordingly. Also cut down a tad on cumin and added garlic/onion powder. Precooked in oven at 300 for 2 hrs so all I had to do was slap em on the grill and brush with barbeque sauce...really was a good turn out

I saved back the last star because my ribs were not "babies?. I used a 5 lb rack of spare ribs, pork, and all the same rubs and recipes. Baby ribs, if not on special, are not an economical supper. My spare ribs were, however, very tasty and good.  They needed another 30 min at 330 to 335 to get done  They were crusty and pleasant, but perhaps more chewy than is usual with "baby back".Incidentally, did you know that the baby back ribs and the spares come from the same pig? The baby back simply come from "higher up on the hog!"  This recipe is certainly a good, reliable and simple way to prepare ribs, from which the individual cook will proceed.

Absolutely fabulous! Removing the fat and keeping the rub on the ribs for 2 days before is well worth it! They fall right off the bone, I could eat these without BBQ sauce.

I've used this a few times and turned out great.  Simple and perfect mix of spices!  Thanks for this recipe, I will always use this for my ribs!  I just wanted to add that I've also experimented with pork steak with this rub and it's delicious of course.  I wonder if you couldn't use it on other meats as well.  I have made this dozens of times since first review and still love it as much.

These were the best ribs ever!
I used my own mix of spices, but cooked them on a gas grill just over 1 hour. I didn't open the lid once. They came out perfectly tender, but not falling off the bone. Great recipe....thanks for sharing it.

I followed the advice of another poster when preparing and cooking this.  I used the dry ingredients as a rub and cooked the meat (pork shoulder ribs) on a propane grill under indirect heat (this means off of the flame on the other side of the grill and covered) for one hour. They looked and smelled amazing at this point.  I then began basting about every 15 minutes with the sauce for another hour (used some regular old Kraft BBQ sauce).  They came off after 2 hours with a semi-glazed sauce and stayed pretty juicy.  Overall they tasted good but not great.  For me it was the type of meat I used and the cumin.  For some reason the cumin overpowered the sauce?  If I make these again I am definately going to cut the cumin in half.  I should mention that my girlfriend thought they were amazing, hence the 4 stars instead of 3 (whip cracks in the background).

Ohn My gosh! this came out really good. I cooked this for Father's Day and my family just can't get over how delicious it was! never cooked baby back ribs before and not a good cook at all and pulled it, the recipe was really easy to follow but next time I will let the rub sit for a bit, say overnight that way it will absorb the rub flavor. I followed the advice of someone reducing the cumin which is really over powering. Thanks!!!

I didn't sauce these ribs, as I wanted to know the true taste of the meat.  I was afraid to use the cumin rub, and used my "Old Faithful" salt, pepper, garlic, and celery salt.  I've never ever cooked a more scrumptious rack of ribs.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

My family raves about this recipe!  It is foolproof and really tasty.  If you like your ribs slightly spicy, I think the ribs should marinate in the rub for a few hours before grilling.

This was my very first attempt at making baby back ribs and they turned out absolutely terrific, thanks to the delicious recipe, which I followed to a "T".  My husband doubted that they could remain on the grill for an hour without peeking but I took away his grill apron and told him to sit and stay.  He couldn't believe how perfect they were and enjoyed every mouthful, as did I.

I have to be honest and admit I only use this recipe for the dry rub and cook my ribs entirely differently but the rub is enough to recommend this recipe.

Wow! This was my first time ever making ribs @ home! My husband said they tasted better than any we've had at a restaurant! I ran out of cumin the day before so instead of that and the chili powder I used cajun seasoning and added extra paprika and garlic powder. Removed the membrane (so easy!) and grilled them for an hour. Used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ (yum!) and they fell off the bone!!! What an amazing recipe, one I will definitely use over and over!!! Thanks a lot!

This recipe is fantastic.  The first time I made these I accidentally overcooked them because I got busy with other parts of my meal and they were still fastastic!  Even without topping with BBQ sauce these are great.  The whole membrane thing takes some time and I did not notice a huge difference between the racks I did and did not do this to.  This is a great recipe.

Good ribs, however, I would change a few things. I would simmer ribs to assure tenderness (this would also cut grilling time in half), bring simmered ribs to room temp.,rub with spice mixture, then wrap and refrigerate until time to grill. Also, I would not use commercial sauce again, but prepare my old stand by that I get rave reviews from.  I was a little concerned about a fire (with my gas grill) after reading other reveiws, so I purchased a one time use aluminum pan, placed it on the lower grill with a little water in it, and put the ribs on the upper grill.  No problem.  Thanks for the recipe.  :-)

We were VERY impressed with the way these ribs turned out!!  Our grill could barely handle 2 slabs(it's a very small gas grill).  So, after preparing as directed, we double wrapped in foil, and baked-on a cookie sheet-at 270 for 1 1/2 hour.  We turned the heat up to 325 for another 30 mins.  When we pulled them out, and unwrapped them they were falling off the bone moist and delish!  BUT, we wanted the BBQ flavor, so we carefully slathered 'em up with Sweet Baby Ray's spicy/tangy sauce and grilled a couple of minutes a side.  We served them with Restaurant Style Coleslaw 1 and Cowboy Mashed Potatoes-both from this site.  I can't wait til tomorrow to eat what little is left over!!

I don't think I have a "prize Winning" grill so this recipe didn't work out for me! Taking off membrane is good to help reduce flare-ups but after 1 hour my ribs were quite "rare"....so i had to hurry them up a bit and they were a little crisp on the outside.  If you know your grill well (temp 350) theis recipe should work out for you.

Oh my gosh!  These ribs are to die for!  I felt like I was eating at a BBQ joint.  Very easy to prepare.  The toughest part is resisting the temptation to open the grill before the hour is up.

This recipe was very good.  I made these for a trip to our family cabin. It was my very time doing ribs and they had so much flavor.  It was the hit of the weekend.  I just have one question, when the ribs are in the oven are they covered or uncovered??

Used regular spareribs in stead of baby backs.  Cooked 4 lbs 1 hour 15 minutes.  Could have cooked longer but they were still yummy!

So so so so SO so good!!! My review is for the cooking method, not the seasoning. We have a seasoning we love and used that instead of making our own!! We have a small Weber charcoal grill. We grilled one rack at 350° (it fluctuated between 300-400° for the whole time, but next time we make them, we’ll hold steady at 350°F!) for just over and hour and then put only about 1/2 C of sauce on for the last 5 minutes. Were they fall-off-the-bone tender? Not quite. But they WERE tender, easy to eat, and crazy delicious!!!! If you’re a rib snob that gets butthurt over not taking 4 hours to grill ribs, then this recipe isn’t for you. But if you want quick, delicious ribs, this is ABSOLUTELY for you!!!

Using this method, it's the first time I've been able to make decent ribs on my gas grill without parboiling them first. The rub is really flavorful, too, and sort of caramelizes on the ribs. Don't open the grill, don't raise the temperature, just trust that they'll be done and falling-off-the-bone tender when the time is up. Super easy and foolproof!

I have been making this recipe for years, and it is always a hit.  In fact, I quadruple the recipe for the seasoning whenever I make it so that the seasoning is always on hand.

I know NOTHING about grilling ribs but this meal made me look like an Executive Chef!  Lol!  Everyone loved it and as another user stated, I made this 3 times in a 7 day period!  

Thank you Bonnie

This is the best rib recipe we have made. My husband raves about them every time.  We do leave them on the BBQ longer than suggested when we add the BBQ sauce just to add more flavour. Our grandchildren love them and always ask fur to make them when they come to visit.

Did not make any changes and they were absolutely prize winning. The key is heating up the BBQ to high before placing the ribs in the BBQ, then close the lid quickly. They immediately begin cooking as they are so close to the heat source. I used Bold BBQ sauce and that was perfect.

5 stars for the rub!! So easy and with ingredients that I usually have at home already. Will definitely be using this rub from now on! ... I cut the cumin in half based on other reviews. For the salt and pepper, I used 1/2 tsp each. This made enough to generously cover 1 rack of ribs. We used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and the whole family LOVED this flavor combo!! ... For a fast weeknight meal, we cook the ribs in an instant pot (20 min on high and 15 natural release) then add sauce and finish in the oven or on the grill (10 min). ... can't wait to try this rub on chicken!!

The cooking time was too short.  The ribs were tough.  Should have cooked them at least 2 hours.  Also, the sauce was runny and not carmelized until I took the foil off the pan and baked for another 15 minutes.

I love this and will be mak8ng them this way for now on! The only thing that I forgot to do was put the ribs on tin foil... I laid them directly on the grill and they still came out amazing with a light char on them.

Amazing!!! I'm not the best on the grill and to make ribs I was a little weary of the task. I followed the recipe exact but used regular pork ribs and added another 30 minutes basting with BBQ sauce twice. They smelled so good and tasted great. The only adjustment I will make is use a 1/2 Tsp less of the chili powder (just my personal preference).

4lbs Smithfield baby back ribs.

Used suggested rub mix with the following modifications:
- Only half of the cumin as others have described
+ Added 1 TSP seasoned salt
+ Added 1 TSP black pepper
+ Added 1 TSP garlic powder
+ Added 1 TSP onion powder
+ Added 1/3 CUP light brown sugar

1) Applied rub and wrapped in foil/plastic wrap and allowed to marinate in fridge for about 3-4 hours. I massaged rub into the rack rather than just sprinkle.

2) Cooked on a cookie sheet in the oven at 300F for 2.5 hours (suggested by one user) meaty side down.

3) Finished on the grill (temp gauge at 300F for 10 minutes starting meaty side down on the unlit side with Sweet Baby Ray's on the up side. Flipped with meaty side up and Sweet Baby Ray's applied for another 10 minutes.

Ribs came out tasty and almost fall off the bone.

Next time, I will do the following cooking modification (time permitting):

3 hours at 275F in the oven. and 30 minutes on the grill at 300F with smoker box/chips to add smoke. See how slower and lower with some smoke turns out next time. Will also buy next rack from Costco to see if they do have meatier baby back ribs.

Made 5 racks (18 lbs) for 10 people last night. Followed the recipe religiously and and infused smoked hickory chips. Because of the extra 15 lbs I let the ribs cook an extra 10 minutes.  Our guests who are knowledgable and sophisticated eaters raved over the ribs. The dry rub is a great mix of spices, the tip about the membrane, the color, texture and flavor of the finished ribs all make this an outstanding recipe. 
Warning: if you want your ribs falling off the bone tender then this recipe is not for you. These ribs are moist and juicy, have a nice bite and are unbelievably flavorful.

The dry rub was just okay. I grilled on my Weber as directed, for one hour on low, then basted with my own homemade sauce.  They were dry, and overdone, making it difficult to eat them.

Fantastic recipe. Came out very tender on my gas grill. The only changes i made was that I applied the seasoning about 45 mins prior to grill time to let it seep in and used kosher salt in the seasoning as opposed to regular table salt. The other thing I tried was using Weber hickory wood chips in a metal smoker box in my gas grill. These came out absolutely fantastic. Tender, and most importantly the taste was out of this world!!!

So easy and incredibly delicious! I tried this on the 4th having not done ribs on the grill before... Good quality ribs from fancy meat counter, the four spices, and countless compliments before the real fireworks. They have a good kick to them, but not spicy hot. I'd recommend a hotter BBQ sauce for some of the ribs.

Please remember that not all grills are created equally, if I prepared this dish (and I have not) it would have been burned to a crisp, my grill is super hot.  I have grilled pork ribs many times but have to adjust my temperature accordingly.  I have still given this recipe a 5 in order to not disturb the rating base.  I will be trying the recipe this week, the reviews of the taste have been great!

Made twice, following the directions exactly.  Pretty darn good, although the first rack, a baby rib rack, was a bit dried out.  The second rack was meatier and juicier.  I haven't had luck making ribs with the exception of this recipe, but I can't say my search for the perfect rib recipe is over. But this is really good.

I baked these on 300° for 2 hours wrapped in foil as someone else suggested (I did place the ribs on a large cast iron griddle before placing them in the oven & thank goodness I did as the juices did run out from the foil) After 2 hours I took the ribs out of the foil and grilled them for the last 10-15 minutes with a bit of bbq sauce.  These were awesome! They were nearly falling of the bones.  I can't wait to make this recipe again.  I have always been intimidated by baby back ribs but not anymore.  Thanks BonnieQ!

Best Ribs I have had in a long time.  I changed it just a little and added garlic and turmeric to the rub.  I left out the paprika.  They are PRIZE WINNING.  Plus they were so easy to make.

Great easy recipe. May not make the perfect fall-off-the-bones ribs, but they're good enough for me, and the simplicity is worth it. I like to use riblets for this--they're cheaper and taste just as good (I kinda think they're better)!

We cooked these on our charcoal grill as directed. Followed recipe exactly, but wrapped ribs completely in a double layer of tinfoil while grilling. Kept it moist. Fantastic taste!

So yummy! This rub even made my poor sauce taste good. Just remember that the rub amount in the recipe is for the bulk seasoning to use multiple times. I sprinkled an equal amount (as called for) of each spice on separately and patted it down rather than rubbing in deeply. I used a rack of cheapo large ribs, so I had to cook it twice as long but that does not change the goodness of the original recipe timing for baby backs. The biggies were still moist, but could have been more tender. Next time I'm economizing with big ribs, I think I may start them in the crock pot for a few hours to help tenderize them.

They looked beautiful, but mine came out very tough.  It was probably the quality of the rib meat or my grilling technique.

Never made ribs before, this was a first time.  I actually used the boneless ribs (purchased from sam's Club) as I don't like to eat anything with bones on.  I'm sure some of you may thing I'm crazy, any way back to the ribs. I was looking for a quick and simple recipe, and this was so easy.  The taste was perfect and I will certainly be making these again.  Thank you for sharing.

I was really impressed with these since the cooking time was next to nothing (when thinking in terms of ribs). I would have given it 5 stars except for one thing - they weren't falling off the bone tender. Dont get me wrong they were really good - but I think they might need a little more time than was written. Thanks for the recipe, it's still a keeper!

I tried this Memorial Day weekend on my single rack backyard, and an additional camping grill. I had never done ribs before and was embarrassed to find that the reason I struggled getting the membrane off of the ribs was the fact that there was no membrane on the ones I bought at Costco... (oops!) I bought another rack that HAD the membrane, and had an "oh duh" moment. 

Anyway - the ribs turned out great in about an hour and 10 minutes, cooked low, and with foil covering the grill racks. 

It was risky to try ribs for the first time with a houseful of people, but I received nothing but raves from my guests. Great Recipe, and easier than it first appeared...

It doesn't get any easier than this folks!  These were awesome.  Moist and fall off the bone tender.  I made them just as directed and used Sweet Baby Rays Honey Chipotle Barbeque sauce.  Yum!  I already have another rack of ribs in the freezer so I can make them again.

One of the best dry rubs I have found. I've been cooking ribs for a long time and found most dry rubs to salty or not very flavorful. This hits the mark, I did add about 1/2 tablespoon of Lawry's garlic salt to the mixture. We added Jack Daniel's original No.7 receipe, for the wet sauce. We cooked the ribs for about 1 hour at 300 degrees, outside on the BBQ. Next we will try the rub on rotisserie chicken.

Tried them yesterdays.  So easy.  I made two slabs of pork ribs and not the baby back.  I prepared double the spices.  I couldn't help but to rub the spices in a bit.  I added salt and pepper directly to the ribs after the spices.  We used a charcoal grill and luckily we opened the lid about 30 minutes in and they were just about done.  We did flip them over for a while and then added the bbq sauce.  Superb!  How easy and delicious these were!  I will definitely make these often!

Wow...I fixed these for dinner last evening and they were wonderful.  I did a different spice blend but followed the rest of the directions.  The part about not opening the grill is the gospel.  I believe that is the reason they were so good.  Thanks Bonnie Q. for sharing this recipe and letting the rest of us shine.

Wow!  I've never made ribs before and these were fantastic.  Served them for Christmas Eve dinner to my family and everyone loved them.  I had to cook them in the oven so I wrapped them in tin foil and cooked them long and slow in the oven followed by about 10 minutes under the broiler with Sweet Baby Rays!  Fall off the bone tender and outstanding flavor!  Great recipe!

Love, love, love this recipe! I remove the membrane by slicing around it then yanking it off with a paper towel. I season/rub as directed. I bake mine for about 3 hours on 325 and throw them on the grill and baste w/sauce to finish them. I have used regular pork spareribs. Thanks for this recipe!

Yeah!!!! I finally made some really good ribs!!! I can cook, but the one time I tried to make ribs, oh, 25 years ago, they came out tough and awful. These were great!!! I followed all of the directions for removing the membrane (I used a paring knife to get each membrane started) and for the rub. I did brush some beer on the ribs before I put the rub on to help them stick, but I probably didn't have to. They were in my fridge for 24 hours before I cooked them. We use a grill that can burn charcoal or wood, so getting the flame just right was tricky, but it all worked out.  I just used bottle barbeque sauce, but next time I will either doctored some, or make some from scratch. Yummy!

Flavor was very good. It may have been the type of grill or my error that they didn't turn out as great as I expected; I want to make sure they stay moist next time so I will seal the ribs in foil before cooking next time.

Used this recipe with Hibb's sauce, and it was outstanding.  everyone was raving about the ribs.  I cut my ribs in half for serving purposes, and baked in a covered shallow pan with a bit of water for 2 hours at 325*.  Then I grilled and basted with BBQ sauce for 5 minutes.  They were literally falling off the bone!

These were so tasty and would have been even better if I could have cooked them on a charcoal grill.  Even on gas they turned out great. The hardest part with this on gas, however, is that with sugar the fire gets high and hot and can burn the ribs.  I will definitely do this on charcoal next time and I am sure that they will be even better.

I am English and my hubby is from the South so in our house he is always the one to do ribs (not a traditional thing in the UK at all).  Yesterday was 4th July and he was working so I decided to treat him with ribs as a surprise.   I followed the recipe and the advice I saw from others and it was fab!!  He was so surprised and pleased (maybe even miffed that I did so well.  LOL).  The top rack on our bbq does not work well though, and so  could not cook them that way.  Instead I put 4 medium potatoes on the grill and laid the ribs on top of them.  It kept the ribs away from direct heat until the last 20 mins or so, and then I scooped the inside out for mash!  I think the flavor of the rub was just to my taste.  Delicious.

These are really, really good ribs.  For my own taste I would go lighter on the chili poweder & a little heavier on the cumin.  The cumin was a nice touch, unexpected and made a big difference.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's as suggested in the other reviews & it was very good.

I have been using this recipes for years for my ribs. I made them yesterday for my daughter's 17th birthday. Her friends always request that I make these when they come over. I bought the ribs at BJ's (3 racks in a package), tripled the recipe adding an equal amount of garlic powder to the rub mix. The ribs always come out perfect - and they were gone in about 10 minutes! Always the sign of a great recipe!

These got rave reviews. I was unable to grill them so I baked my 3 lbs. wrapped in foil at 300 for 2 1/2 hrs. then unwrapped, poured bbq sauce on them and put them under the broiler on low for about 15 mins. Getting the membrane off the back of the ribs was very difficult. I had quite a time of it. But I guess it was worth it since they were not tough at all.

Only changes I made were to add garlic pepper and kosher salt to the rub, used hickory wood chips in the smoker of my grill, and sweet baby ray's bbq sauce.  YUM.

Great taste and yes, they fall off the bone.  I like to add more sauce and finish on the grill.  The sauce turns dark red and carmelizes nicely on the ribs

I used smoked paprika with the rub, and I'd say the ribs were a life changing experience. These were absolute perfection.

These are really great.  Everybody raved.  Did a few things different.  Cooked indirect on med/low for about 2 hours or so. After 1 3/4hrs I started to put the bbq sauce to them(used Big Al's KC bbq sauce,  this site 5 stars).  Did that for 1/2- 3/4 hr.  Then took them off and let them rest 5-10 minutes.  Delicious.  Like I said before everybody raved.  Thanks lots,  will make them again and again and again, you get my drift.

WONDERFUL! Just came across this recipe 3 weeks ago.  Made it for my picky husband and he LOVED them.  I hate recipes that put ribs in the oven or boils them before you bbq them--this recipe is a "true" rib recipe. We like a very "seasoned" taste, so I rubbed in the seasonings and used indirect heat on our gas grill for 1.5 hours.  Perfecto!  I have made these ribs 4 times in 3 weeks.  Worth a try!  The seasonings didn't seem like it would make it taste this good, but it does!  Also, I removed the membrane which I think makes the ribs more tender.  Thanks for sharing.

Thanks to some very helpful reviews, this was just as easy to pull off using a gas grill with a smoker box. After the ribs marinated overnight and the soaked chips were in place, I set the flames to high to heat through then turned one side off and laid the ribs on that side. I set the flames on low for the opposite side of the grill and let the ribs slowly   smoke for about an hour and a half before  basting with a good store bought bbq sauce (Kraft Honey flavored). I was very thrilled to create tender, juicy ribs much like Chili's restaurant serves. These were perfect with grilled corn and potato salad. I'm on a roll with summer grilling!

This was a good recipe!  I added thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar to the dry rub.  Also, I placed a foil pan of boiling water directly beneath the upper rack where I grilled the ribs and left them for about 2 hours on low with only one side of the grill on.  Perfect!

My husband and I loved this recipe - great flavor and great directions on grilling the ribs. We had been grilling them without the aluminum foil therefore they always burned. I did take a reviewer's advice and cut down the cumin by half. Easy prep and tasted great!

Awesome recipe.  They looked like restaurant ribs when taken off the grill.  The 300 degrees method for an hour really does work perfectly.  I had a hard time removing the membrane with a butter knife and I also tried with a sharp knife.  It never came off in one piece for me at all.  I had smaller pieces of membrane even after using the paper towel method.  Maybe that was because my ribs were frozen prior to thawing out from Market Day?  It was so hard to not peek during the cooking process, but so worth the wait and well worth being patient.  YUM!

Perfect! The ribs were perfect! I followed the recipe exactly - used the butter knife method during preparation to remove membrane - very easy and took seconds. The bbq sauce I used was bottled Sweet Baby Ray's original. This recipe was not only so simple it produced the best ribs ever! I had 2 racks and I was over the 3 lb called for in the recipe.  I will cook this again and again and again! Thank you very much for sharing!

I  changed this recipe quite a bit - so maybe I'm unfairly rating.  I used a purchased rib rub and country style pork ribs - the ribs tasted good but were dry so for sure next  time I'll use baby back.  The best thing about this was the tip on the cooking method.  Low with no peeking and the tin foil for dripping.  I will use this method again but with the correct cut of meat.  I still think store bought rib rib is the easiest though.

Such an awesome recipe!  I tried it first with baby back pork ribs and used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Honey Sauce.  Amazing!  I also tried it with beef ribs, but I didn't think it was as good.

These were excellent!  Very tender.  I cooked them on low heat for about 2 hours and I did turn them over each 1/2 hour.  I put bbq sauce on the them the last 1/2 hour of cooking.

Totally awesome.  My husband wasn't much into ribs until I did these.  Now this is the only way we do ribs.  Defintely use the top rack of the grill.  I completely wrap my ribs in foild and then start brushing after about an hour.  I usually cook on a low heat for 1 1/2 hours and they are very  tender.  I always have a bottle of this ready for use.

TO DIE FOR. My father (who never likes anything) absolutely loved these. The whole family ate them all up. I thought I had made enough for leftovers but all the ribs were gone! Wonderful, wonderful, recipe. Highly recommended by my family!

I thought the rub was quite tasty and I ended up using my homemade BBQ sauce made of ketchup, sugar free maple syrup, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, beef granules, garlic, cayenne red pepper, salt, & pepper.  It was perfectly cooked on the grill.  Next time I plan on making Scott Hibb's Amazing Whisky Grilled Baby Back Ribs because I'd like them to be a little tenderer.

Delicious - the centerpiece of our 4th of July bbq! The spice mixture was wonderful - we didn't use any salt. Brushed the racks with chipotle grilling sauce at the end which added even more flavor and zip. We'll use this recipe over and over.

I cooked these ribs for dinner tonight and we thought they were just ok.  Instead of using back ribs, we used side ribs.  I had no trouble removing the membrane using the butter knife and paper towel method.  I did reduce the amount of cumin in the rub, but next time I make these ribs, I will put the full amount in.  The only other change I made was to cook them longer (about an hour and 45 minutes in total).  I was slightly disappointed with these ribs as they weren't as tender as I was hoping they'd be...but I will try again using baby back ribs.

Wonderful recipe and so easy to make. My family loves these ribs and asks me to make them regularly. I make extra spice mix to  have it on hand. I too wondered which rack to cook the ribs on, so I put put the foil on the grill and the ribs on the top warming rack. I find that I have to cook the ribs a longer than what the recipe states to get them tender, but we have a big family I probably make more than 3 lbs of ribs at a time. I experimented by cooking two racks of ribs at the same time, one with the membrane sheath removed and the other without, and removing it definitely made a big difference.

Excellent technique for "quick" ribs.  We loved it!!  I just used a prepackaged dry rub and Stubb's Original bbq sauce.  

instead of the foil, we put a aluminum 9x13 underneath the grate to catch the drippings.  There was not more than 3 TBSP of drippings, but the horror stories on these reviews scared us into using it!!  

Thanks for the technique - we will use it forever!!

Easiest way to make ribs I've come across.  These were as good as if not better than a BBQ place we love to go to (an hour away).  I used regular pork ribs and Dinosaur BBQ Sauce (best sauce ever).  They were excellent.  I am making these again tonight!  I also bought 4 more racks of ribs that were on sale so we have them for the summer.  Yummy!

These  were ok.. I think the spices didn't come through very wll, but then again, I didn't put them on very thickly. The ribs were also a little dry, so I might cut the grilling time down. Also, cutting the membran was really difficult.. not sure how to do this exactly, even after reading the other reviews... will probably make again with a few mods. :)

The rub was excellent and I finished them off with Jack Daniels Grilling Sauce.  The method was one that I would use again.  I know that a lot depends on your barbecue, but next time I would let them go just a little longer, for a more tender rib.  I didn't receive any complaints, though.  My husband is already planning to pick up some ribs for next weekend.

I have never made ribs before and purchased a rack at the store the other day on a whim.  This evening I decided to make them and did a quick search for a recipe/marinade.  This one caught my eye because it sounded easy and I had all the ingredients.  They turned out fabulous.  Even my husband, who takes meat very seriously, raved about how tender and flavorful they were.  This one is a keeper!

These are the best ribs I've ever BBQ'd - absolutely scrumptious! The only thing I do differently is shorten the cook time - I find 50 mins. is perfect, but every BBQ is different. Thanks so much Bonnie!

My husband and I have tried many ways to fix the baby back ribs, but never found a recipe that was just right.  We have now!  This was so easy and really good... We added some mosquite chips to the grill and it really flavored the ribs.  No need to look for another rib recipe!

This was ok. Nothing spectacular....The seasonings put a good twist to regular bbq sauce. I did have to bake them instead of grill them.

Should have allowed more cook time.  It is winter here and the BBQ  was on low and slow - but too slow.  Should have left them on for 3 hours.  Would add a little liquid in the foil wrap to accelerate the braising.  All said - tasty!

Probably a great recipe, however I never could effectively trim the membrane sheath from the back of each rack, so kinda gave up and tossed them in the oven.

Great recipe.   Easy to make with simple ingredients. Healthier than most recipes as it the rub does not contain sugar.  I also used  a  sugar-free BBQ sauce.  My whole family loves these ribs.

I changed rub ingredients to have salt, pepper, GrillMates BBQ sauce, and later BBQ Sauce. I started the grill with all 3 burners on high, and it got up to 550 F in about 10 minutes. The babyback ribs were put on the upper shelf, the area below was lined with silver foil to catch drippings. I lowered the lid and turned the heat down to Low.One hour later I opened the lid, added BBQ sauce on top, lowered the lid for 5 minutes. The inner temp was 189 so I put the ribs on the table and sliced them up. Very tasty! I'm not sure but I think they could have been a bit more tender (next time I'll let the temp get above 195). I highly recommend following cooking info exactly!

Followed directions exactly. Had never removed the membrane before this;  was a bit pesky, but not difficult. Made the rub a couple of hours early to let flavors come together and rubbed the meat about an hour before grilling.  Used a simple homemade BBQ sauce I’d used previously for pulled pork. These were delicious.

Added a mix of cayenne and black pepper. Difficult to judge “low” on the grill so I ended up cooking it for 1:20 until meat thermometer showed 170. Super easy recipe, the dry rub gave it nice heat and flavor - ribs stayed moist and perfectly done. Great recipe!

I used this for ribs and it turned out great! I did use smoked paprika. I had a lot of the rub left, so I ended up keeping it and was grilling some salmon and added 2 tbsp. of brown sugar and a teaspoon of TruLime seasoning, grilled my filets on a cedar plank and it was some of the best Salmon ever!

OMG! It's true! It's worked just like it said. I was so worried I did not actually turn the grill all the way down to low. The ribs were a little over done but that was MY BAD. I have learned my lesson and I am making them today and I promise not to look. : )
Telling my son about them, totally doable for the working man and girl.

Absolutely fantastic! You can play with the spice mix, but if you follow the cooking directions, you’ll have ribs with meat falling off the bones.

Just ok. The ribs were cooked through and moist with good flavor (can't go wrong with Sweet Baby Rays), but chewy and tough. I followed the instructions exactly. The spices were too spicy for my picky kids.

Simple and delicious. I added a little heat with cayenne but otherwise, this was perfect for my Weber on low for 60mins. Do use the foil to keep the flames away and DON'T OPEN the barb b cue.

I did better on this than I expected. The rub is fantastic, but I adjusted it to our taste. I doubled the brown sugar, did not use cumin, and just a dash of cayenne. I was a little worried that I didn’t get my grill hot enough,  so for the last 20 minutes I turned the flame up. It didn’t over cook, and got just the right char on the top after brushing on the bbq sauce. I used pork ribs, but I’d like to try beef next time.

Truly prize winning! I had never been successful at ribs. I have a basic gas grill, and this technique worked beautifully. They  turned out perfect - soft as butter on the inside but crispy/charred(ish) on the outside. Great proportions on spice, too. Since my gas grill doesn't go low enough I turned on one side and put the ribs on the other side (no flame) and just turned them so that both sides were closer to the burner at some point. Thanks for a great recipe!

I cook it about a half hour more and add garlic powder.Time wise it might be because of our altitude. 6000 ft. tends to make everything take longer

I didn't have cumin, so substituted a blend of spices that were mostly what is listed in addition to the ones listed in the recipe. Also insteadof Kraft,  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Other than that followed the recipe and it was delicious, simple, no fuss, no muss! This will be the recipe I use from now on,  thank you!

All I can say is wow!! This was my first time making ribs, and I will only follow this recipe bc it works. At first I was a little skeptical about this dry rub but it was everything I was hoping for. My brother in law is a very picky eater and he was definitely loving the ribs. In fact everyone who had eaten them loved them. In addition to the listed seasonings I added Garlic salt, and of course Goya Adobo(being Puerto Rican this is a must). I made 3 racks so I added 3x the amount of ingredients. I did have difficulty removing the membrane off two of the racks so I left it on. Once seasoned I wrapped all the racks in foil and let sit over night. With foil on I cooked them on my gas grill low setting for 2 hours. After 2 hours took them out of the foil and brushed with some delicious bbq sauce. Left on the grill for about 10 minutes. Brushed more bbq sauce and remove. This was a definite home run.

Not a good cook.  Just followed the recipe and truly the best ribs I ever tasted.  Had so many disasters with ribs that my kids  always laughed and said try again.  This time perfection.  After cooking I kept them warm wrapped in foil and on low in the crock pot.

My first time ever doing Baby Back Ribs on the charcoal grill and dare I say it was amazing!!!!!  I did follow some other reviews & added 1 tsp each of onion powder & garlic powder, the rub was a must & then I chilled them in the fridge for a good 4 hours then  1-1/2 hrs on the grill, I did put alum foil on the grate though & put my ribs on there vs oiling the grill.  Once I put the BBQ sauce on I took the foil off to crisp them up a bit.  My husband raved about these & I honestly can't wait to make them again!!!

I followed the recipe exactly except made two racks of ribs and left bbq lid down for almost two hours without opening.. Basted ribs and then left lid closed for additional 15 mins. We loved the ribs!  Thank you for this recipe.

Was a little hesitant about the cooking time as I started the recipe.  Well as I checked on the ribs (1) time while they were on the grill I knew it was going to be an awesome meal.

Great Recipe !! John

This rub is okay. I have had a lot better. The method fails this is a temperature control with those cooking times. I used the snake briquette method and maintain heat around 225-250. Wind was a slight problem. I used back ribs so the rule of thumb is 2-2-1. 2 hours on the grill. Remove butter and foil wrap for 2 then remove foil and cook another hour.  You have to control the temp.

I give this 4 stars only because after cooking on low for 1 hr my ribs were a little over cooked and came out dry. I will make again but will cut cook time to 45-50 minutes. The rub was easy and tasty. I cooked a 3.25 lb rack which used about half the rub.

I have been  removing the membrane for years. I’ll never cook ribs again without doing so. 
Once you get an edge of the membrane lifted from the ribs, grab it with a paper towel and pull the length of the ribs. Membrane comes off very easily.  If the ribs are scored down the middle, you may have to do this to both sides.

The rub was good, although the second time I made it I added granulated garlic and it was better.    I usually buy the extra meaty baby back ribs and one hour is simply not enough for them.    They were pretty tough with such a short cooking time.   The second time I cooked them about 3 hours and they were much better.   Again, I buy the extra meaty baby backs, not the regular ones so that may make a difference.

Very good. But certainly, adjust the chili to your taste. I halve the amount of chili powder (might even try a little less the next time), put it in the oven at 300 for 2 1/2 hours  and finish off the last 15 minutes with Scott Hibb's Amazing Whisky Grilled Baby Back Ribs sauce, also on this site. Chipotle chili powder is nice, if you have it.

This is our favorite recipe for ribs!  Even my daughter who doesn’t visit like any pork meat is eating these ribs and I tried quite a few recipes. Most of the times, I just bake them in oven and put them on grill for the last 5 min. Delicious!

My ribs were pretty thick, although they were 3 lbs. next time I’ll leave them on the grill for both grill steps for a little longer to get that fall off the bone experience. Flavor was good. A little spice.

Made dried out ribs. I’ll give a few stars because I’ve never done ribs and maybe I screwed up. I am however a great cook so not sure what happened. There is no moisture involved at any step so how on earth could these be juicy? Back to the drawing board.

I made this as written last night using our gas grill. The rub was ok, though for me, the cumin seemed a bit overwhelming. The grilling time was way off for me, the ribs were not cooked through.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I've been using an old rib recipe that I've had for more than a decade and it's always been a hit. I produces ribs with a sweet/tangy flavor (maple syrup base) but you have to boil the ribs and then marinate for a few hours. I've always wanted to try a rib rub and decided to do so when I found myself with a relatively short-notice BBQ get together.

I made this recipe and it was HELLA GOOD! 
Ribs so tasty didn't even need BBQ Sauce!
I used spare ribs cause that's what I had. 
Cooked on a charcoal grill. 

Just FYI from my experience: I have a Weber ~20" grill and a slab of spareribs takes half the grill surface. So the idea of never opening the top -- in that situation -- is NOT GONNA WORK!
You need to rotate the slab 180° so that it will cook evenly... as I discovered.
Also, make sure that the airflow ports on the top are over the charcoals or you're not gonna generate enough fire/heat (close down those ports as needed to regulate the temp).

After 30 mins I realized that there wasn't enough heat  being generated --wrong placement of the air ports... meant that I was basically steaming the ribs. Placing those ports over the charcoal got the heat going good.. so good that I had to narrow the ports by about 1/2.

Of course, the meat nearest the charcoal was getting more heat than the outer edge, so I rotated the slab about half way thru the cook time.

In all... including the 30 mins "steam" I'd say I cooked them for about 1hr 45mins.. maybe a bit longer. And they looked at ta

I used 1/2 teaspoon of chipotle chile and had just the right heat for my family's taste.  The cumin and paprika were just right and I received rave reviews; it's a keeper.

Will not make these again. Your ingredients were close, your cooking methods didn't work. Low and slow exactly how you said and decided to go away from my own method. Appreciate the effort.

Do not cook ribs on a propane grill...  Cook with Charcoal and Wood chips for at least 6  hours at 225.  Have a water pan for moisture and periodically spray the ribs with water or apple juice to keep moisture.    Wrap the ribs in foil and continue slow cooking to your desire.

Great recipe!  I had always PREcooked my slabs in the oven, but this recipe allowed for a more meaty style rib with less of that fatty fall apart texture.  Followed recipe.      Are they done in 1 hour???  Yes, if cooked on Weber kettle grill with hickory briquettes added to charcoal it is definitely ready in 1 hour.  I didn't peek at all.  After establishing a roaring coal bed, push coals to one half of the grill.  Add the briquettes, close lower vent (underside of grill) to just a sliver open.  Place rib rack on the indirect heat side (no coals underneath).  Cover with grill lid.  Adjust top vents on the lid for amount of smoke you desire, as this is the exhaust vent.  Open it a sliver for smoked pork, or open it fully to minimize the smoker flavor.

Followed recipe EXACTLY!  Even had to fight off my husband from trying to open the grill & take a peek before the 1 hour was up.  Lol. I found & used this recipe last night.  I don't like rating it so low but wanted to leave honest feedback & perhaps save another rack of expensive ribs from getting tossed in the trash.  I was excited to try this as it sounded great and lookd so easy.  I watched the video twice & rechecked the ingredients before mixing the rub.  First, let me say that the rub may be tasty for some, so I'm not giving it a completely bad review.  It was just a bit too strong for our taste and that's saying a lot considering the fact that the ribs were nearly burnt to a crisp.  I tried to salvage some of the top meat (the side facing away from the grill) but it still had a pretty harsh & bitter taste from being burnt. The rub HAD to be pretty dang strong to taste thru that!  I would just suggest that you NOT sprinkle nearly as much as they show in the video!  The other suggestion for anyone wanting to try this recipe is PLEASE do not follow the part of the instructions that tell you to close the grill and not open again for one hour!  BIG MISTAKE!  We were incredibly disappointed to open ours after exactly one hour, only to find them burnt badly.  I should've allowed my husband to peek after 40-45 minutes like he wanted to. Instead, I had to salvage as much meat off of the top of the ribs as possible in order to have something for our supper.  I'm guessing that w

Couldn't believe how simple it was. Turned out pretty good, though I didn't have enough room on the top rack so the ribs that sat on the bottom were a little more crispy than I would have liked. XD

This was my first time making these and they came out great! Although next time I'll use less cummin. Also cooking them in the grill need a to be tweaked. First you need to not place them directly over heat, you need indirect heat. Second put a pan of water next to the meat above the coals and third don't cook them on the grill with the bbq sauce put them in the oven for another 45 minutes at 275 and let it cook that way it taste less burnt.

These were amazing! I ended up wrapping my seasoned ribs in cling wrap for about an hour stuck in the fridge because I didn't realize it was too early to start cooking for dinner. I think that gave the flavors a chance to meld nicely. Also halved the seasoning blend because I knew I wouldn't use it all and still only used about half of that on the 3 pounds of ribs. Cooked for almost 90 minutes over low heat and these were fall off the bone tender. Sooo good. Everyone raved about these. Follow the recipe, you won't be disappointed. No need to heat up the house with the oven to have delicious ribs.

Update: 1tsp each of cumin, paprika and chili powder and 1/2tsp salt and pepper was the perfect amount for 3 pounds of ribs.

Great recipe. It was so easy to make killer ribs for the 4th of July! The great thing about this rub is that it has no sugar, which meant that my wife, who is on Whole30, could eat this, too. I just kept the BBQ sauce glass off of her portion. I will be making these again sooner than later.

Absolutely delicious! But I had to cook it about an hour and a half in the foil. Then take it out and cook it another 20-30 on the grill. I used sweet and spicy BBQ sauce once it was out of the foil and on the grill. Total time about 2 hours. It wasn't worth it though.

I took the membrane off with butter knife as suggested (worked well).  Cut the cumin down, added garlic as suggested.  One hour was not enough time to get fall off the bone ribs.  They were done, and tasted OK but not great.  May try again and cook them longer. Used a 6 burner gas grill.  To keep temp down to 300-400 used only 4 burners on low.  Also had hickory chips in the smoker box.

These were delicious. I loved the seasoning pairing on it with our sauce of choice. My only issue was they took (for us) a lot longer than 1 hour. They were delicious once they were done. We just had to wait a bit longer than expected to eat! :)

I just made this recipe and it had turned out awesome!  I had started out with a marinated rack of pork ribs and just followed the instructions to not open for an hour, with the grill temp set on low.  The ribs came out superb.  Definitely will be using this recipe from now on!

Needed longer than 1 hour to cook...about 45 mins longer.  Also, I didn't have cumin so used a little barbecue rub along with the other spices.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Only difference is I may have let sit on the grill an extra half hour or so.  These were incredible,  as easy as it gets.  This will be one that we will have many times, and will not change a thing.

the simplicity of this recipe made me leery but this is amazing. We went by the recipe completely down to the cooking time and the ribs were fantastic the flavor and tenderness was great. We had these ribs at least every two weeks and got 2 to 3 racks because my husband will eat them for lunch  the next day. No changes on this recipe, basic and simple are always best.

This was fantastic.  We made it in a homemade smoker/cooker over an open fire.  The rub was great.  We followed the recipe as closely as possible with the cooker we were using.  We used McKenna's BBQ sauce and spread the left over rub on bacon, chicken, and sliced onion and munched on those while waiting on the ribs.

I loved the rub. This is a simple but effective, and the is no sugar used in it.  I followed my low and slow method cooking the ribs. I can't help it.

We had St. Louis style spare ribs, and after some research, found out that Baby Backs are cut from the loin and are more tender while spareribs are cut from the under side  and though meaty, are tougher. SO we added an addl hour to the cooking time. Followed the recipe exactly while adding the extra hour - delicious!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic.  It is by far one of the easiest recipes and best tasting ribs I have had in a long time.  The fact that the entire process takes 90 minutes is a sin.  I will definitely use this recipe over and over again and apply it to different barbecues!

Loved this recipe.  Sprinkled the ribs with the seasoning and place on a rack covered in the oven for 2 hours at 375 degrees.  Put these on the grill,  some with  a honey chipotle barbeque and some with a hot & spicy barbeque.  There were no leftovers and got rave reviews.  Served with steamed broccoli and a salad.  It was perfect.

We didn't care for them.  All the fat didn't render out like cooking slow. The rub was ok, just tasted like fat pork. I won't make this way again.

Really good ribs recipe, I made twice as much of the rub as I needed to make sure I had extra. I cooked the ribs for Fathers day using this recipe and wow, everyone loved them. I will definitely be making them again soon. I followed the recipe exactly as directed and the ribs were moist, flavorful and completely cooked. Thanks for a great recipe.

First of all, there's no way the ribs are going to be done in one hour without baking them first! I even baked the ribs for 2.5 hours @ 250 degrees (covered) and then put them on the grill for about 15 min. They were still not fall-off-the-bone tender! There looks like a good recipe on the manfuel blog that I will try next.

The only thing I would do differently would be to back off on the cumin.  Maybe try 1/2 tbsp next time.  I will definitely make these again.  Been smoking and grilling my entire life and always willing to try something different.  These ribs were great and like the recipe says,  easy.

Was a little dry when I followed the recipe, the leftover ribs the next day were excellent. I usually bake ribs first, they are always juicy that way. Next time I will use that spice mix, bake them, then BBQ when almost done.

We are still talking about these ribs the next day! No changes in the recipe other than reduce the cumin just a bit (not a big fan and was skeptical). Wow!!!! Put ribs on my grocery list already.

This recipe was excellent.  thank you Jeremy for the tip about how to pull off the membrane with a paper towel - worked like a charm.  I doubled the recipe with 2 racks each 3 1/2 for a total of 7 lbs. lb of st louis style ribs and i couldn't believe how easy it was.  i split the spice mix between the two racks and the amount was perfect.   I put them on the grill at very low heat for 1 1/2 hours and then another 10 minutes with sauce.  cut them into individual ribs and they were gone!  Everyone raved.  i will be making them again.

I admit I didn't believe you could make ribs on the grill in an hour, but was I wrong! These came out perfectly done--not falling off the bone, which is not how ribs should be, but with a good bite and a bit of chew. I would definitely use this method again, but would probably change up the rub, which was fine, but a little too southwest for us.

I followed Nicole F's lead. I rubbed the ribs then put them in a 175 degree oven for about 4 hours. Then I bumped the temp up to 200 for the last 2-3 hours. I finished them on the grill with the BBQ sauce and they were the best ribs ever! Tender, not greasy with slight char. 

The oven makes for a no fuss approach. Served with fresh corn on the cob and homemade coleslaw.

Good rub and recipe. But they need to be cooked longer on the grill. Low and slow. I recommend doing 250 on indirect heat on the grill for 4-5 hours. The sauce them and let cook for 7 mins each side. But overall a great recipe.

Skipped the salt because I added some garlic salt, otherwise just as published.  Best ribs I ever made!  The aroma was killing the whole neighborhood.  HA!  I recommend allowing a bit more time on the grill, maybe it was because my ribs were especially meaty this time.  Great rub!

Simply delicious. Probably would be good slow cooked for longer without the initial heating up of the grill on hi. The longer and slower ribs are prepared, the more tender they become.

This recipe makes me so happy!  The ribs were cooked but not gooey & did not fall off the bone, thank the stars!  I used the rub (adding a little garlic & thyme) without saucin' it... & we smoked it with some mesquite which was nice!

This is my "go-to" rib recipe - nearly foolproof.  I've done it with the gas grill using one burner and with charcoal.  Delicious - no changes.  I also love the rub and use it on everything BBQ related - wings, Boston butt, you name it...thanks for a great recipe.

This looked like it was burnt and dry ... but it was so good. I did cut down on the amount of chili powder because we don't like a lot of spice. 

I will be making these again FOR SURE!!

Watch the cooking time. I tried out this recipe for company. (Yeah I know, sorta daring.) All went well except for the fact that gas grills vary in the temperatures they produce at any given setting. At the end of an hour the ribs were SLIGHTLY overdone. Not bad, but more cooked than I would have hoped. So, this isn't really a comment on a good recipe; it's a warning to all who try this recipe to  KNOW YOUR GRILL! Check the degree doneness with an instant-read meat thermometer at around 45 minutes and act accordingly. Had I done that things would have turned out a little better. BTW I used a more robust rub and let it "cure" overnight in the fridge. Other than that, no tinkering.

So many things I like about this recipe and reviewer comments: the tip for how to remove the membrane, the idea of starting them in a slow oven and finishing them on the grill and the spice mixture itself! I started my ribs in a 300 degree oven by placing the seasoned ribs on a rack and covering the aluminum foil lined pan with foil. I left them in the oven for 3 hours until they were "fall off the bone" tender. I made my own BBQ sauce using Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce (also on this site) and applied it to the ribs once I took them out of the oven and put them on the grill to finish. They were a huge hit! I will definitely be making these again soon!

Amazing recipe, the first time I used it I didn't have paprika or cumin, I had chili powder, but I also had a Cajun mixed spice that pretty much had all that and salt and pepper and garlic powder. I added thyme and cinnamon, I decided to try using some old cast iron pans filled with water to catch the drippings, dunno if it added anything to it, but the rips were super juicy, though it took a bit longer to cook. Just about the same today, but using the foil to catch instead, looking forward to them.

This is the best way to cook ribs that I've found.  I didn't have baby back ribs so I did the spare ribs that I had.  I cooked them for about 1 3/4 hours before putting the sauce on and they were perfect.  The rub gave the ribs a great flavor.  I'll be using this recipe from now on.

Superb recipe and method of grilling.  It provides the perfect tenderness and maximum "rib flavor" without the usual overcooking of the ribs till the bones fall out.  Suggestion:  I don't find it necessary to remove the lower membrane as it serves to protect the slab from overcooking when I push a few coals directly under the slab before closing the lid.  A little bit of "direct" heat adds to the overall flavor.  Also, I find that after one hour,  cutting the slab into individual ribs and tossing them in the sauce in a wide metal pan (with a bit of extra rub sprinkled on top, and then heating the open pan for 5-10 minutes on the grill (covered) really brings the spices, sauce and ribs together...and makes them so easy to serve...  mmmmmmm

Like everything, the results of this recipe rely on the goods you begin with. Luckily, I had homegrown pork baby back ribs and Corky's Dry Rub. This recipe brought a wonderful dinner to our table, thanks!

I used this receip yesterday and I loved it... The only thing I did wrong was to bake the 10 minutes longer than I should have...they were the best ribs I have ever cooked...

We'd always been under the impression that making ribs was complicated, so we'd always strayed away. Not anymore! Super easy, super tasty! We're calling this one a keeper!

For a first time griller, I was very worried that I would mess up a good slab of ribs. But this is a nice easy recipe for me to follow and the ribs turned out phenomenal. I cooked it almost exactly like the recipe called for ( I kept checking on ribs, just couldn't leave them alone) but they came out great. I used 'Scott Hibb's Amazing Whisky Grilled Baby Back Ribs' sauce recipe and they go great together.

I tried this recipe last night and the ribs turned out perfect. My husband, who is not a rib person, loved them. He could not get enough. Also, I use the butter knife paper towel method to remove the membrane-worked like a charm. I will now cook my ribs like this all the time.

I use this dry rub for ribs and chicken! It's the greatest! I keep it in the cabinet with my spices. I use less cumin and add garlic powder. Easy!

I made this recipe for a group of 8 friends and let me tell you.. they loved them!! I followed the steps to detail, but due to the quantity (i cooked 9lbs.) had to increase the time in the oven to 3 hours well sealed in aluminum foil.  After that bathed them in Barbecue sauce twice 15 min each, and the meat was tenderly falling off the bone!  A trully great recipe I will do again!!

This was easy and turned out great.  Had to cook a little longer, but I think that was because they were in the fridge all day and were very cold to start with.  I did use a little less ceyenne pepper since I can't do HOT, but it still had a little bite and the guys really liked it.  Will absolutly do this again.

These were great!  I made one rack of ribs two ways: half with the dry rub and the other half with the BBQ sauce and a few sprays of apple cider & Coke from a spray bottle.  We liked both equally!  We used our rotisserie attachment to grill these and they came out really great.  The rub definitely complemented the ribs without overpowering them.  Can't wait to make these again.

Awesome!  This recipe is easy and delicious.  Our ribs turned out fantastically.  Thanks to the other reviewers for the tip on using a butter knife to remove the membrane - it worked perfectly the first time.  

We will "WOW" dinner guests with these ribs all summer!

These were really good, but I used as much of the spices as the recipe stated, and the ribs tasted way too tex-mex for me.  Next time will use half as much cumin and chili powder and add celery salt and maybe some garlic.

This is a very good rub.  I rubbed the ribs, wrapped it in bacon and refrigerated it over night for a BBQ the next day, big hit.

These ribs are great. I add the rub in the morning or night before, then wrap in plastic or foil. Proceed as usual for cooking. They are easy and tasty! DON'T open the lid... Fool proof and tasty.

This was a great rub- we doubled the recipe  and it was plenty for a big pack of ribs from Costco. We didnt follow the instructions for cooking the ribs because we wanted to smoke them while they were cooking- we did 3 hours at 250 on the BBQ with loads and loads of hickory chunks added when needed. VERY GOOD RIBS!!!

I used Sweet Baby rays BBQ Hot and Spicy. I love this BBQ without anything added so didn't think adding this was going be worth the trouble but I wish I had been adding the spices all along. Thank you for this recipe. It is very much worth the extra spices in the BBQ.

They came out perfect. I did wonder about the membrane removal,(novice cook) but I figured it out and they came out perfect. Also I place in the over for about 30 mins art 200 degrees then placed on the grill.

I consider myself a pretty good cook and I'm experienced on the grill...but, baby back ribs always came out over done, dry or burned. With the cost of baby backs over spare ribs, I'd almost given up cooking them and just ordered when I went for BBQ at a restaurant. Then, I saw this recipe and decided to give it one more go. 

This is an unbelievably easy recipe and it turned out PERFECTLY! The ribs were moist and tender. The seasoning was great. Everything about this recipe, including the directions on removing the membrane, is done so right! Thanks much for posting this recipe!!!

For having such good reviews , I really wasn't all that impressed.  The flavor was good, but not as tender as I thought they would be.  I have a recipe for ribs in the oven that I think I will stick to.

we prefer dry rubs to barbeque sauces.  so, i only used the dry rub in this recipe and barbequed the meat in an open beach-grill.  it was a bit dry but amazingly delicious.   we didn't have left-overs, which was very surprising.  (will definitely use again, maybe this time with olive oil)

Even though I had a terrible slab of ribs (spare ribs) I followed the recipe anyway.  Good hint about removing the membrane.  I cooked the ribs for 1 1/2 hours and I did it side by side method where you turn the heat on one side of the grill but put your meat on the other.  One advantage to having poor meat is that I decided to not lift the lid at all and if they burnt, we would have soup.  They came out exceptionally tender and good.  Also I followed the spice exactly and found it to be delicious, not too much cumin for us.

These were great!  I followed the recipe exactly and used Baby Ray's Sauce.  I always thought grilling was a "man's job" but after these ribs were so easy and came out so well I am eager to use my grill more often!  I will definately make these for my next family function!


UPDATE:  After the first time I used this recipe I had quite a bit of the rub left.  I have used this rub several times since on various other types of meat.  I haven't found anything it isn't fantastic on.  Try it on pork chops, you won't be disappointed!

I think how your ribs turn out largely depends on the quality of the meat that you buy.  These were tasty but a little hard and overcooked around the edges.  I think I'll try my slow cooker next time.

Great.   I like mine a bit softer, so, I up the cooking time to 2 - 3 hours.  The dry spice rub is great.  I use the butter knife/paper towel method to get the membrane off in a snap.  Thanks for the recipe and tips.

This recipe is wonderful. This was our first time making ribs and some of our friends said they were the very best they'd ever had. We used the tip to remove the membrane from the ribs, it worked perfectly. We also cut down on the cumin to double to recipe. We cannot wait to make these ribs again because they were so incredibly delicious.
Highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

This was my first time cooking ribs, and they were a HUGE success.  I just followed the recipe and like others, used 'Scott Hibb's Amazing Whisky Grilled Baby Back Ribs recipe' for the sauce.

I followed the directions exactly and probably left them longer than 1 hour w/out lifting the lid.  My ribs were not quite done.  I also didn't care for the rub - maybe I used too much?

This recipe is the first I've ever made for ribs and now the only one. My husband loves this recipe and requests ribs now all the time. (Note: I usually cut the rub recipe in half, though when I'm making one slab of ribs for two people.)

My first time making baby back ribs and I thought they were were good. However, my husband thought they were a bit tough. He likes them to fall off the bone and these didn't. Good taste though.

Great recipe! Made these for the 4th of July crowd and they loved them! This was my first time making ribs and I was nervous because so many people said to boil them first, but these were easy, and very tender.  KC Masterpiece original was the sauce I used. Yum.

We made this for our Fourth of July cook-out. Absolutely FANTASTIC. Used 3 pieces (each of which weighed about 10 oz.) of boneless country pork ribs ($1.39/lb. on sale!). After 50 minutes we did open the lid of the grill and rearrange the pieces (same side up) to ensure even cooking. Then turned the heat up a few minutes to get it up to temperature, and then back down to low for the last 10 minutes before adding the BBQ sauce. Excellent with wilted spinach.

My husband is an avid b-b-q-er and I love to cook. I told him about this recipe that I wanted to try. He was very skeptical in the beginning until he actually tried them. Since it was just the two of us, I made a 2lb slab. These were some of the best ribs we've ever had! I will definitely be using this recipe again.

These turned out perfect.  When I went to the spice cabinet, I realized I was out of regular Chili Powder so I substitued with ANCHO CHILE PEPPER.  It added an incredible flavor.  I would highly recommend using the Acho Chile Pepper in place of the regular Chili Powder.  Also, I did add a packet of mesquite wood chips to the grill.  Followed cooking directions and turned out great.

I was very skeptical about only cooking these for an hour on low heat, but I followed the recipe to the letter (with the exception of adding equal parts garlic salt to the rub)and they turned out perfect!  If you have read any of my reviews before you know how picky my boys are!  It was a great end of Father's day for my husband.  As far as the recommend of the foil, it is a MUST.   What I wasn't clear on because I only have a cooking rack and a warming rack on the top of my grill-was where to put the foil.  I just set it directly on top of the gas source vents, they are the "V" shapes in most gas grills-and when I opened it, it was covered with the drippings, I can see how others caught fire!  Thanks so much for this Bonnie, I will never make ribs any other way!

These really are prize winning ribs and deserve every one of the five stars that they are rated.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I had never trimmed the membrane off the underside of the ribs before but I followed the recipe and found that it was not difficult at all.  I had read that another reviewer's grill caught fire!  I had no such problem...I lined the entire lower rack of the grill with foil and it caught the dripping off the ribs.  What I really loved about this recipe was the ease of it all.  While these were cooking for an hour on low, I was in my swimming pool with my son because we are having a heat wave in NJ. This is such a great recipe for a busy Mom. For the last five minutes I turned the grill to med/high, removed the foil and grilled this with barbeque sauce so they would have nice grill marks.  I will be making these many, many more times this summer.  Thank you so much for this great recipe!!

I made these ribs yesterday, along with Beer Butt Chicken from this site,  for a BBQ that I had for about 25 people.  Rave reviews by all.  Very simple, threw them on the grill and had time to relax and visit while they slow cooked.  Very tender, I make homemade sauce and they were fall off the bone, stick to your fingers Yummy.

The only reason we stopped eating these is because we were stuffed beyond comfort.  YUM!  Followed recipe exactly.
Make sure though that you do not put aluminum foil on grill until after you turn the heat down....whoops - we thought we had started a fire.

These were excellent.  I only cooked 1.5 lbs ribs on a Q grill and 45 mintues on low was enough.  I will make this again and again.

Even though I saw all the compliments for these ribs, I still thought there is no way you can make 3 lbs of baby back ribs in 1 hour. Boy! was I wrong.  Now I can make them after work during the week, because these are more tender and moist than any I have ever made. Thanks so much for a keeper recipe!!

5 stars on the flavor.  The babyback ribs however, have so little meat, I will use spare ribs or country cut ribs next time.

We used a Weber Charcol grill instead of gas.....the ribs were wonderful! The rub is the best I've had, others have been too spicy, this one adds the flavor not the heat.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce...yummy!  We will try our gas grill the next time, I know the flavor will be great!

I'm giving it 5 stars for the cooking method, as my ribs turned out perfectly cooked,and looked like they came from a Tony Roma's or something, instead of off my grill. I didn't get around to removing the membrane, but will try it next time. The ribs were delicious, with my own rub recipe. Great technique for great ribs...Mmmmm Mmmmm good!

I joined Allrecipes just to rate this recipe.  It's perfect!  The ribs come out perfectly grilled, tender, and flavorful.  My husband said he liked them better than his favorite bbq restaurant's ribs and asked me to cook them again the following night!

I think the cooking method is really the key to this recipe.  I tried it using boneless country-style pork ribs, and following another reviewer's suggestion I baked them on a rack at 325 degrees F for about 1 12 hours for 1 12 lbs of ribs.  They were pretty good, and I did like the seasoning, but the spices never seared together like they would've on the grill.  Still, while I think the grill method would have turned out even better than the oven, either way this is a great last-minute (no marinating) rib recipe, and a good BBQ sauce like Sweet Baby Ray's can make up for the lack of a grill!

This recipe was excellent. The whole family was drooling as soon as I took the ribs off the grill. The flavor of the spices was great!!!

These ribs were fabulous!  As my husband and I do not like chili powder and cumin, I substituted the rub for one that I get every year from the Pork Palace (A pork chop stand at our local state fair).  Cooking them ever so slowly gives them a smoky flavor that does not overwhelm.  Thank you Bonnie for this recipe.  I will never cook ribs any other way!

This was so easy and delicious!!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I don't think I'll ever use my oven again to cook ribs.
