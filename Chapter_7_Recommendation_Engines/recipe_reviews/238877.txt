I used only 1/4 of a Jazz apple, one tablespoon of chocolate chips, and 1 1/2 tablespoons of cream cheese.  I couldn't wrap up the tortilla as directed because there was too much food for a fajita size tortilla.  I did microwave it for about 30 seconds, and I enjoyed every bite.  This would make a nice snack for school kids when they come home in the afternoon!  I could even picture raspberries and white chocolate chips.  Thanks for the idea of this snack!
