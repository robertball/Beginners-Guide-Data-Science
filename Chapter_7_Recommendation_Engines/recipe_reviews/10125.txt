I really feel bad after everyone said this is so good.  I didn't think it was all that special.  I may try again and roll in sugar instead of the nuts to make it more of a cookie.  To me it was more of a pastry.  It was ok, just not what I expected.

Delicious and great-looking. I used more chopped nuts than the recipe called for, though.

followed the ingredients exactly as is, and these came out perfectly. I did need a little bit more of the nuts. I made two batches and the first one I used my hand mixer to blend the ingredients with the make ahead and cookie mix, and the second batch I just used a wooden spoon and my pastry blender to mix it and that dough turned out better than the first batch, but both times the cookies came out perfectly!  Great and easy recipe!

These cookies are tasty and look nice also.  I also used more nuts than the recipe called for and chopped them finely in my food processor.  Nice for Christmas.

This is a great recipe, my family likes the center of these cookies with frosting instead of the jelly!

I made these exactly as written with the exception of a splash of almond extract.  I used cherry preserves in the center.  I used a generous amt. of walnuts because other reviewers said they ran out.  Maybe 1/8-1/4 cup more?  It ended up being just exactly enough.  They were a huge hit at the Christmas party I took them to.  My husband also loves him, and he isn't big on sweets.  With the convenience of the make-ahead mix, I'll definitely make these again.  My doubled recipe made 48.
