I ate this dish a Washington DC Moroccan restaurant. This version was okay. I doubled the cinnamon and sugar and increased the chicken breast to 3. The best part about this dish was missing! Sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top before cooking. After cooking, sprinkle with powdered sugar. This item most often eaten with just your fingers...enjoy!

It was absolutely delicious and easy. I found that I had to use an 8-inch pie tin because I ran out of dough, but my sister and I both made it and it was great (We are 15 and 12.) Thank you for such a delicious recipe!

I have made this recipe twice.  It has turned out delicious both times.  The second time I bought phyllo dough instead of puff pastry dough by mistake.  I made triangles with 2-3 layers of the dough each and it turned out great.

This was good but I agree with others:  one more chicken breast, more cinnamom and sprinkle cinn.-sugar on top.  Dust with powdered sugar before serving.  This is the way I have had it in restaurants.  Thanks!  I always wanted to make it.

Without the coriander, cilantro, ginger and onion this is nothing like the traditional b'stillah I had in Tangiers. Rather boring.

This was delicious!! Even my pickest eater in the family ate most of his serving. The only part I would have changed is to not put cinnamon & sugar on top of the crust as others have suggested. It made it just a bit too "cinnamony". I will make this again!

This is one of my favorite dishes, and this recipe really does it justice.  It's not the easiest to make, but it is worth the effort.

Really close to something worth making again.  It needed some more seasoning and something other than chicken filling the pie.

This was good but not as close to a true B'stilla as I would like.  I poached chicken thighs and breast in boullion with some ras el hanout and garlic w/ onions. Remove chicken and let cool, then shred. Mix eggs and pour into hot boullion like a slurry then strain. Mix with chicken, put in pastry. Also some ground almonds for texture is nice.

My whole family loved this!  Perhaps in the future I might try substituting "hotter" spices like chili pepper, etc in for the cinnamon to give it a more entree and less dessertish feel.

This was AWESOME!  My friend sent me this recipe, and she made a simple chicken gravy to go with it (4 tblsp butter, flour, and some of the leftover chicken broth.)  I tried the same thing.  The entire dish was delicious - my husband loved it, too!

This really is very tasty, my husband and I both loved it.  I remember something similar from a Moroccan restaurant, and agree with a previous reviewer that the cinnamon sugar should be on the top crust, with powdered sugar sprinkled on after it is baked.  I also remembered nuts in the dish, so I added a couple of tablespoons of chopped slivered almonds to each layer.  The next time I have a cocktail party, I think I will make individual servings of this in little squares of the puff pastry. Thanks Susan, this was a hit.

This recipe was great right out of both the oven and the refridgerator. I rated it 5 stars for the recipe but I did added a little extra chicken and sprinkled cinnamon & sugar on top(as suggested) for our family taste preference. Thanks

I don't know if I did something wrong or what.  It probably tastes good but the bottom layer and middle layer of puff pastry didn't get done.  I cooked it much longer than the recipe says and it was still raw.  Where did I go wrong?

I feel like I really shouldn't rate this recipe as I did make a couple changes.  It's a good starting point, and based on other comments as well as other recipes I found online, I sauteed a chopped onion in 1/4 cup butter with 1/2 tsp each ground ginger, coriander & cumin.  I layered that on top of the chicken before sprinkling the cinnamon/sugar mixture, salt, and pepper.  I used about twice as much parsley as the recipe called for.  I also topped the pie with powdered sugar after it was baked and cooled.  When I make it again, I'll add more cinnamon and ginger than I did this time.  My husband has requested that I add some peas, too.  The middle layer of pastry was very soggy & I'm not sure it added anything to the flavor/texture, so I might leave that out too.

Fabulous!  I wasn't sure about cinnamon sugar and chicken but it was great and so different than anything either my husband or I had eaten before.
