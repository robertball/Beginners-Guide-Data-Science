I have been making this recipe for a while now and I must admit it's become my favorite.  I think it's involved but oh so worth it.  Sometimes I like to add a hint of almond extract in the sour cream topping.  This is the one time I allow myself to splurge on such a decadent dessert.  I would give this more than 5 stars if possible because it is THE BEST!

I am a little nervous . I followed this recipe word by word. After pouring the sou cream mixture over the cake, I baked it for 5 minutes as it says in the recipe. My concern is that when I took it out of the oven it looks very runny. Is it suppose to do that and will it firm up in the refrigerator. Other than that it looks like a great recipe!!

Very smooth, no hard areas, perfect uncracked top, fantastic flavor.  DO include the cream of tartar.  I baked mine the full 50 minutes in a water bath, then put on the sour cream topping, left it in the oven 5 min., then cracked the door and let it cool.  I admit I used vanilla wafers for the crust because I like 'em better.  I don't like my cheesecake to be "cakey," I like it totally smooth and this recipe is the one I'll use for the rest of my life.  Kitchen Queen, you rock!

This is very good, foolproof recipe. I made/baked it exactly as directed (no water bath, no leaving in the oven, nothing) except I always use less sugar even though I am crazy about sugar and everything it goes into, but all recipes usually call for way too much of it. 1/8 cup sugar to the crust, 3/4 or less to the cream cheese mix, 1/3 or less to the sour cream mix. But it will taste all right if made with all sugar too :o) If you are going to put sweet fruit topping on top, you may want to use less sugar in the cake. I also never have a cream of tartar, bummer, I just put 1 tsp lemon juice. Do not over beat eggs! No cracks ever!  But it wouldn't matter because you're going to cover it with sour cream. I baked it longer the first time because it was wobbly in the middle, then I baked longer than 5 minutes with sour cream mix on top, but you don't have to do it, 50 and 5 minutes is enough. Anyway,  even over-baked it tasted great. I don't think you can ruin this excellent  recipe. You don't have to be a perfect baker to make this cake, takes minutes to mix everything up, so easy, thank you so much! P.S. I made it dozens of times, comes out perfect every time.

Yes, it's easy. But it didn't have that great cheesecake flavor. It's not bad, just not perfect.

Best cheesecake I've ever had. I made it gluten-free with a pecan/butter/sugar crust. The filling is creamy and rich, everything you'd want in a cheesecake! You've got to try this one!

My family LOVES this cheesecake. It may seem complicated but its easier than it looks. The 1 trick i used was to leave the cheesecake in the oven after its done baking. I simply turn off the oven and open the door half way. I leave it for 2hrs or so then place in the fridge. No cracks every time.

In my recent move, I've lost the book I keep all of my treasured recipes.  Thank you Kitchen Queen.  I have my recipe back.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, my cake turned out perfect!  I've never put my cheesecake in a water bath.  It did not curdle or crack.  I followed the directions exactly.   This is my husband's favorite dessert and I made it for his birthday.  He LOVED it.  Thanks again.  This is definitely a keeper

This cheesecake is perfect..my BF was craving cheesecake for the fourth of July and I found this one!!!    It is DELISH and so EASY.  The only thing I changed..was that I baked the crust first,  (for 15min..at 325'.) I followed the rest of the recipe as it is. Later we topped it with Cherry pie filling which I added a bit of almond extract to!!! SOOOOOO  GOOD!!!!!  Thanks so much:)

Okay so OFFICIALLY my first cheesecake and it turned out pretty good :) This recipe is reallly good though it doesn't really give the information about like a water bath and like small tips and stuff. MINE DIDNT CRACKK! I was so relieved because reading everyone's comments had scared me so much. I layered my springform pan with two sheets of Aluminium foil and then greased that. I then pressed my crust into the pan (with the aluminium foil on it) and put it in the preheated oven for just five minutes. I poured my filling into the crust and put the springform pan into a water bath ( basically any dish filled with around 1 inch of water). Then I left the cheesecake in to bake for fifty minutes after which I opened the door of the oven a crack and left it for 15 minutes. Then i shut the door and left the cheesecake there for 45 minutes. I took it out, let it cool and then after covering it with plastic i left it in the fridge overnight. All my ingredients were at room temperature and I beat the cream for may be even less than a minute with an electric mixer. The rest i did with a fork because i didn't want to overbeat it. I definitely will make this again! Everyone loved it! The only COMPLAINT was that it was too sweet and that next time not only should I use less sugar, but I should also use powdered and not granulated sugar. Thank you soo mcuh for the recipe!

I volunteer at a local hospice unit and I brought this cheesecake with me today and served it with blueberry pie topping. It was gone in a flash. So creamy and delish. I will make this again. This is a keeper.

I made this as written the first time and it didn't turn out. It was very curdled. The second time I used only 3 eggs, and left out the cream of tartar. But more important, I reduced the oven temp to 275 degrees. After 50 minutes it was perfectly done and one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made. Contrary to these instructions, it is okay if the middle is still a little jiggly when you take it out. The stored heat will make it set. The worst thing you can do to cheesecake is overcook it! The lower temp helps with this, even if you sometimes have to cook it a little bit longer.

This worked perfectly for me, though I skipped the cream of tartar.  I think it is the baking technique more than anything that makes this a great recipe.

This recipe has really become a hit with us.  First made it as a groom's cake for a wedding a few weeks ago.  Topped with a champagne maserated fresh blueberry topping.  Then made it again with my fresh strawberries and strawberry all fruit jam champagne reduction with just a touch of powdered sugar and melted butter topping.  Took a couple of spoonfuls of the strawberry mixture and folded them into the sour cream mixture just before baking.  The folks at work devoured the cheesecake in no time flat.  Now, have to make it again for Christmas Eve with the whole family gathering.  I am not so good at pastry, more a savory cook, but this is now a new family tradition.  Also, added the zest of a small lemon to the sour cream mixture.

What a wonderful recipe!  This is the first cheesecake I have made, but it is one of the best I have tasted.  The consistency is perfect and the flavor is just right.  My husband loves cheesecake and he can't get enough of this.  I will be making it again, and again, and again......

After experimenting a few times I found it best to line spring form pan with parchment paper and use a stand mixer on #4 speed and the paddle head from start to finish. All ingredients room temp and softened. Mix cream cheese for about 8-10 mins until smooth, add sugar and continue to let it mix for 5 mins, add vanilla and cream of tartar and mix for 2 mins - scrape sides and bottom of bowl occasionally between additions. Here's the delicate part: While continuing to mix, (with all eggs in measuring cup or bowl) add/spill in eggs one at a time as you see the yolk pop and blend add the next - DO NOT OVER MIX - once you add the forth egg use a baking spatula to scrape down side and turn off mixer. Use spatula to scrape and fold mix from bottom of bowl. Pour into crust prepared pan. Bake for 50 mins following remaining instructions to sour cream. After baking sour cream on for 5 mins, let sit for one hr in pan then remove clasp and use a knife or large icing spatula to run underneath entire cake. Grip pan on one side and help cake off pan with knife or spatula on the other side onto a plate or board. The cake will be a bit flexible which helps the transfer yet but can damage if you drop on plate - glide it down closely to plate.

If in a hurry, microwave the three cream cheese on a plate for 45 secs, then mix for 10 mins until creamy and smooth. For the eggs, soak in hot water for one to two mins then take out.

I needed a plain cheesecake recipe to make a blackberry swirl cheesecake.  I mixed the sour cream into the cream cheese mixture and skipped the extra sugar since I was adding sweet pie filling. I cooked as directed and let cool in the oven.  It was perfect.  The texture and cheesecake flavor were both spot on.

I did not think this recipe was going to work well, I was convinced the sour cream layer would never set. Boy was I wrong. The cheesecake was beautiful! Everything set well and it looked great, no cracks and the sour cream layer keeps you from getting that slightly overdone top to the cheesecake I never liked. I also added cinnamon to the crust. The cake improves as a day or two passes and is a nice consistency. I prefer a dense cheesecake as opposed to the fluffy types and this nice, not too heavy. It is sweet but the sour cream layer works very well. May family loved it and demanded I make another!

I love this recipe, I found that I had enough cream cheese mixture to make two 8" pies, I also found that if you whip the sour cream topping ingredients until they are stiff, it doesn't run and makes the pie absolutely beautiful. I plan on using this recipe often.

I have made this recipe twice and I LOVE it! It is always praised by everybody that has had a chance to try the cheesecake. I even made it once with gluten-free Graham crackers so that my sister-in-law with celiac disease could enjoy it and it turned out amazing! I will definitely use this recipe whenever I make it. There is absolutely nothing I would change!

I really like this recipe and it has always gone over well wherever I take it.  People are usually saying it's the best they've every had...

One issue I have if anyone has some advice on....  When I take the cake from the oven for the 5 minutes as suggested, the middle settles and I always have a ridge around the edge.  No cracks, and it doesn't hurt the taste, but there is a ridge around the whole thing..  Not sure how to address...

Other than that problem, a great recipe!

This is by far the BEST cheesecake I have ever tasted - kudos to Kitchen Queen!  First off, this is the first time I ever made cheesecake, and I thought the directions were and easy to follow.  Second, I don't have a springform pan and the pan I had was smaller than what the recipe called for.  So when I poured the batter in, it filled up really full - I scooped some out and then reduced the sour cream mixture at the end.  Despite the minor adjustments, it was still amazing!  Incredibly smooth and rich - I will definitely make this again!

this is the best cheesecake recipe ever. I use it every year for my husband's birthday. This year, I thought I couldn't find it online, and panicked, but I'm so relieved I found it! In Turkey, I cant get sour cream so I substitute it with yoghurt, and it still tastes great!

I made this for Easter dinner and everyone raved about it.  My son said it was the best cheesecake he's ever eaten.  If you are looking for a dense cheesecake, this is not the recipe for you.  It has a very smooth texture and is moist.  I stuck to the recipe as written except subbed reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream.  I don't know how it could have been any better with full fat ingredients.  This will be my go to recipe for a NY style cheesecake.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  It is very quick and easy, however, the texture is a light and fluffy one.  I was hoping for a more dense type of cheesecake.  The flavor is very good though.  Thanks for sharing.

This turned out the BEST cheesecake I had ever made. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I also used a 9 1/2 in springfoam pan.
 It turned out so good and creamy. I took it to a family gathering and everyone couldn't stop talking about how good it was.

A good recipe.  The flavors were there, or could be adjusted to taste.  The texture was a little off (crumbly instead of smooth and creamy).  I made it as directed (no water bath) and it didn't crack.

I didn’t make changes to this cake, followed recipe as is. This cake tasted good, but, the crust was too sweet. I would not add sugar to crust. I also found this cake to be smaller than others I have made.

Excellent recipe and it was a big hit at my daughters birthday party. I combined it with a layer of fudgey cake and chocolate ganache to fill between the layers and to cover it all (as was her birthday order...) it was a huge hit!

I have made this several times now and it has never let me down. I don’t have graham crackers. I use vanilla wafers. I use these in other things,  they are cheap enough and freeze well. Otherwise I make this exactly as stated. One of the best cheese cakes I have ever had.

I play around with the crust a lot... adding chopped pecans, real maple syrup, cinnamon & usually some extra graham cracker crumbs! The crust is very important to me in my cheesecake...  
My husband says it's the best cheesecake he has ever eaten!

Made with Vanilla Wafer crust and used extra strong pure vanilla extract and topped with salted caramel sauce (also found on All Recipes). De-de-de-LICIOUS!! I figured 16 servings since very rich, but 10 people wiped it out in one sitting!  Can be made with many flavors of crust and a multitude of toppings. But, since I’m not a huge chocolate fan the Vanilla and Salted Caramel were divine!  Followed directions exactly, except vanilla wafer crust and lots of top dollar vanilla  8-)

Eh, this was not too my taste. I'm used to the thick "New York style" which is what I was looking for. This one is ok at best to me. The top helpful review called it "involved". I wouldn't call it involved at all. Unless they're referring to adding the sour cream top. Of which I could definitely do without. This was really a pretty basic recipe compared to another I tried which was a thicker consistency. I did see another recipe that I'll probably try that looks to be the thicker style I'm looking for.

I can't stop eating this cake! I made this cheesecake because I wanted to use it as a vehicle for some delicious pomegranate vinegar I have in the pantry, but it ended up stealing the show. I followed the directions and my cake did crack a bit, but the sour cream topping hid all flaws. I grew up on no-bake "cheesecake" and I've always secretly hated actual cheesecake, but this recipe is so moist and creamy I think it's perfect. I did change one teeeeensy thing when making it - I added a bit of salt to the graham cracker crust. I just think graham cracker crusts always taste better that way.

This is my first cheesecake ever.  My sister normally bakes the  Philadelphia cream cheese recipe, but it's just too rich to eat in my opinion. This cheesecake blends richness and creaminess perfectly. It did crack just slightly on the side, but easily covered up by sour cream topping.  I added freshly squeezed lemon juice and topped with bananas and blueberry topping. Family loved it.  I will bake this one again for the holidays! I did follow directions exactly besides the lemon juice. Kitchenqueen has it together on this recipe!

I did change the cream of tarter to lemon zest  and it was great will make again and again. I did bake the crust for 5 min. then filled and baked for 50 min. perfect time then let cool on counter top for 5 min. then put on sour cream topping put back in oven for 5 min. and then let it cool on counter top till room temp. then in the fridge overnight in pan and what a delight when cut into cannot go wrong with this recipe.

Made this cheese cake today; it turn out excellent. I found the recipe easy to follow. In fact, I only made the crust and had my thirteen year old son complete the task. I love this recipe, but I did substitute low fat sugar for the white sugar. A keeper! Thanks for sharing! ??

I made the recipe as suggested and it turned out great, however I used a water bath to bake it.  You have to use the large, heavy duty aluminum foil to avoid wetting the crust.

My family absolutely loved this. Made it the night before for Memorial Day and it was a Huge hit. Creamy and very easy to make. One suggestion is add lemon zest to the cheesecake batter before baking. The flavor is amazing.

I made this last night and had it for desert today. The aroma of it cooking and after it was baked was heavenly. I followed the recipe to a t.  I would reduce the sugar per a previous reviewer, a little less sweet would not detract from this splendid luxurious desert.

I baked it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and then reduced it to 200 degrees for an additional 35 minutes.  I took it out at that time and frosted it with the sour cream and baked it for an additional 10 minutes.  I left it in the oven with the heat turned off until cooled and then refrigerated.  I topped it with a raspberry pie filling and fresh raspberries.  The sour cream topping was a perfect foil for the sweet topping.  Will absolutely make again.

I substituted ginger snaps for the graham crackers. Just like the taste and consistency better and I would bake it before adding the filling, next time. I'd also omit the sour cream topping, as I don't consider that a "New York" style cheesecake. Flavor was very good though, and with those small changes, I will make this again.

I refrigerated the cream cheese and eggs and beat the batter when these items were added. It turned out fluffy and tasted amazing! People have now asked me to make 3 more for a ice hockey championship this weekend:) I will definitely be making this again!

My husband said it's the best cheesecake he's ever had. It's not very dense, so if you prefer your cheesecake to be on the dense side, you will not agree. I used 1 t. lemon juice because I had no cream of tartar.  The batter was thinner than the other recipe I've used (which is a pumpkin cheesecake), but it baked perfectly. I also added a shake of cinnamon to the crust. I will make this cheesecake often! EDIT 2018: I make this often, and now I always use the cream of tartar. I have learned through experimentation that Philadelphia brand full fat cream cheese is the best. I've won my state fair competition two years in a row with this recipe!

This was my first time I ever made cheesecake and my daughter said it was the best she ever ate.  I will save this recipe forever.  It was so good.

Altered recipe slightly by substituting Splenda where it called for sugar, sugar free chocolate chip cookies in the crust and about 1/2 cup Baileys Irish Cream Liquor in the batter.  Makes it into a low carb treat!  Have tried many cheesecake recipes.  This one was by far the best as far as presentation and taste.

This recipe was great. It was easy and delicious. Waiting the 6 hours was the hardest thing about the recipe. I have never made cheesecake and this was foolproof.

All I can say is WOW! This is the easiest and the best tasting cheesecake recipe I have found! Plain or New York Cheesecake has always been my favorite, and this one is perfect, just the right amount of sweetness. For those of my guests that prefer fruit topped cheese cake, I added it after I sliced it, to add the option of plain or not. It tastes good both ways , but to me better plain. This recipe will become my favorite now. I made it for my son's birthday, and will now make it for my sister at her suprise 50th this year. I made the recipe just as described, and wouldn't change a thing, as you shouldn't change perfection! Thanks for sharing,Kitchen Queen1

Excellent!! Everyone loved it and it was very easy to make.  Two cheesecake aficianados said it was the best they have had. Only change I would make is less on the sour cream topping.  It was pretty thick and a little too tart for my younger son and even me (who loves tart things).  Of course adding chocolate to the topping would help! Next time I will try that.

I made this cheesecake just last night for my husband to take to a holiday luncheon at work.  I couldn't let him take it without taking a little sample for myself.  It was delicious!  It really wasn't hard to put together either.  My cake cracked on the top like other reviewers said theirs did but when you put the sour cream mixture on top - no one would ever know.  I'll definetly make this one over and over!

For me, there was too much sugar in the crust.  I was also hoping this would be a really rich cheesecake like what I had growing up bake east but it just wasn't.  It's good, it just wasn't what I know of NY style cheesecakes.
