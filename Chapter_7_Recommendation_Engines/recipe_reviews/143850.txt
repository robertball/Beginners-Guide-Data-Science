I like your recipe i do this instead took hotdogs sliced 3/4 way through an stuffed with cheese an then wrapped with the bacon an used toothpicks to hold bacon in place. Then griled cheese side down at first when cheese starts to melt turn hot dogs an finish cooking. We have been doing this for years, family an friends love them.

This is the absolute best way to eat a hotdog. My family has been eating hot dogs like this for years. The only thing we change is to add chili to the hotdogs (can chili works just fine).  The bacon really adds a nice flavor to the hotdog. For someone like me this is important. I hate the taste of most hotdog sausage meats, even the all beef brands. So the bacon actually enhances the often unappetizing taste and adds a nice smoky flavor.

A fun weekend food. It was too cold to grill today so I assembled these slightly different. I just tossed the bacon and onion in a fry pan for a few minutes, with the hot dogs. I assembled the buns, cheese, hotdogs, onion bacon and bbq sauce then I broiled them for just about 2-3 minutes on high with an extra 1/2 slice of cheese on top. The kids and hubby loved them and polished them off! Frying up the onion with the bacon really helped take the bite off so the kids could enjoy it too. The bbq sauce was something fun and out of the ordinary than ketchup. Even in on cold winter days you can still enjoy this food if you just prepare it with a little imagination.

This is really bendable to what you like the most on your dog. My husband likes american cheese but my kids and I are all about the sharp cheddar. They like barbeque sauce on their dogs but I like to top mine with sauerkraut and spicy mustard. It's also a good base for a chili dog. This is a fun recipe to make with the kids (they love to wrap their dogs with bacon--come on, who doesn't love double meat--bacon wrapped dogs?) and it's always a quick way to solve the "what should I make for dinner" blahs.

I make this same hot dog almost identically, except I use  a slice of my own oak wood home smoked  sharp Cheddar. However in short, everything including a piece of old tractor tire is better with bacon.

Very good! I've never thought of putting BBQ sauce on my hot dog but it was really good! I didn't have Swiss so I had to sub with American.

Really good flavor. I never thought of putting bbq on a hot dog bun before. I did feel like it was missing some tomatoes though. Thanks for the recipe.

Well, I can't speak for myself on this one but my husband sure did enjoy it! Spruce up a plain 'ol hot dog with some cheese and one of his all time favorites - bacon and we have a winner. This definitely is much better than your average hot dog. All I did was add a little mustard to the mix and of course an ice cold beer on the side!

Have made a similar recipe for yours:  Slice dogs lenghtwise (not all the way through)  place cheese of choice in dog, wrap partially cooked bacon strip around dog, secure bacon with toothpicks and either broil or grill til done.  We called them "Swanky Frankies".  I and the kids loved them!

Excellent and easy hot dog!  We didn't have any swiss cheese so we just used a grated cheese blend instead!  Will definately make again!

This was a nice change from "normal" hot dogs. It was too cold to use the grill outside, so I cooked them on my griddle. I used honey BBQ sauce, and thought it was a little too sweet--will use regular BBQ sauce or even mayo next time. I did think these were a little hard to eat--too much stuff for the buns, and they fell apart. Maybe I will use sausage buns next time. Thanks for the recipe!!

Fantastic as far as hot dogs go.  I used bun length turkey dogs and this recipe  really helped them become tasty. Didn't want to fire up the grill  so I wrapped bacon around dogs and broiled till crispy.  Had large Coney Style buns so fit 2 dog into each bun. Broiled cheese on buns and loaded them up.  Delicious for a hot dog fix.

I made exactly as written except cooked them in the broiler oven - split the dogs lengthwise when almost done and put the cheese & bacon slice in the dog. I then put them under the broiler until cheese melted. Very good!

Made this exactly as written, however, I did lightly brush melted butter on the buns before grilling them.  For the barbecue sauce, I used Sweet Baby Ray's.  I have to admit I had never used Swiss Cheese, bacon or barbecue sauce on a grilled hot dog and was skeptical as to how this would turn out as we are lovers of mustard, slaw and chili on our hot dogs !  Surprise - this is quite tasty - what is not to like about a delicious beef hot dog, crunchy smoked bacon, tangy cheese, sweet sauce on a butter toasted hot dog bun and sprinkled with spicy onion.  Great Memorial Day recipe!  Thanks Drink Spiller for sharing!

My kids are picky eaters (including my autistic son).  Although they like hot dogs they don't like change.  But this recipe was great!  I used white onions instead (picky kids), turkey dogs, colby jack mixed shredded cheese and hickory honey smoked BBQ sauce.  For the adults I used  the recipe as written (except the BBQ sauce) and they loved it!   I made some homemade hand cut french fries and we were in business! This recipe offered a new twist to an old friend :)  If you are looking for new and different ways to make hot dogs (outside of the usually mustard, ketchup , relish, onions etc...) this is definitely the way to go!! :)

I'll put more cheese next time.

5 stars for flavor. If you're going to need a lot of bacon though, a lot better in a 400 oven for 10-15 minutes than cooking in a pan. Easier and the bacon stays flat. Less greasy too.

I should preface this review w/a disclaimer:  I'm a hot dog purist.   I prefer hot dogs roasted over a campfire, on a cheap bun, w/mustard and onions.  For some reason, this recipe caught my eye and I've been craving it since I added it to my recipe box.  We made them tonight and they were just as delicious as I'd anticipated, though I did opt to sub yellow mustard for BBQ sauce, cause I'm just not a BBQ fan and knew it would really throw off the taste for me.  Other than, that, good stuff!  I'm lazy, so I nuked 2 slices of Oscar Meyer Center Cut bacon for a couple of minutes to make the process even easier.  While this won't become THE way of eating hot dogs for me (still the fire, yellow mustard, onions...), I WILL make these whenever we have some swiss to use.  THANKS, drink spiller (BTW-have you tried a sippy cup?)!

When we make these, the difference is we actually wrap the bacon around the hotdog....grill or fry slowly as you roll the dog for even cooking.  Then top with the cheese.  Delish!

We’ve had hot dogs in the freezer for some time now and I wanted to use them up, so I thought we’d give this recipe a try.  I wrapped the hotdog with the bacon and secured it with toothpicks.  Hubs grilled them until the bacon was crisp all around.  We tried a couple of versions to see which we liked best.  I had both Swiss cheese as well as pepperjack, and I put out both barbeque sauce and mustard, and of course the chopped red onion.  I think both Hubs and I preferred the pepperjack with mustard over the Swiss with barbeque sauce.  All in all, for us this was just a hotdog.  I’m not sure I liked it any better than a plain old hotdog slathered with mustard, but it was fun to try something new.

Ive been making these hot dogs for years.The way i make them i first split dogs put either american or cheddar cheese in the slit then wrap the dogs with bacon.  Take a cookie sheet with a piece of foil and spray with cooking spray and bake in the oven at 400 degrees until bacon is one. Delish........

This is very similar to the A&W's Whistle Dog, which has cheddar cheese, sauted onions and bacon with their sauce. Also a very good choice when travelling.

The right way to make these is to slice the hotdog 3/4 deep and stuff with cheese then wrap with bacon, secure with toothpicks and either grill or cook under the broiler

My husband is NOT a hotdog eater!  But when I served this to him, he said this is the MAN version of a hotdog.  I did add 2 strips of bacon to each dog and I also put the Swiss cheese on the bread and threw it into the toaster oven until the cheese was bubbly, it was great!

My family just discovered hotdogs cooked this way about a year ago, but we will never eat another "regular" hotdog again. Only difference is I wrap the bacon around the hotdog and secure it at each end with a toothpick. Once the bacon is done the hotdog is done. You can then remove the toothpick because the bacon holds the wrapped shape once it is done. YUM!!!

As a hot dog purest, I believe that only mustard, relish and onions should adorn a hot dog.  That leaves little options of any other condiments to adorn a dish I grew up on.  However, when I read "bacon" in the recipe, I figured what could be wrong with that.  I was right.  This will go into my faves list as a option for my hot dogs.  I love options.  PS...saute those onions in a little bacon grease.  mmmmmmmm.

We liked this, however it was missing something, not sure what, but was very good.  Will have to work on it a bit, great for kids, not spicy at all.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars for absolute deliciousness.  It gets 0 stars for healthy but you aren't looking for a healthy recipe it you're considering this recipe.  Tried it for a special 4th of July 'treat' meal and it was a big hit.

YUM...Great combo of flavors! We LOVED the swiss in this, but I think cheddar would also be nice. Hubby was skeptical, but he enjoyed them too. Will def make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
