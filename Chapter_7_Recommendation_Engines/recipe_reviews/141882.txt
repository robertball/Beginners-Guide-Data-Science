This our standard way to make pan cornbread.  Corn pone is hand formed and is shaped something like hands folded in prayer.  It is "grown" in a 425/450 deg. oven till the outside is medium brown and crispy while the inside is moist and soft.  At least here in the foothills we've been making it this way since out of memory........Also; you bet! Sugar is for cakes, cookies and iced tea, not cornmeal goodies.

My grandmother in Texas made corn pone for our family when I was a kid. She made individual servings by forming them in her hands. They were wonderful! I am now 77 and remembering the "good old days.

Our old mountain family recipe uses no eggs. We add a little more buttermilk and 2 teaspoons baking SODA. We preheat the skillet with the oil in it 
(bacon grease in the old days). The batter sizzles when it is poured into the skillet. A little oil is tilted up over the top of the batter.  After baking, turn out bread onto tea towel and wrap it up for about 10 minutes before serving. Firm crispy crust with dense creamy center.

This recipe makes a dense product that is easy to toss together on a week night to add a special touch to any meal. Best served warm. Makes a great snack at work the next day too. FYI this is NOT corn bread and the recipe as is produces a plain flavored product. Use of a heated cast iron skillet adds to the crispy-ness of the outside of the pone too.

Making this right now! Sounds good, my great grandmother used to make pone bread and i remember it being salty and crumbly, i dont like sweet cornbread at all. So i hope this comes close to hers. Only thing i am going to change is instead of canola oil i am using bacon grease.

It was okay, but not my thing.  Dense and bland.  I added flour, sugar, and baking powder to the rest of the batter and they rose nicely.  I guess I'm more of a traditional cornbread gal.

I liked it but my wife didn't. This has totally different texture.  Dense and firm since there is no leavening agents involved. I think that next time I will substitute bacon grease for the canola oil, though.

Just made this for the 1st time, largely out of curiosity. Living in Europe I had to convert the units to metric, and may have gone wrong there. 60ml of oil for 260gr of mais flour with about 350ml of liquid excluding the eggs seems excessive (much more than required to coat the skillet) so I skimmed it after about 20min of cooking. I also used regular teaspoons for the salt: the indicated quantity (twice what I used, I think) would make for an inedible result.
I tried fermented milk instead of buttermilk (not available here), which contains a lot more fat and is thicker, so I had to add almost 100ml of additional regular milk in order to get what I'd call a thin batter. It's possible too that my flour is too fine: I can only get the grind for making polenta and something that's a lot finer.
The result (after 10 additional minutes) looks and smells good though, a bit like what we call an egg "flan" here in France.

The two star rating is not to indicate that there is anything wrong with the recipe.  It's just not what I thought.  Since making it, I figured out that what I really wanted was what we used to call corn sticks growing up.  (Generally cooked in a cast iron pan with little half corn shapes made into it.)  Both grandmamas made awesome corn sticks but I never learned to do it.   I had hoped that it would just be corn sticks in a different shape.   This was dense and salty, as was described, but it just wasn't what I was looking for.

This simple and easy recipe makes a delicious bread that's perfect for breakfasts. Two suggestions: (1) Use half the salt; (2) Bake 30 minutes (this will vary according to your oven, of course, but mine requires more than 20-25 to get this bread crispy). Incidentally, it's not entirely clear to me whether this is in fact authentic corn pone; Wikipedia (for what it's worth) characterizes corn pone as milk-less and egg-less. By whatever name, this recipe is becoming a classic staple in our family.

Extremely salty- we couldn't eat it. Otherwise it seemed good (texture, etc.)

I use this recipe to make corn bread sticks to take to the Annual Home Coming Covered Dish at church.  The consistency of the corn bread is very good with this recipe.  It is best to make them the day before or very early in the morning of the event.

Loved this recipe. Tasted exactly like my mothers and my Mama's cornbread. Easy to make. I think I may pan fry it next time.

I was looking for a traditional appalachian cornbread, not sweet, made it a cast iron skillet.  This fit the bill, just like I grew up with.  Love it.

Mine came out as a flat dense patty. and was not good.  Other recipes have you pour the hot oil into the batter, this one does not.  The patty swims in the hot oil.

I'm tempted to make this every day.  I have a small skillet; so I cut both the ingredients and times in half, and the result is perfect!  I also love that this uses simple, traditional ingredients.

I did not enjoy this, but I think the recipe is fine. (Does that make sense?) It came out the oven after 30 minutes exactly as I had hoped, brown all around, a little dry and somewhat crunchy. But it turns out I DO like a little sweetness to my cornpone, or cornbread. I'll try a different recipe next time.
