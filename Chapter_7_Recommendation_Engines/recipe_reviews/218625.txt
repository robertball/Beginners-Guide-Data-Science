This was so simple to make (if you have the fresh lime and cilantro on hand). I poured it over salmon and baked it in a glass dish for 350 (about 15 minutes, making sure not to overcook the fish).  It came out moist and delicious with a nice, light flavor.  I might consider reducing the soy just a bit and adding some ginger next time.

I poured over salmon and baked.  Very good flavor but I also would reduce the soy next time too.  Nice and light, made me think of a summer meal.

This is an unusual, tangy sauce that complemented grilled salmon nicely.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I was worried that the strong flavors might overpower the delicate, fresh Alaskan salmon.  I grilled the salmon on a hickory plank with no added seasonings, adding this sauce to the fish on the plate.  We found the sauce to be just right, with the bright lime flavor being a nice change from the usual lemon.  The two of use used less than half the sauce, saving even more calories!

Definately double the ingredients!  The taste of the sauce alone is great!  BUT even though I left the salmon marinating for a couple of  hours; the flavor was only apparent on top of the salmon :(

This was absolutely delicious and so simple! I wasn't sure whether or not it was meant to be served on the side or if the salmon should be marinated and cooked in it. I opted for serving it on the side as a sauce and I also added some ginger as was suggested by another reviewer ... thanks for sharing!

I poured this sauce over salmon fillets and baked.  It was easy and flavorful.  I will definitely make it again!
