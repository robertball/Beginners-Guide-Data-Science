I make this into muffins as it always cooks a little more evenly for me.   Also, I mix about 1/4 cup sugar and about a teaspoon of cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle on top before baking.  :) It's so good!!

This bread is pretty good and easy to make.  I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour and the texture of the bread wasn't too heavy.  I would probably add some cinnamon to the mixture next time for added interest.

This is a wonderful bread!  I used 1 1/2 cup of all purpose and 1 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour to make it more healthy.  It also needs more moisture so to add 1/2 cup applesause and 1/2 cup of butter milk made it even better!

Substituted whole wheat flour, healthy and fabulous.  Love how the coconut mixes with the zucchini and chocolate flavors.

I have tried several zucchini bread recipes lately.  Most did not turn out.  This one did turn out, but, 1 tablespoon of baking soda was too much. The loaf did rise well, but, it had a very soda like taste to it.  My kids devoured it though, even my picky eater that will not eat anything that looks like it may resemble a vegetable.  I dropped my zucchini into the food processor and processed until it was in very small pieces.  It was much faster than grating the zucchini.

This lovely bread is not too sweet and ideal for enjoying with your coffee.  The only change I made was to use one cup of regular size chocolate chips.   Next time I would add vanilla extract because I thought it was missing a little something.  Also, despite squeezing the moisture from the zucchini, the baking time for me was inadequate and I needed to add about 10-15 minutes more.  With all zucchini breads, I always put parchment paper on the bottom, and grease and flour the bread pan for ease in removing it from the pan.   Overall, a nice bread and an excellent use of zucchini from your garden.

I baked mine an extra 15 minutes and it is STILL VERY raw in the center.  Was the zucchini supposed to be squeezed to get some moisture out or what?  Recipe doesn't say to.  I will say that it smells great though.  Took it out of the pan and it is back in the oven on a cookie sheet.  It only gets 3 stars until I taste it.

I honestly did not notice this recipe said to use a TABLESPOON of baking soda.  I assumed it would be a teaspoon, so that's what I saw and what I used.  A tablespoon would be crazy, I think!  Also, this definitely makes enough for two loaf pans.  It is good, but I had to knock off a star for those two mistakes.

Pretty tasteless, definitely needs some vanilla and spices added to the recipe.  I won't be making it again.

I didn't make changes and I thought it tasted too much like baking soda. I probably would try again with less baking soda. I liked the coconut and chips. Nice change from the usual spice flavor of other recipes.

This recipe sounds good in theory. Sadly, I found it to be incredibly dry and without much flavor

I made this zucchini bread but added 1-1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and a tablespoon  of vanilla.   I also split the batter into two loaf pans.  I had to add about 10 minutes to the cook time.  We tasted it right out of the oven and again the following morning for breakfast.  I thought it was just good but not amazing.  I think adding brown sugar would improve the taste.  So for me, three stars.

I have tried making this cake twice and twice I have had to cook it longer than what is stated.  My toothpick comes out clean, and I check several spots before removing.  I let the cake cool a little, take out of pan to finish cooling.  As it cools, the middle always falls and you can tell the cake is still raw inside. This has happened both times.  And I am o amateur baker.....I have baked for many years.  Just today, when the bread cooled and I could tell it was raw, I cut the first slice and was able to take a taste of the end since that was the only piece that was cooked almost all the way.  The cake definitely has way too much baking soda in it. I'm not sure if the recipe was written wrong or not but 1 tablespoon of baking soda for a loaf pan is ridiculous.  I MAY try one more time, reducing the baking soda and putting the mix into a bundt pan since I think there's too much mix for a loaf pan, maybe that's why it isn't cooking right.

Very good. I cut the oil and sugar to about 3/4 cup each and used white whole wheat flour. It came out great. The (unsweetened) coconut flakes make a great addition.

Also yummy with raisins instead of coconut and chocolate chips - or with just nuts.

I found this very dry. It almost could make 2 cakes. Next time will add apple sauce and milk, as per other review.
