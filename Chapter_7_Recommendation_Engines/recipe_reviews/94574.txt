The flavours are good, but the texture isn't right for us. That being said I made the following changes: white basmati rice, family pack of chicken legs with thigh (4lbs.), canned diced tomatoes, frozen okra, 2 cups frozen corn/peas/carrots/beans mix and creole-type seasoning. Everything else remained the same. There was so much liquid I baked this uncovered the whole time. The rice also came out mushy and shapeless. Chicken wasn't flavourful and the skin rubber-y. This recipe has potential if the cooking method is changed; cook the rice separately using 4 cups of stock (we use a rice cooker). Combine the remaining cup of stock and only one can of tomatoes in a baking dish. Add veggies (I'd use the same combination as this time), bay leaves and mix it all up. Rub the chicken with Creole-type (anything cumin-y is great) seasoning and brown on the stove in a pan (reduces oven time, gets the skin a little crisp and adds flavour). Add on top of veggie-stock mixture and bake uncovered for 30-45 minutes or until done. Serve on top of rice.

I thought the flavor was sort of bland and I added some creole seasoning.  I didn't quite like the texture of the rice though.  I'll try it again though, with a few changes.

Good recipe but had to make a few changes.  Used 1 28oz can tomatoes and 3cups chic broth.  I spiced it up with some Tony Chacheres creole seasoning and minced garlic.  Next time I'll add more okra, some diced onion and bell pepper.  Also once I had rice and broth, ect in pan chicken would not fit....so will cook this in a crockpot or dutch oven.

This was okay. The texture was odd, and overall, I felt it was a little bland for my liking. I know you can doctor up the spices of any recipe, but I always follow the original as-is the first time through. I probably won't make this again, but it was nice to try something different.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  I love all of the ingredients.  I'm sure it would be much better if it was prepared more traditionally, as opposed to a dump-style.  The rice under my chicken didn't cook, and the rest of the rice was obliterated mush.  I ended up picking out the okra and chicken pieces so that I wouldn't waste it all =(

Has some serious texture issues with the rice when done. Rice becomes very overcooked and is soggy, mushy and with absolutely no firmness to it. I had to end up separating the rest of the dish out and scraping the rice out that was baked to put in fresh cooked rice when finished to save the dish.
