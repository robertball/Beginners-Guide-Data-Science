Fantastic recipe.  I used half and half instead of the heavy cream.  I reduced the amount a little to compensate for a more runny fluid.  Still tasted great!

This is the only way to eat creamed corn!  I have made it with and without the Parm. cheese.  It tastes amazing either way, just depends on your mood and if you want the parm flavor in there.  You MUST make this!

Diana, you certainly did a great job of making my family plus the boyfriends extremely happy. Hubby and youngest daughter are addicted to canned cream corn, but when they tasted this, they couldn't believe the difference. My older daughter can't stand creamed corn but decided to give this a taste. Guess what? Her plate had a huge helping! My cooking method was a bit different. I don't do milk and flour as I prefer to make a roux with the butter and flour. Used more corn as my packages were 14 ouncer's. Also added just a touch of seasonings, but cut way back on the salt. Gang came back for seconds and thirds. Thanks so much for a great recipe! Thanks to you too Tay~Tay and Cookie for your input!

Oh MY GOODNESS!  My family is a super fan of the creamed corn sold at a magnificent BBQ place in TX - their corn is increadible.  YOUR RECIPE IS PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL!  I never thought I would  be able to prepare it as good as our family favorite. I SCORED A 1000 LAST NIGHT! It will be a part of many BBQ's to come. THANK YOU!

I have made this recipe before (I have a version of my own).  It can't be beat as far as comfort food goes. It is rich and creamy and I have yet to serve this to anyone who didn't love love love it. I however take time to do one more step, mostly for presentation purposes. After it's done on the stove, I heat the oven to 350 degrees F. and spray a 9x13 pyrex dish with pam. I then pour the corn mixture into the pyrex dish and sprinkle it with shredded parmesean so that it can brown on top. It makes it pretty. I let it sit in the oven for about 25 minutes to brown. Great recipe thanks!!

After reading all the great reviews I was sure I had stumbled on a real winner - I was wrong.  This was simply corn in cream sauce.  Nothing special and not particularly good.  My friend and I tried to figure out why it was so bland - and what it needed to make it great - we just couldn't find anything to help it.  So, I added chicken broth, some sage and thyme and tomorrow I'll transform this into what I hope will be a Corn and Chicken Chowder.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I think I can salvage it to some other purpose. Sorry, I was totally underwhelmed by this one.

Diana,

You are right on the money saying this was cream corn like no other. I was really scared about how this was going to turn out with the ingredients I was using but everyone absolutely loved it. It is one of the best corn recipes I have ever tasted. We are cooking it tonight and will not adjust the recipe one bit. It's fabulous just as it is. TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!

This recipe is so delicious!  I had never made home made cream corn before, but when I saw this recipe and all the reviews I decided to give it a try.  Well, I have now served this at several holiday buffets and everyone loves it!  I agree with some of the reviews that the sauce can be a little thin, but I make it early in the morning and place in the crock pot on low for the day, to simmer and thicken.  Also if you make it a day ahead, the next day the sauce is the perfect consistency!  I then serve it right from the crock pot and it is so warm and creamy and delicious!  It is good with or without the cheese, as the last couple of times I served it I got so busy I forgot to add the cheese!  I scaled the recipe to serve 24 people and I only had a small container left over, as everyone always takes seconds!   I used frozen Birds Eye steamfresh corn and it tasted delicious.

I am a breast cancer survivor. I have been in remission for just over five years. YAY ME (and all the other survivors)!!!!!!!! I am convinced a large part of my remission success is a radical lifestyle change. Most of the foods approved by the FDA cause cancer. Fresh produce treated with pesticides, anything canned, and processed foods are some of the biggest food demons. I have been looking for a creamed corn recipe. This recipe rocks. It is quick. It is easy. It is delicious. It also freezes exceptionally well. I like fresh herbs in my foods so I added a couple table spoons of organic mint this time. Yep, this recipe is cotton pickin killer. Diana, you did an excellent job on this recipe.

This creamed corn was soooooo good!  I made it a lower fat version by using 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream, 1% milk rather than whole milk and Smart Balance rather than butter.  I didn't use the parmesan at all... took the advice of others and glad I did!  My husband said it was one of the best things I've ever made and it was sooooooo easy!  I served it alongside baked barbeque pork ribs.  YUMMYYYYYYYYYYY!

This was the most delicious creamed corn I ever ate. I used C&W Sweet White Corn (frozen). As I was cooking, I got frustrated, as it was not thickening up fast enough, so I dumped the entire 32 oz. bag in there. Well, it did eventually come around, after about 20 minutes, and it was perfect! I did not add 1/4 cup parm, but just a hint of.. and I have to say that this recipe will grace my Thanksgiving table for years to come. Thank you, Diana.

Wonderful!! I used canned corn, substituted honey for the sugar (and only half of what was called for or it will be too sweet) and a little more pepper. The cooking time take much longer then stated so have patience and let it come to a slight boil so the mixture will thicken. Took me more like 30 minutes. This is the best creamed corn I've ever had!!!

Slam dunk!  How often can you get such a good side dish with 5 minutes preparation time?!  I decided to do the recipe as is and concur with other reviewers that it doesn’t need any tweaking.  I know this is suppose to make 8 portions (of about 1/2 a cup), but only about 2/3 of that actually made it to the plates; the cook got hungry.

WOWEE!!! I used a pound of frozen corn- just run it under hot water in a colander for a minute. Make sure you use PLAIN corn....not sweet or with any added ingredients. I halved the rest of the ingredients. I simmered mine until it was pretty thick. (before adding the parm) Perfection. Thanks!

Very good! I cooked the corn with butter, salt, pepper, sugar first; mixed in the flour, then added 1.5 cups of fat free half and half and cooked until thickened and added cheese at the end. It turned out great!

This is for the times when you are going to reward yourself with something really rich tasting. I substituted 8 ears of fresh corn for the frozen. I cut the kernels off the cob (I have a handy-dandy special device for this ), then ran the back of a large knife over the shorn cobs to extract all the good juice from them. This is what really gives it a great, rich corn flavor. A little extra work, but worth it if you have some fresh corn and just don't want to eat it boiled again. I left out the Parmesan cheese and it still tasted great.

I never liked creamed corn, then I had some at a friend's wedding with whole kernels in a dairy cream sauce.  When I found this recipe, I figured it would be pretty close.  It turned out better than I expected.  I made some for family at Thanksgiving and there were no leftovers.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

OMG!!!  Simply delicious.  Creamy, rich and flavorful!  Note:  I didn't add parmesan cheese because I didn't have any, but this dish was good without it.  I also added a couple dashes of red cayenne pepper and a little more sugar than the reciped called for.

I made a lighter version. I used 1% milk instead of heavy creamer and a little less flour, butter  and sugar but this turned out really good even as a lighter version. thanks for the recipe.

This was wonderful.  I had it w/ Lemon-Pepper pork loin my yongest adored it. She kept thanking me for making it.  It does remind us of the one served at a famous BBQ place here in Texas minus the cheese.  Just wonderful!

If I could give this higher than 5 stars I would. I don't fix corn often, but I just couldn't stop eating this.  It is definatly the best cream corn I've ever tasted. Thanks for sharing.

Just made this in a pinch (we were out of canned cream corn) I used 3 large can's of corn & 1/2 & 12 & adjusted the flour at the end to thicken when it was at a boil.. Came out PERFECT! My shopping snapfu might have been a good thing ~this was so easy, I might have to make homemade for now on! :) Thanks for sharing this recipe! 5 STARS!

Very good! I used ½ cup of buttermilk and ½ cup of heavy cream to avoid too much liquid and runniness. I brought the pot of corn to a full boil then lowered it to medium heat before I stirred everything else in. I only added 1T of sugar since I did not really want it too sugary. I seasoned lightly with Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper and added fresh grated parmesan cheese at the end. The corn had really a nice taste, was creamy enough with just the right liquid consistency. This was easy to make and took me a few minutes to prepare. This was a nice change to plain boiled corn. Next time I would definitely use fresh corn on the cob in place of frozen. I served this with rice and, “Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks,” and “Asparagus with Parmesan Crust, “also from this site.

I feel sorry for you if you pass up this recipe!  From the first time I made it it was the star on the table! Now whenever we have company, it's a staple.  Those that have had it ask for it again.  The first time I made it I couldn't find heavy cream so I used whipping cream instead. It worked so well I'm afraid to switch back!  It has a tendency to be a little soupy for my taste, but you could remove some of the liquid when serving or let it cook down a bit more.  I usually have all my burners working so I put mine in the oven.  This is truly a five star dish!

This is good, but rich. But really you can control how much cream, sugar, etc you put it in. You don't need to follow this recipe exactly. I put in a few handfuls of corn in a pan, some butter, and a little cream and let it get warm. Then I mixed a spoonful of flour and a little bit of milk and poured that in the corn mixture on the stove. Then I added more corn or more cream depending on how thick I wanted it. And I also put in just under a spoonful of sugar. 

Then I put it in a dish and put parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs over it and let it bake for about 2 minutes. 

And it's ready! Took me about 10 minutes.

Again - you don't need to follow this recipe exactly - it's not the type of recipe that things need to be measured. It's basically cream and corn and you decide the consistency you like it. 

Good luck!

Thank you for posting this yummy recipe!!! We loved it! I have never had homemade creamed corn and now I will never buy the canned stuff again. This is the best! So, easy and so good I couldn't stop eating it. I didn't have milk so, I used low fat evaporated milk. I'm going to make this every holiday from now on.

Huge hit at Christmas.  Loved it because it was quick and easy.  Used a family sized 28 oz bag of corn and used half and half instead of cream.  Turned out perfectly.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  This was the best cream corn I have ever had.  We had company for Sunday dinner and I served this to 7 people and there wasn't one person who didn't rave about this, including my picky 7 yr old and two teens...you know that's success!!  This is on our regular rotation from now on.  I only changed to white corn, and kept everything else as is and it shouldn't be messed with.

Absolutely excellent. I didn't have any idea how this would turn out, but it was fabulous. Do NOT forget to put in the parmesan cheese, that's what makes it so superb! I'm definitely, definitely going to make this as a (not very healthy!) side dish again because it is such a nice change from the regular side dishes.

DH gave me very short notice one evening, that he needed a dish for the potluck at work the next day.  So I found this recipe, and have been making it ever since.  My friends ask for it every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  One even phoned me from her vacation cabin for the recipe.

I play around with the spices a bit (always using Penzey's Spices), depending on what my main course is.  I add jalapeno powder to make a great side dish for chicken enchiladas!  My favorite add in is Penzey's Fox Point seasoning instead of just salt. 

Otherwise, the only other thing I do differently is to use 2 cups of half & half (instead of cream and milk), and just whisk corn starch (no gluten for me) in from the beginning.  I've never had it turn out soupy.  And if it did, I'd just add more corn starch.

This was delicious and the whole family loved it.  Someone eating with us said it tastes like some creamed corn from a famous BBQ place in Texas.  I skipped the parmesan and didn't miss it.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  Everyone loved it.  Left out the butter (I just forgot) and used half and half and 1% milk.  It was still really rich, I just had to cook it longer for it to thicken up.

Generally,my theory on cooking is this: the more fattening it is, the better it tastes. I don't make this kind of food often, so I went full throttle. Heavy cream, real butter, extra parmesian cheese. Frozen corn was on sale, only a dollar a bag, so I used two 16 ounce bags. Added more cream, less milk, more cheese. Garnished with cracked black pepper and butter. Good thing I don't eat like this all the time. It was delish! Great choice for an indulgent holiday side.

I just made this recipe exactly as written.  I did turn the heat a little lower, so that it could thicken up slowly.  What an awesome recipe!  Anyone who complains had better check their technique or try a canned version.  Creamed corn IS corn in cream sauce......hence, the title.  My whole family loves it!  Thank you!

In a word...excellent! I don't know if anyone else mentioned this, but I used corn meal in place of flour. I never use raw flour. I'll make a roux first but was too lazy here. EXCELLENT. I have a new, unique side dish to bring to parties. THANKS

I decided to make this for Thanksgiving this year & I regret doing so without doing a trial taste test first! I cannot explain the taste but no one liked it and we ended up giving it to the stray cats outside! It wasn't a bad flavor, just weird.. Maybe it was the parmesan cheese, or the sugar..? I followed this recipe word for word not adding or adjusting at all. If you do choose to try this recipe and are making it to have company I highly recommend trying it before the big day!! Sorry, won't be making it again.

Amazing recipe!  I have a ton of frozen sweet corn in the freezer and need new ways to prepare it; the same 'ol corn gets old!  I am one of the many who does not like creamed corn at all, but I found myself curious while making this (for my boyfriend and his finicky father).... the taste was INCREDIBLE!!  The only thing I changed is I did 1/2 whole milk plus 1/2 1% milk because I didn't have any whole milk.  And... while tasting it along the way, I didn't even bother throwing in the parmesan.  It was so good, I didn't think it could get any better!  I will try it the next time I prepare it though just to see!  It MAY be a bit sweet for some tastes (depending on the the natural sweetness of the corn you have), so perhaps add the sugar gradually along the way to make it to your liking.  My boyfriend lit up when he took the first bite and raved incessently about it.  His Dad couldn't say too much because he was too busy eating it!   A total hit and a new staple in my recipe book!

Hubby and I both enjoyed this.  He likes canned cream corn, but was quite impressed with this.  I used half and half  and skim milk for the whole milk, since that was what I had.  Thanks for an interesting new side dish.

This was delicious!  I used a crock pot instead.  I mixed everything but the milk and flour and let it slow cook on low for about 3 hours.  Then the last 2 hours I added the milk and flour.  It was the hit of Easter meal!

This was fantactic, I served it at Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. My family is begging me to make it at Christmas. This recipe is quick and easy it can be all the time. I did use a little less cream and a little more flour, it turned out great.

I've made this recipe about 10 times now and every dinner/potluck/party, that I've brought this to, everyone raves about it! I'm definitely not an experienced chef, but this was extremely easy. I kept all the ingredients the same, but the only thing that I changed, was that I melted/softened the butter before adding the ingredients into the skillet. YUMMY!

This was very good! I rated this a four only because I had to double the amount of corn the recipe called for and thank god I had enough corn. I used fresh corn off the cob to create it and  measured out 20 oz ( 1-1/4#) of corn but when all was said and done I needed 9 cobs to cover the cream. I doubled the butter just cuz and used the heavy cream the recipe calls for Thanks for this one.....Flavor was awesome and my kids loved it!

I hate you. This is so good, it should replace cold water in my kitchen sink tap. All I need is HOT and CREAMED CORN. Cold I can get from a bottle. I have now made this twice. I wouldn't change a thing. The amount of cheese is so subtle it just adds dimension, nothing heavy-handed, and I'd miss it without. Everyone absolutely raved, and I modified it (unnecessarily but happily) by using all Half & Half simply because I didn't need any leftover heavy cream or whole milk tempting me, and a pint of the combo fit the bill perfectly (one cup in per your instructions, one cup mixed with the flour and then added); it didn't affect it a bit. I also used an immersion blender to puree it by about a third, so it took on a yellow tint and had a more homogenized feel than with just the whole kernels. THANK YOU.

Here's my easier recipe: Cook a 16 oz bag of frozen white corn, drain & return to pot, add about 3 Tbsp real butter, 1/2 tsp salt, a few shakes of pepper & just enough milk to not quite cover the corn. Bring to a boil. While reheating mix a rounded Tbsp of cornstarch with 1/4 C milk. When corn mixture comes to a boil dribble in cornstarch mixture, a little bit at a time while stirring constantly until desired thickness is reached. Simmer for about a minute to cook starch. Taste & add more salt if needed. Enjoy.

This was the first time for me to make cream corn. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner. This is absolutely delicious! My husband loved it as well. 

 I did not have heavy cream, so I used half and half (I read from the review that someone had done it). I would like to try it with heavy cream as well, next time.

 Will surely make it again and again and again. No reason to look for another recipe. 
Thank you so much for sharing it with us!

DELISH!!!! I didn't have the heavy cream so I used regular whole milk and thickened with corn starch instead of flour. I used the Pictsweet brand of white shoepeg corn and also left out the sugar. My husband is very picky about creamed corn and will not eat it if it has even a hint of sweetness. He said that he's looking forward to tomorrow now so he can eat it. It is a hit in our house.

I just made this exactly how the recipe describes except I used a can of corn instead of using the frozen. I also halfed the ingredients as I was just making this for my husband's grandparents. I also skipped on the parm as it tasted so good already. Oh My goodness, grandpa loves it! He is a die hard Missourian, and loves this type of cooking. This was very easy and simple to make and I will be making this many more times in the future.

I literally just finished making this dish and I must say, great flavor! I was making this in hopes that it would taste similar to the one my grandmother used to make when I was a kid. She passed away a few short weeks ago and I never got the recipe from her. This was wonderful.   A few things I ran out of in the house and so I used half and half for both the milk and the heavy cream, and it worked out just fine. Also, oddly enough I had used the last of my flour with all the baking I did today so I used buttermilk pancake mix instead of the flour and it thickened up just great. I will make sure to get some more flour for next round! :) Great recipe!!

Soooooo soooooo good!  A couple of differences I did was use fresh corn and cut it off the cob.  I did a half batch and three corn cobs worked perfectly for the dish.  I also used skim milk, other then that everything else was as called for in the recipe.  It was amazing and everyone loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

I think this is my first and only review, but I had to come on here and warn people: if you try this recipe, you'll have to go to confession for enjoying something so pleasurable that it's a SIN!  It tasted so wonderful before I added the cheese that I couldn't believe the cheese could improve it. Indeed, after tasting both ways, I suggest omitting the cheese--to preserve the spectacular sweet flavor. If you want to make this a cheese dish, then cheese it up with more than this dab of cheese and call it a cheese dish. And if you add a lot of cheese of some sort, maybe you could get by with skim milk instead of cream (?) to mitigate the whopping blast of fats. But I digress.  The only departure I took from this recipe was to use almond milk instead of cow's milk (original, not flavored). Since discovering almond milk, we've almost entirely quit using dairy milk, and we find the almond milk works just fine in most recipes. (If you hate the taste of soy milk, like us, then discover the great, sweet taste of creamy almond milk! Get the "original," not the vanilla.)

This is delicious!  I used evaporated milk for flavor, and 2% milk to help reduce fat content, but let me tell you it was still awesome!  My husband and my daughter couldn't get enough!  My daughter gave me "strict instructions" that I was to make this for Thanksgiving dinner!

I didn't have any heavy cream on hand. Instead, I substituted 1/3 cup melted butter and 3/4 cup milk for 1 cup heavy cream. Tasted amazing! Thanks for the recipe.

This has become a holiday tradition in our family. Even those who say they don't like creamed corn end up loving this! 
Just make sure to cook it with low-medium heat and it'll be perfect.

This was really good.  I made it for Christmas.  My husband couldn't figure out why I was going to have creamed corn....neither of us like the stuff in a can.  But when I told him I was making it he changed his tune.  Thank you Suemck for the recommendation.  And thanks Diana for the recipe....I am sure I will make it again.

Hello everyone You have to try this cream corn. I love it ! I love it This is so good. I had stop buying the kind in the can because to me it just doesn't taste as good as it did when I was growing up. But now I have this cream corn recipe and I love it and 1 more thing I have also tried this with some shrimp in it and I gave it to my guess as a shrimp corn soup and talk about good all you have to do is do the cream corn and drop your shrimp right before you add the flour and let it cook on low fire . so good hey if anybody try's it let me know what you think. Thanks Terry

Yummy!  This is the best creamed corn I have ever had.  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings, and omitted the Parm.  I added about 2 extra ounces of corn, and doubled the cooking time to get it really thick.  My fiance said he won't eat corn any other way now!

I used this recipe for Christmas dinner.  It was so good!  I did add extra corn as some other reviewers suggested.  I didn't really pay attention to the time it took because I assembled everything beforehand and refrigerated it until I was ready for it.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

This was simply great.  My kind of recipe--easy to fix AND yummy!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I didn't have any problems with it thickening like a few have stated.  I can't imagine going back to canned cream corn.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I made this with Christmas dinner...I should'nt have made any other food...This was the biggest HIT...my family keeps asking me to make it for every meal.   Absolutely fantastic.
I used an already shredded cheese combo from the grocery store of provolone, mozzarella, asiago, and parmesan...made it even creamier.

This is just wonderful.  I made it for Thanksgiving, followed the recipe exactly except I used a family-size (28 oz.) frozen corn.  It served 12, and all want it again for Christmas.  Great recipe!

Excellent recipe!  This was my first time ever making homemade creamed corn and I aced it!  I used 3 ears of fresh corn (cut off of the cob) and used whipping cream since that's all I had.  Will definitely make this again and again!

Best corn in the history of ever!!!  I melted one tablespoon of butter and sauteed about 1/2 a cup of minced onions then proceeded with recipe as written but I halved it.  I realized it was going to be too soupy so I added 2/3 cup of corn more and the result was to die for corn.  I did use the full amount of parmesan because a little extra parm never hurt anything.

Awesome.  I cooked over medium-high heat, stirring constantly to get it to thicken.  I added a bit more sugar.  Grated Parmesan cheese is a must.  So, so good.

I cook from my cupboard and fridge whenever I can.I cook fresh. I can all my own veg. Never thought I'd ever try a creamed corn recipe until I found this one. I use it whenever I can. This is the one of the only recipes I've never "tweaked" from this site. Perfect.

I had high expectations due to the high ratings, but I was not impressed.  Nor was my family; nobody ate the leftovers. I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it might be something like the "fried corn" my mom makes, but it isn't. Using fresh corn would probably make it much better.

I'm so glad I made this. My husband doesn't eat corn on the cob and I wanted something different than plain corn, he suggested cream corn and I, wanting to be a made from scratch turkey day pro, wasn't doing the canned thing. This is SOOOOOO good, I followed the directions and added a bit of pepper to taste, wow, best creamed corn I've ever tasted, never buying the canned stuff again

**WOW!** This was just what I was looking for yet far exceeded my expectations. Totally divine! I didn't measure a thing since I had 16 ounces of corn, but I used everything the recipe called for except I used whole buttermilk in place of regular milk. I brought it to a boil instead of medium heat because my cream portion was a little thinner than I'd like at first. This recipe doesn't need a single thing added. I served it with parmesan-breaded tilapia and English peas. My veggie-snubbing husband had seconds, and that's a guy who will spend 15 minutes picking every shred of vegetable from his food. Will make again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Great cream corn recipe.  To make it healthier I used half & half and reduced the amount since it's thinner than heavy cream.  Turned out great.  A keeper.

Absolutely fantastic!!!  Like other comments I too will NEVER buy canned cream corn again!  The only things I did different was add more corn, mashed them a little and not add cheese.  The little we had left I put in a freezer bag to see if it froze well and it did!  So next time I make it I will double it up and frreze it to have it on hand.  Its a keeper for sure!

I am very picky when it comes to corn but I can honestly say...I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. The entire family really loved it. My daughter and I had two helpings...my husband had a giant helping plus several mini bowls while waiting for dinner to be placed on the plates. A definite addition to my recipe book and a permanent addition for many dinners to come. I used just a smidge less milk..3/4 of a cup...wanted to make sure it wouldn't have too much liquid. Turned out perfect...love it!!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  :)

Everything the reviews said was true!  I made this for an office Christmas party, I thought it would be good, but thought some of the reviews were overrated, it's only corn afterall - but it was truly the hit of the party, and everyone wants the recipe!!   I did top it with a thin layer of parmesan, then browned it in the oven, fantastic!!

AMAZING! I work at an upscale restaurant and we have this on our menu with a bone in porterhouse pork. The only thing different is that we add applewood smoked bacon. Its to die for! I did cut the sugar to 1.5 tbls bc I'm not big on sweet things. Its so yummy!

I'm always suprised at how delicious this turns out. Tastes better than anything I ever had when I lived in the Southwest and now that I live in England - it blows my in-laws minds! A Thanksgiving staple!

The recipe was so easy to follow. The only change I made was that I used cornstarch instead of flour and I used half and half instead of whipping cream since that was all I had.  Everyone loved it, definitely a keeper!

OH MY GOODNESS!  This is awesome!  I used 1/2 & 1/2 in place of both the cream and whole milk because that's all I had, and left out the parmesan cheese because I didn't have any, but I can't see how this can taste any better.  So delicious!

I was cutting the kernels off 38 ears of bicolor corn to put in the freezer and wanted to have some for lunch, but wanted something different than just heated with butter and s&p.  So I tried this recipe.  It was yummy!  I don't know how much actual corn I used but it was probably more than called for.  Other than that I followed the recipe except for using ff half and half for the heavy cream.  This will be good in the cold weather when I pull that corn out of the freezer to have and want to try something different.  Thanks!

Excellent Taste!  I used the heavy cream as called for and then used fat free milk as that was all I had on hand.  It was rich and creamy and my husband loved it! Recommend it highly! Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, I used whole milk instead of the cream and it was still very good.  I also used frozen sweet corn from my garden last summer instead of store bought and it was delicious.

This creamed corn was definitely a crowd pleaser. I followed the directions directly as stated and it was great. There are no leftovers but quite a few requests to make it again soon. Thanks.

First time making creamed corn and OMG!  Why did I ever eat the stuff out of the can?????  This was fantastic!  I wanted to use fresh corn since it's in season but didn't have the time, I think that would make it even more phenomenal.  Used half and half rather than heavy cream and 2% milk in place of whole, but other than that did everything the same.  I was unsure of the cheese but I added it and it was perfect, it didn't overwhelm the dish but just added a little oomph to it.

Quick and easy just as advertised. Used fresh corn since now is the time for it here in Ohio and this had a great fresh corn flavor to it. Left out the Parmesan as we were using this in another recipe but would recommend it if this is to be a stand alone dish as there did seem to be something missing.

Reading that this was close to the cream corn from Rudy's BBQ in Texas very excited to try..however, only one at home that loves cream corn..when our cul-de-sac had a get together decided to finally try it.  Wow! loved it and so did the neighbors even my other half..amazing..did add little more corn and cheese to thicken.

Yummy!!  Added about 1 extra cup of corn to reduce the liquid a little.  Also added 1/2 of a finely chopped green bell pepper sauteed in 2 tablespoons butter to give it a little color.  Would also be good with a can of green chiles and a dash of cayenne for a mexican twist.  Will make again SOON!

I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner in lieu of my husband's mother's authentic creamed corn scraped from the cob.  Even though it isn't in the same category "Grammy's" creamed corn, it was still a huge hit.  We will definitely make this again.

Wow! The trick here is to not eat the whole pot when it's done. I thought "how different can it really be?" But it had such great reviews, so I tried it and it is AWESOME!! The only thing I changed was to use canned corn kernels - that's all I had - and I put in 3 cans of them. I wasn't sure about the parmesan, but it added to it so much that I added just a little extra. A real keeper! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very easy and Mmmm Mmmm good! My husband and son love it. The only change I made was I added crumbled bacon which gives it great flavor.

I made this for Thanksgiving -- such an impressive addition (everyone thought I had gone all out).  But so simple!  And my 92 year old grandmother said it was just like the creamed corn her mother used to make -- she asked for the recipe!  Just a hint -- you can use half and half in place of the milk and cream since the recipe calls for equal amount of each.  Also, watch out for scorching -- I caught mine just in time.  Great recipe -- thanks so much for sharing!

Made this to go in a recipe that called for cream corn when I was out and didn't feel like going to the store (just not worth loading the kiddos up to go to the store for one thing!)  I tasted some before I added it to the recipe and thought it was great.  I'll be sure to make it as a side sometime.

A family member requested creamed corn for Christmas dinner. I chose this recipe, and I must say it was a huge hit. I am personally not a fan of creamed corn, and I loved this! In fact, I'm writing this the day after Christmas, and I was just asked "Is there not any more of this?". I will definitely make this again! This will be a family favorite for sure.

Mmmm... I was trying to find a good replacement for the creamed corn at Three Forks Steak House.  I'll just add some ground sage next time and see how it tastes. Regardless, I'll be making this again.

I don't care for cream corn, but this recipe is delicious!  I was eating it before I even got it to the table.  I am never again going to have canned cream corn.  Thank you!  
added 8/2/07: I gave this recipe to my family and they have all raved about it!  I think some of them make it at least 1x/week!

You are so right! This cream corn IS like no other! This is decadent! I didn't think it would be as thick as I like it, so at the very end I sprinkled some corn starch on top, but I'm really not sure that I needed it. I didn't change a thing about this recipe (as I usually do) and I can't tell you how much I love it. Not something that you serve every day, as the calorie and fat content is astronomical, but for a treat, this is divine.

This was better than III Forks until I added the cheese.  Then it had too much of an alfredo taste.  Leave out the cheese and it's 10 stars. Try it with corn cut off the cob, frozen tends to be a bit rubbery.

This corn was fantastic!  It was super easy to make, and very tasty.  I did add a lot more pepper than it called for, and also added Lawry's Seasoned Salt for flavor.  Based on other reviewers I cut the sugar in half and that was perfect.  Thanks for a keeper!

I halved this recipe and used half & half instead of cream, b/c it was all I had and left out P. cheese, and this was great...it was just like some old country cookin'.  Next time I think I might blend up the corn a little before cooking, to make it more like creamed corn.  I will use cream instead of half & half...it was good with it, but I am sure it will be better with the cream.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Mmmm, delicious, this is so rich and creamy. I don't consider canned creamed corn real food, since it's just a can of mush. This is REAL creamed corn. I simmered it gently for quite awhile till it thickened to my liking. I followed the recipe exactly, EXCEPT I left out the parmesan. I love parmesan cheese, but not in creamed corn.

This dish is wonderful!  I made it the night before we took our RV out to the desert.  It was easy enough to prepare for this kind of trip, and it went great with grilled chicken and rolls.  While the Mister was grilling, I warmed the corn.  So great -- and a super alternative to the same ol' side stuff while in the great outdoors!

Excellent recipe. Really tasted homemade like your grandmother used to make. I served when we had guests for New Years dinner and they all loved it. Very easy to prepare. I doubled batch, added just a taste of butter, but next time would cut back just a smidgen on the flour as I think I could detect the taste. Might of been just me, no one else mentioned it. Either way it is very good. Hundred times better than canned creamed corn.

My family had never eaten true "creamed corn" before, and are NOT fans of the canned stuff, but this is absolutely fantasic.  I made it as a side dish for Christmas dinner, and it went over great!  It's very rich and creamy, just perfect for a cold winter day or a special dinner.  We will definitely be enjoying it again at my house.

This is one of the best corn dishes I have ever made.  I have made it five times.  I found that you can increase the amount of corn in the recipe.  I like 30 oz instead of 20 oz.

Truly decadent creamed corn. My 14 Christmas Dinner guests, including the kids, all had seconds. It was a hit.

Really liked this recipe.  It wasn't too sweet but had just the right amount of sugar.  I scaled this recipe up to 24 servings and it still turned out great.

It was really good but VERY rich.   I made it for a Thanksgiving dinner party with my friends and everyone really seemed to like it, even people who thought that they wouldn't like creamed corn and just tried it to be polite.  I wouldn't make it all the time though, my waistline couldn't handle it.

This was the best cream corn any of us ever tasted. Made it for Thanksgiving and it went fast. Didn't change a thing and wouldn't want to.

Good and easy recipe. I've never made cream corn so I have nothing to compare it to other then canned cream corn. However,  everyone liked it.  Not a lot of comments but noticed the kids taking 2nds.  Taking 2nds means a lot at our house!

Excellent, excellent!  This was an easy and great corn dish.  I added a little extra sugar and used sweet corn, it was great! I will definately be making this again and again.

Delicious!  I have never eaten cream corn from a can (cooked with it, but never eaten it straight), so I cant compare this recipe to the canned variety.  However,  I can't imagine that anything from a can could taste this good.  Half a recipe was enough for my husband, preschooler and me with leftovers.  It is rich and not very easy on the waistline, so I'll save the recipe for holidays or special occasions.  Can't wait thil the next one rolls around just to make this again!

I did not have any parmesan cheese so I left that out and this was by far the best cream corn ever.  It tastes just like a bbq restaurant's here in Texas.  If your corn is coming out "soupy" you didn't cook it long enough.  Continue to cook it until your desired thickness.  I did not time mine but I'd say I cokked it for 30 min.

I can't imagine why someone would rate this other than a 5 star!  This is very, very good and the grated fresh Parmesan cheese (I used Parmigiano Reggiano) really adds a great flavor.  This is a keeper for sure.

How could you NOT give this 5 stars? My family really liked this one! I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed! Make sure you use FROZEN corn and not canned - it has a tighter texture that way.  And the heavy cream and whole milk are the ticket.  Since it is so rich, you can eat a smaller amount and be very satisfied. I will be making this again very soon! Good post!

I love creamed corn (especially TRUE creamed corn), but this is really just corn in a heavy cream sauce.  We didn't really care for it -- it's too much fat and calories for the end result.

if you add sauteed onions, bell peppers in butter you'd end up with what we call corn marque choux. (pronounced mock shoe) Sometimes folks add crumbled sausage, some add tomatoes.

Made this for Friendsgiving yesterday and people were raving about it. Several said it was the best they ever had. I made 2 small changes. I used 3/4 roasted corn from Trader Joes which gave it a another depth of flavor. I also added 2 garlic cloves minced. Oh, and i started with a roux before adding everything else and letting it thicken. Will make this every year now!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner this weekend and it was the star of the show. I had homemade rolls, stuffing, a perfectly cooked bird, three homemade pies. . . and everyone raved about the creamed corn! 

Easy peasy and sure to please the crowd. Offer to make it next time you're invited somewhere and you'll get a free ride to being the star chef!

This is perfect for any occasion!!!! I did change is up but not by much.  I fried the corn in the butter just enough to add flavor to the corn.  While it was frying, I added the salt, pepper and sugar to merge the flavors. Just finish it as shown.  I have made this for several occasions, keeps well in a crock pot and I never come home with left over corn.   I did find it a tad runny but that is an easy fix with gauging the amount of milk and the length of cooking time.

My whole family really liked this. I followed the recipe to a T except I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and added a little bit more corn.  I will for sure make this again.

This recipe is fast, easy & super delicious.  There are never leftovers.  I make the recipe as is.  This is actually better than Rudy's which I visit every trip to Texas.

I have made this recipe a 2-3 times for a few lunches at work and everyone enjoyed it. It sure beats the canned stuff. The recipe was easy to follow and came out great.

After a trip to Nashville I I was searching for a recipe similar to the delicious corn we ate at the Loveless Cafe. 
This recipe was not exactly the same, but we all loved it. Even my daughter who doesn't usually eat corn!

Tweaked a little by adding fresh corn.  Yummy!!!  Doubled it and used 6 tbpn of smart balance, and since I ran out of cream used whole milk and it still made it creamy and delicious.

Pure deliciousness! I've made this recipe several times, with minor adjustments - no need to follow measurements exactly.  Tastes best with homegrown corn, but is good with frozen corn as well.

Everyone loves this corn! I kick it up a notch and use the spicy blend white cheese. This will be a staple from now on for thanksgiving and Christmas.

My 13 y.o. niece picked out this recipe.  We've made it twice now and the family loves it!  One word of warning--it has turned out too salty for us both times.  Next time, we're going to try it without any added salt and see how it turns out.  Maybe it's the parmesan we're using...

I love this recipe. Anyone who changes it changes it to suit their own personal pallate and not because there is something to be tweaked with the recipe. I love garlic and fresh herbs. I use a grinder combination of seasalt and garlic and I add fresh mint. Does it make the recipe better? The recipe is perfect as it is. The only change is for personal preferances. Add, subtract, do without. This recipe is easy and perfect for any cook; novice or pro. I just love. PS--I always add extra parmesan. It is just my pallate and not the recipe. Kudos. I will never eat creamed corn from a can again. Thank you for sharing the perfect recipe.

This turned out fantastic.  It tasted great before I put the Parm. cheese.  And it still tasted great after adding the cheese.  I took this to a Thanksgiving potluck and the cream corn was gone by the end of our meal.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

Was desperately looking for a last minute corn recipe for thanksgiving. This was fantastically simple, great flavor, nothing like the image of mushy creamed corn "pudding" you're used to. It's more like corn with a cream sauce. I don't like the blended yuck kind anyway so if that's what you're hunting for this isn't it. 

The cheese gave it just enough extra to stand out. Followed the recipe exact except i had to use a cream substitute of milk and butter (3/4 milk 1/4 butter melted drizzled into milk while whipping) because i didn't have any cream. I'd used golden and white corn which gave it nice color and dimension. Not a fan of creamed corn before, but i love this and my family liked it too. It might come off slightly bland but the flavors kinda kick around on your tongue in layers after you first put it in your mouth (ooh there's a little sweetness! Oh the parm is tangy! Mmm the butter! Ahh the crisp sweet corn... And swallow, repeat) it's a good offset to balance a very savory meal.

I almost doubled the amount of corn this recipe calls for- to two 16 oz pkgs- and it was perfect. Great flavor but too soupy without the extra corn.

I made this on a camping trip as a side to our fish fry for 20 ppl. I multiplied the recipe but they wanted to lick the pan! I've also added a few sliced jalepenos before to give it a kick....also a great way to serve it.

I made this for my BF's birthday dinner the other night to go with his favorite fried fish. He didn't say much but he finished what was on his plate and went back into the kitchen. A minute later he returned with a SOUP BOWL full of this creamed corn! He was still talking about it the next day. The only change I made was to use fresh sweet corn cut off the cob. This recipe is magical! Thank you Diana!

Delicious homemade cream corn.  I found this recipe while trying to use up 1 cup of heavy cream - this was perfect.  To help make the corn not too runny, make sure you use thawed corn.  The next time I make this I might cut the milk back to 1/2 cup.  We had company for dinner the night I made this and everyone really enjoyed it.  I will be using this one again.

I hate creamed corn and I love THIS creamed corn.  We will be using this recipe for years to come.  The parmesan cheese makes the dish, even just the bit of it.  I made enough for 8; there were 3 of us.  No leftovers.

Just add me to the "truly like no other" group of reviewers. This has become a holiday staple, and we also count on it when we're asked to bring a vegetable to dinners we're invited to. No one we have served this to has been less than wowed.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe! Best Creamed corn we've ever had.  The first time I made it I forgot to add the Parm. cheese, and it was still a keeper! Thanks for sharing!!!

INCREDIBLE!  The best side dish I ever make.  I make it just as written except I leave out the parmesan, because it has such a great flavor without it.  And it's easy too.

This was very good! Much better then the can which I don't touch. But this recipe had everyone going for seconds. I followed advice of others and didn't add so much milk. I only added enough to get my flour mixture then added to the pan. If I thought I needed anymore milk after having it all mixed together then I added a little more as I saw needed.

Since I am not a fan of creamed corn I was pretty hesitant to try this, but the great reviews convinced me. So glad I tried it! it's delicious! I was always put off by the smell of creamed corn, but this smells wonderful, looks good and is very yummy!

Made this for the first time today for Christmas. My oldest daughter took the taste test and proclaimed it was awful and warned everybody that they shouldn't eat it. But not to worry SHE would make the sacrifice and eat it so as not to waste any. IT WAS AWESOME! I made no changes to the original.

I'm using some of the left overs to make a cornbread souffle - I'm sure it will be fantastic!

I did it with all lowfat milk.  I added a little bit of margarine to compensate for the heavy cream and it was fantastic!

We were really disappointed by this dish. There wasn't any flavor besides cream and sweetness. My boyfriend said it was like eating corn and drinking milk at the same time. That's pretty accurate.

This is the best cream corn recipe ever. I've been making it for years but because it makes such a large amount I usually only make it for the holidays. Along with putting Parmesan cheese inside the corn mixture, I also sprinkle some on the top and place it under the broiler until lightly bronwed. Huge crowd pleaser.

I have never had "from-scratch" cream corn, and this was amazing. I brought it to Thanksgiving dinner and it got rave reviews. I made it exactly as the recipe states, and wouldn't change a thing. I am definitely a cream-corn convert!

Whenever I mention having creamed corn most people expect that which comes in a can. I love the look on their fae when they taste THIS creamed corn. I love this stuff.  My recipe doesn't call for sugar, cream, flour or Parmesan cheese but does use a block of cream cheese. I can't wait to try this recipe.

Have used this recipe for three years now. Tastes just as good as the creamed corn from a famous BBQ restaurant here in Texas. We do not add the parmesan cheese.

This was so good, my 9 year old asked if that's all she could have for dinner.  This was the first time in 10 years I had creamed corn, 10 years ago it came out of a can... NEVER again.  Thanks!! This is a keeper.

Excellent Recipe! I used fresh corn, cut the tips off and scraped the milk out of the corn. I used all half and half instead of heavy cream and milk. I also used a slurry of cornstarch instead of flour.

Growing up I enjoyed Cope's Cream Corn.  This has become harder and harder to find.  This recipe is very good and a great alternative to the cream corn I am used to.  Very good recipe!

This is the best recipe I have found on cream corn. I make it and there is nothing left. I have had people say they hated cream corn and loved this one. I give it 5 Stars since I have been through about 50 different ways to make this and still the best.

I will never buy canned cream corn again!  This was amazing.  This will be my new corn recipe for the holidays.  Very simple!!!  Such a rich, creamy flavor. Kroger only had 12 oz frozen corn, and I'm actually glad because otherwise the liquid to corn ratio would have been a bit off.

We don't eat a lot of what I would call "southern food." That being said, we LOVED this! I used raw milk in place of the cream and 2 cans of corn instead of frozen. It was great! Thanks!

Very good cream corn. I halved the recipe, and omitted the sugar and cheese. I think in the future I'll use less milk, since it was a little watery so I compensated by adding more flour but it seemed a little too thick afterward.

Just made this and I am not sure what the fuss is about.  The cheese could not even be tasted.  There are way too many calories to make this on a regular basis.  It's back to the can!

Is it bad that my husband and I ate the entire pot at one sitting?!  This recipe is a keeper.  Usually my husband only eats cream corn that his grandmother makes.  Not anymore!  Followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful!

This recipe was not only wonderful tasting, it was so very easy to make.  We did add a little more corn just to make it a little less "creamy" and did not add the cheese.  It was incredible.  Thanks for a great recipe!

If I can give you any kind of advice, please try this recipe even if you don't like corn.  My husband was out of town so I decided to make this for myself. I scaled it down to 4 servings to go along side some fish, and I barely had enough leftover for one serving.  I had to stop myself from finishing the whole thing.  The only change I made was use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  I followed the recipe as indicated for the rest of the ingredients.  I think next time I might try to lightly grill some seasoned shrimp or scallops and just add them near the end to finish the cooking.  Long story short, this recipe deserves 50 stars!!

I made this recipe as it was written and it was delicious.  Easy and quick to make.  I used 2% milk instead of whole milk and I'm sure it didn't make much of a difference.  I will definitely be making this again.

I rated this recipe a three because I felt that it was a bit to salty.  I didn't care for it to much.  My finace rated it a four.  He liked it more than I.  This goes to show you that different people have different tastbuds.  Although, atleast I can say I tried it... thanks for the recipe...

Delicious! Everyone loved it. The only changes I made was adding a dash of Cayenne Pepper to offset the sweetness and using half and half instead of the cream and milk as a few other reviewers said. Was even good reheated the next day. Next time might try it without the cheese because it seems it would be just as good without it. Will never want creamed corn from a can again!

This is definitely the best cream of corn that I have ever had and I typically do not enjoy "cream-based" veggie dishes. The only modification that I would suggest to this recipe is to reduce the amount of sugar used by 1/2 otherwise this dish will be too sweet. I also second KellyTheChef's suggestion to make this recipe without Parmesan cheese. Other than the slight modifications I made, I followed this very easy recipe to a tee and enjoyed it with my main course of ribs!

Made this last night for the first time. My 13 year old daughter looked at it and said "homemade creamed Corn?" With a turned up nose. Guess who had seconds? Tonight when we had it for leftovers, along with Chicken Fried Steak, Parmesan Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans, she said that I should make more tomorrow. This will now be a staple at our house!

I used fat free half and half in place of cream and milk, and used parm cheese from the can.  It was still well liked!  I did add some extra flour to thicken (used a little whole wheat after the initial white)

This was great! I used all of the same ingredients, but made a roux with the butter and flour instead of whisking the flour with the milk. I also used half and half to replace both the milk and cream (since that's what half and half is and was what I had on hand). I read a review that said not to use sweet corn, but I did (frozen sweet white corn) and thought it was very good. I didn't bother to thaw the corn first, just threw it in with the half and half. Didn't use parmesan and still thought it was good--maybe up the salt a bit if you're not going to use parmesan. VERY rich, I could only have a small helping. But very good!

Probably won't be buying creamed corn again unless I am in a pitch for a quick can.  I loved this recipe and how creamy, thick, is was.  I ran out of flour during the recipe so I added around 1/2 c. of cornmeal and it thickened amazingly.

Really enjoyed this and my 4 year old that won’t eat any “creamy or saucy” foods even ate it. I do prefer more seasoning but overall was pretty good.

Cream corn is always ordered if it's available in the menu. Love cream corn but never make it. I try this recipe today and wow, it is the best over any restaurant. I read some of the good comments and all the one and two stars comments. Most of negative ones is on the runny cream sauce. I guess they all use frozen corn. There is always a certain amount of water added in frozen corn bag for microwave purpose. If they throw the entire frozen corn without thaw and drain, it certainly add some water into the original recipes and of course the sauce become running. I cook throughly the corn as directed in the package and then follow exactly the recipe. My cream corn is perfectly done in 10 minutes, and it is thick as it can be. Omit pam because it tastes so good already and i don't want to risk...LOL... Thanks the recipe author!

This recipe is fantastic! The best creamed corn I have ever had. My family now asks for it at every get together!! We do not add the parmesan cheese, due to preferences, but everything else I follow exactly. I have doubled it to serve about 15 people. There is never any left to take home!! 5 stars!!

It was good but too sweet I thought...I might try using it without the sugar. I am also going to try again in the summer with fresh corn, I think the store bought corn might have downgraded it a little.

I've made this a bunch of times and it is SO much better when I used fresh corn-- more crunch and body to the finished product. But it is still delicious with canned corn. SUCH a good, simple recipe.

We made this recipe for our High School's Nutrition class; it came out tremendously! The preparation time was spot on 15 minutes, and the ingredients were perfect. It was the class favorite and there were no left overs ;) The recipe is quite delicious, and we code named it CCLNO because it was to long to repeat every five minutes. To conclude this review, we suggest strongly to add this to your Thanksgiving Dinner or to your every day lunch.

I love creamed corn, but not the mangled-kernel kind that comes in a can. I tried this recipe because I liked that it didn't use cream cheese. I halved the recipe, since I am cooking for just two of us; and I used all whole milk, no cream, because that's what I had. I grated real Parmesan cheese, which I think makes a huge difference in flavor. After the corn had finished cooking, I ended up adding just over 1/2 t. sugar, and achieved near-perfection! 

I learned to make a creamed corn that starts with a sugar-butter roux; your recipe is way faster and easier, and is really delicious! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is delicious!  It turned out a bit more liquid-y than I expected, so we ate it in bowls.   I completely omitted the Parmesan, though.  (It just didn't seem like a taste combination that appealed to me.)  Adding the cheese might have made the dish less liquid-y.  I made this a couple of hours ahead of time and simmered in a crock pot.  I will definitely make it again!

This is really good.  Usually go for Gulliver's cream corn, or just settle for the canned.  This has the same ingredients as Gulliver's, but the prep is so easy that this is the way I'll do it from now on.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving and family ALWAYS ask me for the recipe. I don't think a year has passed since I started making it, that it wasn't requested that I bring the dish. Delicious. (I also add more parmesan than the recipe calls for (a cup more)and omit the salt for this reason)

Just made this because I needed cream corn for another dish. OMG!!!! This is great! I have 5 kids at home and they are wanting this for dinner by itself! But it will go great with my chicken I am having in a couple of days. Thank you so much I will never buy can cream corn again.

Everyone I've served this to can't help but say "wow!"  It's an awesome recipe--sweet and rich and yummy!  What I like about this versus canned creamed corn is that you can make it the exact consistency that you want.  If you like it saucy, cook for less time; if you don't want any runniness, just cook it longer.

I used a can of corn,1/3 cup half and half and 1/2 cup of milk. 1 T butter, mix flour with 1/2 cup of milk, add together and heat to a boil, then simmer for 20 min. This recipe is bomb!!!

Can't believe it took me this long to make cream corn!  Was so easy and delicious; I did used canned corn instead of frozen and omitted the parmesan cheese.

Oh my gosh AWESOME.  My seven year old daughter had hers gone before I even got to the table.  There's no turning back to canned now!  A new favorite that I'll definitely share.  Thank you.

I just made this as a test run for Christmas, but instead of butter I fried some bacon and cooked the corn in the bacon drippings.  I then added everything as the directions state, except left out the salt.  After it was all done I crumbled the bacon and mixed it in.  This was so good!!!!!

delicious! I didn't have cream so I used 1/2 the amount of whole milk in its place and added some flour, (without changing additional milk and flour). Turned out great!

Excellent recipe.  I used less corn than the recipe calls for because I was using leftover corn off the cob. I usually don't like cream corn but I think the Parmesan cheese put it over the top.

Excellent recipe, easy to cut in half or double. The only change is I used Asiago cheese. Much better melt factor and great flavor silky smooth. Definite keeper!

This was really good. I only had 16 oz of corn and I like a less runny texture so I cut all the ingredients in half. I had trouble with flour getting lumpy so I strained out the lumps and added a little cornstarch to the milk as well. Omitted Parmesan as I didn't have any and added some sliced green onions for color/flavor. Turned out delicious, my four year old and I ate almost the whole thing one sitting!

This was AMAZING!!!   Last night after dinner, my husband just kept saying "yum, yum, yum".  I used FF cream and milk, and did not add parmesan cheese - didn't need it.  Will try this with white corn, as well as peas.  Am going to share with friends this morning!

I made this last night and it was Wonderful!  I lightened it up a bit by using half & half instead of cream and 1% Milk instead of whole.  I served it over smashed new potatoes.   My husband loved it.

I'm not a creamed corn fan, but I had only tried the canned stuff. I needed creamed corn for Paula Deen's Corn Casserole, but I only had fresh on hand. This was delicious in the recipe and on its own. By the way, the Corn Casserole was really good with fresh corn; not sure I would have liked it with the canned it called for. Not sure I would have liked this recipe with frozen corn, as written. That said, it was quick, tasty and used on-hand ingredients, which is worth 5 stars to me.

This was excellent.  I usually make a cream corn dish in the slow cooker, but wanted a side dish that didn't need to cook for hours.  Very easy.  I would definitely make this again.

I made this tonight for supper, and it was so good!  I followed the recipe as written, and didn't have any trouble with it thickening as some.  I let it come to a boil, then simmered for about 10 minutes and it was perfect!  I will absolutely make this again!  Thanks for a great recipe.

It was alright.  Having made too much corn recipes  (AR's) with bolder taste, I consider this a lighter and safe version.

I made this for a friend's birthday barbeque, didn't even try it before I took it which was a little scary. Turns out creamed corn was the birthday girl's favorite and she loved it. I have had some homemade creamed corn but this is definitely like no other. Everyone at the party was raving about it and there was none left when the party ended!

Didn't have any parm. cheese on hand, so I had to leave that one ingredient out, but it tasted great without it.  Will add that next time and see which version we prefer.

we tried this tonight and I must say, we followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  My 11 yr old grandson was a little leery at first, but loved it once he gave it a try.  Thank you so much for the recipe, as I am just no a very creative person.

Yum!  I never eat cream corn, but made this for the family and it was great.  I think it would be just as good without the sugar, or you could used Splenda.  It tastes even better after it sits for a bit.  YUM!

I usually am not a corn eater but made this recipe as a side dish for Christmas dinner.  It was so good that there were no left overs.  It was easy to make and I will definitely make this again...over and over.  I did add more cheese which I think made it even better.

BIG hit at my house. First thing gone. I even used gluten free flour and it still turned out amazing. If you need to pre-make it only simmer for 1/2 the time, add a little extra milk, and pour into a baking pan and warm up for about 20 minutes at 350f. The extra milk keeps it from getting dried out.

This received the Anderson Family stamp of approval! OMG is was so yummy. I wanted to try it prior to Christmas and test it on my family. We live overseas and the only thing different was I used their equal to heavy cream (Crema de Leche). IT WAS WONDERFUL! My mom is here visiting and she wanted to know what I did. She said it was WAY better than the creme corn in the can that she grew up on!! AWESOME.

This is delicious! I left out the sugar, but I'm certain it would have been fantastic had it been included. I served this on Thanksgiving and all my guests agreed it was the best cream corn they had ever enjoyed. My husband was disappointed to learn there were no left-overs. My Mom commented, "I don't know how long the corn took you to make but however long it was, it was worth it!" Of course that's one of the great aspects of this recipe, it was so fast and easy but people will think you really slaved over this.

Beautifully good dish! Yum Oh! I made it exactly as written except I used shaved Parmesan cheese. I'm not sure if the Parmesan tamed any of the other flavors but I didn't taste the cheese so next time I'm not going to use it. You do have to make sure you cook long enough so it thickens. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner at my mom's house. After I cooked it, I transferred to my rice cooker and kept it hot throughout the Thanksgiving meal. Everyone loved it. We had a tiny bit left over and it was even better the second day (today!). Thanks so much for sharing. Will make it for the in-laws this Christmas.

Absolutely fabulous recipe!  I prefer to omit the flour and just use a stick blender to open up the natural thickeners in the corn.  If we're in the mood for really savory corn, we omit the sugar and add a bit of onion powder instead.  It gets rave reviews every time.

I hate cream style corn in a can. My husband loves it... so I found this recipe and I made it with and without the parmesan cheese and it is good either way. This recipe has become our favorite cream style corn. Thanks for the best cream corn recipe ever!

The most delicious cream sauce I have ever made. Followed the recipe to the 't' except I used 2 cans of corn.  I couldn't imagine frozen would make it any better. And I used regular kraft parm instead of the shredded.  I usually cream my peas and carrots but this sauce tops mine and I will use it for that now.  Thanks for the recipe - truly a sauce like no other!

YUM! I made this so I wouldn't have to used canned cream corn in a corn chowder recipe, but I'm not sure it'll make it into the soup. I did add a clove of garlic for a little extra flavor.

This is our family favorite now!  I have never even liked creamed corn (canned) but I LOVE this.  I have made it twice.  Did not add the parmesan cheese the 2nd time and actually it did not make much of a difference.

The Best Cream Corn Recipe EVER!!! 
I've made this for pot lucks, parties, and just for dinner, and I have never had leftovers. At my son's birthday party, I made a double batch, and i ended up having to make a 2nd double batch. 
Super super easy and always yummy!!!

Best creamed corn I've ever had. Love this! I'm a fan of creamed corn, so I've tried many canned, as well as homemade versions. I'd have to say, this one beats them all. It was really good and easy to make. Added a little cornstarch to thicken.

I halved the recipe and made a few changes..1. Used fresh corn cut off the cob 2. all skim milk instead of cream and whole, because that's all I had 3. Used 1/4 tub chive and onion cream cheese in place of parm. 

With these changes, it was SOOO yummy. My super picky kids wished I would've made a full recipe. I will NEVER buy creamed corn again, this is our family's creamed corn :-)

The only cream corn receipe I use now. I change slightly by adding more Parmesan cheese, a little grated Velveta cheese, and some grated nutmeg.

Good but too sweet with the type of corn that we have here, therefore, I make mine without the added sugar. I also like to cook the flour first with 1 Tbs of olive oil (substituting for the butter). Use 1/2 cup skim milk instead of a cup of whole milk and 2/3 cup of cream instead of 1 cup.

This was pretty good though definitely not like real cream corn.  I think next time I'll cut back on the liquid as it seemed to be too much for my taste.

This was amazing!! I had my husband finish cooking it because our baby was crying, and he wasn't too sure of it...but he loved it!!! I substituted evaporated milk because I didn't have cream. Really good.

This is a very versatile recipe. Thanks for sharing. It is currently on my stove. I followed the recipe as it is, added a little green beans and topped with bacon pieces. Very delectable. Nice warm dinner for this  mid-march chilly evening.

I am addicted to this! It's so good. I follow it exactly and my family LOVES it. I tried the Gulliver's on this site but my husband didn't like it, this one he said was the best. I'm making it again for the 5th time on New Year

I have never had anything other than canned creamed corn, and despise it!  I always cringe when my husband asks for it.  This year, for our "nothing but home-made" Thanksgiving dinner, I gave this recipe a shot because the hubby likes creamed corn so much.  I must say, I have never tasted anything like it.  I loved it, and will NEVER serve canned creamed corn again!  The whole family family loved it, including my super-finicky 5 year old who doesn't eat anything but PB&J's!

I call this Gulliver's corn after a favorite restaurant in southern California. I add a little more sugar, a pinch of white pepper and I bake the corn in a casserole dish without a cover after assembly to create a crust on top with the Parmesan cheese. Always a family favorite at every holiday meal.

omg. this is not low fat. and it is sooooo good! i don't think i'll be able to finish my bowl tonight. very rich... i might try making it again with only reduced fat milk and butter, and maybe cream cheese to add more creaminess... also i added shredded mixed cheese coz i didn't have any good parmesan. anyway this is awesome!

I have Thanksgiving every year at my place and invite at least 10 or more people. As I live in Munich, Germany this is usually the first Thanksgiving that my guests have ever experienced. Of course everyone is amazed by the shear size of the turkey but in the end they all ask for the recipe for the creamed corn! This recipe is fantastic...and German approved!

I have made this recipe numerous times and it has ALWAYS received rave reviews.  The kids at Thanksgiving loved it and ate it more than anything else.  I have also added diced fresh jalapenos to this dish.

HOLYCOW! I LOVE THIS RECIPE Just made it with some chicken schnitzel. Used half n half instead of cream, and skim milk instead of whole milk and  more tbsp of flour.  It was GREAT and I don't think it mattered a bit that I didn't use the full fat ingred.  Not that I saved any fat grams or calories as I had about 3 servings or more! I stirred the corn often over lower heat while I was making the schnitzel and because the cooking time was much longer (due to the fact that I was over the stove anyway), I think the corn had a softer texture. SOOOO GOOD...getting ready to tell everyone I know!

Perfect! I did use fresh corn that I cut off the cob, but other than that, I made no changes. That is what you call SOUTHERN COMFORT food!

This is AWESOME!  I never ate canned creamed corn...it was gross in my opinion, but my husband loves it.  So, I tried this receipe for him and I even love it (and now he won't eat the canned stuff)!  I like to experiment a lot so I added an 8 oz block of cream cheese to my cream sauce and it is even better!  My whole family always requests me to bring this dish to family dinners around the holidays!  I like it best with the Bird's Eye Super Sweet corn or Schwan's Sweet Corn (both frozen).  Thank you Diana Yockey for this great recipe!

OMG! This is fantastic.  I needed creamed corn for a  cornbread recipe and had none in the house.  Came here and found this delicious corn recipe.  Actually it is too good to put into the cornbread but I will never by another can again.  I made half the recipe and didn't put in the cheese as I was using cheddar for the cornbread.  I had some left over and ate it right out of the saucepan!

Followed the recipe exactly, the only change I was forced to make was that my friend ran out of sugar so I used maple flavoured syrup instead and it tasted very good.

I will never eat canned cream corn again! This was the first time I tried to make creamed corn and it came out sooo good! Instead of using frozen corn I used fresh corn off the cob. Everyone was looking for seconds! Gonna have to make a double batch next time! Thanks for the great recipe :D

Many guests plus my husband, all of whom claimed they HATE cream corn, LOVED this! I got rave reviews on this recipe, made exactly as written.  I love that you can use a slurry instead of a roux for this! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!! Note:  this also "keeps" very well in a slow cooker if you need to make it ahead.

I made this recipe for the first time today for our Thanksgiving meal and it was a huge hit! I did used Asiago Cheese instead of the Parmesan Cheese plus I added a little more than 1/4 cup of the Asiago Cheese, and used Half & Half instead of the whole milk. Even with using canned corn AND preparing 1-1/2 times the amount of the recipe (for 7 adults!) I only had 1 cup left over at the end of the day. I would say it was a hit! VERY easy to make & tastes great!

I've made this several times and it is always a hit.  Sometimes I grate the frozen corn in the food processor first.  I always put it in a slow cooker for a few hours to keep warm while I prepare other food, and that makes this dish firm up quite nicely.

OMG!!! You have no idea how great this Cream Corn recipe is! For years it has been a Holiday Family Tradition. I make it for about 50 people and keep it hot in the crock pot. Oh yeah....and my co-workers request it all the time. :-)

Very good recipe. I was looking for a different type of corn dish for Thanksgiving, other than the normal, plain corn. I made it exactly how the recipe describes, except I used fat free milk instead of whole milk and it turned out fine. Also if you are lactose intolerant watch out because my sister's stomach hurt after eating this. But me - I was fine.

Made a few adjustments: Less cream sauce, and pureed half of the corn in a blender along with 1/4 cup sauce, and seemed to turn out real nice. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was very good. I give it only four stars because I did add a bit more salt and a lot more sugar. I was looking for a very sweet taste. It pleased almost the whole family. My daughter doesn't like the look of it even though I think she did like the very small bite I got her to try, she is still refusing to eat it.   Will be making again!

I just took this to a family reunion Sunday. It was a complete hit!! EVERYONE went crazy over it. The only thing I did different was to use 48 oz of corn, instead of 40. (I had doubled the recipe) I simply wanted to use the rest of the bag. All the cooks wanted the recipe. I did not have a bit to bring home, as they kept coming back for it, like they usually do the desserts!! **LOL** I put it in a small crock pot to keep it warm and tasty, and it kept perfectly. Truly a keeper. Thanks for sharing!!

For a change from the norm, or even as the norm... this is the best side dish.  my family loved it and EVERYONE went for second and third Huge servings.  I don't usually have cream, so I just substituted the cream with milk and just used a bit less milk.  cheddar cheese works good aswell.

This recipe is a real "keeper". Thank you, Diana for this wonderful recipe.  I did leave out the parmesan cheese, though, and reduced the amount of milk since we prefer the creamed corn to be on the thicker side.

This is so tasty, I could make a meal out of it! I used fat free half and half, splenda, and margarine to cut down on the calories. I was skeptical about adding the parmesan cheese, but I'm glad I did. It wasn't overpowering at all. Yum!

This recipe saved me Thanksgiving morning.  All week I thought I had creamed corn on hand but didn't realize I was wrong until the last minute.  This version of cream corn tastes right on the mark.  I used it to make a corn casserole.  Thanks.

I made this last night for Christmas dinner. Fabulous. Really rich and creamy. It complimented the ham I made really well and offset the glaze. I'll make this again for sure.

Recipe is very easy but did not think it was very tasty. No rave reviews from anyone at the table either. Would not make again. One warning, it makes a very gravy like sauce have bowls handy or thicken additionally.

Very good! Tastes a bit like Rudy's BBQ cream corn only waaay cheaper.  This was easier than the crock pot version (I normally make)and a lot faster cooking with less ingredients to boot. HINT* Run corn under warm water in strainer to defrost fast.  I thought without cream cheese it would not taste that great, but figured I would give it a try.  To my surprise very good!  Thanks for sharing this simple recipe. This is my new favorite for corn =)

This is absolutely delicious! I wanted white corn and I could not find frozen so I used vacuum packed cans instead. Otherwise, I prepared this exactly as written. This will be a required dish at all my holiday meals!

This is a good basic recipe but I suggest the following modifications: start by sauteeing some diced onion in butter or olive oil. The onions help offset the blandness of the cream. Then add the remaining ingredients except the corn. Allow the mixture to thicken before adding the corn. Also, after first using frozen corn and finding the resulting dish a bit chewy, I used two cans of vacuum-packed sweet corn.

I used half and half and 1% milk and omitted the parmesan.  That just didn't sound good to me.  It was very good.  So much better than canned creamed corn.  Would definitely make again.

Absolutely the best creamed corn I have ever had! My family loved this. This recipe made so much that I used the leftover creamed corn to make corn chowder the next day. I sauteed chopped ham and half an onion in butter, added the creamed corn, 3 cooked diced potatoes, some milk to thin it out, and a dash of cayenne. omg the best corn chowder ever because of the creamed corn!!!

WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!!  We had guests over for a wonderful baked ham and thought that creamed corn would be a great side dish.  We went online and this was the first one we came to.  Tried it and it got rave reviews!!  I recommend this recipe to anyone who likes canned cream corn...you'll never open another can again!!!  My compliments to the chef!

I brought this to my cousins house today for Thanksgiving dinner and boy was this a hit. Everyone LOVED it! In fact, this side dish got more raves than any other dish. I will for sure be making this again. So easy to make and so flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly and there isn't anything I would change about it.

In testing out some recipes I want to make for the big Thanksgiving dinner this year, I came across this one.  I loathe creamed corn from the can so I really wasn't expecting much here.....WOW.  This was FABULOUS.  I used skim milk instead of cream and whole  milk (just a bit less of it) and mixed in some low fat sour cream as well.  WHEN I make this for TDay, I will use the full fat version.  Thanks much for this recipe - it's delicious!

Though I am just now posting a review, I have been using this recipe for about a year now. It is so wonderful. I don't buy canned vegetables, but if I did I definitely would not buy creamed corn.  This recipe needs no modifications.

I guess this is cream corn rather than creamed corn, but it certainly fulfills the role. I thickened mine with cornstarch rather than flour, for no reason other than I was out of flour at the time.

By far the best Cream Corn i have ever had. Better than a local bbq joint that makes it fresh daily. I can eat this stuff like crazy. The only change that i made was to add more pepper, I added a teaspoon and it still wasn't enough for my taste. I like the pepper to balance the sweet/saltyness. A definite keeper to go with any BBQ.

By far the best cream corn EVER! My husband passed a law at the house, no more buying packaged or pre-made cream corn. THANKS A LOT FOR THIS RECIPE! It became a real big hit. Everyone loves it.

Have made this a few times, it definitely needs more time to thicken!  A little cayenne kicks it up a notch.

I must say, I didn't like creamed corn before trying this recipe.  I had only had it from a can and couldn't get my palate to warm up to mushy corn goo.  However, my family loves creamed corn...even the canned kind.  Or at least they USED to like the canned kind.  Now, I've been told to never buy it again, but instead to make this great recipe.  The only change I made was to halve the sugar.  Great recipe!

I used cornstarch in place of flour and omitted the heavy cream and just used more milk. I also didn't use the parm cheese..(personal preference)  My son gave it a thumbs up and can't wait for me to make it again!

I made this recipe as a side dish for ribs my boyfriend made.  I was so good and so easy to make.  I didn't put in as much cheese as the recipes calls for because I didn't have it so what I did was put in 2 packets of dried parmasean cheese (from pizza shops) and it was really good.  I recommend this recipe because it is so easy and so good.

I have been making it for the past year and it is requested constantly.  "No skimping", is what they say.  I use Private Selection White Corn if you have a Kroger near you.  I would say any sweet white corn would be good, and you can mix in some yellow corn just to make it look festive.  I double the recipe and still have trouble keeping it around.

This was very delicious! I made this recipe to use in a corn casserole recipe from this site. I only needed a cup of it for the recipe (which turned out marvelously!), so my family and I ended up eating the rest alone. The only thing I didn't like was the whole kernels of corn. But I suppose one could chop them a bit. Also, might try cornstarch next time instead of flour. Still, delicious!

Right, this is nothing like canned cream corn.  This was great.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon and it was plenty sweet enough.  Tested it out on my neighbors and they gave it a thumbs up also.

This is wonderful!  I love corn and I'm always looking for a new and different way to fix it.  The true test was with my husband who went back for seconds and said it was delicious.  This recipe will be one of my standards.

I wanted to try a new recipe for Thanksgiving this year and this totally did the trick. It was a little bit too runny for my taste but I added a little bit of corn bread mix and that worked awesome! It's so delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe. We will be using it again! :)

Delicious!
I was unable to find creamed corn this year (Ecuador) for a corn casserole.
While I DID use it in the casserole, it almost didn't make it there after all the tasting.
Like others, I reduced the mild to 1/2 cup.  Preparing it for the casserole, I also added some garlic powder and sauteed, minced onion.  I think I would do that when using this as a side dish, also.  But it is delicious just as it is!
I hope I never find canned cream corn again ;)

Super fast to throw together and tastes rich and delicious. Make sure you stir like crazy after putting that flour in so it doesn't clump! I'd probably use half and half and a half the butter next time. Unfortunately, I'm the only one in my family who likes creamed anything.

I wanted my creamed corn to be thick so I didn't use all of the milk/cream that the recipe calls for. Also, I used an immersion blender to puree some of the corn to give it a creamier texture. It was a great recipe and tasted delicious.

My wife made this to the letter and it was absolutely delicious. Initially we thought it was a little too sweet, however when paired with slow cooked bbq brisket I made the balance was perfect. 

The brisket was a touch on the peppery side so the sweetness of this corn was dead on perfect.

Also the parmesan cheese shaved onto it at the end was a really nice twist I hadn't had before. 

Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for my son and his fiancé as it is one of his favorite dishes.  I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg to the list of ingredients.  We all enjoyed it.  If the product becomes to “dry”, add an additional 1/4 cup heavy cream.

I make this exactly as written, and it is PERFECT creamed corn. I have always loved creamed corn, but it’s disgusting out of a can. I decided to look for a homemade recipe once my kids started liking more solid foods. This recipe is not overly sweet, not overly creamy, and not overly heavy. It doesn’t look like corn slop, if that makes sense. I normally adjust recipes, but I don’t need to change this one at all. It’s perfect and delicious as-is.

I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THIS AGAIN

I'm a first timer. Usually I buy the can. Didn't have frozen so I used canned whole kernel. IT CAME OUT PERFECT. Though I'm partial to sweet, I did add a bit more sugar(a couple pinches), but that's to MY LIKING.
Was sceptical about the parmesan but my god.......I was not disappointed. If you're a can lover the parmesan will not disappoint you. Trust me.

I really like this recipe, and it's just what the title says:"easy". FYI: the recipe calls for one cup of milk while the video shows only 1/2 cup. The 1/2 cup is correct. A full cup of milk  yields too much liquid. I would make this recipe again.

This recipe is aptly named as the best creamed corn recipe ever. And it’s surprisingly easy. Virtually every individual who ate it at my party said the exact same thing. “This is the best creamed corn I have ever eaten”

Way better than the canned stuff! My family has a cream corn casserole recipe that we all love, but this Thanksgiving I just didn't want to do the extra work for it.   I was nervous if my family would like this.... but everyone said it was sooo good and I totally agree.

This is amazing! I doubled the recipe and used fresh corn, cut off the cob. I sauteed the corn in butter for a few min to cook it. I didn't have any Parmesan , didn't need it in m opinion! I give this one 20 stars!

Love creamed corn...  this is almost exactly the same recipe I have for creamed corn with cilantro and lemon zest...    So I just make a batch without either..  and add either the cilantro / lemon.. or the parm....     I do the same with egg salads, potato salads, pea salads, etc.... make the basic base, then  mix each bowl to order as I go.. making several versions of the salads out each base.   works great for me being single..

it's a pretty simple recipe.... pretty tasty but the flour seemed raw...   next time i make it, i'll use a roux with the flour/butter.

Thanks for sharing.

I've made it twice. The first time it came out perfect and was a hit with the family. The second time I forgot to defrost the frozen corn so it tasted like frozen corn in heavy cream. My suggestion make sure you defrost if using the frozen corn

I made this for a potluck because I didn't know what to do with 10 cans of corn. Now all my friends won't stop asking me to make this again. Making creamed corn is all I'm known for. What did I do to deserve this.

I have made this 3 times and my whole family loves it.  The only change I have made is to use my immersion blender to break up the corn kernals a little. It makes the sauce taste a little more "corny".  Definitely a winner!!

There is a bbq restaurant down here in SATX that's makes a very popular cream corn. When I followed this easy recipe it was almost identical!! I say almost bc when I went back to the restaurant, it was just not as good as this one! I've made it for dinner and family get togethers and it's a hit!!! And let me again just say how easy it is - I'm your most helpless chef ??

OK, I did change this a bit.......Only because The weather here in California has been warm and beautiful this February, I planned a BBQ with tri tip, ribs, corn, some Mac and cheese, etc. Well guess what? Huge rain storm, so cooking had to be done indoors!! I was originaly going to make Elote (grilled Mexican corn on the cob with mayo, chili powder, and cojeta cheese similar to parmesan) My ribs and Tri tip both had a southwest/mexican flare to them so I wanted the corn to mix in. I found this recipe.......followed the directions exactly, just added a tsp of ancho chili powder and used the cojeta cheese instead of the parmesan. I also did what some others did.....cook it early and put it in the crock pot on low, only because with out being able to use the grill I wasn't going to get help from hubby (he only grills)LOL! It came out great and saved my corn for this meal!!! Thank you!!

This cream corn was fantastic. I only made the following changes based on what I had: 1 cup half & half instead of heavy cream and only 1/2 cup of milk (instead of 1 cup). I also put in a dash of paprika. I will be making again.

I like this recipe because it is still cream corn, but feels more fresh than the usual baked casserole. Done in the skillet everything stay crisp and feels less heavy.

I absolutely loved it! Everyone had big second helpings.
This is definitely creamed corn like no other. 
I was out of heavy cream, so I used evaporated milk. It came out very creamy and delicious. I think with the heavy cream it would be a bit too rich. 
These were creamy, sweet (but not too sweet), and had a slightly cheesy taste to them. Absolute perfection!

I've never, ever liked creamed corn in my life always thought it was so boring until I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. This corn was simply amazing! Fattening yes, but my four finds loved it!  The next day they were all fighting over who gets the leftovers! Lol. Definitely a keeper and will make more often..

really good I will be using cornstarch like another user suggested to thicken in up. It was also a little to sweet, so I might cut the sugar back just a touch.

Very good and so simple! I didn't have Parmesan so I used shredded Colby jack cheese and it was delicious.

My first time making cream corn.  Very easy to make and was a hit with the whole family.  I did use fresh corn on the cob.  I cooked the corn for a few minutes in the microwave and cut it off the cob before adding it  to the pan.  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe.  Made it for my mashed potatoes.  I just used 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream (hey, it worked!), and 2% milk for all the rest.  Very creamy.

Cooked this today for dinner. The only thing I did different was that I added a pck. of sweet frozen cream corn because I didn't have any sugar. Tastes fantastic! Will be fixing this more often.  :)

It was good. I was a tad taken aback at how different it was from the canned version. But GOOD different. I found it a little thick after the recommended time. I added some water and it quickly smoothed out to my desired consistency.  I will make it again for sure.

I tried this recipe a few years ago for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  We are a family who's favorite veggie is corn, so this was a twist to the old boring corn!!  Even the grand kids who normally don't like cream corn loved this!  It's tradition now every year to fix this!!

This is creamed corn for adults - every time I make it, I receive raves.  The only thing I change is extra Parmesan cheese... I tend to heap it and then toss in just a little extra; after all, can you ever have too much cheese?

My cousin asked me to bring a vegetable dish for supper. I didn't want to take baked beans or green bean casserole. This morning I found your creamed corn recipe and thought.."ah, this is different." Not only different but great. Thanks.

This recipe came really close to the one I had at the Bonaventure in DTLA. I did mine with 2% fat milk, But I reduced it in a separate pan to make it thicker. Be generous with the parm.

This corn was amazing, although I did a few things differently.  I doubled the recipe.  I used Almond Milk instead of whole milk, just because I drink Almond Milk.  After about 18 minutes of cooking, I began to add more flour to thicken the sauce.  I ended up adding 2 1/2 tablespoons more.  From the time the corn came to a slight boil, I cooked it for about 45 minutes before it was as thick as I liked.  I poured the corn into a greased casserole dish and added more salt and pepper on top.  I refrigerated it overnight then heated it (covered with foil) the next day for a family gathering.  I did 200 degrees for about one hour.  My family LOVED it.  My mom, who has cooked since she was 9 years old and now has a small country cafe, went crazy!  She said it tasted like a dessert.  :)  Definitely a re-do!

yum!! Followed pretty close, turned out GREAT. Hubby likes the canned stuff so I blended it with a hand blender a little bit, so it would look a little more familiar. HE LOVED IT! (didn't add cheese, still so good!)

My husband wanted "homemade" creamed corn!  So I went to my favorite site....  Luckily I chose this recipe!!  It was super!  Only changes I made were I used Lawrey's garlic salt instead of regular salt and added sauted fresh jalapeños.
He and his buddies gave me rave reviews!!  ??. ????

My own twist was to add pancetta and smoked gouda to the recipe. The results...WOW! I doubled the recipe for a crowd, but forgot to double the amount of heavy cream in the store. Half and half and some milk substituted nicely. We heated the leftovers the next day as a meal and it was like a hearty, creamy soup. I dare say it was even better the next day, so this is a recipe that would do well if made ahead of time.

This is really good! I use this in place of canned cream corn when I am making homemade corn bread....of course I save some for eating.

I have always loved creamed corn, but even my husband who doesn't, likes this. Also, if you are using frozen corn, there is no need to chop up the corn, the cooking process does it well enough. ENJOY!

This creamed corn is awesome.  Can't wait until summer so I can try it with fresh corn.  I did not change any of the ingredients, just made it a little different with a roux first.  Added the sugar last because sugar will stick to the bottom of the pan.  Great with or without the cheese.  I made a triple batch for Thanksgiving and everyone raved!  Thanks!

this is the recipe I was looking for after having eaten this side a few years ago .  Had tried recipes with the cream cheese, but it was not "liquid" enough so I am glad that this Thanksgiving I tried this version.  Did not add the Parmesan and added some red bell peppers as my variation to this recipe.  Thanks for posting !

This corn will have you licking your plate, bowl, spoon, pot and pan! I made this for Thanksgiving for the first time and I believe I've found a winner. Be careful to watch and pay close attention when its cooking! I didnt and ending up scalding the bottom of my pan. I was able to save it though and it was still edible...by far a great recipe and tastes like its homemade straight off the cob! Thanks  DIANA YOCKEY!

This was great. It tasted like cream corn kicked up with some I made it myself feeling added it. With or without the cheese it is wonderful and didn't take a lot of money or time to make. Great dish for a potluck.

I used half and half as well and we loved it. My partner hates canned creamed corn but loved this! I killed the cheese as well as i wanted it to be more traditional.

Best creamed corn I have had. EVER. I bet I have made it five times in the last few years. (And that is a lot, considering the calorie count!) You will NEVER regret giving this a try!

This was wonderful!  I modified by using 1/2 cup light cream and 1/2 cup milk (1%).  I used canned corn because that was what I happened to have on hand.  It was great!

In typical fashion, I had too much going at once, so believe I overcooked it, and the corn was too "chewy". So, next time, will cook less time. Also, want to try using fresh corn off the cob. Thank you for the recipe.

I just prepared this dish, adding just a bit more cream and a little less milk, plus one teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Before I could add the cheese, everyone in the family begged me not to add anything else. They've lined up at the stove to taste and describe it as the best they've ever had...try it, you'll love it. Cheese isn't necessary!

Super easy to make it this way. I've always prepared it like you would gravy; melt butter, add flour, make a paste, pour in the milk & cream, thicken, add corn. You get almost the same results in Diana's preparation (if not better), and it makes it so much easier. Throw all ingredients in and you're done! This is a dish my whole family loves. I've made it countless times. Thanks for sharing!!

Very tasty and I was never one to care for creamed can corn at all.  My family loved it.  I made it without the parmesan cheese and I had a 32oz bag of frozen corn so I used the whole bag. It was rich and creamy. Delish! It went great with my rib roast.

I've tried this recipe and it was very good, but too rich I think. As I read other reviews I think I might take to the advice of trying half&half rather than the heavy cream. Very tasty otherwise!

We had some leftover flour and corn from another dish so I used the ingredient finder and found this. It was DIVINE! I love canned cream corn. I'm low brow that way. But this shamed it. I think it could use a bit less sugar but it really was delicious. We made this prior to a party with the intention to refrigerate it for later, to preserve our appetite for the party... It was gone before we left.

This was very good, much better than the overly sweet canned cream corn. My children enjoyed it tremendously and requested seconds. The only modification I had to add was making a cornstarch slurry in conjunction with the flour. It just was a little runny even after letting it cook for about 15 minutes with the flour (excluding cornstarch).

It's true.  It's delicious.  My daughter (a vegatarian) absolutely adored this recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Loved this recipe. I love how the corn is whole and not mashed up, like when it comes from a can of creamed corn. The sauce is delicious and as it thickens it gets even better. Made this for thanksgiving with the family and it was a big hit with everyone. :)

Very nice version of the usually insipid creamed corn. I had to use canned corn since I wasn't able to find frozen corn in French supermarkets, but it was still excellent.

This deserves more than 5 stars.  With or without the parmesan, it is a great recipe.  The whole family loves it; I'm never eating canned corn again!

So easy, quick and delicious. I smoked a jalapeño on the grill while this was simmering, de-seeded it, chopped it tiny and stirred it in. Simmered for an extra 10 minutes or so, soooo good. Thanks for posting!!

My two little ones, who never both like the same food both loved this.  I added spinach because I wanted them to eat some greens.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty closely.  They ate all that I put on their plate and asked for more.  Thanks for sharing!

So yummy!  I made this the first time as stated on the recipe with the exception of the parmesan cheese because I didn't have any on hand.  Turned out excellent!  My second attempt at making this I used all milk because I didn't have heavy cream on hand and added a tablespoon or so of cream cheese, also reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon since NJ corn is super sweet.  With added changes still turned out wonderful!  Very easy and forgiving recipe!  With a recipe as wonderful and simple as this, I don't know how anyone can eat canned cream corn.  Thanks for sharing!

Delish! I've also made a lighter version (not light, but closer!). 

I use the cream as indicated, then half the milk--and I use 1% milk instead of whole. 

Then, I add about 3/4 cup of cooked pumpkin. I use fresh, but I'm sure canned would work fine. It tastes wonderful, contributes to that rich texture that the whole milk & cream gives, and adds a few more vitamins into the mix. DH loves it!

The best creamed corn I've ever had!  I add a little bit of corn meal to the milk and flour mixture... it just makes the corn flavor a little more powerful.

i used your recipe and replaced the milk with coconut milk for an asian flare.  excellent flavor!  i left off the Parmesan cheese as i was going to use this in the Grandma's Corn Pudding recipe (which called for canned cream corn but i wanted to make something more from scratch).  twas excellent!  :)

This is the best cream corn recipe! The only thing I leave out is the parmasan. We make this for all of our special meals.

This recipe was very easy and very delicious.  Some changes I made were that I used canned corn, half and half, and no parmesan cheese.  My kiddos were begging for more!  I'll be sure to double up next time!

This stuff is incredible.  I think I'd use a little less sweetener though next time.

Tried this tonight. Wow, this was great. Used just half&half, no milk.  Creamy and wonderful.  Used shredded Parm as I didn't have fresh to grate.  This recipe is a keeper!

Made this at a get-together and our friends are the type of people who don't eat much.  BUT boy did they dig into this dish!!! The only thing about the recipe is it didn't say what kind of corn. Because I like sweet, i got white sweet corn.  I thought it was a little too sweet so I'll get the regular corn next time.  I just tried to balance the dish out with salt. Other than that, it was dee-lish! And easy to prepare. I would highly recommend this one.

Good but I remember my grandmother's creamed corn where the corn was cut off the cob and had a stronger corn flavor.  I think partly because it was fresh and partly because the kernels were cut and the juices from the corn mixed into the sauce.  If I make this again with frozen corn I'll chop the kernels up first.  Also will skip the parmesan cheese.

This was a tasty recipes. I used 1% milk in place of whole milk AND the heavy cream, and it still came out rich and creamy with much less added fat. I also threw in a pinch of Cajun spice just to give it a little kick. Will make again with my changes.

Delicious!  Not like that goo-in-a-can they call creamed corn.  Great recipe!  I add just a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a little heat.

OMG-this was sooo delicious.  I am craving the leftovers right now.  I followed the recipe except changed out the heavy cream for half and half and reduced it to 3/4 cup since it is more liquidy.  This was outstanding.  I served with a roasted pork tenderloin and steamed broccoli.

There is a very good reason everyone is rating this 5 stars. It is simply the very best creamed corn I have ever eaten. The preparation was ultra quick and easy. I can honestly say I will never eat the canned cream corn again!!!

LOVED IT!!! Super rich & creamy--my new go to side dish for extra corn! I used fresh roasted corn and blended a little heavy cream with 2% milk for the whole milk part but it still came out great! Big hit at the bbq!

Wow!!!  LOVE this recipe.  First, I have to say that we get a weekly delivery from a local creamery.  So, not only did I use the freshest cream & milk, I also used organic corn, grown just miles from our house.  I steamed 8 ears of corn and cut it off the cob.  When I measured it, I got approximately 32 oz. so I doubled the recipe.  First I melted butter in a heavy bottomed stock pot and added the corn and gave everything a good stir.  Next, I added the salt, sugar and pepper, stirring with each inclusion.  Then I poured in the heavy cream. And finally I added the mixture of milk and flour.  I was fully prepared to add freshly grated Romano cheese to this dish (it's what I had on hand), but after tasting before, then adding just a small amount of cheese to a couple spoonfuls of creamed corn, decided not to.  I felt that the Romano cheese left the dish too salty.  In the future, if I decide that I want to add the cheese I will drastically reduce the amount of salt added to the dish, at the beginning.  But this time, I decided to not fix what wasn't broken.  Prepared, as mentioned above and omitting the cheese, this was AWESOME!!!  I'll never warm up something out of a can again!!!  Thank you for this amazing recipe.

My family loves creamed corn and I 've been searching for a recipe that's not made with canned ingredients. I made this without parmesan cheese, but added crumbled cooked bacon for color and a little smoky flavor. Its easy and quick with a rich homemade taste.  Thank you for sharing it.

Fantastic recipe!  My family gobbed it up.  Even the six year old came back for seconds.  I tasted it before the parmesan cheese, and thought it tasted very good.  You could leave it out and still get loads of compliments.

I've tried a couple of other creamed corn recipes but this is by far, the favorite.  It has a hint of sweetness and the sauce thickens nicely.  My family enjoys eating this creamed corn, along with my 2 year old toddler, who doesn't want to eat something just by looking at it.

My husband said it was the best corn he had ever eat.  I used corn I had frozen from our garden and I also used half and half instead whipping cream.  I will be making it again I'm sure.

My family and I absolutely loved this recipe! It definitely held up to it's name. My family had never had anything but frozen or canned cream corn and after having this cream corn we'll never go back again. We made this for a family get together and everyone went back for seconds, not a single kernel was left over. I will definitely be making this again!

The first time I made this, I was astonished! I had previously only eaten creamed corn out of the can and I did not care for it much, and I always avoided it when eating out. From the first bite, I had one of those OMG! moments. It tasted so fresh and just like corn too! I have made it several times since, and it's always a hit. Be warned though, it is highly addictive!

I found this recipe an hour ago and just made it (and I did add a little nutmeg) and  holy cow!  It is AWESOME!! So easy and SOOOO good.  BTW, I can't have straight sugar so I used 5 packets of Splenda and it is unreal!  Took me 5 minutes to put it together and 5 minutes to cook it!  Thank you Diana for this yummy recipe that is going into my files!

This was excellent. I made it for Christmas and it was a big hit. I've also made mass quantities of this for a homeless shelter and it got rave reviews. The tip about blitzing some of the corn in a food processor was great. It gave it the texture of canned creamed corn, but with an amazing taste.

This creamed corn is sooo good. I like mine a bit richer, so I use an entire stick of butter, eye the heavy cream (probably ends up being halved), omit the sugar and salt (parmesan makes it taste salty enough), and use 1% milk (I never seem to have whole on hand). I like to saute the corn in the butter and then add the other ingredients. Have frozen and reheated it; it tastes delicious no matter what I do to it! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This is the first and only creamed corn recipe I have and will ever use with a couple of changes, I did use sweet canned corn, 3 cans and left out the parmessan as I am not a fan. Made this for Thanksgiving and X-Mas dinner and it was the first dish to go, my entire family loves this. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for my Christmas eve dinner, and it was compared to Rudy's creamed corn!  Here in Texas, that is a heftly compliment.  I allowed it to simmer much longer than called for, because I made it early... I think that helped develop the dish and thicken the cream.  Also used two 16 oz packages of corn, and I only had 2% milk so I used half a cup of that and 1 1/2 cups heavy cream.  Also first thing I did was create a roux, then added the milk/cream mixture.  Great recipe!

I used this for a post-Christmas dinner for my in-laws and its a great recipe. Very high in calories and fat but SO worth it. Everything in moderation, I say ;o) My husband isn't a fan of "tradtional" cream corn but he loved this. Sweet and a little savory and next time I make it (probably around Easter or some other special occasion) I think I'll use a small can of mild green chiles. I think a little bit of heat would compliment this dish quite nicely.

I have to agree, it is cream corn like no other. I made this with my Christmas dinner, as a side to a beautiful (and EXPENSIVE) beef tenderloin....not one word about the tenderloin....but everyone RAVED about the corn. Made exactly as recipe dictates - it was wonderful!!

Last year I made Gullivers cream corn but decided to try this one on Xmas.  It is so good, it's my go to cream corn recipe from now on.  The only thing I changed was to omit the parmesan cheese, otherwise followed the recipe as written.

Made this for Christmas dinner.  Everyone thought it was great.  I admit though, I did half the sugar.  Very easy to make and doesn't dirty a lot of dishes.

Its a good recipe.  But, if your not really careful about how you add the flour to the milk you can end up with some serious lumps.   I recommend melting the butter in a pan first, and creating a rue with your flour then add the milk and cream, sugar, salt and peper.  Once it begins to warm through you can add the corn.    If you forget to thaw your corn this method will also prevent the freezing of the cream that happens when you pour it and sugar over frozen corn.

I love this Recipe! I lived in the south and made this for many people back there who are picky about their homemade dishes. This one always got rave reviews and leftovers are slim.  I omit the Parmasean cheese simply because I was trying to keep it more traditional.  I have used this recipe over and over again, followed it exactly (w/o parm.) and will continue to use it in the future. Thanks for the great recipe!

This tasted really good. I accidently forgot to add the parmesan cheese but it still tasted good and creamy. Served with pork chops, brown sugar carrots, and "Caramelized Brussels Sprouts with Pistachios."

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic. We had 12 people over and everyone loved it and I had to give them all the recipe.  The only thing I changed was Instead of using 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup whole milk, I substituted the same amount of Half and Half Cream for each.  I don't normally buy whole milk so this seemed to simplify the recipe for me.  This is the ultimate in comfort food!!!  There are not enough words to describe how delicious and easy this dish is!

I have never been a fan of creamed corn but my dad love it.  I used to get the Boston Market Asiago Creamed Corn and loved it then the store stopped carrying it.  I was looking for a recipe for asiago creamed corn that I might like and I found this one that called for parmesean.  So I changed the parmesean for grated asiago (I add about 1/2 cup or more to really add flavor) and it is fantastic!!!  I make it for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year and even family members that don't like creamed corn love this.  Thanks!!

Loved it!  I used 2 15oz cans of Corn as that is what I had on hand.  I used half n half in place of the heavy cream and it was perfect. Thanks.

I love corn and this is one of the easiest recipes to do and it tasted amazing! Never thought I could make my own creamed corn but I did...I did add an extra tablespoon of sugar because the parmesan flavor was a tad bit too strong so I'd try to put less parmesan for next time, but overall two thumbs up ^^

A fantastic creamed corn - everyone raved about it. I think the Parmesan cheese adds such a great flavor to it!

My husband is a relatively picky eater.  He's the one asking to make this again.  This recipe is quick and easy.  The flavor is outstanding!  Thank you for sharing your recipe with all of us.

This is defintely like no other in every sense of the phrase. This is certianly on par with the well known BBQ chain here in TX called Rudy's. In fact this demolishes theirs because it's made in the comfort of my own kitchen and isn't $2.00 per half pint.... Excellent.

My family is not one who likes creamed corn with that being said we loved this. I intentionally made it to have the right ingredients for another recipe but we ended up eating most of this out of the pan. This is waaaaaay different that the stuff out of the can and way worth the effort!!!

My 5 yr-old daugther and I thought this was good, however my BF and 9 yr-old son thought it was just "okay".  I followed the recipe exactly as printed. Since I got "lukewarm" reactions, I will probably not make again.

This recipe is fantastic!! I've never really liked cream corn, because of the ones that I've tasted before. This cream corn is just what it says, Like No Other!! I added more of the seasoning than required and I also added some season salt. I also used white shoe peg corn instead of yellow corn. Everyone loved it! Great recipe!

UPDATE: Another Year and Im still making this and everyone LOVES it. A must try. Love this recipe!
OK. So let me say, I have always hated creamed corn, but this is wonderful! I made this for Thanksgiving last year for the first time and all of the guests raved about this recipe. Other times I have used fat free milk with cornstarch and cut out the flour which I find sometimes gives a floury texture. Mix the cornstarch in the cold milk to ensure no clumps. Came out just as good as the original recipe and was a little healthier. Do make sure to use fresh Parmesan. The canned grated stuff wont melt into a creamy sauce. This was great!

Very good.  I didn't have heavy cream handy, so I used half-&-half with no problem.  I forgot to let the corn thaw before cooking, and I don't know if that had anything to do with this, but the corn came out just a little too firm still (compared to the creamed corns I remember).  I might let it cook with the lid on a little longer next time to soften it just a tad.

Great Creamed Corn! Tastes like Rudy's (The Worst BBQ in Texas)  My 7 year old said that it "was the best dinner EVER" I may tweek it a little bit, & try to lower the fat/calories.

Fantastic! I used fresh corn. I had 5 smallish ears on hand which only gave me enough to halve the recipe (weighed about 12 ounces once cut from the cobs). I will definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks!

Bf liked it, although he said that the parmesan cheese threw him and didn't fit with the corn.  I tried it, but I've never liked it so I'm not a fair assessment of the taste of this recipe.  It didn't make me change my mind.  Bf liked it, so his viewpoint is what counts.  He ate it all in one sitting, and I made a half recipe, which is supposed to serve 4!  Just no parmesan chese for him, I guess.  Thanks for the recipe.

Incredible cream corn - i was looking for a recipe that did not require cream cheese (I am not a fan) and this was it. Its a little work to constantly stir/whish the mixture as its cooking - but well worth it.

I just whipped this corn up for dinner and it is so good.  I didn't have heavy cream and only had skim milk.  So, used skim milk in place of the cream and whole milk that the recipe called for. I did use less liquids, just so it wouldn't be so runny.     It tasted so yummy and I couldn't even tell it wasn't made with heavy cream!   I think it tastes just like our local BBQ creamed corn, here in Texas!  Plus, made with the skim milk it is a little more healthier!  I do think you should try!  It was very easy aswell!

This recipe is just what I wanted! I made this to go inside of a shepards pie. I didn't have any cream on hand so I used 2% milk instead, I added 1/2 tbs flour extra and the consistancy and taste were perfect! Thank you for the great recipe.

Delicious!!  I left out the parmesean cheese, just because I tasted it just before and really didn't think it needed it.  It was the most popular side dish at my Christmas dinner.

Followed this recipe to the letter and it came out delicious!  The Parmesan was subtle enough so that it added richness to the corn (beyond the heavy cream richness!) but wasn't so strong as to turn this into cheesy corn.  Made it for Tgiving and it was a hit...for everyone but the lactose intolerant! :)  Thanks for a great side dish that was different from corn pudding!

So delicious! I was asked to bring a creamed corn dish for Thanksgiving and since I had never even had creamed corn, I was a little hesitant. I followed the recipe exact (for 16 people) and it was a HUGE hit!!!!

Very good. Well received by my family at Thanksgiving. It is a nice change from just your normal corn served with butter. I liked the sweet taste. Will make again.

Amazing!I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner because many people in my family have a hard time eating corn on the cob. I went the extra mile with all the dishes, but this one in particular made me proud. I got several compliments on it and will be making it again for regular family meals. The only change I made was using a 32 oz. bag of frozen corn, and it was excellent!

I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday.  It was the hit of the meal!  It was SOOOO
good that it will be on our Thanksgiving table every year from now on.  I did add just a little bit of corn starch to help things go a little faster, and I may use 1/2 & 1/2 next time to save a few calories, but this stuff is REALLY good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was SOOO delicious! My husband & I both loved it and all of our other guests said it was great! I made this for thanksgiving and was very nervous to try it out, as this was my first Thanksgiving dinner, but it really was the best cream corn I have ever tasted...so much better than canned!

Everyone loved it! It was a "rich" type of vegetable, yet it wasn't too heavy or too sweet. I didn't have heavy cream or whole milk, so I substituted with 2 cups of half and half and it was still wonderful.  I'm wondering if it would be a great "cream" sauce of other vegetables like spinach, collard greens, etc.????

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out to be delicious. I agree that it has way too many calories to make on a regular basis, but I think it is perfect for a special occasion. My husband loved it, and he is not a big fan of cream corn. I will definitely make it again.

I thought this was pretty good. I served it at Thanksgiving as a side. Mine came out a little runny, but my son didn't mind as he likes to put it over his mashed potatoes. I liked the idea another reviewer had to use leftovers for corn chowder, as I love chowder.

I've made this about 5 times for different holidays and get-togethers.  It's really easy and everyone loves it! I prefer my creamed corn to be a bit thicker, so I use just a little bit less heavy cream and add a pinch more cheese.

This was really good and well liked by everyone.  I cut back on the sugar a little and next time I will leave it out completely it was sweet enough on it's own.  My husband cringed when I said I was making creamed corn he changed his mind when he saw it and had seconds.  Thanks!

This was very good.  I did have to alter things only because I didnt have all of the ingredients on hand.  I did have canned corn (not creamed) but no frozen so I used 2 Cans (drained) and I used 1% milk since that is all that I had on hand.  I also added some garlic & onion powder for taste. It was still good but I cannot wait to to try it according to recipe.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will update my review once I have tried the original recipe.

Great recipe.  I did add a small amount of finely minced onion and garlic to the pan and lightly sauteed before adding the other ingredients.  I also went a little lighter on the cream and a little heavier on the milk as well as a little lighter on the cheese. Very good.

I made this last night, exactly as written but using (2) 16oz bags of corn.  EVERYONE loved it, including a very picky 17 year old who doesn't like creamed corn.  I have to admit that in the past I've always just opened a can of creamed corn and heated it but I will never open another can of creamed corn again.  This was wonderful, it took a little while longer than I thought it would to thicken, but we all loved it and I'm sure I will be asked to make this often.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Cream corn like no other REALLY describes this dish well. It had such a unique flavor that I wasn't used to tasting with corn. I made a roux instead of adding the milk and flour later, and it was excellent! I will be making this side dish alot.

YUM! I usually am not a creamed corn person, but this is amazing. I used buttermilk instead of heavy cream because it was all I had on hand. I used a little less milk and a little more flour to thicken it up. YUMMMMMMM! I can't wait to try this out on my fam for thanksgiving.

I've been making a creamed corn recipe that I learned from my father.  I always thought it was tops until this one.  This was by far the best recipe I've ever had for creamed corn.  Everyone loved it!

I have had so many complimants to this recipe.  I made some changes with the way I prepare it.  I add extra sugar and do not use any parmesan.  I tried it with the parmesan the first time and my family did not like it.

Very Good.  I found it needed more corn, so I added a can while cooking.  Otherwise it may have been to 'saucy'.  I did forget to add the cheese - that might have tightened it up some. Everyone really loved it.

I have tried several different recipes for creamed corn, and I have to say by far this was the best. I doubled the recipe and served it to my kids an there wasn't a kernel left.... Thanks so much for sharing

Perfect recipe! I made a double recipe for our family dinner based on the reviews - and I am so glad I did! It is the best! The ones who don't like the canned stuff were all over this one!! No wonder - there is NO resemblance!! Thank you for this perfect corn from heaven!

Excellent recipe! I like slow cooker corn w/ cream cheese and was searching for something similar to make for dinner since I didn't have time to put anything in the crock pot when I came upon this recipe - and am I glad I did!! This was even better!I did blend about 1/2 the mixture as some other reviewers suggested, just to make it "creamed" and used more corn & less sauce, but I still give the recipe 5 stars for flavor & convienience! thanks for posting

I feel sure I have found in this recipe a staple that will be around for a long, long time. I just made this for a dinner tomorrow and woweee is it ever delicious!
I don't think I want quite as much liquid, so I am going to warm up some more corn in butter to add to it tomorrow before reheating. I am finding it very hard to quit "sampling" ths dish! Thank you Diana, this is absolutely wonderful.

I made this last night for my picky husband and kids. They LOVED it! I thought it was very good - no comparison at all to canned cream corn which we do not like. 
The only thing I did to alter the recipe was leaving out the parmesan cheese. Thanks for a great new side dish!

Such an easy recipes to follow.  And works well with changes.  We use cheddar cheese and canned corn and it still comes out perfect.

This was loved by everyone on Thanksgiving.  Everyone was afraid to try it because they hate canned cream corn and thought this would be the same.  Everyone was wrong and it was gone as fast as the mashed potatoes.  I am already getting requests for this at Christmas.

Thanks

WOW!  I make a cornbread that uses creamed corn, and I didn't have any cans--so I thought I'd look for an easy recipe with items I had on hand.  This is FANTASTIC!  The only substitute I had to make was skim milk for whole, but it was still so good.  I couldn't stop "testing" it, until I was afraid I wouldn't have enought left for the cornbread!  I think I will have to use this in my recipe every time now!!  THANK YOU!!

This is a great way to prepare corn! I love it best with corn straight from our garden, but frozen corn works well in the winter. We don't use the parmesan. We've made it for company several times and it's always a hit! Mmmmm...

This was great. My mother wouldn't let me use heavy cream, and I used skim milk instead of whole milk, but it turned out great just the same. Delicious!

Keep cookin'! ;o)

A family favorite.  A big hit for New Years dinner party.  Plus, requests have been made for me to make it at following BBQ events.  I have made it twice and have been asked to make it a lot more.

The flavor is excellent, but I made this twice and found using frozen corn, made the kernels have a kind of chewy texture, which I found to be objectionable, hence, 4 stars instead of 5.  I will make this again, but I plan on scraping kernels off fresh corn cobs.  I’m a down-home-country-girl and as such, my motto is Fresh is Always Best!  This recipe is very easy to make, and has a superb flavor.  It’s a keeper!

Would give this 10 stars if I could. I used frozen sweet white corn, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I've never had so many people ask me for a recipe, even a year after it was served! Definitely a staple for holiday dinners.

Thank you Diana!  I love creamed corn but am currently living in Italy, where it is not available.  This lived up to all expectations that I had and exceeded them.  I agree with you, it is nothing like creamed corn from the can, it is SOOOO much better.  The only change that I made was not adding the parmesan - I didn't feel I was missing anything!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great recipe...I did not change anything!  I did use a 16 oz bag of corn as the store did not carry the 10 oz bag, and even though there was not enough corn for the cream, it did not matter!  Yummy in my tummy!  My spouse loved it.  She said this could be a regular dish!  Thanx for the recipe.  By the way, I used this cream corn in a mexican cornbread recipe that I found on allrecipes.com as well. The cornbread called for creamed corn and I used this in the cornbread.  It also came out very well.

I followed this recipe to the letter...and had to later call my Mom and tell her I'd completely ruined my taste buds for creamed corn from the can.This was fantastic-I never realized it could taste like THAT!I'm having people over to dinner next week just for an excuse to make it again.

This was so good.  I made a half-batch since it was a new recipe that I wasn't sure the family would like.  However, everyone really liked it.  It's very flavorful and creamy.  Hubby had seconds and finished the bowl.

Yummy! I'm not a big corn lover, but this was great. My three year old daughter loved it. I didn't have fresh corn on hand and used canned, still good. Can't wait to try fresh out of the garden this summer.

This corn did not look very good at all. I made it for a get together at my house last weekend, and most of the people did tell me that it tasted good, but I was still pretty disappointed at the presentation.

I made this as one of my side dishes for Thanksgiving, it was okay.   I am looking for a recipe though more like my Grandmothers.   Still it was very easy to prepare and was not terrible by any means, and it sure does beat cream corn from a can.  Yuck

This was a good recipe and I really enjoyed it. I made it especially for my nephew who is only 13 and adores creamed corn from the can. It was very different and although he ate it I could tell he preffered the canned version. However, the adults really enjoyed it. I used extra sweet frozen corn on the cob that I thawed and removed from the cob. I will definately make this again but not for a canned creamed corn fan. Thanks for sharing!

Made this thinking my kids would love it and they actually did not like it at all.  I had to agree with them.  I do not know if I did something wrong but it came out way too thick and I did follow the directions exactly.

So yummy! This is my go-to potluck dish. I have made it as written and also with pureeing a fourth of the corn to add to the sauce... and I think I prefer it with the pureed corn. Either way its still delicious!

This recipe was pretty good. Next time I will bump up the corn ratio a little bit and also thought that I could bump up the seasoning as well.

I like to make my shepherd's pie with a layer of creamed corn.  I made the pie today for my own lunch (and bc everybody but me in my family is burnt out on it).  I had no canned cream corn so made this recipe.  I eyeballed measurements and used only evaporated milk bc heavy cream is something I do usually have on hand. The eval milk was a little think so I did add some skim (what we drink) and it all worked out.  Summary:  super yummy and hard to mess up recipe.

Been using this recipe for years. My family goes crazy for it at every thanksgiving and Christmas.  Perfect as is but sometimes I find myself adding a half tablespoon of sugar after the cheese.

Oh, holy cow, I just made this for the big family Christmas dinner and I'm pretty sure I'll never eat any other creamed corn again.  I'm also not sure it's going to last until the family all gets here.

I made the recipe exactly as shown and it was perfect.  I keep wandering into the kitchen to eat another spoonful.  

I don't think the directions say how long to cook it, just "until thickened," which is actually all I needed.  I just wanted to mention that it took longer to thicken than I suspected it would, so be aware that the dish might take a little longer to cook than you planned (I'm not talking hours and hours or anything like that).  The flavor of this is amazing.

My family loves cream style corn, but I hate the watery stuff out of the can. My mom always made corn pudding for the holidays, and this recipe is perfectly in between the can corn version and mom’s more decadent holiday treat. I followed the recipe to the letter, and it turned out fantastic. So tasty, and the kids loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly and this is one of the best dishes we have ever eaten. I wasn't sure about the Parmesan cheese, but it really does add a nice dimension to the dish, both in flavor and texturally.  
I hate it that I haven't been making this all these long 45+ years of cooking!!

I did not care for this recipe. I am not normally  a fan of creamed corn and so maybe that is why, but my group remarked that it was “ok”.  Made it exactly from recipe.  I think I would have preferred just plain corn with butter, salt, and pepper.

Made this as a side for Thanksgiving, it was fantastic.  At first people were skeptical having "creamed corn" but, it was almost gone by the end of the day and I had even doubled it. You can spice it up too.

I have used this recipe for years. I did modify a bit. I added the butter and flour together and let it cook until it looks like wet sand. This keeps the recipe from having a flour taste.

I was worried about trying a new recipe for Thanksgiving, but the reviews reassured me that this would be a good addition for a side dish. It was a incredible! I made 28 servings and had almost nothing left by the end of dinner. This is definitely a crowd pleaser. Everyone loved it!

Made it twice! Had to use 32oz of corn the first time but used the same measurements (with a lil bit of eyeballing here and there). for Thanksgiving, I made a whole 80oz of it. Multiplied the ingredients by 2.5 then eyeballed any extra flour, sugar, and parmesan. Everyone loved it!~

I read some reviews. For you people that rated this a 3 or less, you have no taste. This is by far the very best, rich and creamy corn ever. 
My only change was use Half & Half all the way. Do not use fat free . Use real butter and cream.

I made this exactly as written and it was PERFECT! I can't stand canned creamed corn but my husband was raised on that stuff and was craving it one night with his pork chop. The bowl was emptied fast and all 6 kids (ranging in age from 14-2) loved it. Definitly a keeper!

I will DEFINITELY be making this again; it was TO DIE FOR! It's one of those recipes that is more than the sum of it's parts. I made it with cans of corn, as that's what I had on hand. I halved the sugar and used only whole milk, as I thought I had cream but didn't. I'm sure it is even better if you use all the ingredients as listed, but was delicious even without.

I used fresh corn because that’s what I had on hand.  I used less milk 3/4 cup because other reviews mentioned it was runny.  I didn’t use the cheese either.  My family loved this!  I will definitely make this again & again!   Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Scaled for 20 and made in the Instant Pot with glass lid.  Followed the proportions exactly.  Melted butter on low "sauté." Added flour and cooked till bubbly and just began to change color.  Added liquid and whisked.  Added seasoning.  Added corn and mixed.  Stirred in shaved parmesan. Canceled sauté; low "slow cook" 4 hours to show time (pot luck).  Looks perfect now after 30 minutes in slow cooker mode.  Trying not to sample too much.  ;-D

Such a great recipe! I loved canned creamed corn as a kid but this recipe takes it home. It was a such a hit. Added more parm, cause I love parm and it was delicious.

Loved this corn - easy to make and so good.  Plan to make it for our Thanksgiving meal and seriously doubt there will be any left,  but if there is, this corn reheats well in the microwave.

Love to make this. I make on the stove then place in a croc pot. Works out great. My favorite feature on this app is the ability to increase an ingredient amount and all the rest adjust accordingly.

I tried to follow the exactly.  However my heavy cream went bad on me.  So I made the substitution using Evaporated Milk for the Heavy Cream.  It was delicious!  The whole family commented on how good it was!

I used evaporated milk(1 can) the extra I added water for total milk and skipped the cheese and added a tad more sugar. I took some of the corn( used fresh off cob) and put it in blender and found it to be pretty close to what my grandmother use to make. Awesome TY

No kidding they ate the whole thing - found this on ten favorite potluck items.  THis one delivered.  Added more parmesan than called for and the liquid was amazing - could be a great base for corn chowder...

I love this recipe.  I prefer it without the parm.  I always use fresh corn so I can add that yummy milk from the cob.  I keep all measurements exactly the same, but I assemble it in a different order.  I melt my butter in the skillet, and add my corn.  Then I sprinkle  my flour over the corn and stir, I cook it until the flour starts to lose that raw flour taste, then I add the rest of the ingredients, and proceed as written.  I  have never eaten creamed corn from a can.  It doesn’t  even look good.  But I love this!  It’s a nice side for holiday bbq time.  A good change from baked beans and pasta salad.

This was amazing! So much better than any canned cream corn. Easily able to scale it down for smaller group of people.

Yummy, even without the cheese!  I didn’t have Parmesan cheese on hand when I made this and  it was still delicious!

This is an excellent recipe. I couldn't find heavy whipping cream so I had to use the plain whipping cream.  The corn recipe never did thicken up like it does in the video that could be why, not sure but regardless it was still delicious.

I was wanting to make a Mexican tamale recipe but I needed creamed corn and I didn't have acan on hand so I found this recipe. I loved it. It's the best creamed I have ever had! The casserole  was a hugh success also. Thanks for a great recipe.

Ike others, I used half and half instead of heavy cream..still plenty of goodness! I also cut corn of five cobs, sautés the corn in the butter salt and pepper about 7-8 minutes before adding the cream and sugar.

Fantastic! Really tasty and if you put on the slow cooker, really easy! Didn't change a thing except throwing everything in the slow cooker - except for the flour/milk mixture. About 2 hours later I added the roux and then the cheese right before serving. Every single person commented on how much every liked it and some didn't even like cream corn. Love this!

I should have known that a cup of milk and a cup of cream was too much. I had to let this thing simmer for over 45 minutes before it reached a viable consistency. As for flavor, there pretty much is none. Never making this one again.

I used fresh corn from the garden. If you add a can or bag of store-bought corn it gives it a lot more bright yellow kernals mixed in.

The most amazing creamed corn !  I started making this recipe a few years ago and it is now a required dish for Thanksgiving, Christmas and any time we make prime rib.  Everyone loves it and insist I bring it.

First time making creamed corn. Very easy and quick to make. I used canned organic sweet corn and romano cheese instead of frozen corn and parmesan. Still great!

excellent!  first time, something just didn't seem right.  next time used fresh corn scrapped from the cob and made some other changes and was better, but I hate the work of taking the corn off the Cobb.  this last time was the best of both worlds.  did this recipe as is, but doubled everything, I was hungry... then when finished, hit it with stick blender and leaving plenty of whole kernels for the perfect texture. deliciousness!

PERFECTION!
I have made this twice, following exactly. Hands down the best! We go to Rudy's Texas BBQ a lot, and now we have our OWN creamed corn as good, (BETTER in fact) than theirs...ok I am prejudiced, lol. Just served it with the bbq country pork ribs and baked potato. The best bbq meal bar none.

This was excellent! Tweaks-used 7 ears fresh corn, only half and half, no cream, no milk, cut back the cream and milk measurements accordingly (set servings to 7), added little extra flour to the slurry and extra sugar. Outasite and cooked quickly! Notable: I did not add parmesan to this, wanted the real deal, down home Southern creamed corn and this was it! Fabulous.

Fabulous BBQ side dish! I confess to adding a quarter teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the mixture, but that was only because we like a touch of heat. The cream corn would have been just as good without it. Thanks for a really good recipe, Diana Yockey!

I scaled the recipe way down, because I was only cooking for two.  It was simply terrific, and bears no resemblance to the stuff you get in a can.  This is a winning side dish, for sure.

Easy and basic comfort food creamed corn recipe. Made this without the Parmesan and used boiled sweet corn on the cob. Cut off the kernels and threw it in the mix. It tastes awesome. I can’t believe I ate this out of the can growing up. Making it from scratch is waaay better. My toddler is trying new foods and he enjoyed it.

My husband begs for this stuff! I make it pretty much as directed although I do scale back on the amount of whole milk a bit typically using 3/4 cup of 1 or 2% milk and it thickens to my liking perfectly!

This is a hard recipe to rate. I had high expectations because of all the high ratings and rave reviews, and this dish didn't meet them.  I know what "real" cream corn is supposed to taste like, and this wasn't even close. However, my guests for Easter loved it. So, 4 stars it is.

I would give this a 3.5. High marks for ease, lower for taste. If you have time get fresh sweet corn on the cob; cook then remove the kernels with a sharp knife; make sure you cut close enough to get the juice near the cob. Still follow remaining instructions.  THIS is creamed corn.

Great. Cut ingredients in half, used half & half instead of milk or cream. Threw in some parsley at the end.

This wasn’t bad but it wasn’t great...I was anticipating that it would taste terrific after reading all the reviews.  Perhaps I didn’t do something right?  Can’t believe that all the rave reviews were wrong...we love corn, but we just found this kind of blah. Just being honest.

Half of my family is from the south so every BBQ meal HAS to have a side of corn casserole or cream corn. This recipe is so helpful in getting that thick, creamy consistency!! I actually had to take the milk and the heavy cream down 1/4 a cup or so—I put in just enough that the majority of the corn was still poking out from the sauce, but that’s just a preference (it looked too soupy otherwise). I also added a lot more pepper and salt then suggested. I paired this with the Slow Cooker Zesty Chicken BBQ and the Caesar Salad Supreme recipes found on this site. My tummy was doing flips of joy. Thank you!! :)

This recipe deserves six stars, because I didn’t have to dig through the reviews to determine what I should add or modify to make it great. This recipe is PERFECT on its own. For a dish that is easy to make and done in 15 minutes, the taste far surpasses the effort. Everyone in my home loved this and had seconds, including the kids! I forgot the Parmesan cheese but it was still great without. I will absolutely be making this more in the future. Can’t say enough about how good it is!!

I have made this several times; it’s the fantastic side dish to ham; or beef. Today I made it (for work potluck; I work with coworkers that LOVE spicy food I added 1/3 tsp chili powder and an 1/3 tsp of Cajun seasoning. It’s super delicious and has a tiny kick ?? (Triple the recipe)

Amazing! Followed directions, no modifications necessary, very little prep and cook time. My husband is not a picky eater yet has an aversion to Creamed Corn, remnants of his childhood and the infamous canned corn. Accompanying grilled Ribeye and green salad, he politely tried a small bite and loved it! If you don’t have heavy cream on hand you can substitute with milk with full understanding the sauce will not be as creamy

Turns out great! I just add a few tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken it even more. If you do this make sure to mix some with a little cold cream to make a slurry and then pour it in to avoid lumps of cornstarch. The parmesan makes it even better.

i like this recipe, i did make a change to help with a more corn flavor. After the cream thickened,  i spooned 1/4th of the corn mixture in a blender  and poured back into the cream corn pot before adding the cheese.

Personally, I found this a little bland. Added some thyme, a bunch of extra ground pepper and a few pinches of cayenne. With these additions, it was quite good.

No recipe changes made. This was a very elegant side dish that was a huge hit at the Christmas dinner table this year. I did use the frozen corn I had on hand. However, if I can find frozen peg corn that might well make this outstanding recipe even better.  We really like the bite of the peg corn. The texture as is was creamy and substantially thick. I will definitely make this again and will be a great carry in for church suppers.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!!  Made it for Christmas Day dinner along with my husband's famous brisket.  We did it up Texas style this year.  I let it simmer a long time and it did not  really thicken up until I added the parmesan cheese.  Hardly any leftovers!!!  So good!!!

Christmas Eve 2918
This is  the second time I have made this... Yum!! And my guests who have only eaten can creamed corn (yuck) loved it! They wanted the recipe.
I have never eaten creamed corn. I only knew of it out of a can. I can't stand the smell of it and will not allow it in my house.  I don't really know what made me try this recipe but am so happy I did. I can now say I love creamed corn but has to be this one alone!!

This recipe is perfect just the way it is! Very easy and quick.  I am a totally organic cook (where possible) and the clean fresh taste of no chemicals in our food just adds to the flavor.  It is going to be a standard in our home !

I love creamed corn and this recipe is perfect. I don't like the cream cheese ones as they don't taste right to me. I make this a lot. When I get a good batch of corn, I strip the ears and freeze it then make this all year round. If you like creamed corn, this one is the real deal! Oh yeah, I usually forget to add the Parmesan at the end and it is still great.

I gave this recipe to my FIL to make for Thanksgiving for me (we share the cooking for most holidays). it was really yummy. I've added it to my recipe box as a go-to. It had a slight flour taste, but I'll make it myself next time and adjust the recipe as needed to eliminate that. definitely a keeper!

My hairdresser sold me about this recipe. She said her son and family love it. I made it as a side dish for Thanksgiving and it was a hit with my family as well. SO easy to make, no changes necessary. This is a perfect side dish. Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely excellent! I did make one change, I halved the recipe only because I did not have a big enough saucepan (Thanksgiving had all in use). I was afraid it was not enough, so I added 1/2 the 2nd bag of corn. It was PERFECT! I also thought it could have used more salt but left that up to individual taste table side. I will NEVER buy that so called cream corn in a can again~

This is fantastic - easy and creamy! I searched for a corn recipe that didn't require corn muffin mix after realizing my casserole wasn't going to happen without having it on hand...  I'm so glad I found it, and will make it again!

Family loved it and I will definitely make it again! I substituted 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup milk instead of 1 cup milk because I didn’t plan on using cream for anything else so why waste it!  Turned out so creamy!

Definitely the best recipe I've tried for this dish. Only suggestions I have are first to reduce the flour and increase corn meal by that amount. Corn meal adds flavor, uncooked flour tastes like raw flour. Flour does thicken a bit effectively so don't eliminate it completely. Second, add in a bit of cayenne to the milk mixture - a pinch to maybe 1/8 t. The heat comes in after the sweet from the sugar. Adds depth and is unexpected.

I didn’t include to cheese only because I used to recipe to make scalloped corn and didn’t have creamed corn for Thanksgiving.  It was the biggest hit at dinner!!

I put a little parmesan cheese on bottom of crockpot. Poured the cream of corn in and spread the rest of the cheese on top. I put in broiler for a few minutes to get the top crusty.

Wow!! I’ve made this numerous times and it’s delicious!!  I use corn that we blanched and froze during the run of summer sweet corn!  Blanche it, cool it in an ice bath, de-cob the corn, bag it in appropriate size servings and freeze it!  We get a bag of about 50 ears and have sweet corn over the winter, including for this recipe! ????

I love this recipe!  It’s great as is or if you want to heat it up dice some jalapeños and sauté them with Amaretto for a bit of sweat heat flavor. A yearly Thanksgiving tradition in our house.

I made it for a side dish for Thanksgiving in which I used 2pkgs for a total of 31 oz of corn & used the same liquids & only used 1/2 amt of the salt & 1/2 amt of sugar - it came out great.

I love creamed corn, but didn’t want all the nasties from the canned stuff. This is the first time I’ve made it from scratch and I love it. I was a little worried about it being to much liquid at first, but it thickened up nice. I wouldn’t change a thing with this recipe. It’s delicious!

This cream corn is amazing! I tried it with Parmesan and without. Both ways are good. The heavy cream made this to rich for me. I am going to try substituting half n half to see if it will calm the richness down enough for me. Over all a great recipient.

time and again I find someone saying, "this was very Bland. I've come to the conclusion that the reason it's bland is because you don't have very many taste buds and it takes something really spicy to wake them up. Those of us who have a lot of taste buds find the Nuance in this recipe just great.

I followed the directions except I used 1/2 cup of milk.  I also used an immersion blender at the end to mix it a bit more.  I left most of the corn chunky but a few spritzes with the immersion blender made the sauce richer .  My hubby loved it and requested on special occasions.  It's too rich for my taste but if you go for this type of thing, it's a good recipe.

This is an amazing recipe! I used fresh picked corn. It’s easy and ever so delicious.
Made a batch and am freezing some to remind me in the middle of the winter , what corn really tastes like.

This was da bomb! I've made this several times and it's always great.  I'm usually making dinner for 2 so I only use 1 -10 oz bag of corn and halved the other ingredients. I always half and half on hand so used 1 cup of that instead of 1/2 c each of cream and whole milk. I don't usually have Parmesan cheese either , so I use what I do have which is a blend of Asiago, Fontina, Parmesan and Provolone. Thanks for sharing this one.!!

It's good. It's sweet (but that's a good, southern style creamed corn) I used fresh corn, I felt it needed to cook longer, probably why the frozen corn cooks faster, but I had fresh needing to be cooked. I forgot the parm on the original night, put it on the next night with left overs...great either way!

This is great! I followed the recipe except I used fresh corn, because it’s August and I’m in Indiana. I didn’t add the cheese because it’s accompanying meatloaf, because I live in Indiana. I will make it again!

I added garlic, onions and some green onions on the top to add some color; I used gluten free all purpose flour and didn’t use any sugar. Love it.

First I have to say two things. 1) I have never rated a recipe; just never really found one that was THAT good, or THAT bad!  :-)
2) I got on the internet today, not in search of a creamed corn recipe, but in search of a great Mexican Cornbread recipe. Which I found....but it calls for....you got it (but I didn't!) creamed corn!  Which led me here.  Am I am so glad this recipe makes more than I need for the Mexican Cornbread! Because while the rest of my supper is cooking, I'll continue to "sample" this absolutely delicious creamed corn! I didn't add anything and I didn't take anything out. I made this recipe exactly as written and it is perfection!

Totally awesome,Just made it with local corn that I picked and thought was too tough. I also used brown natural sugar and brown flower and it came out great.  I skipped the Parmesan because that can get gooey and stick to your spoon.  Nice simple recipe, I made it while talking on the phone.

Amazing. I made it gluten free and lactose free. Used gluten free flour (President's Choice) and 2% lactose free milk for both dairy adds. I skip the parm too. My husband is obsessed!

This was spot on.  I needed a tablespoon more flour (I wanted it thicker).   But my husband who I gave a spoonful to try, decided he wanted a bowl before dinner.   This is going to be my fresh corn pick recipe.  I made  and bag eight  two cup bags out of 18 ears of corn.  Thank you for this easy recipe.

I loved this simple recipe. I wanted to make it more like fresh creamed corn the changes were simple.  I reduced the milk and cream to 2/3 cup each and started the recipe buy adding the butter, cream, sugar, pepper, salt, and 1/3cup on corn kernels and used an immersion blender to make a corn puree. Then continued the recipe as usual.  It tasted like fresh creamed corn!!

Oh my goodness this is good! I received some freshly cut off the cob corn today and, upon looking at several recipes, came across this one and am so happy I did! As I didn’t have any “heavy cream” as the recipe called for, I substituted a cup of canned milk. Other than this substitution, I followed the recipe exactly. I was so surprised it called for adding Parmesan cheese, but I did and W.O.W.! It was delicious. Hubby could not get enough of this delightful dish and I now have it saved to my favorites. YUM!

This is the BEST cream corn! I was looking for a recipe that was similar to a local BBQ restaurant who recently stopped selling cream corn. This is identical to what they made. Everyone loved the dish. I made it exactly as written. Definitely a keeper!!!

This recipe is a MAJOR crowd pleaser. I didn’t change one dang thing with the exception of a bit  of a brush with the chili powder jar, and some garnish level paprika. Make this puppy. It’s easy, quick, and you won’t make enough.......guaranteed!!!!!!

I use sweet corn instead of sugar and add bacon and jalapenos. I use bacon fat instead of butter. I also cook it in cast iron on the grill, Always a hit and requested at every bbq. Great base recipe.

Delicious!! Just make sure that you don’t get frozen corn with sugar in it so it won’t be too sweet. This is probably the best creamed corn I have ever made and tasted.

Used 1 can of corn because it’s all I had. Also subbed 2% milk for whole milk and only used 1/4 of all the sauce mixture ingredients to make the sauce. I took half the corn/sauce mixture out of my pot and blended it with my immersion blender and then mixed it all back together for texture preference. Really tasty!

This recipe was a big hit with my extended family as an Easter side dish.  I made exactly as written - it worked great using ~3/4 of a 32oz bag of frozen corn.  I thawed in a pot full of water on the stove top for a few minutes then added the sauce ingredients.  There were no leftovers!

We make this every holiday and there’s never much left over. We do add a little white pepper and in addition to the Parmesan in the corn we add it on top and it in the broiler for a couple minutes, it is the best!

I made this for  people that don't like "creamed corn". They've only had it from the can. Everyone loved it. My five year old refused to try it. His loss. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was fantastic.

I made this, not really liking cream corn.  I got to say there could not possibly be a cream corn any better. My 82 year old dad says it’s the best he’s ever had. Don’t change a thing!  Delish!

this stuff is addicting I can eat it just by itself. I add a handful of minced onion that I sauteed up and bacon....Real bacon not bacon bits... it is ridiculously good. and I don't use frozen corn except for the winter. If it's in the grocery store I use corn on the cob. I don't cook it first I just cut it right off the cob and use it. This is one of my favorite recipes I could eat it everyday

I gave this 5 stars becuase it is hard to take so few simple ingred and turn it into something so good.  I had very low expectations as I don't like creamed corn, but this recipe changed my mind.  I used evap milk in place of the cream and it was not runny at all.  I also used corn starch instead of flour.  I left out the cheese and cut the sugar in half.  It was wonderful and my family loved it.

This was delicious!  I cut my recipe in half and used frozen sweet corn. I did add a little more corn as it cooked for a thicker consistency. Worked out great!  Seconds were had by everyone. I’ll be preparing this again for my family.

Big hit as a side to my steak n lobster. Zinged it up w garlic powder, touch of smoked paprika, touch of smoked chipotle chili powder. Actually forgot to add the parm cheese and it still tasted great.

This is so much better than canned cream corn. I made it out of desperation when I bought canned corn by accident when I need creamed corn for my recipe.  I then realized I didn't have whole milk, but I did have buttermilk so I used it instead. It added a really good, interesting slight tang that I loved  I also used smoked pepper (twice what recipe called for) and it was EXCELLENT.       I think even if you stick with original recipe it would still be far better than store bought canned. Definitely worth trying this recipe.

I thought it was pretty good, though nothing special like I expected from the rave reviews. I made it for a Christmas gathering and it just wasn’t a hit. Made according to recipe, no changes.

Made it for 1st time last Christmas & it was a huge. I had to double the recipe this year & folks were still wanting more! Perfect as is however this year I used more black pepper & added garlic powder to kick it up a notch.

Best creamed corn ever. People at Christmas dinner who don't partularly like creamed corn raved over this decadent dish, asking for the recipe. Had it sit warming before our party about an hour, making it thicker and creamier. This will be a regular staple now at our house.

I found this recipe and made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas for 2 different groups of people.  I followed the recipe as stated.  Several compliments about the corn on both days.  I will be making this again for sure!

Simply amazing. I can not describe the flavor, must try. Will make over and over again. All ingredients the same, but I threw it in the crock pot for four hours on low and added 1tbs cornstarch (mixed with 1tbs of the hot corn liquid and then added) to thicken near the end.

I absolutely this recipe.      I add a little bit more pepper and Parmesan cheese than what it calls for.   Excellent flavor either way.    Going to try it in the crock pot for Christmas.

Followed some tips to use only a half cup of milk (used 2%) and also used half and half instead of heavy cream. I was out of Parmesan cheese, but would love to try that next time.  My picky husband LOVED this dish. (I added a little more pepper to my portion, but that’s just my weird personal preference!). Thanks for this delicious recipe, it was a hit!

Excellent and simple! Would never go back to canned cream corn after tasting this. Made it to add to Brunswick Stew instead of using canned cream corn. Added depth and richness to the stew that garnered praise and requests for when I could make it again.

Turned out awesome! No need to use all of the butter and cream it calls for; still tastes great either way. The parm is a nice touch and I sprinkled it fresh just before serving for the best flavor

Literally the easiest recipe ever. I substituted the heavy cream with condensed milk only because that's what I had on hand, and it was still delicious. I was concerned that it wouldn't be thick enough because of that change, but the flour makes ALL the difference. You get a thick cream of corn without having to overdo it with the heavy cream (or whatever substitution you use). If you're already thinking about it, then you must try this.

I don't get some people. I searched for creamed corn and that's what I found. This recipe was delicious. Of course, I wasn't prepared fully and didn't have any milk. Since I use cream in my tea, I was covered. I used 1 1/2 cups and then 1/2 cup of water. I also omitted the Parmesan because I detest the stuff. I loved this! It was simple, it was delicious, and it is definitely going in the repeat bin.

This is a great recipe! I doubled the flour to make it nice and thick - Adding about another 1/4 cup of milk while it cooked. Then I added another splash of freshly ground black pepper after the flour cooked to get a little bit brighter flavor. Also, I did not use any cheese. It tastes great and my house smells amazing.

This creamed corn is fantastic!  I have made it a couple of times. The first time I made it, the flavor was  good but I thought it was too runny. So, I made it again as a side for Thanksgiving. I mixed the flour and milk but only used half.  It was the perfect consistency for me. This is a keeper for sure!

K, person requesting, ate, but didn't rave about this.  As the most helpful review, I subbed with half & half so thickened with 3Ts flour, not 2.

This recipe is fantastic! I have never liked creamed corn. My husband likes creamed corn, particularly from expensive steak houses. I was hoping to wow him with this recipe for Thanksgiving but never thought I’d eat it. My husband convinced me to add a small can of green chiles and double the amount of Parmesan cheese. This was already a good dish but the chiles sent it through the roof. Thank you for giving me a dish that when I prepare it my husband would rather eat it then go out to a fancy dinner. Thank you!

This recipe was fantastic!  Even my kids that don’t like creamed corn loved it.  I didn’t add Parmesan cheese .  Yummy with or without!

This was a favorite at Thanksgiving. I puréed half of the corn (slightly) to give the dish a more creamy texture. I also sprinkled 1/4 cup shaved Parmesan on top and put it under the broiler until golden before serving. Delicious!

Made it for Thanksgiving. It was wonderful! Made it exactly as written, including the Parmesan. I’m not a cheese eater. I tasted it before and after putting in the cheese. I vote cheese! Doesn’t taste cheesy but has a subtle taste. I like most everyone else who made it won’t ever use canned again. IF there are any leftovers I’m going to use it in shrimp chowder. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Extremely delicious! My changes: • made heavy cream using almond milk • no cheese • 2 cans (30oz total) corn • a little less sugar • 1/2c almond milk • made a roux • used an immersion blender

I made a half batch but doubled the Parmesan and added a few dashes of cayenne and it was delicious!  I also used half and half instead of cream and it turned out just great.

I first found this recipe a couple of years ago, it wad such a great hit I've made it everu year since. I do however at 1 ingredients, that is bacon. I cook the bacon extra crispy and sprinkle it ontop and add some of the bacon grease directly to the cream corn. It helps thickening the cream corn and adds a wonderful flavor too. when you first add it, it look like it's curdling the heavy cream and milk but if you stir it in, it blends well together. don't know about health, but it tastes delicious.

The only change I made was using half & half in place of both the heavy cream and milk because it's what I had on hand. I was asked to bring creamed corn to a dinner at my daughter's in-laws.  I had never made creamed corn before and this recipe made me look like a pro! I was asked to make it to bring to their Thanksgiving meal!

Just made it and was incredibly easy. Halved the salt but left everything the same. Cooked it longer than recommended to thicken it properly. Hubby who wanted a creamed corn dish for Thanksgiving said it was sooooo good! Have made it a day ahead put it in a microwave oven proof dish to warm tomorrow. We always think it tastes better on second day.

While I've made this before with cream corn from a can, this time I used a can of whole kernel corn (15.25oz).  Didn't use the milk, used heavy whipping cream (1 c), the sugar, salt, butter and flour.  In the past, I've always sauteed a green pepper and whole sweet onion in the pan with a splash of water in the bottom so it doesn't burn, then stirred in drained corn.  The final step is to use some high quality American cheese, about 6 slices to flavor, adding a shake of garlic salt.  The corn pops unlike the canned cream corn, yet still has the thickness and sweet of good creamed corn.

Made this for my daughters Girl Scout Troop’s potluck thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. She came home saying that everyone raved about it. Followed the recipe exactly and It was soupy at first but I just kept it simmering on the stove and it thickened up nicely - probably about 15-20 min of simmering. The corn stayed a little crispy too so gave it a nice texture. I actually made it the day before and then put it in Tupperware. Right before the meeting i threw it back in the skillet and simmered again for about 10 min and it got back it’s texture/warmed up perfectly. I’m not a big fan of creamed corn but it was delicious and felt fresher than most creamed veggies.

Have made this exactly as written and my variations too many times to count. So good and creamy! When my office has potlucks this is the only thing I’m allowed to bring now. Easily doubled or tripled. I have even thrown everything into the crockpot not as thick but tastes just as good!

Really delicious, WAY better than that nasty canned stuff. Only thing is using 4 ears of fresh corn instead of frozen makes this even better. Corn is crisper this way.

Excellent! I only added garlic salt, and changed the cheese to pepper jack and american cheese. Did not follow all the measurements, just eyed it as I was only making for three. Easy and simple recipe that I would make again. Yum!!!!

Love this recipe! It is so quick and easy to make. Everyone in my family loves it. It is definitely not for those who want to watch calories though! With heavy cream and parmesan cheese it makes for a bit of an indulgence, but it is totally worth it! I will be making this at every big turkey dinner from now on!

I made this for lunch today and it was wonderful. The only thing I did differently was to use my immersion blender and break up the corn a bit. My grandkids were eating with us and I felt it would be easier for my 1and 2 year old grandkids to eat. lol And they did too, everyone went back for seconds including me!

Everyone I've made this for has raved about it. Submitter is right....it's nothing like canned cream corn. It's amazingly delicious.

This was, hands down, THE best creamed corn recipe. It's nothing like the canned version I grew up with.  Corn kernels are whole, sweet and carry their sweetness into the rich sauce. I used a combination of half and half and full fat milk because that was what I had on hand. Because the sweet corn was so sweet I omitted the sugar. Otherwise cooked it as suggested.  The dish was so sweet it was almost a dessert. Will definitely use this again with all the corn I just froze!

Little too sweet and a little too salty, but still addictively delicious! Next time half the salt and half the sugar, but there will be a next time...very soon.

This was the best corn I've ever had!!!! I'm proud of myself and everyone loved it!!!! We ran out and all wanted more!! I used 1 can of cream of corn and 1 can regular corn and only 1/2 cup of the milk instead of the whole (since I used one can of cream of corn) & I did not use the whipping cream either and it turned out excellent but next time I'll try the way the actual recipe says. If u cool it the way I did it will seem loose (not thick) but give it time it will thicken up

I made some changes to this recipe..I used the fresh corn, 1-8 oz  cream cheese, 3/4 stick of real butter,  1/2 c of almond milk, garlic powder, salt, pepper & 1 TBSP of sugar. Mixed it up poured into a lightly sprayed pyrex dish and baked on 350 for 20minutes. Stirring twice. The hubby & 4 grandsons loved it.

Delicious as the recipes calls for.  My Hubble suggested as we had had in a restaurant Jalapeño Cream Corn.  I think that could be made by adding chopped jalapeños.

Pretty good recipe but a bit lacking on instructions. I used another recipe to fill in the blanks. I melted the butter in a non-stick saucepan THEN Incorporated corn and spices. I was a little worried after adding the milk as it looked like too much liquid but after about 6 minutes the mixture started to thickened. Promptly from the heat and added some freshly grated parmegiano regiano. Delicious!

PS: Cooked half of the recipe and used a can of corn, instead of frozen.

Really really good! My family loves it and it is super easy to make. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the recipes calls for a lot of liquid, so it's a little soupy. Next time I make it I'll cut back on the liquid to corn ratio. Other than that it's fabulous!!!

This is an excellent recipe for corn. I used five ears of fresh corn  and sautéed the kernels in the butter for 10 minutes and then followed the rest of the recipe. I also added 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme.  Will definitely make again!

I've never been a fan of cream corn from a can so I tried this recipe and we really like it.  I've made the recipe several times as written but the last time I made it I used fresh corn.  My daughter gave me a corn stripper which makes it easy getting the corn off the cob.  I used six ears of corn (4 cups) and I like the recipe better using fresh corn instead of frozen.

I honestly haven't made this recipe yet but plan to soon.  The last reviewer (I checked out latest reviews) said the garlic was too strong and they didn't like the celery salt either.  Where in the recipe did they see either garlic or celery salt???
I will submit another review when I actually make the recipe and get feed back from my family.
Wish people wouldn't judge a recipe based on their own alterations to it.

The garlic is too strong for this recipe and I didn't care for the celery salt either. 2 more tablespoons of flour makes it thicker more like a casserole and I added cinnamon and it was much better.

Every good. Substituted half & half for the milk/cream & used canned corn instead. Almost forgot the Parmesan & it makes a huge difference in flavor so definitely don't forget that part. I probably used a little more than the recipe called for but we really like cheese.

This is the BEST creamed corn recipe I've ever tried! I made it last year for a family get-together, and have been requested to make it for every family gathering/holiday since. It's such an easy recipe to make. When it's done I pour it into a crockpot for easy travel, and once I arrive at my destination I turn it on low or warm so it's ready to eat whenever we are.

I made this tonight and it truly was delicious!! Super easy and quick.  My family gobbled it up and now will be one of my go to corn dishes!!!   I did use half and half instead of the whole milk because that is what I had on hand.   I also added jalapeños to half because my husband loves spicy dishes. Highly recommend!!

I used this in a cornbread recipe and it worked great!  Used canned corn with no problem and milk instead of cream.  Thanks!

Really easy and very delicious.  I used fresh corn from four leftover ears of corn from last night's BBQ, so I halved the recipe.  I added a small amount of chopped red bell pepper, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I would definitely make again.

We have a barbecue place here in Texas and we all loooooooooove their creamed corn.....tomorrow we are going to a family Barbecue and I was tempted to stop at Rudy's to get creamed corn until I stumbled across this recipe... I made it tonight and gave a little bowl for the man to try "This is amazing squeeze box"   Only thing I changed was made it a little bit thicker.  I doubled the recipe and I didn't feel like four tablespoons made it quite thick enough ( but I added a little bit more flour and it's perfect)  I dare to say just as good as Rudy's

I can't help but to compare this to fresh creamed corn, to which, of course, there is no comparison.  This doesn't taste like creamed corn; mostly soupy milk/flour mixture.  I think perhaps if I'd used shoestring corn instead of whole kernel, the texture would have been more like authentic creamed corn.  Mine is more like chowder.  Two tablespoons of flour just isn't enough to thicken.  Sorry to be critical, but this was a bust for me.

I love creamed corn and hate that I don't know what's in the versions for purchase in the store!  I made this recipe because it included ingredients that I have in my kitchen. I did use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and it was perfect - across my family we've made it 4 times already - we love it - thanks for sharing it!

This has become one of my favorites.  I use canned white shoepeg corn, just 1/2 cup of milk, just 1 tsp of sugar, and a bit more shredded parm cheese.  It's delicious.

Flavor was nice, but I'vd had to use a cornstarch slurry both times I've made it because it wouldn't thicken on its own.

Enjoyed by a large group at our annual boat club fish fry.  Increased serving size to 12 (handy aspect of program).  My husband wanted me to add bacon bits which I did.  Zipped it up a bit??. Certainly will be making this again.

This was super delicious! I did find the corn/cream ratio a little off. You could probably use 1.5:1 corn/cream ratio. As well, you could probably use whole milk, light cream or half and half without losing any creaminess, and losing some calories, as this certainly isn't the healthiest side dish. Overall, I really liked it! It was a hit for dinner.

The end result is very tasty. It took me a lot longer than 15 minutes because I had to leave it on the heat for quite awhile for the cream to get thick enough to my satisfaction.

This is really good, much better than canned. Feeling that corn is sweet enough as it is, I did not add the sugar, nor did I add the cheese. However, it is marvelous, despite my tastes in salt running towards "more" constantly. Yum.

Delicious recipe, although I modified it a bit.  I pureed about 1/4 of the chowder, then placed it back in the pot , and I added basil to taste.

, I was expecting this to be exaggerated. Well it's not! I would say reduce sugar to taste (or at it at the end).

I was in the middle of making a corn casserole when I discovered I didn't have any canned cream corn. So I found this recipe and whipped it up. It was sooooo delicious I hated to put it in the casserole. I put it in the casserole anyway and it was excellent. Now I can't wait to make this creamed corn again and eat it just as it is. Highly recommend this recipe!!!!

I am not  fond of  cream corn and neither is my son.  Rather than pay an exorbitant amount for 3 quarts of cream corn from Rudy's, I decided to save money and make it myself. This recipe was great, easy to make and everyone at the Christmas dinner enjoyed it.

This is amazing as written. I made this and didn't have any parmesan cheese. It didn't need it. I decided to double the recipe for 8 people and I was so glad I did, it was such a hit that one of the guys who doesn't like creamed veggies had 2 servings. I wouldn't change a thing and if I have parm cheese next time will add it. Some of the reviews mention taking out some corn to blend with an immersion blender but I wouldn't bother with it. If you want to have the corn mushed up like it is in a can then open a can.

I followed the recipe and it came out AMAZING! I made it as a side dish to bring for Thanksgiving with relatives. Every year we bring creamed corn from Honey Baked Ham Cafe and this year I dropped the ball and was scrambling the night before. I found this recipe and hit the grocery store. It was super easy to follow (I used canned whole kernel) but the BEST part was everyone LOVED it and said it was way better than Honey Baked Ham Cafe. Win!

I have made this on two separate occasions for family holiday gatherings. This recipe was a big hit both times. I followed the recipe exactly except I used canned corn instead of frozen and wouldn’t suggest any changes. Super easy to make and so much better than reheating canned cream corn.

I made two changes, My packages of frozen corn were 12 oz. so I used the full 24 oz. of corn.  My husband loves black pepper in his creamed corn so I put in 1 full tsp. of black pepper.  I mixed up all the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, pepper) along with the milk, butter and cream and cooked them altogether, stirring constantly which then produced the cream sauce and then I added the corn (still frozen) and cooked it on medium low heat until the corn was heated through.  The result was a big hit.

Really great! I was weary of this recipe because of the reviews that said it was just corn in a cream sauce but it is more than that! It's thick and creamy and oh so good. I took abut 1/3 of it and blended in food processor to try and emulate our favorite restaurants creamed corn. The flavor and texture was like corn chowder ! Sill definitely make again!!

Had this for dinner tonight 12/5/16 with a few modifications...
1.) I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and whole milk.
2.) I used Splenda instead of Sugar.
3.) I used fresh frozen corn.
4.) I used whole wheat flour.
This turned out excellent, very creamy almost like a white sauce gravy.

Really good. A little to runny though. I followed recipe exactly. Some guests thought it was corn chowder. The flavor was good though.

Family loved it and it was easy to make!   I used white pepper instead of black pepper; and next time, I would use a little less sugar (I used organic white sugar, and it was a little too sweet), but still very good.

Wow- easy, easy, easy! Made it in 10 mins and served it hot. I used NO sugar and added thyme, salt and pepper instead. And used fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Amazing.

Great tip right here that changes everything: after it has set in the crockpot for maybe an hour or so, take half of your corn mixture and pulse it in the blender and then pour it back in with the rest of the corn in the crockpot. Continue to simmer for however many hours you want. Perfect consistency for creamed corn!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! My mom isn't a big creamed corn fan and even she liked it. It did take longer than states to get the right consistently of the creme. I will be making this again!

This was so good and was a real hit! It didn't get as thick as I expected but I'm not sure if I didn't whisk the flour and milk right or if I just wasn't patient enough. Either way it didn't matter because it was still really good.

PERFECT recipe loved it. Straightforward and simple. I did however tweek it a little to meet my own preferences. I reduced the amount of sugar by half and increased the salt. as I like my sweet corn not so sweet. Ha Ha. I put only half the amount of milk and flour and covered the lid and let it cook at low for 15 minutes. When I opened it, it was done with the perfect balance with a slight crunch to the corn which my boyfriend loved!

As some others have stated, this came out very runny for me.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using 1% milk as I didn't have whole milk.  If that made the difference, it was QUITE a difference.  I cooked quite a bit longer than stated in hopes it would thicken up more.  Served in bowls.  Taste was just OK. No one raved over it or took seconds.

I followed it exactly but decided to blend 2 cups worth of the corn mixture towards the end so that there were whole kernels as well as mushy kernels :-)

Really tasty and complimented the Thanksgiving lunch.

This was a last minute side dish made for Thanksgiving and I'm so glad I made it! I didn't have heavy cream so I used half n half instead then added  an extra 3/4 Tbsp. of flour so it would have a thicker consistency. It turned out great and will definitely make it again!

I tried it a few years ago and it is no a holiday favorite.  Even my non-corn eaters love it.  I make it ahead, leaving out the cheese.  Next day when I reheat i add the cheese.  It is always thick and creamy.  Great recipe!  I tend to play around with recipes, but this one has been great as is.  I suppose you good experiment with different cheese.... :o)

I've made this over a dozen times, with these new adjustments:  use the half the amount of milk and heavy cream.  A little less sugar.  No parmesan cheese.  *Be sure not to skip the mix flour and milk step. *  My husband and young boys love it!  I always make extra so that we can have leftovers, but there's almost never any left on the table.

OMG!!!!  This is the most delicious recipe I have made from this site.  Hubby thought it looked like a lot for just the 2 of us, but we had very little left over - DELISH!!!!!  Thanks so much for posting.  Made it as written using GOOD Parmesan (not the  in the green can).  Only added some garlic powder because Hub and I put garlic in everything!

Made this for my pre-thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it, however, I felt the cream was too runny. Definitely needed a slotted spoon to serve. Doesn't seem like any others on here had this issue, if anything, some said too thick so not sure where I went wrong. Will try again because it was a hit and tasted great!

This IS the best corn recipe ever! I let it simmer a little more then their 15 minutes to cooking it. Great recipe and my husbands family thought it was out of this world, made it and it was all gone within minutes! 
My husband is a farmer and he has a vast amount of corn crop so I always use FRESH sweet corn right from the fields! 
Just amazing!

My entire extended family LOVES this creamed corn. The kids beg for it every thanksgiving and christmas. In fact they asked for it on July 4th. I used whole kernel corn from the can and it comes out great, this creamed corn recipe is sweet but thats how we like it.

Awesome receipt, I used this in the Corn Bread  made and got rave reviews from all who ate both. The homemade cream corn is what really gave the bread a great texture and flavor.

Yummy!  I made this classic Southern dish for my daughter's family, living in California.  The recipe makes a lot of yummy cream sauce, so I threw in a 3rd pkg of frozen corn kernals.  I did omit the Parmesan cheese, but will add that the next time around.  To everyone's surprise, even the picky 2 yr old begged for more! We all loved it!

Awesome!  For dietary and allergy reasons I substituted whole milk for the heavy cream and did not use any parmesan.  The corn was fresh from our garden that day though and I'm sure that enhanced the flavor somewhat over the frozen corn.

I made this using 4 tbls butter, because i love butter, and along with the flour i added 1 Tbls cornstarch.  It was amazingly good. 
my son said he didn't' like cream corn, I said you have to taste it. he then got a bowl for himself.  it is that good. I forgot to put in the Parmesan cheese, i will add next time i make it. 
overall this is the bomb!!!!

Made it to precise recipe and it was amazing... Then I cheated with a little more salt, a little less sugar, more cream, less milk, more and less pepper... Not because I wanted it to be better but because I'm sloppy with recipes... Every version has been amazing... And I grew up HATING cream corn... This is just a really simple but tasty base for making a side with some tang and interest... Try it or something close)...

I can't figure out how anyone could give this a low rating. If you're looking for a true creamed corn like served in a good Bbq joint, this is it! Only change I made is I used 1% milk instead of whole and I actually used fresh corn off the cob but I'm sure it'd be fine with frozen as well.  Easy and Perfect!!

Used fresh corn, scraping the cob to get all the 'milk'.  Really makes a difference.  It really is so much better than canned. No leftovers at all.

I just thought this tasted bland. It's not bad, just blaugh.Maybe it's because eat elote and this sounds like it without the mayo. To zap it up we added green chilis and some chili powder and it was okay...not great.

I've tried several recipes from this site.  A lot of them do not meet my expectations, but this one did.  Didn't do anything different than the recipe called for.  Everyone loved it, and we all saved the recipe.  Anyway I loved the corn just as the recipe directed!  Thanks for sharing!

You will NEVER buy canned cream corn again after  you make this. I followed the directions exactly, except I had to use skim instead of whole milk to mix with flour. This will be a repeat side dish for sure in this house. I like this most because of its consistency. My 13 year old said she could eat it by itself.

If I could give this recipe 100 stars I would. It is THAT GOOD! People gobble this up like crazy and literally come up to you to tell you just how good it was. I love making this. As is- recipe is delicious. Now, when I make it I use 3/4 cup half and half instead of  1 cup cream because I always have half and half in my house. I bring the amount down to 3/4 because half and half is runnier. I tend to leave the parmesan cheese out because it's more of an overall crowd pleaser without. Instead, I am heavy handed with the sugar! YUM

Ok, so I've made this a few times. As is, the recipt e is decent. However, here's what I did to make it better. 1) I added more flour. Probably a good 3 tbsp. We like it thicker. 2) I added diced green peppers and chili powder. We like a little spice. 3) I added its about 3 more tbsp of sugar. The increased spice and sweetness is awesome together. 

I cooked it down for a bit until pretty thick.

This is great as is but I added some sautéed garlic and onion. Doubled the Parmesan. Made the mistake of transferring to a crockpot on the warm setting. It made the corn lose some of its crunch.

We loved it!  I boiled fresh corn and cut it off the Cobb, then scraped the "milk" out of the cobs into the corn with the dull side of the knife.  Everything else was true  to the recipe, except added a tad of cayenne pepper.  Gone in minutes!   Served with pork ribs and baked beans. Keeper!

Exactly like my grandmothers creamed corn. The only change I made was using seasoned pepper in place of the black and used left over corn sliced from the ears.  It came out so delicious ,  I let it come to a full boil to thicken and then immediately turned the heat down.

Man oh man is this ever delicious! Hubby brought home some cream and I had cooked corn on the cob left over from a family gathering so I decided to try this recipe. I made it just as the recipe states. It truly is fantastic, and it didn't take long to make even though I cut the corn off their cobs. Try it, you won't be sorry!

I sautéed an onion and a half of an orange bell pepper in some butter, garlic and seasoned salt.  Made a roux with the 3 tablespoons of flour and equal butter, put it to the side.  Microwaved 4 bags of 10 oz sweet corn.  1 of the bags I put in blender with a few splashes of milk and puréed it.  Transferred all of the corn into pot with onion and bell pepper.  Put my heavy cream into the corn.  Mixed in Parmesan cheese into corn, way more than stated.  Mixed in 3 tablespoons of cream cheese, with my roux into corn, seasoned to taste.  I left sugar out, I thought the sweet corn made it sweet enough.  Put all the corn into oven and topped it with remaining Parmesan cheese for an half an hour to brown the top.  I didn't think the dish needed all the milk so, I left that out as well.  I made this for a side dish for a party.  I liked it but I knew it wouldn't appeal to everyone just because a lot of my family aren't into the white creamy looking dishes.  The dish came out looking more rich and creamy without all the milk being used, which I prefer anyways.

I really didn't expect it to be this good. But I'm glad I was wrong. It was delicious. And I will be making this again I did use less sugar because I don't like things too sweet but it was just perfect.

The half & half and milk CURDLED.  It looked disgusting, but tasted great.  The nest time I make it, I'll cook the corn in water; drain the water.   Then, add the other ingredients.  Gently cook, not boil, is the way.

This is a fairly simple and tasty  recipe. I let it cook longer than the recipe recommended because otherwise it would have turned out runny. The sauce was good and thick but it had a flour taste to it. I might try making it with cornstarch next time.

This corn is the best thing since indoor plumbing! I use half the milk  and heavy cream. With the butter and flour I make a light brown roux. Lastly i add in some hot chili sauce to give it a little kick.

Nice and simple comfort food. Not much that can go wrong with a cream, butter, cheese, and sugar based recipe!

I thought this recipe was super easy and quick. My family and I gave this corn five stars because it is so delicious that we are comparing it to Rudy's BBQ creamed corn! One more recipe for the book that makes me look like a super chef according to my little ones! I have added it to our list of favs!

FANTASTIC!!!! Just wish I would have doubled the recipe!!! The only thing I did differently was a a little more flour to make it slightly thicker.

Great recipe! Family loved it. I substituted half & half for the heavy cream & 1% milk for the whole milk, added 1/3 cup of chive & onion cream cheese & it turned out very cream and delicious. Will be making this one again.

I will always make this corn, my family depends on this for every holiday...however I don't add the cheese.  We grew up eating lots of cream corn, but my mom and grandma never used any cheese. Everyone looks forward to this corn.

I didn't have any heavy cream or half & half, but I was making it with fried chicken and had some leftover buttermilk. Subbed 1/4 cup of buttermilk for the heavy cream and added another tablespoon of sugar to balance the sourness of the new ingredient. My dad doesn't like creamed corn and he thought it was a hit! I really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again. So simple and quick to make...perfect for a little change-up to the normal side dishes!

This is an excellent recipe! For those having issues, keep in mind that, like many ingredients, not all heavy cream is created equal. If you find that consistency is off, try another brand of heavy cream (a heavy whipping cream works very well) and make sure you allow it to simmer for more than just a few minutes so that the cream and flour can do its thing (my last batch simmered almost 30 minutes).

Also, freshly ground pepper is quite different from the pre-ground junk they sell in bulk at the supermarket that has lost the majority of its potency before you use it.

Lastly, make sure the parmesean cheese is truly fresh-grated. If you buy the cheese in a bag or pre-grated, corn starch is often an ingredient and corn starch + an already thickened sauce is going to result in a lumpy gelatin like consistency.

Followed recipe and can say that I really liked the taste.  I have never made creamed corn due to hating the ones from a can that I had tried earlier.  Probably could get away with a bit less heavy cream but it is not necessary to change anything from the original post.

Delicious recipe.  
I made this for Christmas eve dinner.  I didn't use the parmesan cheese and it was a bit runny without it.  I'm sure the cheese would have thickened it up a bit, but I didn't want the parmesan flavor.  I would make again without the cheese but I would lower either the milk or cream amounts.  A wonderful and easy recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

this was a hit, very delicious . the only change i made was that i put half the corn in the food processor for about 5 seconds just to give it more of classic cream corn texture.

This was great creamed corn enjoyed by several very good cooks and others--ha! ha!  I opted to use half and half and 1% milk and it still was excellent.  It's quick to make so was great for the holiday meal with prime rib.  I will make this for every day meals as well!

Made as instructed.  Tasted AMAZING! I would only try to decrease the amount of creamy texture next time. It was great, but I think a bit less cream and it would be perfect.

I have never been a fan of creamed corn.  I admit I hadn't had it a lot in the past but didn't think much of it when I tried it.  I ran across this recipe and new that my boyfriend had mentioned that he liked it and I thought I would give it a try.  We really liked it.  The flavor was very good.  I did add an extra 10 ounces of corn because I thought to be a bit soupy as written but the flavor profile really worked.

Made this for Christmas dinner last year and it was a big hit. Can't wait to make it again tonight - It's a new tradition.

I have made this recipe several times before. This time I had corn on the cob, that I cut and used it instead of frozen.

I've made this a few times now during holidays and it's always good. You'll never want to eat canned cream corn again after this. I usually omit the parmesan cheese since I like it on the sweeter side. I've also found I need to add more flour or a little bit of cornstarch if it's not thickening fast enough or it ends up soupier. This makes a lot, but it's an easy recipe to cut in half.

Will make it again!  It's the first Creamed Corn recipe I've had that doesn't leave someone feeling like they ate a can of corn and chugged it down with whipping cream.  Loads of compliments from people like me who normally don't like creamed corn.

This recipe was great! The only subs I made were using evaporated milk because it's what I had on hand, adding more sugar because I'm addicted to sweets , and using a dried Parmesan mix because it's what I had. As I added this dish as a last minute side.

I gave this recipe to my daughter for Thanksgiving.  She wanted to make creamed corn.  My daughter DOES NOT cook.   I'm not joking.  The creamed corn was wonderful, she said it was easy to make, she made it two days ahead and we reheated it.  It came out wonderful.   Guess who be bringing creamed corn to all the family gatherings now.  It thickened up when we reheated it and it was just right.  Not soupy.

I inadvertently omitted the Parmesan cheese and didn't realize it until later. I added 1tbsp of prepared cornstarch paste to thicken it a bit. The result was a Thanksgiving dinner hit that's VERY close in flavor and texture to Rudy's cream corn.
 Rudy's is just a little bit sweeter tasting to me.

A tad too sweet for my liking, but the family gave it rave reviews. Since we're already using sweet corn, next time I'll try leaving out the sugar.

I added 1/4 of a cream cheese block.  Added only a 1/4 cup milk .  1 tablespoon cornstarch.  And about 3 more tablespoons of sugar.  No parmigiana.  Added more salt as well.

Oh my gosh, I made it to take to thanksgiving dinner, I added real bacon pieces to it while cooking the corn. This is a dish I will make again, I fried the corn in some butter first added bacon pieces and cooked with the corn, I also added a little extra cream and parm cheese. Very tasteful

Awesome!!!This is now requested for every family gathering. You will not regret trying this recipe. If you thought you didn't like creamed corn you will change your mind. Nothing like that stuff from a can. Best if you use corn cut off the cob.

I added a little more salt and may consider using slightly less sugar next time because I like my savory... but it was really a great recipe! You could adjust the ratios a bit to make the consistency just how you like. :)

I have used this one for thanksgiving in the past and everyone loves it. I use half and half by choice and add sugar to taste depends on the corn. I don't do the Parmesan just because not a flavor I think goes with thanksgiving.

This has been a holiday staple in our family now for several years...since I found it.  I love to add a little extra cheese to it.  It's great left over as well.  And my grown daughter now makes it for any get together she has with her friends. Super easy to throw together.  (even at someone's house if need be)

By far the best cream corn I've ever had.  I now have to make this for every family get-together as everyone raves about how much they love this dish.   I use more parmesan cheese then the recipe calls for too make it extra cheesy but other then that, it's great even before I make the alteration!

I'm glad that I didn't serve it right away, as it continued to thicken as it sat on the stove. This is my first time to make Creamed Corn; I enjoyed this side dish a lot -- not too sweet, and the cheese (I used mizithra) was a nice addition!

I'm not a good cook but the recipe was easy to follow. Made the creamy corn for Thanksgiving. Hubby and kids love it! Definitely a keeper.

I live in Texas and eat Rudy's Barbeque often. They are known for their cream corn around here and when I tell people I make cream corn better than Rudy's, no one believes me until they try it.  Sometime I add a little more Parmesan cheese to taste, but that's it. It is so good (and rich, not for every day), but try it once and I promise you will not be disappointed.

I made it a second time, using COCONUT MILK INSTEAD OF WHOLE MILK and skipped using parmesan. It was AMAZING.  

If you want a twist that is delicious than use COCONUT MILK in the can. It's kinda like Maja Blanca (Filipino corn pudding) . 

I actually doubled the recipe also. I stead of 4 tablespoons flour I used 3 and added 1 tbsp of cornstarch. The consistency was PERFECT. I also used white pepper instead of black. 

All my friends wanted the recipe. Yummmm

I forgot the sugar, substituted sour cream and will do the same each time I make it, I used 3 cans of corn instead, that's what I had on hand when out of the clear blue sky I decided I wanted cream corn and I live 30 minutes from a store.  After all a recipe is nothing more than a suggestion and this one was great.

Meh. I thought it was ok. I followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of using 12 frozen corn bags, which should've helped but I found it to be soupy and fairly unremarkable.

I added 1/2 cup shredded parmagiano regiano and a 1/2 cup of shredded romano.  I also doubled the salt and the ground pepper.   Next time I will spice it up with green chiles and jalepenos!!

Excellent go-to side dish.  :)

I only had creamed corn once at a restaurant and it was delicious, I expected more from this recipe after reading the reviews. This recipe is a good start, it definitely takes more time to cook than stated, the flavor develops more as you let it simmer for a good 30 minutes. one big change I'll do next time is to create a roux with the butter and flour first to avoid the raw flour flavor that this recipe had as a result of just throwing the ingredients together.

I had never made cream corn before. But my husband love it. He was willing to get the can stuff. So I found this recipe for him instead. I am not a fan but This was awesome! I mixed in two eggs slowly and baked it in the  oven on 400 for 15 minutes. Everyone including me had seconds! Oh don't make the mistake I may have made by adding to much flour. Just wait for it to thicken up well worth it!

This is so amazing! I've made it twice and we just love it! I omit the Parmesan cheese (personal preference!) I first had homemade cream corn in AZ at a restaurant and had to find a recipe.   This one is perfect!

I used 4 cobs of fresh corn and quartered the other ingredients. Forgot the parmesan - oops!  Used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and was plenty creamy enough.  Very good recipe! One other thing I did differently was added a touch of paprika

As my husband and I were standing at the stove, taste testing, I mentioned to him that one thing I recalled about creamed corn from my childhood was the texture,  meaning no whole kernels, but rather "smashed".   He suggested that perhaps pulsating the corn in a food processor briefly would solve that, as well as release some of the taste.  He was right!  I used my immersion blender instead, until it achieved the texture I thought I recalled, without going as far as to puree it.  We both felt it made the corn mixture more flavorful.  'Very quick & easy step to include.  I have posted a photo of my finished product, spooned into individual ramekins; this not only satisfies those who don't like their slightly runny side dishes touching anything else on the plate (usually children), but also helps keep whatever is served in them warmer longer throughout the meal.   We both decided we will make this dish again.

I admit I've used a lot of recipes from this site and never commented before. But this one I had too. Just simple and great. Thank you for sharing. I had leftover corn on the cob and was searching for what to do with it. I only had a half cup of cream so I just used more milk. Still came out so good.

I actually made this because I was making some corn bread that uses creamed corn and I just hate the gmo stuff in the can. This way I could use organic corn and the ingredients I want. This is a wow. Because I was using this for Mexican corn bread I did not add the Parmesan, but I'll bet it would be delicious. What I did add was some shredded Jack, Pepper Jack and Cheddar which I use in my cornbread. Without the cheese it sweet and delicious, with the cheese it makes it more savory. Either way you have got a winner. I did use the heavy cream, but didn't have any whole milk so used canned evaporated milk). Very good in my corn bread and I will be making it again soon just as a side dish. This is rich, creamy and delicious.

Wonderful!  For 20 some odd years, I've held off making creamed corn as dear husband doesn't care for it.  I had an extra ear and a half of corn on the cob in fridge and suddenly decided 20 years was too long to go without and old favorite, so despite hubby's protests, I went ahead and tried your recipe.  I could have strangled him when he came in to snoop a little and sample *my* corn ... I couldn't keep him out of it!  Made as directed only scaled down to a serving of 3, used half & half as I was out of cream, and kept the sugar to a minimum (maybe a tsp).  Wasn't sure about the Parmesan cheese on top, but decided to give it a try (using Pecorino Romano) - and loved it.  The cheese gives is a wonderful little nutty/salty taste.  Thanks SO much for recipe!

This was great!  Due to some lactose issues in the family, I used 1 3/4 cup almond milk instead of regular milk and heavy cream.  I also added a couple of spoons of yogurt (the family can tolerate it).

Great! The only changes I made was using 4 ear of fresh sweet corn & using fat free 1/2 & 1/2 in place of the heavy cream as that's all I had on hand & added a tsp of corn starch to the flour/milk mixture. 

 Really tasty-my husband LOVES this creamed corn recipe-just like my mother in law used to make- Yay!! Love making my hard working hubby some good down home grub!

This was OK. My husband liked it better reheated the next day when it wasn't so runny. I think I'll try it again, but I'll use more cheese to suit my taste.

OMG! I hate creamed corn from a can it tastes like corn hulls to me.  I halfed the recipe because i get so tired of wasting money on recipes that dont taste good. Made it, tasted it and I MYSELF  ate all of the 1/2 recipe  before i got everything else for dinner done.  So needless to say, i was full and since nobody knew i was making that, i just opened a can of mixed veggies for them, and could not quit thinking about the corn.  So they next day, since no one had the corn, i made a full recipe for the kids.  They want it every night.  it is so easy. ENJOY

Made as directed with only one change, about 1/2 way through the cooking process I took about a cup of the mixture and put it in the blender to breakdown some of the corn. Turn out great! Will definitely make this again.

Loved this flavor!!!!!  Added 1 med slice of minced Vidalia onion.  It seems we can't eat anything without Vidalia's included.  Next time I may try adding about 1/2 tea of liquid smoke.  Hoping for a little grilled flavor with the smoke.

I made this for a camp out with a group of friends. Due to a work emergency the dish got sent ahead of me. The next day when I got there, it was completely gone, but they thanked me for giving them a new favorite. I only tried a little during the process, but it was a hit! There wasn't anything I would have changed.

This is a good basic recipe. The use of frozen corn is advisable for both convinced and the fact that fresh corn just seems to never break down and soften up anymore these days! There is a traditional soul food dish  much like this but it's called "fried corn". It used fresh corn off the cob with the "milk" from the cob added and regarded as liquid gold. These days corn is just too hard and will not soften week enough no matter how long it is cooked. That dish also used TONS of butter and whole milk. Another difference that adds to the flavor profile is the addition of chopped onion, red and green peppers sauteed to softness before adding the corn and other ingredients. If those cook away as the corn cooks, that perfectly fine. The flavor is what you want. But if you like the festive look of it, saute less before adding the corn. In that form I've even heard of the dish being called "Christmas corn"! Adding a bit more sugar helped as well. 
It's awesome with baked ham, pork chops or baked or fried chicken.

I Have never been a fan of this side in general, but hubby requested it for Fathers Day dinner...  I was pleasantly surprised & actually enjoyed it! The ONLY mod I Made was that I had 2 ears of corn on the cob leftover from the night before that I cut & added- will make again & no longer dread this dish!
Also, it made too much for our family- will half in future.

Although I tweaked it a little bit, this is now my go to recipe for stove top creamed corn. I used half & half rather than the heavy cream & only a half cup of milk rather than a whole cup. Turned out excellent.

You NEED to make this.  I took the advice of the top reviewer and added Half & Half instead of heavy cream and milk.  It was perfect.  My version of "cooking it through" was bringing it to a boil and letting it bubble for ten minutes, stirring furiously the whole time to keep from burning.  It was absolute perfection.  Of all the dishes I served at Memorial Day with the family, this was the one with no leftovers.  It reminded me a lot of the creamed corn from Rudy's BBQ in Texas.

Absolutely amazing. I cut the recipe in half because I was only cooking for myself but I ate half of it before the rest of my meal finished. Lol. That good! I added the full amount of sugar and pepper though. I recognize that I like more seasoning and sweetness than most folks. I'm glad I did. It was perfect!

This is so good! Never thought I would consider making this but so glad I did.  I have made with frozen corn and made with canned corn.  Both were great but I prefer with frozen.  I make this and put it in a crock pot afterwards. Always a hit.

Super easy and delicious!  You'll never buy canned cream corn again. I made mine with fresh corn. 6 ears is necessary for the full size recipe. Just cut it off the cob and proceed. I let the corn simmer in the cream for about 10 minutes before adding the flour and milk paste. Also, I used half and half in place of the heavy cream and milk. Don't add the parmesan until just before serving.

I am addicted to this recipe. I put a little more flower than it calls for as I like it a little thicker. I also don't put the parmesan cheese in thee because the saltiness from it will take away from the sweetness of the dish. Other than that two thumbs up for sure.

This recipe is simply delicious! It's a big hit in my home! My husband and son love it! I made this recipe twice. One time as directed and the second time I took the advice of one of the reviewers and did half a cup of heavy cream and half a cup of buttermilk to avoid it being too runny. Both versions were great but the second one was perfect!! This recipe will stay in my recipe book!

I Prepared this recipe, however instead of regular butter, used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Lite, and substituted 1% milk for whole milk. It was delicious!  Did I say delicious!!!  My husband loved it. I'm very critical of my cooking, but must say that it was very good. Wow!

My husband loved this corn!  We even heated the leftover corn the next day and it was still delicious, maybe even better once the flavored had all melded together!

So, so good and very easy!  I used fat free half and half instead of cream and I decreased the whole milk by half (as suggested in the video) and used 1%.  It was thick and creamy, the black pepper and parmesan really make this dish amazing.  I served this on Christmas Eve with prime rib and everyone was reaching for second servings of the corn.

I liked this recipe and would make again. I don't agree with the change suggested in the video to halve the amount of milk to add. I found ours thickened too much, and really became congealed as it cooled on the plate. I will add the suggested amount of milk next time.

Too saucy.  But tasted good otherwise.  I would either halve the sauce or triple the amount of corn next time.

This is the best cream corn ever!! We have some picky eaters and several people with gluten allergies. I used sweet corn and gluten free flour. I was asked to bring it again for Christmas.

I saw this recipe last year while flipping thru AllRecipes.com. I do not cook...or, should I say...I never have cooked much in my life. I married a chef at the age of 25 and before that never cooked much. And I am also a vegetarian. 

Last Thanksgiving, I truly wanted to contribute to the dinner, and looked here for a recipe that was hearty and holiday appropriate...but also simple enough for a novice cook. 

A year later, I can say I have never gone wrong with this! It is DELICIOUS! Not only did I make this for Thanksgiving 2014, but also for Christmas that year. It was received so well, and jokes were made about my budding cooking abilities. I made it this year (2015) for Christmas, and it was cleaned out  (I need also mention there were 10 other dishes to devour)! 

This recipe is fantastic, and is now "my" Holiday trademark. I will make this every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas!  It is so delicious, and simple enough for even ME to make! You cannot go wrong with this...and it is NO CANNED CORN!

I made this side dish with Thanksgiving dinner. This receipe was really delish!! The whole family loved it! I was TOLD that I better make this as a weekly dish from now on. (Lol)  It was very easy to make. I used frozen sweet corn, (Schwan's) has fantastic sweet corn, THE best! I used a little more flour to thicken it up more.  No more canned creamed corn for us!  Thanks for the receipe!

I doubled the recipe, so I had to cook it for about 15 min to get the consistency. To those who said it was soupy....you just didn't cook it long enough. PERFECT JUST AS WRITTEN!

I found it here was a tad to much liquid as I made the recipe as stated. I had to add corn starch to help thicken it up and it still had a lot of liquid. Next time I may cut down on the cream to decrease the amount of liquid. It had awesome flavor and my family loved it. That is all that matters when trying to please foodies. It needed more salt and pepper for our tastes. It makes more than a "typical can" of creamed corn so I may scale down the recipe next time.

Really delicious!  Everyone at Thanksgiving loved it!

I do have to say that mine turned out a bit more liquidy than I would have liked and I actually think I could have maybe added some more corn to it to make it less liquidy.  But nonetheless I received no complaints!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and it was one of the most popular dishes.  My brother said it tasted like the creamed corn from a popular BBQ chain in Texas.  The recipe was very simple.  While cooking, I did notice that the liquid was runny, so I cooked everything stovetop for longer than the recipe calls for, and then transferred everything to the crock pot and cooked it on low for a couple of hours.  It ended up being the perfect consistency.  I also omitted the parmesan cheese as I didn't have any on hand.  Overall a great recipe that will probably be on our Thanksgiving menu every year now.

I came across this recipe in 2013 around Thanksgiving. My family and I tried it first, but then made it for our Thanksgiving Dinner, It was a hit all the way around. It is now a family favorite, and we will be making it again for our Thanksgiving dinner this year!

I use this recipe all the time, as is, no changes. Everyone loves it and my brother-in-law, whose pretty hard to please, can't get enough when I make it. I'm even making it for Thanksgiving this year! Thank you so much for this keeper recipe.

I thought this was going to be lame and gave up halfway through, I had done everything except the flour and milk (and parm). I didn't know what to do with it sitting in the pan an hour later so I sighed and decided to finish as planned.... I used a little less milk than called for and didn't expect much when I finally tried it.... It's like a dessert. Rich and creamy like pudding. I don't even really like corn, but I ate enough for a bellyache. I never did add the parm.

So easy and delicious. The parmesan cheese really makes this dish. It's good without it, but the cheese really makes it stand apart.

I've never made creamed corn before I googled this recipe.  From the first time and every time there after my guests clean the bowl!! They have even gone back for seconds using a soup bowl.  Definitely a hit!!!  ShelliB

I'm only giving 4 stars because I had to change it a bit to suit my tastes.  I didn't have whole milk, so I used 2%.  I added a lot more black pepper, and used a whole 32 oz bag of corn for this sauce.  I very much like it, but I really want to add less sugar next time, it's too sweet.

I think it would be better with white corn and more savory additions like green onion. Maybe I will try it again but substitute light half-and-half.

So sweet and delish!  Everyone I have made this for has loved it.  Definitely cut the milk in half as another person recommended (so 1 cup should be 1/2 cup).  I have been making this for years and am just now getting around to reviewing it. 
When hot it can be runny, but once it cools on your plate it thickens nicely.
And honestly, you can just throw all the ingredients in at once and it seems to work out just fine (discovered that when I was in a rush making this one time)..

This recipe was delectable.  Absolutely delicious.  I added much more fresh cracked pepper (we love the stuff) and I used two heaping tablespoons of flour in my milk mixture.  It quickly thickened my sauce no problem.  I recommend doing this if you like a thicker sauce or you don't want to stir and stir until the sauce thickens.  Otherwise, the recipe is perfect.  Thank you Ms. Yockey for a wonderful, down-home, old-timey, style creamed corn recipe!

I made this recipe and then one where I put my own spin on it by using half the amount of heavy cream and adding in cream cheese and only using half the milk....both were good and all liked them both. The one with cream cheese and less milk was a little thicker and not as rich. Will be making both at Thanksgiving for sure!!!

I tried this for dinner yesterday and got mixed reviews. I only wanted 4 servings so I halved everything except the corn. I used a 16 oz bag of frozen corn and still got a very soupy mixture even after cooking for longer than suggested. I thought it was very tasty and my older daughter loved it. However my younger and hubby did not like at all so maybe won't be making it again. Thanks though.

More like corn in cream instead creamed corn.  Was OK.  Might try it again with cream cheese and less heavy cream.

As written, only 3 stars. With my changes its a 5.  I did the recipe just as stated but ended up doubling the corn, salt, flour, and cheese. So 20 oz corn, 2 teaspooons salt, 4 Tablesoons of flour, and 1/2 cup parm cheese. All the others ingredents I just left as writen.. (If you dont do these changes, its more like a runny corn soup than it is cream corn)

It was really runny so I had to add extra flour. My family said it was too rich. It was okay, but too rich to eat too much of it. I didn't have a full cup of sour cream so I added a little miracle whip and used mozzarella cheese instead of parm.

Excellent, but even with substituting half and half for the cream, it was still a little too thick for my tastes.  Leftovers were PERFECT for corn chowder.

I must have gone wrong somewhere in the recipe because it tasted absolutely awful. But I've checked and rechecked all the ingredients and I measured everything exactly. I've had the delicious, sweet cream corn at Rudy's, and this just did not compare. The black pepper and salt dominated the flavor, and it was not sweet at all. I'm still not sure why mine turned out so awful when everyone else obviously loved it, but I don't think I'll try it again.

Don't know what all the fuss is aobut this?? It was very bland and didn't thicken up as nicely as I would have liked. My husband and son each had one spoonful, and said they wouldn't have any more. I threw most of it away.

I came across this recipe by mistake when I was looking for something to make with the slow cooker ham recipe on this site.  It did take quite a long time to thicken - more than 10 minutes.  I ended up using 2 bags of frozen baby white and yellow corn.  The corn was already sweetened so I don't know why there would be a problem with that (as indicated in a previous review).  It was ok for something different but I don't know that I'd go out of my way to make it for a holiday or anything.  That being said, it WAS like no other creamed corn.

Great taste, but far too much liquid. This was like soup - not great for serving as a side dish unless you have a bowl. I'll make it again, but cut the milk/cream in half (favoring the cream).

Not bad, but not quite what I expected.  Next time it might need some changes.

i thought this was okay. it was good for the first few bites, but then WAY too rich. i would probably lower the amount of cream and use a 2% or skim milk instead. i also had blended part of the mixture to give it more a 'creamed' corn recipe.

This tasted pretty good, but mine didn't thicken as well as it should have.  I ended up running it through a strainer and thickening the sauce in my cast iron skillet.

I'm giving it three because my daughter pronounced it delicious but I thought it was like eating corn in warm milk.
