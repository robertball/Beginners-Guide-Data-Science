Fabulous recipe!  Be sure to make enough mashed potatoes and REALLY be sure to leave enough for the top.  The only change I made was to add garlic and white wine to the sauteeing leeks and onion.  Also, next time I won't make my potatoes with heavy cream.  That's a lot of extra calories just for mashed potatoes that will be covered in other yummy goodness.

This was very very good!.
I did add some fresh thyme to the leek mixture and I'll add to the reviewer who says that this makes a lot of food.
But that's good!, my husband was delighted that thre were leftovers the next day and said that cold was even better.

I think this would be very good with the leek mixture mixed with cheddar cheese sauce, too.
Mmm, a wonderful winter sunday meal.

It is somewhat lacking in flavor, but definitely a good start.

I needed something for a pot luck and this turned out to be perfect! Big oops, though -- I realised at the last minute that I was out of potatoes, so I used whole wheat macaroni as the base and turned it into a "gourmet" mac-n-cheese. But it is the combination of flavours that really makes it -- the leeks, ham, nutmeg and pepper are delicious together. I'm sure it will be even better with the creamy mashed potato base, but even the way I made it, it was gobbled up instantly!

Delish! I made the potatoes much less creamy (used a little butter and some 1% milk instead of cream) and kept the skins on because I'm a freak who loves fiber, but I can see how this would be good with just the flesh of the 'taters. Too, I found the serving size a bit off; I halved the recipe and still got way more than what I would consider 6 servings. (Still working through the leftovers, to be honest!)

I followed the recipe as is and we both decided that we would make it again. The top puffed up a little and was the best part! I also loved the nutmeg in the mashed potatoes and will add it everytime I make them now.

Pretty good. Listen to the reviewers when they say make extra mash. If I try this again, I may just put the mash on the top and double the filling. I felt I was eating a plate full of mash potatoes instead of shepards pie. Flavor was great and it was my first time cooking with leeks. So if you're a leek virgin like me, then try this as a jumping off point.

It's a hearty dish, but VERY bland -- despite adding garlic and sauteeing the leeks & onions in white wine.

Truly delicious twist on the traditional shepherd's pie - I preferred this version for sure.  The leeks and ham ratchet up the flavor from "family meal" to "mmmmm......"

My husband loved this.  He said to make it again, so I will.  It was very hearty, yet not too heavy.  I never cooked with leeks before, and it seemed like quite a bit of work with the sauteing of onions,  prepping the tomatoes & making mashed potatoes, but it turned out fine. I poured the hot mashed potato water over the tomatoes in a small bowl to loosen the skin.  I think I should have sliced the leeks a bit thinner, but I had no idea this first time and just guessed. I agree that there could be a tad more potatoes, and it seemed that the ham could be cut down a little bit, too.  I adjusted the recipe to 4 servings, and with just the 2 of us, there is almost half of that left over, so the serving sizes are true. Overall, a nice change from ground beef casseroles.  And as another reviewer said, a very nice meal for a winter Sunday.  Thanks!

My family was pleasantly surprised how much they liked it.  I was looking on how to use up my pork roast and subbed it in for the ham.  I did not have any leek on hand.  The rest of the recipe I followed and it was a perfect quick hit!  Thanks!

I made this recipe. I used 1 1/2 pound of a ground veal/pork/beef meat blend and 1/2 ground sweet sausage instead of the ham. It was terrific! everyone who tried it loved it. My 88 year old father-in-law loved it along with my 2 brother-in-laws and my wife.

This was pretty great. I think next time, I would make even more mashed potatoes than it calls for, because they were the best part. I over-salted mine a little bit, forgetting how salty the ham would be, so definitely watch out for that when you season to taste.

A little bland, but next time I will put more flavor to it. I agree with the more filling with the mashed potatoes.
Nice one dish after all the prepping.

Too labor intensive.  It was tasty, but I think Russet potatoes should be specified.  I used red potatoes and the dish was soupy.

As I can't eat ham (for religious reasons) I used a mixture of beef mince and hot dog instead, and the results were superb. The only other tweak I did was adding a table spoon of tomato paste to the meats / leak mixtures. I loved it!

This is fantastic.  I made it exactly as directed and it turned out great.  When I went to visit my parents, I made it for my extremely picky father.  My mother said, "don't let it hurt your feelings if he won't eat it.  You know how picky he is."  He ate it everyday for three days until it was gone.

This was so good we reserved enough ham from Christmas to make it twice. Reheated, it held it's own and was a real time-saver in a period where busy is the norm.

We all loved this recipe. I had a little less than the required amount of leeks so I added some asparagus I had in the fridge. I also took the advise of a few reviewers and made extra potatoes. I crumbled some rice cereal on top making a nice crispy layer. At the end I had enough to make two caseroles. I plan to freeze one; we'll see how it turns out when it is time to re-heat it.
