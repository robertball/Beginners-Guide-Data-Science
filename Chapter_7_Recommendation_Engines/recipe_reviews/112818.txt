Growing up as a child chicken long rice was and still is a favorite of mine. Now I make it often as it is simple and so delicious. This is a good chicken long rice recipe. Nowadays, I just pick up a rotisserie chicken (i.e costco) and shred the meat (thigh, drumstick, some breast) and keep the juices from the rotisserie. I usually add a pinch of hawaiian rock salt to the chicken meat (shredded) with all of its juice and 4 cans of chicken broth in a large pot. I turn the heat up on high to boil. I add some fresh ground black pepper. I use (thumb size) fresh grated ginger, 2 or 3 garlic cloves, no maui onions, and a sprinkle of green onions for garnish. I omitted the baby bok choy. One package of saifun noodles (bean thread) noodles is a must. There are about 4 bundles inside each package, enough for a large pot. Don't buy the vermicelli noodles, it is too thin. Once the broth is boiling, I add the noodles to the pot, I cover the pot and  I let it get soft and expand, about 25 to 30 minutes give or take. Once the noodles are tender I use a kitchen scissors to cut up the noodles. I turn off the stove and let the noodles sit. Since the noodles will usually soak up a lot of the chicken broth I add a another can of low sodium chicken broth to the soup. I then taste and adjust seasonings (salt and black pepper). I normally eat this alone or with POI and/or rice. A very comforting and flavorful chicken soup - especially when you are feeling under the weather on those cold days!

Thanks for this idea! We recently went vegetarian and I was looking for something to make with bok choy and rice vermicelli.  I ended up simmering the bok choy in some water with fresh ginger and garlic in it.  I added three diced green onions, some chopped cilantro, and then mixed in a peanut sauce (peanut butter, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, and hoisin).  I threw in some textured vegetable protein (TVP) to thicken it up and served it over warmed (cooked) rice vermicelli.  It was a hit.  I know this is nothing like your recipe really, but thought I'd add the comment so someone else might get creative too! :)

Growing up in Hawaii, chicken long rice was a childhood favorite.  This recipe is simple to make and delicious - the ginger perfectly flavors the chicken broth, and the bok choy offers some nice and slightly chewy contrast to the dish.  The only modification I made was cutting back on the chicken stock by 1/3 - I eat it more as a side dish served on a plate than as a soup.  This is the perfect accompaniment to a Hawaiian dinner of kalua pig and macaroni-potato salad.

Thank you so much for this recipe! We just moved to the islands from the Mainland and have had to change our menu a bit. This is a perfect addition to our meal menu. I doubled the recipe and used chicken bouillon powder instead of stock. To make things easier I added frozen diced onions boiled it a bit then added the long rice noodles. At the very end just before serving I added about two cups of frozen spinach and two cups of diced rotisserie chicken that I bought at Costco. Believe it or not we get cold here in Hawaii and it was perfect for this chilly night. I will definitely be making this many more times! Mahalo!

I've looked through numerous Chicken Long Rice recipes and this has to be one of the easiest and most flavorful recipes I've found.  I use chicken breasts because my husband dislikes "brown meat" but it is just as good!

I live on the Big Island of Hawaii and have tasted lots of chicken long rice.  This recipe is superb and ranks among the best I have tasted. The beauty of Hawaiian food is that it is not exotic - no peanut sauce, lemon grass, or other "Thai" like spices or flavorings -- Hawaiian food is simply and deliciously seasoned with Hawaiian sea salt, some ginger, but very few other types of spices. Plain and simple but ono.  Here we eat chicken long rice more like a side dish, and therefore I lessened the amount of broth. I used pink Hawaiian sea salt. We also "snip" the long rice into more bite size pieces by taking kitchen sheers and snipping a handful of the soaked long rice at a time, until the entire batch is snipped into shorter, more manageable and bite size pieces.  I used chicken thighs, canned broth, and a bit of powdered chicken broth and water because I didn't have enough of the canned broth on hand.   I would also use this broth to freeze for Chinese recipes. I liked the addition of the mild Maui onions. It was pleasant but not overpowering like regular onions would be.  This will be my new long rice recipe from now on. Today I am using this recipe to feed about 50 local kids in a youth gathering.  I am also serving Kalua pork.  Thank you for the recipe!

This soup is "souper"! Made it several times for my family and they love it! Freezes well and is a great comfort food on cold winter days. For convenience I use boneless skinless thighs. Made a large portion and took to work kept hot in the crockpot and all our operators and workers coming out of the cold could smell the soup right away and followed their nose to the kitchen. They all loved it and I had several marriage proposals (LOL)

I never thought of Chicken Long Rice as comfort food, but I guess if you grow up on the stuff that's what it becomes.  We do make it with some different stuff though, I've never had chicken long rice with bok choy, so I left it out; I'm not a huge fan of ginger, so I decreased the amount and added garlic.  All my life we've used "long rice" for the noodles, it's mung bean thread (the package I bought said "saifun" don't know if that's what it's labeled as), found in the asian section of the grocery store, never heard of using rice noodles or rice vermicelli, but I'm sure it'd work.  Very simple recipe, if you can find the right noodles it'll be perfect.

Living in Hawaii all my life I would NEVER add lemon grass as suggested and I like the addition of bok choy.  Getting kids to eat greens is hard, but mine love bok choy this way.  Less is better when making comfort food and this is truely comfort food!!  Love this recipe, don't change a thing!!!  Mahalo nui loa!

Delicious!!! I only had chicken thighs on hand and I halved the recipe and it still made a lot of soup. The kids(1yo and 4yo) LOVED it. They both had 3rds and the 4yo kept saying how delicious her soup was. Thanks for this recipe the whole family can enjoy.

I used mung bean noodles because that is all I could find and it paired perfectly with my Kalua Pig. I drizzled a couple of drops of sesame oil in my leftover the next day and that was good as well.

I made this for an Hawiian themed party for senior citizens. Everyone loved it an there was none left (I doubled the recipee). I made a couple of changes. I used half the salt. I don't have access to Maui onions so I used vidalla. For the chicken I used about 4 lbs of boneless skinless chicken thigh. This was a double batch and not having to mess with skin an bones was great. I have sinced made it for my family and still use the boneless skinless thighs. It also cuts down on the fat.

Good base but VERY bland- big SNORE as is. I suggest adding something that will actually make it tasty: MORE salt! Sad but true, low sodium is groovy but if you want this recipe to be flavorful here is my suggestion: Regular chicken broth, add some "Aloha Shoyu" brand "Barbecue" sauce (its just sweet and ginger-y soy sauce, not like regular BBQ sauce- once you use this you will never go back!) Then, Caramelize LOTS of onions, add to the broth, and finally (the "piece de resistance", add a generous portion of the Organic Chicken Base made by "Better Than Bouillon", sold at Costco and other good supermarkets- its worth finding and keeping many jars of it in your pantry.I never go home without it. I was a Four Seasons chef for several years- chef secret: salt, sugar, and butter, GO THERE (once in a while, life is short)! Garnish with lots of fresh chopped green onion ("Scallions" for all you mainlanders...:))) ENJOY, "Stay ONO, wen Broke Da mouth"!

This IS very comforting nutritious and low in calories...not to mention economical! We had it for Sunday lunch. I added a couple small jalapenos sliced from the garden. Have to admit I used a regular sweet onion and regular salt and it was still awesome. Thank you Mama Smith!

My grandfather used to make this for us when we were little. The aroma brought back fond memories. I didn't add enough ginger and will make note to follow the recipe more closely next time. I made the bok choy on the side as I knew my husband would not like it. Thanks for the recipe.

A definte keeper for the winter. I only had 8t bouillion powder so I was only able to make 64iz if chicken brith. It was a bit salty but I'm sure the low sodium chicken broth would have been better. Definite keeper.

This so called Hawaiian long rice chicken soup seems to be the same as the filipino dish of chicken sauteed with ginger garlic n onion then after being halfway cook add water or chicken broth then when boiling adding rice glass noodles or mung bean thread noodles till cook n adding scallions or bok choy slices lol. Maybe brought Hawaii by filipino immigrants?

Great results although I didn't measure precisely. While the broth was initially developing I did throw in some sage bay leaves tarragon and lemongrass which got strained out with the rest of the solids. Also added carrots and celery with the onion. Very fortifying especially when you're not feeling well!

Delicious and easy to make! I omitted the Maui onion and added about 5 cloves of garlic with the ginger. I usually only eat white chicken meat but for this recipe the dark meat with skin and bones really added a lot of rich flavor. It was more like a brothy soup than the noodle side dish I'm used to but I love it and will definitely make it many many more times!

Season and roast the chicken first for more flavor - I use Hawaiian salt, fresh ground pepper and chinese five spice to taste. If using the chicken with skin on roast till crispy otherwise just till browned on the surface.

I have made this several times. It was a little bland at first, but I have nailed it, now. I sauteed bacon, garlic and onion as my 1st step. Then added chicken bouillon with the chicken broth. This has DEFINITELY added some flavor. I even have my mother's approval, and shes my biggest critic when  it comes to food.

I make this several times a year especially in the winter. It's a hit! I use a rotisserie chicken from Costco cut most of the meat off then boil the carcas so the rest of the meat falls off. It is so yummy!!
