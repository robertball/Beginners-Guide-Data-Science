Great recipe.  Took them to a cookie exchange and got rave reviews.  I made them with Lemon pudding.  They really are good and easy to make too.  I tend to add a little more oats as I do like a stiffer cookie.  I am not sure why others have tried this and they came out too runny.  Maybe the type of oats or maybe not cooking long enough before adding in the oats.  I use the old fashioned oats.  With using more oats they stiffen up much better.  They don't last long so you may want to double the recipe.  I have also made them with Pistachio pudding and they were great!  Next time I will try the Jell-O Cheesecake or Butterscotch flavor.  Thanks for this great and unique recipe.  A must try!

I use this recipe often, but mine calls for 4 cups of rolled oats. This may help to prevent it from being too runny.

Wow! what a great cookie!  I cut the sugar to 3/4 of a cup and I find it just right.  I like a versatile cookie like this.  All the flavors taste great!

For a little girl allergic to wheat, eggs, nuts, and soy - this is a dream come true!!  Soft, yummy, chewy cookies.
We added 4 cups oats after reading suggestions.  A GREAT variation we loved was using lemon pudding, 3 1/2 cups oats, 1/2 cup craisins - soooo goood!!  We also added mint chips to the chocolate ones.  The butterscotch didn't even make it into a container - gone too fast.  THANK YOU!!
2011: These cookies have become a regular in our household. The kind of oatmeal you use makes a big difference! The quick oats gives you a softer, chewier cookie for longer. The old fashioned oats sets up much quicker (don't let it sit for 5 min) and gives you a firmer cookie. We still love, Love, LOVE these cookies!

Great recipe!  I improvised with 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup Splenda and used the Sugar Free Pudding.  I let it boil for about 3 minutes and added 4 cups of oats.  Instead of dropping them onto wax paper I pressed into a pan to be cut into squares.  Cookies disappeared instantly!!

I’ve made these cookies twice, the first time I didn’t have chocolate pudding on hand so I used butterscotch. The cookies had a nice flavor but they stayed really sticky and gooey not the consistency they should be.  The second time I made them with chocolate pudding and I boiled for 3 min rather them 2 and they came out perfect.  Good for us woman that need  a chocolate fix once in a while.

They taste great and were simple to make. However there were no instructions on how to store them and they don't harden unless refridgerated.

I found this recipe on a day when it was 100 degrees and our air conditioner was broken - "no bake" seemed like a good idea, and it was!  Like others, I decreased the sugar to 1 cup and boiled the mixture for 3 minutes.  Also, I store them in the refrigerator - they are very refreshing that way.  I've made them with chocolate, butterscotch, lemon and pistachio pudding.  All were great, but the pistachio were a green/gray color - next time I'll add green food color.

These were perfect for quick treat. I used Devils Food Pudding Mix and cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups. Mine set up just fine, but it might be because I used 1/2 can evaporated milk instead of regular milk. These cookies were much better than the traditional No Bake cookies I am used to.

These are great! I've been looking for a no-bake without peanut butter because of a nut allergy. The sugar needs to be cut down alot and maybe add some cocoa powder to the sugar mixture if making with the chocolate pudding. I used Devil Food and will experiment with other puddings.

This recipe has a great flavor, due to the pudding mix. However, they never set up! I let them sit on the counter, I chilled them in the fridge, I even froze them, but they stayed gooey. It's possible I might have done something wrong, but I don't think I'll be making these again.

Super easy and delicious! I followed others' suggestions and cut the sugar down by 1/2 cup. Instead of going up to 4 cups of oats, I stirred in 1/2 cup of sweetened shredded coconut. I used white chocolate flavored pudding and they were DELICIOUS! Definitely keep them in the fridge to set up and stay that way.

My husband and daughter made these cookies last night and they are so 
yummy!  Just like my grandma makes!  We used old fashioned oats like others suggested, and wanted to make them lower fat so only used half as much butter and they turned out very nice!  Our only complaint is that they are a bit too sweet, next time we'll try using less sugar too, but not quite sure if that will work out as well.

Awesome cookie recipe with a few changes. I used 3 cups of quick oats instead of 3 1/2.
Plus I added 1 cup of peanut butter and 1 cup of coconut. They turned out AWESOME!  I have been trying for a long time to clone this one stores no bakes and with these changes they are as close as I can get to there recipe.  So thank you for posting this recipe. AWESOME!!!!

I just got done devouring a bunch of these. I'm like Cookie Monster over here, NOMNOMNOMNOMNOM!! I usually like to follow a recipe just right the first time as a control for future trys, but I did a few different things. I just used 1/2 C (one stick) of butter because after the day I've had, I was too lazy to slice a second stick in half, lol! It worked just fine. I went ahead and used the full measure of sugar and BOY are they sweet! I  love it. The only other thing I did differently was to let it boil for 4 minutes, as I didn't think 2 would be long enough. OH, and I added a bit more pudding. I used a pkg of butterscotch and then about 1/2 pkg of vanilla. These cookies are SO delicious I can't wait to try them with all kinds of different flavors of pudding. I didn't have any problem with them being unmanageable in any way - they stayed together and they're not overly sticky in my opinion. TRY THESE COOKIES you will not be sorry!

The first time I made these they were good, but the second time they were fabulous. I didn't have any instant pudding, so I tossed in the chocolate cook and serve pudding and a Tbsp of dark chocolate cocoa powder to the sugar mix. I let it boil for 3 minutes instead of two. Instead of letting it stand for 5 minutes, I started to spoon it up after 3, and was much easier to work with. Here's the kicker though. I added a bag of toffee pieces to the first batch, and two bags of peppermint crunch chips that I had leftover from my december 2007 cookie marathon. The first ones were good, but the second batch got rave reviews....they were positively decadent. The cookies start to set up quickly, but really firm up after about 30 miutes in the fridge.mmmmmmm

DELICIOUS! I made these for a bake sale and they almost didn't make it there! :) Once they did they sold out quickly and people were asking for the recipe. I made it with chocolate pudding, only used 1 1/2 cup sugar but upped the oatmeal to 4 cups after reading the other reviews. They were PERFECT! great cookie!

I didn't really like this recipe.  I used lemon pudding and added craisins and the taste was fine, but they were soooo sticky.  I finally had to store mine in the freezer to keep them from becoming one big blob. Even the fridge wasn't keeping them hard enough.

Followed the directions and came out wonderful!! We used cheesecake flavored pudding mix and loved it! I think next time I will cut back on the sugar a little bit though. They did come out gooey and sticky, but we loved them that way!!! Definitely need to store these in the fridge!!

I loved this recipe.  It was exactly what I was looking for on a lazy Saturday afternoon.  I took some of the other suggestions and cut the sugar to 1.5 cups, and increased the oats to 4 cups.  It turned out great, not too sweet!

These were good! I love that you can use different pudding flavors to change it up.  I made mine with vanilla pudding and added peanut butter chips.  They turned out a little bit sticky but set up fine in the refrigerator.

I just made these with my 6 yr. old and they were easy and good.  I reduced sugar to 1 cup, may go 3/4 next time b/c these were plenty sweet.  I also used vanilla flavor pudding and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 tsp. of cocoa powder.  I was out of vanilla flavoring, but I figured since it was, "vanilla" pudding I could get by with it.  I did cook my mixture for 3 full minutes as some suggested and they set up perfectly.  I left them in the pot, covered for 10 minutes before patting into cookies.  That way the oats got a few extra minutes to "cook".

Yum!!!! I tried these tonight using chocolate pudding and the taste is awesome! I like it much better than the ones I grew up with (using peanut butter). Can't wait to try these using butterscotch pudding!

I saw this recipe on Pinterest. It was called "vanilla oatmeal no bakes." I have always liked the chocolate ones, so I decided to give it a try. I halved the recipe and used white chocolate pudding. The on-line recipe is the same exact one as here but calls for vanilla pudding instead of chocolate. I used a cookie scoop, and for half the recipe I got 21 cookies. They are a little too sweet, for me, and compared to the traditional ones with cocoa. However, I think it's kool that any pudding flavor can be used to change the flavor.

I loved these cookies! They had a great flavor each and every time I made them. Sometimes I would use different flavored pudding and sometimes I would add a little peanut butter to them as well. They always turned out great. My family loves them too. Thanks for sharing.

These were amazing! First try and my picky 7 year old is loving them.  Furthermore, i am not much of a baker so the no bake part was great.  Used a mixture of butterscotch and white chocolate pudding and put some butterscotch chips in before i put in the fridge to set. Might not use as much oats (used 4 cups) next time. I am so pleased!

These cookies did not stay very long, gone it two days!  I love no bakes and needed a recipe for my 1 yr. old that did not have peanut butter.  I hate those other no bake recipes w/ just cocoa powder they taste awful.  So gave this one a try and wow!  I used the pumpkin spice pudding mix and added the extra 1/2 cup of oats and i always use old fashioned b/c they come out chunkier.  Despite the added oats cookies were a tad sticky but after refrigerating overnight they set up well enough to handle.  These have such a creamy texture (not gritty like some cookies). I cannot wait to try these in more flavors including chocolate.  TY so much for the recipe it has already found a home in my recipe box!

Delicious recipe! I used the "Turtle" flavor instant pudding and it was great! My family was eating them off the wax paper before they were fully set! I took other reviewers suggestion and lessened the sugar to 1.5 cups instead of 2. Great recipe!

First time making no bake cookies. Way sweet and are not setting up. Still gooey and sticky. I'm I supposed to let them sit for 24hrs or refrigerate them? A little more info would have been helpful.

I made these last night without modifyng and they turned out gooey and did not set untill I finally put them in the refrigerator. They tasted more like a pudding ball than a cookie. I tried again today and instead of 3 cups of oats, I used 4 cups, instead of boiling the sugar, butter, milk mixture for 2 minutes, I let it boil for 4 minutes. I also only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar to start and added 1/2cup after the mixture started boiling. They came out perfect. Taste, texture, everything. Great!

I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar and they were awesome. I used butterscotch instant pudding. I boiled for 3 minutes. I had no problem with them being sticky.  I will definitely be making these again. YUMMY

These are ok... This is an easy recipe, but was more bland than I would have liked. I used butterscotch regular pudding and about half of a pkg of sugar-free white chocolate and 4 cups of oats. I boiled the mixture for 3-4 minutes and my cookies set up well. Maybe using peanut butter instead of butter would add some character to these cookies. I do love the ease and versitility of this recipe.

I didn't enjoy these cookies. I'm thinking that maybe the pudding mix has something to do with it. The taste is ok but the gritty texture is what ruined it for me. I boiled the sugar long enough to disolve and it settled nicely.....so I know it's not that......hmmmm

I love this recipe. I changed a few things. 3/4c. brown sugar, 3/4c. peanut butter, 2/3c. 1/2 & 1/2 and everything else the same. I used 4c. of oats. just trying to cut out the sugar and  more healthier fats.

I love this recipe. I used Devils Food pudding (as recommended by other reviewers) and followed the rest of the instructions exactly as written. They were amazing!    They set up just fine (I had a full boil for 2 minutes) and everyone loved them. Thanks!

These were definitely a good cookie, but I prefer to add peanut butter to my no-bakes. I did like the flavor of the pudding instead of the cocoa powder that I usually use. Maybe next time I will try to add a scoop or two of peanut butter.

Oh goodie, goodie, goodie!  I used to make these cookies with my mom when I was a kid, so I let my daughter help me and we made a double batch!  We added just a little extra oatmeal to firm them up a bit more, and we could hardly wait to let them completely cool!  They are great stored covered in the fridge so they don't get too soft if you're in a warm climate.

I've made this twice now, both with butterscotch pudding and it's so good.  The first time I followed the recipe as is using margarine and they were great.  The second time I subbed coconut oil for margarine and coconut milk for the milk and they were still great.  My only critique is that they are slightly too sweet for my taste.  I think next time I make them I might decrease the sugar by half a cup.  But it's so nice to finally find no bake cookies that don't use peanut butter.

I added more oats and less sugar. Were sticky so I rolled in balls and coated with powdered sugar. I used butterscotch, pistachio, vanilla, and bananna cream puddings. Everyone loved them.

Nothing like a no bake... The constancy is bad. They taste kind of funny too. The pudding gives you a weird texture in your mouth...Will not make again.

This was a decent recipe. Hubby said it was ok..waving on real good. However as I did exactly to the recipe to a T. What advice hubby had said that I was pretty well in agree-ance with. Was it needed to be a little more chocolately and a have a bit of a crunch to it. Otherwise it was good. So I'm thinking of decreasing some of the sugar next time and adding something with a light crunch to it. Otherwise, the recipe was simple to follow and it did make a quick-in-a-fix chocolate fix for the sweet tooth person. And the neat thing about this recipe was that it was warm enough to shape nicely and it really didn't take very long to make. Thanks.

Ok. I love this cookies, it has always been a Favorit of mine. but i did things a little bit different. 
i added the sugar,no butter,milk and waited for it to boil, then i added the peanut-butter and let it all melt and cook together.then i added the oatmeal 1 cup at a time it turned out perfect.

Fast, easy and yummy! As a busy mom with 4 hungry kids, this will stay in my recipe box and be used often.  I will only use one cup of sugar next time.  I used white chocolate pudding and everyone in my house loved these cookies.

These are sooo easy and ohh so yummy. I around with flavors and found that the Jello peanut butter cup and the Jello cherry cheesecake ones are my family's favorite. I chopped up a few maraschino cherries and tossed them in Before I added the oats. Very Very good! I LUV them chewy so I added a slight more butter then what this recipe calls for and i didnt boil it for 2 minutes, just until it slightly boiled over. The first time, i make Jello chocolate fudge cookies and boiled it for the 2 minutes and they turned out Hard, no one take it. All in all this recipe is delish!!!! Thankz for sharing!!

No-Bake cookies are awesome to start with, but I tried this one with Pistachio pudding. Yum! You can really taste the oats flavor in this version, I want to try with lots of different flavored puddings!

I'm sorry, I was not a fan of this recipe.  I made it with chocolate pudding and my husband said it tasted like fake chocolate no bakes.  I usually make this cookie with real chocolate melted down.  I made the switch to simply try an easier way and it just wasn't the same.  

I would be willing to try it with butterscotch pudding.

Too sweet.  I should have read the reviews and cut the sugar, and maybe added some semi-sweet chocolate or something.  I  made the recipe as-is and it set up just fine, though.

Pretty tasty and quite simple.  Took a while to set up, but my family was eating them up before they had a chance!!  (I hid them in my room and my dad kept coming in asking for more.)  I really liked the uniqe taste the choc. pudding gave it.  I'm not sure I'd experiment with other pudding flavors, though.

I kept adding oatmeal until I thought it would set correctly, but I apparently didnt put enough (I stopped around 4 1/4 cup) because they are gooey and impossible to eat. I wont be trying this recipe again because the taste of the cookie doesnt even compare to the amount of fat these have in them (I mean, they're all butter and sugar basically.)

I love these no bakes!  They are easy to prepare and stay soft.  The regular no bakes I have tried get real hard and crumbly.  These are a winner. The pudding really adds to the flavor.

These were REALLY sweet! They would have been better with half the sugar called for. They also stayed really sticky and gooey. The flavour was great, though (I used banana pudding).

this is quite yummy. i guess i messed up by following directions to closely. sugar should not be put in the pot first. especially if you still need to cut up butter and retrieve the milk. it put caramel chunks in it which in turn caused it to not set up properly. thanks for sharing. i will make this again and try other varities.

The pudding idea got my interest as a change from my go-to recipe calling for unsweetened cocoa.  Used fudge chocolate pudding and old fashioned quick oats.  Bad results  - lacking flavor and much like eating wood chips.  They set up but remained somewhat sticky and required refrigeration.  I won't make these again.

These for me are just ok but i made with vanilla pudding and added 3/4 of a cup of toasted chopped almonds. My husband and kids on the hand loved them! They did turn pretty sticky but my kids liked that! I am a pretty hard core chocolate lover so next time i will try chocolate!

Made the recipe as directed but they came out sloppy. Still sitting on the wax paper refusing to form up. Going to the store since this was supposed to be for my secret santa.

I remember eating no bake cookies as a little girl! I'm so excited my son can partake in something from my childhood, because this is the first recipe I have seen without peanut butter.

They were okay, but I'm also not a huge no bake cookie person. Was able to use up that pudding packet I prob was never gonna get around to cooking, and its nice to have some cookies that are limited ingredients and super fast that doesn't make your house warm from baking.

I LOVE these - so easy and tasty. I also cut back on the sugar and didn't miss it at all. Also, it's definitely a good idea to boil for 3 minutes...my cookies' texture turned out very nice.

The ONLY thing I would change about this recipe is the amount of sugar.  I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and it was STILL to sweet for me.  I will reduce it to 1 cup next time for sure!!  Next time, Tapioca Pudding mix!!  Great recipe though!

Very easy and great during the summer months when you want something sweet without heating up the house. I reduced the sugar by half and it was still plenty sweet because of the pudding mix. I also added another 1/2 cup of oats just so it would be a thicker consistency...just our preference. Thanks for sharing!

These are pretty good. I used pistachio pudding because that's what I had. Topped each one with a pistachio nut. This is a great recipe for my daughter who is allergic to wheat if she'd eat them but all the adults thought they were good.

i made these with my son. he is 3 years old. i really enjoyed the time we shared making the cookies- but just as everyone else said- they weren't very pliable.  (we used artificial sweetener) My son enjoyed the cookies regardless their texture.

I had a really hard time with these! I followed the recipe exactly and my cookies never set up...they remained tacky ...so I put them in the fridge overnight and they were still soft and chewy this morning. Looking at the pictures I am thinking that is not how they are supposed to be.

I've been meaning to do a review for these for a while. I made them last year during my Christmas baking. I made them as directed and they were good but then I made them with my mother-in-law and we decided to experiment...We used lemon pudding and added craisins with the oats. I also added more oats than called for as recommended by other reviews. After they had set on the wax paper for a while, long enough to start setting. I rolled them into a ball and dipped each ball into melted white chocolate. And wow, were these super yummy!!!!

I'll stick with the more traditional no-bake cookies. The texture of these was too oatmeal-mushy. I also thought there was way to much sugar, and I had already decreased it by half a cup. Seriously, use the no-bake recipe - there is even a "no peanut butter" version for those of you who don't want peanut butter.  If you do make this recipe, make sure you use instant pudding.

I give this one star becuase it was just not good.  It sat on my counter for 2 weeks. I thought it would be a great alternative to my childhood favorite - but it just tasted like chocolate pudding with oatmeal in it....   I'll go back to the original recipe with cocoa powder.

I loved this recipe.  I love the pudding mix flavor.  I did add a bit more oats and boiled it for 3 minutes from the time that everything was boiling nice and bubbly.  I have also made this with the milk amount being a mixture of milk and strong coffee.  Also, I made a peanut butter sauce (I think there is one listed on this site) and drizzled that over the top instead of adding PB to the cookies.  That was snazzy and really good.  Thanks!!!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I tried it twice and neither time did the cookies set. I simply had chocolet oatmeal cookie clumps. They tasted great, but had to be eaten with a spoon.

I tried this recipe last Christmas and just found it again for this year.  I have made this with a number of different pudding flavors (pistacio is excellent).
