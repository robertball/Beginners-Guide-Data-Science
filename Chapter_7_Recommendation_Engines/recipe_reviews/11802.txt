My supper club has deemed this recipe "Emergency Sweat Pants" worthy - whenever I make it, they know not to wear jeans!  And I've learned to always double the recipe because they will frequently go back for a "mug of sauce" and some bread.

My modifications:
I saute my onion/garlic in olive oil, then pour in the red wine (merlot) and reduce it down (makes the flavor a little richer and deeper).  Then I pour in the rest of the ingredients (I use  one 28 oz. can of Dei Fratelli Tomato Sauce and one 28 oz. can of Dei Fratelli - Herbs & Olive Oil Chopped Italian Tomatoes plus one 6 oz. can of Contadina tomato paste) except for the meat.  I let it simmer for a few hours.  Then I brown a pound of ground sirloin with 3 cloves of garlic and add to the sauce.  Simmer for another hour, then serve.

I also like to use this as a baked spaghetti sauce.  I layer mixed pasta and sauce in the bottom of a casserole dish, cover with sheets of mozzarella,  more pasta and sauce, and top with mozzarella and grated parmagiana. 
 
DELICIOUS!

Thank you for the great recipe!

The end result with this recipe is always really great, but I only gave it four stars because I made some changes that I feel make a difference. I cut the herbs in half (made it once as written and we were all picking basil out of our teeth). I also use just one can of paste, and a can of tomato sauce. Diced tomatoes instead of whole, and ground beef instead of sausage (Hubby prefers). Overall, I love this recipe!

Wow is this ever good! A couple years ago I made spaghetti sauce, it was awful! It was so bad that I went back to the jar sauce. But tonight I was in the mood for spaghetti, and didn't have any jar sauce, and couldn't get to the store.  So I took a chance and decided one more time to try this homemade sauce. Glad I did. It truly is the best spaghetti sauce I've ever had, better even then what I have had in restaurants. It has a hearty taste and fresh taste. It's kind of hard to describe, it's so good. I did have to make a couple adjustments. I didn't have a can of whole tomatoes, so I used tomato sauce instead, and I only had one can of tomato paste, but that turned out good since the sauce was plenty thick. I had to keep adding water to it as it cooked down, so it wouldn't get too thick. I also had lots more garlic and onions, and a dash of Worstershire sauce. If your a little apprehensive about trying homemade spaghetti sauce, try this one. It is delish!

This is my favorite spaghetti sauce recipe! To make it lowfat, in addition to the onion & garlic, just chop up zucchini, yellow squash, celery, and a little bit of green pepper and sautee before adding the spices, tomato products and other ingrediets.  Leave out the sausage and you've got an amazing lowfat sauce that freezes well and has an awesome taste.  In my opinion, the red wine is essential as it makes the sauce have a smooth and velvety texture.  Delish!

This recipe turned out extremely well and my entire family raved about it.  I chose to cook this in the slow cooker for 8 hours and POW! what a sauce it turned out to be.  Very robust and thick, perfect for the crusty garlic bread we made with it for dipping.  I didn't use sausage but made homemade meatballs instead and put some sauteed ground beef in there as well.  The wine is what did it!  Excellent recipe.

I'm so sorry, but I just could not like this.  I had high hopes; it looked awesome, and it smelled wonderful!  But after the first bite, bf asked me how much sugar was in it bc he thought it was too sweet.  I thought it was too spicy, and not in a good way.  I did make a few changes; used fresh tomatoes (boiled for a minute in water so I could easily peel off the skins), used  a bit more garlic than normal,and eliminated the sausage, but I don't think those changes made the difference between loving it and hating it for me.  I love thick sauce, and it made it thick, so I'm willing to try again, but without crushed red pepper or sugar.  Neither of us liked those additions.  Update:  Tried this again, again with regular tomatoes I needed to use up.  Eliminated the sugar and the crushed red pepper.  Like it so much better without those two ingredients!  I'll make it that way from now on.

this is a very easy to make yet delicious sauce.  i usually use prego sauce from the jar when i need pasta sauce but this was so easy, i don't think i can ever justify buying the jarred variety again.  i halved the recipe and used one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes (with italian seasonings) and one 15 oz can of tomato sauce instead of paste (didn't have any). i also had to omit the red wine and pepper flakes (again, didn't have any on hand) and it turned out excellent.  what a great recipe for basic spaghetti sauce.  i looked at lots of other recipes for sauces and noticed that the higher rated ones always included dried basil, oregano and bay leaves.  i loved that even with the changes i made, this recipe is foolproof enough to still be good!  also, i cooked it in my slowcooker for 5 hours on low.

Absolutely delicious! This was my first try and I will never go back to a jar sauce again. The red wine definitely makes the sauce! I recommend using 1/3 the amount of red pepper flakes (I trippled the recipe) it came out a little on the hot side.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing and my mother made homemade sauce every Sunday. I made homemade meatballs instead of the sausage and served the parmesean garlic bread from this site on the side.

I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!!  This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's a very tangy, robust, and thick (not watery) spaghetti sauce.  I added about 1t. of salt and doubled the wine.  I will never use any other spaghetti sauce again and next time I will make about 3x the recipe and freeze it in portions.

Wonderful recipe! I was cooking for more people so I used 3 cans of tomato paste, 1 large can of whole tomatoes, and 1 large can of diced tomatoes. I like garlic and spices so used a little more of each. After I sauteed the onion...I put everything in the crockpot on low and let cook for 7-8 hours (just because I had the time...I have also done the same on high temp for 5-6 hours and it turned out just as good). This is SO easy and the BEST spaghetti sauce I have ever had...I will NEVER go back to jar sauce again. This can all be thrown together before you go to work...to cook all day. Love it!!  Made this again tonight...didn't have red wine on hand so I added 1/4 cup of chard and added a little more white sugar and 2 tsp of brown sugar. This time I left out the whole tomatoes and used 2 cans of dices tomatoes (and 3 cans of paste). Cooked on the stove for 4 hours...still YUMMY!!! I served with pasta and chicken parmesan (also used the sauce to cover the chicken). My husband LOVES it!

This is a really great recipe.  I liked how it cooked down to this thick red delicious sauce.  I cooked the sauce in a crock pot on low for 5 hours.

I chose to try this recipe as it appeared the most interesting in the list of sauces.  The thing to remember about sauces of this type is that the recipe is an outline.  The cook can have fun filling in the details.  Also, the benefit of lengthy cooking is that you can be creative while the batch is stewing.  This receiped did not include salt and pepper which the sauce clearly needs.  I would also adjust ingredients to taste. For example, on my first try, I added all the sugar at once.  This should be added gradually over time and tasting.  I also increased some ingredients such as the garlic and onion.  Pepper flakes could be omitted if preferred.  I added mushrooms which gave a nice texture.  If you use fresh herbs (as I did) remember to triple the amount.  A little squeeze of lemon also gives an interesting twist.  I'd like to hear the variations others may invent.

This sauce is so delicious and versatile.  I use ground beef (1 lb) or a combo of ground beef and italian sausage.  I brown it after the onions and garlic and then add the red wine to reduce to enrich the flavor.  I use a small can of tomato sauce instead of 2 cans of paste, some sliced mushrooms and throw the whole thing in the crock pot to cook all day if I don't have time to babysit a simmering pot.  If you can find REAL Italian tomatoes and paste USE IT!!!  The sauce takes on a brilliant taste and find a good italian Pasta... De Cecco is our favorite unless I'm doing fresh and making it myself.  This is a fantastic sauce that tastes even better the next day!  Love it and thank you so much for sharing a classic!  My dad made a very similar sauce and used to add chopped carrot to the sauce instead of sugar.  Just a thought.

As written, I'm not sure I would like this recipe, but I knew it had potential. Instead of Italian sausage, I opted for the healthier Italian-seasoned ground turkey. I crumbled and browned it with the onion and garlic and let it simmer in the sauce for a couple of hours. I also added 8 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms. I left out the sugar and used plenty of fresh ground black pepper instead of the red pepper flakes. I cut the amount of herbs in half. I like the thickness the sauce has with the addition of the tomato paste. It's a very hearty sauce and the splash of red wine is wonderful.

Okay.  I agree with other posters.  Too much basil.  Although, next time I may try fresh basil (and less of it) and add some thyme.

Oh, was I popular with this one! This sauce is thick and delicious and practically cooks itself. I let this cook all afternoon while I was out in the garden. I used italian style stewed tomatoes (which made the job even easier). I threw in some baked meatballs (to avoid the addition of unnecessary fat) during the last 10 minutes of cooking. With split french rolls and some mozzarella cheese, this made the most incredible meatball sandwiches ever! The next day, even after the meatballs were gone, they were still fighting over the leftover sauce. I'll make this again and again. Thanks!

Don't know what all the raves are about.  I didn't find this any better than my usual $1 can of Hunts in which I add hamburger, onion, and other spices to.  Won't make this again.  It's not awful, but isn't stellar either.

I didn't care for the whole tomatoes so I cut them up instead and used some diced stewed tomatoes with it.  I also used ground pork italian sausage instead of sausage links.  This recipe turned out REALLY good.  Kudos to the chef =)  Not hard to make either.  The key is to make sure you have at least 1 hour to let it simmer all the spices in for flavor.

I love this recipe; it's easy and the flavor is great.  My only complaint--and the reason for which I am giving it four out of five stars--is that it always comes out too thick.  I would suggest filling the empty tomato can with water after you've emptied it and pouring that in while it simmers.

This is a very hearty sauce. Wonderful flavor. I added fresh mushrooms, more water through the cooking, and left out the sugar. It was great. This will be my recipe for spaghetti.

As with many others, I gave this five stars because it is a great starter recipe. I had to doctor this up throughout the cooking process (simmered for 3 hours as called for) by adding equal parts of water and red wine. I also added sugar throughout as we like our sauce tangy with a sweet aftertaste. I added a sweet yellow pepper and mushrooms to give it more "meat" since I was not using the sausage (was using for chicken parm). After about cooking for an hour I mashed the tomatoes to make the consistency more "choppy". Overall a great recipe as is, I just doctored up for personal preference taste.

I have this on the stove right now.  For those of you who said this was too sweet or too bitter/herbal, let it simmer for the time indicated.  At about the 2 hour mark the raw sugar/sweetness taste went away and the slightly bitter after taste smoothed out and became much more well rounded.   Don't be so impatient, use the full three hours.  :-)

Delicious and easy. I did add some red peppers, used ground beef, and since I don't use wine and didn't have any appropriate substitutions I used chicken broth instead of wine. The sauce was very good and a little too thick (probably because of 2 lbs of ground beef) that I added an extra 14 oz of diced tomatoes.

This was good.  I did have to add some water during the simmering time. I also added some mushrooms.  This recipe is a keeper.

My family loved this sauce! I followed it almost to the "T".  Instead of Italian sauage, I used ground turkey the Italian flavored one. I also added 1TSB balsamic vinegar just before serving.

DANG! As a long-standing Preggo sauce purchaser, I was skeptical that a homemade sauce could taste as good as a good old jar of Preggo. BOY! Am I glad to say I was MAJORLY wrong! This was HANDS DOWN the most flavorful/wonderful/exquisite spaghetti sauce I have EVER had- bar none. DO try this one, you won't regret it.

This was so easy and way better than the usual jar.  I did use tomato sauce instead of paste and added a bit of Chicken Stock to boost flavor.  I also used 1 can of diced and 1 can of italian stewed.  The best sauce I ever made!!

This was an excellent sauce.  I used authentic italian sausage from The Hill in St. Louis and added a Tbls of fennel seed, which is an exciting addition to spaghetti sauce.  Also added half a bell pepper and a some fresh mushrooms.  All I can say is, WOW!!

This was a 5 star sauce with some modifications. I only used 1 tsp each of the dried herbs b/c I have heard that dried herbs are much more intense in flavor. I added another tsp of sugar, 1/2 tsp of salt and used Marsala wine, which I think helped counterbalance the acidity. I did have to thin out the sauce a bit.  I used a can of chicken broth to add flavor and another cup of water at the beginning and it was the perfect sauce consistency. I substituted ground sirloin for the sausage and the meat was very tender. 
This is a delicious sauce. I am very pleased to finally find a spaghetti sauce that I love and can pass on.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! The only thing I changed was leaving out the red wine (none on hand) and adding some water about halfway through- I like thick sauce, but it was getting almost dry. Might have been a problem with the range's temperature rather than the amount of water in the recipe.

this was my first go around with home  made spaghetti sauce and I was really concerned about the thickness and taste but the next day it was great. I really recommend making it the day before serving.

I've made this twice now, and both times it had a bitter taste to me.  I added mushrooms, which weren't called for in the original recipe.  Has anyone had a similar experience with this recipe?

I made this for a "date night" with my boyfriend so we could stay in and save money. Oh my goodness. I made it the night before and the house smelled so good, I didn't think I was going to be able to wait til the next day to eat it! I didn't use sausage, but instead bought pre made meatballs and they were fantastic with it! The bf took leftovers to work for lunch the next day and raved about how it was just as good as the night before!

The onion I used was GINORMOUS and I doubled the garlic (we like A LOT of garlic) and I used organic canned tomatoes/tomato paste. I had some organic red peppers I had to use so I threw them in to saute with the onion and garlic before adding the other ingredients. I did have to add a little more red wine as the sauce was a little on the thick side. After making it late this afternoon and letting it simmer, I do think it needs a little more of the spices before serving. I did not add the italian sausage (it was optional--so I opted out this time) because I did make Mixture for Meatballs, Meatloaf or Burgers to go in this sauce. Next time I make this sauce, I'll try it with a good italian sausage as I think it would be quite tasty, especially as a layer in lasagna. Very easy and I agree with the submitter--the longer it simmers, the better it gets!

I thought it was really good but kind of on the tangy side.  I had to add about a cup of water because it was so thick and starting to burn a bit even with the temp on low.  I also put it all in the blender to get rid of all the chunks. I would still make it again.

Yuuummmmy!  I followed ofortuna0675's slight modifications.  Also, I browned 1 pound italian sausage and added to sauce during last hour of cooking instead of doing the links in recipe.  I know, shouldn't be rating with so many modifications but I really don't believe these changed the overall taste of recipe significantly.

Made this tonight and I finally figured out what was missing all these years from every Spaghetti Sauce I ever made... RED WINE!!! It was excellent. I didn't want to run out to the store this afternoon when I stumbled upon this recipe so I had to make a few substitutions - 1.) I only had one can of tomato paste so I reduced a can of tomato sauce down a bit and it work fine. 2.) I used ground beef instead of Italian Sausage. Thanks for a great recipe!

Put everything except the meat into the crock pot for about 6 hours.  Browned the meat (half hot Italian sausage and half ground beef) and added it in when we were ready to eat.  WE LOVED IT!!!!  I forgot to saute the onion and garlic before putting it in, but it softened and flavors melded perfectly as it cooked.

I was anxious to try making this particular spaghetti sauce because of all the reviews. I was not disappointed. The sauce cooked up thick, rich and very red. I made meatballs too but did NOT add them to the sauce because not everyone at our dinner party enjoys meat. In my opinion, I thought that it could have used a little bit more garlic but this is just a personal preference. I added a teaspoon of salt but later felt like it would have been just fine without it, do you know what I mean? I chopped the onions but not finely, and I used 1/2 bulb of the big elephant garlic which is sweet and tasty. Maybe I should have used more garlic since it was my first time using the elephant garlic but it was just fine for others. After I brought everything to a boil I reduced the stovetop setting to #2/simmer on my electric stove and covered the pot. I made sure to watch it so that it would ot continue to boil but to just simmer. I removed the bay leaves at the very end, before serving. I also stireed the sauce every 20 minutes or so because I didn't want it getting too hot on the bottom of the pan and scorching. Initially I doubled the recipe because we were having 4 guests besides my husband and myself. I wanted to make sure to have plenty of sauce for everyone's spaghetti. It was perfect by doubling the recipe. Next time though I intend to triple the recipe so that I can have leftovers to freeze. And there WILL be a next time!

I used tomato puree instead of tomato paste.  Turned out very good... a little on the sweet side.  I might leave out the sugar next time, but this is definitely a keeper.

This is a good, solid base recipe. It allows alot of wiggle room to adjust it to meet your family's tastes. I made as written, but felt it was too sweet for my preferences. I added a can of stewed tomatoes, some more basil, and a little parsley, which helped alot. I also sliced up some carrots, celery, and mushrooms and added them. Instead of the optional Italian sausage, I browned a half pound of ground beef with more garlic and added that to the sauce. Finally, I don't have a dutch oven so after sauteeing the garlic and veggies, I threw everything in the crockpot and let it cook on low for about 4 hours. Then I added the mushrooms and ground beef and let it cook for another hour. All in all, great base recipe. The end result was the best sauce I've ever made. Thanks :)

Great basic marinara recipe - simmering for that long really changes the flavour. I left out the onion & only put about 3/4 of a can of tomato paste - it just seemed too much too thick to put 2 cans in. Will definitely make a double batch next time & freeze.

Yummy! I cooked this tonight for my parents and grandmom. I doubled the recipe since it said that it freezes well. Used petite diced tomatoes instead of whole (Dad prefers). Used 1lb of Sweet Italian Sausage and 1lb of regular hamburger and added some mushrooms for my mom. We didn't have enough basil- but used marjoram for the 2 tbsp I was short. My dad likes to give me pointers to improve my cooking - he ate 2 plates (and no pointers - which is a first for a spaghetti recipe from me!)Will definitly add to my go to recipes.

This has been my go to recipe for sauce. The family refuses to eat anything else. Some people said that it was too bitter. It depends on what tomato base you are using. I used fresh from the garden and it was very bitter. Sugar can be -/+ depending on what you are using. Also, this is a let it simmer kinda recipe. I usually let it simmer for about 4hrs+. The less it simmers the less the flavors combine together, which can give the impression of "salsa" that others have mentioned. Never had it be too sweet, so not sure what's going on there. Basically...taste test at various stages of cooking. You can always adjust while it's still in the pot, but not so much once on the plate.

5 Yummy Stars! I followed as directed. Even though forgot the red wine it was still wonderful. I was worried about the amount of basil, (it's a lot of basil), however, I really liked how this is packed full of flavor, but it can be adjusted, if prefered. The whole tomatoes were an odd addition that I loved when I ate it. I kind of, mashed them up a bit to release that tomato-y flavor and make it easier to eat. All around winner this recipe is!

I was hoping that this would be great but it was just ok.  It was too bitter for our tastes.  I let it cook the entire 3 hours and followed the recipe exactly except to add more sugar to try and reduce the bitterness.  It seemed very pasty.

I too made the following changes:  I opted for lean ground beef instead of pork (just a personal perferance), I sauteed the onion til translucent, added the garlic, sauteed an additional minute, added the ground beef and browned until all pink was gone. I then placed all the other ingredients in the crock pot, along with the beef, onion and garlic and placed on slow 6 hour cook time and went about my day! We tossed with home made pasta noodles just before serving!

This sauce was excellent. I doubled the garlic, cut up the whole tomatoes, added extra red pepper flakes and fresh black pepper, and added fresh parsley and sauteed mushrooms in butter. I omitted the sausage as I make my own meatballs.

Spaghetti Sauce II Haiku: "Pretty darn good sauce. Glad I added the sausage. I barely changed it." I only had 1 can of tom. paste, so I added tom. sauce, along w/ a handful of chopped bell pepper in addition to the onions. Smelled great simmering, and I tossed in the optional Italian sausage that I'd cut into bite-size pieces and browned. I like that this sauce clung to the noodles and wasn't watery. I'll definitely make it again.

Very good sauce but it was too thick and it was going to burn. I had to add 1 can of 28 oz water.  I also added 1 teaspoon of salt.  Everything else is the same.  Thanks.

This was amazing.....I had to make a few changes because I didn't expect the cans of whole tomatoes in my pantry to be 3 years past their expiration date, but I took some tips from another reviewer and then improvised from there. For the tomato products I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes with Italian herbs, three 8 oz cans of tomato sauce (one 28 oz would have worked), and one 6oz can of tomato paste. I dislike tomato chunks, so the crushed tomatos worked out perfect for me. I sauteed the garlic and onions in the oil and tossed the 1/4 cup of wine (Shiraz) to reduce a bit. I had to run errands and didn't have time to babysit the stove, so I threw everything in a crock pot (except for the meat) and let it simmer for the two hours I was gone. When I came back, I sauteed a tsp of minced garlic, added 1lbs of ground pork to the sautee pan, and just to make the cooking experience divine, I added a cup of the sauce to the pork just as it started to brown. Subbing ground beef or ground turkey would be fine, I just have a lot of pork I need to use! When the pork was cooked through I added it to the crock pot and let it cook for another hour, stirring as needed. I had the crock pot on high with the lid off and a splatter screen on when I was home, on low and covered when I wasn't. If using the crock pot, give yourself a little extra time as the low setting takes longer to get the sauce up to temp than a stove does. Maybe consider preheating the tomato products in the pan.

This sauce is tangy, but you can cut back on the tomato paste and add tomato sauce as other reviewers mentioned. The red wine really gives it great flavor - I used an inexpensive Sangiovese. I also used canned whole plum tomatoes, small cans of paste/sauce, added sea salt, white and black peppers and increased the amounts of garlic and red pepper flakes. This is a great base recipe that you can taste as you go and change to your liking. I used half of the sauce for a chicken pasta skillet: cooked chicken, bell peppers, mushrooms, cooked rotini and mozzarella/parmesan cheeses and then froze the other half to save for spaghetti another night. Thank you Melinda for a great starter recipe and for those that reviewed and gave tips.

This sauce is pretty okay.  It has a slightly different taste than what I am used to, but it's alright.  It's easy to make, which is also a plus, and seems like it would work well in a slow cooker.  I feel like it needs something else, though.  Salt, maybe?

This is a really good sauce and easy to make. However, I did think it was a bit too tangy for spaghetti and couldn't get the after taste out of my mouth so I added a bit of baking soda to reduce the tangy flavor. After that, the rest of the flavors then seemed more balanced with just a hint of tang in the background. I also added more garlic because we love garlic, but if I made it for a larger group it would be the perfect amount.

Very good written as is.  Didn't have all of the ingredients the second time I made it, so I changed it with terrific results:  1/2 pound ground sausage, 1/2 pound ground beef (seasoned both with garlic salt and onoin powder), 1 large can of crushed tomatoes Italian style, 1/4 cup red wine, 1 large can of tomato paste and 2 smaller cans of tomato sauce (can add more tomatoe sauce if result is too strong.  Forgot the bay leaves. Browned and drained meat and tossed everything in the crockpot on low for 6 hours.  Smelled and tasted terrific and didn't have  a lot of cleanup (used liner) or prep.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We liked this recipe as written.  Had company and this went very quickly. I will definately make again. 
 Note-I also made a second batch with some ground beef that I needed to use and not sausage. Not as good, the sausage in the recipe really seemed to make a difference for us.

I have a recipe for spaghetti sauce that has been in my Italian family for years. It's really delicious, but I wanted to try something different and something that wouldn't take all day as the family recipe does. This was fantastic and quick!!! I didn't change a thing, which is really unusual for me, and it was perfect! I served it over my Chicken Parmesan (so I added no meat to the sauce) for a dinner party over the holidays and it was a big hit! Thank you!!!

This sauce is very good, however, I do think the basil and oregano should be reduced. When I made it the first time as written I had to add jarred sauce to dilute the herbs. I will make this sauce again, just cut down on the herbs next time.

I thought this was pretty good.  It was a little too tomato pastey for me but the wine was an excellent addition.  I might try this again and use less paste and maybe something else in its place.  Many people complained about the thickness but I thought the thickness of the sauce was perfect.  Spices were perfect portions.  Overall it was excellent.  Family loved it!

I replaced the wine with grape juice and 1T of Red Win Vinegar.  I also sauteed Mushrooms with the garlic and onion.  I chopped up one homemade meatball and added it to the sauce the last hour to give a slight meat taste.  Turned out fabulous- ease to make in the Crockpot.

Delicious! I've tried several spaghetti sauce recipes on this site, and they've mostly been decent, but I've continued to search for that perfect sauce, and I think this is it! I did everything as directed EXCEPT for the 2 bay leaves - I only had dried bay leaves so I just sprinkled some in. I threw everything in the crockpot after sauteing the onion and garlic and let it all simmer for a few hours on low. VERY tasty!!! Thank you!

this was great, hubby gobbled it up!  spaghetti sauce recipes are so versatile and this is a great starter and then add more seasonings depending on your taste buds.  I did substitute one can of tomato paste for a can of tomato sauce like someone else suggested.

I can't believe the mixture of great flavors!  I don't think I'll ever be happy with jarred sauce again.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was fantastic! The flavor was so rich and delectable. I slow cooked it for about 10 or 11 hours, and it definitely made it even better. Make sure you plan ahead because you definitely want to let the flavors stew together for a while before eating it!

This is a great recipe. I'm glad I waited until the second day before reviewing. When I first made it I was  disappointed, it was just ok. On the second day though, it was great. Flavors just needed that extra time to come together. I didn't have enough basil so I used a Tbls of Italian Seasoning.

This was great.  I used fresh oregano from my garden and bulk sausage made into meatballs.  My kids & hubby loved it.  Next time I'll triple the batch and freeze it for a busy night.

Delicious!!! I doubled the recipe but instead of using 4 cans of tomato paste, I only used 3.I also added 1 green & 1 red pepper that I passed through the blender prior to putting it in the sauce. I used spicy italian sausage for an extra punch. I removed the casing and made little meat balls and browned them lightly prior to adding them to the sauce. I used this sauce to make lasagna and put a meat ball on top of every serving. Let me just say that the aroma was exquisite and flavor amazing!!! 2 thumbs up.

I made this (without the sausage)to serve over chicken parmigiana and spaghetti, using diced tomatoes, but I found it to be too thick (and I normally like a thick sauce). Also, it actually had a bitter taste to it. Maybe it was the wine I used (Merlot). I'll try this again though, using a sweeter wine like Rose, use equal amounts of oregano and basil, and add a small can of tomato sauce.

This is pretty good once you get past the fact that if you make it as advised, you'll end up with a pretty solid glob of 'sauce'. ADD 2 cups of water to this, then keep another couple of cups handy throughout the simmer, there's not nearly enough liquid in this to qualify it as a sauce, really. It's tasty though.

I made this today for Sunday dinner & it was wonderful.  I doubled the recipe & made 2 changes & one addition.  I used crushed canned tomatoes instead of whole & I cooked in my slow cooker on high for 4 ½ hours.  I did add some mushrooms to the sauce. 

I caught my boyfriend making a sandwich out of the sausage & sauce before it had finished cooking.  Then he had 3 servings for dinner.  I served it over noodles with salad & garlic bread.

This one is defiantly a keeper.  Will definitely make this again.

This sauce was extremely tasty, far better than what you would get in the jar. I followed this recipe as written except that I added a finely chopped red bell pepper and about 1.5 cups of finely chopped mushrooms. I also used italian spiced ground turkey meat in leu of the sausage. We put the sauce on whole wheat fettucini, and it was probably the best pasta I've ever made at home.

Mama Mia Melinda! This sauce rocks! I used ground chuck that I cooked in right with the onions at the start. I added about 3 T sugar and 1 tsp kosher salt. My 1/4 tsp of red pepper was heaping. I used Riunite wine, simmered for 3.5 hours and this turned out nice and had a rich flavor. Not too acidic. My DH asked for me to keep this one and make it again.

Delicious! I didn't feel like shopping, so I looked for a spaghetti sauce to match the ingredients I had on hand, and this was the closest. The only change my cupboard demanded that I make was to use a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes and a 14 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the paste. And it turned out great! I was also short on time and simmered it for just over two hours instead of three which didn't seem to be a problem. I threw in some frozen meatballs during the last 30 minutes and of course topped it with freshly grated parmesan cheese. My husband loved it and even got some more to dip his garlic toast in. Thanks for a yummy, easy spaghetti sauce recipe. I guess I've doomed myself to cooking it from scratch from now on!

This is a great foundation recipe, but I noticed that most of the good reviews have "buts". It's great, but....

First - too much sugar. I dialed it back a bit. Instead of a tablespoon do 1/2 or 3/4. 

Second- too much red pepper.  Cut that in half. I don't like gravy that makes me sweat.

Third - use crushed tomatoes rather than whole unless you want giant chunks of tomato in your gravy.

I've used this recipe twice. It is awesome with some tweaking. For my family of 5, I doubled everything except for the sugar and red pepper. The recipe produces a super thick gravy, so I also cut back on the tomato paste. I added 3/4 lb of ground pork and 1 lb. of sweet sausage (cooked and cut up). 

I definitely got it right with the second attempt. Again, the recipe provides a great foundation that you can modify to suit your tastes.

So good! I kept catching my husband eating the sauce. I doubled the recipe except for the basil and only used one can of paste. I used two 14.5 oz cans of fire roasted tomatoes (one diced; one crushed), one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with roasted garlic , an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, and one 8 oz can of tomato sauce with basil, garlic and oregano. We try not to have sugar in our diets as much as possible, so I used Pyure instead of the sugar. Then I cooked up 1 pound ground pork, 12 oz ground bison, and a small amount of Italian sausage which I added to the sauce once it was done cooking.

I did not know that a homemade spaghetti sauce could be this easy. Based on a few other reviews, I used my crock pot, which made the process even easier.  The only changes that I made were using 2T of sugar instead of 1T, and I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole, since that's what I had on hand.  I used Cabernet-Merlot for the wine, and this sauce is wonderful.  I don't think I'll be using the store-bought stuff again!  Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe.

My only child loooooooooves spaghetti. I have always made sauces from scratch, but it was always "a little of this, a little of that," whatever I had on hand, as far as canned tomato products (diced, stewed, sauce, paste). And I'd throw in sweet peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, any vegetable sitting around that might reasonably work in a spaghetti sauce. I even used my hand blender to try to hide veggies from my daughter when she was little. Haha. (She told me in her mid-teens that I wasn't fooling anybody.). Anyway, I now find myself an empty nester... my baby has moved out. I'm going to visit her for the holiday weekend and wanted to assemble a care package. Naturally, any care package would have to include spaghetti sauce. I looked around for a recipe, to see how other people make (legit?) home-made sauce, and this was one of the best rated... and it sounded pretty good. Simple. So I tried it, it's been simmering for about 2-1/2 hours so far. I followed the ingredients and method almost exactly-I didn't have a whole onion, so I supplemented with green pepper, I used cranberry flower honey instead of white sugar, and I added a little thyme along with the second Tbsp basil. I am loving the samples I'm taking every time I stir, deeper flavor every time. I'm sure my daughter will love this and feel a warm embrace from home any time she pulls one of the jars out of the freezer... along with Chef John's Italian Meatballs, which I'm making as an accompaniment. Thank you SO much!

This was a great starter recipe for me. What I love about this website is the reviews other people put and after I read a few of them I made some adjustments. One, I don't like the taste of tomato paste so I only use one can of that and because of that I only one or two TEASPOONS of sugar not a tablespoon. And I don't add crushed red pepper either but with my adjustments I really really enjoy this sauce.

Oh my goodness, I accidentally raited the wrong recipe! This is the one that I meant to give five stars and that my family loved! Here is what I wrote, about THIS sauce! 

This is an excellent sauce. My husband is Turkish and dislikes the sauces from a jar that I will grab to make a fast meal. In Turkey they "cook by the season" so sauces are freshly made and prepared at home most of the time. The other day I got a great find at the farmer's market;a whole box of just past ripe tomatoes for only $3. They were at the point that they were juicy but would not be good in a salad or for slicing so I peeled, seeded and chopped what came to a full gallon bag of fresh tomatoes. I used two large onions, extra garlic, added some fresh oregano that the owner of the market threw in and a tbsp of thyme (my hubby's favorite herb). I also kept the tomato paste, but that was the only thing canned. At the end we added two pounds of lean ground beef. It fed us all and left two quarts for freezing the next time we have spaghetti. I will definitely be making this again and using canned tomatoes in a pinch, but I truly recommend using fresh tomatoes if you can. It is so worth the effort for the amazing flavor! (For this recipe I'd guess 6-8 tomatoes would do the trick!)

This sauce is awesome!!! It was so fun and easy. Brought back memories of cooking with my mother when I was young. I made a triple batch and froze it. Can't wait until it's gone so I can do it over again. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!

It was great! I cooked the onions and  garlic in olive oil first, then added all the ingredients. Also, cooked a pound of beef ( ground beef) and 1/2 lbs of ground turkey ... Cooked with garlic ( 3cloves). Put only 1/4 sugar and 1/4 crushed red peppers. Everyone looooved it!

This was pretty good. It was a little sweet/acidic for me - I think next time I'll cut the tomato paste in half.

It sounded promising, but it has too much paste and sugar, and no salt. It literally sat like a clump on top of the spaghetti. It needs quite a bit of tweeking to make it dinner worthy.

Rich and hearty even without the meat.  This is a must have tomato sauce for any vegetarian who misses the deep hearty taste of meat sauce.

Delicious recipe! I add tons of veggies (carrots, olives, yellow squash, mushrooms and anything else I might have on hand). I also sautee the veggies with a little bacon and or pepperoni for flaveor and leave out the meatballs for a tasty more weight watcher friendly version. I
While I cut the recipe in half, it still provides way more servings than suggested.

I hate to leave negative reviews, but I did not like this sauce. It was very bitter and acidic. I had to add some salt, as it just wasn't flavorful. I won't make it again. Sorry.

My hubby & I really like this sauce.  If anything tho I feel it is a little too thick but this is no big deal. My husband liked it so much he asked me to triple the recipe so we could keep on hand in the freezer. I did not use a whole onion but a half & I used 1 tsp of minced garlic......tasty!! I did not put in the red pepper either. This is for the serving of (6) sauce.

This sauce is amazing... I did everything the same but added garlic salt to the sauce and a littles more sugar. My 8 year old son asks me every week to make this sauce and I've also made it for friends who ask me to save them some when I make it. A+ sauce!

Very good recipe! The only changes I made were adding more garlic, doubling the crushed red peppers, and using seasoned ground beef instead of sausage. Can't go wrong with this recipe though.

I made this today and thought it was great.  Sauce was a little thicker than I expected but I like a sauce that stays on the pasta.  Added the half cooked hot italian sausage about a half hour into the process.  Very pleased with the flavor.

This was my first attempt at homemade spaghetti sauce. I will Never buy jar again. This was so easy and OMG good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes. I put everything in a crockpot and cooked on low for about six hours. Three hours into cooking I added 1/2Lb cooked sweet italian susage and 1/2 Lb cooked ground beef. I poured this sauce over pasta and added mozzarella cheese. I served this at a baby shower and it got rave reviews.

Amazing served over fresh pasta!  Everyone went for seconds or thirds.  Used fresh basil and I added a healthy does of salt, but it's a brilliant recipe that fills the kitchen with a delicous smell (my neice and nephew kept saying how good it smelled as we rolled out the pasta).

This is a delicious sauce with a classic marinara taste (i.e. it has just a hint of spice). To get that flavour though, you MUST put in the sausage meat: a true spaghetti sauce has the sausage meat stewing along with the tomatoes and other veggies. Which reminds me: my big complaint, and the only reason it isn't five stars, is that it could incorporate far more vegetables. I add mushrooms, thinly sliced carrots, and red peppers to my sauce, and doing that means you don't need any sugar added.

Pretty good!  This sauce is really thick if you stick to the recipe.  I kept adding equal parts wine & water through out the cook time.  Next time, i'll brown the sausage in the pot and remove before adding the other ingredients, I thought doing this in a separate pan wasted a layer of flavor!

Great sauce.  We are making this for eggplant parmesan tomorrow night (so we will know more then).  So far, it has a great flavor and consistency.  We changed a few things:  1) I sauteed the onion and garlic, then added the wine and simmered down.  2) Set aside the onion mixture and 3) we used fresh tomatoes from the farmers market (two big brandywines and two incipid store-bought romas).  I sliced them up, threw them in a pan with a little olive oil and then crushed with my potato masher.  4) as others suggested I halved the green spices and it was plenty flavorful, 5) I used only one can of tomato paste.

I used many of the modifications suggested by ofortuna0675 and added my own modifications:  Sauté the onion/garlic in olive oil, then pour in the red wine (merlot) and reduce.  Pour in one 28 oz. can of Dei Fratelli - Herbs & Olive Oil Chopped Italian Tomatoes, two 6 oz. cans of tomato paste, two cups of beef broth.  Brown one pound of ground beef and add to the sauce.  Sauté one green pepper and mushrooms and add to the sauce.

this was really good, I ended up having to add more water than it called for because the sauce was way too thick. I added a total of 1.5 cups of water and was still totally thick and yummy.

Wonderful!  We will never buy canned sauce ever again!  This is so easy and flavorful - I would recommend that everyone at least give this a try.  We let it simmer for only about an hour, but it still turned out better than I expected!  I used a little more pepper and an Italian seasoning blend (spices in a jar), and will probably do that again if I don't have fresh herbs handy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome Sauce.  Froze the leftover sauce and it was great served with meatballs as an appetizer.

I love spaghetti but hate store bought sauce. My kids would never eat homemade sauce and preferred store bought. Forget left overs...they were always tossed.  This recipe is definitely a keeper. My kids love it. We have had it once a week for the last month and there are never left overs! I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out awesome each time. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent sauce.  Tasted just like my grandmas!! I used one can of paste and one can of sauce and started the sauce by browning one pound of lean ground beef with the onions and garlic.  I didnt' even need the meatballs.  Freezes well, and it has become my go-to when I need to bring a dish to someone.

I made this sauce for dinner last evening and I have to say, this is by far one of the best spag sauces I have ever made. Being an italian, I always make my own sauce and have tried many different recipes. I decided to try this recipe becauce I wanted to try something new and am I glad I made this. My husband and I loved it. I have to be honest, this sauce taste almost like my grandmas. It taste even better the day after.  I will be making this often. Debra

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe.  Especially after reading the great reviews.  It was very hearty, but it came out tasting like you mixed a jar of salsa in.  I didn't like the spicy aspect of it.  I'd much rather go buy a jar of Bertolli sauce than make this again.

I made this recipe because we are big fans of Italian food and I am always on the look-out for the ultimate spaghetti sauce. It is surely a sauce with some zing to it. I only gave it a four because I find the sauce way to thick. I am freezing it for later, so when I cook it, I will probably add some water to it to thin it down a bit before I put in my meatballs. I did omit the Italian sausage but I don't think that would have thinned it out. All in all, I think it is a great sauce and very tasty. Thanks

First, want to say that I have a cold right now so...hard for me to taste that well. But I made just the sauce (made meatballs from a different recipe). The only thing I left out was 1 can of the paste. It was the pefect consistency. This was excellent (from what I could tell). My brother absolutely raved over it! Thanks MELINDA!

This was pretty darn good. Instead of canned tomatoes I added 28oz fresh Tomatoes from my garden, my home drown basil and oregano and a lil home grown Zucchini too. I never make red sauce from scratch and I loved this sauce. So did my 3 yr old who doesn't like tomato sauce usually. Thanks

This is a great sauce!  I also added a couple of large fresh tomatoes that I put in the food processor.  The time element definitely makes a difference in the flavor and thickness of the sauce.

I have made my own sauce for years, but decided to try this one day on a whim.  My family really enjoyed it and so did I.  The wine gives it a rich taste and aroma, but I think the most important thing is the time element.  You definitely need the 3 hours + cooking time for the sauce to cook down and the flavors to meld.  I used ground beef, rather than the Italian sausage because I had it on had and it worked well.  I also upped the wine to a half cup.

This was really really good! I used this sauce to make meatball sandwiches. I sauteed the onions and garlic, then put all the ingredients into the crock pot with the meat balls, cooked on high for 4 hours and they were great!  This is definitely a keeper. I may never buy jarred sauce again!

Fantastic basic recipe! I think every good cook makes a recipe their own by adding their own seasonings and such, but I am giving this 5-stars because this gives you what you need as a great starter.  Cooking this in the crockpot for the afternoon really made this rich and thick, just how my family enjoys it. I added cooked, shredded chicken for a nice change, in place of beef.

We loved this sauce. I used diced fire roasted tomatoes instead of whole because that is what we like and I didn't add the meat. I cooked it on low in the slow cooker over night and we had it for lunch after church on Sunday. I had to add some chicken stock to thin it out, but that is probably due to the long cooking time. Next time I will add less red pepper, but other than that I will make it exactly the same actually, I think I will double it and freeze the leftovers.

Fantastic. Made it with the wine and it was good but I would not add more wine than that. Made with fresh mushrooms and green pepper.

I will never buy spaghetti sauce in a jar again!  This is a simple yet tasty recipe.  I did make some changes b/c I was using this for a bake pasta dish.  When I followed the recipe it was a little thick for a bake pasta dish so I added a 28oz can of tomato sauce.  Added a tad more of the other ingredients.  When I am making spaghetti, I ommit the tomato sauce.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Only change I made was cutting up the sausage before adding it and blending one of the cans of tomato in the blender -  I don't like the huge chunks.  The taste was great, but the sauce was a little runny, probably from the blender action. Maybe i'll put more paste in it next time. Will keep this recipe though.

This is the best spaghetti sauce I have ever tasted!!!  My family and friends love it and it is so easy to make.  I will never, ever buy spaghetti sauce from a can or jar again!  In fact, I've been to a couple of Italian restaurants but their sauce can't compete with this one.  Enjoy!

One word sums this up...EXCELLENT! I've tried Many spaghetti sauce recipes and this by far is the tastiest! I added homemade meatballs about an hour into the cooking and they came out fabulous! Adding the meatballs uncooked and letting them cook in the sauce made it exceptionally delicous! Thankx for sharing!

One word; DELICIOUS. I've got mine going in the slow-cooker right now. My house smells like heaven. I just had a taste and I can hardly wait for dinner. My only changes were that I cut back on the basil and oregano, because of using the slow-cooker. I know their flavor power can increase if it cooks all day. I used tomatoes from the garden (chopped them up) rather than canned. (Boil one minute so the skins slip off). This was a great way to use up all the tomatoes from the garden. I'll never buy jar sauce again. Thank you for an AWESOME recipe. I'm going to make meatballs when the kids get home, boil the pasta and we'll be ready to go.

It was my first try at making my spaghetti sauce and like so many others found this recipe to be easy and terrific.  I used two cans of tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes because it was what I had and it turned out terrific!

Great recipe! Made this with HOT Italian sausage and a bit of the red pepper, a 1/2 teaspoon of fennel, and a dash of rosemary, and we got a great, spicy, flavorful spaghetti sauce! Next time we'll probably use regular Italian sausage, perhaps halved with ground beef, and I'm sure it'd be great.

This was great, thank you.  For my substitutions, I used a 26oz bottle of strained tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomatoes.  For one, my Organic co-op doesn't have whole peeled tomatoes, and for two, the strained makes great pasta sauce (it even says so on the bottle, lol!)  Also, it didn't exactly tell you what to do with the Italian sausage, so my idea was to take it out of the casing (I got my sausage uncooked, NOT smoked like they usually sell) and crumbled it.  Then I added all this to the sauce pot. Other than that, I will definitely be using this recipe again!  UPDATE: I made this with some different tomato paste and noticed a mistake I made.  The tomato paste was naturally sweet and as I didn't take this into account I added the sugar anyway.  Needless to say, it was way too sweet!  Be sure to try your tomato paste before you throw it in.  If it is sweet, do not add sugar!

This recipe is really simplistic but absolutely wonderful.  I did have to make a couple of changes. Instead of 1/4 cup of wine, I added 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth. I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes.  Also I only had ground oregano, so I used 1/2 tsp of that.  Otherwise it is just like the recipe and it makes enough to divide and freeze half.  I won't ever buy sauce from the store again. Thanks for a great new favorite in our house!

This is a good, tasty sauce recipe.  I didn't use the sausage.  I used ground beef instead.  Next time I'll try it with sausage.  I added some Spicy Spaghetti seasoning and some fresh sliced mushrooms.

I made this sauce last night to freeze so I would have it on hand later and as it cooked I kept tasting it and it was just getting better and better! I omitted the onion and sausage and just put the garlic in with the rest of the ingredients I also used stewed tomatoes as I didn't have whole tomatoes. The combination of spicy and sweet is wonderful.

great easy recipe. I have been looking for a recipe that was similar to my mom's that she got from her father who was from Italy. This was even better. I like a sauce that has a bite to it and is not sweet. This was perfect! thank you.

Really yummy!  I just used the roll of italian sausage, as I couldn't find links at the store, so I crumbled it and browned it like hamburger meat.  Right now it's all simmering together in the slow-cooker.  I had a taste of it, and it is really good!  I can't wait until dinner tonight!

Fantastic! Like other cooks, I used the the ingredients I had at home, like 2 cans of whole tomatoes(instead of 1) and 1 can of tomato sauce in place of the tomato paste. I also used 1/2 italian sausage and 1/2 ground beef and used a lot more wine (a zin). Very yummy!

I made a double batch yesterday and it was FANTASTIC.  I used pork chops instead of sausage and let it simmer for 6 hours.  It was the richest, thickest, tastiest sauce I have ever had.

Really yummy, I made a few changes.. it was quite thick so I ended up adding water and more red wine. I also threw in some hot sauce and extra red pepper flakes.  We liked this so much we had it on pizza the very next night.  I will follow this recipe for my spaghetti from now on. Thank you!

This recipe is much better used as a pizza sauce since it is thick and strong.  I doubled the wine (Mogan David concord grape), added a small can of tomato sauce and simmered until smooth.  I freeze it in containers for single pizza size portions.  It makes delicious pizza when paired with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust.  My family loves it!

I made this and it was thick and not at all watery like some sauces can be, which I really liked.  But even after adding the sugar, the sauce seemed rather acidic and just lacked something I couldn't quite put my finger on.  I would rate this as a fair sauce, but not great.  I am glad that I tried it, but honestly don't know that I will make it again.

I doubled the recipe - but went easy on the basil and sugar, as some other reviews suggested - and cooked this in my slow cooker on low for about 7 hours or so. It turned out really good. As other reviewers have said, the wine really makes this sauce delicious! I definitely plan to make this again.

The BEST sauce recipe I have ever made. Rich and full of flavour. I substituted (2) 18 oz cans of Italian Stewed tomatoes rather than a large can of whole tomatoes and it was wonderful.

This was perfect.  I never follow a recipe for sauce, decided to look one up.  Didn't have tomato paste, it was still delicious.  Think the wine made the difference.

Good meatball recipe. Nothing stand-out.  Followed recipe to a "T" except did not add the hot pepper flakes.  My husband is the meatball aficionado  so this is his rating.  ( I would score it a five myself).

While I personally found it to be absolutely delicious (has a taste similar to Prego, for those wondering), the rest of the family thought it was a bit too sweet. Going to halve the sugar next time, otherwise this fragrant sauce was AMAZING. I omitted the red pepper flakes since my meatballs had some already, but the red wine incorporated so well into the taste, and went wonderfully with them. I also halved the tomato paste since it was plenty thick enough with one.

03/23/2017   So I just made this tonight for my wife  and me. I followed the video very carefully and added everything  that the video told me with no changes all except the red pepper and the sausage in which I did not add  When making it, the sauce smelled very good.  I noticed that the pot in the video had way more liquid than mine. Mine was not liquefied at all. After tasting it I thought it was too sweet and my wife thought that it had to much basil and had a sour taste due to the dry red wine. I did use Merlot. We both thought that it was to pasty and to thick for our tasting.  If I make this again  I would definitely lessen the amounts and eliminate the sugar.  I would add water and tomato sauce.

I really liked the flavor.  Feeding growing athletes I find I'm having to double recipes so they can enjoy more than one meal.  I also added 1 lbs. each Ground Beef and Itlaian.  I did use a little cornstrach to thicken.  This will be my go to from now on.

Very delicious sauce.  I only used 1 can of paste and omitted the  bay leaves because I didn't have any.  I also placed  sausage in the sauce to cook without first frying.  The sauce came out more on the brown side  than red but was excellent.  I will definitely make this again.

I chose this recipe to go over homemade zoodles (spiralized lightly cooked zucchini). I had read that zoodles turn out a bit watery, so I wanted a thick sauce  to combat this. However, My zoodles didn't turn out watery, they were perfect and this sauce was the perfect compliment to them! except I reduced the pepper and skipped the sausage, and I had tomato paste with Italian seasoning already in it. I will repeat! I broke up the whole tomatoes after about an hour. It was wonderfully thick and delicious!

I loved this sauce. I needed it quicker though, so I made it as directed, but ate it within the hour. I only added red pepper flakes and more garlic (we love spicy and garlic things). I also wanted a different texture so I used an immersion blender to puree the pepper and tomatoes. We really enjoyed this sauce and the texture. The leftovers are simmering now so I'll see if that makes a real difference.

We have made this multiple times over the past few years, and it never disappoints.  It is dark, rich, absolutely flavorful.  The only modification, if you can call it that, is to use hot Italian sausage.  I usually throw in a pinch of red pepper as called for on top of that, but we like a little bite.  I make a huge stock pot and freeze multiple meals, it is just too easy and delicious not to...  Highly recommended!

Oh so thick and rich. It is a little sweet so if you don't like it sweet eliminate the sugar or cut it back.  I went to put the wine in but all I had left in the cabinet was a Plum wine.  I thought, heck, plums look like grapes on steroids so let me through that in.  Still good.  I made some meatballs with ground beef and hot italian sausage, browned up about ten in a frying pan then put them in the sauce to finish cooking.  The rest of the meatballs I put in the oven.

Me and my family loved this recipe, but I did make some of my own adjustments. I also decided to cook this in the crockpot all day. I sauted the onion and garlic in a fry pan and I also added about 2/3 cup of diced green, red and yellow peppers. Once those were softened I added a pound of ground bison and cooked that until done. I then placed everything in the crockpot and added the remainder of the ingredients. I used two cans of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil instead of the whole tomatoes and I also added a bit more red wine. I started the recipe late in the day, so I cooked it on high for about 3 1/2 hours and then mixed it up with whole wheat spaghetti noodles and added a bit of salt to taste. This was amazing, but even better on day two.

This is my "go to" spaghetti sauce recipe. My husband and I don't care much for spaghetti but our kids love it so I try to make it occasionally. This is a good recipe. It's the only one I use. I don't measure my ingredients but I haven't modified anything that goes in it. Thanks for sharing.

I will NEVER get away with using sauce from a jar again!   I cooked this for eight hours in the Crock Pot, and it was absolute perfection.  Thick, flavorful, and as one person put it...."you can tell this is homemade; in a good way!"  I doubled the recipe and it was the perfect amount to make Baked Ziti I from this site, which has been a family favorite for a while.  Using this sauce and some good imported Italian noodles made it a completely different dish.  I never thought I would make homemade spaghetti sauce; I can't wait to surprise the family with it at our big holiday dinner!

Good recipe, I only made some minor changes. I add a half cup chopped bell pepper to the garlic and onions, and I use stewed tomatoes instead of whole ( 2 cans ). I also use fresh basil instead of dried and a little extra sugar. Great stuff.

Firstly, I sauteed the garlic (twice what the recipe called for) and onion and deglazed the pan with red wine. Then I added the remaining ingredients. I ended up adding 4 vine tomatoes (seeds scraped out) as well as 2 bell peppers, roughly chopped. The spice level was just right for us, but we like it on the spicier side (I added a heaping 1/4 tsp). I also added about 1/2 cup of water, since it seemed a touch chunky. After 3 hours of simmering I pulsed three-quarters of it in my blender to smooth it out. It ended up with a consistency similar to a thicker jar sauce. This is an excellent base recipe that you can easily adapt to suit your tastes. It's super easy too!

This sauce was so good, I had to join this site so that I could rate it.  My family loved it.  I have never made sauce on my own before and this was the perfect one to start with.  Next time I'll have to double the recipe so that we'll have enough for leftovers.

I have made this several times.  It is incredibly good when simmered as directed.  I cook bulk sausage meat and throw it into the mix for the last hour; other than that, skipping the sugar, and making sure to use San Marzano tomatoes, I follow the recipe.  Wonderful.  My siblings and I have been trying to find a sauce to replace the one our mother used to make and we couldn't get enough of.  None of us can reproduce it anymore but this one will do nicely as the new "gold standard."  To paraphrase some famous London Underground graffiti from the '60s, "Connery is God." :-)  Thanks so much for sharing this!

Amazing authentic flavor...thick, sweet and spicy, great with or without meat. I usually add a tad more wine, garlic and red pepper flakes because we like a lot of flavor. You CANNOT MESS THIS UP...important for anyone nervous about making your own Sunday gravy. Just go for it...you can always tweak as you go.

This recipe garnered my first "sauce compliment" from my Italian husband.  He ALWAYS makes our sauce...20 years and running...and it's amazing but he won't tell me his recipe!  Not even his mom knows.  However, for once, I wanted to attempt a sauce that he would give his stamp of approval and this one did.  I used this along with the baked spaghetti recipe from this sight.  It's a very hearty recipe with just the right amount of spice.

I really liked this recipe but did make some changes. I peeled and chopped up my own home-grown tomatoes instead of using canned whole tomatoes. I substituted 1 can of tomato paste for 1 can tomato sauce to keep the sauce from getting too thick. I used half the recommended sugar and omitted the red pepper flakes. The sauce really does have to simmer for at least 3 hours or else it will taste too "herbal" and have a bitter after-taste. My last change was to add some salt & pepper, and finally, the sauce was perfect! I love the dark, thick texture, and the well-rounded flavor.

Yummy! I have never made such a delicious sauce. I didn't have the sausage, unfortunately, so I just threw in a bit of fennel, sage, paprika and cayenne to get the flavors that sausage would have added. It was amazing.

Pretty good...like other reviewers I found it a little bitter.  Next time I will cut back on the herbs a bit.  I added a bit of parmesan cheese, which was good!

Start out with a grocery prepared spaghetti sauce of your choice. 

In a separate microwave bowl put all your 'additions" in it onions fresh garlic powdered garlic crushed red pepper ground black pepper and microwave until it breaks down. Add it to the prepared sauce..

then put your cooked ground meat, prepared meat balls  from grocery and sausage if you like into the microwave dish and cook on high five minutes at a time stirring and returning to micro until its just yummy.... You'll be glad you did

I been using this recipe since I found it here. I adjust it with brown sugar instead of white, I use crush and puree tomatoes and of course I double it to freeze some.. I use 1 lb containers (I freeze containers first for about 10 + minutes as this keeps sauce from staining containers). Other than that I go by this basic recipe, been thinking of new ideas to add but haven't try yet. Been told many times its the best sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed.  We found the oregano flavor overpowering and thought the sauce was way too thick.  We ended up having to add extra tomato sauce and water to thin it down.  Will not make again.

I made this for tonight's dinner.   I made a couple of changes - I only had 6 oz of tomato paste & no wine, but I added a can of diced tomatoes.  We prefer meatballs to italian sausage, so we had those instead.  I let it simmer on low for a few hours & it was amazing!

I loved the smell while it was cooking and it also looked inviting. However, when I tasted it it was too sweet and it needed salt. I didn't add salt because the recipe didn't say anything about adding salt. I'm just learning how to cook and wouldn't know how much salt to add.

This is overwhelmingly good. I used this as a base and added more sugar, homemade onion soup mix, chicken broth instead of wine, lots more garlic and skipped the red pepper flakes.

Loved it.  I didn't have an onion, so I used celery.  Also used hamburger instead of sausage. Perfect for my taste, but I can't wait to try it with onion!

This is my absolute "go to" recipe for spaghetti sauce! I've made it so many times, sometimes using ground beef, sometimes sausage, sometimes just vegetables. It's always flavorful and so much better than any bottled sauce!

Very good sauce. I found that the amount of tomatoes was too much for my family. I used one 14.5 oz can per pound and that was too much. Next time will try with one can per 2 pounds

So I tried my hand at this recipe and absolutely loved it! My family ate EVERYTHING. I didn't know which red wine to use so I just used Stella Rosa and used fresh basil and oregano, and halved the dry basil/oregano. Also used sea salt and a tad bit of peppercorn.  I also used fire roasted tomatoes instead of peeled tomatoes and 1 (6oz) can of tomato sauce. 

For the meat, I used 96/4 ground beef and sauted it soy sauce, granulated garlic and onion, sea salt and pepper.

Turned out prefect once you mix both!

Thank you!

This is pretty good... I think it needs a bit of adjusting but the base is good enough t make it into whatever you want it to be.  I tend to like a lot of different kinds of red sauces.  This is nice for when I want something more hearty.

This sauce was AMAZING!! I didn't have red wine but I did have cooking sherry so I used that instead. I didn't have oregano and I used two jars of spagetti sauce instead of all the canned tomato stuff. I'm convinced it's the spices and wine that make this recipe amazing. Everyone should try it because you do not have to make this to the "T" and you can adjust to what you already have. I doubled the batch and froze half of the sauce for another meal. TRY IT!

This was pretty darn good for my first try at making homemade spaghetti sauce.  I did follow advice of others and didn't put in the whole amount of sugar as some thought it was too sweet.  I also accidentally doubled the wine, which didn't seem to make a big difference.  I thought it could use a little salt.  I still think Classico sauce is better, but since we don't have that here in Germany, I think I will stick with this recipe for awhile!

This recipe was great. The ONLY reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I felt that the herbs were a little overpowering. The second time I made it I cut the herbs in half (especially the oregano) and WHOA. So good. The first time was great too , just a little herby for my taste. I cant believe that home cooked sauce could be so easy and sooooo good. I will NEVER buy jar sauce again.

It was a nice basic sauce but much too sweet for our tastes.  I did add ground beef at the beginning with th onions but otherwise followed the recipe pretty much exactly.  I might try it again with a tsp sugar instead of a TBSP.

Very good!  I had to add a bit more sugar (I think my tomatoes were more tart than usual). Overall a great recipe--uses ingredients on hand and doesn't require mincing a bunch of fresh herbs :)  Thanks!

First time I ever made spaghetti sauce.  The kids loved it. I added lean ground beef and mushroom slices. Wish I would have had more time to slow cook it.  Great recipe!!!

I omitted the pepper flakes and sugar, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Delicious!  My husband and 8-yr-old son loved it.  Added bonus: it makes the house smell spectacular.  Will never buy jarred spaghetti sauce again!

I have been searching for an outstanding spaghetti sauce for 20 odd years and this is IT!  Absolutely delicious.  I made it in my crockpot with the following changes: omitted the red pepper flakes, used just one  six ounce can of tomato paste and browned the Italian sausage.  Cooked on high for 5 hours.  So good!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I used tomatoes from my garden instead of canned and only 1 can of paste.  I did not have meat on hand, but I added diced zucchini because my garden is overflowing.  I only had time to simmer it for a little over an hour, but it turned out really good.  I think the red wine is what really gives it the restaurant style flavor.  The red pepper flakes gave it a great kick!

I did alter and used 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of tomato sauce, and 1 can of tomato paste. Also decreased the basil to 1 T. Tasty and hearty. Served with "Basic Pasta" spaghetti.

A friend and I made this for our families today using chicken italian sweet sausage and everyone loved it.  I didn't use the red pepper flakes or wine, and I cut back the basil to 1 tablespoon.  Also, I had tomato puree and tomato sauce, which is what I always use to make marinara sauce, so I used those instead of paste and tomatoes.  It was yummy, and we'll definitely make it again.

I didn't have the red wine, so this may not be the most fair rating. Still turned out good, but a tad bit on the spicy side with the red pepper flakes in it.

Awesome recipie. Thanks for sharing. I made this a couple of times and each time was as good as the last. The only thing I did different was, due to not having oregano on hand, I used a seasoning for the grill called Itallian Herb and it worked very well. The other day I made 4X the recipie and used the sauce for lasagna. My family said it was the best I ever made.

This sauce is excellent.  I will use diced tomatoes next time and 1/2 the sugar.  I found it to be thick while cooking, even with the lid on so I added tiny amounts of water here & there.  I added the sausage which flavored the sauce more.  I agree with other reviewers, why buy jar sauce when making this is so easy.  With only the two of us, we had enough for at least 4 meals.

Awsome recipe! I didn't have italian sausage and white vineger so used balsamic vineger instead 2gether with breakfast sausage and it still came out good, but the balsamic overpowered all the flavors, so i suggest staying with the white vineger

Needed a hearty meal using ingredients I had on hand. Used crushed tomatoes instead of whole, tomate sauce instead of tomatoe paste. It came out very thick and hearty, exactly what I was hoping for. I prefer a thicker sauce. Will make a triple batch next time! Delish!

Excellent!  Freezes so well - I made 10 times the recipe w/ fresh tomatoes from my garden and I'm using my last batch this week.  I'm sad it's gone!  I followed the directions to the letter, but do not add meat - I add that occasionally, but the sauce is great with or without it.

My husband has been waiting for sixteen years for this. What do I mean? I've been waiting...LOL.; [I didn't open a jar of sauce and put a can of diced tomatoes in it].I doubled the recipe with the sauce, still kept a pound of Italian sausage. Everything else was the recipe. I had Lambrusco for my red wine.

This was very good.  I think the red wine adds a dimension not normally used.  It helps a lot!  Everyone loved it.  I also used hamburger and threw in some meatballs (hubby like lots of meat).  This was also very simple and fast.

This was wonderful!!  I did increase the recipe to 12 servings and lowered the seasoning amounts a little.  It just seemed like it would be too much seasoning.  I had on hand 1-14 oz can of peeled tomatoes, 2-14 oz cans of diced tomatoes, and 1-28 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  I also added some frozen bell peppers (red & green) to the garlic and onion and I used beef instead of sausage.  I cooked the sauce on low in the slow cooker for about 3½ hours then added the ground beef and cooked for another 2 hours.   It was wonderful.  I have never made homemade sauce before, but after this I don't think I will use jarred sauce again.

I didnt have red pepper flakes so i used tabasco. Added mushrooms and steak pieces which were nice. I used white wine instead of red and had to add an extra tablespoon of sugar. A good recipe. Will make it again.

This was SO good! I did change a few things though. I only used 1 can paste and added 1 can tomao sauce, and used 3 tablespoons of sugar. It was too bitter without. I also added chopped celery and bellpepper. I fried them in the oil and paste, then added all ingredienst to the crockpot and cooked on low about 5-6 hours. I added browned meatballs to the crockpot in the last hour.

My husband and I did not like the taste of this sauce.  The word we both used after trying it was "bitter".  I loved the consistency of it, though.  Nice and thick!  I will try another recipe next time.

This was good.I slow cooked it in a crock pot for about 4-5 hours. I didn't have the sausage on hand, so I baked some homemade meatballs. I threw them in the sauce the last 2 hours. I also used fresh herbs from my garden instead of dried.

This turned out so very thick and so very delicious.  I doubled the recipe, used the slow-cooker and froze several containers.  Next time, I'll make the sauce without meat and add sausage or meatballs when I serve it.  Sooo much better than store-bought and the house smelled wonderful.

I'm not a fan of spaghetti sauce, but this was really good! The red wine really made the flavor stand out. I added ground turkey because I don't eat pork but the sauce was better w/out it! I will be making this again. Even my eleven year old picky eater liked this one.

This spaghetti sauce recipe is incredible!  Simple ingredients combine for a rich, flavorful result. I have made this recipe 2x in 1 week and the last time I doubled it so I could put half of it in the freezer.  Don't let the simplicity of it full you.  We had a favorite sauce made in our area that I always purchased...no need to anymore.  This is my family's new favorite!

this is a good basic recipe; thick and rich-however in the future I will eliminate the sugar, and instead add a little salt to balance out the flavors.

I have made this recipe several times and it's always a hit with my family and guests.  I have started adding about half again as much wine and pepper flakes as the recipe calls for as we like a slightly stronger flavor.

I just made this for the first time and I would definitely make it again.  It's inexpensive to make, but it has a complexity and depth to it that makes you think it was prepared by a seasoned Italian chef.

I used a Cabernet Sauvignon, which may have been a little too bold for this recipe.  Next time I will use a lighter red wine such as a pinot noir.  I did add some splashes of water a few times to thin it out a bit.

Overall, this is a fantastic sauce and I will certainly share this recipe with others.

I thought that the recipe was good, but a little bland.  It needed something to give it a little more zip.  Otherwise pretty good.  I did add in a can of stewed tomatos to the mix since I like thick sauces.

Update: The second day I had left overs and the sauce was fantastic!  In the future I might make this a day ahead and let it permeate overnight.  It really helped with the flavors.

OK, I haven't even eaten this on pasta yet but I tasted it, and it it AWESOME.  The ONLY changes I made were: I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoea (what I had) and 2 cans tomato sauce, and I scaled back on the red pepper flakes only because of my 6 yr old.  This is excellent and I will make this from now on!!!!  Thanks!

I had all recipes multiply this recipe to make enough for 15 and added another can of whole peeled tomatoes and another 1/2 cup red wine and 1 cup of water and as usual nearly doubled the garlic, then added some herbs from my garden and went back in time to mom's kitchen.

It was very good, however, very thick.  It needs more liquid such as water or wine(or less paste, perhaps).  Overall though it was well liked

I lost my favorite spaghetti sauce recipe and am glad I found this one as it's even better!  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and HOT Italian turkey sausage.  Cut up the sausages and simmered them in a pan w/ the drippings & a bit of left over Pinot Noir-absolutely mouth watering.  I also added a bit of water as needed along the way. Made a double batch, for dinner tonight and some to freeze for later.  This recipe is a keeper!

This sauce was great.   All the great reviews helped me choose the perfect sauce I was looking for.  I also cooked it in a crook pot for about four hours.  It was so tasty, and it's now my new favorite red sauce.

Fantastic sauce!  I used diced tomatoes instead of whole and sauce instead of paste.  I also used my slow cooker and added frozen meatballs about halfway through.  Will definitely make again!

Tastes great. I needed to keep adding water though because it was a little thick. Trying it again with a 2005 Rosemount Chiraz and sweet italian sausage. Trip report later.

Great recipe, this recipes has many uses, sauce works well when making pizza, and I always make more than I need. I use the Italian sausage link and use the left over sauce and sausage to make Italian Sausage sandwiches.

the seasoning is very good although it needed salt.  I found it to be way too thick and I like a thicker sauce.  I agree with other reviewers that this would be a great homemade pizza sauce.
