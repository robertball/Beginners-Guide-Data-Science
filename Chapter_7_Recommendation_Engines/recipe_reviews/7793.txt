I have made this recipe twice now. Both times it was very good. However the second time I used a cake mix that called for three eggs so I added a forth as the recipe said. (add an extra egg!) Don't do that. Three eggs is enough the forth makes it just too heavy. It was still good but comparing it to the first cake it was not as good. For best results use the strawberry cream cheese, there is something about it that just makes a difference. I used the regular cream cheese the second time and just added a tablespoon of strawberry preserves and it tasted very good but was not as good as when I used the strawberry cream cheese. As for the icing I did the icing that was suggested the first time and it was good but all the things the other reviewers said I found to be true. Just realize that it will be a little difficult to work with. The second cake I used the icing recipe that I found on here several years ago and it has been my stand by since. 1 cup of whipping cream whipped with 1 box of instant pudding(I use cream cheese flavor) and then fold it into a 8 oz tub of cool whip. It is nice and stiff and tastes great. It compliments this cake well.

This cake is my husbands new favorite cake!  I've made it several times already. Several reviewers mentioned that the strawberry flavor was not strong enough. I've found that this is easily remedied by using strawberry cream cheese in the cake and making it a day in advance and storing in the fridge. The flavor is much stronger (and tastier) the next day.  Also an easy way to make sure you have no clumps in your frosting; let the cream cheese come to room temperature, dice up into cubes and put in a blender, finely chop the white chocolate and once the cream is warmed melt the chocolate in it then pour the warm chocolate/cream mixture over cream cheese, cover and blend until smooth. I've made the frosting with both cool whip and fresh whipping cream it is much better with heavy whipping cream. This is my go to recipe whenever we have company for dinner.***update*** I just made this with raspberries instead of strawberries and it was AMAZING! I just used raspberry cream cheese and sweetened pureed raspberries that i put through a siv(sp?) to get out all the seeds.*** The possibilities are endless, made it again with pineapple cream cheese and pureed canned pineapple and hubby loved it! Maybe even more than the strawberry***

Everybody loved this.  I made it in a 13X9 sheet pan for easy transport.  I also used strawberry cream cheese in the cake, and unsweetened strawberries (measured before I pureed them) with 2.5 T sugar added.  Everything mixed up fine in my mixer after a few minutes.  The cake baked in about 32 minutes, and was moist but not soggy.  The frosting was also delicious- make sure the cream cheese is at room temp. and the whipped topping is thawed for it to mix well.  If assembling a layer cake, the frosting would definitely need to be refrigerated in order to hold, as well as after the cake is made or it will fall apart.  Otherwise, this was easy and just delicious!

This is a great cake but lousy instructions. The reason everyone is having such a difficult time with frosting is the whipping cream should be chilled after you melt the chocolate in it. Then when cold, it should be beaten until stiff peaks form. Then beat in the cream cheese. Stir in the cool whip last.I only used half of a 8 oz tub. Was plenty of frosting.
The second problem withe recipe was mixing the cake. The order is all wrong! Beat the cream cheese first until smooth, then add eggs one at a time (do not add but 3 eggs)Then add the cake mix. Batter will be thick.
The third problem is bake time. It is more like 30-35 minutes. That is why some are having problems with it being wet and soggy. Other than poor directions this cake is awesome! Done right, that frosting is great!

Everyone loved this cake!  One tip for the frosting, though...it didn't get thick enough to use even after cooling, so I beat it with an electric mixer for a couple of minutes.  The heavy cream helped it get firm, but still light and creamy, after mixing.

This cake is fantastic, have made it 5 times. It's one of the few never-fail recipes! Didnt' have store-bought cake mix, so I used the Cake Mix from Scratch recipe from this site. Strawberry taste isn't strong enough for my liking, rectified somewhat using extra 1 tbs strawberry extract. Tastes MUCH better when cold, like a light cheesecake. Potential candidate for the small cake business I'm setting up!
Also, bake in the lower HALF, not the lower THIRD, of the oven, to prevent the top cracking.

Hands down one of the best cakes I have ever made. At first I thought I did something wrong because the batter was very thick and dense, and I thought it wouldnt rise well. But it ended up great and only lasted a few hours. The BEST strawberry cake. If you're having trouble deciding on a recipe definately try this one first! It is a very moist, creamy cake. The only thing I changed was the frosting because I wanted something simple. I used the frosting from the Strawberry Cream Cake recipe. It is very light and not too sweet. Perfect for this cake.

Made this cake today for my daughters birthday.  Wow!!!   I did it in a bundt pan (baked for 55 min)split it in half, put some of the frosting and sliced strawberries in the middle then frosted.  I covered some strawberries in milk chocolate and drizzled the rest over the white frosting --- very impressive.  This is sure a keeper!

I made this cake for a little girl's birthday party. The cake part is EXCELLENT; I used a white cake mix and used egg whites instead of the extra egg. Nice, dense, moist, rich cake; I'd definitely make it again. I layered it with the frosting and a homemade strawberry-almond filling. The frosting was pretty good. I found that if I stored the cake in the fridge, the frosting got very grainy. If the frosting was room-temp, it was perfectly smooth and creamy. So as long as you don't chill the frosting, this is a wonderfully delicious cake.

I made this cake for my husband for his birthday and it was GREAT! Doesn't taste AT ALL like it came from a cake mix. I used Splenda sweetened strawberries and they worked great. Also used 1/3 less fat in the cake and I don't think the cake suffered at all. I baked in a 13x9" pan - which I'm glad because the cake is so moist and the icing was abit thin. I poked holes the cake before frosting so teh icing could run down in it. HMmmm. Will keep this one for more summer strawberries!

I'm not even much of a fan of fruit in my cake, but I made this for a bridal shower, and it was absolutely delicious. The texture and flavor make it hard to believe that it isn't from a bakery. I had a little problem getting the layers out of the pan cleanly, so next time I will definitely use parchment paper or wax paper. I also chilled the frosting overnight before putting it on the cake and had no problem with it not being thick enough. It was just a fantastic combination of white chocolate and strawberries!

I made this cake for my moms birthday because she LOVES strawberries. I read all the reviews and decided to make this cake using a Golden Vanilla cake mix, leaving out the oil, only using 3 eggs, used strawberry cream cheese, and of course the pureed strawberries. The cake turned out PERFECT! I baked it for about 28 minutes, and my toothpick test actually came out clean. It was dense like a homemade cake is supposed to be. But not overly so. I also waited till the cake was cool covered them and put them in the fridge overnight. This cake needs to be kept cold. For the frosting I made it according to the directions except I used strawberry cream cheese. I didnt have any problems with my white chocolate and cream cheese melting, I whipped it all together using my Kitchenaid mixer. But even after waiting for it to cool then adding the Cool Whip and letting it sit in the coldest part of my refrigerator overnight it was very liquidy. So I put it in my deep freezer until the edges started to freeze, whipped it at the highest speed on my KitchenAid, and added 2 heaping tablespoons of confectioners sugar. It was absolutely PERFECT! The best frosting I have ever had. My cake got rave reviews, both my mom and my aunt said it was the best cake they had ever had in their whole lives. I put a thin layer of frosting and strawberries in between the layers, and garnished the cake with sliced strawberries and chocolate covered strawberries. Thanks for a great recipe!

So I didn't have all the problems other people were having with the cake being soggy in the middle I tried this as a cupcake recipe. They didn't really have a strong strawberry flavor, I even used strawberry cream cheese as suggested by other reviewers. The recipe itself was pretty simple so I'll probably stick with this one only modify it a bit, since this was only the test run. Next time I'll add a couple teaspoons of strawberry extract. Also because of the bad reviews I didn't even try the icing. Instead I used the one suggested by Grandma Lizzy. 1 cup whipping cream mixed with 1 box instant pudding (she suggested cream cheese flavor but I used white chocolate) then fold into 8 oz. cool whip. It was exactly what I was looking for, light like whipped cream yet stiff enough to use as cupcake incing.

I've made this cake about 10 times now.  It is probably one of my favorite cakes ever. Every time I make it, people freak out over how delicious and perfect it is.  It does take some work, and it's a bit expensive, but it's worth it. You must keep it refrigerated, for taste and structural integrity.

But, I make the cake with chocolate cake mix instead of white cake mix.  I've made it both ways, but chocolate cake mix is MuchMuch better.

I've seen a lot of complaints about the frosting.  I've had trouble with it too, but it's one of the best parts about the cake, so don't skip it!  What I've done if it is too thin, is chill it for a while, or add more cream cheese, and then whip it up nice and thick with a mixer.  Delicious.

9This cake was wonderful. Some reviews said the cake was to sweet, but I don't think they are cake eaters. Some reviews said that the cake was not fluffy enough, but I think they did not beat the eggs enough. I did make a few changes. I used strawberry cream cheese as suggested by other reviewers, i also beat the eggs seperatly until they were fluffy before adding them to the cake mix. Strawberries were not in season when I made the cake, so I sliced and sweetend them. I used two quarts of strawberries instead of one and put strawberries between the cake layers. Also some reviewers complianed that the frosting was hard to work with, so I made the frosting first and put it in the fridge while I prepared the rest of the cake. I let kept the cake in the fridge overnight, until it was time to serve. The next time I make the cake, I will make it the same way I made it this time.

Very tasty. I would, however, not try to stack the layers (the icing is very slipperty). Next time I make this, I will put in a dish with sides so I can spoon it out rather than trying to layer and cut it. I might add a few more strawberry's, too.

This is an excellent cake...I have made it twice and both times it was excellent!  Everyone that tasted it loved it and asked for the recipe!  I have read some of the complaints about the icing and all I can say is they must have not taken the time to do it properly!  I did not get it right the first time because I did not let the mixture cool completely before adding the cool whip!  If you let it cool completely before folding in the cool whip it will come out perfectly! This is by far my favorite cake(I am usually a chocolate lover!) and everyone that has eaten it has fallen in love with it!  I also garnish it with white chocolate covered strawberries!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!!!

SOOOOOOOOOO FAB!  I followed the recipe- used strawberry cream cheese like other suggested.  I made them into cupcakes (24) and used this icing recipe to frost them- to 'firm up' the frosting so it wouldn't drip off- I threw in 1 box of instant pudding- cheesecake flavor- viola!  Perfect consistency!  These were a MAJOR hit at the bday party we took 'em to!

I've made this several times for parties and work events.  Very moist!  So much better than typical strawberry cake mixes due to the real frozen strawberries.  One recommendation: don't overblend the strawberries, be sure to leave it just a bit chunky!

I made this for Easter, and it was a big hit. I made the recipe as is, and it turned out beautifully. I did melt the white chocolate with the cream the night before and put it in the fridge until I was almost ready to serve. Then I mixed it with the whipped topping and put the cake together. I'll definitely make this again.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I made this cake with "Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting" instead of the frosting recipe it comes with, since it was for my little one's first birthday cake.  The cake was FANTASTIC, it reminds me of real strawberry ice cream.  Every guest at my party had two pieces, and I got rave reviews!

This cake is Awesome, I've made 2...but you can't follow the recipe exactly. Anyone with any cooking common sense will know that the frosting is WAY to runny...I chill it for at least 30 min before putting it on the cake. I also chilled the frosted cake overnight and then added the berries the next day. I also used strawberry cream cheese. Very dense, Very delicious (I recommend chill cake overnight before serving) Will definitley make again!! Pics on my profile.

I am in loooove with this cake so was everyone else !!!! it was delicious and moist and perfect !!!!!
I also used strawberry cream cheese and TAKE TIME with your icing I did and it came out excellent I think the key with the icing was after whipping it put it back in the freezer to stiffen it before icing your cake. Also as others suggest i used red food coloring and it was a niceer color :) so happy I found this I will be making it for many occasions it is nice and light.

I was so excited to make this, but the final result wasn't what I was hoping for. It didn't wow me AT ALL. The frosting was thin and didn't hold up well, even after chilling the whipping cream / chocolate and whipping afterwards. I baked for 30 min. and didn't have trouble with it not setting. This cake wasn't worth the effort it took to make in my opinion. Update!! I reviewed with 2 stars, but am going to up it to 4 because seriously, I couldn't quit eating this cake. It really was pretty good! I would put more strawberries on the top next time, as the bites with stawberries were my favorite! I might make this again, but try a different frosting.

I turned these into cupcakes which turned out really good.  I did 4 oz cream cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I also added a bit of red food colouring for a darker colour cupcake.  And piped some strawberry glaze into the centers, dusting with icing sugar in an attempt to recreate a treat from a local eatery.  Very happy with the results!

I'm not sure how this recipe got so many stars and tastes like this?  It's actually a little bitter, despite having a cake mix and sweetened berries in it, and the color, although a pretty pink as a batter, bakes up to an almost gray.  I was so disappointed!  I'm an avid baker and have a cupcake business on the side and want a great strawberry cake recipe..... this was not it. Pout.

This was a very tasty dessert, however, I managed to screw it up!  I need to learn to be patient!  When doing the frosting, I figured that the cream mixture was cooled enough, it was only slightly warm, so I mixed in the cool whip!  Bad idea.  Wait until it is COMPLETELY cooled before adding the cool whip.  My frosting was more like a thick soup than a nice light topping!  The taste was great, appearance....not so nice!  Regardless, I had no leftovers!

This cake is GREAT!!!  My father can't get enough of it.  He said it was one of the best cakes he had ever had.  It's very moist which I like a lot. I added strawberry jello to the cake mix to give it a really pretty pink color.  It is a very attrative cake, great for company. I also added the strawberry cream cheese to the cake part and regular cream cheese to the frosting part.  Speaking of the frosting part.  That was the only thing that was a little difficult for me.  I had a hard time with it and like some of the others added pudding mix to it in order to get a more firm consistancy.  Overall, it turned out a strong 5 star, but something is off with the frosting part.

I was apprehensive about making this after reading all the reviews, but I thought it looked tasty so i went ahead and made it. Unfortunately, I should have listened to my instinct and chosen another recipe.I thought this was a boring cake that was time consuming and expensive without great end results. The frosting was weird also, it tasted kinda funky and really strong so I only mixed about half of it with the whipped topping...Still kinda of a strange flavor.I wasn't a big fan. The cake comes out kind of grayish pink, which really isn't appetizing, and does not have a strong strawberry flavor. Basically this cake is certainly edible, but not worth the bother. In fact, the best part of the cake was the fresh strawberries I put on top.

Yes, it was dense; yes, the icing was drippy if it wasn't refrigerated; but the fact remains that this cake is dense and delicious.  If you're aware of the above two issues going in, and you're not expecting a light and airy layer cake, then you're in for a treat.  One of my kids likened it to a muffin texture--and it was wonderful.  I followed the recipe using the suggestion of strawberry cream cheese, and I also used only egg white, as opposed to the whole eggs.  I made the icing the day before and kept it in the fridge over night, frosted the cake the next day and then kept it in the refrigerator.  It was lovely--lots of rave reviews.  Thanks for the post.

Fantastic. I refrigerated the frosting after mixing, which firmed it up and allowed me to pipe decorations on the cake.

This cake was very moist and dense. However, the strawberry flavor was very subtle. My son guessed that it was banana at first. Also, it is a strange color. The frosting was good and fluffy, I would make the frosting again, but probably not the cake.

OMG, I am sitting here eatting the top crusties with some coffee & I am in heaven!!!  I am not planning on frosting the cake with the white chocolate since I am covering it with fondant, but I can just imagine how heavenly it would taste with the white chocolate icing.  Also, I didn't have sweetened frozen strawberries, mine were unsweetened, soooo, I thawed them in the microwave a little, put 3 tablespoons of sugar over them, let them sit a few minutes & pureed them in the blender with 2.5 tablespoons of white wine.  This is to die for!  I can't believe how absolutely yummy it is.  I can't wait to take it to my sisters birthday tomorrow.

I didn't care for this cake, nor did my family.  It was very hard to get the lumps out of the frosting.  I would agree that whipping the cream cheese first might help.  The frosting had a good flavor, but it was very rich and heavy.  The cake itself was not super flavorful.  Also, it had an unappealing color.  Maybe adding red food coloring might help.  I will not be making this cake again.

This is possibly the worst cake I've ever made/tasted.  I am giving it a 2-star because the frosting turned out nicely.  The cake itself was bland, despite the fact that I tasted the batter and it tasted fine.  The texture was a cross between cake and cheesecake but reminded me of a dense bread pudding.  Perhaps I was looking for a more cake-like texture...  but it just didn't taste good.  I would recommend mixing the cream cheese until almost whipped before adding it to the chocolate and hot heavy cream for a smoother consistantcy.  (Strangely, I mixed the cream cheese for the cake but not the frosting.  Could this be the reason that the cake turned out the way it did???) I brought this to a small dinner party and nobody raved about it, although somebody did like it because it wasn't too sweet.  I will not be making this again.

I made this recipe for my bf's birthday and it was good.  It was very nice.  I'm more of a chocolate person.  You won't have any problems with the icing, if you let the mixture cool before adding the cool whip.  I made the white chocolate/cream/cream cheese mixture the night before, and let it stand at room temperature while making the cake.  I used real whipped cream for the icing.  It was a nice cake!

Thankyou Beth. This cake, while incredibly rich, is out of this world!!! I have made it for several bake sales and potlucks and each time veryone can't believe its not from a bakery. I use fresh whipped cream, the fakeness of cool whip has always been a turn up. But everything is perfect about the recipe. Hut make sure to let EVERYTHING cool before adding the cool whip to the frsodtin :) This one is a winner!!

Maybe I did something wrong???? Yes, the cake was good, nice and moist. But both layers fell in the middle when I took it out of the oven. Also, my icing didn't work right. Talk about an ugly cake!:-) I doubt I'll make it again.

Excellent. Definitely use the strawberry cream cheese instead of plain. And I opted for the lighter frosting that consisted of heavy whipping cream, Cool Whip and cream cheese pudding. I keep getting requests to make more.

This cake was no dream.  A bit more like a nightmare, at least as far as prep is concerned.  It looked deceptively simple, just white cake mix, frozen strawberries and cream cheese and with a really high rating from a lot of people.

After reading all of the reviews I made a ton of changes and I hope it works out but if it doesn’t that is o.k. as I have another cake recipe lined up just in case.  Here are the changes I made.  I added 1/8 teaspoon red food dye to make sure it was nice and pink.  I also added 1 tsp strawberry extract to make sure it tasted really strawberry-y.  I did not add an extra egg (in this case egg white).  I also used strawberry cream cheese instead of regular.

So I basically put all the wet ingredients in the blender, I can’t quite be sure how much frozen strawberries I had, (I used my own in the freezer) because it wouldn’t blend for me to measure it but I would guestimate about 1 1/2 cups, to these I added 2 TBS sugar.  I also put in 1/3 cup water.  Then the oil, the egg whites then the cream cheese and extract.  Then I just followed the box directions and basically mixed the dry and the wet with a hand mixer and added the food coloring at that time.
Everything turned out good.  It wasn’t the best cake in the world but it was pink and it definitely had a good strawberry flavor.  The texture was good, kind of spongy and moist but not so moist as I like it but not dry either.

I am a novice in the kitchen. Step 2 confused me but after the third time I figured out instead of using water use the strawberries. It was an easy cake to make.  unfortunately I forgot the cool whip so I had to make the whip topping from heavy cream etc. I used strawberry cream cheese in both the cake and the topping as someone else suggested and added in 4 oz of vanilla pudding.  my white cake mix called for just egg whites, but I used the whole egg. I personally don't eat cake. This was made for a family gathering Everyone loved it! someone commented "oh this is so good . This is a homemade cake" Yeah betty crocker and I made it right at home. I will make this again I doubled the recipe but next time will only use 2  8x8 pans instead of 3 and don't double. cake was tall. couldn't fit the slices on the plate

I made this yummy tasting cake for my husband on our 1 year wedding anniversary and he loved it!! It took a little longer to bake in the oven than described in the recipe but it turned out very moist! I melted the white chocolate before I mixed in the cool whip and put it in the freezer to let it thicken before frosting the cake.  Great cake and it has a wonderful flavor!

This was tasty, but very dense.  It may be my fault, because I didn't add the extra egg, as I thought the 3 called for would suffice.  My crazy husband wanted chocolat frosting, so it would probably be better balanced with a lighter, whipped cream type frosting.

WOW this cake is so delicious!  I only used half the cream cheese & it didn't turn out too moist like other reviewers have said.  Also, used un-sweetened frozen strawberries & only added 2 tsps. of powdered sugar to those strawberries.  The frosting is delicious but does not stay well.  I don't recommend this frosting for a 2 layer cake but would be great if you're doing a sheet style.  It sort of "deflated" in the fridge and the 2 layers of my cake slipped apart.  I am trying this again today with a different frosting.

OH SO GOOD!  The only problem I had was with the frosting being a soupy mess at first and I thought I had ruined the cake!  I put it in the fridge and let it sit for a few hours and it was PERFECT!  I always use Dream Whip instead of Cool Whip because it is cheaper and super good, but I don't think that should have made a big difference.  Next time, I will cool my frosting for a few hours before I frost the cake.  SUPER GOOD!

Fabulous, will definitely make it again and again. The only thing that was hard was to figure out how long to bake it (I made it in a specialty pan). The tooth pick wont come out clean. And if it does come out clean, its overbaked and dry.

This cake was absolutely amazing -- I generally avoid cake mix recipes because I find they taste too much like chemicals, but that certainly doesn't apply to this one. I used the Duncan Hines super moist white cake mix, used only three egg whites, 2 tbsp of oil and used low-fat Philly strawberry cream cheese. I took it out of the oven at 25 minutes and it was cooked perfectly. After cooling it, I frosted it with another white chocolate frosting from this site, but to up the strawberry flavour a bit, I put a thick layer of strawberry jam between the two layers of cake and topped it with a layer of the frosting before putting the top cake layer on. I then refrigerated it for a night before serving it, and the end result was a super moist, dense, but still cake-like cake. It was absolutely amazing, fresh tasting,  strawberry-tastic and delicious! It won rave reviews from everyone at dinner. In fact, my mother in law, who never has more than one small slice of cake, asked for seconds. Thanks for an incredible recipe, Beth! This one will go into my permanent file!

A ton of work for a mediocre dessert.  Frosting was very runny.  I have to admit the cake was very moist and "pudding-like" as advertised, but did not wow me by any means.

I made this for my families Mother's Day picnic and was very leary after reading the neg reviews but, already had bought all the ingredients. I was pleasantly surprized. I would definetly recommend this cake to be refrigerated the night before as well as the frosting then frost it the next day. If you do this the frosting will not be runny and will stay on the cake. It thickened up the next day. My cake was a nice pink color in the inside was very moist and had a nice balance with the cream cheese, white choc and whipped cream. Everyone loved it and said it looked nice.

I made some changes, so I'm giving this 5 *s based on the finished product. I used a French vanilla cake mix, added an extra egg white, and left out the oil (that part was accidental). I added a couple of drops of red food coloring to the batter to counteract the grayness. I was worried about the cream cheese lumps in the batter, but they didn't affect the texture of the cupcake. (Next time I will blend the cream cheese first with the eggs and some of the strawberry puree.) The recipe made exactly 72 mini cupcakes (baked for 17 minutes). The texture was fluffy and light, and there was plenty of strawberry flavor. Maybe those who didn't get the flavor drained the strawberries? The recipe didn't specify, so I pureed them with the syrup. I topped them with a vanilla buttercream and slice of strawberry. They tasted like little strawberry shortcakes, but better. Everyone loved them!

VERY YUMMY!  Made for a birthday girl who LOVES strawberries, I used strawberry cream cheese instead of original and cooled the frosting before frosting the cake and put it back in the fridge to let set and presto BEST STRAWBERRY CAKE EVER!!  Thanks a ton!

Great summer cake.  Delicious.  Made exactly as written except I used a 9x13 pan.  Needs to be refrigerated to keep frosting set. I made this for a co-workers birthday and everyone raved! I even received compliments from her husband who was lucky enough to get leftovers. Thanks for the recipe!

So easy to make, but a little time consuming, however, definitely worth it!  I thought this cake was delicious and extremely moist.  I used the suggestion from another reviewer and used strawberry cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese, which I think rounded out the strawberry flavor.  I was a little leery about the doneness of the cake, since the cake wasn't completely firm and the toothpick wasn't clean-but as someone previously mentioned, that is the way it is suppose to be.  The frosting was easy and instead of cream cheese I used mascarpone cheese, it tasted delicious!  I received great reviews!

I made the cake version of this for my daughter's birthday.  The cake was a hit.  I did use a different frosting as I was making a "hello kitty" cake.  The only change I made was to use a strawberry cake mix to start with.

I made this cake for my 7 year old's birthday. He was impressed by the photo. I duplicated the look of the white fluffy cake with the fresh strawberries on top and he loved it. However, I found the cake much too time consuming for the flavor. I could still tell it was from a mix (I hate mixes) but others could not, so take that for what it's worth. I thought the white chocolate frosting was pretty good, but in comparison to the cost and prep time of the old famous cool whip and vanilla instant pudding recipe, I do not think this one was worth it. Next time I will use the other possibly substituting the cream for milk and whipping it as I did here to get a nice stiff, but still fluffy frosting. I did not think there was too much frosting, by the way. I made my own fresh strawberry filling with cornstarch and filled between the layers that way. One person commented they felt that part was "essential" to the flavor of the cake. It was good, but comments about the color make me wish I had remembered the red food coloring mentioned by another poster. Also, it is SOO fattening! Holy Moly! I think there would be a lot of ways to get similar flavor without all that cream cheese, chocolate and eggs! Overall, I think my son liked it because of the whipped cream and fresh berries. It was a good cake and most everyone was pretty impressed so I gave it 3 stars.

This recipe was wonderful, a keeper in my collection. I made it in a heart shaped spring form pan for valentines day. Decorated the top with halfed strawberries and drizzled white chocolate over the top. Then, as a final touch, I added white chocolate shavings. It was so pretty, I didn't want to cut into it, but it was even better once I did. Cake was moist, perfect!

This cake was pretty good. I had none of the problems some other reviewers mentioned. The cake was indeed very moist. I kept it in the oven 25 minutes and it was perfect. To speed up the cooling process I put it in the freezer before frosting. When making the frosting I waited for the white chocolate mixture to completely cool before adding the whipped topping. The consistency was perfect and I was able to ice the cake all around just fine. The flavors of both the cake and the frosting were very good, and they were a good combination. I didn't enjoy it that much, but I'm not a huge strawberry fan. I did like that it was very different tasting, in a good way. But even my boyfriend who does not like sweets (to my chagrin) enjoyed this cake. I recommend it! Make sure you store it in the refrigerator. I served it 4 hours after making it, never putting it in the refrigerator, and the middle layer of frosting squeezed out a bit from the pressure of the knife cutting into the cake.

This cake was very good!  I used this recipe for a tiered cake and layered fresh strawberries into every layer.  I decorated this cake with buttercream icing but used the recipe included with this posting as filling.  It is a very light icing and not suitable for 'decorating'.  The icing is very good though.

Yummy, Yummy good!!  I would suggest whipping the cream cheese before making frosting too.  If you just keep whisking the cream cheese, milk, chocolate mixture it eventually gets smooth.  Then let it cool ALL THE WAY before adding cool whip.  Great with fresh strawberries, too.  I used fresh instead of frozen.  A+  KIDS LOVE IT

Presentation was wonderful. I had no problems with the frosting as others did, however my guests and I did not care for the pudding-like consistency of the cake. I would have much preferred to cook it longer for the cake to set better. Agreeing with another reviewer, this cake is much better cold.

I wanted to make a cake for Thanksgiving and chose this cake.  Pressed for time I rushed in making it and left out the oil that the cake mix called for.  Fortunately, I didn't need it!  The cake was perfect without it.  The only problem really was with the frosting.  There was way too much and it took forever to make (it takes a while to thicken).  Other than that this cake is amazing.  I think I had 2 slices and my dad ate the rest in 1 day.

I didn't add use the frosting in this recipe so I'm not sure on how gd is it.  But the cake is absolutely great!  This is the cheesecake recipe I had been looking!  The cream cheese really makes a difference in the texture and taste of the cake.  Thanx for posting this recipe!

A big thumbs down for this cake!! The cake was no great shakes and the frosting was a nightmare.  It was very runny and it didn't harden up after putting it in the refrigerator.  Would absolutely never make it again.  There are much better cake recipes on this website.

Made the cake without the frosting. My cake mix called for 1 1/4 cups water (which I did substitute with defrosted whole strawberries that I pureed in the blender), and 3 egg whites. I followed another reviewer's tip to only use 3 eggs max, and I used whole eggs since the recipe didn't specify egg whites only. It made exactly 24 cupcakes which came out fluffy and beautiful!

Delicious. The whole family inhaled it in a matter of minutes. So easy to make too. I just refrigerated the melted white chocolate frosting for a couple of hours before adding the Cool Whip to it and the frosting was not runny at all, such as many other reviewers indicated. I will definitely make this again and again!

This cake is amazing! I didn't use the icing though, I did a cream cheese frosting with strawberry cream cheese- absolutely delicious!

It's hard for me to justify a review of the orginal recipe when I made many of the changes listed on the site but here goes anyway.

Cake like listed by others is very moist- almost wet.  It also has a ugly purple color, but it does taste good if you don't mind the wet or the texture.  I thought it was okay.  My husband loved it.  I made it as recipe says but used fresh strawberries and a little sugar.  Also switched cream cheese for strawberry flavored.  If I were to make it again I probably would make a single layer and put the frosting and fresh berries on right before I served it to help with the moisture.  I made this as a double layer cake for a birthday.    

Frosting- I added extra cream cheese and about a third pack of pudding like others recommended to thicken it up.  It tasted a bit too much like cream cheese so I also added like a fourth of a cup of powdered sugar.  Frosting was good and turned  out fine.  

I added store bought cream cheese frosting in between layers because so many people said the cake would slide otherwise.  Also added fresh berries.

My husband said it tasted like strawberry shortcake. I personally thought it was just okay and probably wouldn't make it again unless he requested it.  

Overall, the gist of the other reviews is exactly what I found to be true about the cake.  The flavor is good but not overly strawberry (I would have liked more flavor, cake very moist almost wet, color kind of ugly purple.

delicious!! and beautiful!! i used strawberry cream cheese as suggested and only used the 3 eggs that my cake called for (4 seemed like a lot) the icing was very liquidy so i just put it back in the mixer till peaks began to form to have fluffy texture.

very moist and yummy, the only thing i don't like is the too much flavor of cream cheese, i only made 2/3 of the recipe to get a 6" cake plus 2 cupcakes, but still, the amount of cream cheese is too much for me. i used only fresh strawberries and pureed them and didn't add extra sugar, but the cake is sweet enough, but next time i'll try to add maybe 10-20g sugar and less cream cheese. i didn't do the frosting either, i just use whipped cream and confectioners' sugar, plus 1/8 teaspoon red food coloring, and fresh strawberries.

This cake was a HUGE HIT! I followed these other suggestions: Used French Vanilla cake mix, strawberry cream cheese, I beat the eggs before adding and used a different frosting. For the frosting I creamed together 1/2 c margarine and 1/2 c shortening, then beat in 5 c confectioner's sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp butter flavor, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/4 c milk, then slowly added in 8 oz of softend cream cheese. One thing I did notice was when I cut off the top of the cake to level it in the slightly smaller of the two cakes was the center was still pudding like in the center after cooling for over an hour. I put it back in the oven, with the top trimmed off for 15 minutes at 200 degrees and it was fine. I stuck it in the freezer to cool for about 15 minutes before icing, but it was still a little warm, but it was ok for icing because it had already set on the outside from the first time I cooked it. The cake was moist, dense and held up very well.  I topped it with sliced strawberries, that I marinated in sugar for an hour. You are supposed to drain the strawberries afterwards, but I didn't so the red juice ran down the cake a little bit, but it made the bottom very moist and the color of the juice looked nice on the cake. This was my first cake to bake and I was really happy about how it turned out. I'm making it again tonight!

This cake was DELICIOUS!!! My family loves it! Though my hubby was not fascinated by the white chocolate chunks in the frosting. So next time, I think I will melt the white chocolate before adding to the combo for the frosting. Otherwise, absolute a #1 recommend :-)

5 stars for the cake itself (I didn't even bother with the icing because it got such consistently bad reviews). The strawberry flavor is just right when you use strawberry cream cheese, and the cake is moist and tender.  25 minutes at 350 was just right in my oven, and I baked it in a 9 by 13 pan .  Thanks for the recipe :)

The cake was great, moist and yummy and just the right amount of strawberry flavor, but the frosting was way too runny!  It tasted great but it just wouldn't firm up.  I needed a quick fix so I took the rest of my heaving cream and made whipped cream and added some melted white chocolate to it and it saved the day! I also added some strawberry slices in between the layers for some extra flavor!

This cake was a BIG hit. They couldn't stop saying how good it was. Easy to make. I didn't make the white choclate topping, but instead made the Easy Whipped Ceam (w/ a hint of the juice from the strawberries) from this site. It was a nice accompaniment to the light strawberry flavor of the cake. I did think it was a little dense even though I added 2 cups pureed strawberries. I also added a tsp of strawberry extract for added flavor. I think next time I will add a 1/4 - 1/2 cup water just to make it a little less dense.

The texture of this cake is excellent.  However, the taste on mine didn't come out right since I used unsweetened strawberries and apparently not enough sugar.  You really need the sweetened strawberries-- otherwise they taste like dense, moist muffins.  They could use more strawberry flavor, too.  Also, I tried to use whipped cream instead of cool whip in the frosting, and it was quite runny.  Not sure if that's the substitution or the nature of the frosting, but if it's the latter, maybe it would help to use less of the cream/chocolate/cream cheese mixture relative to the whipped stuff.

Despite the fact that I feel like I'm cheating when I make this because it's not from scratch, it's always a crowd pleaser and comes out good.  If you're pressed for time, this is a good cake to make without worry.

I made this cake for my daughters b-day party and it got rave rewiews from everyone including the kids.  This was so easy.  Very moist and very tasty.  I think it was better after it sat for a day in the fridge.  Super yummy!!!!!  Will be making this again and again!

I warmed my cream cheese in the microwave before adding it to the batter, and even so there were tiny balls of cream cheese in the baked cake.  The icing was very yummy but the cake itself was not good at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and could barely taste any strawberry flavor in the cake.  Very disappointed in this.

The cake itself it delicious. I did use the strawberry cream cheese as advised by other reviewers. The frosting was not very good at all. I should have used heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip, maybe that would have made it better. I also used the strawberry cream cheese in the frosting, which I did not like at all. I'm serving the cake tomorrow for a birthday celebration at work, and seriously considering scraping the frosting off and starting over!

The cake part was awesome!  But, the icing was an absolute disaster!!  I followed the directions to a tee and it is really runny!  I would call it a glaze not icing.  Next time I will use the cake recipe but use a different icing.

I must agree with others who likened this cake to a dense pudding-like concoction.  It was also sickenly sweet.  I made the mistake of using the strawberry cream cheese.  In retrospect, I feel the regular cream cheese would have been fine.  Plus, I think the recipe would have been better without the extra egg!  I'm not a fan of cake mixes so maybe that's part of my problem.  I normally bake cakes from scratch.  The frosting was just a mess!  I had to freeze it for a couple hours and even then it just kind of glopped over the cake.  Several sweet-toothed family members taste-tested it before I served it and not one of them thought much of it.  I'll not be making this cake again.

This was possibly the WORST cake I have ever tried. It did not have much of a strawberry flavor, disgustingly sweet, and the texture was that of cookie dough (and, yes, it was fully cooked through). I will never make this recipe again.

I made this cake last night for my neice.  I have tried many of the Strawberry Cake recipies from this site and this one is my favorite!  The kids have liked all the ones I have tried but this is hands down the best!  I used a butter recipe yellow cake mix - and did increase the egg as directed.  I did have to bake the cake for an extra 10 minutes-but otherwise it was perfect!  I did not try the frosting - I went with a strawberry/cream cheese/powdered sugar combination.  Very nice recipe!

This was pretty good, very moist. It didn't have a strong enough strawberry flavor though even though I used strawberry cream cheese, as suggested. Next time I will use more frozen strawberries and less of the syrup. Also, nest time I will substitute real heavy cream for the Cool Whip, I'm not a fan of the flavor.

The cake tasted pretty good, but one slice really filled me up.  I wasn't a big fan of this different taste because it's not like the moist cakes I'm used to eating.  But overall it was good. thx

This cake was so yummy.  The cake was very moist and the frosting was fluffy and wonderful.  I will be making this cake again for sure. I followed this recipe exactly. Next time I will trying adding just a bit of red food coloring to see if I can get the cake batter just a little more pink.   You will want to try this recipe!

Maybe I didn't make this right, but I was not a fan at all!  I baked it in a 9x13" pan, and baked it about 40 minutes, which made the top as brown as I could let it get without burning it.  The inside was so moist it was wet, and extremely dense.  The frosting did not hold its shape well.  I would suggest using just whipped cream because the frosting is expensive.  Maybe if I covered the top of the cake with tin foil while it was baking it could bake longer without browning the top too much.

This cake was absolutely delicious! Following the other's suggestions, I used strawberry cream cheese in the cake mix. Very good. I was a little stressed about being able to tell when it was done, but after taking it out and putting it back in several times, I found the toothpick did actually come out pretty clean and it's just necessary to make sure it doesn't jiggle. I was making this for a large group of guests and didn't want to venture into the icing this time around so I just used 1 c. whipping cream mixed with 1 c. milk and instant pudding (cheesecake flavored). Once mixed, I folded it into a container of strawberry cool whip - plenty of strawberry flavor. Definitely keep this cake refrigerated. Everybody raved! I'll definitely make this again, thank you!

I made this cake exactly as directed but frosted it with a buttercream frosting instead of the frosting in the recipe, because I wanted a frosting that would hold up well to piping and decorating. As far as the cake goes, it is delicous but understand that it is a heavy cake with a similar texture to a muffin, and the strawberry flavor is very mild. I would say that if you understand those factors, you will enjoy it, but if you are looking for a light/fluffy cake texture, keep looking. This cake held up well to a stacked layer cake and I received many compliments on it.

Good intentions, but the recipe did not work for me! This cake was dense with chunks of cream cheese in it. The frosting sounded great, but I did not care for it at all. I even left it in the fridge overnight. When I went to frost the cake it just slipped everywhere.  This was like a stawberry nightmare cake for me!

The cake was dense and delicious with plenty of strawberry flavor.  I baked the cake according to the recipe but used strawberry cream cheese instead of plain.  I also had to bake the cake longer that specified (about 30 minutes).  I used a pudding/cool whip frosting and made a fruit filling from strawberries, sugar and a little water and cornstarch, cooked down and thickened.  I layered the cake with the filling and the frosting.  The combination was too thin for this fragile cake and it fell apart (layers sliding, cake cracking, etc.).  If I make the cake again I will make a 9x13, single layer cake and let it sit in the fridge overnight before serving.  I think a blueberry version of this cake would be great, maybe with a lemon frosting.

This cake is very delicious and everyone loved it. Next time I'm going to get large tooth picks to stick it in while I'm icing it and then sticking it in the freezer for about 20 - 30 minutes so it'll stay. The whipped icing is hard to work with but that doesn't keep me from making it. It is delicious in every sense of the word! I will definitely be making this again!

It was OK, but not  quite what I expected.  Wasn't as flavorful as I was looking for.  Also, adding some red food coloring to the cake mix will give it a more pinkish appearance, rather than a pinky-tan that it turned out to be.

I made a few adjustments to this recipe but it was still great. Instead of using sweetened frozen strawberries, I used fresh strawberries and added a small box of strawberry gelatin. I also only used 4 oz. cream chz because I forgot to buy enough for the frosting but it didn't seem to make a difference. Wasn't crazy about the frosting but I will definitely make the cake again.

The cake was pretty good, but I liked just dipping fresh strawberries in the icing even better! I had trouble with the cream cheese being clumpy, but that's probably because I just using a fork to mix it (I don't really have a lot of kitchen supplies). Overall, the cake was fun to make/decorate and I would probably make it again.

This was delicious!!!  I recommend chilling the frosting well before frosting the cake.  I did not chill it, and my top layer slid off during the car ride to Easter dinner.  However, it tasted so good that nobody cared how it looked.  Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent - In my health-conscious family the challenge is usually to cut the dessert small enough, but when I served this everyone went back for seconds. I accidentally left the cream cheese out of the cake, but it came out great. I added powdered sugar to the icing to thicken it up a bit and kept the cake refrigerated.

This was an excellent cake!  I used the frosting as is for the center and top, and then mixed the remaining frosting w/some confectioners sugar to thicken it up to frost the sides.  I think next time I will thicken up the entire batch of frosting w/confectioners sugar.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  Magnificent reviews from everyone!

Made this cake for my wife for Valentines Day. She loved it. It was so easy to make and turned out great. I loved the taste and texture of the cake, and the frosting was out of this world. I put parchment paper in the cake pans before baking and the cakes fell out easily. Will definetly make again.

This is a really good recipe. I noticed a few people had trouble with the frosting. I had trouble my first try, but if you beat the cream cheese well before adding the cream and white chocolate--and then completely cool the mixture before adding it to the Cool Whip, it comes out great.

I made this cake for a coworkers' birthday and it was a hit!  Easy to make - although I recommend pureeing the cream cheese with the thawed berries for a smoother texture.  Only criticism is with the icing - very gooey.  It was so good I made two and kept one for my family!

A definate hit for my daughter's 2 year old birthday...especially with frosting and fresh strawberries in the middle and on top. I also found that the frosting made about twice what was required but the extra frosting made a wonderful fruit dip/spread!  Yum!

The cake was moist and tasted great.  But, I had problems with the frosting.  It was like trying to frost with lumpy milk.  I never got it to thicken or whip up.  My husband thought the cake would be better with regular frosting.  Don't think I'd try this cake again.

This cake was the best cake I've ever tasted.  My mom said she never tasted such a moist cake with such a combination of flavors.  It didn't last long in my house.

This cake was phenomenal – I got rave reviews from kids and parents alike! Will definitely be making this one again. I followed the recipe pretty closely, although I did sub out ~1.25c fresh strawberries for the frozen and strawberry whipped cream cheese. After pureeing the strawberries in the blender, I just added the oil, splash of vanilla, and 3 eggs right to the blender to mix them together, and then added all the liquid to the dry cake mix. The frosting turned out great too! I used the "strawberry cake filling" recipe from this site to separate the layers. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This was delicious but the color wasn't pretty.  I will add some red food coloring or use a strawberry cake mix next time.  I think the icing is great.  I made this icing with a Duncan Hines orange supreme cake mix and I believe it was the best cake I've ever made.  I added orange zest and substituted orange juice for the water, split the layers so it was a four layer cake.  It tasted like a Dreamsicle.  I took it to work and it was a hit.  Just got to keep it refrigerated.

This is my first time making the cake and I read all the reviews, they were very helpful. I did bake it in two 8 inch pans and not 9 inch. The cake came out perfect, however, I choose to use the frosting recipe that comes with the recipe. I did heat the heavy whipping cream and poured it over the white chocolate, then I cooled it and made sure everything I had for my mixer was cold before beating it. (I thought this would make it stiffer) When I beat it, it did not whip up liked I hoped. I let it go for a long while too. I then added the room temp strawberry cream cheese and then folded in the whipped topping. It was very runny. I was afraid to frost the cake with such a runny frosting...so I choose to start again and whipped the heavy whipping cream alone then put in the strawberry whip cream, then folded in the Cool Whip. It turned out much stiffer and was easy to frost. Can anyone tell me is the frosting suppose to be runny like that and then set up in the fridge overnight? The second time I did not add the chocolate either. I kept it simple. I did shave some white chocolate over the top with the strawberries. I am very curious about the frosting!!!! Anyone??? What was the consistency of yours???

Use strawberry cream cheese and no more then three eggs. For the frosting heat the whip cream until it starts to boil. Add chopped chocolate. Refrigerate until cold then whip until thick. Add remaining ingredients.

This was very good except the frosting. I let the cream mixture cool ( not cold) and maybe that was my problem.  It was runny when I added the cool whip... never got hard. Ended up using a buttercream frosting which everyone loved.  THe cake was great. Will make again with a different frosting. Delicious.

Can't say enough about this cake.  I am usually the designated baker for birthdays in my office.  This is a frequent request.  No changes necessary.  As an update after making this recipe for several years...  The only semi negative comment I've had on this cake is that the color looks more like a spice cake.  I have now discovered that Betty Crocker has a Strawberry cake mix with pudding that doesn't have pink flecks in it.  This version worked great for the color and even amped up the strawberry flavor more.

I gave this 2 stars because I didn't like that it wasn't a cake texture and that the leftovers got soggy after sitting for a couple days.  After adding strawberry extract and 3/4 packet of strawberry gelating I felt the flavor was great.

Great cake; everyone loved it.  I made this in a tube pan, which doesn't require as much icing, so you can make the cream & white chocolate mixture but not add as much cool whip (I'm not a big fan of cool whip anyway).   I followed others' reviews and used strawberry cream cheese in the cake mix, and beat the cream/white chocolate mixture to firm it up a little before adding the cool whip.   Next time, since I have a small family, I might make 2 loaf pans, decorate one and freeze the other for later.

Just not quite a 5 star cake. Close though. I used strawberry cream cheese and added 1tsp strawberry extract to the cake mix.  I only used 3egg whites as that is what the box called for. Next time I will not purée the strawberries as I think little chunks throughout the cke would be great.  The frosting was good. I didn't have any problems with it being to thin. I just blended the cream cheese first and let it all sit I the fridge for a few hours before adding the col whip.  I put a layer of sliced strawberries in between the layers of cake along with a layer of frosting. Made for. Nice presentation.  I might use more strawberries in the batter next time.  Baked at 325 for 34 minutes.  I really didn't think it was done but was afraid of overcoming so pulled it out and am thankful I did because although it was very dense it was very moist.

This cake is a beautiful presentation, but the cake was dry and a brownish color. I would have liked the cake to be a pretty pink color. Next time I might use a strawberry cake mix. Love the frosting, and I did add an extra 2 oz of cream cheese to thicken.

I made this cake today for my brothers birthday....everybody loved it, but I did add an extra 1/3 cup of the frozen strawberries pureed to give it more of a strawberry taste.....it came out very good....I thought the icing was thin, but to thicken it up I added 2 ounces more of cream cheese and an extra 4 ounces of whipped topping...all together the cake was great...

The reason for the 4 star rating is because I didn't like the frosting with this it was too sweet and overpowered the delicious flavor of the cake.   The cake itself is a 5 star cake!  I used the "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting listed on AR and it was the perfect substitute!

awesome recipe, I did follow the other reviews and used the strawberry cream cheese. Made it for my cousins birthday after looking through tons of other recipes i decided on this one. She doesn't usually like cakes but she loved this one. I did use fresh strawberries that I pureed with a tablespoon of sugar. The is defined a keeper :D

Very good moist cake.  I followed the recipe almost exactly...only I used 8 oz of cream cheese in the cake and 8 oz in the frosting.  I think this helped thicken the frosting, in which I frosted a little bit at a time. I would frost some and then refridgerate.  I also added an extra layer of white cake in the middle....only because I was serving a large group.  It turned out beautiful!

I made this cake for my daughter's first birthday party. The entire cake - all four tiers - was eaten by our 20 some guests. I'm not kidding - the whole thing - I didn't even find crumbs on the plates afterwords!  p.s. I made some mistakes while making the frosting and found a quick alternative - I mixed store bought frosting with the whipped cream. But I did figure out the mistake after the party and tried the recipe again. The homemade frosting had a more delicate flavor to it. Both versions were awesome.

This was awesome! We kept it in the fridge and the frosting was fine.  Made sure frosting mixture was completely cooled in fridge before adding whipped topping. Cake tasted so good. Will make again for sure. Thanks for recipe!

I just tried this recipe yesterday! It turned out great! The cake was very moist, but not wet like some of the negative reviews stated. However, I used 2 cups of strawberry puree (just from the frozen bag, unsweetened) to give the cake more of a strawberry taste and it turned out to give the cake a nice pink-purple kind of color, instead of the forewarned gray. Also, due to the negative reviews about the frosting/icing, I decided to use white chocolate pudding mix instead of the white chocolate itself. It gave the frosting mixture much more body and allowed me to frost the cake easier! It also tastes great! Other than that, I followed the directions to a T and it all turned out great! The cake and the frosting turned out to be not too sweet, which would have destroyed this recipe for me. I'm serving as a birthday cake tonight and had enough for a few cupcakes! I will definitely make this cake again!

I would have given the cake itself five stars but I did not care for the frosting.  Together they made a mediocre cake.  I like the idea behind it but the frosting didn't set up right.  I kept trying to get the frosting to whip up hard but it wouldn't.  It pooled right off the cake.  I think next time I will use white chocolate pudding mix in place of the white chocolate squares.

The flavor of this cake and frosting is amazing...  But the textures....not so good!  I think this would be much easier to make in a 9x13 pan and pour (yes pour) the frosting over the top!  Yum!!  Anyone who eats the cake will NOT complain....as it is super good...but the frosting is a little frustrating - and would just run off the cake...(even though I refrigerated it overnight before trying to frost after reading other reviews).  The frosting really makes an excellent fruit dip!!!  I could just eat it with a spoon!

This is not a light fluffy cake so if that's what your looking for, don't attempt this cake. I did substitute strawberry cream cheese for the plain kind and it had a great flavor.  However, it was very, very dense.  So dense it was almost wet but that may have been from my keeping it in the refrigerator overnight. It was more dense than I thought it would be.  Pudding like is correct.  I only added 3 eggs as the recipe called for and I can only imagine that a 4th might have made it heavier, but, it may actually have lightened it up a bit.  I made it for a co-workers birthday and kind of wished I had done a test run as this is the first time I've made this cake.  I didn't use the frosting listed but instead frosted ith with a strawberry whipped cream frosting.  I liked it but didn't think it was the best I've ever had.  I did think it had a good strawberry flavor though.

Delicious cake. I used a chocolate cake mix (the recipient wanted a chocolate cake) and it was fabulous. Very beautiful with the white frosting. However, I was transporting the cake, and because the icing did not hold well, the upper half of the cake slid right off. I was quite devastated until everyone clipped the cake in minutes anyway. Will definitely make again. Will have to figure out how to make frosting hold up (because it really is scrumptious frosting).

I don't really care much for strawberry cake, but made this for a baby shower at work. It was awesome! Everyone, including me, loved it! It was even better the next day after sitting in the refrigerator. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and used strawberry cream cheese in the cake. SO yummy! This is definitely going in my recipe box.

The icing tasted alright, but it was very runny. The cake fell in the middle, and wouldn't cook evenly. Ruined a birthday cake, it was very disappointing.

This is my new favorite cake recipe!! I made it for a dinner at church. Definitely a keeper and a make again in the very near future. I had French Vanilla cake mix on hand, so I used it instead of white cake mix. I didn't try the frosting because I ran out of time but the cake is perfect with just a little whipped topping on it.

I just made this and it was amazing. I used some mini spring form pans to make these because I did not have anything else to use at the time. Five small cakes took 25-30 mins to cook at the same time. I then cut each into smaller layers and stacked them. They are very nice, cute looking cakes...But they taste 20 times better than they look

this was pretty tasty, but I must say the frosting was a bit thin. I had to stick the entire cake in the freezer to make sure it wouldnt run off the plate when it was time to serve! Otherwise, great cake!

This was delicious, rich and definitely a splurge.  It was thick and creamy and tasted best cold.  I made it really fancy with strawberries everywhere, even between the layers.  I did use another reviewers idea to add dry cream cheese pudding to the frosting recipe and let it chill overnight.  It was just the right "spreading" consistency. This cake received many compliments.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This cake was a hit with my family!  Everyone wanted more.  We found that the cake tasted MUCH better cold, straight from the fridge.  Next time, I would make the frosting with less whipped topping to make it easier to frost with - it was very thin, but delicious.

I haven't made any other strawberry cakes, but this one is great.  I used low fat cream cheese and it seemed fine.  I tried non-fat cream cheese for the frosting, but I wouldn't recommend that.  I also used fresh strawberries instead of frozen.

I was looking for something to fix up a strawberry cake mix (since it was all artificially flavored- icky!) so I tried this recipe. I'm only rating the cake, since I didn't try the frosting. The cake wasn't bad- it was EXTREMELY moist and pretty dense, but not a bad texture, if you like a moist cake. The mix called for 3 eggs, and after reading reviews, I didn't add another. I also used a bit less cream cheese. The flavor was ok but not great, probably the fault of the artificial:( cake mix, although I don't think it would have had much flavor if I had used a white mix. I would not make this again unless I happen to come across another strawberry cake mix.

Absolutely fantastic!!!!!  I followed some of the suggestions on here and used strawberry cream cheese in the cake, I also substituted a Vanilla Cake mix for the white cake, which called for three eggs, so I used two whole eggs and two egg whites.    The frosting was awesome.  I was a little concerned with it being too runny especially after reading all the reviews...I added a couple tablespoons of powdered sugar and a couple teaspoons of flour.  I wish I wouldn't have added the extra sugar, because it made it a pinch sweeter than I would have liked it, but that still didn't stop me from licking the spoon like crazy!  I put the frosting in the fridge for a couple of hours, and even stuck it in the freezer for about 20 mins because I was nervous about it, but it ended up being absolutely perfect.  It made a ton of frosting and I put a thick layer of frosting in between my cake layers along with a nice layer of fresh strawberries.  I think I could have skipped the extra sugar and flour in the frosting and it would have thickened up fine in the fridge after a couple of hours.  I also put a couple of drops of red food coloring in the cake batter, because some of the review said the cake turned a strange grey color, and this was for my 4 year old daughters princess party so I wanted to make sure it was nice and pink.  It turned out gorgeous.  There were tiny lumps of white chocolate in the frosting that no one else noticed by me.  Other than that it was perfect and I will most lik

I made this cake for my Son's 6th birtday...it was gone the same day that it was made.  Everyone loved it.  The cake was moist and the frosting was "yummy."  I did add a packet of vanilla pudding mix to the frosting and left it in the fridge overnight.  I don't think I had to add the pudding as the consistency seemed ok.

As written, it's not anything spectacular. I thought the idea was great and it had my mouth watering just reading it.  The "icing" was too watery and the cake was too dense.  I may try again using less eggs or only egg whites. Thanks for sharing.

The cake part was good.  A nice dense cake.  The frosting was NOT good.  I did all recommendation to thicken it but, my top layer slid off.  If you're going to make this....use a different frosting.

THE best cake I have ever baked or had. Tired of chocolate cakes (though I'm a self-confessed chocaholic), I made this for our 3rd Valentine's together, and it will be a regular on all special occasions from now on. Followed the recipe to the tee. As it was large for just the two of us, so I sent a few slices with hubby to work and..of course got wonderful compliments! If I was you, I'd never share the recipe :)

I have to say- this cake was really awful. I love strawberries, I love chocolate, and I love whipped cream, but this was a misuse of all three ingredients. The cake's texture is like a really thick, cold muffin, and I'm sad to say, the flavor is just not there. Only change I made was to use strawberry cream cheese instead of regular in the batter. The icing's pretty good, though. My boyfriend liked that part of it.

I followed the directions but I was a little lost on putting the cake together. What was I suppose to put in between the layers? The whipped cream? Or the Strawberry? Or both? I wish the directions were a little more specific for beginners. The cake didnt come out as pretty as the picture but it taste good.

Everyone loved the cake. My cousin proclaimed is as his favorite. I really did enjoy it as well. I put a layer of sliced strawberries for the filling. The white choc. did harden a little when mixed with the icing, but it was a nice treat to bite down on the little chunk of white chocolate. My cousing thought it was nuts at first which isn't a bad idea to try next time. Overall...we loved it!

Next time use parchment paper...hard getting out of pan! I had to use Butter Cream Frosting in the middle, other was too slippery. Family thought it was very good. (Made for Rob's B-day.)

This cake was absolutely delicious!  Very easy too!  I only made the cake (for time reasons), but am looking forward to making the icing next time.  The only changes I made were to add strawberry cream cheese instead of regular and to use a milk chocolate cake mix instead of yellow.  The cake was for my son's 4th birthday and I didn't want it to be pink :).  Everyone loved it.  I frosted it with a cream cheese frosting.

I was totally unsure of this recipes as I was making it!  The cake part came out dense and I was not totally convinced that it was cooked through (it was though!)..when I was spreading the frosting it really looked watery but firmed up when it was chilled....As another reviewer suggested, I used stawberry cream cheese in the cake part. It was a nice hint of stawberry without being overpowering....I personally did not care for the cake but I'm giving 5 stars because all my guests loved it!

Very good, very easy, very moist cake.  This is my second time making it.  This time, I used my go-to frosting, 1 Cup milk with F/F S/F Jello pudding, and added white chocolate cream cheese (new product that I noticed at the store) before folding into 8 oz. Lite Cool Whip.  Baked it in 9x13 pan and made it into a flag cake w/blueberries & strawberries!

My opinion the cake was a bit dense, but good. So I did half water & half strawberry puree for the cake mix & used egg whites too. I also added powder sugar in the whole icing mixture. For the center of the cake I put cool whip topping in lieu of the frosting. It was a hit fo Father's Day. Thanks!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. Everyone was impressed by the look, the smell, and the taste of the cake. But I agree on the comment about the cake is a lot of work. I was very frustrated that the icing is WAY too watery. It's very difficult to spread all over the cake when the icing keeps on dripping down. So I took the reviwer's advice on freezing the icing to make it thicker. But you will have to work fast enough, otherwise, the icing will go back to its watery state. Also my cake was very thin, so I added some fresh strawberries in between the layers, but still not what I hope for a nice puffy cake. With tons of leftover frosting, I think it might be OK to double the cake ingredients to make 4 layers. But you will need to consider how much FAT it might be in a slice.

This cake was a waste of valuable ingredients and time.  Not much strawberry flavor and the icing was not good at all.  I usually love the recipes on this website, but this one was a total flop.

Cake was very good, frosting was just okay.  Per others comments on the runny consistency of the frosting, I took my time assembling this cake.  I slightly froze each cake layer and the frosting prior to assembling.  I think this helped because the whipped frosting IS very runny. I added a layer of chopped fresh strawberries to the middle layer. I also added red food coloring to the cake mix to give it a true pink color. Although I will probably make the cake again I think I will opt for a different frosting next time, I don't think this one is worth the hassle.

I thought this was YUMMY!  I don't like white chocolate, though, so I used dark chocolate chips instead.  It was a great contrast with the cake.

I made this cake last night. I waited 32 minutes as some reviewer advised but it was still liquid. So I let it another 10 minutes. I haven't tasted it but there is a “big whole” in the middle of my cake. I am sure I baked it too long but it looked to me incredible watery. I mean, I understand it was going to be moist but this was almost liquid!. I will tell you later how the frosting comes up and if at least the taste is great! so far 3 stars for the recipe. UPDATE: I didn’t like it but my husband loved it! It seems awefully a lot of work for a cake that taste as a regular cake but very moist (even though I cooked it longer that I supposed..the middle of the cake was still liquid!) for the frosting I used strawberry cream cheese and I DID love it! I will use this in another cake!

I made this cake for Mother's Day and it was a HUGE hit!!!  It was so moist and decadent!  It was also so pretty that my Mother-in-law wanted a picture of it!  EVERYONE begged that I save the recipe and make it again!  We literally did not have a crumb left!

This cake was fantastic!  I made it on Easter and it did not last long at ALL!  It was very moist and turned out perfect.  The frosting recipe could definitely be cut in half - I had an entire extra bowl leftover!  It sure is good frosting though - you could use it for other things such as fruit dip.  Anyway, great recipe!

I love this recipe. This cake is like nothing I've tasted before. I made it for a birthday party and everyone loved it. It is very moist and pudding-like but that's what makes it great! The frosting is perfect. I sliced strawberries and decorated the top. I like it best warm!

I only made the frosting to use on a different cake, so I'm only rating that - but it was AWESOME!  Everyone loved it - it was like amazing fresh strawberry Fluff.  My aunt and sisters kept sticking their fingers in the bowl to "taste" a little more.  Plus it was a gorgeous pink color.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this for my husband for Father's Day, and it got RAVE reviews from all.  Simply loved it.  I was a little concerned at first, thought I had overcooked it, but it was just fine.  Not sure about making this in a 9 inch pan, I made two 8X2 inch pans, and it was barely enough.  I used standard Wilton pans, which are a little higher than those you can get at most retail stores like Target etc...so maybe that's why. I would not recommend a 9 inch pan.  I also mashed the cr. chz b4 adding it to the melted chocolate mixture, and it was fine.  Let the choc mixture cool and then add the cool whip.  however, it's still runny and will not spread.  don't even try.  this is the type of stuff you pour on and let it drip down the sides.  

Also, I only made 1/2 of the frosting mix, which was enough for the two 8 inch cakes with some in middle and some on top.  

overall, really moist, great, unique cake!

I made this a while back for a Thanksgiving potluck at work.  It was a hit, disappearing pretty quickly.  Since then, I've made it several more times.  My husband still keeps asking me to make it.

I made this cake for my friend's birthday.  It was a huge hit and delicious.  The frosting was so good, I had quite a bit left over.  I used angel food cake mis instead of white cake and I recommend decreasing the cooking time, maybe 15 minutes.  I will definitely made this again, my mom has already requested it.

This cake was AWESOME! I made this for my sister's birthday today and everyone loved it. My mom and husband are my toughest critics and they both said it was delicious. I took the advice of others and cooled the white chocolate mixture before adding the whipped cream; therefore, I had no problems with the frosting. This is definitely a gourmet dessert without the effort. I will definitiely be making this cake on a regular basis. Simply awesome!

This was a real crowd-pleaser! I have never been asked for a recipe so much! I concur with the warnings about letting the chocolate cool completely, and I added some Grand Marinier to the strawberries. EXCELLENT!

Excellent cake, the frosting is a little rich for my family so I don't use as much white chocolate. Still Very Very Good.

5 stars for the cake, but only 3 for the frosting.  It was an absolutely yummy dense cake and the frosting did taste great but I was looking for a frosting to ice top and sides.  This frosting retains the whipping cream consistency and did well just on the top and in centre, plus it made a huge amount amd I could only use half.  But the cake made up for it and got rave reviews - I'm thinking of using the cake recipe for my wedding cake.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday and it was a HUGE hit!  The frosting is amazing with fresh strawberries and so perfect for this rich, moist cake.  She's already asked for me to make it again next year!

This cake was quite good (very moist which is nice) however I found that although I had greased the pans, the cake stuck on the bottom and was difficult to get out of the pan. I would use waxed paper in the pan next time. I agree with the previous reviewers that whipping the cream cheese before adding whipping cream and chocolate would be a great idea as you have to whisk for a long time to get the lumps out. Everyone loved it though and even people who don't like cake said it was awesome. Will make again, thanks Beth!

Yummy with an intriguing texture.  Cake did fall in middle, think I overmixed which I've heard will cause this problem. Due to this.. I sliced the top of the cake to make it level.  Then spread some of the extra pureed strawberries on it and frosted.  Best mistake ever!! The extra thin layer of puree added a nice tarty kick to the cake.  Did have a little trouble with frosting, really recommend doing frosting at least a day ahead or first. The extra time is totally worth it.. the frosting was totally delish and went superbly with the cake.. not to mention the finger swipes that I kept doing! ;-)

My HHA made this recipe for me as I have MS.  I thought this strawberry cake was outstanding!  I gave some to my HHA and she shared it with her family, and they thought it was great.  I just followed the instructions, and both cake and frosting turned out perfect.  I find the reviews extremely helpful.  My HHA mentioned the white chocolate in combination with the other ingredients for the frosting was surprisingly good.  (She's just trying to keep on my good side-just so I'll continue sharing the final product with her)

The cake recipe came out great.Instead of making it like the recipe said I bought 2 cake boxes and made white cake and then made the stawberry cake. I them cut all 4 cakes in 2 and layered them. In each layer I put frosting then sliced strawberries then cake and repeated until 8 layers where gone. It came out great the frosting came out great. I think the frosting thicked up beacasue I put extra whipped cream and put it in the fridge in a metal bowl. That seem to help. The olny reason I did it this way is because when we cooked it like the recipe said my husband tased it and said it was good but it tasted more like Cheesecake. I wanted more of a cake. So putiing the stawberry cake in between regular cake by layering made it more fun.

I loved the ideas of this cake, (the strawberries used as the water substitute.) The cake was extremely moist and yummy. I did not make the frosting that was paired with the recipe. I wanted to decorate the cake for a birthday party. The frosting I used was way too sweet for the cake. I guess I will have to make this cake again to try it with the frosting given. OH DARN!

WOW, great cake.  Made it for a party and got rave reviews.  The only thing is I should have listened to previous reviewers and mixed the cream cheese before adding the cream and chocolate.

Just ok.  The icing tasted wonderful, but was impossible to frost the cake with (even after having it in the fridge for hours.)  I won't make this one again.

This was the best cake I've made in ages.  My daughter wanted a strawberry shorcake for her birthday party, I opted for this instead.  Everyone loved it.  My Dad being the finiky eater that he is also raved!!!  I put the frosting between the layers with added sliced fresh strawberries and garnished the sides with sliced fresh strawberries.  It was beautiful.

This cake was awesome!  I brought it to a potluck dinner, and people were commenting on how great the cake looked before I even reached the front door!  It looks great with fresh strawberries on top, and the cake has a wonderful, refreshing flavor.  This one is a keeper.

Made this for my 18 yr old daughter's birthday party and it was a HIT!  The frosting was wonderful and everyone thought it was made from a bakery!  However, if it starts to melt as you spread it on, put back in the fridge for a few minutes.  I garnished with strawberry halves on the sides and put back in the refrigerator and it held it into place.  Everyone has asked for a copy of the recipe.  I'm not a baker, but I sure seemed like one that day!  Thank you, Beth Lemieux, for sharing this with us!

I've heard many wedding cake decorators use this for their strawberry cake option.  I can see why!

I made this for my 6 yr. old step-sister's birthday party and it was a HUGE hit. I made a 13X9" cake and placed whole strawberries the entire way around it so that everyone got a berry with their cake.  I will defininely use this recipe again.

I loved this cake - especially the light creamy frosting - but the recipe for the icing makes about twice what is needed...otherwise, this recipe was gret since it uses box mix!!! :)

Delicious!  So moist with a wonderful strawberry flavor.  I didn't even add oil to the batter and it still turned out very moist.  I also used a combination of fat free cream cheese and lite raspberry cream cheese -- I recommend the same!  This cake really hit the spot!

My family enjoyed this recipe so much. I used a pineapple cake mix instead of the white. I used 4 eggs but didn't add any oil and the cake didn't come out heavy. I will be making this recipe again. The frosting was so unique and delicious too. A real winner!

Turned out very dense and kind of gooey. It had a strong strawberry flavour which I liked, but the texture wasn't my favourite.

I didn't have any problems with the cake and it did have a strong strawberry flavor.  I used strawberries I had just picked that day.  It was a little too sweet for us!  Good concept, but I think next time I will try the other strawberry cake recipe on this site which has some lemon incorporated into it for more tang to offset my deliciously sweet berries.

I made this for Easter.  It was absolutely delicious!  I used the strawberry cream cheese as others suggested.  Considering I am not a huge baker I was tickled it came out so well considering so many others had trouble with it.  My son said that it tasted just like a Dairy Queen strawberry milkshake.  Unfortunately, I could not find fresh strawberries at the store so was unable to add those to the top and am looking forward to making it again when they come into season.   thanks for the recipe!

This cake was so disappointing and gross. Like others have said, it sank in the middle, was too heavy from the fruit and never fully cooked because of all the fruit. It was doughy and was a brown/gray color. I even baked longer but that didn’t help. Then there was the frosting nightmare, which I followed to a “T” and thoroughly cooled but it fully set. It wasn’t completely runny but wasn’t thick either. The consistency was funnier than cool whip. So this went into the trash. Wasn’t cheap to make either.

This cake  has become our family's Easter Brunch Dessert Tradition! I used the recommended strawberry flavored cream cheese from other reviewers to help boost the strawberry flavor. It is very moist and perfect in flavor - not too sweet and not bland.  I also just used store bought vanilla frosting because I'm not a huge fan of white chocolate & I wanted to save time.  It is easy to make and is perfect for Spring or Summer.

This cake was awesome!  Since I didn't read the reviews until I got home with all the ingredients, I decided to add a small box of strawberry jello to spruce up the strawberry flavor.  I have no idea why some people had trouble with the frosting.  It was super easy to make and it really complimented the delicious cake.

The cake was awesome using the strawberry cream cheese. My icing flopped actually curdled. So I had to whip up a buttercream frosting and add strawberry cream cheese to it. It turned out yummy.

After reviewing the reviews, I made some adjustments. I made the white cake mix according to the recipe on the box.  I didn't add strawberries into the cake mix. Also, since the frosting seemed to be too sweet for many of the reviewers, I whipped 1/2 pt. of heavy whipping cream along with 1.5 oz (half a box) of Cream Cheese flavored Jello Instant pudding mix.  I spread of of this mixture on top of the first layer, topped with some frozen strawberries (drained as much as is possible). Then I placed the second layer on top and frosted the top with the rest of the whipped cream mixture.  Then I took 1/2 pt. of whipping cream, sweetened with a little sugar and whipped it up and used it to cover the sides of the cake.  I garnished the finished cake with fresh strawberries just like in the recipe's picture.  It was a hit and not overly sweet.

My cake mix called for 3 egg whites, so that is what I used, and it still turned out quite heavy but good.  I also used strawberry cream cheese as others mentioned.  I baked it in a 9X12 and covered the top with the frosting and sliced strawberries.  Everyone liked it, but I think whipped cream would be better than the frosting.  The white chocolate seemed to give it a gritty texture and didn't really add anything to the taste.

Made this cake for Mother's Day and was not disappointed.  Read the reviews and let the chocolate cool before adding the whipped cream and it turned out perfectly!  My cake was devoured while the famous Portillo's chocolate cake was hardly touched.

I was in a chocolate cake mood this weekend, and switched the white cake for a chocolate cake mix and it was wonderful.  I loved the density of the cake and the frosting was too yummy to just have on cake.  I had a few strawberries left over and dipped the strawberries in the frosting!!!  Amazing recipe :)

Only 1 word can describe this cake, AWESOME!  My daughter requested this cake for her birthday and I have to admit that it was even better than I expected!  I followed the suggestions of others and used strawberry cream cheese, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This cake was amazing. The first time I made it I didn't have quite enough white chocolate so I used 4oz instead, and it still turned out fine. It was made for a coworker and everyone loved it. My children have requested it with different types of fruit on top. Thanks for the recipe!

I've had trouble with the cream cheese mixing in with both the cake and frosting.  Be sure to get Philadelphia cream cheese!

This recipe was OK, but I think my standard white cake (in a 13 x 9 pan) with two 10 oz. thawed frozen sweetened strawberries poured on the cool cake, pricked with lots of holes with a fork to let the juices flow into the cake, and iced with cool whip or whipped cream is better. It's my standby and always the birthday cake for my husband. Very easy to make.....but loved by all!

I did think the strawberry dream cake tasted better on the 2nd day. Too rich and quite time consuming to make.

I made this cake for my husband's 50th birthday and was very dissapointed.  The frosting was excellent, but the cake itself was far too dense for our liking.  It weighed about a ton!!  Won't make this again.

I gave this 4 stars, but I'll admit that I'm one of those annoying reviewers who made substitutions.  I took a short cut and used a strawberry cake mix instead of making it from scratch.  I made this for my mom's birthday and everyone loved it--even my husband who doesn't really like cake.  I had a hard time getting the white chocolate and cream cheese to completely blend, but other than that, it was yummy.
