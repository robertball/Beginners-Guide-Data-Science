I did not use the "brownie" portion of this recipe only the frosting. I used Chocolate Malt flavored Ovaltine. It worked really well. I thought it was delicious and the frosting got great reviews from all!

I used malt powder bought in a health food store since it can't be found easily in the regular grocery stores. The bars tasted o.k. kind of like brownies but we did not like the frosting at all and decided to leave it off. We all agreed it had a heavy molasses flavor. Maybe that wouldn't happen with regular malt bought in the grocery store.

The bar part of the recipe is good. Sort of a malt brownie. I found the frosting a little odd. Malt powder just didn't blend smooth enough in the forsting for my taste. Would consider making it again maybe without the frosting or with a normal chocolate butter cream.

This is soooo good! I made these for a bake sale at my university and some of my fellow bakers teased me for buying "store bought" items. These bars vanished like magic! I thought the frosting was great and it was very smooth in my opinion. The only thing I will do different next time is double the recipe!
