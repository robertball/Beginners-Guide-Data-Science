Wonderful!!  Added a diced zucchini instead of peas because that's what I had on hand.  Meatballs were too big for my taste so next time I'll either make them smaller or cut them.  I used brown rice and it was great.  Even better the next day but had to add a little more broth at the last minute because the rice soaks up the "soup" part!  Thanks!

I was VERY surprised by this recipe.  I thought it was going to be pretty good, but it was delicious!  I made if for a friend who just had a baby, and I had to stop myself from eating all!  Highly recommend for a chilly night.

I loved this soup. I agree the meatballs were too big. I ended up breaking it into smaller pieces so I could have a piece of turkey in every bite. I used italian bread crumbs and garlic salt for more flavorful meatballs.

Great recipe! It was filling but guilt-free. And even better on the second day!
