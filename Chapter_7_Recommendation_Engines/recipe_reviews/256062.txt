Sweet Potato & Kale Scrambled Eggs Haiku: "These eggs were okay. Really needed the salsa (or at least some salt." I made this recipe as directed with my only sub being frozen thawed kale for the fresh. We found ourselves adding more pepper along with a generous sprinkle of salt at the table and didn't really like that the salsa immediately cooled off the eggs upon being spooned on top. I should've let my jar of salsa come to room temp I suppose but overall a tasty healthy recipe that just needed a little more flavor.
