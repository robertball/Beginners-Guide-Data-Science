I served this with salmon puffs as well as melba toasts. I love the saltiness. It's similar to Taramosalata.

Stunning.  Very difficult to fault this receipe.  Add fresh chopped Chives and a dash of Paprika powder for color.  Note this receipe makes a lot of sauce!

Very good. I made some minor changes, I added chopped chives as well as dill. And I left out the creme fresh, since I didn't have time to go to the store. It was a hit at my Sweish themed party and I served it with Vesterbotten cheese pie. The bought the caviar at Ikea.

Great salmon/caviar recipe! Very colorful and bright. I almost took one star away for being a little too salty, but decided against it.

Loved it! I cut the recipe in half and it still made lots. I forgot the dill at the store so I just added a little bit of juice from a jar of dill pickles. Creative liberty, but it worked! Went fantastic over cedar planked salmon!
