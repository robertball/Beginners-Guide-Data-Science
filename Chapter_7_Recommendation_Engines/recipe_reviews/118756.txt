This is so simple yet it's extraordinarily delicious. How you can make a cake with a cup or more of butter turn out dry, but then make this coffee cake with a mere 2 T. of butter turn out this incredibly moist is still a mystery to me that perhaps a cook/science guru like Alton Brown could explain.  The cake is buttery rich and stick-to-your fork moist.  And then there's the decadent strawberry layer and the buttery, slightly crunchy topping!   Because it was so simple to throw together and required so few and humble ingredients I never expected something quite this good. I didn't change a thing nor will I next time.  I bake...a lot - way more than Hubs and I can or should eat.  So I bake and then I generally give it away.  Not this time.

Took a risk and this recipe paid off wonderfully ~ thanks to all you reviewers!  Made "pastry chef" in a small bistro ~ & the owner & I have differing food philosophies -- he wanting "box and mixes" for ease of prep ~ me a staunch "scratch" chef... Yet he signs the paycheck!  So what do I do?  I get a flat of strawberries ~ Make this recipe as written in a huge 12 X 18 X 2 1/2 inch deep baking pan ~ I quadrupled it ~ baked it off for closer to an hour I'd guess.....Let it cool overnite and took it to work for our new breakfast grand opening.  He dug in as did many of the patrons ~ found it excellent!  He took one bite and said, "Now this is what I'm talkin' about when I want a coffee cake!  Moist, delicious!  So this is a mix right?"  Well I just quickly threw it out there that it was a scratch bake....Awhile later he told me I could do all my baking from scratch and he'd buy all the special flour in the world that I would need for me to get in my groove!  THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH ~ We now have peace at the work place and some patrons sure to come back for more goodies in the future.  My details:  Took the suggestion to cut the strawberries in slices more on the thick side.....entirely covered the batter about one thick berry slice deep ~ had walnuts on hand so used those ~ baked till the top was no longer pale-pale but rather pale golden and the toothpick came out clean.  I wouldn't hesitate to sub out fresh sliced peaches or other berries.  Make with cofidence and enjoy :-) !!

I made this recipe with fresh strawberries this morning, and everyone loved it!  Only changes I made were substituting apple sauce for the melted butter in the batter and reducing the butter in the topping slightly.  I also doubled the recipe and baked 50 minutes in a 9x13 pan.  Will definately make again and with other fresh berries!  Delish!

Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Absolutely one of my new favorites.  I doubled the recipe for a 13 X 9 pan.  The cooking time for me was about 35 minutes.  For the topping I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I also used walnuts (what I had on hand).  Very moist and gooey.  The strawberries just melt in your mouth and in the cake.  I dusted the strawberries in flour before adding them to the top of the batter, and the strawberries did not fall to the bottom of the cake.  Tasted good out of the oven but so much better the next day.  Thank you for an outstanding recipe!!!!!!!

Mmmmmm yum! I thawed frozen whole unsweetened strawberries, cut them up (they were plenty sweet). I used the "strawberry juice in the bottom of the bag instead of milk (pretty pink batter), and then thought maybe the recipe WANTED milk, so I sprinkled a few (2 -3) tsp. powdered milk into the flour mixture. I did press some of the berries into the batter. Used brown sugar and more pecans maybe 1/3 c. butter in the topping. Even better as it sits.

I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 dish.. I cooked it about 30 minutes and it was just right. Great tasting, and very moist. I didn't double the topping and I still had enough.(I also didn't use the pecans) Great way to use up my strawberries that were about to go bad :)

As is, I think the recipe uses too much butter and sugar. I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and substituted the 2 tbsp called for in the batter with 2 tbsp applesauce. I also decreased the amount of butter in the topping to 3 tbsp.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  But I wanted something less "cakey", so I made another one, "pushing" some (about 1/2 or 3/4 cup) of the sliced strawberries into the batter before placing layering the rest of the sliced strawberries on top of the batter.  (I used a total of 2 or 2.5 cups of sliced strawberries.)  For the topping, I melted the butter first and mixed with the rest of the topping ingredients...then added another 1/2 cup pecans.  (I love it nutty!) I placed it in the fridge overnight because I wanted to bake it in the morning.  It turned out great!  It was very moist...almost "dessert-like".  I don't know how many calories are in this but it won't matter to strawberry-lovers!

I followed the recipe and it turned out so good. The strawberries melted in the middle and it was just really good. More strawberries, the better. Thank you for the recipe.

Wow the reviews weren't kidding, this was amazing! One change I made was to use 1/4 cup sour cream & 1/4 cup milk (I had to use up the sour cream and I know lots of coffee cake recipes use sour cream) Otherwise I may have used a little more strawberries than called for. I did have a bit of problems getting the topping to brown up. It's pretty pale still. Fresh out of the oven it was amazing- gooey but amazing.  This morning out of the fridge it was firmer and tasty. It's wonderful! Kind of like a strawberry shortcake and coffee cake mixed.

This is a fantastic recipe as written.  No changes are necessary.  It is moist, flavorful and smells delicious while baking!  I doubled the recipe, baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for about 45 minutes, let it cool, then put it in the refrigerator overnight.  The next morning, I put it in a 200 degree oven while I got dressed. Took it to work with me and served it warm with coffee in the break room.  Everyone loved it. Even some of the dieters went back for seconds! There were no leftovers. Thank you, Rose!

So good & so easy! 

The only thing different I did was add about 3/4 cup oatmeal to the topping to give it a little more crunch! Love it!

This crumb cake is absolutely amazing. It really is all about that out-of-this-world crumb topping. It almost doesn't matter what lies beneath as with every bite, all you taste is the buttery, crunchy deliciousness of the topping. This recipe would lend itself well to other fruit - blueberries, raspberries, peaches etc. and is so simple to put together that I think I will be referring back to it often. Be sure to make this just as written - it couldn't be made better.

Wonderful! I followed advice of others and used brown sugar for topping. I also doubled the strawberries and cut them into thick pieces, as recommended. I also added 1/4 cup of oatmeal to make the topping really crunchy.  My family loved the topping and said they wanted me to make this again!

REALLY good!  Amazingly rich & moist, with only 2 T. of butter!  (of course, I REALLY liked the topping, which had 1/2 stick of butter in that!)  I sliced the strawberries (& refrig) and mixed up all my dry ingredients the night before, so it only took 5 minutes to throw it all together & get it in the oven before breakfast!  Awesome!  I followed another reviewer's advice & increased to 2 cups of sliced strawberries & "pushed" the first layer of them into the batter, then topped with the remaining strawberries!  Wow!  Only wish I'd found this earlier in the season -- will make this often throughout the Summer!  (think I'll try it with other fruit too! . . . will let you know how it turns out!) ~ ! ~
UPDATE! UPDATE!!  I shared my Strawberry Coffee Cake (& this recipe) with a friend and she made it the next day with Blueberries & shared with me!  Delicious!!   (just remember to "fluff" about half of the blueberries with flour so that they don't all 'sink' to the bottom of the batter!)  Wonderful!!

18,300+ people have been waiting FAR too long to try this recipe!! (That's how many people have it saved to date...). This recipe is insanely easy and produces delicious results I look forward to sharing with my coworkers tomorrow. I'm surprised how little butter there is in the cake... it's so moist and flavorful. My only slight modification is using some streusel mixture I had leftover in the freezer, which was the same minus pecans. Excuse me while I go sneak another sliver...

Wow this was pretty tasty!  I resisted the urge to make little changes here and there (sub some brown sugar for white, add a splash of vanilla to the wet ingredients..) and was happy with the results, as were my guests. A refreshing dessert, not too heavy, so perfect for brunch.  Thanks! :)

OMG this is amazing! The only variation I made was to add a little vanilla to the batter, and about 1/3 cup of white chocolate (it melts right in!). The first one was so good, I made another one to give away. Try it!

This got 4 stars from me because the topping was a little too sugary and it needed more strawberries but with these adjustments it is very yummy and quick to make!

Wow, this was amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly and I was sure it wouldn't work (seem like not enough batter), but it was pefect.  I had to bake it a little longer, but I used a glass dish so I had the oven cooler at 350 degrees, so not sure if they made an impact on timing.  I think next time I will use a few more strawberries.  I brought this to a brunch and everyone raved.  I will definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled it and put it in a 9 x 13 pan.  I decreased the sugar in the cake to 3/4 of a cup (remember that I doubled the recipe).  FOR THE TOPPING- I did not put in pecans, used whole wheat flour instead of white, and decreased the sugar in half (did 1/2 cup) and used brown sugar instead of white.

I LOVE this recipe. I am a strawberry lover and this was so easy and tasty. I also mixed brown sugar and white sugar for my topping. Turned out beautifully and had a delicious strawberry favor.

Delicious!  I added a small amount (about 1/2 t) almond extract to the batter, used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar in the top layer. added about 1/4 t fresh grated nutmeg to topping and used walnuts instead of pecans.  I'm not sure any of these changes made a difference but the thing is delicious!  I can see it being good with other fresh fruits too.  A keeper!  Update:  Made for a second time today 6/23/2011 to use up some strawberries that had been in the frig too long.  This time I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't as good as the first time.  I'll stick with my changes.

Yum! Made this a day earlier than I needed it because of another obligation. We warmed it slightly in the microwave to eat and it was wonderful! The strawberries add moistness, which I often find lacking coffee cake. It did take more than 45 minutes to bake, which makes me think I could have used about half the butter. I'm going to cut it back next time to see if that helps. Finally, I added about 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture...we loved the hint of it throughout the cake. This is only an occasional treat for me, but it's definitely a keeper!

very tasty and smells fantastic while baking! 

I used 1/4 cup strawberry yogurt for half the milk, added a splash of vanilla,  cut 15 large strawberries in half and laid they out on top of the batter.

The batter was very sweet so I only used 1/4 cup of sugar in the topping, I used brown sugar instead of white in the topping, also used whole wheat flour for the topping since I omitted the nuts and it lends a nutty taste, added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the topping. 

Mine took 45 minutes to bake at 350.

This is a keeper. Glancing at the ingredients you may not expect much, but this is an awesome coffee cake. I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour and it is very light and amazingly fluffy. I baked mine in an 8' Calphalon square pan. I was able to let this cool, then I put it into the freezer for 45 minutes to finish cooling. I removed from the freezer and I was able to remove this from my pan by flipping it out. You can sprinkle some powdered sugar over the top if you wish or try piping vanilla glaze on it. I tried both. I am storing mine in the fridge. It tastes good when it is cold.

I made this today and it is absolutely wonderful - only change I made was to add some cinnamon to the mix as suggested and used brown sugar in the streusel mix instead of white...I used a round 8" pan because I don't have a square one and sure enough the filling ran over into the oven  ugh...so I put a foil lined pan underneath it and cooked it for about 10 minutes longer than suggested...the flavor of this coffee cake is really amazing!   :)   Picked 20 lbs. of strawberries last week so I'm making strawberry EVERYTHING!

Absolutely delicious! I have made this many times and it never fails to please the family. I add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter, and use brown sugar in the streusel topping. Yum!

This is delicious! If you want to cut out some of the butter in the topping, you can get away with 2 TBSP and it will still taste awesome.

I made this just as written, except I used Splenda baking mix instead of sugar, and omitted the pecans b/c hubby doesn't like.  Splendiferous!  We enjoyed for breakfast with scrambled eggs, and ate the leftovers ice cream for dessert later in the day.  Yummm!

The country I live has Cherries in season. So, since I had purchased a lot of cherries I figured I'd try that instead of the strawberries. I'm so glad I did it's really tasty! The only thing I added to this recipe was 1/4 tsp of Cinnamon to the Crumb topping. After tasting it I should have put more--perhaps 1/2 tsp to the batter and the 1/4-1/2 tsp to the crumb topping. This recipe is easy with ingredients most people have in their pantry. Give it a thumbs UP!

Every now and then (but not often) one finds a little jewel like this that is not loaded with butter. A simple batter that happens to turn out tasting like you spent hrs. on it with high fat content.   Grated there is butter in the topping, but if this is a problem just don't eat it.   Thanks for a great little gem which will be made often.

This was good, but nothing special.  I actually expected the crumbly topping to be a bit sweeter.  I used extra strawberries (about 2 cups) and used 1/4 C brown & 1/4 C white sugar for the topping.  I used 1/4 C splenda & 1/4 C sugar called for in the crust.

Excellent recipe!  I don't typically enjoy cooked strawberries, strawberry jam, etc.  I prefer raw strawberries.

However, this recipe was excellent!  I provided the recipe, and my nine year old made it for me. It turned out perfect!

WOW!  I hadn't expected to be nearly as impressed with this as I was!  I made a few minor changes, but none that would impact the recipe enough to change the review.  I used 1/4 cup sugar and an equivalent amount of stevia in place of the full 1/2 cup sugar, used hemp milk in place of cow's milk, and applesauce in place of the melted butter.  I also added a little cinammon and vanilla to the batter.  For the topping, I replaced the butter with Smart Balance Light and the pecans with oatmeal.  The results were light, moist and fluffy, and my husband LOVED it.  I've made two of these since Friday and will be baking another to bring to my office.  Thank you so much for the awesome (and easy!) recipe!

Very disappointed! I was so excited for a new strawberry recipe but this is not it! I only made two changes-used almonds instead of walnuts due to an allergy and added a tsp. of vanilla. My whole family thought it lacked flavor!!

easy and delicious!  i doubled my recipe and made it into muffins (although the doubled topping was a little much, maybe it should only be increased by 1.5) and added a bit of cinnamon to both the batter and the topping.  would definitely make this again.  also, i used strawberries that i had frozen.  i let them thaw first and then drained them and it worked perfectly.

Perfect!!  I had everything on hand for this one, and some strawberries that I needed to use up.  This whipped together quickly and turned out well above my expectations.  I made as directed and thought the pecans really added to the recipe.  This was great as dessert tonight and will be great with coffee in the morning.

This was a really easy cake to make which was great! The base is great Only Im Not Sure if I cooked it correctly because I feel the fruit left the bread a little mushy or undercooked because of the moisture. I added mexican cinnamon and vanilla to my batter and streusel. I also added peaches to strawberries. Overall very good I will try again. :)

I had some berries to use up, so we had this for breakfast today.   I baked it in a spring form pan,  used Splenda to reduce calories, and it worked just fine.  The texture was just like I'd expect for a coffee cake, it wasn't too sweet, the berries made it really moist, and I'll be making this again.

Excellent!  The only thing I did different (because I didn't have almonds) is substitute chopped peanuts instead.  The peanuts tasted amazing!  My husband loves coffee cakes & he said this was his favorite one ever!  Thanks!

I made this twice in three days, the first time I used blueberries, blackberries and raspberries, and the second time I used chopped up apple and some cranberries.  It was great both times, very moist and tasty.  I didn't have any strawberries on hand but I think it worked well with my substitutions!  A great recipe.

I doubled this for a 9x13 pan, added vanilla to the bottom batter and about 1 tablespoon of cinnamon to the topping (which I'm thankful I did, the topping was wonderful). The texture of the cake is a little different from most cakes, don't expect the same crumb you get from a boxed cake, it still tastes good though and, in my opinion, tastes NOTHING like a bisquick mix as another reviewer said. *EDIT* this was moist when it came out of the oven and for about 5-6 hours after but the next day the bottom cake part wasn't nearly as good, my husband and I both thought it tasted spongy.. he actually started calling it the strawberry sponge bread which described it pretty well I thought. If you make this id suggest eating it as soon as possible. We all loved the strawberry/topping part of this but I don't think id make this again unless I used another cake base recipe with the strawberries/topping. Thanks anyways though

I thought this turned out excellent! I would have liked to serve warm with vanilla bean ice cream but we were out.  It was perfect on its own.

Excellent recipe, most of all the ingredients you already have in your pantry. I had to use a little less crumb topping and a little less strawberries due to the size pan I had but it still came out amazing. The juice from the strawberries really locks in mositure to the cake!!

this was a wonderful cake, coming from someone who doesn't like or eat cake. in the picture looked quite short so i doubled the recipe for the batter but used a single recipe for the topping and baked it in a 9x9 square baking dish for 50 min to get a higher cake. for the batter i added 2 tsp of vanilla essence and used two cups of sliced strawberries but next time i will try adding more strawberries and pushing some into the batter. for the topping i added a 1/4 cup rolled oats, reduced the butter by 1 tbsp, reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and used all brown sugar. as one reviewer suggested, i added an extra 1/4 cup flour since i was reducing the sugar, but this made the topping a bit too thin so next time i will stick with the 1/2 cup of flour. 

we took this cake to a family dinner and everyone loved it. all in all a wonderful, versatile recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly, and the cook time was way off. I had to cook for at least 30-40 min longer than listed, and still the cake came out soggy and lacking flavor.

This was a great fresh coffee cake, I even prefer it over strawberry shortcake. The texture of the cake is wonderful, but I did think it was missing something. A bit of vanilla or almond extract, any little pop of flavoring will do the trick. Add those pecans, we thought they were so delicious toasted. I will use brown sugar or decrease the white sugar in the topping next time, the crunch with the pecans was great but the sweetness got in the way of the cake flavor.

I couldn't wait to make this!  I used real butter and doubled the recipe.  It was just "ok" nothing fabulous and will most likely not make it again.  My kids wouldn't even eat this!

YUM! I made it for company last night, and everyone loved it! Delicious with vanilla ice cream. :) I did cut down on the butter for the topping though--I probably used around 2 tbsp. and a little bit of oil. I also cut down on the sugar for the topping and used some flour instead. It tasted great!

Very good and so simple. I did use spenda for the cake batter and half splenda and dark brown sugar for the topping and it worked beautifully. My type II diabetic hubby loved it. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my cooking class and everyone absolutely loved it! Since strawberries are out of season, I substituted frozen blueberries. The first time I added wayyy too many blueberries and the cake took twice as long to cook! It still tasted fine, but it fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan. Also, I omitted the pecans because I couldn't make anything with nuts for my class. This recipe was soooo amazing and I will definitely make it again!

The only change I made was to use gluten free flour (Gluten Free Mama's Almond Blend).  Oh, and I had to use whole frozen berries that I defrosted slightly and then sliced.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  This was awesome with a steaming hot cup of coffee.  I am going to make this again and try it with blueberries or maybe even peaches.  But, it's awesome just the way it's written.

This was easy & delicious, as others have said. When I told my bf what was the ingredients, he complained that he wanted to have cinammon streudel coffee cake but i wanted to try something new, and since i had fresh strawberries in the fridge, i chose this recipe, after reading some reviews. I'm glad i made this, and for two of us, i personally luved 8x8 size! This is good, and i'll definitely make it again, with NO change to this recipe! :-)

I followed the recipe the first time so the review would be fair.It was very sweet and tasty when you eat a fork with topping, berries and cake all at once. The only change I made was to the nuts, I used slivered almonds because that's what I had on hand. It didn't take any more prep time than stated, if you are an organized baker. This will be a standard for me and next time I'll try rhubarb for the fruit.

I want to love this cake.  I made it twice.  The first time it was inedible. The second time it was almost as bad.  I followed the recipe and directions exactly.  I want the cake in the picure but mine was not to my liking.

Just one more fan of this great recipe.  Easy and wonderfully tasty.  Many thanks for adding it here for us. I thought the chopped pecans in the topping added such a great and unique touch and worked beautifully with the strawberries.

Pretty good. I made a low sugar version using sucralose and Splenda's brown sugar blend for the topping. It was a success.

Doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan and I'm  sure glad I did! Great stuff! I made it with white whole wheat flour to make it just a bit healthier.

I made this for my bible study group and it was a huge hit. The only change I made was to add cinnamon and I used 1/2 brown and white sugar in the crust. I will be making this again per requests last night !  Try this you will just love it !   Thanks for a great recipe.

This is just as easy and good as other reviewers say!  It was so delicate and moist - seemed like I had used a special cake flour.  Three of us ate the whole thing before it cooled.  Next time I will try to save some for the next day, since it is said to be even better then. Can't wait to try it with fresh peaches!

O M G! Absolutely AMAZING!!! I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar for the mix, and the same for the crumb topping. I made it in a 8" round pan. Baked 35 minutes. PERFECT! It was sooo amazing warm! Oh, and I also add 1 tsp cinnamon to the cake mix, and 3/4 tsp cinnamon to the crumb topping. Will def make again with different variations. Thank youuu for posting this recipe!!!

So awesome and so easy!!!  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9"x11" pan for 50 minutes.  I melted the butter for the topping and added a little brown sugar.  I also used 1 whole cup of chopped walnuts instead of 1/2 cup (in the doubled recipe) of pecans.  I definitely recommend this recipe!!!!

Very easy, really yummy.  I doubled the ingredients for a 9X13 pan, but used applesauce instead of butter for the cake--delicious!  For the topping, I doubled all ingredients but the butter (only used 3 Tbsp) and it still turned out wonderfully.  My company loved it!

This was VERY good.  If it didn't turn out for you, you did something wrong.  It was very easy to make.  I had left over strawberries & some blueberries so I mixed them.  I did have to bake a little longer than called for but my fruit may have been juicier since the fruit was frozen.  It is best served warm but just pop the left overs (if any is left!) into the microwave.  Will definitely make again.

Taste okay...nothing special. The bottom crust taste like a box mix (bisquick). The best part was was the strawberries and topping (I used 2 cups of strawberries and brown sugar vs white in topping). Reminds me of strawberry shortcake...probably would be good warmed with a scoop of ice cream on top.

Took a long time to bake.  I left the cake in for 45 minutes and it was done in the middle and a little too brown on the edges and bottom.  Other than that, this was delicious and the recipe is right just as is.  Thanks.

Very good!  I made this exactly as listed other than using sliced almonds for the nuts.   Super moist, nice strawberry flavor, and very pretty to serve.   Next time I will make a powdered sugar glaze to drizzle over the top as this cake was not very sweet on it's own and it would make it look pretty.

Sorry we did not care for the texture.  I make minor changes but they should not have affected texture - doubled recipe for a 9 x 13 pan, used frozen strawberries, and omitted the nuts.  Took 45 min to get a clean toothpick; flavor was just ok, but the texture was hard to get past.  Ended up adding a vanilla glaze which helped some.  Would not make again.  Sorry - it sounded so good.  My next effort will be to use the Best of the Best Blueberry Muffin recipe and see how it does as a coffee cake (with strawberries).  That recipe is fabulous in both taste and texture, and I use frozen blueberries often and they are still delicious.  Edit: I am updating this review and adding a star.  I think perhaps by doubling the recipe my ratio of strawberries to batter may have been too low.  We tried this again later and I served only from the middle of the cake where there are more strawberries and it was pretty good.  The outer edges do not have as many strawberries and there is more cake, and that cake texture/taste is not very good.  Weird.  But we are enjoying the center :)

This tasted good but I didn't get my desired outcome.  The topping disolved into the cake and the strawberries sunk to the bottom.  I used brown sugar instead of white in the topping and skipped the pecans.  It was good, but I definitely considered what my results were a cobbler.  I probably did something wrong.

This is hands-down one of the best dessert recipes I have ever tasted.  Perfect amount of crumb topping, and the flavors mixed PERFECTLY with fresh strawberries.  I can't say enough about this dish.  It was so good that I had to give it to my coworkers just so I would stop eating it! Needless to say, the dish came back empty.

Awesome.  We were looking for a true fruit dessert/cake.  Cut the topping in half.  Used old strawberries.  Added a few blueberries.  It will be good with any fruit.  May try to substitute yogurt for the butter in the cake.

This is very good and easy. It's a good way to use up those strawberries that are about to turn bad and fuzzy! I did add vanilla extract to the batter and omitted the nuts. Otherwise I followed the rest of the directions. I will definately make this again and will try using other berries too.

I didn't read the reviews before I made it or I probably would have done like others said and used brown sugar in the topping and cut down the butter.  It is pretty good but I think it could have been even better.

I don't know what everyone is carrying on about because this didn't turn out at all like the recipe states & I followed it exactly. The strawberries sank, the batter rose up and dissolved the topping. It was super soggy so I cooked it for an hour, which made it a bit more solid and edible, this the 2 stars. Disappointing.

Great way to use up my strawberries.  Tasty and moist cake. I did leave out the nuts due to an allergy, but nice flavor to this cake.  Thanks for the recipe.

I added cinnamon to the topping, great idea if you like the sweet smell and adds a nice little flavor as well.  Great recipe!

Fantastic cake that is quick, simple, and easy to put together. I added 1/2 cup of strawberries(and pushed them into the cake), 1 tsp vanilla extract, and mixed half & half white & half light brown sugar. I also substituted brown sugar in the topping and added 1 tsp. cinnamon. Simply delicious!!!

I have made this recipe twice in the last week! Super easy and delish! I used fresh raspberries instead of the strawberries.  Took it to a picnic at my in-laws and got rave reviews from everyone from 76 to 6!! Would definitely recommend =)

Made it for a breakfast meeting at work. It was gone immediately. I wish I had added more strawberries though. This is the easiest recipe ever! Not too sweet and great for gatherings. I refrigerated mine over night for work the next day and it was still great!

I made this cake based on the high ratings, but after making it, I feel that it was rather bland (even though I added Vanilla extract) and the texture is not what I expect of a coffee cake...or any cake for that matter.

Made this as muffins! I intended to make the recipe as listed, but had a weekend alone and just wanted a few of muffins to enjoy and take the rest to work to share. I used the base of this recipe cut in half (still used a whole egg) but added 1/4 t. almond and 1/2 t. vanilla extracts to the batter and folded in sliced raspberries, blackberries and whole blueberries to fill 6 muffin cups. Instead of pecans, I added cinnamon to the topping. Baked at 375 for 30 minutes. Fantastic treat for those who love berries. Thank you Rose for the original recipe.

Well I'm going to heap yet more praise on this great recipe. When I spooned the  batter in the pan I thought I would end up with a thin cake base. I caan't believe how much it rose nor how moist it is. I did leave the pecans out of the topping due to allergies. The strawberries in my garden are nearly at an end now, but I will definitely be saving it to use next year. Thanks for a real treasure Rose. Edit 06.30.11 I wanted to add that this freezes well. I made a second one the following day and froze it. I took a few slices out yesterday for some unexpected guests. The strawberry flavour is not quite so strong but it is still beautifully moist. Thanks again Rose.

Wonderful cake!  Only change I made was to double it for 13x9 cake.  I meant to take some reviewers' advise that doubling the topping made too much but got carried away and doubled it too.  I had more than 3 cups of strawberries I needed to use so after using most of the topping, I added another layer of strawberries and the rest of the topping.  It turned out great!! I agree with other reviews, the more strawberries, the better.

This was delicious coffee cake.  I needed to bake it about 5-10 min. more than the recipe states so that the strawberry layer wouldnt be too gooey.  I left the almonds out to make it a little lighter.  Next time I will add applesauce in place of the butter like some others did to make it lighter plus add a tbs. or two less butter in the topping.  I may also add in some oats in the topping next time as well as change the white sugar to brown in the topping.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I was nervous when I only saw one recipe for strawberry coffee cake, but now I know why.  It's so delicious it's the only one you will ever need! This is fabulous. I didn't add any pecans or walnuts and it was still very good. Will definitely make again only will double for 9x13 so there will be more to eat!!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used frozen strawberries, which I thawed. The topping seemed dry and powdery when I put it on the cake, but it baked up beautifully. My husband and son-in-law devoured almost 3/4 of the cake in about 15 minutes. I guess that speaks for itself.

I made this a few weeks ago when I was craving strawberries, and this recipe definitely fixed that craving. Everyone who had it said it was amazing.  There is a strong taste of baking powder (something I'm not usually a fan of), but that taste fades once the cake cools. The only thing I'll change when I make it again is to add more berries--at least another 1/2 C if not more to the cake itself, and 1 C refrigerated berries in a bit of sugar to spoon over the top. Fantastic recipe, and definitely better the next day. It's even delicious cold.

This recipe is great! I used blueberries (because that's all I had). The only thing I modified was I added a tsp of vanilla and before serving I drizzled cream cheese icing glaze over it. It tasted awesome and moist and looked really good too. I did have to bake an extra 4 to 5 min.

Excellent cake. Very easy to make. I didn't bother to measure out the 1 1/2 cups of sliced berries. Just slice them up until you have enough to satisfy your taste. I experiemented and served this cake plain, with whipped topping and vanilla ice cream. You can't lose!

Very good. First time I made it, my son and I each had a piece and then I left it on the counter to cool. My sweet toothed dog ate the rest. I could have killed her. I made a double batch in a nine by thirteen pan the second time, and this time, we made sure we got the whole thing.

I think this recipe has potential, but....first, I think that you need to have more filling than just the sliced strawberries listed. I think it would be good to have sliced strawberries and maybe strawberry preserves. As is, the cake is kinda bland. Also - I think there is way too much butter in the topping. All I could taste was the butter. I tried a different coffee cake that was just cinnamon, nuts, and brown sugar and that was waaaay better

I made this recipe for a Mother's day brunch and loved it! It was super easy to make and tasted delicious! I got many compliments on it. The topping is really sweet and I think you can decrease the amount of sugar and it would still taste great, however i made the recipe as stated. I will definitely make this again. My husband is already requesting I make it once a week!

I made this with 2 C of sliced fresh strawberries , omitted the nuts and added 1 tsp. vanilla and baked for 40 minutes and it turned out wonderful.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is amazing how delicious this cake is, considering that there are only 6 TBS of butter in the entire recipe.

I made this with blackberries and it was OUTSTANDING!  The only thing else I changed was I added about 3/4 teaspoon cardamom and a dash of mace.  Had a piece while it was still warm, then cut it up, put it on a plate and covered with foil, then threw it in the freezer.  Just micro defrost each piece for about one minute, then heat on high for 20 seconds or so.  Fantastic!

I prepared this recipe EXACTLY as the recipe calls, and it was really good! After reading other reviews, I used more strawberries and pushed them into the batter before sprinkling with the topping and baking. The only reason I'm not giving this recipe 5 stars is because the bottom cake layer is not as sweet as it maybe should have been. Next time I will add maybe another 1/4 cup of sugar to the batter recipe.

This recipe was a hit with my boyfriend!  I did make the following changes to it....  I used 12oz bag of frozen birdseye raspberries instead of strawberries.  I just layered the juice and raspberries, then topped with the topping.  I did as others did and doubled the recipe but not the topping or berries.  It is PERFECT, and so moist.  Like a desert cake.  I will be making this frequently!!!

One word, AMAZING--at least that is what my son-in-law stated and I'll have to agree.  This recipe is quick and super easy.  I would not change a thing.  I will make this again, and again, and again.  Thanks for posting it!

Really enjoyed this coffee cake.  The layer of strawberries just makes this outstanding.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  The only thing I might try next time is to put a few strawberry chunks in the batter, so that there is more than just the strawberry layer.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Man, was this good!! I followed the recipe exactly the first time and cut the berries in slices as another reviewer recommended. Second time I made it, I used applesauce instead of butter in the batter, and brown sugar for the topping, along with walnuts, which I had instead of pecans. Just the right touch of sweetness and moistness. I make this for my 92-year old mom who loves coffee cakes. I thought it was fabulous too! I'll try it again with other fresh berries too. Thanks Rose!

This has everything going for it--fast, easy, and absolutely delectable. It makes a very tender cake with just the right amount of sweetness. Like others, I found that it took longer to bake--35 minutes. The results were well worth the time!!

This is excellent.  It has a good balance of cake, fruit and topping.  Unlike some coffeecakes, it isn't a whole lot of cake with a little bit of fruit and topping.  I made the recipe as written except for using margarine in place of butter.

This cake turned out really good and got rave reviews from my family and friends:). The only problem was the topping it was just too crumbly and wouldn't come together and thats why i only gave the cake 4 stars. Without the topping it is a five star recipe all the way! the cake also tastes really good with vanilla ice cream or whip cream on top!

This was good.  We left out the nuts due to personal preference.  I think I would prefer to try layering at least some of the berries into the cake batter.

Yummy! I love how soft and moist this cake is! I did add a little vanilla extract and cinnamon just because I love those flavors, but I'm sure it would have been just as yummy with out my changes.

So easy and delicious!!  My 3 kids can't get enough of this.  I had some strawberries that were a little past their prime and this recipe was perfect for them.  I added a little brown sugar and oatmeal to the topping.  I'm sure this would be great when blueberries and peaches are in season too.  This will be a staple in my recipe box!  You should give this one a try!

Something went horribly wrong when I was baking (but I am baking challenged).... I think I used too much butter for the crumb topping.  And, for some reason, the bottom batter didn't do what it was supposed to...and it still was delicious.  it didn't last 24 hours in my house.  Yummy- just wish I could bake without a disaster ONE TIME :)

Very versatile.  We are moving and I was looking for a recipe to use up some of the bags of frozen strawberries I had.  I thawed and sliced whole frozen strawberries instead of fresh.  I also subbed marj for butter and 1 egg replacer equivalent for 1 egg and vanilla soy milk in place of milk.  (Egg and dairy allergies)  I halved the topping and baked as directed.  I know it is a lot of substituting but there is no avoiding it with allergies.  This cake turned out really well.  It was moist and flavorful.  I will definitely make it again.

Simple, tasty, and not too sweet. It's hard to find a recipe that uses fresh berries so I was glad to find this gem. The cake turned out nice and wasn't overly sweet, but was definitely a nice dessert for us. I topped this with some vanilla ice cream. Yum-O!

I just made this cake and had a couple of problems that I was hoping someone could help me with. I followed the recipe exactly, but my topping melted into the cake and did not come out looking like struesel at all. I also used the right size pan, but it was a very thin cake. I am still giving it 5 stars because I love strawberries and the taste was amazing.  Next time I think I will double the batter.  If anyone has suggestions to help with the topping I would appreciate it. This has happened to me before with other coffee cake recipes, so I must be doing something wrong.

Made a blueberry/lemon one, and a strawberry one... neither turned out, they both oozed out of my pans! Glad I put a cookie sheet underneath, just in case, but definitely a reminder why i usually use disposable pans when i 1st try a recipe. I tried a piece of the edge that did bake all the way through, also, and it was waaaayyyyy too super sweet. Will certainly not make again!

The best Strawberry cake! Made some for my family and they loved it!! NON LEFT even though the cake was not even cooled yet. This time I am making double and hopefully have some left over for dessert tonight! The recipe looked so simple and plain but the taste is anything but! I think that is the beauty of it. Quick, easy, simple but WOW so tasty. Thanks Rose

This recipe was very easy and quick to whip up. I prefer a little bit of a sweeter cake but I made it as a last minute dessert because my in-laws were over for dinner. They loved it, so I can't complain.

Delicious and husband-approved. This recipe is going into my regular rotation. I doubled all ingredients and baked in the 12x9 pan for about 45 minutes. Turned out gorgeous: moist and not too sweet. Can't wait to use freshly picked strawberries in the summer instead of the imported variety.

What a fantastic cake! Easy to make, quick and it tastes wonderful. I substituted applesauce for the butter in the batter and cut back on the sugar a little.

I didn't have enough strawberries, it still tastes great. Love the crunch on top.

Will definitely be making this again.

This just came out of the oven and I had a piece, it was so good I had to have a second one! I hope it still tastes as good tonight when my husband gets home. (I will warm it in the microwave.) I didn't change a thing in the recipe.

Made for my mother who doesn't like icing on cakes and loves coffee cakes. Everyone loved it especially the topping :) Now my sister wants one for her birthday...

Delicious! So simple a recipe, so easy to prepare. I added a little cinnamon to the topping, but made no other changes. The 8-inch square pan size was perfect for the four of us. I used a glass baking dish, so reduced the temperature to 360F and baked it for 35 minutes. Perfect!

Great recipe, but i think it works better if you mix the eggs and milk into the flour mixture , then add the melted butter last.  For the topping I did a mixture of half white sugar, half brown sugar and added some cinnamon and topped with a basic glace after the cake cooled.  I also doubled the recipe and put in a 9x12 pan.  Would work with any fruit.  Thank you for the recipe

Although I wasn't too sure I would like this since I'm not a huge "fruit in any cake" fan, but we all loved this coffee cake! We only have one little piece left so thanks for sharing your recipe!

I only rate the things I really love and this is a keeper! I made this for my mom and I today and we ended up eating almost half of it! I was really easy too! I only had a 9 inch pan, but it was fine. The flavor was amazing! LOVED IT!!!

Just like everyone says- it's moist and SO DELICIOUS! I love to bake so I tend to be critical of cakes and pies, but this one surprised me. The ingredients are simple but the result is amazing. My husband even asked "is this made from scratch?" because it's that unbelievable. I didn't change anything in the recipe except to double it and instead of trying to cut in hard butter to the topping I melted that as well- it's so much easier and the result is the same. Bon Appetite!

This was so Good, I can't wait to make it again and try different fruit. I loved the topping so next time I might double it. This is a must try, you can't go wrong! served it warm out of the oven and it was good, but the next day for breakfast it was even better! Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious!  The cake part was moist and we loved the layer of fresh strawberries.  I thought the topping went perfectly, although I forgot to add the pecans to it.

Good flavor, but texture is definitely more like a cobbler than coffee cake. I followed the directions exactly and cake was still gooey in center after 35 minutes. I keep a thermometer inside the oven, so I know the temp was correct. Cooked another 10 minutes, so not as gooey, but cake is too soft to cut into squares for serving. OK to serve and eat with a spoon. Taste was good; not overly sweet even with sugar topping.

WOW, this is excellent!  Made it for Bible study and people ate it until it was gone.  There was a trained chef in the group who said it was 'professional quality!"  Small changes:  I doubled it and put it in a 9x13,  used half brown sugar in the topping, and used walnuts instead of pecans.

This ALWAYS gets rave reviews and it is so simple to make!  zI first made it in the UK, so I add steel cut scottish oats for the topping to add some extra crunch and a touch of fiber!!  Also, sometimes I use whole wheat/oat flour which gives a more whole grain flavor.  Either way, it is a home run of a recipe!!

This was a great easy way to use up a bunch of strawberries that I had.  Could be served warm for a breakfast treat or warm it up again and add some ice cream for a quick dessert! Very yummy.  I did make a few small changes based on some of the reviews.  I just omitted the butter in the batter and doubled the batter to have it fit in a 9x13 pan.  I  didn't measure the strawberries I just put a layer on the top.  I also added 1t of almond extract to the batter before baking it and it turned out moist and yummy!

This was very good and very easy to make. My family loved it. I omitted the nuts (as my daughter is allergic) and baked it for 45 minutes.  Next time I will reduce the butter on the topping by 1 TBS.  Thanks for sharing this very easy recipe!

This was great.  When I made it a second time I added 6oz. of vanilla yogurt to the cake batter.  I also added a few extra strawberries.  I also had to bake it an extra 20 minutes.  But this is a great recipe and easy.

We love this cake. It’s extremely light and moist. I do add a splash of vanilla and in the crumb topping I add cinnamon and use half white half brown sugar.
It’s hard to stop eating it when it’s just out of the oven.

Great coffee cake ! I doubled the recipe and baked in 9x13 pan for 40 minutes. The only change to the recipe was adding little vanilla extract to the batter.

While the cake was good, the strawberries and topping stayed quite soggy and unappealing, to me anyway.  I even baked an extra 10 minutes, but the cake was getting pretty brown.  This is more like a fruit cobbler, to me, than a coffee cake.  I guess I'm used to a drier coffee cake.

Absolutely delicious.  Only change I made was to use brown sugar in the topping.  I used at least 2 cups of strawberries pushing some down in the batter.

I dont know what the issue with this coffee cake was but, after doubling the cooking time, I couldnt get it to cook from the top to middle. I know my oven is calibrated correctly. I started it at the baking temperature and time. Then realizing it was half cooked, I turned it down to 325 and baked it an additional 30 minutes. It still seemed undercooked, but the bottom was too browned. The flavor was okay, but it was super sweet. Going to figure out how to save this tommorrow.

This was pretty good however mine took about 45 minutes to bake.  I used a round nine inch cake pan and mine was a little too full, with the topping overflowing in the oven.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Rose Palsgrove!

Thanks, this was a great recipe!  The topping did not crumble like sugar crumble topping usually does . . . I think there was too much butter . . . but it tasted great after it came out of the oven so what do I know?

Very tasty and easy to make.  Was a bit sweet, I guess since the strawberries were sweet.  Tasted like having jam on top of the cake.

Tasty way to use up strawberries - easy and versatile! I made healthy subs - wheat flour for 1/2 AP flour, Splenda blend for the sugar, Smart Balance for butter. I also added 1/8 cup ground flaxseed meal to the cake, and 1/8 cup toasted wheat germ to the topping. Instead of adding the pecans to the topping, I sprinkle them on top so they can get toasted. Hubby and son said it was AWESOME - I was lucky to get any!

So easy. Followed the directions exactly and it came out awesome! I doubled the recipe and baked it in a casserole dish. The only thing I would recommend is adding more strawberries as they cook down quite a bit from the topping.

I made this as written, without the pecans.  I baked it in a large Longaberger pie plate.  The topping was too much - next time I'll make half the amount.  It ended up not browning (see my picture) and was kinda buttery on top.  Other than that, it was a good recipe.  It still tasted good - but just didnt look great.

This was excellent!  I was searching for a way to use up some strawberries and I love that I had the rest of the ingredients on hand.  I left out the nuts due to nut allergies in the family, but didn't miss them.  This got rave reviews and was so simple.  THANKS!!

Cake is soggy.  Crumble topping melted.  I might be able to serve it topped with a little powdered sugar.  This in NOT a keeper for me.

Super pleased with this recipe! i'm not much of a baker but my husband loves desserts so i'm working on it. This recipe was SO easy i was really surprised. I didn't have pecans, and i didn't substitute anything. Think next time i'll put in oats instead of pecans. I did reduce the sugar in the topping to 1/3 cup. Will definitely be making this again!

This is a really good recipe. I made it without strawberries (I am allergic) and substituted brown sugar (did not have white) and it was delicious. I added a little cinnamon and vanilla. I would love to try adding some diced apples to it, with a cup of hot cocoa.

Rich, cakey, sweet... this was fantastic!  I made it with frozen strawberries (chopped in my Ninja) & it came out perfect.  Great for a mid morning snack or after dinner treat.

I love this recipe for its simplicity. I love the fact that you can choose whatever fruit you want and it still turns out great. I have tried it with strawberry, blueberry, and banana so far. The only thing I change is the topping. I use an oat and nut topping. Delish!

For my husband and I this is a winner, but expect to have a dishwasher full of mixing bowls, spoons and measuring cups.  I don't think it's a recipe you make for breakfast first thing in the AM.  I'm reserving prep for the night before.

This was great! I've made it twice so far, both times I halved the sugar, used a little less butter in the topping, and pulsed some oats and walnuts in the food processor with the rest of the topping ingredients....also added some wheat bran in the crust. Was plenty sweet for us with only half the sugar, but I usually halve sugar in recipes so we're use to it. The first time I used only strawberries and it was awesome. The second time I wanted to use up some bananas so I used both strawberries and bananas...I'll stick with only strawberries for now on. Both my little ones love this coffee cake! Thanks for a great recipe that will be a staple in my house.

My husband & I LOVED THIS RECIPE. Thank you Rose.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe and it was just delicious.  Easy, easy, easy.  Next time, though, I would chop the strawberries for easier slicing of the cake.  Also, I prefer it served chilled.
I intend to make this with other types of berries and double the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan.

This was totally fabulous! I made everything just like shown but didn't have many strawberries so used what I had and added a cut up banana and some frozen blueberries that I rinsed to warm up a little first.  My boyfriend calls this a masterpiece and would like to have it every night.  Really so easy and so very good!

Simple, easy and good for when you have strawberries that are about to go bad.  Made two over the weekend and they were gone within 30 minutes.  Followed recipe verbatim, no need to mess with the ingredients. A new regular treat in our house!

This was very tasty.  The topping was a bit sugary.  I forgot to add the pecans after going out and buying them.  :)  I think I might use brown sugar or at least half brown sugar for the topping next time.  I did love it!

I only gave 4 stars since i changed a couple things but WE LOVE THIS. I added more strawberries, just cut up a whole bunch and layered them over the top of the batter. I also cut the sugar in the topping in half  and then added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. So 1/2 c sugar 1/2 c brown sugar. I also added Heath toffee pieces since we arent fond of to many nuts.

I had some strawberries that weren't sweet and this was a really good way to use them up. Had to eat it right away because it got a little soggy but with a small pan wasn't a problem.

This was a very delicious recipe for our weekend breakfast! I was teaching my son how to bake and was really excited of how good it turned out. We didn't change anything except maybe added a little more strawberries!

What a wonderful quick, easy, delicious cake! I was out of pecans so I used sliced almonds. I also had  extra strawberries so I made a strawberry sauce. Served it warm over  the warm cake. Delicious! Also so tasty once the cake cooled. A make again for sure!

Very easy coffeecake.  I think the strawberries didn't pack much of a flavor punch, very mild taste.  Would probably be better with raspberries.  It was a moist coffee cake with an overall sweet taste.

Very easy, very moist, and SO GOOD!  I ran out of butter so I used smart balance and it turned out great!  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter and 1/3 cup oatmeal to the topping.  Will make again.

This is a easy and good cake recipe considering the minimal amout of time and ingredients required. Used brown sugar for topping and omitted the pecans. Baked for about 35 mins. in springform pan.

This cake tasted better the next day. My German MIL really liked it as well, however, my kids didn't touch it. It wasn't too sweet and it was still moist with even only 2 tbsp of butter. The two minor changes that I did was that I tossed the strawberries with some sugar (they weren't naturally sweet) and I substituted oats for the pecans (I didn't have any). I will definitely make this again when I have guests over for coffee. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Rose!

Easy to make, tastes great but I would rather eat it cold rather than hot from the oven. Its just that strawberries are usually served cold. Hm...breakfast tomorrow! Just my preference. Note:I just tried it at room temp and its wonderful...thank you for the recipe! My husband loved it.

Very good recipe! It turned out moist and just the right amount of sweetness. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan, but I didn't double the topping and the result was perfect. Make this with fresh strawberries and you won't regret it.

DELICIOUS!!  I made this in an 8 1/2" springform pan, which worked out nicely.  I followed the recipe exactly as written (imagine that!) and it was wonderful!  Do serve this warm as the submitter suggests.  I re-warmed individual pieces in the microwave.  I’ll be making this one again!!

I thought this was just okay.  The topping was difficult for me because it never really seemed done.  The juice from the strawberries left the topping mushy.

It is the best coffee cake I've ever tried.  It's so moist and gets better as it sits, unlike most coffee cakes.  You can make this without the strawberries as well, with just the crumb topping.  I increase the batter by half for a thicker cake.  So good!

This is very easy to make and has a wonderful taste. I added some strawberry jelly to the batter for extra flavor. I will make this again with different fruits.

Good, simple recipe.  I didn't follow it to the letter, substituting here and there, but no note-worthy changes.  Was a great way to use my strawberries that'd become too mushy to eat by themselves.  Next time I will probably make more topping and save some for after it's baked-- to drizzle on top, cold.

I wasn't a fan. It was decent and my mom really liked it but the recipe seemed really simply but ended up being confusing when it got to the topping portion. My topping did not look like the one in the picture. In fact, it didn't even turn to any type of frosting.  I thought by topping it meant the frosting shown in the picture. I followed the recipe exactly how it's shown and it just didn't seem to turn out right.

This was great. I replaced the butter with applesauce, as another reviewer suggested, but other than that stuck with the recipe. I accidentally set the oven to the wrong temperature, but even after having to fiddle with it to get it all to bake this coffee cake was a bit hit!

in 40 years of baking and uncounted coffee cakes this is right up there with the best and it is so easy. Followed the recipe except for being too lazy to dig pecans out of the freezer and chop them. Even resisted the temptation to use brown sugar in the topping, just to see how it came out if followed exactly. Perfect coffee cake style cake, nice just slightly gooey layer of strawberries and yummy crumbly topping. I did mix up the cake part first and let it sit while I sliced strawberries and made crumbs - it did change the texture of the batter and might have something to do with keeping berries from sinking. I suspect this would be excellent with any berries or stone fruit and would also lend itself to adding spices/oatmeal/other types of nuts/etc to the topping, but it really doesn't need a thing.

Yummy and very easy to make.  Good quick way to use the abundance of fresh strawberries in our garden.  It is a bit gooey, versus a light fluffy coffee cake, but I liked it and will make again.  Delicious warm out of the oven!

This was delicious and simple to make! I did not consider this a cobbler as one other review stated. Moist cake on bottom with strawberries in the middle and a nice crumb topping. All of the ingredients I had on hand and my 2.5 yr old helped me assemble it. I made some changes as others suggested. For the topping I combined brown and white sugar to equal the 1/2 cup, omitted the pecans/nuts but added 1/4 rolled oats. 6/2/09  *Doubled and used blueberries with other adjustments as above and although it was good I preferred the strawberry version. 7/26/09

Yum!  Easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe as it was written, but I used frozen strawberries (all I had)--and it was still very good!  I can only imagine how it would taste using fresh strawberries.  Definitely a keeper.

Made it exactly according to the recipie. It was fast and easy to make and turned out great! I would probably use half white and half brown sugar in the topping next time but as it was my whole family really enjoyed it! I often find it hard to get good recipes using fresh strawberries and this was great, will make it again.

This is a super-easy recipe and a hit with the family. It was great for breakfast or dessert and if you leave out some of the sugar, not terribly unhealthy.

I liked it...  I made as directed and it turned out fine.  I think it's better not served warm though :o)

This is very good and it was so easy to make! My 2 year old & 4 year old loved it! :) Funny you should mention the Strawberry Festival...I live in Sidney, OH. :) We went to Fulton Farms yesterday and picked a gallon of strawberries! Now I'm trying to figure out what to do with them all. This morning Strawberry Coffee Cake. Tonight...Strawberry Pie! I'm sure they won't go to waste. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

This was delicious and different from the basic cinnamon coffee cake. I doubled the recipe, except strawberries and put it in a bundt pan. The only downfall to that was it took forever to bake!

Made this for an office breakfast club meeting and it was delicious. Made exactly as described and people really like the sweetness of the strawberries added to the coffee cake. I did make one addition though and used some of my extra strawberries with sugar to place over the cake before eating. Made the receipe even better. Thanks.

Extremely good.  I stirred some of the strawberries into the batter and added cinnamon to the topping. Great for breakfast or just a snack.
