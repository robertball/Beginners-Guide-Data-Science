I searched for this recipe after having it served to me at a dinner party last night. It was delicious & the one dish I HAD to get seconds of! But the salad I ate had canned(my guess)green beans added & the onions were green onions. Loved it! Feta made it all betta, as we say in our house. Can't wait to take to the lake on hot summer days! Thanks for making my search simple.

Couldn't be easier to "throw" this together for a nice quick salad.  I read the reviews though and saw that many felt it was bland as written...I used Garlic and Herb feta cheese and that provided enough seasoning for me.

Just had this for lunch, and it was awesome. I made it with red onion, and served it in a Bibb lettuce leaf. Pretty and delicious. Thanks!

AWESOME salad!
Holy moly!  I love love love this recipe!  It's so easy and quick, but more then that, it's delicious!
The first time I made it, I used sweet onions, and it was good, but after that I decided to try spring onions with it, and THAT is what made it perfect (for my taste, anyway)!
Oh, I also used Grape tomatoes the first time around, which was really yummy, too.
I just made it again, for the 3rd time, this time with the called-for Cherry tomatoes, and it, too, was amazing!
I just love finding such simple, easy-to-make recipes.  This is what makes cooking fun (for me anyway!)
Thanks for posting this recipe!  My taste buds and I are forever indebted to you! :)

I love this salad! It's delicious and so easy to make. The combination of ingedients makes it so flavorful.  And you cant's go wrong - you can adjust the quantitites anyway to suit your taste. I served this last night at a get-together with college friends and everyone loved it. I used diced feta cheese instead of crumbled and normal tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes. Thanks a lot for sharing!

This was the perfect side dish with our filet mignon.  Reminded me of the onions and tomatoes they serve at III Forks Steakhouse. I used sliced Campari tomatoes and green onions.  I also added a little balsamic vinegar, a few kalamata olive slices and a sprinkle of dried oregano and basil.  Would have used fresh if my husband hadn't of mowed it down. I will make this again.

This is a great salad. I made the salad exactly the way it was written and of course served immediately. I would make this recipe again and again.

Good mix but I too found it a little bland.  I used regular tomatoes (that might have been part of it) so I added salt (about a TBSP or two) and Garlic Powder.  Much better.

I made this for Valentine's dinner this year and did not find it to my liking.  It was too strongly tasting of onions and not much else.

What an incredibly simple and delicious salad!  It was a perfect starter to my Valentine's Day cheese ravioli (heart-shaped, of course) dinner.  Loads of flavor.  I didn't change any ingredient.  If anything, I probably just added a little more feta and lemon juice while using red onion.

Have a ton of cherry tomatoes from the garden. Great way to use them. Red onion gives it a nice zing.

I like this one very much. It's quick, easy, and healthy. I use it as a dip with some tortilla chips - the onions are too much for me when eaten plain.

This was good, but a bit bland.  I added a little garlic salt for taste and some black olives for color.

Very simple to make but it is definitely missing something.  I soaked the chopped onions in water (changed it 3 times) before draining and adding it to the mixture so that it's not stingy.  I guess one hour would have sufficed but I started cooking early and ended up soaking it in water for 3 hours.  I added 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar, some salt and an extra tablespoon of olive oil.  It tasted better to my liking but I think you need to make adjustments to your own tastes.  I served it on a cute plate on top of a whole red lettuce leaf.

This is truly an awesome recipe.  On great addition is avocadoes when in season.  Don't use too many onions,and stick with the red ones.  Try adding a bit of basil as well!  This is always a hit side dish.  Also tastes great as a brushetta topper!

Used a head of romaine for the lettuce and added cucumber.  I put in a whole small onion, but in the future, will put in half of that.  
The dressing is surprisingly tasty and fresh.  It also mixed very well with the feta cheese.

Very good and easy.  I think next time I will follow some of the suggestions and add fresh basil and probably salt and pepper.  A really nice change and something I will make often.  Thanks!
