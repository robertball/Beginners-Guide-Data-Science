OMG!!!  This pie is so-o-o good!!  I love chocolate!!! I cut the sugar to 1 cup, increased the cocoa to 5 Tablespoons. and added 3/4 cup of pecans!!   I also put strips of aluminum foil around the edges of the crust to keep them from getting brown too quick.  I baked it for 1 hour at 325 degrees.    No offense to anyone, but some of the expert cooks said they could not get the pie to set!  I followed the directions of another poster and it turned out perfect...no problem setting!!   This is what 'Lillithmaxium' said on Dec. 20, 2009: (The flavor is wonderful, however I think the lower reviews could be because some cooks are unaware of proper custard/homemade pudding-type pie preparation. The ingredients should include instructions for tempering the eggs).   I did exactly as Lillithmaxium instructed, and no problem setting!  Mix all ingredients (EXCEPT the eggs and pecans) and stir over medium heat until the chocolate is blended.  In a separate bowl stir the eggs, while stirring the eggs, slowly add 1/2 cup of the hot pie mixture to the eggs to gradually even the egg temperature.   Now pour the egg mixture into the remaining pie mixture, continue to stir, It starts getting thicker almost immediately.  Add the pecans, then pour into the pie shell.  I used deep dish.  Let the pie set to cool for about 1 hour before cutting.  I hope I explained this where it made sense.  I hope some of the other cooks will try this wonderful pie again...it's really simple and sets perfectly!

Eww, eww, eww. I had such high hopes for this pie. I followed the recipe exactly & it was inedible. The pie filling was so greasy & the pie would not set. You can even see the greasiness in the photos! Sad. If I attempt to make this again I will omit the 1/4c of melted butter. Just remembering my first bite makes me shudder. I feel a little out of place because everyone just raved about this pie in the reviews. I never leave baaad reviews, but I just needed to say something.

I have been making this exact recipe for years.  Here is a great tip my grandmother taught me:  First mix the sugar and cocoa together very well first.  Second, don't melt your butter completely.  That is why some are coming up with runny pies.  The butter needs to still have some "chunkyness" to it.  Hope this helps!  Mine comes out great most of the time, although sometimes it cracks.  I ususally bake it between 40 and 45 minutes.  And then like others suggested leave it in the oven with temperature off for 10-15 minutes with door cracked.  Love this recipe!

I found this recipe after a failed attempt at another Chess pie!! After reading recommendations from others, my alterations were as follows:
I poked holes in the crust, covered the sides with aluminum foil to keep them from burning, and sprinkled a little coarse sea salt over the bottom. I used only 1 cup of sugar, and 3 1/2 heaping tbls cocoa powder, soft butter (not melted). I slightly beat my eggs in a glass bowl and set them aside. In a seperate bowl, I mixed my sugar and cocoa powder. I then added the milk, and blended with a hand mixer. I next added my butter and vanilla and mixed A LOT!!! I added my eggs at the end and because so many people commented about having problems with the pie rising, I added approximately 1 tbsp of self-rising flour at the very end. I mixed a little more and then poured the mixture over my crust. I baked on 325 for 1 hour. I then turned off the oven, left the pie inside, but opened the door for another 30 minutes. When I took the pie out I dusted it with confectioners sugar. It turned out fabulously!!! I am not a fan of most things that are very chocolately, but this pie was perfect!

Classic, simple ingredients, easy, scrumptious. Never had I wanted vanilla ice cream more than last night to have with my warm chocolate pie..It took me 10 minutes to whip together and 50 agonizing minutes of waiting for it to finish cooking. I actually did 3 heaping tablespoons of cocoa to intensify the chocolate flavor and boy was it good; also used a regular, not deep dish pre-made pie crust but next time think I will try doubling the recipe for a deep dish crust for a thicker pie or even using mini/individual pie crusts for parties. 50 minutes was perfect cooking time, just so you know, the pie will still have a slight jiggle to it as it comes out of the oven but don't worry it sets up even more when cooling. I'm guessing because of the butter, the bottom crust was almost caramelized, a nice contrast from the creaminess of the filling; even the top had a thin layer of crunch. The pie is sweet so be prepared..ice cream or whipped cream would definitely cut the sweetness and be a perfect compliment to this dessert. I loved this and can't wait to make it for friends.

I have been playing around with the recipe (after the first attempt was not so great) and found that it is better with 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, and 1 cup of sugar. Also, bake at 350 for 1 hr 15 min on the bottom rack, and let cool a few hours before cutting. This pie is sooo easy and delicious with the recipe modifications!

This is a classic Southern, old fashioned dessert.  The key, in my opinion, is to mix it long enough (at least 5 minutes).  I just let my Kitchen Aid do the mixing while I prep the crust.  I also bake a little longer, 50-55 minutes.  And, finally, after it's completely cooled, I put it in the fridge to chill.  My boys love this pie, and my husband thinks I could sell it.  Yum!

Very good. Reminiscent of a wonderful chocolate chess pie I used to get at a bakery in Graham, North Carolina. Very rich and nice for the Holidays in place of cheesecake.

Made it for the first time Thanksgiving 2006 and it was a hit! Was told I must make this every year. It was so easy to make. I found it a little too sweet so I cut back on the sugar by about a half a cup.  It just made the chocolate flavor pop.  Delicious!

EXCELLENT!  I am from North Carolina  and this pie is a staple at almost every church and family gathering. This is the same recipe my Family has been making for several generations. Southerner's love their desserts sweet.. and this recipe is a classic example of that.  Classic Chess pie is a soft-set pie. Very smooth, rich and SWEET.  For those that prefer a "firmer" pie you can find recipes that call for a touch of flour. I love this pie - it is my absolute favorite and this recipe in my opinion is spot on!

we made this pie because we were looking for something similar to Golden Corral's mini chess tarts. it was a great pie! we spread a thin layer of Nutella on the bottom of the pie crust, also, but that was the only change we made to the recipie. well, also we had to bake it for an hour and a half for it to rise and thicken! i would use a little less sugar and more cocoa in the future, or maybe a bit of flour, but not because of the flavor, because the texture was a little unpleasantly gritty...but it TASTES wonderful! not sure why we had to cook it for so long...

I made this exactly as written and the pie turned out great.  It was an easy recipe and it had that wonderful crunchy layer on top with the smooth creamy center.  It was a perfect for an easy chocolate pie fix!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

My new favorite chocolate pie! Ingredients are always in the cabinet and it couldn't be any easier to make. Our family likes it better than cream pie with meringue. One suggestion though, beat it for a while so the sugar disolves pretty good. This makes a difference in the smoothness of the filling. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I had to alter it...but it is delicious.  I added about 1 1/2 Tbsp cornstarch to the sugar/cocoa mixture, and had to bake it a full 1 1/2 hours.  Perfect pie.  When doing this it set up just right, and tasted heavenly.

I made the pie the same way the "most helpful positive review" suggested - cutting back sugar to 1 cup and increasing cocoa to 5 tbs. I followed all the other directions as stated in the recipe, and it was REALLY great! It was a hit at our family's Memorial Day cookout. I let it chill in the fridge after baking to make sure the texture was correct. Delicious, and one I'll definitely make again.

My husband, a true chocaholic, said this was the best chocolate pie he'd ever eaten.  The pie disappeared in 2 days, and I had to make another one.  This will definitely become a regular dessert in our house!

I read a lot of the feedback and tried to make it according to what I read.  So I only used one cup of sugar per pie and three heaping tablespoons of cocoa per pie.  I added one can of evaporated milk per pie and realized later they were 12 oz cans not 5 oz.  The pies were already nearly done by the time I figured it out so it was too late to do anything about it.  They turned out AWESOME!  Set up really nice, tasted wonderful!  They turned out good enough that I think I will make it the same way next time.  I'm actually wondering if some of the folks who have had issues with it not setting would be better served adding more evap milk?

My family's favorite pie!  It is so easy and foolproof.  I follow the recipe exactly:  whisk the sugar and cocoa powder (I use Hershey's Special Dark or Ghiardelli), and beat with whisk attachment, on slow/med speed with the kitchen aide until they are really well mixed.  Add everything else, one at a time...with the butter last so it has a chance to cool down from being melted.  Then I just let it mix.  And mix, and mix, while I get the crust in the pie pan.  You can't overmix this like you can a cake or a custard.  Bake for the 45 min called for then cool completely.  One word of warning:  the top of the pie LOOKS like the top of brownies:  and as it cools the top will crack (mostly around the edges) and sink a bit...so it is not the most attractive looking pie.  I get around this by covering the entire pie with whipped cream (homemade is good because you can control the sweetness...the pie is VERY rich).  Drizzle some chocolate syrup across the top and sit back and soak up the compliments!  Thanks for sharing!!

Like others, we cut the sugar to 1c and used 5 tbsp of Ghiradelli cocoa powder.  Very good with ice cream - tasted like a brownie!

This pie is the classic southern dish - I love it. I did as several reviewers suggested and cut the sugar to one cup, used heaping tablespoons of cocoa powder, and baked it 52 minutes. I read one negative review that the pie is greasy - I can't figure out HOW it could be greasy unless they messed up and put in too much butter. It's rich, for certain… Thanks for the great recipe!

Super yummy! I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, and increased the cocoa powder to about 12 tbsp or 50g (I know, it sounds crazy, but it was REALLY good)  Very easy recipe to follow, and everyone thought it was great! Will definitely make again!

Mmmm...delicious. I made this as a way to use up half a can of evaporated milk I had leftover from making the Honey Wheat Bread (also on this site)! It was super-simple and surprisingly sophisticated. I made a bunch of changes that I think helped a lot:  -Cut sugar to 3/4 cup. -Used about 5 tablespoons of cocoa. -Used 3 eggs. -Substituted applesauce for butter (healthy, and you can't even tell)! -Added a few shakes of all-purpose flour to make sure it'd set (some of the previous comments scared me). -Added a handful of chocolate chips - love that melted and re-solidified flavor. -Didn't use a pie crust - that's right, I put it in a casserole dish (didn't want the extra pie crust calories) and it tasted great!.   Next time, I'll make these in individual ramekins for a dinner party. They're SO easy. Even my husband, who is not a big chocolate person, raved about this - it tastes like a flourless chocolate cake or a chocolate mousse with some flour added.

This pie was so good, so rich, and so easy!  Only make it if you really like chocolate.  Great with ice cream or cool whip.

This pie was a disaster to start, not because it was a bad recipe but because of errors i was making. I spilled the pie in the oven, went to get a cloth to clean it up from the sink, and i cut my finger on my butcher knife!!  Needless to say i was very frustrated.  I will say though, this pie was sooooooo delicious once i got through all the crisis. My company devoured it and i ate a piece in the middle of the night!

I looked at the top-most review for this pie, which basically said nothing productive other than "EWWWWWWW."  So, even with a 4.5/5 rating it worried me, but it looks like my worries were for naught!  I decided to attempt this pie for my mother's birthday- she LOVES chocolate chess- and having never made one before, I relied on AR to aid me.  The result?  My husband turned to me after taking his first bite and told me "this is probably the best pie you've ever made."  And he WANTED to eat more of it, and my husband doesn't eat sweets.  Ever.  My mother also enjoyed it- as did I- and it's something I plan to make over and over again.  It's decadent- quite rich- and tastes heavenly topped with whipped cream and a small drizzle of chocolate syrup.  Amazing, amazing, AMAZING!

I went ahead and tried this... at 45 minutes, you have a top crust, but underneath is just tasty chocolate syrup that does NOT set even after cooling. This recipe needs: a) about 30 more minutes OR b) 2 more eggs OR c) about 1/4 cup flour.

This pie was really yummy! althoguh, in my excitement of making a chocolate pie from scratch I misread the chocolate ingredient part, and instead of 3 Tablespoons of cocoa powder, I put a whole lot more. Like 1/3 cup of cocoa powder. Thank God, I love chocolate! It made a very rich chocolate chess pie. And my son says it's Goooooooooood! And yeppers I'm with him on that one. Thank you for the recipe. Definately this one goes into my keepers recipe box.

I have been making this pie for 15 years but my recipe calls for 1/8 teaspoon of salt. The SECRET for this pie is to cook it at 325 degrees for 1 hour and I use metal pie crust protector . I put it on the pie after 45 minutes to keep my crust from burning. This pie is so smooth and so decadent. it is my fave and you cannot have it without a big scoop of whip cream/cool whip. YUMMY !!!

I dare not be the 1st to give this wonderful pie less than 5 stars so no need to worry.  I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and even with all the pies to choose from this one was the hit.  It is only 2 days after Thanksgiving and I'm making it again.

Thanks for a great one, I highly recommend it.  5 stars - Ease & 5 stars - taste.

Super easy pie! 

First I combined the sugar and cocoa (I used about 1c sugar and 3 heaping tbsp cocoa). After that was well mixed, I slightly melted my butter and added my evaporated milk/vanilla to that mixture. I used a hand mixer to mix the wet ingredients with the dry thoroughly. After this, I added my two eggs and mixed with the hand mixer for about 2-3 min. I sprinkled a bit of coarse sea salt on the bottom of my pie crust and poured the chocolate pie mixture in. Baked at 360F for about 50min and let it cool with the door cracked for about 15min. 

Turned out beautifully and had no issue with it rising or setting! This is my go-to recipe for a easy 15 min prep pie.

I was rather hesitant about the filling because it was extremely runny (I followed the recipe to a "T"). However, I added an entire small bag (7oz I think) of shredded coconut to the filling. I used aluminum foil to cover the pie crust to prevent it from burning, and it turned out fantastic! It tastes like a Mounds candy bar. Absolutely DELICIOUS! (:

I tried this recipe tonight, and I admit to worrying about the amount of butter due to a one-star review. I added the amount of butter indicated in the recipe, and although I added one extra Tbsp of cocoa due to my son's preference for very dark chocolate flavor, I followed the rest of the recipe to a T and the pie came out PERFECT. It's not oily or greasy so I'm not sure what happened with the other reviewer's pie. It is important to beat the egg into the sugar and cocoa mixture separately from the other wet ingredients, and as another reviewer said, it should be mixed for awhile (longer than we're used to), so maybe that had something to do with it. The top of this pie was crispy and the middle was gooey, just like it was supposed to be. It could not have been an easier recipe and it could not have come out any better. Thanks for sharing!

Turned out so good!  The top is slightly crusty/chewy (like a brownie) with a softer inside.  This pie is what I hoped every lava cake would be.  Adjustments/Notes:  I used an organic whole grain pie crust and it cuts down the sweet just right.  Like other reviewers, used only 1 c. white sugar and 5 tbs. of cocoa.  Mixed the sugar, cocoa, butter, milk and vanilla over stove and then tempered the eggs.  YUM!

This was an excellent pie.  The only thing I would do different in the future is cut down a bit on the sugar.  I have a major sweet tooth, but this was just a tad over the top for me... still, it was delicious!  Also, I had to cook it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated.  The middle was still quite "jiggly" after 45 minutes - 10 extra and it was perfect.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe made a delicious pie.  My guest ate a bite and said "Mmmmm", then ate another bite and repeated himself.  
I doubled the recipe, baked it in a 10" pie pan and browned about 2-3 cups of minature  marshmallows on top of it.  The word of caution is to make sure to bake the pie until it is "set" and put a cookie sheet under it to catch any marshmallow drippings.

This pie tastes a lot like a chocolate pudding pie, except you don't have to cook the pudding on the stove. It's easy, tasty, fast, and using ingredients you always have on hands... What more to expect? The top cracks as the pie cools, but I don't think it is a problem.

This was so very delicious!  I had to give some away to keep from eating it.  It does need to cool completely so you can cut it - it is worth the wait.

Tastes best with homemade graham cracker crust: 
Mix together 1/3 c sugar and 1.5 c mashed up graham crackers (finely ground). Then mix 6 Tablespoons melted butter and press into GREASED pie pan (make sure you grease it really well). Refrigerate for at least an hour before adding pie filling.

Pie didn't set in the 45 minute time as recipe indicated so I read a few reviews and some of the more experienced cooks indicated that there should have been a couple of steps included about heating part of the mixture...too late. Mine was already in the oven and soupy at 45 minutes. I had already turned the temperature down to 325, then to 300.  It ended up taking 120 minutes; but it was absolutely delicious.  And I used a graham cracker crust. Next time I will boil on stove top prior to placing it in the oven.  I'm glad I wasn't crunched for time. Please list all steps. Even us lesser experienced cooks are not dumb-we can follow a recipe. Pie is delicious.

This has become a favorite in my house! I have combined all of the suggestions from other reviews and come up with the following "tweaks" to complete perfection for our tastes. A couple of noteworthy thoughts before proceeding:

*Do NOT double this recipe to try to make a deep-dish pie. I did this and the pie simply will not set unless it bakes for hours! Then the texture is just not good and the crust will be ruined. The recipe is perfect for a regular 9 inch dish. If you need more servings, make more pies, not a deep-dish! 

*Be certain not to melt butter completely. It needs to be "chunky" when mixing into the sugars. 

*Slightly beat the eggs and add to the mixture LAST. I always use extra large or jumbo sized eggs. The size of the eggs, especially when baking, will often make all the difference in consistency and moistness. 

*Mix at LEAST 5 minutes. You cannot over-mix this recipe, so turn on your Kitchenaid with paddle attachment and blend away while you prepare the crusts! It is crucial to mix long enough! 

*To make a chocolate pecan pie, which is amazing, add 1/2-3/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans to mixture, then cover the top with whole pecans (to your preference as to "nuttiness" and presentation). This variation is to die for!

*I use the "No Fail Pie Crust" from this site, if making everything from scratch. It is fantastic and compliments any pie! 

*Be sure to cover the edges of your crust during the final phase of baking (the last 15-30 mins) to prevent over bak

Just made this recipe and it is way off.  Check with what other folks have made and follow their suggestions. I would bake it at 375 and use less butter. Also it needs way more chocolate and less sugar.

I took the advice of most reviewers and added extra cocoa, but followed everything else.  It was a *huge* hit with the family.  I was informed that this was going to replace birthday cake at future parties.  Simple vintage recipes are often the best.

I made this with 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup Splenda, 1/4 cup cocoa, and unsweetened almond milk (I have a milk allergy) instead of regular. It came out awesome!! Set perfectly, didn't crack, and tastes amazing.

Delicious pie!  I had this pie from a local restaurant recently and have been craving it ever since and had to make it myself.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it's too sweet for me so I'll reduce the sugar next time.  I used a deep dish pie shell and the filling rose during baking and filled it to the top.  I had to bake mine an extra 10 minutes for it to be set.  There's no need to cook this mixture on the stove top first to get it to thicken and set.  It sets in the oven and if still jiggly you need to cook it longer.  Each oven is different and mine needed 10 additional minutes.  Great recipe that couldn't be easier with ingredients I always have on hand.  It tastes like an under cooked brownie and is terrific with vanilla ice cream.

Wonderfully easy and tasty! I didn't have evaporated milk so I added 1 oz dry milk to 4 oz C skim milk and it was great.  And I used the easy recipe where you just put the flour and the oil in the pie pan and press it in the pan.

I had a little trouble getting it to set. Next time I am going to do as one review I read suggested and heat the mixture, except the eggs. Then stir half a cup of hot mixture into the eggs as you are beating them, then add back in to the pie mixture. I am also going to try placing strips of aluminum foil around the edges of the crust and go with a deep dish crust. Delicious flavor! The gooeyness doesn't actually bother me, but I think the rest of the family would prefer it to be more set in the middle. I also decrease the oven temp by 25 degrees after about 10 minutes and add about 5 min to total cooking time.

Very good pie.  Reminds me of my moms recipe.  The top of this pie always cracks when I cut it though... I think I will stir with a spoon next time to produce less air in the batter and bake closer to the bottom of the oven.  Cracked top or not... my guests always reach for seconds of this classic southern dessert!

The perfect chocolate chess pie!  With chess pie it's important that you follow the order of the ingredients  and only mix until blended. You can decrease the sugar in this recipe by 1/4 cup and use heaping spoons of cocoa for a less sweet and more chocolaty pie. If you double the recipe decrease sugar to 2 1/2 cups total.

I added a bit of cornstarch and that seemed to do the trick of getting it to set, plus letting it cool in the fridge.  But such long cooking time burnt my pie crust a bit :(

Definately need to let this cool before slicing. It will come out gooey, but it will firm up and oh the end product is SOOOOOOO good. Excellent , delicious, family loved it. My grandaughter said to give it a 100!

Holy chocolate!  It's good!  I've made it according to the recipe, and also made it with water and buttermilk powder in place of evaporated milk and margarine in place of butter.  It's great with the "Best Ever Pie Crust"

I have been looking for this recipe after I had this pie at our favorite buffet style resturant. This is so very good and chocolately! I baked it for 50 mins and the center was still jiggly. The trick to this pie is to let it cool COMPLETELY! It will set after it cools down. It is very good.. This will be a staple on my menu from now on! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Flour is the key, people!  If the texture is too gelatinous for you (like it was for me), add a few tablespoons of flour.  It took me 4 times to discover this.  I am sure a young child may like this the way it is but for a more sophisticated pallet, I suggest using flour to get a more cake-like texture.

I made this just like the recipe suggested and it never set!  I was disappointed since I was so anxious to try it.  I even cooked it longer and it still did not set.  Now the taste of this pie was awesome!!!!  So, the taste portion of this gets 5 stars.  I will maybe add some kind of thickener and play with it some more. I am determined to get this pie to come out right.

I wasn't familiar with "chess" pie when I decided to make this.  I give this pie five stars for simplicity, but three stars for appearance and taste.  I cooked it until the center was no longer runny, but after I took it out of the oven, the top cracked in several places and looked  flat and grayish-brown.  The taste was definately better than a regular instant pudding pie. The texture was something between a chocolate custard and a gooey brownie.

I’ve been thinking of Black Forest Cake all year and decided that a Black Forest Pie would be tasty. So, using this Chocolate Chess Pie in a deep dish, I heated a can of cherry pie filling during the baking time, and after cooling the pie, poured the Cherry filling on top. After it cooled, I added decorative icing stars all around the perimeter.

Made exactley per stated directions.  The top was crunchy, the filling set, taste was very good.  So why three stars?  I don't know why but the texture of the filling sans the crusty top was grainy.  I tasted the filling before putting in the pie shell and no texture was present.  I've never had chess pie before so I don't know if that is the intended texture.  But  it was not appealling - at least to me.  But the flavor was wonderful.  I don't know if I'll try again.

Mine turned out like a brownie with a crust, but hey, no complaints here. It was easy to make and set up well after 50 mins in a 350-degree (convection) oven. I think it could have been fine with even less time. I substituted 1 can of sweetened condensed milk for the evaporated milk and sugar, so it wasn’t too sweet. I also upped the cocoa to 4 Tbps and added about a teaspoon of instant coffee powder to further enhance the chocolate flavor.

I love this recipe! its super easy, follow the instructions and let it set all the way. Do a toothpick test and voila! I've been obsessed with this pie since my aunt gave it to us from a bakery around Oxford NC. My mother and I searched high and low for a recipe and we like this one.

Ok, I have now made this three times, and it is finally great!  The three star review is for the recipe as is--way to sweet and shallow.  I added 3 more ounces of evaporated milk, cut the sugar to 1 cup, and used a slightly smaller pie pan.  It's starting to taste great!  It's very important to sieve the custard when pouring into the shell.  Also, to avoid overcooking, watch it like a hawk, and remove  once it's domed, don't let it sink!

Delicious- even when I was too lazy to top with whipped cream. I adjusted the sugar and cocoa amounts to suggested 1 cup of sugar and 5 TBS  of cocoa. I would have liked a little more crispiness on the top of the pie. I am hoping to figure that out next time!

We followed this recipe to the letter.  It turned out perfectly.  It was very sweet so I can see why some people wanted to cut back on the sugar, but it was fine for my sweet tooth family.

THIS pie is everything!  Years ago I stoppied using margarine BUT I had an amazing chocolate chess pie recipe that did NOT fare well with real butter, so off to AllRecipes I went to find a real butter chocolate chess pie recipe.  After researching several, I decided to settle on this one and it’s much better than my old funky margarine recipe.  I’v made this pi at least 10 times & it never disappoints

I had never made a chess pie until today and now I'm like, "Where have you been all my life?!" So good! After reading a lot of reviews I cut the amount of sugar to 1 cup and the butter to 2 Tbsp. it was PERFECT!

Excellent easy pie.  I rarely bake because I am not very good at it.  I follow the suggestions of another reviewer and leave butter chunky before beating in.  I reduced sugar to 1 cup, and my pie  is always yummy.  Sometimes it cracks but who cares?  Still delicious and EASY.

I give this recipe 3 out of 5 stars because the first time I cooked it the pie was amazing and didn't make it more than a few hours before the empty pie tin was left behind. The second and third times I tried replicating the original however left much to be desired.  Each subsequent time I attempted to execute this dish the pie WOULD NOT SET.  I tried everything I could think of and the only thing that would settle was the exposed top of the pie.  The final time I made the pie I attempted to alter the baking temp lightly but all that did was burn the top and leave the innermost center looking like chocolate pudding.  I'm at a total loss at this point because I am doing everything I did the first go around and nothing is turning out the same.

This was really delicious! Everyone liked it and no one commented that it was too sweet.  I had to bake it for 10 minutes longer to get it to set up well,but that was the only change I made from the recipe.  Good recipe for a fairly inexperienced baker like myself!

It was okay! It smelled good when making it, but it had a weird taste. Maybe it was the Dutch processed cocoa. Easy recipe to make but probably would try another one.

I made this the night before Thanksgiving and put it in the fridge after it cooled completely.   It was totally scrumptious! 

I used a deep dish pie crust and would like to modify the amounts to fill up a deep dish for next time but that will be some trial and error.  I'm a huge fan of the crust too so the extra crust using the deep dish pie crust was still good.

I did need to cook this a little longer than stated.

Delicious, simple pie. I made it in a Pillsbury frozen pie crust. I pre-baked the pie shell for 10 mins at 350 degrees to ensure the bottom of the crust was cooked. Used 1 1/4 c sugar and 3 1/2 T cocoa and a dash of salt. Baked 1 hr (my oven cooks slow). Might have over cooked it because the filling got a few cracks in it but the crust still needed to brown-up. Delicious pie. Like a set pudding under a slightly crusty crust on top. Cooled 4 hrs on counter until I cut it. Cut perfectly. Wonderful as it or maybe a dollop of fresh whipped cream. Simple and delicious!!!

I will make this again. The pie tastes great! I will use 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup with sweetened cocoa instead of unsweetened cocoa. I baked it slowly and not rush it. I mixed cocoa with sugar in saucepan with butter and milk and rest of the ingredients. The pie constantly hold and not runny. I didn't melt the butter, it was room at temperature (soft) to mix rest of the ingredients.

yum! Changed to 1 cup (heaping) sugar and 5 TBSP cocoa as suggested and added chopped pecans. Used premade frozen pie crust (I fail when trying to make pie crust). Baked at 325 for an hour - Turned out fabulous, tasted like a chocolaty chocolate chip cookie. so good

Sooooo good! I followed the instructions for tempering the eggs from Panamabev's review. Decreased sugar to 1 heaping cup, decreased butter to 2 tablespoons , increased cocoa to 4 tablespoons. Baked for 45 min, then left in turned off oven with door cracked for 10 minutes. It's smooth and creamy almost like a chocolate pudding pie! Just the consistency and taste I've been looking for. Thank you for the recipe! Will be making again and again!

I checked pie at recommended cook time and pie was real jiggly in middle. I cooked 10 min longer; still not firm in middle. I took pie out of oven anyway. After cooling pie still not firm. 
I don't know if I will try this recipe again

I didn't have any evaporated milk so I used whole milk. I was really pleased because it was the closest to what my Grandmother used to call chess pie that I have found. I will continue to use this recipe for sure.

I have made this pie several times.  We love it, however I have had a couple times where the pie didn't set up.  I know it sounds srtange, but my mom used to tell me that the weather sometimes plays a part in baking.   Seems.like I remember her telling me fudge was like that, where it wouldn't  fully set.  who knows.  I know I will make it again though for sure.

This is a classic chocolate chess pie. It is essentially the same pie as mentioned in the movie The Help. The only difference being the ratio of the ingredients. As written here it is still a 5 star pie. If you like a little more chocolate flavor/fudgeyness: add an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder and reduce the evaporated milk to 3/4 C. You can add a dash of salt as well. I love it both ways. It works well in a graham cracker crust too.

The first time I made I t I followed recipe exactly using a frozen pie crust, it tasted great with cool whip like milk chocolate home made pudding.  The second time I added another teaspoon of cocoa it was even better.

Increased cocoa to 5 tbs and reduced sugar to 1 cup...ummmmmm this is the bomb.com!  Everything else was followed in the instructions.. I had only medium eggs so I used 3 instead of 2 because they are smaller.

Yessssss! I made a half size in a 6x8 glass dish because I've made chocolate pies that always ended up being a texture I didn't like. This one is like a soft baked chocolate pudding pie, not brownie-like at all.  I tried it first while still warm and prefer it that way to being chilled. 
I used a graham cracker crust and doubled the cocoa amount and added a bit of cornstarch to the sugar. The key to smoothness is sifting the cocoa and them mixing with the sugar before adding wet ingredients. I'm already planning on making another since my son ate nearly the whole thing already.

I'd probably give this pie four stars for the recipe as listed, but with a few modifications it is easily a five star pie. Inspired by some others here my wife and I made the following changes: 5 tablespoons of cocoa (instead of 3), 1 cup of sugar (instead of 1 1/2), 2 1/2 tablespoons of butter (instead of 4) and 50 minutes of cook time. We also mixed (using a hand mixer) all the ingredients for at least five minutes as someone else suggested. We made these changes based on comments and pictures that showed a pie that was a little too sweet, too greasy and that didn't fully set. Well, those simple changes made for a pie with rich, deep chocolate flavor and a firm but luscious texture. It's absolutely perfect this way. Try it!

This turned out so good! I didn't have evaporated milk so I subbed 3.5oz milk and 1.5oz heavy cream. I also followed other reviews and used only 1c sugar and about 1/2c cocoa powder. When it came out of the oven, I thought it was overcooked because the top was hard, but when we ate it, it was a very thin crispy top and fudgy underneath. Will definitely make again.

I love this pie- I co-worker gave me the recipe years ago, and its has always been a hit.  it has to chill overnight (or a few hours in the freezer if you really are having an addiction crisis. :-)
great fudgy/chocolatey pie.  I used Ghirradelli cocoa the first time- great too!

I took two pieces to my sister (an accomplished woman in the kitchen).  She texted me and said it was the best she had had in a long time.  I followed the recipe to the letter and was impressed with myself.  Thanksgiving, here it comes and the pie, too !

This was delicious!  I waffled back and forth whether I was going to follow the recipe or the reviews as far as the amount of sugar, but then it turned out I was low on sugar and could barely scrape together a cup, so I just went with that, as well as using the heaping tablespoons of cocoa.  I also followed the advice to use softened, not melted, butter, and to mix it very thoroughly.  It turned out great!  One of the best chocolate pies I've ever made!  I topped it with whipped cream and chocolate curls.  I was a little slow in getting it started, so I didn't have time to let it cool as much as I wanted, but it set up just fine, even though it was still warm when we ate it.

This was the first time I have ever made a pie so I was really hesitant.  And A lot of the reviews made it hard to know what to do or expect.  So I followed the instructions written and the pie came out perfect!  The only things i would say are: 1. Beat the pie filling for about 5 minutes before pouring into pie crust...this will help the sugar blend.  2.  I used a deep dish pie crust 3.  I cooked it for 45 mins then wrapped the edges with foil and baked another 30 minutes.  Cool completely and the filling will set perfectly.  I served with the recipe for homemade whipped cream from this website and it was a huge hit.  We have a bakery here that makes these and charges $30.00 for each pie! Highway robbery right??!  I had most ingredients on hand except for the evaporated milk and pie crust so i paid about $5 total.   Everybody  couldn't believe I had made this myself.  All of my girlfriends kept raving and saying that this pie was way better than the ones they were buying from the bakery ??.  Thank you for sharing!

Followed another reviewers instructions and it set perfectly. Reduce sugar to 1 cup; increase choc to 5 tablespoons. Mix all ingredients except eggs, cook over medium heat, stirring constantly. Beat eggs in separate bowl.  Add heated mixture to eggs 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly. Should start to thicken immediately. Pour into pie crust. Bake 325 for 1 hr.  Cool on wire rack. Store in refrigerator

I was skeptical about making this after reading some of the reviews saying that it did not set up right. I did not have a problem with that. I followed the recipe exactly and mine set just fine. Delicious! Perhaps it depends on the elevation where you are. I know that certain things need more time to bake/ cook at higher elevations. I served mine with vanilla ice cream and a little chocolate syrup and toasted pecans on top. Cinnamon is good sprinkled on top also. Reminds me of one my mom used to make and we called it Hot Fudge Pie. Thanks for sharing!

11/17/14.  This quick, rich and easy pie got rave reviews from hubby and some church friends.  Although I've made many chess pies over the years, this is the first chocolate one, but it won't be the last.  Extremely rich

This is wonderful.  We couldn't wait for it to cool all the way lol. It tastes like a brownie not set all the way.  I followed Panama bee's suggestions and reduced sugar to 1 cup but left the cocoa to 3 tbl. And added pecans.  Definitely added this to my personal cookbook.

After seeing 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar, I knew it would be too sweet, so I read many of the helpful reviews and came up with the following modifications: 3/4 cup sugar, 4 tablespoons cocoa, 2 tablespoons of butter partially melted, 1 teaspoon corn starch. I baked the pie for about 45 minutes at 350, then reduced the heat to about 325 and watched it for 10-15 minutes. I checked for doneness with a toothpick, and when the toothpick came out only buttery, i knew it had set enough. I then let it cool completely and refrigerated it for a few hours. It set just right for us and was pretty tasty. It smells heavenly, too.

I loved this pie! My favorite dessert at Golden Corral is the Chocolate Chess Pie, and this turned out a little better than theirs. I did have to bake it a little longer than it called for to get it to set up, and I did cover the crust with aluminum foil to prevent it from getting too brown. I will definitely make this again!!

Awesome recipe with a few tweaks from reviewers. Use only 1 cup sugar and 5 tbsp cocoa. heat everything except eggs together in saucepan until blended. Take a small amount of choc mix and add to eggs in separate bowl. Whisk together, then add this mixture to the remaining choc mix and heat and whisk until starts to thicken. Pour into shell. Also makes apps 15 tarts. Yum!

Fantastic! So easy and very simple to make. Like many others, I cut the sugar to 1 cup, and added 2 extra tablespoons of cocoa powder, and I didn't completely melt the butter (thanks to one reviewer who had some experience with Chess Pie. This was a hit and I know I'll make it again and again,

I loved it! It turned out exactly how I was expecting it to. Make sure to add some fork holes to the bottom of your crust. Also, I had bake a little extra, maybe ten minutes. Still... delicious!

Made a few minor changes and it turned out perfect! Doubled the recipe but used only 2 c. sugar so cut back on sugar over all. Mixed a little bit of the cocoa/sugar mixture into the eggs before adding them into the bowl. Also used heaping tablespoons of the cocoa per other reviewers' suggestions.

Made this and also the regular Chess Pie on this site. This one was my fav of the two, because the chocolate off sets the super sweetness of Chess pie. It is still very rich and very sweet, but not knock-you-out with a sugar rush like the original was.

I used a graham cracker crust and substituted s'mores flavored coffe creamer for a bit of unique flavor. I then sprinkled powdered suger and chocolate shavings in an outline for my friend's birthday. Tasted awesome!

This is the best chocolate pie that I have ever tasted! Although I think that it would taste better if you cut the sugar down to 1cup.

Love it! Not sure how everyone else gets the top of the pie to be dark brown... I've made this twice, and each time the top of the pie comes out a tan color.

Absolutely delicious! So simple and pretty, with a crispy little crust on it. I also used 3 heaping Tbls. of cocoa and served it with whipped cream. This is the nicest slicing pie I have ever made also...the knife went right through it neatly and didn't gum up on the blade. 5 stars!

I followed the recipe precisely and the pie turned out excellent. As the recipe states, cook for 45 minutes or until set. Mine set at about 35, so keep an eye on it.

The taste was great, but I put it in the oven for 10 minutes longer than it said and it still didn't solidify. It was like chocolate sauce. Update: I refrigerated it overnight and it was much better...not nearly as runny. I topped it with whipped cream (also from this site) and the combination was wonderful.

Great pie!! Rich but not to sweet, So easy to make and my family and friends love it.   For a little extra chocolate flavor I add a squirt or to of hershey's chocolate syrup.

This pie has been a holiday tradition in my family for as long as I can remember, and it's still my favorite! My mom told me to sift the cocoa first and add a dash of salt. Also, top with Cool Whip and you have the perfect pie for chocoholics! Oh yes, and it is wonderful when made a day ahead, refrigerated, and served cold.

Like several others, the pie did not set. Cooked it exactly as the recipe said. "Solid" on top, pudding in the middle.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it tastes identical to the recipe I was trying to locate. The only problem I'm having is that I can't get it to set. I've made a couple and added 10 min each time to the cooking time, so now I've gotten up to 1 hr 15 min, I let them cool, but they still will not set. I'm not giving up. No matter how runny they turn out, they still taste great!

My family always makes chocolate chess pies during the holidays and I couldn't get my mom's recipe the day I needed it, so I decided to try this one out. It turned out perfectly, just like my mom's. Everyone complimented and I will be making it again soon. Thanks!

Does not set.  I have tried this recipe multiple times and it fails me every time.  Center remains liquid even after cooking an extra 20 minutes and letting it cool completely.  There are not enough eggs for the fat & milk.  And it is very, very sweet.

Oh WOW. This was SO delicious! I knew as soon as I poured the mixture into the pie shell that it would be. It is rich and perfectly chocolatey. I made this for my future mother-in-law to thank her for buying us our beautiful new condo. She said it was absolute perfection and hopes I'll make another one very soon. It's so easy I might just make another one tomorrow!

I enjoyed this simple recipe.  It works best after it has chilled in the refrigerator for a while, then cut and serve with whipped cream.  Also, you may want to put foil around the edges of the pie crust so it doesn't get too brown.  I will definately make this again, especially since I usually have all the ingredients on hand. --no need to use electric hand mixer, just whisk all together.--

I've made this pie on two different occasions. The first time I made it exactly like the recipe called for, but my family stated it was entirely too sweet. The second time I made it with only 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 and it was perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious.  Not too sweet. Can't tell it's cocoa in the recipe.  Don't change a thing.  Needs to be kept in the refrigerator.

Extremely easy recipe.  Couple of things to note: I ended up doubling this recipe and used a 9 inch deep dish glass pie plate.  The end result was sheer heaven.  I topped each slice with fresh sweetened cinnamon whipped cream.  YUM!

A BIG winner! So easy to make and such a chocolate delight, in flavor and texture. I served it and heard "that is the best chocolate pie I've ever had...no it's the best pie, period, that I've ever had!" I used Keebler Shortbread crust, topped with Extra Creamy Cool Whip. Unforgettable dessert!

Turned out OK, but I wasn't a fan of it. It was overly sweet with not enough chocolate flavor. Everyone else seemed to like it, though.

Very easy to make with ingredients I usually have on hand. Pie was without texture and very sweet.

Too sweet and not all that tasteful. Your Kindergartener might like it.

This was not the pie I was hoping for.  The texture was a little grainy, and the chocolate taste was too overwhelming.  I felt like it was too heavy, and just too darn sweet.  Too bad...I'll keep looking...
