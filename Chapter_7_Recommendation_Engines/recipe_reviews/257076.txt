Fantastic salad!  I didn't have pomegranate juice so substituted fresh lemon juice and it was great.  Will make this one over and over again!

This was good but the directions regarding the orange and grapefruit were not very clear to me. In order to get enough juice for the dressing I took a couple segments of each and squeezed the juice out of them. The dressing was not thick but just enough to give the greens a good wilt. That might have been my fault though for not fully understanding the directions regarding the orange and grapefruit. I'm not sure? Regardless, I liked this and it is one I will make again. Bacon would be a nice addition.
