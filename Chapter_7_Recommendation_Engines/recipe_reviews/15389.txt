I liked the idea of a chicken broth base, which I used after I boiled the potatos in regular water and drained.  A combination of milk and half & half was used, and also bit of bacon grease. I used a potato masher and broke up the potatos somewhat in the soup mix.  I also used fresh garlic instead of powder; about 2 cloves, added one celery stalk (diced) and 4 green onions (minus the green tops, my family doesn't like onions). I served this with bacon bits and grated cheese on top.  This soup was good.

This was great!  We found that the second day that there seemed to be too much milk - I suggest using about 2/3 what it calls for, otherwise it tastes simply like milk with a touch of potatos.  Also, we tried it again (with less milk and added spinach and browned ground beef - very yummy!

This was a very tasty soup. Of course using the red potatoes, the soup stayed chunky. I like my soup a bit thicker, so I would have mashed up some of the potaoes to my liking. Great flavor though. I didn't have an onion so I used onion flakes, didn't have celery seeds, but we used celery salt to our liking, and was very tasty!

Thanks a LOT for the suggestions in the reviews, everyone!  First off, I used a light roux like one reviewer suggested (which completely eliminated the separation problems), used about half of the called-for celery seed and added celery of my own, and added some fresh spinach when I added the milk.  Turned out great!

It was watery and did not taste good to me. Doubt I will try this again. Perhaps less celery seed?

Unfortunately not as great as it looks in the photo, it's very milky and the reviews were right, the butter just floats on top. I'm sure with the added suggestions below it would be much better.

Added mashed red potato to the soup to make it creamy, added cubed chicken and only half the milk. Good recipe, but butter definitely separates from the cream.

This soup was all right.  I was a little disappointed in it, actually, but the basic idea is a solid one that I will build upon in the future and try again.  The kids liked it and my husbnad liked it well enough but had a lot of suggestions on how it could be improved.  We'll have itagain, I'm sure, but with modifications.

I think there are some typos on this recipe.  It says 1 (49.5 fluid ounce) can of broth - I think that was supposed to be 1 (14.9oz) can.  Also, 2 tablespoons of celery seed was a bit too much for my family's liking so I think that should have been 2 teaspoons.  It was too runny so I would make again but modify the amounts of liquids and probably make the roux first.  I added bacon bits to mine and served with shredded cheese.

Definately do not use as much milk as the recipe calls for, it turns out less like soup and more like a broth. I added some frozen sweet corn also, good flavor just not very substantial with all that liquid!

I used yellow potatoes instead of red, no celery seed so I used celery salt and added in one chopped stalk of celery. Simple, easy to make and tasty.

This soup was good, but the liquid was too runny,and as someone else stated, the butter kept forming at the top.  Next time I will try to make a roux and see if it does better!  I also Sauted onion, garlic, and celery in the beginning.

I thought this was nice and creamy. Just one complaint the butter congealed at the top of each bowl and in the pot. I tried it with the butter and it was like I was eating butter soup. I ended up painstakingly scooping the butter out and it was much better.

This recipe doesn't even deserve one star!  I can usually trust highly rated recipes, but not this time.  People - review the recipe posted, not how you had to add this or take out that and then rate your own recipe!  I made a mistake and just made the recipe without reading the reviews first, never make that mistake again!

My husband and I LOVE this potato soup. I make a smaller portion using about 6 red potatoes and half of the other ingredients. I also use green onion instead of regular onion. If anyone wants their soup thicker, just add about 1 cup of  instant potato flakes.

It has way too much celery seed.  It is not very thick at all and not overly flavorful. again, will only use 2 tsp celery seed and try to make it thicker by either mashing some of the potatoes, use less liquid, make a roux or add some flour.

I wish I had read the reviews before making it....do not use as much milk as listed. It is too much. I added heavy whipping cream, and a 48 oz. box of broth  I added carrots, celery, bell pepper and fresh garlic. I also added bay leaves, paparika, pepper flakes, dried basil and parsley. I added a small amount of a flour based roux to attempt to thicken it up. It took a significant amount of seasoning to make it taste good, because of the amount of liquid the receipe calls for. Overall, after all the doctoring up we did, it has a nice flavor.  

This is the first time I ever used a receipe off this site, that I had to work so hard on.

A big hit even with my persnickety teen who rarely eats anything I cook. I used no sugar added almond milk which worked great. I added extra potatoes for day 2, because as others noted it’s too much liquid day 2. The family also added fat free sour cream in their individual bowls and stated that was a delicious addition.

Kinda terrible, honestly. I ended up adding mashed potato flakes to attempt to even out the texture, and then quinoa flakes and mashed up the potatoes to make it thick. This, of course, made the soup gluey on top of being bland already. There's gotta be a better way. A waste of perfectly good potatoes and milk, imho.

Great Flavor!  In a separate sauce pan I added 1 stick of butter with 8Tbl spoons of flour to create a roux. Then I added 1 cup of and half and half and 1 cup of milk to the roux.  Stir until it thickens then  add to potato mixture.  Add more milk to adjust consistency

I'm giving it 4 stars not because I liked my version of this recipe so much as I like the base of this recipe and think others would find it tasty. To start I made HALF of the batch in this recipe. 4 red potatoes, chopped celery, chopped onion, 1/4 butter, garlic powder to taste, seasoning salt, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Once you add everything and get the potatoes soft I added only two cups of milk. In addition, TO KEEP THE BUTTER FROM SEPARATING, and to help thicken the soup from being so 'juicy/runny' I added about a half cup of flour. It turned out perfect with some shredded mild cheddar cheese on top. Both of my kids (3 and 5 y/o) loved it.  ENJOY!

Yes, less liquid, and added a little flour for thickening.  As for floating butter....well, Grandma's potato soup always had floating butter and I think it's kinda pretty!  You can stir in the butter with your spoon when you eat it.  Hardy cold weather soup.  Only four stars because of the boo-boos on liquid amounts, but it's a keeper.  Thanks!

As with all soup recipes I use them as a starting point and add or subtract whatever I happen to have on hand.  I added celery, frozen corn, frozen peas.  Cooked the potatoes in the chicken broth that was left over from my roommate cooking chicken legs.  added chopped green pepper and thickened it with a little flour mixed with some cold milk.  I didn't add all that milk, either.  I used about 1 cup with the thickening process but had about 1 1/2 quarts of broth from cooking the chicken legs.  It's a great start ~ then make it your own! Oh - I added crushed red pepper because I like soup with a little zing.
