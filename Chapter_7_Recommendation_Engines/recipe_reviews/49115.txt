This was a very simple and tasty marinade. I actually fried the pork, so used the marinade as a sauce with it. Very good. If the mango and kiwis are very ripe, you probably won't need the sugar.

I loved this recipy!  I made it for company and the chops were so tender it was a big hit with everyone.  I did not have enough to triple it so I added some pinapple chunks and juice and it was great.

This is a really great marinade that keeps pork chops really juicy on the grill.  It's easy to freeze and thaw shortly before you grill, too.  Awesome!

This pork was so tender and juicy with tons of flavor. I ended up boiling the rest of the marinade left in the bottom of the bag and used it as extra sauce. It was even good as a dressing over greens with the cut up pork on top. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I normally hesitate when cooking pork as it usually comes out dry, but this is not only juicy, it's quite tasty too.  I went a little heavy on the red pepper (I chose red pepper flakes instead of ground) so it was spicy, but it's easy enough to eliminate the pepper without much of a sacrifice to the taste.

I'll definitely be making this again!

Good. Sweet. Nothing outstanding though.
