Very tasty!  The recipe was very easy to get together and had a nice balance of flavors.   It was a great accompaniment to my grilled chicken.  The only change I made was to use Greek feta because I could not find the Bulgarian feta the recipe stated.

Forget about the Bulgarian Feta cheese! Don't let it stop you from making this great recipe. Use regular Greek feta cheese,and add in a little more butter if you are concerned about creaminess. Feta cheese does not melt well as well all know, so crumble it finely instead of chopping it. I also sprinkled mine with roasted pine nuts per my preference, but it was not necessary. The simplicity and great taste of this recipe is what makes it so special. Please give it a try.

Loved this recipe.  Very easy.  I used 10 oz. frozen chopped spinach and Athenos Mediterranean herb feta.  It gave it a nice flavor. So much better than boxed rice pilaf.  I'll be making this a lot!!

This is a great recipe, and I'm disappointed that more people don't seem to have tried and rated it. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I had a shallot to use instead of the onion, and I added twice as much spinach, as I also wanted to use that up. I chopped it into pretty small pieces before I added it, and used regular feta cheese, which actually melted quite nicely and added some nice salty accents. This would be a fine dish for company - it is very pretty to serve and easy to make. It would also sit for quite awhile, I imagine - maybe half an hour or so - if you keep it covered. Thanks, for a new addition to my rotation.

This recipe was awesome!  What a nice way to merge feta, spinach, orzo, and white rice.  And we all lived happily ever after ~

I have made this so many times I don't even need to look at the recipe anymore.  I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet...It is in regular rotation at our house. It is easy, delicious and versatile.  I make it exactly as the recipe calls but just use regular feta with no problems. I actually think it melts decently if you crumble it small and mix it in very well. Goes great with Pork, Chicken, Fish, Veggies, etc. Having it tonight with "roasted veggie sheet pan dinner with feta" from this site for a meatless meal...

This is a delicious pilaf. I served a double recipe as a side at Christmas dinner and it pleased the whole crowd, and I've had it since as a filling lunch.

I loved it!  Made exactly as directed except I used regular feta cheese.  It was very good.  Paired it with Greek Lemon Garlic Chicken on another site.

I had to amend the recipe some, I couldn’t locate Hungarian feta & after running around to different specialty grocery stores I gave up & used greek feta. I also used vegetable broth because that’s all I had on hand. Husband asked if we could have it once a week!

I have made this several times and everyone wants more.  I follow the recipe and use regular feta since we live in Northwest New Mexico and the more exotic cheeses aren't available here.  I've taken it to several pot luck dinners and never have any leftovers and several requests for the recipe.  Very simple to make.

Whole family love it. I doubled the recipe, and added a little parmesan cheese because I didn't have quite enough feta for a double batch. Im thinking about using the leftovers in a salad tomorrow with artichoke hearts, olives, cherry tomatoes, and maybe a little vinegar and olive oil.

Awesome! Nice change from the usual rice pilaf. I only had canned spinach on hand and it was still great. Feta makes this quite salty so reduce salt chicken broth is a must when cooking the rice.

Although time consuming, this was excellent and easy to make.  I used organic ingredients and the flavor was wonderful.  A word of caution, it does make plenty for a family of 4.  I wasn't sure and doubled the recipe, oops!  Pilaf again tomorrow!

I had leftover farm fresh feta that needed to be used. I found this recipe and made it for a BBQ potluck.  Everyone loved it,  the kids and adults had seconds.  I made the following changes: I omitted the spinach (I was out), I used 1c. Rice and no orzo (for my gluten free friends), and I added 1t. Lemon pepper. 

I made this a second time with the above changes,  but I used a chevre cheese instead of feta.  Was delish!

I've made this twice. The first time I did it I made it exactly as written, but I used my flavorful homemade chicken broth. The second time I used ordinary feta and topped it with toasted pine nuts for added flavor and crunch. I will definitely be making it this way again.

This is an awesome recipe!  Made it for my husband and he loved it so I made it again for company and they loved it!  The feta cheese really makes it taste so good.  The only thing I did differently was that I made the rice in a rice cooker and then added it into the mixture. Delish!

Easy to put together and very flavorful. Had to make 16 servings for a get-together and received lots of compliments. Only difference in directions  was after browning orzo and cooking onions, I transferred everything to a large pot to continue cooking with the rice.

very flavourful combination I didn't have fresh spinach so I used frozen spinach. Next time I will try it with fresh spinach I think it will taste even better!

Excellent!  I used red onion instead of dried and it was delicious. Highly recommend.

Also used plain old greek feta. Only had a little fresh spinach so chopped up some fresh basil (about 2/3 c spinach, 1/3 c basil) and that worked well.

This recipe is great.  I've started putting spinach in more of my rice and pasta partly because of it.  I don't know what Bulgarian feta is like, but the feta I had worked fine.

I trids this because it had so few reviews but everyone loved it, and its awsome! Like some others, I just use greek feta that is easy to find in the store and it has great flavor. I did everything else by the recipie and decided to make a few changes: I thought it was too oniony, so I cut onion amt in half, also too wet from the onion so I used a paper towel to drain the onion a little but maybe cutting back on the broth would work too, also I prefer low sodium broth and then salt to taste at the table.
