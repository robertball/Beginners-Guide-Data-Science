I made a few modifications to this recipe, and it turned out great. I upped the ham to 2 cups, used tator tots instead of the sliced potatoes, omitted the carrots, and used more mushrooms. I also used milk instead of water, and added dashes of worchestershire, celery salt, garlic powder and onion powder, and a bit of salt and pepper. I covered the casserole for the first 40 minutes, then I uncovered it for another 15. At that point I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and baked for about 5 more minutes. Nest time I think i'll add some finely chopped onions. I think this is a good basic recipe, with your own flavorful additions it'll turn out fantastic!

I took the advice of others on this and came out with an all around good recipe. I did not add the canned mushrooms. I put 2 cups of ham and could have used more. I cut out the water and used 1/2 cup milk . I used garlic powder and ground pepper to taste. I added 1 teaspoon of worchester sauce and a 1/2 a cup mozzarella cheese. It took an hour and a half to cook and my family enjoyed it. I did not cover it. Anna H.

My husband loved his. He said it was the most yummiest thing I've made in a long time. I'll definately make it again.
I actually used more potatoes, and 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup along with about 3/4 can water of each. I used healthy request soup. 
I sprinkled salt, pepper, and onion powder over the potatoes and carrots. I didn't use mushrooms as I didn't have any on hand. 
I couldn't help thinking there was something missing so I added about a cup of the "French's" Durkee Fried Onions (the kind you put in green bean casserole), and I really think it made all the difference.
I cooked it for about 2 hours uncovered.

I'll will most certainly make this again. It was one of the easiest things I've ever done. Clean up was a snap too!

Okay, here are my modifications to this recipe. It is a good recipe to feed a crowd (I have a family of six). I doubled the ham, doubled the carrots and used two cans of soup - yet only 1 can of milk. Be careful as it will overflow in the oven, and be sure to season and this recipe calls for no salt or pepper which would leave any recipe bland. Good luch! My group liked this recipe and I will make again.

I thought the dish was very good, but did not think elegant would describe it and I think 4 servings would be closer than 6.  I will definitely make it again when I have leftover ham.

This was a great way to use leftover ham.  I did not have mushroom soup so I used half-fat celery soup and it was just fine.  I used more potatoes and carrots than called for and I added about 1/4 tsp pepper.  My whole family really liked it, including two picky eaters aged 5 and 9.

Since we enjoy onions with scalloped potatoes, I added thinly sliced onions to this casserole; also added freshly ground black pepper to taste.  We LOVED it and I'm looking forward to a covered dish supper to take it to!!  "Mama Mary"

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I wanted a good recipe for the leftover Christmas ham, and this is the one!  I use low-sodium cream of mushroom soup  (ham is salty enough) and 1/2 can cream of onion soup, mixed with 1 cup light sour cream. I used canned carrots and added canned peas and boiled my sliced potatoes for 10 min before baking- this way cook time was reduced to 30 minutes : )  I added shredding sharp chedder cheese and french fried onions to the top for the last 10 minutes. DELICIOUS!

Good basic casserole.  I left out the mushrooms so that my kids would eat it.  I had some left over green beans that I added.  This is a great casserole to finish off leftovers.

Unattractive looking and tasting. Bland with no specific flavour. Used the recipe as outlined. Best thing about it, was that it was as easy to prepare as to throw out.

This was a nice use for leftover ham.  I added only 1 carrot and 1 stalk of celery, and followed the advice of others on substituted the water for milk.  I left the mushrooms out.  I also increased the ham to 2 cups.  I topped it with salt, pepper, and paprika and added some french fried onions in the last 15 minutes.  I baked for around 2 hours total.  Yummy!

Too many potatoes, Judy!  
Needed some other spices; I added some pepper.

This was a little too rich and creamy for my taste. I know that sounds odd for someone not to like rich and creamy, but I wanted something lighter.

This recipe is one of my favorite childhood meals that I still make today. Only variation is that we never added water, but did add corn, a little cheese on top and crushed crackers.  Yummy!

Definitely needs a chopped onion added, and ground pepper, otherwise a great recipe. I used 3 c ham, 8 potatoes, 2 c. carrots, 1 onion, 2 cans of soup and 1 can of milk. No mushrooms. It was a hit with my family.

Yummy! What a great and easy way to use leftover ham! I used low-sodium soup, but it was still a bit salty because of the soup/ham combo, and may also have been because I used prepackaged "fresh" potatoes (I think they were Bob Evans) to save even more preparation time. Bake time was 1 hr. Very easy to prepare. I would definitely make this again and maybe add onions and sharp cheddar. Husband enjoyed this, too.

This was a nice way to use up left over ham. I turned down the oven temperature to avoid boiling over and covered it after the first 45 minutes. I will make this next time I have leftover ham.

The recipe doesn't say whether or not to cover the dish while cooking.  There was still water in the bottom of the pan at the end of the cooking time. Perhaps milk would be better than water in the recipe.  Very bland.  My kids (8 & 10) wouldn't touch it. Will not make this again.

I did not use carrots and added cheddar cheese the last 45 minutes of baking.  Perhaps one cup of water would be better - too watery.  We enjoyed it though and will prepare again - even the picky husband.

Adjust the water depending on the number of spuds used. Needs to be spiced up with Salsa or some such.

I kept the basic recipe, using about 1/2 cup of milk as suggested; Worcestershire sauce to taste, salt, garlic powder, and finished it off with parsley after it was done.  The only difference is I used leftover Smoked ham; about 2cups and used about half of a 6 oz. container of French fried onions mixed in while baking; then used the rest of the container sprinkled around the edge after it was done baking.  Then I put on the fresh snipped parsley.  Looks good, I'm letting it cool down now, but preliminary taste test says this one is good to go!

Not appealing to look at, but it has a nice flavour. I also had to thicken the sauce, a little watery. Kids enjoyed it.

I found this way to starchy from the potatoes, not very flavorful. My husband ate a little more that I did, he didn't say much about it.

Use low sodium chicken broth instead of water and add some italian seasoning for extra flavor

This one turned out pretty good. I used milk instead of water and added green peppers, onions and garlic. I seasoned it with salt, pepper and some red pepper flakes for a little heat. I think it would be better with some more cheese and maybe some fresh herbs.

Not bad but not a big hit at our house. I added salt/pepper/minced onion/soy sauce and it was still rather bland.  Also substituted 3/4 can milk for the water as suggested.  Added canned peas instead of mushrooms.  Topped with shredded cheddar & a sprinkle of bread crumbs & uncovered to brown last 15 min of cooking time. Easy meal to prepare.

This recipe was yummy!!! I don't care for mushrooms, and only added one 4 oz can.  In addition I substituted milk for water, add some frozen peas, salt and pepper and a sprinkle of worcestershire.  I am not the cook in our house, but my hubby just loved it!  I did too!  Thanks for a simple, easy recipe that tastes soooooo good!  LAY A PIECE OF FOIL OVER TOP OF PAN DURING LAST HALF HOUR TO KEEP HAM FROM DRYING OUT!  ENJOY!!

This was a great casserole for using leftover ham! I used small skin on potatoes cubed.  I added frozen peas, finely chopped onion and shredded cheddar cheese.  I topped it with a bit more shredded cheese and some panko crumbs.  I broiled it for a few minutes to brown.  We loved the result.  Will save to my recipe box and make again!

I give this 5 stars.  I didnt have any mushrooms, not even canned, lol.  so that was on me.  But the end result was really good.  My son ( a grown man) had 3 helpings, lol.  Thats always a sign of a winner.  I've never made anything like this before so it was nice that first time out I got great reviews. To be honest I didnt care for it, lol.  But I'm a very finicky eater, so dont worry.  I just dont like most meat.  I only make it because my son does.  Hes disabled so cant fend for himself.  I make things I try to eat around.

I did make some changes, first I added salt and pepper, and instead of using water I used milk.  I didn't have mushroom and my kids do not like mushrooms, so I added peas and corn and shredded carrots instead of sliced.  I also added a few splashes of Cholula to spice it up a little.  My family enjoyed it.

I made this recipe last night. It is very bland and watery. I added salt and pepper to make it edible but I would not make it again.

I have used one bag of tater tots, no carrots, but mushrooms, lots of ham, one can of cream of celery soup and milk with the same can to measure, instead of water, also baked covered for 40 mins, then added shredded cheese on top and baked another 50 mins uncovered.It was really yummy. My husband loved it. Great option for leftover ham. I will definitely try again. Thanks Judy for sharing with us.

This was simple, but very good. I used 1/2 cup of white wine instead of some of the water, which added a bit more flavor. My kids loved this!

The recipe makes a good side dish... It doesn't look very appetizing although it smells great. My boyfriend didn't really wanna try it but then ate half of it. Use more ham than the recipe calls for.

This was a very delicious and simple recipe.  I added a half cup of gorganzola cheese to the mix:  it added a touch of depth of flavor and was like eating a fettucine!

I thought this was a great recipe for leftover ham. It had all the different flavors of the ingredients which made it very tasty.  It was also quick to prepare.  I used a 4 oz. can of mushrooms and thought that was plenty.
