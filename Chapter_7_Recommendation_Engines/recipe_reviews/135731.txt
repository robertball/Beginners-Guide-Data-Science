My husband loves it. I used ground beef instead of lamb because that's what we had in the house. It was amazing.

Have had the original version at the Boschendal Winery in South Africa. This turned out great. As mentioned in an earlier review the liquid and fat needs to be poured off prior to adding the custard. Serve with chutney for a traditional experience. If you can find it, Mrs Ball's Chutney is the condiment of choice in South Africa

I have never had bobotie before, so I don't have anything to compare this dish to. I expected it to be sweet and complex in flavors and texture and that's exactly how it turned out. I used beef instead of lamb but everything else I followed exactly. I looked at some images of bobotie online and saw that most people decorated the top with bay leaves so I did that and also added some fo the almonds on top. We liked this dish. I made it with Indian Rice Pilaf from this site and it went well with it. When I make this again, I will get rid of the liquid that the meat rendered once it was cooked and before pouring the milk/egg mixture on top. It came out a bit watery because of that liquid.

Made it.    

Verbatim.    

And it was faultless, a showstopper!
As a South African, I know my Boboties and this is now the only recipe I will ever use!
