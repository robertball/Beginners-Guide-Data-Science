I'm never buying canned pizza sauce ever again! This is SO much better. Great balance of flavors. I made it exactly as written, well except for making a half batch.  Use a good quality olive oil, because the flavor really comes through. I love this so much, I was eating it my the spoonful while making my pizza! Great recipe!

I halved the recipe since I was using for a small cauliflower crust pizza. The thyme was a little too much for my taste; so, I used very thinly on the pizza. Iâ€™d prbly back off a tad on the thyme next time, but definitely a tasty and worthy sauce. Thank you for sharing.
