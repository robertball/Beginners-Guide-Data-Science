I scaled the recipe to 1 serving. It was pretty good even though I  substituted soy milk for the real milk and 1 packet of Swiss Miss Instant Hot Chocolate instead of the hot cocoa mix . I topped it off with fat free whip cream. I wound up with a delicious 135 calorie Skinny Frozen Hot Chocolate. Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out very nicely! Make sure your ice cubes are nice and fine. You don’t want ice chunks in it!

Scaled this down to 2 servings when I made it. It was way too much hot chocolate mix. It was very grainy. Also didn’t have enough ice to make it slushy enough. Had to add more milk and ice to get rid of the grainy texture. If I make this again I will add more ice and a lot less hot chocolate powder.

A bit too sweet. Next time, I’ll only add 2 cups hot cocoa mix & go from there.

Very good. My family loved it. I will definitely make this again. One thing I found was that I needed to add a lot more ice and less hot chocolate powder.
