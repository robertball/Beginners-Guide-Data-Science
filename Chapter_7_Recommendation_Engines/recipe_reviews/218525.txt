I didn't feel that this was a bad recipe. For my taste, it was a bit sweet but it was a nice and simple glazed carrot recipe. I steamed quickly in the microwave, used light butter, splenda brown sugar, and slightly reduced the honey. I felt it could use more mint flavor. Perhaps it could be obtained by steaming the carrots with the mint or even putting the mint in with the butter to infuse and make more of a "mint butter" prior to adding the carrots and remainder of ingredients?

These carrots are delicious. I usually make candied carrots with maple syrup but decided to give this one a try and it was very good. I had leftover mint from some mojitos I made, so I used that instead of the dry kind, chooped finely.

Great carrots! Sweet and the mint went very well in this dish. My husband ate all of his and he is really picky about his carrots. My only addition was a pinch of salt. He usually says something if I put anything in his carrots, but since I am the cook I do it anyway ;)

i was visiting a retired couple in liverpool england.  the old gentlemen was the head chef on the queen mary. (both now retired)  he whipped up this side dish of carrots. he did tell me he added mint but manners told me not to ask for the recipe!  I've never been able to duplicate that wonderful dish until now. absolutely excellent

Wow, these were WAY too good.  Afraid that I am going to make them over and over and die from the sugar and honey piling up in my system.  They were tons better than I imagined they would be - the dry mint (which I've never used before, always gotten fresh) worked perfectly with the sauce / glaze of the mixed sugars and butter.  You didn't specify which type of brown sugar to use, so I went with light brown sugar; next time I make this I'm going to try dark brown sugar to see if it imparts that deeper, natural feeling that it can convey.

This was pretty and tasty but too sweet. I'd cut the sugar and honey in half next time.

Try this recipe! I didn't know what to expect with the mint but it was a wonderful touch. Simple enough to through together anytime but would be a great choice to side with an eloquent meal.

By far the best recipe for carrots, this does make them sweet but in a completely delicious and not artificial way. The carrots were nice and tender and tasted fantastic with our baked pot roast recipe also from this site. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone even those who might not like carrots that much. I think this recipe would also be a good way to get kids to eat their vegetables.
