This tasted great and it was super easy. I didn't have the stuffing mix so I used plain bread crumbs with ms. dash. Everyone loved it. It was very moist, a nice change for a meatloaf.

This being the first time I had ground chicken in a recipe, I must say I was a little impressed.  I would definitely rate this 4 stars.  I did modify the recipe a tad bit.  I didn't have garlic pepper as the recipe stated so I used garlic & herb seasoning, I also added garlic, and an extra egg because I was afraid it was going to dry out.  Instead of using an onion I used minced onion in a jar.  (Bill can explain this to everyone) I also added a little more bbq sauce and ketchup.  It was a little dry, but it was very tasty.  I recommend serving with gravy.  My picky 3 year old loved it.

this was off the hook! my boyfriend and i don't eat red meat, and he couldn't believe it wasn't beef! the top of it was kinda ugly, so i made a little red sauce to go on top like my mama used to. looked and tasted just like hers, too!

this was alot better than I honestly expected!!  I did change the recipe to 12 servings instead of 6 (2lb ground chicken, etc), kept the stuffing (I used stove top) whole instead of crushing it and used.... GRAVY instead of bbq sauce in the loaf and on top before baking..  very good and got great reviews from friends on this, will make again :)

Very good. I was a little apprehensive to make since I've tried a turkey loaf and was not a fan. However the seasonings were great. I would make this again. Followed exactly.

Super recipe!  I love meatloaf, but my wife doesn't eat beef, so I never get to have any.  I made this (my wife didn't want me to at first), and she loved it.  So did I!

I didn't have stuffing mix, so I took salad croutons, and ground them up in the food processor to make 2/3 cup.  To this, I mixed 1/2 tsp of sage, to give the crumbs flavour.  It was superb!!!

This is the first review I have left and I felt like I had to sqy something. The idea is good but this really doesn't taste good. I made it and my son who will eat anything ate it but I think to make me feel good. There was plenty left over and no takers for leftovers. I followed the recipe exactly.

This is SO good!    I did make one substitution as I didn't have stuffing mix on hand - used oatmeal and a bit of sage instead, but it was still very yummy and a good texture.  MY PICKY KIDS ATE IT AND ASKED FOR SECONDS!  (I don't think they've ever asked for seconds on anything but pizza, so this is saying a LOT.)  We'll be adding this to our regular rotation!

Best meatloaf I've ever had. Everytime I make it people are amazed when I tell them it's chicken. Leftovers of this also makes incredible cold sandwiches.

Everone in my house loved this dish.  There were even fights over the leftovers.  I made it without any substitutions and it turned out great, not dry at all!  (I did use cheap ground chicken, so it may have had more fat in the meat to start with)

Excellent recipe!  I was searching for something to make with my ground chicken and found this recipe.  I absolutely loved it.  Would not change anything...although I did add about 1 teaspoon of brown sugar to the mix and on top.  Very good.  It was nice and dry too.  I hate mushy, wet meatloaf!  I highly recommend this recipe!

Although it doesn't look like its done cooking, it
tastes great. My husband doesn't eat red meat, and this was wonderful! I finally got the "meatloaf" I've been wanting for a while now!

My family loved the dish! This was my firt meatload and it turned out amazing! The only thing I did different was I used chicken and herb stove top stuffing as my bread crumbs. This added a ton of flavor as well as topping with cooked apples.

I made this as is except for using some onion powder instead of onion - personal preference.  It had a good flavor, but the thing I didn't like was that it had a bit of a rubbery texture that was odd.  Well, I didn't totally dislike it or I wouldn't be giving a 4, but it did kind of lower the level for me.  It isn't something about being different than beef or something, cause rather than this being "a nice change" from beef, for me beef is the change cause I use chicken and turkey a lot.  I don't recall anything having that texture.  Dunno.  But otherwise good.

This recipe was really good. I didn't have BBQ sauce, so I subsituted steak sauce. We had to put some ketchup on it for a little additional flavor and I had to add some salt for my own personal preference, but it was very tasty!

We really enjoyed this.  Made two small changes - used all bbq instead of 1/2 ketchup, and baked in a muffin tin - that way it bakes faster + you get more of those great crispy edges.  Thanks Sal!

I made the recipe as written.  I wasn't so sure of this recipe when I took my first bite since it is a bit different than meatloaf and even turkeyloaf but I quickly took to the taste and now it is my favorite over the other two.  Leftovers are great too!!

This tasted amazing!  I made some slight modifications to the recipe:  I added about 1/2 can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese to the mixture, a clove of crushed garlic, and put a blend of ketchup, BBQ sauce and brown sugar spreaded on the top, prior to baking so that the top would brown nicely and have a sweet & savory taste.  It was delicious and I can't wait to make it again!  It was so easy!

Delicious!! Great alternative to the traditional meatloaf. I substituted cheddar for parmesan and brushed the top with some BBQ sauce.My whole family loved it. I will definitely make this again.

I was looking for something different to do with ground chicken instead of using ground beef (watching my weight) and I made this last night. One word sums it up! AWESOME!! Thank you Sal for posting this recipe! I would have never thought to make this using the ingredients you put together. The only thing I did different and NOT that I did it to make it different, I only had egg whites (in the carton) and used the amount to equal two eggs, and I had leftover wheatbread Stove Top stuffing which was moist instead of dry. Not sure if using moist stuffing made the meatloaf more moist but I suppose it didn't hurt. My husband thought it was delicious and this meatloaf will be a regular menu item in my househould going forward!

This was just ok - could have been better if not so dry. I put some ketchup and BBQ on top so that part was good. I also put them in my muffin pans to make individual servings. I think next time I will add more ketchup to the mix...

Superb! I have recently been diagnosed with diabetes and every knid of arthritis imaginable, so ahve to be careful of my diet. This is quick, easy, and delicious. I do make my own stuffing (have never used packet stuff) and as barbecue sauce is not in my larder, I use either worcestershire sauce, or when the dearly beloved isn't looking, Tabasco Chipotle sauce. Also found a finely chopped sweet red pepper works well. Always moist, and good hot or cold.

This turned out great. I ground my own chicken using breast meat only. So I was worried that it would turn out dry. As a result, I used a couple of dashes of soy sauce in place of salt. Everything else was the same. Will definitely make again. So delicious!

Substituted turkey in because my grocery store doesn't carry ground chicken and I was worried that it wouldn't turn out as good but it was delicious!  We LOVED it!

My husband loved this recipe, and he doesn't normally like meatloaf.  I really just eyeballed the ingredients and it came out perfectly.

I had bought extra lean ground chicken and needed to find something to do with it.  I liked this recipe alot since it was easy to make then in the oven in goes.  I put breadcrumbs too, a little more onion (love onion!)  a little bit of curry powder, and a little bit of hot sauce instead of bbq.  nice and moist.  didn't do any glazings though as others suggested... may try dijon next time around - i'm definately putting this one in my recipe box!

This was really good! I added a little green pepper and cut down the amount of onion. I made a glaze to go on the top of ketchup, bbq sauce, and brown sugar. Next time I will put bacon on top!!

Tasty and my picky husband even liked it.  I gave it four stars because mine came out a little dry.  Should have removed from oven 8-10 minutes after turning oven off.

This recipe was SO good. My changes were minimal. I added an extra egg like other reviewers suggested, and topped it with a ketchup and brown sugar glaze during the last 20 minutes of cooking. I also used Stovetop Chicken flavored dresssing since it was all I had. I and my sister enjoyed it very much...I can't wait to get hoome and eat some more!!

I followed the recipe, but added garlic powder with parsley.  I ended up adding some water and covering it in a casserole dish because it was drying out pretty fast during cooking.  The end result was interesting...my husband gave a thumbs down...I liked it and thought it very flavorful. The only thing I would change is to add some additional "moisture", because it was a bit dry. The leftovers warmed up well!

I used onion powder instead of chopped onions.  It turned out well.  My 3 and 2 year old both ate it with out complaints.  Next time I will use more seasoning.

I don't know what I was expecting but it definately wasn't my cup of tea. I was miffed that I used good ground chicken for this recipe. Should have just fried it up and made a sauce and served it with spaghetti noodles. Edible, yes. Fix again, no.

Thankyou Sara. This is the first recipe that had my 5 year old and husband fighting over the left-overs.My husband wants this as a fort-nightly fixture!I added two eggs as suggested by other readers, minced the onion, and used fresh breadcrumbs seasoned with parsley and thyme as I didn't have herb stuffing on hand. I also added one teasp minced garlic. It turned out great.

My entire family enjoyed this, inlcuding my 2 year old, who had seconds and the leftovers for lunch the next day.  I did add an extra egg for a bit more moisture.  I also did have the stuffing mix, so I used bread crumbs.  It can out yummy!

I had never made any type of "meatloaf" before and since I like to use ground chicken in place of ground beef, this recipe was one I wanted to try.  This recipe is great! I followed the directions exactly, but did follow other users suggestion of putting a ketchup/bbq sauce glaze on.  Next time I may add some green onions for colour, but other than that, it needs nothing else.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this tonight, and it was a hit! I didn't have all the ingredients so my substitutions were Butter and Garlic croutons for the stuffing, garlic salt in place of regular salt and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce for the BBQ sauce. I also used two eggs, and cut down the "oven off" time to about 7 minutes. Oh and I omitted the onion...mainly because I didn't feel like chopping any up. There was still enough moisture in the loaf that I didn't need to add a glaze to the top. This will definitely be added to the rotation for sure!

Also used 2 large cloves of fresh garlic & fresh cracked pepper instead of garlic pepper. Easy & Yumm!

Used cornbread stuffing mix instead of herb. Added 1 tsp Mrs Dash Original Blend. BBQ sauce was Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicey. Perfectly moist, super easy to make. Will make again! Thanks!

This was actually really good! I didn't have any herb stuffing mix, nor did I have garlic pepper. So I took about a third of a package of crackers, crushed them up and threw in a mix of seasonings (sage, garlic powder, and a lemon/thyme/basil) mix and it worked out really well! Next time I make it I will probably use a half to 3/4 a cup of onion because there seemed to be a lot of onion in every bite, and it was just a bit too much for me. OH, and I also added about a half a cup of diced green pepper for color and kicks and was really happy with that addition.

Surprisingly moist but not soggy.  My husband, daughter & Dad all said it was excellent.  Dad wanted to make sure there would be leftovers for his lunch tomorrow. My husband liked it a lot but really wants to try it with a gravy. Thanks sal enjoyed this.

Not as good as I expected. Not exactly "spiced" as the title implies. Needed a good gravy or sauce to go with it to make it really good. But a good basic loaf nonetheless.

If I could, I would give this recipe 4.5 stars - it's really easy, very tasty, and good for you! I usually substitute the stuffing mix for breadcrumbs, as I always have breadcrumbs on-hand - and add some red pepper flakes for a little spice. This one is a staple in my weeknight recipe repertoire!

I am not a fan of ground chicken, but this was really good!! My family loved it. I doubled the recipe and added 1 cup chopped celery and substituted egg beaters for the eggs (1/3 cup per egg). Thanks! It was a nice change, I think I may use the stuffing idea for regular meat loaf and see how it turns out.

That was sooo great!  It was super fast and easy to make - I had it in the oven before my husband even knew I'd been making dinner.  I (of course) added some things: a lot of garlic powder and a garlic and herb mix, but otherwise, I followed the recipe, and it turned out perfectly.  This one is definitely going to be one I make a lot. Even my picky son liked this one.  Five starts from this cook!  Thanks so much.

This was VERY good.  I doubled the recipe and probably added a bit more than double the cheese.  Browned it under the broiler for a couple of minutes after it was done cooking.  Everyone liked it a lot, including one child who is not normally a meatloaf eater.

WOW!!! This was a home run at our house! I followed the recipe, less the garlic pepper. But, I did put a ketchup, dijon, and brown sugar glaze, as suggested by others. I mean, this was just amazing- so moist, so much flavor- thank you SO much for this recipe!

OH WOW!! This was so good. Maybe too moist, but still good. I substituted regular breadcrumbs and I did a ketchup/brown sugar glaze about 20 mins before the end of cooking time. Not at start.

This recipe is great! I will definitely be making again. And again.

This was awesome! Made it for my mother-in-law and husband and we all really enjoyed it. I did not use onions, but followed everything else, just added some onion powder. It was juicy, it was flavorful, and it was super easy to make. This is a great way to use ground chicken, and I will be making it again really soon.

I think this recipe has potential.  I hesitated to follow the directions, but I did, just to see how it would come out.  It wasn't 'bad', but I didn't want to eat it.  I think it would taste SO much better without the ketchup and barbeque sauce.  I'm going to try it one more time with some changes.

Great recipe! I don't LOVE cooking the way some people do so I look for few ingredients, quick prep and easy to cook. THis recipe was exactly that. took about 10 minutes to prep- oven did the rest. I did change the recipe a little by adding less onions, whole wheat chicken stuffing and a 5 Italian cheese blend instead.

this was good.  my 7 year old loved it--she ate every bite and asked for more.  my husband had seconds as well.  i have never had anything made with ground chicken that i actually liked before this.  i made it exactly according to the recipe, except my package of ground chicken was only .75 pounds and i added a splash of water to make sure it wasn't too dry.  the edges and bottom got a little too brown, so next time i'll watch it and take it out a little earlier.

Excellent!  Very moist and flavorful.  Everyone in the family loved it.  I used Mushroom and Onion Stovetop stuffing mix instead of the herb stuffing.  This recipe is one I will make often.

Loved it!!! Delicious cold as well as hot. I made it with Turkey Mince as minced Chicken wasn't available in my Supermarket.I have made with the stuffing from the recipe and also with  Chestnut and Cranberry Stuffing. Both worked very well but 2 very diffrent flavours. I have recommended this recipe to sooo many people. Simple and quick to prepare.

This was really tasty! It was super moist. I chopped the onions really fine by placing them in a handheld chopper attachment and that really ground the onions so that you don't get bits of undercooked onion and it also added to the moistness. I would also use less salt next time depending on the type of herbed breadcrumbs.

I was impressed!  I'd bought some ground chicken on sale and needed to find a use for it.  Honestly, I didn't expect this to have much flavor but it did.  My husband really liked it too.  I added some BBQ/ketchup on top as others suggested.  Delish!

This was a nice change from the regular, old meatloaf. I'm not a big onion fan, so I substitued and I think that made it a bit dry, so I may add a second egg next time. I used the tabasco ketchup that's out now and that added some good flavor. I will make this again and experiment a bit. Thanks.

This was really good, I added 1 more egg and it was not dry at all. Topped the loaf with a little more sauce before putting it in the oven and it was zesty. I will make it again soon.

This was so surprisingly great!  Was not dry at all.  We added about 1/4 cup habanero cheddar, which I think kept it moist.  It's super hot though, so be careful.  We used dried breadcrumbs instead of stuffing mix and added minced shallot, garlic and green onion as well.  Also made a bbq/ketchup mix for top...thanx for the suggestion.  We were a little skeptical, but it really was fantastic and we'll definitely make again.

This is receiving 3 stars only because it was easy too make and my toddler actually ate 5 bites of it.  The rest of our family politely refused to finish their portions.  I read all reviews and incorporated the updates and revisions and it was so....BLAH.

I had some ground chicken on hand and decided that this would be a nice change from ground beef. I was afraid of the recipe ending up dry, so I added 1/4 cup of chicken broth which I found really made gave the loaf moisture at the end of cooking as well as adding some flavour. I didn't have an onion on hand, so I substituted onion flakes, which turned out just fine.
Overall a good recipe that I will make again.

Great base recipe to play with. I made it with 2lbs ground chicken(lots of left overs!) upped the stuffing to a cup, then added minced red bell pepper and a small zucchini (shredded) for extra veggies and to keep it moist! Oh I also add a few T. of steak sauce to give it more of my original meatloaf flavor

Everyone in the house loved this recipe. The only thing I will do next time is to decrease the stuffing mix - it was a bit sweet. And the loaf even tastes great the next day. This recipe is a keeper.

This was a great new way to cook chicken.  I had way to many onions though.  Next time I will use less :)

This was really very tasty. My husband and I both enjoyed it. It tasted even better the next day for lunch! I made it without the onions but next time I think I will try it with sauteed onions and only 1/8 c. cheese to cut out some of the fat and see if it is still as flavorful.

A nice change from ground beef or ground turkey.  First time cooking with ground chicken and found this to be very tasty.  My young niece and nephew loved it..especially with EXTRA sauce on the top of the loaf.

It was better than I thought.  It needs some gravy and it would be great.  Hubby liked, which is rare.  He is very picky.

This came out really good for me.  I used a few shakes of the dry onion flakes though as I didn't have a whole onion.  I also put a mixture of ketchup and bulls-eye bbq sauce on the top of it before baking and I sprinkled some brown sugar.  I also used the chicken flavored stuffing mix.  I'm not really a meatloaf person, but this was pretty good.

My husband is a big meat loaf lover, but my daughter will not eat red meat.
This recipe pleased them both!
It was moist and tasty.
At first my husband was hesitant to try a chicken meatloaf, but he was pleasantly surprised!
This one will be a regular in our house from now on!
