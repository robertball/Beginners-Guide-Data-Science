This recipe is not for beginners -- my aunt gave me this recipe when I was a young mom, and I couldn't get them to turn out right -- I really thought she had left things out!  She was famous for her whoopie pies.

If you are having trouble with it, here is how I do it, and mine come out great.  Use a good hand mixer to beat everything.  

Sift your dry ingredients, beat the sugar, shortening and eggs thoroughly, and add in the dry ingredients and boiling water alternately in at least four batches, beating thoroughly after each addition - this means beating at least two minutes with a mixer nine or ten separate times.  If this isn't done, the dough will be lumpy.

Put it on a baking sheet in small amounts:  I use a heaping teaspoon for mine.  That will make a pie that is the size of an english muffin.  Don't grease the sheet or the edges will be crispy.  Use a metal spatula to carefully scrape them off the sheet.  Scrape the sheet between batches.  Take them off the sheet to cool as soon as they come out of the oven.

For the filling, beating is again the key.  I use a small wire whisk for beating and cooking the milk and flour.  I hold the pan on its edge over the heat and beat the milk and flour the entire time I'm cooking.  When finished, it's the consistency of pudding.  If you go thicker, or don't beat it, your filling will be lumpy.  Cool it on the stove until it's not warm enough to melt the shortening.  Don't chill it in the fridge.  If you make it while you're baking

Incredible!  Very rich, so make sure you don't make the cookies too large.  I have made this recipe a number of times, and have always had success.  One thing, however, is that the 2nd listing of "1 cup milk" is unneccessary, as the directions only specify using 1 cup of milk total, and that's in the filling (it would be too runny if both cups of milk were used).

I gave it four stars for the cake part but the creme was filled with way too much shortening. I made my own creme filling and after that they were great. I recommend the cake part for sure.

Very good recipe - especially since we have a raw egg allergy and many of the other recipes call for egg whites in the filling.    I've made the recipe twice now and I've used unsalted butter in place of shortening and have not had any issues with the frosting or cake.  Also, the cake part rises much more if you let the batter sit a few minutes on the baking sheet before setting it in the oven.

This recipe is very close to the one handed down from my mother in law, who has now deceased. The only change is instead of granulated sugar in the icing, you should use powdered sugar so it doesn't come out grainy. This recipe has to be followed to the letter. Other reviewers that had lumps or problems probably didn't follow the amounts correctly. It is hard to add that much shortening to it... but you have to in order to make GOBS!

I followed the exact directions for this recipe and used teaspoon size drops of batter on a lightly greased cookie sheet and they came out very tiny and lumpy. They never puffed or smoothed out. The filling was lumpy too. They did taste good but not a very good appealing presentation.

Do you know that 1 cup of milk is listed twice as an ingredient, but only mentioned once in the directions? I didn't know whether or not to put the cup of milk in both the cookies and the filling. Finally, I did add it to the cookie batter, which was way too thick. But then it was thin adn runny, like cake batter. So, after adding 1 more cup of flour, it was perfect. Made wonderfull whoopie pies,(gobs, I've always called them).

These tasted very good but like another reviewer, the cookies turned out lumpy.  The batter was nice and smooth and mixed properly when it went on the sheet, they just didn't smooth out well.  Good taste, though.

Taste was great. They did not turn out well otherwise. They were nothing like the ones I used to eat at family picnics in PA. They were not smooth after they were baked and did not spread out. I followed the directions closely and double checked myself. The cookie I wanted was the one in the picture. Dissapointed it wasn't what I got.

Absolutely delicious!!!! Reminds me of home in PA... The people of Virginia have never heard of such a thing, but they will now! I just sent an entire tray to my son's classroom. It's sure to become a trend. :) YAY!

We made this yesterday and followed the recipe to the "T". It was really bad, the cream was not tasty. The cookies were so heavy and hard. I bake and cook all the time and this was not a recipe I would want to do again. My husband who eats everything didn't like them and that is a bad thing.

I dont know what went wrong here...WAY TOO MUCH FLOUR!!! I even got my grandmother to check everything I measured and she said that it was all correct. The boiling water turned my cake batter to rubber cement...WITH LUMPS!!! They didn's spread, puff, or fully cook, for that matter, in any way. I knew something was wrong as soon as I started adding the flour (too much) so I added more boiling water (which I missed the point of using it anyway) and it got worse!!! Highly inaccurate and very involved to the point where even if they did work out, the mediocre ingredients would have provided not satisfaction whatsoever.

I am originally from ME and trust me this is more like the original recipe then any other on this site.  This filling is the best.  I have had this with a frosting type and it is just NOT the same at all.  I have made whoopee pies for many  and they all love this.  If I could give this a 10+ I would.  My recipe for the cake itself is a little different but I will not redo this recipe as it was submitted that is not fair to the person who submitted it.  If I made any adjustments I would submit my own recipe.  All I can say is the longer you beat this filling the better it becomes.

These whoopie pies turned out ok. They were not as moist as what I was looking for but I did not add the extra 1 cup of milk that is omitted from the directions.  It would be good if the recipe were corrected if the milk is necessary.  I used my pampered chef cookie drop to get uniformity on the pan and they spread fine but I felt they were a little hard when they came out of the oven. Possibly due to the high temperature. I only cooked for 5-6 minutes and removed them promptly. They actually have some added moister a couple of days later since I individually wrapped them in saran wrap. I'm still searching for the perfect moist whoopie pie like my Mom made.

These are amazing!  I only used the cake part of the recipe, but I am sure it was as good.  I made a half recipe, but I am finding out that I will need to make more soon!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!
