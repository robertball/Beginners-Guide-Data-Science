my mil use to make these all the times at the cottage.  I made a few changes to be the same as hers.  In the topping, 2 egg whites, instead of 1, add 1/2 c. coconut.  She also didn't use any vanilla, but I do.  Everyone raves about how good these are.

Very tasty, and quick and easy to make. I have one problem though: sometimes the meringue on the top stays soft after baking (still being delicious).

These are excellent!!! My Mom used to bake these and included them in her Cookie Gifts to neighbors and friends.  They are not overly sweet,  and have a delightful taste of both chewy (bottom layer)  and crunchy (top layer.)  Thanks for posting.

These were OK.  I first made the mistake of letting everyone sample while still warm and the smell of the freshly baked egg white mixture on top really put us off, so I set them aside and they were much better the next day.

I don't usually write a review if I changed anything, but this recipe deserves the publicity. OMG! Chewy crunchy sweet goodness! The whole family can't stop eating them. All I changed was substituted coconut flavoring for the vanilla, and added coconut to the meringue before spreading it on. Because, well, I had coconut I wanted to use up and another reviewer recommended it. 100% will make again. Totally worth the calories.

Too good, kept sneaking pieces while my kids werenâ€™t looking!
