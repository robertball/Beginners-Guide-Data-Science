I liked the flavors in this but I was not a fan of the eggplant itself.  I think it would have been far better if the eggplant was breaded and fried- as-is it was somewhat mushy and unpleasant.  We still enjoyed the flavors and the red peppers and goat cheese.  For a heartier dish, I think browned ground Italian sausage would have been a nice addition.
