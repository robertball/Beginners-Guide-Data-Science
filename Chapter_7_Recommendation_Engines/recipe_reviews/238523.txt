I picked this recipe even though it had only a few reviews because I needed something high in fiber and protein that even my rambunctious 15 month old would eat and an easy reheat meal.  It's wonderful!  It was a little heavy on cilantro, but I wasn't even turned off by it.  People who don't care for that taste in every bite should probably cut the amount to 3/4 or even half a bunch.  I made do with just ground cinnamon.  I HIGHLY recommend the optional quinoa (note: it does absorb a lot of the broth so you may want to add 2 more cups of stock after adding the quinoa), and I added hot kielbasa sausage for my Hunny, which I sautéed with the onions, and the sausage soaked up the flavors of the spices and broth rather than staying hot.  Next time I might consider adding chopped spinach for the sake of some green nutrition because I think the other flavors would easily mask that bitter "green" taste some people dislike (like my toddler ;).  This is such a great staple to have in my recipe box that I can add to and modify as I like.

Great recipe!  Tastes very similar to a version served in a restaurant near me.  Substituted vegetable stock for the beef stock (I'm vegan) and used cinnamon powder in place of the cinnamon sticks.  Added minced garlic cloves to mine.  My two year old ate it better than my 4 and 6, but was like by all

Meat Addition review: I was looking for a 15 bean soup recipe and found this gem. I added 2 lbs of Italian pork sausage (because that's what I had) cooked up with spices and the onion. I added fresh green beans cut into 1/4 inch pieces, corn and fresh tomatoes along with 2 cups of dry mixed lentils and no canned beans. I didn't add quinoa, because I didn't have any on hand right now, but love the cilantro in it. This is a great base recipe, you can leave it as is or add to it as you want to. I would have liked to have some seasoned diced tomatoes in the pantry, but the fresh turned out fine (and are healthier, too). I had limes, in lieu of lemons, and squeezed them on top, but lemon would probably give better flavor to this recipe. I'm going to add a dallop of sour cream to mine... Either way, it's hard to go wrong. Mine is good, but I look forward to trying this again when I have more of the original recipe ingredients on hand. Don't be afraid to mix it up!

used slow cooker. Low for 5 hrs. 
added 1.5 lb of stew meat that my family desired. ground ginger spice, not fresh. and 1  cup cooked quinoa. This taste is unique to my midwest meat and potatoes family. but everybody ate it. nobody gagged. I loved it.

We substituted vegetable stock for the beef stock, and then needed to add more salt.  Loved the spices in this.

Delicious! I omitted the tomatoes (because I hate tomatoes), used vegetable stock, and put just a tiny sprinkle of ground cinnamon instead of a stick. This has unique flavor, easy to make it vegetarian/vegan, and is so filling. Defiantly a keeper!!

I thought it was delicious, flavorful and hearty.  The quinoa adds a complete protein and substance so it kept me feeling satisfied.  I doubled the recipe and added a pound of stew meat.  Next time, I'll make the recipe as provided because I don't think the soup needed it.  

My one disappointment was my wife and adult children would not try it because, I think, the spices were too exotic for them.

Great soup and very easy to prepare. I didn't have any cilantro but luckily added some after cooking.  Cilantro really makes the soup.

This dish was just okay. It has taste, but it was lacking, so I added a large cloves of garlic and extra 1/2 tsp of cumin. It helped and tasted better the next day.

Good recipe.    Next time I’ll go for a little less cilantro.     Wish it had a little more spice to it overall.     I guess I was spoiled last week while vacationing in Morocco!

I omitted the kidney beans.  I used veggie Field Roast link sausages.  This is a very good and spicy dish.  I cooked dried chickpeas.   Prep time is extensive.  Overall,  we all liked it.

I tried to stick to the recipe though I used mushroom broth to keep it vegan/vegetarian. I also didn’t read the instructions clearly and added the fresh herbs after the 45min. To compensate, I kept it on simmer for an extra 15min. This is a lot of cilantro, but it is such a wonderful recipe. It tastes so fresh but is so hearty and really cost-effective. I don’t mind the cilantro at all but it would be overpowering for those who don’t like it. I’ll definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious as is and forgiving if substituting ingredients!!!
I made this in my crockpot instead of as recipe stated.
Didn't have onions, so I used lots of dried onion instead.
I used veggie broth.
I threw in a chopped uncooked sweet potato that I had lying around because 'why not'?
In the crockpot on HI for about 1.5-2hrs, PERFECT. (I still made the quinoa on the side, as recipe indicates).
We will be making this again. So easy, filling, healthy and yummy flavors.

Very tasty. I suggest using a *small* bunch of cilantro; otherwise, the flavor overpowers the other ingredients.
