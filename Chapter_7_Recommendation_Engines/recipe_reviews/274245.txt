This is a pretty tasty way to eat chicken breasts! I adjusted the salt and pepper to taste and added a bit more mustard too (I really like a strong mustardy flavor). If I had one minor critique it would be in the addition of the heavy cream early on in the sauce. Letting the heavy cream boil made the sauce break a bit--so in the future I would add it at the end of the cook time instead. My chicken breasts were also kinda big so they took longer than the time listed to cook. Other than that this is a delicious chicken dish! Thank you for the recipe!

Very yummy and super simple! Ended up having to sub hazelnut coffee cream for the 2 teaspoons of heavy cream and it worked out wonderfully.

You have to watch the chicken very close. It will become dry fast. Second time I used more chicken broth and heavy cream and it was much better.

Too sweet. Didn t think that small amount of syrup had that much power!
