Fantastic! Since I'm a garlic fiend, I added some garlic and a teeny bit of onion powder to the mixture as well. More than likely because I didn't have the proper chipotle sauce: either way, it came out terrific!

i used horseradish instead of chipotle sauce- good stuff- needs more horseradish though.
