I've made this recipe twice now, the first time i made is exactally as the recipe states but found the bottom cake layer to be bland and too dense for my liking. The mousse part on the other hand was to die for. So, the second time I attempted to use brownie mix for the bottom layer and everything else remained the same. OMGOSH.. it was like eating a slice of heaven... i got soooo many compliments on it. I'm making it again today to bring to a dinner party with a few friends... I can't wait till dessert!

This cake is really elegant however DO NOT try to make it without a springform
 pan. I tried to just mold the moose onto the cake after the moose set and let's 
just say it wasn't pretty. The ganache was not smooth and it squished everywhere.

This recipe was a big let down. The bottom cake was tasteless, and didn't mesh with the texture of the mousse. I think it really needed a crust with more crunch. The mousse itself was incredibly rich, but it didn't offer much else. Just a poor combination of flavors and textures in my opinion.

This cake may be a little labor intensive, but it is well worth the effort.  Not only is it a beautiful cake, but the taste is to die for.  It really does need to set for 1-2 days in the fridge so that it is firm enough.  I made this for Thanksgiving and my family fell in love!

I tried this recipe twice, the first time the mousse was too runny .the second time I reduced the water to 1/3 cup and it was perfect. I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.

OH MY GOODNESS! This was DELICIOUS!!! I used this recipe for a formal dinner party and my guests were absolutely raving. I was even asked if I catered professionally. It did take a lot of time and chocolate but was definitely worth it. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is outstanding...I have made this twice...the first time, I made it and stuck it right in the freezer after assembling because I was making a ton of food for a party, and the mousse didn't set properly but still received rave reviews...the second time, I left in the fridge for two days according to the instructions, and it set up perfectly.  For the second time, I followed another reviewers suggestion, and used a brownie bottom, and used the Chocolate Ganache recipe posted by another on this site http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chocolate-Ganache/Detail.aspx and it was divine.  I made the ganache and poured it on the cake after it sat in the fridge for the two days, and then popped the whole thing in the freezer again until the weekend (for another party).  Thank you Kristen...everyone said this was as good as or better than any bakery cake they've had.  I would give it 10 stars if I could for all the accolades I received on this.  It is SO rich...I need to brush my teeth immediately after eating.

It is really rich, so don't over estimate what you can eat, but it is sooo amazingly good! Some people who tried it with me thought a basic brownie on the bottom would be tastier than the crust here because this crust recipe is a tad oily tasting. I will try something different on the bottom, but the mousse is amazing! I also froze it for a couple weeks with no problems. The crust was just a bit hard to cut until it thawed, but the mousse was perfect frozen or thawed.

This is delicious but I do agree with the other commenters who say the cake base is too dense.  I think it would be find if it was about half as thick, as it wouldn't overpower the mousse that way and would still be thick enough to hold up the rest of the cake.  That or I really like the idea about the brownie as the base.

The mousse part was quite tasty but did not have a mousse texture. It was more like straight whipped cream in substance. The cake part was just weird. We ended up scooping the top to use as an ice cream topping and tossing out the cake. Sorry, can't recommend this one.

I substituted bittersweet chocolate for the mousse b/c we prefer a slightly less sweet chocolate taste.  While the taste was wonderfully rich, I would recommend either more thorough instructions for making the mousse or advise the baker to read up on the trad French method.  In my attempt to reduce the risk of salmonella, I kept the chocolate mixture over heat, which basically deflated all of the air in my egg whites when I folded them in.  I have since educated myself on this, so I won't make the same mistake. Oh, and definitely leave yourself the 2 days for this to set...maybe adding a bit of cream of tartar to your egg whites may help in stabilizing them.

Amazing. Yes to the box brownie recipe, worked well. I could have gotten away with halving the ganache part, I ended up with lots left over.  However I ended up just dipping pretzels in it after so...there you go. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was time consuming, but you could tell it was going to be delicious as it's being made.  Sadly, I couldn't get mine to set after 1 1/2 days.  It was a mess to serve, but still got compliments.  Not sure that I'll try it again though for all of the effort that went into it.  Mind you I'm a novice baker!

I was making this for a friends birthday and didn't have ENOUGH TIME to have this set as directed. SOOO... I beat the eggs extra extra dry. (very very stiff peaks)and then followed the recipe otherwise as directed but only let it set for 8 hours.  It set fine and was fabulous...I do strongly recomend letting it sit overnight if possible, it does make it that much better.  
We had dinner at a very upscale european restaurant and brought this in for the dessert (we knew the owners) All at our table, as well as the servers and chef where very impressed. When they served it to us they had it in promenant area of the restaurant and they said they had other table request it too.

I made this cake for Valentine's Day and I am going to make it again for Thanksgiving. It takes a lot of baking skill to get this to come out just right and if you don't have patience for baking this is not the recipe for you. Otherwise this is a great cake that has great texture and isn't too sweet.

This cake is so delicious! Even though it is time consuming to make, it is not difficult  and it's worth the effort. I made it three times and the only negative feedback I got was that the bottom crust was a little tough but the mousse is perfect! I don't know if it would hold up with a chocolate cookie or graham cracker crust because it weighs so much but that might be softer alternatives. It does require the full time of setting but then you can brag that the cake took you three days to make. Also, make sure to put it back in the fridge after cutting. It begins to sag if left out too long.

In the direction, step 4 indicates to set for 1 to 2 days. I wonder if this is a typo or real. If it's real, why such a long time before the cake is ready. Any reason? The taste was OK.

Rich and delicious! I took the advice of the other reviewers and used a Ghiardelli box brownie mix for the base because I wanted to save myself some work and time. The mousse and ganache were very good. I used blanched slivered almonds for the garnish instead of walnuts.

OK, first my changes: I did not use the cake recipe provided, as I saw some comments about it being dry etc. Instead I used my traditional go-to chocolate cake recipe (can be found on this website as Vegan Chocolate Cake) and halved it. The result was a little thick, but soooo moist. I also substituted margarine for the butter, which I was nervous about, and I only had around 1 cup of whipping cream. And I used the chocolate chips that I had lying  around, nothing high quality. And the results... delicious! I made it for a dinner party that we were having and my guests were completely blown away. They did not believe that it was home made. It probably would have been better with a higher qualty chocolate, but the combination of cake and mousse was really divine.  I didn't have the time to make the ganache, so I just shaved some white chocolate onto the center. It was great!!! Also, I did not have time to leave it in the fridge for 2 whole days, it was n probably for like 18 hrs, and it definitely would have been better having set for the full time, it lacked the firmness that restaurant cakes have.  But none of my guests seemed to mind the creaminess, it got rave reviews!!! Will be making again!!!

The mousse part is delicious, but the cake part is rather bland. I would recommend making the base out of a brownie or cake mix (you will probably only need to use half of the box), and making the mousse as directed. Also, I didn't like the idea of using raw eggs in the mousse so I melted the butter with the egg yolks over the stove until it came to its safe temp (160 degrees), and then continued to make it as directed. I also used pasteurized egg whites. This worked out well, just make sure you don't scramble the eggs!

FAB!!!  Definitely must let sit for 2days in order to set up correctly!!!  Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful...just like a terrific choc mousse cake from a fancy restaurant!!!  As a short side note, when I first removed the base layer cake from the oven, I thought....oooooohhh not good.  But in the end, it is 'just right' after the mousse sits on it for a couple of days.  Happy baking!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and was most unhappy with the results. The cake part was rubbery and flat. The mousse part wasn't set enough after a full day. Although the mousse tasted good, I would expect it to not only taste good but be firm enough to cut and serve as required of a cake.

This mousse is quite wonderful.  Not too chocolaty and not too creamy.  I was rather disappointed with the cake however.  It was flat, and tasted - um - flat.  I wouldn't make the cake again, but I'll be mixing up the mousse.   
PS There sure is ALOT of egg needed!

I used my own chocolate fudge cake recipe for the base.  I made enough for one layer, then cut that layer in half horizontally and just used the bottom half for the cake.  I added 1 teaspoon cream of tartar to the egg whites to stabilize the mousse. Lastly, I used chocolate cookie crumbs in place of the chopped nuts. Everyone loved it!

This recipe wasn't hard to make - just time consuming. The "cake" portion isn't all that great, but the mousse is AWESOME! It's a very heavy cake and a little goes a long way. 
Just make sure you have the time to let the cake "set up". I failed to see this part of the recipe and while I gave it 24 hrs - it probably would have been better with 48h.

This recipe was very good, however, it calls for 1 cup hot, brewed coffee.  Since I cannot have that, I was wondering what I could use in its place and still reseve the awesome flavor?

This cake was rich but also light and smooth.  I made it two days ahead of time but it still didn't set up when I removed the sides of the springform pan.  I had an 8-inch or 10-inch springform pan so I used the smaller one.  Maybe I should have used the larger one so it wasn't so thick.  Otherwise, the flavor was great!
