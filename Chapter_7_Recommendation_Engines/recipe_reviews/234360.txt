I modified- that's why only 3 stars. I sliced up 2 pieces of bacon and fried until crisp then removed from the pan. Used the drippings, omitting the butter and added 1/2 med sliced onion with the cabbage, cooked as directed then added bacon back in. Instead of red wine used water, instead of red wine vinegar used apple cider vinegar, only 1T. sugar and omitted the caraway. I cooked out all the water and continued a bit more, watching and stirring until slightly browned. EXCELLENT! Also can be green or red cabbage.

This was a fantastic side dish to make & I highly recommend it. I did substitute honey for the white sugar as we don't use processed white sugar. I also omitted the Caraway upon the suggestion of another reviewer; I don't care for the taste.
My family & friends raved over this side. It's a definite keeper for family meals & it has been added to our regular recipe rotation. This was served as a side to go with fish.

Sweet memories of home. My Mother made cabbage this way with Caraway seed which I did today. If I had an apple I would slice and add that as that is what Mom did. Thanks Chef!

Great easy basic recipe that can be modified in many ways. I followed the recipe as is this time but will play with it in the future.

The recipe was simple. I did not add sugar. Husband and I did not care for the caraway seed in this. Next time, I will omit the caraway seed and add some sliced onions. Overall, not a bad recipe.

Tasted great! Followed it exactly and loved the taste. But it took forever. 30 minutes plus, and everything else was cold by the time it was done.

I made this but I did chop 1 medium yellow onion and I peeled and chopped a small granny smith apple and sauteed these first, then followed the recipe. I used a splash more of red wine vinegar and two extra tsp of brown sugar. It came out so very good.

I messed this up, but I'm giving it 5 stars anyway because if I had done it right, I would have enjoyed it.  I'll try fixing the leftovers tomorrow by adding more sugar.  I doubled the liquid but didn't double the sugar and it wasn't sweet enough - if I had doubled everything else, I'm sure it would have been perfect.  Great recipe, thanks!!

I had leftover red cabbage from fish tacos, so built the meal around this recipe. For the people who watched the video, you'll learn that add-ins are totally cool with this recipe, AND that the pinch of caraway seeds is very small. I added a shallot and two apples. I wanted to add a jalapeno, but chickened out. Followed the recipe as directed, and decided on a little more wine and vinegar at the end. I should have done the jalapeno, so threw in some red pepper flakes. I served this with a pork tenderloin in cider sauce, and mashed potatoes. It was a great meal and fairly quick.

Definitely will make again! Very tasty -- but I would cook the cabbage longer; at least until all of the cabbage was tender. Simple, but very, very tasty. And pretty, too!

Overall, this was delicious, but only 4 stars because I had to doctor it considerably to get the flavor I wanted. I added onions to the mix, but next time would omit the sugar. It was way too sweet for my taste. Ended up using about a cup of vinegar to compensate.

I loved this. Have been looking for a good braised cabbage recipe. I did use bacon and its fat instead of butter and left out the caraway seeds, ewe. Also used chicken stock for the water. Even my grandkids loved it. Outstanding. Will definitely make again and again. Thank you chef john.

I didn't have any red wine so I split the red wine amount between water and red wine vinegar.  It was awesome!

Really enjoyed this cabbage! Left out the caraway and used honey instead of sugar. The wine really makes this dish.

In the end it was very tasty, but I had to cook it a lot longer, including covered, to make it soft enough for my tastes, and I thought it was improved by bumping up the wine, vinegar, and carraway.

My adult daughter loved this! We thought it was pretty good too! The only comment she made was she wished it had more vinegar, but everyone else at the table said it was just fine. I did chop some leeks and sautéed them for a little bit before adding the cabbage. I didn't add as much sugar as called for. Went well with the Rouladen and potatoes! Thank you!!

I didn't have caraway seeds and hardly any vinegar but it was still great. My daughter didn't like the apples but my husband and I did.  This is the second recipe my daughter didn't like cooked apples in, so it's her, not the recipe. It was really good. I used a small head of cabbage but it still made a lot. I could use for company for sure.

This is a  great go-to dish that never fails.  Adds color to the table and unique , yet simple flavor that is not an everyday thing.   I usually serve it with duck or pork dishes.

Disappointing.  This was way more work than it was worth and not an improvement over simple steamed cabbage cooked with the rest of my corned beef veggies.  I added 4 times the vinegar and still needed to put the bottle on the table so people could add more.  This is the first Chef John recipe I have tried that I was not impressed with

As suggested I modified this recipe: added three diced apples, no red wine, extra red wine vinegar, 1 cup water. When it was ready I added lemon juice and thickened the dish with water/corn starch. 

It was very good.

I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again. Chef John's recipes almost always turn out superb. Also thoroughly enjoy his presentations that are enjoyable and full of humor.

Wow, super easy and so good.  Added two diced apples to a large head of red cabbage.  Everything else as the original recipe says except no caraway seeds.  Not needed.

I just LOVE any recipe by Chef John; his video makes it so easy to follow.  I pretty much made it according to his recipe, however, I browed about 6 small slices of bacon.  I discarded the bacon and browned some onion in the drippings.  It was easy & delicious.  I've made it 2x's and shared some with my neighbor.  I will DEFINITELY make it again, as I'm sure it'll be great with fresh ham for Christmas.

The very nature of this is to use what you have available. I often use raisins or other dried fruits, even dried cranberrys. I gave this a four because it is a good variation on a common theme.
As others have mentioned a bit of bacon can also have an interesting effect on this dish.

One can do this as a stir fry with very little water and a lot of stirring.

i first made this dish over 25 years ago. It is one of my favorites ever since. I do add chicken bouillon instead of only water, and  have always  included 3 peeled and diced apples. I actually have some to finish in my fridge as i type. It stays fresh very long and is delicious even cold on a toast. b- teavon !! Bon appetit !!

I liked this recipe when I first made it, but the next day when I tried the cabbage as left overs the caraway flavor had taken over.  I may try it again sometime without the caraway seeds.

Made for St. Patrick's Day.  I substituted beer for the wine and, and substituted the "juice" from the corned beef for the water in this recipe.  Will make again.

I tried putting some baking soda in this dish as I do with green cabbage recipes to cut down on the gas one can experience with cabbage. As soon as the baking soda hit the cabbage it turned the cabbage jade green.  It still tasted great but I think baking soda and vinegar had a chemical reaction.

I had a pretty big head of cabbage so it took a lot longer to cook even though I split it in half. Next time I make it I will add a bit more liquid so it can cook a bit longer without burning. But very yummy!

when I first started making this I tasted it and I didn't really like it. It is a dish you need to be patient with. The taste develops and this ends up being actually very tasty. Thank You chef John, good recipe.

I've never had braised cabbage, so I've nothing to compare this to, but I liked this!  I served it with grilled tuna and I liked a bite of this with each bite of the tuna.  Mr. LTH was not a huge fan, but I enjoyed it.  THANKS for the recipe, Chef John!
