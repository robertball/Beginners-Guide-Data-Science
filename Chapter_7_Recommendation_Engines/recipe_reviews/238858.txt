I had farro on hand after finding it at Aldi a few weeks back. Now that I know I can make THIS I'll be buying it more often. I followed all ingredients and directions, except for two things: omitting the butter since I had enough grease from the cooked sausage and adding the garlic near the end of the 5-6 minutes for the apples/onions (I was afraid it would burn and turn bitter). This is rustic, and delicious, and the perfect hearty dish for a cold winter's night in Michigan!

This was yummy! I cooked the onions and the sausage together instead of separately. Then I added the diced apples. After a bit I added the garlic. My faro took longer because it wasn't quick cooking faro, it was pearled faro. I added the faro when it was almost done to the sausage, onion and apple mixture and simmered for about 10 minutes. Perfect!

I used a cup of farro cooked in 2 1/2 cups water since I didn’t have the Trader Joe’s type called for in recipe. This recipe is delicious and a hit with both me and my husband! I will definitely make it again.

We found this to be flavorful and very textually appealing if not visually.  I used an apple chicken sausage and added some roasted butternut I had leftover.  I ended up serving a bacon apple chutney as we felt it was missing something to wake up everything and give some pop.

Tried this tonight and loved it!  I used the apples I had on hand, which were not granny smith.  I also added a sweet potato.  We will be making this again.  I think we might go lighter on the sausage, maybe only half the package.

This was delicious and very easy to make! I only made small changes as recommended by others. First, I did not use butter to cook the apples, onion, and garlic in; the grease reserve was enough to prevent sticking. Also, I added spinach at the end and allowed it to wilt before serving. Because there are only two of us, I did halve the recipe and it was plenty. We will absolutely be making this again and I have already shared it with others.

Delicious and very easy. The first time I made the recipe as is. The second time I ued spicy Hawaiian pineapple sausages, another apple, and a red bell pepper. 5 minutes before serving I added a handful of frozen peas and a handful of frozen spinach. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Absolutely wonderful! The only thing I did different was add celery. My husband loved it too. I will make this again and again!

Yummy.! The sweetness of the apples meets the ferro perfectly. It satisfied my whole family.
