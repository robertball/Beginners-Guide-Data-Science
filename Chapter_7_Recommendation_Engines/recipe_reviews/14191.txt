This is the best. My family is not a great lover of coleslaw. I made this for a change and even my fussy son enjoyed it and had a second helping. I chopped the onion and red pepper instead of slicing. I also added some sugar to the sauce for a little sweetness. I have finally found the coleslaw recipe I have been searching years to find.

I found this to be a GREAT Coleslaw Recipe.  I made minor modifications to the recipe based on previous comments.  I added a bit of sugar, omitted the red pepper, replaced the red onion with a sweet vadalia onion and added about 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts.  
I brought this to a lunch gathering and have several requests for the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again!! We were very delighted with this recipe.

What a really good coleslaw! I cheated and used the package slaw mix. I did not have any raisins so I added rice vineager for a little sweetness. This is the slaw I am making from now on!!

Best 'slaw' yet! I added rice wine vinegar to the recipe instead of white wine (and actually forgot to add the mustard) and we couldn't keep our fingers out of it before it got to the fridge! Lots of freshly grated pepper and a touch of paprika mixed in with the dressing and what a hit.

This is my favorite way to serve cole slaw.  We love the flavor of the Dijon mustard with the sweetness of the raisins.  I add a little sugar to the dressing.

It really is "always a winner".  I get rave reviews everytime I make this (especially from my mom).  I only use 1/4 red onion so it's not over-powering and add an additional 1/4 to 1/2 cup of raisins if the cabbage is particularly bitter.  This is a great all-occasion coleslaw (not just for bbqs).

Another winner! Thanks for sharing Kathy. I made this for Thanksgiving and doubled the recipe. The dish was scrapped clean. I did, however, substitute crushed pinapple for the raisins since my kids are not raisin fans. If you do this, be sure to drain the pinapple well so that your coleslaw is not too watery.

I am not sure what the reave is over this coleslaw. We are coleslaw lovers and this was the worst I have ever made. Very bland and not sweet. You have to make sure you get a raisin in each bite in order to give it any hint of flavor.

I found this receipe to be way too creamy.  Next time I will use only 1/2 the amount of dressing and more raisens.  But I will make it again, it was still good.

I had to substitute a yellow onion for the red and used only a little, but the onion flavor was quite strong so I don't know how the whole red onion will work.  Nevertheless, the recipe was terrific and I look forward to trying it again according to the recipe !

I read that some people thought the onion was too strong so I tried a sweet vidalia type onion instead and we loved it.  The raisins are great in this.  I am so glad that I found this recipe.  It gives us a nice alternative to the standard coleslaw recipes!

I was alittle nervous because the description said barbeques that this would be moreof a summer type salad, but I made it last weekend for a potluck family gathering and it was a great hit!
Thanks.

This is great!  I didn't really use everything - I decided to keep it simple with just cabbage and carrots for my toddler, but the dressing is wonderful and she's eating it right up!  The sour cream is a nice touch and I like the lack of sugary sweetness.  On my plate I added a bit of salt and pepper, which maybe wouldn't be  needed with all the other additions for flavor, but my daughter isn't asking for any.

Excellent - I have been looking for a good coleslaw recipe and I think I've found it!  I didn't use the raisans-my family doesn't care for them.  So I put a little sugar in the dressing and added some fresh ground pepper.  I sprinkled some raisans on my serving and it was great.  I will be using this one from now on.

Not bad, but not especially striking either.  I ended up with far too much of the wet ingredient mix, so the slaw was a bit too soggy for my taste.  To some extent that's a personal preference, but I just mention that so others can adjust ingredients according to their preference.  I did add a little sugar, which other reviewers recommended.  That was a good decision.  1/2 teaspoon or so is enough.  Refrigeration does improve the flavor, which isn't up to par still warm.  Some won't like it because of the raisins, but the raisins are a small part of the overall flavor; they enhance, not dominate.  There are many other slaw recipes on this website that I like better, but this one is okay.

Very good coleslaw recipe. Love the raisins and mustard. Made this coleslaw twice now / before without reading reviews and found the onion overpowering. Like other reviewers, suggest that you omit or reduce onions, add a bit of sugar and more raisins if cabbage is bitter. Also, I added more cabbage because there was a lot of dressing. It pays to read reviews. Thanks for sharing a great coleslaw recipe.

I loved the flavor of the dressing and the sweetness of the raisens.  I might try adding some toasted pecans next time for a nutty flavor to compliment the raisens.  This was soooooooo good.

This is quite good---I added a little sugar though since the cabbage I used was  somewhat bitter.  Next time I'd either leave out the onion altogether or use a very mild onion.

This was the best coleslaw ever!  I didn't think the raisins made a difference , but they did.  It's just that extra little bit of "sweet" that added a lot. I also added a little salt that was not in the recipe. I  served it with ribs and it was a major hit.

The males in the family especially likes this coleslaw because they say, "It isn't sweet like many other coleslaws, so it tastes better with regular food."

We eat a lot of salads in my house and I was looking for a little twist on classic coleslaw.  This one is delicious!  We're not big fans of raisins in our salads so I eliminated those. I also used one of those store bought pre-made bags of coleslaw cabbage.  Yummy!

Creamy and good, especially on a BBQ beef sandwich.  I used a bag cole slaw mix.  Still worked great.

I just wanted something easy using what I had on hand.  I left out the raisins and the onion.  Added some sugar too.  Tastes great and is quick and easy!

This was not a "Creamy Coleslaw".  The onions were too much for the recipe; you may want to cut the onions out all together. The raisins were a good change from other recipes rather than adding sugar. I accidentally added too much salt but this recipe is only average.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, the first time I made this, I followed the advice of many people and only used half an onion.  It was tasty, but still a bit too strong.  The second time I made it, I used a quarter of a red onion and it was perfect.  Red onions can vary in size, so depending on how big or small it is, it could be half an onion if its a small one or a qurter if its a large onion.  I also used rice wine vinegar (again at the suggestion of some reviews) and added some salt and pepper and honey to taste.  I've now made this recipe 5 times with the small tweaks I mentioned above and its always a show stopper.  I even had someone tell me that they usually hate cole slaw, but found this version to be palatable.

I love the flavor of onions but cannot stand the crunch so I grated the onion with a chease grater. left out the raisins. Added just about 3/4 tsp of sugar. This is a good recipe to add on Chipotle BBQ pulled pork sandwiched.

My DH and 8 yr old DD loved this.  I should have combined the mayo, sour cream, mustard and vinegar together first before adding it to the rest of the ingredients.  Otherwise YUMMMM

I have read lots and lots of coleslaw recipes, but this one is definitely the best. It took no time to make, and the taste was incredible!  The raisins are a great addition. I added a 1/2 tsp of horseradish, and it just perked it up. A winner, for sure!

Really delicious! I used only half a red onion,  substituted apple cider vinegar because that's what I had on hand, and also substituted full-fat greek yogurt for the sour cream (because its healthier, and again, what I had in the fridge). SOO GOOD! especially like the raisins/onion combination.

I thought this was a little too bland. I increased the dijon to 3 teaspoons and increased the vinegar by another teaspoon (2 total). I also added a teaspoon of sugar. That helped. Instead of onion, I had to sneak it in by adding onion powder to the dressing. I used fat free sour cream and reduced fat mayo. No red pepper.

Made this for July 4th party and people were asking for the recipe. I used pineapple instead of raisins, left out the red pepper, added 1 tsp of sugar to the dressing, and used white balsamic vinegar...but didn't end up using all the dressing. That would have been too much cream.  I also served it after only 30 minutes in the frig.  Great recipe because you can revise it a bit and it still comes out yummy.

I left out the raisins (we wanted a more savory slaw, with no sweetness) and I used a pre-packaged broccoli slaw to save on time. Instead of all sour cream, I used half fat free yogurt and half reduced fat sour cream. We thought this was good, though it needed a little fresh minced garlic. The white wine vinegar was very nice, I'd add a little more next time. I did add fresh ground pepper. This was one recipe in a full Take-Out Fake-Out meal when we couldn't afford a local take out chicken resteraunt.

I didn't think this cole slaw was anything special.  It tasted okay, the mustard was a little different, but not bad.  I really thought the sour cream would make it more creamy, but it didn't.

My husband and I loved this & we could normally take coleslaw or leave it as the saying goes.  I did cut down on the mustard the 2nd time around but either way it was great.  Someone gave me a cabbage & now I'll be buying one just to make this again and again. Today I was rushed so just added the slaw without the onion & pepper and it was still scrumptious. Thanks

Great Slaw! But of course being the master of tinkering with recipes I added one clove of fresh garlic and grated some fresh parmigiano Reggiano in it. Makes it really good!!! On a second note I also didn't use mayo I used plain yougart. Much Healthier and there isn't much diffrence in taste.

This is the BEST coleslaw I've ever had! It's not traditional dry, sweet coleslaw, but extra creamy and more savory.I shredded half my cabbage on a grater and chopped the rest, so it had a nice crunch.I also ommitted the peppers, carrots and raisins. I did add a little more Dijon for some kick, and a good amount of Mirin (rice wine vinegar) for some sweetness.I also added some fresh ground pepper and sea salt-fabulous!This is my coleslaw recipe from now on!

Fabulous and easy recipe for the most part, but felt it was lacking some flavor when I finished the steps (I did omit the raisins, but don't feel that is what left out the pizazz as other readers said as well).  So, I added some Ott's Original Dressing and garlic powder and WOW did the flavors come alive!  Also added salt and pepper to flavor.  Placed on top of my BBQ pulled pork sandwich and it was great!  Overall, good starting place, but not a way to end the recipe.

Good recipe. You can really alter it to your taste.  I didn't add the raisin because my kids wouldn't let me. LOL.  I also did not have any carrots.  I used a green pepper instead of a red b/c that is all I had.  I also added a pinch of sugar in place of the raisins.   After it was all said and done it was good but not great.  I added about 1tblspn of horseradish to it.  I like it with a little bite.  That brought the cole slaw to life.  I also used lite mayo and low fat sour cream.  Those are staples in our home.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again but with the horseradish and I won't forget the carrots next time.  Thanks.

I used a mixture of both green & purple cabbage and added some finely chopped apple instead of the raisins. It was a very nice coleslaw although I couldn't really taste the mustard.

i used less raisins and ff sc and red wine vinegar. i didnt think the changes mattered in this and i had to use what i had. this would be an amazing recipe if it included salt and pepper and maybe somethine else. i added it after and it was just right. i didnt use two bowls just one it combined fine and saved me a dish. this is a solid recipe it just needs seasonings.

I had to make some modifications and this was still great. I did not use red pepper and I subbed fat free plain yogurt for the sour cream and red wine vinegar for the white wine and it was totally yummy.

I thought this was quick and easy, but not the best I've ever had.  I omitted the red onion and raisins (just thought they sounded weird), and used fat-free sour cream and light mayonnaise.  I used 4 1/2 cups cabbage, which was more than called for, but I think next time I will add even more - when the dressing sits over night, a little goes a long way!  I thought the red bell pepper was a nice addition, and an extra veggie to boot.  I wish I had read the reviews first, as I, too, will add some sugar next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I personally thought the amount of mayo and sour cream was rather excessive - I ended up adding more cabbage til it was how I wanted. Although Husband really liked the raisins in it, I preferred them without, and I wish I had added some diced onion too. This was good but it definitely needed a bit of tweaking.

I used the prebagged slaw and just made the dressing part. I subbed out a couple packages of nutrasweet for the raisens, and a little onion powder, and some applecider vinegar, dash of celery powder, tasted great

I didn't care for the red onion or bell pepper in this recipe.  It was ok, but not my taste.

Excellent!  And the cream does make the slaw, which I found out the hard way cuz I didn’t favorites this recipe.  I used another and was sorely disappointed.  It’s flagged now!!

I've never seen a coleslaw recipe without sugar...Maybe this is a special diet recipe...Use sugar or sugar replacement, because raisins don't do the trick..A tablespoon or two does the trick
