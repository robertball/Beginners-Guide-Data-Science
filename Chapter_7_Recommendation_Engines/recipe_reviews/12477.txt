Very much like my Grandma's recipe, which was one of my favorite dishes that she made. I can only think of a few differences. I believe she used baking soda rather than salt to soak the kidneys. She baked it in a very large, deep aluminum pie dish, and would place an inverted custard cup smack-dab in the middle of the lower crust before spooning in the filling. This held the top crust up and kept it from lying on the filling and getting soggy.

Good pie, but quite messy and smelly to make.

This is a very, very good recipe. One thing I do is put it in individual casseroles or foil loaf pans, cover with pastry, and what I do not use cover tightly and they are ready to use for the next time .

I have never cooked or consumed Kidney before and was glad to be  informed of the smell. I lit a candle and followed the recipe top to bottom. I did not eat this, but the 77 year old English couple I cooked this for raved as to the quality and taste like home. So............. I guess it is Fantastic!

This had great flavor.   We followed the recipe exactly, but I might cut down on potatoes next time.

I tried this, didn't use the potatoes and used a frozen pie crust that I rolled out. It came out great! The gravy was very tasty. We finished the whole thing in 2 days! Will definitely make it again.
