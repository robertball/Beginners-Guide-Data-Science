So I ran across this recipe the other day and decided I just had to make this.  This was surprisingly good!!  I made it exactly as is and my son and I just kept raving about it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a tad dry, not dry, but just a tad.  I felt like it needed a little moisture.  This recipe has great possibilities.  As we were eating it we were exclaiming how delicious it would be with eggs in and turn it into a breakfast braid, or make it up like a pizza braid.  Endless possibilities!  Thanks, Fioa, for sharing it!  It's really good!!  We'll be making this again!!
