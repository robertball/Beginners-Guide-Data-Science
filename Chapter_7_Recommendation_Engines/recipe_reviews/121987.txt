My whole family loves this. I vary it a little by using Oriental flavor ramen. Also I toast the almonds lightly by putting them in a dry cast iron skillet over medium heat. It takes about 5 min. to get them a nice brown. Yum!

This is a great slaw recipe for those not wanting all the mayonaise. Olive oil works great here too.

This was nice for a change from the usual coleslaw. I found the recommended amount of slaw was insufficient for 6 people, so I added in some lettuce. It also seemed to need something other than the oil and garlic salt, so I added in some seasoned rice vinegar. Thanks for the recipe. I will make this one again.

Pretty standard recipe that I've used for a while. I like this version because it's salty unlike the recipes that call for sugar. I like to add a couple stalks of diced green onions.

This was quite good but way too salty.  I wouldn't put the extra salt in.

Since only had a little left over slaw mix that was frozen I had to add it to the hot oil mix. Then mixed in the crushed noodles and lots of almonds. Just cooked till cabbage was heated. Husband and I really enjoyed it.  Can't wait to try original recipe...cold with freash cabbage. Great on pocket book too.

It's a little bit strange at first but it's good.  I don't know if it'll become a staple in our house but we enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing.
