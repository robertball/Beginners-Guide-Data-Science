Making this salad was a spur of the moment decision resulting from my having to salvage a can of beans from another recipe.  Therefore, I had to wing it on a couple of ingredients. Frozen corn filled in for the fresh, and cucumbers had to fill in for the avocado as I was fresh out. As for the cilantro, I don’t know exactly how much I added, but I know it wasn’t a “bunch,” no matter how you choose to define that.  I added a much smaller amount, an amount that looked right to me. I also appreciated that this recipe didn’t have to rely on garlic. It was a happy accident that I ended up making this at the last minute – it really was very good – just don’t forget salt and pepper.

This will probably become a staple in my meal plans. I substituted 1 can of Del Monte sweet white & yellow corn, added 1 can of chickpeas, and I omitted the olive oil. So delicious & refreshing, nutritious & fiber packed. My boyfriend doesn’t care for vegetables so I have to be creative and he couldn’t get enough of this one!

I made this yesterday for a family function and it was a HUGE hit! I did add a teaspoon of salt, pepper, cumin and an 1/8th teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I'll be making this again soon!

This salad was AMAZING!!! I have made it twice in the last three days for two different groups of friends!!! They loved it!!! The only thing I added was a little salt and pepper. The key is to serve it very chilled. You will not be disappointed!!!

My family really enjoyed this. I added leftover  chicken I had marinated in Italian dressing and also added little Italian salad dressing instead of olive oil and it gave it a real good flavor. I like it mild so I replaced the jalapeño with bell pepper which gave it an added crunch. A nice light lunch.

Love....love....love this salad so refreshing! I have taken to several summer potlucks, I always get asked for the recipe. The first time I made it I used frozen corn, it was good...the now I use fresh corn, oh my...it is even better. I notice several say they added salt and pepper, my first reaction was to try it with salt, but so many are watching salt intake, so I didn't and it was great! Once it marinates it doesn't need anything else. This summer I didn't have any plain olive oil, so by chance I had some "Persian Lime Infused Olive Oil", it was great!

I added a little less corn and added spinach and kale instead, everyone loved it, even the meat eaters.

Love this salad!! I make this for all summer grill outs. It's always a hit and requested by family and neighbors alike. I typically make it exactly as the recipe describes; a few times, I've left out the jalapenos. Great either way!

I took hint from other reviewers and added some diced cucumber; salt and pepper and cayenne in the oil; no jalapeno (I forgot). My husband thought it was just OK, so I'm going to make some changes.  Lose the beans, add celery and some steamed or sauteed asparagus.  The simple dressing is a winner, and will work for many dishes.

I added a little green enchilada sauce to the lime juice/olive oil mixture and then sautéed some turkey sausage for protein and it was awesome!

I cut this down a lot to suit our needs, but I did follow the recipe.  Salt and pepper are needed, and if you like heat, you may have to add a little.  My jalapeno wasn't very strong today, so when I went to eat it, I added a little Tajin (a new favorite of mine for sure!).  Thanks a lot for this, Lisa S!
