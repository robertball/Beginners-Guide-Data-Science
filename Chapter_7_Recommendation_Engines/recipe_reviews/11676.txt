My family and friends really enjoyed this salad. I noticed the complaints of lack of flavor in the other reviews so I did add more dill, some fresh garlic and about a teaspoon of Mrs. Dash. Very light and refreshing pasta salad!

The longer it set, the better it got. I added onion and between a half to a whole tablespoon of black pepper and the aftertaste had a great spicy bite! A touch of lemon juice was nice too!

I followed the recipe exact. I made it early this morning and let it sit for a couple hours before I tasted it, as I was afraid it might be a little......bland. And I was right. I think it's okay, but it needs a little more. Of what, I'm not sure exactly. Garlic? Onion? The recipe lives up to the title but it's needs a little somethin'-somethin'.

after reading the other reviews, & making this i did the following:  added 1/2 le,mon (the most important)  added a ton of dry dill, used mayo instead of milk & sour cream, added onion powder, dry mustard, & added paprika and chili powder by default b/c they were already in my only mayo.  makes a pretty dish!

Good base. Like others, we added more dill, some lemon, and garlic. First day is good, second day is phenominal (make it the day before!!).

I reduced the milk/sour cream a little and added some mayo.  I also added a dash of lemon pepper seasoning, a green bell pepper (chopped), and some salad shrimp.  Not bad but when compared to my mom's recipe (which is similar and is an OUTSTANDING recipe) this one only tasted average. The base for this recipe is good - it just needs a little tweeking. Thanks anyways.

We make this Pasta Salad all summer long for all our summer parties and for lunch and dinner sides during the week. I am not a fan of the usual pasta and potato salads at BBQ's. They are way too heavy for me. I love the lightness of this pasta salad. I love being able to use my veggies that grow in abundance in my garden along with my fresh dill although I frequently use 1 T dry dill which adds up to be more than what the recipe calls for. We also sometimes substitute the sour cream for greek yogurt (fage) or go halfsies. We also use 1/4 cup whole milk instead of the skim milk it calls for. We tried cutting back on the salt but this recipe really needs it along with plain shaker style black pepper. We tried using whole wheat pasta but it doesn't work well with this recipe. We enjoy the spiral type pasta or regular elbows. This pasta salad is the perfect answer for those looking for a lighter variation of the normal macaroni salad.

I use this recipe all the time for a good base recipe. I usually add some red onion, partially for flavor, partially for color. I also sometimes add mayo and a bit more dill. I've also added lemon pepper and garlic salt. I use sweet grape tomatoes, quartered to add a bit of sweet flavor too.

Good base - add 1 clove of garlic, 1 extra TBSP of white vinegar and 1/4 extra tsp black pepper.  Gave it more zip. It does increase in flavor as it sits so don't panic!

I liked this one, but the extra water the cucumbers put off (even after seeding them) was unappealing to us. I do like the 2 flavors combined. Perhaps leaving out the salt and letting the cukes drain after seeding, chopping for a few hours would help?

Very nice with the texture of cucumber and pasta.  I deseeded the tomatoes and patted the cukes with a paper towel before chopping. I let it sit for 4 hours before serving.  Was not watery at all and had plenty of dill flavor.

I love this salad and so does the hubby. To make it a little more healthier for him I did half olive oil mayo and half yogurt and he couldn't even tell. Thanks for this recipe since I lost my original

If you are lucky enough to live where there is Dorothy Lynch Salad dressing, I suggest doing this instead of the published dressing mix.  Way easy and delicious, also attractive red tint to the salad.

Excellent base recipe. I upped the amount of dill by half again, a few leaves of fresh oregano chiffonade, a heavy pinch of kosher salt, and added a dash of cayenne pepper. Absolutely delicious.

This was really good. I used 2% Lactaid milk instead of skim milk and it was a little watery so don't do what I did. I also used canned chopped tomatoes instead of fresh and they were still good.

I made this for a bbq and the sour cream was so overpowering. I had doubled the recipe so maybe the scaling was off, but this is definately not something I would make again.

This is "a keeper."  I just the multi-flavor rotini twists, and added 1/2 cup chopped celery and 1/2 cup dill pickle relish.  Makes it even better.  Thank you.

I thought this recipe was great!  I only made a few substitutions: I added avocados to the tomato/cucumbers, used mayonnaise instead of sour cream, bumped up the salt to 2Tbl, added garlic, cheddar cheese cubes, bacon, pepperoni, used lobster stuffed tortellini instead of macaroni, Hollandaise sauce instead of milk, and then I poured a cup of Wessin oil over it all.

As is, this recipe would be very bland indeed. I made many substitutions and got very good reviews for it at the party I took it too. I did make it the day before so the flavors could develop. Here's what I changed/added: I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 greek yogurt, with a bit of mayo and dijon mustard, too. For spices I added dried mustard, coarse ground garlic & sea salt to taste (I added lots), season salt and dried dill. I also used about 2x the fresh dill called for. The combination of tomatoes (I used cherries, quartered), cucumbers and dill is really good, just season to your taste!

I tried this because I have cucumbers from my garden that need using. I rated the recipe as written. It was pretty bland.  After trying the original, I made some reviewer recommended additions: doubled the dill, and vinegar, 3/4 tsp.(instead of 1/2) cracked black pepper, added red onion. This improved the flavor, but I still would only give it 3 stars. *** Sorry, was not a fan. Maybe if you replaced some of the sour cream w/ low fat mayo.

I make this recipe all the time however a slight variation - I use red pepper instead of tomato, substitute 1/2 the sour cream with mayo, and add 1/2 cup of shredded cheese.   Everyone always loves it!!

This is a good base recipe. Make sure you add salt to the water you cook the pasta in. That will go a long way towards eliminating the blandness. For added kick I added a chopped pickled jalapeño along with extra dill, garlic salt, juice of half a lemon, and used greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

A good alternative to mayo based sauce if you are trying to eat lighter, which is why I tried it. I added celery, onion, and red pepper in addition to everything else. It was okay, but on the bland side.

I took this to Christmas lunch at my mother's and it was a hit!  Some members of the family thought it could use more salt.  My husband and I loved the fresh taste of the dill and cucumber dressing.  We have already started thinking up more uses for it.  You could use it for a dip for vegs, as a side sauce for salmon OR just make more of the pasta salad.  Yum!  Definitely 5 stars.....

This is a very tasty salad. I substitute dill seed rather than fresh or dried dill. You can also use dill relish in place of the dill to make it delicious.

I just made this.  Loved the combination of cucumber and tomato.  I added diced garden onions.  But just felt it was fairly bland taste.  Not sure what would be good to give it more flavour??

The only change i made was that i used seedless cucumber and didn't bother to peel it . Used full-fat sour cream. The fresh dill gave it a really nice flavor. Thanks!

I love this recipe! A friend made this for me once and I had to search to get the recipe. I make it with cole slaw dressing and sour cream (have to mix to taste). It's a nice light pasta salad with a delicate taste, goes great with BBQ.
