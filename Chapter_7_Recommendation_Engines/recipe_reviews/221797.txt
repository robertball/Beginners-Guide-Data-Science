Wow, this was good. I couldn't get poblanos, so I used anaheim and red bell, and it was still strikingly delicious. Not your average recipe.

This was the best soup I've ever had in my life, I was very impressed with the results!the orange zest ads immense exotic flavor. I varied it a little bit by also adding a yellow bell pepper in the pur√©e, then added some cooked rice, and upon serving also added some cheese on top. So good!! Definitely making this again!!

Served hot or cold, this soup has some zip to it.  Unable to get my hand on poblano peppers, I substituted Rotel tomatoes with chilis and lime.  This combination resulted in a fantastic change-up from ordinary tomato soup.

I made this for a family lunch and I made a big pot and it was gonna very very fast. I also made fresh croutons and with mini french toast drizzle olive oil and minced garlic on top so yummy.
