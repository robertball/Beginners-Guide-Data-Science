Peaches and bourbon are just so right together. Sip this one slowly, though. It's so delicious, you might down it too quickly and have to go lie down. In a hammock. In the shade. Yes, I'll have another, thanks.

Flavor wise peaches and bourbon can't be beat, but when you add in the smokey charred grill factor it takes everything to a whole new level.  I can't fault the flavor of this drink in anyway, but it is rather time consuming and different to strain around the peach pulp.
