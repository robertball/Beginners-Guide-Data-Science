These were so yummy Jessie.  Quesadillas are one of my favorite foods and they wouldn't be complete without bell peppers, so I chopped up an orange bell pepper and threw it in the mix.  I spread a little butter on one side of the folded tortilla and baked them at 400 flipping them over half way.  I cooked them for about 7 minutes on each side and they turned out perfect.  The tortilla was lightly salted and crunchy...soooo good. Between my husband and I, we gobbled down 6 of these. I could eat these everyday!  Thanks for sharing.

I could not belive how well the tortilla browned and got crispy on the out side i thought you would have to fry them to get that outcome i also added bell pepper and i followed the advice of someone else and baked at 400 degrees for 7 to 9 min then flipped and did it for another 7 to 9 min really great recipie highly recomended i served mine with tortilla soup also on this site.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe that's good for the whole family. I find that adding a little bit of cumin or chili powder spices up the recipe nice, but not too much. Also, red pepper is a great thing to add, it really gives the recipe alot more flavor, but not in a spicy-hot way, in a nice well-rounded way

The only thing that I did differently was to cube my chicken and use a hickory seasoning (with a little liquid smoke) to give this some added flavor.  I also used green onions instead as well.  Hubby and I really enjoyed.  Put this on the flat side of the grill pan and was delicious.  Thanks for an easy (and inexpensive) meal when I don't feel like slaving over the hot stove.

I used a bag of tyson's grilled chicken strips, added an orange bell pepper and garlic powder to recipe. It ended up making five quesadillas (I guess I like more filling than normal) but it was soooooo delicious I can't wait to make again. By the way, I'm the girl who always holds the onions and peppers on most anything, but this recipe was so good don't let a little aversion to onions stop you. mmmmmmmmm can't wait to make again!!!

I've made these a few time's,they are great and easy to make. I add a packet of taco seasoning, a little taco bell hot sauce.Yum even my 5 year old loves them.I butter thefolded over edge so they stay shut and brush melted butter on top before cooking them, this makes them  crispy and golden brown on top.
Thanks for the recipe. Alecia

Delicious and very quick to throw together. Instead of cooking the chicken in oil I rubbed it with a bit of taco seasoning then threw it on the George Foreman. I then shredded it and mixed it with the salsa and a dollop of fat free sour cream to make it a little creamy. I did take another reviewer's suggestion and baked at 400 for 7 minutes, then flipped and baked for 5 more minutes. The tortillas browned and crisped up perfectly. My fiance *loved* this, so I will definitely make again. Great quick dinner. Thank you! :)

I think the serving size on these is a little off but my end result was the best quesadillas I've ever had, way better than chili's. Seasoned my chicken..then added diced onion and green pepper till soft. Used cumin, garlic & onion powder, a dash of chili powder, pepper, and red pepper..kept adding until it tasted right..then I added 4-5 tablespoons of salsa till I got the right consistency. Cooked in the oven about 10 minutes, flipping half way..next time I'll pan sear them :D Thanks for this awesome base!

So Good!! I made these last night and my husband and brother loved them.  After reading the other reviews I decided to add seasoning to the chicken.  I used cumin, red pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder.  I also brushed the outside of the tortillas with butter.  They turned out yummy.

These were tasty. I used precooked chicken that I had leftover from a roasted chicken and added some low fat sour cream and a heaping tablespoon of taco seasoning (also on this site) to moisten it up a little and give it more flavor. Next time I would like to try adding some different ingredients such as jalepeno peppers, corn and black olives. We love these with sour cream on the side.

I must be missing something.  ONE chicken breast, TWO tablespoons of salsa, TEN ten inch tortillas?  I added one extra chicken breast and STILL had very sparsely covered tortillas.  Baked in the oven, they did indeed turn out crispy, but not in a good way.  They were dry.  There is not enough substance inside the tortillas to even fill them halfway.  Should you decide to make this recipe, then use about 4 chicken breasts, and about 1 cup of salsa.  Then butter the tortillas and fry them up in the skillet.  Much better this way.

This summer my 9 year old is responsible for helping plan and cook a meal once a week.  He came on and found this recipe and we cooked it together tonight.  WOW was it good and recieved all thumbs up from the crowd. I believe the recipe is written wrong and that one pound of chicken is correct, not one chicken breast. We also added cumin, salt and pepper to the chicken as it was frying up. We increased the salsa amount, it seemed too little, to about 1/3 cup, enough to get all the chicken covered.
Finally the other change we made was taking 1/2 the cheese and adding it to the mixture at the end so that the cheese melted into the chicken.  We sprinkled the remaining cheese on top of the chicken mixture in the tortilla. It was very easy, very delicious and a  great meal for my son to help out with.  He says he would give it 6 stars if he could.  (It's amazing how good food tastes when they cook it themselves)

Let me say mmmmm! @_@ Delicious and so very easy to customize. I am saving my chicken for tonight, so just did this as a cheese quesadillas. Made a couple variations just to try (olives, home made guacamole, garlic powder, hot sauce, etc) it out and WOW! This would be hard to mess up, and is even easier then I thought it would be!

I covered my baking sheet with tin foil and sprayed a tiny amount of cooking spray. This crisped up so nicely! This is an everyone dish ^_^

These were very good. The only thing I changed was the baking time and temperature. I wanted to get mine a little crunchy so once the cheese melted I turned my oven to broil until they were to my liking. Then I flipped them over and got the other side nice and browned and crunchy. They were great! I also found out that they actually do take a LOT of cheese. I thought I was putting a lot in and then tasted it and realized I needed more. Very good recipe.

Very good recipe...husband and kids loved it!  I did make some changes.  I sauteed the onions in fat free butter and added some garlic powder, salt and pepper while cooking.  I used 1 1/2 lbs. chicken, and added some garlic powder and cumin to the chicken while it was cooking, added the onions to the chicken when it was done, along with other ingredients, and a little extra salsa.  I also put the cheese in after all was heated and let it melt before putting in the flour tortillas.  I only filled 6 tortilla shells instead of 10, so they were very filling.  Topped with sour cream and salsa.  Even my picky 10 year old asked for seconds!

My daughter and I loved these quesadillas. I used 3 chicken breasts cut up into bite size pieces. I cooked the chicken like the directions said but then I added OLD EL PASO mild taco season mix. I also added some chopped red pepper as someone else had suggested. I used 2% shredded cheddar, to cut down a little on the fat. When they were finished cooking, I opened them up and added shredded lettuce, mild salsa, and fat-free sour cream. Then closed them up and cut with a pizza cutter.

This was different, but a good different.  Such a nice change from the sloppy quesadillas that I normally have.  I didn't actually include the salsa with the meat and onion mix.  It was better used with a dab of sour cream and salsa on the side of the plate.  It was to die for.  Thank You, I plan on making this over and over.

I don't care for onions and salsa in my quesadillas; I'm a simple gal. I just used the chicken and cheese. Also, instead of baking them in the oven, I used a 10-inch frying pan and I put an empty shell above the covered one. I flipped it and browned both sides, and then cut into fours. Yum!

Yum Yum Yum!  I did do a few things differently as others had suggested.  I coated the whole chicken breast with taco seasoning and baked it whole till cooked through.  I think this is a must.  It wouldn't have been near as good without this step!  Then when it was cool enough to handle, I shredded it with my fingers.  Then added the salsa and also some sour cream.  My 7 year old kept eating it just like that and I had to make her stop so I didn't run out of meat for the tortillas!  It was then one of the best quesadilla's I've ever had!  This is going on permanent rotation in our menu!  My kids (5 & 7) each ate a whole big one and said it was like a taco pizza!  (they love taco's and pizza).  I could barely eat a whole one so for them to, it must be good!  Big, big hit in our family!

I used a rotisserrie chicken, chopped it into pieces, and reheated it along with diced onion and chopped green bell pepper.  Added a dash or garlic powder and about 7 tbs of salsa.  I baked three quesadillas, two as the recipe stated and one big one, using two tortillas.  My hubby said they were delicious, and I agree :)

I really liked these but the family were a little less keen.  Although I do have to say that I had Garden Tomato Salsa (cooked in the wrap) and also as a side serving with mine along with sour cream.  It was a dissapointment that the rest of the family did not like them although having added some spices and garlic to the chicken mine did have much more flavour. This is why I liked this recipe as you are able to adjust it to your very own taste and it was quick and easy.  Perhaps I need to find myself a new family.

Easy and tasty.  I heated them in a pan instead of the oven.

This WAS lunch for us today. These are nothing fancy and I have had better tasting quesadillas but these were still good, easy and quick. I used less white onion but in their place, added some minced green onions and added 1/4 minced green bell pepper. I would make these again as a quick lunch or easy snack. I guess I'm looking for quesadillas that have a filling that doesn't require salsa (but rather you can dip them into salsa). Overall, they're good...but they do need a little "more" (of what? I'll try and figure that out!:)) Thanks Jessie.

I've cooked this dozens of times now for everything from a simple dinner to my contribution to a cookout.  I love these and everyone I've cooked them for has been thrilled.  I've played with the recipe a bit with various salsas etc.  My favorite change has been including some steamed broccoli.  Yummy Yummy!

Used leftover fajita chicken from slowcooker and made with wheat tortillas and 2% mexican cheese and added a green pepper and extra salsa.   I did not use 10 tortillas as I wanted them a little meatier!.  My BF loved them and I loved them!

OMG These are freaking delicious!  I made them two nights in a row.  They're better than many restaurant quesadillas.  I cooked mine in a buttered frying pan rather than the oven because I wanted them crispier and more buttery.

Best quesadillas EVER. I used more salsa than this recipe called for, but it was so good. I loved how the cheese got crispy around the edges due to the oven. Yummy!

being handicapped I had to adjust this so I was able to make it.  For the innards I also added brocolli so I would have a veggie.  I then sprayed an 8" tortilla with pam  and laid it on a cookie sheet.  Spooned the chicken and veggies on top, then added the sour creme, cheese and jalepeno peppers.  I then took another tortilla and put it on top sealing it around the edges.  Then baked it.  It was excellent.

I also thought this was quick and good.  Added a little salt & pepper to the chicken as I sauteed it, only used about half an onion, and threw in some additional red bell pepper.  Added an extra tablespoon of salsa, and used a combination of shredded cheddar and mozzarella since I didn't have monterey jack on hand.  Turned on the broiler for the last couple minutes to brown the outsides of the tortillas slightly and served with additional salsa for dipping.  Yummy!

Fantastic quick lunch!  I added  green bell pepper, cumin, garlic salt & black pepper.  This also makes perfect fajitas when you saute in some chopped fresh garden tomatoes! Serve with shredded lettuce, cheese, salsa, sour cream & quacamole! We will be using this recipe very frequently for quesadillas and fajitas!! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Very good recipe, I made recipe with and without adding the salsa to the chicken and both are good.  I serve with Amys Cilantro Cream Sauce from this site (its delish!)  Thanks for the recipe, I find baking them turns out much better than just flipping on a frying skillet like other recipes call for.

Tried this recipe tonight with great results.  I used one pound of chicken tenders, seasoned with S&P, and TexMex seasoning.  Once cooked, the chicken was set aside.  I added the onions to the same pan to soften and deglaze it, then added the salsa and chicken (back to the pan). Filled whole wheat tortillas and grilled on the BBQ (too hot to have oven on).  Another KEEPER from this website!

Cooked it yesterday and my son, Tyrell, loved it so much! He's a picky eater and always make faces when it doesn't suit his taste buds. But with this he had two servings!!! Definitely a keeper!! I used the rotisserie chicken breasts and Rotelo diced tomatoes and chilies, perfect, I didn't add any seasonings!

Our family loved this recipe. However, I made some changes.  I didn't cook the chicken in oil; I just used cubed, baked chicken breasts instead.  This is a keeper.

Quick, easy and tasty recipe! My kids love these minus the onions. I do season the chicken with a little salt, pepper and cumin. We add sour cream and guacamole.

This recipe rocked. I made it for 9 of my pickiest friends and they couldn't stop talking about it. 

I slow cooked the chicken in salsa for 10 hours and then baked the tortillas with more salsa, some corriander and green onion. Served it w/sour cream and home made guacamole.

I'd give this 5+ stars if possible.  This was very very good and my children even liked it.  I nickname them "Kasey-dillas" for my daugher.  :)  One thing I improved was that I added some cumin and chili powder to the chicken.

Yummy! Perfect quesadillas and NO frying the tortillas! Lots of room for adding your own personal touches, but I like them just like this. Maybe with just a little sour cream on top.

This was just OK.  Both hubby and I decided it needs some green chili peppers, black olives, and a sprinkle of garlic salt.  We are going to try this again with the additions and grill them on the griddle.

Great & fast to go with the 7 Layer Taco Dip from this site we made for a cool supper.  I seasoned the chicken with a little garlic, cumin and chilie powder.  Also added some bell pepper strips with the onion saute.  Just like fajitas, only quicker!

Very good. I used boneless breasts, with no oil, used canola cooking spray. Added 1/2 pkg. fajita mix when cooked, no salsa. My two year old couldn't get enough of it. 
Four year old not as receptive but ate it. great w/ spanish rice. Hubby said I could fix it again, and he rarely says that. Thanks for sharing.

Very good, I did bake at 400 degrees after spraying the outside of the tortilla with Pam.  I added a bit of fresh bell pepper and it was really good.  Good crunch on the flour tortilla without all the fat.  I did serve with fresh salsa and sourcream, yummo!  It hit the spot.

Very good! I'm a BIG fan of Mexican fare, but ironically quesadillas have never topped my "favorites" list. I bought a rotisserie chicken earlier this week planning to make BBQ chicken sandwiches with it, but never got that far.... Since I already had leftover tortillas and salsa handy, I decided to give this a try.  Other than adding a half packet of taco seasonig to my chicken and using up the last of my green onion, I followed Jessie's directions to the letter - and I couldn't be happier with the outcome! Since I used a shredded rotisserie chicken, I obviously skipped the cooking step. I also didn't bother sauteeing my onion. I just chopped it up and added it to my chicken / salsa mixture. Brushing each tortilla with melted butter kept my quesadillas nice and crisp. I still prefer plain 'ol cheese quesadillas when the craving strikes (Luke Walker's recipe is EXCELLENT!!!), but these weren't a bad compromise. Topping with sour cream and fresh pico added a nice (and yummy!) finishing touch. Thanks for sharing, Jess! :-)

This was fabulous! simple and fast too.  The onions in this recipe make the dish and I added extra salsa to make it a little more juicy.  My entire family loved it and we will be making this again!

I made this twice, one with the green pepper and one with out and they were equally delicious! I also substituted whole grain tortillas for a little extra fiber. Very very good!  Thanks :)

Very good. Made for the kids so I left out the onion and salsa. Got nice and crispy in the oven.. Thanks for the recipe.

Had leftovers and reheated for lunch the next day--just as good as the day before :)  will definately be making this more often! i think next time i will try shredding the chicken and see how that goes.. thanks for the awesome recipe!

The first time I made this recipe, I followed the directions exactly, but I found the chicken to be tough.  So, the next time I made it, I poached the chicken tenders for 10 minutes in 1 cup of water, seasoned with salt and pepper, in a shallow skillet, covered.  (Whole skinless boneless breasts would take 12 minutes.)  I drained the chicken tenders, and when the meat was cool enough to handle, I shredded the chicken.  Back to the recipe, I added the cooked chicken to the onions after they were cooked golden and continued with the recipe, buttering the outside of the tortilla, baking for 7 minutes on each side.  The chicken came out tender and juicy this time!

I don't get all of the rave reviews.  There wasn't enough flavor or filling to this recipe for me.  I had planned to bring it to work the next day for myself and a friend but after tasting it I didn't think it was worth sharing!  Sorry, but I will keep looking for a juicy and flavorful quesadilla recipe.

Great recipe but used small amount of green enchalida sauce on bottom and top.  Also, used some of my own salsa from garden. Tomatoes and anaheim peppers along with onions, small amount of vinegar and salt.  Will make again and again.

I really did not like this recipe.  Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of onions, but I know I won't be using this recipe again.

followed everything exactly (did increase the salsa like it says)and the result was bland and soggy.  I can see potential using some changes.

This is a very good basic recipe. I marinated my meat with montreal chicken seasoning,kikkoman teriyaki marinade and sauce and a bit of lemon pepper.  I cooked the chicken with all of the marinade and added a bit more Teriyaki towards the end to carmelize the meat a bit.  It was really good, DH just loved it. Thankyou for the recipe.

This was a quick and easy recipe and turned out yummy.  I ended up using left over grilled chicken from the night before that had been marinated in Italian dressing so it gave it more flavor.  Baking it with some butter on the outside made it perfect instead of having to fry it on the stove.

The recipe was great but you definitely need to Pam the tray before cooking. I completely failed to do that as I was cooking a ton of other appetizers for my New Year's Party. Other than that, people loved them.

This is a great recipe when you want something fast.  I happened to have a rotisserie chicken on hand so I cut that up instead and I cooked the quesadilla on top of the stove instead of baking it.  My oldest son raved about this one.

Oh I just LOVE Mexican food! HA! I used leftover chicken from a roast and because I didn't have any salsa in the house, I used green enchilada sauce. Threw in some bell pepper and decided to be very bad and fry these instead of baking. My hubs isn't all that wild about Mexican but he really enjoyed this tonight. Thanks a bunch, Jessie!!

I made it for my husband and he loved it! After looking at the recipe, I decided to add another chicken breast, doubled the salsa to 4 tablespoons and added Adobo seasoning. It was perfect and is "a keeper" with our family. Enjoy!

I recently discovered this recipe and wish I had sooner - this is so easy and fast.  I used precooked chicken breast which made it even easier and grilled them like a grilled cheese sandwich rather than using my oven. Careful if you are nursing though - my baby did not seem to like it afterwards - too spicy! Will have to wait to have them again...

This was soooo good!  I added some chopped green bell pepper, and used shredded Mexican cheese.  I also made it in my new Santa Fe Quesadilla Maker.  I highly recommend getting one of these!  They make the q's nice and crispy, and it divides the q's into 6 wedges.  Fun and easy!

We loved this recipe.  The only difference I made was adding some sliced green pepper when I sauteed the onions.  They were great.  I should have made more.  We ran out!

I like this recipe and as I was putting it together, I began thinking of things I had in the fridge. I had leftover rotisserie chicken, (Already cooked!) I took out scallions instead of onions and a little uncooked asparagus. I sautéed those along with the Bell peppers and chicken. I melted a little butter and put it on the top of the tortilla and broiled it for a couple minutes. It melted the cheese and gave it a very crispy top!

I agree with other reviewers that this recipe needs updating.  I used 1.75 lbs of chicken and only used 6 tortillas.  Maybe you are supposed to put less chicken in each tortilla but I like a lot of chicken in mine.  I seasoned the chicken with cumin & chili powder before frying it.  The recipe does not say how long to bake in the oven so I used what another reviewer used - 400 degrees for 8 minutes, turned them then baked for 6 minutes.   They did turn out crispy.  I probably will make again.

Family loved 'em!  I added a few things: cooked the chicken in Italian dressing (as someone else suggested) and added chopped green peppers , jalapeno & cilantro. I left them in the oven a little too long (I got distracted cooking other things and forgot about them) and they were a bit dried out , but still excellent!

I cheated and used rotisserie chicken. Mixed with fresh salsa, skipped the onion. Cooked on my George Foreman for 4 min and it came out perfect! Topped with fresh guacamole and extra salsa. Perfect for a quick meal!

This recipe is simple and delicious.  Instead of chicken breasts, I purchase an already cooked whole chicken and use that.  It's easy to prep the chicken mixture and then quickly make and serve hot.

These were super good!  The first time I made it, I enjoyed it myself and had leftovers in the fridge for lunch the next day (I just put the sauce/chicken mixture into a fresh tortilla and baked for lunch). I then made them again for a crew of people and they all loved it and said they had never had a better Quesadilla ever.  :)  Thanks for sharing, you're helping to make my house a popular one to eat at!

These were absolutely fantastic.  I added a red bell pepper to the mix.  I also sprinkled some cheese before spooning the mixture into the tortilla.. so that everything stuck together a little better.  And I also brushed the tortillas with melted butter before I put them in the oven so that they were sure to come out crispy.  But definitely a hit in my house... will definitely be making these again.

Excellent.  Big enough for two to eat as a main dish.

I made these tonight for dinner and they are fantastic! I'll remember next time I make them to get some sour cream.

Very good!  I used prepackaged southwestern- flavored chicken strips to make things a little quicker. Will make again.

I used leftover ham instead of chicken, and I also mixed in about 1/2 cup of salsa and used about 3 cups of cheese.  ...a really quick and easy recipe.

This recipe is just like what we eat when we eat out!  It was a quick and simple dish to make.  Makes a whole meal when served with a small salad and chips and salsa!  Will make again and again!

My husband loved these. They were filling and easy, and you can vary the ingredients or the amount of spice. I added some chili powder while cooking the chicken and brushed butter on the tops of the tortillas before baking.

Great recipe!  My daughter told me how to make it and I needed a written recipe to go with her directions.  This one fit the bill and it was baked not fried (other than the sauteed chicken).  Would make a super appetizer but we had for dinner and it was quite filling!

This is a great, light meal.  Bowls of sour cream and salsa are a must for dipping!

This is easy to make and tastes great. It's a good appetizer for men (not too dainty).

I loved this recipe it had a little spice to it but you can adjust that depending on your likes with the salsa you use, I used medium which was perfect if you like a little kick and I used Tyson precooked chicken breast pieces that are meant for recipes such as this. Overall it was a real hit, everybody loved it and I'll definately
be making it again!HINT:Try adding green
pepper(or red or yellow, your preference), I did!
