this is a fantastic recipe. We are on a low fat, no salt diet. Used lemon-herb seasoning, more pepper & no salt. Used butter spray, not butter. Integrity of the recipe remained & we give it a 5 star pluss it's healthy.. Thanks.

I used the broiler, placing fish on a well greased broiling pan.  Covered both sides of the fish with the spice mixture, then basted with the butter, lemon juice, onion mix.  OMG!!!  It was sooo good.   The only change I would make next time would be to coat only one side of the fish with spice because for some of the kids it was too spicy.  WoW - thank you Jenny.  My husband said it was the best fish recipe he has ever had.

This was excellent! However, my fish wasn't that great for grilling. My problem lies with being frozen cod, that I got from Fred Meyer/Kroger...and when I opened the bag after it thawed...it was fish floating in a lot of water. And my fish was alreaady crumbly. And was falling apart in the grilling process. So now I know what NOT to buy, the other thing was, I over seasoned my fish using almost all the seasoning the recipe made, and my fish was spicy. While my husband and daughter were screaming for more....I was grabbing for a bit of milk. I liked it but wasn't prepared for the heat. Other then that. I can totally make again! The seasoning can go along way, possibly 4 nice size fillets.

We LOVE this recipe!  You need to buy good sustainably caught cod and then just enjoy.....we have it a couple of times a month.  I also found that the brand of Cajun seasoning can make a difference as well.  I use Zatarain's Creole Seasoning.  When I ran out and had to find a sub @ a grocery store on the way home from work (Tony Chackere's Original Creole Seasoning), it wasn't as good.  Sorry Tony Chackere's, your seasoning is good, just not as good as the Zatarain's for this particular recipe.  I also omit the 1/4 tsp salt from the recipe too as my seasonings all contain salt, so extra salt is not necessary.  I usually double the recipe and we eat it the next day for lunch (if there's any left over, sometimes there isn't!).  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.  I've passed it along to friends and co-workers and everyone gives it the thumbs up.  Making it tonight as a matter of fact!!!

A 5 star for our family! My husband said this is a keeper. Easy and delicious. We put it on foil on a gas grill and it took a little longer to cook but mouthwatering good.

This was delicious!  My kids loved it too.  Definitely a keeper in my recipe box.  The changes I made:  I didn't have lemon juice so substituted lime juice.  I also eyeballed the seasonings that went on the fish.

Just being honest, the cod was rubbery.  I prefer cod battered and fried over this recipe any day.  It is too spicy for kids as well.

Did this on a propane grill at about 350.  Came out perfectly with these directions.  Super easy.

This is a very good and simple recipe.  Only thing I'd suggest is take it easy on the cajun spices.  Usually it is very salty.  Loved it, will make again. Bon Apetite!

Amazing flavor! The other reviewers are right about the liquid, I used frozen cod and I tried to take every bit of water out, but while cooking the fish expelled more. I dried it down three times (with an absorbent) but then stupidly added tomatoes which created more water. I just broiled it for a while and all was well. The marinade gives any seafood a wonderful flavor, a bit hot, not spicy, but I served with sauteed radishes and asparagus and cold cucumbers and it was the perfect accompaniment!  My new favorite seafood marinade!

Tried this with swai but left everything else the same. The kiddos loved it even ,y 2 year old ate it up. Go easy on the cajun seasionings though if your kiddos don't like spice. Will be making again!

Absolutely delicious....my husband and I gobbled this right up!  I buy a lot of cod and love to grill so I'll be making this recipe many more times.  I followed the recipe exactly as far as the ingredients list, but did cut down on the Cajun seasoning.

A huge hit at my dinner table!!! Made this using the George Foreman Grill omitting the butter and made the Avocado, Tomato and Mango Salsa to accommodate it! What a great compliment to each other! I'm not even a fish lover but with recipes like this I am certainly starting a love affair with fish!

Simple, healthy and easy, just shake on the amount of spice you desire. We have our own homemade Creole spice. Our cod was fresh caught and this recipe didn't cover that fresh mild taste of the cod, just enhanced it.

I don't care for spicy, so I omitted the Cajun seasoning and used some mango-lime seasoning I had. Also used chopped yellow onion since I didn't have any green onion on hand. To season the fillets before hitting the grill, I melted a tiny bit of butter and rubbed in on with my fingers, then sprinkled the seasoning on. It was soooo delicious! Will definitely make again, thank you!!

This was tasty, easy and everything was on hand.  A bit confused by the instruction to 'let cod sit for 5 minutes before serving' though.  Who wants to eat cold fish?

Good fish, but mine turned out rubbery. I don't know if it was my changes or that I used a gas grill. I subbed old bay instead of cajun seasoning and lime juice instead of lemon. The flavor was good, though. My process for a nonstick grill worked well, though- heat up and scrape the rack, then wipe the grate with an oil- dipped paper towel several times. Maybe next time I'll be sure I'm not overcooking the fish.

Simple and delicious. I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used Jamaican jerk seasoning and it was lovely. You definitely need a nice clean well-oiled grill for this, the fish tends to stick and towards the end of cooking it starts to get flaky, which means if you're not careful it could all fall apart!

I have tried many fish recipes here over the last few months and this is by far the best! I didn't have lemon pepper so I just used coarsely ground black pepper and we omitted the green onion as I didn't have any. I will use both of those next time to complete the recipe! This is going in my recipe box and will now be in the regular rotation for our family! Fantastic!

My hubby can be a picky eater - loves meat and potatoes, meat and potatoes.  This turned out perfectly; I substituted Emeril's for the cajun spice as neither my hubby nor my mother like spicy foods.  It was so good I even got a big hug after dinner from the hubby.  I served this with Parmesan Basil Orzo and Cheddar Biscuits.  A hit in my home.

Didn't add the 1/4 teaspoon salt, and I cut the Cajun seasoning in half.  Also, I used finely minced white onion instead of green.  This was great!

this was AMAZING!  i dont think i put quite as much cajun on it as it called for, but it still had quite the kick to it anyways!  the only thing i did different was i put non-stick foil over my grate, so i had to up the cooking time to about 10 mins total.  even my 4 year old devoured it!  this is a keeper!!!  and, i plan on using it year round!!!

Made this with pollack tonight and it was very nice. We liked the bit of heat and flavor the cajun seasoning offered as pollack is a bit bland on taste. Will definitely make this again.

My wife and I are not big on salt. Although I didn't add the recommended additional salt the Cajun seasoning had more than we would have preferred. That said, I scarfed mine down while my lady picked and moaned.

I changed this recipe.  I used a gas grill and I did not put the cayenne pepper.  I divided up 3 lbs of cod into separate portions and wrapped each piece of cod in heavy duty foil and cooked them for about 40 minutes on medium heat.  The fish was cooked perfectly and I did not have the fish odor in the house for days. My son loved it.

Very tasty and so fast and easy to make! I did not alter the ingredients, my dish was seasoned perfectly. I did not broil on an outdoors grill but in my oven using the broil setting and broiler. I did not baste, just poured the butter sauce on top of the fish and cooked for 6-7 mins. Perfection!

I must say this was a great dish! I used Tony Chachere's seasoning. Note - this seasoning does have salt in it so omit any additional salt. 

The flavors were great. I used the lemon butter to baste at the end and it was a very nice finish.

Lovely.  Used the seasonings on cod and shrimp and grilled both - the cod was melt-in-your mouth.  Fantastic seasoning.

Made this for dinner last night & I say, it was YUMMY!  Followed the recipe, with the exception of half butter & half olive oil for health reasons, and used Old Bay seasoning instead of Cajun, for reduction in salt intake.  Used the white & green parts of the onions as well.  

Jenny, thank you so much for sharing your recipe!  This is a keeper in our household.

It was good...i cooked in a broiler.  Nothing special, not a wow meal but was tasty.  I backed off on the seasoning due to the other reviews and it was perfect.

Fantastic. Instant favorite. We used foil on a gas grill so we did increase cook time about ten minutes a side high heat.

This was fantastic! I am not a fan of fish- in fact I can't stand it. But I know I need to eat healthier and have been trying to find recipes that make it edible. This is a sure winner! I substituted swai for cod, Creole seasoning for Cajun, and garlic herb salt for plain salt. Two thumbs up!

I left out the cajun seasoning because we don't like picante. I added capers to the sauce. Great, easy, delicious. What more could you ask for?

Made this today using a homemade recipe for Cajun seasoning & lemon pepper & it was delish! Doubled the sauce recipe as I had 3 nice pieces of cod but we used a gas grill (I imagine a charcoal grill gave it that extra bit of flavor and it would’ve been a 5). My hub forgot to baste it on grill on the alumn foil, so I did coat w/sauce over all pieces well & put it back on hot grill cov’d for a cple more minutes just to absorb nicely.  Served w/a broccoli & quinoa side dish

It was perfect for my husband and me as the recipe was written with no adjustments.  I was a little hesitant on the amount of  cajun spice but went with it.  Will definitely make again.  We placed it on foil to grill instead of right on the grates.

Great recipe! I didn't have lemon pepper so I just skipped using it. It was amazing and the charcoal grill flavor was just right.. A word of advice - don't keep the fish on too long it'll get rubbery!   I will cook this again.

I used frozen cod. After thawing, I dry marinated it with lemon pepper and Old Bay in the fridge for 3 hours. I breaded the fish and grilled it until just done. 
I changed the sauce. I sautéd sliced shallot in butter and then added lemon zest and juice. I finished it by whisking in Dijon mustard as an emulsion   I served the sauce as a topping for the cooked fish. It turned out great.

We substituted the Cajun seasoning for creole because that's what we had and we also only used a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon. Otherwise everything else was as directed. It was a bit salty but flavorly and we enjoyed it.

Pan seared my cod using the same recipe but used the butter to sauté. Also sautéed onions and served with the fish. This is a great recipe and I’m doing it in the grill next.

Everyone loved it! An easy dish with flavor! I used cod loins and cooked under the broiler and it came out fantastic. Only change would be to go light on the spices. It has a good kick as written. Definitely on the "keeper" list.

We made this recently and had to alter it a little. Substituted Emiril's seasoning and cooked on gas grill. 
Spicy for kids yes, adults noticed, but OK.
Gas grill makes a difference. Make sure you look at your fish as it cooks, mine came out a little undercooked.
Frozen over fresh, OMG yes. Frozen leaves it in too much water. If you have to use frozen, take some time to let it dry properly before grilling. 
Overall, good recipe. We'll make this again.

I like to make new dishes first time around according to recipe. It was very good. Next time might make a garlic/shrimp with olive oil & crushed Ritz cracker topping.

easy to make. used tin foil on the grill. less "grill flavor" perhaps, but less mess. the cod was " previously frozen" that was not an issue, nice and flakey . I'll do thy his one again 15 minutes from package of fish to table.

It was good and easy to make. I may have gone a little easy on the Cajun and lemon pepper seasoning. Will definitely try again and be a little more heavy handed on the seasoning

Made it with some modifications. I broiled it for 15 minutes, but my cod was a thick wild caught kind. I made butter with onions and lemon juice and just poured it on top of each piece.

I made this more pan seared since it's cold out. It was AMAZING! I can't tolerate spicy food very well but this was the perfect mix. It was just awesome. The lemon mixed gracefully with the Cajun seasoning to create a spice that ended with a savory tary twist. fantastic recipe and it will definitely be made again!

What a great, simple dish! Hubby was bringing home a great catch of cod and other white fish, and we had company coming. Since this looked very simple, and I had all the ingredients, I took a chance and prepared it just as written. The fish was a marvelous hit with everyone. It was very moist and delicious. 
This is a recipe I'll make often. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I used a foil lined grill sheet (for veges)  on a gas grill and cooked it 5 mins each side.  Turned off heat and left on grill another 5 mins.  Delicious.  Served with creamy noodles, salad and applesauce.  The noodles and applesauce balance out the spiciness.

This was fantastic ! I didn't change anything to the recipe, but I did add a few pieces of hickory to the fire for that smoked flavor. I used Riley's brand Cajun seasoning and Lawry's lemon pepper. I'll definitely be making this again!

This was, surprisingly, really good.  My frozen cod fillets were a bit rubbery to start with, but I did grill them on our Jenn Aire stovetop grill and they turned out  lovely (only slightly rubbery).  I just sprinkled some Tony Chachere's  Creole Seasoning on both sides of the fillets - no need for salt and pepper as those are the first and third ingredients, respectively, nor lemon pepper.  I did melt the butter and cook some scallions in it, threw a bit of fresh lemon juice in (not an entire lemon - that would have been incredibly sour) and basted both sides of the fish once while cooking (got flare-ups from the butter hitting the gas flame).  My fillets were pretty thin so I cooked 3 minutes on one side and 1 on the other.  After I carefully got it off the grill (the butter pooled in the curved up fish), I poured the rest of the butter/scallion/lemon mixture on top.  Very flavorful, very easy.  Who would've thought?!

It came out surprisingly well. I used the oven at 375 instead of the grill, and reduced the salt (I'm on low sodium diet). I substituted some parsley and thyme. I enjoyed.

Turned out awesome, very tasty! I replaced the Cajun with Frank's Red Hot Original Seasoning and really liked it, feel like it has better flavor. I also think it would be great with garlic.

I didn't want to grill it so I sprinkled on the cajun spice, lemon pepper, salt & pepper then pan fried it in butter and lemon juice.  I used a medium to medium high heat and cooked it about 3 minutes per side.  My husband and I loved it!

Cod came out cooked correctly as per the recipe, but to me the fish is lacking in taste, although my wife liked it a lot.  I think cod is best when fried.

This was excellent. I took the advice of other posters and only seasoned one side, my kids are tearing it up! I used old bay seasoning, and ground pepper to season, and butter, lemon juice and a tiny bit of minced garlic to baste the cod. I also broiled it instead of grilled. Saved to make it again!

I had a beautiful piece of wild caught cod and wanted something different from our normal cooking method. I used far less cajun than was called for as there is a heat wimp in the house and I omitted the salt. Other than those changes I made this as written. I will admit that I made a rookie mistake and didn't oil the fish basket so while it was tasty it wasn't pretty. Thanks for sharing.

Really nice recipe.  Fast, easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I put this on the grill and it turned out  perfect, just as if I had ordered it in a restaurant.
The ONLY thing I did differently was I cut the spices down to 1/2.  I wanted to season both sides of the fish and had read other reviews saying that both sides was too much so I cut it down and went for it.  It was fantastic!  Thank you for this recipe

We have made it 3 times and loved it.  We always soak Cod in milk for the day to make it flaky and remove fishiness.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare. I used an indoor grill, seasoned the fish on one side only and it was perfectly seasoned!!!

Pan fried it instead as I did not have a grill. Turned out fantastic! 2-3mins on each side. To check if it's cooked enough, I poked it a little. Since it was still a little bouncy, I cooked it a little longer. Yum yum!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I scaled back on the spicy seasoning, but will increase it a bit more as I learn what the right amount is for us.  We will be having this one again!

Was an absolute hit!  Made my own cajun spice seasoning and it was perfect.  I used foil on the grill as my cod was not real thick and was previously frozen - good thing or it might have fallen down in to the grill.   Came out nice, moist and flaky.  Will definitely make this again.

Just made this for dinner tonight.  It was excellent.   We had fresh cod from the meat department.   Used all of the ingredients as stated.   I didn't measure the spices.  I just sprinkled them on the fish to our liking.  I had to double the sauce because it was so yummy.  We put the fish on our gas grill and the time was perfect as stated.  It was flakey and delicious!!  Certainly will make this again soon.

I used this recipe for the seasoning idea only.  I only used about half of the recipe of seasonings, and it could have used more, but then it would have been too spicy for me.  It was tasty, but I may keep looking for that perfect combination.

Cajun spices are an excellent compliment on cod.   Super easy recipe to make and grill.  If you're in somewhat of a hurry for dinner, this should be on your list.  Added some basil to basting liquid.  Fish cooked in 10 minutes.

The seasoning is spicier than what I was expecting.  The lemon butter worked very well.  I would definitely make it again, but lighten up on the spice a bit.

This was ok, but I really think cod should be breaded and fried or baked.  It just reminds me of fish sticks.

This was just okay. I had the same problem as another viewer. Cod was frozen that I bought from Kroger. It was really watery. Husband didn't like it all. He said he didn't like the fish. I'm still looking for another cod recipe.

Awesome! I also did shrimp the same way to have with the fish. This recipe cod & shrimp, Zatarans red beans and rice, & steamed veggies. Awesome! I think this recipe could be also used on chicken, and any type of "meaty" fish. Next time I will use catfish, considering I'm in So. Indiana it's readily available. LOVED IT! For the shrimp I just cleaned and peeled the shrimp and lightly sprinkled the mix over them, then cooked on the outside of the hot coals. Tender and juicy! I didn't have lemon pepper so I just laid a slice of lemon on top of the fish while it cooked. I put some lemon juice on the shrimp right before I put it on the grill.

I served it at a cookout tonight. Everybody raved about it. I used frozen cod but made sure to get every drop of water out of it that I could. I sprinkled the seasonings on it and put it back in the fridge while the coals heated up.

I used a fresh caught cod steak, so I had to adjust the timing.  I had no lemon pepper so I used fresh ground and my homemade creole seasoning.  This turned out so buttery, moist and delicious.  Now I remember why I love cod so much.  Thanks for a great addition to our grilling rotation.
