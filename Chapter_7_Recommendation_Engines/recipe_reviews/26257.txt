Hello!  I am the submitter of this great recipes.  I'm amazed at the wonderful reviews, but wonder why some have so much trouble with the sauce.  The sauce is not to be poured over the pasta.  It's supposed to be added and then mixed to the pasta.  Therefore, it absorbs into the pasta and is never too thin or runny.

Delicious - hearty and satisfying.  We used turkey italian sausage and fat free half and half to cut down on the fat, and 2 cans of Italian diced tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes.  I also added about 5 oz. frozen chopped spinach (thawed) to boost nutrition and flavor.  My whole family loved it!

This dish is fantastic and you don't have to change a thing.  Just make sure before you serve it, you mix the pasta with the sauce - that is the key. I do have to comment about the last posting.  Don't criticize the recipe when you don't use the ingredients that are called for.  The person said the recipe was bland, but used turkey sausage and didn't use the Italian tomatoes - of course it is lacking some taste.  If you have to substitute that's fine - but then don't criticize the recipe.  You didn't make it like it was intended to be made.

This had a great flavor, and my husband really enjoyed it.  However, the recipe does not say to drain the grease before adding the cream.  I didn't, and it turned out really greasy--as well as a strange orange color :-). I will definately drain the grease next time.  I am also going to substitute ground italian sausage.  The links didn't provide a unique-enough texture for all the trouble I went to.  Other than that, I would highly recommend it!

Hmmm...one problem with this recipe. Made large batch for Mr P last night so he could heat up the leftovers this evening as I'll be working late. Trouble is, he liked it so much that he scoffed most of it in one go - so he'll be on very slim rations indeed! Made exactly as per recipe, only substituting spicy Italian sausage for sweet and basil for parsley as that's what I had to hand. Extremely tasty and presents well - would definitely serve to guests (if Himself doesn't neck the lot first). Thanks for a very quick, easy and delicious recipe.

This dish was SO good and really easy to make. I used penne instead of the bow tie pasta and I took the advice of other reviewers and used canned Italian style diced tomatos. That saved me from a lot of chopping. Instead of heavy cream, I used half and half and used corn starch to thicken up the sauce. This made the dish a bit healthier. Since my husband loves spicy food, I used Spicy Italian Sausage and still added the crushed red pepper. When my husband ate it, he was kidding around and asking me which restaurant I purchased this from. I will definitely make this again!!!

EXCELLENT DISH!!  I used only 1 14.5oz can diced tomatoes and then added 1/2 tsp dried Italian seasoning to the tomatoes before adding them to the mixture.  In addition, while sauting the onions and garlic, I added 1/2 chopped green bell pepper (maybe next time I'll add a whole one) for color and more texture.  It was wonderful.  Although all the adults found it to be the perfect amt of spice, my daughter thought it to be on the hot side.  So for her sake, I may reduce the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp. I can't wait to pass on the recipe!

This was awesome. Made this two nights ago and my husband is still commenting on how much he loved.  I made exactly as written except substituted fat free half and half for about 1/2 of the cream...just to cut down on fat.
Next time I make I will omit the oil...don't believe it is necessary as the italian sausage made enough on its own.  Also, I used the sweet (mild) italian sausage and it was plenty spicy. Thanks for the terrific recipe!  Made this in no time at all! 
5/19/08 Made again tonight.  Used all fat free half and half.  Also omitted the oil.  It was absolutely, without doubt, just as great, without lots of the fat!

I loved this!!! I used fresh red and yellow Campari tomatoes instead of canned - I cut them on a cutting board and saved the juice and added it to the sauce as well. I also added red and orange bell peppers and fresh basil and hot sausage instead of sweet. It was amazing - I will use this again for sure!!

I made a number of substitutions based on ingredients I had around the house: penne rigate for the pasta, a combo of cream, half & half and 1% milk for the cream, ground red pepper (1/8-1/4 t.) for the red pepper flakes, and crushed Italian tomatoes for the whole tomatoes.  It was delicious -- a very flexible recipe!

Nice easy mix of ingredients for the beginning cook as you really can't go wrong with this recipe....  The first time I made this, the recipe was rather mild, the second time I added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes, and Italian tomatoes with basil and garlic and it definitely provided more flavor.  If you cannot handle spicy foods, this recipe is for you.  Enjoy!

Delicious recipe and my clan loved it! I used penne pasta, Del-Monte zesty diced tomatoes with mild chile peppers and substituted fat free half and half for the heavy cream. Trust me, you don't miss the fat at all!

You know you have cooked a good meal when you catch your 10 yr old daughter licking her plate before putting it in the sink.  This dish was hands down one of my favorite recipes ever cooking from this site (and I am here constantly).  I made it as is except I forgot to put the olive oil in the skillet and I used petite diced tomatoes.  This is SUPER easy and SOOO good.  Who needs to go to restaurants when we have as good of recipes as this to put out for your family??

Another keeper from Allrecipes!  Hubby raved over this one too - which is always a triumph.  Since I was using a 16 oz. bag of bowties (aren't most pastas sold this way?  yet the recipe calls for 12 oz.) I upped the sausage to 1 1/2 lbs. (to please carnivore husband) and increased the cream to 2 cups.  I have been making cream sauces like this for years, and you can sub. half and half or light cream for the heavy cream and cut calories and fat, but no difference in taste.  I did 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup half and half.  Oh another tip - drain the sausage after browning it, before adding the onions and garlic.  Your sauce will be greasy if you don't do this.  And yes, your sauce will not be white, it will be some type of hue ranging from pink to orange, due to the tomatoes and sausage.  Some reviewers seemed surprised by that.  Also, I omitted the pepper flakes altogether and didn't miss it.  Took another reviewers advice and used 1 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of 28 oz. plum can called for.  Saves you all that chopping!  For you busy moms of young children, this is also a recipe you can make ahead of time.  I browned the sausage and made the sauce while my little one napped, and let it sit.  Then closer to dinnertime, all I had to do was cook the pasta, and let the sauce come to a simmer again (and I added a bit of cornstarch in water to get it to thicken up).  Toss together, top with shaved locatelli or parmesan, and Mangia Mangia!

Delicious!  I used penne pasta and instead of heavy cream I opted for half and half and thickened it up with cornstarch.  I added chopped red and yellow pepper for a little extra flavor and to make it a little healthier.  Like others, I also used already seasoned chopped tomatoes.  This was a very easy one dish meal to prepare.

I love this recipe, and it's quickly become a favorite in my household.  I never make any changes, though the next time I make it I'm planning on using half & half and turkey sausage, to try and cut down on some of the fat.  But as is, it's amazing!  And on that note... I wish people wouldn't review a recipe negatively and then list all the changes they've made.  You're not reviewing the original recipe, you're reviewing something you've created yourself. It's not very helpful.

Very easy, very quick and delicious for a quick weeknight dinner.  I didn't use heavy cream.  I used light cream and only about 3/4 cup.  It was a hit my husband and sons.  Will definitely become a regular dish at our house!

One of the best, most memorable recipes I've ever made.  I use hot Italian sausage because we like spicy and cream cheese since I almost never have heavy cream in the house.  Very forgiving and adaptable.  Sometimes make this with fresh broccoli florets blanched with the boiling pasta for a few minutes to give a bit more green vegetable and make a one dish meal.  Leftovers freeze beautifully for lunches at work.  Heat this in your office microwave and you will draw a crowd asking what smells so good.

Made as directed while wondering where the flavor was supposed to come from.  Wondering led to reality.  This is flavorless without adding basil or oregano or something.  Zzzzzz on flavor.

this is an awesome recipe. I also substituted FF half&half for the cream & once you mix the sauce with the bowtie pasta, the consistency is perfect! It looks too thin while it's still simmering, so don't be fooled! I will make this for guests for sure! I also sprinkled fresh basil over instead of parsley. YUMMY!

I've finally been cooking long enough that I can spot a likely winner just by reading the recipe. This is a keeper. I only did two things differently. First, I did not put oil in the pan because I knew the sausage had enough fat not to need it, even in stainless; I just preheated the pan really well. Second, I used half and half instead of cream and that worked well. And I had time to let it simmer several minutes longer. Just super. Thank you!

Made this last night for supper. After reading other reviews I used penne pasta, a 28oz can of diced tomatoes drained, chopped spinach(omitted the parsley) and a shallot instead of onion. Since my canned tomatoes wasnt seasoned I added italian seasoning. I had less than a cup of heavy cream so used 1/2 & 1/2 for the rest. This was easy and delicious on a cold winters night. Great base recipe to make per taste. The next time I may use pancetta, olives and artichoke and just omit the sausage. Thanks!

I made this with some changes based on what I had at home.  I only had a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes so I used 2 diced fresh tomatoes to make up for the lack of canned.  I used half & half instead of heavy cream and I used a package of cheese tortellini.  I thought it was good but not great.  My son thought it was terrific.  I settled on 4 stars because I would have given it 3 and he would have given it a 5!  I think some Spinach would have been a good addition - or maybe some fresh mushrooms sauteed would have been good too.  Either way, I'll probably make it again.
Thanks for a good one!

I have had this exact recipe for years with the exception that I use fresh basil in place of the parsley and I also top with fresh grated parmesan.
I cannot tell you how many times I have wrote this recipe out for friends after serving it.  It is always a hit!

Oh no!  My secret recipe is no longer secret! :) I love this dish and make it for company all the time.  I use penne pasta and buy a great loose sausage 4 cheese and herb from a local deli.  A must is to use canned plum tomatoes from San Marzano.  A little pricier, but so worth it.  And for those who have problems with acidity from tom. sauce, these tomatoes have less.  I partially drain the tomatoes and reserve the liquid in case there is any left over.  Adding the reserved liquid before microwaving makes it taste fresh again (and less gummy).  I do sprinkle some freshly grated parmsean cheese before serving.  Delish!

This exact recipe is found on the cover of Bon Appetit magazine from a winter edition in the early 90s.  It's always excellent.  If you don't use heavy cream, the acid in the tomato will curdle the dairy product.

I've been making it for YEARS and everyone loves it. You can slim it down by using half and half, light cream, or even non-fat cream. I also use petite diced tomatoes...not drained - no chopping needed and there isn't too much liquid, just add it in. Perfect quick go to meal for the family or double/triple or crowds.

Excellent! I made some significant changes though. I am allergic to tomatoes so I used pureed roasted bell peppers instead of tomatoes, and wanted it to be a little lighter so i used non-fat milk instead of heavy cream. My family loved it!

Awesome recipe. Tastes better than some restaurants. Added a few little touches that I think make it even better. Add 1/2 tsp.oregano and 8 oz. tomatoe sauce when simmering the sausage,onion, garlic and tomatoes. Don't add cream yet and simmer, covered for 1 hr. Then add 8 oz. quartered and stemmed button mushrooms and small can of sliced black olives and simmer for 30 min. Then add cream and simmer for another 30 min. Take off heat and add 3 tblsp. fresh basil. Serve over the pasta and enjoy with a nice crusty garlic bread. You won't be dissappointed. I guarantee. Killer.

This was great. The only changes that I made was substituted homemade tomato sauce (it's thick but pureed) instead of canned. and I used 1 cup of half and half. I also added fresh basil and parm cheese.

MmmmMmmm Good. Five stars for a simple, quick meal. I used penne which worked great with the sauce and my only complaint is the sauce was a tad runny, but that is probably my own dumb fault for using part cream and part 1/2 and 1/2. Do the cream all the way, you won't regret it (Just do some situps the next day). I haven't licked the bowl in a while but no one was around and well, this was worth it.

Incredibly fatty, but OH SO GOOD!  Worth every last calorie.  I used fresh tomatoes from my garden, which I blanched in the pasta water, then submerged in ice water, peeled and chopped.  I also added 2 Tablespoons of vodka with the cream and tomatoes to make the dish very elegant and special for company.  This does have a little bit of a bite to it, so if you're going to feed it to children I would recommend reducing the red pepper flakes (and not adding vodka, of course).  Thanks for the great recipe!

OMG! Sooooo good and so simple.  Very few ingredients and yet such a flavorful dish.  I highly recommend this one.  I didn't have the fresh parsley so ended up using dry parsley flakes and this was still amazing.  I made this yesterday and and want to make it again today!  Make this dish you will not regret it.

Had leftover heavy cream from another (failed) recipe, so did a search & found this one.  Had my doubts, but it is a WINNER!  Quick, easy & tasted like heaven. :)  Thank you, Linda!!  
 Update:  Not to take away from the original recipe, but I've been known to use the drained tomato juice and stir in a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit for those who find it too thin.  But it's great as written!

My husband and I don't eat a lot of pasta, but we LOVE this recipe. I have made it twice and both times were equally as good. One time I used the pre-cooked New Orleans sausage (found at Wegmans, near the bacon) and the other time I used the pre-cooked Chorizo. Both were good. The only changes that I made were that I used a little of the "juice" from the cans of Italian Tomatoes and I added sliced mushrooms and fresh chives from my garden. So good! I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This was very good. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it tastes entirely too much like the sausage party dip that I've been making for years. I only made a few changes. I used mild italian sausage to scale back on the heat a little bit. I used the plum style tomatoes but I ended up dicing them (next time I'll just buy them diced). Unfortunately, I didn't have an onion, so I substituted with sliced mushrooms (which was delicious!). I did add a little onion powder. I think I will make this again. Next time I will definitely add the onion, keep the mushrooms, add some fresh parmesan cheese, and some white wine. My biggest piece of advice is to make sure the pasta is cooked al dente and let it sit for a few minutes after you toss it with the sauce. It will make the pasta nice and creamy instead of soupy.

Very Good! I just tried this recipe and I am very pleased. I followed the ingredients exactly except I used diced tomatoes in a can ( 2- 14.5 oz cans, with juice). I added more garlic because I love garlic, and I used fresh basil instead of parsley. YUMMY. I will make this again for sure. Try this, you will love it.

I've also been making this for years, and also use turkey sausage and half & half to cut down the fat.  And you MUST drain the fat before addin the other stuff.  Another ingredient I use to "up" the tomato taste is a couple tablespoons of Sun-dried Tomato Pesto (Classico).  Mix the pasta into the sauce and heat it all together to the pasta soaks up the flavors before serving.  This dish ROCKS!

This was a quick, easy and tasty recipe!  My substitution was using Bob Evan's ground sage sausage (that is what I had on hand).  For additional flavor, I added 1/4 of freshly grated parmesan  cheese.

I was going to submit this recipe, but while searching I found it was already here!!  I got it from a friend of mine who got it from another friend... Perhaps it was this site.  Anyways, I have made this several times and it is absolutely awesome.  My recipe calls for 1/4 teaspoon instead of a half teaspoon.  I find it to be just the right amount of spice.  I have tried it using hot italian sausage as well, and it was also quite yummy, though I would stick with the sweet sausage.  FYI:  If you want to try to make a healtier version using turkey sausage, I suggest you dont.  It just is not nearly as good.  Also, when I make mine it doesnt look quite like the picture posted, and I dont think the picture is representative of the dish.  For best results, you should toss the pasta in the pan you cooked the sauce in.

Wow...this is some good pasta!!  I used some chicken and turkey sausage with habanero and green chilies in place of the italian sausage.  I didn't have to add the red pepper flakes because my sausage already had a little "kick" in it.   Thanks for the great recipe Linda!

Good recipe but do not add salt until you taste it. I deviated from recipe by using hot Italian sausage. I also oven roasted some Roma tomatoes for 40 minutes, halved and seasoned with salt and olive oil. I used them for half of the tomatoes and some organic canned for the other half. I also used equal parts heavy cream and half and half to thin and lighten it a bit. It was too salty even though I did not add the salt called for in the recipe. It was due to the sausage seasoning. At the last minute, I added some additional half and half and then sliced 8 oz. of white mushrooms and added those. My goal was to reduce the saltiness. It worked!! I also used penne pasta because I felt that a hollow shape would hold more of the sauce. We both loved this, but will not make it a regular - too high in calories, carbs and fat. But that's where all the flavor comes from!! To the leftovers, I am going to add some fresh baby spinach.

I used chicken sausage with sun dried tomato and basil, and I didn't put the red pepper flakes so that the kids would eat it. I have four children and they all loved it. I added the red pepper flakes and my husband used coarse black pepper and we both loved it.
I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and it worked out fine.

Wow.  This was so much more amazing than I thought it would be!  The only reason I cooked this was because I had all the ingredients on hand (except heavy cream; just used half and half).  It was a breeze to cook and even though hubby was late for dinner, I just couldn't wait anymore and dove right in!  When he finally came home, he had two full servings and packed the leftovers for lunch the next day!  He couldn't stop raving about this dish and wanted to give it 10 stars, lol!  Thanks for this recipe.  It rocks!

Fabulous recipe! I used regular mild Italian sausage and followed the recipe exactly except I added a bit of Dry Sack Sherry at the end. I had seen another recipe that was similar to this one but added sherry. That addition made it over the top! Great recipe. Cannot wait to make again. My husband absolutely loved this. We like spicy food but even though we only used 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, it was plenty hot. Anyone who doesn't like spicy, should reduce the amount of the red pepper.

This came out wonderfully! I was a little worried at first since I have never used cream in my pasta dishes, but I am no longer worried! I did lessen the amount of heavy cream and also substituted part of the heavy cream for cream cheese, but I am sure if I had just left in the heavy it still would have been tasty. I will be recreating this again with my own tweaks to make it a dish I can serve again and again!

WOW! This was the best pasta dish I've ever made. I used Eckrich All Beef Smoked Sausage cut to 1/2" thick, instead of the ground italian sausage. It was wonderful. The red pepper, garlic, and onions gave the sauce a ZING, but the heavy cream and tomatoes balanced it out perfectly. I absolutely loved this dish, and I will undoubtedly make it again.

Really good! Omit the oil...you don't need it. Once the sausage was 90% cooked, I placed it in a chopper and hit "pulse" a few times. Used 2 cans of Italian diced tomatoes and added chopped spinach. Didn't add parsley since my "green" was spinach. Lastly, my fiance said to make the sauce a little bit thicker. I did simmer to reduce, but I'll mix in 2 tsp of cornstarch to the heavy cream next time.

Excellent as written, but definitely room for changes based on personal preference.  I personally feel that this recipe screams for 6-8oz fresh, chopped spinach added when the onions/garlic are just about done.  I've also added green or red peppers and minced celery.

LIGHTER VERSION - for a still very tasty, but significant reduction in fat/calories:

-use turkey sausage
-omit or reduce olive oil
-substitute ff evaporated milk for cream (adds a slightly cooked flavor, but it is concealed by the other flavors of this dish)

I think the next time I make this I will add sun dried tomatoes and asparagus hearts.  It is a very versitle recipe.  I added black olives and it was a great addition.

This is a very delicious recipe. I like to use the ground Italian sausage in mild, rather than the sweet.

Great recipe - delicious, easy and presents beautifully!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used canned diced tomatoes.  I did not drain them - the sauce seems runny, but it's actually the perfect amount as it absorbs into the pasta.  I did not add the red pepper flakes but used fresh ground pepper instead.  I added about 5 handfuls of fresh spinach to the sauce mixture before tossing it with the pasta.  Definitely add some grated locatelli (pecorino romano) for a delicious added dimension.  Thanks for the amazing recipe Linda - this will become part of my repertoire!

I thought this was wonderful.  Easy and pretty, too.  I'm not a big sausage fan, but I loved this.  I plan to make it again using shrimp instead.

Great recipe! Very flexible. I added diced green bell peppers and portabella mushrooms to mine. For anyone saying that the sauce is runny, you are probably pouring the mixture over the pasta when you actually have to pour the mixture into the pot of boiled pasta and let it sit over a low flame for a minute so that the pasta can absorb the mixture.

We really enjoyed this recipe. 

I used 2 cups half and half, added a few sliced mushrooms, and added about 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan. I used diced tomatoes but chopped them up before using so they weren't so chunky. Also, I did drain the grease after coooking the sausages.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Next time, I may try using 1/4 of the italian sausage and using some shrimp instead. The only criticism that I have is that there was too much sausage so I will cut down on it next time. Even so - excellent recipe and a change from the usual red sauce.

An absolutely fabulous dish!  I even used jarred spaghetti sauce for the tomatoes, penne for the bow ties, 1% milk for the cream, sweet and hot sausages mixed and the results were terrific.  This will be a regular part of our diet.

I loved this.  Next time I will use spicy sausage though--I like things a little hotter.  I added about a teaspoon of Emeril's Bayou Blast (cajun seasoning) to this and it was fabulous.  My husband said this one's definitely a keeper and it was twice as good leftover the next day!

This is great! I substituted the sausage with chicken sausage and left out the parsley because I didn't have any. I also used a 28oz can of pre-diced tomatoes and the whole 1lb. box of bow tie pasta which helped absorb the sauce, as the sauce only slightly thickens, and there is quite a bit otherwise. Very good and easy! The whole family enjoys!
Update: I often use crumbled sweet Italian sausage and replace the heavy cream with 2% milk mixed with about 1-2T flour. I also almost always use a frozen box of green peas in this as well. It's great!

It's real quick and easy, and absolutely delicious and rich. After a few tries at it, I decided to add some cayenne and a few dashes of sriacha sauce. I like mine a a bit spicy, but it's honestly great with or without my preference.

This was pretty good! I used Mostaccioli pasta instead and used a can of diced tomatoes. Good recipe.

This was so good...even better the next day! I almost prefer there to be more chunks of tomato in it though. I used a large can (whole tomatoes) and a small can (chopped), and I could have probably used 2 large cans easily! The tomato and the sausage just paired perfectly together. Soo tasty! I added some corn starch to thicken up the sauce in the end because it just wasn't as thick as I wanted it. Also, I have no idea why anyone would cook the sausage in oil. Isn't there enough fat in sausage already?

Great! I used 1 lb. hot italian sausage and still added ground red pepper (I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I halved the amount and used ground), and the spiciness was good, and still mild.  I also topped each serving with a few marinated artichoke hearts, and that really added a nice contrast.  My husband loved it.  I will be making this one again.

This was very yummy, it was much spicier that I had expected it to be though!  So my kids didn't really eat it, but I liked it a lot!

I LOVE this recipe.  I used canned diced italian style tomatoes and didn't drain them.  The juice from the tomatoes mixed with the heavy cream make an excellent light sauce!  I have also added fresh spinach and olives before.  It is really good and the whole family loved it!

This was excellent. I added 8 oz frozen chopped spinach (after microwaving it until hot) to it for vegies and my kids still loved it.  I also added a cup of grated romano cheese. Delish!

Easy and delicious!  Will definitely make this again - only thing I might add are some capers.  I used turkey sausage and it was great without the grease.

Quick, easy, and satisfying. Made as written until at the end. I decided to add canned white beans Along with the tomatoes/cream for more texture. It actually worked out really well.

Awesome recipe. Made it as written, but with bulk medium sausage. Will definately make again.   Only suggestion (as others mentioned), after cooking the sausage be sure to drain the grease.

Having never made this before, I took a chance by inviting another couple over for dinner and making this dish.  It was outstanding!  I didn't change a thing, but I did read quite a few of the reviews and felt pretty confident that it would be a winner.  Thank you, thank you and thank you again.  I'll definitely be making this dish again...not too soon because of the calories, but it is now a part of my repertoire.

This was very good but I felt like there was too much liquid.  Never thickened.  I used spicy italian sausage and a can of diced tomatoes (drained).  Will definitely make again, just will decrease the amount of cream next time.

I made this 2 weeks ago, except I used a 16 oz. pkg of bow tie pasta, and I used cayenne pepper rather than the red pepper flakes (same amount) since I didn't have the flakes on hand.  My husband & I absolutely loved it.  Nothing needs to be changed, it has the best flavor combination.  My husband said this recipe belongs on the menu at our favorite italian restaurant, Carinos.  Yes...it's that good!  I was planning our Valentine dinner this morning & asked my husband what "favorite meal" he would like me to make, and he wanted this again!  I have passed this recipe out to co-workers & also have told them about this website.  Great recipes, thanks for sharing!!

So simple, yet incredible flavour! I did not change a thing, and it was perfect. The "sauce" will appear quite thin, but it is meant to be mixed in to the pasta so that the pasta soaks up all of that deliciousness, and not used as a traditional sauce would be by pouring over the top. A keeper!

I've made a similar version of this dish for years....I use chopped campari tomatoes and heavy cream - and I also add chopped fresh rosemary and thyme -  ground into a paste with mortar and pestle - about 1 tsp each - into the saute pan.  Each time I serve it, we can't believe how good it is - with such simple ingredients.

I made this for dinner tonight and really liked it. I made a few changes to fit what I had on hand. I never use extra oil when browning ground meat so I skipped the olive oil. I used bulk sweet Italian sausage so that saved having to remove the casings. I used a full cup of onions, cause we love 'em, and I used diced fire roasted tomatoes with garlic, in addition to the 3 cloves of minced garlic called for in the recipe, 'cause we love garlic too. :-) I used 3/4 cup heavy cream and 3/4 cup half & half and I added 5 oz. of sliced fresh mushrooms right after adding the garlic. I also added 6 oz. of fresh baby spinach leaves right before I tossed in the hot pasta to boost the nutrition value. I used a full pound of farfalle and I sprinkled fresh shredded parmesan over each bowl before serving. Since I used spinach, I skipped the parsley as well. Everything else was as written. The flavor was mild and it didn't thicken up quite as much as I would have liked (probably since I didn't use all heavy cream), but it was really tasty and definitely something I will make again. With a full pound of pasta and the added veggies, this made a ton. When I can stretch a pound of meat to feed 6 and have leftovers, AND it tastes good, I'm very happy. Thanks!!

We enjoyed this, but we'd have liked it more if it had called for cooking the onion and sausage together, then draining all liquid, browning the garlic in the olive oil, then adding the sausage & onion back in and proceeding. So that's what I'll do henceforth. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! When pork was done, I seasoned it with about tsp of dried basil and italian seasoning. I added about a cup of baby spinach to mixture while it was simmering. To thicken sauce a bit I added 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch. I topped it off with fresh grated Pecorino Romano & Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.  Great!  A huge hit!!!

This was very very good plus quick!! I added a bit more garlic, used regular diced tomatos (what I had on hand, and local handmade green chili flavored fettuccine because thats what I had. Family enjoyed this and I had dinner on the table in a reasonable amount of time.

I all I can say is this was amazing and I used 1/2 and 1/2 (only a cup ~ which I will cut down to 3/4s of a cup next time because it's even so good without it).  I used spicy chicken sausage and whole wheat egg noodles.  DH said it is the *best pasta ever* and I healthy'd it up!  This is a winner and will be a regular at our house.  I did add some mushrooms that I had in the fridge. YUUUUUMMMMMYYYYY.  Thanks.

I was suggested this recipe at the Recipe Exchange here at the site and I am so glad I did it! I didn't have any heavy cream and so I used 1/2 & 1/2 as so many did in the reviews and it worked great. I also added almost a cup of parmesan cheese that I was surprised I didn't see much of in the reviews for alteration and I would do it again, delish! It's a keeper, thanks all!

Given the simplicity of the dish - this was ridiculously good!!  We used mildly spicy Italian sausage, so we omitted the red pepper flakes.  We also used seasoned diced tomatoes and increased the garlic to 4 cloves.  The end result was so yummy - and totally guest worthy fare.

This was amazing.  Made it for the 2 of us - though I am quite health-conscious so I substituted lean Italian turkey sausage as well as half and half.  Prepared as written, though I simmered for closer to 20 minutes to thicken a bit more (since I didn't use the heavy cream).  Stirred in dried parsley (didn't have fresh) at the end and then topped with quality grated parmesan.  This, along with some great red wine, made an INCREDIBLE meal!  Will definitely make again for "date night." ;o)

This was very good, and easy to prepare. I only used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, undrained.  I didn't put the crushed red pepper in the cooked dish, but added to my plate.  Added plenty of freshly shredded basil and some grated parm. and you're good to go! I only wish I could have found FF H&H to make this with tonight.  I feel incredibly guilty eating this, but it was oh so good!

The simplicity is incredible and the end results are a taste to behold. Altough my fellow cooks had some fantastic additions and alternatives, I stayed with the basic receipe so as to a taste baseline. I used the San Marzano peeled Italian tomatoes, used some of the packing puree and chopped the tomatoes w/ my chefs knife. I made this meal in the morning and allowed the meat, onion,garlic and tomato mixture to simmer for about one hour. I removed from heat and let sit covered until service later that day.Approx-imaely 30 minutes prior to service I warmed the meat mixure and than added the cream. Very happy w/ the results

We really liked this, although I used a combination of this recipe and an almost identical one on another recipe website. I used half sweet and half hot sausage, omitted the pepper flakes, didn't drain the tomatoes but cooked them down instead, less cream (about half) and lots of fresh basil instead of parsley. Mmmm...goood.

I barely made any changes: I used penne pasta instead of bow tie; canned regular Italian style tomatoes instead of plum; and turkey sausage instead of pork.  This meal was FANTASTIC!  Great with a green salad and Italian bread.  I will make this MANY TIMES to come!  Thank you!

Wow is right!  This pasta is incredible.  I cooked Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage with the garlic, onion & chopped red, yellow & orange bell peppers.  I used an entire pint of cream and fresh basil instead of parsley. Yummy and ever bit as good reheated!

I have made this recipe so many times.  Great for a casual get together with friends.  Very comforting.  Make sure to add the red pepper flakes, it really adds the flavor!  Try to drain the meat when you are done browning it, the extra grease can make the sauce thin.

I was so excited to try this recipe that I didn't wait to buy the heavy cream. I used half and half and it was wonderful! Can't wait to try it the way it was intended.

Awesome!  Doesn't get any better than this at even the best Italian restaurant and a mere fraction of the cost too!  In the words of my husband, sausage really makes this recipe great. I used chorizo sausage (don't think the sausage type really matters just as long as you like that type) and added some chopped scallions in addition to the onions and WOW what a meal.  Leftovers are just as good - put a little olive oil in the bottom of a pan, throw in the leftovers and perhaps add some canned diced tomatoes just to loosen up the sauce. Top with "parmigiano-reggiano" if you choose. Molto Buono!

I left out the onion, and added saute'd mushrooms to the sauce.  I cooked spicy andouile sausage separately and added to each individual plate.  This was pretty good, made a huge amount though and my family doesn't eat leftovers well.  It does reheat nicely though and it was a quick meal.  Thanks!

This was great. Next time I would try the spicy sausages and use 1 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk to cut down on fat. A definite keeper.

This was yummy.  I used milk instead of the heavy cream, and we garnished with sliced black olives and grated parmesian cheese.  It's great as leftovers.  My son requested that I make this again. :)

The whole family loved this.  I will use drained stewed tomatoes in the future.  I may even use spicy italian sausage with a little sugar for some zing. My husband said that this dish could save a bad marriage...LOL!

I love this recipe!  I have found that you need to make it with the sweet basil sausage or it just isn't the same.  If I don't have Italian style tomatoes I just use a can of regular tomatoes and add Italian season the them before cooking.  On occasion I add in spinach for nutritional value and substitute the cream for lactose free milk, I just have to be careful not to boil or it will separate.  And don't skimp on the parsley!

I tried this recipe and did everything exactly the same. It was very good. But I felt like it was missing something so I added 1/3 cup of hunts italian sausage sauce and it gave it the perfect taste sweet from the hunts sauce and spicy from the red pepper flakes. Great recipe

Loved it.  My husband who is picky even said he liked it and it had flavor.  The best part was watching the video, she spoke slow enough and I paused each step so I got it right.  I wish I could eat it every night.  Usually I make the same pasta dishes all the time but I just decided to google past recipes and wala. The only thing I changed was putting light cream instead of heavy. Definitaly 5 stars

SO GOOD. Even my husband, who is an extremely picky eater, went back to have seconds of this (that's very high praise from him). The flavor is amazing and easily customizable. My 1 year old daughter couldn't get enough either, it's creamy and delicious. Definitely a keeper recipe!

This recipe is so incredible that, after years of using this website, I'm FINALLY writing a review. I just feel it's necessary to let everyone know how delicious and easy this dish is! Make it with no changes st all (ok, I do add a bit of Parmesan cheese in top before eating!) You will not be disappointed.

This was fantastic! The only changes I made were to use fresh instead of canned tomatoes with Italian seasoning and to add sauteed bell peppers because I had some I wanted to use up.

very good. did not take out the sausage from the casings; just boiled, browned and cut the sausage then started making my sauce. Also, did not have the plum tomatoes so I used crushed tomatoes!

I loved it. Although, I made several modifications: I used mild turkey sausage (wegmans brand) instead of italian sweet sausage because I am limited my pork intake. I also used light cream instead of heavy whipping cream to reduce the calorie content. Lastly, I used whole wheat bowtie pasta, again a personal preference.  Overall nice dish, will make again, but I'll use hot turkey sausage to give more spicy flavor, just my preference.

Great flavor! I would also recommend draining the grease once you finish browning the sausage, but other than that this was a very easy recipe.

This turned out very good, but a little rich d/t the cream.  It could use a little more seasoning though- maybe next time I'll use spicy sausage

As written, the recipe is OK, but there is too much sauce for that amount of pasta. That's why people are saying it's soupy.In my experience it takes about 3/4 cup of brothlike sauce to coat 4 ounces of dry pasta. As the recipe calls for 12 ounces of dry pasta, that works out to be 2 1/4 cups of sauce. The liquids alone in this recipe come out to 4 1/2 cups, and that doesn't include bulk from the sausage or onions. Try halving the sauce ingredients. Also, for a flavor boost, try adding 1/2 tsp lightly-crushed fennel seeds while browning the sausage and 2 Tbsp chopped fresh basil as you toss the pasta with the sauce.

Made this tonight for my wife and son, it was an easy to make dad's cooking night meal. I had read some of the other comment and made a couple of changes. I used half and half cream,  a can of crushed Italian tomatoes and used dried parsley. to help thicken the sauce I used about 3 teaspoons of cornstarch, definitely will make this again

Easy and satisfying.  My only critique is that the parsley didn't really add anything and didn't seem to go well with the other flavors.  I'd skip it next time.  It might be good with some fresh basil, or even parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.

I made this tonight with a few alterations just to lower the fat content. While the bowties were boiling, I cooked my sausage in a separate skillet while I sauteed onion, green pepper & garlic in olive oil in a larger one. I then added a carton of imported plum tomatoes and a tsp of italian seasoning to the veggies. After the sauce reduced for about 10min, I then added the drained sausage and red pepper flakes. Last I added 8 oz of half & half and about 1/4 of grated parmesan. Cooked it until the sauce thickened and Oh my, so yummy !! Not too terribly hot but the red pepper flakes definitely added a zing. I will definitely keep this recipe handy for a "go to" alternative to spaghetti with meat sauce. Great recipe easy and delicious. Thanks!

My family absolutely loves this recipe.  For those who are having trouble with the sauce, here's a couple of pointers.  First, there is no need to chop the tomatoes before you put them in the pan.  I use a can of whole, peeled tomatoes (in juice) and pour them right into the pan.  Then, I pull out my potato masher & mash them right up in the pan.  Next, it is imperative to mix the cooked pasta into the sauce mix and let it sit for a few minutes before serving.  Do not rinse the pasta - you need the starch to thicken up the sauce.  We've also tried the recipe with bacon in place of the sausage - both options are equally delicious.  I also like to use poultry sausage instead of traditional pork sausage to lighten it up a little bit.  That may be a good option for those who are saying it is too greasy.  I alo like to use penne instead of bow tie pasta as it holds the sauce better.

loved it! I followed the recipe to a "T". I should've made this 4 stars because it looked too thin. I added a 1/2 can of tomato paste to thicken it up. Yummm!

YUM!  This is a very simple and tasty recipe.  Based on other reviews I used fat free half and half and diced Italian tomatoes.  I also used it Italian bulk sausage (couldn't find sweet) and did't use oil as the browning the sausage will be plenty oily...  (don't forget to drain the sausage after browning!).  Other than that, made exactly as the recipe states.  It was VERY good.  I'll make it again for sure as it's a no brainer and very satisfying.  And I have plenty of re-heatable leftovers!  Next time, I will probably add some diced bell pepper and try hot Italian sausage (I love hot stuff).  Thanks for sharing!  :)

Really good but if you don't like things too spicy, cut the red pepper flakes in half or forget it entirely.

WOW! Very impressive! I took one readers advice and used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, instead of 1/2 becasue my family doesn't like things very spicy. Other than that, I made it exactly according to the recipe. Even my picky 9 year old son said, on a scale of 1-10, it was a 9! He said I should open up my own restaurant! ;o) Easy to make and just delicous! Thank you so much for sharing!!!

Prepared this dish for dinner last night and it was very tasty.  The sauce was a little soupy but a spoon solved that problem.  The only changes I made were: I used a whole onion, chopped, used a 28 ounce can of Cento Chef's cut with juice, 2 cups heavy cream, 1 T. dried parsley, 1 T. dried basil and 1 T. cajun spice.  The only change I would make next time is to double the Italian sausage as I feel it got lost in the sauce.  Great recipe.

My very picky family really enjoyed this recipe.  They even went back for seconds!  I gave this 4 stars because i did find it a bit bland and needing extra spice to kick it up. It's a great starter recipe though! I made a few changes based on what i had on hand.  I used a can of stewed tomatoes that i mixed italian spices into, and instead of removing the casings and crumbling the sausage, i just cut it into bite size links. I didn't add oil when cooking the sausage as i felt that was a little too much grease, and I used penne instead of bowtie pasta. Before serving I used a lite sprinkle of grated parmesan on top.  Next time, i will spice it up a bit more with seasonings and i will use extra tomatoes as I feel they add a great flavour to this recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

This is a really fast, really easy, really dee-lish dish.  Don't have to change a thing, but you could use the recipe as a basis for any sort of meat or fish or any kind of pasta.  Great flavor and a crowd pleaser.  Thanks for something new for dinner!

Update: Took others' advice and sauteed onion and garlic along with sausage without adding olive oil.  There's enough fat in the sausage.  Absolutely drain rendered fat before continuing.  Such a great, simple recipe.  Thanks again!

First recipe in a while that my husband actually commented on. Said it was delicious! Read the authors notes and added the bow ties to the cooking sauce on the stove and the thickness of the sauce was perfect. Didn't make any changes other than I used 1/3lb sausage and cut everything else in 1/2 and it was a little more than enough for one hungry man. He asked that I make this again. I'll be saving this one to my recipe box!

This was an easy and delicious recipe. Unfortunately, I used a can of Rotel (didn't discover I was out of canned tomatoes until I'd already done my shopping) and that made the dish a little spicier for wimpy me, but it was perfect for my hubby. So, if you like your dishes spicy, use Rotel. The cream sauce this made was absolutely tasty. This is a keeper!

Very delicious!!! I only had 1/2c cream and the rest I used whole milk which is what I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for this keeper.

Didn't have heavy cream or canned tomatoes so I substituted the cream for half and half with cornstarch and I used fresh tomatoes. I also used spicy sausage, added a lot more garlic (we're garlic people) and fresh spinach. I knew the sauce wasn't going to go far because I didn't have a lot of half and half either, so I also buttered and parsleyed the pasta before topping it with sauce. My husband and I were fighting for who would get the leftovers. Heads up: If you're going with spicy sausage leave out the red pepper flakes.

Made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I loved it.  More or less stuck to the recipe.  We used mild italian sausage just because I grabbed the wrong kind at the store.  There were only plain roma tomatoes instead of the italian style so when I added them to the pan I also added a teaspoon of italian seasoning.  We did use the heavy cream but did need to add cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.  Overall, very easy to make and delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

Outstanding! I reduced the sauce until it was ALMOST where I wanted it, and then took it off the stove to cool for the right consistancy. (Used Half and Half). Poured it over the pasta and it was absolutely perfect! Really hit the spot! WOW!!

I used half sweet and half spicy sausage, which was the perfect amount of heat (omitting the need for red pepper flakes).  The kids loved it and that's all that mattered to me.

Everyone I have made this for absolutely loves this recipe. Have made exactly as written. Excellent. Made it again with fresh tomatoes rather than canned plum. Better. Have substituted different meats including hot sausage and chicken. All excellent. We make this dish often. It is one of the few that all of my five children enjoy and will come to the dinner table.

This was AMAZING!!!! I followed the recipe as closely as I could, but instead of heavy cream I used light cream, instead of bow tie pasta I used tri color rotini, used italian parsley and did not have any red pepper flakes to put in. I do think the red pepper flakes would have made it even better but I really liked it how it was. We put grated parmesean cheese on top, and had it with garlic bread. Even my extremely picky 3 year old gobbled it right up, and she hardly ever eats all of the food on her plate. I think the amount of sauce with the pasta was perfect and the flavors blended together so well. We will be making this one again for sure :)

it's a good, quick recipe to whip together.  I used penne rather then bow ties, omitted the oil, used hot italian sausage instead of sweet and added half a bag of frozen spinach.  I cooked the sausage, red pepper flakes, onion, garlic and half a bag of frozen spinach all at the same time.  I followed the recipe  besides that.

4.5!  Very good.  I did add about 1 Tbsp fresh basil to the sauce and a sprinkle of Parmesan to garnish.  I also sauteed the sausage in a tiny bit of water instead of the oil and only used 1 cup cream.

This is a quick, easy and delicious pasta dish.  To make it just a smidgeon less calories, I used chicken sausage.   Also, I didn't drain the canned tomatoes and added a little less heavy cream which made an excellent lighter sauce.  We really enjoyed it.

I used two cans of mild Rotel (tomatoes with chilis) instead of plum tomatoes and omitted the red pepper.  I also used coconut milk instead of cream. Not canned coconut milk but the alternative milk similar to soy.  Very good.  I had to use cornstarch to thicken since I subbed the cream.  I also added a package of chopped broccoli defrosted. YUM

Very good and a nice change of pace from my usual pasta dishes. I made the following changes based on our preferences or what I had on hand: omitted the olive oil, used crushed tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, reduced heavy cream to 1 cup, and omitted the parsley. It came out really good and even better the next day. I think next time I'll try making it with ground turkey instead of sausage. I'm just not a huge fan of sausage but my husband LOVED it.

This recipe turned out awesome! I did what another commentor mentioned, which was to drain the sausage prior to mixing in the onion or garlic. Definitely helped cut down on some of the grease. I also may experiment with vegetarian ground beef (soy) next time!

This meal was really good! I followed it mostly the same. I didnt have fresh parsely, so had used dried parsley, and I didnt have heavy cream so I had to sub. with melted butter milk and flour. It turned out great though. I think next time I will experiment with the turkey sausage someone suggested. I only rated it 4 stars because it felt like something was missing.. so Im going to be experimenting with this a bit. BUT my tomato hating husband cleaned his plate so that says something! :)

Very delicious! The longer the sauce absorbs into the pasta, the better it gets! It tastes even better as leftovers. We also topped this with shredded parmesan/romano cheese. Yum!

I really liked the flavor that this had. I also added a bit more pepper flakes to give a kick and used Turkey sweet Italian sausage. I couldn't find any plum tomatoes, so I used 2 (14oz) cans of Italian herb diced tomatoes. It was overall easy to make and I'm curious to see about using 1/2 and 1/2 next time to make it more calorie friendly. The liquid didn't quite simmer down or thicken as much as I would like. So, I added a bit of flour to make it thicker and once I added the pasta it was perfect. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the orangish color it had. Not very appetizing in look, but in flavor it was pretty good.

Delicious!! We all loved it! I think next time I am going to try to increase the sauce. There wasn't enough to suit our tastes. It doesn't reheat well either.

This was good, but next time I'll use less pasta.  There wasn't enough sauce for my liking.  And, the sauce itself was a little bland.  The sausage added all the flavor.

After reading the reviews, I decided to try this recipe. I must agree that this is a good meal! I wasn't too sure about the cream part with tomatoes & sausage, but it went great together. I would like to add for those who didn't know (like myself) that heavy cream is the same thing as heavy "whipping" cream. For those who are spicy dish lovers like myself, I would add more red pepper flakes.

The recipe as it is listed needs some tweaking in my opinion. I added 1 cup of cream, and it was still quite rich. There could be more tomatoes to make it a better sauce in my opinion. I also doubled the amount of red pepper flakes. When we served it, we discovered it was delicious with a generous sprinkling of black pepper. Yum! Lastly, next time I make this I will add broccoli or spinach to make it healthier.

We thought this was great!!  I usually don't change recipes but the couple of changes I did on this did not change the taste.  I used turkey italian sausage, canned stewed tomatoes, 2 cups of cream and fresh basil instead of parsley.  Easy, will definately make again!! I also added extra red pepper flakes.

It was okay..I only had crushed Italian style tomatoes...but I wouldn't think it would have made much of a difference with the taste. I also used half n half instead of the heavy cream. Maybe if I used hot sausage instead of the sweet it would have tasted better.

This was good, but not out of this world.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  If I make this again, I would probably use half the amount of sausage.  It overwhelmed the dish a bit.

I have had this recipe in my RB for a long time, so decided to try it tonight.  I have never had my DH rave about many other dishes as he did about this one.  He said this is definately a repeat meal.  I did make just a cpl small changes, 1) Used Jimmy Dean Italian sauage in the roll, 2) used 2 -14 oz cans of Italian seasoned tomatoes , as this is what I had on hand.  So very good!!   Thanks Linda!!

Very good. Didn't totally drain the tomatoes and ended up with a nice orange sauce. Someone else called it odd, but I really liked the color.

Wow!  This recipe is out of this world good!  I used red cayenne pepper (1/8tsp) instead of red pepper flakes as I did not have the latter on hand.  I also used canned stewed Italian style tomatoes (all I had on hand).  I read many of the reviews before cooking and did not have any problem with the sauce as some mentioned.  I thought the sauce was a perfect consistency to mix with the pasta.  Absolutely wonderful... husband says "wow... that's awesome!"  Thanks so much for sharing.

This recipe is excellent! The flavors are so good together. I made 2 minor changes. I used 2 (14 oz) cans petite diced tomatoes with the liquid and I used 1 c light cream and 1/2 c heavy cream to cut the fat. We loved this so much, we ate the leftovers for 2 days.  I would definitely make this again.

This was very very good. I added a pkg. of sliced baby bella mushrooms while sauteing the onion & garlic. When almost done added _drained_ fire-roasted diced tomatoes. Started pasta at same time tomatoes were added. When most of the moisture had cooked off added cream and an occasional sprinkle of parmesan cheese to help thicken.  The finished sauce was added to the cooked pasta when done. Used a little saved pasta water to add back to keep moist if needed.

I often use recipes from this site and never post reviews, but I just had to make an exception and say -- wow! Made this tonight for dinner, and the poor dog didn't end up with his usual plates to lick 'cause my husband and I both cleaned our plates too well. I used a few of the other reviewers' suggestions and added some chopped bell pepper, Italian seasoning and parmesan cheese. And since I had already had a one pound package of half hot/half sweet Italian sausage on hand I used that. Some of the cream sauce was absorbed by the pasta, giving it exceptional flavor.  An amazingly quick and simple recipe for such a yummy dish; thanks so much for sharing!

Delicious!  I used Penne pasta because I thought it would hold the sauce nicely, and it did.  I used basil instead of parsley, just because that it is what I prefer.  Other than that, I made it as directed and we LOVED it.

Five stars with several changes! Great recipe. I made some changes I put a little less cream I put about 1/4 cup less and I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of corn starch to thicken the sauce. I also added some Italian seasonings from the McCormick Italian grinder,some garlic salt, some oregano, onion powder, and chili powder. With these changes it was delicious. The recipe is a good base but a little too boring.

EXCELLENT!!  I have 3 kids.  ALL of them LOVED it.  My fiance loved it too (and he's a cook!).  I did use the fat free half and half cream.  The only thing I would change would be I would add a little more spicey spices to give it more zing.  Other than that, it's perfect

Absolutely delicious! I mixed the entire can of plum tomatoes, juice and all and then chopped them with my spoon while cooking. I also love the idea someone wrote of adding spinach because I felt like the dish could have used a green vege in it. I can't wait to try it next time I make this dish.

This is an easy and very tasty recipe.  Also works with plain diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning added.  If you like your food spicier, add a little more crushed pepper.  I used a teaspoon instead of a half teaspoon and it was just right for us.  This one is a keeper!

So good. I pretty much follow the original recipe and it was soooo good. I will definitely make it again. Oh...like other comments, you need to drain the grease before putting in tomatoes and cream.

Great recipe! My husband ate 3 helpings and then asked if he could have the rest for lunch the next day! My only addjustment would to maybe use a bit less pasta next time as I found it took up almost all the sauce once added together after a shot time on the stove. It tasted excellent otherwise! Will definately make again!

Wow! Fantastic recipe...I don't review recipes very often but this was so easy and delicious!  I used garlic and cheese sausages because that was what I had on hand, and 2 14 oz cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes but other than that, followed the recipe.  I did end up simmering this for about an hour (my hubby was delayed at work) and it made the sausage super tender and the sauce very rich and thick.  Super good!

Edible, but not memorable.  Based on the reviews, I was expected MUCH more!!  I'm an experienced cook who made it according to the recipe, but this dish lacked flavor and was quite watery.  Won't make it again.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes from this site!  It is outstanding.  I have served it to many, many people for serveral years now and it is ALWAYS a winner.  I have also shared the recipe with many and it is very easy.  You can used other pastas other than bow tie if you don't have it, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  It is perfect as is!

Great recipe! I made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it. I did add a few more spices (italian spaghetti spices) to give it a little more flavor and I love spicy foods so I added double the red pepper flakes. Thanks for this great recipe.

This had really good flavor. I used skim milk and cornstarch instead of cream. Cream would have been better, but we are health conscious. I used 2-14 oz. cans of Basil, garlic, and oregano flavored tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, and I decreased the amount of salt.

Really good!  I didn't have any italian plum tomatoes on hand but I had a can of crushed and that worked great; I just dumped them right in.  Also, I'm not a red pepper person, so I omitted them.  This recipe is a bit bland without them, so if you aren't going to use them you might need to find another way to give this recipe some punch.

INCREDIBLE! I made this for my sausage-loving, pasta-reluctant husband.  He LOVED it!  He was also excited that we had a lot of leftovers for future meals. This is a simple recipe with a complex flavor.  It doesn't get better than that.  I followed the recipe closely, but I made modifications.  I did not use the pepper flakes.  I have a 5-year old who would have gone through the roof.  As it was, the dish had a "kick" due to the Italian sausage.  I would add the pepper for guests.  (I would also add a great wine). I bought ground sausage in a roll so that removing a casing was not necessary.    I used canned diced Italian tomatoes.  I thought it would be easier than chopping them. I think that is the problem people are having.  I would recommend draining the tomatoes first.  The sauce did thicken, but it required more time to reduce than suggested in the recipe.    This was an absolutely fabulous dish.  It would be great for company or just as a casual "comfort" dish after a long day.  Thank you to Linda for posting this one!

Subbed 2 cans of Rotel for the tomatoes and omitted the red pepper flakes.  Spicy, delicious, and extremely Derek-friendly.

Beyond awesome! I followed the recipe as close as I could, only using half-n-half thickened up with a bit of cornstarch, adding 8 oz. fresh mushrooms and sprinkling a little romano cheese over each serving. This needed just a little more half-n-half as I did add mushrooms, but WOO-EE, is this heaven! This is high class Hamburger Helper! This one is a keeper. No leftovers.

Wow, I was so amazed by how well this came out.  It was just delicious.  It was so easy to cook that I wasn't expecting so much gorgeous flavor but it really tasted great.  I only made a couple of changes: 1) I used sliced Trader Joe's sweet chicken sausage and it worked just fine; 2) I threw in a couple of fistfuls of fresh spinach and a yellow bell pepper to add color and health to the recipe.  The other big thing that happened which really helped was, right as I was done cooking the sauce, my boyfriend called and said he would be home late from work.  Thus, I let the sauce sit for a half hour before he got home.  During that time, the sauce thickened and reduced a bit.  I think this actually really helped with the consistency issue that other reviewers have mentioned.  Plus, it is really important to mix the cooked pasta in with the sauce.  The pasta will also absorb sauce.  When my boyfriend got home, I just turned on the burner for a couple of minutes to heat it up and it was just delicious.  My boyfriend usually doesn't provide much by the way of feedback but in this instance, he went out of his way to say how much he loved it.  So great - thank you for the recipe!

SO Yummy! The sausage DEFINITELY makes this! I used Trader Joe's Spicy Italian Chicken Sausage. For me, I didn't need to drain any grease. I used drained diced can tomatoes & added Italian Seasoning & some Dried Basil & Dried Oregano. I topped it off with a little parsley & basil, plus grated parmensean cheese. THIS WILL DEFINITELY BECOME A REGULAR IN MY HOUSEHOLD! Next time I think I might added some sauted mushrooms or chopped frozen spinach.

This recipe was good, but for the amount of fat in it, I would expect something phenomenal. I think I'll search for a healthier version if I get a pasta craving again.

I must admit I was a little nervous with this one. My husband saw the recipe and said "Pasta with... CREAM???" It wasn't thickening after simmering with the half n half, so I added a lil flour and parmesan cheese. It wasn't pretty, but it was DELICIOUS!!! The whole family loved it! My second sucessful home cooked dinner this week! Yay! Thanks so much for this one. Everyone insisted it go into rotation!

I made this for dinner the other night & I was not disappointed!  I did add a can of drained mushrooms, just because I love them.  Instead of heavy cream, I used part evaporated milk & part fat free half & half.  Delicious!

This is SOO good. Instead of Kielbasa, I added some spicy Italian sausage, and a LOT of garlic. I will continue making this for years to come:) Thank you.

This was ok.  Next time I will use shallots instead of onions for a more mild flavor to go along with the creaminess.  Also I would add the red pepper flakes last instead of sauteing them.

This recipe was delicious and practically fool proof! I'm eating the left overs a I type for lunch today. Changes: I used hot italian turkey sausage, two cans of diced italian style tomatoes, added tri color peppers because I just happened to have them, and I omitted the red pepper flakes since I didn't have any. Very yummy and reheats well! Thank you

This was very easy to prepare and tasty too.  I used pork sausage as that is what I had and half & half.  I would make this again.

This is so simple and quick to make and truly delicious. I made this exactly as written and while I was making it I thought I had made this before.  Sure enough, I found the exact recipe but it called for penne pasta.  After eating this with the bow ties we felt that the penne pasta went better.  Only a preference though - defintely try this.  I never have leftovers.

So good. I don't usually like Italian sausage but this was delicious. I used hot Italian sausage so it was spicy, my husband thougt it was too much (wimp) but I thought it was great. Maybe next time I'll use sweet sausage instead or just omit the red pepper so hubby can enjoy it too.

Good and easy.  For cream, I used part 1/2&1/2 and part sour cream.  Can also use milk and sour cream.

This recipe is just right for my tastes. I love creamy pastas, as well as spicy dishes. However, I did have to make some adjustments according to what I had on hand. Let's see...used pipette pasta, a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes, a can of sliced mushrooms, dried minced onion, dried parsley, half and half and a bit of grated pecorino romano cheese. Most of the time when I cook, I don't measure my ingredients- I make everything to taste. Since I used half and half, my 'sauce' was quite runny- mostly b/c I was too impatient to let it thicken up. But that's okay- b/c the sausage soaks up the creaminess of the sauce. This recipe is easily adjusted to taste; it is highly recommended. UPDATE 30JUL08: I made this again last night and decided to go with heavy cream, fresh sliced mushrooms, and fresh chopped tomatoes (ran out of canned)with dried Italian seasoning. It was better than I remembered.

This is a GREAT company recipe! Super easy and it doesn't take alot of time. Everyone RAVES about this recipe. My husband says it takes like something you would get at the Olive Garden. When making this recipe for company I use all of the full fat ingredients. When making it just for my family, I use turkey sausage and milk instead of the cream. It's not as good, but it's still really yummy. This is one you cannot eat too often unless you want a triple bypass.

Really yummy!  I used a 28 oz. can of Italian herb flavored diced tomatoes for extra flavor (felt like it would be bland without adding some Italian seasoning somewhere...) and went light on the pepper flakes.  Had no problem with the sauce thickening up; just simmered for awhile.  The sauce came out nice and creamy.  Served with grated parmesean cheese on top.  Tasted like a restaurant dish!

Hubby and grandkids said this was like their favorite Italian restaurant. I failed to save recipe to my recipe box and was afraid it was gone forever. Could only remember "Bow Ties with Sausage". This is now in my recipe box and saved to my own personal recipe files and thanks to you, will be on my table again tonight. Absolutely delightful way to prepare Italian Sausage!  Many thanks!!

We thought this was good.  I used Diced tomatoes (Italian style).  I think it will be better tomorrow since it will have more time for the flavors to bland in.

One word for this recipe: YUM!!  Not a complaint from anyone in my family and THAT is a rare thing indeed!  Even my pickiest pasta eater who only likes angel hair pasta noodles and even then only with butter and parmesan cheese ate it without complaint!  I used a 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes (drained), and a 14-1/2 ounce can of tomato sauce since I had a lot on hand.  I also substituted half of the heavy cream for fat free half and half.  I added about a half teaspoon of oregano, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and a 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil.  The ONLY problem with this recipe is that I can't stop eating it!!  This is a keeper!

Delicious!  I used some heavy cream and regular cream.  My entire family (two boys, ages 9 and 11) enjoyed it!  This would also work with plain old ground beef.  Thanks for a delightful recipe.

This was delicious.  I made some changes based on suggestions by other reviewers.  I used penne pasta and the diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings. I added a small can of mushrooms, and I used the entire pint of cream.  While most of these alterations worked just fine, next time  I will stick to the 1.5 cups on the cream.  I had to double the simmer time in order to get the right consistency.  If I had followed the recipe on the cream, this would have been a quick and easy home run. Both I and my husband loved it and it's so easy.  This recipe is a keeper!

Everyone loved this recipe including the kids. I would say though, if your kids don't like hot foods, then you may want to cut back on the red pepper.  I also added frozen peas which were a big hit!

I have made this recipe soooo many times. My family and I Looooove it. It is requested weekly by my kids! Two changes- I use crushed tomatoes bc my boys don’t like tomato chunks. I also add two cut up red peppers and throw that in with the onions and garlic. This recipe is AMAZING! We call it “orange pasta”

This is wonderful and freezes well.  I added 1/2 lb ground beef (browned in garlic), extra garlic, but omitted the parsley.  I took the advice of other reviewers and baked the sausage x 50 minutes turning once before slicing.

My family and everyone I know loves this!  I wanted to make it one day and did not have cream, but I did have fat free sour cream.  It worked great!  My husband said there was no difference in taste what so ever!  And I am glad that I can cut out some calories and fat!!

Quite good.  I'm not a big sausage fan and would have given this a 4 so that's saying something.  My husband, call him "Abe Frulman", loved this so we'll go with his rating of a 5.  I only used 3/4 box of pasta because I like saucy pasta, and I used a can of diced tomatoes rather than whole.  It was a fairly quick, easy, and yummy meal.  Thanks!

I have made this like a bunch of times, but i do it a little different. I cook sausages (remove the casings) crumble till no longer pink, then I add a whole can of HUNTS TOMATO SAUCE, then I add a whole container of heavy cream with a little corn starch mixed in to thicken it just a bit, serve with any kind of pasta you like, I usually cook mini penne. Made it like that last night again and hubby said it was A+++. Thanks again Linda :o)~

I made this dish for a friend who had a baby (I never made it before - I'm a risk taker like that!:)
They said it was the best meal ever!  My friend said her husband had 2 heaping plate fulls and her kids (4 & 2) gobbled it up!
I took someone elses advice and cooked the sausage at 350 degrees for 50 minutes - turning half way through cooking.  When it was cool enough to handle I than cut the sausage into coin size pieces (makes it look prettier than crumbled).  I also used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, 1 1/2 cups half and half, 1 TBSP parsley, and 1 TBSP basil. Instead of bow tie noodles I used a tube pasta for added heighth!
Will make again!:)

Very tasty!  Definately have to be a sausage lover, though.  Per reviews I (1) reduced red pepper flakes to 1/4tsp (didn't really need to - was not hot at all); (2) substituted basil for parsley; (3) added splash of sherry to sauce near the end: and, (4) added 1/2C freshly grated parm/reg to sauce at end to thicken.  All very good suggestions.  I never try a recipe w/out reading as many of its reviews as possible.  They're incredibily helpful!

Made this last night and everyone raved about it.  I had no bow tie pasta, so I ended up using medium sized shells.  I added a fresh hot pepper to the sauce instead of pepper flakes.  Excellent.

This recipe was great! I made it for a group of about 30 people and got nonstop compliments about how fabulous the pasta was. Out of about 6 dishes, this is the one people came up to me and noted. Even people who don't like sausage or tomatoes said it was exceptional and that they'd like to see it again.

This has become one of my staple meals and is often requested by my boyfriend (and myself!). It never gets boring and when there are leftovers, they're always quick to get claimed!

I made this for my parents and they loved it--I had some leftover, which I froze and then defrosted in the fridge, heated up two nights later for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it as well--he wants to know when we're having it again! Very simple to make too!

I absolutely LOVED this and so did my picky husband who never raves about anything.  I took the suggestions of another reviewer and used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream to cut down on the high fat content.  The taste was still fantastic.  Next day leftovers were even better.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I was really excited to try out this recipe as it got a lot of great reviews.  So, I ran to the store, bought the ingredients and made it.  The best part of this recipe is the preparation, as it took no time at all.  However, I was VERY disappointed with it.  The sauce is way too runny and fatty and there is not much flavor at all.  Defineatly not worth all the calories.  My husband and I ended up eating sandwiches for dinner because this was awful.  Too bad because it sounds so good.

Awesome. This recipe looked a little iffy to me, but I made it tonight and it was wonderful! The only thing I changed is that I added more red pepper than the recipe called for, because I like more zip to a recipe. Other than that, it was wonderful. I'll definitely make it again.

This was scrumptious and is destined to become a family favorite in my house. I would call it "restuarant quality". It is SO easy too. Instead of chopping whole tomatoes, I would either buy the type that are already diced, or do what I do: with very clean hands break up the tomatoes with your fingers right in the skillet. Stand away from the skillet because sometimes the tomatoes will squirt. 

My 13 year old daughter really liked it, but asked me to use less of the red pepper flakes in the future.

This was very good!!  I also used turkey sausage, (the hot kind, not sweet), and sun dried tomatoes, as a previous poster mentioned.
Will definitely make it again, but may double the garlic and onions, as the turkey sausage does not pack as much flavor as the Italian sausage.

Very good; hubby loved- will be added to the rotation. Did make some changes though b/c as written is SO high fat and cals! Used a tomato basil chicken sausage and didn't need to cook in extra oil. Drained grease after cooked sausage; also added half a green pepper as per another reviewer; used half skim and half light cream for the sauce with just some cornstarch to thicken up; and served topped with parm cheese! Really don't miss all the extra fat! thanks for sharing!

This is SOOO good!  I used 1-1/2 lbs. of sausage because that is what I had.  It was a little too much - 1-1/4 lbs. would have been better.  I cut the pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp.  I did not drain the tomatoes and I used half heavy cream and half 1/2 and 1/2 to save a few calories.  I did not add any salt as there is plenty in the sausage and tomatoes.

To reduce fat, I used half and half instead of cream.  The sauce ended up slightly thin, so I added just a little cornstarch and water.  The result was FABULOUS!  Thank you!

My  family loved this, very tasty!  I added some red bell pepper I needed to use up .  You could really add most anything your family likes. The tomato cream sauce could also be used in many other pasta dishes.

Absolutely delicious. Creamy and a bit spicy. It gets even better after it sits for a day in the fridge. I normally switch out the bowties for penne.

Made this tonight and even my super picky kids who hate tomatoe chunks ate it up! I did add some shredded parmesan right before I served it. However, I tasted it prior to adding the parmesan and it was still delicious. So either way this recipie is great!

Family loved it and I have 5 kids.  Only changes I made was that I added broccoli and Italian seasoning and I put in fresh cut up cherry tomatoes.  The family wolfed it down and I will definitely make it again.

For sure one of top five recipes we make for when people come over. Guaranteed people will like it, and it's not hard to make. Note: I take more time than the recipe to condense the liquid before mixing it with the pasta.

This dish was lacking in FLAVOR AND TASTE other than the sausage. I followed the recipe even though I wanted to add more to it. But the reviews made me want to try it as is. I think my family and I just like more taste in our meals. There needs to be more herbs and spices added to it to make it even worth trying again. Next time, if there is a next, I will modify it to make it edible and flavorful. Sorry this was a bust!

I thought this was pretty good.  I used a large can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes and used cheese tortellini instead of bowties.  I did drain the fat before adding the tomatoes and cream, which I am glad I did because it would have been too greasy.  Overall, a decent recipe.  Next time, I may add some other veggies like peppers or mushrooms.

This is one of my family's favorite pasta dishes. It is so quick & easy to prepare yet so rich in flavors & textures.  The last time I made it I used "fire roasted" diced tomatoes and I think it was my best batch yet.

I'm so happy I've found this recipe here! I've made it several times, and it is one of those go to recipes that is easy, tasty and filling.
I make it exactly like recipe calls for, but I add Italian seasoning to the Italian style Chicken sausage. You really can't go wrong with altering the recipe with seasoning or veggies according to your taste.
Also, I add whatever veggies I have on hand such as mushrooms and peas.
I love this recipe!

Delicious!  Even my boyfriend, who's very picky about food being flavorful enough, was highly impressed and satisfied by this dish.  He's thought it had the perfect amount of spiciness.

My family absolutely LOVES this dish.  We have had it at least twice a month since I found it!  Easy to make also! Please make sure you put the pasta INTO the prepared sauce and let simmer.  I promise, if done this way, it WILL thicken and the pasta soaks up the sauce perfectly! This is not a POUR over, recipe!

AWESOME!!! Everyone loved it and leftovers were even better the following night. I actually turned it vegetarian and sautéed some chopped zucchini, mushrooms  and green pepper with the onion and garlic then added a drained and rinsed can of black beans, sprinkled tbsp of mixed herbs. Used a vegan style cream sauce and then stirred in the bow ties as directed and it was perfect. Definitely making again and again! Thanks for sharing Linda!

Nothing spectacular about this. It was fine. Its just pasta with tomatoes and cream. I thought it was actually bland. With tweaking it could be more interesting.

This is an awesome dish! I will DEFINITELY make this one again!

I changed it a bit as follows:
1 lb ground Italian Sausage (not in casing) - made it easier
Drained sausage after cooking (as others suggested)
1 28oz of Bella Terra Organic Italian Whole Peeled Tomatoes (including juice)
1 japlaneo chopped with seeds removed
Oregano and basil to taste
Increased pepper flakes to 1Tsp (we like it spicy)
Increased the garlic to 6 cloves minced
Parsley flakes (not fresh and it was fine)
2 cup broccoli (trimmed stems) - put in about 2mins before serving so broccoli would be crunchy
Sprinkled with a little parmesan cheese

This recipe is easy and great tasting. The only thing I did different is I fryed up some spinich with garlic power, onions, and butter. Then with the sauce I noticed when made by the recipe it comes out more like a butter sauce and runs to the bottom of the noddles. Thats why I made the sauce separate in a frying pan a little different. I added 2 cups butter, more if needed. Then I added 1 1/2 cup of flour, till the bytter is some what paste. Then added 2 cups heavy cream and mixed all together. Put on low heat for a minute while stiring till its a creamy sauce. Salt to taste and added the cooked spinich and sauce to noddles. Much creamier that way.

if I could add another star I would!  Of course I made some mods...I used sliced gourmet chicken sausage (the garlic and gruyere kind), quartered grape tomatoes, fresh spinich, and evaporated milk since I was low on half and half.  Plus I added a bit of shredded parmesan cheese on top before serving.  My picky boys gobbled it up!!!

Loved it! Healthy add on's: added spinach and used Greek yogurt instead of cream. Definitely make sure you mix the pasta while cooking the sauce mix. Helps keep things coated and thickens nicely.

My family LOVES this dinner including my fussy 3 year old. I also added several handfuls of fresh spinach to it so everyone gets a veggie and have used whatever kind of sausage our local food store has (we live in the islands). Great recipe!!

Surprisingly bland. I made almost exactly as written. I don't buy flavored tomatoes, so I used plain diced tomatoes and added a teaspoon of Italian mix seasonings.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good either. I just had it leftover and the flavors did not seem to improve any. Parmesan cheese did help a bit.  It was like all the onion, garlic, pepper flakes, and seasonings just gave up. Won't be making this again because I can't figure out what was wrong.

Followed the recipe exactly.  We really enjoyed this dish.  I'm not a pasta fan.  I only like pasta dishes that have cream like sauces,  of course the fattening ones ?.   So this hit the spot. The kids enjoyed it too.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious! If you add 6 cups of chicken broth, potatoes and kale, it becomes the Toscana soup at Olive Garden.

This is very good! I only used a 16 ounce can of tomatoes. At the end I mixed the parsley right in, drained the pasta and stirred it into the meat mixture. I let it sit and soak in about 5 minutes before we ate. It was so good. My husband's new favorite!

Good basic recipe, but adding some fresh basil and/or oregano and a pinch of sugar, draining the grease after the sausage cooks, and cutting back on the amount of heavy cream by substituting some of the water from the pasta (the starch in the drained pasta water adds to the thickening of it) in it can cut calories and increase flavor.  You can also get lean ground pork and brown it in olive oil, adding an Italian herb mix with fennel to the pork. In my Italian (father born and raised there) family, only a couple tablespoons of cream were added, right near the end of cooking, to the sauce, and meat was kept to a minimum...it was about the sauce, the pasta, and the vegetables served along with the main dish.

This is amazing! So good and so easy, it has earned a permanent berth in our kitchen. I used bulk hot Italian sausage for pizza and skipped the pepper flakes. That was the only change I made. Add some garlic bread and a small green salad and walk away from it, basking in the applause from your family!

This was absolutely delicious! Had just a perfect hint of spice and fantastic overall flavor. One thing that I did add to it was about 1 cup of grated Parmesan while the sauce was cooking. I think that really added something special to it. Definitely a keeper!

I'm a novice in the kitchen and this was pretty easy even for me. I also added spinach as one of the reviewers recommended. I loved the finished product! Hubby said I did it all correctly (he's the regular cook in our house??) but this isn't his favorite combo of flavors. Bummer.

This is So good.  I did convert to 8 servings so I could use the entire package of pasta and sausages and then just had leftovers. I did leave out the crushed red peppers since I had Hot Italian Sausage on hand. Don't forget to drain the cans of tomato....I forgot and I had to simmer for a while to thicken....lol-don't know what got into me???

OK with these ingredients - how can you really go wrong?  This was easy and delicious! Probably not a dish you want to make every week since it's not exactly "light" but for a special dinner - this is a great choice.  Makes LOTS so there's plenty for a crowd.

OKAY!!! 1st off let me start by saying this is AMAZING! Second, I took a few suggestions off the other reviews. I ended up using a package of Hillshire Farms (fully cooked)smoked sausage. I still cooked the sausage w/ oil in the pan and added in some chopped onion. However I cooked down the onions for a few minutes then added in 1/2 of a chopped green pepper and then also some sliced mushrooms. Sauteed that on low for a about 5 minutes er so while the noodles cooked. Which by the way I just used penne, which was whatever opened box I found. So then add in the salt... I just sprinkled it over the top of the sausage mix (not too much though). Next I added in one can of 14.5oz traditional diced tomatoes, and 1 can 14.5 oz Contadina Stewed Tomatoes (the one with onions, celery, & green peppers}. I know it seems like too much green peppers BUT ITS REALLY NOT!! Stir it all up and then LAST I added one 1/2 pint Wegmans Ultra-Pasteurized Heavy Cream. THAT'S IT!! Stir it all up. I ended up just serving the sauce mixture over the noodles with steamed broccoli on the side. Did I mention this was AMAZING!!!!!!! I'm going to make this again next week!!

My family & I love this dish!!!  I make it often according to the recipe & have never had a problem with it being too runny.  You must try this dish if you haven't already.  It's simply delicious!!!

This turned out better than I expected. I upped the serving size to 8 servings. I followed the recipe for the most part. Instead if using dried onion I added 1/2 of a chopped white onion and 1/2 of a green bell pepper. I did not drain the sausage as I felt the flavor would be lose with the loss of the olive oil used. Overall this is a simple and easy meal to make. Garlic or 3 cheese bread on the side is a great compliment to this also.

Made this dish last night for dinner and was not disappointed in the least!  The Italian sausage and red peppers gave this dish so much flavor. It was truly a quick and delicious meal that will be added to my recipe box. Thanks for posting the recipe!

My favorite recipe on this site.  Easy to make, perfect for weeknights.  I didn't modify the recipe the first few times I made it. No need to! its excellent as is.  I did throw spinach in it the last time I made it to try and get the kids to eat a vegetable. Great either way.

I made this recipe as submitted except - I like tomato sauces simmered longer to blend flavors. I cooked and set aside the pasta. Then I made the tomato sauce without the cream and simmered, covered, for 40 min. Then I took it off the heat, let it cool a few minutes, and added the cream. Then I added the pasta, and put the entire dish on a low heat while I made a salad. This worked well. And...we loved the flavors of this dish! I'll definitely make it again.

I made this last night and the only thing I did differently was just cut the sausage into chunk pieces instead of crumbling it.  This was a definite hit in our house.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Unfortunately, I took the advice of other reviewers and subbed half & half for the heavy cream to cut down on the fat. I wish I would have made it as directed. The initial taste was good but there wasn't much substance and the aftertaste was very bland. I'd recommend making the dish as is and you can always make changes next time. It did however taste a little better after sitting in the fridge when we ate it for leftovers the next day.

Great recipe, definitely a keeper.  Only change I made was using a cup of half and half and a little corn starch to thicken the sauce.  Wonderful!!!

This was fantastic although I did tweak things a bit. I bought chicken pesto feta sausage (just sounded too darn good) and I put about 2 tblsp. of feta into the sauce while simmering to gel the flavors. Also used cherry tomatoes instead of canned and it was unbelievably yummy. Thanks for sharing!

Amazing recipe. Simple quick and a great unique flavor. I used Johnsonville ground sweet italian sausage and it was wonderful. Leftovers (if any lol) seem to be like lasagna where they are even better the next day.

I have made this recipe three or four times since I first stumbled across it a couple of months ago.  I use spicy Italian sausage, and two 19-oz cans of Italian-style tomatoes.  Other than that, I don't change a thing!  I try to avoid having sausage in our home for health reasons, but I just can't say no to my boyfriend when he asks for this dish!

Made this as specified multiple times. It's excellent! Very quick to make and kids love it. Make it with a side of garlic bread, and it's great for a quick weeknight meal.
Edit: per Linda, who submitted this fantastic recipe; I have always added the pasta to the pan with the sauce. I didn't consider your instructions difficult, and that's how I initially read them.  The sauce and pasta mixture turns out perfect in consistency.  This is even better after sitting for a couple of days in the fridge, and heated up as left-overs. Excellent! Thank you!

This was a big hit with my family!  I used 2 14.5oz cans of diced Italian-style tomatoes in place of the stewed tomatoes.  I also omitted the red pepper because I didn't think the kids would eat it if it had too much of a kick.  Everyone loved it.

Very tasty and easy to make.
Update: so I have now made this recipe a few times because I love it so much. My sauce used to come out a bit thin too but I didn't mind it because I would just dip my bread in it. I used to just get the tomatoes already diced and drain it a little and dump those in. Since they are already diced they hold a lot of juice. So I drained the can, dumped half and dumped the rest. This really helped to keep it from getting too thin. I hope this helps!

Delicious! I did sub 3 Roma tomatoes sprinkled with Italian seasoning (I couldn't find the can version the recipe calls for) but other than that followed the recipe. Really easy and the whole family loved it :)

I had to doctor up the sauce considerably, but overall it was a hit with my DH and DD for dinner tonight.  I used chicken sausage, as I didn't have sweet Italian sausage (will definitely use next time).  I only had a 16 oz box of mini bowties, so I compensated by using nearly 2 cups of liquid (half and half) and it still wasn't as creamy as I'd hoped. I did add a good dose of shredded parmesan on top of each serving...yum!  It made for a ton of leftovers, so I'll whip up a little more sauce when reheating and it should taste just as good.  I'd like try changing this up a bit next time; maybe adding broccoli or spinach or even using sun-dried tomatoes.

Delicious! I followed other recommendations and made little changes of my own. I used ground Italian sausage and 1 can of diced tomatoes and one small container (1 pint) of half and half instead of the heavy cream. I am glad I used the whole container because it isn't too much of a sauce but more like a delicious saucy coating. I also added half a bag of frozen peas just for kicks and it really completed the dish perfectly. I think it needs some other color and texture and the peas were a great addition! Since it's just my husband and I we had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day and it was pretty good the next day too! I will definitely be making this again!

I used canned Italian diced tomatoes so I wouldn't have to chop and instead of links I used the regular mild Italian sausage so I wouldn't have to mess with casings. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly adding a little grated parmigiano reggiano at the table. We have had this a few times and each time my SO has stated that it is his favorite dish of all time! It's quick and easy too. A definite go-to recipe for weeknight suppers.

My husband made this recipe on his "night to cook" and we've made it twice since.  It's delicious, EASY and great for company.  You can adjust the spices according to the audience, everyone loves it.  Will be making it tonight for a friend's birthday dinner with a lovely salad and bread.  Can't go wrong here!

This recipe is as wonderful and as easy as they say.  I added fresh basil and italian seasoning, as some of the other reviewers mentioned, and left out the hot pepper flakes fof my daughter's sake.  However, I did not cut back on the amount of canned tomatoes.  I think that the dish needs the extra liquid.

So very, very good! I wouldn't change a thing! I'll tell you though, it will feed a heck of a lot more than 6 people! Likely more along the lines of 8 or 10 with sides on the table too!

High Fat and very oily. Where's the healthy diet?
The taste is ok but it's too oily I can't handle it.

I accidentally used crushed tomatoes rather than a chunkier tomato. I must not have clearly read the recipe. I will use chunkier next time for texture reasons but the taste w the crushed was the same. I enjoyed this! I like the idea of adding spinach and will try that next time. Tortellini would be yummy too! I don't think it  visually looked all that wonderful but the taste was quite good! I will try this again with some variations just for fun!

I've tried this a couple of times and both have been very good. The only substitution that I've made is to use mild or hot sausage vs the sweet sausage, I couldn't find the links so I just used ground, which would be easier than trying to take the casings off of the links anyway.

All I did different was replace the parsley with 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning and add a little chopped spinach. My husband and I loved it. I will definitely make this again.

My 2 sons and husband rated this recipe very highly.  I'm not so sure it was good enough to be worth the fat and calories, but it was decent.  I made it as written except backed off a bit on the red pepper flakes.  I'm not sure if the recipe meant to use Italian-style plum tomatoes or Italian-seasoned tomatoes, but I used the ones with basil, oregano, and garlic.  If you are using the un-seasoned ones it will definitely need some seasoning added or will have no taste.

This is my favorite pasta recipe of all time. Everyone I make this for LOVES it!!!  I usually make this with turkey sausage to reduce the fat and calories.  If you make it with full-fat pork sausage, you can eliminate the olive oil if you like.

A coworker of mine had this for lunch one day and I asked her about it. She gave me the recipe and I decided to try it.
At first I thought it might be a bit too spicy but the more I ate it, the more I liked it. I made it a second time and kept the 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.
My hubby loves this and it is very easy to make.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make. I actually made the sauce a couple days in advance and just reheated in a saucepan before adding to my cooked pasta. My family loved it. I can't wait to make this again... maybe next week

I saved this recipe a long time ago and just haven't gotten around to trying it. I couldn't find some italian sausage that didn't have lots of nasty stuff added to it, so I just bought some of my favorite regular sausage and added my own italian seasonings. I followed the recipe to the T otherwise. My family enjoyed it thoroughly and my husband actually was worried there would be enough left overs lol. I'm not entirely sure why anyone would have issues with flavor. The italian seasonings add plenty as well as the tomatoes.

Also, why would anyone need to be instructed to drain sausage grease? That's pretty much common sense. Unless the recipe calls for using the grease. It's a "duh" moment.

I used mild Italian sausage instead of sweet ---and had on hand a can of garlic and onion diced tomatoes. What a wonderful meal we had! This was easy to make. I didn't pay attention to the "serves 6"... and it certainly does! I look forward to the leftovers!

To tailor this to the taste of my family I added 1 cup of mushrooms and 2 tablespoons of basil, used red onions, doubled the red pepper flakes, left out the olive oil and used only 1 cup of cream. My husband and I loved it!

Definitely easy to make.  Found it a little bland.  Next time would add a little spicier sausage, use less tomatoes, add a few small things like capers for some increased flavor.  Overall, not bad though, thanks for the submission!!

So tasty and I'm not even a fan of sausage. It's important to follow the directions, sweet Italian sausage is a must. Also, like many other dishes this is even better the next day.

Ok I am one of those people who changes the recipes as I see fit. Not because I want to but because I don't allways have all the ingredients. So I want to offer some substitutions for those others like me who might not have it all. I subbed the sausage for chorizo, didn't have the canned Italian tomatoes so cut up some tomatoes and sprinkled Italian seasoning on it, didn't have cream so I made my own with milk and a little cornstarch. Didn't have bowties so I subbed egg noodles. It was great!

This recipe is SOOO GOOD! Here is a few tricks though. 

1. Make sure the pasta is al dente. DONT OVER COOK!
2. Dont add the Olive Oil for the meat.. it doesnt need it.
3. ***Most Important*** Drain the grease after the meat is cook and use a paper towel to dry the meat of all grease. 
4. After you add the cream turn the heat up and keep stiring. The longer you stir the thicker(Better) your sauce will turn out!

I really did love this recipe!

What a delicious dinner!  I didn't have any plum tomatoes, so I added two 14oz cans of diced tomatoes instead.  I didn't add any oil to the pan because it wasn't needed, and I didn't add any salt.  

I did add some fresh ground pepper and some garlic powder - oh, and I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup whole milk because I didn't have enough cream.  

I added a little flour before letting it sit to simmer because there was a LOT of liquid and I didn't think it would thicken that much.  I think next time I make this I will add flour after the sausage, onions & garlic are done and before the tomatoes & cream are added.  Also, I might try adding kale to this - I think that would be good!

Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.

This is great.  I add extra onion, garlic and cream then thicken with a little corn starch.  I've made it several times and it never disappoints.  But I see so many photos of the sauce poured over the plated pasta :S .  That is so wrong.  The pasta MUST be stirred into the sauce and heated through in order to absorb the sauce and flavour.  Some people can't read or just don't get it.

Used only one cup of light cream.  Used some of the tomato liquid to add more flavor.  And got the tomatoes that are already flavored (basil, oregano, etc).   Really easy and good!

It was delicious and very satisfying.  I usually give 4 stars for my “favorite” recipes but this one got my 5 stars because it was also so simple and easy to make.  I used non-stick pan so didn’t use olive oil at all.  Because the sausage was browned with red pepper, it was pretty spicy.  I will reduce the pepper when I make this one for my family.  I understand if you have kids, you need to sneak many veggies in their favorite dish but the beauty of this dish was this amazingly simple combination of sausage, tomato and cream.  I won’t change the flavor by adding bell peppers. Adding a simple veggie side dish like steamed asparagus might compliment this hearty dish better.  Thanks for sharing!

I tried two new recipes from this website this week and both were declared "keepers" by my very persnickety husband.  I followed this recipe exactly except I didn't have the canned tomatoes.  I used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead and this probably came out a little hotter than the original recipe but we like it hot!  Thanks so much!

I made half of this recipe using diced tomatoes seasoned with basil, oregano and garlic for a little more flavor.  And even though I used hot Italian sausage, along with the red pepper flakes, I thought it still could use a little more heat.  From a presentation standpoint, next time I might cook the sausage whole and cut it into coins rather than browning and crumbling it.  We enjoyed this and would make it again.

I never usually right a review but have seen some previous reviews about the sauce being an issue with this recipe so I felt the need to defend our beloved "Bowtie pasta" dish as we call it in our family. This is a foolproof recipe and very hard to mess up! Just follow the directions and play around with seasonings as I do and you have a wonderful dinner dish. We have this at least 2-3 times a month and always add some extra seasonings and freshly grated parmesan while the last portion simmers as you add the pasta and VOILA-a hearty meal! Thank you so much for submitting this recipe as it has become a family favorite and tradition that will be passed down!

I think this is why my husband proposed to me! I started making this exact recipe 10 years ago. The only thing I change is I use italian diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I also add a bit more red pepper. My husband would have me make this once a week if I would- he will eat it breakfast lunch and dinner. (I do drain the grease as other reviewers suggested). Love this recipe - good anytime of year.

Oh my GOODNESS. This comes out flawless every time I make it. No amount of words will be able to tell you how good this is. I'm such a sucker for creamy tomato sauces anyway, so this one really hits home. 

The last time I made this I had 2 pints of cherry tomatoes that were about to go bad, so I roasted them along with some garlic & mashed them up once they were soft and juicy and I used that mixture instead of adding the cans of tomato sauce, like the recipe calls, & wow! It was so delicious. We almost always try a different kind of sausage with this recipe too & it always turns out great.

Very good!  I would give it five stars except that I too make some modifications.  I add spinach and Italian seasoning, lessen the amount of tomatoes used to 1 14.5 oz can and used Italian turkey sausage.  It is very good!  Thanks for the submission!

I LOVED this.  It was very yummy.  I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with sweet onion (didn't drain) and tomato sauce with roasted garlic in leau of the garlic, onion, and tomatoes that she used.  It was so easy and so good.  I also reserved about 1/4 cup of the liquid from the cooked pasta and stirred it in when mixing the pasta and sauce.  Added a tad bit of parmesan reggiano...  Outcome was success!  Husband, 18 month old, and 5 year old all ate it.

Yum! I used egg noodles instead of bowties (what I had on hand) and thought it was a bad move because they kind of broke apart in the sauce, but my husband said he likes it that way so I guess it was fine. :) Cut the red pepper flakes back (we don't like hot stuff so much) and added some oregano and rosemary and quite a bit more salt than called for, and I used fresh tomatoes from our garden instead of canned. I also used sweet turkey sausage so I didn't need to worry about the grease. Delish.
Edit: Made this again tonight, used the called-for bowtie pasta which was definitely better than egg noodles, as well as the called-for amount of pepper flakes, and it was just spicy enough (though I did use 2 cups of cream because we like lots of sauce, which would have toned down the spiciness a hair). Before I added the cream and other sauce ingredients to the meat, I sprinkled some white flour onto the meat and let it cook a couple minutes, which helped the cream thicken up very quickly once it was added. And I used canned tomatoes today instead of fresh like last time, and the fresh definitely taste better, so if you have them, do that! Still good with the canned though. I just want to eat it all, it's so good!

I have made this recipe now several times now and my family just loves it.  Do yourself a favor and just use ground sausage.  I have also used diced or crushed tomatoes rather than whole.  The creamy sauce is so good - the garlic, tomatoes, and onions are perfect!  Try this one and you will want to make it for your family regularly!

Loved this! Added a little parm cheese to the top and it was delish. I only used about 1/2 of the tomatoes becuase I am not a huge fan of tomatoes and it was great! Thank you for a yummy recipe!

OMG! This was very delicious! The only change I made was that I added a red bell pepper and some mushrooms. Hubby and my son LOVED IT! Hubby kept saying this is so good and went back for thirds. This will be added to my cookbook! Thanks Linda for sharing :)

This was a great change of pace from standard spaghetti night.  I added parm cheese to the sauce as I mixed in the pasta, but you could always just sprinkle it on after in case not everyone likes it. It gave it more of a "vodka sauce" flavor.

A really versatile recipe. I used Turkey Italian sausage, half and half for a healthier version. I also added spinach and sun dried tomatoes very extra vegetables.  Next time I will add mushrooms and yellow or orange bell pepper. I will put this on my monthly rotation. Thank you for a really quick easy and tasty recipe.

Easy!  I made it even easier by using dried onion and garlic powder.  Since I did this, I added a bit more salt, some Italian Seasoning and pepper.  Once I added the cream, I also added about 1 TBSP flour.  My boys devoured it!

This is amazing. Will definitely be making this again. I used italian diced tomatoes, sauce and all. I also used homemade spaghetti noodles which when stirred into the sauce soaked it up nicely.

My husband and son love this dish and we now have it fairly regularly.  Sometimes I have the cream, sometimes I just use milk, it's good either way.

This is an excellent recipe.  I forgot to drain the tomatoes, but it still turned out great.  It makes a big amount.  I cut the recipe in half as there is just the two of us and we got 2 meals out of it, plus I had the rest for lunch another day.  I am passing the recipe on to my friend.

Good recipe. Worth adding to your recipe collection.
However, I used 2% milk as I did not have cream -still had a very good flavor. The next time I shall add peppers and mushrooms.

Holy COW was this good!  I got home from work tonight and my husband said he'd have dinner ready.  He plugged in pasta and sausage into the search engine and this came up, so he shopped for the ingredients and made it for me.  He is not an experienced cook, but this recipe was easy for him.  This dish was AMAZING!!  I told him I felt like we'd gone to a very nice Italian restaurant and was served this meal.  Thank you, Linda, for my new dinner idea next weekend when his parents come to visit.  You rock!

This was absolutely delicious! I was really suprised by how much flavor there was with such few ingredients. I know it said to drain the tomatoes but I used a little bit of the sauce from the can to help thicken the cream. Will definitely be making this again!

I was expecting a lot more out of this recipe. There was not enough sauce for all the noodles it called for, and the sauce was runny. There was not much flavor. I think it's a good start to something better with some doctoring.

I was in a slump and needed something different and something that would satisfy my 2 picky young boys, 2 and 5.  This was perfect!  They even ate without a fight!  I'm not a sausage fan at all, but I used Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage and it was delicious.  I used canned Italian diced tomatoes and added fresh chopped spinach to sneak some veggies in.  Per other reviews, I didn't add the olive oil, and it turned out perfect - not greasy at all.  Added about 6 cloves of garlic and more onion since we enjoy those flavors but cut back on the red pepper for the kids.  I'm enjoying the leftovers right now, and they're delicious as well!  Thank you for this wonderful, easy recipe that will def go into the rotation!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought this was very good.  The boyfriend even went back for seconds, which he never does!  Next time I will try it with substitutions (half and half, etc) to make it a little healthier.
update:
I tried this again with fat free half and half and it was still fantastic!!

We loved this dish! My husband asked me to make it again the next night! And this is coming from somebody who doesn't like tomatoes!! There was a lot leftover, but thats ok by us cause he will take it to work with him the next day, and then come home home and eat more...definatly just as good reheated, just a little more greasy, as most pastas with any kind of fat/butter/oil are. But still great! I would almost add a tad more cream to get more sauce.

I put my own spin on this recipe by using sliced smoked sausage instead of crumbled sweet Italian. I also used penne pasta because that's what I had on hand. I made the sauce according to the recipe and it definitely had a kick to it! My husband absolutely loved this--it was different than our normal rotation of meals. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe gets 3 stars as is because, as other reviewers mention, the sauce is a little bland.  However, with the addition of spices to taste like, a dry Italian herb mix, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper this dish is an easy 5 stars. Could also be great baked in a casserole dish with a crunchy panko/parmesan cheese topping.

Simple, quick, delicious, and pretty on a serving platter.  What more could I ask for?  Adults and children enjoyed this.  Made as written except for two small changes...added a splash of white wine to the veggies & sausage because I had some to use up and used f/f half & half instead of heavy cream.  Perfect!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe, even though there were minor issues. My problem was the sauce was very watery, but I am fairly certain this was because I used tomatoes I chopped and froze during the summer instead of canned tomatoes, which resulted in way too much liquid in the recipe. No worries, we used crusty garlic italian bread to soak up all of the leftover sauce and it tasted great. I am sure if I put the leftovers in the fridge overnight, the sauce will soak into the noodles and it will be perfect tomorrow. I also added one small chopped green pepper to the recipe with the onions and garlic which added to the flavor of the recipe. I will definitely be making this again, though I might try defrosting my tomatoes completely and then draining off most of the liquid, I think that will help the watery sauce problem.

This is a quick, tasty dish to throw together.  I made a few changes.  I use crushed tomatoes insteas of plum, personal preference.  I also throw in a few fresh basil leaves for extra flavor.  Very yummy!  This recipe is a standard in my monthly rotation.

This was a good comfort food.  I used light cream to try to make it a little healthier.  We all liked it a lot.

The same recipe I use, but I add shredded basil leaves if I have them.  And I add salt and pepper  at the table.  Make sure the onion and garlic are very tender.
Also, I only use the Hunts "fire roasted' tomatoes lately.  They taste much better than the standard dices tomatoes. I used two of the 15 oz cans.

What a wonderful, simple dish! So satisfying and hearty! I substituted half and half for the heavy cream as suggested by others. To those having sauce issues, note that with the substitution of half/half, cornstarch and water thickening will be necessary. Remember, a little goes a long way! Thanks for a new family staple!

Pretty good, although a tad spicy, and I'm not sure why, as I cut down the red pepper flakes.  Maybe it was the cooking creme I used (instead of the cream)?  At any rate, it was still pretty good.  It makes a lot of pasta, so cut it down if you aren't a fan of leftovers and are only feeding a few people.  Luckily, we like this since I didn't cut it down--to me, this makes a lot more than 6 servings.  This is also very easy and doesn't take a ton of time, which makes it good for a weeknight meal.  I left out the oil--sausage doesn't tend to need it unless it's turkey sausage--and added some orange bell peppers I had in the fridge.  The sauce doesn't thicken but it coats the pasta well--have faith, it will be just fine!  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved it...I used all the cream to have more sauce and extra Italian seasoning.  I also use Angel Hair because that's just my favorite pasta.  The leftovers are even better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used gluten-free ziti and strained tomatoes (instead of plum tomatoes), since that's all I had.  Hubby and I loved it.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe to add to the rotation.

This was excellent! Everyone liked it, quick and delicious. I am going to try and make the tomato sauce from fresh ingredients next time. Just found out that my wife does not like canned tomatoes even though she liked everything else about it.

I've made this numerous times, and ever time it turns out fantastic.  The only changes I make are that I use bulk spicy Italian sausage and regular diced tomatoes.

Amazing, however, if you want the sauce to be thicker let it reduce down for approx. 20 minutes. Also, don't forget to DRAIN THE GREASE, the recipe doesn't mention doing this.

This has always been one of my all time recipes from this site.  When making it one night recently, I discovered that I didn't have the heavy cream.  I had read so many reviewers that had used half & half, etc. instead of the heavy cream, so I tried using half & half ----DON"T DO IT!!!!  DO NOT SUBSTITUTE THE HEAVY CREAM!  It was NOT my dinner anymore or anything close to it.  If you make this recipe and use anything other than the heavy cream then you have no one to blame but yourself if it turns out bland and not so good.  Stick with the recipe!

This was a great recipe as I made it with what I had onhand and it was still delicious! Ziti, half sweet/half hot sausage, can of crushed tomatoes, fat free half & half, and I added half a bag of frozen spinach. Thank you for this terrific recipe! I see it's been around while and still going strong. :)

I followed the directions for the 6 servings...absolutely delicious! I did add a 10 oz pkg of frozen chopped spinach *thawed* like someone else suggested..As well as using 1 can of Italian Style Diced Tomatoes (mostly drained) and 1 can of Plum Tomatoes that I chopped up.I also used spicy sausage, because we like HEAT! It was very tasty! My husband and his friend enjoyed it very much!
I will definitely be making this again and sharing the recipe!

One of the best recipes I have found in years. My whole family is crazy about it. My daughter and I have tweaked this recipe many different ways. Instead of canned Tomatoes we use fresh plum tomatoes, diced. We have added green peppers and/or mushrooms, extra garlic. Just use your imagnation. Great find as well as a keeper.

This was quite good. My younger daughter is quite picky and she gave it 2 thumbs up! I only changed 3 things: I used Italian style crushed tomatoes (because one of my kids "thinks" she doesn't like tomatoes) and followed another reviewers suggestion of adding chopped spinach and using fat-free half and half. Yummy!

Delicious! And such an easy recipe to follow. I did make a couple of changes--I used fat free half & half instead of the heavy cream, used diced Italian style tomatoes and did not drain them, and added 1 diced green pepper. I will be making this again, probably adding some spinach to up the amount of veggies :)

Added more spinach than another reviewer suggested and it's still great.  Draining the grease would be best, so don't forget that.  Over all, filling and very good!

This was great. I made it healthier by using the new Philadelphia cooking cream cheese tub instead of the heavy cream and it works just as well plus it doesn't take as long because you don’t have to wait for the sauce to thicken. I highly recommend, even good with turkey sausage!

Yummy. My easy substitutions:
1) Use the Bob Evans Italian sausage roll
2) Use 1/2 & 1/2
3) Use fire roasted diced tomatoes. 
 ENJOY, my family does.

Ohmygosh...this is soooooo good. I mean delightful. I didn't have bowtie so we did rotini and I added some chopped up baby sweet peppers and extra onion. I nixed the red pepper flakes because my two year old was also eating but we added some white pepper to our individual bowls at the end, along with some romano and parmesean. As a side I made oven roasted asparagus. So good! My husband actually had this at work and wouldn't shut up about it so I made it for him. I am glad he did! It's a favorite now here and at the firehouse!

I used mostaccioli because it's what I had on hand.  I also used fresh romas instead of canned.  The flavor was great and it was very quick and easy to make.

Yummo!  I am giving this 5 stars because it tastes awesome, feeds a family, and is easy and affordable.  The only change I made was to use half and half to cut down on the fat.  I also added fresh mushrooms which really made the recipe, giving it a richness without added fat.  Served with a nice salad and garlic bread, the family loved it.

I *LOVE* this recipe.  It's economical, quick, easy and tasty!!  This is the second time I have made it, both times as the recipe states, and I would not change a thing!!  Leftovers (if there are any), are also great the next day  :)

My husband doesn't like anything spicy so I omitted the red pepper flakes from the recipe.  The sauce was WAY too sweet and neither one of us could stand to eat what was on our plate.  A first for me.  Sorry, this one wasn't for us!

Very delicious. I made approximately half of a recipe:  Changes from the recipe for six: 1/2 lb of sausage (1 hot and 2 sweet links), no olive oil, 14.5 oz can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes, 1 cup heavy cream, no salt, 1 Tbs dried parsley. I drained the browned sausage on paper towels and wiped out the skillet before returning the sausage to the skillet and adding the other ingredients. I thought the sauce was the right consistency vs some of the other reviewers who thought it was too thin. I would definitely make this again.

Excellent, easy pasta recipe with minimal ingredients and maximal taste.  We actually withheld the pepper flakes so we could feed this to our young daughter; my husband just added some to his pasta when we sat down to eat and loved it.  Also used a little more onion and garlic and added fresh ground pepper to the sauce as it cooked.  Topped with parmesan - you can't go wrong.

This recipe was amazing! It was definitely restaurant caliber.  My grocery store did not have sweet Italian sausage or Italian-style plum tomatoes, so I substituted regular pork sausage and Italian-style diced tomatoes. I also added a little extra cream to increase the amount of sauce. Since I am only cooking for two I made half of the recipe, and it made a delicious dinner, and then a good lunch as leftovers the next day. I have already made this twice, and it has quickly become one of my favorites! :)

Delicious!  I used radiator pasta, half and half instead of cream, diced canned tomatoes (not Italian style because the store was out of that), hot Italian sausage, and shallots instead of onions.  I also added a bunch more garlic. 

I didn't cook the sauce with the pasta despite the recommendation from the submitter (so we could have a low carb option).  Instead, I just cooked the sauce down until it wasn't watery.  I topped the dish with sauteed baby broccoli and fresh shredded parmesan.

I thought this was great!! Decadent, to say the least. I had planned on using half and half as opposed to heavy cream, but I discovered that I had some heavy cream in the fridge which was still good, so... waste not, want not. The result was awesome! Very flavorful and very delicious, but I may attempt it next time with half and half to make a slightly healthier meal.

this was awesome. i truly wanted to follow recipe as is, but noticed I was out of cream after I already started- so I improvised and found anything that said "cream" in my fridge (sour cream, cream cheese, creamy ranch) and combined about 3/4 cup of each to the dish, and... wow! It gets 5 stars for each person in my family that asked for seconds!!!

Excellent.  My finance really like this dish.  I followed the recipe with minor subs:  mini bowties; fat-free half-and-half; turkey Italian sausage.  I also added a few peas just because I needed to use them up.  Increased the recipe to use a 16 ounce box of pasta and 20 ounce package of sausage...that's how they came and I didn't want the leftovers.  This will be a regular!

This was delish--thanks for sharing!!! I found it to be the exact amt of spiciness for me and my hubby (actually my 2.5 yr old didn't mind the spice either!). I used light cream since that was what I had on hand and it was still great.

My family loved this - it tasted like something that would have come from a good italian restaurant.  I did use the diced tomatoes and I added some broccoli and mushrooms so that we would have some vegatables in dinner.  Very hearty and serving size was more than enough for 2 dinners!

Absolutely one of the best recipes I've tried from this site or any other for that matter. Followed the recipe exactly with two minor adjustments. I didn't use the olive oil enough fat in the sausage and I didn't use the parsley at the end. My husband doesn't like leaves, as he calls, them on his food. I'm actually going to make it again this week. It's definitely going to be a staple in our home!! The second time I made it I used ground pork as suggested by some of the others, it was not bad but was lacking something. tonight I'm going back to the sweet Italian sausage. I also forgot to say that I've been using Rotelle or Rotini for the pasta instead of the Bow Ties, with the cork screw shape of this type of pasta holds the sauce really well!! Making this again and I'm back to the original recipe with two exceptions I'm still using the Rotini/Rotelle pasta and I find that just about a teaspoon of corn starch really helps thickening this. Other than that stick to the original recipe!!!

I am giving this a 2 because I made it exactly the way the recipe instructs and , to me, it tasted like a mild tomato soup with sausage.  I had to dress it up a "lot" to get it to taste really good.  Once I did, it was delicious.  So, the recipe is a good starting point.

I used a Italian 4 Cheese sausage...added mushrooms and spinach.  In one bite, this became one of my favorite recipes.  And it is very easy to make...which helps after a day of work and being a single mom.  Also...my 2 yr old son LOVED it!  Win all around!

Perfect easy meal for a busy week night.  The whole family loved this and it was super fast and easy.  I did substitue half and half due to what was on hand and subsequently thinkening it a little with corn starch.

The only thing I did different was use cayenne pepper (as one other reviewer suggested), dried parsley (didn't have fresh) and it took just a little cornstarch and water to thicken to the consistency we like.  It was AWESOME!!!!!!!  Also made fresh Italian bread in my bread machine........WHAT A MEAL!!!!!!!!  I'm sure this can be interchanged quite a few different ways - different pasta, shrimp, ground beef.  Can't wait to do it again!!!!!!

My family & I greatly enjoyed this recipe.  We felt that there could be a great deal done to it to add to it.  I think I will be adding some fresh baby spinach next time as well as increase the garlic as we are huge on garlic.  My husband enjoys a bit of spice so I did add a bit more red pepper.  I did not have the flakes.  I also think I will try using half and half to reduce the amount of cream used.  I did not notice anything about the sauce being thin or anything, however I did add a bit of Parmesan cheese & add to the pasta to mix it all together to serve.

Needed an easy recipe for 80 and sized this one up.  Everyone loved it.  Good flavour.  Used 1" chunks of breakfast sausage (on sale) and added diced red and green peppers for added texture.  Also cut down fat component by using mostly canned evaporated milk along with some 1/2 & 1/2.  Diced tomatoes made it easier too.  Will definitely use as an "at home" recipe.

So simple and so delicious. My husband was quite enthusiastic in his praise of this dish, which he said was a definite keeper.  I didn't think it would be so flavorful, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I even wanted to make it 2 nights in a row!!

The only negative I could find is that there wasn't any leftovers.  Recipe as listed fed 5 and was filling.  Used italian diced tomatos and Bob Evans Italian Sausage which made things a tad easier during prep work.  I'll be making this again for my family and at the firehouse as I know it will be a hit there too.  Easy to prepare, cook and pretty cheap.  Served it with fresh bread and red wine.

Tasty, but the sauce was too thin and I did mix the pasta in with the sauce.  However, I used fat free half & half so maybe that was the problem?  Next time I will use less half & half and add some low fat cream cheese or sour cream to see how that tastes.  I also used sweet chicken sausage (it's what I had) but will try spicy sausage next time.

I've never rated a recipe before but I had to for this one.  This dish is delicious.  The only thing I did differently is I used Hot & Spicy Italian Sausage and I omitted the red pepper flakes.  And, I added mushrooms. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top and serve with crescent rolls and a salad.  Yummy!

This dish is de-lish!!!  It was easy to prepare and the flavor was AMAZING!!!  The only thing I changed was I used whole wheat penne pasta (we don't use regular white pastas).  I can't say enough how much we loved it, in fact...we are making it for dinner guests this evening.  Thank You to whoever posted this recipe...it is now a family keeper in our home!!!

I usually hate to review if I didn't follow recipe exactly.  Really my only change was I didn't have an onion on hand and I added a couple tbsp of flour whisked with super cold splash of water to thicken it up.  Other than that it was exact and my whole family loved it!   From my 12 year old son to my 87 year old grandma.

This was so good AND easy! I left the recipe and ingredients for my husband to make on night and it turned out perfectly! I followed advice from reviews and to drain the grease from the sausage, used light cream rather than whipping cream, and diced italian tomatoes. I also used spicy Italian sausage. Can't wait to make this again!!

I made this for dinner last night.  It was fantastic! I used hot and sweet sausage, so I omitted the red pepper flakes.  It was spicy enough.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Even my finicky son enjoyed it.  This is definitely a kepper.

Delicious!  I thought at first that perhaps the sauce needed more seasoning, but glad I tasted it first. Made the recipe exactly as is (used Sweet Italian Turkey Sausage) and it was very good!  Nice change from the usual tomato only meat sauces.  Make sure you cook your pasta in the sauce after draining off the salted water.  The sauce cooks into the pasta for an even better flavor.

Excellent!  I had to make some changes based on what we had available in the house.  Sorry! (we just had a huge blizzard)  I used spicy italian turkey sausage, so I skipped the red pepper.  I had some half and half instead of heavy cream and used whole wheat rotini pasta.  I used a whole 28 oz can of 6 in 1 tomato sauce.  I couldn't there for didn't drain it.  My kids loved this. Fast and easy!

Delicious! Super Easy! I have no idea why these flavours work so well together, but this one's a keeper for sure. Note: Because we have a vegetarian in the family, I browned the sausage separately. Thanks for a fork-lickin' addition to our monthly menu!

Pretty good.  Just strong sausage taste.  I think if I fix this again, I will half the sausage and half ground meat.  I put parmesan cheese in the mix to thicken it up.  But next time I will mix it all in a casserole dish, put mozz cheese on top and bake it.  It just needs something.

Great dish.  I followed the directions as written except I didn't want to wait for the sauce to thicken so I mixed some flour with some sauce then added it back to the sauce.  Turned out GREAT.  The sausage can also be subbed out for any other meat.  This would be great with chicken.  Thanks

This dish was excellent. Very tasty and so easy to make.  I made some variations, like I used less cream and added more red pepper flakes b/c I wanted some more heat. Other than that, this dish was delicious.  I have already had a request to make it for my niece's 19th birthday party!

This was a quick, easy, and  delicious recipe for after work, or anytime.  I did substitute a can of crushed Italian Plum Tomatoes to save a step.  I will definitely make this again soon.

This dish is absolutely AMAZING and it heats up well the next day. I was worried the red pepper flakes would make it too spicy (I have a bland palate), but they mostly added flavor and just the tiniest bit of kick. My husband went back for seconds, which means this dish stays on our dinner menu indefinitely!

I was really unsure of this dish, especially because I tweaked it based on the ingredients I had on hand, but it was phenomenal! I only had Kielbasa smoked sausage, so I chopped it up and sauteed it with pepper flakes drizzled in olive oil. Then I added the chopped onion and minced garlic. Since I was making a smaller batch, I added 1c. 1/2 and 1/2, 1/2 6oz can of tomato paste, and half a tomato, chopped. I seasoned with salt and pepper and oregano, and then tossed with the pasta. It was delish!! Will definitely be making again :)

This was so yummy. The family loved it! I followed the recipe just as written except I could only find petite diced tomatoes in the 28 oz. I am not sure if that is similar. I can't wait to make this when  Ineed to bring a dish to a some function. Thank you!

Great dish. After reading the reviews I have to say that those who didn't like this dish probably didn't have much cooking talent. I am by no means a professional chef, but I do understand that seasonings make or break a dish. I've never made a cream sauce before, but this turned out excellent. I drained the tomatoes first, and added tomato paste, the sauce was so thick I added some extra water and cream. All of the flavors blended well, it was spicy (not hot, but flavorful) and savory, just as I expected. If you don't know how to season food order take-out, otherwise this recipe is great.

This was really good.  You have to be sure to let it simmer, it will thicken.  I added my drained, slightly dry pasta to the pan with the mixture.  I also used half a can fire roasted tomatoes and half a can of italian tomatoes, omitted the red pepper.  Very good!  Will add to my weekly meal rotation.

This has become a regular meal in my house.  I do just a you said, add the pasta into the sauce.  Maybe some of you are rinsing the starch out?  I did cut down the cream to one pint or one cup and I added in the juice from the tomatoes.  Do not use diced tomatoes to save time, it's not the same.

This is awesome.  :)  I doubled the amount of sausage and just used the loose instead of messing with the links.  Also, I used Cayenne pepper instead of the flakes.  I sprinkled some shredded mozzarella on my serving when it was on the plate.  Definitely DELISH!  :)

This recipe is just so easy!  It's a hit with all members of the family.  We have had it without the cream, just a tomato sauce based dinner and it's just as good, if not better!  You can leave out the red pepper if you are not a fan of spicy foods.  The sauce (minus cream and  the pasta) freezers beautifully for an easy meal during the week.  It is great leftover, just store the pasta separately. I'm getting hungry just writing this review!

Delicious and simple, my favorite combination. I did not have heavy cream, so used skim milk and added cottage cheese to 'thicken' it up a bit. The small curds melted right into the sauce. Perfect!  Thanks for a quick and tasty meal!

What an excellent recipe!! In the past I've added sausage to pasta but it always missed something. The cream in this recipe adds extra flavour & works really well with the tomatoes to create a dreamy sauce. My husband couldn't get enough & went back for seconds! A definite compliment for any recipe! I didn't change a thing, but next time I may cook more pasta as I have a little sauce left over. Will be making this again very soon! Delicious!

This was really good! My kids (ages 7 + 8) said it was the best pasta I've ever made. It took me awhile to thicken the sauce but I think I just needed the heat up higher. The result was amazing and it makes a lot!

This was so yummy. I topped mine with parmesan cheese in addition to the parsely, and added more garlic and more red pepper flakes to mine. Other than that I made it just like the recipe says and it was delicious!

Soooo good! Whole family loved it!  Only thing I did different was use 2 14oz cans of diced tomatos only because I forgot to pick up the plum kind.  This will definately become part of our meal rotation.

Used soy crumbles instead and added fresh spinach for a healthier main dish - worked out well.  Dinner guests enjoyed it and said it was hardy enough for a post-snowshoeing afternoon.  Enjoy with a rich rioja and shaved parmesan & parsely garnish.

Delicious!  Wonderful flavor and so easy to make.  The only thing I changed was that I used rigatoni instead of bow ties.  This recipe is perfect as is.  Will make this one on a regular basis for sure.  Thanks for sharing!

this is the best - not too hard to make, kids love it.  Don't freak about the crushed red pepper flakes - really can't taste them.  we put extra red pepper flakes on at the table.  I double the recipe and freeze half for a future night.

Used chorizo sausage and (reduced by half the amount) stewed tomatoes instead of plum. Added 3/4 red pepper at the onion stage.

I left out the whipping cream (for calories) and loved it. Also added diced sweet peppers I had on  hand. Will use this again.

I made this today and loved the flexibility of the recipe. I did use half and half to cut down on the fat and used mild sausage for more spice. I also used fresh tomato and zucchini from my garden and it was excellent! For the people that want their sauce a bit thicker you can add a teaspoon of corn starch and it thickens it up, but I thought it was perfect the way it was! Plus, even though we ate a ton there is enough for lunch tomorrow!

We loved this recipe!  Since I had no heavy cream I substituted 2 8oz cream cheese and cooked until it melted.  My family requested that we have this often since it is such a break from the standard pasta dishes.

I made this recipe many times when my children were young. They loved it. When my now grown daughter mentioned she made it for her husband, I found that I missed making it. I lost the recipe so I found this one. It is almost exactly as I had made it, however, mine called for the addition of 1/2 c grated parmesan cheese when adding the cream and just before folding in the cooked pasta. I followed this recipe and added the parmesan as I had done before, and it was ABSOLUTELY the most delicious dish!!! It is easy, flavorful and not something you want to have if you are worried about calories. If you are worried about calories, only have a tablespoon, but be careful, you will be tempted to eat a whole bowl. It is tough to resist. Thanks so much for posting this wonderful recipe. Originally I found it in Gourmet Magazine in the early 1970's. Obviously it is a family tradition at this point.

I just made this recipe tonight for dinner.  I was a little worried about the red pepper flakes because my kids are VERY picky and one doesn't like spicy foods at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and was pleasantly surprised.  This meal will be on our regular rotation for sure.  Lots of flavor and easy to make.  The timing of the meal was easy.  I did all the cooking of the sausage and chopping while I boiled the water and cooked the pasta.  Everything was ready at the same time which amazed me.  It wasn't terribly difficult to make but looked and tasted as though you went to a lot of trouble.

Very good flavor! I lightened it a bit by using FF 1/2 and 1/2 and poultry sausage. I didn't have much sauce, and what I did have took on kind of a grainy appearance. I think I may have boiled it too long, with the expectation that it would thicken. Regardless, this was a great dish.

This pasta dish is absolutely delicious, we loved it! I followed this recipe to the letter, and wouldn't change a thing. It's so very easy to put together in no time at all. I did garnish this with some fresh basil, and that did add wonderful flavor. I suggest topping this with a bit of grated parmesan also, but it's great without it too. I can't wait to heat up the leftovers for lunch! Thanks for sharing this wonderful dish, I will make this again for sure :)

This could have been better if I had all of the ingredients. The only pasta I had was a mixture of macaroni, shells, penne, I only had stewed tomatoes, I found a 1/2 pound of italian sausage and 1/2 pound of regular sasuage in the freezer and I was short a half cup of cream....  but it was still pretty darn good.

this was a great sunday night meal, and it was done in a flash!  Used 1/2 cup cream along with 1 cup low sodium chicken broth, and multigrain bow ties.  Also added cilantro for color and flavor, and used chicken sausage.

This was very OK. I wouldn't make it again. In my version there were no red pepper flakes, fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and I added green pepper. And no parsley. It was pretty heavy and the taste just wasn't all that pleasing. BLAH.

YUM...this is delicious! I did thicken my sauce a little with cornstarch, but after I stirred my pasta into the sauce I think it would've been better without it. So, make this recipe as stated and you won't be disappointed - neither will your guests, mine loved this dish.

I made this with a few changes.  I got a package of four cheese italian sausages at Walmart clearanced out, so I used that for my sausage.  Still removed from the casings and sauted with red onion and green peppers. I left out the oil, I didn't think that I needed it.  Instead of tomatoes I used half a jar of sun-dried tomato pesto.  Added some parmesan cheese and a little of the starchy pasta water for the sauce.  Tossed with the bow-tie pasta and served.  Very good.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I tried to lighten this recipe up a bit since the fat and calories were pretty high and I am trying to cut back. I cut the recipe in 1/2 since there are only two of us and I wasn't sure if I would like the changes. I used turkey sweet Italian sausage, omitted the oil and substituted fat free evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream. I also can my own tomatoes so I used a pint jar and added 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning. I blended the sauce with piccolini pasta (mini bow ties). With all the changes I made, this recipe was still delicious. Even good with a dash of parmesan on top. The heavy cream would have resulted in a creamier looking sauce, but this works if you want a lighter version. I was looking for a quick easy delicious meal and this fit the bill perfectly. It was on the table in 30 minutes as the recipe states. Thanks for a recipe that adapts well to change. If the lightened version was this good I can only imagine how delicious the regular version is! Thanks for a definite keeper.

This was delicious!  I made it healthier by using fat free half & half and using whole grain pasta.  I also used turkey sausage and added some fresh baby spinach while the onion and garlic was sauteing.  I also ended up using crushed tomatoes because my husband wont eat chunks of tomatoes.  All in all this was a great recipe that will be in my regular recipe routine.  Thanks Linda!

Not light on the calories, but definitely delicous!  I tried to use fat free half and half but it was runny so next time I will use the regular stuff.  Husband and I both loved it.

I really loved this dish!  Couldn't get sweet italian sausage so I used mild and reduced the red pepper flakes and it still had plenty of kick.  I, also, sprinkled Italian mixed cheeses on top, mmm good!!!! I certainly will make this again!

This is a easy recipe and it's great.  I grill the sausage and they cut them into slices then mix them in that way.

This was delicious!  Don't hesitate to try it!  I did use a couple variations.  I used penne instead of bow tie.  Instead of the canned tomatoes, I used fresh and threw in some italian seasoning.  Also, I only had one cup of heavy cream, so I added about 1/2 c. of sour cream to it.  It came out SO good!  I would definitely make this again.

My family loves this.  I use spicy sausage & skip the hot pepper flakes.  Also, I use a can of evaporated 2% milk instead of the cream, as I always have some on hand.

So easy and so terrific!!  I did leave out the red pepper flakes for my 6-yr old, but I'm sure my husband would have liked it even more if I had included it.  The only thing I did differently was to run some of the tomatoes through my food processor because we don't like really chunky tomato sauce.  The ingredients are simple, it's quick to prepare, and we will be eating this often!

Simple and delicious! Made recipe pretty much just a stated.I used bulk mild italian sausage, which has no casing, so easy to work with.  As another reviewer suggested, I drained out most of the oil after cooking sausage. I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used 1 1/2 Tbsp dry. Added pasta into the pan and tossed with about 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese.  
This is a keeper!  Mmm,Mmm good!

I wanted to lik this, but just thought it was ok. Hubby and son did too, didn't ask for more. I used half and half instead of cream, so maybe that makes a difference.  It also needed more flavor, so after I tasted it, I added more seasonings.

Awesome.  I used the canned diced tomatoes and followed the recipe exactly.  It tasted even better the next day, so be sure to double the batch.

Loved it!  Finally have new recipe to add to the limited selection of dinners my husband likes too!  Made a few changes though.  Substituted 1/2 cup of buttermilk for some of the heavy cream because after thanksgiving, my grocery store only had a small container left. (Unlike other reviews, I wouldn't dream of making a cream sauce without cream!)  Also, I used 1 14.5 oz can petite diced tomatoes and one 14.5 oz can fire roasted tomatoes. Lastly, I added a little brown sugar to balance the heat from the red pepper flakes, and because I didn't have any sweet italian sausage, just mild.  Can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was delicious & my seven year old thought so too! (minus red pepper flakes)
Incredibly quick & easy for weeknight dinners...but I would defiantly consider serving to friends & family @ a weekend gathering.

My family absolutely LOVES this dish, we probably have it once a week!  To make it super quick and easy, I use ground Italian sausage from the meat case, and canned Italian style diced tomatoes.  YUM.

This is phenomonal quick dinner!  It is most certainly going in my recipe rotation.  I was a little nervous about making it because my husband doesn't like cream (or at least he thinks so!)... but he gobbled it up and agreed I should make it again.  I made it pretty much as directed with a few minor exceptions.  I left out the 1/2 tsp. salt because the canned tomatoes and salted pasta have enough.  I used diced tomatoes and drained them.  I didn't have Italian style so I added Italian seasoning.  I topped with grated parmesan/romano cheeses.  I would love to try topping with fresh chopped basil but didn't have any.  I used regular ground sausage instead of messing with the casings.  GREAT RECIPE!  Thank you!!!!

We loved this - though mine looked much different from the picture... :)  We also left the onions out as my hubby doesn't like onions (too bad) I thought the sauce would be great with seafood instead of sausage as well and I will try it with that sometime. I will make this again for sure!  A great meal! YUMMY

My husband thought this was *amazing* but I just thought pretty good. He's first gen Italian so... it's a keeper. I added 1 tsp italian seasoning to the diced tomatoes (regular, not roma), next time I'll add more along with diced red peppers. On suggestion of the submitter I combined the pasta with the sauce before serving which solved the liquid-y problem others had.

Very hearty and delicious! I omited the oil and just cooked the sausage in pan with cooking spray. Didn't use pepper flakes (husband not a spicy food fan). Used fat free half-n-half instead of heavy cream. Used half canned tomatoes (drained) and half fresh (seeded and chopped). Results were excellent and leftovers heated up nicely.

I had gone to one of my girlfriend's houses recently and she had this out (leftovers no less) along with a couple of other things for a quick dinner.  I fell in love and asked where she got the recipe.  I made this myself tonight with a few minor changes and WOW WOW WOW, it was just as good if not better.  CHANGES: I used Olive Oil Cooking Spray, Lean Turkey Italian Sausage (Hot), Fat Free Half & Half, Diced tomatoes (w/basil, oregano & garlic) and a few shakes of Wondra for thickening (since I used the FF Half & Half).  I love it, husband loves it, a total winner!!  I am going over to my Sister-in-laws for Halloween and I'm going to make a batch of this and bring it along.

This was 4 stars after my tweaking. I used 2 cans of undrained diced tomatoes, lots of garlic, basil and parmesan, a chopped red pepper and instead of crumbling the sausage i cut it into bite sized links. This gave the dish a much nicer presentation. Served with a nice salad and garlic bread, it was yummy. Thanks for a good start! I will be definitely be making this again.

This is a very tasty recipe.  Rather colorful, too for a pasta recipe!  I will certainly make it again for my family especially using bow tie pasta.  I did, however, bake the sausage first in the oven to make it a little less greasy and fattening.  I cut up the sausage  into small attractive pieces and added this to the tomato-cream mixture.  I cut back on the red pepper flakes and also added minced garlic and mushrooms to the onions.  Sprinkling the top with grated cheese and minced parsley completed this lovely pasta dish!

Excellent recipe, husband had two bowls.  Only thing I did different was use fat free half and half instead of heavy cream.  I'm sure using the HC makes it even richer than it was.  I will make again and may add pine nuts and mushrooms this time.  Update.. have made this several more times and now use two cups of FF half and half 11/2 cups goes into pan add cornstarch to remaining 1/2 cup and then add to pan sauce thickens up perfectly

Oh my gosh this is good.  I added some fresh oregano and thyme from the garden, but followed the recipe exactly other than that.  If you mix the pasta into the sauce as the recipe states it is not runny at all.  This is a new favorite at our house.

Great recipe!  I have 3 small children who are picky eaters.  But not when it came to this dish.  They absolutely loved it along with my wife.  It's definitely a keeper.

As written, 4*.  I added sauteed fresh mushrooms and good quality shredded parmesan cheese, and that bumped it to 5*.  Leftovers are not great.

This is delicious!  I had to use some cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes, and one(14.4 oz) can Italian stewed tomatoes and one can(14.5oz) of petite diced tomatoes, adding about a 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning to make up for the lack of spices in the diced tomatoes.  I served this with shredded parmesan sprinkled on top, and a tad of fresh ground pepper.  I will make this again!

Tasty and simple. I have made this a variety of ways and everyone says it has a "restaurant flavor". Sometimes I use turkey sausauge, or hamburger meat. I also puree twice the amount of garlic in my food processor, we love the flavor of garlic. I have also used a 26 oz. jar of pasta sauce instead of the canned tomatoes. It always turns out well.

Awesome recipe. Only change I made was to use half and half in place of cream, and it was still exceptional. Guests gave rave reviews - and had seconds and thirds! A definite keeper for my faves book.

My husband and very very picky 6 year old son loved this.  Said I could serve it in a restaurant.  I added a bit less salt that called for and didn't use the oil as others had suggested.  I also used half and half instead and used mild Italian sausage.  Turned out great.  I'll be making this again for sure!

We all really loved this recipe, I have made it twice now and it is super easy to put together.  It is now in my top 5 favorite recipes from AR.  It is pretty rich and flavorful, a VERY welcome change from straight up tomato or cream sauces.  It's the best of both worlds!  It would be good with just about any kind of sausage.

Delicious!  I made with turkey sausage because it's what I had on hand.  I made sure to drain most of the grease off before adding the onions and other ingredients.  Will be putting in my family favorites.

YUM This was delicious!  It has great flavor and the sausage is so good in this.  I recommend to definitely buy good Italian sausage in the casings.  It will taste so much better than some of your other cheap sausages that just come rolled up in plastic.  I accidentally bought spicy italian sausage instead of sweet.  It made it pretty spicy that way, but it still was excellent.  Can't wait to make it again with the sweet italian sausage.  This is a keeper!

I give this recipe a definite 5 on ease and a 4 1/2 on taste.  My bf messaged me 20 min before leaving work and what do I do...go to AR and post a request for help with dinner.  Within minutes I received a few recomendations and sent links to BF.  He picked this one and when we came home, he ended up making it.  It turned out delicious, if I was in the kitchen I would have tweaked it a little.  The only thing we changed was used 2 (14 1/2 oz) of Stewed Italian Tomatoes and added a about a have a tsp of granulated sugar 3 minutes before combining sauce to pasta.  Turned out great, would only possibly add a 1/2 cup vodka and 4-6 oz of pan seared pancetta!  Either way, definitely a simple, easy weeknight dinner the whole family would love.  And best part-NO PROCESSED SAUCE!

I make this dish very often. It is a family favourite. I have taught 2 of my sons to make it. Try to use good quality diced tomatoes. I have found that some are much better than others and it really shows in the end result. Fresh parsley makes a big difference too. Thanks so much for this recipe it is fabulous!!!

This was a great recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe as is.  I only added 2 tsp of minced garlic (personal taste preference), omitted the olive oil felt that the grease from the sausage was enough, used low fat cream, and topped with romano cheese.  My family loved it.  My husband had several helpings.

Really good!  I did not use the oil and don't think you really need it.  Do make sure to drain the sausage before you add the rest of the stuff.  I used turkey sausage but it was still plenty greasy!  I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomato and then added some Italian seasoning.  Also used penne instead of bow tie because that's what I had.  Topped with parmesan and it was fabulous!

This really was terrific.  I made the following changes to accommodate what I had on hand and it turned out marvelous.  I used bulk hot Italian sausage and skipped the red pepper flakes though I'd probably use them next time to make it a bit spicier.  I drained the meat after browning.  I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes seasoned with 1 tsp. Italian seasoning rubbed with a mortar & pestle (to get the essential oils going) for the parsley.  Instead of bow-ties, I used whole wheat penne.  I did not feel any additional salt was necessary, so I left that out too.  I highly recommend this recipe to others.  Thanks for the post.

One of the best recipes I've made in a long time! I used Bob Evans savory sausage and put in twice the crushed red pepper (I like spicy food) and absolutely loved this dish!  I made it last night and my boyfriend has already asked if we can have it again next week!

My family and I really liked this recipe. It was a little too spicy for my mom, but it is easy for my mom to say something is spicy. If you're the same way, just reduce the red peppers by half or just omit them completely. Either way it tastes great. :) I also don't add the whole box of pasta. I like it a little saucier.

We thought this recipe was great.  I didn't put the red pepper flakes in while it was cooking I put them on the table so that folks could add as much or as little as they wanted.  Will definitely make this again.  For those who worry about too much cream, it's not as though you are serving this everyday, are you?

This is quick and easy.  Perfect for a weeknight dinner.  I have made this twice now, once with sweet sausage and once with spicy.  Both were wonderful.  My husband even loves it and he isn't a pasta fan.

YUM...the first time i made this i made the mistake of using diced tomatoes and i didn't drain-it got a tad bit runny, but still tasted wonderful:)

the second time..i used regular italian tomatoes...added extra garlic and used fettichine noodles instead...

This was pretty good, a little bland though. Everyone seemed to like it. I did add the red pepper flakes and did not find it spicy at all.

This was agreat one!  I followed other's suggestions and used half and half instead of heavy cream and basil instead of parsley.  I also omitted the salt and added alittle sprinkle of pecorino romano at the end.  My husband loved this we'll definitely be making it again!

This is a simple and delicious recipe that would be a great meal to serve company. I used light cream and it seemed fine. For our personal preferences, I think  I might use half as much sausage (it was quite heavy on the sausage) and possibly add some veggies. I think it would be delicious with some asparagus and/or possibly some roasted red peppers. But the recipe exactly as is was DELICIOUS. My husband liked it COLD the next day.

I substituted turkey sausage for regular and used whole milk instead of half & half to lighten up the recipe.  Due to the changes I needed to thicken the sauce with a little corn starch, but I expected that. So easy and flavorful that I will definitely make this again, thanks!!

I have made this recipe for a few years now and my family loves it.  I do change a couple of things.  I use Italian Basil instead of Parsley and cook the sauce longer than the recipe says.  This reduces the liquid and the sauce comes out great!

A keeper, will definately make it again. I have to up the amount of salt because it's not salty enough, other than that it's very good. I added some red pepper and mushroom and it turned great.

I just made this & I am in love!!! I used a 12-oz package of mild Italian sausage. Added half of a jar of oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes. Omitted onion because I was too lazy to chop anything. Used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes & 1 T. dried basil. Simmered all this for about 30 minutes. (oh- also added a bit of brown sugar) THEN I added the cream. OMG this is TOO good. This is obviously a splurge meal....thanks for submitting!!!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes. I actually picked it up someplace else on the net many years ago. THe only change I make is getting tomatos with italian spices (basil, oregano and garlic) already in them. It makes it delish. Definately not an everyday treat. But great for a special occasion.

Fantastic base recipes.  Took other reviewers suggestions and added mushrooms, fresh spinach and used half and half (about 1 cup) instead of heavy cream thickened with corn starch.  There were zero left overs!

Since I don't like spicy food very well, I omitted the red pepper falkes, used low fat turkey sausage, and FF half and half (like other raters suggested) to make it lower in fat and not so hot. I also used the diced tomatoes with basil added because I already had the can at home. This was a very good recipe and I'll definitely make it again. I may try some of the other additions that other made, such as mushrooms for example.

This was good, but tasted best when reheated the following day! I wanted something low-fat-ish, so I substituted sweet Italian turkey sausage, and half-and-half instead of whipped cream. Yummity-yum!

This is a keeper!  One of the few recipies I've tried that's true to it's "ready in" time.  Agree that it needs a little more than the recipe calls for, so I added:
1 chopped red pepper, Italian Seasoning, pepper, 1/2 can tomato paste, and fresh grated parm cheese.  
Would also be excellent with sliced fresh mushrooms, but unfortunately, my boyfriend won't eat them.

This ranks right up there as one of the best pasta recipes we've ever had! I added basil to it, and used petite cut tomatoes. Topped it with grated parmesan cheese and my husband couldn't get enough of it! Thank you... this is  a great recipe which I'll be making often.

I had made this for 3 ladies that work with me, what a hit, they just loved it and have invited themselves over tonight if I will make it again. Fabulous, even a novice in the kitchen can make this!

I made this for dinner the other night and thought that this was amazing. All of the flavors blended together very nicely.  I only changed two things. I added some sun dried tomatoes to the mixture and added about 1/4 cup more of heavy cream. Me and my dinner guest had seconds because it was so good!

If the kids would have eaten it I would have given it 5 stars...my hubby and I both really liked it and I will try it on the kids again!  I am on Weight Watchers so I made a few adjustments to make it more point friendly -- turkey sausage, no oil and 8 oz light cream cheese instead of heavy cream.  Also made the following adjustments for convenience/taste -- whole bag (14 or 16 oz I think?) of bow ties, a little Italian Seasoning, 5 cloves of garlic -- 3 cloves of garlic is not nearly enough for our tastes and I will probably use at least 6 cloves in the next preparation, and sprinkled with a little parmesan before serving.  Still had plenty of sauce for the extra noodles and guess I could have easily fed 8-10 adults, especially with bread and a salad.  Great, easy weeknight meal!

This was excellent!!  The only change I made was to get the Italian style tomatoes already diced to save some time.  My husband wanted the leftovers for dinner the next night which is really saying something since my hubby never wants leftovers!!

Very good.  I used penne, and turkey italian sausage to save on calories/fat.  I added more red pepper.  My sauce was a little thin also, but still had wonderful taste.

This is soooooo good!  I used a can of diced tomatoes which made the prep time that much faster.  Instead of using the whole sausages and removing the casings, I just used ground Italian style pork.  Even faster!!  I did not use pepper flakes, because I'm a big baby when it comes to spice.  I didn't drain it either; I don't think the sauce was thin at all.  I can't even say how good this was!!!  Thanks!

Excellent! Even my pasta hating husband loved it!  The only change I "had" to make because I didn't have all the ingredients was, I only had 1 cup of heavy cream, so I used an additional 1/4 of half and half and 1 tbls of sour cream.  Made garlic bread and salad.

This was awesome!  I didn't have the plum tomatoes and was planning on using diced... however, I only had a 14 oz can.  So I used diced and an 8 oz can of sauce.  My husband rated this 5 stars from his first bite.  Next time I make this I will make sure I have the right amount of sauce. (I'm sure that will intensify the taste) But even with my error it came out delicious.  Thank you for sharing this is a definite keeper!

Ok, that was just plain awesome! So simple and tasty. However, don't miss where it says to drain the tomatoes if you buy pre-diced.....like I did, DUH!

Excellent! This is a simple and delicious pasta dish. The cream takes out the acidity of the tomatoes. Even my 6yr old ate it so you KNOW it's a keeper.

Great!  We loved this in my house and I also suggest adding the grated parm like another member suggested.  It gives it a great flavor.  This will be on our rotation once we use up the frozen portions.  Thanks!

My wife and children are rather picky, so when I started to cook this recipe they were a little skeptical.  Once the sausage and red pepper were working thier aromatic magic  however the level of excitement went up in the house!  This is a great meal to serve with some warm italian bread and a green salad.  This one will definately go to the front of the recipe box for me, the family could'nt get enough of it.  I agree with one of the previous reviewers however, this dish really needs to be tossed in the pan, presentation is much nicer and the colors more apealing.  Grate a little fresh parmasaen cheese on the top and enjoy!

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was quick, easy, and delicious. The only modification I made was to puree the canned tomatoes in the blender as I prefer a less chunky sauce. I also wanted to sauce a bit thicker so I cooked it longer than the recommended time so it would reduce more and become a creamier sauce. Delicious.

This was a huge hit with my family, the best I've tried yet.  We're not big on bow ties, so I used fettucine, omitted the olive oil, used spicy instead of sweet sausage, used diced tomato with italian herbs (canned), didn't have fresh parsley, added about half cup of Parmesan & romano blend cheese & it still was thinner than I'd like, so I added cornstarch mixed with water.  I didn't want leftovers (3 of us), so I froze what was left, we'll see how that works out.  This will definately be put in my regular rotation, it was absolutely fabulous, I would highly recommend!!!

Wow - this was SO good!  I was looking to make something that I had almost all the ingredients for, and this came up.  I did use the canned, diced tomatoes that come with garlic, basil and onion instead of the plum tomatoes, and I didn't have cream so I used fat free milk with 2-3 tablespoons of flour mixed in (but now wonder if I needed the flour.)  And I had about 1/4 cup left over alfredo sauce (the kind in the jar) so I added that in too.  I didn't cook the sausage in oil, because I felt it didn't need it, and I added no salt.  Yum, yum, yum.  Will definitely make again for friends. I think the possibilities with this recipe are endless.  Thanks for sharing, Linda.

This recipe was one of the recipes that helped redeem myself from a disaster using the recipe coq au vin. Everyone loved this  meal. The bow tie pasta just adds to the presentation I'm sure you can use any other pasta with it. Love this recipe. You must try it. :)

This is a wonderful recipe!  Everyone enjoys this, and you can feed an army by doubling it.  The cream cuts the acidity of the tomatoes nicely.  Over the last several preparations I've tweaked and add some hot italian sausage, use lots of fresh basil instead of parsley, and a cup of frozen peas.  Thanks for sharing, Linda!

Yum! Our sauce turned out sweet, which was very good.  We added dried Basil to the sauce.  We also used sweet Italian chicken sausages from whole foods.  They also have the perfect plum tomatoes there from Italy!  Drain the pasta about 2-3 minutes early and let it soak up the sauce by cooking it in the skillet.  Thanks!

this was better if left to sit overnight, it melded the flavors together much better.  Also I substituted maple flavored mild breakfast sausage and it was delicious.

This was really good - I used hot Italian sausage, because I usually like it better.  In this dish, however, it really overpowered the delicate cream sauce.  Next time I will use the mild sausage, and maybe try to thicken the sauce a bit.  Very, very easy, and looks and tastes like a restaurant dish!!

This is a winner.  Easy to make and it doesn't take too long.  I did make a few alterations to this recipe to cut down on the fat.  I used 1% milk instead of the heavy cream and cornstarch to thicken.  I also just cut up the Turkey sausage into rounds so that I could control how much meat ended up on my plate. Next time I won't use as many chili peppers though.  I found with a spicy sausage you don't need as many peppers. All in all a great recipe and my husband wants this in our regular rotation. Thanks a million!!

We loved this!  I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and the sauce was still creamy and delicious.  I also used basil instead of parsley.  It was so good, we not only saved the leftovers, but actually ate them!  :)

Delicious and EASY to make!!!!  My family loved it.  I didn't have cream on hand and tried it with milk.  Flavor was still good.  I also used a turkey sausage with artichokes and sundried tomatoes.  YUM!

I thought this was really good and unusual.  It was easy to make and my husband loved it.  I think next time I would drain the grease off from the sausage before adding the rest of the ingredients, but it was really good.  I will make again.  Thx.

My boyfriend absolutely loves this dish. He says its in his top 5! I love it too. I use about 6-7 ripe vine tomatoes and 1/2 can of whole tomatoes that I dice up myself, sometimes I even add some of the tomatoe juice from the can of the whole tomatoes to make the sauce a bit thiner. I also throw in some of my favorites...sliced black olives and quartered artichoke hearts. You can leave those out. I truly love this dish...Thanks Linda!!

I have to say this was an excellent recipe.  I took the advice in the other posts and drained the sausage (I would do this in any recipe).  It reminded me of an entree I order at one of my favorite restaurants and now I can do it at home.  My husband was won over as well.

My husband loved this. Next time I will drain the meat - it was a little greasy. I want to add a bit of green pepper for some more color next time. It has a nice little kick to it. I also added some parmesean cheese to it. Great and easy. I will make this often.

I was looking for a recipe to use the italian sausage in my freezer.  This was perfect!  I used egg noodles instead of bowtie pasta which I already had on hand, and next time I think I will add some parmesian cheese.  Delicious!  Thank you for sharing this rescipe.

This is one of my hubby's favorites in our regular rotation! I use 2 14oz cans of diced tomatos instead of the plum tomatos and I just made it tonight with Hot Italian turkey sausage. It was just as delicious and to cut back on the fat I will continue to use that in place of regular sausage!

This was way better than I could of ever imagined!  All 4 of my picky kids ate it, and my husband who is not to willing to try new things, couldn't get enough.  I used a box and a half of the bow ties and there was plenty of sauce for it. I am e-mailing my friends and family this recipe!

I loved how quick and easy but also delicious it was.  I went a little lighter on the red pepper flake than the recipe called for to satisfy the family but other than that, followed the recipe to a t and it was great.

This is a very good recipe! The only thing I did differently was using eight fresh Roma tomatoes, that I chopped up. Otherwise, I cooked it according to the recipe

This was an easy and delicious meal.  I substituted the smaller bowtie pasta because my husband is not a fan of the regular bowtie pasta. I would definitely make it again and again.

This was great. Thank you for the recipe.

I added a red bell pepper and some mushrooms for a little more volume. 

I also substituted a 13.5 oz can of coconut milk for the heavy cream to make it dairy-free. I was worried about it tasting too coconut-y, but I added extra salt and crushed red pepper and it worked out just fine! 

Happy cooking everyone. :)

This was a good, simple dinner for a Monday. I made half this recipe with mild sausage and seasoned, diced tomatoes. I left out the red pepper flakes and salt. I topped this pasta with some mozzarella cheese and served with swiss-onion bread.

Modified this for vegan diet and it was super crazy good. I followed the recipe substituting Hot Italian Beyond Sausage for the sausage, 2 cans of unsweetened coconut creme in place of the heavy cream, added more salt, and I omitted the red pepper flakes since the sausage had enough heat on its own. It was a bit soupy at first like some others said. I cooked it down some and then got impatient and added cornstarch to thicken faster.  It worked and the whole family loved it, including my youngest super picky child. This is one for the recipe box. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Bit too heavy on the tomatoes for my taste but otherwise great. Half and half worked fine instead of heavy cream and letting the pasta finish cooking in the sauce made the flavor really soak in.

This was easy and delicious. I had to use shells, didn't have bow ties, other than that, followed exactly. My Italian sausage did not generate much fat when browning and did not need to be drained as other reviews have said. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe! Very easy to make. Was a little too spicy for my mom and brother but then again they’re wusses when it comes to spice. To me, it was perfect. Just keep in mind if anyone in your family doesn’t like spice, maybe set them a plate of pasta aside before adding the red pepper flakes.

Changed it , but still had to rate it. Made the original recipe and and added 1/2 C Parmesan/Romano cheese. Outstanding! It SHOULD be at approximately 1000 calories a bite!
I highly recommend using REAL Italian sweet sausage (NOT turkey) and San Marzano type tomatoes. Good ingredients make a for a good recipe.

Loved the recipe as it was! Very good!!! Make sure to use good Italian sweet sausage and Italian-style plum tomatoes as that's where a majority of the seasoning comes from. Tasted even better the second day. I also threw in fresh spinach at the last minute.

I made this tonight for my 6th time in past 3 months my 16 year old daughter usually is the one that requests it on her choice of weekly dinner pick. 1st time I made it as stated since then I've been making it with chicken instead of sausage since my daughter doesnt like sausage she chops the chicken  up into bite size toss into the pan with little of oil and couple dashes of Italian seasoning I also use diced tomatoes in Italian seasoning and garlic and we add around 4 cups of fresh spinach which I think is perfect in this dish all of my kids love the spinach added. I've even made it once with sausage and chicken both in it every time it has been a crowd pleaser. after I toss the bow ties into the sauce I add some parmigiano cheese super easy meal that my kids can even make by themselves

So Good! I didn't have stewed tomatoes so used 2 - 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes. I forgot to drain so I added a slurry of cornstarch (about 2 T with enough cold water to make into a thickening agent). To add a little more flavor I added 1/2 - 6 oz can of tomato paste and 1 t. oregano and 1/2 t parsley. Just before taking off heat, I threw in a generous handful of fresh spinach to add color.

This was delicious! I only gave it four stars because it was a bit bland for me before I added Parmesan cheese to the sauce and melted it in. I used rotini because it’s what I had on hand. I used crushed tomatoes which saved me time chopping. Will definitely be on my weekly rotation!

This recipe was just what I was looking for (something different to do with Italian sausage) and turned out great!  It was fast and easy and it was also very delicious!  It was nice that it was so simple and good without needing a million ingredients.  I only had penne pasta on hand which seemed to still work great in the recipe.  My husband loved it!  I will definitely make it again!

I made this recipe with 1 28 oz can of diced tomatoes with ital seasonings instead of plum tomatoes and increased the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp which gave this dish a nice kick. I also added fresh baby spinach as another reviewer suggested. Excellent recipe and will definitely make again!!

It was great. Easy to make, very nice flavor. Couldn't really taste the red pepper flakes, so add more if you want to feel the spice.

Contrary to many of the negative reviews that stated it was bland, I made this last night and it was excellent and flavorful!

We did make some modifications though - we used spicy Italian sausage because sweet is for the weak, and we used a full teaspoon of red pepper flakes. We also added 7 chopped leaves of basil during the reduction.

My girlfriend topped hers with shredded mozzarella cheese, and I picked a parmesan/romano grated blend. I felt like the grated cheese made a huge difference.

Bland as is. Probably dependent on the brand of the Italian sausage and tomatoes? Was ok but expected much more with all the positive reviews.

Extremely yummy. My family loved the creamy texture and the spiciness from the sausage and red pepper flakes was not too overwhelming. I recommend you try this at least once. A great comfort food.

I made this but used a larger can of tomatoes, hot deer sausage and kielbasa because that's what I had. Added spinach. Used half and half instead of heavy cream.  My house full of guys loved it. I don't eat meat, so I ate everything else. It was delish!

This has become a family favorite. I have made it several times and they always assume I spent quite a bit of time in the kitchen. I added some fresh sauteed mushrooms to mine the last time I made it.... tasty

Simply delicious, literally. Just stuck with the recipe and resisted the urge to add other veggies. Served with a garden salad and garlic toast. Had to force myself to skip thirds.

I was looking for something different for Italian sausage and this was perfect! I used half and half because that's what I had. I also added Italian seasoning and some orange bell pepper. My husband had 3 helpings and said it's a keeper. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have had this recipe saved for years and I made it for the first time tonight when I had to get a last minute dinner on the table. I had 90% of the ingredients and went for it. The only thing I didn’t have were the tomatoes. I had diced, fire roasted tomatoes and substituted that instead. To compensate, I added some Italian seasoning as the tomatoes that I used were salsa style. It came together quickly (maybe 30 minutes or less) and it was incredible. My husband inhaled two huge portions despite saying “he wasn’t that hungry”. I was supposed to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow, but there wasn’t a drop left. This is definitely going into the rotation again. I may try to substitute lighter options (fat free half and half) like others have done to save calories, but this was divine as written. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

I just made this dish this evening for my family and it was a hit! My husband who is very picky about any type of food said he would rate it a 9-10 and that is high praise coming from him. I would add just a little less red pepper next time just for my family, because my daughter found it a little spicy for her. But over all delicious!

My family loved this meal.  My daughter even said this was her new favorite meal.  I only used a quarter of the onion and used diced Italian tomatoes from the can, I think it saves time.

Delicious! Very nice balance between the sweeter cream and tomatoe flavor and the spice of the Italian sausage/crushed red pepper and the We used gnocchi-shaped pasta instead of bowties, and we substituted just under 2 tbsp of dried parsley for the fresh. Would definitely make this again.

This recipe was delicious and very easy. Perfect recipe if you are having 3-4 friends over for dinner. The sauce tasted better than any vodka cream I've ordered at a restaurant. The  consistency of the sauce was perfect. I did add a bit more garlic, salt and a dash of pepper after tasting the sauce for a bolder flavor which I thought made the recipe extra delicious.

I made this for my husband and I and we absolutely loved it!! It made so much I had to make several bowls and take to work for coworkers the next day just to not waste any of it! The only difference I made was I added 1/2 cup Parmesan Romano cheese to the sauce and about 1 cup of onions as my husband and I both love onions. This is such a simple recipe and it turns out delicious! Definitely going to become a staple for my family!

It was a pretty mellow flavor as is, so I had to add to it, sorry...I used regular Italian sausage but upped the onion, garlic and red pepper and added Italian seasoning and anchovy paste. I let it simmer while the pasta was taking its sweet time cooking then turned off the heat and added an Italian cheese blend and a splash of sherry and dried parsley. Topped with fresh basil and a dash of smoked paprika and nutmeg. The BF loved it! If I ever have cream and Italian sausage in the house together that needed to be used, I may do this again.

This is incredible. I doubled it (lots of company), had to use crushed plain tomatoes (all the store had) and so I added some herbs to make up for it. Every bite disappeared within 20 minutes. Definitely a repeat.

This was great. It was simple and quick. Would make this again. I made it exactly as the instructions say and the sauce wasn’t too thin or thick.

Love this recipe!!   It is wonderful as is, but I double the meat.  My grocery store has chicken, kale sausage and it is perfect!  I cut up the tomatoes, add the juices and then add tomato paste.  Don't skip the red pepper flakes - it adds a nice spice!  This one's a winner at our house!

Definitely a five star recipe. I make this recipe as stated only I use drained crushed tomatoes instead (couldn’t find what the recipe calls for). Two of the grocery stores near me didn’t sell “Italian” style tomatoes (odd, I know) so I had to throw in aTbs of Italian Seasoning to each 28oz can of crushed tomatoes.

Easy recipe. My family said good enough to make again.  My only changes were petite diced tomatoes with 1/2 t. Italian Seasoning as I couldn't find the Italian plum tomatoes.  After browning sausage I added 1 chopped green and 1 chopped red bell pepper to the skillet for extra flavor and variety.  After they cooked for a few minutes I added the onion and garlic.  I didn't add any red pepper flakes as some of my family can't handle spice. Before adding the tomatoes and half and half, I sopped up a bit of the sausage grease with a paper towel in the pan.  Before serving, I added the cooked pasta to the pan and let the pasta absorb some of the liquid.  The recipe said it serves 6, but with the added peppers, I would have been able to feed at least 8. Of course that also depends on the appite of those at your table.

Was pretty good.  I used jarred sauce and added the heavy cream.  Also put it over rigatoni.  Was like a spicy vodka sauce.

I made this recipe the first time and thought it was fine. Now I made this recipe again a year later and I'm loving it! I found that your ingredients highly dictate the flavor in this dish. Instead of using sweet Italian sausage I went for mild this time; IMO this gives a lot more flavor that the sweet sausage+red pepper flakes. Next I believe that I had bought the wrong tomatoes previously. This time I bought true Italian style plum tomatoes. These tomatoes were tough to find at the store (canned, that wasn't initially clear to be in the ingredient list), but I finally did and they're wonderful. They're skinned oblong tomatoes and the "plum" refers to them being paste tomatoes which have a saucy consistency. With the right sausage and tomatoes this dish takes on a new life compared to the complaints that some other reviewers have had about the dish "lacking flavor."

Loved it. I went a little light on the amount of cream and it didn’t come out as runny as the first time I made it. Throw in some bell peppers and it really pops.

Substituted Jimmy Dean Sausage for the Italian sausage and followed the recipe.  Came out fantastic.  Wife fought me over leftovers, not leaving her much for her lunch the next day.

I made it with two 15 oz cans of diced Italian style tomatoes, and added a bay leaf in with the onions and garlic and some arugula at the very end with the parsley. The biggest complaint I had about this from my girlfriend was that it “needs more vegetables.” Which she says about pretty much everything I make. Next time this meal graces my kitchen I’ll add some mushrooms and frozen peas to appease her. All in all, excellent recipe fairly quick and easy to make!

OMG - years on this site, this is the best recipe ever!
I made it with DelMonte Basil, Garlic and Oregano tomatoes. Added some fresh tomatoes to the sauce and some garden fresh basil on each serving.
Turned into the best Italian meal I have ever had.
Ya gotta know what your doing; simmer the sauce to the correct consistency, add the sausage back when it's right and then add the farfalle at the end.
The best Italian meal ever, including a 2 star Italian restaurant. This is amazing.

This recipe is perfectly the way it is, but I did make some changes to add my own spice to the recipe the second time around. Instead of Italian sausage I used 1lb ground turkey with Italian seasoning and 2 links of chicken sausage chopped. I also added half a bag of fresh spinach towards the end.

Instead of pepper flakes I used a barbecue-esque rub I have and it really made the sausage pop! Reminded me of an old dish my Ma used to make. Only downside is that this really makes me poop a lot (maybe it's all that heavy cream?)!

This was excellent.  It also reheats really well.  I used half and half and skipped the oil, like other reviews recommended, and it was terrific.  Next time I'll be sure to crumble the sausage better so there are not so many larger chunks, but that's user error and not the recipe's fault.  I also plan to try this with chicken.  I did put the drained tomatoes in the food processor instead of chopping them.  Definite keeper! UPDATE: I made this using ground beef and it was good, but I needed to add more red pepper flakes to match the flavor of the sausage.

Living in a very small town in far West Texas, I was unable to purchase Italian sausage. However, I was able to buy a pack of uncooked Italian meatballs. I believe it was half beef and half sausage, but no matter. I crumbled them up and they worked fine. Otherwise I made this recipe exactly as written, and my man and I loved it. He is still raving about it this morning! Thanks for a great recipe!

Changes noted for my own use: made kid version with sweet italian sausages and a spicy version with andouille. Used 3-cheese pasta sauce (Trader Joe's). After sauce was heated through, added ~1/2 c freshly grated parmesan cheese, then stirred in 3/4 c (total) half and half. Did not boil.  Very good!

I LOVE THIS PASTA. 1) Take the sausage out of the casing. Cut the casing off. 2) After you cook the sausage, drain the oil.3)The directions say to get the tomatoes out of the can, cut the tomatoes and throw out the red tomato juice from the can. I use the red tomato liquid from the can. I put the tomato liquid AND heavy cream in the pasta . It makes a pink sauce and I think the pasta is better. This is so good.

Turned out great. I ended up using cayenne instead of flakes, but nice rounded flavor. I topped with a dab of parmesan cheese as well. I will make it again.

Oh my goodness this is so rich and flavorful!  It’s not a complicated recipe, nor is it ingredient heavy, and it comes together quickly. I used spicy Italian sausage instead of sweet and omitted the red pepper flakes. I added a couple shakes of fennel seed and used fresh basil instead of parsley. The key to it is to cook your pasta al dente, then add to the sauce to simmer. The pasta soaked up most of the sauce. I served this with a small salad and my husband loved it!  It make quite a bit, so we’re having it again tonight. We both agreed this is better than some dishes at Italian restaurants!  Thank you for the great recipe!

Wonderful recipe! I substituted spicy sausage for the sweet Italian style, and the flavor was excellent. I think that distributed the heat a little better than the red pepper flakes, but those do give a nice pop.

This recipe is delicious!! My boyfriend thought it was tasty as well!
 I substituted cream for half and half which gave the sauce a creaminess without being too heavy. I doubled the amount of garlic. To the simmering sweet Italian sausage, San Marzano tomato, onion, garlic mixture: I added bell pepper, 8 oz tomato sauce, and 1/2 tsp. of oregano. I  simmered this mixture for a bit covered. Then I added mushrooms and frozen peas and simmered. Next, I added half and half and simmered until sauce was done. Lastly, I mixed in the cooked pasta. I garnished the pasta with fresh basil. Yum! I am making this again tonight!

I doubled the sausage, using bulk sausage so I didn’t have to deal with casings. Used 2# Bob Evans Italian sausage, 16 Oz bow tie pasta, used a container of fresh chopped onion from the store due to hating chopping onion, added fresh sliced mushrooms on a whim (needed to use the fresh produce) jarred minced garlic, increased the crushed red pepper due to taste preference. I did use a 28 Oz can of “chef cut” Italian tomatoes as I found it at Big Lots on a song. I’ve previously used 2 15 Oz cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes, or 28 Oz can of whole tomatoes that I’ve broken up while cooking. The recipe is very forgiving. All good. I’ve used heavy cream (best), coffeehouse half and half with 30% more cream from LandOLakes (great sub with no compromise in flavor) and half and half (had to cook longer to reduce sauce) and whole milk (meh). This is a favorite go to comfort food recipe, adaptable to ingredients on hand, and adjustable to spice level. Next time I’m going to try hot or zesty sausage. Bob Evans has a roll of zesty sausage I’m going to try. Trust me, much easier to get bulk sausage/a roll of Italian sausage rather than dealing with casings.

This was delicious! The only change I made was using a cup of cream instead of 1 1/2, and regular peeled tomatoes instead of italian (and added a little basil). OH and I left out the pepper flakes because I have a super spice-sensitive kid ;). SOO good!

This dish is so much better than I thought it would be when I started. I was a little worried about flavor, but made it exactly has the recipe called for and wow it is delicious. Honestly, the key is to put the pasta into the sauce and cook it a little longer - it turns out perfect and I ate so much I was completely stuffed.  I’m having the left overs tonight because it does make a families worth, but I will definitely make it again - exactly as written.  Thank you for this delicious meal!

Recipe was delicious and easy. As a previous reviewer mentioned, it’s a nice easy idea to use 2 cans of Italian Diced Tomatoes. I drained both cans and then used that instead. Turned out delicious.

I used 1 qt of home canned tomatoes and added garlic basil seasoning to them.  I didn't use olive oil since I felt the sausage would make enough grease. We enjoyed it very much!  I would double and make it for a bigger group!

This has turned into one of my go to meals.  This past time I want able to find Italian style tomatoes so am using plain and adding Italian seasoning hoping it will be close.

We did not like this dish. It is very bland. The sauce doesn't thicken, and this weak soup poured over pasta did not have enough sauce or meat to make a good dish.

My whole family absolutely loves this dish!  The leftovers the next day (if any) are even tastier after more of the flavours have had time to blend together.  This one makes our regular rotation.

This is my go to recipe for quick dinner night.  I use pre diced Roma tomatoes with basil oregano and garlic instead of the Whole Roma Italian style tomatoes because my husband does not like Italian seasoning. The bad thing is there are never any left overs.

This was awesome. The only thing I did differently is use fresh cherry tomatoes since I hate canned food. I know some people flip their bisquits  about modifications,  but seriously.... I'm not buying canned anything. If you are used to canned food you won't know the difference.
I used the remaining cream for crem brule, also awesome.

Very flavorful, great textures, lots of colors, made with fresh ingredients so relatively healthy as well. My only criticism is I wish the sauce was a tad thicker. Next time I’ll add some starch to thicken it up without altering the flavor.

Absolutely delicious! Perfect compromise if you can’t decide between a red tomato sauce or a creamy cheesy white sauce. I use a spicy or mild-original flavor Italian sausage when I make this.

Super easy to make and very tasty! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and we really enjoyed it. This time I added about 6-7oz of fresh chopped spinach, and it was great again. Thanks for the recipe!

So, a really great and simple recipe.  I agree, must drain off excess fluid once meat, tomatos, and veggies are cooked down.  Also, needed a tad more salt, otherwise a wonderful dish

Really tasty recipe. Only small changes based on what I had in cupboard: I used Italian recipe stewed tomatoes and I did not drain them, plus egg noodles instead of bowties. Very good as leftovers the next day as well. Thanks!

A good and easy recipe. I made a few changes because I was using up what I had on hand. As others suggested I skipped the oil and it was fine without it. Sliced about 2 cups fresh mushrooms and added them with onions to the sausage. Doubled the garlic  as we can't get enough.  Added Italian spice to the meat mixture and skipped the parsley.  Lastly I didn't have any cream so I used evaporated milk. I know it's not fair to rate a recipe that I made so many changes to  but I hope this helps someone to realize how good and flexible this recipe is.

3 cloves of garlic? How cute. Used at least twice that. Half and half instead of heavy cream. Rather than chopping the tomatoes, I crushed them by hand. Messy, but more fun. Spice it up more to suit your tastes and you will be a very happy camper. This is a great base recipe to build on.

Delicious! This was perfect and even the kids ate it. I didn’t have a problem with it being too runny at all! It’s definitely a new fav!

One of my family’s favorites. So quick and easy and delicious. I follow recipe as written, except I add some Parmesan cheese to help thicken.

The only changes I made was Italian-style diced tomatoes, a touch more red pepper flake, and I added some oregano. The rest was by the recipe exactly, and I thought it was great.

My son was skeptical about me trying this recipe. The only change I made was to use half and half instead of the heavy cream. Turns out he loved it and even had seconds! I will definitely be making this again.

This was a great starting point, but with a few adjustments it was very good. I will definitely make this again. 
 
I originally wanted to make this exactly as written, but my local store didn't have stated tomatoes, so I used 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes w/ basil, garlic & oregano (drained & reserved the liquid) . Also, I used bulk mild Italian sausage because the store was out of links (I doubt this made a big difference).  Added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning and used about 4-5 cloves of garlic before adding the cream and simmering.  I boiled the pasta while it simmered, so not exactly sure how long.. maybe 10 minutes. I thought it was a bit too thin when I put the drained pasta with the sauce, but I added a couple spoonfuls of Parmesan, mixed it together and added about a half tablespoon of freeze dried basil on top. I put the lid on for a few minutes for the pasta to absorb the excess liquid. It was really good!

Followed advice from other reviews, did not add oil when sauté the sausage, and used half and half cream and diced tomatoes.  Turned out great, simple, easy, but so very tasty.

I'm counting calories so I substituted Italian turkey sausage and half and half.  It changes the recipe, but its still excellent and worth the trade off if you need to shave calories.  Saves about 170 calories.

Tasted absolutely great! I used 1 can of chopped tomatoes which was only 400g (1/2 of the stated weight) but this was absolutely fine~ Also had to do some googling for what heavy cream was as couldn’t see it in the supermarket- for any British folk- this is essentially just what we call double cream~ also couldn’t find Italian sausages at my supermarket either so chose some other pork sausages- again the taste was not lacking! Didn’t have fresh parsley on hand either so used 1 tbsp dried parsley instead.

Tasty and a big hit with my kids. I sautéed some diced prosciutto and fresh rosemary with the onions and garlic. I used ground sweet sausage instead of skinned link sausage, which made it quicker and easier to cook.

Good recipe for a quick weeknight dinner. I pretty much followed the directions to a T with the exception of turkey sausage and it was pretty tasty. I love spicy food so I sprinkled on some Trader Joe's smokey habanero when I served.

This recipe sounded great and almost was until I added fat free cream instead of the heavy cream. It separated and ruined the dish. I wouldn't make the dish unless I can reduce the fat and cholesterol so I probably won't make it again.

This is a great base recipe. My version was made with fresh peeled tomatoes, fresh basil, fresh sliced mushrooms, and some additional yummy additions. I wrote do the changes and I will make it, again.

I used turkey sausage and half and half since I already had that around.  Not sure if the cream would have thickened it a lot more, but I felt it was thick enough and really enjoyed it.  I modern the pasta into the sauce and that did help thicken it as explained.  It made a lot of food which is good as I have all teenagers, 2 are boys.  
I will be adding it into the rotation for sure as something new for the teenagers that have had some of the old recipes now for a while.  Ingredient list isn’t real heavy so it isn’t easy to keep the ingredients around and it isn’t quick to prep.

This was really good, quick and easy. I substituted fat free half and half for the heavy cream and used 2 cans of Italian diced tomatoes instead of the can of plum tomatoes. Very hearty, it's only two of us and we both had second helpings plus my husband has two dishes of it for his lunch during the week.

Used half n half instead of the cream but it didn't seem to matter.  This was DELICIOUS!  
Another time I used whole milk but it didn't seem to thicken enough. 
I've also made it with ground beef, and added extra seasoning to make up for the missing sausage flavor (1 T Italian seasoning, plus black pepper, onion powder, and additional salt and garlic, each to taste).  It still turned out well!  Sausage was still my favorite though!

This is a fantastic and flexible recipe. I use Italian sun dried tomatoes in olive oil instead of canned. I dice the sun dried tomatoes and sauté them with the onion, adding the garlic last. We like bold flavors, so I always add a healthy dose of crushed red pepper to mild Italian sausage and use a combination of heavy cream and half and half. I’ve used bow tie and penne for this recipe. Fresh parsley or basil are fantastic and I always stir in a handful of shredded Parmesan into the sauce. Quick, easy and delicious. The whole family loves this.

I added creole seasoning, sage and a bay leaf. I'm from Louisiana so I basically use creole seasoning for almost everything. This recipe is a winner and I will definitely make it again.

Such a simple straight forward recipe and absolutely delicious.  My only changes are I use fresh Roma Tomatos peeled and seeded and added in some more veggies (Red Pepper and Mushrooms).  I could see lots of little tweaks that would switch this up without changing the base of it.    Thank you for a new staple in my repatoire.

Tried this one out when my parents were visiting for a few days. All four of us really enjoyed the recipe! I did not drain the grease, but it wasn’t overly greasy and gave the dish a good flavor. We’ll definitely make this one again!

Loved it.  I used fresh hot red pepper from the garden.  Gave it a little kick but not too spicy.  Granddaughter says she hopes she can make it when "she is big". Lol

I made this dish for the first time for my family and they loved it! I followed the recipe exactly and did the following differently: I drained the sausage of the excess oil before I added the onion and garlic, added chopped up Tuscan kale (which cooks down really well), added fresh chopped Roma tomatoes, 3 tablespoons of tomato paste and added more seasoning to taste. The sauce did thicken up after 10-12 minutes and I kept tasting the sauce until it was perfectly seasoned, then I folded in the pasta. This was pretty easy for my first try and will be my go-to recipe for dinner parties!!

We might make a modified version of this in the future, but it definitely needs some changes (at least for our taste). I cut the red pepper flakes in half, and I think that was about right. Also, even though I mixed in the pasta like I was supposed to, there was still a lot of visible grease, even without adding the extra oil. It didn't feel too greasy in my mouth, but I still think it would be better if the meat was drained (at least a little). I did add some dried oregano and thyme,  but they probably weren't necessary.

This was a yummy recipe. Made a few changes. I used a 12 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes and a 12 oz can of Italian tomatoes. I cooked spicy It sausage ( no red pepper) and while draining on paper towels I cooked 1/2 onion, garlic, 1/2 green pepper, and mushrooms. I used 1 cup of light cream and 1/2  cup of heavy. After you let the cream and meat mixture simmer put the pasta in and turn off the heat. Stirring every once in awhile. The pasta does absorb the sauce. It did have a tint of orange but that is due to the It sausage and tomatoes.  I also used zitis but you can use any pasta. Very yum and will make again. Thanks for sharing!!

We have been making this dish for a long time, but we add mushrooms and Philadelphia cream cheese. When you add the tomatoes, go ahead and add the mushrooms and cook down about 10 or 15 minutes until tender. When you add the cream, we put the cream cheese in as well and stir until the cream cheese melts. It’s amazing!!!!!!! Family favorite for the last 15 years!!!!!

Easy, fast, and delicious! Used spicy ground Italian sausage instead and it turned out wonderfully. The key really is to mix the pasta with the sauce to absorb some of the liquid.

This meal is fantastic!! My husband can’t get enough!! Just don’t panic when the sauce doesn’t thicken as much as you think it should. The pasta soaks it up. Simple concept, delicious result. A new favorite in our house.

I super love love love this recipe, its so easy and simply delicious!  When i want a super light version, i just omit the cream & whisk together over med heat 1/4  cup pasta water with a 1-2 Tablespoons olive oil.  My family likes to grill often in the summer and have found that this recipe is a great way to use up leftover bratwurst.

I had fresh tomatoes that I needed to use up so I put those in with Italian seasoning instead of canned tomatoes. I also drained the omitted putting oil to cook the sausage and drained the grease from the sausage so the dish wasn’t so oily. It tasted great and everyone loved it.

I found this a great jumping off point to help clean out my freezer and refrigerator!  Made with combo of brats and spicy sausage, added artichoke hearts, a bit of left over corn, and whole milk. rather than heavy cream.  Served over zucchini "ZOODLES".  Our international guests were very impressed and had no idea that this tasty dinner was thrown together with ingredients I already had purchased and was in the "use them or lose them" point.  It seemed like a special meal, which indeed, in reality it was!

I always follow the recipe the first time I make it but  when I made this I was missing the plum tomatoes, so I used diced tomatoes with basil and garlic cause that is what I had, other than that I did exactly as it said and it was a hit, the only change I will make next time is less crushed red peppers cause I don't like spicy and with the sausage it already had a good kick to it :)

Delicious to eat and easy to make. This recipe is even better the second night. I made this recipe with spicy Italian sausage instead because I am not a fan of sweet meat.

Really good, I thing the grease definitely needs to be drained out from the sausage, I ignored a review and I paid for it with orange pasta. Other than the grease it was great! I’ll do it again

Soooo yummy!!! Did it a little different. Did not add onions because my boyfriend is allergic so added a little extra garlic. Instead of plum tomatoes we did diced tomatoes. And wanted the vegetable noodles instead of bow ties. But still so yummy

This is one of the most delicious recipes that I have ever made from Allrecipes. The only changes I made was to use one can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning and one of fire roasted tomatoes and to add about a tablespoon of Italian seasoning. Out of this world!

This recipe was really easy and successful! My husband and I tried it out by sticking close to the original recipe. We did add an extra clove of garlic and we used diced Italian Style tomatoes with half and half rather than heavy cream. It was so flavorful and filling. We are officially putting this into our rotation!

Will definitely make again.  Great sauce, but I'd like to add some seasoning.  I used pre-ground Italian sausage, which may have led to it being a bit under-seasoned.  Next time I'll try buying the link sausage and crumbling it, per the recipe, to see if that adds some additional flavor.

I made this dish as written except I omitted the oil. I thought the sausage would be greasy enough, and I was right. I really like this spicy recipe. Next time, however,  I wiil add some chicken bouillion to give a little more favor.  If you are making this for the first time, know that the pasta does soak up the sauce so that it's not as soupy as it first seems.

YUMMY! My family loves this recipe.
I do recommend draining the sausage before adding the cream; less grease. Definitely drain your pasta and then mix it with the sauce. Pouring it onto the pasta doesn't mix it enough. This recipe is very forgiving, you can customize it a bit. I use mild/sweet Italian sausage but have made it with the spicy version too. If I don't have bowtie pasta I'll sub penne. Sometimes I'll add a little more cream or subtract a little cream. No hot pepper flakes. It's all yummy!

This was delicious! I made two minor modifications but neither of them would change things a lot. I used Italian diced tomatoes as others had. I also added just a dash of sugar at the end of cooking the sauce for that slightly sweet flavor that some Italian sauces have. The whole family loved this. Highly recommend it!

This is Great!  Please don’t rate this low if you’ve made it with alterations because you ruined it.  It is super quick, maybe 10 minutes and very good.  It has a slight kick but just enough to let you know it’s there. 
You could def use kielbasa, chicken, shrimp or even ground beef in this.

Made this, it was wonderful.  I was out of heavy cream and garlic so I used milk and garlic powder.  Maybe not as creamy as intended but delicious none the less.  I didn't drain the tomatoes and preferred the more saucy taste.  Will make it again.

This was an extremely flavorful dish that went over very well with my family. I made it as it is written and added the drained noodles to the sauce, as LCAROLINE suggested, so that it was not too runny.  I will definitely make this again!

I've been making this recipe since I saw it on here years ago...I've doubled and tripled the recipe with much success, sharing it with family and friends. I do like to add a bit more heavy cream than written for more creaminess but other than that this is a delicious pasta recipe and I stick with the sweet italian sausage, I've tried it with the spicy and mild but it's not the same. Homemade garlic bread usually accompanies this dish. 
Thank you for sharing this, it is one of my most requested specialities now!

I made this today. The only modifications I made was adding a little beef with the sausage and salt and pepper flakes to taste.  Soooo good!! I did let it simmer for about 30 minutes. I will definitely make this again!!

This was an easy weekday dinner. I followed the directions as written besides including additional seasoning, slicing up 1 bellpepper to add to the mix and using diced tomatoes and not plum.  The sauce was not thick enough for me. I did mix it with the noodles but i felt as if it didnt saturate them enough to give it the flavor it needed, it felt as if it was missing something. I used turkey italian sausage instead of the regular. I sprinkled parm cheese on top while it sat in the serving dish. My 2 year old ate it up with a side of garlic toast and of course thats all that matters!!

Definitely will make it again. Awseome dish. One thing, and I think it's because of my culture or just what I'm used to, but the heavy cream was a bit too rich, maybe consider using a lighter cream.

Family Favorite. This recipe is in a regular rotation at this house. Sometimes we swap out the bowties for cheese tortellini. Also great with a little bit of pepperoni chopped up and added to it. ;)

Yes, mine came out amazing. Probably my best made recipe from this app (I changed nothing, except more garlic). And it really was as simple as it said, also the next morning was even better once the bow ties got more acquainted with the sausage and cream.

This was a really great recipe. The only thing I changed was that I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. My husband is very sensitive to dairy, and i found just the right coconut milk from Target. I know that sounds crazy, but it did not taste like coconut one bit. It all came together perfectly. I saw some reviews on whether or not dumping the sausage fat was a good idea. I chose not to, but that's because I believe all of the flavor comes from all of the fat from the meat. It would have tasted too bland if i tossed the oil.

Instead of milk, I used flour, condensed milk and a little bit of 2% milk. Not sure on proportions, I just went with it.

I have made this several times and it is delicious. Don't know where the "flavorless" comments are coming from.  The red pepper gives it a kick and all the other flavors come together beautifully.  It is easy to prepare on a weeknight.

Also make it without adding cream.  Use a crock pot to slow cook the tomato and sausage.  Other variations--I use fire roasted tomatoes and/or a can of  Rotel to change up the taste.  All come out very good

When I first made and tasted this, I was like… eh. About halfway through the bowl that all started to change. Short story short, I’ve made it three times in nine days now. I highly recommend.

My wife made this pretty much according to the recipe with the exception that she used the canned Italian diced tomatoes, drained, and it's a keeper.  Easy to fix and tasty..especially if you both work and if you are looking for a quick dinner.

This was really good! Followed the recipe exactly! Didn't change anything. I can't stand when people review a recipe after they have made changes. This is a definite keeper!!

I made it exactly as written and it turned out amazing! I did add a little more seasoning such as oregano and salt and pepper but that’s only for my personal taste. My picky eater husband asked for more, and when that happens you know we have a winner!

This is definitely a keeper!   Didn’t have heavy cream, so I used Half & Half and also tossed in some baby Spinach I had on hand.   Delicious!   The only thing I would do is not add the red pepper.   Hubby doesn’t do spice.   I personally liked the extra heat and will add separately for myself in the future.  Will make again

Oh my lord, this is an amazing guilty pasta dish! It cooked as recommended except I added chopped bacon and decreased the cream by 1/2 cup. It is AMAZING! The sausage, the bacon, the cream, the pasta.... ahhhhh!

Love this recipe!  The only change I made was diced tomatoes rather than plum and I used hot Italian sausage   So very good.   The only problem is I have to have a second helping. Oh well. Eat light for a day or two to make up for that transgression, lol.

So very good!!! Made exactly as written with a little extra garlic and hot bulk Italian sausage.  Used 2 cans petite diced tomatoes.  Was so yummy- next time might try adding mushrooms or fresh spinach.

This is absolutely delicious and so simple to make!  Only change I made was to use half and half to keep down the calories...only negative...I love pasta and try not to indulge too often...this is IMPOSSIBLE to say no to.  My whole family loves it.  It has been added to the 'keepers'.  Thank you!

I love this recipe! I discovered this a few years ago and my husband and kids request it regularly! The only thing I add is one can of tomato paste to thicken it up a little bit, but even without that an amazing recipe! My entire family loves it! It’s actually even better as leftovers because all of the flavors blend together as it sits for a little bit. Thanks for adding a great staple to my regular dinners. Simple and delicious!

Delicious, I only had Italian links, so I cut them up small and they were fine.  Also added peas and topped with parmesan cheese for serving.  Next time I'll lessen the red pepper flakes, maybe add broccoli instead of peas.... overall a perfectly easy meal.

Very easy and delicious dish! Want an extra kick? Fry up some bacon with your sausage. It will give the pasta even more flavor.

This is one of my family's all time favorite recipes from allrecipes.  over the years we have modified it a bit as follows.  we use Italian stewed tomatoes diced up with all juice from the cans. Also add 1/2 milk and we only cook the noodles to barely  al dente then combine everything in large skillet cover and simmer till most the liquid is absorbed / evaporated then serve.  Usually 45 minutes, the noodles really absord a ton of flaver like this.

I loved this! I substituted for ground sausage & half way through cooking the sausage I added the onions and added some fresh chopped spinach.  I also drained the grease before adding in the tomatoes and cream. I didn’t use any red pepper bc I didn’t have any on hand. So the dish wasn’t spicy. But my family loves it! I can’t wait to make it again to try it with the red pepper!

I far one of the best pasta recipes I’ve ever made!! My boyfriend and I couldn’t get enough and it’s now one of his favs that I cook!! Followed the recipe almost exactly but we like spicy so I used spicy Italian sausage instead of sweet and it gave it such a wonderful kick. Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe!!!

This was so tasty! And I hate sausage but decided to give it a go for hubby as a change. Yum! I didn’t grind up the sausage into it, just cooked themI also suggest draining / wiping up the excess oil from the sausage left in the pan before using it again. Still tasty

My very picky children enjoyed this recipe!  I omitted the red pepper flakes for their benefit. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise, using sweet Italian turkey sausage. The consistency of the sauce was perfect when I mixed it all together with the pasta. Will definitely make this again!

The whole family(9,7,6 & wiff) enjoyed it. I used Johnsonville sweet 1/2c heavy 1 c half/half. I also drained the grease before adding the onion and garlic. Thank you!

We absolutely love this recipe in my house. I grew up eating traditional Italian pasta dinners on Sunday nights and this has been a nice addition to the rotation. I wouldn't change a thing from the recipe. My only suggestions is to take your time letting the sauce thicken. Sometimes it take longer than the suggested amount of time to get there. Turn the heat down and take your time.

I made this for dinner tonight and I only have one word for it....YUM! With a bit more patience than a couple of the reviewers had, this came out creamy and delicious. The only thing I altered was the red pepper flakes, I omitted those because I made dinner for my Grandmother and she isn't real hip to too much spice. I did however add a small can of mushrooms along with the onions and garlic. All about those B vitamins, lol. But, I was very pleased with the entire outcome. It came out a beautiful pink color, even without draining the grease.  This is being entered into our recipe arsenal, Thank You so much for sharing this!

Simple and amazing! Tip for those who are complaining of too much sauce: undercook the pasta by a couple of minutes, return to pot, add the sauce and continue cooking on low for another 10-20 minutes.  The flavors come together amazingly and the sauce thickens to a wonderful consistency.

Delicious!  I use fresh grape tomatoes and sauté a bunch of kale with the onion and garlic. If I needs additional liquid I just add chicken broth to the desired consistency. My husband loves it and my grown daughters make it for their families.

Pretty good as it stands. I added some zucchini to give it more texture and some oregano and basil to taste. I really like the way the red pepper flakes gave it some zing. Like others, I thought the sauce was a bit watery, but none of the rest of my family cared.

We will definitely make this again! Even my picky eaters ate it! We did feel it was a little spicier than we liked so we plan to half the amount of sausage next time. To cut down on time, I'm going to use petite diced tomatoes instead of dicing my own and see if it tastes the same.

Amazing! Make it at least once a month. It is so simple, fairly cheap, and cleans up easily. The first time I made the recipe as is but I usually now make it with spicy sausage and it's amazing. It is amazing both ways!

Super simple and super delicious! I made it for my husband and I, and loved it! So the next week I had my parents make it for our big family dinner! So good! Definitely good with a side of garlic bread:)

SOO good. Staple in out home.  I make as directed except with the following changes:

-After I cook the sausage, I drain the grease.  

- I slow cook the cream/tomato/sausage mixture until I see it turn a little pink from the tomatoes.  

-When I add the bowties to the sauce/tomato/cream mixture, I turn off the heat, put a lid on and let it sit and soak up the awesomeness for 5-10 min (just be sure not to overcook the bowtie pasta so it guest get mushy- game ender for me!) .  

Sprinkle with  a little parm & fresh parsley.  Crunchy bread..def a calorie buster but oh so worth it!

This was very tasty,  I did make some changes though.  I used fresh tomatoes, because I needed to do something with all my tomatoes from my garden. Which made a lot more work than using canned,  But I'm sure that canned tomatoes would be just as good.  I used less cream but it still tasted creamy, I also didn't have bow tie pasta so I used penne instead.  Everyone enjoyed it. Great with some garlic bread.  Oh! I also snuck some shredded carrots in there from my garden. I was running out of carrot idea's. It actually made the sauce a little sweeter and it also seemed to thicken the sauce a little as well.  And kids didn't even know it was there.

This meal is addictive. I eat second when I'm full. It's so bad. We never have leftovers if we make it. My kids even learned the recipe so they don't have to wait for me to make it.

Nice and flavorful. Will make again. Added garlic and orange diced pepper, onions. Not too visually appealing, but tasted great and easy quick dinner.

I don't know why I haven't rated this already. This dish is my absolute favorite and a regular in my house. But best of all MY HUSBAND AND KIDS WILL EAT IT!!!!! And the kids don't just eat it, they love it! The only slight alteration is that I put the onions in before the sausage so they have more time to soften. Otherwise I follow it exactly. Also, as noted in a comment from the person who created this recipe, allow time at the end to let the sauce soak into the noodle so it is less soupy. Enjoy!

Made this recipe for the first time and my husband and I loved it! Must try! 

For beginners: I suggest watching the video before hand. Definitely very helpful! Although, I didn't watch it until after I was finished lol! Even though I made a few minor errors, due to not paying attention / reading because I was so excited.... it still came out great!

Loved this and so did the family! Very easy to put together, and didn't cost a lot for the ingredients. Is a little spicy from the red pepper flakes, but you can adjust to your liking. Will definitely be making again!

This was amazing! I did make a few changes. I didn't use oil and used ground sausage instead. I also added chopped spinach and baby bella sliced mushrooms. I went with what other comments and used diced Italian tomatoes to save time. It really was delicious!

I made this recipe to use up my sweet Italian Sausage and fresh tomatoes.   I swapped out the Bow Tie pasta, with Whole Wheat Penne.   To the sauce,  I added some chopped green peppers,  about 2 Tbsp thinly sliced Sun Dried Tomatoes, a few olives, and 1.5 cups chopped fresh tomatoes, instead of canned, (just to use these up).    Replacing fresh tomatoes over canned will cut down on Sodium.  

The overall dish was excellent. The sauce was easy to make.   I cut back on the heavy cream, but that was personal preference.  I sprinkled freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top.

If you enjoy this recipe, I think you could make a similar dish using chicken instead of the sausage.

Simple east, delicious! I was surprised how well the cream sauce worked with the sausage because I wouldn't put those two together normally.  I used mild italian link sausage instead of ground but kept to the recipe otherwise. Really good and the whole family loved it.

It's so good, used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and a sprinkling of Italian seasoning mix... it's probably so yummy because it's so unhealthy, but who cares when it's this good

Easy to make and everyone enjoys it. The cream makes the dish heavier, but not overly so. My wife doesn't like cooked tomatoes, so I substituted ragu for the tomatoes. Not as pretty that way, but bags of flavour.

This is absolutely delicious.  I made it for my book club, and everyone wanted the recipe.  

I doubled the recipe, added about 3 Tbsp lightly-dried basil, and mixed it in the large pot I cooked the pasta in. 

I highly recommend browning the sausage in its own fat, with the red pepper flakes, and draining the fat off.  Then, add the olive oil (I used extra-virgin), a few extra red pepper flakes to make up for the ones that get drained off with the fat, and the remaining ingredients per the recipe.  

I made it the night before, mixed the sauce with the pasta, and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  Then, about an hour before serving, I put it in a 350F oven, covered, and heated it until the edges were just  browning.  The pasta was infused with the sauce, and was so yummy!

I made the recipe exactly as the recipe said to. The only thing I added was shredded Parmesan cheese on top at the very end of recipe. Very delicious

This was easy to make and really good! I used mild ground sausage, diced Italian tomatoes, basil, and I added some sauteed mushrooms. I cooked the mixture on high & whisked in a little flour so the sauce would thicken faster. I topped with some dried parsley flakes and shredded parmesan.

I didn't read some of the reviews and poured the sauce over my pasta and it turned out to be a bit runny but regardless it had a great taste and flavor! The red pepper flakes do add a hint of flavor. Delicious!

This was simple to make and super yummy! The only change I made was use canned diced tomatoes instead of having to chop the canned tomatoes -saved me a step. I had no problems with the sauce. This worked very well for me and I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!
**UPDATE: I used crushed tomatoes instead and liked it even more with the crushed tomatoes. This will now be the new way I make this recipe**

Easy and amazing. I used mild Italian sausage that was ground (not in casings), added some diced cherry tomatoes in a few different colors and a small mix of diced red and yellow peppers that I had, and didn't need oil. So good!

HOME RUN!!!!  I get many requests from friends and family to make this dish.  Sometimes have to double it to feed everyone.  I'm not a fan of cooks who feel a need to alter the ingredients, and in this case....DON'T....it's yummy!  OOPS, I did use chopped basil instead of parsley.

This a gourmet dish in no time.  I have made this many times. It is great with shrimp or chicken added. I find it better with spirals. They hold even more of this magnificent sauce.

My Walmart was out of Italian sausage in the roll and the Italian diced tomatoes in the cans. I bought the regular diced tomatoes and country sausage and added a bunch of Italian seasoning. I was out of pepper flakes so I just added a pinch of cayenne pepper. I DID add some oregano also. I cooked it with the bow tie minis. I added the bow ties to the sauce and simmered for 10 minutes to allow the bow ties to absorb some flavor. It was delicious! I had 2nds and will be making this again.

Definitely adding this one to my rotation for meal planning! I followed the recipe pretty closely although I did substitute 1/2 cup of heavy cream with chicken broth for dietary reasons and used chicken sausage because that is what we had on hand. The sauce still thickened up just fine. I did not add the pasta to the sauce because while I made the full recipe, it's just my husband and I eating and we prefer to store leftovers separately. Again, the sauce was plenty thick enough. This dish was so yummy, I had seconds and used a roll to sop up the sauce. I guess now I just need to add another  lap to my evening power walk : ) Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have bow tie pasta, so I replaced it with a different short type. I also added some basil and oregano to add some more flavour. Good taste, would make again.

Easy recipe to tweak to your own taste. I like to bake the sausage links (hot Italian) and slice them and add to the sauce-cuts down on the grease factor. You can add peppers, parm, spinach - whatever you like. Easy quick dinner that everyone likes :)

Everyone loved it. And it was a super fast meal to prepare. Make sure you cook your noodles a little less than normal, and mix the sauce and pasta together before serving. I cooked my noodles the way I normally cook them and they were a little too soft after the liquid in the sauce was absorbed by the hot noodles. I added Parmesan cheese on top. Edible as a left over too.

Made this last night. it was great! A very flavorful, easy recipe. It has been added to our list. 

The only adjustment I made was substituting ground sausage for links to avoid the work of removing the casings. Also, I used dried parsley since I had it on hand. my husband ate seconds and said again and again how good it was. 

I only give 5 when I'm absolutely blown away. For me, this is a 4 1/2 star recipe for ease and flavor.

I loved this recipe. The only changes I made were (1) I kept the juice from the tomatoes, rather than drain them and (2) used 1/2 and 1/2 and (3) added dried basil - as I love basil in my Italian dishes.

We just got done eating this and there wasn't a single complaint (even from my roommate who doesn't like a third of the ingredients that are in this)! I did make a couple of alterations, however. I used Spicy Italian Sausage instead of Sweet because the sweet variety tends to make me nauseated. Since I used the spicy sausage, I omitted the red pepper flakes. I am definitely adding this to the 'Keep' pile. Thanks so much!

Added fresh chopped basil near the end of the simmer, and fresh diced tomatoes as a topping before eating.  Really good.

This is my second time making this dish.  I followed the instructions to the T ,  while also taking the advice from others and draining before adding the cream. It was delicious. The second time, I doubled up on the garlic & onions to intensify the flavor even more. My kiddos are picky eaters and Hubby does not likes to repeat meals, but with this I made a large batch and it was dinner for two nights, and no complaints at all. This has quickly become a family's favorite.

Couldn't find any canned Plum tomatoes so picked up diced with Basil, which ended up being tomato bits in sauce, so there was definitely more of a sauce than the recipes original picture (a full even pinkish coat of sauce) and it didn't really thicken as well, BUT I had absolutely no complaints from my Fiance, he loved it and said don't change a thing, would make it again! Easy and delicious. 
Makes a lot of food! ( we froze about half of it for reheating later on)

This dish was delicious, if I do say so myself! It was easy to prepare and on the table in less than 45 minutes. It was very flavorful and very filling. We added a salad and Italian bread to make the meal complete. I do think that maybe next time I'll add mushrooms.

This recipe is amazing!! Only substitutions made was I used jar sauce instead of tomatos as my kids don't like chunks. My husband kept saying how good it was. It was really creamy and filling. I served fresh baked garlic bread with it. I will def be making this again! Thank you soo much!!

This recipe is fantastic! My husband has requested that I put this into our dinner rotation. I only changed this slightly to meet my husband's picky tastes. I used HOT Italian sausage rather than sweet.  I also added 1/2 cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese at the end and mixed it in. The sauce was great. Not sure why there are so many issues with it. This recipe works best in a cast-iron skillet.  Be warned...IT MAKES A LOT (which I love).

I've made this recipe quite a few times, and I've made a few changes here and there. First, I use mini farfalle, which I like better than the larger size, as they seem to hold the sauce better. I use crushed tomatoes rather than whole peeled tomatoes (although if I have whole tomatoes on hand, I'll crush them very well against the sides of the pan with a wooden spoon while cooking). I drain most of the fat out of my sausage before adding the remaining ingredients, and I use 1 cup of cream rather than 1.5 - the recipe doesn't seem to need more than that, and it keeps the sauce from being too watery. I let it simmer for quite a bit longer than 10 minutes, too - more like 20, to allow the sauce to thicken up nicely. 

If you find it needs a bit more seasoning, add a bit more garlic, maybe a shake of Italian seasoning, and you should be good. This recipe should have a ton of flavor without too many additions, though - the cream and sausage should see to that!

Excellent dish! I used chicken sausage and added additional seasonings to make up for the lack of flavor. Worked out amazing. So glad I read some of the other reviews, I drained the fat, I put in the pasta... perfect!

I made this as written except I omitted the oil completely, relying only on the sausage grease and eased off a bit on the red peppers. It didn't not turn out as the picture, more like a vodka sauce, but the recipe was easy to follow and turned out very tasty. A big hit for my family. Thanks for sharing.

I followed some of the other suggestions and made these changes:
- Substituted the same amount of half & half instead of heavy cream and at the end mixed in a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce
- I used an entire small onion which added more flavor
- The bag of bowtie pasta is more than the recipe calls for, so you'll want to make sure you don't cook away too much of the sauce

This was an easy recipe but giving it this a four star because I changed had to add a little more to make it more flavor full.  I added a Italian seasoning, paprika and tomato boullion to make the color darker, and  1/2 packet of Splenda to cut the acid taste.

This was just plain delicious. My wife does not care for sausage, so I made half of the recipe. Used 1 14oz can of diced tomatoes and added 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Love it. Best news is that it heats up for leftovers without loosing any of the quality. I will be making this again.

I used linguini noodles instead and after I mixed the cooked pasta into the sauce I covered and let it sit for a while and the noodle absorbed all the sauce - delicious! Also added chopped asparagus to the sauce as it was cooking down and served it topped with fresh basil.

Made it with Sweet Italian Turkey Sausage and added a little chopped spinach and for an additional meaty kick I added Shimp (just a 12 oz bag). Hubby and kiddos loved it! Oh and I added a bit more of the Heavy Whipping Cream- just play it by ear as you stir because I used more of the bowtie pasta that the recipe listed. Enjoy making it your own ??

I felt like pasta one night and with the wife working late I was up to bat in the kitchen.  I'm not a very experienced cook but this looked do-able, and it was!  Additionally enjoyable because my two boys helped me prepare and cook it as well.  It turned out spectacular, my wife kept remarking how delicious it was, needless to say not a bite was leftover.  Thanks for this recipe!  BTW, I used Adelle's Italian chicken sausage, made cooking a little easier on me and it's a little healthier.

I made this within the last couple of weeks. It is definitely a new favorite for the family. I made no changes and it was excellent. No you're typical "let's have Italian tonight" recipe.

This was fabulous! I didn't add the hotpepper flakes, as my kids were eating it and used whole canned tomatoes and still delish! I used 1/2 a cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of Half and half and cooked my onion and garlic at the same time as my sausage then drained. It was great! I also added garlic powder, onion powder and basil!

I used a can of petite diced tomatoes and dried parsley, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. The cream sauce was delicious after it had time to thicken onto the pasta. It seemed a bit too thin on its own, but thickened right up once the pasta was added.

I did feel it was a bit lacking in flavor and color, possibly because I had to use dried parsley instead of fresh. I think it could still use something else - perhaps I'll add diced green bell pepper next time.

This was really simple and was great for an easy last minute dinner for me, husband and 2 year old. I added some mushrooms and used very few chillies as my daughter doesn't like spice but it was still tasty and hubby polished off seconds too! Only thing was the sauce was a little thin, I prefer slightly thicker pasta sauces so next time I'll add a little cornflour!

I have been making this recipe for years and it is a family favorite. It's also great for entertaining! I don't drain the tomatoes, just pour in the full can and use more cream, 1 Pint (2 cups). Once the sauce has simmered, add your cooked bow tie noodles and simmer a few minutes before serving. This dish is even better the next day when the sauce is extra creamy. If you use the sweet italian sausage and stewed italian tomatoes, the garlic and onion provide more than enough flavor! Salt and pepper is all that's needed!

This was fairly easy to make however I did make several adjustments to add more flavor.  I used a spicy sausage, cut back the cream to 1 cup, added basil and oregano and some red wine, topped with shredded Mexican cheese.

Made this as is and it was fantastic. I agree it is just a tad spicy, so if you don't like spice you may want to reduce the red pepper flakes. We will definitely make it again.

Made this as written and when I tasted it the sauce was somewhat bland but ok.  Turned it into a vodka sauce, adding 1/4 C and a pinch of dried pepper flakes.  My family loved it with the changes.

I made this with angel hair pasta and milk instead of cream, because I'm snowed in to my house and that's what I had. It still turned out great and I'm sure the original recipe would be just as good. It was pretty easy to put together and my kids liked it so I will definitely make this again.

Love this recipe! It's so easy and tastes superb! I don't modify it in any way. Leftovers were even delicious. I've made it with sweet Italian sausage and chicken sausage, and both are fantastic.

Made this recipe without any changes and it came out perfect! It was creamy and rich without being heavy in the stomach. I was afraid it would be too much sauce for the noodles, but was pleasantly proven wrong. My husband went back for seconds and thirds! Just don't forget to mix the sauce with the pasta very well before serving.

Great recipe. I drained the fat before adding the onions and garlic. I used 2 cans of Alymer brand fire roasted diced tomatoes and added some spinach (bagged) at the end before serving.

I followed the recipe exact  as I dont think people should give reviews if they've changed it.  It was delicious!  There is plenty of flavor and a nice little kick from the red pepper flakes and sausage.  This will be a new regular in our house.

Very simple and tasty recipe.  I added three 14.5 ounce cans of tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano and 2 cups of heavy cream.  I also used the loose sweet Italian sausage which save the step of taking the casings off and cutting it. My family loved it.

This is a wonderful recipe! I made a few changes, I used half and half and diced Italian style tomatoes instead of whole plum. Our whole family LOVED this. I'll be making it again soon.

My husband and I are addicted to this recipe! The only thing I do differently is use 2 packages of smoked sausage or polska kielbasa instead of uncooked sausage. I cut it up and cook it the same way the directions say.

Thank you for this awesome recipe!!

I loved this recipe,  I used minced garlic with Jalapenos and added 3 times the amount of red pepper flakes.  I highly recommend this recipe,  I will be making this one again for sure

This is one of my go-to recipes because my husband LOVES it!!!  It is definitely one of our favorite meals. I usually have to double it in order to have leftovers. He's a muscular guy with a high metabolism and will eat 2-3 bowls at once, then the left overs will be gone with 24 hours.  Love love LOVE this recipe!! It is now written down and saved in my stash of cook books

Very good!  The sausage/tomato/cream combo was awesome - we served it with regular spaghetti and it was just as good.  I added a little basil/oregano/onion salt/garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Excellent recipe and easy.  Thanks!

When I made this recipe for my family, it turned out very well.  One down part to it was that the sauce didn't thicken up as well as I'd have liked it to.  When I make it next I'll see what I could do to thicken it up more.  Overall it was a major hit with the family and will definitely be making it again.  I did change up the tomato for the recipe.  I just bought some diced tomatoes and added some Italian seasoning to them and it tasted just fine and the tomatoes were perfect and already bite size.  We've only got 3 people in our house and we had enough leftovers for at least 4 more servings and one person in the house had seconds.  All servings were hearty to begin with so definitely a great recipe for having leftovers with.

This was amazing. And really easy. My husband ate the leftovers three nights in a row. And he doesn't "do" leftovers. I used Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage instead of Italian sausage. And I used the Italian diced tomatoes as suggested by other reviewers. I will definitely be making this again and again!

I love this recipe!  This dish has just the right amount of kick. It's filling and goes a long way.  The flavors really complement each other.  I made this recipe exactly as written and am basing my review on that.
That being said I made it again with some adjustments to reduce the calories and found it to be just as good.  I substituted whole milk for heavy cream.  I browned the sausage in its own grease without adding olive oil.  Also the sauce didn't thicken quite like I wanted so I added a tbs of flour.  It was delicious!

This is a simple and delicious recipe. I followed other reviews and used Italian spicy diced tomatoes.  I did use mild sausages, however the end result was spicy (due to the pepper flakes.  I also used half and half cream. All in all a new family favourite.

I have made this several times and it is now our favourite meal. It's quite simple but, is as good or better than a restaurant dish. I gave a 4 star rating because I actually have changed it a little, I use Mexican chorizo sausage instead. I also don't use any oil. Along with the onion and garlic, I add mushrooms and green pepper to the pan until caramelized. Just before the cream goes in I add in fresh grape tomatoes cut in half. Throw in the pasta and it's ready. So delicious and only two pans to clean. Great heated up for lunch the next day.

This came out so good. As with all recipes I use it as a base and customize it to my family's likings. However with this one I didn't have to do much at all.  I added fennel and a pinch of Italian seasoning in with the Italian sausage, onion and garlic just to give it a little extra kick. My family really loved it and I will definitely have to make it again but doubling the recipe because it went so fast!

I have made this recipe a million times so I thought I should at least write a review.  I use this recipe as is most of the time.  I've substituted with whatever pasta I've had a few times. It is a HUGE hit with my family.  The kids jump up and down every time. It's fast and delicious and perfect!!!

I made a couple of changes because like others, I felt this was a little bland when I tasted it. I ended up adding a little bit of Italian seasoning and also some Parmesan cheese, which also helped to thicken it. Once the pasta was added to the sauce, it did not seem thin, so I guess that is the key. I also left out the red pepper flakes, as my family doesn't like anything hot or spicy. It was delicious with the changes.

Really enjoyed this recipe, I used grape tomatoes and added a precooked chicken Italian sausage at the end just before the cream. The sauce was so good that I think next time I will leave out the sausage all together. I ate the leftovers for lunch the next day and it just wasn't the same, all of the sauce absorbed into the pasta so next time I will only make what I plan on eating.

I loved it and the wife loved it. I didn't drain the grease either, as one reviewer pointed out but even so I didn't find it greasy. Very flavorful and just the right amount of kick with the pepper. It's not a complaint but this makes quite a lot. Probably should cut the recipe in half if you are not feeding more than 2-3 people.

this was very yummy.  I questioned enough flavor in the original recipe and added some dried rosemary and 4 basil leaves sliced.  I also doubled the amount of meat and added sautéed yellow squash and zucchini.    my husband isn't a very big eater but went back for seconds.

This recipe was a WIN!!! My fiancé is the worst picky eater ever (kinda like having a child) he complained the entire time I was making this meal, he said it has every ingredient he HATES. He hate spinach, he hates tomatoes, he hates onions, he hates sausage (you get it?) anyway, he tried it ... He LOVED it! He smirked because he knew I won haha! He even went back for seconds!!!

This was quite bland and not saucy enough.  Not one I will make again.

I've made this several times now. The last time, I substituted half and half for the cream. It turned out just as delicious while cutting some calories!

I pretty much follow the recipe but instead of parsley, I use basil. I just like it better. Sometimes I will substitute diced tomatoes if I don't have the plum tomatoes on hand but I prefer the plum. This recipe is a family favorite! What I love most about this dish is the sauce is light and creamy...not a heavy tomato sauce.

This was incredibly delicious! I've never cooked with sausage, and I can't believe what I have been missing out on. My family loved it and I will definitely make it again. Thank you!

I did nothing but substitute,  but since it's still 5 stars,  I'll rate it.  I usually have cream but was out so I substituted a can of evaporated milk.  I had regular petite diced tomatoes,  so I used them.  Since I've never bought seasoned canned tomatoes,  I don't know what they taste like,  so I guessed and added 1 t each basil and oregano.  I cooked the Italian sausages on the grill to get that browned flavor,  and chopped them fairly small after they cooled.  Did not peel the sausage and if I was going to peel Italian sausages,  I'd just buy it without the casing anyway.   Super flavorful and delicious.

This was really good! I followed the recipe exactly except I used regular diced tomatoes and half & half just because that's what I had in and it turned out great. The Italian sausage I used had quite a bit of herbs & spices in it which I think is where most of the flavor of the dish came from, in regards to the reviewer who thought it was bland. I patted the cooked sausage with paper towel and then continued with a fresh pan to try to eliminate a lot of that orangey grease. I had no problem with the sauce thickening. I cooked it over medium heat for maybe ten minutes or so. I will definitely make this again.

I don't really cook, so I had no idea what to expect. (I actually used Campanelle because I confused it for Bowtie...) When I added the heavy cream it looked absolutely disgusting and I thought I ruined it. After simmering and adding the pasta in, it looked beautiful. It tasted beautiful too.

This recipe tasted good, and my family really enjoyed it, but the sauce was really thin.  Like some of the comments said, I used diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes to save the effort of cutting up the tomatoes.  However, I was afraid to drain the juice off because, unlike for canned whole tomatoes, the juice was thick and tomato-y.  The problem was, I think this made the sauce to thin.  Other than the disappointment of having the sauce drain to the bottom of the pan, which was not the recipe's fault, this was great!

This was one of the better sauce recipes I've used on AR. It did come out a little runny, not sure if that was due to not draining the meat, but I added 6 tbsp of flour and 3/4 cup of water and it was good to go! I'm not sure what that person was talking about in reference to the color because all tomato cream sauces are orange.

Made is exactly as is. Didn't love the sausage with it. Maybe next time I'll use something different. Like spicy sausage. I feel like I could change up a few things but all in all this isn't something I would make often. Actually kids. Kids would probably really like this.

Quite delicious. To reduce fat/calories, I substituted hot Italian turkey sausage for the sausage. Also, there's no need for two tablespoons of oil to brown the sausage in. You can get by w 1/4 of that amount. I also used some half-and-half in place of all the cream.

I loved this!! The hubby wasn't overly excited to try it as the cream and pasta seemed to offend his sense of good combos but then he went back for seconds lol. 
I was out of onions, shock horror, so I subbed some green bell pepper. Was just fine.
Am going to make this often! Thanks for the dancing tastebuds :-)

I've made this several times now and gotten nothing but rave reviews.  The only changes I made was to add a little bit of Italian seasoning. Each time I've made it I tweaked the size the sausage was broken down leaving it a little bigger for a better bite. Other than that I really enjoyed the flavor especially the cream. But honestly I would enjoy an old shoe if it was covered in cream!  
Thanks

Taste amazing. Used ground Italian sausage so I didn't have to take it out of the casing. I also had to thicken the sauce using 2 tablespoons of corn starch. But the end result was awesome!

I really enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe except that I used petite diced tomatoes (no flavor) instead of plum tomato, and added some italian seasoning.  Next time I would get the spicy sausage instead. Even though I added red pepper, it wasn't the same.  Wish I could give it 4.5 stars

My husband had seconds and made his own lunch with leftovers :) Definite winner! I did modify based upon reviews and what  I had available. I used one small can fire roasted garlic tomatoes  and one can Italian seasoned tomatoes , and one fresh tomato that I cooked in with the onion, garlic, and I added a bell pepper at the same time.  I also used a bit of cream cheese and milk instead of cream. It was so wonderful, thanks for the recipe.

It's become a family favorite so I make it at least once a month.  The recipe is perfect as is,  but I like to add a little ground fennel seed to enhance the sweet sausage flavor.  Make sure you let it simmer all together for the full amount of time to blend the flavors.  So good!

This is one of my favorite recipes to make.  Of course like everyone does, I’ve changed it a little bit, based on my families tastes and what I had the first time I made it.  I use tomato sauce (picky husband doesn’t like tomato chunks).  The first time I made it I used all sausage, but we both agreed it was to “sausagey”, so now I use 3 sweet Italian sausages crumbled, and half a lb ground beef.  We don’t like spicy food so I skipped the pepper flakes, and instead gave it flavor use a package of sazon and some adobo.  It comes out remarkable!

I made a few substitutions . . . used fresh cherry tomatoes and halved them instead of the canned tomatoes.  I also substituted polish sausage (since it was on sale and much cheaper) for the Italian sausage called for in the recipe and just added some Italian spices to add flavor.  Overall this was easy and my family loved it.  I'm adding this to my favorites.

My husband and I loved this! Despite the fact I have to use gluten free noodles it was awesome.  A little parmesan on top delicious :)

Every time I make this everyone raves about it.  I use a can of petite diced tomatoes, Italian style instead.  I also use a little more cream because I like it saucy.   I mix my bowties in with the sauces and add some grated Parmesan.  AMAZING!!!

I did not change a thing. Made exactly as stated and it was delicious. Even my picky husband liked it. Very easy to make and will definitely do it again. Was glad I had some left to take for lunch the next day!

Love this recipe! My picky son says it's one of his faves to eat. I've made it with sweet, mild, and spicy sausage (not a fan of sweet in my food). Have made it with cream, evap. milk, and, more recently when I needed dairy free, coconut milk. Canned or fresh tomatoes. Always delicious. You have to get good sausage as that's where a lot of the flavor comes from.

So tasty and easy to make! Subbed in margarine and milk instead of heavy cream and it still came out great. Also subbed in angel hair pasta lol.

Use Italian diced tomatoes. Otherwise perfect. Smells great when cooking. Taste like it came from an Italian restaurant.

Absolutely delicious.  Made this for dinner a few nights ago.  So, so, good.  My 4 year old ate it, too.  We  are even devouring the leftovers days later.  They are still so good.  We did not have bow-tie pasta on hand so we used tricolor rotini.  Also did not have sweet Italian sausage so we dressed up the regular ground sausage we had with Italian spices.  We didn't have parsley either, so we omitted that step at the end.  We would make this a thousand times over.  So delicious.

The family loved it - even picky eaters had seconds!  I used 2 cans of diced Italian tomatoes and added a little butter & grated Parm to pasta (mini bow ties).  Topped it w/ dried parsley because I didn't have fresh.  It turned out great, maybe a little spicy, but we loved the kick - will make again for sure!

My husband and I loved this dish. Only changes I made were I used a can of Crushed tomatoes (not whole) and I used pasta I had on hand-penne. Other than that, stuck to recipe. Will make again.

Very nice recipe with great flavour. I did add cherry Tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach closer to the end as an extra( totally not needed though) and used chopped green onion to garnish as I didn't have parsley. What a hit!

I added a tablespoon of Italian seasonings to the sausage mixture before adding the bow tie pasta back in. Also, I used half and half because I was out of regular cream.  At the very end I added about 3 tablespoons of Parmesan grated and let that kind of Melt in.  Also as an added tip remember to stop your pasta from cooking any further by rinsing it in cold water before adding the pasta into the sauce mixture. I served with heavy tomato cucumber with a slight bit lettuce salad mix with a light Italian dressing.  Yummy!

My whole family loves this recipe. I love it because it's so easy for a weeknight dinner. Add salad and breadsticks and you have a great meal. Only change was instead of Italian plum tomatoes I use 2 - 14 oz. cans of Hunt's diced tomato with basil and oregano. Oh and also sprinkle fresh grated parmesan cheese over the top. YUM!!

Outstanding! I loved the tomatoes as is, I didn't use the diced tomatoes. I might try that next time. But I did add spinach for flavor and extra nutrition. And I didn't skimp on the heavy cream. I feel like it gave it depth that can't be compared. I also didn't skimp on the garlic... don't believe there is such a thing as too much lol. Some Italian bread and red wine... perfecto :-)

This was quite good and got high marks with the hubby.  I used half and half in lieu of the cream to make it slightly lighter.  The creamy sauce was excellent..  I cut the recipe in half for just the two of us and had enough for a lunch during the week.

This recipe is fantastic, my family loved it!  I added some fresh chopped basil which really added even more kick.  The sauce thickened perfectly.  I simmered the cream sauce for about 15-20 and added the pasta, simmering again for another 5 minutes which really fused the flavors together nicely.  To the submitter: Thank you for posting this gem of a dish!

I made it pretty much according to recipe, and it was very delicious and easy to make. The only change I would make is a personal one - it was a tiny bit too 'hot' for my family, so next time I will either decrease the red pepper flakes or cut them entirely. (I also could not find plain italian tomatoes, so I instead used italian stewed tomatoes, so there wasn't as much draining possible. It did not seem to thin out the sauce at all.)

I am not a skilled cook in the slightest, but I made this and seriously impressed my boyfriend who has lost almost all faith in my cooking ability. 

Only used 1 cup of heavy cream and I added mushrooms, it was a hit.

This is amazing! I didn't have bow ties but the beauty of this recipe is most any pasta can be used, so I used fettuccine. I used Italian turkey sausage to make it healthier. This is delicious!

I've made this recipe several times, always omitting the sausage and adding frozen (sometimes fresh) spinach. I also use two cans of Italian style tomatoes. Even without the meat, it makes an amazing vegetarian meal with tons of flavor! Hubby always eats the leftovers before I can get to them, and my 2-year-old can't seem to get enough!

Great recipe. I used some cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit. I'd also perhaps blend half the tomatoes next time to make the sauce richer and less chunky. I made a double batch and no leftovers after tonight's dinner party. Will use again!

I make something very similar.  But use the tomatoes with basil and garlic or oregano and garlic for flavor.   The fire roasted ones are very good also.   Just before serving I wilt a bit of chopped baby spinach in the "sauce" mixture.  Fantastic recipe.

This is my go-to, mid-week dinner that always gets rave reviews from the family. I don't change a thing, except maybe dried parsley instead of fresh if I'm out, and it always turns out perfect.  Probably not the healthiest with the cream but we can't  always eat salads!!

Thanks for a great recipe.

Kind of bland, but with some pepper, heavier on garlic, and a sprinkle of parmesan it's really good. I made mine with chorizo, as it was the only sausage I had on hand, and added peas because I love peas. Also omitted the hot peppers because I'm eating this with my little kids. Altogether really good and with my modifications, will make it again. Looks really pretty with tri-color pasta too.

My family loves this meal.  Easy and quick to make.  I also added sweet peppers to the sausages while cooking.  Amazing!  If you're not a fan of spicy, I recommend you not add or lessen the amount of crushed peppers.

Easy and delicious! Always a crowd pleaser! I've made substitutions over the last couple of years. I use mild Italian turkey sausage, 1 cup heavy whipping cream (worth the calories but less than recipe calls for), fire roasted tomatoes, and basil instead of parsley. These minor changes add a spicier taste rather than sweet. I follow the recipe otherwise.

Hubby and I liked this a lot. It was pretty simple to make. I would make sure you have enough sausage. I also added a little bit more seasoning (more salt and a little italian seasoning) but it's a great base recipe. Doesn't take long. I'm going to try to use diced tomatoes next time too per others' reviews.

yeah, I made this. it was awesome. I always use Cavatappi pasta, it's big and hearty, along with chicken Italian sausage. This helped with grease, fat and ease. I also used half n half, with a can of fire roasted tomatoes. This kids loved it, so did the fella. I  a HUGE fan of 1 pot cookin' so this will go on the top of my list for pasta.

My family loves this pasta. I have to omit the pepper flakes as I have young children with zero tolerance for spice, but it's still delicious. I just sprinkle the flakes on my portion! I do drain the grease from the Italian sausage prior to adding the onion & garlic.

I made the a few changes and used some Italian type diced tomatoes and used half and half instead of heavy cream. It was actually super good. Everyone loved it and my kids even took seconds. I did not use the red pepper flakes because my daughter does not like spicy food. But over all I am adding it to my list of dinners for my family!

I bought house made Italian sausage from a butcher  which I ended up HATING.  It ruined the dish for me.  I literally could only eat two bites.  But I will make this again with a different  sausage or maybe even chicken.  And then review it again.  Just be careful in your choice of sausage.

My family loves this recipe.  I gave it only 4 stars because I think to get to the 5 it takes additional spices.  We add fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, and extra garlic.  So good!

I have made this a couple of times now, and my family absolutely loves it!  Definitely  make sure to add the pasta to the sauce  so that the pasta can absorb the sauce.  Fabulous  recipe!

This recipe is very bland. Grill the sausage first to extract the fat. Add some tomato puree, Italian herbs, tamarind extract or beef stock along with salt and black pepper.  Needs some cheese somewhere too. Then it's a bit better.

Delicious and so easy!

I don't like Italian sausage so I just used regular Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage in the roll. I did not have cream and used Morning Moo (delicious dried milk/whey product) concentrated, and some 1% milk with 2 tsp cornstarch. Had some fresh spinach I needed to use up, so chopped up a couple of cups and threw in the last few minutes before adding cream/milk product. Really delicious. Why some said it lacked flavor, I don't understand. You do need to add some salt and a small dash of red pepper flakes gives it a just right amount of pow.
I think this would be wonderful with dinner sausage also. In fact my kids asked me to try it again using dinner sausage.
Update: I took the last serving for lunch two days later...this keeps great and tastes almost better a day or two later!

This was fantastic.   Made it as written, but on my plate, I added a little parmesan cheese.  It was just as good w/o it, though.

Just made this tonight and loved it (with our mods). We used ground sweet Italian sausage, less red pepper flakes, a little more garlic, and less olive oil (since the sausage has enough grease). We both had second helpings, and can't wait for lunch tomorrow! Thanks for sharing!

I first made this recipe probably about 5-6 years ago and have repeated it many, many times over the years.  It's incredibly delicious and the recipe is perfect.  Having good italian sausage is key, however. If you have bland sausage, you're going to have a bland dish as the outcome.  I do usually add pepper and oregano or italian seasoning, because I feel it's an italian dish and I love those seasonings in italian.  This is a wonderful recipe and requested often by the husband.  Yum!

I made this with one addition. I put a couple handfuls of baby spinach in it right before the cream. I make another sausage pasta close to this recipe and enjoy the spinach in it. I also topped off with Romano cheese for that extra bit of flavor. Absolutely DELISH! Thank you for sharing recipe!

I love this dish. It is easy to make and delicious!!!! I used 1C of heavy cream the second and third time I made this dish, I prefer the slightly lighter version. Even great the next day as leftovers with a side salad. This is a go to recipe in my kitchen.

This is my very first review, but probably the 5th time I've made this recipe. I primarily followed all the directions, however, I did add spinach and was a little more generous with the heavy cream, yet less so with the tomatoes given my daughter doesn't care for them. The dish is fantastic with or without any changes and this has been a meal my picky family looks forward to. Add a Pilsbury French Loaf & a salad and the meal tastes better than a lot of Italian restaurants! Yummy! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this with Barilla Mini-Farfalle (bow tie pasta) instead of the larger ones and pretty much followed the rest of the recipe as written.  My daughter and her family who were living with us loved it and she asked for the recipe.  My husband complained that it was too spicy (I used the 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes the recipe called for).  However, he ate three helpings so I think he really liked it too.

Made it exactly as recipe is written. Was worried about the grease from the sausage, but it mixed well with the heavy cream. Very tasty and I will be adding this to my favorites! It definitely didn't look the same as the picture on here but delish nonetheless. My husband added some parmesan and loved it! The tomatoes were my favorite part! Thank you for sharing!!

This recipe was SO good! I ended up using spicy Italian sausage instead of sweet. I also used diced canned tomatoes as per the suggestion of other reviewers, then added some Italian seasoning. Topped with a bit of parmesan cheese. It was spicy and creamy and delicious. Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing.

Loved it as is. The sauce is always perfect, never any leftovers, as the kids polish every last drop off.  Also a quick, easy, and economical meal for all us working parents.

Thanks!!

This was great! I added mushrooms, spinach and white wine. I also used shallots instead of onions. I opted for fresh tomatoes instead of canned.

I've been making this exact recipe for about 20 years, since my Mom gave it to me from one of her cookbooks.  It's a great family dinner and works well for potlucks, too.  Sometimes we'll add some mushrooms to it to give it a little more flavor.

This was super tasty!  To make it even easier, I found already cooked and sliced Italian sausage in the freezer section at the grocery store. I will definitely be making this often!

Last night I made this for the first time.  The only change I made to the recipe was I added half of a green pepper diced.  Like others I also used a can of Italian diced tomatoes.  My wife and I loved it.  This will definitely be made again.

This one is a keeper! DELICIOUS! Surprisingly it did have a little kick to it. My 3-year-old daughter spit out her first bite, but I told her to just drink her milk! It will be okay, and she cleaned her plate! However, we all agreed that there was a little something missing. Next time I will add a few more spices and see how that turns out. Also, I think next time I will use Italian sausage links instead of ground and chop them.

Update: I've made this about 20 times now! We can't get enough of it. My hubby added 1 1/2 tsp each of dry basil and parsley. That's what was missing! We also use SanMarzano tomatoes (PRODUCT OF ITALY, NOT THE AMERICAN BRAND!)

I used hot Italian sausage so I skipped the red pepper.  The flavor is fantastic,  though!  It's definitely going to be a keeper in my home,  and I think I'll try adding some grated parmesan to the sauce next time.  Can't wait to make it again.

This was delicious! I used ground sausage and diced tomatoes (laziness) and the results were easy and it tasted fantastic. At first I thought the sauce would be too thin since it didn't thicken much after 10 min of simmering but once I added the noodles the consistency was perfect. Great recipe.

Yum! 
I skipped the hot pepper flakes because I didn't have any and I added cayenne pepper instead. I think it would be good with mushrooms.

I thought this recipe was going to be just "OK".... But was I completely wrong!!! I will definitely be making this again. The sauce came out a little thin (I'm sure it was an error on my part) but I just thickened it with cornstarch.

This is really good and really easy! I made slight changes based on other reviews. Added Italian seasoning & some marjoram. Used less cream (and, not following instructions, added some of the drained juice from the tomatoes -shouldn't have  - made it a little soupy.)
I used 1 link hot sausage & 1 link sweet (about 3/4lb total) so I added less pepper flakes & less pasta, but full amount of tomatoes.  I'd be ok with the full amount of pepper flakes next time even with the hot sausage, because we like a bit of heat. Will definitely make again and can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I've made this 4 or 5 times now and it's excellent. Suggested changes would be less oil at the start and adjust the amount of crushed pepper flakes if desired. There is plenty of heat in it "as written". I like it but my wife prefers less spice.

Love this recipe! I'm lazy, so I just buy ground mild italian sausage meat and a can of diced Italian style tomatoes to save some prep work. My boyfriend loves when I make this, and it was a huge hit with my family when I was home for the holidays. Definitely one of my favourite recipes! :)

I used hot Italian sausage and it was good and flavorful. I added 1 tbsp of flour to the cream to help thicken the sauce a little bit. I thought it was delicious .

Easy to make for someone still learning to cook and wants a little challenge. Tasted excellent! Both myself and my girlfriend agreed that we would order this at a restaurant.

This is very similar to an old recipe from Bon Appetit, which is delicious. The only difference is the  BA recipe  only uses 1/2 cup of cream, in stead of 1-1/2 cups, which is plenty! Pasta water, rather than more cream, is used to make the dish "saucy."  For those of you concerned with the fat, try using the lesser amount of cream + pasta water.

I love this recipe. The proportions are just right. I cooked with hot Italian sausage because we like our food on the hotter side. Delicious!

Great recipe! It has a lot of flavor without spending a ton of time making it. Cooking the cream for a little bit longer helps it reduce and thicken and coats the pasta. I added parmesan cheese at the end and it was wonderful. I don't think the 1/2 teaspoon of salt is necessary because of the sausage is often salty. Try this one -- you will love it.

Best recipe I've gotten from this side.  I did it exactly as the recipe call for just did no add the oil since the sausages produces enough. I used mild sausages since we like a litle spice. I have to make it every weekend.

Delicious and so easy to make! Only changes I made: served over penne, I used diced tomatoes instead of whole, and I used pre-cooked Italian sausage that I chopped into pieces. I cooked everything exactly as called for in the recipe. Definitely will be making this again.

LOVED this dish. My young girls even loved it, but I omitted the red pepper flakes for them. I tried it with mild sausage and a table cream (as that was all the store had at the time) and it was "okay" but it's an AMAZING dish if you stick to the recipe as is with the sweet sausage.....AND Definitely the heavy cream!!!!

Made this tonight, it was a hit! Both myself and my husband loved it!  I used diced tomatoes with Italian spices instead of plum tomatoes, and added a tad more red pepper flakes.  Other than that, followed the recipe as stated....easy and delicious!

This was very delicious!  My husband (who is picky) liked it too.  The only change I made was I only used half of the bow tie pasta.  We like more sauce than pasta.  This made four servings for us.

This stuff is fantastic.  I used spicy italian sausage instead of the sweet that is in the recipe and it turned out great.  Parmesan cheese also works well on top.

OMG, to die for! I didn't have diced tomatoes in the house so used 2 jars traditional flavor pasta sauce instead (I doubled the recipe). Everything else was kept the same. Everyone loved it and asked for me to make it again real soon. So simple too.

I love this recipe, its perfect for an easy mid-week meal and there are plenty of leftovers! I make it as written and its great. Like the author says, don't pour the sauce over the pasta- mix it all together. Its even better the next day!

Cream, pasta, plum tomatoes, and sweet Italian sausage. What's not to like? I think next time I make it though I will use fresh plum tomatoes instead of canned as I found the sauce a little watery for my taste. But if I didn't have fresh on hand, I'd probably just drain a bit of the liquid and use canned again.

It's kind of like "hamburger helper" but tastes a lot better and obviously better for you. I halved the recipe which was enough for 3 adults and 1 toddler. I used one can of diced tomatoes seasoned with garlic and olive oil, and I used dried parsley and dried basil. I added pepper. After letting the cream simmer for 10 mins, I added the noodles and let it simmer again for 10 mins and the sauce was perfectly coating the noodles. Thank you!

Made this on Saturday for Sunday Dinner.  Made it exactly as written and it was the best pasta dish ever!  I'm not a sausage lover, but this was fantastic.  Took some to my parents for lunch and they requested that I bring it for Thanksgiving dinner.  Hubby also loved it.  Will definitely go into the rotation.

Very good.  My son wouldn't touch it & kept making faces so I was happy to eat his small bowl.  Very good comfort food for a cold day.  I used 1 14oz can of diced tomatoes and about 14 grape tomatoes (from my garden to get them off my window sill).  Good flavor & pretty to look at.  Will make again.  Thanks for submitting.

We lovingly call it "Italian Goulash", comfort food.  Made it non-dairy by using 1 cup of plain almond milk with 1/4 cup cool water thickened with cornstarch and stirred into almond milk then into pan. Left out pepper flakes and used chicken sweet Italian sausage. Also used diced tomatoes. Next time will add 1/4-1/2 tsp Italian Seasoning, too.

I had a pack of sweet sausage in my freezer and Googled for a recipe to make with it and came across this.  It was very simple and fast to make and it tastes great.

Delicious and so easy to make. Went a little heavier on the red pepper flakes and used turkey sausage.  Also-- be sure to have some Parmesan cheese and a baguette on hand-- makes all the difference.  We did include the parsley but would have been just as satisfied without, or maybe with some fresh basil leaves instead.  Definitely plan on adding some spinach and/or mushrooms to the mix next time.

I have made this several times because I had a fair amount of spicy roll sausage stored up.  I don't use italian tomatoes, I use plain kind, there seems to be enough flavoring from the sausage.  I do use only 1 cup (pint) of cream only because I don't want to buy a larger amount and it seems to come out nicely.  I would think the sauce would be much thinner with the regular amount.  It doesn't seem to simmer down much to me.  But I've thought it very tasty everytime.  OH! I don't add the red pepper flakes either, the sausage is spicy enough!

I didn't add sausage and altered the recipe a bit! It was divine! I don't like chunky tomatoes in my sauce so once I finished, I blended it and then cooked another onion and some mushrooms and added it to the sauce to have with the pasta. Definitely going to make this again

Gave this recipe a try last night. I stayed mostly true to the recipe, but just omitted the red pepper flakes because I had a guest that didn't enjoy spicy food. Instead I added a little black pepper & a bit of oregano. Great, quick family meal.

Made it just as recipe ordered. Noted it smelled like beef stroganoff at the end, realized, I hate beef stroganoff. Tasted it - tasted great! Ignored my nose. Ate leftovers twice. Yum. SO liked too. Great use of italian sausage! Oh, used minced onion instead of chopped. So I did change the recipe... :p

This recipe was very simple, quick & very good! I added spinach in it because we love spinach & to give the dish some color. I added the fresh parsley, crushed pepper flakes & Parmesan when I plated my dish because my roommates daughter & niece doesn't like it all fancy like we do! ?? I will definitely be making this dish again!

Amanda P...I never drain grease. Just add flour to soak up grease (aka flavor) hehe and add cream kind of like you're making gravy. I used spicy sausage and extra red pepper. I topped with freshly grated smoked Gouda. Yummmmmm

I am not a cook whatsoever and this dish was amazing for a first time cooker. Granted the only issue I had was not knowing heavy cream is whipping cream. After it was done my boyfriend and I enjoyed every bite. Was so delicious!!! Def will have to make it again, and also, stir the sausage in with pasta after its finished thickening. Makes the pasta taste way better.

Only changes I made were: 1) Used hot italian sausage (I like it better), 2) I didn't have bow tie pasta so I used vegetable penne pasta (all I had), 3) used a can of diced tomatoes (flavored with basil, garlic and oregano). I will probably make this again, but may use a little less cream? Maybe a little less sausage, or else I'd like to up the amount of tomatoes in it (maybe dice my own roma tomatoes) - I'd like the ratio of sausage to tomatoes to be a little more equal. It had plenty of flavor to me, but that may be because of some of my substitutions. I did not need to drain the grease before adding the cream, as there wasn't hardly any grease there. Liked it, thanks for the recipe!

Easy family dinner, I had no problems with the sauce.  Working with creams and the butter that goes along with most cream sauces can make the dish pretty greasy so use your culinary knowledge to avoid as much grease as you can.  We do prefer a bit of spice so I used spicy Italian sausage.  Served with soft Italian bread and sliced fresh zucchini.  Will be making again!

It wasn't bad on the first few bites, but the more I ate the more I didn't like it. It wasn't very flavorful, and the mix of ingredients became greasy as I ate. The leftovers had to be thrown out because the mixture didn't reheat well at all.

I made this recipe for the first time a few nights ago, my boyfriend liked it so much he has asked for it every night since until I finally caved and made it again (we went a whopping four days). I added extra onions, garlic, cream(substituted half and half), and tomatoes to get extra servings without doubling the recipe. Five stars for simplicity and BIG flavor, this will be a new regular dish around here. Served with fresh ciabatta rolls, reheats great with a dash of cream. Thanks!

Loved this recipe!! My sauce was perfect and I used rigatoni instead of bow tie pasta, I added a little Parmesan cheese to top it off and some garlic bread. Both daughter and hubby loved it.

My husband begs me to make this weekly! So much so he started making it himself. The only change we made was using a couple tablespoons of tomato paste instead of actual tomatoes.

I've made this recipe 4 times now and my family loves it; to where everyone seems to be home for dinner when I make it. I've tweaked it a little by adding 3 tables spoons of fresh basil to the sauce along with the parsley. Just such a warm inviting dinner, real comfort food. Cheers!

One of my go-to recipes for a while now! It even got me adding a bit of cream to most tomato sauce based recipes I use because the taste was great.

Love this combination but to get around the greasiness in the Italian sausage I simmer for about 5 mins. , drain and then cut up.   Also after I brown them I blot them very well with paper towels.   Hope this helps someone else otherwise no problems with this recipe except eating too much!!!!!

Oh wow!  This was so incredibly good!  I forgot to use the olive oil and decided that I didn't need it with the oil from the sausage.  I just used a tube of Jimmy Dean Italian sausage and used two cans of diced Italian style tomatoes.  The sauce was not thin at all, and I'm not sure why some thought it was bland.  It was so perfect.  Everyone in my family loved it.  I'll definitely add this to our regular dinner rotation.

I've made this recipe about 5 times and every time it's a major hit! I add a bit of Parmesan cheese to finish it off and my family can't get enough! I recommend adding garlic if you have it. This would be an awesome dish for company, but my favorite part of this recipe is how cheap and easy it is! This is quickly becoming a regular on the dinner rotation. Note: I've also reduced the fat and calories by reducing the oil by half and using half and half instead of cream, without sacrifing flavor.

I've made this many times. Both following the recipe and making changes. It's wonderful! For example tonight I didn't have plum tomatoes so I used regular diced tomatoes. I didn't have heavy cream so I used half-and-half and I didn't have link sausage so I used bulk Sage Tennessee Pride. It was still wonderful and unbelievably quick and easy. One of my all-time favorites!

I am sorry to say this recipe was not for us. Followed the recipe completely to a tee, it was not a hard recipe to make. It really lacked flavor we found it very bland. We did eat it, sorry to say I will not be making this again. I have found a ton of good recipes on this site, unfortunately for us, this isn't one of them.

Very good and very easy. No leftovers, everyone loved it. 
I only had some caramelized onions, so I used those and thru in some all seasons salt with a little bit of cayenne for spice. I did not use the red pepper flakes. It was really really good, lots of flavor. I only used about 1 cup of cream instead of the 1.5. Worked great. Will be making again!

I made the recipe exactly as written (minus red pepper flakes as I couldn't find them)  and it was outstanding! Absolutely delicious! The cream really adds a different dimension to the flavors and it all the ingredients come together perfectly! My husband and I ate some for dinner and couldn't wait to eat the leftovers for breakfast :-)

Really good. I used about half as much sausage to keep calories down, but it is still quite flavorful. As the OP stated, once you mix in your pasta, it isn't runny at all. As for draining, maybe I would with some brands of sausage, but mine was pretty lean, and I'm used to cooking with olive oil.

The family loves this. We've made it several times.  My changes include using a little less of the red pepper flakes, using one regular sized can of diced tomatoes, italian style (because my family members are not big fans of tomatoes) adding some chopped red pepper as well as lots of chopped spinach.  It has become a new family favorite and a go to because it's so quick and easy.

Awesome! Super simple, easy ingredients and still had a kickin flavor. Minus the plum I used two cans (14.5 oz )of Dole's basil, garlic, tomatoes. Added a little complete seasoning over the meat while cooking. Too each his own! LOVED IT!

Just made this tonight and it was sooo delicious!  We used mild italian sausage links because we don't like ground sausage in pasta.  I upped the onion a bit too because we love onions.  I also used the diced italian style tomatoes that people suggested.  This meal turned out so well.  Everyone had seconds.  The only thing we wish we had done different than the recipe is added some shredded parmesan cheese to the top after serving.  That would have put it over the top.

Delish! I used extra sausage (~1.4 lb) and extra garlic. I found that it was way better fresh than left over. I will be making it again.

We made this tonight and it was delicious! We added more pepper flakes, and a few additional Italian spices, and omitted some of the sauce. It was really good! We are definitely going to make this and again! Thanks for adding the recipe.

This is a family favorite.  I have made this dish at least 20 times.  It is a very flexible recipie.  Ive tried half and half, adding veggies, using spicy sausage etc.  Be creative with adds, its great everytime.

Oh my goodness this recipe is so easy and delicious! I try to follow the recipes exactly so I can give them a fair rating. The only "change" I made was that I bought diced Italian tomatoes rather than buying the whole ones and chopping them myself. That shouldn't have had any affect on the flavor though. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. I literally love this recipe exactly the way it is, and that is very rare for me. The sauce is NOT too thin. You have to let it simmer and thicken and then add the pasta into the sauce. You could definitely add extras to this recipe such as spinach, but it definitely doesn't need anything. I will definitely make this again.

I think this was an absolutely delicious recipe.  I've made it twice in one week-once for company and once to send to a friend.  Both times, I used spinach and half and half as per another reviewer.  I love the addition of spinach.  I used San Marzano tomatoes both times.  The first time, I used sweet sausage and red pepper flakes, loose, and pulsed it in my cuisinart.  The second time I used hot sausage and no red pepper flakes.  I browned links of sausage and then cut them into 1/2 inch rings.  Loved the bow ties.  It is a great recipe, and I'll definitely make it again.  I've already shared it with several friends.  Thank you for sharing this.

Great recipe, have made this several times experimenting a little bit. I substituted half a cup of cream cheese and half a cup of milk instead of the heavy cream. Turns out great everytime.

I added a little more heavy cream because I had a could more ounces of noodles. I thought it was dry looking when I was finished but it was so good! My boyfriend went for seconds and I had lunch for three days. Keeps well.

Very yummy! I used spicy sausage and omitted the onions for mushrooms. Had to make a roux to get my sauce to thicken but other than that. It was amazing!

This was wonderful! I have 2 teen boys so I doubled parts of the recipe because we need leftovers and this made enough for 2 nights. Here is what I did:
-Used 2 packages of good Ital. sausage. Get the Cantallas brand if you can find it at Albertson's.
-Used 1 can of 28 oz diced ital. tomatoes
-Doubled the onions, garlic,red pepper and cream
- Used one box of bow tie pasta

I cooked the sausage, onions and garlic as directed in a skillet. While doing this, I boiled the pasta. When the pasta was done I took it off the heat and drained it. I put the sausage in the big pasta pot and added the cream and other ingredients into it. I simmered it for 10 minutes to thicken it. I then added the pasta back into the pot and stirred everything together. Before serving I sprinkled with fresh grated parmesan cheese and fresh parsley. I served it with bread and fresh green beans.  It was perfect and all of my boys loved it!

Just made this and it was really delicious. Even my teenaged daughters both had seconds...which is saying a lot. The creamy sauce is what makes it.  Will definitely make again.

My husband hates tomato sauce, so I'm always looking for pasta recipes.  This one hit the nail on the head after some tweaking. My nursing daughter has a milk allergy so I used coconut milk in place of heavy cream. My husband can stand fire roasted tomatoes but only in small amounts, so I only added a half can. I used hot Italian sausage instead of sweet,though I omitted the red pepper flakes and wished I hadn't since it wasn't quite spicy enough for us. I also added whole roasted garlic just because I love it. Oh, and tri colored farfelle for color. My husband actually went back for seconds even w the tomatoes and it was just as delicious the next day!

 I tried to make a healthier version by using turkey sausage, whole wheat pasta & light cream. It was yummy!

This is one of my families favorites.  We make it as directed, except sometimes substituting canned tomatoes and adding italian seasonings instead of buying italian style tomatoes.  Also just a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of 1/2 teaspoon, because that makes it too spicy for me.  I don't know why the one reviewer said it had no flavor, obviously he didn't use the right tomatoes or add italian seasoning with regular tomatoes.  Also helps to make sure your red pepper flakes are fresh.

This is my "go to" recipe when I need something quick and easy, or if I can't think of anything to make for dinner. My whole family loves it.

Very good. I found ground sausage so I didn't have to bother with the casings. We all loved it. After thickening, I turned it off and let the pasta soak up the sauce while the rolls cooked. The sauce soaked into the pasta and I didn't have a problem with thin sauce.So easy and quick! Thanks for this really good weekday meal!

Omg I thought I was in a restaurant it was just that good and my kids wanted seconds which is a good feeling.... This was a great receipe. I couldn't find sweet sausage so I used. A mild publix brand sausage and it still tasted good. I will be making this again on Sunday I can't wait lol.

I made this exactly as is and it was good.  Then, I had to use up a package of Summer Sausage and remembered the premise of this recipe.  I wondered if I could substitute the slices of precooked Summer Sausage for the Italian kind.  It was even better!  I sauté the onions and about 5 large button mushrooms, added the garlic,red pepper, sausage slices (bias sliced)then added the chopped tomatoes and cream.  Cooked till thick and added the pasta.  Added some salt and pepper to taste and finished off with a sprinkle of fresh parmesan cheese after plating.  YUMMMMM

Substituted 2cups baby spinach for parsley, did not drain tomatoes and added flour instead to thicken. Cooked pasta al dente so it could finish cooking and soak up some juices. Delicious!

Recently made a double batch of this for a group of 8 people I had over for dinner, and it was a hit! Used a can of petite diced tomatoes in olive oil, a squirt of basil paste, and two TBSP of flour to help the sauce thicken.  Don't forget to drain and pat-dry your sausage after browning.  I would definitely make again!

The flavor was pretty good. However, the cream curdled which made for an unappetizing presentation. I followed the recipe exactly except for draining the fat off the sausage. Maybe that had something to so with it, not sure.

I just made this, we liked it a lot. I used a roll of Jimmy Deans Sage sausage and a can of diced Italian style tomatoes. Next time I make this I want to add a second can of tomatoes.

Excellent recipe.  The only thing I changed was the 'type' of sausage as I didn't have any sweet italian on hand.  I used 1 lb of beef and 1 pound of Andouille.  I must say the combination was quite good and we ate it all up.  This one will go in my regular rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I never ever rate recipes and not only did I share it on FB I am posting here for the very first time! My two very minor edits: I browned the sausage without the olive oil (and did not drain) and I added a lb of sautéed mushrooms. My family is LOVING this meal!!!

Super easy and delicious.  I didn't change a thing other than using diced tomatoes instead of whole. (It was all I had).  
My husband and I both loved it.  Great recipe when you're short on time. Ingredients are usually in the pantry.
Anything this fast, easy and delicious gets 5 stars from me anytime!  Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic, truly. After making it regularly the first time, I made some adjustments for our tastes.  I use spicy turkey sausage now instead of sweet because it makes the dish a little less oily, while still providing a wonderful compliment to the flavor.  Everyone I have recommended this recipe to has loved it.  Lots of people out there are looking for a nice tomato cream sauce, and this dish really satisfies.

We loved this recipe!  The only thing we changed is that we bought the sausage pre-crumbled (not in links) and added mushrooms and spinach. We also made sure we mixed the pasta in. Super tasty - we'll be making it again!

Followed recipe except for heavy cream, I use evaporated milk to cut down on fat. Taste a bit bland, spiced up with a tsp oregano and a half cup of shredded mozzarella. A keeper!

Perfect - as is !  Make sure you mix the pasta with the sauce and heat through - I think that's why people are complaining about the sauce being too runny.  Mine was perfect - no adjustments.

Very good recipe. My only alteration was using frozen Tortellini instead of bow ties, and a 14oz can of Italian style tomatoes instead of the larger can, with a few extra pepper flakes.

Very tasty

I made this for the second time this evening and it was a big hit both times. I used hot Italian sausage for some extra zing and added fresh mushrooms for texture. I will definitely make this again but probably follow suggestions to add some corn starch to thicken up the sauce. I also added a good amount of grated Parmesan cheese. Serve with garlic bread to soak up all that great sauce. It's a quick and easy recipie.

This was an excellent dish! I did not use the red pepper flakes because my daughter doesn't like too much spice. It was easy and delicious!

Delicious! I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can Rotel and sauteed up 2 packages of mushrooms too. Added basil instead of parsley. Can't wait for leftovers tonight!

It was easy enough to make.   My husband really liked it-my kids weren't huge fans though.  I added some italian seasoning to mine because I wanted a little more flavor.  I would definitely make it again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is an outstanding recipe! Very simple, but the flavors are incredible! We doubled up the meat and made this with 2 lbs of sausage, just cause the boys in my family love meat! It heats up nicely for leftovers, too!

This was delicious!  I added mushrooms, black pepper and extra crushed red pepper to make it spicier, and a bit of cornstarch to thicken.  Husband loved it.

Followed the recipe except for the parsley. I recommend sautéed asparagus instead. It added nutritional value and tastes great. Thanks for submitting this.

This has become a favourite, easy and just a little different than most pasta dishes. I use milk, not cream, and it's rich enough.

This was a really good satisfying Pasta dish, I only mad a few changes . I used hot sausage instead of sweet and left out the red pepper flakes, I also used Italian-style diced tomatoes instead of cutting up whole. I was really happy with the outcome we will be making this again.

Great recipe only thing I did differently was at a teaspoon of cornstarch, and use diced tomatoes. My husband asks for it all the time. The first time he seemed really surprised I could make something so good.

Definitely enjoyed this recipe! It was super easy and fast which, as a college student, I love. I did change the recipe slightly by adding tomato sauce instead of tomatoes because I don't like chunky tomatoes. I do wish I had drained the sausage before adding the cream because the end result was a tad greasy. I will for sure be trying this recipe again though!

Found this while looking for some inspiration for dinner to mix it up a bit and use some sausage I had in my fridge.  Good enough recipe though I made some slight adjustments like folding in some fresh made mascarpone cheese I had left over with the heavy creme, cutting the pepper flakes out and using far different sausage and adding a splash of white wine.  It's a kind of half béchamel sauce with tomatoes, where the sausage takes the place of what ever other pork you'd normally use.  The real reason I replied though is in response to the poster who found this sauce flavorless.  If heavy cream, sausage, roma tomatoes, red pepper, and an onion doesn't have any flavor for you, you aren't salting well enough. I didn't really follow any of the measurements on the recipe itself, hence why I originally wasn't going to reply, but always salt to taste unless you're baking.  When cooking the recipe is just a guide line, if things don't look right or don't look like they will come out the way you personally like them, then make adjustments.

Very bland. I'd recommend draining the tomatoes into the pan, to start. The tomatoes are the most exciting thing about this dish and as the recipe is written, you're pouring all that flavor down the drain.

This is dish was easy to make, hearty, creamy, and super satisfying. First time I made it I followed the recipe exactly, next time I added some leftover prociutto and pancetta. This is a great basic recipe and also really easy to flare up with a number of ingredients.

Super fast and easy.  Get the spicy Italian sausages rockin' first though via boiling them. Then food process them or not.  Save the boiling water and dump the pasta in so it can boil while you get going on the tomato/onion/garlic part.  Food process your onion and tomato (unless using canned) and put with sausages in skillet.  Add some extra Italian spices and/or fresh basil b/c this needs to be kicked up some.  I used half and half and it was fine.

Thought this was really good.  I used fresh basil instead of parsley and half and half instead of heavy cream (its what I had).  Added corn starch as another suggested to thicken it up and it was perfect.  Used Cavatappi pasta and it held the sauce beautifully. Also used 1 can of Diced tomatoes with Basil, Garlic and Oregano, and a couple of fresh diced tomatoes.  Also added some Oregano to the tomatoes before adding to the dish.  Will definitely try again and continue to experiment.

Yummy! Added thawed spinach and drain grease like someone else suggested. Delicious!!! And even better left over.

Update: let me just add that I made
It second time around exactly as recipe called (minus the parsley) and my 22 month old loved it so much!! She kept saying yummy sausage momma, I like it! Yummy tomatoes! " And she was sipping the sauce off of her spoon. Ahh, success.

Super easy and so yummy! I struggle with cooking. My kids and husband absolutely loved this... Only question - wondering if sauce can be made ahead and canned, if kept in the fridge.

Healthy Option: replace heavy cream with cottage cheese, use immersion blender to make creamy (haven’t tried yet, trying this evening and will update review)

Delicious!!! I have made this recipe as is several times. In fact my mom has requested this for her bday dinner tonight. I never have any trouble with the sauce. I use Jimmy Dean Italian Sausage and because I love tomatoes, I always use 2 cans instead of 1.

This was phenomenal.  So much so that this is the first recipe I have ever rated here.  Even my picky, every new food is a fight, child took one bite, gave a thumbs up and kept eating.  Did half the red pepper flakes since I was feeding a child.  Saved this forever ago and so wish I had tried it sooner.  This is going into rotation.

I tweeked mine just a little, less parsley, bulk mild Italian sausage, and added a little shredded Parmesan at the end. But it was delicious! I'm definitely sharing the recipe with friends, and keeping it in my books!

Just made this for the first time...absolutely fantastic chilli cream pasta recipe! Tasted even better then a very similar dish at a local restaurant. Won't be needing to go out anymore! Thank you so much for adding this! It is the perfect amount of spice. I followed the recipe as is, didn't have an italian sausage so I sliced a chorizio sausage and it tasted great. The only differences I made was I added fresh chopped sweet red pepper and frozen spinach during the simmer phase. Also needed to simmer at med high for about 20-25 minutes to let the sauce thicken to the point that it coated the noodles without being watery. Mixed the noodles into the sauce and sprinkled with parsley and some parmesan. Will definitely be making it again and again!

This is such a great pasta. I plan on making this again for my baby shower. It's so easy and so tasty!  I did use Italian style diced tomatoes because I had them already on hand but besides that I followed the recipe exactly. I don't see where people are having a hard time with the sauce, if you follow the recipe there should not be a problem. I have many picky eaters in my house and everyone loved it! I have added this recipe to my menu. Thank you Linda for the wonderful recipe!

I am relatively new to cooking (aka more than dorm room mac n cheese) and this was wonderful.  We were looking for some new dishes and this was amazing! The cream seemed odd at first, but it added a nice touch.  I used minced onion instead of fresh onion, and it worked fine. I will probably use a little less onion next time.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I used spicy Italian sausage instead of sweet just because my family and I love a little kick in our food and it was excellent. The only thing that I would add is Parmesan cheese because it was a little bland without it. Overall excellent recipe.

This is one of our family's go-to recipes. Since we are a half vegetarian, half omnivore family, we substituted Field Roast Italian Sausage for the sausage in this recipe and added some ground black pepper. Then we let the sauce thicken on a low simmer for a good 15-20 minutes to let the flavors meld. We then mixed it with a 16 oz pkg of bow ties and flavored the dish with Parmesan cheese. Quick and easy meal and the leftovers, if there are any, are wonderful.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was better than I thought. I followed the recipe (minus olive oil plus spinach) and it was perfect. I served it with a grilled pork chop and garlic toast. Thanks for sharing

I love this recipe. I followed it exactly as written and it was very good. I would not change a thing next time which is very rare for me to do. Easy, quick, inexpensive, and tastes great. Husband liked it and so did my 4 year old nephew who was visiting.

This was a great meal. My 3 year old loved it too. It was easy to do after work and easy to modify as needed. I added a little less red pepper for the little one and just used rotini pasta and half and half. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe! It reminded me of a plate of an italian restaurant! Instead of sausage I had to use something else because of where I live in... I added bacon and ham. Also, instead of canned tomatoes, I used fresh ones without skin.
It was delicious!!! Next time I will add a little bit of more cream but that´s just me!

This is a fav recipe of mine. I used to make something like it without the cream, but I do like the added creaminess. Based on my old recipe, I add a little lemon juice and a whole lot of dried basil. Oh so good!

I did use diced tomatoes, because that's what I had on hand, but followed everything else about the recipe.   This dish was AWESOME, and I realized I didn't not rate it until I was back today to check the recipe so I can make it again tonight!  Thank-you !

This recipe is delicious! The sauce was a little thin. I'll probably use less heavy cream next time but other then that, it was a hit! The taste was fantastic! It was extremely easy and I appreciate ingredients I can easily use again. This will become a staple at my house. Thank you!

The red pepper flakes spilled when I was adding them, so it got a bit hotter than expected, so if you like heat...just add more red pepper.  Great flavor!

I've made this recipe twice and love it! I didn't cook quite as much pasta as it calls for, leaving it even creamier. This is definitely a save.

Delicious. Had left overs for the next day that were just as tasty! That little bit of red pepper makes all the difference. I used canned organic diced tomatoes and ground mild Italian sausage.

Very good! I used spicy Italian sausage instead of the sweet. Had a nice bite to it. I think next time I'll some frozen peas, for color, or chives. All in all a very good recipe!

My family loves this dish. It is super easy and the sausage gives it good flavor. Note - you need to drain the grease from the sausage before adding other ingredients.

I loved this dish.  I hesitated to make it because of some of the negative reviews, but am glad I decided to try it for myself.  Why do reviewers comment on health content?  You see the ingredients before you make the dish, so if there's too much fat for you (Joannasmultiverse) then don't make the recipe and stop preaching.   I will make this dish again.

Good!  Good flavors.  Loved it.  I left out the olive oil, used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and used only one can 14 1/2 ounce can of italian style diced tomato (DRAINED).  I wonder if the other reviewers who subbed diced for the whole tomatoes drained them…because that could account for the thinness of the sauce.  I almost forgot to drain mine.  I can't recall ever draining a can of diced tomatoes.  I'm really glad I did though.  Next time I will add some fresh mushrooms and perhaps a little bit of spinach.  Oh and my husband didn't like the parsley on top…perhaps I too coarsely chopped it.

Our family loved this recipe.  We have several picky eaters and they mist raved over the flavors. Instead of the parsley we added fresh Basil just because we really like it. Thank you for sharing this simple but crowd pleasing recipe.  I am sure to make it again

Oh my goodness!  Made this last night and it was amazing.  I always read the reviews so I did tweak this one.  I added green peppers and mushrooms, changed out the plum tomatoes with one can each of the stewed and petite diced.  I didn't have much hope of being flavorful but I was wrong.  I only used have a box of bowties because we like a lot of sauce...it was like eating a very hearty soup -- yup, I served it in individual bowls.  Very, very tasty.  My husbands comment was, "I'd even eat this as a leftover."  Which is unheard of from him.  Simply amazing, thank you for sharing.

Really delicious! I used spicy diced tomatoes and heavy cream and it was amazing. I might try it with half and half next time, just to save myself!

This turned out great. We used more sausage because my family likes overly meaty meals. We used black pepper instead of the pepper flakes because we didn't want too spicy for our little ones. Since we added more meat, we used more heavy cream which was a mistake and we had to pour some out. Other than that it was perfect.

This recipe is really good!  It is easy to make, doesn't take long, and can be tweeked to your liking.  Originally, I was going to comment on how the sauce didn't thicken.  But I discovered something by accident.  After adding the pasta and simmering for 10 minutes.  I removed the pan from the heat and it sat for about another 10 minutes before I served it.  The sauce was considerably more thicker than it had been.  Now, it's not going to be thick like spaghetti sauce.  But it also wasn't as runny as it had been.  Maybe that's the secret!

Pretty good and would make again.  I used 2 cans of tomatoes which I smashed with a potato masher because we wanted more sauce. I used rigatoni because thats what I had on hand.

EXCELLENT!!!!  Even my really picky 7 year old LOVED this!  It is absolutely delicious!!!! I did use half sweet italian sausage and half spicy because I like a little spice and didn't have any red pepper flakes. I also added green, red and yellow peppers along with the garlic and onion.  This is pretty to look at also.  I would serve this when guests are over for sure!

I loved the recipe! Big hit with my husband too. Only thing is increase the salt a bit & dont forget to drain the oil before adding the cream. I used a paper towel and cleaned/absorbed the oil off of the bottom of the pan. I'm thinking of replacing the sausage for shrimp next time :D

I adjusted for 2 servings and it was great. Great cream sauce recipe. Didn't need to change a thing but I used a smaller pan for the sauce and sausage but also used spicy sausage so I excluded the red pepper. It came out perfect. For sure a keeper. Make sure you have experience with sauces before you attempt this. The recipe is perfect down to the last word. You shouldn't have to drain any grease and the flavor plus color comes from the sausage. If you use ground pork make sure you season with more then red pepper.

I made this tonight for dinner with garlic bread and salad and it was a big hit! Added extra fresh garlic, spinach, basil and some pasta water. Subbed fat free half and half. It makes a lot! It fed 7 with enough left over for two lunches! I'll be making this one again!

I monkeyed with the recipe a bit, adding more garlic and cream, a splash of sherry, and a few fistfuls of fresh baby spinach, so I don't know how accurate my 5 stars is for the original recipe. That being said, YUM. This was delicious!

This was fabulous! I cut it in half and thought it still made quite a lot...I'm thrilled to have leftovers! I mixed the pasta in and let it simmer and blend for a few more minutes before serving. I prefer mini bow ties over regular sized, so I did that too. I used spicy sausage because that's what I could find and it added great flavor. Will definitely make this again!!

I just made this tonight and it was fantastic!  I only had on hand small bow ties and a can of crushed tomatoes.  I did not drain tomatoes and added to pan with the heavy cream and let simmer with the cooked bow ties and this was a hit with my family.  I even added a chopped red bell pepper for extra color.  I love this recipe!

Most recipes that I have tried lately have been mediocre at best. This dish has finally changed all of that. It is absolutely delicious and very simple and easy to make. This will remain in my family's menu box for quite some time. Thank you!!

Wish I could rate more than 5 stars! I don't know that I've ever served a more raved about dish in my home. The pan was practically licked clean. Followed the recipe to a T and had absolutely no problems. If my husband has anything to say about it I will probably be making this again, sooner rather than later.

This recipe was great!  I used bulk pork Italian sausage without casings and subed in diced Italian tomatoes since I couldn't find Italian style plum tomatoes at the store. It turned out great and my kids are it up!

My brother had this today as one of his many dishes at the Christmas table, he made it just as is.  It was the hit of the dinner.  I plan to make it as soon as I can make it to the market.  So good.

If your looking for a recipe to blow the minds of some dinner guest, friends, or family this is it. I've made this recipe a couple of times and I don't tweak the recipe at all. If it isn't broke don't fix it. Believe me this recipe is not broke!

Made this last weekend. Didn't get quite so creamy but my boyfriend couldn't eat it fast enough! Is kinda bland, I added a lot of seasoning in the bowl when eating... Will add more during cooking next time. Might also try just chopping up the sausage into slices instead of removing the casing and sautéing. Also going to add more onion and some other veggies! Awesome base recipe and let's you run free with it!! Definitely goin in the make again pile!

I made this as written but I didn't love it.  Maybe I am just not an Italian sausage person, though to be fair my bf really liked it.  May try again with beef and thicken cream with a touch of cornstarch next time.

This recipe is a staple in my house. I use mild Italian sausage & don't add the pepper flakes because I have a little one who doesn't like spicy foods.

Loved this one! Although I added a red pepper to it to give it more flavor, and the fact that I love them! I also ran out of parsley, so I added basil and it turned out great!

Family loved it! Most likely will make this again but next time will try to use different incased sausages for different flavors. Great recipe! At first the amount of liquid will freak you out but the pasta will absorb it right up. Had no leftovers and added shrimp. Really good.

This was outstanding! I used 28 oz diced tomatoes and I did not add any salt. I also may have used a bit more onion. Once the sauce is stirred in with the pasta, allow it to sit and cool for a while - the sauce thickens and the pasta sops a lot of it up. Keeper for sure! Thank you!

Very good.  I couldn't find plum tomatoes in a can so I used diced instead.  Tasted great and didn't notice any difference.  I also just cut the sausage links into pieces and cooked it.  My kids like chunks of meat and it cuts the time down in preparation. The sauce does appear very runny when cooking but once pasta is added, it was the right amount.  This makes a TON.  It tasted good reheated too and I was pleasantly surprised by that!  Next time, I will drain grease from sausage links.

Awesome recipe! I took alot of advice from other reviewers and added spinach. I also used 1 1/2 lbs of meat and 2 cups of heavy cream because I had a lb of pasta. It was delicious. I think next time I'll try sage or sweet sausage. I used Italian this time and I wasn't as happy about the fennel. This was quite delicious and I will definitely make this again.

Good quick recipe.  We used some sliced mushrooms in here too.  Can easily used different shapes of pasta too.

I fed this to my family of 4 and we all went back for seconds. I used canned italian tomatoes and added all the tomato juice. I also bought chicken sausages, spicy italian flavored. I will make again and again!

My kids love this and they are not sausage eaters.  This is probably the most requested meal from them.  For my youngest who does not like tomatoes, I make as directed, drain the juice from the can tomatoes into mixture and continue as directed. I scoop out a serving for her and then add the tomatoes to the mixture for the rest of the family.

I made it exactly as called for and it was delicious! The sauce does look runny at first, but once you add the pasta to the sauce, it is not runny at all. Next time I will alter it to make it healthier but definitely a good dish.

Super simple and great recipe!!! I love how easy it was and still worked even tho I lacked some ingredients. I tried this last night, I didnt have any cream so I substituted with whole milk and used egg noodles instead... Still came out great. I was using wild pork sausage so I didnt have the problems others have listed with it being too greasy, so I guess it just depends on what type of sausage your using if your going to need to drain the sausage or not before adding the other ingredients. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Made this tonight! I followed the recipe with just a few changes. I didn't use a whole pound of sausage because it was just myself and my husband and I'm not a sausage lover..also, when I cook, I usually don't measure out the onion or garlic, or spices..just add to taste. Followed others suggestions and used diced tomatoes and half and half. I also added some basil, and I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried. I added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce a little. It came out really good, although a bit too spicy for me, but good enough for my husband (who doesn't like creamy too often) to go back for seconds!:)

This one looked interesting so I made it tonight. Although I mostly followed the recipe I made some small changes.  I used 2/3 sweet sausage and 1/3 hot sausage, and I added a fresh red pepper cut in to strips (I love red peppers).

I enjoyed this one immensely and will definitely make it again.

I bought diced Italian style tomatoes by mistake, used fat free half & half instead of heavy cream and regular Italian sausage but this still turned out really good!  I added a little basil and oregano to the sauce because I think they make any tomato sauce taste better.  The leftovers were even better reheated the next day.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good!  (I must confess that I am not a huge pasta fan but my husband loves it.)  To make it a bit more healthy I used whole wheat penne, fat free half and half, Italian chicken sausage and stirred about 9 ounces of baby spinach into the sauce.  The sauce was really good.  I liked the spiciness but my husband thought it a bit hot so I will decrease the red paper flakes next time.  I will definitely make again.  Would be good with any added veggies, too, like mushrooms or zucchini.  Thanks.

This tasted so delicious! Next time though I'm going to reduce the heavy cream to 3/4 cup. The 1 1/2 cups seemed to be too much because mine never thickened for some reason. The flavor combos in this dish are really good though.

Fabulous and easy recipe! I used a whole onion, didn't drain the tomatoes, added frozen spinach and sprinkled with Parmesan/Romano cheese blend before serving. I cooked the pasta in chicken broth and water (50/50). Reheated for lunch the next day and it was still very good! Thanks for sharing. My hubby who isn't a big fan of pasta loved this dish too!

QUICK, EASY and DELICIOUS! I've made this recipe dozens of times because we all love it so much.  I drain the sausage before adding onions & garlic.  I do substitute fresh basil for the parsley, just because I love it and I think it adds a wonderful flavor--otherwise followed recipe to the letter.  If you are counting calories, you can substitute half-and-half and it will be ALMOST as good.  To those reviewers who didn't think there was enough sauce: make sure you are only using 12 oz. of pasta --I've noticed that some brands of bow-ties come in a 12 oz. box & others come in a 16 oz. box.  This recipe is one of my favorites and is a definite keeper!

Made it last night.  My husband liked it and normally he doesn't like pasta.  My very picky son, who does like pasta and almost nothing else liked it too.  I did do some changes, I added mushrooms, spinach and fresh basil after the onions, before tomatoes.  Added some italian seasoning because my tomatoes didn't have any and used half cream, half milk to cut some of the calories.  Turned out great.  Would make again.

Very good dish. I used mild sausage and only a pinch of red pepper so the kids would eat it. I also used sour cream and a small amount of milk because that is all I had on hand. it turned out very well.

I love this recipe as a starter. I've made it several times. I have only made one modification. We are cheese lovers at my house so I added 8 ounces of an Italian blend cheese. My sister made the comment that she would use Rotel in place of the diced tomatoes. Point being that this is a great recipe. Tweak it with your personal preference.

Great recipe! Came out really well, I made sure to dump out the grease after cooking the sausage. I also used 3/4 cup light cream instead of all that heavy cream to cut down on calories, it still tasted great (just be sure to add some cornstarch if that thins out the sauce too much)!

This recipe was wonderful. We wanted to keep eating more and my kids loved it (picky eaters too). Easy to make also. My wife usually does most of the cooking, so for a dad who needed a quick and easy recipe, this was perfect.

All 3 of us said.... "mmmmm" at the same time with the first bite.  We topped it off  with shredded Parmesan cheese.  So good!  I didn't have anything to thicken it with so we just put the extra sauce in a bowl and added it to our plate.

This was fantastic! I've never rated a recipe before, but this was so good that I had to do it! I used tortellini instead because I had it on hand and needed to use it. I also used spinach and garlic chicken sausage. I used fresh cherry tomatoes and simply cut them in half and then doubled the Italian seasoning. I had enough liquid this way. It was sensational. My one and three year olds even gobbled it up. It is a very versatile dish and would even be great to serve to company. I am already drooling at the thought of leftovers for lunch today! Also, I made the sauce ahead of time while the kids napped and it made dinner incredibly easy. This is such a great recipe!

Used ground beef instead of sausage. Used einkorn linguine pasta (a much better version of wheat - available on Amazon) instead of white pasta. Taste really good!

Everyone LOVES this dish especially my daughter who generally does not like sausage, or almost any of the ingredients in this for that matter! The only thing I would say is be careful not to overdo it on the oil! Other than that, perfect!!

I used a combination of cream and milk. It was fine but not great. It definitely needs more spices or herbs. The pasta should sit for several minutes (10 to 15 minutes) after adding the sauce to allow the pasta to soak up the extra liquid.

We really liked this recipe, and I will certainly make it again.  Following others suggestions, I used fat free half and half to cut down the fat. Also, for simplicity sake, used two cans of petite diced tomatoes.  Because we are vegetarians, I used a box of Mornings Star Farms hot and spicy veggie sausage I used all the oil since the sausage doesn't have a lot of extra fat.  Also topped it with a little parmesan cheese, and added sliced black olives to each serving.  The flavor was excellent, and even my husband who usually dislikes any type of cream sauce really liked it. It was very flavorful and spicy, due to the spicy sausage and the red pepper. Excellent, Thanks for a great one.

just made this dish tonight - fabulous.  We followed the recipe for the most part but like others we used diced tomatoes (28oz) and I added in some basil.  I also tripled the garlic, if something says add three cloves garlic I always do at least double or triple that because we LOVE garlic.

I was afraid of the cream, but it really added an almost cheese flavor.  I used chicken sausage cut into slices instead of italian bulk sausage, but it would be delicious either way.  There was more sauce and it was more liquidy that I expected.  I might drain the tomato liquid off partially next time.

This was an excellent sauce that everyone in my family had seconds of. I'd give it five stars except I made a few changes - I used only 1 T. oil instead of 2 and a nonstick pan, 1 lb. sweet chicken sausage sliced, 28 oz. Italian style diced tomatoes UNDRAINED, only 1 c. cream, and I threw in about 1/4 c. pesto because I didn't have parsley. One daughter thought it was a little too spicy but she still had two helpings, so I'm not changing the proportions next time. The extra garlic and red pepper flakes really make it! Thank you for the recipes and for everyone's tips.

Oh my Gah! So GOOD! Its like pizza pasta. I used a can of diced tomatoes in Italian seasoning, added dried basil and I topped the bowls with a heap of shredded Parmesan cheese. I am in heaven right now.

This was a great and easy recipes. All 3 of my teens liked it. I used and whole 1 lb. box of pasta, Andouli Sausage as well as  diced red peppers, asparagus, celery and broccoli. I am adding it to my "Make Again!" folder! The entire meal with extra fresh veggies added was still only $11 and made enough to serve six! Thanks for sharing!

Loved this! Used 4 oz. cream cheese and 1 cup of milk in lieu of the cream (only because I didn't have any!) and it tasted amazingly rich and delicious! The only other changes I made were to use a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes and 1/4 tsp. of red pepper since we don't like really spicy foods.  I sprinkled parm. cheese on top with the parsley. It was a big hit, even for my picky eater!

Sooo good!  I took advice of another reviewer and added spinach and topped with Italian 6 blend cheese and baked for a few minutes.  I also made it today to put on my hot bar at work tomorrow.  I am sure it will be a big hit!

If I can give this more than 5 stars, I would! It was so easy and tasted like I bought it in a restaurant!  I can't wait to make it again. Next time I'm trying it with hot sausage!  I too used italian canned tomatoes, but I want to try it with fresh tomatoes. I think it would be just as yummy!

I wish we could add music to the reviews! I would add the sound of angels singing. This was amazing. So quick and easy, and my family loved it. I am a little leery of using red pepper, as I don't like spicy food, but the cream in this recipe really balanced the spice well. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used diced Italian tomatoes. Grated a little fresh parmigiano reggiano on top. Glorioso!

Made this last night and it is delicious.  Instead of 1 1/2 cups of cream, I used 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup of white wine to deglaze my pan. I also added a little of the tomato juice from the bottom of the can.

My family’s all-time favourite recipe. We add one large red onion, lots of red pepper, and sliced mushrooms. I use a can of Italian tomato sauce and 1 can of Italian diced tomatoes with 2 cups of whipping cream (lower fat options work nicely too). Thank you for this recipe! Delicious!

I've been preparing a very similar recipe as my "go to" main dish for company.  I add two additional ingredients to the sauce before mixing it with the pasta, chopped fresh basil and some slices of lemon peel while the sauce is simmering.I remove the lemon peel when serving.  To make it even simpler, I used canned diced seasoned tomatoes, like fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic... I add lots of grated Parmesan at the end.

The family really liked this. The only change I made was I used one 12 oz. can skimmed evaporated milk instead of the cream. Saved lots of calories and fat. We don't like spicy dishes so I skipped the red pepper flakes. Will be making this again. Thank you for posting this Linda!

This is a the best pasta recipe!  I love this dinner with crusty bread to sop up the great sauce.  You should try adding fresh kale and sliced portabello mushrooms, it is awsome!

Josh loved it. Used some plain yogurt and a little bit of milk cause I didn't have cream. Added spinach, red pepper, 1 14 oz. can tomatoes and 2 fresh beefsteak tomatoes. Good stuff. Oh, I also added a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce (juice) and it ended up being not saucy at all.

This was so delicious! I used chicken instead of sausage, just cut it into thin strips.  I also sautéed some shallots and green peppers with the chicken.  Used canned tomatoes and some extra italian seasonings. Was just perfect! Can't wait for lunch tomorrow to eat the leftovers. 
Thanks for a great recipe.

We really enjoyed this dish. This is a quick and easy meal to make. Just for myself and our two kids(4 and 1) I will put in half amount of red pepper flakes next time.  However, hubby liked it just as is. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is awesome! I couldn't believe how easy and yummy! I have problems relating to the crazy folks who think this recipe is bland! Did you use Italian sausage?? Did you add red pepper flakes?? Did you add the salt at the end?? This was fan- tas- tic! The only changes I made were that I used venison Italian sausage because that's what we use, I used diced tomatoes instead of whole, I used heavy whipping cream because it was in the fridge for potato soup and I added half a bag of shredded mozz cheese at the end. What an incredibly easy tasty creation! Thanks so much! This goes in the keeper box. I've belonged to all recipes for 6 years now and this is only the second recipe I felt compelled to rate, good job!

i really enjoyed the creamy yet tomato-y sauce. i would suggest (unless you really love it) less sausage than it recommends. maybe half? and yes drain the  meat afterwards and also the can of tomatoes (i neglected to do that) otherwise the sauce will be a little thin. still great flavor though.

This was really simple and it came out great.  I like doing recipes that are a little out of the ordinary.  I will try this with Italian style turkey sausage next time to make it a bit healthier.  This one is a keeper.

This recipe is so delicious and easy.  I make it with turkey sausage.  I also use half and half instead of whipping cream.   I tried to double up the ingredients once for a large group.  For some reason the taste was off.  I think I should not have used that much cream.

This was fabulous and a family pleaser.  I made it exactly as stated, except I had to increase it to 15 servings for my crew. I will make it often. :-)

By the way, I used a local market-made Italian sausage, didn't drain it, and it was perfect.

I barely review recipes - too much work. This one was worth my time. It was delicious, and my picky eater daughter loved it as well. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great dinner recipe that does not cost a lot.

We loved the flavor of this dish!  We added green peas and it really made the color pop.  Next time, we will halve the red pepper flakes (we prefer things a little less spicy) and simmer covered to better thicken the sauce, which didn't thicken very much at all.

This is entering my recipe rotation!

This is really good.  I did omit the red pepper flakes(made for my parents, they don't do spicy).  Otherwise made as is.  Combining the pasta in with the sauce is key!

Delicious!  Thank you for the recipe!  Super easy to make and I could cook ahead even though my boyfriend wasn't home for a few hours.  It was so good he pretty much polished off the whole dish by himself.

This will be a staple at our house for a long time.  I've made it twice pretty much by the recipe but I think it's a great recipe for experimenting with too.  I'm thinking mushrooms.  Mmmmmmm.....

Absolutely delicious!  While this recipe is quick and easy enough to make it's not only a perfect  addition to your regular dinner rotation,  it's also aproprate for guests and dinner parties.  It's that good!  I make this recipe as is, nothing added or deleted from the original recipe and my family devours it every time.  I've read many of the other reviews and have a hard time understanding why they are having trouble with creating the sauce.  By making the recipe just a it's written it turns out perfect.  The sauce isn't supposed to be thick like an Alfredo sauce nor is it watery.  Rather its the perfect in between making a delicious creamy yet light sauce. It's magnificent!

Quick, easy and delicious.  Followed recipe except added 2 14oz cans of petite diced tomatoes (one drained the other not) and about a cup of peas.  I was concerned that the sauce was too thin but after pasta sat in it a couple of minutes it was all absorbed.  My entire family loved it even my very picky eater (although she did pick out the tiny diced tomatoes).  Thank you for a wonderful base recipe.

This recipe was excellent.  It was so quick and easy to make, my kids loved it, and made great leftovers.  I had no red pepper flakes so I added some cayenne pepper.  I had no problem with it being too greasy.  Dinner was ready within 45 minutes of me getting home from work.  Would definitely make this again.

I love this super easy recipe. I used diced tomatoes instead of plum whole ones and substituted the 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream with 1 cup of light heavy cream and it tasted great!

I thought this recipe was phenomenal! I made it for a my brother and his wife and my niece and nephew (who can be picky). They had 3 servings.I made the dish with rotini noodles because they tend to soak up the sauce better. It worked well, and i added chopped frozen basil instead of parsley. Everything was very flavorful.

This is just a great recipe and is a crowd pleaser for most of my family.  I had a 1/2 pound of sausage on hand but I think I'll keep it at the lower amount vs a full pound to keep the fat content down.  I also used fat free half and half and it turned out really well.  I have it in the regular rotation!

This was a hit at my house. I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to substitute the heavy cream with 3/4 cup milk and 1/3 cup butter. Simmer and add flour to thicken. This makes 1 cup of cream. It worked just fine. Added some italian seasoning since I only had cubed tomatoes. Loved it.

Made this for the first time time tonight and it was pretty good.  My sauce didn't come out as creamy as I would like, so I'll have to play with it a little.  Overall, definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is soooo good!  It truly has become a staple with me.  I love that it has tomatoes but is not too heavy with tomato sauce.  The fact that it is made with cream rather than cheese (which I grate once it's on my plate) means that my oldest daughter who doesn't eat cheese can enjoy it also.  Thanks for sharing such a flavorful recipe!

It was Delicious, I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned ( i boil the tomatoes then remove the skin and seed and chop it, add some olive oil to a skillet, a minced garlic then add the tomatoes and add dried thyme and salt and bring to boil), i also add dried basil on the pasta before serving

i just made this and i LOVE it!  i cut the recipe in 1/2 because it was just me eating it, and there was still enough to have leftovers for prolly 2 more meals.  i didnt have any plain tomatoes, so i used some chili ready ones with green chilies and holy spice lol.  i also used turkey sausage.  totally a keeper for nights when i am kid free!

You just can't go wrong with sausage in a cream sauce over pasta.  I will say that I found the parsley to be a must... it added a wonderful lightness to a very rich dish.  I used half and half with a little cornstarch instead of cream and I also grated fresh parmesan on top.  Delish!

Very good..kids love it.  I used mild sausage.  It was a little runny.  I should've drained some of the tomato juice.

This is a great dish, but I only use a couple sausage links and non-fat 1/2 & 1/2.  No need to drain tomatoes and simmer a little longer to blend flavors.

This is a great base recipe, but it needs a lot of seasoning to make it flavorful.  It is just too bland in the current recipe form.  I added some Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and parmesan cheese and salt at the end.   After all of those changes it was tasty.  Next time I would use spicy italian sausage to try to add a bit of pep to it.

I used diced tomatoes with italian seasonings, and did not find it bland at all. Loved the red pepper in it!

The family enjoyed this recipe.  Followed original instructions and added broccoli.  Mine was not greasy at all.  I guess that depends on the quality of sausage used.  I love recipes such as this one where you can be creative and play with the ingredients.  It's a keeper!

I made this tonight and it was delicious. The sauce was not too thin at all, as some reviewers have suggested.  I wonder if they are forgetting to drain the tomatoes?  Very fast, easy recipe. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks!

Love this one - easy, quick, yummy. Only change is I use crushed tomato instead because of picky hubby about tomato chunks. Use heavy cream as recipe calls for - not half & half. Totally worth it for taste. Thanks L. Caroline!

I made this for my husband and I and it was wonderful, 
and being one to use left overs I served it a few days later just by adding some chicken broth and  making it into a "soup", and it was even better !
I will defanatly be making this again.

Amazing!! My husband and I loved it, and the leftovers were even better than when I first made it! I used a bit more garlic and onions, and used italian style diced tomatoes. No red pepper flakes because neither my husband or I have any type of heat tolerance haha. Also switched the cream for half and half and nixed the parsley for fresh spinach instead to make it healthier, and it was incredibly tasty! The best thing about this meal is that it's so easy to make small substitutions and it still comes out absolutely fantastic! Will be making this again and again!

Love this recipe.  I cannot eat sausage so I used ground meat, followed everything else as listed and this was delicious!!!!!  To address some of the reviews, as the pasta cools it seems to absorb the sauce, to the point of when you go to reheat it you have to add a little more cream or it would be dry.  As far as where the flavor comes from, the pepper flakes give just the right amount of heat, the onion and garlic give a subtle flavor then the Italion seasoning gives it just enough.  This is not one of those hit you over the head with flavor, this is subtle and creamy and very filling.

Made this tonight.  Followed recipe with the following changes: after sauce was cooked, added pasta and sprinkled 2 tbsp of flour over the mixture to thicken.  Also added a container of sliced baby bella mushrooms when I added the pasta.  Was delicious.  Even got a thumbs up from my husband which is high praise indeed!!

Very good! We would probably use hot Italian sausage next time for a little more zip and more salt was required.

This dish was delicious, yet so simple. The only change I made was based on previous reviews and that was to add Italian seasoning. My 9 year old helped me make this and we will make again.

This recipe got my attention because it is easy and sounded good.  Made it as directed and it was good, but I can't help but wonder what a teaspoon or two of good italian seasoning would add.  I'll try that next time.

I made this, following the recipe exactly, (except using egg noodles instead of bow ties, since that is what I had handy). The whole family really liked it!
I will be making this again.

Pretty good & easy.  I added some oregano, sherry & a teaspoon of sugar to add to the flavor since it was a tad on the bland side initially.

I changed one thing.... I drained the sausage after I browned it. This is a real winner. Plus, you can alternate ingredients easily if you dont have them in stock. For instance use half & half with a tablespoon of tomato paste if you dont have the heavy cream. you can always add your own italian seasoning if you dont have the italian style plum tomatoes, such as diced tomatoes or plane whole tomatoes with a tbsp of basil and a tbsp of oregano. This is going to be a lifetime favorite in my house.

This is one of my favorite dishes.. This dish is as good as any pasta dish that Olive Garden has served.  It's quick to make and you can be flexible with the ingredients. I make it once or twice a month for me and my family..

I have made this recipe twice and it is great.  It's fast and easy to make and very tasty.  The first time I made it I didn't have any cream so I used evaporated milk...believe it or not it was really good.  The second time I made it as instructed and it was great!  I will be making this one again.

Really good.  Definitely a keeper.
Used 1/2 sweet and 1/2 hot italian sausage.  Also added fresh spinach and parmesan.

A very excellent dinner on cool nights!   As one reviewer said this is a versatile recipe and you can add different things.  I added chopped spinach and a whole (chopped) green pepper. I also used a can of tomatoes instead of fresh.  Served with garlic bread and VIOLA!!!!  Glad to know that the sauce is added to the pasta before serving so the sauce can be absorbed in to the pasta  Funny...I was looking for a recipe to use up some heavy cream that was in the fridge!  Jackpot!  It's a keeper.

Great recipe that can be prepared during the busy work/school week.  I used a 16 oz. box of ziti instead of bow ties becuase I like a heartier noodle and I find bow ties stick together and get soggy.  Just a personal preference thing.  I used half heavy cream and 1/2 half and half in an attempt to reduce the calories a little.  Turned out wonderful this way.  I just now noticed I was supposed to drain the tomatoes which I actually did not do with excellent results and enjoyed a good amount of sauce, but not too much.  Served with parmesan cheese and a ceasar salad on the side.  Super hearty meal and with the 16 oz box of pasta, I think I could have served eight easily.  Lots of leftovers for lunch this week.  Yay!!!

I agree. I let the sausage mixture simmer in cream to thicken then mixed pasta in. The sauce soaked into the pasta perfectly. This dish was wonderful. However, it was too spicy for our 7 year old. Our 5 year old loved it. May cut down on the red pepper flakes next time for my daughter. Thanks!

This recipe is a big hit with my family!  I followed the directions except used half spicy and half mild sausage (so I didn't add the red pepper), and used 1/2 cream and 1/2 half and half.  I made this last night and this morning, my husband and I are fighting over the leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent - simple and delicious!!!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  The 2nd time I made 3 additions which raised this dish to the next level (5 stars).  I added fresh basil, 1/2 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup of white wine. I have made this recipe several times since, to rave reviews every time, and the only thing I ever change now is the type of pasta. It's really good using rotelli or penne.

I feel a bit guilty rating this because I used chicken, but my husband had requested some sort of chicken pasta and this sounded good.  I also added mushrooms but otherwise, made the sauce true to the recipe.  We loved it!  It tasted so light and the addition of the red pepper flakes gave it a nice kick...definitely will make again and next time I'll use sausage:)

this was really good, and so easy.  i added a few tablespoons of parmesan cheese to the sausage/cream mixture and used fresh basil but other than that i followed it exactly.  this recipe will now be part of the regular rotation.

This is a FIVE star meal. It was so good! Beware: it is spicier than you think it will be, but the flavor is OMG amazing. I followed this recipe exactly (except I didn't use onions and used about a tbsp of dried onion flakes instead - didn't have any fresh on hand). I will absolutely be making this again. THANK YOU Linda Caroline for the fantabulous dinner we had last night!

read many reviews looking for something to do with fresh tomatoes from my garden.  decided to use fresh  instead of canned tomatoes, like someone else suggested.  had no sausage, so substituted hamburg and can't wait to use sausage the next time.  learned that 28oz of canned tomatoes is equivalent to almost 2cups fresh.  trying to abide by a ww diet - i substituted  fat free 1/2 &  1/2.  i found the recipe very similar to martha stewarts "bibba's meat sauce" recipe minus the calories and very delicious.  both my husband and i enjoyed the recipe (despite my substitutions) immensely.  thank you.

This was AMAZING. My husband and I loved it. I used chicken sausage that was stuffed with mozzerella cheese and sun dried tomato, and I sliced it. I also used italian style already diced tomatoes and did not add any parsley. Thanks for this amazing recipie, I am sure to make it many more times!

Quick, easy, and yummy!  I biased cut my sausage after grilling it whole and that was good.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used half n half instead.  I also subbed penne for the bowties- but it was still really good.  My husband really liked it, so that is always a good sign!

I guess I don't like sweet Italian sausage. And the consistency of the sauce was just too thin even when combined with pasta. The taste really was not great either.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!! I browned the sausage lightly and then sliced into thin slices (texture preference). Then I added back into the pan with the red pepper flakes (I use 1 tsp of pepper flakes because we like it with a little kick). I also used 1 pint of heavy cream and simmered for a bit longer to thicken...Like the submitter added later, you have to cook the pasta Al Dente then mix the pasta and sauce all together. The pasta will absorb the sauce. This is an absolute favorite in our home!!!

Great recipe! Will definitely make this again. I used whole wheat rotini and threw in some asparagus (1 inch pieces) with the pasta when it was almost done cooking.  This made for a great meal! Husband loved it.

So quick & easy to make an absolutely delicious meal. The first time my husband tried this he said, "this tastes like a meal i would order off a menu in an expensive resturant! Good job babe" Neddless to say, this has became a family favorite! :)

I don't add the red pepper flakes since the sausage is spicy enough. But, that is a personal preference. Yes, I do sprinkle parmesan cheese on it, too.

I used left over grilled italian sausages, cut up in small pieces. That way I didn't have any grease. Sauteed onion, green pepper & garlic with the sausage. Added cherry tomatoes I had canned along with heavy cream. Turned out really good & very colorful. Great way to use left overs

This is a fantastic recipe and a huge hit at our house.  Even our picky 13 year old will eat it, in spite of the onions!  For the tomatoes, I've used both diced and crushed and it's wonderful either way.  I also substitute half of the sausage with spicy sausage.  If you're looking for fewer calories, this is also great with turkey italian sausage.  The only other change I make is to use basil instead of parsley (dried works great since this is what I usually have).

My sister introduced me to this dish. I am IN LOVE with it! I've made it several times since then. We use hot sausage instead of sweet, because we like it better. We also leave out the parsley since it's really just for granish. We use the canned diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings and it comes out great! I would suggest not cooking the sausage in oil. No need for it. Also, if you rehead the leftovers, just pour a little more heavy cream over it before you pop it in the microwave. DELICIOUS!

I was suprised how well this turned out. The cream makes such a big difference and the left overs are amazing! I've been eating this non stop for 2 days. I did everything as the recipe states with one addition. I added half a bell pepper for color. Thank you soooo much!

Oh! My! I made this once (very recently) but with ground beef instead of the sausage. My fiance LOVED THIS! I really like it too. Even the kids ate some. There was a lot left after serving, but that didn't last long. There ended up being no leftovers.

This meal was super delicious! I used mild turkey sausage and whole wheat pasta so I could splurge on the heavy cream. It's hard NOT to add cheese but you really do not need it. I ate the leftovers for days!

I made this for dinner tonight. I did make a couple of alterations based on my family's tastes. I added a can of miled chopped green chiles, a little more salt, and some parmesan cheese. Great recipe without the changes as well.

Excellent dish. I added Italian seasoning and used dried parsley instead of fresh ones.  Also reduced cream to 1 cup for lesser calories.

This was so delicious!  I used chicken sausage and substituted half and half and a couple TBS cornstarch for the heavy cream, since I was out of cream.  I also didn't have the exact tomatoes but plain diced worked fine.  I added a little green pepper for color and flavor. My kids couldn't get enough!  Thank you.

Fantastic and easy recipe! Sauce was a bit too thin but if you let it sit for a while before serving, you should be fine. Also,to cut down on cook time (and grease), I cut out the oil as the sausage has enough fat and I cooked the onions WITH the sausage!

This recipe is great! I read all the reviews prior to making it and saw that a lot of people thought the sauce was too thin. The recipe states to simmer the cream mixture until it thickens and then add the pasta. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU! I simmered the mixture for the full 10 minutes and it was still very thin. I figured I would give it a shot and went ahead and added the cooked pasta anyway. After adding the pasta and heating through, the sauce thickened right up. That being said, do simmer the mixture the full 8-10 minutes before adding the pasta but do not over cook in fear that your sauce is too thin as this will over cook your tomatoes. Once you add your pasta the sauce will be sure to thicken!

This is one of our favorites, not a fan of traditional sausage so I'll buy the link sausage and cut that up. We've also tried it with shrimp and chicken, plus a diced jalapeno for extra heat. So yummy!!

This is quick and delicious!!!!  I'm on a diet and sick of bland.  This was low cal (with a few exchanges) and extremely tasty!  WAY better than my frozen "diet" lunches!!  I used whole grain pasta, no oil, just plain diced tomatoes (because that's what I had on hand), fat free half and half instead of heavy cream, and added a couple tablespoons of minced fresh basil as well as the parsley.  I love this dish!  Thanks very much for sharing, Linda.  As for other comments, yes it is a thin sauce but noodles suck up the sauce.  If you leave the noodles el dente (just a little firm still) and finish cooking them in the sauce, it turns out perfect!

This was absolutely delicious! I fed 6 teenagers and 3 adults and doubled the recipe...NONE left! Served with a Caesar Salad and garlic bread. Also added about 8 fresh chopped basil leaves to the sauce.  That is all I changed.  One of the best ever!

Ok, like all my other reviews i made this as written before i made any changes. I really enjoy cream with diced tomatoes. I made this with regular pasta, and heavy cream, which was great of course!! i then made it with whole grain pasta, 1/2 and 1/2, and just a little bit of sausage (i think the recipe calls for too much sausage). I still thought it was excellent. Of course it depends on your taste. I think it is a winner either as written or in the lower fat version.

This was really good. I was nervous making it, wondering if the sauce would thicken up enough for me. But that was no problem, perfect thickness. I made modifications all throughout the recipe. I used light whipping cream, mild italian sausage and I only crumbled up one and half links because my husband and I aren't too big on sausage. Because I used less sausage there was no grease to drain. I would add just a little bit more sausage next time but only a pinch more. I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and quickly started scooping most of them out of the pan. That was a TON of diced tomatoes and we're not big on those either. I used a pasta shape that I never used before and it was perfect! SOOO glad I didn't use the bow tie, I never liked that one too much. I used a shape called Campanelle by Barilla. If you can find it, I highly suggest it. I seasoned the sausage very lightly with the crushed red pepper flakes and garlic powder. When I was adding the pasta to the creamy sausage and tomato mixture I was careful to stir after each addition and noticed that you don't want the cream mixture to get TOO thick on you because it continues to thicken with the pasta. Just something to keep in mind. Now after tasting it I can see next time I want to add a little more sausage and more crushed red pepper flakes. Heat and zestiness work well in this dish. Because of that I would skip garlic bread as a side dish and go with a cool crisp salad. That would pair really well with it.

Great recipe as is. But to cut fat, I skipped the oil, half the sausage, drained and rinsed it. I also used skim milk instead of heavy cream and thickened it a little with corn starch. I also added extra garlic and added a 10oz. package of spinach. Real good recipe to fool around with to suit your taste.

I LOVE this recipe.  Super easy!  And sooooo good.  I have made this twice now.  I used organic chicken sausage and lots of fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley and small amount of rosemary and thyme).  Next time I will use less sausage (8oz) and another can of tomatoes. Just a personal preference... I was searching for bites with more tomatoes.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!! Try this one, you won't be disappointed!

So good and easy! Everyone loved it. The sausage was a little much, I would use less next time but that is totally personal preference. Also, definitely drain the grease before adding the cream. Was a big hit!

Fabulous, my family asks for this often.  I make it with turkey italian sausage for less calorie guilt and use milk rather than cream. Still yummy! Thanks to the creative chef who came up with this.

This is a fabulous recipe! I marinated baby portobellos overnight in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and garlic. Cut them into bite sized chunks and pan fry them quickly before adding them to the sauce for simmering. My family and dinner guests raved about this meal! It's easy to prepare, and it makes a pretty presentation with fresh bread and salad to round out the meal. :)

This recipe is a family favorite! I have made it many, many times. I have made this exactly as the recipes states and found it delicious! I have also tried other reviewers hints but still find for the most part this recipe is spot on. I have made with both sweet Italian sausage and hot Italian sausage-somtimes I have used a combination of both. We are a family that tends to like things on the spicy side. I stick with the canned plum tomatoes- I don't feel it's any tremendous work to chop. I do a simple rough chop. I personally find this recipe flavorful.  I do drain some of the grease before adding the cream. It is easy to make. We are a house hold of 6 and on nights when I work late both my husband and my daughters have made it with great results for the rest of the family. Thanks Linda for a great recipe!

I thought this was delicious. The sauce ended up a little bland and thin so I think next time I'll add some corn starch and more spices. Other than that---amazing.

Big hit! And I used vegetarian Italian sausage sliced instead of crumbled! It was the Field Roast brand which is spicy and very tasty.

I have been following this recipe for over a year and it's the meal I make when I have something to celebrate.  SOOOOOOO delicious!!  I'm not a huge fan of tomatoes, so I use sun-dried tomatoes instead and I LOVE the tangy flavor they add.  Be patient with the cream sauce -- it will thicken!  Also, half and half doesn't seem to work very well.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a couple minor changes.  I left out the red pepper flakes.  I used italian turkey sausage instead of pork, half & half instead of cream, diced italian tomatoes instead of whole, and I added some chopped spinach.  I also topped it with a little parmesan cheese.  It was excellent, even my picky sister and 2 year old enjoyed it!  Will definately be making this one again.

Love this dish. I prepare it exactly as written, though I do sub the heavy cream for fat free half and half. It has become a staple in my home of picky eaters!

This dish is an absolute favorite in my house. I used the sweet ground sausage rather than in the casings, which I don't think makes any difference. I also used half and half rather than heavy cream, only because it's what I had on hand. The first time I made it, I only made those 2 changes and it was very good, but a little on the spicy side for me and my son. We're spicey hot wimps. So the next time I cut the red pepper flakes in half and it was perfect. It had just enough kick for us but still delicious. Great recipe so quick and easy to make. Thanks for sharing. EDIT: Made this recipe with ground turkey due to having a friend who doesn't eat sausage and it was just as good!

Wonderful recipe; my husband never goes for seconds, but he did for this meal! Only tweak I did was add baby spinach before the tomatoes and cream. Made it perfect.

Tasty, quick, and easy.

Based on the recommendations of other reviewers, I used the oil from the sausage to saute' the onions rather than add olive oil. I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I also added a bit of frozen spinach for color, flavor, and nutrition.

This dish was really tasty and I'm sure I will make it again and again.

This was a simple recipe, but I doubt I will make it again without major changes.  My two grandsons (4.5 and 22 mos) would not even touch it.  My son in law, who eats pretty much anything, thought it was ok, but not at all filling.  

I like the general idea of this recipe, and think that it might be one of those dishes that taste better the next day, but still............  I may try it again using sun dried tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes.  I had high hopes for this so I was pretty disappointed.

Just tried this recipe today for a 25th anniversary surprise dinner for my wife when she came home from work.  I improvised a bit and used grilled salmon instead of the sausage.  I also sauteed baby bella button mushrooms and spinach to add a little twist.  The meal turned out fabulous!  Thanks for the inspiration.  Definitely a winner!

Fantastic! We also added a can of the tomatoes with green chilis because the cream was pretty sweet. This really made it for us. I will make this often.  :D

I just made this for dinner and we thought it was delicious!!  I did put my tomatoes in the blender to puree them.  I don't like chunk tomatoes with pasta, just my preference.  I also added some parm cheese at the end.  Sauce could have been a little thicker, but this dish was very tasty.

Great recipe. Easy, delicious, and open for variation. One great addition to this sauce is parm. cheese. Add about 1/4 cup after the cream has thickened a little bit. Adds another note to the flavor.

This is so good! I didnt have bow ties so I used shells. It was great just the same. I also only had crushed plum tomatoes, so I couldnt drain it. I used 75% of the can. SOO yummy!!

This is the first time I am reviewing a recipe here.
I have to say this is one of the tastiest pasta dishes I've had in a long time. My family asks for it again and again.
My additions are parmesan cheese in the sauce, then I put half into 9X13 glass baking dish a layer of mozzarella cheese, repeat with remaining pasta and sauce then more mozzarella. Bake at 350 - 400 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes. delicious.

This meal was delicious! My husband said that this is as good as a dish you'd have at an Italian restaurant (and believe me he's been to a lot). Next time I'll add a little more sausage other than that it was perfect! Great flavor!

I originally made this recipe exactly as it was written. EXCELLENT AS IS!  I have been making it for the last couple of years with the only change being increasing the amount of sausage, sweet Italian. I have two huge sons who love it!  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, without any modifications.  My husband loved this dish!  I thought it was very good, but am not sure it's worth the fat intake.  I'll probably try making again using half and half or milk, to lower the fat content.

Awesome recipe! I made it as is, but I used ground sweet sausage. I just figured it would be easier then taking the sausage out of the casing. Very tasty and the family enjoyed it. Thanks!

Rarely is a from scratch recipe so easy to make AND so tasty.  I think this is my new favorite.  Realized when browing the sausage that I had almost 20oz of sausage, so I just added a little more cream, and the whole pound box of pasta.  Came out great.  Awesome the way it is, but I might try a little fresh spinach next time.  If you like it spicier, just add a little more pepper flakes.  I wouldn't trade the sweet italian sausage for hot italian though.  The sweet isn't as overwhelming, and I think it works better with the cream sauce.  Great recipe.

This is so easy and full of flavor, I undercook my pasta a bit, add it to the sauce and let it all meld together before serving.

This recipe was sooo good!  the only thing I changed was I used Hot Italian sausage because that was what I had in the freezer, however, this made it too spicy for my 6 year old but me and the hubby couldn't get enough!  Definite keeper!!  Next time I will try with the sweet, but not sure it will compare to the Hot sausage!

This is a go to recipe for me.  I've served it at pot lucks and fancy dinner parties, always to rave reviews.  It was great made exactly as written. I have made it with canned crushed tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes drained when I didn't have plum tomatoes on hand and it was still outstanding.

Holy Moly - this was great and the kids (picky picky picky) asked for seconds. My wife and I loved it just as much if not more.  I threw in a little pesto just because I had it. Will use half and half next time. I also used diced tomatos and turkey sausage. This was a homerun !!

My husband cannot get enough of this dish!!! I made this the first time two weeks ago and he's asked me to make it 4 times!!! Once I used italian sausage and the other times I used green onion Sausage and I added a pinch of red peper flakes but I'm in New Orleans and most of our food is a bit on the spicy side!

Good, very quick and easy to make. We left in the tomatoes and omitted the onion. A tad on the spicy side, but made a good meal for a change of pace. Thanks!

My sauce was quite drippy, but then I reread the recipe and saw that I was supposed to drain the tomatoes, which I didn't.  I thought it was good, hearty, and easy, but lacked a little something.  Next time will add bell pepper, and also maybe sprinkle with basil rather than parsley.  Great starting recipe, though.  Hubby will love it, I know.

I followed the directions exactly and it turned out PERFECT!!!!  My family loved it and requested that I make it again-soon.  I agree that if you pour the cooked pasta into the sauce and warm throughly that the sauce will not be runny.

Awesome. I love spice so we made it with spicy sausage and although it was really good, I have a feeling that if I had used the sweet sausage the recipe called for it would have been even better. I have used a ton of recipes from this web site and this is only the third that I don't think needs tweaking. My DH was skeptical because of the cream but he loved it too.

OMG! This was absolutely horrible! So horrible that I ate three bowls of it and there are no leftovers.  *smile*  It was delicious! I am kicking myself for being safe and not doubling the dish.

I didn't really change anything, but I did use a little less of things as I was a bit skeptical.  I just didn't see how the heavy cream would make it good, so I used a little less. I did use hot turkey sausage, but I use turkey products for whatever pasta dish I make.  I also added spinach.  But that's all I did differently. 

This is definitely something I will add to my rotation of meals. Thank you!

Wow. This is really good. Following the advice of a few other raters, I also used 1/2 and 1/2 rather than cream. I used ground italian sausage, and it was really good. Instead of Roma tomatoes, I used what I had on hand...which was Italians stewed toms and diced toms. :) I will definitely be making this again!

We loved this slightly spicy, creamy dish.  Easy and fast to make, great for a weeknight supper.  The only change I made was to add a sprinkle of dried basil to the sauce.

I got Italian sausage on sale so I tried this recipe, I did add spinch and it was very good.  I also used half and half since I had it on hand. Next time I will us a thinner noodle since my husband prefers angel hair spaghetti.

This dish was amazing and so quick and easy to make! I found ground sweet italian sausage, which made it a little more convenient. My entire family loved it (even my picky Italian husband)! I'll definitely will be making this again.

I was looking for something different to do with sausage and this was perfect!! I used hot italian sausage so I omitted the red pepper flakes and it was delicious. This was one meal I was happy with having leftovers!

Yummy!  I used turkey sausage and added ALOT of red pepper flakes because I like it spicy.  I also only added 1 cup of heavy cream and sprinkled a little bit of parmsean cheese on it and it was delicious!  I will be making this again.

Awesome!
I used Italian diced tomatoes vs the plum tomatoes. I also used fat-free 1/2 and added spinach. Next time around I will try it with Penne pasta and Jenni-o sweet Italian sausage. This will be added to our sunday night rotation.

Loved this recipe the only problem I had is that the sauce never thickened, but it still tasted great. I also added some italian seasoning to the sause.

Sooo good! I used mild italian sausage instead (thats what I had on hand) and used 1/4 of a teaspoon of red pepper flake since we're not huge spicy fans. Other than that followed it exactly and it was amazing...thanks for sharing!

This was outstanding! Restaurant quality. The only things I did different was use sweet turkey sausage and sliced them. I also threw in a handful of romano cheese. Otherwise made exactly as written. Will make this again.

IT was delicious and so easy and the perfect amount of seasoning.   I added chicken to it and i know my sister did it and she added mushrooms to hers.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was actually very good.  My boyfriend loved it!  I followed the recipe to a T except that I added extra seasonings.  I added a lot more salt and garlic salt and I think it could have even used a little more.  Overall, a very good and easy recipe to make.

GREAT!! Changes: I used a can of italian diced tomatoes, reduced crused pepper to 1/4 tsp., I didn't have heavy cream so I used a substitution(melt 1/3 cup butter in sauce pan, then add 3/4 cup low-fat milk and 1 Tbs. flour to thicken sauce). I left out the onions and parsley since kids do not like either. Very good!!

Made this last night with my husband. We LOVED it! Only thing I would change next time would be to use just a little less red peper flake, but other than that it was delicious! Can't wait to make this again.

I was so excited to make this recipe. I finally made it last night and it was amazing! Our picky 7 year old loved it as well as my husband and I. I did not have heavy cream, so I substituted 1% milk, butter, and flour and made a cream out of that. It worked great. I also added a whole onion, and fresh spinach. This recipe will be one I make again and again!

Another easy to make recipe that really hit the spot.  Stayed true to the recipe with the exception of using half and half with the intention of being on the health side, but counteracted by garnishing with Parmesan. Next time around, plan on using ground turkey sausage and like the idea of adding green peppers.

A little bland, I added some ground garlic,and sea salt which help liven it up a little bit.
 I also used dried,and cherry tomatoes. I simmered them for 20 minutes drained,and coated them in olive oil,and Italian seasonings. Gives it a nice tangy tomato taste.
I think I will put peppered bacon in it next time!

This was awesome! The only modifications I made were that I used turkey sausage and rotini pasta because that is what I had on hand.  It was delicious!  A bit rich but expected with a creamy pasta like this!

This is a lovely dish.  For full flavor, imported Italian plum tomatoes are a must (I used Cento brand).  The consistency of this product contributes to a much richer and more intense flavor than domestic canned tomatoes provide.  The extra cost is well worth it.  The flavors are meant to be subtle, but for those who insist on cheese with Italian food, a side dish of Parmesan could be offered.  An added bonus is that the dish goes together quickly.  Thank you, Linda, for a great recipe!

AMAZING!!  My 10 year old ate 3 helpings and my husband and I loved it too!  It was so easy to make.  I did add extra cream because we are sauce loving people, and I used Garden Rotini noodles instead of bowtie.  Johnsonville now makes ground italian sausage so no messy skins to deal with either.  I will definately make this again and again!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is one of the best and easiest recipes ever! My family loved it and even the leftovers were gone by the next day! That never happens! The only substitution I made was on the tomatoes. I used a can of Hunts chopped tomatoes with garlic and Italian spices. Awesome Recipe!

My husband and I loved this as did our guests.  Made it pretty much exactly as stated the first time.  The second time I added some chopped up green bell peppers.

This was a great recipe. My husband loved it. He ate three plates of it. The only downfall is a mistake that I made in which I bought hot and spicy sausage instead of mild. It made it a little too spicy, but the flavors were there. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe has become added to our weekly menu. My kids LOVE it. I add a little more whipping cream and use diced tomatoes with garlic and basil. This recipe is very good and can be done quickly on a week night!

Great recipe! I did everything like the recipe says, except I had sage sausage and I couldn't find plum tomatoes in a can so I used diced tomatoes from a can. I will definitely make this again!

Just made this last night.  I substituted rigatoni pasta instead of bow tie, and left out the red peppers (kids), and it came out great!  My husband even went back for seconds!  Will make again :)

I made this recipe exactly as written. Came out very good. I think it could use a few extra spices, so I may try to follow some other reviews next time and add extra ingredients.

This was delicious!  I used a large can of Trader Joe's Marinara Sauce instead of the tomatoes.  I used a LOT more garlic and added a pkg of frozen spinach instead of the  parsley and a tsp of Italian spice.  The whole family loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is incredible!  Probably too spicy for little kids, but DH and I couldn't get enough.  The only thing I changed from the recipe was to add 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3, otherwise I followed the recipe just as written and it was perfect.  This is definitely going in to the rotation at my house.  Thank you!!!

Usually the first time I make a recipe I try to follow it to a T but unfortunately I didn't have sweet italian sausage, the italian plum tomatoes or fresh herbs so I used dry herbs (1 T fresh = approx 1 tsp dry), a regular mild italian sausage and 1 (14.5 oz) can of stewed italian style tomotoes & 1 (14.5 oz) can of diced italian style tomatoes instead.  Since my sausage already had a little spice to it I scaled back the red pepper flakes a bit (1 tsp instead of 2) & it turned out excellent.  Everyone went back for 2nds!  This was so quick and easy to prepare & the minor changes worked very well.  Will definately be implementing this into my regular rotation!

SO GOOD! Added butter while browning the meat. Used Italian turkey sausage instead, and followed the other reviews and put a little cornstarch (but it actually wasn't necessary). DELICIOUS. This makes me feel like I can actually cook! Haha.

Don't get me wrong- this is yummy.  But, for the cost of the meal and the calorie cost I expected a more complex flavor.  It basically tastes like spaghetti with cream in the sauce or kind of like lasagna.

Enjoyed this very much!  I used the ground Italian sausage and the petite diced Italian tomatoes, to save time.  I used fat free half and half for calorie purpose.  I did omit the red pepper flakes as I don't like hot or spicy foods.  Lots of comments on the sauce not being thick enough.  If you are not going to follow the recipe using the heavy cream, don't expect to have the same results.  Mine came out thinner but I used the half and half.  I will make this again and think I will add a small onion and green pepper to this.

I didn't really like it when I tried it after first making it. But when I had it the next day it was much better. I also used diced tomatos so I didn't have to cut anything. I also only used a cup of heavy cream and it was plenty of sauce.

Followed the recipes pretty much to the tee, except went light on the red pepper flakes, used crushed tomatoes and lite cream since that was all I had. Mine turned out alittle soupy but I am beginner cook so I don't doubt that was to my mistake. But my fiance loved it! And that means a lot since he's an italian food snob, raised by italian step-father and grew up in Jersey. Excellent recipe and very flexible!

Tastes like a 15 dollar dish from a restaurant. Let the sauce sit a little so it can thicken... Delicious though!

I also made this with sweet turkey sausage and fat free half and half.  It turned out delicious!  I otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Don't have anything to compare it to (as far as full fat version), but my family of 6 loved it!  This will definitely be made again and again, full of flavor, but not too overpowering for the kids (oh, I did leave out the red pepper flakes and let the adults add their own).

Made it last night....sauce turned our runny despite my simmering it for a long time.  But other than that, it was very tasty.  I used to make a recipe identical to this, but instead of crumbling the italian sausage, I cut it into bite sized pieces and browned it.  Also, instead of bow tie pasta, I used orecchiette (little ears) pasta.  That type of pasta really holds in the sauce!

This was a big hit and a delicious surprise.  I used 2 cans undrained fire-roasted diced tomatoes (in lieu of the plum tomatoes), and cut the heavy cream back to 1 cup.  And, I used turkey sausage instead of pork.  I left the sausage "meat ball-size" instead of crumbling it, and added 4 cups raw spinach.  Plenty for lefovers tomorrow night, which is a great thing!

Yum.....real nice change from spag and meat . I don't really care for sausage myself but it was good enough to eat a few pieces of it with my bow ties . I used a can of diced tomat to make it more kid friendly and cut the onions big so kids could pick out .  also i had to add way more spices . adults liked , and  two out of three kids liked. Adding to ratation . Thanks !

FABULOUS. I just used regular ground sausage, so it didn't have as sweet a flavor; definitely doubling it next time -- my husband ate enough for a family of four, and still wanted to take it to work the next day. :)

This was a nice surprise, I had never tried cream in a tomato sauce. My husband loved it, will definitely make it again. A good all around & different flavor. I did add a little bit of fresh chopped basil & oregano.

This was really good , a nice change from spaghetti. the olny change I made was with the noodles used ziti instead that's what I had on hand. Hubby ate the leftovers the next night for dinner even though I made a chicken pie. he said he meant to bring it to work for lunch and forgot it so that was what he thought about all day.

I thought this recipe was great!  Only mods were to add fresh basil, and use turkey Italian sausage.  Got fairly positive reviews from kids 2, 6,and 8.  I would say that is pretty darn good!

5/10 used premio sweet basil chopped up, very tasty.  followed all else the same except only used about 1 cup of cream.  1 1/2 seemed like too much. easy dinner.  red pepper flakes were good.

This is one of my husbands favorite meals.  I tried it out about a year ago for the first time and since then it is one of our regular meals.  He loves spicey food so I also use spicey italian sausage.  I have tried this out for other family members as well and they loved it as well.

Excellent recipe! I make this quite often and everyone who has tried it has liked it. Just a heads up, when adding the tomatoes, be sure to drain a majority of the sauce from the can and inside the tomato. Too much will make your pasta sauce watery. It may seem like there is not enough tomato to compensate for the cream, but I assure you that it is sufficient. Just stir well while simmering. Thank you for this great recipe!

So easy and so delicious! Great as leftovers, even tasted good cold one morning when I ate it for breakfast in a hurry (the things we do in college!) I used half and half to cut out a lot of the calories and fat but everything else I did the same. Going in my recipe book!

Update: This is still one of my favorite recipes on here and I make it fairly regularly. For an extra kick I sometimes use half spicy sausage mixed with sweet. This is definitely one the easiest and one of my favorite recipes!

This is one of my favorite pasta dishes. My husband loves it too and requests it often. I've made it many times. Sometimes, if I don't have any canned tomatoes, I'll use a jar of really good pasta sauce (Barilla, for example) or I'll make my own pasta sauce. For a healthier version, lately I have been using Italian turkey sausage and fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. The red pepper flakes give this dish a nice kick and once in a while I'll add just a touch more. Awesome recipe, thanks!

The kids wanted pasta, and this was a nice change from their usual request - spaghetti. I had some Chicken Sweet Italian Sausage from the farmer's market store nearby I wanted to use up, plus a box of whole grain bowties. I left out the red pepper flakes because of the kids, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. We really enjoyed this, and it was quick and easy, which is always a plus on busy weeknights.

This was delicious! I made a few changes due to personal preference and ingredients I had on hand: I used Italian turkey sausage, canned stewed tomatoes and only added about 1/2 cup of the cream. My husband said it was restaurant quality! Very tasty and easy!

Sausage is perfectly spiced, even if I had to take the casings off myself.   Way too much sausage compared to the amount of pasta. I'd cut the sausage in half.  And be sure to really drain the tomatoes and the fat from the sausage or the cream won't fully thicken.

Excellent recipe.  Tastes great and it doesn't get any easier.  I used 3/4 lb. of hot italian sausage and omitted the red pepper flakes.  I also subbed half & half for the cream and reduced the amount to 3/4 C which was plenty.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will definitely make this again

Wow, this was a hit!  Even my picky 4 year old ate it.  This was a wonderful recipe and didn't substitue anything.  Great flavors.  I did omit the salt, and didn't really need the olive oil I think, but besides that it was GREAT!

Awesome pasta recipe!  I used Italian seasoned chicken sausage, italian seasoned diced tomatoes, and added sliced mushrooms to the recipe.  Left everything else as is and it turned out great!  Will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and we enjoyed it.  The second time I sauteed sliced fresh mushrooms with the onions and garlic and added fresh baby spinach the last few minutes, just enough time to slightly wilt.  Garnished with fresh basil and fresh parm.  Served with a salad and garlic bread sticks - restaurant quality.  Thank you for sharing this versatile recipe with us!

I was a little skeptical about this recipe after reading some of the reviews but I need not have been.  I do cook my sausages separate on a griddle, to help reduce excess fat.  Also added red and green peppers along with the onion, garlic and crushed pepper, which I cooked in the skillet along with a spray of olive oil.  I had no problems with excess fat, greasy or thin sauce.  I did add a little seasoning to finish off the taste.

I think this recipe is delicious and doesn't require any changes.  I don't make it often because of the calories and fat content, but when I do I enjoy it thoroughly.  Had the kids in my Foods and Nutrition class make it and there were no leftovers!

I doubled this recipe and substituted 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground italian sausage. I also added sauteed mushrooms and served with shaved parmesan cheese. Very Yummy!

I was skeptical...but this turned out like something from a fancy restaurant!    To avoid thin/greasy orange sauce, I whisked in 1 T of flour in the skillet with the veggies and sausage - it mixed with the sausage grease to create a little roux.  I let the flour cook for a minute, and then I added fat free half and half - it thickens in 1-2 minutes, and then I tossed with the bowties.    Also, I used canned diced Italian seasoned tomatoes, which I would probably double next time because they were delish in the recipe.  A generous handful of Parmesan completes the presentation!

I used two cans of diced tomatoes and a 1/4 cup of sun-dried tomatoes to add a little zing.  I also had to add a little salt to ours.  What a delicious dinner.  I added the pasta to the sauce, removed it from the heat and then left it for 10 minutes.  The pasta soaked up all of the delicious creamy sauce.  I hope there are leftovers for tomorrow!

I love this pasta. You can use any type pasta and its always delicious! Be careful with the red pepper. If you add more than is called for it does get spicy! My kids love this pasta too.

This was a great, super-easy recipe!  I made it just as the recipe called, but doubled the red pepper flakes to kick up the spice a little bit :)  I made entirely too much, so I got to enjoy it as leftovers throughout the week.   So simple and tasty, I'll be making it again!

This one passed the Family test! I added three cups of fresh baby spinach, half a cup of ricotta cheese and a half cup of sour cream used half n half instead of heavy cream and no parsley I also added a few diced sun dried tomatoes and used canned diced tomatoes I had on hand. Turned out fabuloso! Can't wait to try this one again! Next time I'm going to add some sliced mushrooms as hubby suggested!

I tried this recipe yesterday for dinner, and it was absolutely delicious! My husband kept raving about it. (which is rare for him) I will have to say that it is the best recipe I have tried in a very long time. I have passed the recipe to my friends, as I know they will love it too. Thank you so much for this incredible recipe...  I will be making it again in a couple of weeks. It is certainly good enough to impress guests, and soooo easy!!

The only things I do differently are simmer the pepper flakes, onion and garlic in the oil before adding ground mild Italian sausage, and use 2 cans of Italian diced tomatoes. This is so good - the whole family enjoys it!

GREAT pasta recipe. Only change was to use a little hot sauce instead of the pepper flakes. As well, I used dried parsley  instead of fresh. Wonderful flavour - stick to bow-tie pasta- it somehow fits the sauce perfectly.

I thought this was pretty good. Made as written. However the hubby really didn't like it, so I guess this won't be joining our regular rotation. His biggest complaint was that the flavors didn't really blend together, just tasted like sausage and pasta. I thought it was a nice change from our usual flavors, but oh well.

I made this pretty much as is (used spagetti instead ofbowties, and used leftover grilled sausage that I sliced up) and it was delicious,as well as quick and easy.  I really like that there is alot of room to make changes and mix it up.  Im going to make it with shrimp for dinner with friends next week.  YUMMY!

We really enjoyed this! A definite 'do over'. Might go less on the cream as it took a while to reduce. Also, it is very rich so it is not something we would have very often. I tasted before adding the cream and it would be good that way on the pasta as well! First time I've made a real cream sauce and this is restaurant quality that I can do at home.

Easy to make and very versatile! I added diced plum tomatoes and fresh mushrooms after onion and garlic had time to soften.  At the end, I wilted a ton of fresh topped spinach and some parmesan cheese into the sauce.  Used whole grain pasta.  A really delicious, warm, hardy way to eat lots of veggies while still feeling fulfilled from the pasta and meat.  Thank You!

This was pretty good. It was nice to try something different.  I used fat free half and half, threw in some spinach, used canned diced tomatoes and added italian seasoning.  I had to use a little cornstarch for thickness but the whole wheat pasta soaked up the sauce pretty good.  I bet with heavy cream it is a 5 star.  I just couldnt do all the calories.

My five year old helped me make this for dinner tonight and it is fantastic. Simple, fast and tastes great. I had little ones to please so I used oregano instead of red pepper flakes. Also had a bit of parmesan to use up in the fridge so I tossed that in the sauce at the end. My only caveat is make this in a big, two-handled "family" skillet if you want to toss the pasta with the sausage sauce before serving. I underestimated and used a too-small skillet. We loved it!

This was enjoyed by everyone in my family. My family likes spicy, so I added a little more pepper flakes and also a half teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  It was quick and easy.  I won't make it often, due to the amount of cream in it, but it is definitely a keeper!

Very good!  I substituted grilled chicken for the sausage as preference.  I didn't want to go to the store, so I also substituted evaporated milk (liquid kind) for the cream and diced, fresh tomatoes for canned (sauteed with onion and garlic, after onion caramelized).  Added juice from 1/2 lemon because it tasted too creamy.  It went very well with my homemade whole wheat pasta.

This was easy and delicious!  Made it with penne instead of bowties and was still very good.

Using Italian sausage is fairly new to us but with recipes like this, I have a feeling I'll be cooking with it a great deal more. We really enjoyed this. Thanks for the recipe.

This is very good. I was feeling lazy so I just sliced my sausage instead of taking them out of the casing. Also my hubby is not a fan of parsley so I left that out. Next time I will use fresh tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe I will be making this again.

Very yummy! I loved the flavour of the sauce. I made as directed except for replacing the heavy cream with half and half and using whole wheat pasta. I will definitely be making again.

One of my families favorite dishes!!  The only thing that I do different is that I use whole wheat pasta to try to make it a tad bit healthier...any little bit helps, right??

This is a really scrumptious recipe! Also a good base recipe. I am not a fan of ground sausage of any type usually so I cut a link of kielbasa into quarter size medallions and browned them according to recipe adding extra garlic, onion, and chopped peppers (red, green, yellow, orange) I use peppers all the time so I only took as much as I wanted from each pepper and saved the rest for later. I add a few seasonings and then some extra cream and a bit of broth. Very good!

I made this dish and it is now one of my husband's favs. For a little tip, wait 5-8 mintues to serve. The sauce is a little thicker and the dish comes together a bit better.

My husband actually said this was the best thing I've ever made for him!  I cook a LOT and I'm a pretty good cook!  So I think that says a lot about this recipe!  The only change I made was to use italian seasoned diced tomatoes, I think it just makes sense rather than buying them whole and chopping them  And adding the pasta back into the sauce is a MUST!  The pasta absorbs some of the extra liquid and it makes it so thick and creamy!!  Now, if I can just find a way to make it a little more healthy!

This was excellent. I cooked Italian sausages, sliced them and added them to the sauce instead of the crumbled sausage. I used coffee cream with good results.

This was great. Immediately everyone told me to save that recipe. I'd suggest you use a little more sausage and get medium to hot sausage instead of mild to bump up the flavor a notch. Excellent. Agree with all, cream is the key. (even though I used fat free half and half)

This was okay.  It is missing something and didn't have enough pizzazz for me.  My husband said it was good.  I may try it again and add something else to it to give it more flavor.

This is ABSOLUTELY a keeper!! It's easy and fast to make (my 2 favorite things) and has such great flavor. I made a few changes: added a little Italian seasoning and basil, and used evaporated milk since that's what I had on hand. I added a little parm cheese to the sauce which thickened it up perfectly. My only regret is that I didnt make this sooner. Kudos to whoever submitted this recipe.

Very tasty. Not too creamy. I will add parm next time. I was afraid of the red pepper and didn't use too much. I will increase the amount next time.

This was fantastic! I followed other reviews and opted for the half & half instead of heavy cream. Used 2 cups of the half & half and added a little bit of cornstarch. Tasted great! I also omitted the parsley. Very warm and delicious! My husband loved it!

An excellent recipe that we make regularly.  We use half and half instead of cream because it cuts calories.  We also use fresh plum tomatoes.

I have made this dish many, many times now & it is great.  My husband likes it & he is not big on cream sauces & our son loves it.  He would probably eat this every night if he could.  The only things I do differently, is to use whole milk instead of heavy cream; since I always have that in my fridge.  If the sauce seems thin just mix cornstarch in some water & add small amounts of that in until you get the consistency that you want; just like making gravy  :)  I will also add mushrooms or some type of vegetable on occasion; depending on what I have in my kitchen, but I always use the Sweet Italian Sausage.

Easy, easy, easy to prepare and never fails to impress.  I have tweaked it slightly for my own tastes but the original as written is 5 stars too.  I like to use hot sausage instead of sweet and then omit the red pepper flakes.  I also  finish the sauce with 2-3 Tablespoons of butter (It's already loaded with calories from the sausage, pasta, and cream so why not just go all the way with it!)

This was one of those recipes I was really excited to make.  And it was just as good as I expected!  I didn't change anything - although next time I will use turkey sausage and lighter cream.  The issue - my husband tried it and wouldn't even eat it!  He's really picky and doesn't like cream sauces.  He's eaten them before, so I thought it might work.  Go figure.  If I make again, it will be for company or a lot of people.

My husband who is typically a picky eater really enjoyed this dish. I used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream as I didn't have any and because I'm trying to cook healthier for my family.  This dish will be added to rotation.

This was okay. I'm a sauce person, which makes me a bit biased, as my biggest complaint about this dish was that it doesn't make a lot of sauce. When made as written, the sauce is the kind that clings to each specific piece of pasta rather than the type of sauce that leaves remains that you could sop up with bread :) If you make the recipe correctly (add the pasta to the sauce and heat through), the sauce is definitely not runny. In fact, for someone who loves saucy pasta dishes, this dish could be accused of being too dry.   To try to lighten it up a bit, I used half and half in place of the heavy cream. I used petite diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning in place of the Italian plum tomatoes. I left out the red pepper flakes and used penne instead of bow tie pasta. I used smoked sausage instead of sweet Italian sausage.

My husband does not like cream sauces, but I made this and he gave it a try.  Lets just say he and my 7 year old request it often.  My son just asked the other day why I haven't made it lately, so the ingredients are on my shopping list.  Simple for me to make when I get home from work too!

We all loved the dish! I wish the sauce was a little thicker but other than that no complaints.

I really liked this dish...I used HOT italian sausage and while myself and hubby loved the little kick it gave the dish, my kids did not...so next time I will use the sweet...other than that it was easy to prepare and yummy

There was just something missing from this dish.  The only thing I changed was to use hot italian sausage instead of sweet. I have more leftovers then I know what to do with.  Will not be repeating this recipe.

My husband loved this recipe he said he felt as if he were eating in a restaurant. It came out so rich and creamy I used regular pasta thought cause I didn't bow tie. Next time I'm going to try it with shrimp instead os sausage.

Pretty solid. I used rotini vice bowties and added some sauteed bell peppers. I think it could use a little more spice in the sauce, or use the HOT Italian sausage.

I made it just like the recipe said and it came out wonderful.  My children and my husband ate it all up.  My husband is rating this as one of his favorite meals.  It was very tasty.  I think it tastes best freshly made - it loses some of the fresh taste when it is reheated.

This is really good and easy.  I halved the recipe and used a pre-cooked italian sausage (didn't realize it was pre-cooked when I bought it) and it turned out just fine.  I still removed the casings and chopped the sausage up a bit.  It was not watery or greasy.  I added a bit of parmesan cheese to the sauce and it was great.  Will be making this again.

I can't believe as simple as this recipe was, it taste like a gourmet pasta dish! I didn't have any plum tomatoes, so i used Italian diced tomatoes. Cooked the rest of the recipe as stated! Everyone went for seconds or thirds. Highly recommended!!!

Wow this came out good! My two year old wasn't a huge fan but he's not a huge fan of much that isn't mac and cheese! My seven year old loved it as did my husband. It was really easy to throw together and smelled awesome cooking. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe but next time I may try using half and half or light cream to make it a bit more waist line friendly and maybe throw in some spinach as well. Seems like a very adaptable recipe.

This was good, but certainly not the best ever.  I did make some changes, so maybe thats why.  I didn't have tomatoes, so used 1 can paste with some marinara, I used almond milk instead of heavy cream, and red wine turkey sausage as that is what I had on hand.  Turned out good, was definitely a good and very filling dinner but was a bit of a let down from the reviews, etc.  The spice was a nice touch. Thanks!

I made for my brother and so.  Both enjoyed it, but neither has asked me to make it again.  I did switch to fat free 1/2 & 1/2.  41g of fat per serving is a little to much.

This has become a staple at our house.  I like to cook the sausage mixture in larger batches and freeze smaller portions of it so that the dish comes together quickly on busy weeknights.  The red pepper flakes really give it great flavor.  It's a hearty, yummy dish.

I have made this a number of times over the past couple of years. My husband and i absolutely love it!!! I did make one small change and use plain milk instead of cream. I made with cream the first time and it was a little to rich for me....but was really yummy! Using milk doesn't make it as thick but it's still really really good! I have found that Perri Italian Sweet Sausages are the best. Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW.  Only change I made was to add a little chopped fresh tarragon (add a bit more sweetness), and we couldn't get enough of it.  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was awesome! My family loved it.  I am new to all recipes and hate when people rate a recipe only after changing things but this was great as is. Confession:  I did take another reviewer's idea about the spinach (I added fresh) and I also added feta at the end only because I had it in the fridge and needed to use it up.  It turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be making this again.

I used mild Italian sausage, a bit of basil, and upped the cream to two cups, and shell shaped pasta.  It was absolutely devine.

This was so easy and so good!  My husband and I both loved it and I can't wait to have some leftovers for lunch today!  The sauce does seem thin while it's cooking, but I thought it seemed fine after mixing it in with the pasta. Only changes I made were:  used crushed red pepper instead of flakes, used 1 can diced tomatoes. Great recipe!  Will definitely add to my rotation.

Absolutely Fantastic recipe and very simple to make!!  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with garlic/orgeno and basil.  My only issue with this dish is that the sauce is very thin - pasta does not soak it up!! Next time I will add some cheese to thicken a little, my husband had to grab a spoon for the sauce...but he would have drank it if I allowed him to do so at the table:-)) He loved it soo much he snuck down in the middle of the night to get a few bites! A keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! Instead of tomatoes and parsley, I substituted with roasted bell peppers and basil. I also replaced half the heavy cream portion with 2% milk. My bf liked it so much he took it to work the next day! Thanks!

This pasta dish was great!!  I followed recipe and it tasted delicous!  I will definitely make it again.   The only change I will make, even though my husband loved it that way, is no red pepper next time.  I don't like spicy.

A little too high on the pasta side of the pasta to sauce ratio for my taste, but the sauce alone is quite good.  I had enough for a second meal, so I packed it into a casserole and froze it.  Thawed it, added a thin layer of sauce and a little fresh cheese and baked it, and it was even better.

Delicious!  Tastes like it came from a restaurant!  I used two 14.5oz cans of diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano and onions, in place of the tomatoes this recipe called for just to save on time.  The leftovers were really good too!

I couldn't bring myself to drain that good juice from the tomatoes, so I didn't and won't in future either.  I subbed half-and-half for the heavy cream.  Very good!

This was FANTASTIC. The only thing I did different from the original recipe was to use a can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes and I used mild sausage instead of sweet.

This is one of my favorite recipes!! Thank you so much to whoever came up with this. Some tricks I've tried to make it a little more healthy because I eat it at least once a week are to use turkey Italian Sausage, whole-wheat pasta in place of regular bow-tie, and instead of all heavy cream, use 1 cup skim milk with 1tbs cornstarch and 1tbs flour to thicken (for proportions) or use half of that mixture with the heavy cream  if you don't like that texture. The whole wheat pasta makes this dish even more filling, and these 3 changes can cut out a lot of calories and fat without loosing hardly any flavor.

I LOVED this dish! I followed the recipe exactly with only one exception. Unfortunately I am counting calories so I substituted the yummy heavy cream that I SO wanted to use for hood fat free simply smart half and half. Guess what..It was still delicous! I can't wait to make this one again. Thank you for the great recipe.

I love this dish - a girlfriend made it for me one night when I was in town visiting, and I liked it so much that I went home and made it the next night for my family! I'm on WW, and needed to make it friendly...so, I only use 1 tbsp. olive oil, I use turkey sausage and season it with basil, red pepper flakes and salt, and I use crushed tomatoes and fat free half & half. Going this route makes it 7 points for a 1 cup serving!!!

This was delicious! I made a few changes in the recipe however - instead of using crumbled sausage, I used fresh sausage that I sliced. I also added some sliced red peppers when I added the onions. It turned out great! Will definitely make this again :)

A nice change from pasta with tomato sauce. I agree that there seemed to be to much sausage and will reduce it next time. I didn't cook the sausage in the oil. I added 1 28oz can of whole tomatoes(chopped), sauce and all and my own blend of Italian spices. I did not have heavy cream so I used 1/2 cup cream cheese and 1 cup 2% milk. Any pasta will do. It was so delicious!!

Very good recipe.  The last time I made it, it turned out to be a bit soupy.  I may have added a bit too much cream, but I don't think so.  This is a basic recipe that can be adapted to different proteins or vegetables - even vegetarian.  Yum!

Very good, but a little time consuming to make.  To make healthier I substituted, turkey sausage, and fat free half and half (in place of heavy cream).  Needed to add a little extra cornstarch to make set up but very delicious.

This was AMAZING, possibly my favorite recipe on this site. Absolutely delicious. As I always do, I added the listed seasonings to taste because I love a lot of flavor, but other than that followed it exactly and received rave reviews. Thank you so much for such a great recipe that my boyfriend now asks for all of the time haha.

I read the other reviews before I made this recipe and too only used about 1/2 to 1/3 the amount of sausage and was glad I did. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes. It was very good. Reminded me of a bolongese sauce just a bit runnier. Next time I will probably go with crushed tomoatoes for a creamier smoother texture. Will definitely make again!

This has fast become one of my favorite recipes! I've been using hot italian sausage instead of sweet. I've made it for my manfriend and some of my room mates and they go nuts for it as well.

I made this recipe for dinner and it was a hit. My veggie eating only 2 yr old loved it and didn't even touch his veggies. I did  not have enough cream so I used a 1/2 cup of 2% milk and used a little flour to thicken just a touch. Great easy recipe. Will definatly make again.

Very good! I changed it a bunch, but I loved the light, creamy tomato sauce that was the main purpose of the recipe. I cooked the sausages whole and sliced them to add later. I added sauteed chunks of chicken breast, as well as quartered whole mushrooms. I used half-n-half instead of cream. It was very tasty and easy to make! Yum!

I really wanted to like this recipe because it's so easy to make. The sauce was wonderful, but I didn't like the Italian sausage in it. Maybe I'll try it again with chicken or turkey. The sauce was so creamy and delicious with the tomatoes and pasta.

super duper easy to make and perfect for those weeknights where you're too tired to cook anything fancy. I used elbow macaroni instead of penne, half and half instead of heavy cream, and paprika instead of red pepper flakes. Also, to further make things easier, I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and dried parsley instead. Fresh is always best, but when you've had a rough day or you've run out of stuff in the pantry--- it tasted fantastic with these substitutes as well. However, please note that I seasoned to taste (garlic powder, salt, and paprika. I didn't follow exact measurements for those.

No doubt I will make this over and over again.  Marvelous!  I used ground sweet sausage and left out the pepper flakes because I didn't have any.  Can't wait to add them next time.  They'll give it an ever better taste (if that's even possible).  I also added 4 garlic cloves.  Will probably add another 1 or 2 next time.  My husband was oinking out on this stuff!! Oh, also used 1 cup whipping cream and 1/2 cup half & half.  Used italian diced tomatoes and added some spinach like another person did.

This really is delicious.  It really is restaurant quality.  I substituted ziti for bow ties, a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, and light cream instead of heavy cream.  I also lightened the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp because of the kids.  At the end when I added the sauce to the pasta, I also mixed in about 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan cheese.  So good and fast to make!

This is just the easiest recipe ever and it's VERY good.  I make this every time I take a dinner to other people and I make it all the time for my own family.  Even the kids love it and ask for me to make it.   My husband, who normally gets sniffy if I make pasta for dinner, will eat this and finish the leftovers the next day.  I always add extra meat in the recipe because we're "more stuff less pasta" people; but as written the recipe is still fabulous.  Out of about twenty times I have made this for other families, they have come back and asked for the recipe about 18 of them!

Easy and awesome!  Make sure to use ground spicy italian sausage for a shortcut/simplifier.  Definitely restaurant quality.

This is a great tasting recipe.  I was skeptical at first, but it is so easy and very, very good.  The only thing I did differently was used light cream, instead of heavy.  I also added a little parm cheese at the end as well.  Foolproof!  Thanks...this will be a fav. in my house!

I actually found a recipe for heavy cream- 1/3 cup melted and cooled butter + 3/4 cup milk= 1 cup heavy cream.  I used that recipe and added a 1 1/2 TBSP cornstarch-  This was excellent.  My husband is raving still.  i used mild italien sausage and omitted the red pepper so my kids would eat it.  my husband put the flakes on top with some parm and loves it.  He is still talking about it.  My son had 3 bowls.  Thank you for sharing.  It really makes a difference to add the bow tie to the sauce what looks like grease is absorbed into the pasta and the flavor is fantastic.  I also used canned tomoatoes and added italien seasoning into the sausage mixture to bring out the flavors.

I guess I hoped this would be something that it wasn't.  It was edible, and that's about all I can say.  Maybe I did it badly or I'm not a big enough fan of sausage.

Huge hit! I used penne and it was delicious. I thought the sauce was a different color, a light pink, but tasted delicious.

This was unbelievable! My family loved this recipe. I followed recipe exactly, except couldn't find plum tomatoes in my store so just used diced italian style. This sauce is not thick like speggetti sauce, but once the noodles are mixed in the noodles are covered nicely. This one I will definatly make again!

At my house, this is called Pink Pasta. 

My husband asks for it by name, and that's worthy of a five star rating.

Just finished having this dish for dinner. Followed the recipe almost to the letter except i added about double the garlic and a little more onion because my family loves garlic. Overall very good, I do think next time I will use hot italian sausage instead of sweet for more spice and use more noodles and less tomatoes. Also I added Basil & Tomato Feta Cheese crumbles on the top along with the parsley and it added great flavor! Will definitly be making this dish again in the future.

This recipe was wonderful and a huge success with my husband.  I haven't seen him eat that much in a long time.  I have to admit I was so proud of what I created I told him I dreamed it up.  It is our little secret.  Thanks again for the great recipe!

Actually 4-1/2 stars.  Great taste, and with Dreamfield's low carb pasta (I used penne), this is a diet-delight.  Be sure to drain all the liquid from the tomatoes, even as you're cutting them up.  Delish!

What a delicious and simple recipe!  I was worried that it would be too rich with the heavy cream, so I was happily surprised when it wasn't!  I will be sharing this recipe with friends.  Thanks for posting!

This stuff is so delicious that my husband asks for it constantly and my Italian mother-in-law asked for the recipe after a recent visit.  
I use the entire package of sweet sausage which makes it 1.25 pounds instead of 1 but other than that we like it just the way the recipe directs!  Really scrumptious!

I used fat free half & half and corn starch because that's what I already had on hand. I also threw in some chopped bell pepper with the onions and garlic and some fresh spinach toward the end (so it would be wilted but not soggy). Pretty good! *UPDATE* this is a Bon Appetit recipe from Jan 2006

This was a hit with friends tonight.  I couldn't find fat free heavy cream, but will try to find it for the next time.  I added 1/2 cup each of chopped yellow and orange bell peppers to this recipe and definitely drained the sausage as was recommended.  Great recipe, and I'll make this again soon.

I changed a few things. Changes: reg diced tomato,turkey sausage, added broccli, added bell pepper (red,orange and yellow) I also didnt use very much red pepper flake. It turned out really good. My husband (who hates veggies and pasta) had a second helping of this dish. I also think the left overs are good.

This was so good!! I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 16 oz package of pasta. It was too much, and I had to use more tomatoes and cream to make up for the extra pasta. But it left me with too little sausage. Next time I will definitely only use a 12 oz package of pasta. It was still soooooo good though. My husband absolutely loved it. He never really raves about anything I cook, but he raved about this. He's pretty picky. I will definitely be making this many more times. Thanks for the delicious recipe!!

This was soo good!  We made it last night for dinner and I'm polishing off the leftovers now.  The sauce came out just a little bit loose at first, but give it a few minutes and it tightens right up.  One tip is don't rinse your pasta when you drain it.  Rinsing it only rinses away the starch which helps thicken up the sauce, but also adds extra water, which could make it too soupy.  Definately something we will make again!

Simple and delicious. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used half and half instead of the heavy cream. I would definately make this again.

This was awesome! I don't even like white sauces but decided to make this for my family. So good! The only change I made was using fresh tomatoes instead of canned and I omitted the parsley.

Excellent, you can feel good serving this hearty meal to company.  The cream and tomatoes make a nice smooth sauce, the red pepper flakes give it just enough kick.  My family thoroughly enjoyed this.  I have made it twice, the second time adding blanched asparagus tips, excellent.

Used Italian Stewed tomatoes and mild Italian Sausage.  Added minced celery,used garlic powder.  Added fresh red pepper.  Used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Would be good to thicken half and half with corn startch

I have a VERY picky son who LOVES pasta but only BORING pasta. I have a husband who does not like pasta at all ... BUT when I found this and made it -- VOILA!! I have a new favorite that I can use when others are here as well. Very simple to to and very tasty! Not a big fan of "skinning" the sausages but O WELL. I did a whole bunch at one time; cooked it all and froze the balance for next time.

Great recipe, it will be a regular for my husband and I. One thing I was bummed about is that it wasn't too great as leftovers, so next time I will probably cut the recipe in half, since I am cooking only for 2.

I chopped a few tomatoes on the vine and used Pastene Kitchen Ready tomato sauce.  I also added 1 cup of grated cheese to the sauce.  It tastes like vodka sauce without the vodka.  Loved it.  Will make again.

This was delish and super easy!  Great for an amateur cook like myself.  I added extra garlic and dried basil (didn't have any fresh herbs),used light cream, and omitted the oil.  To make it more nutritious, I added 1 cup of frozen spinich and some chopped asparagus and then simmered down for about 20 minutes.

YUM!!  After a bad attempt at a stew last night, this recipe was not only easy but delic!  My husband gave it a 9 out of 10, we use this rating system.  I thought it was fabulous---I assume because of the heavy cream!  YUM!

Excellent!  I also used the fat free half n half... turned out great!  I have kids, so I put most of the diced tomatos in blender, so that my kids couldn't see large junks of tomatos and say "What's that? Sprinkle a little italian cheese on top, and everyone will love this dish!

I'll have to rate the version I made.  After reading some reviews, I decided to use fat free half and half.  This caused the sauce to not thicken.  If I make it again, I'll use the whipping cream, as suggested, but possibly less of it to reduce calories.  I also used turkey sausage and whole-wheat penne, which I would do again.

You will love this recipe as it is really good. I make it for my daughter all the time.I do use sweet Italian turkey sausage because I like it and it is less fatty. This is one of my favorites from this site. Thanks

Love this pasta dish.  I used another cook's suggestion to use half and half, but I wasn't that crazy about the half and half. It was still a great dish and an enjobyable meal. Next time I will use the heavy whipping cream as stated.  I did dice up 2 chicken breast and cooked with the sweet Italian sausage.

My husband loved this receipe.  I, on the other hand thought the cream added a certain flavor that shouldn't have been mixed in with this particular receipe.  Something a little bolder perhaps?  I might use sour cream next time instead.

This dish is delicious! I made this pretty much exactly as recipe stated, except that I left out the red pepper, my 3 year old does not like spicy! I added the crushed red pepper to my dish of pasta before I ate it, I LOVE spicy! I also added some fresh parmesan cheese to the top of everyone's bowls. This was a huge hit, everyone loved it! I am actually surprised that as simple as this is, and as quickly as it goes together that it was so fabulous! I will be making this A LOT! Thanks so much for a fantastic recipe! YUM!

All I can say is "WOW"!  I followed the recipe, except, I used one 14.5 oz can of drained whole peeled tomatoes and chopped them up with the spatula in the pan, one 14.5 oz can of drained diced tomatoes and added about 2 tsp of Italian Seasoning since I didn't have the can of tomatoes that the recipe called for.  I didn't do a great job of reading the recipe so I ended up simmering the tomatoes with the sausage/onion/garlic mixture for awhile before adding the cream.  Long story short, this is absolutely one of the BEST recipes I've found on this website.

This one is a keeper in my household.  We like things on the spicy side, so I did use hot italian sausage.  I purchased a 1.25 lb package of hot italian sausage links which consisted of 5 links. I removed the casing and browned up the ground meat from only 3 of the links, so I used a tad less than the 1 lb of sausage called for in the recipe, but that made it all the better as I didn't reduce the amount of cream so we had an extra creamy sauce.  The sauce gains just a hint of sweetness from the tomatoes and cream.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

I made a couple changes because I didn't have parsley, etc. But the basic recipe is so good, I'm pretty sure it was close to the original. One thing I did was just throw in a bunch of veggies, whatever I had in the fridge, broccoli, peas, peppers. I also added some cooked shrimp. 

It was great the first night. It was even better the second night, when the pasta had soaked up the sauce. Very good- thanks so much! I'm going to make it tomorrow. The recipe looks to be endlessly addable. I'm going to put in some mushrooms this time.

My boyfriend loved this dish and now claims it is his all time favorite thing I make. Along with angel hair pasta instead of bowties,  I used a bit more cream than called for and i like it extra spicy with the red pepper flakes. I cannot recommend this recipe enough.

My Family loves this dish and frequently asks for it.  The only thing I changed is I added a 14 1/2oz DelMonte diced tomatoes flavlored with Garlic & Olive oil and a 14 1/2oz of Tomato Sauce,  I use Light whipping cream to save some calories.  This is delicious. Thanks for the recipe

This receipe is great!  It is a different take on a pasta meal.  I had difficulty locating the "Italian-style" 
(Roma) tomatoes, so I just used regular tomatoes - diced.  I was nervous adding the cup and a half of heavy cream (this isn't a dish for dieters) but it adds a creamy/tomatoey texture that is great.  If you're looking for something a little different for dinner; if you like Italian sweet sausage; and pasta in general...try this one.

Been making this for a while now.  Very easy to make a tastes great!  I use half and half instead of cream and diced tomatoes instead of plum.

3rd try 01/29/09: I used 2 pounds of mild Italian sausage, 2 cans of Italian tomatoes, lots of garlic and 2 cups of heavy whipping cream. AWESOME!!!!!!!  1st review: This was better the next day. It was fairly bland but a nice change. I added 2 cans of Italian tomatoes and a pound of 93% Lean ground with the sausage. I also added the onion and garlic while cooking the meat. I would like more sauce next time. It's missing something.  UPDATE 11/17/08: I made this again and used 2lbs sausage, 2 cans tomatoes and 2 cups of cream. I aliminated the onion. This was awsome!

We love this recipe, we found it about 3 years ago, and i make it quite often still, its also good to make extra and freeze it for nights when i don't feel like cooking, the crushed pepper flakes are what makes it, delicious!

This was wonderful - I used chicken sausage, and non fat half & half instead of cream, added mushrooms and fresh grated parmesan cheese - to die for even using lower fat ingredients.

Great recipe with lots of flavor!!  I too used fat free half and half, and ground turkey sausage.  You don't miss the fat at all and is still a very satifying dish.  Will definately make again!

I wish I could get my money back for the ingredients in this recipe.  It never turned to a "cream" sauce.  What a waste, waste, waste of time, effort and ingredients.

We LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!  I subbed smoked sausage for the italian sausage, half and half for the cream and wagon wheels for the bow ties (just had to adjust to what was on hand..)  We'll keep this in a regular rotation to our dinner plates.

This was a 5 star from everyone in my family.  I used green onions instead of a regular onion and ended up using a 28 oz. can of Chopped Italian Tomatoes, herbs & olive oil as that is all I could find.  Kept everything else as written.  Served with a crusty bread for the sauce.  Thank you!

Sooo delicious.  We used 16oz of tri-color farfalle.  Went with 28oz of stewed tomatos (though I think fresh romas from the garden would be best, just too early in the season yet!), but didn't drain them.  Why waste all that flavor in the juice?  I just let it cook the liquid down a little.  Having only non-fat milk on hand, I added a couple tablespoons of flour before stirring in the milk.  Creamy, slightly spicy, filling, comforting.

Somewhat bland, which is surprising since it has sausage in it.  Not sure what I would do to zip it up, as I do not want a spicier dish.

yummy goodness. made this for a missions meeting for around 10 people, and everyone loved it! i doubled the recipe and there was more than enough for seconds and leftovers! :D

some tips: (1) when doubling the recipe though, i only used one pound of sausage, and i found that to be plenty. (2) adding a bit more salt or tasting the sauce until you find fit before mixing in with the bow ties :)

Very good recipe, even if I did make a few changes.  I used 2 cans of garlic, basil diced tomatoes that I put in the blender with the heavy creme because my kids (teenage boys)do not like tomatoes in their food. I also added 1 pound of ground hamburger (they like more meat) and added 1/2 teaspoon more of the red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon cajun seasoning. I omitted the olive oil as I just browned the hamburger and hot italian sausage (breakfast sausage Jimmy Dean) together, and added 1 teaspoon of italian seasoning. Still would not have been able to make it with out the inspiration of this recipe.

Excellent. I substituted italian turkey sausage and half and half to lighten this recipe.  It tasted just fine and I wouldn't bother with the higher fat ingredients.  I did add about an 1/8 of a cup of parmesan cheese for extra flavor.

Absolutely delicious!!! I also used the 1/2 and 1/2 and just simmered until it thickened (more like 35 minutes). I also used the hot italian sausage and the Hunts fire roasted tomatoes diced with garlic instead of plum tomatoes and the red pepper flakes. It was so easy. Prepare this ahead of time it tastes even better when it sits and make sure to top with parmesan cheese!!!! Delicious!!!!

This recipe was super easy and delicious!  I did not add the fresh parsley because I didn't have any but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Next time I will try using half and half instead of heavy cream, and if it still turns out as good I will try the fat-free half and half to make it even healthier.

This is a very good recipe.  I did use fat free half and half instead of cream and Ronzoni Plus bow tie pasta.  Also added a couple of handfuls of baby spinach and used sweet turkey sausage and no pepper flakes.  Easy, good,.... and now good for you!  Will be making this a lot.  Thanks!

Talk about a hit!!! A wanted something that was quick and easy for a party I was having.  I prepared everything except the pasta before the party.  All I had to do was make the pasta and mix everything together before dinner time.  Everyone was commenting on how great this dish was.  I was really surprised by how much praise it got.  I substituted penne for the bow pasta and added parmesan cheese to the entire thing before serving.

This was ok.  Nothing super spectacular about it.  I was hoping for a thicker sauce.

This has been a favorite recipe of ours for 5 years now.  I have made it with all kinds of variations - fresh tomatoes vs diced canned ones, half and half instead of cream, adding spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, or other veggies, and I always use local pork sausage since we prefer fresh natural sausage with no added nitrates.  Each time I make it for friends or family, I get asked to share the recipe.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Very good, but could simplify by using hot Italian sausage and little or no red pepper flakes.

This is a very excellent recipe! I didn't change a thing. A good recipe on a work night for dinner as it doesn't take much time and effort at all to prepare. I will definately be making this again.

This recipe has become a regular in my household. My husband LOVES it, one of his faves.  It is delicious. I have always used half and half instead of heavy cream and it comes out great.

I really liked this recipe, just as easy as making spaghetti. I used half and half instead of cream and added freshly grated parmesan cheese.  The second time we had this I added a large, chopped zucchini just before the sausage was done cooking and it was better with it than without.

I did not have any fresh parsley on hand so I substituted dried parsley flakes.

Absolutely incredible the way it is! My very picky 14 year-old boy loved it even when his 13 year-old sister made it.  Needless to say, it's easy.  Try making a double batch and freeze half.  Super easy and impressive dinnter for busy evenings.

This recipe is a gem!  I made it for the first time this past summer when I was looking for something fast, but still hearty as it was raining.  Since then, I have made this dish every other week.  Not because its on the menu, but because EVERYONE asks for it.

Great pasta dish!  I used spicy sausage so I omitted the red pepper flakes. I cooked the sausage first, then crumbled it in the food processor, added it back in the pan, and continued with the recipe.  I also added some Italian Seasonings.  Will definately make again!

Added a can of mushrooms and simmered mushrooms, onion, garlic, tomato and sausage for about an hour. Added some white wine to keep it liquidy as it simmered. Served with frozen cheese tortollini instead of bow ties, a MAJOR hit! Served with crusty bread to soak up the sauce. Hubby was so happy! :)

Really liked this.  I found that the sausage I got needed to have olive oil added.  I also used the tip of 5 oz spinach, might try fresh next time.  Oh I also used 1/2 and 1/2.

Like many of the reviewers, I used a can of diced Italian tomatoes. I also used only a dash of red pepper because I am mot fond of spicy sausage. To be honest, I'm not really fond of any type of sausage but I thought that this dish was really good! My only compliant is that it was a little too greasy for my taste. My Italian-American hubby LOVED this!!! He said that this dish is "very Neapolitan".  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Our family loves this recipe.  Even though the sauce is a little runny, the taste is fantastic.  I have even used 1 can of diced tomatoes and some chopped up grape tomatoes, and it turned out good.  I personally like the taste of the heavy cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family and I love this recipe.  We've made it many times in the past couple of months making some changes here and there.  I always use 2 cans of Italian style diced tomatoes, drained. I've also used 1/2 hot turkey sausage and 1/2 pork sausage (omitting the red pepper flakes) and 1/2 c heavy cream/1 c half and half, to cut down on fat and calories.

This was an easy meal and tasty. The Italian sweet sausage was a little too sweet for my taste, but will be something I'll make again. My sauce was just the right consistency.

This was pretty good.  The sauce was a little runny.  Next time I will add a tiny bit of flour, and maybe some sour cream for a thicker texture.  It was good, thanks for the recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly. I don't understand the rave reviews, but no one in my family liked it. It didn't have much taste and I didn't care for the sauce. The sausage needs to be drained. We had a greasy sauce. We won't make it again.

Made this tonight and loved it. It had just enough kick. I didnt read correctly and didnt add the red pepper before the meat browned so I dont know if that makes a difference. I also used Half and Half to cut down the fat and I used a little flour and water to thicken the sauce it was awsome. We have plenty for leftovers tomorrow.

really wonderful. Just watch the red pepper flakes if you are sensitive to heat. The heat is about right for most people, but borderline for me.

Oh my goodness this is good I just finished making it today and i am pleasantly surprised at the easyness and flavor.  I ama nticipating tomorrow when the flavor sets in even more.  The fresh parsley enhances the flavor so much, I have never cooked with fresh parsley before but I now know I will never cook without it again.  Only thing for me is the sauce never thickened so I had to put add a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  I used Turkey Sausage and Dices tomatoes with italian seasoning, only because it was what I had on hand but I see nonother reason to make it any other way it was really great.  PS Extremely kid friendly my 4 year old gives me a hard time to eat everything but he loved this.

This was pretty bland the first night, even with all that heavy cream.  The leftovers were a lot better as the flavors had time to develop. I did only use 1 cup cream, as it seemed to have plenty of liquid without the other 1/2 cup.  I also was a little short on pasta, but there seemed to be more than enough with 8 oz.

This was excellent!! I did omit the red pepper flakes and used regular whipping cream.  Very easy to make on a weeknight.  This will definitly be added to my weekly rotation of meals.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe three times.
Each time with great reviews.
my friends can't get over the idea that I add heavy cream to it. They all liked it.
Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I made the following changes: Used 2 cans petite diced tomatos drained. Used italian sausage. (Next time I will use a regular sweet (not hot) sausage). I used 3 cloves of pressed garlic. 1 1/2 cups half and half. (Next time I will use 1 cup). I bought the parsely and chopped it up...but it really make it taste any better. Oh, I added a dash of italian seasoning, and 3 dashes red pepper flakes instead of the original amount. It was great! I recommend it:)

I threw an Italian themed dinner party for 16 people and made this recipe as one of the two main dishes. Everyone RAVED how delicious it was and they all wanted the recipe. I made it exactly as described and although I could have used a low-fat version of the cream, I didn't and I'm glad.  This is now one of my all time favorites and is one I will make again and again.

I really love the way this turned out.  It was really tasty and I'll definitely make it again.  I used mild italian sausage and omitted the heat since I was cooking for kids.  It still turned out wonderful.  Instead of plum tomatoes, I used 2 cans of Italian herbs diced tomatoes and added cornstarch and parmesan cheese while the mixture was simmering.  Perfect!

My husband and I really liked this. I didn't follow all the proportions exactly but doubt that made too much difference in the end result. Recipes like this are pretty forgiving. I would make it again if I happen to have cream on hand like I did this time, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy the ingredients just to make it again. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because I like my 5s to mean something and this recipe didn't knock my socks off.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I always have a hard time deciding what to do with sausage, now I know!  My husband loved it and can't wait for me to make it again.  I followed the recipe just as it's written. The cream truly does make it delicious. Thanks so much!

WOW!  This was awesome.  I loved this dish and so did my family.  I did a few things different though.  I used italian seasoned ground turkey to cut down on fat and I used canned diced tomatoes and added 1 TBS of italian seasonings to them.  It turned out great and was a very filling dish.  Thanks!

Great Quick and easy dish!  I put this together after coming home from work, the only thing I did, I left the sausage in the casing, and cut it into pieces, and it turned out great!  Everyone loved it!

Fabulous!  I doubled the recipe but instead of doubling the sausage I added chicken.  I used canned diced Italian tomatoes instead of plum tomatos, added a can of tomato paste, and added mushrooms.  Guests loved it!

I made this with three-cheese tortollini instead of bow-tie pasta and it was fabulous!  I also added garlic, mushrooms and a little green pepper.  I cut back on the amount of heavy cream (probably less than a cup).  I will definitely make this again and again.

I made this again for the second time last night with a few changes. Use light cream or FF half & half to cut down on calories - no need for the high test. Also, italian turkey sausage without the skins cut way down on the fat. Added some sweet basil and just a dash of dry cooking sherry. Also used a high fiber, soy based pasta that cut down on carbs. It's called Dreamfield's - great product. I just can't get enough of it and so easy to make! It's on the regular rotation.

This was really, really good!!  I used mild italian sausage and added a little brown sugar to it.  I also used the diced tomatoes with green chiles.  We like a little spice so I added a little extra pepper flakes.  Awesome!!

Very Savory! Only made a few adjustments for what I had in the fridge. Used Kielbasa and a can of diced tomatoes, added a green pepper, and used Italian seasoning blend...also used whatever pasta was in the cupboard. I really liked this recipe and my husband LOVED it. Thanks....definitely a great way to use up cream or sausage! Will make often!

Yummy, my husband really likes it.  I also used a 16 oz bag, half skim milk and heavy cream, also used the can diced tomatoes.  Really easy, and a great hit.

Wow this was tasty.  I added white wine, a little italian seasoning, sliced mushrooms and 1/2 a red pepper during the simmering time at the end.  I did use half and half instead of cream.  The flavor was wonderful!

My husband LOVED this dish. He definately wants me to make this again. I liked it too. I did have to add some Adobo seasoning to it though. It was missing something until then. The only thing I will do differently next time is not put quite as much red pepper flakes in it. I can't handle the heat. I think it would be just as good, if not better, without it.

This is so good!  It's one of the best ones I've made from this site.  I didn't make any changes, although I used spicy Italian sausage rather than sweet.  YUM!

I rarely rate recipes on here, but this one deserved it!  A true 5 stars!  I used turkey sausage to cut the fat, but stayed with the heavy cream for the thickness.  Needed more flavor for our tastes.  Added more garlic, basil and oregano and crushed red peppers.  Used bow ties, but next time will try small penne or maybe fettucine?  Really good,even my small kids (3&4)loved it.

This recipe is easy and very delicious - great combination. I also substituted half and half for heavy cream and had to cook longer for sauce to thicken. I added a bit of corstarch to help the process. I also added a small can of mushrooms and it was wonderful. Will definitely make again and again.

This was tasty!  I had to simmer the sauce longer than the recipe calls for in order to thicken the sauce (maybe 15-20 minutes).  I will definitely be making this again and passing along the recipe.  It's a keeper!

Easy and excellent!  I added a can of peas and substituted half-and-half for the heavy cream and it was a huge hit from the hubby down to the 4 year-old.  I'll be making this dish a lot.

I didn't like this recipe all that much.  The sauce came out a little bit thin and there was too much sausage.  I thought this tasted like a glorified hamburger helper meal.  There's a similar recipe on this site called "chicken milano" that I think is way better.

I cooked this recipe for my wife and two girls on a Saturday night, never having created my own sauce before. I was nervous, but ventured on, realizing that this was the easiest dish I have ever made, and THE most delicious meal I have yet to prepare! I threw in extra bow tie pasta, and we will be enjoying this dish all over again tomorrow night! It was equal to the Olive Garden! (no breadsticks. Hmmm..)

This was a very good recipe. But, my sauce was not as thick as I would have liked. Next time (and there WILL be a next time!) I will probably use a can of pre-made Alfredo sauce in place of the heavy cream in the interest of a thick, creamy, easy sauce.

I liked this recipe, but I agree with some others that there seems to be something missing.  I added red bell peppers to mine (hubby hates them) and next time I will add some mushrooms and green peppers.

I loved this recipe, but my husband thought the sauce was a little watery.  Maybe I didn't let it reduce long enough before serving it.  I did use fat free half and half, but the flavor was still wonderful.

My family really liked this. I didn't taste the spice from the red pepper flakes at all..even my 7 yr old ate it and didn't complain about it being too spicy. The flavor was good..my husband asked me to make this again. I did add a little parm cheese and a tsp of cornstarch to thicken it. I also drained the fat after cooking the sausage. Definately a keeper..THANKS!Edit: I make this all the time now for our families...they rave about it. It is a great company dish.

This was good, but I prefer to make a similar (and lighter) recipe that I tried previously.  I thought this called for WAY too much sausage.  I was craving a "sweet" taste, but this dish isn't sweet at all (more on the savory side).  Maybe the other pasta I made was sweeter because of the addition of red bell pepper.  Oh well, it was at least satisfying (pasta fills you up).  Thanks anyways.

When we lived in another state, our favorite Italian restaurant had a pasta dish with sausage in a tomato cream sauce that I just loved.  When I saw this recipe it looked like it might be close to the same thing.  As I ate it I was quite surprised that I couldn't remember how the other one tasted to compare them!  So I will simply say that this is excellent and I would make it again.  I didn't notice that it said to drain the tomatoes, so it took a while for the sauce to thicken up.  Next time I might try this with penne instead of the bowties since they might be easier to eat and hold more sauce.

Made this last night for dinner.  It was great.  Having the rest right now as I type.  Ours was sausier than I remember my friends being, but I used some heavy cream and some 1/2 and 1/2.  I didn't buy enough cream.  Anyway, it was still great.  Even the 10 and 9 year old went back for more.

This was good...when deciding what to make for the evening, my boyfriend was leary, but very surprised once he tasted this recipe.  The only thing I changed was to use a jar of Marinara instead of the chopped tomatoes.  Worked great!  I would definately make it again.

This was pretty good.  I skipped the 2 tbs olive oil since the hot Italian sausage I used rendered a lot of fat (drained that off, too) and doubled up on the red pepper flakes.  Replaced the heavy cream with f/f half & half and the sauce was still tasty.  Thanks!

This is a keeper! Excellent flavor. Easy to put together and very satisfying. I like things spicy, so I added a bit more hot pepper flakes, but other than that followed the recipe to the tee. Thanks for the post.....my family is already asking for this dish again.

I made this for my husband the first time I cooked for him. It was wonderful! Great for guests too, not too hard to make, but very impressive.

This was so easy, and very good.  I used hot italian sausage - and still added the crused red pepper.  It was delicious.

This was a hit!  It was quick and easy to make and tasted delicious.  I think next time I will double the sauce, it was a little thick, but was great!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made two modifications - I used turkey italian sausage and a can of petite diced tomatoes.  We love this recipe because it's so easy to make and tastes really good.  Thanks!

Just made this!  It's good enuf to keep in the bank for something different. Pretty, but without the red pepper, a tad bland.(kids wouldn't eat it with the pepper flakes) I might try adding a small can of dark red kidneys next time for fun.  Husband wasn't thrilled with the look, but liked the sausage and added his own red pepper.

This recipe was very easy and quick to prepare.  Flavor was good...just enough bite with the red pepper flakes.  Sauce was very thin...I thickened it with 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese and corn starch.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I made a few changes though.  I used penne rather than bowtie.  It made for a really nice presentation.  I also used mild sausage rather than the sweet.  I cooked the sausage at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.  When they were cool enough to handle I sliced the sausage rather than crumble it.  My husband loves Italian sausage and wouldn't have it any other way.  1/4 tsp of the pepper flakes is plenty to add spice to the sauce.  I also used the canned diced tomatoes as other users suggested.  I used 3/4 cup heavy cream and 3/4 cup half and half.  A little bit of flour will help thicken the sauce if necessary.  I also added a tspn of basil.  This recipe is definatey a keeper!

This surprised me how flavorful it is.  I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes because I don't like the chunky ones.  I also used a pepper/pasta/pizza spice mix I have instead of the red pepper flakes.  I used 1 C cream. Near the end of the cooking, I added 1/2 C grated Parm.   This turned out very thick, and delicious.  I may have tweaked a bit adding oregano, but I basically followed the recipe except for the above notes.  I'm picky about pasta sauces because sometimes they just aren't rich enough for me.  Kids would love this, and men who like comfort food as well.

This was really a great pasta dish!  My husband had thirds and I finally had to cut him off for fear that he would explode!  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole....  It was almost effortless to make this!  Will definitely make again! I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it was a great dish, but not one of the very best I've ever had.  Try it!

Yummy!!! Listened to other reviews and used 1 1/2 lbs sausage. Also doubled the garlic (love garlic) and used 1 cup light cream and 1 cup half and half. Also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes. Will keep making this recipe. Can't wait to make for Italian mother-in-law!!

Pretty good! I followed the recipe exactly, using Bob Evans Italian sausage. Not surprisingly, the red pepper flakes were too spicy for my wimpy palate but Husband thought it was very tasty. A nice quick and easy recipe! Thanks! (Oh, my submitted photo shows this meal served in a slightly different way. I did this as it makes it look more appetizing.)

My roommates and I liked this recipe a lot. The sauce turned out a little bit thin; however, I think I will make this dish again (and add some more tomatoes).

I didn't use any oil to brown the sausage and didn't miss it.  I rinsed it really well with insty-hot water in the sink in a strainer to get rid of any excess fat.  I also used fat free half & half instead of cream.  This recipe was DELICIOUS, and I didn't miss any of the excess fat.  We will definitely eat this again and again.  Also, I got impatient waiting for the sauce to thicken, so I sprinkled in a little flour and cornstarch.  I almost overdid it, so it was probably unnecessary.  This dish is even yummy served leftover and cold the next day!  I love all of the garlic.  I skipped the hot pepper flakes in hopes the kids would eat it (and my Italian sausage was the mild version), but they still found it too spicy to eat.  They are six, four, and one, so that's not too surprising.

This is a good base, however add some spicy pepper flakes, more garlic, basil, and fresh oregano. Also use 5-6 medium size fres tomatoes instead of canned to give it a fresh flare. I used flour to thicken the sauce slighty so it was not runny. This was excelllent with Penne Rigata.

This is one of my families favorites.  My parents used to make is all the time for us and now I do the same for my family.  This dish is also something that you can prepare a day ahead of time and just reheat when ready.  This also allows the sauce to thicken up.  You really need to let it sit for about 15 minutes after cooking for the sauce to really thicken.  And for those that don't like spices, omit the red pepper flakes, taste just as good.  I also do not add oil to cook the sausage as their is enough grease in the sausage.  I also omit the salt and parsley, no need for them.  Overall excellent meal and is company worthy in my opinion.

This was good, my husband liked but it was little too spicy for me. I can't handle anything spicy though so I am sure it's good for everyone else. This was little thin too...the sauce.

This recipe was fantastic.  I made a few small changes...mild instead of sweet italian sausage, onion powder instead of chopped onions, penne instead of bowties, added some basil, and used a little fresh grated parmesan cheese to thicken it a bit.  My family ate it up!

Decreased the recipe to 4 servings. Changes I made: used Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes and chopped those, added some cornstarch to thicken, added fresh grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and fresh basil at the end. Very good, very rich. Might try with 2% milk next time.

This was the best pasta dish I've ever made! My entire family loved it and this will be one of our 'favorites'. I didn't have canned 'plum' tomatoes, so I used italian style stewed tomatoes. I also added some frest basil with the parsley. I would highly recommend this recipe!

WOW!  My father is not a big pasta eater but he wiped his bowl clean with the bread sticks.  It tasted even better the next day warmed up for a mid day snack...the flavors really melded together overnight. We like our food spicy so I added some oregano and fennel seeds. Definitely a keeper.

Really good, really adaptable.  As written I'd give it three stars because the sweet sausage didn't do it for me but when I used hot italian sausage and italian recipe diced tomatoes it bumped to a four star.  Loved the cream with the tomatoes.

This is absolutely delicious, I was so impressed.  Even with some changes I made.  I used diced tomatoes and accidentally forgot to drain, and regular milk because I didn't have cream, I just added some flour to thicken it up a bit.  I used half the Italian sausage it called for, and spicy instead of sweet, and topped with shredded mozzarella and Romano cheeses.  It was a hit, thanks so much!  Flavor was just amazing.

This is an easy and very tasty recipe. I did not use red pepper b/c I have 3 kids who hate spicy foods. Was still tasty w/o it. I used petite diced tomatoes from the can for ease. I let the pasta finish in the sauce. Will definately make again.

This is one of my fiance's favorite dishes, and it is great the next day as well. I didnt change a thing, other than to drain the excess oil from the sausage before I added the tomatoes. I serve it with parmesean sprinkled on top.Yum!

This recipe is awesome!  Its got great flavor and a little bit of kick because of the red pepper.  I substituted the minced garlic for garlic powder and added a half pound extra meat.  Very tasty.

I did make quite a few changes to this recipe, so I couldn't really taste the sauce that well.  Next time I think I'll make it as is and see how it turns out.  I added leftovers from camping (keilbasa, italian sausage & pork kebobs), added a can of drained & rinsed cannelli beans, which I love with pasta & sausage & I didn't have any heavy cream so I used all half & half.  I was very easy to make and very quick.  It did have a really good taste to it, I just couldn't really taste the sauce everyone had raved about.  I will try making this again without throwing everything but the kitchen sink in (but I'll keep the beans).  Definetly worth trying.

Wow.  I am not a big sausage fan so I was hesitant.  I'm so glad I took a chance.  This recipe is FANTASTIC.  I can't believe there aren't more reviews for this one.  I didn't change a thing except for mixing some leftover heavy cream in my refrigerator with some (slightly less fattening) half and half.  I just used canned whole tomatoes (isn't that what the Italian plum tomatoes basically are anyway?)  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks, Linda!

I tried Lemon cream pasta with chicken (from this site) last week and we loved it so much I looked for similar recipes and found this one.  I love the cream in the sauce.  We all liked this, I probably would have given it a 4 and a half but my husband said it was a six so I compromised.  Very different and good, will make again.

Yummy.....I used penne instead of bow ties....also used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream...substituted turkey sausage for pork sausage and threw in about 1/2 c. grated pecorino romano cheese to the sauce. Hubby loved it! Very flavorful...will make again!

Made this last night.  Great flavor.  I used to 14.5 cans of diced italian tomatoes.  Was't able to find the plum tomatoes.  We will certainly make many more times.

This is a fabulous and extremely easy sauce.  I made this for our second course at Easter and everyone raved about it.  They liked this better than my ham.  The only changes I made were that I pureed the tomates in my blender and I added a little "wondra" to the sauce to help thicken it.  The flavor is outstanding.

My mother couldn't get enough of this dish!  I substituted Italian sausage for ground pork and beef, seeing as my mother  is alergic to a spice in the sausage.  I searched 2 different grocery stores and couldn't find the plum tomatoes, so I used crushed instead. It turned out wonderfully.  At first I thought the dish was just okay, but now I love it!

Wonderful!  I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1 cup skim milk to cut down on some fat and calories and it was amazing.  My husband liked it and he is picky about his Itailan food.

I used crushed tomatoes and a basil flavored rotini pasta - it was excellent. A little spicy, but I think primarily due to the Italian sausage I selected. Great recipe! I didn't have any problems with it thickening up, but I used the entire 1-1/2 cups of heavy cream.

Very good and very rich. Sauce doesn't get super thick (like alfredo) it's more of a really creamy broth but is still yummy!!

I served this to several people and most gave wonderful complements.  Thanks for making my dinner party a success! I did use sundried tomatoes instead of the plum and added parmesan cheese to make the sauce thicker.  I also separated the meat from the sauce to also serve to vegetarians.  All enjoyed.

I give this recipe four stars, but I didn't rate it because to get four stars I made some minor changes.  I used mild bulk italian sausage, not sweet.  I've never heard of sweet italian sausage and therefore couldn't find it in the store.  Also I used ground red pepper, not flakes, that's what I had on hand.  My husband said the pasta was "awesome!"  Overall: Tasty, quick dinner and easy to throw together.

This was AWESOME.  Made a few changes to make it reduced fat.  Still tasted like restaurant quality.  Used fat-free creamer and low-fat italian chicken sausage.  As suggested, I added a heaping T cornstarch to the creamer before stirring in.  Also added some fresh basil for taste.  This would go great with ANY shape pasta, gnocchi, or tortellini.  So glad I found it.

This was excellent but the ultimate flavour will depend on what kind of sausages you use. I didn't add as much cream as written, don't think it really needed it.

Excellent!!  My kids even liked it even though they picked around the sausage.  My sauce was really runny though.  I kept adding cornstarch but it never thickend up.  Any ideas for next time?  This recipe is definitely a keeper even with the sauce being runny.

Wonderful!  I'm not big on Sausage (but my husband is) so I used the Jimmy Dean extra mild and I only used one cup of cream because that's all I had.  It didn't matter though because it was delicious.  Thanks!

My husband and guests LOVED this recipe.  I added about 1/3 cup Asiago cheese and some cornstarch diluted in water because it is too runny, but the flavor is great.

It wasn't a horrible dish - just very bland, which surprised me!  The heavy cream really covered all the spices and tomato flavor - so we were left with just the taste of sausage and pasta.  Probably will not make again, but thank you!

I made this for my family and they all loved it. Made a few changes, though. I used sweet sausage instead of hot, and I did not take the sausage out of the casing. Instead, I cooked the sausage whole, then cut it into thick chunks and continued to fry it until it was well cooked- almost burnt.  (My hubby loves sausage.. I didn't want to tease him with the tiny crumbles.) It made a wonderful meal, now a family certified "keeper". Thanks, Linda.

This is one of my favorite pasta dishes.  I've made this many times over and is excellent the next day too - just warm up some olive oil in a pot and add the leftovers in over med lo heat.  I've tried using already diced tomatoes as another cook recommended, but it didn't taste as good.  I would follow this recipe to the T - Linda knows what she's talking about!

This recipe was quick and easy, which is always a good thing. I thought that it was a little less flavorful than I'd hoped. Next time I make it, I'll add a bit more red pepper flakes, and some basil as well. My boyfriend, who is a very picky eater, loved it!

Another WONDERFUL recipe!  I did, however, use hot Italian sausage and bought a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  I added about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese which thickened up the sauce a bit.  We thoroughly enjoyed this one.

Out of the family I was the only one who thought this was missing something.  I used 1 pound pasta, 28 oz can chopped plum tomatos and 2 cups of cream.  I also steamed then sliced the sausage before beowning it. I added fresh ground black pepper and some finely chopped fresh basil, to give it a bit more flavor.

Excellent, but wish it were a little more creamier perhaps I could thicken the sauce with something, any suggestions?

Excellent!  Simple and quick.  I used 1/2 & 1/2 because I had no heavy cream in the house.  Not quite as creamy, but just as good.

I didn't have any cream so I used 4 oz of cream cheese and 1 cup of milk.  Added Italian seasoning, and used red pepper vs. flakes.  My husband said he could have eaten it all.  
Thanks Linda!

This was a good dinner, very quick and easy to make.  I boiled the sausage for 18 minutes before cutting it and browning it to get rid of a lot of the fat and grease.  The sauce was missing something, but what I'm not quite sure.  Some garlic powder in addition to the minced garlic possibly.  The sauce turns out similar to a penne a la vodka sauce.  Over all very good and will make this again.

I really enjoyed this pasta.  I used some Italina Turkey sausage I had leftover and I used some cream and some milk but heck, you know what?  Make it however you want to make it!  Me?  I like to live for the moment so do what makes you happy!  This pasta makes me happy!

So-so until I added a cup of prepared spaghetti sauce and ground black pepper  which "kicked it up a notch"! Also if I were to make this again I most difinetly would not use heavey cream  but instead use evaporated skim milk. As is, this recipe is a death sentence!

This recipe was amazing.  Very easy to make, and extremely tasty.  My family loved it, and I brought it to work for pot lunch and they loved it too.

Excellent recipe, my boyfriend who doesn't usually like pasta actually took some leftovers to work with him!  I added some basil and oregano because I love them in pasta dishes, and I used reduced fat Jimmy Dean sausage and it turned out great.  Next time I'm going to try using half and half instead of heavy cream to try and cut out some fat.

This was absolutely the best pasta sauce I have ever made.  It was so easy and took no time at all to prepare.  This would be a great dinner party meal.  I added 1/4 lb. of prosciutto for extra favor and texture.  It was a true winner in our house! I will definitely be making this again soon!

Terrific! I only had regular canned tomotoes on hand--used those and they seemed to be fine (I also left out the parsley topper). Even my kids liked it especially when they dipped their bread into the sauce. I must've gotten a little heavy handed with the red pepper--it packed a bit of a kick! This is a  super easy alternative to my usual spaghetti sauce.  Thanks--this is a keeper!

Yum!  I thought that I had Italian sausage in the freezer, but I found polska kiebalsa.  I sliced and diced the kiebalsa and used it anyway.  I did not add the oil.  I also drained the fat from the pan after sauteing the onions.  I did not drain the tomatoes and used less cream.  Still, the flavors were awesome.  My husband even ate the leftovers.  He NEVER eats leftovers.

This recipe was great.  It takes quite a bit of time though.  I thought it was very flavorful and delicious.  Unfortunately my husband did not like it.  He thought it was too spicy and it gave him heartburn.

Although the overall taste was good, the sauce was a bit greasy and I wasn't a fan of the sausage.  Will try this again, but with chicken instead.
