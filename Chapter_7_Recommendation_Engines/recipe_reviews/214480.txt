I had around a 2.5-3 lb pork roast, it only took an hour in the oven at 350.  I didn't have garam masala or tumeric on hand, so I skipped them.  Also even though my pork roast was half the size of the recipe, I kept all the other measurements the same.  It was really fabulous.  So good, and so easy.  I did as one of the reviewers said, and coated the roast in kosher salt overnight.  I only had a chance to immediately cook the roast after applying the rub.  Next time, I will let the roast sit with the rub on for an hour or so before preparing.  I also think this would be awesome with a turkey breast, or turkey tenderloins.   I would make this for guests.

Seeing as my review is the only one I am not sure why this recipe has a 1 star rating. With that said this was a very tasty dish which gave me wonderful ideas! First the combination of seasonings in here superb, the sauce is wonderful. The pork (which I used 2lb) is thick enough that it either needs to be brined for a few hours or rubbed with kosher salt the night before.  The method in which this is prepared would make a wonderful chicken or beef stew. Don't pass this up and with the exception of the salt, don't change anything, especially the cooking preparation!  **I also substituted apricot preserves this time for the fig compote**

This a now one of our favorite recipes! We have our own fig tree in our backyard & this is a wonderful recipe to use them in place of the fig compote. We paired this with plain couscous & put the sauce over it and also had steamed broccoli. Delish!!

Just made this tonight and it was delicious!  Instead of finishing the recipe in a dutch oven as per recipe I used a slow cooker and added some potatoes to make sure my sauce wasn't runny.  Fabulous recipe,  a great winter dinner!

This looks delicious, however should not include "Moroccan" in the name, as Morocco is a Muslim country where the general population doesn't eat pork. If you were to find an individual Moroccan family who ate pork, they would be the exception, but definitely not representing the culture as a whole. We live in Spain, as my husband's work sends him frequently to Morocco and we have many, many Moroccan friends and acquaintances. Sometimes it's good to use a little bit of discretion as we advertise dishes as being "ethnic" or "authentic" from a particular country--in order to avoid confusing others at the very least. Still, it looks delicious and would love to try it some time!

Love this recipe!  The only ting I did different was add some raisins with the chicken broth and tomatoes for an added sweetness to the fig. Love it!

OOPS! I took out of the freezer what I thought was a small pork roast. Turned out it was 2 lbs. of pork stew-sized pieces. Went ahead and seasoned per receipe and was delighted with the stew! One hour at 350 degrees was adequeate. Served over vegetable couscous. My husband was thrilled as we enjoy savory dishes the most. Will serve again this winter! Thank you michtrem!

I thought this recipe was wonderful. It tasted like dishes I've had at Moroccan restaurants. I made fig compote by simmering chopped mission figs in some water, red wine and brown sugar for 10 minutes then mashing them with a potato masher. I also blended the sauce at the end with a stick blender. Saved the leftover sauce to serve with other meals. Will try this with chicken next.

This recipe tastes great. The biggest problem for me was the smell of curry in my house for 4 days after.  These are really pungent spices, so you better like that smell! I probably wouldn't make again only because of the lingering smell. The fig compote is hard to find so I made my own.  Took dried figs and re-constituted in water, then chopped up and cooked with baking splenda and the soaking water.  I used more than the recipe called for - maybe a 1/4 cup of compote.

Overall I enjoyed this recipe, and would really give it 41/2 stars.  Like others I served with couscous, added raisins and other dried fruits to the sauce.  The next time I make this I'm going to try it with bone-in, skin on chicken thighs and increase the spices.  I would serve this at a dinner party if I knew the guests appreciated ethnic food.

This was such a good sauce!  My roast was only a scant two pounds, so it really got coated well with only half the seasoning mix (saved the rest) and I let it sit for about 1.5 hrs on the counter to come to room temp with the seasoning on it.  I added some prunes to the sauce, used a fig/lemon jam (a little extra too).  I'm just sorry I didn't have a bigger roast since it only made 4 small portions.  Served over a couscous/quinoa/veggie blend from the HEB freezer, and it was a hit.  Hubby normally doesn't care for anything too exotic, but cleaned his plate on this one.

This is the best meal I've ever made.  I made it twice.  The first time, in a slow cooker and it came out way too dry.  The second time, I brined the meat overnight and cooked it according to the directions.  I used a pork shoulder and made my own garam masala cuz it's hard to find. Such an incredible dish!

Delicious!  I halved the pork and made a 2.5lb roast, so I used 1/2 the spices while keeping the gravy ingredients that same amount.  I rubbed the spice mixture onto the roast and let it sit for several hours in the fridge to enhance the flavor.  Wonderful served over couscous.

The smell and taste of this dish was excellent.  My choice of Pork Roast was not.  Next time will try a different type of roast.  Also did not have garam masala.

I can't understand why this got such great ratings. It tasted like a roast covered in sand! I followed the recipe exactly. I expected spicy flavor. I got brown tasteless boiled meat.

I followed the directions to a T (wrong..forgot I only used half the chili powder) and it turned out great. I don't own a dutch oven so I seared the meat in a frying pan, moved the meat to another oven safe container and did the onions, garlic and then the fig sauce. Used aluminum to "tent" the pork roast and cooked 1 hr 50 minutes and my meat was great. Was less than 5 lbs however. Kids ate their portion and although it had a great flavor it wasn't overly spicy for their liking. Hubby and myself liked the meal a lot and hope to add this to our meal rotation. Love trying new meals and the flavor profile to this was great.

One of the best meals I've ever made! The pork comes out SO moist. I made up my own garam masala and fig compote just by searching the internet for substitutes, and I also finished it off in a crock pot on high for 2.5 hrs (for a 2.5 lb roast). Even with these minor alterations, it was fabulous! I also kept all the other proportions the same despite reducing the roast to 2.5 lbs. You won't regret making this...especially for company!

This was one of the best roasts ever. My husband and children loved it. However, beware--it has an Indian flavor that doesn't appeal to everyone. The only change I made was a fig preserve substitution for fig compote. I added a little water to thin the preserves.

I gave this a try last night.  I put the rub on the meat about an hour before cooking and did everything else exactly as instructed.  This was so easy and turned out absolutely delicious!  I would recommend cutting it into pieces and serving it over rice with some of the juices and tasty bits poured on top.  In fact, now that I have told you how good it is I'm going to finish up the leftovers!

This is my new favorite way to cook a pork roast.

I followed the reciept exactly, only adding some cut up figs to the sauce.

So yummy.  It is even better the second day.

I loved this recipe. I used dates instead of figs. I learned something new too that garam masala and chili powder make a great blend. I will be using this in the future.

Used dates instead of figs. Otherwise followed precisely.  Used boneless pork shoulder. 
In the oven now.

This is one of my favorite ways to make pork roast.  I do rub it with salt and let it sit for several hours, then put the rub on it and wait for several more hours before starting the cooking process.  I also never have fig compote, so I use plum jam.  The sauce is yummy!  I have added veggies before popping it in the oven as other reviewers suggested.  I felt like the veggies watered down the sauce, and the sauce is my favorite part.  I won't do that again.  Update - 10/17/18 - Since the sauce is my favorite part, I really hate throwing it away.  I finally found a good way to reuse it!  Dice 1 chicken breast, a few potatoes, and mushrooms.  (I tried carrots and onions, but was not a fan.)  Put in a greased 9x13 pan.  Dump the sauce over and stir until everything is coated.  Bake covered at 350 for 1 hour and uncovered for another 45 minutes to an hour until everything is cooked through.  Yummy!

Love this sauce. Will make again. Am not so fond of pork so will make it  as a beef pot roast. 
Used about 2/3rd amount of each spice but next time will use the whole amount. Really delicious sauce.

Ive made this many times now.  Straight up, as written. LOVE IT. Even my vegetarian wife cannot resist the sauce. What's a little spicy sweet pork fat between lovers?

Do not attempt this recipe if, like me,  you do not have a range hood in your kitchen. The searing of the spices on the stove filled my whole apartment with smoke.  After we got the air clear, I abandoned the rest of the instructions, sauteed the onions, garlic, and fig on the stove top, and threw everything in the slow cooker. The roast did turn out tender and tasty, but....yeah. I'm surprised that none of my neighbors called the fire department.

Made it for the family.  Everyone loved it so this will be a repeat.  The only downside is that I am Vegan so for me it was unfortunate not being able to savor the success.

Fantastic!  Great flavor. Served over rice to soak up sauce. Received many compliments from my dinner party.
