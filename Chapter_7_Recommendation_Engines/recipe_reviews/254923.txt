I honestly can't say enough good things about this recipe.  The batter was thick- probably the thickest muffin batter I've ever worked with.  The muffins were dense but light, sweet with a slight tang from the sour cream I didn't even know I wanted in a muffin but now I know I totally do.  These will now be my go-to berry muffin recipe, I can't think of a berry that wouldn't work in this.  SO GOOD!

I have made these twice, the first time with chopped strawberries and orange zest and like others had to add a little extra milk.  They were spectacular!  Yesterday I made them with fresh blackberries and once again they were delicious.  They stay moist for a couple of days if they last that long.  They second time I was going to add lemon zest but forgot, they do get an extra flavor boost from the zest.

I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose & used frozen blackberries which worked just fine.  They seemed a little dry to me but eating them warm with butter solves that - tasted good.

I added another tablespoon of milk so I was able to incorporate all the flour mixture.  I used use large muff in pan.  Made 9 large muffins.  Love the sour cream addition, makes a nice rich flavor.

very tasty. I did however substitute Stevia for the sugar in the recipe, and used my frozen blackberries from my garden. It turned out very well, but a bit sweeter then I would like, so next time I will cut back on the Stevia a bit.  Other wise the muffins are great.

These turned out delicious. I didn’t have enough blackberries so I supplemented what I had with some chopped strawberries. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. The muffins were dense, moist and super yummy! I’ll be making these again whenever I have berries.

I had to make some changes so I will need to do it again. However, I added a cup of old fashioned oats, used mixed berries, only 6 oz and whole milk yogurt instead of sour cream.

So far so good, i felt that 450 was a bit high on the temp so the left over batter I had is currently cooking at 400 to see how they do, so far they seem to be rising a lot higher in the oven and look like they wont be a bit overcooked around the edges.......
