I use chicken legs for this recipe and add a litte garlic salt, flour, and cayene pepper to the corn flakes.  Any seasoning will be good.  I also remove the skin from the chicken and lightly spray with oil after i am done coating them.  It only takes alittle pam spray to make them crunchy.  Its really delicous.

Tastes good. Messy preparation;, messy end product.  Chicken stays juicy, but the cornflakes get really soggy.  Also, don't need more than 2 cups of yogurt, and chicken could use a tiny bit of seasoning.

Messy? Yes, but well worth the mess. I have new converts to yogurt in my house.  Everyone loved it.  I had to substitute bread crumbs for cornflake crumbs.  Didn't think anyone would care for crushed Fruit Loops! I did season the yogurt with lemon pepper and the crumbs with onion salt, pepper, parsley, and chives.

After reading the other reviews, I was nervous that this recipe was going to be too bland.  So instead of using plain yogurt and corn flakes, I used lowfat vanilla yogurt and frosted flakes.  I also used a spray of Pam to make the flakes crunchy.  After they were done baking (which took 30-45 mins), I topped each chicken breast with raspberries and blueberries.  They turned out excellent and got rave reviews from my friends!

Very easy to make. I don't use corn flakes but grape nuts flakes, they stay really crunchy. My husband loves it!  I added lemon herb chicken seasoning to it this last time, but it tastes fine either way. You certainly do not need all the yogurt, about 1/2 a cup per breast will be good enough.

BIG HIT!!! I made some changes to please the family. As I ALWAYS do, I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, salt and granulated garlic for about 1 hour, used only 2 cups yogurt and added a little salt, black pepper, italian seasoning and parmesan cheese to the corn flake crumbs. Even my super-picky daughter had seconds!

Definitely would make again. Excellent flavor and juiciness to chicken...so juicy I was afraid I'd undercooked it! I would reduce the amount of yogurt by 75%. You really don't need much at all to coat the chicken breasts. I used more cornflakes than the recipe called for by about a half a cup. I felt like I was running out of crumbs.

This is a good recipe base.  My husband really liked the crunchiness of the cornflakes, but the taste is bland as is.  Need to add spices.

I used the bag from the corn flakes box to make this recipe a little less messy--crunched the cereal, dipped the chicken in yogurt and then coated the chicken in the bag.  I also added dried dill weed to the yogurt to give it a little kick...delicious!  Very moist.

I cheated a little as I didnt have plain yogurt.  I used key lime yogurt and it was really tasty with a hint of sweetness.  Great basic recipe.  I cooked mine a little longer as we like it really crispy.

Very easy recipe, but not much flavor. Add different seasonings to kick it up a notch. Also, needed another 15 minutes to thoroughly cook chicken. Had a lot of yogurt left.

This turned out really well for me.  I used lemon yogurt and just did one breast to start.  I only used about half a container of yogurt and 1/2 cup of corn flakes.  I used the chicken that's individually wrapped, so I just opened the package, poured the yogurt on top then flipped it over and dredged the other side through the yogurt.  Then I crushed the corn flakes in a plastic zip top bag, and put the yogurt-covered breast inside the bag to coat it in crumbs. Worked great!

Then I baked it in the toaster oven at 325 degrees on a piece of foil sprayed with cooking spray for about 30 minutes, and it turned out perfectly crisp.  I flipped it about half way through baking so that it would get crispy on both sides.

The only thing I'd improve would be to add more seasoning.  Next time I would season it with salt and pepper, possibly a little hot sauce.  Definitely a very easy lunch and I'll definitely make it again.

This is a good receipe but the flaw is the chicken does get soggy on the bottom. After reading the review of bland, I did add my own favorite spices, such as lemon pepper, cayene pepper, onion powder to spice it up. Don't need 4 cups of yogurt, you can cut that back and I added an extra 1/2 c of cornflakes as well. But all and all I would make again.

My whole family loved the chicken !! I used 6 thin boneless chicken breasts, cooked at 350 for 30 min and then turned it up to 400 for 10 min. more.  I used boxed corflake crumbs and added dried parsley, garlic, pepper & salt to the cornflake crumbs. I also seasoned chicken with paprika, salt and pepper. Took others advice and sprayed coated chicken with cooking spray. Served on a mound of spaghetti with marinara sauce and mozzerella cheese.  Perfect chicken parmigiana !!! A+

Really good, though I did add a bunch of spices to the yogurt mixture. (Rosemary, garlic powder, italian seasoning, and a little hot sauce) Turned out moist and juicy.

It is indeed messy but worth it.  Don't need as much yogurt.  I don't normally have corn flakes so I used seasoned panko bread crumbs.  That and a little salt solved the blandness others have noted.

Vegetarian Option/Suitable for Chicken/Several Tweaks

I made so many tweaks that perhaps it's not fair, but I used the posted recipe as my base.  We're vegetarian, so I preheated store-bought "chikn" vegan strips.  Didn't have corn flakes, so I used Nature's Path Organic flax Plus Multibran Flakes (much heartier & held up well--didn't get soggy).  I only used 16 oz. yogurt and added onion powder, a Tuscan herb mix, and black pepper.  Baked on convection at 375 for 30 mins.  DELICIOUS!  Can't wait to make them again!

I marinated the chicken in garlic and lemon juice, which was great. But, the yogurt made the chicken look "slimy" and the corn flakes did not adhere to the chicken.

A tasty, reliable standby.  Also works subbing mayo for the yogurt (I used mayo with olive oil) and pre-packaged cornflake crumbs.

Yummy!!!! I added some Goya seasoning to the chicken before coating with plain yogurt and added some Montreal chicken seasoning to the crushed cornflakes. I also sprayed a little Pam on the chicken after cornflake coating added. My 3 and 6-year old loved it! Will definitely make again.

Tasted better than I could imagine. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs were very moist, although next time I'll add seasoning to the yogurt. Easy to make, cleanup was minimal. This recipe will become a "regular" in our house!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used vanilla yogurt and Life cereal instead of cornflakes and added garlic salt. I also used breast halves and had to cook it for 1 hour vs. 30 minutes. The family loved the flavor and gave it 4 stars. We'll make this again.

I made it as it said and have to agree with other reviewers, it's a bit bland. I'm sure it could be made tastier with some imaginative seasoning, but to be honest, the cornflake taste just didn't work for me.  On the plus side, the chicken was very moist.

I added spices to the chicken for flavor and brushed the chicken with coconut oil instead of using yogurt (used what I had on hand)  Chicken was very moist and I would use the recipe again.

I am Italian so I added 2 teaspoons of Italian seasonings it was just enough that it didn't take away from the original recipe. It was very good.

This was a good recipe for a fried-like chicken craving without the fat.  Being from Louisiana, I had to add some spice to it!
I added a bit of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and of course Tony Chachere's  seasoning. I added to the yogurt dipped chicken and let it sit a few minutes before cooking. I did not need 4 cups of yogurt; about two. 
Next time I will crush corn flakes  in a ziplock bag. 
Mine was crunchy .

Very delicious.  I seasoned the yogurt with lemon pepper and the corn flakes with Tony Chachere's.  Once breaded I placed them on a half sheet pan cooling rack on a half sheet pan.  Came out very crispy.

Good starting recipe but you definitely need to add spices to the corn flakes. I added toasted sesame seeds, oregano, lemon pepper, cayenne.

Love this recipe. I did make a couple of changes though. I seasoned the yogurt and marinated the chicken for several hours, I also seasoned the cereal prior to crunching it up. I poured the seasoned cereal on to a plate and coated the chicken on both sides. I covered a shallow baking sheet with aluminum foil and placed a rack on top, be sure to spray the rack with cooking spray so the coating does not stick. I also sprayed the chicken with butter flavored cooking spray prior to baking. I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and turned it over to continue to bake for another 20 minutes. I do think I will cut the baking time to a total of 30 minutes next time.

Way too bland, must have seasonings.  I will make this again because the chicken was so tender and possibly use thighs instead of breasts

I added flour, garlic powder and cayenne pepper to the crushed corn flakes. I used 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt and two chicken legs with thigh attached. I took the skin off the chicken prior to coating. I used only I cup of corn flakes. I crushed the corn flakes by putting them in a zip lock bag and using a rolling pin to crush/flatten the flakes. I sprayed the coated chicken with vegegatble oil spray prior to baking. My husband and I enjoyed the finished product.  Very moist.

But why not add seasoning? Corn flakes are pretty bland. I added salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder and even some jalapeno seasoning.

This was delicious, and so easy.  It's easy also to substitute other cereal flakes or textures (try shredded wheat!) instead of the corn flakes.  I agree that additional seasoning would help.

This was good; however, I added salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese to the cornflakes mixture, but it was still slightly bland. Next time I will add more of the seasonings.

Definitely needs seasoning.  I tried an approximate teaspoon of garlic salt and it still didn't do enough (for us).  Kellogg makes Corn Flake Bread Crumbs, so our mess was minimal.  (Doing anything with a 4-yr old is messy!)  I will try this again soon!

This was alright. Mine turned out a little sour from the yogurt and the cornflakes didn't stick very well. But the chicken was pretty tender.

This recipie was absolutely amazing! SO MOSIT!! I used a nonfat vanilla yogurt and frosted flakes on my chicken and bran flakes on my husbands. The bran flakes were not as good as the frosted but the hubby said they were still good. After we ate it I immediately called my mom and told her she HAD to make it. Definitely a keeper!!
