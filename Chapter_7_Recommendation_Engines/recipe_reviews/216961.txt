I love this combination of flavors, and we are big fans of teriyaki pineapple burgers here. I recently made mini meatballs with this recipe and they turned out amazing! You can do them in the slow cooker or the oven and they are a great party/luau food!

I didn't use the ginger because I'm not a fan.  I also should have thought about adding some kind of spice to the meat instead.  It turned out a bit bland- probably not due to the original recipe.  If you omit the ginger make sure you add a little something something instead!

very delicious, this is a new staple at our house. These do well in a skillet on top of the stove too. Any kind of white cheese on top is good, we used muenster. I also substituted ground ginger from the spice cabinet when I ran out of fresh ginger and they tasted just as good.

I made this with ground chicken and grated a little more fresh ginger to the patties and more teriyaki sauce. It was delicious!

These were just 'ok'. Not a lot of flavor. We added more teriaki sauce and that helped a little. However, I don't think I'll make these again.

The recipe calls for canned pineapple juice... don't use fresh juice. Fresh pineapple juice contains an enzyme (Bromelain) that breaks down proteins. When this is allowed to sit with your meat it keeps everything from sticking together... resulting in a burger that has the texture of canned dog food you threw on the grill.

Wanted a healthier way to make burgers.  Of all the turkey burger recipes this is the best we have tried.  Since turkey is such a lean meat/protein, I would suggest using the ground turkey that is 93/7.  I put the formed burgers in the freezer for about 30 minutes.  This made the burgers firm and we had no problem with the burgers falling apart while on the grill.    The grilled pineapple adds the sweet while the cheese adds the saltly/savory.  Cheddar cheese is what we use, however I am looking to try another type cheese just to switch it up a bit.

First time ever makin' burgers, and was very easy to do. Simple recipe, really. If you don't wanna' mess with ginger, I don't think I found too much of the flavor to really need it. But DELICIOUS!

These were very good. I used ground ginger instead of fresh. The only problem I had was the meat (turkey) was so moist that it fell through the grill and I lost a good amount of burger. Will make these again.

This was a flavorful way to eat a turkey burger! Yum! The only thing I would say is that I thought adding the pineapple juice to the sauce was unnecessary as it made it so runny and I preferred it thicker. I added more of the teriyaki sauce (without the pineapple juice) to the burgers after grilling. (I didn't use kikkoman brand sauce). I also added a slice of tomato with I thought gave it extra flavor and texture.

These were a bit of a disaster. I had the same problem of the meat just falling apart, even when I added an egg to the second two patties (after giving up on the first two, which turned out like taco meat). I guess the flavor was good, but the so-not-like-a-burger, nearly-falling-apart texture was too distracting to care much.

Great! Usually I don't like turkey burgers, but these were yummy! I made sliders and also I used Ken's Honey Teriyaki instead of Kikkoman, which I couldn't find. I wonder about why it says to reserve 2 Tbsp sauce for the burgers and add 2 Tbsp to the turkey mixture. What to do with the other 4 Tbsp?

This was a huge hit! I made it twice for a couple of parties by the pool and everyone loved it. It really tasted amazing with some spicy mustard on it. Even the ketchup lovers tried it with the mustard.

I didn't have panko crumbs and at the suggestion of a friend, I added about 1/5 cup of quick oats to hold the meat together.  Worked like a charm!  They puffed up and stayed together perfectly on the grill and you did not taste the oats at all.  They did not have a ton of teriyaki flavor, even after basting, so I think next time I will omit the pineapple juice and double up the teriyaki.  Served them on sweet hawaiian buns.  The kids gobbled them up.

This was such an easy recipe. It was a huge hit in our house. My kids asked for it again. I added fresh avocado slices on top of the Monterey Jack cheese and then sprinkled chopped pineapple over. I put the patty over rice and poured the extra teriyaki mixture over the turkey patty and rice.

My daughter made these and they were spectacular.  She substituted almond flour for the panko bread crumbs, and she added 1 tablespoon of garlic and 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro.  She cooked them in a smoker and had carmelized onions on the side for those that wanted them.  They were exquisite.  I made them last night and screwed it up somehow.  The burgers were very moist so I had to add more almond flour.  It's just going to take a little practice to get them to perfection but this recipe is a keeper.

Great! I added some thinly sliced green onion to the meat mixture. Also, since I used a fresh pineapple, I just pureed some to get the juice that the recipe called for. Next time I might grate some garlic in too or add some black pepper. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

We made these tonight for dinner, I added one finely chopped jalapeño, a small finely chopped red pepper, and about 2 more tablespoons of the pineapple/glaze mixture to the meat.  There is extra pineapple/glaze that the recipe doesn't say what to do with.  I put some on the pineapples before grilling but still had some left over.  It's kind of a waste.  But anyway, we made small sliders with a piece of lettuce & sweet chili sauce. Might try some green onion in them too next time.  Highly recommend the peppers, helps keep them moist.  Almost forgot, I did add some salt & pepper to the meat. I will definitely make again.
