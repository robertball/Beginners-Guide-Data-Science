I added an extra banana and didn't use the equal- chose regular sugar.  To me, the smoothie turned out great....but to my picky husband, he was wanting it to be a lot sweeter and the equal probably would have cured that.  I would definitely make this again, and maybe used more berry than banana next time.

Overall it is a good smoothie. The only problem for me is that it was a little too sugary.

I tried this and it is just GREAT! The only thing is that I used a lowfat (vanilla soy milk) and it is still yummy.

I substitute Stevia for the Equal and it's much better for you.  Tastes great.  I have this for breakfast every morning.

Quite good. I actually used Splenda instead of Equal, but this recipe is pretty good even without any sweetener. If you had sweet enough fruit, you wouldn't even need it.

I also used low fat soy milk and substituted the Equal with Splenda. I agree with the last reviewer about adding a whole banana for two servings. This is a very good recipe!

This is yummy!  I also used the lowfat vanilla soymilk and it tastes great.  I also agree that using Stevia is better for you than the equal (if you're drinking this because you care about your health). If you don't use Stevia, you may as well use sugar since ther won't be much difference between that and the Equal.  I also used a bit more banana than called for(reduced the recipe to 2 servings, but used one whole banana instead of the half banana called for), just personal preference.  My seven year old son has already guzzled his down before I've finished this review!  Guess I'd better finish mine as well!

I used a single serving carton of vanilla Silk for this recipe, and added an entire frozen banana, but only about a 1/2 cup of frozen strawberries. I thought the smoothie was sweet enough without adding any Splenda, and would definitely make this again. It's thick and creamy, and really fills you up with good stuff instead of something far less nutritious.
