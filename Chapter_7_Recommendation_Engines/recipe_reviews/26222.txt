my mom has made these every Christmas for the last 35 years and are one of our family's all-time favorites.  The only difference is we use granulated sugar instead of icing sugar in the topping and 2 cups coconut instead of 1 1/2 cups.  Make these in a 8x8 (or 9x9) pan tho so they're nice and thick or double the recipe for a 9x13 pan

These were absolutely delicious!  I used water instead of milk/egg in the crust -- it brings out the saltiness more and tastes great.  Also, I used real sugar instead of confectioner's sugar -- yum!

They are really yummy but the crust is too thin when spread in a 9x13 pan. Probably double the crust recipe, makes it easier to spread too.

As far as taste these are very good :)
However, using a 9x13 pan made the crust too thin.  Next time I make this, I will double the crust.  As is, I would recommend using an 8x8 pan and decreasing the raspberry jam.

25 minutes wasn't enough for the topping to cook and my oven is usually quite hot. Also too sweet.

These squares have a great taste.  The base is a bit strange to work with and was not what I was expecting, it was very difficult to spread evenly.

These would be good if the base crust had some flavor to it.  It was quite salty, and I'm positive I followed the recipe exactly.  The filling and topping were wonderful, my kids and hubby picked the crust off it.  It is now 2 days later, and most of them have gone uneaten...that's not normal in this house...nothing I bake lasts 2 days here!

Either I did something really wrong when I followed this recipe, or these are simply the worst raspberry squares I have ever tasted.  I made them to bring to a potluck, and I couldn't bring myself to even serve them!

Made these for my seniors group and they loved it! The way they gobbled them down I should have made two pans of them. making them again next week.
