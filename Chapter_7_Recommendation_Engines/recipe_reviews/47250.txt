I really enjoyed this chili! I love barley and am thrilled to have an exciting way to eat it (rather than the usual beef-barley soup).  I made two changes to the recipe though - I added about double the amt of chili powder; and /i could only find "regular" barley (the kind in the bag, Goya brand - so I cooked it much longer - it probably simmered for over an hour which really let the flavors develop and blend.  I will definitely make this again!!

This was the best tasting chili I ever had.  I added a little more barley than the recipe called for.  It also freezes really well.

Great healthy chili recipe.  Did'nt have quick-cook barley, so I used the regular kind and cooked for about 1 1/2 hrs and added the black beans the last 1/2 hr.  It turned out delicious. This recipe went right to the recipe book!

This is pretty much my favorite... It's easy, healthy, comfort food.  I've had so many people ask me for the recipe.  I add less meat and more barley adn serve with Buttermilk cornbread.  It's really the perfect meal.

This was a hit at my Super Bowl party yesterday.  The only bad thing about this chili was there were very little leftovers.  If I had to change anything, I'd cut the amount of broth added in half, and I'd add a little more spice--A couple drops of Insanity Sauce would do the trick ;-)
Overall this was excellent.

I didn't have any of the quick barley, so I used the regular kind, put in a whole can of chicken broth and cooked it for about an hour.

This was so good the first night and even better warmed up for lunch the next day!  My husband's usually skeptical when I use ground turkey in place of ground beef, but he even said he didn't think beef would improve on this chilli, and asked when we could have it again.  This is definitely going into the regular rotation!

Basically a good recipe, but it needs quite a bit more seasoning. I added a lot more garlic, chili powder and some more salt. It was much better the second day too!

This soup is great but needs some changes to be amazing.  The flavour needs to be upped.  Double all the spices use 2 cups of veg. juice 2 cans of tomatoes and 2 cup of chicken broth.  With these changes this becomes a wonderful soupy style chili.  YUM!

Very good but a little bland.  Next time I will add a little bit more of a kick to it.

Yummy!  My first attempt at chili-making.  Instead of bell pepper I dumped a can of diced ortega chilis in, and I used plain diced tomatoes (no chilies).  Also added a few dashes of Tapatio to spice it up a bit.  Next time I make this I will use more garlic (maybe 4 cloves instead of 2).  This made a good-size batch, since there are just two of us we froze the rest for another day.  Will be making this one again.

This was so very easy. I modified the recipie by spreading the chili into a casserole dish and adding cornbread refridgerator biscuits and then baking.The cornbread topping was a hit and really turned this into a main dish. I made this for Cinco De Mayo and it went in a matter of minutes.
I highly recommend, however, next time I will also jazz it up by adding a little corn to the recipie.

I cooked this recipe in the crock pot.  I had a busy day planned (on the weekend) so I browned the turkey, onions, green peppers, and all the seasonings in a skillet and added them to the crock pot with all the other ingredients and let simmer all day.  Yummy!!

It has a slow kick, but still seems bland. Perhaps more cumin, oregano, garlic, & surely salt would help. There aren't very many beans for a chili recipe. I'll probably make it again with double the beans & vamped-up spices.

I love it and so does everyone I share it with! I've made it with and without beans and its a hit. I've also substituted oatmeal for the barley one time when I was out of barley. The oatmeal absorbed a lot of the moisture but was otherwise ok.

I followed ANGELAKOMLJENOVIC advice and doubled the spices and used 2 cups vegetable juice, 2 cups chicken stock, and 2 cans diced tomatoes.  It was excellent this way and even better the next day.  Great autumn recipe.

We LOVED this. We eat chili fairly regularly, and usually eat it with rice.  But the barley is a great alternative, and the flavor is fantastic.  Two thumbs up from us!

This is a really easy recipe that makes great leftovers. This recipe has made it into my regular rotation. The only thing that I've changed is that I add about 1/2 cup of frozen mixed vegetables.

Healthy, but not for me.  Good seasoning ingredients, just needs more.  This really is not chili.  Wrong beans.  Barley?  Good as a turkey casserole with less liquid.

LOVE this recipe - Made it last week during the blizzard (we're in Mass)  and my husband just asked me to make it for the Superbowl.  Great served with tortilla chips.  I cut the spice for my family and it was still great.

I absolutely love this recipe.  Not only is it helpful, but it's easy.  To add more zing to it, I add 2 bottles of non-light beer as well as two cans of Ro-tel tomatoes with green chiles.  This has become a cool-weather favorite in my household!

THIS WAS REALLY GOOD AND EASY.  I ONLY HAD A 10 OZ CAN OF TOMATOES W/GREEN CHILES SO I ADDED 4 OZS OF CHICKEN BROTH.  IT WAS STILL DELICIOUS!
