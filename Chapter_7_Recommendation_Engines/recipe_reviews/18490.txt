I melted the choc chips in the microwave.  I did overfill the cupcakes - you should only go 1/2 full!  VERY VERY VERY GOOD!!!  All of us enjoy these!  I'll make again - and again - and again!!

Really easy to make and looked great for our space themed party. A little bland though. We served with Ice cream and then they were great!

We had a surplus of mini marshmallows and needed a creative way to use them up.  My son of 6 helped and we had no problems.  I think the confusion may only be in the order of the recipe....it breaks down as most cakes do- mix dry, mix wet and add together. Taste wise they were good...my son loved them!  Next time I would not mix marshmallows into the batter, but would place several into the muffin cups and add batter on top. (Haven't tried that yet, so can't swear by it.) By the way, store in airtight container and they get REALLY moist and gooey.  That is a good thing!

Made as is.  It's a cool idea but we did not like the overall taste.  I was hoping for a chocolatey gooey cupcake but this was very bland.  Fill the liner a little more than half way so it will be up to the rim.
