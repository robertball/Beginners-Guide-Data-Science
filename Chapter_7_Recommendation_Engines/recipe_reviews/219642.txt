You have to have a super sweet tooth to enjoy this one.  I liked it, but I would probably cut the glaze in half.  My cake mix was only a 15 ounce, so maybe that had something to do with it, too.  Next time I might also try this one as a bundt cake.  Overall a good one, just tweak to your taste on the sweetness level.

In the oven right now!  Like the fact that you can easily "make" your own "buttermilk".  Smells great but I guess the "proof will be in the pudding".

This cake was Awesome!!! My husband did not want to share this cake with anyone. Don't expect this cake to hang around, long. If you like nuts, add some to it, I did.

Many people said this cake was too sweet.  I therefore used about a fourth of the brown sugar called for by the recipe, but still thought it was sickly sweet.  If I had to do it all over again, I'd skip the glaze or at least cut back on it.

I rated five stars because my only complaint was how very sweet this was, and I am not big on overly sweet treats. BUT... my family is and they loved this cake! So five stars it is! For me, the next time I make it (and there will be a next time!), I will cut back on the icing and make a light drizzle over the top instead of pouring it over to soak into the cake. That will cut down on the sweetness for me (without sacrificing taste) and still make my family quite happy. Thanks for a great recipe that easily tweaks for those of us who love the taste of this cake, but maybe want it a bit less sweet. :)

The taste was great, but the cake itself was to wet after soaking with the milk/vanilla/ confectionary sugar mixture

This cake is really really good.  The cinnamon really comes through and I was not disappointed.  I caution against making the quantity of glaze the recipe suggests.  Other posters commented that the glaze is overkill and produces a sickly sweet final product.  I would agree as I made 1/3 of the glaze and it was perfect for our preferred level of sweetness (which is pretty sweet - my husband and son love sugary treats). All-in, I'd definitely make this again! It was super easy and worth the time to make.

De-LISH-ous!  It is sweet, but it is soooo good.  In the words of my son, "that's dangerous!"  I probably will make/use half the glaze the next time.  Maybe.  :-)

I agree with previous reviewers who say this is way too sweet.  Cutting the icing and adding some nuts would probably make it more to my liking.  My husband said it was excellent, though, so I went with  4 stars instead of the 3 I'd have issued on my own.

The cloying sweetness of this cake was the issue. I think it could be pretty good with some tweaks. If I make it again, would add chopped pecans to the cake, would not poke the holes and would use much less glaze (maybe 1/3 recipe for the whole cake). I only made a half batch of this recipe and was glad I did-couldnt have eaten a full cake.
