Great hearty soup. My first time using lentils and I feel it was a success. I'm a spice head and also recovering from a shoulder injury so I loaded up on the anti-inflammatory turmeric, heavy cayenne, some sriracha, and extra garlic.

this took MUCH longer than 20 minutes for the lentils to soften.  I am making it now, and I am about to go over the 40 minute mark

This was very simple and easy to make.  It is very filling and nutritional.  I would probably add more spices since I like it on the spicy side and I added some curry powder in as well to give it more of an exotic taste.  Definitely a good go to soup that I can make with things I usually have around the house.

Very good and basic recipe. I will make again but will use a little more carrot and celery. My husband is vegan so I of course used vegetable broth rather than chicken. I also added a pinch of allspice and cumin.

YUM!  I used yellow lentils and extra veggies.  Also, I'm not a fan of crushed red pepper so I used cayenne and chili pepper.  I'm crushing bowls of this stuff even in 80 degree weather... it's just that good.

Holy cow this turned out good!  The recipe doesn't specify but I used the tiny French green lentils instead of red or brown, I didn't have chicken stock on hand so used water and chicken bouillon cubes.  This was terrific.  I added a dash more red pepper for extra bite.  I also had some smoked sausage that I cubed and browned with the veggies but it would have still been fabulous without it.  This recipe is simple and so good.  I looked at other recipes before settling on this one, this has general items most people have on hand, no need for white wine or some of the other stuff the other recipes ask for, I plan to make this again!  Thanks for sharing a good recipe!

I made this recipe but only had red lentils.I used vegie stock and added a few bay leaves and instead of tomato pastes I had a can of fire roasted diced tomato and blended omatoes in blender just a bit.I took this to church and everyone wanted recipe .they even wanted it for the bulletin.the red lentils make a the difference because I made it again with brown lentils and did not taste near as good.

I am not sure what happened to mine.   Mine turned very bland, and mostly tasting like lentils.   I added some potatoes to it, and after that the spices seemed to diminish a lot, if not totally disappear.  Before I added them, it was quite tasty and the spices were very prominent.  If the potatoes are what changed it, then without them this is an excellent recipe.  I am going to give it another go at a future date w/o potatoes.

Really tasty dish. I basically followed the recipe, using red lentils. I doubled the recipe, and added the zest and juice of half a lemon, 2 diced Roma tomatoes, and I boosted all the spices (I like garlic and red pepper!). My dried red lentils cooked in about 20 minutes as advertised. Very hearty and tasty. Will save this recipe.

Very hearty soup, but I added a little more carrots to it, and a few diced potatoes.  I will definitely make again!
