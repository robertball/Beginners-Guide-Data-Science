This was wonderful! The beer smelled awful when first beginning to heat it but once the cheese was added it became super fragrant. We had to stir it, continuously, for almost 10 more minutes than we were supposed to because the cheese was not thickening like we wanted it. Served with cauliflower and french bread.

I boiled a can of bud select, let it simmer till the foam was going away, then switched heat to low and added a bunch of shredded cheddar and gruyere. Man gruyere is expensive, but the processed gruyere doesn't work, you have to get the real deal. I added the 2T flour, a little salt, pepper, garlic powder, and tiny bit of worcestershire.  I did this kinda ghetto because I dont have a fondue pot, I just transferred the fondue to a slow cooker set to warm mode :) It worked:) Served with chopped breads and sausage.

First time making fondue and this was an easy recipe.  Make sure to let the beer simmer a little until the foam is almost gone and stirred the whole time while slowly adding the cheese.  We used this to dip steak and bread, it was great.  Now I will try more ambitious recipes in the futre but for a first timer was perfect no issues.

FINALLY!  A recipe that doesn't clump up and yet has a good swiss taste.  We used Cache brand extra sharp cheese and some expensive swiss.  We have been doing fondue every Christmas Eve for 19 years and never gave up on finding a recipe!  We used Coors Light and 1 -2 teaspoons of tabasco sauce and dipped bread, granny smith apples and cheese tortellini.

Tweaked the recipe a bit due to limited options in the fridge. Used a can of colors light with medium cheddar and a Mexican cheese blend. It didn't seem to be as think and cheesy as I wanted so i added a little bit of cornstarch and a lot more cheese. Not only did my husband and I eat all of it with our dinner but I swear I've been craving it randomly since. Oh, and one more thing, I made mine in a medium sauce pan because I don't have a fondue pot and it worked just fine. Can't wait to make it again!

I just added minced garlic to the pot, but otherwise made this as instructed.  It was a hit with the crowd of visitors! We will make this again and again.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Worked perfectly, the key to avoid clumping is to add the cheese mixture a little bit at a time while constantly whisking. We left out the hot pepper sauce as the kids were eating it as well and still tasted very good.

this may have been a case of too many cooks causing trouble, but this recipe really didn't work for us.  We tried it with cheddar/jack cheese, and that may have been the issue, but the cheese never melted all the way.  It ended up really gloppy, and no combination of more cheese, more beer, more heat, less heat, more stirring...ad nauseum would fix it.  Never had this trouble before!  It still tasted ok, but gloppy is not the texture we were going for.  however, I'm sure this was a case of 'user error' rather than fault of the recipe.  Just wish I could figure out where we went wrong.

Served it with soft pretzels (freezer section of the grocery store) and it was a huge hit! I served it out of a small crockpot so it stayed warm which worked out perfectly. I will absolutely make this again!

This is excellent!  You just have to keep at the stirring with a whisk and don't give up.  It looked horrible for me but then it was all incorporated and creamy in the end.  Great with blanched broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, apples and pears.

Fantastic!  Mine got a little grainy, but I suspect inferior cheese was to blame.

When I added the flour, the cheese did not consolidate like it should, even after stirring and cooking for 8-10 minutes.  I whisked in an extra half tablespoon flour, and that helped, so I whisked in the other half.  Bingo - perfection.  That perfection was short-lived.  In the time it took me to bring everything to the table, my fondue had gone from smooth and creamy to grainy to lumpy.  I took it back to the stove top, stirred vigorously, and reheated a bit, but it didn't help.

My family and I have fondue every year for NYE. This year, my husband shared that he hasn't really liked the cheese fondues I've made over the years. What?!? So, I tried this recipe and it was huge hit with him and the rest of the family. Thank you!

I followed the ingredients exactly as written except for the hot sauce. We put in 6 dashes instead of the 1 in the recipe. Did not find it very spicy though. Thought it was perfect. 

It took a little longer than 5 mins to bring the beer (used Coors Lite) to a boil but other than that we followed the instructions as written. I grated both cheeses and added a small handful of the mix about every 2 mins or so and constantly stirred (we used a spatula to mix it) . I was using an electric fondue pot and we never had to add more beer and it did not clump or harden on us. 

Would 100% recommend and will use again.

Our tradition is to fondue on Xmas Eve with the family.  We did this cheese receipe w/cheese tortellini, crusty bread & roasted vegetables.  Excellent.

I started on the stove top w/bud light...extra sharp cheese until melted, then transferred to fondue pot to keep warm.  It got gobbled..but I will say that I did have to add extra beer & closely monitor because it wanted to "curdle" quite often. 

I am sure this is user error & will keep trying to fix it.  This tastes & worked out great for us!!

Liked it very much, Cut back on the swiss.  Will add fontina or guyere the next time.  Too swissy for my taste.  Used Guiness Stout.

Easy, delicious cheese fondue recipe.  The only thing I changed was adding more of the hot sauce to it.  Loved the taste and texture.  Highly recommend this one.

Followed the directions to the letter.  Was a bit stringy/watery for my liking.  It may have been the cheddar.

I found the fondue extremely salty from the Swiss cheese.  I would suggest twice as much cheddar as Swiss and omitting the salt.  After adding more Cheddar, the fondue was delicious!  It was simple to make with simple ingredients.

I’ve made this a dozen times! It’s always my go to fondue recipe! Been using it for at least 5 years now! Figured it was time I’d leave a review

Loved the flavor, but it separated...gooey clump of cheese floating in very liquidy mixture. I may have heated it too long or something. I’ll try making it again to see if I can figure out what went wrong

Got smoked gruyere from aldi dirt cheap. Did half Swiss half gruyere worked great. I did NOT use pre-shredded.  Was a little clumpy so I added pinch lemon juice(trick I read somewhere) and got out my stick blender- perfect! Added couple tablespoons of milk to thin out a little more too.

Made according to recipe and had no issues with any clumping and it turned out gooey enough! Used a local lager that is pretty smooth tasting but when paired in this recipe, the bitter taste in our mouths was enough to make us throw it out. Needs way more spices to counteract this!

Very easy to make. I have an electric fondue pot, so I could regulate the heat. I used a combination of sharp a mild shredded cheddar, lager beer, salt and pepper. Make sure each handful of cheese is melty smooth before adding another. When it was ready, I added a can of Chile (meat, no beans - my preference) heated it through, and to me, that put it over the top. Dippers were broccoli and crusty Italian bread. Perfect!

Note: the timing in the directions is way off if you are using an electric fondue pot at home.... mine simmered in about a minute and took about 1 more minute to melt all the cheese in.

Made exactly as stated and it came out all clumpy in the end.  Stirred like crazy but nothing helped. Tried to lower the heat, raise the heat, used double boiler and that helped a little. It still came out stringy though and wanted to curdle as the temp got higher.  Tasted good still and will try again, but maybe use less Swiss as some others have suggested. I used good high quality cheeses.

Excellent!  I diced the garlic after rubbing the sides and added to the simmering beer.  We serve with french bread, broccoli, cauliflower.  Has been a big hit every time we've served it.

This turned out good on my second try. First try I put a cup of both cheddar and Swiss and tried mixing it in the fondue pot as stated in the recipe. I stirred for about 45 minutes and ended up with a large glob of cheese that didn't mix with the beer so I threw that batch away. I tried again with only about a half cup of Swiss and 1.5 cups of cheddar and mixed it on the stove over low heat after beer came to a boil and this time it came together nicely in only about 10 minutes then transferred it to the fondue pot. I also crushed the garlic right in the mixture. I'm not sure what went wrong my first try but was great the second time around!

This was very good but a little plain.  I had to add some dry mustard, Worcestershire, and more garlic to spice it up a little.  I'll definitely make this again

Very good recipe. We used it for fondue--dipped bread, apple slices and blanched veggies.  Big hit!

Wonderful fondue recipe! Delicious. Will ise this one again. I substituted Jack for the swiss cheese which was great...just add the cheese VERY SLOW until melted.

This was a delicious fondue. I have two other recipes that I always use and they require wine. Well here it was on Christmas day and I had no wine to make my fondue so I did a quick search and found this one. I used a British pale ale, Swiss Emmental and a nice Cabot Sharp Cheddar and it was delicious. Everyone loved it. Used bread cubes, cut up apples, pears and some really tasty baby bratwurst from Trader Joe's to dip. I will add this to my other two recipes.

My MIL would make this for Christmas dinner. It is so delicious. Took me a few tries to get it right and have the cheese melt just right. I also found out last year that if it starts to get too cool it can get ugly but a quick heat up brings it all back together. I make this every year for the last 40 years for the Christmas Holidays

This was better than my other straight beer and cheddar recipe.
