I come from Yorkshire and you cannot make the perfect Yorkshire Pud without salt. Everything else is correct (altho goose fat is the best oil to use). Alos top Chefs recommend equal quantities of eggs, flour and milk (semi skimmed is supposed to be the best). The reason for the equal quantities is the fact that eggs can vary by as much as 20 gms per egg. Hope these tips help.

Work perfectly. These are a family tradition in our household. Our trick, is make the batter at least 1 hour before you are going to cook them, and let them get to room temp before pouring them into the prepared hot pan. Oh ya, also, use Homo Milk, works much better.

I have tried several yorkie recipes here and this is by far the best yet. These turned out 4" high! Tasted great, light and fluffy. My only suggestion is to always best to use your eggs and milk at room temperature. Good recipe.

Coming from England, I have been brought up on Yorkshire pudding and no roast beef dinner could ever be complete with out them.  I have used the same recipe for many years, but read all the reviews so decided to give this one a try.  These were just as good, as long as you add a pinch of salt (I know we are all trying to cut down on of salt intake, but Yorkshire puddings are not the same without it).  The other points I wanted to mention is to make sure your ingredients are at room temperature before you begin and when mixing, make as fluffy as you can, the more air you get into the mixture the better.  My Grandma always told me to let the batter sit for a good 20 minutes before putting into the pans.  This has always worked well for me.

As my first time makeing Yorkshire Pudding I didnt know what to expect.This was so easy and so good.I did add a little salt though. As someone else suggested I  put a cookie sheet under the muffin tin and I'm glad I did.The batter tends to push the oil out. I will make this again and again

I AM A SUPER FAN OF THIS PUDDING. I HAVE BEEN USING THE CLUB HOUSE PACKAGES FOR YEARS FEARING THAT IF I MAKE MY OWN FROM SCRATCH, IT WOULD RUIN MY MEAL. I LOVE YORKSHIRE PUDDING, AND IS THE MAIN PART OF MY ROAST BEEF DINNER. ANYWAYS, I TRIED THIS RECEPIE AND LIKED IT BETTER THAN WHAT I HAVE BEEN USING AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT. THE ONLY THING, I TOOK THEM OUT ABOUT 5 MINUTES BEFORE BECAUSE THE OUTSIDE WAS GETTING PRETTY BROWN AND I DID NOT WANT A HARD CRUST. EXCELLENT RECIPE, WILL MAKE AGAIN AND SCRATCH MY OTHER METHOD - THANKS MIRANDA KLEIN

Excellent and very easy to make.  I followed some advice from other reviewers and let my eggs and milk go to room temperature.  These were perfect and melt-in-your mouth.  I will definitely make these again.

Yorkshire Puddings are wonderful.  My grandma was and mother is from England. They always make it up at least 2 hour before putting into oven (to allow mixture to become room temp.) and cover the bowl with a clean tea towel, then set aside. I always add a good pinch of salt.  Also, right before pouring into muffin pan whip/beat the mixture again using a slotted large spoon or whisk (whipping bubbles in mixture).  This should make them rise better. Thanks for sharing!

This has been my go-to recipe for yorkies for a few years now! The ratio of ingredients is PERFECT & they come out high, fluffy & hollow every time (due in part to the whipping of the batter I believe, & it's ESSENTIAL to let th oil or drippings heat in the oven at least 10 minutes, 15 is better) - my family LOVES them! I've used pan drippings insead of oil which is the best way in my opinion but when I do use plain veggie oil I add 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of salt to the batter. The high heat is another important factor that allows them to pop-up & cook on the outside yet remain soft on the inside, just watch them because all ovens are different so your time may be different from anothers...So good in fact that I'm making another batch for our leftovers tonight! ***UPDATE 2/15/12: Making these AGAIN tonight to go with our roast beef & realized that I'd failed to mention an "essential" or two...LET YOUR MILK & EGGS GET TO ROOM TEMP PRIOR TO MAKING THESE - and WHIP THE BATTER IMMEDIATELY BEFORE LADELING INTO THE MUFFIN TINS!!! These tips ensure the "sky high" results you're looking for!
Leftovers??? We like to reheat them slightly in the microwave, dust them with powdered sugar & squeeze lemon juice over them for a dee-liciously different breakfast treat!

I have been looking for 4 years for a good yorkshire recipe - mine always are doughy.  Not with this recipe, however!  Great job, it's going to be a staple in my house!

PS - Didn't have any veg oil, so used butter instead.  Turned out great

These were very dense and bland, I threw them out.  I think I will take advice of other reviewers and let milk mixture get to room temp first and add some salt and pepper.

The secrets to the perfect Yorkie pudding (basically the same as popovers): First, bring all ingredients to room temperature BEFORE baking, and I actually have always let them warm up before I even mix it all. #2) NO PEEKING!  If you open the oven door for a peek, you automatically lower the temp of the oven by a few degrees. These need to go into a pre-heated oven AND LEFT THERE without lowering the oven temp that leads to a high  risk of them falling!

I grew up with Yorkie puds overseas in Africa at boarding school.  These were good and it was my first time attempting to make Yorkie puds myself so decided upon this recipe over the myriad of recipes here.  I gave this 4 stars for the following reasons.  They did rise sky high, however, I think that the oven temperature needs to be lower.  After 12 minutes in the oven, mine got super super dark, and I had to lower the temperature to 375 and let them cook for an additional 10 minutes.  Did not even get to the 30 -35 minute cooking time.  They were then done inside and out and nicely hollowed, although I did note that a lot of them kinda folded in on themselves so they were lopsided.   I also used the drippings from the roast beef that I prepared instead of veg. oil.

I left everything on the counter to warm up to room temperature first. I mixed everything in a large Pyrex measuring cup for easy pouring so I wasn't able to whisk until frothy. I just whisked until I saw a few bubbles surface. I put the pan on the lowest oven rack and turned down the temp to 350 after 10 minutes.

these were so easy and delicious!   i used a muffin pan for these, and the oil spilled out a little while cooking. so i would suggest to put a cookie sheet or something underneath the muffin pan, so it doesnt spill out!   also, let the mixture sit out until it's at room temp before cooking.

This is the recipe that I have been using, practically every Sunday for 25 years.  I have perfected it to fit "exactly" 12 large muffin pans by doing 3 eggs, with 1 1/2 cups of both flour and milk.  My husband just recently saw on tv, that yorkshire pudding should have about 6 eggs and he has tried to fool around with the recipe, but has conceded that this one wins hands down.

Awesome! I made these with a prime rib roast for christmas dinner - I used 1/2 rib drippings and 1/2 bacon grease (needed the rest of the rib drippings for sauce). They were "sky high" and delicious to boot, thanks for a great, easy recipe.

Okay my friends, I can't be a complete dolt!  I bake and bake, without a problem, but when it comes to Yorkshire, I suck!!! I followed the recipe meticulously, but NOOOOOOOO, my Yorkies did not rise and they burnt to a crisp in 10 minutes.  I can't seem to get it right no matter what.  I'm joining Yorkshires anonymous now!

I found this recipe about two years ago, and we still make this one whenever we have the craving for Yorkies. 

The ONLY change I make is to add a tsp of salt since the original recipe left it out. I also use melted butter in the muffin tins for a rich flavor instead of the oil! 

It's also very important to allow the batter to go to room temperature before putting into the hot muffin tins.  ;-)

Mother was Brittish so I know my Yorkshire Pudding. Only change, and this is a must in my household, is to use meat drippings instead of the vegetable oil.

I have been making these for a few years now.  I give it 5 stars with the addition of salt, and ensuring the batter is room temperature. I find that if I use 4 small to medium eggs, and reduce the flour and milk to 1 1/2cups, I get 12 perfectly filled muffin tins.

These were unexpectedly rich! I had never had yorkshire pudding before and they just looked like plain dinner rolls to me. They went fabulously with the pot roast I made, soaking up all the juices. I took others advice and let my eggs and milk stand at room temp. about 1 hour. My batter was very frothy. I also added a healthy dose of kosher salt, maybe a tablespoon, with the flour. It makes a difference! They were done at 20 minutes. At 27 they started to smell like they were burning so I took them out.  I will definitely be making these again and again, but with a shorter bake time. A very impressive result with a simple recipe.

Absolutely delicious! These were my first attempt at making Yorkshire pudding and everyone enjoyed the end result served alongside prime rib of beef.  I used about 1 1/4 tsp of the pan drippings from the roast in the bottom of the muffin tins, and I would reduce this amount next time by probably 1/2 tsp.  I did add about 1 tsp of salt to the batter and in my opinion, it needed more (this is also why I only gave the recipe 4 stars).

I kept staring into the oven as these continued to rise. These get much more vertical than the ones my mother makes from scratch! I also let the ingredients come to room temp first - I think that is a given rule with yorkshire pudding.

These yorkshire puddings are a hit at home. They are moist and flavourful and go perfectly with any beefy dinner! Watch them carefully so as to not overbake!

Great recipe but I had to add salt and white pepper!  These crispy cuties came out beautifully.  My picky 6-year-old who doesn't like anything LOVED these.  Just add a teaspoon of sea salt or coarse Kosher and a pinch or two of white pepper (so as not to mar the beautifully butter yellow color).  My husband took the rest to work and I got two calls from wives for the recipe!

My house still smells like smoking oil, but it was worth it! I combined the eggs and milk about an hour ahead of time and left them out on the counter to get to room temperature. I used olive oil, which didn't seem to smoke visibly. After about 15 minutes in the oven with no visible smoke, I took the muffin pan out and ladled the batter into the cups. At 30 minutes, they were perfect. I took them directly out of the oven and they stayed "sky high" throughout the meal. My guests were impressed. :-)

Made these tonight for Christmas dinner (main course was prime rib).  They were a hit with everyone!  They rose beautiful and everyone was commenting about how cute/pretty they were.  I followed some other reviews and let the eggs and milk get to room temp and added salt.  The only problem I had was, despite all the oil in the muffin pans some of them stuck to my nonstick pan and were really difficult to get out.  I think 25-30 minutes is plent for cooking time (but had an oven that cooked a little unevenly so that might have been the problem).  They still tasted and looked great!  Thanks for the recipe!

I had never had yorkshire pudding before trying this recipe. As others suggested I added a little salt and pepper. These were a perfect complement to pot roast and vegetables. My husband was amazed at how high they rose. He kept asking for more. Will be making these again!

AWESOME!!! first time ever making yorkies for my British partner(it only took 5 years, haha) these were dense in the bottom but that's just the way we like them.  I did add salt to the batter as another had mentioned and measured out equal parts egg, flour and milk.  I also used lard because that's what I had on hand.

If yours didn't rise, you did it wrong, period. The science behind this is that they rise from the heat pressure of the hot oil. They also cannot stick if you did it right. Read carefully: the oil does not go in the batter. It's a step that will make or break this recipe. I don't think our family particularly cares for these, but the recipe comes out just fine, producing tender, soft-on-the-inside but crispy-topped golden brown muffin-like hollow breads. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent and super easy.  I might bake them for a few minutes less than 35 next time, as they seemed quite dark to me, although my husband and my guests argued that they were perfect!

Excellent!!  I have never made Yorkshire pudding before and thought it would be worth a try.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Filled the muffin cups about 3/4 full.  Boy, do these ever rise.  They were done after about 28 minutes. The family loved them. Great crispy outside and soft, airy inside.  Will definitely make again.

I have made this 3 years in a row with our Christmas Eve prime rib dinner and it's wonderful. It has never failed and everyone always comes back for seconds. Add the pinch of salt, use room temperature ingredients and place cookie sheets under your muffin tins to keep your oven clean. It's a no fail delicious recipe.

Fantastic and easy, thanks for sharing!  I always halve the recipe for the 2 of us or else we'd eat them all.  I add a bit of salt and let the batter rest on the counter for a couple of hours before baking.  Never open the oven or else the yorkies won't rise as high.

Mine turned out pretty dense. I will try again, this time whizzing them up in my blender and then letting them set. My arm got tired from whisking! ;) Added salt as other reviewers stated. They tasted perfect! I will be adding to my collection!

This recipe was great and the yorkshire puddings rose perfectly and looked beautifully.  However, they were slightly overcooked and dried out at 35 minutes, but this was most likely because of my convection oven.   Cook for a shorter amount of time if using the convection oven.

Amazing! I've never had success with Yorkies before. Mine are usually stodgy and dull. These were crisp and beautifully risen. I did add salt to enhance the taste. Thanks for teaching an old dog a new trick.

I made this today and came out good. I did add a pinch of salt. Do prepare your batter and let rest for an hour, room temp. Same thing with eggs and milk, room temp. What a difference it makes. My dil lived in England for quite sometime and she loved them. I served with Braised pork chops recipe from here. Double the gravy. Rice and beans, avocado. We had a feast. Ty!

Married to man with scottish parents, who was a missionary in London for two years, we had high hopes for this recipe.  The inside of the puddings were fine.  The outside burned terribly!  I'll be looking elsewhere.  Also, aren't traditional puddings more "cup" shaped?  I was sad this didn't turn out.

These were yorkshire pancakes!!  They didn't rise at all and were way too dense.  I think the proportions are off.  I had misplaced my tried and true recipe so I found this one and used it based on all the good reviews...but I don't know what all the reviewers have experienced in the past for yorkshires....but this recipe is NOT it!!!!

These were delicious! This was the first time I've ever heard of or attempted them, and it surely won't be the last. I made them with Marie's Easy Slow Cooker Pot Roast from this site and they complimented it so well! I didn't add salt, and I still think they served their purpose completely. I used two eggs, 1 cup flour, and 1 cup of milk. I spooned an even teaspoon of bacon grease into 6 muffin cups (made a half batch), and they were perfectly golden crispy on the outside and soft and hollow in the inside in 30 minutes. YUM! I will definitely be making these again!

Took others' advice about adding salt and bringing milk & eggs to room temp, and these came out absolutely beautifully!  So impressive-looking, and so delicious when drowned in beef gravy.  I will make these a staple with roast beef from now on!

Make 1 hour ahead and allow to rest. Oil MUST be hot when pouring in batter. Eggs and milk should be room temp when making. Half recipe is plenty.

This is a great recipe for beginners. They were sky high and I was told these were the best Yorkshires that my family has ever had. I too added salt and the ingredients need to be at room temp, otherwise a great recipe!

These are the WORST yorkshire puddings i've ever tasted. I have made delicious yorkshire pudding faithfully every time I make roast beef or prime rib, and now it's Christmas Day, and the Yorkshire pudding I am renowned for that my family loves is ruined. I couldn't find my old recipe since the site was changed. 

These came out hard and crunchy and it tastes like overcooked refrigerated dough biscuits, and I baked them for only about half the time it called for. I like my yorkshire pudding soft, savory, hollow in the middle with a slight crisp on the outside and spongy enough inside to soak up my roast beef drippings off my plate. If you do also, steer clear of this recipe!

This Yorkshire recipe is almost perfect.  The pudding does rise Sky High and the consistency is perfect, browned on the outside and cooked through.  Just needs some salt...Still giving it five stars though, maybe some people like it salt free!

First time we ever tried yorkshire pudding.
turned out very good, i also made mini ones
because i had left over batter. good with just
butter on them or gravy. I used butter on some in
the muffin tins, and oil in the second batch, 
tasted the same to me.

My Husband is from the UK and it has taken me ages to find the right recipe for Yorkies. I did add salt and it's a must to allow your ingredients to be at room temp. But my Husbands review is a UK born couldn't make them any better. That is more then enough for me. Thank you!!

Completely awesome and lighter-than-air Yorkies!  My British mother-in-law (and the Women's Institute) would be proud to serve these. I let the mixture rest for a while as the pan heats up.  Occasionally, if the mood hits me, I add fresh herbs, cheese, or other seasonings.  Thank you!!!  Add:  Made these for Christmas dinner and they were 6 inches high, hollow in the middle, with a delicate crust and wonderful flavor.  Can't beat this recipe!

Not sure where I went wrong, but these were disastrous for me even though I tried to follow the recipe precisely. They ended up like dense, hard, flat, dark, little hockey pucks. 
After doing some research I learned that the volume of eggs should exactly match the volume of milk, which should also match the volume of flour (i.e., 2 cups each). Therefore, next time I intend to measure the beaten eggs to ensure that the four eggs will equal 2 cups (I doubt it). Also, I've heard that the best milk to use is 2%, not homogenized. Stay tuned.

Very good appearance. Being a Yorkshireman I like them cold with a smear of strawberry jam on them. A tasty bread replacement that doesn't last very long.

I am a Brit living in the US and looked all over for the perfect yorkshire pudding recipe so I could have a taste of home. Unfortunately, this recipe didn't give me that.  Like the others described "bland hockey pucks". I am so very disappointed!  My dinner will now be missing its yorkshires. I won't be trying this one again.

These came out perfect, so easy to make and exactly like the photo. Instead of vegetable oil, I used the drippings from the prime rib I cooked and baked them while the roast restet.

This recipe did not turn out for me. I followed the recipe exactly but I found it needed salt. Another problem is that the oven was too hot at 450 and when i took them out, they took the coating of my Wilton pan with them. They also had a very dense texture

i don't understand how this has such a high rating...while the ingredients are almost correct the portions are way off, if you follow the other user reviews you find this out, the ingredients should be equal parts milk, equal parts egg, equal parts flour, and add a tsp of salt or they are very very bland...also the cooking time should only be 20min or you'll end up with rock cakes...with these changes it is a 5 star recipe...also best to use lard or pan drippings if possible it adds flavor

This looks more like a popover recipe.  Granted popovers and Yorkshire pudding are related.  Yorkshire pudding should use the fat fron the roast beef pan not vegetable oil.  That's where some of the flavor comes from.  Use a heated pie pan to bake in.  Cut in wedges.

Maybe i did something wrong, but these turned out like little hockey pucks for me. The only thing i did differently was i used olive oil because that was all i had. So maybe that made a big difference, but other than that i followed the recipe and a couple reviewers. I used homo milk, added salt, and had the mixture at room temp. It was my first time making yorkshire so i was pretty disappointed. Might try this recipe again later with vegetable oil and see if it makes a difference.

This was delicious! I added a tsp of salt since the original recipe left it out. I cut the recipe in half since it was the two of us eating. My husband kept going back for more. I made this with a prime rib roast that I cooked in the slow cooker. There was plenty of gravy for these Yorkies!  Next time I will make this with butter or meat drippings instead of the oil in the muffin tins. I think that will add some more flavor; but it is definitely good the way it is.

amazing, worked out beautifully -- very light and fluffy -- only change was to add about 1/4 tsp salt.

After making a nice roast beef tonight I found myself as the only diner. Schedule changes, bad weather and the aftermath of a trip to the dentist caused each family member to miss one of their favourite meals. I haven't made these for years and I was never pleased with the result.  Even with tonight's small roast I was left with quite a bit of *drippings* so this seemed like a good opportunity to give it another go. I think I shied away before because of the 35 minute baking time. I didn't want to be eating a roast that had been sitting and cooling off too much. Now with a little more experience I've found that if you have this batter ready to go and the oil hot hot hot in each cup, the 35 minutes is about how long it takes to finish up any sides and make the gravy anyway. These were beautiful. The funny poofy shape with that lovely homemade taste and golden colour had me smiling as I watched them do their thing in the oven. Incredible. I ate 3 and had to tear myself away. It's torture because I can still smell them. Great directions as written. (I did sift the flour and added salt but that's it) Because I had excess drippings over what I needed for gravy, I put a little in each cup and enough oil to make up the tsp required.   Love, love them. Hats off to the chef!

This recipe works great! My British friend gave me some hints and tips though that make it work even better. Make sure the eggs are room temp, mix it all together and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. Make sure to give it a good wisking again before pouring it into piping hot (and I mean like smoking hot) oil. They coume out nice and big! If your making lots and you dont want them to fall flat, then take them out of the muffin tins and place on a cookie sheet in the oven to keep warm...they will start to get crispier on the outside though.

Made these last night for Christmas dinner. They turned out great considering it was my first time making Yorkshire Pudding.  Served with prime rib, mased potatoes and beef gravy.  Family loved them, but I think they needed MORE salt. I added 1/4 tsp, but that wasn't enough.  I'll add more next time!

My mother's mom was a brit so the yorkshire pudding was a must at a roast beef dinner. This recipe was very easy, fast and turned out exactly as it should. The only thing I did differently was I used drippings from the roast pan instead of the vegetable oil. The puddings came out soooo crispy, yet light and hollow. YUMM!! Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried so many recipes for Yorkshire Pudding and all without success.  I've endured many comments over the years from my family about my Yorkie "pucks" ~ until now !!!  This recipes was fantastic and the Yorkie's were so tender and tall, I could not believe it !!  Finally, I can be proud !!

I tried this exactly and turned out very good. My husband likes it with more egg so I added 1 egg to the mix and they turned out even better. This is definately a keeper. Very easy and super tasty. They stay tall even out of the oven. Don't throw away leftovers. Just pop them into the oven to crisp up the next day and they taste just as delicious.

I made these for a Harry Potter-themed event and it was quite a success! My brother particularly loved these. I have taken to making them when I manage a Sunday roast.

To be fair - this was only my second time making Yorkshire pudding but this did not work at all !!!!  Mine looked like deflated muffins!!! Do ahead and laugh at my 'hockey pucks' but I tried people's suggestions and used butter instead of oil and did everything at room temperature, even did the extra whisk before pouring the batter into the hot butter....
AND I couldn't get them out of the stupid pan!!!! (please note that I'm am writing this with a very large glass of red wine in my hand after my two year old refused to go to bed, and seven month old threw up all over me.... perspective is everything)

I am a big fan of Yorkshire Pudding.  It's one of those things that my mother made on special occasions.  I followed the recipe except for replacing the 1/4 cup of oil with 1/4 cup of the meat drippings. That's the way Mom made it.

Don't use a Yorkshire pudding recipe from someone who "Just came up with it" when there are recipes that have generations of success. You need salt in these, are as another reviewer noted, using the fat drippings from the roast beef is far superior to oil. I tried this because I couldn't find Nanna's recipe and was short of time ... They were heavy and not as good as our family recipe. Next time I'll make time to find our recipe!!

These are excellent yorkshire puddings! They don't flop nearly as easily as my other recipes do! They stay nice and puffy. I added 1/3 tsp salt to the mixture.

I have made these twice now and both times I am hoping for more. I think I need to have a runnier batter or perhaps a bit more oil. It is very important to let the oven heat up the oil and quickly distribute it. thanks

I love making and eating these, however they don't have a lot of flavor to them.  I usually save the broth left from a roast or something that way and make the Yorkshire Pudding with it, so yummy!

Tough little hockey pucks.  I was so disappointed.  I served this last night at Christmas Eve dinner and I was embarrassed to bring these to the table.  I followed directions completely, they didn't rise and were tough on the outside.  I will NEVER make these again.

This was my first experience with Yorkshire pudding and it was definitely positive!  Yum, I could have eaten the entire pan.  Next time, I'm going to cut the recipe in half, as 12 rolls was too many for my husband and myself and I didn't like the leftovers.

mine were a disaster!  I followed the recipe to the letter and got hard, dark little hockey pucks.  I have no idea what I did wrong and am wondering if the fact that I live at a high altitude could have made that much of a difference.

I'd never had (let alone made) Yorkshire pudding in my life. I made this for my grandfather from Scotland, he said it was the best he'd had since moving here, and asked where I had bought it. He almost didn't believe that I had made it!

THESE SKY HIGH YORKSHIRE ARE THE BEST EVER... Wow. I've been trying to make YPs for many years, unsuccessfully....in the past they either stick to the pan, NEVER hold their height.....and are just poopy. These were awesome. Tall, fall right out of the pan (no knife needed), no fancy 'chill this, bring this to room temperature,' rules, and to top it all off they hold their height. Amazing. I've made them successfully with both white flour and whole wheat. Nummy nummy.

This is a great recipe but I made a couple of changes.  First, you do not need the entire recipe for 12 yorkshires.  If you half the recipe, you will have enough for the pan.    Using milk and eggs at room temp works well but all you have to do is pop the milk in the microwave for 30 sec to warm it up.  Heat the oil in the oven for 3 min, it does not need to smoke. Devide batter evenly in the cups.  I felt that baking them for 30 min is too long and they were overdone.  I would cut it down by at least 5 min depending on ovens, until they are light brown.  Hope this helps!!

I did what others said & added salt. I put oil in the muffin cups like the recipe stated, milk & eggs were room temp. but all of mine stuck, very badly....no one cared for this, they said it was too chewy. The ones my mom used to make were crispier, more of a hollow center..

Sorry, but this is not Yorkshire pudding. What this recipe makes are called 'popovers', very delicious but slightly different from Yorkshire pudding.

I thought I'd never be aqble to make "proper" yorkshire puddings.  For years, I have attempted them, with many fairly average results an only occassional success.  This recipe can't fail!!  How brilliant!!  This is so easy, and makes a roast meal just so much more special.

These were good, although mine did not end up being sky high.  I think next time I'll use a slightly higher oven temp. and make sure the pan is really smoking when adding the batter.  Can't wait to try these again.  Thanks!

This was my first time making/having Yorkshire Pudding. Everything worked fine as I was making this recipe and it was fairly easy. I was glad I followed another's advice and put another cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil underneath to catch the oil dripping down. I think I probably should have baked them slightly longer than 30 minutes (had trouble figuring out how to know if they were done). I found though they were getting brown on the top and rising pretty well, after I turned off the oven and ate a couple they were still a bit doughy in the middle. There was still some oil in the bottom of the some of the  muffin cups that made a few a little greasy after I took them out to save them for tomorrow. Again, I think baking them even 5 more minutes would have solved this problem. They were still great with Pot Roast, Bousin cheese, and also with strawberry jam. Will try again and believe next time they will turn out to be 5 star (if you are making them for company and never made anything like this before, you might want to do a rehursal first)!

Awesome! My mother gave me her Yorkshire Pudding recipe a year or two ago, and it didn't work for me. I ended up with the Yorkshire pucks. But this recipe was great! I used the Magic Bullet blender to beat the mixture until frothy. ONE PIECE OF ADVICE: Make sure your eggs are at room temperature. I left mine sitting on a spoon rest on the stove for four or five hours. My mother advises that the milk be at room temperature too, even if it means you need to nuke it for a minute or so. I had small muffin tins and used a little too much lard and bacon grease (my mother always, always uses lard!) so the muffin tins overflowed with grease when the puddings started to puff up! It was messy and smelly, and the smoke alarm went off... But I looooooove Yorkshire pudding. Fill 'em with gravy and life is good... Thank you so much, Ronismom. :)

They turned out huge, lovely, and golden brown. I was a little nervous making them, as it was my first yorkie experience and I was cooking for a crowd of Brits! A large "Ohhhh...." permeated the kitchen when I took them out of the oven and was told by many present they were fabulous. Will absolutely use this recipe again.

I grew up on Yorkshire pudding for Christmas.  This is the best recipe I have ever used!!!  They bake up tall and they keep their shape for quite a while.  I kept part of the batch in the oven during dinner and they stayed tall.  I agree with using room temperature eggs and milk like the previous reviewer suggested.  This recipe is a keeper!

Mile high is about right! They turned out great. I did add a bit of salt, also I slightly warmed my milk in the microwave before using. I would say just a bit below room temperature I didn’t want to get it warm.

No brainer. Easy to make.  Amazing!! My family can't have enough of them! I made them in the afternoon and let them stay at the fridge until putting them in the oven. I also added 1 tbs of salt. I got 16 puddings.

AHHH-MAZING!!!!! We absolutely LOVED these!!! Just like I remember my grandmothers being like! I doubled the recipe and it worked fabulously. The pan of them using my Pampered Chef stoneware was even better than my regular muffin pan - they puffed up and got even bigger!! Can't wait to have these for supper tonight with our roast beef & mashed potatoes! A little butter and sugar and we're set!

Just made these today. I halved the recipe because I only had a cup of milk and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil because that was all I had on hand. The bottom of my puddings were a little on the burnt side. Lesson learned. The puddings were overall very good and I would use this recipe again.

Great recipe. I was taught never to use salt as some others have said and I use 1 tsp bacon fat in each cup instead of oil.  The old 1:1:1 recipe standby creates a denser doughier puff. This recipe makes a slightly crispy-on-the-outside, hollow centred, fluffed up, lighter-weight puff. I have tried many many recipes looking for the perfect sky-high fluffy puff, and this is near perfect. I use 2 x 7/8 of a cup of flour, instead of 2 cups even. It makes it lighter and puffier. I also let the ingredients come to room temperature before whipping up the batter in my blender.

Made this to serve with sirloin steak.  I fried a few slices of bacon in my cast iron skillet so that I could use the drippings instead of the oil. Made a half recipe ....worked beautifully! My husband's new favorite!

After 39 years of trial and error, looking for the perfect Yorkshire recipe....FINALLY I have found it!  This is absoulutely PERFECTION.  I wondered about the absence of salt...but they simply don't need it.  They all looked uniform with a central cavity just waiting for rich gravey. I let the oil heat for 12 minutes and quickly poured in the batter, slammed them in the oven and watched them develop into a work of art.  Thank you so much, Ronismom!!!

I'm not sure if it was the lack of flavor or the egg taste, but I wasn't a fan of these.  I can't fairly say if it was the recipe or the item itself.

I had to add 1 tsp of salt to the Yorkshire batter, it was very tasteless.   They turned out very well.  I have to admit~~they were not sky high..LOL..but they did rise very nicely.  I would make this recipe again.  :O)

This is a great recipe, that really does produce mile high yorkies! I blend everything up in the blender and add a bit of chopped fresh herbs (rosemary or thyme), a pinch of salt and pepper. The use of the blender allows for a quick pour to maintain the heat of the oil. Mmmmm

I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I was dissapointed in how they turned out.  As I remember they are to be hollow.  These were dense, too well done and boring.  When my mom makes hers there is never any left over.  I had left overs.  Enough said.

I made half in muffin tins and refrigerated the left dough for the next day which I then made in a glass pyrex container. I have to say, the iol never smoked for me. I left it 15 extra minutes in the oven and it NEVER smoked! I put the dough in anyway after that. They were hard on the outside and soft on the inside. My son LOVED them! They never colapsed so taht's good. He had them day after day reheated in microwave wich some whipped cream on top and a drizzle of syrup for dessert! The only reason they are four stars is that the recipe lacks in salt. Without the salt they are not nearly as good. I found in the pyrex pan they were much easier to make and less mess. I will make them this way from now on.

This is definitely the best yorkshire I have ever made.  I did follow the advise of others and added salt and let the ingredients warm to room temperature before making it.  I just used my blender, and whipped it every 1/2 hour or so until I cooked them

This was a great recipe. I was so proud of my finished product! I made sure to have the milk & eggs @ room temp & also added salt (as other users suggested) end result was awesome. I halved the recipe and it easily made 6 in a large muffin tin. I may have taken them out a few minutes too early as they seemed a little eggie.

OMG!  These are fabulous!  Very easy too!  I did add a little salt and used bacon grease instead of vegtable oil.  Had a little bit a hard time getting them out, but managed.  They were getting so dark that I reduced the temp to 400 degrees last 10 minutes.  I also used a tooth pick to poke a hole in each one to avoid deflating.  Brought to a friends home for dinner and reheated in a microwave just til warm.  They survived and everyone loved them.  Will make again, and again.  Almost forgot, make sure to place a cookie sheet or foil under muffin tin if you don't want to clean the oven afterward.  They leak oil all over!

I followed someone's suggestion about using equal measurements of egg/flour/milk. Used 4 eggs, one cup of flour and one cup of milk. It was really easy, and really good. Hubby loved it.

I cut the recipe in half but still got 12 regular sized muffins from the batter.  I was only expecting to make 6.  You definately have to heat the oil up until smoking first.  I did this for only 6 and then when I realized that I had too much batter,  added the oil  to the other half of the muffin tin at the last minute.  The six with pre-heated oil were twice as high as the others.  An okay recipe but even the ones done exactly as stated in the recipe were a bit on the heavy side and not as light and high as expected.  The non-pre-heated oil ones were like greasy muffins which the dog enjoyed.  I will try another yorkshire recipe from this site next time.  I don't think this was the ultimate.

They looked beautiful but tasted bland.  My 9 year old daughter filled hers with shredded mozarella and loved it.  My 13 year old daughter took one bite and didn't like it.  Dh thought it was ok with roast beef gravy.  I thought it tasted like bland french toast so i ate mine with a little powdered sugar.  Easy to make.  I followed the directions exactly.  I probably wouldn't make them again.

This recipe needs salt.  Somehow I forgot to add any even *after* reading plenty of reviews that suggested it.  On a brighter note... it make lovely high-rising Yorkshires!  I used beef drippings from a rib roast rather than vegetable oil, but I'm encouraged to make these much more often with veg oil, or other drippings.  Like other reviewers, I halved this recipe and was still able to make around 10 "servings" in a regular size muffin tin.  I out "servings" in quotes because DBF and I each ate 3!

good recipe - crisp on the outside and tender inside.   I ran out of white flour and used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white - you couldn't tell the difference (at least adds a bit more nutritional value to this indulgence - plus I used the dripping from the roast for the oil!)  For our taste, I did not add salt (as suggested by some) as there was enough seasoning in the gravy.

Added salt (who cooks anything without salt?) but that was the only change I made. They definitely rose like no yorkshire pudding recipe I've ever used, though I only cooked them for 22 minutes in our convection oven to get them dark golden brown and crispy on the outside.

It had a great deal of potential, though I added too much salt. I allowed the milk, egg and flour mixture to equilibrate to room temperature (for approximately 1 hour) as suggested in previous reviews, and due to my cooking ignorance, added 1 teaspoon of salt which was much too much! In retrospect perhaps I should have realized this, as I only prepared enough batter for 6 servings. In the future, I will use 1/2 teaspoon of salt or less. In addition, the overall cooking time was approximately 25 minutes. Also, I used whole wheat flour and olive oil in lieu of all purpose flour and vegetable oil.

These really did rise pretty high in the oven, but they collapsed pretty quickly too!  They did taste great though and they were really easy to make.  Mine were done after only 20 minutes... lucky I was keeping an eye on them, otherwise I think they would have turned to charcoal by 30 mins!

First of all, the puddings completely stuck to the muffin pan - I literally had to pry them out with a spoon. Also, the taste was mediocre at best - recommend using butter instead of vege oil.

Loved this recipe.  I have to confess though, I added a tsp of salt to my flour before adding my milk and eggs...and they were fan-fricken-tastic! Thanks for a genius yorkie recipe!

Husband likes yorkshire pudding as he's of mostly English descent.  I've never cared for it until he found and made this recipe.  He put it in muffin tins and it was so beautiful I just HAD to try it!  He made them to serve with my yummy Sunday roast (with gravy), and it was the perfect accompaniment.  We'll probably make these with the roast more often, and probably instead of mashed potatoes!

I have made Yorkshire pudding for years.  Never have they turned out as tasty and puffy as these.  I used a little under a teaspoon of oil per muffin tin. Next time I will try a little less.

These are amazing. It is the first time I've make Yorkshires. I did add a bit of salt and made sure the milk and eggs were at room temperature...I also put the pan in the oven to heat the oil before adding the batter. The were so high and had a great hollow in the middle!

Turned out perfectly on the first try-- not one adjustment needed! Everything this recipe said it should be, it was-- light, fluffy, sky high and hollow in the center to hold gravy.  I did follow the advice to let milk and eggs come to room temperature, and it must have helped-- my whole family was delighted w/ this recipe!  Absolutely a keeper-- thanks for posting!!

This worked out quite well.  The only thing I would say is that there is more than 1/4 cup of batter for each pudding.  Delicious!

This is not Yorkshire pudding! My mother has made these for years, unfortunately I never got the recipe and she has passed. I have made them in the past and ate them every roast beef dinner at Moms and hers were high and light and fluffy, these went no where, look like hockey pucks. Im very disappointed I wasted the ingredients. I did everything as stated in recipe and they did not rise!

This was good, but not great. Mine did not puff up as I expected. I may make this again but I will also keep looking to see if I can find a better yorkshire pudding recipe.

Okay, I have been making Yorkshires for years so I think I know what to do and I like to try new recipes once in a while. They did rise up beautifully, but that was the end for me. Too eggy, too dense. I've had better.

These were really tall......perfect with our prime rib.  These were fast and easy and this recipe made a ton.  I had 10 people for dinner and we only ate half of them.  Next time I will half the recipe - they would be perfect with a soppy beef stew poured into and around them.

I didn't really like these. It is definitely an aquired taste. I didn't think it went well with my roast. I did follow the instructions, and added beef drippings to one batch, and oil to another. The drippings batch was bland, the oil was so greasy. Both tasted just too eggy. I was hoping some beef flavor would carry through, but it didn't. I won't make again. Worth trying. Thanks anyway.

These were great and so simple.  I just mixed everything with a blender.  Worked terrific.  I got 20 individual servings (using a regular sized muffin tin) with the recipe.  Rose up nice and high.  I only baked them 25 minutes and they were wonderful golden brown.  I did add about a 1/2 - 1 tsp. of salt.  Next time I might cook in the beef drippings to try that.  I've made yorkshire pudding in a 9x13 before and it was terrible.  Love this, it's my new way to do yorkshire pudding easily.  Thanks for the recipe!!

YUMMY!!! I made exactly as directed  but added a little salt for flavor and they came out perfect- and supper easy to make. I read other reviews but forgot to let milk & eggs get to room temp but it turned out fine- it really rose very high- They turned golden brown and were just perfect! Made them at a dinner party and everybody loved them- very good with a little gravy. Next time I'll try with some beef drippings for more flavor.

Really good. Amazingly easy. I only gave it four stars because it needs some serious salt. However, these turned out really tall. I liked the texture. I also used 1/3 c. of egg substitute in place of each egg. I wasn't sure how that would work out but, it turned out fine. Thanks for a great recipe. We will definitely use this often.

my husband loves and insists on these every time... he eats 6 in one meal!!  the first time I skipped the "smoking oil" part and was scraping them out of the pan.  but when I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS :) they came out clean and easy.  if you're using gravy, like we always do, these don't need any salt at all.  perfect recipe!

With allrecipes.com I find I'm not calling my mother as often as I used to. That's a shame. But these Yorkshire Puds were spot on. Nearly like mum used to make. I monkeyed with the ingredients ONLY by adding some cream of tartar [it's a powdered leavening agent] because I wasn't trusting that they'd puff up if I didn't add either that or baking powder. Next time I'll try a small batch without the C of T and they'll probably be just as fab.

I used this recipe with the Easy Pot Roast from this site and it was a fabulous pairing. I didn't have the regular sized muffin tins, mine were a bit shallow and I think that was a mistake. The rolls were a bit small and condensed. I served it to my husband's grandmother, who is from Canada, and she says they have this recipe all the time in Canada and that it is usually made larger. So I think even the large muffin tins would work. Either way, this was great and I will make it again.

I don't know if this recipe is off or my oven is hotter than the temperature dial says it is.  Either way, 25 minutes at 450 and my puddings were charred to a black crisp.  I definitly recommend keeping a close eye on them as they cook.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe for Yorkshire pudding. The individual puddings are light and airy and do rise "sky high". I heated the pan for about 4-5 minutes but couldn't wait any longer for it to smoke. Nonetheless, the puddings rose wonderfully and were delicious. I will absolutely be adding this recipe to my collection.

I thought these were wonderful, however it is critical to get the oil hot enough or they won't rise or have the texture they should... FYI.

Although my puds rose nicely and were crispy outside, they just were not airy enough inside. They were more of a bread texture inside. After reading the other reviews I wonder if letting the batter come to room temp. would solve this. I'll try this one again.

My husband is a VERY picky eater, and he loves these yorkies!
I know it is great recipe, because he says they are as good as his moms and better than most at "home". Seeing as he is from Gillingham (in Kent England), and his mom was and owner/cook of a restaurant there - I'd say this recipe is a keeper! Plus it's easy, and hard to mess up!
THANK YOU!

Very good! They rose very high and didn't deflate. I would check them after 25 mn though. After 30 min, they were slightly too brown. Thank you!

Great recipe! They were light and fluffy, golden brown. rose beautifully and even kept their shape out of the oven.  Can't wait to try them in roast beef drippings instead of oil.  Special thanks to the previous reviews about using eggs and milk at room temperature.  I think this made a big difference.

I was looking for a yorkshire pudding recipe that didn't require beef drippings, and this fit the bill.  But, unfortunately, this recipe is missing something...I suspect it's beef drippings.  Kind of a Catch-22.  So while these aren't quite as good as a traditional Yorkshire Pudding, it is pretty good for when you're not making a roast.  With some yummy gravy to dip in, I bet these would be just perfect.  Thanks!

These were quite simple, and rose about 2-3" out of the muffin cups.  Don't heat the drippings for 5-10 minutes; it takes only about 2-4.  I subbed beef drippings for the oil.  I made these to let my family taste them after I spent the past semester in London with Sunday pot roasts.  They tasted ok, but are nothing special.  I might just not be taken with Yorkshire Pudding.  You will have success with this recipe though.

Delicious - better than the store-bought box that costs almost $5. Made as directed but did add 3/4 tsp. salt as others suggested. I let the milk and eggs come to room temp and after I added the flour let it sit for almost an hour. Baked them for 29 minutes as I was concerned they were getting a little too brown but should have gone with a few more minutes. No more store- bought for me!!!

EASY and PERFECT!  
I have been looking to make a Yorkie Pud recipe for EVER... this one did not disappoint, I am gluten intollerant, so use refined white SPELT flour for my baking.  Generally this requires any recipe I try be adjusted either with adding more sifted flour or decreasing the liquid portions.  I made this as directed with the following changes, sifted my spelt flour, I do for all my baking, added salt as recommended by the other bakers and since I could not add whole milk as recommended by others, I used 1 1/2 cups 2% and 1/2 cup whipping cream...  Everything else was the same, thou my pan smoked after six minutes and my Yorkies were done in 22 minutes!  Thanks for the awesome "pud" recipe, our Sunday night dinner is once again AWESOME,  now pass the gravy!

I kept eggs and milk at room temp- and added salt with flour. They were very good- but they got very brown- I think it is better to turn down oven halfway through baking like some other recipes do.

These were super easy to make but so impressive to serve.  The only reason I didn’t give it a perfect score was that the entire family thought it needed just a little salt to add some flavor.

Thanks so much for this recipe.  Tried them on Christmas to accompany Prime Rib.  My entire family raved and I must say, so did I.  Did not make any changes and they came out perfect!  Wish I’d thought to take a photo as they were not only delicious but gorgeous to look at as well.

The bake took 30mins and the rise was good. My only addition was a little salt. Next time I would use less oil though. I had to paper towel them to remove some of the oil after.

They were good, but bland. Next time I'm using butter instead of oil & adding a pinch of salt.

This is a great base. I did change the instructiobs slightly. I puf 1 teaspoon of veg oil AND a 1/2 tsp butter in the oans prior to heating. Also, I added 1 tsp salt. but I baked at 450 for 20 min. then reduced heat to 325 for 20 minutes. Came out perfect! Buttery!

5 stars!! This recipe makes phenomenal Yorkshire puddings! Everyone is right about using room temperature ingredients and letting the batter rest for 20 minutes, it definitely makes for a better Yorkie. And add a tsp of salt, they'll be bland without it. This also makes a great base for Toad in the Whole (picture included), soo good!!

These tips really helped to make the best Yorkshire yet!  I made everything well in advance so the batter was warm. I smoked the oil before adding the batter and added a pinch of salt. They were a thing of beauty, high, brown and wonderful texture. Only thing is recipe made twice what I needed for 12 muffins. What size muffins was this made for?  LOL

My son helped me make these for Christmas dinner with a rib eye roast. The only change I made was using the drippings from the roast instead of oil. Very easy and they turned out huge and didn't deflate at all. My mom thanked me for bringing back fond memories of her mom making it. :)

So simple and delicious. However keep in mind if you live in higher altitudes such as Colorado, use less oil. It takes less time for oil and/or water to boil up here. Therefore you need less or this recipe comes out flat and firm. But we only used at most, a table spoon of oil and traditionally prefer meat juices. Otherwise light and fluffy was our result!

This recipe was great.  My husband lived in England for awhile and loves a good Yorkshire Pudding.  I added a little salt (1/2 tsp) and mixed it in the blender.  I left it out at room temperature for a couple of hours and mixed it one last time just before cooking.  I used lard (1 tsp per muffin tin) and heated it in a 500 degree oven  for 5-7 minutes--then I poured the batter in (filled 1/2 of the cup) and it only took about 12 minutes till it was done.  They came out puffy and fabulous with a nice hole in the center for our gravy.  Thanks for the recipe.

Followed as written. Next time I would add 3/4t salt and possibly reduce oven temp. to 425 degrees as the tops were perfectly browned but the bottoms were a little too brown for me.  Used room temp. eggs and milk. Also, place a foil-lined baking sheet under the muffin tins. This oozed oil into my oven and burnt on. This recipe made 18 Yorkies for me using the 1/4 cup batter measure.

I added a bit of salt and put a baking pan under the muffin tin based on the recommendation of others.  Both were a good call.  I removed the puddings after 30 minutes and they were a bit over-browned.  I'll start checking after 20 minutes next time.  

The recipe was easy to follow / execute and I plan on making this again.

Added 2 teaspoons of baking powder to make them rise, but the temperature was way too high. Burnt even though we cooked them less than the suggested time.

Unfortunately I followed the directions on here for 450 degrees for 30-35 minutes. At about 20 minutes they were burnt to a crisp. Next time I will cook them for perhaps 10-12 minutes at such a high temperature as 450.

Made a half recipe and it turned out awesome! I did allow the batter to get to room temperature before I cooked it. I don’t know if that helps the end result, but I had read somewhere it did. Can’t wait to try it again to see if I just got lucky or the stars aligned.

The secret to great Yorkshire pudding is to have the milk and eggs at room temperature and then to pour into extremely hot oil! (Im a certified Limey!)

I followed the recipe but mine stuck to the pan. I'm thinking maybe there wasn't enough fat in the meat drippings i used. Could that be it? They tasted ok, but I never made it  or tasted them before. I live in pa Dutch country and Yorkshire pudding is not big here!

Absolutely how my ma and mammies tasted!  One thing to specify is that all ingredients need to be at room temperature so don’t be scared to leave them on the counter all day with plastic wrap over the milk and flour!  Oh and the muffin tin and oil needs to be screaming hot so just when you think it’s going to catch fire, wait another minute, lol.

I never knew popovers/yorkies could be so easy to make!  These turned out very good!  Easy, simple ingredients, quick to put together.  My muffin pans are extra large (six wells to a pan) which I think helped to support the yorkies as they rose.

Like people have said - it must have salt and pepper added.  Also, watch the 1/4 cup, that is important.  The recipe said 12 servings so I poured it all into 12 regular muffin cups, it was more like 1/2 cup in each when done - they were too thick and cakey, tasty but too think for true yorkshires - 1/4 cup is important.  You will likely get 24 ones this way also!  My kids loved them!

Loved it! These turned out beautifully, nice and tall with lovely golden crust. Very tasty. My hubby had four in one sitting! I did add a pinch of salt and put the tray on a cookie sheet as others suggested to catch the little bit of spillover oil. Will definitely make again!

Don't get me wrong, I love LOVE this recipe, only two things are missing. If you have any fat drippings, bacon grease from this morning, drippings off that beef, if not that then butter.  And 2 pinches salt. Then perfecto

The first time I made these, I followed the recipe except the cook time was cut down by 5 minutes.  They were perfect!

The second time, I doubled the recipe.  They did not rise but tasted good.  If you want to make more, I suggest making single batches multiple times.

These turned out great! I added salt, made sure the ingredients got to room temperature and only cooked them for 25 minutes. They were delicious and probably could have been cooked for even less time.

I made it with gluten feee flour and they were great. Put my pan drippings in the bottom of each cup with a little beef broth added. Turned out fantastic. Don't stir the drippings into the batter, just pour the batter on top of the drippings.

First time making these and I think we've fallen in love! My hubby is not big on 'bread'  at mealtime but he grabbed two extras!  Our roast beef dinner was so much fun eating this way! Funny , I'm half English but never knew about these. I s'pose had I been raised in jolly old England I'd probably been raised on em!  The changes I made after reading reviews was: adding a teaspoon salt, could have used more. Made sure milk and eggs were room temp,  let the batter sit 20 minutes before putting in the pan and, put a cookie sheet under the muffin tin. Also, since they bake at 450°, mine were done at 22 minutes.
I'll say skyhigh they were! Will make these many times to come! Thanks for such a great recipe!

I actually made a hybrid of this recipe and Gordon Ramsay's and it turned out fantastic. I added a 1/4 Tsp Salt, and instead of using 2 Cups flour I used 1 1/2 Cups. Cooked at 450 degrees for 20-50 minutes. 

I personally prefer to use roast drippings in the pan but if you prefer a pudding that has more of a pronounced "cup" in the middle then stick with the veggie oil.

Just remember, when making Yorkies if you really want a rise, let the batter sit for an hour or so and cook from room temperature. Cooking a cold batter will leave them more deflated

I will definitely make these again.

I think that these turned out ok, but didn't know what yorkshire pudding should taste like.  I didn't know how thick the batter should be and had a lot left after filling 12 muffin tins.  I thought they were bland and uninteresting.  I won't make them again.

Tried a test trial Christmas Eve and again Christmas Day. Family loved them and so very easy. Took the advice of a reviewer incorporating a pinch of salt and duck fat. Perfect. By the way the family said they caught my mistake the second day and missed the pinch of salt. The puddings have now been used at breakfast with butter and maple syrup, accompanying a pepper crusted tenderloin and for dessert with ice cream and hot fudge. Thank you!!

I made this for the first time on Christmas day. A little bit of a gamble but I need not have worried at all. I followed the recipe exactly and had perfect results. The puddings were wonderful. The puffed up high, had good flavor and everyone loved them, and were impressed.. this is a keeper!

This ended up as one of the dinner favorites.  Beef Au Jus in the wet mix is a slam dunk.  Replace 1/2 cup of beef Au Jus instead of milk.

Great recipe, Mom made these for years. We add the beef drippings as substitute for veg oil. Also, Maggi, a flavorful seasoning, is a perfect compliment. No need to add salt if adding Maggi. Our family loves them!!

With the exception of the  oil (*) and the lack of salt which is an absolute must,  the other ingredients & ratios are identical to the recipe I have been making for the past 50 years.  My Mother made it the same as did her Mother.   It rarely fails me.

(*) my grandmother would be horrified at the thought of veg oil.  On the days I may not be cooking a roast and do not have any beef drippings, I use beef suet (always have some in the freezer) ; or, in a pinch, I've had good success with chicken fat.  Always have that on hand also.

This recipe is amazing!! Have never been able to make good Yorkshire puddings, this recipe however worked a treat! I agree just a pinch of salt, but apart from that, there's no lie, they were huge!!!

I tried this twice to make sure but this was a big NO for me first these must be over beaten because they could not rise even when smoking oil sizzled after batter was poured and oven was 400. Then I  tried again using a CAST IRON SKILLET NOPE with sizzling bacon oil all I got was a tasty egg pancake at least it was edible then!

I didn't make any changes and they were wonderful!  I will definitely make these again, but I think I will substitute the vegetable oil with butter  next time. I followed someone's suggestion of making and leaving the batter on the counter for an hour prior to baking - good call!!! My husband said they were the best yorkies he has ever had!

These were super yummy with my roast beef gravy. I put a cookie sheet under the muffin tin as suggested to prevent spilling in the oven and added a pinch of salt! Definitely a do-again!

I followed the recipe and it came out great. Instead of milk, I used organic half and half! The only problem was it was very very bland. Needs salt.

The Yorkshire pudding that I usually make is just batter poured into a baking dish.  The idea of baking in muffin tins is great!  The only change I made is to add a little salt to the batter and to use a half tsp or so of bacon fat in each cup rather than vegetable oil.  Adds SO much flavor!  VERY good with the addition of a little salt. Will be making it this way from now on.

I agree all ingredients should be equal, add a little salt and beat until frothy but let batter sit at room temp for an hour or so before using.  You will get HUGE yorkshires especially with a convection setting

They turned out so well!  I followed the recipe exactly up until it said to cook for 30-35 minutes.  Mine were well done at 27 minutes (25 minutes would likely have been better).  They actually were sky high and this was my very first attempt ever at Yorkshire Pudding.

Super easy to do! I added just a pinch of salt, but would recommend a bit more than that. Also, highly recommend removing them from the tin as soon as you can because mine started soaking up the extra oil which wasn't pleasant. My gas oven burned them a bit and I cooked for 35 min, so I'd say go for 30-32 minutes.

I did give it 3 stars but........they came out more like cupcakes.......i'm sure I did something wrong, I will try again. Next time will heat the oil a little longer, to see if that was the problem. The first 2 or 3 cups i added the batter too the oil sizzled so I thought it was quite hot enough, that's the only thing I think I did wrong. Feedback is ok too.

I only gave this recipe a 3 star, because I had to play around with it a bit. With the recipe as is, my girlies didn't rise at all. They were more like sense muffins. I adjusted it by adding 2 eggs, and they turned out perfect! It sounds like a lot of eggs, but they were light and fluffy and a big hit!

This recipe was ok. I don't think I will make it again though. We found the Yorkshire to be heavy and stodgy. I followed the recipe except for adding 1/4 tsp salt. Read other reviews which suggested that.

Excellent easy recipe. i never made Yorkshire Pudding before just popovers!  I made jumbos and regular size.  Added cheese and garlic to the regular size and they were very tasty! Thanks for the recipe! Used some hints from other reviews that really helped.

This is the best easiest recipe. I have eaten Yorkies with roast since I was a child. This is how my mother made it. I agree that a pinch of salt is an improvement.

Turned out beautifully but two things: It needs salt and how in world do your puffs not get burned to a crisp at 450 for 35 minutes?  I took mine out at 15 and they were perfect. If the recipe adjusted these two things I'd give it 5 stars.

Really love this recipe.  I add a pinch of salt.  I like to chill the batter before  adding it to the hot oil.  Some say to let it be room temp.  I've done it that way too... Can't be sure that the results are any different.   In any case, these are so tasty!

Key point: Let the oil heat up before adding the mixture - you can use the pan oil from the roast for extra flavor and avoid adding additional salt if you had salt on the roast.  Let the egg & flour mix sit at room temperature.

I followed the recipe, plus the addition of 1 tsp salt, and left the batter to rest at room temperature for two hours before baking.  I've never had yorkshires rise like this before.  The family loved them.

This recipe is really good when you add approximately 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of  salt to the batter. I found that its best to let  the batter sit for about an hour or so until it comes to room temperature. You also need to make sure your preheat your yorkshire tin/ muffin tin along with your oven so its really hot when you ladle the batter in or else the puddings don't rise very well.

Amazing and always sky high! I thin that the trick is to let it sit until it comes to room temperature. I once made this recipe in a rush and the batter was a bit cool when I added it to the muffin tins, and they didn't rise nearly as much.

If I am making this alongside a roasted meat, I'll use those fat drippings to get a better flavor. I do, however, make these without roasting meat, though instead of vegetable oil I use bacon grease for an nice hint of bacon flavor. Amazing!

Followed this recipe, only added some salt as per others suggestions. They were amazing! Very tall and light, crispy on outside but tender on the inside. Recipe makes WAY more than 12 however. As I added two eggs and a cup each of milk and flour to make more and ended up with nearly 4 dozen!

These turn out perfectly every time. Although, make sure to leave your milk & eggs on the counter for an hour or two until they reach room temperature.

I am still learning to cook as I have had food prepared for me most of the time in the past. This is the second time I have tried to make Yorkshires the 1st time was a complete failure. This recipe is so easy, (I actually halved the quantities), They rose incredibly well and tasted great. Easy Peasy.

I have been making Yorkies for years and this one was awful. It didn't rise more than two inches. It could have been something I did wrong as others seem happy with this recipe. I will use my very old recipe book "The Good Housekeeping Cook Book" From the war years,first published in 1942, before my time. I will submit this recipe soon I don't want to rate this recipe as I could be at fault.
And thank you all for so many wonderful recipes.

It's hard to fail with this recipe. It happened to me only once when I used egg whites instead of whole eggs. I don't recommend it :o) 
I do recommend a sprinkle of salt or salt substitute. I use NoSalt and they're perfect.

After reading the reviews, I took tips from the UK tipsters and measured/added 2 cups of eggs vs just 4 eggs per recipe and I also added salt.  These turned out perfect and as the recipe title says, they were sky-high and delicious.  I also didn't wait for the oil to smoke, I just added the batter after the oil heated in oven for about 7 minutes.  Oh, and I used oil vs beef drippings.  Other tipsters stated to use Homogonized milk but I just used 1% milk that I usually have in refrigerator - and they turned out perfect.

Makes perfect Yorkshire every time! Great recipe!
I like to warm my milk in the microwave just a tad first (30-40 seconds) and let the eggs sit in a bowl of hot water while I get the ingredients together. I find yorkshires always rise better with room temp imgredients.

It's not like there's an issue with this recipe, but, I've tried making this recipe twice now, exactly as written, but these don't fluff up at all for me.

This turned out really good. I didn't get my oil as hot as I could have so they didn't turn out as high as they could have but they were still high and really good. The next morning I tossed the leftover back in the oven for a couple of minutes and served them hot with some cheesy eggs. Yum!

I am hispanic and my husband is Scottish. Ididn't even know what Yorkshire pudding was much less how to make it.  We have tried several recipes and always came up short. I have to say he loved these and wants me to make them more often.

Delicious and the recipe worked perfectly!!!!  I made these to go with beef stew. I had to clean my oven afterwards :-/ Use foil on bottom oven rack for easy cleanup. Beware, the oil will splatter EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!

I made this for the first time and was absolutely thrilled that they turned out just like the photos on site. I did add some salt as suggested by other comments and let it sit at room temp as I had heard that was part of the secret as well as confirmed by others in their comments.  Definitely a keeper.

Good recipe, but I cooked for 30 minutes & they were overdone, so I'll reduce the cooking time next time around.  I added a pinch of salt as others suggested and just used the drippings from the rib roast I made for the fat.  My husband is English and said they were very good though and I will certainly continue using this recipe!

WOW!  For many years we have been making yorkshire pudding at Christmas, and it always ends up flat and greasy.  This recipie was completely different and turned out great even though I added the oil to the batter instead of the cupcake pan!  Once I realized that I did it wrong, I just put a little of the drippings in the cupcake pan and used the batter with the vegetable oil.  They were awesome and very tall, probably a little crunchier than in the picture, but really good!  I also added a little salt, and followed the other suggestions about milk and eggs at room temp and letting the batter sit for an hour before cooking it.  YUM!

Easy to make.  The hardest part was keeping them from flopping - i.e. leave them in the oven at a low heat until ready to serve.

So easy, yet so impressive!  Rose beautifully...4 stars only because the original recipe lacks salt and the yield is off.  I made a half recipe, added a scant half teaspoon of salt and it made 12 muffin sized Yorkies.  I also used beef drippings instead of vegetable oil.  Mine were ready at the shorter baking time.

I have made this recipe so many times. I agree it needs a little bit of salt, but the puddings always come out perfectly and beautifully puffed! I love this recipe and use it every time I make roast beast! Thanks!!

1/4 cup in each section of muffin tin doesn't seem like enough batter (12servings x 1/4 cup = 3cups) Recipe makes 5 cups of batter.I did not have luck with following these directions and they came out flat & bland.

This was fun, I served it to girls at a Harry Potter themed party.  If I make them again, I think a little salt would really help.

Absolutely fantastic!  I used to buy the packaged mix but, as my boys have gotten older (and their appetites bigger!), I decided to try making from scratch.  I've tried a few other recipes that turned out "okay" but this one is FABULOUS and got rave reviews from everybody at a family dinner.  Definitely recommend, came out perfectly.      Followed recipe/directions exactly, no changes or substitutions.    Thank you to the Submitter!

Never knew making yorkshire pudding from scratch was so easy. Was addicted to the instant packets for years, never going back. Mine came out a little over done so the second batch only went in for 25 minutes and came out perfect!

Yum yum yum! Made these for dinner tonight and the hubby said "your yorkshire pudding is so much better than the restaurant ones!" I am almost embarrassed to say we ate all of them between the two of us!  I didn't have time to let the ingredients warm to room temperature so I just beat the eggs and then warmed the milk in the microwave for 20 seconds until a little more than lukewarm. I did throw in a 1/4 tsp of salt for a half a batch. Again, so yummy!

This recipe is awesome.  have learnt by trial and error as i am no yorkie expert, have made this 3 times now.  my only advise is whisk these as much as possible, i find a hand held whisk is easiest and i also get my guests involved with that task.  Also, listen to the recipe and dont put in too much oil as i had a mini fire in my oven after the yorkies were done and i went to warm up my home made apple pie - good thing i had the ice cream as a back up.

These were a definte hit!  Yorkshire has always been sort of hit or miss for me, and usually a miss.  I followed the directions to a tee, but added 1 teaspoon of salt to the batter. They rose unbelievably high,were light in texture,and slightly crisp on the outside. Perfect.  Thanks for the recipe, Ronismom.

This is probably the best yorkshire pudding I've ever had! I made the recipe exactly as is. It was easy! They puffed right up, and were light and crispy, not to mention delicious. The lack of salt is not a problem, especially if you're spooning beef gravy/sauce over them, as gravy tends to be salty anyway. The next day, I just popped them into the toaster oven and they puffed and crisped right up again after 5-6 minutes. I dunked them in gravy for lunch! :) Yummy!!! Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe.

Mine didn't rise very much and there were not light , I think I didn't mix the batter long enough?  The flavor was wonderful though and I will try to make these again.

I made these two more times and they turned out excellent!!  I let my milk and egss come to room temperature and I used a little less flour (not sure how much).

I made this all in one pan (I'm a big fan of the middle piece), and thought it was great. The eggs made the pud plenty flavorful without any added salt (but then, I don't generally salt my food). I will definitely use less oil next time, though.

Very easy recipe that turned out really good.  I also added a bit of salt.  We had them with pot roast with lots of gravy - yum !

There are great. I did like some of the other reviews mention and added some salt to the egg and milk mixture. I have always used the Clubhouse mixes, but these were great. And really impressive looking. I placed my batter in a pyrex picture for easier transfer from mixing bowl to hot oil. This saved me time and mess. Thanks for this great recipe!

These are FANTASTIC! I have never had Yorkshire Pudding from scratch turn out, they are always more like Yorkshire Hockeypucks. These were awesome! I didn't give it full stars because I did add salt to the batter, which the recipe does not call for but really needs. Other than that little adjustment, they were great.

Thanks for this recipe!  We've made these a few times and everyone in the family loves them.  At my elevation, it helps to add an extra egg  - we're about 5,000 feet.   I found a great cast iron pan for the purpose....  but we still get the smoke alarms going...

Like other users suggested, I added salt (though I`ll add more then I did next time). I found that the recipe made more then 12 servings, as I`m used to having my yorkies being smaller, and only filling half of the muffin tin. They turned out really cakey, but still doughy, and they did look fabulous. I just found them too dense for my personal liking. Next time, I`ll just cut the recipe in half! Good recipe though! :D

The first batch was just OK.  I don't think my oil was hot enough, they were a little soggy.  The second batch came out better.  I too added a little salt and prepared the batter ahead of time.

I've only made this once ... it mixed up like a charm, cooked up perfectly, but I should have added some salt as was suggested in some of the other recipes. They tasted a little bland.

My husband is a Yorkshire man and he knew what I was cooking for dinner last night as soon as he walked in the door.The aroma was wonderful. A lovely surprise for him.  These were perfect, I added a pinch of salt for flavour, but no other additions. Thank You. It's a keeper!  Moyra, Brisbane, Australia.

My Mom made the best Yorkshire Pudding but others she shared the recipe with would say that it did not rise.  We determined that the batter needs to be poured into hot oil or drippings.  We keep the pan in the oven while mixing the batter and it rises every time creating all those pockets for the gravy.  yummy!

I tried a couple different recipes and this one was the easiest and rose the highest. I made this a few times now and my family loves it. I did add one teaspoon of salt because the origianl recepe made a little blend puddings. I wonder if anyone tried to line the muffin pan with disposable muffin baking cups. The pudding got stuck on the the muffin cup and I ended up throwing away the bottom part of the pudding.

OK, I followed this to the T, and all I have is ""english biscuts"". My eggs were room temp, flour sifted, and they are only as high as the amount of batter I poured in, so now what? Back to the toll house pkg!

I've never had these before, so nothing to compare to, but they were delicious!! I did add 1t. of salt. I also ended up with way more batter than the 12 called for. Another 6 maybe? One teaspoon of oil per cup was also WAY too much, so maybe the originator used a jumbo muffin tin. All three of my picky kids ate them without complaint, the hubby compared them to popovers(which I've also never had). Nice and simple, and much faster than making rolls like I usually do with roast.

This is the only recipe I will use for Yorkshire pudding again. They were high and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I used my blender to mix igredients and did add a pinch of salt. I was worried about the high temp for the whole cooking time, but it was fine.

They rose!!  I followed this recipe and halved the ingredients to make 6 muffin tins.  I used King Arthur All Purpose Flour and added a pinch of salt which you do need.  I also left the batter at room temperature.  I have been in the States for 3 years and my Yorkshires always flopped! thank you so much. x

This yorkshire pudding recipe actually seems to work! makes high yorkies with hollow middle. Modifications: I halfed the recipe -and still used 4 eggs to equal 1 cup of other ingredients and added 1/2 tsp salt. ...but they got very brown in aobut 20 minutes-had to reduce the heat with 10 min left. Finally took them out of the oven w 5 min to go. Not sure if it was my over-use of eggs, or something with the recipe itself. Even so, they were quite passable.

This recipe turned out really good.
However, I would suggest adding a little more salt than called for a bit more flavour.

Delicious when hot out of the oven, but they taste a little oily after they start to cool. They aren't much like traditional Yorkshire Pudding, but considerably easier to make than the real deal.

Great recipe.  Quantities made 24 muffin-size puddings.   I added 1 tsp salt and let everything come up to room temp and they came out wonderfully puffy.

Very simple and very delicious. I reduced the cook time to 25 minutes and they came out perfect! They are definitely dense, but not too dense to take away the hollow-goodness that is Yorkshire Puds. I highly recommend this recipe! My boyfriend (British) even thought I stole his grandmother's recipe.

These turned out PERFECT!!!  I've never made them before, but my father-in-law requested that I learn before he comes to visit from Australia and meet me for the first time.  I made them and my husband claims that I've done the right thing!!  Thank you for making me look like a hero!!

I've never had Yorkshire pudding before and wanted to try it with a roast I was making.  As suggested, I made sure the batter was at room temperature before baking and the puddings came out perfect.  Very delicious!  My boyfriend loved them so much that he begged me to make more the next night with a chicken I was roasting and then again as a snack later in week.  This is definitely going to be a staple in our house from now on.

good - satified my craving for yorkshire pudding, and my boyfriend, who dislikes all "bready" things, ate two.  I should have added more salt, however, as they could have used it.

I love yorkshire pudding and have always wanted to make it.  I couldn't have been happier.  After Christmas dinner my 9-year-old daughter announced she wanted the same thing next year.  Not only did they taste incredible, they were so beautiful we took a picture of them in the oven.  A new Christmas tradition is begun!  Oh, and yes, it is so easy to make.

The Best Yorkies to date!  I mixed the ingredients in my blender and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Also, I used 1 tsp lard in oversized muffin tins and made sure it was smoking before I divided the batter into 6 portions.  They almost hit the roof of my oven!  They were done in about 25 minutes, tender and tasty.  Thanks

I found that the recipe could use a little salt and/or other seasoning, and that the cooking time was closer to 25-30 min.  Other than that, they were brilliant!  Light and fluffy and very high.  With a couple of tweaks, I'll be using this again and again.

I don't know what I did wrong but these did not turn out for me.  I used the suggestion to have the eggs and milk at room temperature and followed the recipe exactly. I was very disappointed as I had made them for my husband and daughter's combined birthday yesterday. I should know better than to try new recipes on important occasions!!

Oh my!!!  These are SO good!  Since I was only cooking for 3, I cut the recipe in half.  Had to go back and make another half!  Making them again for the 2nd time this week and serving with baked potato soup.  The men in my house are thrilled.  Thank you for such a great and easy recipe.

I've attempted to make Yorkshire Pudding numerous times in the past and failed miserably.  I followed this recipe to the letter and followed the suggestions (room temp. batter) and they were GREAT.  I used my P-Chef stoneware muffin pan and they came out without sticking (like my failures). I will never buy store-bought rolls again, if I'm making a roast, I'm making these Yorkies.

My family is English and I usually make mine like my mum in a old black skillet with the dripping from the meat- excellent, but 2 years ago moved my family moved to Utah from Calif. and at 5000+ altitude it would never rise. I read the ratings and glad I did, they rised nicely we ate them all.

I would give this 6 stars, if I could. This was so wonderful, so perfect, words fail me. I was worried that they would get too dark near the end, so I turned the oven off for the last 3 or 4 minutes. But I'm sure I was worried for nothing.

My wife and I had company in for dinner.  we had roast beef with all the trimmings and of course this sky high yorkshire pudding.  Needless to say the pudding got higher praise than our dinner.  This is one of our favorite recipes.  Thank you.

Ok. But not fabulous. Burned and stuck to pan. Used lower rack on 450 and pulled them out at 25 minutes. Perhaps I misunderstood the directions. Might try again but watch more closely and use non stick spray on the muffin tin.
