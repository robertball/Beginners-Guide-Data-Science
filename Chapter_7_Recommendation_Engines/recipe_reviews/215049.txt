I love this dressing! I was in Germany for 3 1/2 years and remembered this dressing, so good then, so good now! I made it for a family German/Swedish dinner and it was a hit! Thanks :)

My Grandma used to make something like this for coleslaw when I was just a girl, and I have never liked anyone else's coleslaw.  She used milk and actual sugar though, I just couldn't remember measurements.  I used your measurements and her ingredients, and it's just like I remember.  Thank you so much!

I remember my Oma making this for me as a child. It is  very easy and quick to make and tastes just as I remembered! I added fresh cut chives like my grandmother did. It was always used  on soft boston  or bibb lettuce with very thin sliced cucumbers.

I've been looking for this simple little recipe for such a long time! It was served on the little salad at the Edelweiss Klub with Wiener Schnitzel! So easy, so good. Thanks for bringing back such good and tasty memories.

It's too watery so for my liking.  I used it on cole slaw, and it just slid off the cabbage shreds, and i didn't think it had all that much flavor.  It's OK and I like the way this breaks down nutritionally, but I won't be making this one again.

So simple, so good.  I added some garlic and Johnny's seasoned salt the second time I made it.  Great recipe, thanks!

I love it! It's fast, easy and I love the taste. I've played around with it a little adding different herbs, but you don't need to..it's great!

I didnâ€™t have half and half, so in place of it I used a mixture of plain Greek yogurt and kefir. It was good with organic spring mix and cucumbers (all finely cut up).
