Very good and easy. Doubled the recipe, baked in a 9 x 13 pan. Sprinkled some shredded cheddar on top for the last five minutes or so.  Nice and moist without being the "gloppy" scalloped corn I remember from when I was a kid.  I really liked the green onion as well. This will be put in my favorites.

This was a pretty good recipe. I used only about 2/3 the amount of crackers called for, and that worked out just perfect for me.I liked how easy it was to make.

Iloved this recipe but I changed all the ingredients.  I used potatoes, cream of mushroom soup, no eggs, regular crackers, yellow onions and then baked it at 375 degrees for an hour.  It was as good as this recipe.  Just kidding. This was great as is.

This is so delicious.  It tastes like a corn bread stuffing we have at a mexican restaurant near by.  The only change I made was using white onion and adding 1/2 c. shredded cheddar cheese to the top about 10 min before it was done.  Will definately be making again and again.  Also, add a little salt and pepper to taste.

I've been making a version of this for years.  Double the recipe, omit the milk and use a can of sweetened condensed milk and crushed red pepper to taste.  It's excellent!

Tasty.  I liked it even better the next day.  A bit more interesting than plain old corn.

It turned out good. Nice flavor & the consistancy was kinda like a mushy cornbread.

Well, this didn't suit the tastebuds of members of my family. It was almost like a corn souffle or casserole and lacked something in flavor. IT was a bit mushy, I think the recipe calls for too much milk and didn't have much of a flavor. Unfortunately I don't think I will make this again.

This recipe, for me, is just ok.  I think it has too many crackers.  It tastes like wet crackers with corn mixed in.  I left out the onions and added pepper - there's just something else missing that other scalloped corn recipes I've tasted had.  Back to the drawing board.

This is an awesome recipe. I substituted half and half for the milk. Added 1/2 cup of shredded cheese in the mix and then the last 5 mins of cooking I topped it off with another 1/2 cup.  My family are huge corn fans and this is a dish I will be making again soon. Even my 9 yr old ate seconds on this one.

This very easy to make and tasted delicious!  used ingredients that I always have in the house which is an extra bonus.  added 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to the mixture, and another 1/2 cup on the top the last 10 minutes of baking.  awesome!

Although this was easy to make,  all I tasted was the crackers,  and it had a mushy wet cracker texture throughout.

this recipe is simple and tasty. if anyone makes the mistake that i did (buying 2 cans of whole kernel corn instead of 1 can and 1 can creamed corn)  if you add just a little bit of salt and then 1/4 cup extra milk if still is good.

Oddly, the crackers fluff up like a dense souffle. Because I am southern and its what we do... I added Velveeta (instead of milk), canned green chilis, half a jalapeño, and topped with a handful of cheddar. Baked until sides of my casserole browned up. Family loved it.

MMMM this was so good...the only reason I gave it a four star was because I made 2 little modifications.  First, I cut the crackers in half and then added shredded cheese.  I also topped with a sprinkle of shredded cheese the last 10 minutes of baking.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was tasty, but a bit dry.  I would reccomend adding some more things to it, like cheese on top or something like tuna inside.

I used Ritz cheese crackers for this recipe.  It was very easy to make and tasted good but I do not think I will make again because it uses an awful lot of crackers--I had to use two sleeves.

I have made this multiple times...is quite good,  I used bacon Ritz crackers,  used half and half instead of milk, a bit of garlic powder and white pepper kicked it up a bit and have even sprinkled in some Cajun spice and bacon bits...is a very versatile dish that can be  paired with many main dishes and changed to fit the taste u want, try adding some diced green  or red pepper for extra flavor as well and yes add cheddar cheese or try pepper jack for southern spice

I consider this a comfort food -- tasty, but simple. I have trouble finding scallions where I live, so I use fresh minced onion.  I have substituted bread crumbs when I was low on crackers and it tasted fine.  (I wish that the amount of cracker crumbs were stated in cups to take the guesswork out -- I think I have used 3 cups of whatever I had available.)  I also add a few grinds of fresh pepper before baking.  Basic, but easy.  We eat mainly vegetarian, so a large portion of this with a salad makes an easy meal.

I would give 5 stars but I changed recipe a little after reading reviews.  I also only used 1/2 of the crackers but I added 1 small can of chopped green chili peppers, a little tobasco sauce and shredded cheddar cheese (in the mix and then more on top when it was almost done baking).  Delicious!

Granted, I only used one sleeve (about half) of whole wheat Ritz crackers, but my boyfriend and I just weren't overly impressed.  It seemed to be missing something - garlic?  Some other spice?  Or maybe we just prefer a more sweet corn pudding to scalloped corn...

This reminded me of my Grandma! I changed the recipe a little I used 1 tube of wheat Ritz crackers, 3 eggs, ½ cup of ½ & ½, and 4 strips of cooked bacon chopped and no onions. It has a custard consistency you could cut it in squares and it would hold together but defiantly not dry. Family all loved it remained me of when I was a child at family holidays and pot luck dinners at church! For sure a keeper!!! Thanks for the basic recipe!

I used half the crackers and half the green onion. Next time I think I will add more green onion.

My husband loved this, kids did not care for it.  They do not like cooked veggies.  I did not use salt or surgar.  I did use some garlic powder, cauliflower, regular onions and greenpeppers.
