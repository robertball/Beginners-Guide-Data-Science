I am giving 5 stars for convenience. I doubled the recipe and threw it all together in a 9x13 dish and baked it. I got away with a meal that my family thought that I spent hours on. My three-year-old asked for thirds. This dish isn't the fanciest but it is worth it for a busy family.

I departed from the recipe slightly. I used 5 ounces of the cooking creme and 4 tablespoons of water. This gave a lighter sauce.

The taste is very nice and not cluttered.

This is a simple and fast recipe that is within reach for even the least experienced cook.
