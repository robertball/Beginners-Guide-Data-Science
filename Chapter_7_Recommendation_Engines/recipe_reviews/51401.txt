I ran across this recipe, and just had to try it as I love onions.  The onions are sweet and mild and still have a nice crunch to them. Great with plain saltine crackers - make plenty as they go fast.

My only suggestion would be to cut the onion rings in half as it is easier to put them on the crackers that way.

This is incredible!  I made this for a party and everyone went crazy over them, they were completely surprised.  People who hated onions were eating this!  I agree though, cut the onions up smaller, easier to put on the crackers.

HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!  Too sweet and just plain bad.  It tastes like something that a 5-year old would try to throw together.  Don't even think about making this for a party.  YUCK.

I thought I would try this since my husband loves onions never thought it would have tasted this good!! I brought it out at a party I had and everyone was amazed how good it was~The only thing I did diffrent was to put the mixture in food processor to make it easier to put on the crackers~I leave it whole when want to add it cucumbers and tomatoes and use as a side dish that is how much we like this one!!

YUM!  These were so easy to make, and very unique.  I didn't chill the additional 2 hours, and they came out just fine.  I did cut the onions in half to make them fit better on the crackers.  I used Carr Water Crackers.  Several people asked me for the recipe, it was a great sucess!

After draining and folding the onions into the mayonnaise, I added a heaping teaspoon of garlic powder and a good measure of fresh ground black pepper. OH MY GOODNESS, these are addictive! I swear, I could eat the whole bowl. NOTE: I used a reduced fat mayonnaise.

I first made this about 15 years ago...loved the recipe and then promptly lost it.  (Have been searching ever since!)  My source originally recommended it for hamburgers...yummy!  Thank you for posting this - I'm going to make it today.

Sorry, but I thought this tasted just like cole slaw.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  My husband agreed that it tasted like cole slaw from KFC.

I was really skeptical that this would be any good but it was the perfect appetizer! It made a ton of onions too. I cut the onions into smaller pieces so they fit better.  I served it with two different kinds of crackers and it does taste much better on a salty cracker as suggested. You do have to like onions to enjoy this recipe, and not mind onion breath afterwards!

The 'You've got to be kidding' part of this recipe is because these are terrible!  Don't waste your time.  I was sucked in by the good reviews, but these were a disappointment. Glad I only made a half batch - these were not a hit.

I love onions and I've wanted to try this recipe for a while and I'm glad I did.  I used sweet vidalia onions and it was a hit at the birthday party I brought it to.  I served it with Ritz crackers, but any cracker would work just fine.  It does sort of remind me of cole slaw, but maybe that's because I chopped the onions so they'd be easier to get on to the crackers.  Very good, surprising taste and I will be serving this again soon!

I was very skeptical as I was making this dish. But I took it to a volunteer meeting and everyone there LOVED it. I did not get one bad comment about this. And now I have several requests to bring this to the next volunteer meeting.

These were interesting...good on saltine crackers.  It made a huge batch, but stored well in the fridge.

Made a test batch yesterday and I'm happy to say it is every bit of good that all the posters said it was.  I tried it by itself and on a cracker.  Much better with the cracker.  Try it.  You'll be surprised how tasty this simple recipe is.

This is such a great recipe!  I've only had the opportunity to make it twice, but plan on making it again soon.  The first time I used regular mayonnaise and loved it (and so did everyone else that tried it!).  The second time I tried the "healthier" olive oil mayo and was disappointed.  It just didn't taste the same.  I'll stick with the regular mayo from now on.

I had to try this because it sounded so unusual, and I really wanted to like it.  Its not bad exactly, just not something I will ever make again and definately not something I would take anywhere.  Very very sweet.

I was excited to try this after reading reviews, but found it to be OK. Nothing I'll make again. Taste like crackers with wet onions on top.

I tried this out for just two of us scaling it to one onion.  I had to use a regular onion since I didn't have a sweet one.  It was fine and I may continue to do that in the future since some reviewers said they found it was too sweet using a sweet onion.  It's easy and different and it's on my keeper list.

I wasn't expecting the taste and am sad to say that I threw the whole batch out.  My husband, his friend, and I didn't hate it but didn't think it was all that great.  I'm sure others would love this dish, it just wasn't for us.

Easy to make, and folks at a party liked this ONCE they tasted it. That seems to be the stumbling block... I had them in the center of a serving dish, surrounded by crackers. Very few takers, but those that did try it, liked it. I will admit I had quite a lot of appetizers on the table, so maybe this got overlooked. If you're looking for a home run to serve, go with the King's Hawaiian Spinach dip recipe (on this site). Now THAT was a winner.

Very tasty on saltine crackers... allowing the onions to sit in the vinegar and sugar mixture really took out a lot of the heat... it reminded me of a cucumber onion salad with out the cucumber.. good way to use up onions

The first time I made this, we thought it was tasty, but way too sweet, so now I use 1/3 cup sugar. I also like replacing some of the mayo with sour cream or cream cheese. People always get excited about these onions! Also great with Ritz crackers. My favorite  hors d'oeuvre for a cookout.

Have made this twice for parties and both times they were the first to disappear.  The second time I made it I chopped the onions - much easier to spoon onto a cracker.  Also, we like it better with either traditional Ritz crackers or with water crackers.

I tried this just out of curiosity because it was so odd.  Took it to a friend's party and it was a hit!  My DH put a big ole spoonful on his plate and ate it as a side dish he liked it so much.

I tried this recipe for a family gathering - primarily because most everyone in my family LOVES onions.  Even though it looked like a really odd recipe - how could I go wrong with onions?????  This is just incredible.  Even the very few members of my family who are not onion lovers thought it was GREAT.  They didn't know it had onions in it (how strange is that??)  Everyone thought it had PINEAPPLE.  And I admit - somehow - it really does have a pineapple flavor to it - at least with the Vidalia onions I used.  I've had several family members ask for this recipe since I first made it - and they all got RAVE reviews.  I made it again today for a Memorial Day Bar-B-Que tomorrow.   I have every confidence it will be a hit - AGAIN!  PS - definitely cut the onion slices in half - much easier to fit on a cracker.

At a recent cocktail party, a friend served this dish and, as odd as it seems, it was the hit of the buffet. Upon tasting it I immediately requested the recipe. My friend got it from a local church cookbook. In that collection it was called 'Yummy Onions' and yummy is right. Also makes an excellent hamburger and hotdog topping.

I loved this served with just plain old crackers. I also used it as a topping on some grilled steak, that I simply dressed with salt and pepper. I will make this again.

Decided day of to take to son's cookout so didn't marinate overnight. Heated water, vinegar, sugar & pinch of salt to low boil. Off heat then added onions sliced on thicker setting of mandoline. 5 hours & crisp tender & delicious I would love as were. Drained then added the mayo & celery salt plus garlic powder, pepper & a good squirt of Vadalia salad dressing.  Expected some to like but surprised  at others. Onion hater DH & little DGD  loved. The mom said 6 yr old step DGS wouldn't eat but had to cut him off. Had cut the Vidalias in half before slicing but will cut smaller next time since a bit sloppy hanging off the cracker. Saltines a bit pasty to me so will try with another salty cracker. Some just eating out of the bowl. Made a half batch but  will try a full recipe for BIL's  'picky eaters' 4th of July potluck.

I don't want to discourage anyone from trying this but I love onions and was diappointed!  I think at best, it would be a good sandwich or burger topper...  won't make it again.

Addictive - especially if you like onions.  My husband said it tasted like coleslaw, but I thought that it was pretty good, despite my onion breath!  I'm sure I'll make it again.

These are incredible! I spiral sliced the onions on my "Spirooli" machine. This made them paper thin. Then I cut them into pieces with kitchen scissors. Did as recipe states & served with saltine "Keebler Club Crackers". Even people who wern't too fond of onions loved them!! What a Find!

I just made this (again) for a party my son had for his office.  This time I put everything thru a food processor and garnished with chopped green onions - he said it was a hit and I had to send the recipe to work with him so copies could be passed around!

I really liked this. I was quite surprised how much the onions 'mellowed' overnight. I would omit the celery salt next time though - just personal preference. We had it with cheese as a topping for baked potatoes. Thanks, Kathy!

I made these last night and they were very good. Couldn't be any easier to whip up. I like them as a hamburger topping the best. I also use them on hotdogs ~ yummy! A future staple of my summertime BBQs.

I made this last night and used as a hamburger topper. Big Hit. Everybody loved it and I have already had a request for the recipe.
