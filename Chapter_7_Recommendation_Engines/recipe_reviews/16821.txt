My grandmother was from Agnone Italy and this was her recipe. She would never have put anything tomato in this recipe. That would be more like Minestrone, which is another excellent Italian soup.  I am the submitter of this recipe and I just wanted to comment on the "lack of pasta" in this recipe.  My grandmother never put pasta in her wedding soup.  I wanted to share the recipe as it was prepared in my Italian family.  You can add pasta if you like it, of course.

I am giving this 5 stars because this is the only recipe that had the egg mixture in it. I combined the end of this recipe with the first part of 'Mama's Italian Wedding Soup' by Lalena. I also made a bunch of changes to that recipe - see my rating for details.

This was a truley amazing dish...a technique that I used for this was to shock the spinach which i used in place of the escole.  this is done by placing the spinach in ice water when straining out of the boiling water.  this keeps the spinach that vibrant green color.  This can be done with any green vegtable to keep its color.

Great recipe...but remove the meatballs from the broth (after they are cooked) and before you add the escarole, put the egg mixture into the broth and cook it before you add the meatballs and escarole... it makes it easier if you do this first...
oh and the meatballs are great with spaghetti...yummmmy

This is the closest thing to my Italian Grandmother's version - she owned three restaurants.  The smaller you make the meatballs the better -- also we boil and shred chicken in the broth and add just a few homeade croutons on the top with parmesan cheese.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars since it is the most like the soup I make.  The other recipes on this web site do not come close to the soup my husband and I grew up with.  The one glaring omission in this recipe is the PASTA!  Acini di pepe is a must in this recipe.  Add to your taste.  I also prefer to use fresh spinach instead of escarole but my husband is use to escarole and likes it.  I do not add the egg at the end of the recipe since I do not prefer it this way.  I also add some minced garlic.  Overall this recipe has promise!

This is the most similar to my own family's recipe for meatball soup. Ours never had pasta either. The only difference is that instead of the egg mixture, we make an egg-based crouton that tops the soup after it's been ladled into the bowls. To make the croutons, beat eggs with parsley, garlic salt, and pepper. Soak cubes of bread in the egg mixture, then deep fry until crisp. These can be made ahead of time, then toasted in the oven to re-crisp just before serving.

This soup was bland with too much escarole, not enough broth, and the cheese/egg mixture made it gloppy and unappetizing (yes, I stirred while adding). It didn't look very appetizing and I threw away the rest of it.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did make changes, as we all do. Used spinach instead of escarole. Added orzo pasta (but tasted before adding and its really fine without). Added 1/2 an onion to the broth. Used fresh herbs instead of dried (i think this gives the 'wow' flavor you need) The egg & parm part was awesome! Also, I have read reviews about cooking the meatballs with the soup and cooking separate...i took advice from another review that stated if you cook the meatballs separate you really take away alot of flavor to the broth, i think she was def right about that...cook them in the broth! I had this soup for dinner last night, lunch today... and planning on eating again tonight for dinner! LOL

This was so easy and super yummy!  I added garlic and onion to my meatballs and used kale instead escarole (couldn't remember which one I needed when at the store).  My 11 year old helped with the meatballs, was super easy and quick.  I also added the egg/parmesean mixture before adding the meatballs and kale back in.  Kale tasted wonderful in it and I think I will use from now on. Excellent!

All was very good with some changes until I put in the egg and parmesan mixture.  Stirred as directed it now looks awful.  Can't taste the chicken base or meatballs at all, only parmesan cheese!

WOW!.....Awesome recipe! Made this soup for Hubby and I, and now that we know how good it is, it will become a "company soup". I used a "less sodium" broth and it was perfect! The cheese adds just enough saltiness. I only made one major change. I substituted a large (12 oz.) bag of fresh baby spinach for the escarole. This will be a favorite in my house. Simple to make and delicious! Val

We like  that this recipe doesn't have pasta.  My husband is diabetic and can't eat the pasta.  This is a wonderful recipe that all five of us, including three children ages five to ten, enjoy.  Mangia!

This is very good, but (as with other reviewers) I made a few changes.  I used a ground chicken and ground veal mixture for the meatballs, along with egg, parmesean, bread crumbs, black pepper and parsley.  I also added diced carrots.  I didn't have escarole, so I used spinach.  My kids LOVED it!

My husband had seconds, and my son finished his at regular speed vs the hour it takes when he doesn't like something... so it must have been good. I used a bag of baby spinach instead of escarole, but I should have chopped it or tore the leaves because they didn't shrivel up as much as I thought they would. I added onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper and a little sea salt to the meatballs, and left out the bread crumbs.  I only used 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of parmesan mixture to add to the broth.  It didn't look or taste disgusting as other reviewers suggested.

This is a great tasting soup.  I had meatballs left over after increasing the recipe to 12 for a baby shower and just saved them for making the soup another day.  Making extra meatballs really cuts down on time later on.  I also added little star-shaped pasta.  Very tasty indeed!

I liked this recipe a lot. My six year old son went back for seconds.  Even my picky brother liked it.    I used spinach because it was easy to pick up at the store, used some home made chicken broth that I had left over from something else and I added acini de pepe pasta. I'm sure it'd have been good without it as well, but we're a pasta family so I'll always make it with.

Loved this recipe!  I made it, first of all, because it does not include garlic or onions.  (I used homemade chicken broth.)  Took reviewers tips to remove meatballs from broth after cooking, then to add egg/cheese mixture, then escarole & meatballs again.  Not sure that was necessary as long as the meatballs do not cook too long before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I did not cook the soup further from this point.  The only changes I made were to add 1/2 t salt to meatball mixture and subbed romano cheese since that's what I had.  Also fresh basil/parsley to the meatball mixture.  I might add some pasta to it next time for a heartier soup.  Thanks to you and your grandmother for this wonderful version of Wedding Soup.

Good soup for a warm day. Easy too! I made in my crock-pot, broiled the meatballs (used turkey) for a few minutes, added a bit of oregano and also mixed 2 eggs + a few tablespoons of romano cheese and swirled it into the soup for 1 minute. Made a few mistakes, put the onion in the soup instead of the meatballs and added garlic which should have gone into the meatballs as well. But overall, a good recipe!

I've been searching for a recipe similar to my gradmother's and I've found it, Thanks Karen! I make a double batch of meatballs and freeze one batch. This makes it especially quick for those evenings when time is premium.

It turned out great. I used spinach instead of escarole and dropped it in the soup after the meatballs were done. I also added 3/4 cup uncooked star pasta to the soup and it was done same time as the meatballs. Will sure make it again.

Just three stars for it's bare bonesness.  With changes, it's fab.  I made my own broth from the bones of chicken I roasted the night before; one chicken carcass, picked clean, one tomatato, celery rib, 1/2 onion, four clove garlic, one can V8, put in crockpot on low overnight.  I put the meatballs on a cookiesheet in the oven to brown then into soup, also added white beans and a spoonful of pesto to the soup for added flavor, it seemed a little meh, to me. This was especially good with bitter, hearty black bread.

This a pretty good basic recipe for this type of soup.When I make this I use half very lean groung chuck & half lean ground pork.The family doesn't care for the egg mixture at the end.
So I skip it (that's another kind of soup altogether. The only thing missing at the end is the addition of finely grated lemon zest . Just a little. It really gives the broth a fresh finish.

I liked this recipe, but I made a few changes.  I used 1 bunch of spinach and didn't add the egg & cheese mixture at the end.  I used 1 T. oregano instead of 1 t. parsley because it's all I had.  I also added 8 oz. of small pasta shells.  I made this soup for my boyfriend when he was sick because his grandma used to make it for him.  He enjoyed it very much.

I have never bothered to review a recipe before but this was so good I just had to.  I was really skeptical of this because I'd never had wedding soup before with egg in it like this but I was really suprised at how good it tasted.  I tweaked the proportions just a bit because I thought it was way too many meatballs and just a bit too much escarole. I did add some orzo pasta too it, sorry I just love the pasta.  This was just fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent soup!! The only difference I made was mixing pork and beef for the meatballs and adding a cup of orzo pasta. I also mixed the escarole and spinach together.

This recipe is FABULOUS!!!  I've made it several times for family functions and it gets raves from everyone.  I also use spinach which works fine.  To save time, I make the meatballs the night before and refrigerate, as they are time consuming.  My husband requests this soup often!!  Thank you!!

EXCELLENT SOUP!  Just made it and it was well worth the extra effort.  Soup usually tastes better the second day, but no need to wait for the flavor to come out here.  Next time, the only thing I would do differently is use homemade chicken broth.

Great soup! This is the most authentic of all the recipes listed, well at least according to my particular Italian upbringing! It was the eggs swirled in. The only changes I made were to add day old fresh bread crumbs moistened with a little milk as my mama did. No escarole in my area so I used spinich and it worked well. I also was lucky enough to have fresh chicken from the Amish farm down the road. Now this was heaven!

Wonderful soup!  I substituted spinach and used 1 lb. of Italian Chicken sausage instead of hamburger.  I also used fresh basil and added 1 clove of chopped fresh garlic to the meatballs.  I added 1/2 cup of acini pepe (orzo pasta) to the soup, it made a HUGE difference and added more texture to the soup.  Very filling and light.  This is my new favorite!  A huge hit with the whole family!

I like the idea of Parmesan and egg mix. However, I cant help adding onion, garlic, carrots, and pasta in the soup for color and texture. Precooked meatballs will do as well.

I should have paid more attention to the fact that everyone who gave this recipe a high rating altered most of the ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and the result was the worst tasting Italian Wedding Soup I have ever had.  I was suspicious about the large amount of basil in the meatball recipe, and I should have followed my instinct. I agree with Lizzy about the egg mixture at the end. My final review:  Absolutely unedible.

Nice and light, I loved this version of Italian Wedding Soup!  My changes: homemade chicken broth instead of canned to dramatically reduce sodium, organic half lean ground pork/beef for the meatballs, chopped frozen spinach since I couldn't find any fresh spinach or escarole, and slightly reduced amount of dried basil used in meatballs.  I also omitted using Parmesan cheese in the final egg/cheese mix, although I thought the egg was a nice touch at the end. As someone else mentioned in their review, it's a lot easier to incorporate the egg at the end into the soup after fishing out the cooked meatballs and before adding the spinach/escarole...just lightly beat the egg and use a fork to mix the egg well into the soup.  

I look forward to making this again and again!

The first time I ever had Wedding Soup was in a restaurant.  I fell in love with the flavor, texture,and the overall appearance.  This recipe, I believe, comes the closest to that recipe.  Kudos, for sticking to your grandma's recipe.  I read some of the reviews and of course, I like all the rest have our own ideas on what to add or take out! That is the beauty of the soup - it is "flexible".  Thanks for sharing with us.

the flavor is great. delicious. i made minor changes to the meatballs by adding some onion powder to the meatball mixture. i think the amount of basil and parsley is overboard. i would scale back next time. addtionally, i added some small diced carrots and about 1/3 cup of acini de pepe pasta and another 1 cup of water for the absorption factor. i know the egg/parm mixture is italian authentic, however, it is not terribly attractive to the soup. (what can i say, i'm a polish girl!!!)while the flavor was great, i prefer the italian wedding soup I recipe that is on this site, which i have made endlessly and recieved rave reviews on.(and does not have the appearance of small curd cottage cheese served...

My freezer is full of Elk meat and ground elk worked perfectly for this recipe. A very nice soup, especially for winter eating. My husband like thicker soup so I used a cup of Acini de Pepe and skiked the egg and parmesan cheese.

This soup is absolutely wonderful! Believe it or not, the thing that took the longest was chopping up the escarole, but putting that aside the flavors were delicious! I used 50% less sodium and FF Chix Broth.  I also used ground Turkey and 4C's new low carb Bread Crumbs and LF Parmesian Cheese, and you would never had known because it tasted like the real thing. The only problem I had was with the 3 eggs and 1 cup cheese, that cup of cheese made my soup very salty,  but it was an easy fix, just add more chicken broth. I had 3 bowls for supper and was VERY satisfied.

I made this soup for the first time in my life and it was wonderful.  My whole family loved it also. Such a great blend of flavors.

Awesome recipe. I did add the Acini de Pepe as one reviewer noted. The Waterfront Bistro restaurant in northern Indiana makes it that way so I decided to add those little pasta balls as they do. Excellent. Thanks for sharing. Very easy to make and soooo good.

I make this exactly as submitted, although if I happen to have a blend of beef/pork or beef/pork/veal or beef/pork/turkey I'll sub that in for the beef.  Always fantastic.  (I should note that if  the Escarole heads are large, I will cut back to one, but sometimes they are small enough that two are needed.

I made this yesterday for lunch and just polished off the last bowl, ending with today's lunch. This soup was super yummy! I love Italian Wedding Soup but have never made it. This IWS recipe gave me great confidence! I made mini mini meatballs. I also used about 1/2 small bag frozen spinach and then thawed it the microwave before adding to the soup so I could monitor the amounts. I added 1/2 small box orzo pasta, also prepared separately before adding to the broth. Cooking the meatballs in the both gave them such great flavor. I think I only used about .25 lb of ground beef, making about 25 mini meatballs. The egg parm mixture ( also halved) made the soup appear so appetizing, a very nice addition! I had no idea this is how original wedding soup was made. Keep in mind what your family enjoys most about soup ... do they like more broth ... more pasta? This soup is a versatile recipe that you can make to your families liking. I served with a crusty french loaf. Thank you so much SHECOOKS2 for sharing your grandmothers wonderful recipe as well as others that reviewed this recipe :)
