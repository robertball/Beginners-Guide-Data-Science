This is one of the best fresh salsas with salmon - the cherries and mint add a refreshing twist.

I call this recipe "My Old Faithful" whenever I need to make a dish that is easy, light, and guaranteed to impress. Its also so easy to make that its a main player in my monthly repertoire of family dinners & lunches. EVERYONE always raves on and on about it and asks for the recipe. The orange or lemon peel + brown sugar is what really does it I think. Often times I skip the cherries entirely and it still comes out fantastic, or substitute in mango or pineapple for a beautiful caribbean dish. I absolutely love this dish and cannot recommend it enough.

I made this recipe as listed.  All I can say is FABULOUS!!

We have started eating low-fat, low-sodium, low-cholesterol, and high-fiber on a daily basis, but it has been a difficult task since we all love rich, robust flavors.  This Salmon recipe fit the bill!

This restaurant quality Salmon entree was accompanied by long grain brown & wild rice with a House-style salad topped with Kraft's Roasted Red Pepper and Parmesan dressing.

I HIGHLY recommend this recipe to anyone that loves eclectic flavors and fresh, nutritious foods!

YUMMY!! For the salsa I had to sub re-hydrated Craisens for the cherries and also added some diced red onion, a little pineapple and jalapeno. I'll be serving this at a dinner party this weekend.

Great recipe, I used cranberries instead of cherries and perch instead of salmon. Ripe mangoes are key, everything else is very versatile. Highly recommended!

So simple and Really good!! I only had 1 hour to marinate and it would have been so much better with more time. My only complain was that the sugar made it more difficult to get the salmon off the barbeque. But the flavours were soooo good! I made the salsa with canned cherries, mango and mint. Mmmmmm. Thanks for a healthy and very tasty dish!
