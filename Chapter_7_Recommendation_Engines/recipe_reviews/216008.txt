Off. The. Hook. Honestly one of the best cookies I've ever eaten. I don't know how it works with just the two tablespoons of butter, but it does. Freaking insane cookie. So good. NOTE: I did use pecans only because we don't care for walnuts. I also added more of the chocolate chips to the actual dough, but that was a personal choice. We like a fully loaded cookie. And you know, these were gone in less than 24 hours.

These cookies seemed like a lot of work, for the final end product. I made it go quicker by melting the chocolate and butter, in a small bowl, in the microwave for 1 min. and stirring after 30 seconds and when I pulled the bowl out. I also tried to simplify the steps by mixing the flour, baking powder, salt, nuts, and chocolate chips (not being melted) all in one large bowl and mixing the melted chocolate directly into the egg mixture. In the end, by the time they were slightly cracked on top, they weren't liquidy in the center. I thought these tasted like an extra chocolaty brownie cookie. I could have made brownies with extra chocolate chips and nuts much easier, if I liked that. Nothing special other than the unneccessary steps!
