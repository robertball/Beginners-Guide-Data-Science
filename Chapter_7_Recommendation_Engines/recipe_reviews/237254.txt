I used this spice blend to make a Chai Spice pound cake recipe that I found at King Arthur Flour. I had all these spices on hand, and so I felt it was less expensive that ordering the spice from KAF. I found this Chai spice recipe to be a little too heavy on the ground cloves which tended to mask the other more delicate spice flavors. So I would suggest using 1.5 teaspoons instead of the 2 teaspoons of cloves that the recipe calls for. 

This spice mix, despite the heavy clove flavor, was tasty. I do plan to use it again. By the way, these ingredients made a total to 3 tablespoons of spice mix. 

Bon Appetite!

I often cut flour tortillas into wedges, spray with butter-flavored non-stick cooking spray, sprinkle with a cinnamon-sugar mixture, spray again, and bake for about 6-7 mins at 350 degrees F.  I substituted chai spice for the cinnamon, and was pleased with the flavor the chai spice brought to the tortilla chips.  If you do this, just be sure your mixture leans more heavily toward sugar than the chai spice.  Enjoyed today for breakfast along with some fresh fruit, and a small serving of Greek vanilla yogurt.

This is a good blend.  I added it to oatmeal cookies so I left out the salt.  Next time I will use more cardamom and less pepper.  This was really good steeped with black tea.

This is the first time I've made a chai spice at home.  I followed the directions as written.  I heated 6 oz of water, added a plain tea bag, 1/4 tsp of the chai spice mix, 3 tablespoons of half n half and 2 tsp of honey.  I let it steep for about 3 minutes.  Removed the tea bag and heated it a few more seconds in the microwave.  I enjoyed it and it was comparable flavor to a homemade chai my yoga teacher made for our class, which used whole ginger and oatmeal milk.   That said, I don't like overly sweet drinks, so I think most people would need to add more honey.  By comparison to the Starbuck's chai tea latte, mine was much less sweet and had a thinner consistency.

Great flavor!  I used 1/2 less of the ground cloves.  I'm having some in my tea right now but am planning on putting into my homemade banana bread and snickerdoodle cookes.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a perfect blend of spices for me, particularly the  white pepper. Love it steeped in vanilla almond milk (no water); just the right amount of sweetness. Any hints finding a strainer fine enough to catch the spices?

I wanted to make chai tea at home so I made a batch of this and added it (to my taste) to tea with honey and unsweetened almond milk. I think it’s very nice! I made a triple batch and I’m storing it in two empty glass spice containers - one for work and one for home.
