I leave out the mandarin, add some parmesan flakes and balsamic vinegar/cream and it's delicious.

Beautiful and delicious! I didn't have a red onion, so I used sweet onion. Used 'Horseradish Vinaigrette' from this site for the dressing w/ a bit of honey added to compliment the sweet fruits. This would also be great w/ some crumbled blue cheese added, which I will try next time. Thanks for sharing. :)
