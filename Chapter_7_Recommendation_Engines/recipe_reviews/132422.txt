I do not like mushrooms but we keep getting them in our weekly CSA and I am sick of them going to waste.  I found this recipe thinking, if I don't like it my husband will surely eat it all for dinner and leftovers.  I loved this recipe.  Tastes as good or better than any cheese soup recipe I have ever had.  I sliced the shiitakes really thin.  I used a whole yellow onion and threw in half a bunch of sliced swiss chard (w/ stems) as I had some to use up.  I omitted the sage due to a lack of it and used 2 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of milk in lieu of the beef broth.  Prior to adding the liquids, I added three tablespoons of flour and browned everything together.  I increased the amount of cheese to adjust for the increase in onion, addition of swiss chard.  I served it in bowls topped with chopped green onion.  Fabulous!

I used this recipe and halved it all except the sage (cause I love sage) and the bacon (cause seriously have you ever heard anyone say "it would have been good if it weren't for all that pesky bacon"?) It is supposta be a soup but I just added a bit of flour and cornstarch to thicken it up then served it over egg noodles, though rice would have been good too. YUM!!!!

The flavor is spectacular.  I would have done the cheddar differently.  It clumped together and fell to the bottom.  The next time, I will make a white sauce with butter and flour cooked, milk added then cheddar. Add that to the soup.

I love this soup, I make it all the time and even my son who hates mushrooms loves it. I do mix chicken and beef broth for extra goodness, and peppered bacon add to it. Making it today actually.

Really great and easy to  make soup.  I omitted the sage as I didn't feel it meshed well with the flavor profiles of the mushrooms and bacon.  My only suggestion would be to drain most of the fat off the bacon before adding the mushrooms.  

I substituded the cheddar cheese with Weight Watchers Shredded Mexican Blend.  Worked great and makes the meal 3 points per serving!

Delicious!  Prepared as written, just decreased the quantities a little since it was just for me.  Very earthy and comforting.  Perhaps a splash of beer would be a nice addition?!  Will try next time.  Yum!

delicious soup! i don't like sage so i left that out, but it was excellent anyway. i ran out of shiitake mushrooms once and i used mun mushrooms (i think in the US they are called Jelly Ear mushrooms), and i think i actually like it more than with the shiitake. my favorite way of eating this soup is with udon noodles

Just cooked this up for dinner tonight, and this is probably one of the best soups I ever had. I subtracted the bacon (I can't stand the stuff) and used fat free beef broth. Came out fantastic!

This recipe was delicious.  I didn't have the bacon so I did leave that out.  I used 2 different kinds of fresh mushrooms and instead of using milk and broth I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup with 4 cans of water.  Recipes for me are always a "suggestion" so I used what was on hand and it turned out fabulous.

I must be too used to Velveeta having grown up with it. I obviously don't know how to stir in cheddar. Mine must have curdled, it was just a big stuck together blob. The soup was still good & flavorful even after taking the cheese blob out. I did have to use regular button mushrooms, it's all I had. I also subbed fresh oregano & thyme for the fresh sage. Subbed a bit of beer for the beef broth. Thanks!

The soup didn't have too much flavor. Like other reviewers, the cheese stuck together in one blob on the bottom of the pot. I added some thyme and it made it better (at least for me), but I probably won't make it again.

OUTSTANDING!  I followed the recipe to the letter EXCEPT I used chicken stock instead of beef.  It pairs much better with sage in my opinion. I also took Shelley's advice and added the cheese via a white sauce I prepared.  Super easy and delicious!

The flavor was wonderful and just as all of the other comments stated, the cheese does clump. What was not mentioned was that shitake mushrooms are a diarrhetic. Oh boy, they really are!

Quick way to use leftover mushrooms! I loved it and will most likely make it again.

I don't like Shiitake mushrooms but it turned out to be delicious! I used Dill weed instead of sage. I added the cheddar cheese just before eating a portion. It avoids the cheese to be all clumped up before serving.

Tasty soup. My family and our guests loved it although my hubby is not a soup-type person. It's also adaptable as you can see from other reviews.

I am not excited about the taste of this soup at all. It was kind of bland tasting and the cheddar clumped even though I had taken the soup off the burner and let it cool a bit. Added some parm to salt/flavor it up, along with more spices. Just too rubbery overall with the cheddar and shitakes.
