This is really, really good, and I like the fact that the sugar has been reduced from what the normal sauce would have.  It's wonderfully tangy, and could compete at any Southern backyard barbecue!  Great with chicken!

I used low sugar ketchup to make this even more low carb and I added a little dijon mustard. It is awesome. I used liquid sucralose because it is what I had, so it was a little thin, but it tastes amazing. I might try cooking it down one day when I have more time. It is a great recipe.

This is very good. I used it last night on chicken and BF said it was better than the BBQ sauce I usually make. Very easy to make also. A keeper for sure, thanks.

Huge hit with everyone and our new regular sauce.  Yeah!  Adjusted to 6 servings is perfect for us.

I cut the recipe in half...because it was too much and left out the pepper And didnt use Splenda...because I didn't have it.it was still too much vinegar.so I added about a half cup of sugar and a couple squeezes of more ketchup....one teaspoon of mustard seed and a quarter cup of minced onion.  And a dash of garlic powder...yum

Not good!   It was overpowered by the vinegar. It was very watery as well. To save it, I added more sweetener, honey, 1/2 cup.   I mixed cornstarch 2 T with 2 T water. Brought sauce and the thickening mix to a boil and cooked for two minutes, stirring constantly. At the end, I added half cup chicken stock and stirred well. Now it was tasty and a big hit as a dipping sauce for a roasted chicken.

By itself, not so good. The vinegar overpowered everything else. To fix that, all I did was add more hot sauce and ketchup. It's super thin so you can always cook it down to thicken it up.
