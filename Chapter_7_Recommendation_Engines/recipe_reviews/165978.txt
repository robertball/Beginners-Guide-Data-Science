Hubby and I loved this salad. We used plain Greek yogurt, lemon juice and zest, seedless green grapes, a whole smaller sweet onion and mint. This salad was great! We will be making this one again and again!

This is a very tasty chilled pasta salad, but I can't really imagine it served warm.  Today was one of our first  nice "summer" days and this made a good meal.  I added a cup of cooked chicken and mandarin oranges in addition to the grapes.  I have a lot of mint in my herb garden, also a lot of chives, so used them instead of green onion.

Adding lemon yogurt is a horrible idea-- it made the pasta sweet, which was not pleasant.

This recipe is so good and it is easy to prepare.  Everyone asks for the recipe when I make it.  It's refreshing on a warm day.

I tried doing this as followed, but it didn't seem to work for me or 2 others. I can imagine that the pasta pictured would be much better than the bow tie. I will try making this again, but adding more lemon yogurt and less mayonnaise. Like another reviewer said, i can't imagine this served warm either.

Maybe it was my tastebuds, but I did not care for this recipe.  Not one of my family members liked this dish. Will not make this again.
