I think a more appropriate name for this would be “Tangy Tomato Cocktail Sauce.”  The only way I can see this being a “dressing” is if you were serving cooked shrimp on a bed of lettuce and then dressed it with this.  This is a very tasty sauce for a shrimp cocktail (that’s how I ended up serving it) but IMO, no way is it a salad dressing...again, just my opinion.  Also, Clamato is much more expensive than regular tomato juice cocktail, and I think its flavor was just overwhelmed by the horseradish, black pepper and cayenne, so I wouldn’t spend the extra bucks for the Clamato if you try this.  Just to clarify, the 4-star rating is really for a good cocktail sauce, not a salad dressing.
