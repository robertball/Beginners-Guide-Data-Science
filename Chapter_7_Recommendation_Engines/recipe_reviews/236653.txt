This is a very nice recipe... we used our own cherry/grape tomatoes as well as our own fresh basil.... it makes this dish taste extremely fresh! Adding a pinch of some chili powder to the saut√©ed veggies gives it a perfect heat! We used elbow macaroni instead of the shells. I prefer this dish warm. Pasta fans will love this!

This was very good and very easy. I used campanelle instead of shells. This was a great cut with this sauce.  I increased the pancetta and also put it in the freezer prior to putting it in the food processor ( to help it not get mushy) I will make this again.
