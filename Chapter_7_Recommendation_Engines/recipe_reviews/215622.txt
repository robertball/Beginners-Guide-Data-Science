This is the best meat loaf I have ever eaten.  The only thing that I changed was the chicken, I used turkey. Very moist.  Tired this out on my boyfriend and he went back twice for more.  He couldn't wait for leftovers tonight.  It was better tonight.  Tanks for the WONDERFUL healthy recipe.

Fantastic! My partner and my son loved this recipe. In fact, my partner says it's his favorite recipe I've ever made. I served this with mushroom-garlic-herb couscous cooked in chicken broth.

This was great!  It tasted like a chicken dinner with all the fixins - all in one loaf!  It was not - knock-me-down WOW (It IS chicken) - but it had enough flavor that it was great for kids and adults.  The kids loved it.  I could barely tell there were apples in it.   I didn't have sage or celery, but I will be sure to get those for next time.  I might also add in some craisins.  I fine-diced the apples, onions and carrots before I read the directions.  They all got sauteed for the same amount of time - which I am glad!  Next time I will just buy the Mirepoix mix at the grocery store, and save the prep time.  I also scaled the recipe to one pound, no problems there.  There were no leftovers!  I will definitely try this again!

This was delicious!  My husband loved it, and I will definitely make it again.   I made a few minor changes.  I only used about 2 tablespoons of chopped onion, and about 1 stalk of celery.  I left out the pepper (my husband hates pepper), and the sage.  The poultry seasoning I used already had quite a bit of sage in it, so I didn't want to overdo it.  I used 1 cup of breadcrumbs instead of 1/2 cup.   The mixture was too 'wet' with only 1/2 cup.   Lastly, I didn't use mustard for the glaze.  I'm not a big fan of mustard.  So I substituted it with 2 tablespoons of Jack Daniel's Honey Smokehouse BBQ sauce instead (I'm sure any BBQ would do).  It took an extra 10 minutes or so in my oven for the center to reach 180 degrees.  I served it with homemade mashed potatoes and green beans.   It was fabulous!

This was wonderful.  My husband and I couldn't stay away from it.  He is usually leery of turkey/chicken "meat loaves".  I used turkey instead of chicken and had to add about 6 oz of very lean hamburger meat (I didn't have enough turkey), but other than that, I followed directions exactly.  Bravo!!

This was a great option on traditional meatloaf!  It was perfectly seasoned.  My husband and kids loved it, and I liked the fact that it was something different.  The only change I made to the recipe was to double the sauce/glaze.

I followed the recipe exactly but none of us cared for it at all. My son normally eats any meatloaf I make but he wouldn't touch this. I'll stick with my usual turkeyloaf recipe.

I made this with turkey instead of chicken and thought that it was really good.  Accidentally added too much sage so it had a strong sage flavor.  I thought it tasted like turkey and stuffing and I enjoyed it.  The rest of my family would have had regular meatloaf instead.

Very tasty.  A good bit of chopping, but worth it in the end.  I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting fat free liquid coffeemate for the milk.  I might leave the applesauce out of the glaze next time, the texture of it was a little odd for my tastes, but it is still good!  Even my picky boyfriend liked it.  A keeper!  Made again, used water because I was out of milk.  Couldn't tell the difference.  Actually left the dijon out of the glaze and upped the honey to 3 tsp.  Liked it much better that way.

I didn't use celery and left out the milk, but other than that pretty much followed the recipe. I found it a little sweet as did my husband. Maybe it was the apple sauce. We each used some sort of sauce to tone down sweetness, I used dijon mustard and he used habenero ketchup and he said that made it pretty tasty. I would probably make it again with adjustments because this recipe has potential.

This was fantastic, as far as prep there are many short cuts and believe me I took them!  This was moist and wonderful.  This is an AS IS review.  The only substitution I made was oats for breadcrumbs. The whole family gobbled it up.  We had the babysitter over for dinner that night and she had never had meatloaf and loved it!  Thanks for a very healthy, terrific recipe.  It will be on my meal rotation often, especially now that Gala apples are in season!  Shortcuts I took were using a food processor and bought an onion celery blend in freezer section.

Fantastic, ty so much for posting this excellent recipe. Tastes like chicken with sweet and savory stuffing, all in a moist and easy to cook meal. Prep was a snap, if you're good on the chopping :-) 20 minutes later I was patting it into shape and letting it rest in the fridge for dinner later that day. Paired it with plain old perfect mashed potatoes and corn. Solid 5 starts, enjoy everyone!

This dish was awesome!  My DH and I loved it!  The only change I made was to use 2 lbs of ground chicken cause that is what I had on hand and marjoram instead of sage.  Next time I will double the glaze per my DHs request.  What a great recipe!  Will be making this for a dinner party in the near future.

FABULOUS recipe!  I followed it almost to the letter, but I didn't have poultry seasoning so I used some extra sage, tarragon leaves and a little garlic and it worked fine.  Next time I'm at the store I'll grab poultry seasoning to see if it could possibly be even better with, since this is going to be a regular at our house--my husband LOVED it.  I also used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs, as another reviewer had, but instead of 1/2 c. I ended up using 1 cup because the mixture was way too wet to form into a loaf with just the 1/2 cup.  (Maybe if I'd used bread crumbs the 1/2 cup would've worked better.)  Served it with some smashed potatoes, peas and jellied cranberry sauce...mmmm!  Hubby can't wait to try the leftovers in a sandwich tomorrow.

The prep time likely took longer than 20 minutes but my meatloaf was done cooking in 45 minutes vs 1 hour.  But our oven runs hot so keep an eye on the temperature and don't just go based on the 1 hour time given in the recipe.

The meatloaf was good and we liked the variety of flavors.  No single flavor seemed to win out.  I however, found the dijon mustard slightly over powering in the sauce.  Personal preference.  I saved the recipe and will make it again.  

I made no changes except we did not have poultry spice so I looked up what was in it and made my own.

Fantastic!  This is healthy, full of flavor and the scent of it baking in the oven makes the house smell divine. Used 2 lbs ground chicken 93/7 and added an extra half cup of bread crumbs and omitted the applesauce.  However if I was using the 97/3 then I would probably follow the recipe exactly as it would need more moisture to make up for the reduced fat.  I also used my food processor to chop the veggies and apple and it cut the prep time down considerably.  I did have to bake it longer because I increased the ground chicken, but it stayed very moist - even when reheated in the oven. Also as a personal preference I only used the poultry seasoning and didn't add the sage and it had plenty of flavor for our family.  Thank you - I'll be making this often :)

Great recipe-nice, light twist on regular meatloaf.  I was doing Weight Watchers when I made this and it is low in points while having lots of flavor.

This was so good!  DH wasn't happy until he tasted it - now he wants me to make it again!  I had to sub ground turkey and had to skip the sage (we're out).  I grated 7 baby carrots and that seemed to be fine.  This was not dry or bland, although I've had problems with ground turkey before.  Thanks for a healthy alternative, we'll be making this often!

I used ground turkey. I couldn't find ground chicken. DH and I both really liked it. Great flavor.

The prep time was at least 30 minutes for me, but the end result was really good.  My family turned their noses up with the idea of "chicken loaf" but were pleasantly surprised at the wonderful taste (even the texture was great!)  I made this with mashed sweet potatoes and broccolini.  Will definitely make again.

I followed this pretty close but madea  few adjusstments.  I used olive oil instead of butter, omitted the applesauce in the meat misture as well as the sage.  I used a muffin pan and I made 6 large heaping muffin sized loafs and with the little bit of extra meat I made meatballs (they were very good!).  As for the sauce I used a maple mustard I had bougth (similar to a honey mustard) and instead of honey I used maple syrup.  The meat was great without it but the sauce gave it an extra boost of yumminess!!  I glazed the meat as per direction but I had leftovers which I spooned over the meat on my plate and it was great!  Thank you for this great recipe!!

EDIT:  The meatballs I made with this were great by themselves but are also great with pasta or a thai/plum sauce kind of thing!  Thanks again!

I have made this a couple of times now and making again today for dinner. It is great tasting and a nice change from beef based meatloaf. The flavors blend well and will leave you satisfied at the end of your meal. Since it is just the two of us, the leftovers make great sandwiches for lunches during a busy week. Thanks for sharing!

This was a nice change from typical meatloaves, and the taste really makes me think of fall. However, it's not something I'll make often because I like the "zing" in most loaves. This might be good with some sauteed garlic.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever had!  made it exactly as the recipe stated except I ran out of regular applesauce & used blueberry harvest applesauce in the glaze. Turned out even better than I thought.  It really was moist and tangy.

This is an excellent autumn recipe, and could also be used throughout the year.  My family liked this chicken meatloaf very much. I followed the recipe except I used maple syrup in the glaze because I do not like the taste of honey.

This loaf was so good! I didn't have poultry seasoning so used just tarragon instead. I served it with salad and cranberry sauce, my man thought it was like thanksgiving in mid-april! Divine and a great low-cost everyday meal. Thanks for sharing!I bet ground turkey would also be awesome in this...

I was more than skeptical of a chicken loaf.  I really enjoy your more traditional meatloaf.  But in an effort for my rear not to look like I really enjoy traditional meatloaf I tried this recipe.  I followed it pretty much to the T with the exceptions that I had ground turkey (the really lean kind) on hand and I only had a pound of it.  I adjusted the rest of the amounts accordingly.  I have to say I loved it!  My husband did as well.  This will be a regular for us.

Awesome! Incredibly flavorful, not dry at all. A new family favorite. Made exactly as is but cooked a bit longer on higher temperature before decreasing (45 at 400 then 15 at 375). Seasoning so good I am planning to use this combo in other dishes!

I really liked the loaf.  It had hints of Thanksgiving.  I plan to make some to freeze.  I ground my own chicken breasts.  Next time I will also grind some thighs.  (I normally do not buy the thighs, but think they will add moisture.)  I only gave it 4 stars because my family did not like the sauce.  They would have preferred a "gravy".  A different sauce or gravy would have fared better.

Very different and healthy dish.  It was a little time consuming to put together, but for so many fruit/veggie servings in one dish, it is worth it!  I used gala apples, used 2 carrots, and panko bread crumbs.  I did not have any poultry seasoning or sage so I used thyme and cinnamon, which worked nicely.  Also, I used fresh finely chopped apples instead of the applesauce to save on additional sugar.  A great, fresh dish, nothing like a "regular" meatloaf!

My picky relatives from a foreign land LOVED this.  I was afraid their palate would not take to the sweetness but I couldn't be more wrong!  I used only 1 lb of ground chicken, and replaced the poultry seasoning with cajun.  Oh, and moms of babies out there, I just used a 4 oz. jar of Gerber apples everytime the recipe asked for 1/3 of applesauce, which was the only thing I had on hand ;-)

Though this is quite different from traditional meatloaf (as my fam luvs), I was thrilled that they enjoyed this healthy change-up....Chicken & the fixins... all in one "loaf".... Don't let some of those reviews stop u from trying this dish.....It got so many 5 stars for a reason! Just keep an open mind & hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as we did!

I am sorry to say that I will not be making this recipe again.  Personally I did not mind it, but my husband politely choked it down and let's just say that my young kids forgot to even be polite.  The only change that I made was substituting ground turkey for the chicken.  My family is not used to the texture of ground poultry, so this may have been a factor in the response I received.

Made it again tonight, but I had to make double so there would be leftovers. This time, after I sautéed the onions, carrots and apples, I deglazed the pan with 2 oz. of Jack Daniels Apple. I also add 2 tsp. of Roasted Chicken - Better Than Bouillon. Otherwise, I pretty much follow the recipe as is (though I do use fresh herbs from my garden).

Made it exactly according to the recipe.  It sounded like an odd recipe but everyone in our family called it a "make again".  A nice change from traditional meatloaf.

I did make some changes to this, mostly because I didn't have onion, celery,sage. And I couldn't find my pepper grinder! But, the whole family liked it. it was certainly more moist than my husband's meatloaf, and kiddo asked off she could eat the leftovers today which almost never happens.

We made this last night, although we were very skeptical. We had a back up plan because we were determined that this would be gross. My daughter had come home from work sick and had been sleeping for hours.  I took some to her room and told her she should try to eat, but that was it I didn't see her until I went to bed. We ate it and it was amazing!!! It does have a 'stuffing" sort of taste. 

My son came home at 10:30 at night. I was to bed, and he came to my room to say good night and asked what we'd had for supper. I explained to him what it was and told him there were left overs. He said No thanks it sounds terrible. I convinced him to try it and he came back up to my bedroom and woke me up to ask me "What kind of black magic I used to make those ingredients taste that good when combined.

safe to say it was a hit.

Really moist and tasty.  And a good amount of veggies in a meat dish for me.  I made no changes, just additions that turned out great.  I had a half cup of cranberry sauce and a handful of mushrooms left in my fridge so in they went.  The apples and cranberries, as always, make a good mix.

We really loved this! Even the "beef only please" member of the family.  It was very moist and juicy and much more flavorful than I expected it to be. We all agreed that this would be even more awesome if make as meatballs! Then there would be baked on sauce covering a larger area. Can't wait!!  Thanks much for this recipe.

This is my kids' favorite meatloaf now.  I always use turkey instead of chicken, and sometimes add more applesauce and breadcrumbs to the loaf to make it even a little sweeter.  Perfect on a fall evening or when you just want to feel like it's fall.

I made this last night and it was moist and delicious! I used ground turkey instead ( it was on sale!) and used Panko crumbs as I was out of regular. Honeycrisp apple was great in it. Will be making it again and again.

My husband & I both really liked this. I followed the recipe except that I did add just a tad more seasonings than it called for (but I usually do). It was moist and tasty. Could taste the apple but it was tangy, not too sweet (which I don't like). Excellent, will make this again.

I tasted like holiday stuffing, but had the texture of a meatloaf. We did not care for it. I used chicken, and followed the recipe exactly. The glaze was good, but not enough. It needed some sort of pour over sauce, but I couldn't identify what... maybe chicken gravy, or cranberry sauce?

I have made this several times and it always turns out great. I usually use just one pound of chicken and one table spoon of butter but keep the other ingredients the same. It turns out very moist and has almost a sweet quality to it. It tastes like comfort food but is somewhat healthy!

Yes it does taste quite a bit like dressing.  Very moist.  A nice change.  Next time i would use a tarter apple.

Made this at home and at work and received many compliments. Not only the best meatloaf I've tasted but also the best ground chicken recipe ever. Never have to worry about leftovers, there aren't any! Thanks for a great recipe and we'll be making it often.

Loved this meatloaf recipe!  It was so delicious and I felt good serving it.  Took me awhile to get it made but was definitely worth the time and effort :)  I doubled the glaze recipe - loved the sweet factor.  I will definitely be adding this recipe to my collection!

Delicious!  I had to use a little more breadcrumbs than the recipe said, maybe it was 3/4 cup, but enough to get the loaf into a working consistency, and it was still very moist.  I didn't have dijon mustard on hand so just used regular yellow mustard for the glaze....only a tablespoon.  It was a nice flavor and perfect for Fall!

This is a keeper.  I am doing weight management so I eat a lot of chicken and this recipe was a nice change since I had chicken left from a chili recipe.  I did use egg white and reduced cal. margarine.  
A recipe I will make often.

I really like having a recipe that I do not have to use hamburger. My husband is very picky and he liked it. I could not use onions or celery so I use the powder version and he had no clue. This is for sure a keeper!

Yummy!!  This is absolutely delicious!!  We used ground chicken breast with almost no fat in it, yet this recipe was moist and tender.  It wasn't dry at all.  Highly recommended.

I love this recipe! The first time I made it, I made it exactly like the recipe. It was good, but... I ended up modifying it to taste a little more like a recipe my grandma uses. Everything I kept mostly the same as this recipe, only I use more milk in my own recipe, along with some Worcestershire, garlic, and a few other spices. This recipe is perfect for anyone who needs a healthier version of meatloaf, and it can easily be modified to fit the spices you prefer. LOVE it!

Excellent recipe!  One of the best meatloafs I've ever had and my boyfriend said the same.  5 stars all the way.  The only change I did make was in using ground turkey breast instead of chicken.

Thanks for a great recipe.

Since it’s hard to find 1.5# of ANY ground poultry, I used one pound each of chicken & turkey, (which was on sale). I added 1/2  chopped poblano to the mirepoix for a little punch.  I scaled up the rest proportionally except I added one chopped hard boiled egg to the one beaten one. Misgivings about it being moist enough were unfounded. I was unable to get the glaze to resemble anything of the sort, it just kinda melted into the loaf. Tasted just as advertised, nothing objectionable. To obtain some texture, place slices on a hot skillet to crisp it up. Like regular meatloaf, I thought a schmeer of either mustard or ketchup/mayo  was fine for a condiment. Pickle on the side and it’s a complete lite dish all by itself.

Pleasantly surprised at how good it was! The only changes I made was I added garlic powder, used Italian bread crumbs, substituted brown sugar for the honey, and did not add chopped apple because I didn’t have any!

I make this recipe with ground turkey and instead of applesauce I use my spiced apple butter.  Everyone loves it, as it tastes like turkey and stuffing.

This was unquestionably the best tasting and healthy recipe ever. The apple went so well with the ground chicken. My wife loved it and came back for seconds and thirds.

We liked it.  The only thing I will do differently next time is shred the apples.

Other than lining my pan with parchment paper to make cleanup easier and subbing Quaker Oats for the breadcrumbs, as another reviewer did, to make this gluten free, I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfect and delicious! My son sprinkled a little hot sauce on his and thought that made it even better. The rest of us liked it just as well without the hot sauce.

I've made it twice! It's excellent. Used grainy mustard instead of Dijon and it is excellent

This was delicious.  What a great way to use ground chicken.  I normally use this in place of ground chuck, so a new way to use it was welcome.  I used a little rosemary, thyme and white pepper since I didn't have poultry spice.  I also doubled the sauce and was glad I did because there wasn't a lot despite doubling.  I added little red potatoes to the pan with the loaf.  Had some yellow squash on the side.  We'll have this again, thanks for sharing!

Our new Thanksgiving: Used ground turkey, dry stuffing mix instead of plain bread crumbs and seasoning, skipped the glaze and made turkey gravy with some of the ground turkey. Very moist even without the gravy. Turkey and dressing in every bite.

Very tasty. A great mix of savory and sweet.   In fact my husband said he preferred it to regular meat loaf.   Lots of flavor

Creative twist on the tried and true meatloaf. I made the recipe exactly and it was a hit. The prep was a little more time consuming but I liked the extra servings of fruit and veggies in it. Next time I'll double the batch so there can be leftovers or extra to freeze.

Left the celery out since I'm not partial to it. Tastes delicious! Definitely recommend making extra sauce. Also I used ground turkey instead of chicken and it turned out great =) Will make again.

This was not bad. My picky daughter liked it more than I did. She did suggest a different sauce for the top. 

1 cup Un-sweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 TBS bbq sauce, t TBS Worcestershire sauce, and 1 cove garlic

Also, maybe a little red pepper flake to add some kick.

Wow super healthy and great taste!  Surprising actually!  I did find that my loaf  was a bit on the moist side so added some additional bread crumbs, otherwise, followed to the letter!  Thanks!

I made this the other night, and my skeptical husband was pleasantly surprised.  He thought he wouldn't enjoy it since he loves traditional meatloaf so much but he found it really good.  He really liked the sweet glaze on top.  I will say that the prep to chop all the onions, carrots, celery, and apple took me much longer than the 20 minute prep time it said so if you are a slower chopper like me, just realize that the prep time is more.  I followed the recipe just as it said.  Enjoy, this one is being added to the rotation.

This was an excellent recipe. I have often found meatloaf to either be too dry or to fall apart. The addition of the apples kept this loaf moist, while still sticking together. I didn't have dijon mustard or honey for the topping, so I had to substitute with a dijon mustard recipe and brown sugar. It was still good.

Best meatloaf ever!!!   I added another egg, more breadcrumb and lots of pepper.  It turned out very juicy. My husband and lil boy loved it. Paired nicely with corn.

Loved this recipe when I first read it and decided to read all the reviews and knew a great recipe starts with a good base. To be able to switch up and change ingredients is wonderful. I used 2 lbs ground turkey, added handful of cooked cranberries and used Gluten Free bread cubed. Kept the applesauce topping exactly as in recipe. The house smelled wonderful. My husband found this recipe first and we had fun preparing it. Our next loaf will be with the ground chicken using a great French bistro twist. Thanks for a great recipe.

I enjoyed this, but I was the only one. The family votes when I make a new dish if it is a "make again".  Thumbs down all around, by husband and two boys/teenager.  I liked it but not enough to make again.

I loved this, my husband rated it 3 1/2 stars, I rate it 5!  I think he rated it less because he peeked and saw it was made with ground chicken.  Very flavorful, tasted like dressing because of the seasonings and the onion, celery, and apple.  Delicious!

I  made this for the family tonight. I had most of the ingredients at home,  so the shopping list was a snap.  We loved it,  and the kid is quite the picky eater.  steamed some lightly seasoned Brussels  sprouts and a chicken  fallacies  grain and brown rice pilaf.  We will absolutely make this again!

Wow! I would have deducted a star for presentation had the taste not made up for it. This was delicious. My husband said, "like stuffing, but better". We enjoy sweet tastes, so this was perfect. So kid friendly, too. Made a couple of changes based on what I had and would repeat them again: no celery, used a mild zucchini like squash instead, sweet vidalia onion, ran all veggies through food processor and cooked at the same time in butter for at least 15 minutes (no chunks here), increased sauce and added more honey to taste (my mustard was very strong & my applesauce was unsweetened.) Used only sage, marjoram, thyme, & rosemary, as we are not fond of nutmeg or ginger that is typically in poultry seasoning. Fabulous. Our toddler said "mmmmm" and danced when I brought out the leftovers. Had to add much more breadcrumbs, but my crumbs were very fine. Set oven for 400 and reduced to 380 when I put the loaf in. (Wanted to walk away for more than 1/2 hour). Will do again and again, maybe with turkey and better bread crumbs. Possibly will experiment with individual portions for improved appearance. Thank you so very much. A lean chicken dish filled with veggies that everyone loves? 5 stars plus!

Tastey and sweet; good way to use sage.  I didn't have carrots or applesauce but it was still delicious.  I'll try again w/those in it.
