I have been using Allrecipes for a while but this is the first recipe I have felt compelled to review. While I am reluctant to build up hopes too much, this is simply one of the best things I have ever eaten, maybe the best. It is certainly the best chicken dish I have ever had. It's very easy, except that you have to find out where to score some garam masala. It's not in any grocery stores in my area. I had to find a hidden away Indian store. You can also make your own.

MomZilla! I just finished *french kissing* your recipe! I had previously seasoned my salmon with S&P, onion powder, garlic powder, red pepper flakes and set it aside. I followed your directions except the chicken aspect and simmered the ingredients for 10-15 mins and poured the sauce over the baked salmon. And Oh my! It was copiously delish! I served it with brown rice and watercress salad. I believe this can be used on almost any meat/seafood with success...Thanks Evin!

Sweet & Sour with the flavor of India. This cooks up in no time flat. It is wonderfully zippy and is complimented well with rice. Serve with a salad and plan on making even more next time, because there will be no leftovers tonight!

Wowee zowee! This was amazing!!!  And I just realized I had forgot to add the hot sauce.  Apricot preserves and garam masala sure compliment one another nicely!   Used apple cider vinegar b/c it's my preferred vinegar.  I served this with a potato and pea curry, naan, and a dollop of plain Greek yogurt.  Mmmm.  Will definitely make this one again-and maybe remember the hot sauce.

Evin, you my friend are a star! I had a hard time finding the Garam Marsala but I prevailed at Cost Plus. I have never used it before and boy does it smell wonderful and tastes better! I made this with pork chops. I seasoned them a few hours before i cooked them. I sauteed the onions and set them aside.I added them back to the hot tub with the chops at the end. The sauce is terrific with garlic bread, for the soppin:)!! Thank you soo much Evin! Really YummO

Very easy to make and very good. I didn't have fresh limes, so I mixed a little bit of lime juice in with the butter.  I will probably make this again this week. I would double the amount of chicken next time. There was enough sauce to do that.

I love this dish!  I've made it twice and both times it was amazing.  The only change I made was to use the sugar-free apricot preserves.  I don't even like sugar-free stuff usually but it tastes great in here with less carbs!

Finally made this! Everyone liked it! I used some boneless thighs I had and it was like sweet and sour chicken. Nice citrusy flavor with a little tang. I added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce up for a gravy with rice. Thanks Evin!

fantastic flavor and super easy. I've made this as an 'introductory dish' to indian food to both sides of our family. It goes over really well. It's sweet/sour and spiced. I serve it over rice with fresh limes to squeeze over it and cilantro if I have it. Cider vinegar is a nice substitute for the white vinegar. And just a warning...this recipe is written to make 1/4 lb of chicken per person. That's never enough...especially with a great recipe like this. Try 1/3lb. per person.

Wow! I wanted a quick-to-make dinner and knew this was the recipe to try. In lieu of the hot sauce I minced up @1/2" of habanero and added @1/4 tsp ground habanero (we love our heat!) as well and subbed out the apricot jam for a mango-peach jam that I had on hand. Absolutely delicious the first night and equally so the next day for lunch! I did have to remove the cooked chicken pieces to a bowl and reduce the sauce to my desired thickness and then return the chicken to the sauce. I turned the heat off and covered the skillet and it sat for @1/2 hour until all were ready for dinner, and then reheated quickly. What a great make-ahead entree this will be! Served over white rice and with steamed broccoli.

This did come together very quick and easy.  About ten minutes into making I started cooking some basmatic rice and everything finished at once.  To the onion saute I also added thin slices of green pepper and fresh minced garlic.  I used a lil less garam masala (1 3/4 tsp) and added some curry (1/4 tsp).  I added some diced dried apricots to the preserves since mine was more jelly than fruit.  I also used apple cider vinegar and a splash of balsamic instead of white vinegar.  The only thing I'd change is using less vinegar next time (1-2 Tbsp) because it was a lil too tangy for me.  I had to add more chicken broth and some brown sugar to even things out.  It still came out great and I'm looking forward to making again soon.

Absolutely wonderful!  This recipe is a perfect balance of sweet and savory.  I added sauteed eggplant to the chicken and served with saffron rice.  I highly recommend this!

This was absolutely yummy. Used peach preserves instead of apricot because I really thought they were apricot preserves *doh* but otherwise followed recipe exactly! Thank you very much for the recipe Evin!

If you are reading this review - stop reading and MAKE this recipe!!!!  This was so fabulous that I don't want to share it with anyone. My garam masala is the kind that needs to be toasted in a dry skillet and then crushed, and I think that makes all the difference. I added Hot Volcano sauce as the hot sauce. Don't skip the lime zest, it really adds to the character of this recipe.   To be honest, my dish tasted like General Gao's chicken.   I served it with rice that I made in a steamer with dry onion soup mix. I will be making this recipe again and again and again.!!!!!!!!

This was my first foray into Indian food and it was delicious.I subbed the white vinegar with cider vinegar, the lime zest with lemon zest, and the hot pepper sauce with red pepper. I served it over rice with broccoli on the side and and the whole family enjoyed it.

Happiness is watching your family squabble over cold leftovers! We have a large family so recipe was doubled using half chicken and half extra firm tofu. I seasoned and browned cubed tofu separately then added to sauce with the chicken for the last few minutes. Both turned out perfectly. Thank you!

I used cod instead of chicken, which wasn't that great, but I give this 5 stars because I can just imagine how much better it would be if I did what the recipe says!  The sauce was awesome, and I only used 1 cup of chicken stock.  I baked the fish with 2x the seasonings called for plus 1 tbsp each olive oil, melted butter and lime juice.  I baked at 375 in a foil pack for about 15 minutes, then I transferred the fish to another baking dish, added the sauce and cooked for another 10 minutes.  It was rather well done, but that's how I like it ;)

This was my first shot at an Indian recipe and it turned out great! I served over rice with broccoli on the side. It tastes fantastic and is easy and quick enough to serve on a weeknight. It's perfect as written, no changes necessary. Thanks for the recipe, Evin.

I didn't think this was the best, but it was good and everyone in my family ate it (without complaints so that's a good sign).  I mixed up the recipe for "easy garam masala" on this site to use in this.  Next time I will use a little less vinegar.

Most Fabulous !!!!  I am a HUGE critic of food, I usually have to add my own twist to recipes I find to bring them up to where I think they need to be.....but not with this one !!!  The only change I did was sub Rice Vinegar for White and didn't use the tabasco sauce.  Everyone loved it and I would highly recommend this recipe.  Thanks :)

Super easy, super quick.  Very tasty.  I only used about half a cup of apricot jam - it seemed like it would be too sweet with a whole cup.
Make this again.

This was really good.  I used about 1.5 lbs of chicken since I wanted it to last for two nights and didn't change anything else and it was fantastic.  I forgot the lime and it was still great, but I think it would make this dish even better, adding an extra layer of flavor.  Next time for sure!  

I served it with basmati rice (good with soaking up the extra sauce) and broccoli.  We loved this dish and it was really easy. Will make again for sure.

Made this for dinner; Absolutely beautiful, everyone loved it, even the kids,and it's so rare in my house that we find something that we all enjoy so this will definitely be made again. The only thing I changed was using Kaffir lime leafs,because I had no  fresh lime on hand.

Very tasty and fast!   I've made this a couple of times now and it always disappears at the table.   I added about 1/4 cup of coconut milk and about a teaspoon of cornstarch to it the second time I made it, and it was a little thicker and richer.   Yum!

This was excellent!  I think next time I may add potatoes and carrots to make it a bit more substantial.  I served it over couscous and there were NO LEFTOVERS!  It's that good!

Very tasty. I used a little over half of a cup of the apricot preserves, 3 T vinegar, and about 2/3 c. broth for the sauce. This was plenty for 1.3 lbs of chicken tenders, and reduced the sugar count. Also left out the butter. Will make again!

Yum, yum!  Score, the fellas in the family loved it, too!  I like it because it doesn't use flour to thicken it.  However, it would be a good idea to allow the sauce to reduce by half before adding the chicken back to the pan, and I only used 1 cup of chicken stock.  I used blsl chicken breasts instead of the higher priced tenders.  Will definitely repeat.  Thanks, MomZilla!

I made this with goat meat, so I guess you could say I made the sauce, but it was delicious!  Also, it shows the versatility of the sauce.  I made my own garam masala, and then followed the rest of the recipe pretty closely.  It smelled wonderful and tasted great, and my picky eaters loved it as well!  I will be making this again, and with many different kinds of meat.

We loved this...very easy to make! I made the following few adjustments based on previous reviews: Used 2 T of Apple Cider Vinegar (in place of 1/4 C of white vinegar), added diced celery (sauted with onion), reduced Garam Marsala by 1/4 tsp and added 1/4 tsp yellow sweet curry, and a dash of cayenne pepper.  For color, I added some sliced roasted red & yellow pepper.  Served with Jasmine Rice. Topped with fresh cilantro. Very pretty and so good.  A great dish to serve company - that likes Indian food.  I will make sure to pick up some Naan next time I make this!

This turned out well.  I followed the ingredients pretty closely (except forgot to add the lime zest and butter at the end) and I did add a few other spices (a little bit of cayenne, cumin and curry powder) along with the garam masala.  I followed other suggestions and used mostly cider vinegar with a little bit of balsamic, and didn't find the vinegar flavor/tang overpowering.  I thought the flavors were great, but it was a little bit sweet for me.
I also added in a little bit of cornstarch to help thicken the sauce, since I didn't have time to continue reducing it.  Overall a good recipe, but watch out if you don't like things too sweet.

Delicious and easy to make. The only thing I would recommend is to use only 1/2 cup chicken stock as the sauce was a bit runny and needed to be reduced. Excellent flavor and was enjoyed by all.

This was sooooo good!  I followed the recipe, except I had no red hot, so I used cayenne pepper.  I served it with couscous and broccoli.  I steamed the broccoli in a small pot using the leftover chicken broth.  All in all, this was so good and I would make it again!  next time, I will maybe add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I also forgot the lime zest, but don't think it needed it.

I made this for dinner last night after deciding I wanted something different.  The garam masala made the kitchen smell delicious. My three year old had three servings and both my husband and I have decided this will go in the regular rotation. Next time I make it, I will make sure I have basmati rice on hand since I served it over regular white rice last night and the excess starch seemed to pull the flavor down a little. Nice melding of sweet and savory spice!  I will definitely make this again!

Easy, fast and loved by even picky eaters.   The only thing I changed was adding 2 teaspoons of lime juice versus the zest (I forgot to buy a lime at the store), and used minced garlic. Served over pine nut couscous.    Next time I make this, I think I'll add a little olive oil and marinade the chicken overnight, to let the flavor soak in even more.  A first Indian dish!

Great combination of flavors and it comes together so fast - a perfect quick and easy weeknight meal with a little exotic flair!  Only changes were vegetable stock in place of chicken stock and boneless, skinless chicken thighs (thawed out wrong package) but it worked BEAUTIFULLY!   I served with whole wheat couscous for a quick meal.  This sauce would also pair well with some veggies - I kept thinking that broccoli would go well with this and I think I'll throw some in next time.  My four year old loved this! Thanks for sharing!

It was tasty, but I probably won't make it again.

A caveat:  I did not get much brown bits and the sauce remained thin even with just the original cup of broth, so I added a little cornstarch.

I used low-sugar apricot preserves. The spiciness with the called-for amount of hot sauce is medium-mild. Half is very mild.

Marinating the chicken first or adding some apricot chutney may improve the recipe.

This was so easy to make and delicious; it got rave reviews (and a recipe request) from us and our guests.  I used apple cider vinegar (didn't have white on hand), added a bit of cornstarch (to thicken slightly) and a bag of thawed frozen broccoli for the last couple minutes, and served over basmati rice.  It was great as it was, and I suspect it would still have been great even without my additions.   This one will definitely be made many more times in the future.  Thank you for this great recipe!!

I halved this recipe. I used red onion instead of yellow and chili garlic paste instead of tobasco, because that's what I had on hand. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch so I got the consistency of a sweet and sour sauce. It was tasty and easy!

This was tangy and had an original flavor profile. I used canned apricots that I blended into a sauce so it was as sweet as with the preserves. However I think the preserves really add a sweetness and thickness to the sauce that I might consider next time.

All I can say is WOW!! The taste was awesome.  The ingredients blended perfectly as written.  I added about a 1/2 cup of canned diced mango after turning off the heat. The lime zest really works well with this dish. My liquid was not thickening so I cheated with corn starch. I already had made the garam masala using an Allrecipe version, so prep took minimal time. I will most definitely make this dish again!

This dish was amazing!  My daughter, who doesn't like anything that's not pizza or pasta, even asked me to make it again.  I made it almost exactly as instructed, but I made it even easier by not bothering to remove the chicken and make the sauce separately.  I just browned the chicken and put the stock and apricot preserves right in the same pan.  I always double the recipe so we have left overs.  I also used Earth Balance Vegan Butter (Soy Free) instead of real butter.  Thank you for what has become a staple in our house!

Too sweet, but worth trying again with less honey and unsweetened preserves.

Out of apricot preserves? Use peach instead, it's just as yummy.

This dish was good with the following changes.  I added red and green bell peppers along with the onions.  I didn't have any tabasco sauce, so instead I used a whole scotch bonnet seasoning pepper, which flavored the dish very nicely without making it peppery.  I used white wine in place of chicken stock, because that was all I had on hand.  It was served with white rice and a fresh kale salad.  It was delicious, and I will make it again.

I've made this many times, and want to share a few tips with people who want less sugar in their diet. I for one can't handle large amounts of it at all. I'm happy to say this recipe works perfectly with no-sugar-added apricot preserves or with Splenda-sweetened preserves. I now cook it always with the Splenda apricot preserves, which I find easily online. 

If you do this, the sauce does not thicken up as much as something with real sugar, so just thicken with 1 T of corn starch. Works great. I also stir in 1 teaspoon of Splenda Brown Sugar blend at the same time as the preserves, to enhance the sweetness while still keeping the sugar levels extremely low. It is really delicious and my  husband can't tell it's no made with real sugar. 

The final result is sweet and tangy, just as it should be. I also find that I can reduce the butter to just 1 teaspoon and it still serves the purpose of mellowing the flavors. This makes it much healthier.

I once used grated lemon peel instead of lime, because I had no lime, and I can tell you that lime is better. 

Do use closer to 2 lbs of chicken if you want 4 servings. There is a lot of sauce and the 1 lb of chicken is not enough at all for one serving. My husband and I use 2 lbs of chicken, eat two portions for dinner and the remaining two portions for lunch the next day. It reheats beautifully. 

I make this once a week.

4 stars since I tweaked it a bit.  Used fresh garlic instead of powder and halved the hot sauce.  Also used apple cider vinegar.  Otherwise made as directed.  Very, very good result.  Perfect balance of sweet and sour.  Next time I'll add some curry powder and ground cumin for more of what (I think) would be a taste if India.  Served with basmati rice and steamed zukes.

Pretty tasty, not very Indian flavored though.  Seems like a very Americanized recipe.

This is delicious. I usually don't add the full 1 cup of stock at first. Also, I add a bit of corn starch since I prefer a slightly thicker sauce. We serve this with na'an bread (found at our grocery store) and rice.

We have a local Indian restaurant that sells the Garam Masala, and its much less expensive than some of our specialty food stores.

Very easy to make.  My husband loved it, but my son thought it was a bit too sweet.  Maybe my preserves are sweeter than most.  Next time I will cut on the preserves or maybe increase the vinegar. I could see making this with ground chicken and all the spices in a cocktail chicken ball and serving with the sauce as an appetizer.  Not sure if I would put the onion in the sauce or the chickenball .Thanks for sharing.

Too sweet as is.  Use all fruit and a little honey instead of preserves.

This is super tasty.  I have been wanting to get Garam Marsala for a while, so I made a special trip to the Indian market to get it.  Super easy and super good.  My husband said I could double the recipe next time.  One pound was not enough for the 3 of us.  Used 3/4 cup of the apricot preserves and 1 cup of chicken broth for one pound and it was sweet enough for us.  Will make over and over again!  Thanks!

Okay...WOW!   This recipe is so good!   I did use sugar free apricot preserves, but it is PLENTY sweet!    I also followed some of the reviewer's suggestions for adding in some extra veggies and using Apple Cider Vinegar in place of the white.    At the VERY END, I tossed in some frozen carrots and peas just to bump up the veggies.   This recipe is DA BOMB!!!!! 

ALERT!!!!   My husband just got up for SECONDS!    This is a KEEPER! ;-)

Very flavorful not to mention quick and simple to put together.  Thought I had some chicken strips in freezer and pulled them out, turned out to be boneless thighs!  Cut it all up and tasted wonderful!!!  Followed all else in Evin's recipe except used  sugarless apricot preserves (reducing to 1/2 cup).  Will be using this quite a bit as we love the Indian flavors and spice.  Thanks Evin!!!

flavorful, great spices, but cloyingly sweet, even using only half the recommended preserves.

Great and easy!  I cubed the chicken and shook it in a bag with 1/3c flour and TB of curry before browning in oil.

I served this over rice with green beans on the side. And I also added some frozen peas into the sauce. It's delicious. :)

Loved this recipe!  My two-year-old even liked it and kept asking for more!  I did not use the hot sauce or lime zest because I didn't have them, and it still turned out perfect.  Definitely a keeper!

Why did I wait so long to make this?  This is fantastic and came together in about 15 minutes.  The flavor is so fresh, light, spicy, sweet and savory with minimal ingredients and effort.  I served it on top of couscous (unflavored as this sauce provides all the flavor you need) with a fruit salad as a side.  I garnished with a little parsley and WOW!  I actually caught myself licking the plate.  I honestly can't wait to attack the leftovers.  The sauce is very accommodating, so next time I'll experiment with adding some veggies and serve it with some naan.  Thanks Evin!

Very good and not hard at all to make. The taste was not too strong and the whole family ate it up. I served this with a middle eastern rice recipe and the meal was a hit. Thanks.
