Beautiful looking salad and everyone LOVED it! I used a mix of regular basil and purple basil from my garden. The dressing ratio is spot on creating a perfect blend of flavors...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. The light dressing and onion didnâ€™t hijack the delicate flavor of the mozzarella. I used fresh mozzarella balls. It certainly makes a beautiful presentation. Thank you, Pat, for another great recipe.

Great Caprese salad. I did leave off the onion. Just a personal preference. A lot of flexibility w presentation.

The dressing is excellent!  I am a big fan of balsamic vinegar so I was surprised to like this so much but it was such a light, flavorful dressing that it allows the Veggies flavors to pop.  Note: You can adjust the tomatoes, cheese, and onion to your liking (mozz balls or cubed and cherry or grape tomatoes, etc)

I have made this several times now and I always get great compliments on this recipe. The first few times I did not have fresh basil so I mixed  ground basil up with the olive oil and poured it over everything. It's works great both ways.

I made this following the recipe except that I did it on individual tomato slices. It had an amazing burst of flavor with tomatoes, basil and green onions straight from the garden. Although it was simple it looked very fancy and we loved it!
