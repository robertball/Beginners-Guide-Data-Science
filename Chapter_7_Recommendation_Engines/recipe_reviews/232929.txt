REALLY GOOD  Nice Saturday lunch. I used a flat bread base, hummus , pesto, alfredo, then no artichoke hearts, small mushroom pieces ,chicken,
halved olives and cherry tomatoes. All the cheese, then parmesan last couple minutes. Very good. Froze one.
Next time I am going to be prepared with a good Greek Salad.

I used Purdue breaded chicken (precooked), sun dried tomato hummus with artichoke, basil Alfredo sauce recipes (both from allrecipes.com) and Italian blend cheese. Altogether (except for earlier recipe preps), I saved a lot of time. I also used precut/washed baby bello mushrooms and skipped the olive oil altogether. I did use feta and put all on small pitas. Sooooo gooood!

Made as written, but used diced cooked chicken breast and it was wonderful.  Very rich and filling.

The only changes made were I used a 12" thin pizza crust, and no mushrooms, because my husband doesn't like them.
We loved it. he ate 5 slices , I had to fight to get 3.
I was worried about layering all the hummus, pesto and alfredo, but found very thin layers worked well. will make again
