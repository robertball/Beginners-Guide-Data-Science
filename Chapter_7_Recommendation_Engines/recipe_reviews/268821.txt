This was an unusual pie and had mixed reviews in my house. It has a very strong almond flavor, so, if you aren't a fan of almond I wouldn't recommend trying this recipe.  I was concerned because there were little bits of marzipan that didn't mix completely with the butter, but, once cooked the small pieces had melted and incorporated with the filling.  I personally wasn't crazy about the texture of the cooked pears and thought the pie was too sweet.  My husband however loved the pie.  I think I might like it better with a cherry filling instead of pear.  We did try the pie room temperature and cold after refrigerating and both agreed we liked the pie better cold.
