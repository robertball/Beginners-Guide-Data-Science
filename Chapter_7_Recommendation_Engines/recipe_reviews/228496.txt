I used fresh tangerines. It was good, but I feel like its missing something to take it from 4 stars to 5. We get a lot of tangerines from the CSA we belong to, and I will definitely make this again. If I figure out the magic missing ingredient, I'll update my post.

Very nice combination of flavors but I think I would prefer fresh mandarins or oranges and just use the natural juice of the mandarins to coat the avocado mixture.
