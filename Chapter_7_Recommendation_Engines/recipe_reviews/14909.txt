Great recipe, very tasty! One point - finding that a lower temperature over a longer period works better, as they're burning a bit while the chestnuts are still hard in the centre at such a high temp.

I make  this all the time with just a little change. I find the brown sugar too sweet. So I just soak the chestnuts in the soy sauce and then wrap and cook. I lower the temperature to 375 and cook a little longer approx. 25 min. I find with the lower temperature the waterchestnut is cooked better.

I was a bit disapointed.  It was challenging to assemble - the chestnuts didn't hold together to well.  And, it was a bit too salty for my taste.

Didn't try it, because I was looking for actual chestnut recipe, and this seems to be WATER chestnuts. I rated 4 because that is currently the average rating and I didn't want to impact scoring. Can recipe title be corrected? If I find myself with spare water chestnuts, i will come back to it though. I'm just adding this 'review' so no one else goes through reading all reviews before figuring out it's ONLY with water chestnuts. No one seems to have tried with real chestnuts.

Liked these, but they really MUST be eaten right away or the chestnuts get too mealy.

This is amazing with a little tweaking. Use low sodium soy sauce and par cook the bacon before you wrap. This is a go to recipe for a last minute party fare.

This is a great recipe, known as Rumaki.  I've made this before and gotten rave reviews.

Try wrapping the bacon and chestnuts, baking, draining and then dip in barbeque sauce. Less greasy!

This brought back so many memories of prepping these, bringing them to appetizers table an just observing folks. Predominantly men love these Rumaki and women hear chicken livers and make a face.  Even I can only eat 2 or 3 since they are so rich. I am a purest and do not add any sauces.  NO Sugar at all.

Tasty, but I made the mistake of baking these on foil rather than a rack. After 10 mins the side on foil was charred; next time will use a rack. And please fix name — it’s water chestnuts not the tree chestnuts!

I wasn't sure if this recipe called for chestnuts or water chestnuts. I could not find canned chestnuts anywhere, so my hubby bought some and roasted them.  I marinated them in soy sauce, wrapped them in bacon, baked them at 350 for 30 minutes and slathered them in this sauce: 1/4 cup each, chilli sauce, mayo, and brown sugar. 
I baked them for another half hour. They are amazing, but then I think you could wrap just about anything edible in bacon and add this sauce and it would be amazing. I tried it with whole canned water chestnuts also, but left out the soy sauce marinade.  They maintained their crunch. Both tasted great.

We use this recipe repeatedly at holiday gatherings. Every year there is a tweak to the recipe depending on who makes it. Most omit the sugar because we have diabetics in the family. We also add our favorite BBQ sauce and place them in the crock pot to stay warm. Delicious!
