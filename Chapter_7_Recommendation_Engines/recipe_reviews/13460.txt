I've been making this casserole for about 30 years now, but instead of precooking the rice, I put the minute rice and an equal amount of water into the mix before baking at 350 for an hour.  I also use more onion, but adding minute rice and water eliminates a step, some time, and an extra saucepan.

Thanks, Helen. I used to have this recipe, but lost it. I have been looking for it and your's is the closest I have seen! This recipe is great - I use a small block of velveeta cheese instead of the processed spread. I melt the velveeta with a couple of tablespoons of milk in the microwave. Everyone loves it!

GREAT!!! I made the following changes: Used a cup and a half of leftover cooked rice insted of Minute rice, seasoned the broccoli with season salt and butter while cooking, used shredded cheese insted of "processed cheese sauce" and topped with bread crumbs and sharp chedder cheese. Made for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit with everyone!!! This one is a keeper

This is another EASY and GREAT tasting dish I picked off of the website to make on Thanksgiving Day. It was the creamiest and perfect! Not too stiff, not too dry or soupy! So easy to make! I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup instead! But it was still the best tasting broccoli and rice casserole that I've tried yet! No need to look any further! This one is a winner!

It was easy to make the rice didn't have no flavor, so next time instead of water I'll use chicken broth to cook the rice, but everything else tasted good.  I'll make it again.

OOps... I submitted my first review from 5 years ago!  Just made this again and had some thoughts. First of all, it is so irritating to read a bad review when the reviewer changed the recipe. You have to judge it as submitted!  Anyway, in the quest to always make things easier, I tried the single bowl approach for this recipe. I used minute rice, a can of chicken broth and two more cans of water. Also didn't cook the broccoli. Everything else as stated except for Velveta. If you try this, you will need to melt the "cheese" because the rest of the mixture is very cold and it will not blend right. I melted some and cubed some more and it had the cheesey nugget effect. Oh, also used minced onions.  You will need to cook it for at least an hour. Watch for the cheese to brown around the edges of the pan. If you can make the day before and refrigerate, all the better in making the rice absorb the liquid. How ever you alter it, this is a wonderful easy recipe!  Thanks to the submitter!!!

A good, basic broccoli cheese casserole. Added a big heap of fresh garlic. Only had fresh broccoli so I steamed that first. Thanks!

I made this for my boyfriend and I one evening.  It was FABULOUS.  Easy and delicious.  I used fried onion rings as a topping (I believe they are made by French's...).  Quite tasty.

Listen, five stars all the way!  I don't know why this recipe would even begin to receive less than that!  My family requests this delicious dish every gathering, and I love to impress guests with its overwhelming creaminess.  Thanks, Helen, for sharing this hidden treasure.  I love it and will never need another Broccoli Casserole again!

This was pretty good. I did have to make some changes. I only had cream of chicken so I used that and I did not have any processed cheese. Honestly I'm not even sure what that would be...cheese whiz maybe? So what I did was substitute a package of cheddar cheese. Because cheddar cheese doesn't melt well I had to make it into a cheese sauce with a little bit of butter and flour and milk.  It worked pretty well although a little on the dry side, probably just have to add a little extra milk next time. Overall great recipe, I will definitely make it again.

Loved this recipe, but had some trouble making the cheese melt evenly.  The second time I made it I substituted Campbell's cheddar cheese soup for the processed cheese.  It blended evenly and was so tasty!  I also increased the rice by one cup.  Sprinkled the top with shredded mild cheddar.  Was a big hit at Thanksgiving.

I'm sorry to say this recipe was not a hit at our dinner table.   I found it to be too mushy (rice & broccoli) ... and didn't care for the cheez whiz flavor.... unlike other recipes we've tried from allrecipes, this one was a disappointment.

This was great!  I was a bit nervous as my family and I are not big on Velveeta since it can be so rich.  I used 2% and used no salt.  I also cooked the rice in chicken broth and used 1 can of cream of chicken as suggested by other reviews. Everyone in the family really liked this dish!  I will certainly make it again!

We have been making this for as long as I can remember! This rice is cheesy, creamy goodness and always a hit wherever I take it. My recipe is exactly the same as this one and in my opinion you can never go wrong with this dish! :)

This was so delicious and just as good the next day!  I cut the recipe in half, used fresh steamed broccoli, cooked the rice in chicken broth, and used Velveeta in place of the cheese sauce as others suggested.  I will be making this again!

I used to have a recipe similar to this, but I lost it and this is the closest thing I can find. This was a big hit at our thanksgiving potluck (I didnt even have leftovers to bring home). I used whole grain rice, and one can cream of chicken/one can cream of mushroom (just because thats what I had). Next time I think I will add either more broccoli, or some cauliflower, because it was just a little too saucy for my taste. Thanks for a good recipe.

I simply love this recipe.Seems im not the only one who tweeked with  chicken broth instead of water when making the rice and I used velveeta inplace of the cheese sauce. The major taste changer though, I used French's Fried onions instead of a saulted onion. Very good recipe. Never any leftovers!

I loved this recipe. It is almost a meal in its self. When I prepared my menu for the week though I thought I had cream of mushroom soup. I did not ( I live far outside of town and cannot just pop into the grocery store) I used cream of chicken and cream of potatoe. Awesome I will definately make again and again! Very FILLING !

This is a great Broccoli and Rice Casserole.  To make it the PERFECT Broccoli and Rice Casserole - sprinkly some seasoned bread crumbs on the top.  It makes a yummy crust!

This was really good.  I have another recipe I use, but it has mayo and I like that this one didn't.  It seemed less soupy.  Plus I like the addition of rice.  Great recipe!  I used a can of cream of mushroom and cream of broccoli.

This was fantastic.  I used fresh steamed broccoli, basmati rice and a combination of Cheez Whiz and cream cheese, and one mushroom soup and one cream of celery soup (all I had in the house, otherwise I'd have followed it to the letter!).  So tasty.  I don't even like broccoli, and I'm not a big fan of rice, either.  I also sprinkled some corn flake crumbs on top for a little crunch, and it was just heaven.  I'll make this one again and again.

It was so yummy. I took thhe advice of another person and used broth to cook the rice and the suggestion to use velvetta made it so much better. Also, I sauteed red onion and added minced garlic for extra flavor. I re-heated some later on that night and it was still awesome.

This was a good basic recipe to start from.  I modified it to my personal tastes and from what I remember of the one mom made when I was a kid.  I added shredded chicken which I cooked in just a bit of ev olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper.  I sauteed the onions in buter and garlic and threw in a chopped up a fresh jalapeno(half seeded, half not) for a bit of kick.  After the onion mix was ready I added the broccoli and then the soup to the pan, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can of cream of chicken...I also added about 1/2 cup of sour cream.  when this was warm I added the cheese, I used shredded sharp cheddar.  When everything was melded together on the stovetop I poured over the chicken/rice combo already in the pan and mixed it all together.  Was very tasty...will make again.

Great recipe--as usual, I didn't have all the ingredients, so I substituted 1 1/2 cups prepared pepperidge farm stuffing mix for one cup of the rice, and I used grated xtra sharp cheddar (1/2-3/4 cup) along with more cream of mushroom soup (and one time I used half-n-half)as a substitue for the cheese soup.  I love recipes that seem to turn out great no matter what you do to them (as long as you keep the proportions correct!).  Thank you!

I made this for a dinner at work and everyone loved it. I changed it up a bit, I used Cream of Broccoli soup and velveta cheese, and I didn't put any onions in it. This was great and I'll make it again.

This was good but not great. I used Velveeta Cheese instead of a jar of cheese. I like the taste of Velveeta better but I wish I would have just used the jar of Cheese. I will use it next time I make this.

I'm always looking for ways to get my husband to eat vegetables. This one is bound to become on of our favorites! I halved the recipe for just the 2 of us. I used fresh broccoli, steaming it first, and I used fresh grated cheese instead of a jar or Velveeta. I also added fresh garlic in with the sauteed onions, and topped the whole thing off with a layer of bread crumbs. SO good!! Leftovers microwaved up nicely the next day. Love it.

I used velveeta cheese (approx 8ounces) and milk instead of the jar of processed cheese.  The velveeta was reduced fat and the milk was skim.  I chopped the velveeta into one inch cubes and spread them out in the casserole, then stirred it twice while baking.  I also added crushed ritz crackers on top about five minutes before it was finished.  It was delicious and I got numerous compliments on it.  I have made it for three Thanksgiving dinners this week.

This was one of those dishes that I liked more and more as I ate it. I'd never eaten a broccoli casserole before, and the first few bites were a bit odd... but by the fifth bite, I thought it was really tasty. I didn't have cream of mushroom, so I used cream of chicken. I used real cheese instead of processed cheese sauce. I cooked the rice in chicken broth instead of water. It was a nice side dish. Next time, maybe I'll try adding shredded chicken to it to make it a meal.

This was the first casserole that I made and I loved it. I have made it 3 times total and took it to our Thanksgiving last year. Everyone wanted this recipie. My cousin said I hate broccoli and this is very good. She now makes it too. I followed the recipie as is. The sauteed onions give the casserole and wonderful flavor. I will be making it this weekend for friends and it is now a staple in my house.

This was such a great way to let my kids eat their veggies.  They love broccoli and rice.  I have now made this 2 times and will continue.  It was a HUGE family hit at our dinner table and I made this special for a church potluck dish!  Everyone who had some was raving praises!Thanks for this easy and yummy recipe!

I have had this recipe for years, try using jalepeno cheese whiz or half jalpeno and half regular if you don't like it too spicy.  it makes it a little less bland for those who think it needs a punch.  I also use about a cup of chopped celery sauted with the onions,gives it a nice texture.

This recipe was terrific!  I changed it up a little but not much.  I added some minced garlic when I sauted the onions and put in sharp cheddar cheese instead of the jar cheese also for a topping I added a layer of more shredded cheese and then mixed corn flakes with melted butter and put that atop of the cheese....It was sooooo tasty...I will definetly use this recipe again and again and again.  
Thanks Helen!

This dish is yummy good!  I can't seem to get enough - I'll eat leftovers for breakfast!  My Family loves it too - especially the kids.  It takes no time at all to put it together! A definite crowd pleaser!!

So, so good!!  I didn't cook the rice ahead of time; I just threw it in with everything else, along with a cup of water and a cup of broth.  Also, I nuked the onions and butter instead of sautéing them.  My husband, who hates broccoli cheese casserole LOVES this, and I think it's my favorite version ever, too.  I recommend using broccoli florets instead of cut broccoli; just make sure to chop them into small pieces.

This was neither a hit nor a miss at my house. The taste was okay but I was not a fan of the consistency.  It seemed a little mushy, possibly due to the instant rice. If I make this again I'll use a firmer, regular rice - and possibly broccoli florets instead of the chopped broccoli.

This is fantastic, everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently was to use the broccoli steamers, b/c it cuts down dishes and cook time and tastes great, and I used velvetta cheese, also, I crushed ritz crackers and mixed with melted butter and used as a topping. Wonderful!

This is a great Broccoli Casserole. I made it for the Holidays and it was a big hit. I used 1 can mushroom soup and 1 can cream of chicken soup, great balance. I found Velvetta cheese made it very creamy with just a 1/4 cup of milk to smooth it out, melted in microwave.

I have made this several times over the holiday now and I get so many rave reviews. Everyone loves it. I like other users make cheese sauce using Velveeta and milk! Awesome! Also, I leave out the onion and just use powdered.

Crowd (& kid) pleaser!  When preparing my rice, I used low-sodium chicken bouillon in my hot water for added flavor.  I actually have a broccoli-loving crowd so I added extra broccoli.

Everyone loved it!

Very good. Used a different cream of soup as I didn't have the one the recipe suggested. Also didn't use the can of cheese but real cheese instead. Will make again.

I halved the recipe because it's just for 2 of us.  I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of celery.  I also didn't add the onion because I am pregnant and have an aversion to it right now.  I turned out really great!!  It was a tad salty, but really good!!

This recipe is great! I use small chunks of Velveeta cheese instead of the cheese sauce. Just be sure to stir the casserole as the cheese melts.

I didn't have broccoli so I substituted frozen french cut green beads and I added a some garlic salt and bread crumbs on top and it turned out good.  I will make this again with broccoli and I am sure this will be much better.

First time making broccoli rice casserole. I used velveeta cheese but don't think I used enough. I was afraid to would be too cheesy and ended up not being enough. Other than that, it was great. will make again

This was really good.  I am not a big broccoli lover, but my husband is.  This is a great meal for both because I still had something to eat other than the broccoli and he had lots of broccoli to eat!

Good recipe!  I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1/2 can cream of mushroom instead (I hate mushrooms) and it came out great.  I also added onion salt, garlic powder, and sprinkled the top with peprika before cooking.

I halved this to feed 4 adults.  It was tasty, really a lot of sauce. I think I will use florets instead of chopped broccoli next time, the chopped broccoli just did not seem substantial enough for the abundance of sauce (soup and cheese.)  I also think this might have been good with a cracker crust or cheddar french fried onions or something to give it a little cruch and/or texture.  But it was a good base and I will make it again and work with it.  The family liked it, even the anit-veggie husband.

Absolutely delicious, hot or cold (leftovers).  I made this for Thanksgiving last year and will be making it again for Easter this year.  Cooked the rice in vegetable broth and substituted Velveeta Light. -- it was a hit!  Thank you for this recipe!

Made this for a pot luck.  Was a big hit with adults and kids.  I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of celery.  I also used velveeta instead of cheese spread, I think the flavor is much better with the velveta.  Wasn't as good the next day, rice got a little mushy.  I will make again.

Bland. Used shredded mild cheddar cheese and added some garlic and beaten egg to bind the ingredients. Won't be seeking this one out again. I will stick with my usual recipe. Thanks anyway.

This is the standard kid's recipe, which is exactly what I needed, but not something I would ever recommend.  It's bland, it's easy, and the "cheese product" is the only flavor really distinguishable.  You could use any processed, easily-melted cheese.  It's a great way, according to my cousin, to sneak vegetables into her four-year-old!

For adults, there are several nice variations here on this site that actually have flavor and texture.  The one I've tried has an almond crust and a mixture of white cheeses.  I might consider baking it in a mold next time, for presentation's sake.

This recipe is very good and easy to make.  I twicked it a little by adding white shredded chicken.

I used cream of celery soup instead of mushroom soup because my hubby hates mushrooms.  It was very good.  It makes a lot - I had 7 people eating off of it and still had leftovers.

We found this to be distinctly mediocre.  Tasted overwhelmingly like processed cheese.  We've had quite a few different broccoli rice casseroles, and this one my husband called "blah" compared to some of the others.  It was respectable, but not something I'd really look forward to eating again.

The kids loved this.  A way to get their veggies!!!  I used Velveeta instead of jarred (Chez Whiz) since that's what I had around. It seemed to work fine.

I also used shredded cheddar instead of sauce, and I topped with crushed wheat Ritz with butter for the crispy effect. I cooked everything separately as this recipe instructs, but would be interested in trying the one bowl method mentioned in the other reviews. As I did it, it turned out great! I will be making it again!

I used 16 0z of shredded cheddar cheese.  It turned out great and I got great feedback on it.  I will make it again. I am definitly not a skilled cook. This was simple enough for even an unskilled cook like me to make something edible that did not come from the microwave Lol.

This was a hit with my husband and I (as well as our sensitive stomachs). I sauteed the onion in vegetable stock instead of butter & mixed that well with the cooked rice to add flavor to the rice. I substituted 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar instead of the cheese sauce (3/4 of it mixed in and 1/4 spread on top) and used about a teaspoon of garlic pepper instead of the salt & pepper. Made this way it had a mildly complex, savory flavor and was very satisfying. This makes a lot, which is wonderful, so be sure to use your largest casserole dish. 30 minutes in the oven at 350F was perfect. I added it to my recipe book and will be making it again.

The taste was good but it was mushy.  I used regular long grain rice instead of instant rice.

This is seriously so, so good. The only things I changed, per some other people's suggestions,  was I made the rice in chicken broth, and used 1 can of cream of mushroom, and 1 can of cream of chicken, and then velveeta for the cheese. I got SO many compliments on this dish, and a ton of family asking for the recipe. A definite keeper!

I made this for a potluck recently; it was great. The only alterations I made was to use Mahatma brand yellow rice instead of instant rice and cream of celery and cream of chicken in place of the cream of mushroom soup. This was purely a matter of taste. I don't care for mushrooms. I found no need for additional salt or pepper.

This was quick and simple to assemble - I did NOT pre-cook the rice, but instead added it dry with an equal portion of water to the entire mixture, and allowed it to cook to completion in the oven.  I forgot to add salt & pepper, but I'm glad I did, because it had plenty of flavor.

Omg!!! So yummy, both of my boys (boyfriend and roomate) loved it!!!! I didn't use the cheese out of the can, just regular sharp shredded cheese and I added tons of boccoli to give it a great texture. 

 Great recipe! Thanks

I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken.  Turned out amazing!  Added 1/4 cup of butter and a sleeve of Ritz cracker crumbles for the top, with some shredded sharp cheddar cheese, turned out to be a big hit at Thanksgiving.  Taste just like O'Charley's version, which I love!
