I just sautéd the string beans and fresh garlic in olive oil. When almost done to my liking, I removed them to bowl, sautéd the bacon until crispy and removed to paper towel. I then put string beans back in skillet, added the crisped bacon bits and topped w fresh extra sharp cheddar. A twist of the pepper mill and I’m all set for a tasty light supper!

I made these beans and it was nice, but I didn't have to put in oven due to the heat from the beans was enough to melt the cheese and was very tasty to eat.

It was a good alternative to the old green bean casserole but I wish I had just steamed the beans instead of frying.
