I love shrimp fried rice and this is a quick and easy recipe to make - if you make the rice the night ahead!  I've never had a problem with soggy rice this way - cold rice works the best.

I found the original recipe too salty, so I cut the salt in half and use only 1 1/2 tablespoons of soy sauce.  Everyone can always add more later to taste.  Add the bean sprouts in step 3 as others have suggested.

I also agree that the dish is better if the eggs are(partially) precooked. Here's what I do: When it comes time to add the eggs, move the rice/shrimp to the sides of your wok/skillet (be sure to use a large one) making a well in the middle.  Pour in the eggs w/ salt and pepper, scramble after they've begun to set, and then mix with the rice/shrimp.  This saves messing up another pan!  (One trick I retained from another, not so good, fried rice recipe.)

If you want to use small shrimp, add it later to avoid overcooking.  Sometimes I substitute brown rice for white.

Absolutely delicious and easy to prepare.  Very flavorful!!  The only thing I would do different is add more shrimp and use less soy sauce...it was a little salty for my taste.

This shrimp fried rice recipe was very simple to follow, a breeze to make, and makes a very flavorful dish!  The recipe's simple nature allows the cook the flexibility of adding other ingredients if they so desire. In my batch of rice, 
I added peas, extra bean sprouts, and cooked the eggs prior to adding them to the rice.  With my next batch I will saute my (yellow) onions with the uncooked rice first prior to adding the water.   This will add flavor to
the rice itself, and make the rice fluffier.  Overall, it's a real crowd pleaser, and maintains its flavor the next day!  Try it!

I made this last night and while it was good, it did not blow me away. I will make it again, but I think I will buy a wok first. When you make this, if you are using a pan used a really really large one!!!!. I did followed the recipe, but added a little 5 spice powder at the end of cooking for more flavor, also omit the extra salt, soy sauce is salty enough. Another tip (do not over cook your shrimp as you will be adding to the pan which will cook more). My shrimp came out wonderful!!!..Like everyone else I added the bean sprouts in step 3... PS USE ONLY REQUIRED AMOUNT OF SESAME OIL VERY STRONG FLAVOR. UPDATE!!!! I HAVE SINCE PURCHASE A WOK AND I TRIED THIS RECIPE AGAIN, IT WAS GREAT THIS TIME I USED A NEW TIRCK FOR THE RICE, OTHERS STATED RICE WAS SOGGY, IT'S TO MUCH TO COOK THE RICE THE NIGHT BEFORE ECT ECT. WELL MY TRICK IS TO BUY READY MADE RICE. I USED UNCLE BENS GARDEN HARVEST, IT'S READY TO USE ANY TIME FROM PACKAGE TO WOK OR PAN, AND IT ALREADY HAS PEAS IN THE RICE. AND NOW HAVING A WOK HAS MADE THIS DISH SO MUCH EASIER. MY RATING IS GOING UP FROM 4*** TO 5****

WOW! What a busy week! I have just now had time to get to the computer! Well, this recipe made for an easy lunch...it took me apprx 20 minutes from start to finish and it was sooo good! In addition to the bean sprouts (a MUST have), I added 1 cup chopped broccoli and 1/2 cup fresh sliced mushrooms and sauted them with the onions.  I also used 2 cups rice and reduced the soy sauce to 2 TBLS. Finally, I scrambled the eggs in a seperate pan.  VERY delicious! This will be my shrimp fried rice recipe from here on out! Thank you, thank you Amy!!

Really good.  I would NOT recommend adding additional salt.  Soy sauce is salty enough.  I added mushrooms and red peppers when I added the shrimp.  When adding the egg, I recommend making a well in the center of the rice so the egg has a chance to scramble before it gets blended with the rest of the ingredients.

I made this recipe last night for dinner. I had shrimp thawing and couldn't decide what to make so I came to the only place for recipes...HERE. This recipe was so fast and easy. The only reason I gave it four stars was most likely my error. I used minute rice and it just seemed to me that the rice lost all it's shape and body. It became a little bit of a soft mess. Otherwise it was a great recipe. I will definately try this again...just with different rice.

Really no complaints here. The recipe was very excellent. I did double the recipe because of my family size and used baby shrimp because that's what I had on hand.  I did do something different in step 4 just because it was how I was taught, and from prior experience. The directions state "mix in green onions, eggs, salt, pepper, soy sauce and sesame oil." Well when ever I've mixed eggs right in, the eggs get so binding that it looks like little beads or almost invisible like and can't tell that the eggs are even present and no chunks that you normally see in resturants that serve fried rice. I took a separate pan with a little bit of butter melted to coat the pan with and soft scrambled the eggs, mid way through the cooking process of the eggs I added the green onions, then immediately added to the rice mixture then added the rest of the ingredients. Mixed well and served. This made for plump little chunks of eggs and was just perfect. My family enjoyed throughly and will make again.

The recipe is fine, although after trying it essentially as written, I would recommend several changes: 
1. use raw shrimp and do not cook it for the full 7 minutes-especially not if the shrimp were already cooked! About the only thing you can do wrong with shrimp is cook it too long, making it mealy.  Once it loses its translucence, it is done; anything beyond that makes the texture unpleasant. The easy rule of thumb is if you have cooked it long enough to cook the eggs, the shrimp is certainly done.  
2. Unless you don't like sesame oil, 1/4 t. is not really enough.  
3. The soy sauce adds plenty of salt; I can't imagine adding more (my only change from the recipe was to omit the extra salt).

DELICIOUS! This tasted just like the shrimp fried rice that i used to eat as a teenager from my favorite chinese restaurant! I have moved from my home town since then and i simply cannot find any shrimp fried rice that tastes the same. Well, this is it! I cooked the rice a day ahead of time and omitted the eggs and it came out perfect!

Didn't care for this too much. I would suggest using raw shrimp instead of cooked, they were overcooked.

Biggest improvement - cook your rice ahead of time in a rice cooker and let cool - day-old cooked rice is the best to make fried rice.

absolutely delicious!!! i can't believe how yummy this was. i made the rice the night before (uncle ben's) - and used chicken stock instead of water to make it. the rice was nice and separated and flavored after it was done. the next evening, i cut up all my ingredients. in addition to what's originally listed in the recipe, i added about 1/2 cup sliced portabello mushrooms, 1/4 cup diced (chopped?) celery, and 1/6 cup finely diced red pepper. i added garlic, pepper, and onion powder to my shrimp before adding them to the pan. i'm "afraid" of eggs in the evening (lol...eggs are for breakfast!), so i scrambled them in a separate pan, and added it at the end lil' by lil'. it was fabulous! THIS WAS AN AMAZING DISH!! i'll be making it very often. yummy! to those that feel their rice got mushy, my guess is that you were moving too slowly. this dish is done in mere minutes. either your heat was too low on your "wok" (i used a big ol' frying pan) or you moved too slowly mixing everything in. good luck - this dish is delish! :)

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I would recommend using 4 eggs instead of 2 and cooking them before adding. I also did not add the bean sprouts until step #3 so they would be a little crunchy and I added a little more soy sauce to taste. Broccoli with Garlic Butter and Cashews by SALSIEPIE is a great side dish. Both recipes are keepers!

Amazing taste. I made the following changes though: I added some garlic to the sauteed onion, then added about a cup of frozen peas, the shrimp, the bean sprouts, and 4 Tablespoons of worscheshire sauce + 2 Tablespoons of terriyaki sauce (beacause I didn't have any soy sauce). I also added some ginger powder. Cooked the eggs separately then added to the mix after adding the cooked rice. Yummmmm!

Yum.  This is the perfect recipe for using up left-over cooked rice and shrimp.  To make it a one dish meal I used sugar snap peas instead of the sprouts and it was perfect.  Everyone loved it.

I followed recipe to a T.  Rice was a mushy mess.  I would suggest follow package directions for rice preporation.  I would give it 0 stars for texture, but the flavor wasn't bad so I felt that it deserved a couple for that.  I will attempt this recipe again with alterations in hopes of a better turn out.

everyone loved it!  I skipped the regular onion.  used a whole bag of shrimp.  added carrots, broccoli and frozen peas (boiled for a couple minutes and then stir fried).  skipped bean sprouts but would love that addition.  Also for sure do egg separate so you can see actual egg.  easy and quick and yummy!  2nd time used asparagus, snow peas, peas, carrots, broccoli and eggs separate- so much more authentic.  used tofu = next time marinate for 10 minutes in soy sauce, red pepper flakes and rice wine vinegar then add with shrimp.

wonderful flavor. really, really liked this. i cut the oil back to 3 Tbsps and used Enova oil. i added broccoli and snow peas that were in bit size pieces in the first round of cooking with the bean sprouts. i also used my favorite mushroom flavored soy sauce from my local asian supermarket. i would add to others, if you cook the rice as noted for this recipe or if you cook rice for fried rice another way, once it is done, fluff the rice and leave the top off the pot as it cools. once it does cool, fluff it some more as you put it into a container in the fridge and don't put a top on it, or cover very loosely with something. keep in the fridge at least overnight, but preferably 2 days. the rice needs to be pretty dry to work well, otherwise it will stick and be mushy and these tips helped.

ABSOLUTLY MARVELOUS!!!  Tastes just like the restaurant I (used to) frequent.  I'll make this again and again.  My only change will be to cook the eggs seperately.

The only reason I am giving this recipe 4 stars is because I did not use a large enough pan and my rice wasn't cool enough and gummed up.  However, the flavors tasted really nice together.  I use the lite soy sauce to cut back on some of the saltiness.  I will definitely try this recipe again!

I am a fried rice fanatic so I'm always on the lookout for my favorites to replicate at home. I used more rice, more veggies, and less soy sauce (half the amt of soy - it can always be added to taste). Wonderful! I try to envision the veggies the local restaurants use and added them in. I am sooo happy to find this recipe. Thanks for sharing it Amy.

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  I paired it with baked fish that I marinated with soy sauce, honey, minced garlic and red wine vinegar(another recipe from this site, Honey Soy Tilapia).  I will definitely have this again.  Yummy.

Marinate shrimp in oyster sauce, soy sauce and a little cornstarch-I only use low sodium soy sauce these days. Cook rice in rice cooker the day before. Add a drop or 2 of oyster sauce to eggs and cook seperate, add in before serving. I use the same pan and cook each item seperate. Love bean sprouts but only cook them briefly-they should stay crunchy. I add a drop or 2 of oyster sauce to each item as i saute them. The rice is the last thing to fry, once it is fried I add all the other cooked ingredients to the rice and mix it up, adding eggs and green onions last.I make huge batches of my shrimp fried rice for party's at my home and am often requested to bring it to friend's partys. It is always the first thing to go. You can add any veggie you want/have on hand and it will still be great!

This was just an OK recipe to me. I think for the simple reason could not get the rice to a dark color and just tasted like the dish was missing something.

Great! As stated in most reviews. Add more sprouts. I made it with 2 cups and it still wasn't enough. Also, I would add the sprouts in at step 3 because I would have liked them to be a bit more crunchy. The rice was a bit soggy, so next time I will take the rice out of the water a little before it is done. I will make this one again, for sure! I think it was almost better when it was reheated the next day!

I love fried rice, and have many different methods and recipes for making it, but quite frankly, this is the best.  Don't change a thing when you make it.

Was pretty good.  Scramble the eggs then move them to a bowl.  Saute the shrimp them put them in the bowl. Saute the onions then add the been sprouts and saute a minute, then add the COLD LEFTOVER RICE, and fry until warm add the shrimp and eggs back to the wok and mix thoroughly.  Add the soy sauce to taste and add a little Sesame oil to taste at the end.  Serve with Kimchi and Egg rolls ??????

My cooking skills are not the best (I had to do a separate Google search from here to better understand how one cooks rice) and I am rarely particularly impressed with the results of online recipes and think most reviews to be overrated. However, this fried rice truly was very good! I intend to make it again. I too cooked the rice in chicken broth and also added some onion in addition to carrots and peas and it tasted great.

We enjoyed this a lot. I added diced red pepper, frozen peas and carrots and it added to the flavor and color of the fried rice. All in all it was really good but somehow the rice was a little mushy for my liking (I made it a couple of hours in advance). I need to work on the rice and it might be a 5 star entree.

This it alot like what I make on a regular basis.  I use Olive oil instead of Sesame, and I use baby chick peas rather then bean sprouts.  I leave out the chives and I add in fresh chopped garlic. sometimes I add in sliced carrots and green bell pepper.  Over all it's a good base line.

I have tried many fried rice recipes, but this by far is my favorite...I use it for chicken and pork as well.  My only addition to the recipe is to add in about a 1/2 cup of frozen peas.  This is a keeper!

I used precooked brown rice and replaced the bean sprouts with peas and carrots.  I couldn't imagine it without them.  I also didn't use salt or pepper.  We all really like it.  Next time I would make sure the eggs set up a bit before I mix them in.    The flavor was great.

Excellent recipe. My five year old said it was as good as the kind from the restaurant. High praise indeed. I added 1/2 Cup peas, and cut out the salt except for the small amount I used to season the shrimp before adding to the pan. I followed another reviewer and added the eggs to a well in the center of the pan and they cooked up very well. Also added couple of cloves of chopped garlic and 1/4 tsp. Chinese five spice just to add a little more flavor. This one is a keeper!

It was a difficult decision whether to give this a four or a five.  The reason I gave it a four is because the recipe says to add the beaten eggs at the end.  The wok was so full, the eggs never got to become scrambled.  By scrambling the eggs in the beginning, then removing them and adding them back at the end, you will get the desired result.  Other than that, I would rate it a five.  Fried rice recipes are good refrigerator emptiers.  I used half Jasmati rice and half brown rice (trying to trick the kids into getting the more fiber of the brown rice.)  If you do that, cut down on the soy sauce.  I skipped the bean sprouts and onions and substituted 3/4 cup diced carrots.  I used raw shrimp.  They were large, so I shelled them and then cut them into bite-sized pieces.  I put them in with the carrots, at the beginning.  At the very end, I threw in some leftover peas that just had to be heated up.  This was very colorful and tasty.  My son complained that it was "too brown" (due to my using half brown rice and not cutting back on the soy sauce.)  However, he also ate two bowlfuls, so I consider this a success.  I enjoyed it too.

Yummo!  Have never tried fried rice before, and this was sooo easy!  Loved the flavor.  The servings for "4" barely was enough  for 3!  Used dried minced onions and threw in some garlic powder, snow  peas and edamame.  Will make this as often as I can.  DELISH!

I didn't like this recipe for varying reasons.
First ... it was overly salty.
Second ... it was mushy.
Third ... it tasted not like Asian shrimp fried rice but rice with shrimp.  
Fourth ... it was simply okay but didn't taste in the least bit authentic. 
Fifth ... I think that the eggs should have been cooked separately ... they did not taste cooked ... kind of a raw texture.  I had to cook it and cook it to get the eggs well-done. 
Sixth , husband thought it was ok.  I will use a different recipe next time or alter this one.  Less soy sauce ... cook eggs separately ... more Asian spices ... this was very bland.  More veggies. Everything stuck to the pan ... I had difficulty with that.  A real bummer.

Sorry.

This was really good. So quick and easy! I used brown rice that I had previously cooked and cooled. If your rice is already made, the rest of the dish takes 15 minutes. After getting the onions and rice going, I took another reviewer's advice and just moved the rice over to add and cook the eggs in the same skillet. I marinated the shrimp (chopped up) in garlic and soy first. So easy! The recipe is still slightly bland, so I would recommend more soy sauce, maybe an extra egg, a touch more sesame oil, and if you like heat, a little chili sauce. I will definitely make this again with a few tweaks. Paired this with lightly sauteed zucchini I shredded with my mandoline and added some basic peanut sauce to. They went together very well! Thanks OKBAT, I will be back!

So yummy and I even healthy-ed it up!  I used 3 cups of brown rice and one tablespoon of coconut oil (so good for you) and a splash of olive oil in place of ALL the vegetable oil.  I added a few chopped mushrooms and chopped cooked carrots in place of the bean sprouts.  I also scrambled the eggs before adding them.

It was so so… I thought it needed garlic & butter, because before the garlic is was kinda flavorless.

This was easy and pretty tasty.  I added the eggs before the rice but after the shrimp.  Next time, I think I will add either rice vinegar or Chinese cooking wine for more of an authentic Chinese restaurant taste.

It really does help to have your rice cooked ahead of time.  What I really like about this recipe is you can add or subtract what you would like.  My husband wanted water chestnuts and mushrooms added and he couldn't find bean sprouts (hopefully not intentionally) at the store so we made do.  It was delicious!!!

Was missing a few of the components and this recipe still came out delicious. I made the shrimp version for my family and a plain version for me because I am a vegetarian. Both were good.

Fantastic recipe! I made the rice and put it in the freezer to get it cold and dry. For a more authenic taste use oyster sauce and sesame oil. I also used frozen peas and carrots. It went great with Egg Foo Yung recipe also found on this site. YUMMY!!!

This started off great, but when I added the eggs/soy/etc., the texture became extremely gummy. I've never added the egg to fried rice that late in the recipe and I think that was the problem. The flavor was great, but I don't think I'll use this recipe again as written.

loved this. followed it exactly except didn't have bean sprouts so i put a bag of steamfresh peas instead... and i used only 3T oil (olive) and added extra soy sauce. it was PERFECT. oh, and i used 5 eggs... so i guess i didn't follow it "exactly" at all, but it was a lot closer than i usually come :)

This turned out pretty bland as is. I made it a second time and added chili paste and extra soy sauce. I also replaced the vegetable oil with sesame oil. Much better. You can add pretty much any veggies you want...we added zucchini and some broccoli.

My husband loved this dish.  Shrimp fried rice is his favorite food and he thought it tasted like his favorite restaurant's. This is saying a lot because we are from New Orleans and very picky about our food.  It must be well seasoned. I followed some the suggestions made such as cooking the eggs first.  I omitted the ginger and  bean sprouts because they were not readily available. I also added a little extra yellow onion.  I even tried this recipe with diced cooked chicken and it was still very good...and inexpensive!

I think this is the easiest homemade recipe for rice with shrimp. As everyone else, it's very important to have dry rice. I always keep cooked rice in the fridge to avoid rush at dinner time and it worked perfectly with this recipe. Just as the ones in the chinese restaurants.

I found this recipe while looking for something to do with a quart jar of bean sprouts I just grew! I also happened to have raw scallops, chicken and shrimp in my freezer, so I cooked it all in advance, then tossed the soy sauce in that skillet to marinate.  I added some minced ginger to the onions, and added all the meat in place of the shrimp.  I made a well for the eggs as suggested, and I had 2 day old rice - very cold and firm -  and it was really good!!

This was very good and easy - I left out the bean sprouts and added a little diced ham.  Delicious!  I cut the recipe to 1/3 but still used one egg and it worked just fine. Tasted like what you get from a restaurant.

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This was so, so good and it's certainly something quick that can be done during the week or as simply a money saver for weekend Chinese food instead of buying it.  I only attempted to make this because my family likes shrimp fried rice and this recipe had good reviews.  I've never been a big fan of shrimp fried rice because I've only found two Chinese restaurants that actually have good flavor but this definitely has a lot of flavor and I will definitely make this again and buy the other entrees when ordering Chinese takeout.  I tripled the recipe (had to use our very large electric skillet) and followed some of the other suggestions and added extra bean sprouts, used low sodium soy sauce and only used 3 tablespoons per recipe (9 tablespoons since I tripled the recipe; I first tasted it to see if it needed more and it didn't so I'm sure making the recipe as stated using only 3 tablespoons instead of four will be good).  Also if using an electric skillet, start with the temperature around 350 degrees and turn it down as needed if it's cooking too fast.  Lastly, put the salt and pepper in the eggs just as you would for scrambled eggs just to make sure that they're distributed throughout the entire dish (especially when making such a large volume as I did).

Very easy to make, and even a good meal to cook with your children.

I've been making this dish for 20 years now, with one minor addition. I add about a tablespoon of diced ginger root (skin pealed off) about a minute before the shrimp and rice are added.

This was very good, like of the the reviewer i use Uncle Ben Ready Rice (Garden Vegetable), I left out the salt and use only one tablespoon of low sodium soy sauce and  of oyster sauce to taste, other then that i follow everything else according to the recipe. I will be making this again, also I made another pan but this time I use rice noodles instead of rice, Now that was good as well. Thanks for sharing

Absolutely, delicious my husband and I loved this recipe.  I did not add the sprouts but added some frozen peas instead. My husband said it was better than any restaurant :)

Healthy, hearty & everyone loved it! Great to make for dinner then take to work the next day - good hot or cold. The only thing I changed was adding a dash of hot sesame seed oil.

I love this recipe!   I completely eliminated the salt (soy sauce is more than enough), and added thinly sliced orange and red bell peppers with the onions and bean sprouts.. Next time I will mix the black pepper with the soy sauce before pouring it over the wok so that it (the pepper) distributes evenly over the rice.. I also added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of sesame seeds in the last step.. It came out wonderfully :)

Easy to make and my whole family loves it!  Used wholegrain brown rice instead of white, Maggi instead of soy sauce and canola oil and it turned out great!  Will continue to make this again and again.

Very good, but I had to bulk it up a bit to make 4 main dish-sized servings. I changed four things, and I think it made the overall meal better. (1) used 1 lb of shrimp. (2) I subbed out the bean sprouts in favor of some diced pre-steamed carrots and zucchini. It's not as authentic, but made it a bit healthier. (3) I left out the salt and used reduced sodium soy sauce. It was the perfect taste, and much better for anyone watching their sodium intake. (4) I used long grain brown rice instead of white which I cooked in a rice cooker and just let sit out for about an hour to cool before cooking. My husband and I both thought it was the best homemade fried rice we'd ever had, and I'll definitely make it again. Thanks!

This recipe was good , however, bland to my standards.  I added chopped carrots, additional sesame oil, extra green onion, frozen peas and extra soy sauce.  I hate to day it but try adding a little suger to the soy sauce and then blend it with the mixture.  It was good but still needs tweeking.  To save time I used a newer product..Birds Eye already cooked white rice w/ vegetables.  Made this so easy.

I followed several suggestions left by other reviews and this still did not come out good for me. I let my rice dry and it was still mushy. I'm going to keep trying and maybe use a different kind of rice. I don't know if that'll make a difference??

I think this recipe would have been better if I'd cooled the rice better, used white rice (I used brown),and if I'd done the well thing others recommended.  It tasted good,but mine was a little gummy, and the eggs were invisible! I will try again, making the rice the day before.

On my second try, I used white rice that I'd cooked two days before, and the result was MUCH better.  I've changed my rating to a 4.  I normally photograph my food for the site, but while this dish tastes GREAT, it looks very blah.  Next time I'll add chopped carrots and peas.  I also pre-cooked the egg this time which was a major improvement.

This was a pretty tasty recipe that I am going to make again. 

The two things I am going to do different is use half the salt and I will scramble the eggs first and set aside as pouring in the raw eggs changes the texture and look of the rice dish.  Other than that, very delicious.

This was pretty bland as is. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I used raw shrimp so it wouldn't be overcooked and used cold rice cooked the night before. I moved everything over and cooked the eggs in the middle so they were separated. Added ginger and garlic to help with the flavor. W

good base but made a few changes too. Salt: 4 tb of soy sauce plus 1 tsp of salt....there is just way too much of it. I cut the salt in half. Sesame oil: can't taste it/ increased to 1 tsp. Still lacking flavor other than soy sauce/added 1/4 tsp of dry ginger to it. I also added diced zucchini jut because I had some on hand I needed to use up....but that is the beauty of stir fry.....add whatever veggies you have handy.

Not bad, not bad @ all. It was a little hard on the eyes but it was quite yummy. next time I will cook the rice beforehand. Also, I will pour the eggs in a corner of the pan to scramble the eggs instead of just mixing it all in. I would make this again :)

This is an excellent base for fried rice and can be easily adjusted to taste.  I added 1 cup of the frozen peas/carrots and left out the eggs.  Based upon Mylove's request, the next time-oh yes, there will be a next time-I will add the eggs and little bit more seasoning, either 5 spice or oyster sauce.  Great recipe-fun to make.

Reasonably tasty, but unappetizing look due to mixing everything together in the same pan.  Also, needs more veggies to dress up the look and taste.

Pretty tasty! I used quinoa (made ahead of time and refrigerated) instead of rice to make it healthier. I also substituted cabbage, broccoli, and green pepper instead of bean sprouts just because it's what I had. I think it needs more shrimp than called for and maybe another egg.

Tried to follow this exactly...don't know what went wrong but I had a mushy mess that did not even look like rice at all. Will likely NOT try this again.

As written, I think this would be quite bland. I used it as a base recipe and added one ingredient that I felt was key for adding flavor - a packet of "fried rice seasoning" (just like a packet of taco seasoning). That improved the flavor quality quite a bit. I didn't add salt but did use at least 3 TBSP of soy sauce (low sodium variety) and didn't find it to be too salty, even with the added seasoning packet. Stepkids gobbled this up, hubby liked it but probably not enough that I would go to the trouble of making this frequently. With pre-cooked rice it was a quick meal.

Good!  I omitted the salt.  Added frozen mixed peas & carrots, 3 cloves of garlic and diced water chestnuts.  I've made fried rice before and I always scramble the eggs before adding to the rice mixture otherwise well - yuck!

I have cooked this 5 times and love the recipe. I do scramble the eggs and then add to the mixture. Also i add the bean sprouts at the last minute so they stay crispy. Excellent recipe!

I had to make a few substitutions/omissions as I did not have bean sprouts, ginger, or green onions, but I'm definitely going to make it again with all the listed ingredients- it was really good!  I added corn, peas, and shelled edamame (frozen, I just tossed them in there with the shrimp and heated a little longer.) I tossed some chives on the top for garninsh and voila!  Love it!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a sort-of last minute dinner party. I cooked the rice and stuck it in the freezer while I went to the store to get everything else I needed. It was super easy to make and everyone loved it. Definitely a recipe to add the faves box!

Very good.  My husband really enjoyed this.  I left out the sprouts because I didn't have any in the fridge.  Next time a would use a tad less soy sauce, but I will definately make this again.

This recipe is awesome.  It was really easy!! I'm not a fan of bean sprouts so I omitted them. I added brocolli instead and I have to pat myself on the back! :) I don't care for egg in my fried rice so I ommitted the egg as well. Other than that I added garlic and used uncooked shrimp and also added szechuan stir fry sauce near the end. Again, this was good!!!!

Thank you so much for this recipe! I will make it again without the sesame oil, however, as it seemed to be the predominant taste for me, although hubby gobbled it up. I found something at my grocery store called Wok Oil that includes ginger and other stuff and that's what I used for the oil. Will never use another stir fried rice recipe!

Very good!  I didn't use bean sprouts but I did use shredded carrot, half of a red pepper diced, and some sliced mushrooms.  I also added garlic, and some 5 spice powder.  5 spice powder is great for adding that chinese flavor.

Made this for dinner this evening and it was amazing! It has been added to my "make again list"
I did however tweek it a little, I used 1 c onion instead of bean sprouts, used dried green onions (since thats all I had), in step 3 i added the rice and let cook a minute before adding in frozen broccoli, frozen sliced carrots, garlic powder, and used small frozen cooked shrimp instead of medium (more shrimp to the bite that way.)  Glad I made enough for lunch tomorrow cause man, I want more!

Great easy, simple recipe.  My boys 13 & 17 loved it. My 17y.o. Even ate it for breakfast the next day, and he's my picky eater. As a matter of fact, it was his idea.The only thing I did additional was added chicken(john souls chicken strips, quick simple) for a little more protein(my teenage boys are always hungry)As always my family are the real judges, this one is definitely a DO OVER!!!! Thanks again for sharing

It turned out really good! I modified this recipe a bit: I used pre-cooked rice and I stir-fried raw shrimp with some garlic just prior to starting. I also used no vegetable oil to make it healthier. I just sprayed my wok with olive oil spray generously. Also, I added half a bag of frozen veggies when I added the rice and shrimp. Oh, and I added garlic when I added the onion. Next time, I'll add the veggies when I do the onion, to thaw them a bit better without overcooking the rice. Definitely a great recipe for leftover rice!

I wanted some shrimp fried rice, found this recipe, got ingredients and fixed it.  I thought 1tsp of salt to much so I waited until after I added soy sauce and I had a pound of shrimp.  What a delicious dish, so much flavor. Thank you for wonderful recipe,  I will be sure to make this again.

Epic fail for me!  Ingredients cost more than going to restaurant to buy the rice already made.  Rice needs to be cooled as to not end up mushy.  And you DEFINITELY need a wok compared to a large pan since it is harder to make sure everything gets stir-fried.  Smelled nice, but won't be trying this again.  Sorry!

Made this last night and was really proud of myself on making my own shrimp fried rice! LOL I love Chinese food and this is definitely something that I will be making again.  I did like a few others suggested and made a well in the middle to cook the eggs in which made it easier and when they started to set, I scrambled them a bit, THEN mixed them with everything else.  I didn't have the bean sprouts but did add frozen peas and cut up carrots in mine along with the green onions, DELISH!!!  Made enough to have for lunch for the next couple days.

I prepared this dish for my family and it came out perfect, but I put my twist on it and it was very good. Instead of white Rice I used  instant whole grain Rice and added salt to the water. The veggies were add according to the recipe, but I cooked the shrimp and eggs before adding to the rice. I also used 4 eggs instead of 2 and salt and pepper to the eggs. The dish wasn't to salty, season to taste.

This was delicious!  I made some minor changes.  I steamed some fresh broccoli, sugar snap peas and red bell peppers and added it to the skillet, last.  I also used low sodium soy sauce.  I pushed the rice mixture to the side of the skillet and scrambled the eggs in the middle.  Be sure to use fresh ground pepper.  Yummy!!

It was too salty. I should have read the reviews before making it :( I added more rice later and it helped. I agree with the recommendation of slightly cooking the eggs on the side of the pan instead of pouring the eggs straight into the rice and mixing it together. I will try again, but next time I will make some changes.

This was ok, but what I do to make shrimp fried rice is even easier. I make the rice a roni fried rice, cook the shrimp with garlic and chopped onion, then add some soy sauce to the pan then mix it together with the rice a roni. Its easy, and even easier to serve with egg rolls, straight from the freezer!! Simple as 1 2 3!! Yeah i know its cheating to use the boxed stuff, but the seasonings are already in the mix, so why not take a lil short cut?

This was easy and tasty.  My husband sprinkled curry powder on his at the table and he liked that too. I cooked ahead two packages of Frozen Birdseye Rice Medley with broccoli and carrots and one package frozen brown rice from Trader Joe.  Cut the soy sauce in half and it was plenty salty.  Chopped up already cooked frozen/thawed shrimp and added at the end. I didn't have sesame oil, so substituted coconut oil and the flavor was nice.

This recipe is great. It has good flavor. I doubled the sesame oil to give it a litle more flavor. I have also used this recipe with chicken instead of shrimp. It works good for any fried rice recipe.

Delicious!  I made sure to use cook the eggs in the center (away from the rice mix) and I did use raw shrimp.  I used a mix of vegetable oil and sesame oil (as suggested by others) and added a handful of chopped cooked carrots and thawed frozen peas for color.  It was great!

I usually make fried rice when I have leftover rice from another meal, which is how I came upon this recipe. It was a good base recipe, but I thought it needed a little embellishment, so I added garlic and ginger with the onion. Marinated the shrimp in soy sauce and five spice powder for 15 minutes, and started with raw shrimp rather than cooked. Didn't use salt and used red pepper instead of ground black pepper.

We made this for my mother n law's 60th b'day and it came out great.  It was simple, and very tasty.  I used some of the same tips that others suggested in the reviews...i made a well between my rice, and let the eggs cook a little before mixing it all up.  I also used Zatarains rice, on the package it says it does not get sticky. and it didnt.  I just cooked the rice, made sure not to over cook, then I rinsed it with cold water until, it was cooled...it turned out great.

WOW!  I gotta say, this is the best shrimp fried rice I have ever had!  I did follow one review, and added 1 tsp. of sesame oil instead of 1/4 tsp, and my shrimp was pre-cooked, which I then added at the last 4 minutes with the oil/onion/etc mixture.  I doubled the rice, and made it the day before as suggested by members.  When I served it, I sprinkled chow mein noodles on top.  And THIS is a KEEPER recipe!  Thanks so much!

I used low sodium soy sauce and eliminatd the teaspoon of salt completely.  Instead I used a pinch of salt in the cooking water for the rice and it was still a little salty.

My family lovde this recipe. I used 2 Uncle Bens rice in a bag and spread the rice on a plate and refrigerate for a couple of hours, came out perfect. This recipe served 5 people. The only thing I would change is, I would add the bean sprouts at the end so they stay crunchy. I will never go to the Chinese restaurant ever again. Maybe I will use beef next time and instead of shrimp.

I made this reicpe tonight for dinner with the Pork Dumplings recipe from this site. (Really good dumplings P.S.) The only thing I did differently was substituting chicken for the shrimp. Although it didn't need anymore salt it lacked flavor. I used low sodium soy sauce maybe that was the difference. I also added some stirfry veggies, I used basmati rice that I had cooked and cooled. all in all a pretty good recip. Next time I'll try adding some ginger, garlic and maybe some hoisin. Would make again.

Using cooked shrimp and the cooking it longer made the shrimp rubbery.  Used two large eggs because that is usually what I have on hand.  Way too much egg for this amount.  Had to add more rice.  Would not make this again.

Excellent flavor! Like it better than take-out because I can adjust to suit my taste! I skipped the green onions.  I think this would go equally well with chicken or pork.  Will make again!

Tasted a bit bland so added more soy sauce but felt I had to add to much. Will try with a loso soy sauce next time.

Soooo delicious.  I didn't have bean sprouts, so I substituted diced carrots.  I cut back a little bit on the soy sauce.  DELICIOUS.  I just ordered egg rolls and spring rolls from a local Chinese restaurant (I haven't mastered those yet).  Can't wait!

Five stars for simplicity and time, moreso than taste. Sauteed 1 lb raw shrimp with 1 bag frozen stir-fry veggies and 1/2T red pepper flakes, added 2 eggs (in the middle of pan, as recommended), then added 2 cups cooked brown rice, 1/4 c soy sauce, and 1/2 can pineapple tidbits. Yuuummmy, a simple, delicious, and nutritious meal!

This turned out great! I was originally making a Weight Watchers shrimp fried rice recipe, but something seemed a little off so I combined them. So instead of white rice, I used brown (cooked the night before. A MUST!). To the pan I threw in about a half cup of diced carrots on one side and started my egg frying on the other side. I salted and peppered my egg at this point. Once the egg was done and chopped up, I moved it to the side with the carrots and threw a cup of salad shrimp into the pan on the side where the egg was. Once they were heated, I combined everything in the pan with 1 cup of snow peas (cut in half), the green onions, soy sauce, a touch of oyster sauce and a little S&P. Perfect!

Followed the recipe pretty close, with a few changes.  For veggies, I shredded some carrots, added edamame and chopped yellow bell pepper.  The only other change I made was cooking the egg in a bit of oil in a seperate pan- the pan was so full I just couldn't fit it! Added it in at the end with the sauce already cooked- VERY GOOD!  I did not add the extra salt, either, and didn't miss it at all.

The basic proportions of the recipe are great, which is why I gave it 4 stars, but I made some modifications.  No sprouts, no green onion, no sesame oil, and I forgot the eggs.  Instead, I added some thawed-from-frozen peas and carrots and a bunch of sliced mushrooms.  This was still quite good and a quick, easy option for "seafood night" at our house.

I made this just the way the recipe called for and mine turned out like mush too.  I think next time I will change the order I put the ingredients into the wok.  But the flavor I thought was perfect.

I've never made fried rice, and this recipe was a perfect starting point.  Not too complicated, fail-safe recipe that stands up to numerous modifications.  I will make this again and again, with whatever veggies and protein I happen to have on hand.  Drop the extra salt, and use brown rice!

Very easy recipe.  I altered the recipe just a bit by adding in mushrooms, carrot slivers, mini corn, waterchestnuts & bamboo shoots.  Also I left out the beansprouts.  The flavor was a bit to salty despite the fact that I used low sodium soy sauce.  Next time I'll cut it down to 2T soy during the cooking and add more upon serving if necessary.  Also, next time I'll cook the egg separately and stir in at the end as I feel that it made the dish to sticky and we like a fluffier rice dish.

This was good. Made some changes based on what I had at home. Carrots, peas and garlic added as my veggies, used my brown basmati rice and eyeballed the soy and sesame oil to taste. I thought it was very good.

Decent recipe.  But, it didn't taste restaurant style.  There was way too much shoyu (soy sauce) in it.  I'd recommend using only 1 tbsp.

Great recipe!! I have been looking for a fried rice recipe that was similar to a restaurant I grew up, unfortunately, the restaurant closed and I have not been able to fine anything else close to it.  It was the best, and this is pretty near it. Simple and great without the peas and other unneccessary stuff.  For those who thought it was salty just use the sodium to your taste, that is why you are preparing it home right??

Excellent with a few spins on it.  Had leftover jasmine rice done w/saffron,sauteed minced onion and chicken broth from night before and perfect consistency next day. Marinaded scallions, shrimp, bamboo shoots first in Oyster Sauce and Soy Sauce (would haved liked to add Enoki mushrooms, but not to be found where I live). Very lightly sauteed shrimp and vegs, and set aside.  Cooked eggs separate put did drizzle a bit of the marinade on them before turning in the pan. Quickly sauteed up the left over saffron rice, then added back the shrimp mixure for 2 mins. or so, shut off the heat and added the cut up scrambled eggs; then drizzled over just a light splash of Sesame oil. Folded all in, and WOW, better than any Shrimp fried rice I've had while eating out.

Some minor changes: make the rice the night before, so that it gets a chance to dry out and doesn't make your fried rice a sticky mushy mess! Also, partially or completely cook your egg in a seperate pan, as mentioned before. Finally, this recipe, when made correctly, is excellent!   EDIT: Well I managed to make it right that one first time and have never been able to make it right again! I'm going to try leaving the rice in the fridge for two days instead of overnight and see if that helps. Ciao!

Ehh...this was just ok for us.  We weren't wowed with it and we wanted to be.  We are a rice loving family and had really high hopes for this, but it fell a little flat.  I will see about playing around with it and infusing a little more flavor, but as is, I wouldn't make again.

This was okay.  Definitely something missing, as other reviews stated, but I also couldn't decide what it is.  I have made fried rice before, and it never comes out as it does in restaurants, so maybe whatever is missing is an "ancient Chinese secret."  I would also agree with other reviewers to scramble the eggs first.  I tried making a well with the rice and cooking the eggs in the center, but it did not work so well for me.  I think part of the problem was my skillet (did not use a wok, which may also be part of the problem), but the eggs still ran into the rice a little, got worse the more I stirred, and ended up either in such tiny bits they were nearly invisible, or the egg coated the rice and scrambled around it.  I also cut the amount of soy sauce, as recommeded by other reviewers, but found this gave the dish little to no taste.  Served it that way to my kids, but added more after their plates were made.  The only other change I made was to add some carrots and peas.  Overall, this recipe is good.  It's not very good or great, hence the 3 stars.  I will make it again since it is quick, easy, versatile, and was good in general.

I cheated BIG TIME!  I used 2 bags of Trader Joe's Organic Brown rice.  I had large raw shrimp, so I seasoned them, under cooked them in my pan and set them aside.  I deglazed the pan with some wine then sauteed celery, carrots, garlic and ginger until the veggies were semi soft and added them to my shrimp bowl.  I scrambled my egg, set it aside, and added my rice (all it needed to do was thaw out).  I added everything back to the pan, doused some soy sauce over and let it cook for about 2 minutes.  Everyone loved it and it was restaurant quality.  Thanks for the starting point!

I wanted to make this dish a couple of times before giving it a rating.  Tasted great both times and will definitely make it again.  My only change to the receipe was to include peas and mushrooms.

I was a little disappointed in this one.  Mine turned out to be a little on the bland side, and I even stuck to the recipe pretty closely.  Only changes I made where to add a bit of extra shrimp, and used 3 eggs instead of two.  Not sure what went wrong.  I added some oyster sauce when I reheated leftovers, and that helped a bit.

Delicious!  I used jasmine rice and let it cool it in the fridge for about two hours. We like it spicy so I also added 2 tsp of red pepper. I also marinated the shrimp in soy sauce for a couple of hours.  I didn't use sesame oil or the egg, but I did add a little extra soy.  Sooo good!

This was good, but not as great as I'd expected from all the good reviews.  I prepared my rice a day ahead and refrigerated it.  I might try adding some Chinese 5 spice powder to it next time to give it more flavor.

This was the first time I tried making fried rice. Because I was nervous, I made a few changes. I scrambled the egg in a separate pan and added it at the end. Also, I diced up two bone in pork chops and fried that for the meat. Like others, I used a package of frozen peas and carrots, cooked them as per the package and dumped them in at the end as well. I started with three cups of uncooked long grain white rice and it made a ton! The best part of this whole recipes is that there was nothing left over at my house! This one made it into the rotation!

Very good recipe, lots of taste. I followed the other reviewers suggestions about the bean sprouts, but i only cooked my rice a few hours ahead of time.....not enough time for it to "dry". So yes, it was a little mushy but that didnt matter. This recipe is really easy to make, which is good because i will be making it often :)

Excellent! This was so delicious, I almost ate the whole thing by myself. I followed the recipe exactly, except I replaced the bean sprouts with green peppers. I also made a well to cook the eggs, and it worked perfectly. I will definitely make this again.

I have now made this recipe twice.   It is excellent!   I added a small bag of peas and carrots this time.    I agree  with what others have said about the egg.     Last time, it seemed to disappear when I mixed it in.     This time I pushed the rice et all to one side of the pan and soft scrambled the eggs before incorporating them into the rice.

Use less water than it calls for, 1 cup for every 1 1/2 cups of rice. Other than that, it's perfect.

I used previous cooked rice (day old) and it still turned out mushy.  The  recipe should specify to scramble eggs separate and then add to recipe.  The flavor was there, but the text was lacking bad.  I’ll try it again.

I have a research projects (technically culinary arts) class. We made this and it turned out amazing! A touch of sesame oil definitely spikes the flavor. I’d suggest adding some more color by using diced bell peppers (red, yellow, orange, green).

Very easy and quick. I cooked my rice the day before and it came out just how I wanted it to. I also used a splash of olive oil. Make sure the oil is heated on high heat for a minute or two before cooking the rice so. Love this meal!

Super simple recipe. Always turns out great. I use instant rice instead of the regular rice because I need stuff to be quick, also because I'm terrible at cooking regular rice. Still do my instant rice a few hours before preparing so that the moisture is mostly gone.

I will definitely make this again. Delicious and very easy The only changes i made were 1) used about 2 cups of shrimp 
 2) added about a cup of frozen green peas when i put in the shrimp and rice 
2) pushed all ingredients to the side of the pan  at the end of the final step and "scramble" an extra egg to toss into the cooked final product

This was so good and easy to make. I used jasmine rice and I didn't have green onion which would have been even better but I had some zucchini I needed to use so I chopped that up and threw in and was really good. Don't omit the salt like some people have said. Definitely will make this again and again!

This has become one of our favs. I did substitute some frozen veggies for the bean  sprouts since we don't like them, but still very good!

We found this recipe to be bland and lacking flavor. It was easy to put together and that is a plus. I noticed that the recipe uses cooked shrimp and I adjusted the recipe so that they would not be overcooked. Shrimp need to be cooked for 2-3 minutes, not 6 or 7. I would also suggest adding some fresh ginger for flavor.

The only thing I will change next time is scrambling the eggs separately and then adding them in, instead of adding them to the whole skillet. As for taste, it's delicious!

I think this rice could have had way more potential. As a warning, I did not have bean sprouts or green onions on hand. It seemed like those two flavors were definitely missed in this recipe. 

I used leftover, refrigerated basmati rice from a couple of days ago (to keep it as firm as possible), and raw shrimp (to not over cook them).  I agree that adding the egg in the rice made the texture completely undesirable, so I would recommend cooking the egg 3/4 of the way (in a separate skillet) before adding it to the rice. 

I'd also recommend seasoning the shrimp beforehand (even with something as simple  salt and pepper)... the shrimp could have had a nice pop, but it was plain instead. I'd also recommend putting the shrimp in and cooking it 1/2 way before putting the rice in (if it's raw).

Tastes a little too much sesame oil, but next time I will add carrots and peas, maybe cook the sesame oil with the regular oil or even mix it with the rice before adding to shrimp, bean sprouts and onions! Overall very fast and easy to put together!!!

While this is a good dish, i think it has to much salt.I did not add as much as the recipes states. I did not add the soy sauce and used 1/2 teaspoon salt. I also used Italian rice ( Arborio) as I find it holds its shape better then regular rice.I had no problem with the  shrimp, it did not get over done.That being said it was very good , I’m giving it a five for flavour.
Thank you for the recipe.

Really good recipe, easy t follow, with basic ingredients. I took it down to 3 tablespoons of soy and added water chestnuts halfway through the onion caramalization and felt like they were a good addition. Would recommend this to any fan of friend rice or shrimp.

This is a very quick, easy recipe. However I would not add the extra salt and use 3 tablespoons of soy sauce as my end product was pretty salty. This is my fault, however, for not tasting the dish before I added all four tablespoons and the extra salt. Just keep in mind when cooking, you can always add more seasonings but you can hardly ever take away!

Easy and fast. I would add peas and heavy hand the soy and sesame. Cook the eggs with the onions and sprouts first before adding rice and shrimp, they will gain better texture. Save some salt, pepper and green onions to season an garnish once done.

After  reading some of the other reviews,  I cooked my eggs separately. I cooked my rice the night before.  I used fresh shrimp. I added peas and carrots,  a little corn, frozen string beans. I added a dash more sesame oil. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was delish.

Wow. This is so good!!  Here's what I did:  very hot wok, a tbsp of veg oil, added grated carrot, chopped celery and onion, tossed into the wok until softened, about 3 to 4 mins, then  added finely chopped fresh garlic just until the aroma hit me, maybe a minute more to soften it. Removed completely from wok, then added about a tbsp of oil and cooled rice, tossed for about 3 mins, and returned the carrot mixture  to the wok with some thawed  peas and corn. Tossed until incorporated. I scrambeld  2 eggs, salt, pepper and a handful of chopped green onion in a frying pan until loosely set and added it to the rice with  3 tbsp of soy sauce, a splash of sesame oil,  cooked shrimp and just a little more fresh green onion.   Tossed together until combined and hot and... Incredible.  I even had a jar of Chinese 5 spice on hand and at quick reach just incase, because I really didn't understand how this could possibly be flavourful on its own, but completely unnecessary. Best fried rice I have ever had. No joke. I can't believe how good this was!! Super easy too!

Made it as is. Only change is that I used raw shrimp,  not precooked.  Came out good! Will make again.  Could also add peas, baby corn, water chestnuts or mushrooms.  Not add alot, but they would go well in there, too.  Thx for sharing!

I added peas and pineapple to mine. I also cooked the rice the night before to avoid soggy rice. Verry good recipe. I use peanut oil for all my fried rice. I made it for a house warming. So I prepped everything except the rice that same day. I saved the pineapple juice for the sweet and sour that I made for the egg roll I made.

This was the best shrimp fried rice I have ever tasted, and sooo easy!! I followed the recipe exactly as it was written, and would not change a thing.  I served it with Grilled Chinese pork chops, Asparagus mushroom stir fry...The taste was wonderful!!  Thankyou so much for sharing.  This recipe is truly a Keeper!!

Shrimp fried rice is my favorite of all time to be able to make it-competently - is sooo great for me. This recipe worked for me. I took one of the reviewers advice,  bought a wok, lowered the sesame, and used ready made rice . Cha ching!. Love it.

I make this recipe often changing it a little by adding a cup of julienne cut carrots and a cup of frozen early peas and I only add half the rice. My husband is on a low carb diet (45 to 50 carbs per meal) and the changes makes this a dish he can enjoy guilt free. It also makes for a colorful and visually appealing meal.  I also use Geisha canned bean sprouts because our very rural location makes fresh bean sprouts hard to find and keep on hand.

I've never made any kind of fried rice before and this recipe was a great little outline to kinda guide my way to what I had in mind. I altered quite a few things. I used two big bags of success boil in bad rice in 3 cans of Swanson chicken broth. I let it boil while my skillet heated up. In the meantime, I cut up two rib eye steaks into bite sized chunks and set aside. As soon as my skillet was hot I poured in my vegetable oil, frozen broccoli, diced bell pepper and onions and my steak. Let it cook until meat is done and broccoli is tender. Drain any excess juice off. Throw in the rice, shrimp and 3 cans of sliced carrots. Season with salt and pepper. Let it cook for a few extra minutes. Then drizzle in your soy sauce and sesame oil. Mix up your two eggs and blend it well with everything. Place lid on the skillet and let it cook for 4 extra minutes. Stirring frequently. And its done. Ready to serve. An excellent compliment with this meal is terry ho's yum yum sauce. Drizzle some on after you fix your plate. PERFECT! It was so good. I cooked a whole pan and every bit of it was gone. Next time I will be needing to make more. If anyone decides to try and recreate this recipe let me know how you like it. ( Most of my measurements was based off of eyeballing. I cook a lot and have gotten the hang of eyeballing very well. So if you cook a good bit I'm sure you can tell how much of everything you would prefer as far as ingredients go. If not you can always use main recipe as a guid

This was very nice.  I added a bit of chopped pork and mushrooms to the mix.  No onion (too lazy) and no red pepper (don't really like) and it turned out very tasty.  Don't do like me and only put in 1/2 the ratio of water to the rice.  It was still edible...just.  Will make again with the rice well cooked!  :-)

I didn't add the bean sprouts, but did add about a tablespoon of sesame oil to give it more flavor. I must say this taste as authentic as any shrimp fried rice I've ever purchased!

I always try to make recipes exactly the first time.  That's the only way I can judge it.  The only difference here was that I used brown rice, which does change the texture.  We all enjoyed the meal but felt it was "just ok".  I agree with others about the egg.  If I made this version again, I would go back to scrambling the egg separately.

easy to make. I would lessen the amount of soy sauce, as  it is a bit salty and I did not use any salt. Otherwise it was a delicious dish.

The only reason I gave a 3 star is because I would had like for someone to tell me to cook the egg first then add it. Even though the flavor was great the result was not what I expected. The rice way to sticky, close to mushy and this because of adding the eggs last. 

I recommend this recipe if you are looking for an authentic flavor.

Easy, simple to make. I agree, don't add extra salt, soy sauce has enough.  made a chicken variation and was just as good.  also for more filler, we used premium frozen stir fry veggies.

Yummy! I put the shrimp in last for 2 minutes, just enough to warm and mixed it in with everything else for the flavors.  Thanks for your post Kelliann.   We ended up with a bit more soy sauce to our taste but I use the low sodium type requiring the added flavoring.

I added some snow peas from my garden, used olive oil instead of sesame oil, only used 1 tbsp of soy sauce and no salt.  I also used fresh sprouted mung beans which I threw in at step 3 as others have mentioned.  I cooked the rice the night before so it was refrigerated and therefore non-sticky.  I always do that for fried rice.  I also doubled the amount of shrimp and added two minced garlic cloves.

Even my finicky wife liked it -- mentioning only that I should have made more.

Very good recipe, but as other reviewers have noted, you do NOT need to add extra salt. If you do, grab a glass of water and enjoy. This dish is yummy! 

I cooked the shrimp raw by wrapping them in foil, adding a pat of butter and putting them in the oven at 375 for 7 minutes. They came out tender and juicy. mmmm!!

Easy to make recipe and it's delicious! I only omitted the salt since most of the reviews said it was too salty. I also used beef instead of shrimp! This was a great family dinner, yielded plenty and even my 4 and 6 year olds ate!!! thanks for posting :)

these are hands-down the best recipe instructions I've used for fried rice, and it's easily customizable! I like to add peas and carrots, and use a little less soy sauce so if people don't like as much it won't overwhelm them, but people who like more soy sauce can always add it to their plates.

Great recipe.  The only changes I made (and for the better) were to add some frozen peas after they have been cooked in microwave.  
After adding the rice and heating, open the center and add the egg mixture to cook on its own then blend into rice.  Add peas and shrimp and heat.  Shrimp are already cooked.

I add about a teaspoon of water for each of the raw eggs and mix well.  Then I add it to the rice.  It gives the rice a shiny appearance.  Be sure to cover and cook the eggs well.

Wonderful! I added a few more veggies like corn, green onions, brocoli and didn't use the egg. I used 2 cups of rice instead of 1.5. Everything turned out great!

Pretty good, but WAY, WAY, WAY too salty. I will make again but next time completely omit the added salt (I should have done this anyway) and use reduced sodium soy sauce. Also, I think the egg is better cooked separately and then added. I used frozen peas and carrots and fresh broccoli as well. The actual flavor otherwise was very similar to a restaurant.

This was really GOOD it tasted just like the one I order from the restaurant I didn't have any bean sprouts on hand so  used greenpeas (SWEETPEAS) in place of the bean sprouts and add some carrots sticks  and keep eveything else the same. It was Wonderful and my Husban enjoyed it TOO! Thank You.

I loved this recipe and so did my family!  I loved he flavor, and took others advice and omitted the salt.  I have tried to cook shrimp fried rice and it never quite taste like the one in my local chinese resturant, but this one actually did!  Oh yea, and I scrambled the eggs before I added to the rice because that just seemed easier for me.

I dont like shrimp but the hubby and kids do so I had to find a way to hide the texture for me but not the taste for them. This was perfect! And I jump on a chance to use my wok. Thank you! I also did the eggs on the side of the rice and that worked well. As well as freezing the rice before i added it into the wok. Again yummy!

For those who thought this was bland....give this a try.  I included peas and mushrooms, but also thinly sliced red pepper and serrano pepper.  This will definitely add heat, but adds some unique flavors as well.

Being a shrimp lover, I added another cup of shrimp. I eliminated the salt in the recipe, due to the high salinity content of the soy sauce. Besides these two changes, the end result was amazing.  I no longer have to go to a restaurant to enjoy this dish.

Great recipe! I only gave it 4 stars because it was a little bland. I added a little garlic powder and a few shakes of Chinese 5 Spice blend. I also only used 1 ½  tablespoon of oil, trying to make it a little healthier and added some diced carrots.  Thanks for the recipe, I’ll be making it many more times :)!

I love this recipe.  As noted by another user make rice night before so rice is cold.  I followed recipe closely, however I added a little powedered ginger to my vegetables while sauting. I also added cooked peas and carrots to the last step.  The results were great.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made a few tweaks and this was a decent dish.  I omitted the bean sprouts and green onions because I didn't have them and I only used 1 egg instead of two because that was all I had.  Everything else was kept the same.  I found the salt to be unneccessary because the soy sauce was already very salty.  I also added some oyster sauce at the request of my boyfriend.  It turned out to be pretty good.  Next time I will definitely put in the green onions and probably some more veggies.  Thanks!

Tasted good, but a little on the sticky side.  Could be because I used brown basmati rice instead of white (will try white next time).  Still good as leftovers too.

Awesomely simple recipe...Cook your rice wayyyy ahead, though or it will turn out mushy...the taste was excellent...I fried everything in sesame oil, added peas and a bit of red pepper from the leftover area of my fridge, added soy sauce a bit at a time and I also put a small amount of duck sauce in there for personal taste, but this was yummy.

This was edible, but it was not like fried rice that I have ordered before.  I thought there was to much rice for the rest of the ingrediants.  Maybe I used the wrong rice, but mine was really moist.  I wonder if I had made the rice a day before it would have been better.  It was filling and made a HUGE portion, but I don't think I'll make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

Good recipe. I used less oil, less soy sauce, more shrimp. I still prefer the Chinese food restaurants shrimp fried Rice. Some kind of flavor missing but still good for "make-at-home-take-out". Served w/ Honey Lime Wings (also on this site).

we had this about two nights ago. while it was good, it was DEFINATELEY not something that you would order at your local chinese resturant, nor does it taste like it. 

but it was good, just not authentic. would make again with minor altercations.

Outstanding!  I have a very picky family when it comes to Chinese food.  This was a hit all around.  It's a keeper.

Found it was missing something, just not sure what yet.  I did not add the salt as others recommended.  Maybe that was it.  Will try this again with Uncle Bens rice after cooking it the day before.

Will definitely make again. Very easy. I usd shallots instead of onion and grapeseed oil instead of veg oil. Also omitted he bean sprouts. I have a very large wok and it worked great. No need for salt. And I cut the soy sacue in half. Was delicious. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

Good recipe. I should have read the reviews before I made it -- it was too salty. And mine did turn out a little mushy -- I used cold rice, but my wok is probably too small -- you need a really big one for this recipe.

I love shrimp fried rice and wanted to learn how to make it, but this recipe didn't work well for me. I followed the recipe precisely ,but it came out very mushy.

Very good.  Look and tasted just like the Chinese Restaurants.  Next time I make it, I will fix it with chicken since my boyfriend does not like shrimp.

Great recipe! I added sliced mushrooms and chopped waterchestnuts. I followed others direction by making the brown rice a couple days ahead. Hubby loved it!
