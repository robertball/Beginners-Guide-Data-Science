I've cooked this recipe on three different occassions for a group of guys I meet with at 6AM. I always get rave reviews and they keep telling me how I'm going to make someone a good wife someday (I'm a guy), which I find humorous. This has the perfect amount of spicy kick to it and is exploding with flavor. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it and make it again. Personally, being young and slightly new to cooking, it takes me about 45 minutes to prep. I throw it in the fridge overnight and get up early to cook it. Takes about 35-40 minutes to cook after being refrigerated.

Criminy, I wanted to write this review for this recipe and wrote it for another, which I intend to try soon so I don't feel quite as foolish.  I loved this.  My love is going to serve it for deer camp; which, contrary to popular belief is actually a gourmet fest which takes on the competiveness of any Iron Chef episode.  LOL!

It's too bad the submitter didn't give this a more creative, eye-catching, fitting name than "Dilly Ham and Eggs."  This "frittata" is soooo much better than its humble, boring name! I stuck reasonably close to the recipe, only using lots of fresh dill for the dried, fresh chives for the green onion, multi colored bell peppers and omitting the picante sauce, only because it was impractical to open up a jar for just the couple of teaspoons I needed for just myself and Hubs. This was delicious. It may seem a little putzy, and I guess it is for "just eggs" but the extra steps were worth it.  There is such great flavor here - every ingredient contributes something, from the fresh parsley to the pimientos.  Confetti-looking in it's appearance with a fresh, flavorful taste. Bakes up beautifully.  One other bonus?  While it was in the oven baking I set the table,  prepared the go-withs and cleaned up the kitchen!

My significant other takes his breakfast to work so I have started cooking breakfast casseroles instead of buying the highdollar frozen breakfasts at store.  This is a great dish.  Alot of flavor; easy to prepare and a beautiful dish as well.  Much tastier than the breakfast casserole I had been fixing.  Will definitely repeat this dish.  I believe I'll add a little jalapeno next time to zest it up a bit more!

Very good egg recipe!  I followed it to the letter and it turned out wonderful.  Sometimes I get tired of eggs but I don't think I will with this recipe.  It is so full of flavor with the herbs, onions and green pepper.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great and easy recipe! I cut it in half and it still came out great. Makes a lovely, fluffy egg dish. Not heavy, doesn't sit in your tummy like some egg/cheese dishes.
