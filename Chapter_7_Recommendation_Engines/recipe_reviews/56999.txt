Wow, these were great! Even two of my mushroom-hating kids tore them up! The only changes I made was substituting the cracker crumbs for Parmesan flavored bread crumbs since that's what I had on hand, and topping each mushroom with a torn slice of mozzarella cheese the last few seconds of baking, then hiking the temp up to broil to get some cheese bubbling action going. Just my little tip with stuffed mushrooms: I always saute the whole mushroom caps on both sides for a few minutes, then drain hollowed side down on paper towels for at least 10 minutes prior to stuffing. This softens the mushrooms a little for a more tender texture, and draws some of the natural water out of them so you can avoid a soggy, wet mushroom. Also reduces baking time for the finished product, and they always turn out perfectly tender and sog-free! :-) Thanks so much for the recipe...can't wait to serve these at the Superbowl party. I might even try a little marinara sauce on the side for dipping!

I was lucky enough to get this recipe from Koalagirl before it was published and I decided to make these for our annual friends and family post Christmas tree picking and chopping party a few weeks ago. Honestly, everyone said that they were the best stuffed mushrooms they had ever tasted. I did add more parm than suggested and I replaced the broth with white wine. Sprinkled more parm on top with a dot of evoo and a bit of paprika. These were sensational Shar and I thank you so much for the sneak preview!!

I made these for our Christmas Eve celebration and they were a hit. I used the gigantic stuffing mushrooms from Costco, which made for a showy platter. Instead of butter crackers I used French's Fried Onions (Cheddar flavored) and whirled them up to crumbs in my mini processor... I believed this really added that special somethin' somethin' to what was an already fantastic appetizer. Bravo, Koalagirl, for providing an excellent appetizer recipe!

Someone gave me this recipe years ago and I've been making them, at my father-in-law's request, for every holiday, ever since.  Turkey pepperoni is the way to go, cuts down on the fat content. And the cracker crumbs make the recipe.  I also found out that you can cook these in the microwave which really helps out on holidays like Thanksgiving, when the oven is already in use.

All I can say is that everyone at my dinner party last night said these were the best stuffed mushroms they have ever had...be sure to make extra! I would suggest making 3 per person. I bought the larger mushrooms from Costco vs the smaller ones from the grocery store...this made all the difference and were a better price too! Be sure to get fresh pepperoni from the deli...I used Boar's Head...they sliced it in pieces about a 1/4 inch thick so that I could dice it easily. I used two garlic cloves instead of one (used jarred minced). I used garlic herb crackers (TownHouse Toppers) to add some flavor vs just using plain butter crackers. I added extra parm (used a 1/4 cup total) and instead of grating it I used the shredded bagged and put in the mini-chopper. I used chicken broth and thought it tasted great...will maybe try white wine (as others have done) next time to compare. I sprinkled paprika over them before baking to add a little flavor. About half way through baking I sprinkled on some shredded parm...this added a nice flavor to the top. One thing that is very important, as others have mentioned, is to saute AND drain the mushrooms before stuffing them. I did saute them but forgot to drain them afterwards...all was okay but the bottom of the pyrex dish was quite liquidy after I baked them...was no biggy but I would have liked for them to have been less soggy. Fantastic!!!

These were a hit!  I had enough stuffing to make about 3 times as many mushrooms.  Next time I'll buy more mushrooms to use.  I also sauted the mushrooms before stuffing as someone else suggested.  And added a bit of cheese on top.  GREAT!

Absolutely incredible!  My gosh are these tasty!  Didn't change a darn thing in the recipe - it's perfect.  The chicken broth cooks the mushrooms perfectly, so sauteeing the mushrooms before stuffing them (as noted in other reviews) is unnecessary.

So, when a person tells you "I just can't stay out of these mushrooms!!!" You know that it's good!  I made this for some ladies at a Women's Bible Studay at Church and it was a HUGE hit!  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.  I also promoted this site to all of the ladies at Church!

This was a really good recipe. I was looking for a recipe that was similar to an appetizer that I had at Zio's Italian Restaurant in TX, and this hit the spot for me. I didn't have any round crackers or oregano on hand, so I just used Italian breadcrumbs.

I made these for a recent party. I followed the recipe exactly apart from adding a bit extra parmesan on top. These were the first plate to be emptied, in fact some guests never got to try them because others thought they were so good. Without a doubt I will make these for future parties. Thankyou so much Sharyn.

This is just like the recipe my mom always used for parties when I was growing up.  The only difference is my mom added some green pepper - other than that, it's the same.  Everyone LOVES these mushrooms.  I look forward to making for our next party

Made these for the bf (I don't eat mushrooms) and he really enjoyed them.  I thought they might be a bit greasy with the pepperoni, but he said they weren't.  I made a half batch for him and he ate half of them at one sitting, so they must be a success!  Very easy, too.  thanks for the recipe!

Awesome.  The only  thing I changed was I added crushed cheese-garlic croutons instead of buttery crackers and I added a bit of water instead of chicken broth.  I also didn't let the mixture cool before filing.  Delicous.

These were very tasty! I will cut down on the amount of chicken broth as the filling was a little too wet for our tastes.

My husband could not stop talking about these! Raved and raved. I made it just as is- we use panko crumbs in our house instead of breadcrumbs. so I was worried it would taste weird since I didn't have the buttered round crackers. No worries- I added in some crushed french onions and it was fabulous!! Will definitely make these again
Made these AGAIN... man, are these good. I upped the garlic to four cloves (and I think I only had 20 mushrooms) and they still disappeared- we have these for dinner. So Good!!

I thought these were great and I would definitely make them again. The only thing I did differently was add some cheese on top and some EVOO on top of them so they didn't burn.

These went over very well, especially with the guys! I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the buttery round crackers, so I omitted the oregano. Also topped with a little mozzarella before baking. Thanks!

Pretty good, but not 5 stars.  I sauteed the mushroom caps in a little EVOO before stuffing, as suggested. If I make again, I will sprinkle a bit of mozz cheese over the top before baking. It seemed to be missing something--I think it needs the cheese.

These turned out well. I had to substitute white wine for the chicken stock but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I'm not sure if I liked the crackers in this but I loved the pepperoni! Thanks, K-Girl:o)

I had 4 mushrooms leftover so I thought I'd try this for my husband (I don't like mushrooms). So easy to make and all ingredients I keep on hand. He really liked them. The only thing I changed, because I was making so little yield, was to use garlic powder instead of fresh and water instead of broth. Will definitely make again.

I also used bread crumbs instead of the cracker crumbs. I made the chicken broth with a bullion cube. I put a fer pieces of shredded cheese on top of each.

These were easy and absolutely delicious - loved by all!  I followed the instructions essentially "to a T", except where it came to the onion.  Onions come in all sorts of sizes - can you imagine the differing results if one person used one whole pearl onion and another person used one whole jumbo red onion?!  I used 1/4 of an average-sized Vidalia (sweet) onion, and I think that worked out perfectly.

My girlfriend cooked these up as an appetizer/snack for a football game. The recipe seemed pretty easy to follow and everything went together well. The flavor was great, a nice alternative to a seafood stuffed mushroom. The only thing we didn't like about this recipe is that the stuffing just didn't seem to have the right consistency. It was a little to mushy for us. We may try again and add more cracker crumbs or something to create a better consistency in the stuffing.

Absolutely amazing! I used all the same ingredients, minus switching out the button mushrooms for 2 large portabellas, which changes how much you really need of the ingredients. Cook by eye, and you'll be fine, there's nothing that can really go wrong. Also, to save time, a jar of minced garlic and dehydrated minced onion work well.

These were okay, they seemed to be lacking something. I only ate two and didn't want anymore. I couldn't taste the pepp. at all. It kind of tasted like eating crackers with mushrooms.

This was a huge hit at a party. It does get a bit watery, but I did broil this for a few minutes which helped.

Again, another hit with my family. These were really good. I used turkey pepperoni and Italian bread crumbs instead of the buttery crackers for fewer calories. The flavors were fantastic. I have never had pepperoni in stuffed mushrooms before, but I was really pleased with the results. I made these with Asian Lettuce Wraps and St. Louis Toasted Ravioli for super bowl and these were 3 winning dishes! Thanks!

These were great! Very simple to make and very tasty. The only change I made was to use only 1/2 cup chicken broth, and that was plenty. The kids LOVED these, so that makes them even more of a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

All I can say is yum! What a fantastic recipe.  I followed the recipe to a T but I had to make additional stuffing.  Next time I will just increase the amounts in the recipe, but I won't change a thing.

First attempt at making stuffed mushrooms & they came out pretty well!  I used bread crumbs instead of the crackers, warmed up the mushroom caps and drained them before stuffing & sprinkled cheese on top, a little greasy....but the neighbors thought they were delicious!

OK these were absolutely delicious! For maybe the first time in my life I didn't change a thing--Never made stuffed mushrooms before. I usually shy away from anything that labor intensive but these sounded so good I had to try. Well worth the effort. Thanks to the person who gave the helpful tip of sauteing then letting them drain before stuffing. A LOT of water came out and I'm sure they would have been quite messy without that step. YUM YUM YUM! Great recipe!

Delish, Delish, DE-LISH! These came out like little pizzas in a 'shroom! I was able to make the stuffing part the night before, and it held up perfectly. I used little pepperoni snack sticks to dice up.Big sticks would have been way too hard to dice into small pieces. Followed directions exactly. No need for subsitutions! All of these went!!! THANKS!

Sooo yummy! I make these often, they are a game day favorite. Like mini pizzas!  Just an update, I now cook the pepperoni slightly in the microwave between paper towels to lose some of the grease then put them on a rack to lift them out of the liquid when baking.

Just like the others these were a hit and went really fast so I suggest you double the recipe! I took the advice of many by sautéing the mushrooms in advance to get rid of the water. That is a MUST! I also did not use crackers, & just ground up some day old white bread I had. I seasoned the bread crumbs a little with the black pepper, dried oregano & garlic powder before adding. The only big change I made was I had the chicken broth set aside but only used about 1/2 of what the recipe called for. I would just use your own discretion about the amount needed so it's not to watery. I added just a little shredded mozzarella on the top. They really taste like a pepperoni pizza.

This recipe is fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly and the mushrooms were gone within minutes of coming out of the oven.  I think the only change I will make next time is baking them another 5 minutes.  Some of my mushrooms were just a tad too firm so a little extra time in the oven should do the trick. My husband loved them and has requested them for Super Bowl Sunday. They were a hit!

These were wonderful and my daughter even loved them. The pepperoni added a special taste.  I did however make a couple of changes to the recipe.  I didn't have the buttery crackers so I used bread crumbs.   I also added some Shredded Italian Cheese (similar to mozzerela)during the last few mins to put on top. As a side note if you have liquid in the pain when you take them out to put the cheese on, just pour it out and they will dry right out by the time the cheese melts.

This recipe is amazing! I made it exactly as the recipe states. I made the 12 servings for four people as an appetizer, thinking it would be too much and I could take some home, but nope! They all disappeared and I got huge praise.

I substituted crushed croutons for the crackers and subtracted a couple of tablespoons of the chicken broth and replaced it with some soy sauce. Delicious!

These were pretty good! They were almost like mini pizzas- heavy on the mushroom of course!  They were a little softer than I expected them to be, but someone else brought stuffed mushrooms to the same gathering and I'm pretty sure everybody liked mine better :-)

These are average and the pepperoni makes them a little greasy too.  Was worth trying, but I have better recipes to stuff mushrooms.

These were really different.   never stuffed them w/ pepperoni before.   i used 50% fat pepperoni, WW bread crumbs and about 1/4 c. of parm cheese.  i also used a reisling that was opened for the chix broth.   I did follow one reader's suggestion of sauteing mushrooms and draining upside down prior to stuffing.  when mushrooms were almost done, i sprinkled tops w/ shredded mozz cheese.   good reheated!

For someone that doens't always like mushrooms, this recipe was delicious.  The one thing I would suggest is using honey-garlic smoked pepperoni, the extra flavor it added was excellent. Though next time I will definately saute the caps longer to keep them from getting too soggy!

I made half of this recipe and filled the mushrooms about 2 hrs. before baking and refrigerated them - worked fine.  Followed the recipe as written and it was delicious.

This recipe is very good! My family has always made sausage stuffed mushrooms as an hors d'oeuvre, and you couldn't really tell it was pepperoni.  Instead of round butter crackers, I used Sociables.  The extra seasoning in the crackers made them very tasty with a zing!  Also, it wasn't really necessary to use chicken broth.  Water worked just as well.  I also put a sprinkle of mozzarella on top.

This was the perfect recipe for my hubby who hates cream cheese and loves pepperoni.  I sauteed them first, as others did to get some moisture out.  Used a little less chicken broth, but otherwise followed the recipe.  They went fast!  Will definitely be my go to stuffed mushroom recipe from now on!

Followed the recipe exactly as directed. Very tasty. Will make again but will leave out the chicken broth next time. Felt it made the stuffing too watery and a tad bit salty. Parmesan cheese adds enough of a salty flavor as it is. Other than that, my guests loved them!

Changes that make a big difference to make this work:
1. Don't add the chopped stems to the cracker stuffing  
2. Use less broth.  

Changes that are personal taste:
1. Butter crackers & pepperoni are salty. I omit the extra salt.
2. I prefer vegetable broth to chicken broth.
3. I use more Parmesan cheese - probably 1/8th of a cup.

Pro-tip: If you don't like wasting the stems,  use them to make a casserole version of this recipe, place in metal pan and top with another batch of the cracker stuffing.

These mushrooms were so delicious, I could have eaten every single one. I picked this recipe since I had some extra mushrooms and pepperoni laying around. I had to modify quite a few things based on what I had, but it still turned out great. I honestly don't think you could mess it up! I used French fried onions instead of the crackers based on another reviewer's suggestion. I also used white wine instead of chicken broth. I topped them with shredded Parmesan and baked for 20 minutes. They were amazing!

I needed an Italian appetizer to take to an Italian themed birthday party that looked tasty and simple to make.  I scored with this recipe!  These delicious mushrooms were appetizer favorite of all!  Everyone raved about how great they were!!  I doubled the recipe as we had 15 people attending and ALL were eaten!!  Followed the recipe exactly but added Parmesan on top.  I will be making these again soon!

Took them to a tailgate and they went fast.  I had extra "stuffing" so I put cheese on it and made a great dip.  I subbed bread crumbs.

WOW this was a great addition to my collection of appetizers!! I made it for the football crowd but added more garlic and used rosemary wholegrain crackers instead pf buttery crackers- I also borrowed a tip form someone else and plunked a small bit of mozarella cheese on top when almost finished baking- they were a hit and were gobbled up in no time.

I followed the recipe except I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the crackers and it was soooo salty.  I was so disappointed but thankfully I had prepared your fantastic "Gary's Stuffed Mushrooms so it wasn't a total loss.

So sorry to rate this lower than the others. I made 36 mushrooms and they were slimy and mushy. The taste was okay - the texture was not what I expected. Everyone tried them and didn't have another & I tossed out the rest. Maybe I did something wrong?

very good recipe-wonderful flavor.  I used the advice of another reviewer and sauteed the mushrooms first to remove moisture.  I did not have large mushrooms, so I layered a casserole dish with smaller mushrooms and then poured the stuffing on top, sort of like a casserole.  The only thing I did not like was all the grease from the pepperoni.  I may try to drain it somehow before adding the crackers next time.  Definitely a keeper!!
