As written this would have been way to sweet for us.  I cut the sweetener in half and it was still very sweet so I added more water and once the lemon and orange zest and butter were added  it was fine.  It would be great with some chili flakes stirred in at the end.

I'm only rating the sauce. It was fantastic. I veganized it, using vegan butter and I used a fresh squeezed orange. 
We poured it over sauteed meatless chicken breasts and grilled peppers. YUMMY!

Just made this and already on my second serving :0, only thing I changed was the sugar. I used 1/2 cup regular white granulated sugar and the sweetness was just right. Any more would have been too sweet.
