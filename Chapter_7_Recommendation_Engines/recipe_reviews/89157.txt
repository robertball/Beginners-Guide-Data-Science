This is a recipe you can easily tweak to suit your own tastes. I have made this recipe for years. It makes a wonderful brunch since you can make it the day before. It is good hot or warm and doesn't lose any quality reheated the next day. Which sausage you use makes a difference. I always make one casserole with the maple sugar flavored sausage and one with the hot pepper sausage. Use whatever cheese you like or a combination. Use any kind of bread. I save the odds and ends of bread in the freezer for this dish. I have never added the dry mustard. One thing that is important is to let it sit in the fridge for at least a couple of hours; overnight is better - the bread needs to be completely soaked. I usually check the casserole to make sure that it is nice and wet before I bake it, if it looks a bit dry, whisk another egg and some milk (1/4 cup milk per egg) and pour it over the casserole, give it a few minutes to settle, then pop it in the oven. This is a very forgiving recipe, add onions, garlic, chili peppers or not - leave out the sausage or use roughly chopped deli ham. The key thing to remember is the ratio of bread to the milk/egg mixture (the amount of bread in this recipe is woefully small unless you are looking for a baked omelet dish rather than a more stuffing-like consistency). Better if it is a little too wet than too dry. Don't be afraid of messing this up. Serve with a fruit salad and a bowl of salsa.

I prepped the recipe yesterday morning, and baked it up this a.m, Christmas Eve. Wow, this is good! I used the Bob Evans Sage Sausage. Rather than using bread cubed, I used a bit of dry herb stuffing, I used some condensed milk with a bit of water added. Just spicy enough to satisfy the taste buds. My husband gave it a 10! I'll be freezing the leftovers in zip-lock baggies, for our holiday return. I'll try adding mushroom soup to a doubled recipe for the crock-pot and let you know how that turns out, too. This one's a keeper!

I don't know how anyone could get this casserole to bake in 30-40 minutes. It took a full 1 hour and 20 minutes for it to bake. Taste wise, this was pretty good - it needed a little kick so we used some green jalapeno sauce to liven it up. I used venison sausage which gave it great flavor. Next time I plan to use some hot peppers in place of the green pepper, maybe cherry bombs or hot banana peppers.

Good for a dish to pass at breakfast meeting.  IMO it was a little too meaty, I might scale back the amount of sausage.

I tried this out this morning to see if it might be something I would want to put on my Christmas morning buffet.  It was great!  I used sage sausage and 4 buscuits instead of the white bread.  yummy!  Thanks Bob Evans for a great recipe!

I put a bit of a twist on this. After cooking I cut into 2"x4" pieces and wrapped in a tortilla, covered with cheese and made a breakfast burrito. Wrapped in wax paper and froze. Now my husband has breakfast every day!

I enjoyed this meal.  The kids not so much.  I used Italian sausage, add 1/4 c of Herb Seasoned Stuffing, lots of green onion, red and green bell pepper.  Next time I will use Maple Sugar flavor sausage and not us so much bell pepper.

Quite enjoyable; quite easy. Used maple sugar sausage in the second batch (preferred) and thought the red pepper was crucial to flavor (more so than the green). Not sure, but I think this is actually better zapped the next day.

Mix everything together with the bread cubes and let it stand in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, let it come to room temperature before baking. A wonderful, fluffy casserole!

This recipe is fantastic!! I love that I can brown the sausage  a day or two ahead of time and just make this dish for breakfast by putting it all in a pan, putting it in the oven and relaxing with my coffee while breakfast bakes!

Made this for my husband's football players, and they still can't stop talking about it. I used English muffins for the bread.

Very good.  This is so easy to put together the night before, which is what I did.  Since I baked it from the fridge and it was cold, I baked it at 375 for about an hour.  It was really good; all the adults in the house loved it (we have family visiting).  The kids didn't, but I used a spicier salsa as a sub for the peppers that I didn't have, so I'm not surprised.  The bread wasn't soggy, which made me happy.  this is a nice, very simple breakfast casserole that was great this morning.  Thanks for the recipe!

easy and delicious!  as many reviews stated...you can add just about anything you like to this to suit your own taste.  i loved that you didnt have to soak the bread overnight to prepare this dish.  i didnt have any trouble with the cooking time either...40 minutes in my toaster oven (we are at 7200 feet), and it was perfect!  I did omit the peppers and added onions instead...my family doesnt like cooked green peppers...but they certainly loved this dish :)

Loved it.  subsituted the pork sausage for Turkey sausage and bacon.  Also adding green onions really brings the flava out even more.  Loved this dish and so did the family.

A wonderful recipe I've been making for years, brunch, christmas, anytime. I have used sage sausage, as well as diced ham. It is very versatile. I use onions, green and red pepper for color, and sharp cheddar cheese. I sprinkle a little garlic powder and definitely use the dry mustard. One hint to cut down oil: if using sausage, be sure to drain and rinse to remove as much oil as possible. Dish turns out great every time and everyone gobbles it up! Will make again and again!

A breakfast delight!  Actually, it's wonderful any time of the day.  I like to add a side of bacon to accompany the dish.  I LOVE onions, so I included some chopped onion and sauteed the peppers and onions in a skillet to slightly soften them.  I didn't use dry mustard.  This is one of my favorite dishes for breakfast!

I was worried this would not be any good if I did not store it in the frig over night, but it was still really good. It is fast and easy. I bet it is even better with the extra time as several reviewers mention, but still works if you can't wait 8 hours or more to cook it.

I remembered my mom making breakfast casseroles for brunches when I was a child and decided to search for one to try out.  I made it last night and it turned out great!! A little watery last night but I re-heated some in the microwave this morning and it's perfect! This one is definitely a keeper :)

SOGGY! Here's what happened: I made this the night before (which was great)and followed the recipe pretty close except I added Natures seasoning and used drained hot italian sausage (it was on sale) and peppers I had pre-chopped in my freezer & added one more slice of cubed bread b/c my pan was big and I figured the peppers would be watery too. I let it set out an hr prior to cooking. After 30 mins it wasn't done, but the bottom was beginning to get brown (may be my pan's fault) and the cheese was getting done so I covered it w/ foil and waited as long as I could. In total it was about an hour, and if it hadn't been for the bottom browning I would have left it longer b/c it was so soggy!! But, that said, other people seem to have had good results with this so its probably something I did. LOL- so just don't do what I did...

I needed something for a great Easter bfast for the family. I thought this was great! Very flavorful! I noticed some complaints about the time...you need to make sure that, one,  you use the right size dish and two...remember that it may take longer. Because, not everyones ovens are calibrated right.
