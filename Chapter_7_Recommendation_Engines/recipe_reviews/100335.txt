I unexpectedly decided to glaze a cake I had made to dress it up. I really wanted a chocolate ganache, but found I had no heavy cream--and then I remembered this recipe. In just a few minutes I had the most luxurious, fudgey icing, almost like a hot fudge sauce. This recipe saved my cake!

Awsome!  I used White Chocolate instead of Milk Chocolate Chips.  It melted beautifully and was delicious over a devils food chocolate bundt cake.

Tuni, Tuni, Tuni, what more can I say? This was FABULOUS!!  Used this to glaze my daughter Ashley's icecream birthday cake today and I'm still scoopin' up what fell to the plate!!!! I swear, I didn't even eat the cake; only your glaze. The kids and hubby were rolling their eyes and watching me as I was "mmmmmmmmmmmmming" over this as they were all munching on the cake. For all who are interested, I have a big problem melting chocolate. Sometimes it comes out just fine, but other times, it gets all dry and clumpy. Don't get it because I've done the microwave method and the double boiler. This was amazing because with the addition of the condensed milk it came out perfectly! No fuss, no muss. Family commends you because they know what I go thru and they loved it. Thank you so much darlin'!

Quick, easy and very chocolatey! Would take flavorings (almond, orange, etc) well. Used to top a bundt cake. The glaze does set, but not hard and crackly - it's still soft just not sticky.

I would never have guessed that such a simple sauce could make an excellent icing without butter. The flavor rivals any powdered sugar icing I've made and sets up beautifully. I added another 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and used 1 T of butterscotch schnappes in place of the vanilla. Excellent recipe Tunisianswife!

I made this glaze yesterday for my chocolate bunt cake.  Yes, it is easy, yes, it tastes OK (nothing special).  This recipe makes enough "glaze" for 4 bunt cakes, I cut it in half and it was enough to frost/coat the entire cake (too much to be applied as a glaze).  When it sets up on the cake it turns dull and blah looking it isn't pretty like I prefer on my cakes, after all we eat with our eyes.  I will not make it again.

This was incredible.  Very easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I used it to glaze an amaretto chocolate cake, so I used 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a 1/2 tsp of almond extract in the glaze (instead of the 1 tsp of vanilla that the recipe called for), and I sprinkled some toasted almonds over the glaze.  Huge hit!

Quick, easy, and sweet.  This same recipe is one I use as a filling in a bar cookie, but I never thought to use it on its own.  I've also used this as a filling between chocolate layered cake, which was divine.  One negative as a glaze--using a can of expensive sweetened condensed milk, when there are other glaze recipes out there that cost much less to make.

If I could give more stars I would! This stuff is awsome!!!  I made this to top my fudgy brownies and, oh my goodness!  It made such a delicious glaze.  So easy to whip up and yummy!  Will be making this quite often!  I love that it is only 3 ingredients.  Oh, I used fat free sweented condensed milk and had no problems.  Need to try this on ice cream and homemade donuts!

This is fantastic just as it is, but it's also an amazing base for experimenting! I like using a bit of unsweetened chocolate to make it less sweet, or using dulce de leche instead of sweetened condensed milk. This basic recipe has NEVER failed me!

This was a very delicious glaze, one that I will gladly use again. The texture was wonderful, and everyone loved it! I substituted butterscotch chips for half of the chocolate chips.

This was the easiest, most beautiful chocolate glaze I have ever made. I let it cool about 2 minutes before pouring it on the cake, which was just the right amount of time because a skin was starting to form on top of the chocolate in the pan. I added 1 t almond extract instead of vanilla and put it on a bananna bundt cake. Next time I'll try it on a cream sherry bundt cake. It makes enough glaze for 1 and a half bundt cakes, could even push it to 2 cakes if you were light on the glaze.

This was a great glaze for a chocolate chocolate bundt cake.  The best part is it wasn't very sticky and remained soft the next day.  If you like chocolate you will love this glaze.

This was easy to make and delicious flavor. I used giradelli (sp) chips which made it awesome! Unfortunately, I made it ahead of time and it didn't reheat very well. The consistancy changed so it wasn't very pourable and it re-hardened very fast. I've tried to reheat it twice now with the same results. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.

I've used many recipes from this site but this is my first review.  This frosting is the best!!!  I used it over a cake box mix bundt cake and the frosting make this cake taste homemade.  It was not too sweet and super easy to make.  I had a bittersweet baking bar, so I used that, and it was perfect.  Will definitely always have condensed milk on hand specifically for this recipe.

I would say you can't mess this up, but after reading some reviews that would not be true.  All I can say is I made it and it poured beautifully and was absolutely delicious. Simple and wonderful, everyone raved over the devil's food cake I made with this frosting.  Just keep your heat at a minimum and you should be fine, cook it too fast and you will mess it up as with any recipe calling for melted chocolate. A keeper! Thank you for posting it!

This was easy and fabulous!  I wanted a mint flavored glaze so I used white chocolate chips and 1 tsp peppermint extract plus 6-8 drops of green food coloring.  I took this to work for a co-workers birthday and everyone raved about it.  I can't wait to try the chocolate version as the recipe is written!  This was super easy to make and also easy to work with!

You know how good & gooey the chocolate chips are when cookies come right out of the oven & you can hardly wait till they are cool enough to eat? This is that yummy goo in a pot!  I used gharidelli chips & it was a little flat, so I added about 1/4 c Nestle chips, 1 1/2 TBS cocoa & pinch of salt. the cake's still in the oven, I hope the glaze lasts till it can go on the cake!

This glaze is fabulous! VERY quick to make. I just wish it didn't make so much.  It was way more than I needed for my bundt cake.  I kept adding more and more to the cake-- it was a bottomless pit of glaze!  But oh so good!  I give it a 10!

This was soooo good, and super easy.  I let it sit off the heat for five minutes before pouring over the cake, and it was the perfect consistancy. The taste is incredible.

This worked terrifically.  I made two batches, but realized after I started the second batch that I didn't have semi-sweet choc chips.  I substituted 1 cup of white choc chips, and added two 1 oz. squares of unsweeting baking chocolate.  The results were wonderful!  What a great recipe!  Thanks!!

Easy to make and very good! I may try different kinds of chips next time such as milk chocolate/peanut butter. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used a glaze on a chocolate bundt cake I love to make! I usually don't use any glaze or frosting, but decided to try it. If you love chocolate, you can't go wrong with this!! Next time I will probably make only half of the recipe as I had almost half of it left over after icing my cake!

This glaze was very good! Easy to make with ingredients on hand. I will make again. I, too, didn't wait long enough for it to cool. next time I will. For this one, patience yields better rewards.

Mmm, definitely 5 stars!  I used the microwave (medium setting) and it took 2 minutes, stirring after each minute, and it worked fine, but it was almost bubbling so be careful if you use the microwave as well.  I made this to go over Lisa's Chocolate Chocolate Chip cake from this site.  I also used white chocolate (as I was trying to make a fancy cake for Valentine's Day).  Only problem is that I was impatient and didn't wait for it to cool so a good portion of it ran off the cake.  Good thing I used Martha Stewart's trick of putting wax paper pieces under the cake sides to keep it looking clean.  I ended up serving the leftover glaze along with the cake. I will definitely make this again.

very good glaze, but you have to wait for it to cool about 5 minutes because if not it will be a thin glaze and a pool on your plate LOL, check out my photo! youll see!, just wait for it to thicken a bit. then pour. i will make this again because it is so yummy! i used semisweet chocolate but thought of using milk, i didnt because i thought it could turn out too sweet, however if you make a ganache and use milk chocolate. THAT IS THE BOMB! LOOK UP CHOCOLATE GANACHE IN THIS SITE!

I used cocoa powder instead and it made the mixture way too hard, so then i added spoonfuls of milk until I got to the desires consistency. Left it refrigerated for about 12 hours and was still soft and yummy. Will probably use less cocoa powder next time as it was incredibly chocolatey. Still, will definitely use this recipe again, thanks.

Very easy and very rich.  I think this one would be great to use with white chocolate or peanut butter chips...maybe chocolate mint, too.  I used it over the Too Much Chocolate Cake from this site for a large crowd of high school students who loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

THIS IS TRULY THE BEST CHOCOLATE FROSTING I'VE EVER TASTED!!! I'm glad the calorie count didn't show up cause I was eating the leftover with a spoon! I used it on a bundt cake - had way too much - but continued to slowly pour it on thick cause I knew the girls at work would LOVE! Also because I couldn't stop eating it and couldn't bare throwing it away!! Thanks so much for such a simple yet delicious recipe. Using white chocolate chips sounds interesting - will have to give it a try!
Update: I've been using this wonderful recipe every chance I get - Now I use it to make the Best Fudge Ever. The only thing different is to use 3 cups Chips + 1/4 cup Butter...and maybe a pinch of Salt. Add nuts if desired. It fits nicely into a 8X8" pan :)

This is amazing!!!  I was looking for a recipe to fill a chocolate cake with a fudge-like filling.  When I saw this I decided to try it.  The only thing I changed was I added 1/2 C more chocolate chips.  Then I let it set for about an hour before filling the cake with it.  Kids and hubby love it!  Will definately be using this one again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was okay, it tasted better after it cooled. I used hershey's semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I might try a different brand next time.

Excellent flavor, super easy, and lots left over. Made for my boss's bday chocolate bundt cake. only made 3/4 of recipe (scaled to the amount of milk in the can), and still had about half left over. Will store in fridge and warm to use on my next cake!

So easy, so fast, sooooo good.  I will find many uses for this besides bundt cake.  Forget buying hot fudge in a jar. This will totally do the trick on ice cream too.

This recipe is super easy and is SO MUCH better than any store bought frosting.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly.... I loved it, but found it a bit too sweet.  This time I made it to top a chocolate chip bundt pound cake---I used what I had on hand: fat-free sweetened condensed milk & bittersweet Ghirardelli choc. chips.  I didn't use the vanilla, as I was out of it.  It came out so delicious and less sweet, and had a rich, velvety texture.  I would make it this way from now on!

I am not a cake baker but made this recipe to top cupcakes for my SIL.  Hubby gave it 5 stars right off the bat.  Said it was yummy.  Needless to say as I don't bake, this recipe was kind of like "frosting for dummies"  very easy.  Thank you for posting and making my life soooo much easier

Not chocolatey enough even though I added 50% more (Nestle) chocolate chips than called for.  I gave it an extra star because it was easy but this recipe makes enough for 2 or 3 bundt cakes.

great chocolate glaze, very easy to make. I used the microwave to melt the ingredients, only took 2 min. stir to combine, microwave for 1  min, stir again microwave another min, stir add vanilla and done! this recipe does make a lot and I am not aware of how well or how long this keeps, but it sure is good and can be used in lots of ways you can think of.  jwildman

I wasn't crazy about this - the flavor was not "dark chocolate" enough for my tastes, and it was a bit too runny, even though I let it cool sufficiently.  Does not present a glossy finish.  Sorry, I'll stick to the powdered sugar recipe from now on!

Cannot say enough nice things about this recipe.. I went to the grocery store last night and bought everything for my chocolate cake and frosting....except the confectioners sugar... ugh..  Well, This recipe totally saved me from another trip out and OMG, it was fabulous.What a blessing.

I have a fear of melting chocolate because out of the 10 times I have tried, it has been a disaster. This recipe, the chocolate chips started melting right away and the whole thing just turned into nice creamy glaze. Beautiful.. I am so thankful I found this! Endless possibilities!

Very easy to make, and got great marks for taste.  This was enough for several cakes, so I had quite a bit of waste.  It was also dull and wrinkly when it dried, but that was easily fixed with a layer of chocolate chips.  :-)

This made a great glaze for a chocolate zucchini bundt cake. I used a little unsweetened chocolate with the semi-sweet, and coffee syrup instead of vanilla extract, to make it a darker taste. Then I used white chocolate chips, thinned it a little with a tbsp of veg oil, and drizzled it for appearances. Beautiful!

This is delicious and VERY easy and quick.  All ingredients I had on hand.  I used a chocolate fudge cake mix and added some sliced strawberries with sugar to each slice of cake.  It was like a chocolate strawberry shortcake.  This is going in my favorites.

I just made this for a Christmas party at work. I didn't have time to bake anything so I bought a freshly baked chocolate bundt cake, drizzled it with this glaze and topped it with crushed candy canes. Seven minutes total from start to finish and it looks festive and like I worked all night! Since other reviewers mentioned that it makes so much glaze, I literally halved the recipe (1/2 can sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips with a dash of vanilla). Made the perfect amount of glaze and now I have condensed milk to make more glaze for another cake next week! Great recipe!

This stuff ROCKS!!  I usually throw away leftover frosting...not with this stuff, no siree.  The leftovers have been carefully safeguarded in the freezer for later.   I made this to go over the Black Magic Cake recipe that is also on this site.  The cake was a huge hit at my Halloween party.

Delicious and EASY!  I used this glaze on chocolate cupcakes which were filled with vanilla frosting.  I just needed a simple topping and this was it.  I made it in the microwave and just dipped the cupcakes in the bowl to coat the tops.  It dries in a shiny, thin coat.  Great for packing up cupcakes, too...no worries about the frosting coming off.

i use this recipe to make fudge - using these same ingredients, you just add the entire bag of chocolate chips instead of only 1 cup. this glaze was delicious, although it was a little difficult to reheat & didn't keep for more than 1-2 days in the fridge. thanks!

Nice glaze.  What it really reminded me of was the chocolate frosting of a donut at a bakery.  Even the hubby said it.  What I really enjoy best was it is a very versatile glaze and I can put almost any flavor in it.  I thought I had vanilla, but didn't.  I put in a little Amaretto Liqueur.  It was still yummy.

This glaze is amazing!  It tastes like fudge!  I ate the leftovers by the spoonful.  =)  The only two times I've made it, I've used it to glaze Death by Chocolate V from this site--the two are very rich together, but my family and I love it that way.

This is exactly why I love this site.  I'm trying to use up holiday ingredients, and found this recipe.  This glaze is fudgey perfection, and absolutely perfect for cupcakes.  (Dipping them, you had to do the wrist twist, as it's kinda sticky - but it sets up beautifully)  Finishes with a beautiful sheen.

Very good glaze for Bundt cake. I substituted half the chocolate chips with Nutella and it is delicious.

This recipe was very easy and yummy.I suggest heating your cake w/glaze in the microwave the day after baking so that it tastes "freshly made"

did it in the microwave, and didn't use the vanilla because I didn't have any :)...love the easiness as much as the sweetness. I poured it over the Chocaroon Cake by Star Pooley. Thanks :)

This was a great glaze for the Too Much Chocolate Cake bundt cake.  I made a mistake and added two cups of choco chips, one semi-sweet and one milk choc, it was very thick.  I removed the pan from the heat before they were all melted and glaze the cake and the little soft unmelted choco chips were a hit.  I got so many compliments on the glaze.  Please use this recipe, it's great.

This was so easy, I wanted to try something that diddnt involve powdered sugar.  I put this on the Too much chocolate cake recipe I got off this site.
This glaze complemented the cake, it wasnt to thick or runny, I used wax paper under a cooling rack that the cake was sitting on and cleanup was a breeze. This makes quite a bit of glaze, I diddnt use it all, I wanted just a bit of glaze to run over the top and sides and this worked beautifully. I saved the extra so I could drizzle over ice cream.

I would definitely make it again, but it was really thick, even right after melting it. I was afraid of burning it though, so that might have hurt it. But I would definitely use this as a hot sundae chocolate sauce. Also I adding a bit more vanilla because it just tasted like melted chocolate chips, and that helped. Only about half a teaspoon more though.

A+ recipe! It’s a keeper. Simple ingredients I already had on hand. I used real vanilla extract since it wouldn’t be cooked but I’d love to see if it is just as good with imitation.

This was a very convenient recipe.  I needed glaze for my mini bundt cakes for a Bake Sale.  I  drizzled the chocolate glaze on the mini bundts, then put them in the refrigerator, to firm up the glaze.  That made it easier to put each one in a plastic sandwich bag.  It was very sweet.

This was absolutely delicious! If I'm rating a recipe, I rate it as written. Personally, I wouldn't change a thing.  Simple and delicious. I put it on the Six (6) Egg Pound Cake recipe found here on allrecipes, which is also a great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I used this with "Too Much Chocolate" bundt cake.  It couldn't be more delicious, and so easy!  Nice and shiny.  It was a bit too much, really, but I managed to gobble up the extra glaze with a spoon.

Made this yesterday to glaze the Chocolate Lovers Bundt Cake.  While it tasted great - it wrinkled.  I poured it over the completely cooled cake but :30 later it took on a wrinkled appearance.  Still tasted delicious!

This was delicious!!!  I had to add a lot of flour on the counter as I kneaded it to get it not a gooey mess, but the texture was super smooth doing it that way as opposed to just adding more flour to the mix.  They are delicious!  I did add a dash of cinnamon because I am a cinnamon junkie.  haha!  The centers I cut out were perfect donut holes too.  My first attempt at frying donuts (or anything, really), and it turned out PERFECTLY.  Thanks for the recipe!

Eh. I made this icing last night, and was disappointed with it. I figured it'd be sweet, despite the semi-sweet chocolate chips, but between that sweetness and the consistency of it, I  don't plan on making this again.

Perfection! You will find yourself eating your cake slice first, so you can save all of the glazed top for last.I licked my fork clean then inspected it to make sure I hadn't missed any. If you find fault with this recipe, just turn in your chocolate lover's card right now.

Very good recipe.  My only complaint was the fact that it lost its shine.  I added to a chocolate cake and once it set it looked very dull and unappealing.  I gave it a 5 star because the taste is worth it just not the look.

this was exactly what I was searching the web for an hour for....
My chocolate cake kinda fell out of the bundt pan (i turned it too soon) and I spent the day salvaging it....
Needed a chocolate  drizzle and this was perfect!
I did add coffee and cinnamon.
Fudgy and shiny.... turns out this is my mom's recipe ....
thanks!!!!!!

Worked great!  More fudgey than glaze.  Wait until it cools a bit before putting on the cake or it will run right off!  I added a pinch of salt to cut the sweetness.  As others have said... This is enough for 2 bundt cakes.  Keep the rest for ice-cream topping or for brownies.

Simple and delicious.  Used Ghirardelli dark chocolate pieces and whipping cream.  Heated the cream in the microwave and poured over the choc pieces.  Used the ganache for a topping for a choc bundt cake.  Delicious!!

Delectable!  Caution, if you don't have it at the right temperature when melting it will be grainy. My advice is to follow the directions to a T. Mine was on the verge of a boil ,but I was able to save the glaze in time! This was easy,and delicious over my from scratch brownie recipe! Yummy!

Made this to top a boxed swiss chocolate cake made with hot coffee instead of water. It was the best boxed chocolate cake combination! Glaze set nicely and cake was good warmed up with chocolate ice cream on the side.

This turned out great. I used 1/2 semi sweet chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips. It did make a TON so I had left overs that I used for chocolate covered pretzels.

Outstanding and super easy. I cooked it in the microwave 30 seconds at a time ( 2 minutes total) and stirred at each 30 sec interval. It makes enough for two cakes probably. But it is so good I was eating it with a spoon. I used it for the AR Too Much Chocolate Cake. Will definitely use it again.

Super easy and soooooo yummy. Hubby wouldn't let me share the cake with anybody bc he loves this glaze so much. I made 3 batches to pour over slices of cake. I don't enjoy powdered sugar;  it has a strange aftertaste. This is a fabulous alternative.  Thanks for sharing ??

I LOVE this glaze!!!  So easy, so beautiful, so fudgy!  I've tried others and have had semi-success... but this is no fail!  It is the perfect thickness - smooth enough to drizzle beautifully,  but sets up like chocolate fudge.  YUM!  I will come back to this recipe again and again! It is more than enough for 1 cake - and I actually glazed 2 bundt cakes for a bake sale with this recipe, and even had a few spoonfuls left for myself!

It turned out great, exactly according to the recipe. Another user reported it cracked on the cake, but I didn't have that experience. It did make twice as much as necessary for a regular-sized bundt cake. Good news, in my mind, because it tastes amazing. I imagine the flavor and quality of chocolate  chips might play a part in how smooth and flavorful it turns out.  I used Ghirardelli semisweet chocolate. My kid said it tastes like the chocolate in lava cakes. The consistency is more icing-like than lava cake filling.

This was easy to make and was chocolatey, but I think the texture threw me off.  Not the kind of chocolate drizzle I thought it would be.

This was so easy and so delicious! I made it in the microwave. I mixed mini chips and the sweetened condensed milk in a small bowl and microwaved on high for 30 seconds. Stirred well and put in for another 10 seconds. I have an 800 watt microwave. It does make enough for at least two cakes, depending on how much you like on your cake, of course.

A little too thick and heavy to be called a glaze and it clumped.  Tasted fine but I'll look for something lighter next time.

i forgot the vanilla so it had a very deep cocoa taste still good. i was just afraid it would be too sweet from the condensed milk but suprisingly it was not too sweet at all.

This glaze was perfect! I put it on top of donuts! I have read reviews saying it didn't set well and wasn't glossy. I beg to differ. The donuts look like they came from a donut shop! For those who didn't have this experience I would try it again. You must not have followed the recipe close enough. Thank you for this recipe it will most certainly be a go to for me!

The taste is ok but when this glaze dries it becomes hard and didn't add moisture to my cake. My husband said when first mixed the taste reminded him of a cadbury egg. As another reviewer mentioned, it also is dull and does not have any sheen. I tried adding a little corn syrup for shine but it didn't help. Maybe you could add some butter? Nonetheless it won't be my go to glaze for bundt cakes because it did not add moisture like bundt cake glaze should. Perhaps it would be better on top of some already moist brownies.

I wanted to keep this dairy free, so replaced the condensed milk with Rich's Whip. The glaze is rich and delicious, but rather runny. Next time, I'd use only half the amount of liquid.

Excellent! Smooth & tasty, easy to make and not all the fat of using a buttercream frosting. Next time I will use some unsweetened chocolate with just half bittersweet chips due to the condensed milk being so sweet. Hubby loved it, so I'm happy. Thank you for the great recipe.

I have never been able to make a decent frosting other than a ganache. This is my new favorite! 
I had made a box chocolate bundt cake with mint chips and wanted to do a chocolate frosting so tried this one. For the chocolate I took another persons suggestions and put in 3 individual wrapped pieces of unsweetened bakers chocolate (it was all I had left of the package) and a handful of the nestles mint chocolate chips. It was wonderful! It stayed smooth and soft and everyone loved it. I also toasted some almond slices to add to the top.
 It made a little extra on a bundt cake but I would rather have too much than not enough and I didn't mind licking the bowl!

I've made this  multiple times & LOVE it!  I like to add just a little sea salt to really bring out the chocolate flavor.  This is  such a versatile glaze & the recipe makes a large amount . Any extra glaze keeps nicely refrigerated in a mason jar~

This recipe makes too much glaze for one cake. I refrigerated the leftover glaze and then reheated it and poured it over ice cream. I actually liked it better that way over using it as a cake glaze. As a cake glaze, it was only mediocre.

This was great! Took the advice of another reviewer and used olive oil instead of shortening. I also used 1/3 cup olive oil and 1/3 cup apple sauce, substituted one of the cups of sugar with Truvia (Stevia), and added 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon. So moist and satisfying!

I made this for a 9x13 chocolate  cake and it was wonderful.  I  just poured the cooled glaze over the slightly cooled cake.  It spread out evenly and looked  fantastic.  I will definitely make this again and experiment with different flavored chips and extracts.

I just tried this recipe for the first time and was impressed at how easy it was to make and how intense the chocolate flavor was with the condensed milk. As with everything I make that has chocolate as an ingredient, I always add 1 tsp instant espresso to the recipe and the flavor is more intense. Loved it!

Love this recipe. So simple and can be varied easily. I read one review that said it did not set up well but I have never had a problem. It gets firm & shiny every time. I have used it on my bundt cakes but decided to do it on a 13 x 9 cake today. It looks fantastic. It's thicker than most other glazes I have used but I like that. Highly recommend.

Wonderful :)  Has that nice velvety texture as you pour it on, and then it dries very shiny and presentable without being crusty.  And of course it tastes great! Will definitely make this again!

Devilishly, Scrumptious Delicious!!
Just two things: 1) I would possibly use  less chocolate or at least not use it all until I do a taste test. 2)  recipe is way too much for just one cake.  Not to worry though, I'm planning to use a heaping spoon in my morning coffee until it's all gone!

Easy recipe and tastes very good.  The second time I used it I added about 1/3 cup more semi-sweet choco chips for a darker chocolate flavor.

Very simple. I wasn't really looking for a fudge consistency but more of a creamy chocolate consistency but boy does it have a great taste. Reminded me of the icing on the Entenmenn's yellow cake with fudge icing cake sold in grocery stores.  I would definitely use recipe again.

This is the perfect glaze for a bunt cake. is is satiny smooth and creamy. it only took about 30 seconds in the microwave to melt the chocolate in the milk. it set up perfectly not to stiff not to sticky and thin.

This was delicious, but I will caution you to adhere strickly to the instructions that say heat the saucepan on medium heat.  I didn't think my chips were melting enough, so I turned the heat up and burnt the chocolate.  It still tasted good, but it was more of a spreadable hot fudge texture as opposed to a glaze. :/  Ooops.  My bad.  But it's still fabulous tasting!

I needed a glaze that was quick and simple, but still delicious. This fit all those bills. My daughter and I test tasted it and didn't want to save any for the cake! Very fantastic. I would say that you must be a real chocolate lover, but if you are, you are in for a treat! Yummy!

This is a  great recipe! It's very fudgy and rich. Love how easy it is and how it only calls for a handful of ingredients! My only suggestion is to add just a teeny pinch of salt...it really brings out the flavor. It's great without it too, though.

I used this for "German chocolate cake I" as a drizzle to connct the coconut spread and the chocolate icing on the side. It was sooo good! I chose Ghirardelli chips to contrast the milk chocolate icing.

This is good! I had to use a Dove Dark Chocolate Bunny instead of chips (what I had) and I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it wasn't. I wish it were slightly thicker, but it seems to set up okay. Taste is great.

Super easy and fast.  I will definitely use this recipe if ever out of powdered sugar and need frosting.  Great substitute, however I still prefer the taste of real frosting.

Perfect, perfect, perfect!  So smooth and yummy. But it does make a LOT of glaze. But luckily I needed it for two different things so it was fine. If you only need it for one cake though, probably go with a half recipe.

I really liked this recipe.  It was quick AND easy to make.  I would definitely make this again.  It makes a lot, so, I would recommend only making half.  Next time I may try substituting white chocolate chips or milk chocolate chips for the semisweet.

One hour to make an impromptu birthday cake for a little friend turning 7.  Used Pillsbury Devil's Food cake mix for chocolate Bundt cake.  I made this glaze using Ghiradelli semisweet chips, and oh boy, did it spruce up the cake.  Served a tad warm and the cake was a delicious hit!  Thanks!

Couldn't be easier.  If you want to up the chocolate fix in this, use 1/2 cup semi-sweet and 1/2 cup bittersweet (60% cacao).  For the most particular dark chocolate fan, put this on top of the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe on this site.

I wanted a ganache for cupcakes I made, but I didn't have the cream. So I tried this. This is amazing! I drizzled it on the cupcakes and with the remainder I drizzled it on fresh strawberries. Amazing! Thank you for sharing!

WOW!!!  I just made this glaze to put on an eggless chocolate cake from this site. Never tried either recipe before. No doubt no one will notice if the cake isn't all that good because this glaze will make it amazing ! Very quick and very easy to make. I'll be using this many more times. Thanks for sharing !

Yummy and very easy!  Without thinking, I purchased fat free sweetened condensed milk.  One of the reviews I read said it didn't set up for them using the fat free sweetened condensed milk, but I had no problems.  Thank you for the great recipe.

Soo yummy. I wish I had waited a little longer to grizzle over cake. Most of it ended up on the plate. Yummy fudgy gooey mess.

4 stars for easiness- but not sure about taste. It was a little sweet to me- and believe me, I love sweet. It was almost too easy of a recipe, if that's possible. I felt like it just wasn't very special.

I gave this 5 stars because it tasted great.  But it turned to fudge on the cake.  I followed recipe exactly so don't know what went wrong.  It was like a thick layer of pure fudge that fell off when I cut a piece of cake.  In fact Eagle Brand has a fudge mix that you mix just like this.  I wish someone could tell me what I did wrong because I really like the taste.

I used this to top off the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe also found on this site.  It made more glaze than I really needed to top a bundt cake.  It was really rich, and super delicious!

Excellent glaze for brownies. I made extra large cookie sheets with 2 boxes brownie mix, poured a thin layer of this glaze on top. Everyone loved the brownies. This glaze also keeps nicely in the refrigerator, if you don't use all of it. I put the leftover glaze into a plastic container with lid, and 3 weeks after making it to glaze a bundt cake, melted the glaze in the microwave (watch closely) and used on top of the brownies. It was still as good as the day it was made 3 weeks earlier.

Those who ate this agreed - delcious!  I used it on Easy Dump Cake found on this site.  I used Devil's Food cake mix in place of the yellow, so the whole thing was a chocolate dream!!!  Like the way it "set up," but remained soft.  Also like the texture and thickness - just divine.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

This glaze is as the name says - easy - but it was a lot thicker than I expected.  I ended up cooking it too long and caused the sugar to begin to crystallize because I was trying to get it to pouring consistency.  I ended up having to pour it through a sieve to get the sugar flecks out and then it was still very thick and ended up looking like I melted some icing to drizzle over the cake which isn't exactly what I was looking for.  I think next time, I'll only use half the condensed milk, and add some evaporated milk to it.  It tastes good though.

I hate to put a damper on this recipe, but it didn't work for me. I followed it exactly and yet, the chocolate didn't melt perfectly smoothly, with tiny pieces of chocolate chips still discernable to a knowing palate. I did not begin mixing immediately upon adding the chips, and perhaps therein lies the folly. Since the chocolate didn't mix in well enough, the mixture was thin. I added more chocolate chips, but it still did not thicken adequately. It made a nice chocolate sauce, but definitely not a ganache.

This is easy, fast and tastes great, what else could you want? I used mostly semi sweet chips with a handful of milk chocolate. I was afraid 100% milk chocolate would be overwhelmingly sweet (but I might try it some time to find out for sure.) It sets up nice and firm, I can cover my cake without losing all the glaze where the plastic wrap sits, which is very nice.

Fabulous, quick and easy!  I always have the ingredients on hand.  I used this on bundt cakes (box mix) for a bake sale and whipped up three in no time!  I also poked holes in the cake(with a chop stick) but not very deep so the holes would fill with glaze.

Fudgy and yummy...I could eat this by the spoonful!!!  I used milk chocolate chips with low fat sweetened condensed milk (like it matters based on the cake with the icing, lol!!).  It turned out just wonderfully...used it to frost Sandy's Chocolate Cake from this site.  Oh so good!

DLISH!  So so easy to make!  Next time I will try to add a little flavored liquor instead of the vanilla. I poured it over the Cavity Maker Chocolate Cake from this site while it was still hot!!!

I'm not a fan of using corn syrup in my cooking, so I was VERY pleased to find that this recipe does not call for it.  I like that this is thicker like a frosting but beautiful and glossy as the word "glaze" would indicate.  This has got to be hands down the best use for a can of condensed milk!

I made this with Lisa's Chocolate Chocolate Chip cake from this site, drizzled it over the warm cake, it was easy to make and tasted milk chocolatey and amazing! Will make again.

I used this glaze on "Chocolate Fudge Pound Cake" from this site. It went together very easily and firmed up on the cake after about 30 minutes. OH, BTW I baked the pound cake in a sheet cake pan. I'll be using this glaze again; maybe I'll vary the flavors: white chocolate, peanut butter, butterscotch. Any kind of chips would probably work well in this recipe.

My husband says this is the best chocolate icing/glaze he's ever had. I certainly can't argue because it's the easiest thing I've ever made!

Just made this glaze to put over a diet brownie recipe using only brownie mix and pumpkin, it lacked something, so i made this with fat free sweetened condensed milk and only put a couple of tablespoons of this glaze, it is fantastic. almost the whole glaze left over to put on more stuff.

This was a great glaze, though I used it over a bundt cake I think this would be great over several other desserts or pancakes.  Thanks for the post.

This was pretty good.  Nothing to write home about though.
