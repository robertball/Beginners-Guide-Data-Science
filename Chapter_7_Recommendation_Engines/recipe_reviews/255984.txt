Simple and delicious! The brand of frosting that I bought was the Pillsbury(R) brand and, in fact, the recipe can be found on the back of the label on the tub. I suggest cooking this at 30 second intervals, because mine only took about 1-1/2 minutes to be fully melted, so just keep an eye on that. Really great combo of flavors and textures, and very creamy too. I will def be making this for the holidays~YUM!Thanks for sharing. :)
