First Souffles I had ever tried.  I halved the recipe and went with 3 eggs instead of the 5.  Used two larger souffle dishes, as I don't have the small 6 that are called for.  The Souffle puffed nicely, and tasted very good.  Tried the next time using the suggested larger souffle bowl and full amount of eggs.  Substituted with about 10 oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips and left out the sugar in the eggs to compensate.  Cooked it a lot longer than the suggested time, but kept it with the wiggle in the middle.  Perfection!!!

Made this recipe to a T and it was not very good at all.  I wouldn't recommend this one.
