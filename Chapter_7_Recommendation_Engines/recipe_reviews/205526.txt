I've never cooked with lavender but was curious. And I don't care for plain avocado (although I love a good chunky guacamole - go figure), but this recipe intrigued me. I tasted a lavender bud and thought it was quite strong, so I heated the milk and steeped the lavender in the milk overnight, then discarded the buds. This gave the milk a nice light lavender taste and no crunchy buds. I added a cup of chopped pecans for texture, which came out really good. One of my "guinea pigs" loved the bread, and so did I, It came out just a tad tangy and completely delicious. I also made one 9"x 5" and three mini loaves for sharing. Next time I make it I might just go hog wild and leave the buds in. Thanks!

Really good - it's an unusual combination of flavours but they work really well together. Everyone who has tried it loves it! I only used 2 teaspoons of lavender (crushed in a mortar and pestle) rather than 2 tablespoons, and the flavour was great - I'm not sure if I would use much more lavender than that. Maybe crushing the flowers released the flavour a little?

When I first saw the recipe I thought it was weird but had to try it. Finding the spice lavdnder is not easy but I found it at Central Market in the bulk spice section. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great and really moist. My co workers even liked it. The only thing I would recommend is eating this in the winter with some hot tea.

Soooooo good.  I used about one tablespoon of fresh lavender, and could hardly taste it.  I will get gutsy and increase the amount quite a bit next time!  This would also be tasty with a light lemon glaze over the top.

Very moist.  The lavender can be over-powering at first so the bread taste better chill.  Could cut down on sugar a little too.

This is the first time I have ever baked with Avocado AND Lavender so I was pleased with the outcome! Just a tip though, I didnt have dried lavender, I only had the fresh stuff right out of my garden. After some research while the bread was in the oven, I discovered fresh lavender is much less potent comparecd to the dry stuff. In conclusion, my bread had a very very faint lavender taste, next time I will dry my stocks or use more fresh stuff! :) Thanks for the recipe!

Very interesting. I love cooking with lavendar, and after reading all the other reviews decided to add a little bit more to the bread - it was too much. Lavendar can be overpowering, so try it first with only what the recipe calls for. Otherwise this was a winner and I will make it again.

I made this for a directors meeting for a parish charity.  Usually they each take a small serving, eat one or two bites and they're done. Not today!  They were practically fighting over the last piece.  I followed the recipe very closely.  I did cut the sugar to 1 1/3 cup and used just one avocado which was just slightly more than 1 cup so I added 1/2 cup plain yogurt.  It still was sweet enough and very moist.  The lavender smelled great while baking and just imparted enough flavor so you knew it was there.  I will make this again for sure.

I was a bit skeptical about how avocado would taste with the lemon and lavender. It is wonderful. The avocado makes this loaf very moist without adding an avocado flavor. The lemon and lavender blend perfectly together and leave a very subtle, fresh aftertaste in your mouth. 

This recipe would be perfect to serve in B&B's, coffee shops, etc.

This cake was so delicious and perfumed!  I did not have dried lavender so I used lavender essential oil (just 3 drops) and then added a lemon zest glaze to the finished cakes.  They were so delicious that everyone had seconds!
We also made the cakes vegan by replacing the eggs with egg replacer, the butter with oil, and the milk with steamed (in the microwave) mashed apple.  While the texture may have been slightly more dense in the end, it was still a crowd-pleaser!
Seems like no matter how you do it up, this recipe is a spring/summer/early fall winner!

Attempt #2. I opted to infuse the milk with the lavender buds (let it simmer over low heat for about 10 mins) instead of mixing them into the batter. I also went for lime juice and zest in lieu of lemon this time around, as that flavour compliments avocados rather nicely as well. Not something I would make often despite liking it very much, but a great way to use those avocados that get a little over-ripe.

Mine was dry with too strong of a lavender flavor for my liking.  Think I'll stick to lavender lemonade.

The first time I made this bread it was a disaster, because I used truvia baking mix. The second time this bread was amazing! I added a quarter teaspoon of lemon extract, for a bit more lemon zing, and cut the lavender in half, but crushed it before adding to the batter.

Nice light bread. But I could barely taste or smell the lavender. I cut back on the sugar to 1 cup.

This is so delicious!  I just bought culinary lavender and wanted a good recipe.  It was a refreshing, delicious flavor.  Even my very picky son thought it was tasty.

As soon as I saw this recipe I was intrigued! I love all these flavors separately but I'd never thought to put them all together in a bread. I made this recipe as-is except I had to sub the dairy ingredients as I have a family member who is vegan. I did the following subs: 1/8c original flavor applesauce per 1egg, 1/3c olive oil for 3/4c butter, original flavor coconut milk for cows milk. I didn't crush the Lavender like other posters mentioned but I think if I did it would be a more significant taste than it is. I initially thought I didn't need an electric mixer (I make bread all the time and just use arm muscle) but this recipe needs it! Also, I suggest using very ripe avocado to save yourself some time mixing and mashing. Since I ended up using the elec. mixer at the end, i don't think it quite mixed the way it should BUT the bread is still super tasty and has that yummy crunch ok the outside with moist bread on inside. A def keeper! Next time, i think I will sub cows milk for rice milk and see if that is closer to the flavor it needs; the coconut milk gives it a slightly sweeter flavor but, again, it tastes really good so I don't mind it :)

My family really enjoyed this avocado-take on a lemon loaf!!! The avocado added some incredible moistness and colour and the hint of lavender created the perfect flavour. I would definitely make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Perhaps it was the avocado, but this turned out very moist. I made muffins instead of a loaf (25 minutes in the oven). I used three mashed avocados and two lemons with their zest. I have to say I couldn't really taste the lemon very well, so next time I might even use three. I would also top the muffins with turbinado sugar to give it a pretty decorative crunch.  The lavender was intriguing to everyone who tried it, and no one thought it was overpowering. This is a make again recipe. Thank you.

Better than I expected.  I used 1 tablespoon of dried lavender because that's all I had,  but ground it with mortar and pestle. I also added walnuts for texture.  

I'll make this again and again.

I had to know what this tasted like. Husband and I agreed it was 'different' and at first he said it smelled savoury, and I said "I think you're going for 'floral'" and he agreed. Very moist, not 'avocadoey' (though I love avocado so that would have been fine). I added half the called-for lavender based on other comments. All in all, a tasty loaf for any season, and a nice change from the usual.

Excellent and different flavor with some healthful ingredients.
