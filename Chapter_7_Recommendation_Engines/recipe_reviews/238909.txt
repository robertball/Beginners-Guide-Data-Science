We've always had prosciutto & melon. I love the idea of putting them on a skewer, much more presentable for a party. Thanks

This was a huge hit at the bridal shower for which I made it. It is simple, yet elegant! I'm making it again for a gathering this week.

I did love this summer time snack. but I don't do prosciutto at all. so I used ham off of the bone it comes from the giant's super
market it is yummy.

This was very good.  Only thing the artichoke hearts fell of some of the skewers, but other than that, it was a hit.  Would make ahead.

It was too much stuff on the stick for one mouthful I would go with only melon or one grape but it looks great for presentation
