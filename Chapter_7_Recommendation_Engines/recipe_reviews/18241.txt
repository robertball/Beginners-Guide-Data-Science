These were delicious.  I made them ahead of time by boiling them, draining the water and adding the butter and brown sugar.  I didn't add any pepper.  Before serving, I put them in the oven to warm them up and thicken the sauce.  Delicious.

I steamed the carrots instead of boiling them.  Instead of turning the heat to low after adding the sauce ingredients, I recommend turning the heat up a bit and cooking until the sauce reduces and carmelizes...just be sure to stir it frequently to keep it from burning.  This way all the good sauce stays on the carrots instead of in the pan.  I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper...I like a sweet/hot combination.  Really very good!

Great recipe!  I left out the pepper and added a little cinnamon instead.  It was a huge hit and is sure to become a staple at the dinner table.

Made these for this years Thanksgiving dinner.  Sauce was a little runny so I added a little corn starch to thicken it up and that seemed to work.  I also added a few drops of honey cause it just seemed to lack a little something to me.  Recipe didn't specify which type of brown sugar to use so I used dark but next time I will try light brown.  Thanks for sharing.

I used baby carrots for this recipe.  I really liked the taste of the glaze but wish it had been a touch thicker.  I guess that could be accomplished with a pinch of cornstarch.

I have been making this for a year on this website. I just now finally signed up to rate this. THIS IS THE BEST Carrot recipe EVER! I highly recommend. 
Shortcuts I make are using bagged cut up carrots, I microwave them, then put them in a pan with the butter and brown sugar. I do not add any of the other ingredients.. I just keep it simple and they are always eaten up! Thanks for this recipe!!

These carrots are wonderful. I sliced carrots on the diagonal about 1/4 inch thick, plunged them in salted boiling water for about 2 minutes, drained, then tossed them in a fry pan that had the butter and sugar already melted together. I cooked another minute or two, seasoned with the salt and pepper and they were good to go with just a slight crunch to them! Fast and fabulous. My dinner guests begged for the recipe!

Love these carrots!  I nuked mine in the microwave to the desired done-ness, then added the brown sugar and butter for another minute or two.  Simple and yummy!

Sometimes simple is truly best.  Right before serving I put them under the broiler to help caramelize the sugar.  You'll have to watch them closely and give them a shake every minute or two to ensure they don't burn.  Simply delicious!  Thanks Denyse for the lovely recipe!

Delicious! You may want to increase the quantity, though - 2 adults and a 2 year old finished it and wanted more.

This is a great recipe! The carrots are very easy to make, and my family gobbled them up! This is a wonderful recipe to use to get children to eat more veggies. The only thing I found wrong with this recipe is the amount of time listed to cook the carrots; mine cooked up in about 8 minutes instead of 20! Thanks for the recipe; it is delicious!

Used ingredient proportions as stated, but cooked in slow cooker.  I need to cook a LOT (for a party) while I was at work.  Increased recipe to 6 lbs carrots, added carrots and 1 c. water to slow cooker, and cooked for 6 hours on low.  Perfection!

These carrots are delicious! I made them in strips, as the recipe calls for. I also made a batch with slices from my food processor. As suggested, I let the butter and brown sugar mixture get thick and bubbly before I added the carrots. Now I make a double batch because they go so fast! We prefer sliced carrots because they hold more of the wonderful sauce.

I came across this recipe because I was looking for a "twist" on an old classic.  I have been making candied carrots similar to these for all of my 47 years as did my mother before me and my grandmother before her.   These are a staple in my house at the very least on Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter as they go deliciously with the Easter ham.

I use either baby carrots or regular carrots sliced 1/2" to 3/4" thick.  I also tend to use a lot more butter and a little more brown sugar and cook them a bit more to reduce the sauce just a tad.  You can also add a little bit of cinnamon and ground cloves or try adding maple syrup instead of the brown sugar.

For a lower calorie version (and since I have a daughter who is a diabetic), you can cut the butter by half and use orange juice or something similar.  You can also substitute sugar free maple syrup for the brown sugar.

After reading some of the reviews and knowing I would like a thicker sauce, I cooked the carrots till just barely tender, added a little honey to the sauce and baked them in a 350 oven for about an hour (I didn't time it, just waited till it looked thick and candied)
It was wonderfull

Excellent!  I generally make these the night before Thanksgiving to safe time, and they always are a huge hit.  I also try and hit up the farmers market to add in yellow carrots for a nice color contrast :)

My favorite way to fix carrots, although I do steam my carrots instead of boiling them.  It DOES make a difference.

Good recipe but I like my carrots a little crisper. 20 - 30 minutes is way too long to cook them. I added a little ginger and a tablespoon of orange juice to give the dish a little more flavor. I cooked the carrots ahead of time and mixed up the glaze and thickened it with a little corn starch. Then I mixed them together and microwaved them just before dinner.

Unable to rate recipe as it is written above because I made changes based on the existing reviews. I used 1 TBSP of butter instead of 2 TBSP so that glaze would be thicker. I also cut back on the sugar (to 2 TBSP) and added 1 TBSP of honey due to comments about the sweetness of the dish and added a pinch of ginger as suggested by other reviewer. I also added about a 1/2 tsp of lemon juice. The sweetness was spot-on. Couldn't stop eating them

I had previously made a candied carrots recipe that used more of a caramel sauce made of just butter and brown sugar.  It was a little too sweet for my taste so I was a little leery of trying this one.  However, I'm glad I did!  The salt and pepper made a huge improvement and the sauce wasn't so thick and sugary.  I will definitely be making this again and maybe tweak it by adding some additional spices to see what that does.

Yummy and easy--make it quicker by steaming the carrots (I used the steaming part of my slow cooker). Then added the other ingredients, microwaved it, then  stirred.

These were pretty good. They were high on flavor and a good amount of sweet. I would have liked a little more thickness to it though, but otherwise was just what I was looking for. I also used baby carrots due to lack of time and patience.

I used steam in bag carrots and added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  These were very good.

I omitted the pepper and added a little cinnamon along with a dash or two of nutmeg. I didn't put them back on the burner until sauce had gotten bubbly because then it seemed like the sauce would  get too thin. I just let the butter and sugar melt down and took them right off the stove, (very low heat).

I substituted baby carrots instead and it came out great.  I will definitely make this again, it was the perfect side dish to our holiday meal this past Christmas.

I loved this recipe! I did make a couple changes. I added a dash of both nutmeg and cinnamon. Also once I added the carrots back into the sauce mixture turned up the heat to reduce and thicken the sauce. Turned out fantastic!!

I would give this a 10 but can only go 5. I love it. The only thing I changed was sliced the carrots instead of having them 2". I will definitely make these again and again. Thank you so much for the recipe.

I put everything in a Ziploc steam bag and microwaved for six minutes. Easy clean-up and the carrots were perfect. I recommend using a bag of mini carrots for even easier preparation. A keeper that I will use in the future

Loved it with a few minor changes for my own taste: Much less brown sugar, added about 2 Tbsp to make them slightly sweet and my husband who dreaded even trying them, loved them ! Boiled baby carrots to start and after only maybe 7 minutes when they were al dente, drained them, threw them back in the same pot, added the butter and sugar and mixed them all together, simple!

Good, but bland. It felt like it was missing something. Maybe next time Ill try the cinnamon and cooking it longer on high to caramelize the sugar like others have mentioned. It was very easy. Only changes I did was to use baby carrots and to double it.

Simple and tasty. The brown sugar really brings out the sweetness of the carrots. I added a bit more salt and pepper than the recipe called for, but I loved it. The taste was subtle enough that I could just enjoy the veggies for what they are, too!

Great carrots. It's refreshing to have another vegetable side dish in our house other than green beans or broccoli. Very easy to save and re-heat.

this was my "healthy" veggie side dish at Christmas - I just steamed the carrots in a microwave baggie, for all of 7 minutes - then tossed them in the sauce.  YUMMY!  love it - and so simple!

These were super easy and super delicious!  I used Splenda brown sugar, which tastes great with only half the sugar.  They taste even better the next day after soaking up the butter and sugar.  Wish I had doubled the recipe!

Very easy and delicious! My boys ate every last bit. I ended up with quite a bit of extra sauce so next time I think I'll use half as much sugar / butter.

Easy to make, tender and tasty.  A GREAT way to eat carrots.  I used a 1 lb bag of baby carrots and there were none left.  This recipe is a keeper!!

So easy.  I use 1 pound baby carrots instead of chopping up regualr carrots.  They work perfectly and save time.  Everyone in my family loves this easy recipe.

Suggestion:  Omit the pepper, or use much less if you are unsure.  Also the sugar sauce never thickened, it was a bit too runny.

I fixed this for Easter and I was a great hit.  I scaled it up to feed 15 and it was still easy.  Even the kids who don't ordinarily eat carrots loved it.  Thanks for providing this on the wonderful site that is Allrecipes.com.

These are great!! I had never eaten candied carrots before; and they were so good, I almost didn't need the rest of the meal! My guests loved them, too. I was thinking of steaming the carrots next time, to keep them a bit more "crunchy". A little bit of cinnamon or nutmeg might be nice, too.

Tasty and sweet and easy to make!  For a potluck gathering I cut up approximately 4 lbs of carrots and made 4 times the sauce.  Cooked the carrots just to the point I could pierce with a fork, drained and set aside in my dutch oven.  Cooked the sauce separately, poured over carrots, covered and let them sit for a couple hours while I worked on other dishes.  Hour before dinner put them in the oven at low heat and then broiled for 5 - 10 minutes stirring often.  I drained the sauce and served, they were sweet and perfect and not mushy at all!  (Sauce is great to keep in the pot too if you like!!)

I admit that I used cinnamon instead of black pepper, as I thought it was a better combination. Boy, was I right! They were delicious, couldn't stop eating them. Maybe next time I will try the black pepper

We've had these delicious carrots twice now and we love them!  Even my picky boys that refuse to eat cooked carrots will gobble these down!  To make life easier, I use a 1-lb bag of baby carrots and cook them for 15-20 minutes.  Don't change a thing - the recipe is perfect as is!

This is a great recipe for candied carrots.  Only thing I did differently was add 2 tablespoons of Honey.  Everytime I make them, people ask for the recipe.

not a carrot fan to begin with, never eat them except small pieces in soups and salads...but I tried this recipe and it was very good!  This will be the only way for me to eat a full serving of carrots.  Thought the flavor was outstanding!  Paired them with maple and mustard glazed pork roast - very good!!  a definite keeper!

Made these tonight for my grandparents, and they absolutely loved them. I used frozen cut carrots and didn't boil them. I simply added the butter and frozen carrots to a pot, and let it cook down. Once the carrots were soft I added in the brown sugar and let it stew on low heat till the rest of dinner was complete. My grandma couldn't believe how easy these carrots were; she thought they were super fancy. I call this a win!

EXCELLENT!! I had been searching for a candied carrot recipe for a long time. Found it here at Allrecipes.com. Placed recipe in my Recipe Box for future reference. I did add a couple dashes of cinnamon and OMG, sooo good. Even better the next day warmed up. Love my candied carrots!

Thought this recipe was great!  Boiled the carrots ahead of time and then threw them in the sauce right before I was ready to serve dinner and they turned out perfectly.  Tasty and easy.

Made four pounds of carrots for a family dinner. Would cut back a little on butter as sauce was thin or alternatively thicken a little. Great recipe. Every carrot was eaten.

Great recipe! A little liquidy and a tad too sweet the first time (I ended up adding starch and still runny), but far and away still one of the better carrot recipes I've found. I'm not exactly sure if there's a fix or not considering it's pretty much just butter and sugar, so I'll probably just continue making them this way until I figure out a good tweak. Thanks!

I used canned carrots and they tasted great!  They were a little mushy, but that's my fault for using canned.  I drained the liquid out of the can, put the carrots in a small saucepan on low, and added everything else.  I used a little less sugar and butter, as I did not have a full pound of carrots.  I let the carrots cook, stirring occasionally, for about 15 min while I finished preparing the rest of dinner.  Super easy!!

These are delicious!!  So incredibly simple and uses ingredients I always have on hand.  As other reviewers have said, the sauce was a little thin, but I left it as is since it probably reduced the calories and tasted just fine!  Love, love, love it!

Used precut shoestring carrots and boiled for a few minutes (maybe 3 min?).  This was a huge hit!  For the first time ever, carrots were devoured.  Will try next time with Splenda brown sugar.

The carrots were excellent. I received rave reviews from my Easter guests and it was so easy to make! I also cooked the carrots first in the microwave for about 10 minutes then finished them in the oven.

Flavor was fabulous, however it is a good thing that I was paying attention as the cooking times were way off.  I actually used multicolored carrots which made for a pretty presentation.

This could not be easier to fix!  I have made these carrots three or four times since I downloaded the recipe just a week or two ago.  My husband and I both love them.  (And it is not always easy to get him to east his veggies...)  Sometimes I add half teaspoon of cinammon and sometimes I just prepare them per the original directions.  Very yummy!  I think a little more heated spice might be good too.  Will try it next time.

I also steamed the carrots first, and this dish turned out quite good, although I found a bit too sweet for my liking. Next time I will use about 2 tbsp of brown sugar instead.

To kick it up with some extra flavor, I add a 1/4 cup of orange juice to the brown sugar/butter mixture. You can also try adding in a tablespoon of powdered ginger. This is a great way to get your young kids to eat their carrots!

Nice simple way to dress up plain boring carrots.  The glaze added the hint of sweetness the carrots needed.  Served these along side of:  Spiced Ham Loaf, another AR recipe.

This is one of the vegetable recipes I chose for my first time Christmas dinner.   I'll have to say it went over very well.  My nephew of 3 gives them very high praise.  Only thing I change was to add a bit of cinnamon.  Thank you

These were really great. I took someone else's advice and added a pinch of nutmeg, and that really did it for me. And I used olive oil instead of butter and they was still fantastic!

i seldom comment on recipes but felt this one deserved a few words. this is a great recipes because of its simplicity and great taste. i made its as stated but would think a little cinamon would be a nice addition to it. my wife loved it and she normally wont eat carrots.

Yummy + easy = my kind of recipe. I added just a dash of nutmeg. I also used regular carrots instead of baby carrots because, to me, they have more flavor. I kept mine on the stovetop until the sauce was slightly thickened. Hubby and kids loved them. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent!  I made these tonight for my husband and 15-month-old daughter.  I hadn't fed her carrots successfully in a while, and I don't make them very often because I don't usually like carrots.  She loved them, and so did both of us adults!  Not too sweet, which is an added bonus.

These were good, and VERY easy. I used baby carrots, which saved time. I liked these, but when I brought them for Easter dinner I learned that candied carrots- no matter how good- just don't have a lot of appeal. BUT for those who do like candied carrots, this is a good, easy recipe.

Good, but not quite as good as I expected. I think next time I will add some 'pumpkin pie' type spices (allspice, ginger, cloves, etc) and spice it up. Also the sauce never really thickened so some cornstarch might in order to really make it stick. Good base recipe though. Thanks!

The carrots were ok. It wasn't as good as i thought they would be. It just tasted like sweet carrots with butter. It didn't have a bad taste, but it also didn't have a wow tatse.

Really tender and fabulous. As per another reviewer, I steamed rather than boiled the carrots, which took 7 minutes (rather than 20-30). This keeps the flavor as well as the nutrients in. Then, since we were out of brown sugar, I used 1/4 cup of maple syrup  with the butter and put that on med-high heat, and cooked the mixture down until it became a syrup, surrounding the carrots (about 7 minutes). They were perfect! Tender, flavorful, and almost like dessert. A great way to eat your veggies!

I liked these carrots, as did my 4 1/2 year old son.  They were a little too hard, though (which I like, but some in my family didn't), so I would cook for longer.  They did just fine reheated as leftovers.

I used frozen crinkle cut carrots. I agree with other reviewers, towards the end you need to turn up the heat and stir constantly to caramelize the sugars. The crinkle cut helps give this a beautiful presentation.

Made these last night.  Simple and delicious.  I doubled the recipe as I had guests over.  Boiled the carrots for only 20 minutes which made them the perfect texture so they don't become mushy.

This is the best way to cook carrots!  I ended up adding more brown sugar, I like 'em to taste more like a sweet potato.

Quick and easy...used 1 lb bag of baby carrots and steamed instead of boil (to retain more flavor and nutrition). Skipped pepper and substituted 2 shakes of cinnamon instead. Agree w/ cooking down a bit to reduce and using a little cornstarch to thicken. Even my 14 yr old manage to eat a few...this from the teenager who hates to eat vegetables!

Great recipe! Great Idea! One suggestion, steam the carrots unstead of boiling them, to keep in the nutrients. But, I would make these, and did it from the 'hard' stage...much better precooked before adding the sugar and butter, in the warmed pot...thanks for recipe..will be using again and again. :)

Very simple and sweet.  My husband and I both loved it.  The only change I made was to melt the butter and brown sugar in the pan, while the carrots were draining.  Then toss the carrots back in and stir around.  That way the brown sugar completely melted and was not lumpy.

My kids don't like carrots. When I made these, they ate the entire batch of carrots.  They couldn't get enough!

Delicious!  I omitted the pepper as well, and I think that next time I will add less butter so the sugar can carmelize better.  Definatly a keeper!

Delicious and versatile. I added a can of rinsed and drained Italian green beans, so to make it a little less sweet, I used 2 T brown sugar, a squirt of soy sauce, and a splash of balsamic vinegar. For just carrots, though, I would not change the recipe.

Okay.  They taste just as you'd expect.  Baked candied carrots are much better tasting - & healthier, too.

My friend who doesn't like carrots really liked this recipe.  I used dark brown sugar and baked it at 350 for 20 minutes to thicken the sauce.

For parties, I prepare carrots and cover with water in a pot, boil when guests arrive, and just add the seasoning I've already mixed up when ready. You can keep everything in the fridge for several days beforehand. Very good with ham and sweet potatoes, and a hit every time I serve it.

Excellent! I used carrots from a can instead of fresh and it turned out just as well. I was even able to feed them to 17 month old daughter, who isnt a big plain carrot fan, and she gobbled these up. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful. Used baby carrots as some others did. Didn't need to change anything. Made a batch of these, and ate some and vacuum packed the rest. They reheat perfectly. I just toss the bags into boiling water. No change in flavor. Perfect make ahaead for the holidays. Thank you.

These carrots were DELICIOUS!!!!!  I prepared 2 lbs as directed but only  sugared half of them as my husband doesn't really care for sweet vegetables. 
I give him some of each,  buttered and the sugared.
He requested more of the sweetened version, so I added the rest to the candied sauce! Very very good! Very, very easy!!!  Will definitely be making these again!!!!!

Very quick & easy to make!  I boiled  the carrots and prepped my sautéed pan ahead a time. When it came time to serve dinner I quickly sautéed the carrots in the brown sugar & butter. A hit amongst adults but not with the 5 children (ages 8, 6, 6, & 4), surprising but I will definitely make these again. I really enjoyed them:)

This has been a staple in our  family for years--but with variations. I don't boil them, but  instead sautee'/steam them in a covered skillet, using a small amount of water and butter. Then I sometimes add things like pecans and dried cranberries and/or toasted coconut. Stir them in while cooking, the  pecans become toasted, too!

This is an excellent recipe for sure.  My husband and I loved the finished result.  I would not change one thing in the recipe.  It will be a go to recipe for me.  It goes well especially with roast pork or pork chops, but would not hesitate to use it with other meats,  It was delicious!!!!!

Hubby liked more than me, but he made them soooooo. We do suggest like the others to replace the pepper with cinnamon. They were sweeter than we like so we'll use a little less brown sugar.

I added a little more brown sugar. According to my wife and son it was perfect after the addition. I guess everyone taste buds are different. Nevertheless, it was delicious.

This was like a recipe I learned to make when I was a young girl, over 50 years ago. The only difference is I left half the pepper out and replaced it with cinnamon and added 1/2 c. of golden raisins. Even my grandchildren liked them. Deborah Townsend

I have actually made these carrots twice, but forgot to post my review. I cut the larger size baby carrots in half length-wise, and after bringing water to a boil, I then reduced the heat to medium (not a simmer), and cooked the carrots for 10 minutes. To glaze the carrots I used 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/4 cup of (dark) brown sugar, 2 pinches of salt, a pinch of pepper, and I also added 2 pinches of powdered ginger, which I then cooked (glazed the carrots) for 3 minutes. Enjoyed the carrots, will make again, and next time I may just add another pinch of ground ginger.

Boiled the carrots ahead of time and let them sit on the stove until I was ready to do the rest. Yummy.

First I guess it depends on how big your carrots are but 20-30 minutes is waty to much, I cooked mine (smaller) for a fraction of that 8-9 minutes and that was still too much... and the "Sauce" ok,

Yummy and so simple.  I used baby carrots and they were cooked through in less than 15 minutes.  Hubby didn't care for as much, but this is simple enough to make as a side just for myself.

This was very simple and my daughter like it very much. I will be making again.   I followed the directions pretty closely except no salt/pepper. I prefer that to be done as needed at the table.

Super easy and delicious.  I only used 2T of brown sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Cooked the carrots in the pressure cooker - only took 1 minute.

I've made this three times in two weeks.  The kids LOVE them!  If you cut them into small sticks like the recipe suggests, they do take 20 minutes to cook.  If you chop them up smaller just start checking after 10 minutes or so.  You must add the pepper!  The sugar/pepper combination is amazing.  It's not spicy but it just really adds something amazing.

These are delicious and have become a staple at our holiday dinner table. I usually cook them longer than the 3-5 minutes as stated in the recipe. Cooking them longer really helps the flavor to set in. Yum!

These carrots were good. I would recommend cooking down the sauce a little bit so that it thickens up a bit. Reducing the sauce made a nice glaze that was more flavorful and coated the carrots nicely.

I really liked the flavor of these carrots but the sauce definitely gets very thin.  I tried to thicken with a little cornstarch but it didn't work well.  Next time I will cook down the sauce more.

Followed recipe exactly as written and loved it. The carrots weren't swimming as you typically see with candied carrots, instead the carrots had a light glaze and tons of flavor.

Wow!  I would have been making this for YEARS now had I realized how simple it is. I love that this recipe is not cloyingly sweet too - the carrot is the star of the dish here, not the candied coating. I doubled the recipe, using a 2 lb bag of baby carrots from the convenience section of my market. My only substitution was that I used 1/4 C brown sugar + 1/4 local honey in lieu of the 1/2 C sugar I would have used since I was doubling.

I left out the black pepper and added a dash of nutmeg, and they were a huge hit! The kids loved it (even the 2 year old!)To leave out the slicing and dicing I just used baby carrots and cut the original cooking time to 15 minutes. Perfect!

I loved these carrots; this is a great basic recipe. I did steam the carrots until just tender and them dumped them in the skillet with butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. They were a big hit.

Only Jack and I have tried these but we both really liked them.  Only change I made was to the method which was to re-add the carrots to the pan after the sauce had been made instead of doing it all at the same time.

Made them for thanksgiving last year and hopped on here to find the recipe again for this year. We really enjoyed them. I save time by buying bagged baby carrots and it worked just as well.

I was looking for a different way to prepare carrots and this seemed like something my kids would like.  Unfortunately, after one bite, they were done.  I tried to like them... they sounded delicious!  But I just was not a fan of the brown sugar with the carrots.  I probably won't be making this one again.

Very good, but the sauce was a bit runny even though I turned up the heat and cooked it longer to try and get it to caramelize.

There are many good carrot recipes and this one has to be pretty close to the top. It's easy to make and tastes great. I made it just as it reads. The next time I may try it with the microwave. I believe it will come out the same.

Delicious recipe!  This combines salty and sweet for a perfect carrot glaze.  I am not a huge fan of ooked carrots.  But I only eat them like this now.

I made these to go with my St. Pattys Day feast. Delicious! I used a large bag of baby carrots and boiled them for like 10 mins until just cooked and then made the glaze and sauteed them for a couple mins. Thanks!

So easy and tasty! My hubby dislikes "sweet" tasting food, but went back for seconds on these carrots! The salt and pepper add a flavor that compliments the sweetness (we added a little extra pepper). I make these every time I have carrots on hand.

We liked the carrots, they were pretty tasty. I actually prefer sauce to be a bit thicker and it was watery. Used baby carrots. Great texture but not enough sauciness to it. Will possibly mash them next time so the flavor is all through the carrots. Instead of salt n pepper I used cinnamon

These carrots had just the right amount of sweetness.  My son grumbled about the carrots but then practically inhaled a huge serving!  I used baby carrots and a little bit of corn starch to thicken it up.

Great!  I steamed pre sliced carrot chips to retain nutrients.  I think created the glaze in a separate pot, added some honey and mixed with steamed carrots.  Delicious!

I've made these a couple of times. The only thing I did different was let the syrup thicken up a bit so that it sticks to the carrots. Very good!

These Carrots are so good, I made them for Easter and everyone had thirds, I thought that they would have been sweeter but they were perfect! (I didn't do anything different except for that I baked them in the oven) Thank you for the recipe!!

I thought this was a good basic recipe but it's missing a little cinnamon, a little white sugar in addition to the brown sugar and a dash of nutmeg. Instead of boiling carrots first I mix the carrots with the ingredients in the pot and cook on med low to low covered tightly. I simmer until the carrots are tender and have absorbed the full flavor of the thick candied sauce, alomost like candied yams.

I didn't add salt or pepper, but I loved it! I half wanted to drink the brown sugar and butter mixture that the carrots were simmering in - but I restrained myself. Deliciously reminiscent of The Cracker Barrel's sweet baby carrots.

I am not a carrot eater, but wanted to make something that wasn't too carroty in flavor.  This recipe was wonderful.  We used tiny baby carrots that were packaged "microwavable carrots" in the produce section of our supermarket.  They were smaller and thinner than normal baby carrots.  They were the perfect size for our family, including our one year old.

Thank you for the recipe - easy and delicious. A nice change of pace for carrots. Note: I like to use white pepper in a recipe like this - it has a slighlty different taste than black pepper.

I've been making these carrots for years from a recipe in an Allrecipes cookbook I bought before I ever heard of the website.  They are delicious made as written, but a bit of hot pepper flakes or a pinch of cinnamon doesn't hurt at all.

We don't usually like cooked carrots (we prefer raw), but this was a good recipe.  I used mostly fat free butter and a little less brown sugar than the recipe called for.

Really enjoyed this. I don't like thick syrup on my carrots, so this was great for me, but maybe too runny for others. I added some nutmeg and cinnamon and replaced a little of the brown sugar with dark brown sugar, and it was wonderfully aromatic and sweet. Will definitely make again!

I think I would cut back on the butter a bit -- the sauce was more liquid than I expected -- but my family really enjoyed carrots cooked this way.

I have made these three times now and they are great!  And I don't really like cooked carrots.  One time I added parsley and toasted sliced almonds after they were cooked and that was good but they are terrific just as is.  I'm going to take them to Easter dinner and I know they will be gone in no time.

Loved this dish with turkey, stuffed with limes and jalapeno peppers, last night! Was looking for a dish my mother-in-law, who doesn't like carrots, would enjoy, and one that would compliment a Mexican themed Canadian Thanksgiving supper. She loved them! After reading some other helpful reviews, I substituted cinnamon for the black pepper, and heated on low for 2 minutes after adding brown sugar, to thicken up the sauce. I will be making this again, tonight, for family who missed our turkey supper last night.

I love candied carrots.  I follow my mother's lead and will usually add about 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh mint at the butter/sugar stage. Delicious!

The only reason I rated this 4/5 was that my wife does not particularly like candied carrots; maybe next time I'll call it "savory carrots", she does not know the difference.  EASY recipe and great with strong meats (had it with venision).  You can decide which sweetener you want to use; I used honey with a touch of molasses.  Cook it down to desired consistency but DON'T overcook the carrots.  Fresh dill makes a huge difference if you like.

Yes I did make changes to the recipe. I sliced my carrots via the vegetable cutter on my  stand mixer.  Everyone liked the carrots being sliced a lot smaller than the recipe. I used everything else just as it was. Oh the compliments we c got!

I like this recipe it was easy to make, and a fast side.  I
cut the carrots up ahead.  I added cinnamon and basil. 
I used baby carrots and cut them in half. Very tasty!

The only thing I added was a splash of vanilla extract. I'm sure it would have been great without it as well.

This recipe is a keeper! My husband loves carrots and he loved this recipe. I really don't care for cooked carrots and I thought this recipe made carrots fairly tolerable.

Didn’t have to make any changes whatsoever. I have 2 children who cant stand eating vegetables, but saw this recipe and figured I’d try it.  I talked My daughter, who didn’t even want to try it, in to eating just one. She ate the rest of the pot. I told her I was glad she tried it and liked it. She replied.....well now that you made it unhealthy, I’ll eat it!!!!

Can’t wait to make it again

Made with peeled baby carrots. Only made a 1/2 pound, turned out great! Even my non-vegetable eating teenage boy ate a few! Thanks for sharing! :)

I made it but ran out of time and did not let it cook enough after adding the sugar. I actually was planning on leftovers since my daughter & her husband do not liked cooked carrots. They decided to try them along with my grandson.  After the first bite, they disappeared.  They asked for more  next week. All my grandsons will be here so I'm thinking I will plan better so they get cooked correctly and I will triple the recipe :-)

These were delicious. I used baby carrots and cooked them covered in the microwave on high with 2 tbsp water for about 6 or 7 minutes. Check every minute until the carrots get to the tenderness you like. While they were cooking I melted the butter in a skillet and added the brown sugar & salt. Cooked on low just long enough to dissolve the sugar. When the carrots were tender I put them in the skillet and warmed them for a couple of minutes. They turned out perfectly.

It was very good! I think 1/4 cup is too much brown sugar for my taste. I just added a little brown sugar and taste it before I kept adding more.

I come from a family that always prepared and served canned vegetables. I never, in all my adult life, purchased and prepared canned carrots because they are always too mushy and bland. I have used this recipe a total of four times and I keep coming back to it. It is wonderful and I thank you for sharing this.

This is the only way I can eat carrots other than just sautéed in butter. I went by the recipe but next time, I will add a little more brown sugar and butter. I also will cook it longer until the glaze is set.

Made for potluck.  Didn't  add salt pepper.  But a dash of cinnamon like another reviewer suggested.
Was well liked by kids & adults.

Excellent results with minimal effort! I had some carrots that were on the way out, and this was great to salvage them. I followed some of the reviews and sliced on the diagonal ~1/4", boiled for 2-3 min, then moved to a frying pan that had the rest of the ingredients melted in it. I continually stirred for a only a few minutes, and they got nice and coated with the glaze. Delicious!

I liked it a lot and instead of black pepper I used cayenne and based it off of Wendy's candied pecans.

This was quick  to make. I didn't want to over nor under cook. It came out perfectly!! Not too sweet. Not mushy. Just a little bit of a snap, but could poke with a  fork. I doubled the recipe and used baby carrots. I will be making this again soon.

I have made glazed carrots before but used liquid honey instead of sugar as it isn't as sweet, but just enough

Made as recipe was written except used baby carrots as that is what I had on hand.   We enjoyed them but nothing special.  Will make again with "real" carrots.  I am sure that will be better.

These are decent. For those who like the idea of sweetened carrots but didn't like this recipe, try using maple syrup in place of the sugar. My mom made the best carrots that way!

Not bad.  I used frozen carrots crinkle cut.  Added Vanilla Extract. Turned out okay. Carrots are not my fave, made it for Her.

I use baby carrots. I cover the carrots with water, add vanilla extract then refrigerate overnight. I also add vanilla to the butter and brown sugar as well as a sprinkle of freshly grated orange peel.

It was so good, I used carrots from the can, I drained the juice from the can and place all my carrots in a bowl. The next day I put in the pot with brown sugar, butter and black pepper; didn't use any salt. Church banquet love the carrots. None left YAY

Delicious and simple!  I cut my carrots into 1/4 inch pieces and only cooked them for about  10 minutes.  It took longer than 5 minutes for the sugar to get bubbly, more like 10 to 15 minutes.

I'm not a big fan of carrots but I loved them cooked this way!! The only thing I did do was thicken the mixture with a little bit of thicket. My husband loved them also!!

I am making them with  Gluten free apples and pork chop receive.  I usuallybsteam my Vegetables but I will try it this way first.  Making it with mashed potatoes on the side.   We love the pork chop and apple receipe I found on here,  I have made it numerous times.  Always great.

I made this and enjoyed it.  Made it with 1tbs of granulated sugar in the raw and half the butter and salt.  Tasted great and was not candy in vegetable form :)

As a kid, this was a MUST my mom had to make for me every thanksgiving.  I hid the leftovers from my dad.  Very easy recipe and awesome taste!  The only thing I changed was the brown sugar.  I used 1/2 a cup.  I like my carrots super sweet!

So delicious!!! I tripled the recipe for our family, and added a bit more salt & pepper. It went great as a side dish to some balsamic tilapia.

Following the recipe as written, the sauce came out very thin and runny, though it was quite tasty.  I would recommend turning the heat up a bit higher than “the lowest possible setting” on your stove as the recipe suggests, to get the sauce to thicken up a bit. I also think increasing the brown sugar to butter ratio would be helpful. I will try these again, though.

Made these for Easter dinner and they were AMAZING!  I usually don't care for cooked carrots, but these were phenomenal and very easy.  Subbed baby carrots and followed all other directions as written.  Super easy and delish!

These were alright. I cooked these for Thanksgiving dinner and I did exactly what the recipe said, but I also added some of the maple syrup sauce that came with the turkey. Tasted good.

Very tasty!  We used baby carrots and steamed them to keep more of the nutrients then made the sauce.  My boyfriend ate more of these carrots than the baked ziti I made with them!  This recipe is a keeper for us.

My grandmother used to make these years ago but she added onion. First fine dice & saute maybe a 1/8 a cup of onion in butter to every pint of cut carrotts. Adds a nice sort of "sweet & sour" touch to the recipes.

These are a good way to make carrots.  This way even my four year old requests them.  They are tasty, I only wish that the sugar/butter mixture would be a little thicker so it would stick to the carrots better.  I use frozen carrots that are crinkle cut into slices.  They cook a little faster than what the recipe calls for but they work great.

My mother always candied carrots for holidays and family gatherings. I'm so glad I found this recipe! Now I don't have to wait for a holiday! I used regular-sized carrots, though. I cut them into two-inch pieces like the recipe calls for, but if they were a little thick, I'd cut them in half length-wise. Thanks!

Sooo good and so easy.  I just randomly made these to get rid of some carrots.  I didn't really follow the measurements given, because I was feeling so very lazy, but they turned out very well. 

I added some cinnamon and a bit of vanilla as suggested by somebody else.  

If nothing else, these were the nicest smelling carrots I have ever encountered.

Wow-these were absolutely wonderful!  I had absolutely no leftovers.  I think I might do as another recommended..use white pepper the next time.  Thanks!

My family didn't like these at all, I also didn't care for them.  Maybe I did something wrong but we ended up throwing them away. the only reason I rated them a 2 is because they were very easy to prepare.

Good, but I'd slice the carrots into coins the next time.  Also, I'd like to try and thicken the sauce a little too.

I cut back on the brown sugar and butter just a little and they turned out great! Not overly sweet but still yummy! I recommend them and so does my extremely picky husband.

I'd actually rate this 3.5, kids loved them and adults thought they were too sweet.  I guess that's why they're called "candied carrots" though!  Update:  I changed my rating to 5 - I cut the sugar down by half and it was perfect.  Great way to get kids to eat their veggies!  I'm glad I gave this recipe another try.

Perfect as they are but I change them up sometimes depending on the main dish. I make them with a little clove, cinammon and allspice with kabobs. I add a little ground ginger and splash of soy with Asian noodles. I make them to the recipe when I have grilled or roasted chicken or turkey.

not spectacular, but awfully good. i used 1 1/2 pounds of carrots since i was feeding a crowd, and since many people had said it was too much sauce, i didn't increase the recipe -- but then had to later. so i can't imagine that it was too much to start with. i also added a few splashes of basalmic vinegar, i'm sure i'll make this again.

This deserves five stars because it's very good but it also gets points from me for being quick to make.  I don't know why you'd have to dice the butter, however.

It needed way more brown sugar. Probably about twice as much. I know I like it to be sweet if their going to be candied.

A staple in my family.  WE all love carrots but they are pretty boring by themselves. This really dresses them up and makes them seem fancy without a fuss.

Good taste, relatively easy to make.  I used baby carrots instead of peeling/cutting uhm... "adult" carrots and had good success.

Family loved these, but I thought the sauce was a little runny.  Good flavor though.  Next time I will use suggestions and bake to thicken the sauce.  Great with roasts!

I thought they were pretty good. Not a whole lot of flavor, but better then regular carrots. For some reason my 2 year old who loves carrots would not touch them.

These taste really good but I wish the glaze turned out a bit thicker. I'll try a touch of corn starch next time so the yummy glaze sticks to the carrots and doesn't get wasted sitting in the bottom of a bowl. Anyone have any other suggestions on how to thicken this glaze?

I would have preferred a thicker sauce, but they were very tasty.  Even my husband, who doesn't eat candied vegetables, ate them without complaining.  Next time I'll have to double the recipe.

We loved these!  Hubby was skeptical as he is not fond of sweet veggies, but these were great.  Will be adding this to my Thanksgiving menu.  Thank you Denyse!

These carrots are sooo good.  I could sit down and eat a whole batch all by myself.  We used more brown sugar and butter rather than called for.  The carrots did not have a strong "carrot" taste and they were the perfect texture.  I'm not big on cooked carrots, but prepared this way has made me change my mind.  Thanks Denyse.
