I made this for my kids for a "dippable" breakfast, paired with sliced Granny Smith apples and homemade waffle sticks. I did use a quality pure maple syrup in this recipe. My kids ate every bite and all morning all they did was talk about how good it was. NOTE: I actually made this the night before so all I had to do was grab it out of the fridge in the morning.

This was delicious! I paired it with sliced apples.  I think next time I will also serve it with vanilla wafers.

I LOVED this. I made this for a sunday school snack with apples for dipping. I did however, only put in 1/4C of brown sugar, and it was sweet enough!

This was fabulous!  Tasted even better after being refrigerated overnight.  We served it with graham crackers and ginger snaps also.

I made this for my Halloween themed Bunco.  I have been eating it all weekend and could just eat it with a spoon.  But apples are pretty good with it too....

This stuff is so good! I also halved the amount of sugar to 1/8 cup, added a 1 cup of full fat (instead of 3/4 low fat) cream cheese, and omitted the maple syrup because I really hate maple flavor. Even without the extra sugar and syrup, this is so creamy with just enough sweetness and a little tang. I am going to take it to Thanksgiving dinner with sliced apples and Nilla Wafers for pre-meal snacking. Also LOVED how easy this recipe is, took less than 10 minutes to make.

Recommended by a friend. We cut the sugar in half per other reviews and it was still sweet for us. We also doubled the amount so this snack would last longer as I couldn't stop eating it! Super tasty! Probably will be making this when next fall comes around. Gala apples go well with this recipe.

I made this for an impromptu potluck and it was very well received by all the guests.  I served it with apple slices and gingersnaps -- Yum! I loved that it only had 5 ingredients and I had all 5 on hand.  As with so many recipes this one is easy to make your own.  I had just made up some Pumpkin Pie Spice mix, so I substituted the mix for the cinnamon -- one of the gentlemen at the party declared it was "just like having pumpkin pie on a cookie!"  I noticed he had several helpings...  That's a seal of approval in my book ;-)

Awesome recipe!  I actually got a version of it (with more spices called pumpkin pie dip) from Whole Foods and served it with their ultra-thin ginger snaps.  It's a wonderful dessert this time of year!

Quick and delicious dip! Made as written but next time would probably soften the cream cheese before mixing to avoid little lumps. I served it with apples and graham crackers. Will definitely make again!

Very easy & very good. I also like that this makes a smaller amount of dip than most other recipes.
I  did cut back on the amount of brown sugar  (I like dark) and didn't have real maple syrup so used Mrs. B's. I could barely taste this, so will get some real maple syrup for the next time I make this. :)

This was delicious. Only giving 4/5 stars because I altered recipe slightly; after reading previous reviews I used 1/4 cup brown sugar rather than the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe. The dip was still sweet, and very well received by my in-laws at Thanksgiving last week. I served it with both sliced Macintosh apples and Nilla wafers and by far the apples were preferred by all. The sweetness of the apple pairs really well with the dip. The Nilla wafers tasted fine with it, as well, but didn't offer a strong enough complementary flavor (in my opinion). My dip did not turn out perfectly smooth despite using room-temperature cream cheese. I don't think this was a problem, however, as it was mostly smooth. Glad to have found this recipe and that it was enjoyed by all.

Delicious and so so easy!  I made this for snack for my Girl Scout troop - wanted to keep it a little healthier, so I started with only 1/4 c brown sugar.  It was so good, I didn't add the other 1/4c.  Served with pretzel sticks, apple slices, and some graham crackers.  The girls gobbled it up!

I made this recipe for our annual Halloween party last year and it was delicious!  This year I was experimenting and I added 1 box of instant vanilla pudding mix with it and it was so good! It added a very unique flavor and makes it tastes a little more creamy, but not to sugary.  It was so good!

Different. Good, but a little on the sweet side, which makes it a good after meal treat. Even an after school treat.

Served this with Honey Crisp apples and pita crisps for an appetizer while we finished making turkey dinner.  Also substituted Tofutti cream cheese for guests that are allergic to milk.  Tasted just as good as real cream cheese.
