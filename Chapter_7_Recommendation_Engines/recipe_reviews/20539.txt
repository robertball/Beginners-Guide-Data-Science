Hi,

I'm thai and want to change some ingredients in the recipe.  Well, I will tell you how to cook Tom Ka Gai.  Firstly, you got to cook pieces of chicken breast in coconut milk--you can add some water--depends on how thick you like.  Secondly, put 3-5 pieces of lemon grass (2 inches each), 3-5 pieces of galanga (0.5 centimeters thick), 3-5 kaffir lime leaves (we called it bai-ma-grood), lemon or lime juice, fish sauce, crushed fresh chilli, coasly chopped cilantro, mushroom or cabbage.  The taste will be a bit sour, salty and spicy.  You can buy all ingredients in asian food shop.  Don't put ginger because "Ka" in thai means galanga.  Those two are look alike, but their smell are totally different.  We eat Tom Ka Gai with rice and when you eat it don't eat lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and galanga.  We put it for smell not eat.

Why eat anything else?  Find an Asian market and get  galangal, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves. I more or less doubled everything except the fish sauce.  I used 1 reg and one lite coconut milk. Skipped the oil, added some chili paste for extra spice. Omitted the bok choy and used green onions. I used half water and half chicken broth.  Don't forget to serve with rice.  Tastes as good as the recipe from my Thai cookbook. UPDATE: I have since made this with bok choy and did not like it as much, and I love bok choy.  Also, if your soup tastes "flat" you need to add a squeeze of lime juice to brighten all the flavors.  The lemongrass should be bruised, give it a bash with the flat side of a knife or smack with your rolling pin, and NOT chopped or consumed.

Outstanding! Exotic & unique flavor! I omitted the fish sauce (unable to find any), and had to use dried lemongrass from a spice jar because I couldn't find fresh (I live in a semi-rural area).
Per previous comments, I substituted chicken broth for the water and reduced the red pepper by half.  It was still quite tangy, so next time I'll probably reduce the red pepper further. I added a little extra bok choy and cilantro. Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe is SOO good. It's usually all gone by the end of the day.
I took a couple suggestions and it turned out wonderful. I've made this recipe about 5 times.
First off DON'T add more that 1 cup of chicken broth, thats wayyyy too much and far more salt than necessary.
I used 3 cups of water and 1 cup of reduced fat chicken broth. The flavor was just awesome. 
Also ADD MUSHROOMS! They blend with the flavor so well and really add something special to the recipe. I used a combination of white and brown. 
We also used 3 small chicken breasts, more to chomp on :D 
If you don't have peanut oil just add 1 tsp peanut butter to the oil you have.
With these modifications I find it to be perfect, best soup I have ever tasted. 
Don't skimp on the ginger its fantastic!
Great recipe I highly HIGHLY recommend.

This recipe was okay.  I love Thai food, and this soup could be really good with a few changes in the recipe.  First of all, 2 tsp. of crushed red pepper would ruin the dish.  I used 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper, and the soup was still very spicy.  Second, 1/4 cup fish sauce is too much.  I used 3 Tbsp. and still found it overwhelming.  Third, 10 ounces of coconut milk is not enough.  I would recommend reducing the amount of water and using one-and-a-half or two 15-ounce cans of light coconut milk.  I did not find the bok choy a necessary ingredient, and instead, I would add rice noodles.  With these changes, I will probably make this recipe again.

OUTSTANDING recipe.  I had troube with the lemon grass too.  Had to pick it out of the soup like bones from fish.  The flavor in this is excellent.  As compared to our favorite Tai restaraunt, I would say this is dead on!  Maybe even better (and this simply isn't possible).  Just don't know what the heck to do about this lemongrass issue.  Next time, I will cut them in long strips and pull them out to serve like bay leaves.

This is scrumptious! I used 4 fresh thai red peppers instead of crushed red pepper, and I added thai basil, dried shiitake mushrooms, and bean sprouts puchased from a local Oriental market. I also used frozen shredded lemongrass which helped reduce the prep time. After reading other reviews, I substituted half of the water with chicken broth and reduced the fish sauce a bit. Wow, it was delicious. I highly recommend this great recipe and look forward to trying it again! :)

This soup turned out awesome! I used jarred lemon grass, and kept them in large pieces so that I could fish them out later.  I also used mushrooms instead of chicken, and 2 green onion stalks instead of regular onion.  Instead of 4 cups of water I used 2 cups chicken broth and an extra 14 oz can of coconut milk. I left out the cilantro as well.  As others said, this recipe is very forgiving and will taste great with the addition of any vegetables.

Yippee!!  My guy mentioned that he loves "lemon grass soup" so I found this recipe. I can't wait for him to get home from work and try this!  I had to use dried lemon grass (wimpy grocery store) but it tastes great!  I doubled the garlic (I always do), added shrimp along with the chicken, and chicken broth (instead of water). I kept it low carb without rice or noodles.  OMG this is the bomb!  It screams with flavor!  Thanks for posting this EXCELLENT recipe!

I have made this soup many times and it is a big hit with my picky husband.  I gave 4 starts only because I do change a few things.  I couldnt find lemon grass the 1st time so I used just a little lemon juice and insted of chicken breast I use ground turkey sausage and a shalot insted of onion because it is not as stong.  I do use a whole good, full head of bok choy and like the picture I cook a pot of jasimine rice as a filler.

Followed this recipe for the most part-- doubled it. I didn't buy Bok Choy because I had a head of green cabbage, so I shredded about 1/2- 3/4 cup and added it.  Also added approx 2 cups of uncooked prawns.  I added gralic chili paste to my soup, as well as a big spoonful of Tom ka Gai soup base.  As a side, I cooked a pot of jasmine BROWN rice, adding 1T. Costco chicken base in the jar. Ground up roasted peanuts to serve on top of the cooked rice.   My sweetie put a big scoop of peanut-topped rice in his bowl then ladled the soup on top. I added a squeeze of a meyer's lemon to my bowl and an additional scant of the garlic-chili paste. Both tasted excellent. My honey's was nuttier!  As for the cabbage, it tasted fine in our soup, but I would def use the Bok Choy from now on for a more authentic flavor and texture. I felt like the shredded cabbage just wasn't right for this soup, and I don't think chopped cabbage is either. =)

I tweaked the recipe a bit to make it more authentic... Get galangal instead of ginger root, very different taste.  And instead of "Chopped" lemon grass, I cut it in 2-inch sections and use the back of the knife to chop it, so that it is intact on the outside but broken on the inside, this way it's also easier to fish out later.  Instead of Bok Choy I added mushrooms and some fresh jumbo shrimps.  The result is better than the ones I've had in a Thai restaurant.  Thanks for posting this recipe!!

I didn't have bok choy or fish sauce, but I used spinach and it was great. I ended up also adding a lot of lime and some lime zest to it at the end to get it to the flavor I remember from my hometown's thai restaurant. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers to use chicken broth. It was nummy!! We served it with rice noodles to try something a little different.

I modified this into a curry. I used about half a kg of chicken (bones and all). I doubled the spices, garlic, ginger and onion. Followed the procedure, but I added only about a cup of coconut milk and about the same of water, as I felt the quantities given would be too much for a curry. I was out of fish sauce so used soya sauce instead. And i forgot to buy lemon grass, so used the chopped stalk of lemon grass instead. The end product was really good. I served it with Thai Style Fragrant Rice which complimented it great. Will def be making it again...  Interestingly, the ingredients used except for the lemon grass and bok choy are similar to the ones used in south Indian (Kerala) cooking. But the order of cooking is very different which I think makes all the difference...

I combined this recipe with a few others I found online. Most notably, I added the Bok Choy last, otherwise it seemed overcooked. Great base recipe. I love this soup!

This soup has been added to our rotation. I can't believe we can make something this tasty in our own kitchen! Our changes: 1. add mushrooms (sliced crimini). 2. Cut the red pepper in half (at least), especially if you think you'll have leftovers... because it increases in heat by the next day. wooo!

I'm giving this a 4 right now, although it has potential to be a 5.  I made some changes as follows:  used 5 thick slices of galangal and no ginger, plus I had to use that lemongrass paste as I couldn't find any fresh lemongrass.  I wasn't able to add any kaffir lime leaves either, so I squeezed in the juice of one lime that was lurking in the bottom of my vegetable drawer.  I used 1.5 tsp red pepper, corn cut off one lone corn cob (also lurking in vegetable drawer!), and two chicken breasts....everything else I did as stated in the recipe.    Chicken broth would have been nice...lime leaves are a must have.  I'll try it again.

Delicious! Pretty much made this exactly as is, but took some other reviewers advice and used 1 cup of chicken stock (homemade) with 3 cups water, and made sure to chop lemongrass big enough to be easily removed before serving.  Also used slightly less fish sauce, to cut down on saltiness.  Served with calrose rice, which added a nice creaminess.  Can't wait to make this again!

This was a pretty close representation of what I've had out at Tai restaurants. The one detractor was that I really didn’t know what to do with the fresh lemon grass when I got it. I chopped it as fine as I could but it was still very coarse in the soup. Kind of ruined it for me. After the fact I found out you can buy lemon grass in a jar, that's probably the way to go if you don’t what you’re doing with the fresh stuff.

Nice rich taste. It was a bit 'flat' and I added juice from half a lemon.  I cooked it always with mushrooms and this Bok Choi variation was a nice change.  If you cook with mushrooms - omit Bok Choi.

I have to write a review based on the first reviewer who writes about making real tom ka gai. I have to say this was the first tom ka gai recipe I made a long time ago. Out of curiosity I researched it online and found this recipe wasn't very authentic, but I REALLY love it. Here are the changes I have made to make it a little more authentic, but you still keep the essence of a GREAT receipe I use less water and more coconut milk, usually 4 cans. I add kefir lime leaves. I don't use galanga, I use ginger, but this is a personal preference. I don't care for galaga, but I love ginger. I also use baby bok choy instead of regular, another personal preference. Also, be liberal with the spices, and the fish sauce! I usually will do rounded measurements of them spices. I keep the rest of the ingrediants the same, also I usually double the recipe, and the amounts I've given are based on that. I have had this soup at the best Thai restaurant in the city I live in, and I think that the alterations I have made to this recipe make min better. P.S. This is my FAVORITE soup!!!

Love it! Delicious!!!  Doubled the recipe and still all was well.  Good idea about keeping lemon grass in large pieces. Was a bit warm...husband thought perfect, one child too hot.  May have to adjust red pepper slightly.

My boyfriend and I loved this soup! The only problem I had was I addded extra coconut milk (per suggestions) but not enough chicken broth. It became rather thick, so it was less a soup. It was so delicious though!

Fantastic! This soup is both mine and my boyfriends favorite soup EVER. I substituted the bok choy for one red bell pepper, and 2 cups mushrooms. Also I left out the fish sauce, and used regular oil both due to allergies... Still turned out perfect! Just like at a Thai restaurant. Season with lemon juice to taste!

HOLD BACK ON THE RED PEPPER!  This was an okay recipe but way too much pepper.  It really ruined my soup.   I would also recommend adding part chicken broth instead of one of the cups of water and a pinch of lime.

This may not be perfectly authentic, but I was fairly pleased with the result.

The instructions to cook chicken breast for a half hour after it's basically fully cooked in the pan, though, can only result in a tough piece of chicken.

So I think I would change the order..first cook the spices, then the veg, then add the liquid and *then* toss in the chicken.

I made some substitutions here because I didn't have everything the recipe called for. So I'm rating this more for the method than the specific flavor of the exact combo of ingredients. I took off one star for the tough chicken.

We served ours with Quinoa, which was interesting but maybe not the most successful. I also did not have lemongrass, which I think would have been lovely. But this method is a great use of bok choy, it goes very well with the coconut milk and fish sauce and ginger.

YUM! This soup is delicious. Actually, I didn't follow the recipe. I used most of the ingredients listed and also read the reviews to make adjustments to this soup. I did not use ginger. Only galanga root will do for a tom ka soup according to my thai friend. Also I left out the chicken and used tofu.  I substituted vegetable broth for water and used no red pepper flakes. I just wanted to share my process and ingredients so that others may benefit. I cooked coconut milk, vegetable broth, whole lemongrass(dont chop it up-you have to remove it later), galanga root, kaffir lime leaves, cumin, coriander, fresh thai chilis, sauteed garlic, soy sauce, sriracha, a dash of sugar, fish sauce, yellow curry paste. This mixture cooked for about 1-1/2 hours. I removed the lemongrass, peppers, galanga and lime leaves before adding veggies. In a separate pan I sauteed tofu, broccoli, and zuchini squash lightly. When the broth was ready, I added the veggies and let them cook very briefly. I also added shredded carrots. The bok choy was added at the end to cook for only 2 minutes in the soup. At the very end I added lime juice, cilantro and green onions. Its so good my man and I cant stop eating it.

GORGEOUS! My girlfriend and I are big Thai fans and adore a good bowl of Tom Ka Gai. I made this for her as a surprise one day (I'm a novice in the kitchen) and it turned out to be the best we've had. I added shrimp as well. It was surprisingly easy to make, yet my girlfriend now thinks I'm talented in the kitchen. Teally, the hardest part was shopping for the ingredients since fresh lemon grass and fish sauce aren't readily available at your average market. If you're not a spicy fan, make sure and add the red pepper to taste.

I made this last night with no substitutions (other than ginger powder instead of fresh). I added a little more chicken, but that's it. I wasn't wowed, but my husband loved it! Next time I would reduce the water and add more coconut milk so it is creamier. I would also add some lime juice at the end.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I'm going to save so much money now that I know how to make this soup at home.  I followed other commenters advice and used broth instead of water. Try it with shrimp or tofu for variety. Yummy!

Success! 

I followed the general consensus and subsituted two cups of chicken broth and an extra can of coconut milk in for the water. I used spinach instead of bok choy and added mushrooms, peppers and bamboo shoots. I also added some lime leaves, which need to be fished out at the end the same as bay leaves. 

Overall it was very good. The recipe is very forgiving and leaves the door open for personal tweaking. I only had a tspn of red pepper, but will definitely try more next time. It wasn't spicey enough for my liking. A note on the lemon grass - I only had one shoot which resulted in four 1-1 1/2 inch pieces and that was more than enough for flavour once they were scored.

Will definitely try again.

Excellent! I substituted a thinly sliced Jalapeno pepper for part of the red pepper, added another chicken breast, and a squeeze of lime. Will definitely be making this again soon.

Yum!  I went to high school in Thailand, and while this isn't EXACTLY like authentic Tom Ka, it's about the closest that I've found!  I added extra lemon and will add torn lemon leaves to the soup next time, while cooking (discard lemon leaves before eating)

My husband four children and I are BIG fans of Thai food in general, but after relocating to a small town in the Blue Ridge Mountains have been missing that good Thai food we had been used to.
I gave this recipe a try last night for an "Asian potluck" It was a MAJOR hit, and the whole family called it a "keeper" Next time I think I will half the cumin since we are not big on it, and increase the lemon grass a bit. hint: I wasnt able to find fresh lemon grass in the supermarket, but found it in a tube in the refridgerator section of my supermarket, actually where the produce is.

To make it more authentic I omit the ginger onion, cumin and the  bok choy. I added galanga (similar looking to ginger, sold as dry and fresh mushroom and a tablespoon of thai roasted chili paste. {prik pow}and squuze fresh lime juice before serving. I guaranteed that it will be great.

Wow, I've never had any kind of Tom Ka Gai but I loved it!  I skimmed reviews and subbed the water with 2 cans of chicken broth and 1 can of lite coconut milk but didn't catch the part about the lemon grass and was stuck picking little hard pieces out of my soup!  Wish the recipe would've eluded to that...  Might reduce the red pepper if making this for others, I doubt any of my friends or family would be able to tolerate the heat... Fish sauce simmers to a much more tolerable smell/taste so wouldn't change the amount as others have mentioned.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Excellent... I accidently doubled the coconut milk put in but it still was very spicy (and good!) so people may want to half the spices (as is said repeatedly in past reviews).  Also I used salmon instead of chicken and fish sauce and used chopped spinach instead of boy choy.  Next time will probably add mushrooms.  Overall its the best soup I've ever made and great if you like spicy food!

Super soup!  Tastes just like the Tom Ka Gai at our favorite Thai restaurant.  May cut the crushed red pepper to 1-1/2 teaspoons next time.  I had steamed rice available for those who wanted to spoon some into their soup, this worked out great.  Thanks Adrienne, I could have never created such a great dish.

Amazing!  My friends told me that is was better than the Tom Ka Gai that we get at our favorite Asian restaurant.  I added dried oyster mushrooms and egg noodles.  I also could not find lemon grass and had to use dried lemon zest, but it didn't matter.  It turned out wonderful.

I've been following this recipe for the past few years and have always had success. I use shrimp instead of chicken, because it tastes more like the one we get at the local restaurant. Also, I can do without the bok choy, but it doesn't ruin the flavor too much. I agree with the other review that a squeeze of lime in the soup at the end really brings out the flavors.

November 2006.  I followed the recipe (which I don't usually do) and thought this was absolutely awesome.  I'll consider some of the suggestions the next time, but probably won't deviate too much.  It's been cold in Seattle but this really warmed things up!

I can not count the number of times I've made this soup! It's absolutely fantastic.... broth instead of water is a must - I use 2 cans of coconut milk with 3/4 cup broth. Serve over steaming rice in deep bowls. Thanks Adrienne!

This recipe is great!!! I have a Thai restaurant near me that serves this dish, and this tastes exactly like it. It takes more like an hour and a half or so, but i am not a very fast chopper. Be warned: this dish is really spicy! I LOVE how spicy it is, but if you cant handle too much spice, reduce the crushed red pepper to about a tsp or so. I have made this sooooo many times, and its great!

Five stars as long as you use chicken stock instead of water. Also, I bought a rotisserie chicken from the gocery store and just pulled the meat from it. I used a whole can (14 oz)of lite coconut milk rather than the heavy milk.

Absolutely delicious, but I recommend adding the garlic with the bok choi instead of with the spices, as it can burn.

So good! The taste is really authentic. I substituted galanga root (I had it on hand) for the ginger and soaked the sliced chicken in lime juice for a couple of minutes before I put it in. I also added cooked shrimp (just 10 or so little ones) and 1 tsp lime zest before the 30 minute simmer. Following other reviewers advice, I used 1.5 TB of red pepper, substituted one cup of chicken broth for one of the cups of water, reduced the fish sauce amount to 3 TB, and added the cilantro just before serving instead of during cooking. It was perfect. I also used "light" coconut milk to cut down on fat and it was fine- maybe not as thick/creamy as the real deal but still good. This was great the next day, too, and disappeared quickly.

this recipe is so good, i'm looking it up for the third time. don't chop the lemongrass too small because you will want to remove it before serving. also, use fresh lemongrass, the dried has very little flavor. great recipe and as soothing as classic chicken noodle

This is obviously just my opinion.  I am NOT comparing this to a Tom Ka Gai soup (or whatever the real/ original name is) since I HAVE NO IDEA what the real soup tastes like - I am just an average american cook.  With that said - the fish sauce was so nasty that I, nor my family, could eat this.  The taste of the fish sauce was just not right. Plus the red pepper called for was waaaaay to much.  Again - maybe this tastes like the real thing...I don't know....I just know I did not like it.

My boyfriend and I love spicy food, especially Thai food, and were both absolutely entertained and pleased by this recipe. I used "The Spice Hunter" dried lemon grass, and all of the fish sauce since we are fans of it. That part I will repeat. But next time I will make it with more chicken or shrimp, rice noodles, and mushrooms. Once you make this you will find many different ways to make it your own.  2 Thumbs up.

I followed this recipe exactly as it is written, and the soup is wonderful!  I have never used fish sauce before, and when I smelled it I was reluctant to add it to the soup, but it added a wonderful flavor and the finished soup isn't fishy at all.  I plan to make this soup for company, it was very easy to make and just delicious!

*** I have now also tried this soup with Lite Coconut Milk and the flavor and consistency just isn't the same.  I recommend using whole coconut milk, and don't be worried about the added fat, the fat in coconut milk is good for you!

Absolutely delicious. I read through all the reviews and used their suggestions. only 1/4 tsp red pepper, 3 Tb fish sauce, added 1/2 lb shrimp, used 2(14 oz) cans coconut milk and 3/4 c. chicken broth (instead of 1 can coconut milk and 4 cups water), cut lemon grass in long strips and removed prior to eating, added rice noodles. My husband can't handle spicy dishes and he said this was perfect. I describe it as "warm". If you like it spicy like me, add more than 1/4 tsp red pepper. Definitely recommend it! My husband who, in general, doesn't like Thai food, said we should have this again. Oh! one more thing...fresh lemon grass is available in almost any asian market.

I've only had Tom Yum soup at a Thai restaurant, never had Tom Ka Gai, but I might try it soon based on this recipe!  I cooked the ingredients in a different order though--first I simmered the coconut milk & water with the ginger and lemongrass for about 10 minutes to steep the flavors, then strained that and added the chicken and other ingredients and simmered about 20-30 minutes from there.  That way I avoided having the tough lemongrass bits in the soup.  I had a 14-oz can of coconut milk which I mixed with 6-7 cups chicken broth, and increased the fish sauce to 1 tablespoon per cup of broth (for me, 6 tbsp).  I also added the juice from 1/2 lemon, imitation crab meat (adding this makes it taste very different but still good), and mushrooms to the soup.   About 3 minutes before serving, I threw in some rice noodles.  My boyfriend and I both loved it and I've *never* cooked any Thai soup before!

Excellent.  One of the best soups I've ever made.  It is great just as it is... but since I can't leave well enough alone, I have substituted 1 1/2 lbs. of Jumbo Scallops for the chicken and added  1/2 lb. of crimini mushrooms and it is spectacular.

This Recipe is AWESOME!!!!  I Loved the *spicyness*, and did add chicken broth in place of water.  Works well if you are on a low-carb diet, and need variety.  I also thought it tasted similar to the soups I have had in Thai restaurants!  I definately will make this again!!

I had to doctor this up quite a bit.  I added 1 medium sized Lemon squeezed for some more tang and some ground red pepper to turn up the heat.

This recipe is excellent. My boyfriend and I had this soup on our first date at a Thai restaurant. Then I found this recipe - we made it together at home and liked it even better. You may want to cut the red pepper flakes to half the amount if you don't like it too hot. Sometimes we add large cooked shrimp which is awesome. Everyone wanted the recipe at our last dinner party!

Delish!  I served this at a small dinner party last night and had rave reviews.  The only thing I would do different next time would be to cut down the red pepper even more (and I used only half when I made it!).  I don't mind the spice, but it was hot.  I also used lite coconut milk, so maybe that didn't "cut" the heat.  To give it a little more consistency, I'll probably throw in some shitake mushrooms as well.  Overall, I really liked it and will make it again.

This was FABULOUS!  Used the lemongrass in a tube (So much easier!) I tweaked it based on our tastes...left out the coriander, substituted fresh, chopped spinach to drop in at the end...substituted chicken broth for the water, added halved baby carrots and finally parsley in place of the stronger cilantro. Even with my changes it still tastes like the soup at our favorite Thai place.  In fact, my better half says he likes this one more!  So, thank you Adrienne!!

Absolutely delicious, I loved this recipe. I followed the recipe except for using chicken stock instead of water and regular coconut milk instead of lite. I also added noodles and cut the amount of fish sauce in half as I'm not a fan. Be careful not to cut the lemongrass into really small chunks as you'll only have to fish them out again!
Anyway this dish was really  nice and my I'm going to make this a regular dish! Definitely make more than you think you'll need as it goes really fast!!

Almost perfect. It is probably fine with the gingerroot but should really have galanga instead to taste authentic - just remember to remove before eating. Wonderful aroma!

Great recipe.  I use chicken stock in place of the water, and i ease up a bit on the fish sauce.  Plus I add shrimp. 
I love this recipe.  It's the ultimate comfort soup...  Thank you so much for the recipe.

Yum... I have been looking for a soup recipe like this since I have become obsessed with Noodles Restaurants "Thai Curry Soup".  I too made some modifications... used chicken broth instead of water for starters plus one can of lite coconut milk.  For veggies added shredded carrots, exotic mushroom medley, bok choy, green peppers, and lots of cilantro.  Sauteed chicken with veggies, peanut oil, spices, garlic, shredded ginger.  Used regular lemon grass stalks... scored them and dropped in the cooking soup for flavor (to be removed later).  Instead of red pepper added about a teaspoon of spicy green Thai curry paste and also 1 tsp fish sauce.  Finally to bring the coconut flavor to life I added 2 tsps. of sugar.  YUM!  Next time I will add sugar snap peas.  It was so good I didn't even need to add noodles like I had originally planned.

This is a wonderfully different soup.  I've never had it before and wanted to try it.  I made a few additions and changes.  I added rice noodles, shrimp instead of chicken, shredded coconut, and chile sauce.  I couldn't find lemon grass, so i just used the juice from half a lemon and added more bok choy.  I also used low fat coconut milk.  Thanks so much for this delicious recipe.

I loved this soup! I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions, and substituted chicken broth and more coconut milk for the water. I also used just 3 tbs. of fish sauce, and 1 1/2 tbs. red chili pepper. I used baby bok choy, and added mushrooms and bamboo shoots. I'll definitely make this again, only next time I'll use all of the chili pepper and fish sauce.

Delicious! I followed other reviewer's advice and used two cans of coconut milk (about 30 oz) and 1 cup chicken broth instead of water.  For the vegetables I used sui choy/napa because I find it really soaks up the flavour well, mushrooms and canned bamboo shoots.  I also cut the fish sauce (too salty) down to 3 1/2 tbs and the chili powder to 1 1/2 tsp.  Really tasty over rice or vermicilli!

Our local Thai restaurant serves this soup, and I absolutely love it.  I used this recipe as a base because my grocery did not have lemon grass, so I substituted 1/2 juiced lemon and sliced shallots.  I also could not find fish sauce, but oyster sauce worked just as well.  I also added 1/2 tsp curry and 1/4 tsp ground red pepper (we like it spicy!).  This is undoubtedly a better soup than I have been paying $5.75 for! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was all right.  I was expecting something more similar to the soup our Thai restaurant serves, but this really didn't taste like it at all.  If I make it again, I think I'll omit the onions.  They really didn't do anything for the soup.

Wonderful! I added more veggies(whole head of boc choy,mushrooms, snow peas, carrots) a can of chicken broth to accomodate all the veggies, another 1/2 can of lite coconut milk, and a tiny bit of red thai curry. I am SO happy to be able to have this at home!

WOW!  Spicy!  I made this last night for my husband.  He is from Cambodia and my family from Germany and we live in the USA!  We both thought that it was a little bit too spicy maybe just add 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper next time instead of 2.  But over all the flaver was outstanding!  I have never had this dish before I made it last night and I will be making it again.  Thank you for your recipe.

I was really keen to try and recreate the fabulous Tom Ka Gai we always order at a local Thai restaurant. I used this recipe, and I am SO disappointed. I made a 30 mile round-trip journey today specifically to get the ingredients (our Thai restaurant has a grocery attached, and I thought it would be good to get the same produce that they themselves use) - namely the fresh lemon grass, and also galanga, which is similar to ginger root, and which I have read is a more authentic Thai ingredient. Although it tastes alright - nothing at all like the restaurant's soup, unfortunately - it smells so disgusting that I can't bring myself to eat it. This was a pretty expensive waste of time >:(

This thai chicken soup is delicious. It's definitely a keeper! Nice heat. I used baby bok choi (the green leaves as well as the white stalks). The addition of bean thread, sea kelp, or rice noodles would be a plus. My partner wasn't keen on the texture of the lemongrass, so next time I may just smash the stalks & add them whole--so the flavor infuses the soup, but no tough bits at the bottom of the bowl.

Fantastic recipe!  I used it for my first foray into Thai food, and it turned out better than expected.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions (increase coconut milk, replace water with chicken stock, reduce fish sauce and chili pepper) and the result was a delicious, creamy, savory soup that was even better than the tom ka gai I've had in restaurants.
I couldn't find fresh lemon grass, so had to use dry.  I solved the inedibility problem by putting it in a tea ball and boiling that with the soup.  Probably didn't flavor it as much as it would have loose, but I experimentally tasted a leaf when it was done, and previous reviewers were right - it's tough and yucky; not something you want in your soup.

Excellent soup. I doubled the recipe and added a ton of leftover shrimp, scallops, and mussles. I couldn't find lemongrass and I didn't add boch choy - instead I added carrots and chopped tomoatoes. I added 1/3 less water than the recipe called for and added some chili oil to add more heat. Oh and a tiny bit of brown sugar as well. I made alot of substitutions, but it's a great base to experiment with.

My dinner party guests raved about this soup, but I only gave it 4 stars because it seems to be missing a key spice.  The Tom Ka Gai I've had at three different restaurants is almost tangy and absolutely fabulous, whereas this is just very good.  I replaced the bok choy with a can of straw mushrooms and a can of baby corn.  Also, I substituted 2 cups of chicken broth for 2 of the cups of water.  Please note that lemon grass is not meant to be eaten--it's too fibrous.  I left mine in long strands, bruised them thoroughly with the back of a butcher knife, cooked them in the soup and then fished them out before serving it.  I made this soup a day ahead, but worried that the coconut milk might break down before we ate it.  It didn't and the flavors melded nicely overnight.  I will definately make this again but I hope to find out what the key missing ingredient is.

Awesome!!!  I substituted dried ginger for fresh and olive oil for peanut oil (I just forgot to buy the right stuff) and it was still so good that I will never have to order this soup from a restaurant again.

Soup was very good, but has quite a kick to it.  Much too spicy for my 6 year old.  My husband thought it was okay.   If you're not to keen on spicy, I suggest you cut back on the red pepper flakes.

This was a fantastic soup!  The lemon grass was a little hard to find but I did find it.  Like others have stated I cut it into 2 inch pieces, bruised it, and then removed when finished as you can't digest it.

I will definitely make this again.  My wife loved it too.

Excellent.  I doubled the chicken and think this was a good decision.  I chopped the lemongrass and found it fine although next time (there WILL be a next time) I will leave whole and remove at the end.  I used a small cherry pepper instead of the crushed pepper and this was pefect.  Did all the rest exactly per recipe.

So awesome!  My only problem with this dish is that my wife doesn't make it enough!  We make the dish just as it asks.  A little prep required to get the ingreds, but it is very much worth it!

Fabulous!!! This was the very first Thai food item I ever made and it was the best!  I don't need to go to the restaurant to satisfy my Thai soup cravings anymore!

Wow!!!  Don't be shy of the fish sauce...it added a lot of flavor!  I made this recipe without the chicken and instead grilled some shrimp for the top (I had a vegitarian friend over).  I also added jullianed carrots and thin rice noodles.  Awesome!!!

I should have followed others suggestions.  It tasted extremely spicy.  I only added 1.5 tsp rather than 2, and it was so hot.  I followed it to a T and it just was so bland, then overly hot.  Next time I will follow others suggestoins and use more coconut milk and broth.  It is not good as is.  I think it also needs more lemon grass.  I have had this at a Thai restaurant here in PDX and I recall the lemon flavor coming through well and this one just didn't.  Follow other suggestions below.

Although this was not a personal favorite for me (since I'm not a fan of Thai food) my dad, who has tried this type of dish when overseas in the navy, said it was very good and authentic.  It was too strong for me and I probably won't make it again, that is, unless one of my Thai-food loving friends or family members asks me to.

This soup is amazing. I've always loved Thai food but especially recipies with coconut milk. I also substituted the chicken with shrimp and the bok choy with spinach and was wonderful. This is a  very authentic flavored dish.

I'd definitely half the fish sauce and crushed red pepper.  I'd also double the amount of coconut milk, for a more creamy base.

This had so much flavor and was excellent.  However, we used 2 tbsp of crushed red pepper flakes, and it was SOOO spicy!  Too spicy to even eat, which was a bummer because it smelled so good!  So.. I would be careful how much spice you add.  We also added extra lemongrass which I think made it taste even better, and used red bell peppers and mushrooms instead of chicken.  We also replaced half of the water with chicken broth and used lite coconut milk.

This took me a lot of work (more like two hours than one with all the chopping, although I may just be slow in the kitchen). But in the end it was worth it. Used chicken broth instead of water & reduced the red pepper a bit, otherwise followed recipe as written. The soup had GREAT texture and flavor. It was a bit spicy for me but my husband loved it. If you use whole lemongrass, chop it very large (like 3-inch pieces) so it's more easily picked out of the finished soup.

This was FANTASTIC! Don't change a thing about it, it's absolutely perfect. Husband and I inhaled the entire pot of soup in about 5 minutes. Definitely the perfect thing to sate a Thai-craving. Thank you so much for sharing, I'll be making this about three times a week!

We are big Thai food fans and we were very pleased with how this turned out.  Even though I didn't have all the ingredients, the recipe is very forgiving and it turned out excellent.  My husband is Japanese and really knows his Asian food so the fact that he raved about it was a big plus for me!

This soup is my favorite, and every time I get the chance to go to a Thai restaurant I order it.  So, I tried this recipe out to see if I could match the ones I've had at restaurants and it comes close.  There is something missing, maybe the kaffir lime leaves would have done the trick.  I followed some of the other reviews and used chicken stock instead of water, added more coconut milk and included a can of straw mushrooms (drained).  I'll definitely try this again, but I'll add the lime leaves and see what happens.

My husband and I loved this soup. I served it over rice and it was very filling. I changed the water to 1 cup chicken broth, omitted the fish sauce and cabbage, added 1 T. lemon juice, and instead of the crushed red pepper used sambal oelek. I didn't have any fresh lemon grass, so I used Gourmet Garden's Lemon Grass blend. 
FYI Gourmet Gardens sells fresh herbs (lemon grass, garlic, ginger, chili paste) in tubes that are found in the produce department. They make preparation a snap and are a great addition to soups!

Excellent!  Make sure you peel off the woody outer layers of the lemongrass and chop the soft core very finely.  If you're running short or just want to get all the lemongrass flavor you can, leave the outer husks whole but pound them with the rough side of a meat tenderizer or the dull side of a large knife.  Remove the husk before serving.  Also, throw in a kafir lime leaf and remove before serving.

Excellent flavor!  Big hit at my party...for those who like Asian.  I cut down the pepper a little so as not to overwhelm everyone and found it was still VERY warm.  Although, the longer I cooked it the milder it became.  I will cut down on the amount of fish sauce next time, as I found the smell a bit unsettling.  Tasted fine, though.  I served this from a crockpot after simmering on low for 4-5 hours and it was still great.  I found the addition of rice nooodles to be just the right finish.  Great Soup!

This soup has great flavor. I cut some of the red pepper flakes and it was perfectly spicy.  I added Thai rice noodles and some lime juice which worked well.  I couldn't find fresh lemon grass and used the dried stuff (soaked it first), but it was really tough.  I had to pick most of it out.  Next time I'll just add the dried lemon grass in whole stalks and remove it before serving.

This soup was unbelieveably good.  Just like the soup they serve in Thai restaurants.  The prep time was a little long (lots of chopping and slicing) but worth it.  Next time, though, I may decrease the amount of red pepper and add noodles.  Couldn't find lemongrass, but it tasted great anyway.

Great!  However, too much Bok Choy.  Would have liked it as a garnish, not so much bulk.  Also, added another can of coconut milk.

Loved it!  I made it for dinner the first night the weather turned cold, and it really warms you from the inside out.  My husband and I are wimps--I put in about 2/3 the amount of red pepper and may try it with half next time.  I seldom can get fresh lemon grass at my grocer, but the produce section carries a lemon grass paste in a plastic squeeze tube (Garden Gourmet brand, I think) that worked quite well.  Lovely, quick warming soup--will make it lots this winter.

Husband said it is six stars.  I read everyones reviews before I made this recipe.  I followed their advice.  I cut the red pepper in 1/2 and added sauted shrimp and cooked undon noodles at the end of the soup's simmer time.  I did not add the cilantro. Left out the chicken.  Think this would be great with blue mussels.  I will do that the next time I make this. Use however much bok choy you have as this could use more than 2 cups.  NOTE--LEMON GRASS IS LIKE BAY LEAFS, YOU DON'T EAT THEM

This was so good!  The fish sauce was gross, I've never cooked with it before, but once it's all incorporated in it just goes beautifully together.  Don't omit it just because it smells horrible!

Great recipe!  Next time I would cut the red pepper in half, as it was piping hot!  I even broke out into a sweat while eating it.  :-)  I also used chicken broth instead of water, and it was nice and flavorful.

I love this soup!  Adrienne, you are a goddess of Thai cuisine!  The only changes I made - used chicken broth instead of water, doubled the coconut milk and halved the fish sauce per other reviewers comments and added the cilantro in the last 5 minutes of simmer.  Perfect!

ooooh yum!  
I skipped the lemon grass for convenience, used curry powder instead of corriander and cumin, and added a few tablespoons of fresh ground chili paste  (I like things hot and this stuff comes in handy for alot of asian dishes!)  it turned out great, except I wish i had used a bit less fish sauce (too bad I hadn't read the other reviews first)

This was a great soup, I was a looking for something a little different not the same old soup. Not a complaint about it. I really like lemongrass, and it added a great flavor to this meal!!

I love this stuff!  I have made it 5 times.  One time I made it for a potluck at school and I don't know if I mis-measured the pepper or what but it was too spicy.  Only one person could eat more than a small cup.  It is always spicy so if you can't take the heat, careful with the pepper.  I always add lots of extra bok choy becuase I am trying to get more veggies down.  It is simple and yummy!

I used chicken broth instead of water and it still came out watery.  I think it needed more coconut milk.  I'm used to a much more creamy flavor.

We love this soup!!  My friends love it, too.  They had to have the recipe.  I used ground lemon grass from the spice section of my grocery store. It works great.  I saute the onions first then add the other ingredients following the recipe.  I like my onions well done.  Be brave, try this soup.  It's easy and delish!!!!!!!

My husband loves Thai food and he loves this recipe;  I like other Asian food, but I didn't care for this at all.  It has a good heat, but I didn't like the strong coconut flavor.  I think using chicken broth instead of water might have helped, as would noodles, for someone who's not a huge Thai food fan.  If you like Thai, though, this is worth a try!

EXCELLENT!!!!!  This is sooo good that coconut milk is now a staple in my kitchen.  Is the lemon grass supposed to be eaten?  I couldn't find fresh so i got bottled and it is really hard, next time i'll chop it in larger chunks and just put it in for flavoring.  Try this one, you won't regret it!

We've made Tom Ka Gai soup before and this was not the best recipe.  It was just okay.  We are fortunate to have an Asian store within a mile from our house where we buy all our ingredients. They advised us to not eat the lemongrass and to put large chunks of it for flavor and strained out before eating.  Very good advice.

This recipe is pretty good. I've been fortunate enough to taste the real thing in Thailand. Firstly, DO NOT USE THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT OF FISH SAUCE. Maybe half. Fish sauce has a very strong flavor and it was a bit too fishy. That brings me to say add fresh hand squeezed lemon juice if you can't find lime leaves as other users recommended. I did a 2 serving recipie and used half a lemon juiced. Other than that pretty close.

I did 2 cups chicken broth & 2 cups water with mine and it seemed to even out the flavors. Also, I too suggest simmering the chicken in the coconut milk after searing it so it absorbs more of that flavor. I cut the fish oil in half too since I wanted more of a chicken flavor. I didn’t have lemongrass, and I know this isn’t the same... but I added about 1tsp of lemon zest instead and I think it gave a nice citrus to the soup. I usually use sesame oil for a lot of Asian dishes, so if you don’t do peanut it’s a good substitute.

Great base and an even better soup after some much needed tweaks. After my adjustments, my husband - who does not love Asian inspired foods or leftovers - loved it so much he asked for it by name the next day for lunch. 

My changes: First, do not chop up the lemongrass and mix in. Leave it in bigger pieces that you can remove later. (It's too fibrous to eat easily and clashes with the textures in the soup.) Second, reduce the fish oil to 1 tablespoon. Third, add more than one chicken breast. I did 3, which in the end bulked this soup up to 6-8 servings. Fourth, please oh please add mushrooms or you'll regret it and use 1-2 teaspoons of chili-garlic paste instead of red pepper flakes. Finally, add more liquid - 1 extra can of coconut milk, 1 more cup of chicken stalk, 2 more cups of water, and at least 2 tablespoons of lime juice. Husband and children LOVED it this way, and I was really worried it would be too exotic for them. Will definitely make again with my updates.

I really like this soup, however I found it way spicier than I thought it would be. My partner loved it however and said it was his favorite soup I've made thus far! 
I did find that the white coconut milk became clear after the 30 minutes of simmering... not sure why... any suggestions?

Love the flavours in this soup. I always add way more veggies though: carrots, mushrooms, bean sprouts, peppers. It makes it hearty and delicious. Also, I don't chop the lemon grass... I just keep it whole and toss it in while the soup simmers (I bruise it with the back of my knife first to release the juices though). I am not a fan of the texture. Just remove before serving.

I L-O-V-E Thai food so I decided to give this recipe a try. I was a little hesitant at first because I have never worked with some of these ingredients before. It turned out perfect! If I could, I would eat this every single day. This soup is my new soul food. It was rich and flavorful with a soft heat that is perfect on a chilly day. The only thing I might change next time was I might take out the lemongrass because it gave a weird texture to the soup.

I have made this twice. The first as per directions the second with the following substitutions: used red curry paste instead of red pepper, doubled remaining spices. Used two cups of chicken stock and two tins of coconut milk, (no water) added Kafir Lime leaves at the start and lime juice with the spinach (i don't like Bok Choy) A solid base recipe and easy to tweak

This soup is absolutely delicious! Tastes like what you get in a Thai restaurant. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I reduced the crazy amount of red pepper called for to 1/2 tsp, subbed in chicken stock for 2 c of the water, added some sliced button mushrooms with the bok choy, and also used lemongrass paste since that's what was available at the grocery store. Even with the reduced amount of red pepper it was still very spicy. Next time I will reduce the red pepper even more, as I will be serving for guests. I will also reduce the fish sauce by a third to 3 Tbsp.  Will also probably used a little less than 1 onion - not because it tasted bad but because there just seemed to be so much of it at the end.  I was getting spoonfuls of onion, which might be off-putting to some guests.

I modified this to suit what I had at home. I didn't have peanut oil (used olive oil)left out the ginger, lemon greass, fish sauce and bok choy. I used 2 cans coconut milk, and only 3/4 cup of chicken broth (instead of water) I also skipped the cilantro. I added rice noodles with 10 minutes cooking time left, and I ended up with a wonderful dish of noodles and sauce- which was just excellent! The only thing I would have changed would be to add more broth, since I needed more liquid, but it was excellent the way it was. So maybe it wasn't this recipe in the end but this was what I started from anyway. I think no matter what you do to this it turns out well, so have fun with it!!

Good recipe.  Could not find lemon grass, and maybe that's why it didn't have the exact taste I was hoping for.  Most people really enjoyed it.

This was delicious!  I added galanga and crimini mushrooms and 1/2 c. long grain rice.

This is one of my favourite recipes now.  Based on other reviewers' comments I have added galanga to the recipe, and when I can find it fresh Vietnamese Coriander is spectacular, too.

So fantastic that I had to write my first review- I have made this so many times these past few months and company always loves it, thinks it is much more complicated. I add a bit more coconut milk/less water and lots of carrots and portobella mushrooms. I definitely recommend a strong smokey mushroom falvor.
