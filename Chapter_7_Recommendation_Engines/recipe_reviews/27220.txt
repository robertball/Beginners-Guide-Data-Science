This was my first ever attempt at making dressing.  It was delicious and so easy!!  The only change I made was cooking the onion and celery in with the cornbread.  I remember seeing my mother do that as a child.  Of course, hers was NEVER this good!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family was skeptical.  We have always been a "traditional stuffing" family and not open to change.  I made it anyway and now it is a demand for Christmas.  It looks really bad when you're making it, but don't be afraid. After it's cooked, it looks alot better and tastes wonderful.  I added a little cooked, crumbled sausage.  And I would definitely go to the trouble of making the cornbread as stated.  Any store bought cornbread would probably be too sweet and ruin the flavor.

This recipe was great.  I had to cook the Thanksgiving cornbread dressing for the first time in 20 years (my mother-in-law always did it) and had no idea how to.  This was easy to make and tasted great although I did leave out the mushrooms because my husband and son do not like them.  I will make this every year for Thanksgiving.

I made this yesterday for Christmas and it was pretty good!  However, I added 2 cans of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 4 raw eggs (makes dressing creamier). I also used buttermilk in the place of evaporated milk.

Exactly what I was hoping for! Perfect. I changed the soup to cream of celery (I just like it better), and added a teaspoon of sage. I will make this again!

Thank you Mandy!!!  I have been looking for this recipe as I lost the instructions for it in a recent move.  My family was distraught that I might not be able to make this again!!  We've included this recipe in our Thanksgiving menu for almost 20 years.

This recipe was exactly what I was seeking. I used too much cream of chicken. That was my fault. I didn't want to waste the leftover after cutting the recipe in half. It was a little too moist as a result. lesson learned. The next time I will not make that mistake. This dish will be a mainstay of future holiday meals.

I made my own cornbread recipe using buttermilk instead of the one listed.  I was afraid I had ruined it because I accidently used the evaporated milk instead of the soup but it still worked and was very tasty.

I made this yesterday. I did make a couple of small changes. I used my recipe to make the cornbread and only used 1 can of chicken broth plus an equal amount of homemade turkey broth. I also added 3 chopped up boild eggs. Turned out nice and moist and very tastey. I also ommited the sugar in my cornbread because this dressing needs to be savory not sweet.  I did add sage about 3/4 teaspoon.

It came together and set well, but I thought it needed more flavor.  I added quite a bit of poultry seasoning and turned out pretty good.

12.26.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/27220/cornbread-dressing-ii/ ... I subbed homemade cornbread (Melt 1/2c butter,add 1T sugar & dissolved. Whisked in 5eggs.Combined 1c buttermilk & 1/2t bsoda.Combined the two. Poured over 1c cornmeal, 1c flour, 1t salt. Greased 8x8, 30 min) Pureed two slices fresh white bread & combined with crumbled cornbread. Sauteed 1c onion, 3/4c celery. Added 1t sage, 1/2t black pepper, 1T parsley. Added that & 3.5c homemade chicken broth, 1can cr chix & 1/2c half&half. I forgot to add the additional eggs. :/  Could it be better with those eggs?  I'll have to make it again.  :)  Notes4Me:  Add 1t sage, two or three cans cream of soup, two or three eggs.  Looking at a recipe for cornbread salad, it said to cut in half inch cubes, bake at 250 for about 30 to dry. May use that tip for dressing since mine tends to get moldy fast - at least the buttermilk recipe one.

I made this without any changes.  I would put less broth as it was too moist. I also didn’t like the texture but that is my fault as I used medium grind cornmeal instead of finely ground.  I would make this again with these changes.

This has been such a hit in my home for the past 6 years. A full pan never made it to the table on Thanksgiving! I had to see what the majority in my house was so excited for the pan. Let me tell you, it made ME,  eat it! Mind you, I don't eat cornbread! But this dressing is amazing!!

I needed to bake it 15 minutes longer. Other than that it was delicious.
