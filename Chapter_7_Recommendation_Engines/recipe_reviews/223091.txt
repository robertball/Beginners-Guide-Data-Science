Simple, quick and not to mention delicious! I did cut back on the oil for the marinade using about half the amount. I topped the grilled chicken with Swiss cheese, bacon, shredded lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I also opted to broil rolls vs. pan frying bread. All I had to add was a side of Ore-Ida french fries for a quick weeknight meal!

Wonderful sandwich! I only got two sandwiches from this because my chicken pieces were small and I did not cut them in half. I didn't have Mrs Dash or alternative so I used some garlic powder and some Herbs de Provence and made my own garlic/herb blend. Used dried dill weed too.  Hamburger buns instead of French Bread and butter instead of olive oil for the toasting bread. This was great with Monteray Jack cheese and bacon bits. This had a nice mild flavor that was tasty. I am definitely making this again! Thanks so much for the yummy grilled chicken sandwich. My taste buds are dancing. YUM.

I gave 5 stars and have to admit I changed some of the recipe. I hate it when people do this but I only had ciabatta buns! My family weren't excited when I said we were having chicken sandwiches for dinner. They changed their tune when they saw these and were even more impressed by the taste. Excellent sandwich with the ciabatta roll. I still toasted them in a pan to get the extra flavor. Definitely a sandwich to make over and over.

Very good. I used thighs instead of breasts. No cheese because cheese on grilled chicken seems too weird. Along with the lettuce and tomato I added pickle and onion, Quick, easy, and economical!

We LOVED this sandwich! I didn't realize I was out of Mrs. Dash seasoning until I had started the marinade so subbed Montreal Chicken Seasoning. Just great! Can't wait to try it w/Mrs Dash! The lettuce & tomato are a must, they made the flavors really pop! Thanks for a great  sandwich, katiergs!!

This was so good. The marinade was delicious and kept the chicken from drying up. I did the cheap version of this with just plain hamburger buns. I marinated the chicken for a couple of hours then cooked it in a cast iron skillet about seven minutes on each side. I melted Swiss cheese on top while the second side was cooking. Toasted the buns, slapped some mayonnaise and a sliced tomato from the garden on there, and bam, a delicious chicken sandwich. Can’t wait to try it again when I actually have some good bread.

I made it as close to the recipe as I could. I didn't feel like starting up the grill so I just used my stove top and it came out fantastic! The only substitution that I made was I used rice wine vinegar because that's what I had on hand and it turned out great. Will definitely be making this again and again.

This recipe is fantastic. We prefer the chicken on pretzel buns, or in salads. I have also made it with white wine in place of the vinegar, and fresh garlic and herbs in place of the Mrs. Dash. It's easy to substitute with things you have in your kitchen, always turns out great.

My family loved this. Honestly, I am not the best meat cook, but I've made this twice so far and both times I got better at determining when the chicken was done by eye. I used A LOT more chicken than this recipe calls for because I am typically feeding 6-8 people. I used 9 chicken breasts the last time. Also, I don't have Mrs. Dash on hand so I used this chicken rub recipe, Chicken Seasoning Blend on Allrecipes in place of it and all the other spices, since it had all the same stuff in it and more basically (except dill which I don't like). I cut the chicken breasts in half. I let the chicken sit for at least 30 minutes in the marinade, one time I had a lot of time, so I did it for 2 hours. (I think that's better, but 30 minutes for a quick meal if you don't have time) I pounded down the chicken to try to make them even thickness (they cook better that way and less time). Toasted buns and serve, my family was very happy to have a new menu item...

Great sandwich\Marinade!  I sliced the chicken breasts in half ahead of time and used a meat tenderizer mallet before putting them in the marinade.  Making this today for the 3rd time :)

Absolutely delicious.  I used publix French rolls toasted with olive oil and garlic powder.  Lettuce tomato with kosher salt and pepper and the chicken was cooked perfect and flavorful .

I did let the chicken marinate for about 3 hours, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was so good, exactly what I was hoping it would be.

These were amazing! We cooked them a week ago. Our chicken breasts were about 4.5 ounces (almost slider style because they were organic grassfed). We used Fresh publix bakery hamburger buns instead of toast. We also used mrs. dash onion and herb instead of the garlic and it was amazing. Making again tonight!

We liked them. I bought filleted breasts at the store and marinated them in the sauce for a few hours. The chicken had a very nice flavor. I also bought Texas toast for the bread and it saved me some time.  My son said he'd eat this every week.
