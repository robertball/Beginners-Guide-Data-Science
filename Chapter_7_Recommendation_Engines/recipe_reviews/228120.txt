Tastes just like warm pumpkin pie! My family isn't a big fan of nutmeg, cloves and ginger so I omitted those and just added a little more cinnamon. I also didn't have any bisquick on hand so I used 3/4c flour, 1 tsp baking powder, a shake of salt and approx 3/4 tbsp of butter as a substitute for the bisquick (found that remedy for lack of bisquick online). Cooked perfectly on low for 4 hours. Love using the crock pot! Thanks for sharing.

I tried to make it, but used pumpkin pie mix and sweet and condensed milk. So it has a strong nutmeg and cinnamon taste. Other than that it was really good.

I loved the texture of this pudding, like a nice pumpkin pie. However, with this amount of spices it is EXTREMELY spicey!! I will make it again but CUT the spices in AT LEAST half, even more the cloves. (I used only one teaspoon this time)

We found this way too spicy. The cloves flavor is so overpowering. If we try this again we will probably omit cloves and might cut the spices back in general.

Turned out very well! This is REALLY good! It is so creamy and yummy still warm right out of the crock pot. I decided to use just 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice instead of all the other spices. It was spiced just right for me. I used my 5-quart crock pot. Mine only took 2 1/2 hours and was done perfectly. Maybe this was due to using a large crock because it was spread out thinner.
