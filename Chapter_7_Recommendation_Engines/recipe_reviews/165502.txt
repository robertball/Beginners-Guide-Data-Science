MESSAGE FROM THE AUTHOR HERE: Your orzo will need to cook for close to 10 minutes for it not to be hard. Test it as you go if you want to until you are comfortable cooking this style of pasta. The editors changed my orignal direction slightly on this point.

Beautiful, fresh and delicious--the perfect side dish.  I used a specialty "Spring Medley" orzo, and eliminated both the onion powder and corn. Served with "Tenderloin with Herb Sauce" and "Green Beans with Almonds," also from this site, this was the perfect complement, with a subtle balance of flavors and colorful presentation.

Very good side dish. I love the combination of vegetables with the orzo. However, the orzo was too al dente for me, so I added a cup of water with a dissolved chicken bouillon cube to the finished dish and cooked until the liquid was absorbed, and it was great.

I turned this into a main dish by doubling the recipe and adding chicken breast sauteed in fresh garlic and olive oil.  Omitted butter and sauteed mushrooms with the chicken.  I also added a little more garlic when I added the pasta and vegetables.  I use a whole wheat orzo.  We really enjoyed this recipe and I will definitely make it again.

This is my go-to favorite side dish (and sometimes the main dish!). My husband and I love this dish, but I always add a lot of garlic and garlic salt to season it. So tasty and SO SO SO easy to make:)

This really caught my eye...but of course I had to tweak a little.  Instead of buttter I used evoo and toasted the orzo before adding the mushrooms.  Used 1 cup of green peas as I don't care for corn.  Hubby took one look at the dish and said "I'm not eating that!"  Well...at the supper table when it was obvious how good it was he took a spoonful and declared "this is delicious!".  Guess that says it all

This was incredible!!  I followed the recipe exactly except to use smart balance in lieu of the butter and to add some fresh grated parm just before serving - and that just sent this over the top.  You could do so many things to this - add garlic and shallots or whatever sounds good to you.  I will double this next time so we have more leftovers!!  I love this and will make it often - great side.  ty ty ty Dizzy...

Excellent as a side dish. I was expecting to make an entree out of this, so I was a bit surprised to have it turn out on the bland side.

Tasty, appealing to the eye, and so easy. My 5 and 3 y.o. liked it, too. Sprinkled some parmesan on top.

This is a great side dish!  I did have to cook my orzo for 10 minutes, as the author notes in a comment.  We have also added some cooked chicken breast to it, making it into a great one dish meal!

This is great - it's our favorite orzo too! I am the only one in the family who likes mushrooms, so I leave them out. I use frozen mixed veg, with no other changes. Yum!

This was just average to me, but my husband thought it was good.  I think the recipe writer's suggestion to "use pan drippings for added flavor" would help a lot as well as adding some fresh garlic and chopped onion.

This was very easy to make but lacked flavor.  I followed recipe exactly.  Next time I will add more herbs, and add the peas at the very last minute.  By the way, I used real onion instead of powder, very good.

This is a fantastic, healthy side dish.  I added 3 cloves of garlic to the olive oil and used I can't believe it's not butter.  I sprinkled a bit of parmesan on top and served it with garlic chicken.  Yum!

I love mushrooms, but a couple family members don't, so I omitted those, but bet this tastes better WITH.  I will make them another time with mushrooms as a side for me and the mushroom lovers in the house.  To make up for the olive oil, butter and mushrooms that I omitted, I added a few shakes of garlic powder and a Tastefully Simple season salt and this was a nice side dish.  Can't wait to try it with the mushrooms!

This side dish was well received in my house. After reading the reviews for more flavor I decided to use fresh onion and garlic instead of powdered and also to cook the orzo in chicken broth. Had one serving leftover which wasn't bad warmed in the microwave. Nice side that went well with AR recipe Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style

My 3 stars is based on recipe made as written. I thought it was pretty bland. Im suprised at all the rave reviews. I didnt care for the cooking method either. I made a different orzo recipe on here and it called for the orzo to be simmered in chicken stock until cooked. It was much more flavorful that way. I ended up adding a heck of alot more seasoning and parmesan to give it more flavor. Probably wont use this one again.

I love this recipe. Simple, delicious flavors. It turned out perfectly on the first try.. I used half the amount of butter it asked for to make it healthier, but I'm pretty sure you don't need it at all. I added some crushed dried mint and I loved it!

Put in fresh onion and a little garlic before adding the mushrooms.  Otherwise made as directed.  It tasted great, even my 3 year old and 18 month old ate it.  I used some small Japanese mushrooms that hid well.  Next time I'll decrease the butter because it was a little too rich for my husband and I.  Otherwise, it was great.  Will try again with the slight variation.

I have leftovers which I feel will be fine chilled. Maybe with a splash of red wine vinegar. I did add two slices of Swiss cheese as it was our entree. Maybe next time some Red Bell pepper added also to complete the rainbow effect.

I thought this was a great base recipe, however I thought it needed more seasonings. We upped the onion, added an extra half tablespoon of butter and added some garlic powder.

Quick, easy side dish.  Went well with our broiled salmon. We were out of parsley, so substituted cilantro instead. Delicious!

I love orzo pasta. I grew up eating it mostly in soups, and now, I enjoy it in salads and side dishes like this one.
This is light and delicious. Can be eaten hot or cold.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and added grated parmesan at the end. I also didn't have onion powder so I sauteed onion and a clove of garlic with the peas and corn butter and EVOO. It was a hit! Even my hubby that hates peas had 2nds!

This is a fantastic side dish! I added more corn and peas than called for, to use up what I had on hand (I used fresh corn on the cob, 2 ears and about 1/2 a bag of frozen peas). I served this with Grilled Salmon I, also from this site, and it was delicious! Saving this one to my recipe box!

Didn't have parsley on hand, so could not add it. Made everything as directed. Was a perfect side dish. Next time I might try it with chicken

Wow!  With a couple of additions this turned out fantastic, and well received at a dinner with friends.  I cooked the orzo in chicken stock.  When sauteeing the mushrooms I added fresh minced garlic and slivered onions.  Since there would be six of us I doubled the recipe, and fortunately had a bit leftover to bring home.  Simple seasoning with ground salt and pepper and total success.  Can't wait to make it again -- maybe add some chicken or smoked sausage.  Yum.

This was yum! I used canned mushrooms since I didn't have fresh and I sauteed an onion in evoo instead of onion powder. I also cooked the orzo in 4 C chicken broth and let it cook until all the water was gone and the orzo was soft. Thanks for the great recipe!

Whenever I cook orzo I always make extra to keep on hand in the freezer - a great time-saver on busy nights.  I used some from my freezer to make this recipe.  I probably used more mushrooms than called for, but I needed to use them up.  The flavor of this is subtle and makes for an excellent side dish to almost anything.  Also, I made this ahead, refrigerated it, and reheated it in the microwave just before serving.  We enjoyed this and we'll be making it again.  Thank you!

I love orzo, but to date, I hadn't found an orzo recipe that my boys (husband included) liked. Everyone gobbled this one up! Thanks for a great inexpensive and easy recipe!

Excellent! I doubled the recipe and made it as written, except used a medium-large chopped onion instead of onion powder. (I did not double the oil and butter.)  I will definitely make this again. One of the best recipes I've made from this site.  And very, very easy!

Pretty good, attractive, and not difficult to prepare. Somewhat bland, so it is a good foil for more highly seasoned dishes. Thanks!

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite side dishes!  It goes with everything, and it is so yummy!  The great thing is I always have these ingredients on hand, so it is easy to prepare.  Thanks for submitting a wonderful and diverse recipe!
